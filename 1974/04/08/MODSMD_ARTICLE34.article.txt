Nixon Returns From Paris Summit
WASHINGTON — President Nixon returned yesterday
from a sudden summit in Paris, his aides saying that the
world leaders he met still view him as a key force in the
quest for global stability.
Especially bolstered, according to White House officials,
were hopes for Nixon's upcoming trip to the Soviet Union,
with some progress already recorded on the issue ofnudear
controls.
Nixon went to the French capital to attend a memorial
service for Georges Pompidou, the French president who
died last Tuesday.
While there, Nixon met with the leaders of seven nations
also in Paris for the Pompidou memorial.
According to presidential chief of staff, Gen. Alexander
Haig, the meetings did not cover the Watergate scandal or
President Nixon's domestic problems. However, it was
apparent that the administration was trying to indicate
Nixon's important role in world affairs as a buttress against
moves for impeachment.
Nixon spent yesterday morning meeting separately with
Soviet President Nicolai Podgorny and Japanese Premier
Kakeui Tanaka. Saturday Nixon saw officials from Great
Britain, West Germany, Italy, Denmark and France.
Gaullist Party Backs Delmas
PARIS — The Gaullist party threw its backing behind
former Premier Jacques Chaban-Delmas yesterday in the
bitter election battle to succeed the late Georges Pompidou
as president of France.
The decision was taken by the party's central
committee. Secretary General Alexander Sanguinetti said
the party was not naming a candidate, but only supporting
Chaban-Delmas in the race.
The decision seemed to indicate there is no longer any
hope for stifling personal political ambitions and forcing an
agreement on a single Gaullist candidate.
Voters will probably have a choice of three candidates
professing loyalty to the principles of Gen. Charles de
Gaulle in the first round of voting May 5.
Ranged against the Gaullists will be Francois Mitterrand,
secretary general of the Socialist party who is expected to
have the support of the Communists and at least 10 other
candidates with only tiny followings.
Golan Heights Conflict Continues
Artillery boomed on the Golan Heights for the 27th
straight day yesterday. Syria and Israeli warplanes strafed a
Styian army position on Mt. Hermon twice, but Israel
denied any new air activity.
On Saturday, Israeli war-planes were used on the Golan
front for the first time since the October Middle East war.
Israel said they were called in after a Syrian force crossed
the truce line and attacked an Israeli position on Mt.
Hermon at the northern tip of the front.
In Tripoli, the state news media told Libyans that Col.
Moammar Khadafy had turned over some of his duties to
Premier Abdel Salam Jalloud. But diplomatic and

government sources said Khadafy is still undisputed leader
of the oil-rich nation.
"It doesn't look like Khadafy's lost any power except
handing over some functions such as meeting and greeting
dignitaries to Jalloud," a Western diplomat in Tripoli said.
But he cautioned that it may take some weeks to fully
assess the developments.
Kalmbach Silent On Rebozo Gifts
Herbert W. Kalmbach declined yesterday to confirm or
deny published reports that C.G. "Bebe" Rebozo told him
he had given money intended as political contributions to
President Nixon's brothers and personal secretary.
The reports, published by the Washington Post and New
York Times, quoted sources as saying Kalmbach testified
under oath to the Senate Watergate committee about a
conversation with Rebozo. Those stories quoted the sources
as saying that Kalmbach said Rebozo told him that he,
Rebozo, had given part of a secret cash contribution to F.
Donald Nixon and Rose Mary Woods, Nixon's secretary.
The Times' story also included Edward Nixon as an
alleged recipient of the money.
"The only response I can make is no comment,"
Kalmbach, Nixon's former personal attorney, said in a
telephone interview from his home, in Newport Beach,
Calif. "I'm sorry I can't be more helpful."
The Times quoted well-placed sources as saying
Kalmbach told the Senate committee last month that
Rebozo had asked him a year ago for advice about the
$100,000 contribution received from Howard Hughes. The
money was returned last year.
IRS Examines Nixon Tax Returns
WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
apparently has yet to close its files on whether fraud was
committed in the preparation of President Nixon's tax
returns in recent years.
IRA Commissioner Donald C. Alexander Sunday
confirmed a White House statement that no cause had been
found for leveling such a charge against Nixon personally.
But when asked if the same were true of those who
helped draft the returns, he replied: "I can't comment on
what action the IRS may be or may not be taking with
respect to others." Alexander said also that "you're talking
about an IRS investigation" when newsmen brought up
reports that parts of a $100,000 campaign contribution
from Howard Hughes had been passed to President Nixon's
personal secretary and his two brothers. He would not
elaborate.
