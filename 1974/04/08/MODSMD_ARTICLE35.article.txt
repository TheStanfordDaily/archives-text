### 
A bomb threat disrupted the ASSU Sunday Flick Deliverance last night
at 10:40 and forced the evacuation of the viewing audience.
Chief John Barr of the Stanford Fire Department said the University
switchboard received the phoned bomb threat which said there was a stick
of dynamite in the rear rows of the lower seating area of Memorial
Auditorium.
Following a search by Stanford Fire, Santa Clara County Sheriff's and
Stanford Public Safety Officers, the crowd was let back in and the movie
resumed at 11:00.
