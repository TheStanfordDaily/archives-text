Stanford's "Tribute to Duke Ellington" is definitely going to happen
according to Dan Scher, one of the event's organizers. Although he has
cancelled other engagements, Ellington "is playing Stanford" Scher emphasized
last night.
Because of Ellington's recent illness and subsequent cancellations, ticket
sales for the Sacred Concert April 29 have fallen off for both the $2.50
afternoon and $10 evening performances, Scher said.
Tickets are still available for both events, Scher stated. Even though
Ellington has cancelled his Great American Music Hall appearance in San
Francisco, the Stanford Sacred Concert will be performed.
