# McCloskey Seeks Student Vote Here
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Congressman Paul McCloskey,
R-Menlo Park, spent the weekend
visiting the Stanford campus,
participating in a whirlwind series of
informal meetings with small groups of
students.
McCloskey continually emphasized
that he is vulnerable in the June 4
primary unless he receives a large
number of votes from students who
register Republican.
McCloskey acknowledged that if he
can win the primary, his chances for
election in November are excellent.
Despite McCloskey's problems
winning the support of members of his
own party, he emphasized that he has
no intention of becoming a Democrat.
"Should you leave your party
merely to get elected?" he asked a
group of people at Escondido Village
Friday. "This is the essence of what
causes lack of respect for our
politicians. They do only what is
politic."
Cross-Party Votes
McCloskey pointed out that being a
Republican does not hinder his
effectiveness in Congress, since
cross-party voting occurs on most
issues. The real reactionaries in
Congress are the committee chairmen,
he noted. "We have rebels in both
parties who are trying to overthrow
the seniority system," he stated.
Furthermore, he said, he believed
Democrats Henry Jackson and George
Wallace are no better than Spiro
Agnew or H.R. Haldeman. "What are
the Democrats going to do if Wallace
gets nominated?" he asked.
McCloskey predicted that few
Republicans will survive the November
election unless Nixon is impeached.
But he predicted that the House of
Representatives will impeach the
President in May or June.
McCloskey stated that Nixon's

withholding of evidence antagonized
much of what little support the
President still enjoyed in Congress.
'Military Attitude Incredible'
'"This Prussian military attitude of
the President's is an incredible position
historically," McCloskey declared.
"No other president has ever refused
to cooperate with an investigation that
might lead to impeachment."
McCloskey praised the press for
exposing the Watergate scandal, and
said the main hope of the nation in
overcoming public corruption lies in
the investigations of the free press.
He also noted that the Watergate
trauma has proven again the resilience
of the U.S. Constitution.
"This country is running very well
considering we just learned that our
Vice President is a criminal and that
our President probably is one also," he
declared. "Justice is being done
although it is slow and painful."
Higher Standard
McCloskey added, "I find a much
increased standard of performance
among my colleagues in the House as a
result of Watergate."
McCloskey stated that government
spending will probably become a
major issue of congressional campaigns
this year.
"The greatest problem facing the
nation is the way in which it has
become used to deficit spending," he
said. "This is all right in wartime, but
it can't be justified as an ordinary way
of life."
McCloskey chided Congress for
never "having the guts to limit federal
spending." He noted that deficit
spending "inexorably causes
inflation."
But McCloskey defended his recent
support for an increase in the national
minimum wage. "I've seen too many
people struggling to get along on $1.80
an hour," he said.

Agnew or H.R. Haldeman. "What are
the Democrats going to do if Wallace
gets nominated?" he asked.
McCloskey predicted that few
Republicans will survive the November
election unless Nixon is impeached.
But he predicted that the House of
Representatives will impeach the
President in May or June.
McCloskey stated that Nixon's

withholding of evidence antagonized
much of what little support the
President still enjoyed in Congress.
'Military Attitude Incredible'
'"This Prussian military attitude of
the President's is an incredible position
historically," McCloskey declared.
"No other president has ever refused
to cooperate with an investigation that
might lead to impeachment."
McCloskey praised the press for
exposing the Watergate scandal, and
said the main hope of the nation in
overcoming public corruption lies in
the investigations of the free press.
He also noted that the Watergate
trauma has proven again the resilience
of the U.S. Constitution.
"This country is running very well
considering we just learned that our
Vice President is a criminal and that
our President probably is one also," he
declared. "Justice is being done
although it is slow and painful."
Higher Standard
McCloskey added, "I find a much
increased standard of performance
among my colleagues in the House as a
result of Watergate."
McCloskey stated that government
spending will probably become a
major issue of congressional campaigns
this year.
"The greatest problem facing the
nation is the way in which it has
become used to deficit spending," he
said. "This is all right in wartime, but
it can't be justified as an ordinary way
of life."
McCloskey chided Congress for
never "having the guts to limit federal
spending." He noted that deficit
spending "inexorably causes
inflation."
But McCloskey defended his recent
support for an increase in the national
minimum wage. "I've seen too many
people struggling to get along on $1.80
an hour," he said.

INCUMBENT — Rep. Paul McCloskey, R-Menlo Park, talked to students over
the weekend, seeking their support in his race for the Republican nomination.
Congressman Paul McCloskey,
R-Menlo Park, spent the weekend
visiting the Stanford campus,
participating in a whirlwind series of
informal meetings with small groups of
students.
McCloskey continually emphasized
that he is vulnerable in the June 4
primary unless he receives a large
number of votes from students who
register Republican.
McCloskey acknowledged that if he
can win the primary, his chances for
election in November are excellent.
Despite McCloskey's problems
winning the support of members of his
own party, he emphasized that he has
no intention of becoming a Democrat.
"Should you leave your party
merely to get elected?" he asked a
group of people at Escondido Village
Friday. "This is the essence of what
causes lack of respect for our
politicians. They do only what is
politic."
Cross-Party Votes
McCloskey pointed out that being a
Republican does not hinder his
effectiveness in Congress, since
cross-party voting occurs on most
issues. The real reactionaries in
Congress are the committee chairmen,
he noted. "We have rebels in both
parties who are trying to overthrow
the seniority system," he stated.
Furthermore, he said, he believed
Democrats Henry Jackson and George
Wallace are no better than Spiro
Agnew or H.R. Haldeman. "What are
the Democrats going to do if Wallace
gets nominated?" he asked.
