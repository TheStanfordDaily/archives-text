# Pittendrigh Outlines Report For Council

### DON COX 
Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh
briefed the Academic Council Friday
afternoon on the main features of the
recently released Report on the
Professoriate authored by a committee
which Pittendrigh chaired.
Addressing the 80 Academic
Council members present in the
Physics tank for the body's quarterly
meeting, Pittendrigh outlined the
committee's recommendations for the
development of departmental
handbooks describing faculty
appointment, promotion and tenure
processes and changes in the Academic
Council charter.
Pittendrigh said the handbooks
were necessary to dispel the uneasiness
in junior faculty uncertain of "the
rules of the game."
Weighted Votes
One of the main, and most
controversial revisions of the
Academic Council charter is a
provision which would weight the
votes of Academic Council members in
relation to the number of students
enrolled in the respective schools or
departments.
The main intent of the weighting
scheme is to minimize the impact of
schools which have large faculty

bodies but small student enrollment.
The School of Medicine presently
constitutes 27 percent of the
Academic Council, although med
students comprise only four percent of
the entire student body.
With the installation of the
proposed weighting scheme, the
Medical School's effective voting
strength would be reduced to 16
percent.
The weighting scheme is even more
important in light of current plans to
add 100 people to the Medical School's
clinical faculty. A similar weighted
voting system is currently used in the
Faculty Senate.
Mail Ballot Proposed
The committee's recommendations
also call for a mandatory mail ballot if
the Academic Council wishes to
overturn a Faculty Senate decision.
Medical Prof. Halsted Holman said
that this would render Academic
Council debates on the issue in
question "meaningless" since faculty
members would not bother to come to
the meetings and hear the debate if
they could vote by mail.
Pittendrigh responded saying a mail
ballot was necessary to obtain an
accurate account of the faculty's
opinion on the issue.
