# New Telephone System Will Allow Direct Dialing
## 
### BONITA B. RODDEN 
At 12:01 a.m. on Monday, April 22 it will be possible to
dial directly to any University extension instead of going
through a central operator.
At this time the University will switch to a new
telephone system — Centralized Telephone Exchange
Service (Centrex).
The project has taken nineteen months to complete. It
has come well within the $718,000 budget allotted by the
Board of Trustees and Pacific Telephone.
The essentia] aspect of the new system, according to
Bruce Wiggins, operations manager for Plant Services and
coordinator of the Centrex cutover, is "direct inward
dialing and direct outward dialing." The advantage is "the
capability of avoiding the operator," he said.
'Poor Service'
"The need for improved service — the poor service of the
four systems" — Hansen Laboratories, the Medical Center,
Stanford Electronics Laboratories and the main University
switchboard — prompted the changeover, Wiggins
explained.
For normal service 98 percent of the calls should get
through to the operators, Wiggins said. Only two percent of
the people calling the switchboard should hear busy signals.
Presently 40 percent of the calls at Stanford are not getting
through, he explained.
"The growth on campus outgrew the physical plan of
the telephone building," he noted. The telephone building
near Terman Engineering Laboratories in White Plaza

cannot be expanded to compensate for the growth of the
campus.
The Telecommunications building has been constructed
at Bonair Siding near Plant Services to house Centrex.
There, the four previously independent systems will be
consolidated. The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center will
not be affected. Its distance from the rest of the campus
would make it too expensive of a project, Wiggins stated.
Old Switchboard Replaced
A small electronic console and a rotary index listing
every University number will substitute for the traditional
switchboard. All of the present switchboard operators will
bp assigned new jobs. "There will not be a single lay-off,"
Wiggins commented.
Wiggins hopes to save between $80-85,000 of the
University's million-dollar annual phone bill because he will
not have to hire any new operators. A different rate system
will also reduce costs.
The billing system will also be more efficient, declares
Wiggins. Instead of having the operator record each long
distance call, all calls will be recorded automatically on
computer tape and the downtown central office of Pacific
Telephone. The tapes will be delivered to the University
each month and run through the University's computers.
Each department will receive a detailed bill in computer
form. Wiggins says this system "puts the responsibility
rightfully where it should be. It is up to the department to
control the budget."

which will allow direct dialing to all University extensions beginning April 22.
