# New Telephone System Will Allow Direct Dialing
## 
### BONITA B. RODDEN 
At 12:01 a.m. on Monday, April 22 it will be possible to
dial directly to any University extension instead of going
through a central operator.
At this time the University will switch to a new
telephone system — Centralized Telephone Exchange
Service (Centrex).
The project has taken nineteen months to complete. It
has come well within the $718,000 budget allotted by the
Board of Trustees and Pacific Telephone.
The essentia] aspect of the new system, according to
Bruce Wiggins, operations manager for Plant Services and
coordinator of the Centrex cutover, is "direct inward
dialing and direct outward dialing." The advantage is "the
capability of avoiding the operator," he said.
'Poor Service'
"The need for improved service — the poor service of the
four systems" — Hansen Laboratories, the Medical Center,
Stanford Electronics Laboratories and the main University
switchboard — prompted the changeover, Wiggins
explained.
For normal service 98 percent of the calls should get
through to the operators, Wiggins said. Only two percent of
the people calling the switchboard should hear busy signals.
Presently 40 percent of the calls at Stanford are not getting
through, he explained.
"The growth on campus outgrew the physical plan of
the telephone building," he noted. The telephone building
near Terman Engineering Laboratories in White Plaza

cannot be expanded to compensate for the growth of the
campus.
The Telecommunications building has been constructed
at Bonair Siding near Plant Services to house Centrex.
There, the four previously independent systems will be
consolidated. The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center will
not be affected. Its distance from the rest of the campus
would make it too expensive of a project, Wiggins stated.
Old Switchboard Replaced
A small electronic console and a rotary index listing
every University number will substitute for the traditional
switchboard. All of the present switchboard operators will
bp assigned new jobs. "There will not be a single lay-off,"
Wiggins commented.
Wiggins hopes to save between $80-85,000 of the
University's million-dollar annual phone bill because he will
not have to hire any new operators. A different rate system
will also reduce costs.
The billing system will also be more efficient, declares
Wiggins. Instead of having the operator record each long
distance call, all calls will be recorded automatically on
computer tape and the downtown central office of Pacific
Telephone. The tapes will be delivered to the University
each month and run through the University's computers.
Each department will receive a detailed bill in computer
form. Wiggins says this system "puts the responsibility
rightfully where it should be. It is up to the department to
control the budget."

BUSY BODY — This man has literally got connections. He's installing wiring for the Pacific Telephone Centrex system,
which will allow direct dialing to all University extensions beginning April 22.
Another favorable aspect of Centrex, according to
Wiggins, is that direct dialing hastens access to University
offices and personnel for off-campus callers.
To reach 80 percent of the extensions, a person can dial
497, the University prefix, plus the present extension
number. Code complications have forced the remaining 20
percent to be changed. Inside callers will be able to dial the
extension as before with the addition of a "7" prefix.
For example, as of April 22, an off-campus caller will
dial 497-4632 to reach the Daily. On-campus callers, those
with University extensions, will dial 74632.
Long distance calls from an extension will resemble
those made from a home phone with direct outward
dialing. Instead of going through the operator to dial long
distance, dial "9", the area code and the number.
The first number of the foreign exchange lines
(frequently mistermed tie-lines) will be changed to a "5"
with Centrex. To dial San Jose from an extension, for
example, dial "56" plus the phone number.
Lines to Sunnyvale (currently dialed "76") and San
Francisco (currently "75") have been doubled to improve
service. Service to the Pacifica area will be eliminated from
the new San Francisco exchange line.
The actual tie-lines, direct lines between University
switchboards, will not be affected by Centrex.
Transfers The Same
The method of transferring calls will not change
essentially. Holding the button under the receiver for two
seconds will attract the attention of the console attendant
who will transfer the call. Holding the button down longer
than four seconds will disconnect the party.
For those who do not know an extension there will still
be a central information number (71411 from an

on-campus extension and 497-2300 for others). The
console attendants will connect a caller with the extension
but will urge him or her to dial directly next time.
During the first few weeks there will be an intercept
operation, Wiggins said, for people who call the old
University number, 321-2300.
Instead of hearing a recording, the caller will listen to an
explanation of Centrex by one of fifteen specially hired
intercept operators. The operator will give the caller the
new number of the extension he or she is trying to call and
any additional extensions he calls frequently. The caller will
be instructed to dial the numbers directly.
Needs Self-Discipline
Wiggins emphasized the purpose of Centrex is to get
people to dial directly, not to use the central number.
Departmental and individual self-discipline will determine
the success of the Centrex system. "It's the people that
make it run, not the equipment," he stated.
In order to assure cooperation from outside callers and
inside faculty and staff, an extensive orientation program
has been organized.
Daily half-hour sessions, run by representatives from
Pacific Telephone and the University, are being held until
April 19 at several locations on campus and at the Medical
Center. The purpose of these sessions is to acquaint the
faculty and staff with the features of the new system.
Faculty and staff are being furnished with postage-paid
cards and stickers for stationery which they can use to
inform frequent callers of their new numbers.
A new University telephone directory listing all the
extensions has been distributed to each faculty and staff
telephone on campus. The 1974 Pacific Telephone
directories have also been amended to include four times as
many Stanford listings than before Centrex.
At 12:01 a.m. on Monday, April 22 it will be possible to

not be affected. Its distance from the rest of the campus
would make it too expensive of a project, Wiggins stated.
Old Switchboard Replaced
A small electronic console and a rotary index listing
every University number will substitute for the traditional
switchboard. All of the present switchboard operators will
bp assigned new jobs. "There will not be a single lay-off,"
Wiggins commented.
Wiggins hopes to save between $80-85,000 of the
University's million-dollar annual phone bill because he will
not have to hire any new operators. A different rate system
will also reduce costs.
The billing system will also be more efficient, declares
Wiggins. Instead of having the operator record each long
distance call, all calls will be recorded automatically on
computer tape and the downtown central office of Pacific
Telephone. The tapes will be delivered to the University
each month and run through the University's computers.
Each department will receive a detailed bill in computer
form. Wiggins says this system "puts the responsibility
rightfully where it should be. It is up to the department to
control the budget."

BUSY BODY — This man has literally got connections. He's installing wiring for the Pacific Telephone Centrex system,
which will allow direct dialing to all University extensions beginning April 22.
Another favorable aspect of Centrex, according to
Wiggins, is that direct dialing hastens access to University
offices and personnel for off-campus callers.
To reach 80 percent of the extensions, a person can dial
497, the University prefix, plus the present extension
number. Code complications have forced the remaining 20
percent to be changed. Inside callers will be able to dial the
extension as before with the addition of a "7" prefix.
For example, as of April 22, an off-campus caller will
dial 497-4632 to reach the Daily. On-campus callers, those
with University extensions, will dial 74632.
Long distance calls from an extension will resemble
those made from a home phone with direct outward
dialing. Instead of going through the operator to dial long
distance, dial "9", the area code and the number.
The first number of the foreign exchange lines
(frequently mistermed tie-lines) will be changed to a "5"
with Centrex. To dial San Jose from an extension, for
example, dial "56" plus the phone number.
Lines to Sunnyvale (currently dialed "76") and San
Francisco (currently "75") have been doubled to improve
service. Service to the Pacifica area will be eliminated from
the new San Francisco exchange line.
The actual tie-lines, direct lines between University
switchboards, will not be affected by Centrex.
Transfers The Same
The method of transferring calls will not change
essentially. Holding the button under the receiver for two
seconds will attract the attention of the console attendant
who will transfer the call. Holding the button down longer
than four seconds will disconnect the party.
For those who do not know an extension there will still
be a central information number (71411 from an

on-campus extension and 497-2300 for others). The
console attendants will connect a caller with the extension
but will urge him or her to dial directly next time.
During the first few weeks there will be an intercept
operation, Wiggins said, for people who call the old
University number, 321-2300.
Instead of hearing a recording, the caller will listen to an
explanation of Centrex by one of fifteen specially hired
intercept operators. The operator will give the caller the
new number of the extension he or she is trying to call and
any additional extensions he calls frequently. The caller will
be instructed to dial the numbers directly.
Needs Self-Discipline
Wiggins emphasized the purpose of Centrex is to get
people to dial directly, not to use the central number.
Departmental and individual self-discipline will determine
the success of the Centrex system. "It's the people that
make it run, not the equipment," he stated.
In order to assure cooperation from outside callers and
inside faculty and staff, an extensive orientation program
has been organized.
Daily half-hour sessions, run by representatives from
Pacific Telephone and the University, are being held until
April 19 at several locations on campus and at the Medical
Center. The purpose of these sessions is to acquaint the
faculty and staff with the features of the new system.
Faculty and staff are being furnished with postage-paid
cards and stickers for stationery which they can use to
inform frequent callers of their new numbers.
A new University telephone directory listing all the
extensions has been distributed to each faculty and staff
telephone on campus. The 1974 Pacific Telephone
directories have also been amended to include four times as
many Stanford listings than before Centrex.
At 12:01 a.m. on Monday, April 22 it will be possible to
dial directly to any University extension instead of going
through a central operator.
At this time the University will switch to a new
telephone system — Centralized Telephone Exchange
Service (Centrex).
The project has taken nineteen months to complete. It
has come well within the $718,000 budget allotted by the
Board of Trustees and Pacific Telephone.
The essentia] aspect of the new system, according to
Bruce Wiggins, operations manager for Plant Services and
coordinator of the Centrex cutover, is "direct inward
dialing and direct outward dialing." The advantage is "the
capability of avoiding the operator," he said.
'Poor Service'
"The need for improved service — the poor service of the
four systems" — Hansen Laboratories, the Medical Center,
Stanford Electronics Laboratories and the main University
switchboard — prompted the changeover, Wiggins
explained.
For normal service 98 percent of the calls should get
through to the operators, Wiggins said. Only two percent of
the people calling the switchboard should hear busy signals.
Presently 40 percent of the calls at Stanford are not getting
through, he explained.
"The growth on campus outgrew the physical plan of
the telephone building," he noted. The telephone building
near Terman Engineering Laboratories in White Plaza

cannot be expanded to compensate for the growth of the
campus.
The Telecommunications building has been constructed
at Bonair Siding near Plant Services to house Centrex.
There, the four previously independent systems will be
consolidated. The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center will
not be affected. Its distance from the rest of the campus
would make it too expensive of a project, Wiggins stated.

percent to be changed. Inside callers will be able to dial the
extension as before with the addition of a "7" prefix.
For example, as of April 22, an off-campus caller will
dial 497-4632 to reach the Daily. On-campus callers, those
with University extensions, will dial 74632.
Long distance calls from an extension will resemble
those made from a home phone with direct outward
dialing. Instead of going through the operator to dial long
distance, dial "9", the area code and the number.
The first number of the foreign exchange lines
(frequently mistermed tie-lines) will be changed to a "5"
with Centrex. To dial San Jose from an extension, for
example, dial "56" plus the phone number.
Lines to Sunnyvale (currently dialed "76") and San
Francisco (currently "75") have been doubled to improve
service. Service to the Pacifica area will be eliminated from
the new San Francisco exchange line.
The actual tie-lines, direct lines between University
switchboards, will not be affected by Centrex.
Transfers The Same
The method of transferring calls will not change
essentially. Holding the button under the receiver for two
seconds will attract the attention of the console attendant
who will transfer the call. Holding the button down longer
than four seconds will disconnect the party.
For those who do not know an extension there will still
be a central information number (71411 from an

on-campus extension and 497-2300 for others). The
console attendants will connect a caller with the extension
but will urge him or her to dial directly next time.
During the first few weeks there will be an intercept
operation, Wiggins said, for people who call the old
University number, 321-2300.
Instead of hearing a recording, the caller will listen to an
explanation of Centrex by one of fifteen specially hired
intercept operators. The operator will give the caller the
new number of the extension he or she is trying to call and
any additional extensions he calls frequently. The caller will
be instructed to dial the numbers directly.
Needs Self-Discipline
Wiggins emphasized the purpose of Centrex is to get
people to dial directly, not to use the central number.
Departmental and individual self-discipline will determine
the success of the Centrex system. "It's the people that
make it run, not the equipment," he stated.
In order to assure cooperation from outside callers and
inside faculty and staff, an extensive orientation program
has been organized.
Daily half-hour sessions, run by representatives from
Pacific Telephone and the University, are being held until
April 19 at several locations on campus and at the Medical
Center. The purpose of these sessions is to acquaint the
faculty and staff with the features of the new system.
Faculty and staff are being furnished with postage-paid
cards and stickers for stationery which they can use to
inform frequent callers of their new numbers.
A new University telephone directory listing all the
extensions has been distributed to each faculty and staff
telephone on campus. The 1974 Pacific Telephone
directories have also been amended to include four times as
many Stanford listings than before Centrex.
At 12:01 a.m. on Monday, April 22 it will be possible to
dial directly to any University extension instead of going
through a central operator.
At this time the University will switch to a new
telephone system — Centralized Telephone Exchange
Service (Centrex).
The project has taken nineteen months to complete. It
has come well within the $718,000 budget allotted by the
Board of Trustees and Pacific Telephone.
The essentia] aspect of the new system, according to
Bruce Wiggins, operations manager for Plant Services and
coordinator of the Centrex cutover, is "direct inward
dialing and direct outward dialing." The advantage is "the
capability of avoiding the operator," he said.
'Poor Service'
"The need for improved service — the poor service of the
four systems" — Hansen Laboratories, the Medical Center,
Stanford Electronics Laboratories and the main University
switchboard — prompted the changeover, Wiggins
explained.
For normal service 98 percent of the calls should get
through to the operators, Wiggins said. Only two percent of
the people calling the switchboard should hear busy signals.
Presently 40 percent of the calls at Stanford are not getting
through, he explained.
"The growth on campus outgrew the physical plan of
the telephone building," he noted. The telephone building
near Terman Engineering Laboratories in White Plaza

cannot be expanded to compensate for the growth of the
campus.
The Telecommunications building has been constructed
at Bonair Siding near Plant Services to house Centrex.
There, the four previously independent systems will be
consolidated. The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center will
not be affected. Its distance from the rest of the campus
would make it too expensive of a project, Wiggins stated.
Old Switchboard Replaced
A small electronic console and a rotary index listing
every University number will substitute for the traditional
switchboard. All of the present switchboard operators will
bp assigned new jobs. "There will not be a single lay-off,"
Wiggins commented.
Wiggins hopes to save between $80-85,000 of the
University's million-dollar annual phone bill because he will
not have to hire any new operators. A different rate system
will also reduce costs.
The billing system will also be more efficient, declares
Wiggins. Instead of having the operator record each long
distance call, all calls will be recorded automatically on
computer tape and the downtown central office of Pacific
Telephone. The tapes will be delivered to the University
each month and run through the University's computers.
Each department will receive a detailed bill in computer
form. Wiggins says this system "puts the responsibility
rightfully where it should be. It is up to the department to
control the budget."

BUSY BODY — This man has literally got connections. He's installing wiring for the Pacific Telephone Centrex system,
which will allow direct dialing to all University extensions beginning April 22.
Another favorable aspect of Centrex, according to
Wiggins, is that direct dialing hastens access to University
offices and personnel for off-campus callers.
To reach 80 percent of the extensions, a person can dial
497, the University prefix, plus the present extension
number. Code complications have forced the remaining 20
percent to be changed. Inside callers will be able to dial the
extension as before with the addition of a "7" prefix.
For example, as of April 22, an off-campus caller will
