Reply To KFJC
Editor:
The station manager of KFJC,
Keith Garvey, has accused Mark
Lawrence and Lloyd Snook of
KZSU of "presumptuous and rude
arrogance" in their negotiations
with KFJC over KZSU's request
for increased power (letter, April
4).
Well, I in turn am shocked that
Mr. Garvey would then be so
arrogant and so presumptuous as
to try to dictate, as an outsider,
matters of KZSU programming
policy, which is no concern of his.
It seems quite clear that the
difficulties in negotiation between
KFJC and KZSU have their causes
at KFJC, too.

Help Needed
Editor:
The Senior Class Officers are
now in the process of organizing
activities for graduation weekend
and we need your input.
We need to choose two or
three faculty to speak at the Class
Day Luncheon on Saturday, June
15. The class gift will also be
presented at this Luncheon. We
would appreciate your help in
choosing these speakers and the
recipient of the class gift.
Please mail suggestions to Box
4373, Stanford, or call 327-0469
or 326-2629.
It has been suggested that an
alternative to renting academic
cap and gown be offered. One
suggestion is that each student be
given the option of donating that
rental fee to one of several
designated organizations or
charities. We would like to hear
your opinions on this idea.
A Senior Happy Hour has been
planned for Thursday, April 11 at
the Amber Lantern starting at 10
p.m. Stanford ID will be required
and no minors will be admitted.
See you all there!

'Daily' Deadlock
Editor:
I must express my
disappointment at the Daily's
deadlock over the ASSU
endorsement. It appears to me
that the Bacon ticket's criticism
of their opposition's "empty
ASSU titles" needs revaluation.
ASSU titles are only as empty
as the people holding them. Isn't
the Bacon ticket running for these
very same titles in this election?
Certainly a ticket such as
Herman's, one that did take the
time to work out 44 pages of
proposals with detailed plans for
implementation, has produced
and will produce.
It is unjust to brand a massive
program as "surely impossible to
implement." A massive program,
when backed up with facts and
figures for definite
implementation, can only be a
positive thing and deserves the
opportunity to show that the
ASSU need not be merely a
collection of empty titles.

Bacon Endorsement
Editor:
After carefully examining the
six slates running for ASSU
Council of Presidents this year, we
believe only the Bacon-Baron-
Echaveste-Handy slate possesses
the sense of purpose and the
personal capabilities needed to be
effective.
All four members of the slate
have demonstrated their
capabilities in projects and

organizations outside the ASSU,
and three of the four have been
active in ASSU affairs. Their past
records demonstrate that they
have the energy and ability to
make the ASSU work.
We are particularly impressed
with their concern for the
character of undergraduate
education at Stanford. At present,
all of the student - initiated
innovative programs are in
jeopardy.
SCIRE is all but defunct.
SWOPSI, which has this year had
more courses and students than
ever before, is losing its director.
ARLO (Action Research Liaison
Office) and CROW (Center for
Research On Women) are still in a
fledgling state.
These programs need vigorous
ASSU support if they are to
survive. We believe that the Bacon
slate will devote to these programs
the serious attention they need.
The Bacon slate's proposals for
ASSU Task Forces to deal with
the advising system and curricular
deficiencies are sound. ASSU Task
Forces can be effective vehicles
for marshalling student concerns
about their education, as was
demonstrated by the Task Force
which produced The Other
Stanford.
Their proposals in the area of
student services, while not as
glamorous as some made by other
slates, are at least more attainable.
Their stated concerns for women
and minority students have more
credibility than those of any other
slate.
We urge students to vote for
Bacon-Baron-Echaveste-Handy on
April 10 and 11.

'Aliyah' Support
Editor:
Over the past week, members
of the editorial board of the
Stanford Aliyah (Jewish student
newspaper) contacted ASSU
presidential candidates from each
of the six slates. Each slate was
given the opportunity to respond
to questions dealing with cultural
pluralism in general, and. issues
concerning many Jewish students
(such as a future Jewish theme
house proposal) in particular.
The manner in which each slate
responded should be noted by all
student groups that plan to deal
with th& ASSU next year.
On the phone, each party
responded in a positive manner:
yes, our slate is concerned; yes,
our slate supports cultural and
ethnic groups on campus, etc. Yet
only one slate bothered to take
the time to type up a response to
our queries.
This same slate was the only
one to admit that they were not
fully aware of some of the issues
we raised â€” though it was clear to
us that none of the other slates
was any more aware. And this
slate was the only slate to come to
us to listen and discuss in depth
what we had to say.
What we see of value in this
one slate goes beyond their views
on single issues. While promises
are difficult to judge in the final
days of an election campaign, a
true concern and willingness to
listen during this same period is
significant, especially when all
candidates are given an equal
chance to show this concern.
The slate we are speaking of is
that of 800 Bacon, Chris Baron,
Maria Echaveste, and Jack Handy.
Unfortunately, the next issue of
the Stanford Aliyah will not be
printed until after the election.
Nevertheless, the Aliyah gives its
full endorsement to the Bacon,
Baron, Echaveste, and Handy
slate.
