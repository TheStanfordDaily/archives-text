# Colorado May Offer Franklin Faculty Post
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
H. Bruce Franklin, fired Stanford
English professor, may be offered a
teaching position at the University of
Colorado.
Franklin's appointment has been
approved by the University of
Colorado English department and the
Jniversity administration, according
to Assoc. English Prof. Paul Levitt,
head of the English Department there.
The Colorado Board of Regents
must now give final approval to the
appointment.
Franklin, 39, was dismissed from
his post here following an extremely
controversial University inquiry into
his participation in student unrest in
1971.
Melville Scholar
"Franklin is a noted scholar on
Herman Melville and is an excellent
teacher," Levitt told the Daily
' 'esterday. The fact that he also
happens to be an avowed Maoist is
irrelevant to the consideration of his
credentials, Levitt added.
"If we reject Franklin on the basis
of his political views, then this is not
the liberal institution {;hat it is
supposed to be," Levitt stated. "We
jre no more concerned about a
professor's political views than we
would care about his sex practices or
his religious beliefs."
Levitt noted that although Franklin
was dismissed from Stanford because
he allegedly incited students to
violence, Franklin has never been
convicted by any civil court.
Approval Probable
Levitt said the Board of Regents
will probably approve the Franklin
offer because the board recognizes the
need for academic freedom and
appreciates Franklin's reputation as a
scholar.
"We are a more liberal institution
than Stanford," Levitt commented.
"Stanford is internationally known for
its connections with big business."
Colorado Board of Regents,
Chairman Robert Gilbert said
yesterday he expccts that the Board
will vote upon the matter at its next
meeting, late in April. The issue was
scheduled for discussion by the board
at its March 26 meeting, but was
postponed, Gilbert said.
Election Year
Gilbert also noted that some people
in the English department at
University of Colorado do not believe
that the board will approve Franklin's
appointment. He pointed out that this
is an election year, and some of the
members of the Board might be afraid
of exciting political controversy.
Gilbert emphasized that he wanted
to read the transcript of the hearings
that preceded Franklin's dismissal
from Stanford.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice provost
and advisor to President Richard
Lyman, said yesterday the office of
the Colorado Board of Regents asked
Stanford to send it a copy of the
testimony Franklin gave the faculty
advisory board which later
recommended his dismissal.
Stanford Refusal
Stanford offered to send the entire

transcript of the proceedings, but
refused to send an edited copy
containing only Franklin's remarks,
Rosenzweig said. The Colorado Board
of Regents office declined the offer.
"To have sent only Franklin's
testimony would have left us open to
charges of being selective and unfair,"
Rosenzweig explained.
"Franklin was a participant
throughout the proceedings and it
would not have been right to give the
University of Colorado only the
remarks of Franklin."
Opposition
Colorado Regent Fred Betz stated
he is unsure whether the Board would
approve Franklin's appointment. He
noted that one Board member, Dale
Atkins has already publicly expressed
opposition to the proposed
appointment. Betz said he would
probably support Franklin. "I'm
always inclined to give a person an
opportunity to prove his worth," Betz
said.
Franklin's appointment would be
for a three year term, Betz explained.
The officials of the University would
then decide whether or not to grant
him tenure," Betz commented.

HOPEFUL— H. Bruce Franklin, fired by Stanford in 1972, is hopeful that the
Colorado Board of Regents will approve his appointment to the English
Department of the University of Colorado. Franklin is shown here in February,
1973.
Wesleyan University in Connecticut
in February offered Franklin a
one-semester teaching fellowship.
Franklin Hopeful
In an interview last night, Franklin
told the Daily he could accept the
position at Wesleyan and then go to
the University of Colorado.
Franklin also said he was "hopeful
of receiving an appointment to the
University of Colorado. No one in the
English department there agrees with
my views on literature and politics,
which is one reason that it voted
overwhelmingly to appoint me."
Franklin accused Stanford officials
of trying to prevent him from
receiving employment at a number of
universities, including the University
of Colorado.
Political Views
Franklin said that the University of
Colorado is well aware of his political
views, since he lectured there a
number of times during the recent
World Affairs Conference.
Levitt agreed with Franklin that the
Stanford administration is attempting
to prevent Franklin from receiving a
teaching position.
"I don't usually like to use the
word 'conspiracy'," Levitt said. "But I
am beginning to think that there is
indeed a conspiracy to keep Franklin
unemployed."
But Rosenzweig stated that the
"allegation that the University is
trying to blackball Franklin by sending
information to officials of the
University of Colorado isn't true. We
have no interest in preventing him
from receiving employment."

Levitt said the Board of Regents
will probably approve the Franklin
offer because the board recognizes the
need for academic freedom and
appreciates Franklin's reputation as a
scholar.
"We are a more liberal institution
than Stanford," Levitt commented.
"Stanford is internationally known for
its connections with big business."
Colorado Board of Regents,
Chairman Robert Gilbert said
yesterday he expccts that the Board
will vote upon the matter at its next
meeting, late in April. The issue was
scheduled for discussion by the board
at its March 26 meeting, but was
postponed, Gilbert said.
Election Year
Gilbert also noted that some people
in the English department at
University of Colorado do not believe
that the board will approve Franklin's
appointment. He pointed out that this
is an election year, and some of the
members of the Board might be afraid
of exciting political controversy.
Gilbert emphasized that he wanted
to read the transcript of the hearings
that preceded Franklin's dismissal
from Stanford.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice provost
and advisor to President Richard
Lyman, said yesterday the office of
the Colorado Board of Regents asked
Stanford to send it a copy of the
testimony Franklin gave the faculty
advisory board which later
recommended his dismissal.
Stanford Refusal
Stanford offered to send the entire

transcript of the proceedings, but
refused to send an edited copy
containing only Franklin's remarks,
Rosenzweig said. The Colorado Board
of Regents office declined the offer.
"To have sent only Franklin's
testimony would have left us open to
charges of being selective and unfair,"
Rosenzweig explained.
"Franklin was a participant
throughout the proceedings and it
would not have been right to give the
University of Colorado only the
remarks of Franklin."
Opposition
Colorado Regent Fred Betz stated
he is unsure whether the Board would
approve Franklin's appointment. He
noted that one Board member, Dale
Atkins has already publicly expressed
opposition to the proposed
appointment. Betz said he would
probably support Franklin. "I'm
always inclined to give a person an
opportunity to prove his worth," Betz
said.
Franklin's appointment would be
for a three year term, Betz explained.
The officials of the University would
then decide whether or not to grant
him tenure," Betz commented.

HOPEFUL— H. Bruce Franklin, fired by Stanford in 1972, is hopeful that the
Colorado Board of Regents will approve his appointment to the English
Department of the University of Colorado. Franklin is shown here in February,
1973.
Wesleyan University in Connecticut
in February offered Franklin a
one-semester teaching fellowship.
Franklin Hopeful
In an interview last night, Franklin
told the Daily he could accept the
position at Wesleyan and then go to
the University of Colorado.
Franklin also said he was "hopeful
of receiving an appointment to the
University of Colorado. No one in the
English department there agrees with
my views on literature and politics,
which is one reason that it voted
overwhelmingly to appoint me."
Franklin accused Stanford officials
of trying to prevent him from
receiving employment at a number of
universities, including the University
of Colorado.
Political Views
Franklin said that the University of
Colorado is well aware of his political
views, since he lectured there a
number of times during the recent
World Affairs Conference.
Levitt agreed with Franklin that the
Stanford administration is attempting
to prevent Franklin from receiving a
teaching position.
"I don't usually like to use the
word 'conspiracy'," Levitt said. "But I
am beginning to think that there is
indeed a conspiracy to keep Franklin
unemployed."
But Rosenzweig stated that the
"allegation that the University is
trying to blackball Franklin by sending
information to officials of the
University of Colorado isn't true. We
have no interest in preventing him
from receiving employment."
H. Bruce Franklin, fired Stanford
English professor, may be offered a
teaching position at the University of
Colorado.
Franklin's appointment has been
approved by the University of
Colorado English department and the
Jniversity administration, according
to Assoc. English Prof. Paul Levitt,
head of the English Department there.
The Colorado Board of Regents
must now give final approval to the
appointment.
Franklin, 39, was dismissed from
his post here following an extremely
controversial University inquiry into
his participation in student unrest in
1971.
Melville Scholar
"Franklin is a noted scholar on
Herman Melville and is an excellent
teacher," Levitt told the Daily
' 'esterday. The fact that he also
happens to be an avowed Maoist is
irrelevant to the consideration of his
credentials, Levitt added.
"If we reject Franklin on the basis
of his political views, then this is not
the liberal institution {;hat it is
supposed to be," Levitt stated. "We
jre no more concerned about a
professor's political views than we
would care about his sex practices or
his religious beliefs."
Levitt noted that although Franklin
was dismissed from Stanford because
he allegedly incited students to
violence, Franklin has never been
convicted by any civil court.
Approval Probable
Levitt said the Board of Regents
will probably approve the Franklin
offer because the board recognizes the
need for academic freedom and
appreciates Franklin's reputation as a
scholar.

refused to send an edited copy
containing only Franklin's remarks,
Rosenzweig said. The Colorado Board
of Regents office declined the offer.
"To have sent only Franklin's
testimony would have left us open to
charges of being selective and unfair,"
Rosenzweig explained.
"Franklin was a participant
throughout the proceedings and it
would not have been right to give the
University of Colorado only the
remarks of Franklin."
Opposition
Colorado Regent Fred Betz stated
he is unsure whether the Board would
approve Franklin's appointment. He
noted that one Board member, Dale
Atkins has already publicly expressed
opposition to the proposed
appointment. Betz said he would
probably support Franklin. "I'm
always inclined to give a person an
opportunity to prove his worth," Betz
said.
Franklin's appointment would be
for a three year term, Betz explained.
The officials of the University would
then decide whether or not to grant
him tenure," Betz commented.

HOPEFUL— H. Bruce Franklin, fired by Stanford in 1972, is hopeful that the
Colorado Board of Regents will approve his appointment to the English
Department of the University of Colorado. Franklin is shown here in February,
1973.
Wesleyan University in Connecticut
in February offered Franklin a
one-semester teaching fellowship.
Franklin Hopeful
In an interview last night, Franklin
told the Daily he could accept the
position at Wesleyan and then go to
the University of Colorado.
Franklin also said he was "hopeful
of receiving an appointment to the
University of Colorado. No one in the
English department there agrees with
my views on literature and politics,
which is one reason that it voted
overwhelmingly to appoint me."
Franklin accused Stanford officials
of trying to prevent him from
receiving employment at a number of
universities, including the University
of Colorado.
Political Views
Franklin said that the University of
Colorado is well aware of his political
views, since he lectured there a
number of times during the recent
World Affairs Conference.
Levitt agreed with Franklin that the
Stanford administration is attempting
to prevent Franklin from receiving a
teaching position.
"I don't usually like to use the
word 'conspiracy'," Levitt said. "But I
am beginning to think that there is
indeed a conspiracy to keep Franklin
unemployed."
But Rosenzweig stated that the
"allegation that the University is
trying to blackball Franklin by sending
information to officials of the
University of Colorado isn't true. We
have no interest in preventing him
from receiving employment."
H. Bruce Franklin, fired Stanford
English professor, may be offered a
teaching position at the University of
Colorado.
Franklin's appointment has been
approved by the University of
Colorado English department and the
Jniversity administration, according
to Assoc. English Prof. Paul Levitt,
head of the English Department there.
The Colorado Board of Regents
must now give final approval to the
appointment.
Franklin, 39, was dismissed from
his post here following an extremely
controversial University inquiry into
his participation in student unrest in
1971.
Melville Scholar
"Franklin is a noted scholar on
Herman Melville and is an excellent
teacher," Levitt told the Daily
' 'esterday. The fact that he also
happens to be an avowed Maoist is
irrelevant to the consideration of his
credentials, Levitt added.
"If we reject Franklin on the basis
of his political views, then this is not
the liberal institution {;hat it is
supposed to be," Levitt stated. "We
jre no more concerned about a
professor's political views than we
would care about his sex practices or
his religious beliefs."
Levitt noted that although Franklin
was dismissed from Stanford because
he allegedly incited students to
violence, Franklin has never been
convicted by any civil court.
Approval Probable
Levitt said the Board of Regents
will probably approve the Franklin
offer because the board recognizes the
need for academic freedom and
appreciates Franklin's reputation as a
scholar.
"We are a more liberal institution
than Stanford," Levitt commented.
"Stanford is internationally known for
its connections with big business."
Colorado Board of Regents,
Chairman Robert Gilbert said
yesterday he expccts that the Board
will vote upon the matter at its next
meeting, late in April. The issue was
scheduled for discussion by the board
at its March 26 meeting, but was
postponed, Gilbert said.
Election Year
Gilbert also noted that some people
in the English department at
University of Colorado do not believe
that the board will approve Franklin's
appointment. He pointed out that this
is an election year, and some of the
members of the Board might be afraid
of exciting political controversy.
Gilbert emphasized that he wanted
to read the transcript of the hearings
that preceded Franklin's dismissal
from Stanford.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice provost
and advisor to President Richard
Lyman, said yesterday the office of
the Colorado Board of Regents asked
Stanford to send it a copy of the
testimony Franklin gave the faculty
advisory board which later
recommended his dismissal.
Stanford Refusal
Stanford offered to send the entire

transcript of the proceedings, but
refused to send an edited copy
containing only Franklin's remarks,
Rosenzweig said. The Colorado Board
of Regents office declined the offer.
"To have sent only Franklin's
testimony would have left us open to
