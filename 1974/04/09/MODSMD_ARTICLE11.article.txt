# McCloskey Faces Tough Primary
## 
### 
William Ross

Political studies show that more
incumbent congressmen are defeated in
primaries than in general elections. This fact
is particularly germane when examining the
political situation this year in the twelfth
Congressional District.
Congressman Paul McCloskey, R— Menlo
Park, seems to be highly vulnerable in his
attempt to win in the June 4 primary. If he is
renominated, he seems likely to win a fifth
term in Congress in the November election.
Yet close examination of the political
climate in the district indicates that
McCloskey is not in as much trouble as is
popularly assumed. He is obviously facing a
tough race against his main opponent, J.
Gordon Knapp. But the image of McCloskey
fighting for his political life in an uphill
struggle is at best premature, and at worst
hyperbolic.
Knapp, a millionaire Atherton
businessman, is making an appeal for
conservative votes. This seems to worry
McCloskey, who frequently points out that
he polled only 43 percent of the vote in the
1972 primary. As the vote in 1972 was
divided between two conservative candidates,
McCloskey reasons that Knapp might unite
the conservatives to defeat him.
More Conservative Voters
There is reason to believe that this might
happen. Indeed McCloskey might receive
fewer votes than he garnered in 1972. A
reapportionment — masterminded in part by
Knapp — has brought more conservative
voters into the district. McCloskey also says
he fears a reaction among loyal Nixonites due
to his advocacy of impeachment. He often

quotes a Menlo Park poll that seems to
indicate his tenuous chances for re-election,
showing that voters disapprove of his
performance in Congress by a margin of
nearly two to one.
But McCloskey also enjoys certain
advantages. In 1972, his record was as liberal
as it is today, and he was running as a
presidential candidate against Nixon, then at
the zenith of his power.
While voters seem unimpressed by
McCloskey's early opposition to Nixon, there
is no reason to believe that his calls for
impeachment have antagonised more voters
than were disturbed in 1972 when he took to
the hills of New Hampshire for several weeks
in his crusade against Nixon.
But most importantly, there is no reason
why McCloskey cannot make a genuine
appeal to the conservative voters of the
district. On a number of issues, McCloskey
fails to conform to his liberal reputation.
Balanced Budget Supported
McCloskey is emphasizing the need for a
balanced budget, a position that should win
him votes among many conservatives in the
district. Also, he is advocating the need for a
stronger Congress and a weaker president.
This position, if skillfully presented to the
voters, could be popular among the particular
type of conservative found in California.
Ironically, McCloskey — who won support
among youths for his anti-war view — has
expressed skepticism about the viability of
the volunteer army. Knapp says that he
strongly supports a volunteer army.
Even McCloskey's criticism of Nixon's
foreign policy could be used to win him
conservative votes. The detente of the

Kissinger era is not likely to be very popular
among any consistent conservative.
Nevertheless, Knapp is a formidable
opponent for McCloskey. A life-long resident
of the Peninsula, he is so well known that he
was able to run as a write-in candidate in the
1972 primary and poll 25 percent of the
vote.
Conservative Votes
His opposition to impeachment and his
support of capital punishment are two issues
which might win him votes among
conservative Republicans.
Both he and McCloskey are emphasizing
the issues of inflation and conservation and it
is likely that Knapp's proposals for solutions
to problems in these areas will prove just as
convincing to the voters as those of
McCloskey. Both want to reduce federal
spending to curb inflation.
In addition to McCloskey and Knapp,
John Fredrich, a Palo Alto carpenter, is
running in the Republican primary. With no
campaign funds, and no formal headquarters
or staff, Fredrich has received little publicity
and is not a major factor in the race.
Fredrich believes in a reduction of
government spending, especially military
spending, but is reluctant to speak about
most of the issues, claiming he is still
studying them.
Hence at the present time, it would seem
reasonable to predict a close race between
McCloskey and Knapp. But with two months
remaining until the primary, there is still time
for the campaign dramatically to change form.

McCloskey is not in as much trouble as is
popularly assumed. He is obviously facing a
tough race against his main opponent, J.
Gordon Knapp. But the image of McCloskey
fighting for his political life in an uphill
struggle is at best premature, and at worst
hyperbolic.
Knapp, a millionaire Atherton
businessman, is making an appeal for
conservative votes. This seems to worry
McCloskey, who frequently points out that
he polled only 43 percent of the vote in the
1972 primary. As the vote in 1972 was
divided between two conservative candidates,
McCloskey reasons that Knapp might unite
the conservatives to defeat him.
More Conservative Voters
There is reason to believe that this might
happen. Indeed McCloskey might receive
fewer votes than he garnered in 1972. A
reapportionment — masterminded in part by
Knapp — has brought more conservative
voters into the district. McCloskey also says
he fears a reaction among loyal Nixonites due
to his advocacy of impeachment. He often

quotes a Menlo Park poll that seems to
indicate his tenuous chances for re-election,
showing that voters disapprove of his
performance in Congress by a margin of
nearly two to one.
But McCloskey also enjoys certain
advantages. In 1972, his record was as liberal
as it is today, and he was running as a
presidential candidate against Nixon, then at
the zenith of his power.
While voters seem unimpressed by
McCloskey's early opposition to Nixon, there
is no reason to believe that his calls for
impeachment have antagonised more voters
than were disturbed in 1972 when he took to
the hills of New Hampshire for several weeks
in his crusade against Nixon.
But most importantly, there is no reason
why McCloskey cannot make a genuine
appeal to the conservative voters of the
district. On a number of issues, McCloskey
fails to conform to his liberal reputation.
Balanced Budget Supported
McCloskey is emphasizing the need for a
balanced budget, a position that should win
him votes among many conservatives in the
district. Also, he is advocating the need for a
stronger Congress and a weaker president.
This position, if skillfully presented to the
voters, could be popular among the particular
type of conservative found in California.
Ironically, McCloskey — who won support
among youths for his anti-war view — has
expressed skepticism about the viability of
the volunteer army. Knapp says that he
strongly supports a volunteer army.
Even McCloskey's criticism of Nixon's
foreign policy could be used to win him
conservative votes. The detente of the

Kissinger era is not likely to be very popular
among any consistent conservative.
Nevertheless, Knapp is a formidable
opponent for McCloskey. A life-long resident
of the Peninsula, he is so well known that he
was able to run as a write-in candidate in the
1972 primary and poll 25 percent of the
vote.
Conservative Votes
His opposition to impeachment and his
support of capital punishment are two issues
which might win him votes among
conservative Republicans.
Both he and McCloskey are emphasizing
the issues of inflation and conservation and it
is likely that Knapp's proposals for solutions
to problems in these areas will prove just as
convincing to the voters as those of
McCloskey. Both want to reduce federal
spending to curb inflation.
In addition to McCloskey and Knapp,
John Fredrich, a Palo Alto carpenter, is
running in the Republican primary. With no
campaign funds, and no formal headquarters
or staff, Fredrich has received little publicity
and is not a major factor in the race.
Fredrich believes in a reduction of
government spending, especially military
spending, but is reluctant to speak about
most of the issues, claiming he is still
studying them.
Hence at the present time, it would seem
reasonable to predict a close race between
McCloskey and Knapp. But with two months
remaining until the primary, there is still time
for the campaign dramatically to change form.

Political studies show that more
incumbent congressmen are defeated in
primaries than in general elections. This fact
is particularly germane when examining the
political situation this year in the twelfth
Congressional District.
Congressman Paul McCloskey, R— Menlo
Park, seems to be highly vulnerable in his
attempt to win in the June 4 primary. If he is
renominated, he seems likely to win a fifth
term in Congress in the November election.
