# ASSU Politics-Unfulfilled Promises
## 
### 
O'Rourke, Pigott

This year, as in past years, the
Daily has endorsed a set of
grandiose promises and naive
enthusiasm for the ASSU Council
of Presidents, refusing to admit
the disappointing record of the
Council of Presidents in the past
and the smallness of the chance
that any of this current round of
promises can or ever will be
realized.
The Daily Editorial Board has
endorsed the Bacon and Herman
slates (department stores, lecture
notes, and lots of good things) in
the belief that it is endorsing
services to the students.
What they have endorsed is
actually a mere continuation of
the political branch of the ASSU
which wastes the student's money
and clouds service-oriented
purposes of the ASSU.
If the promises of the two
endorsed slates sound familiar — a
new and expanded course review,
a service on campus,
and a student store — it's because
such promises get thrown around
every year at this time.
Last year's winners, the O'Grady
slate had a particularly impressive
list of promises: an on-campus
pub, lower tuition for part-time
students, and a publication to be
entitled Student Guide to
Stanford Education. Not one of
these has been fulfilled.
Other Promises
And there were more. The
O'Grady slate also promised "a
new, improved Tresidder"
featuring "a grocery store, a
discount record store, dry
cleaning services and
pharmaceutical services." This
sounds strikingly similar to the
Stanford Student Store currently

being offered as an inducement to
vote for the Herman ticket. Those
who intend to vote for Herman on
the basis of such a promise should
reflect upon the lack of success of
the O'Grady slate in obtaining
such.
The O'Grady platform also
included a pledge to establish an
off-campus housing service that
would provide "a standard
contract form to serve as a guide
for students unfamiliar with the
terms of leases."
No such service exists; nor does
any such contract guide. This is
fortunate indeed for the Bacon
slate, because it gives them an
opportunity to promise A Guide
for Off-Campus Living, which
would presumably include several
thousand helpful hints for
apartment seekers, including,
"how to read a lease."
Note-taking Service
Last but not least, both the
Herman and Bacon slates have
been speaking out in favor of a
lecture note-taking service at
Stanford. This particular promise
is one of the grandest traditions in
Stanford politics; it was made not
only by O'Grady, but also by
Scott Burke before him.
The point of this whole
discussion is that student
politicians consistently promise a
hell of a lot more than they can or
ever do deliver. We want to see
this trend broken and, therefore,
support the slate of Smyth,
Kincannon, Del Beccaro, and
Chavez. They realistically see the
limited scope of the ASSU and
the harms which accrue from
voting for empty promises.
They want the ASSU to do the
things it can do well, things such
as the Sunday Flicks, the charter
flights, etc., without squandering

thousands of dollars for services
not rendered and providing a few
students with a platform from
which to speak for the student
body on issues external to the
University.
Salaries Eliminated
By eliminating salaries of the
officers, descretionary funds, and
the general -operation costs of the
political branches of the ASSU,
this slate could cut $20,000 from
the existing ASSU budget.
Smyth's slate like the others, sees
student government as a service to
the students, but unlike the
others, does not make unkeepable
promises.
Instead, they would not accept
pay and limit their activities to
involvement with realistic services

to students, those aspects of the
job which do not require money
(appointments, etc.), and efforts
to prevent the current waste of
money.
We can kid ourselves and vote
for another round of promises, or
wise up and notice the actual
nature of our student associatior.
Given the record of petty politics
and unfulfilled promises and the
cost involved, we opt for the
latter, and recommend to the
student body that it choose the
Smyth slate in the upcoming
election.

Stanford Education. Not one of
these has been fulfilled.
Other Promises
And there were more. The
O'Grady slate also promised "a
new, improved Tresidder"
featuring "a grocery store, a
discount record store, dry
cleaning services and
pharmaceutical services." This
sounds strikingly similar to the
Stanford Student Store currently

being offered as an inducement to
vote for the Herman ticket. Those
who intend to vote for Herman on
the basis of such a promise should
reflect upon the lack of success of
the O'Grady slate in obtaining
such.
The O'Grady platform also
included a pledge to establish an
off-campus housing service that
would provide "a standard
contract form to serve as a guide
for students unfamiliar with the
terms of leases."
No such service exists; nor does
any such contract guide. This is
fortunate indeed for the Bacon
slate, because it gives them an
opportunity to promise A Guide
for Off-Campus Living, which
would presumably include several
thousand helpful hints for
apartment seekers, including,
"how to read a lease."
Note-taking Service
Last but not least, both the
Herman and Bacon slates have
been speaking out in favor of a
lecture note-taking service at
Stanford. This particular promise
is one of the grandest traditions in
Stanford politics; it was made not
only by O'Grady, but also by
Scott Burke before him.
The point of this whole
discussion is that student
politicians consistently promise a
hell of a lot more than they can or
ever do deliver. We want to see
this trend broken and, therefore,
support the slate of Smyth,
Kincannon, Del Beccaro, and
Chavez. They realistically see the
limited scope of the ASSU and
the harms which accrue from
voting for empty promises.
They want the ASSU to do the
things it can do well, things such
as the Sunday Flicks, the charter
flights, etc., without squandering

thousands of dollars for services
not rendered and providing a few
students with a platform from
which to speak for the student
body on issues external to the
University.
Salaries Eliminated
By eliminating salaries of the
officers, descretionary funds, and
the general -operation costs of the
political branches of the ASSU,
this slate could cut $20,000 from
the existing ASSU budget.
Smyth's slate like the others, sees
student government as a service to
the students, but unlike the
others, does not make unkeepable
promises.
Instead, they would not accept
pay and limit their activities to
involvement with realistic services

to students, those aspects of the
job which do not require money
(appointments, etc.), and efforts
to prevent the current waste of
money.
We can kid ourselves and vote
for another round of promises, or
wise up and notice the actual
nature of our student associatior.
Given the record of petty politics
and unfulfilled promises and the
cost involved, we opt for the
latter, and recommend to the
student body that it choose the
Smyth slate in the upcoming
election.

O'Rourke, Pigott

This year, as in past years, the
Daily has endorsed a set of
grandiose promises and naive
enthusiasm for the ASSU Council
of Presidents, refusing to admit
the disappointing record of the
Council of Presidents in the past
and the smallness of the chance
that any of this current round of
promises can or ever will be
realized.
The Daily Editorial Board has
endorsed the Bacon and Herman
slates (department stores, lecture
notes, and lots of good things) in
the belief that it is endorsing
services to the students.
What they have endorsed is
actually a mere continuation of
the political branch of the ASSU
which wastes the student's money
and clouds service-oriented
purposes of the ASSU.
If the promises of the two
endorsed slates sound familiar — a
new and expanded course review,
a service on campus,
and a student store — it's because
such promises get thrown around
every year at this time.
Last year's winners, the O'Grady
slate had a particularly impressive
list of promises: an on-campus
pub, lower tuition for part-time
students, and a publication to be
entitled Student Guide to
Stanford Education. Not one of
these has been fulfilled.
