Why Grade Conscious?
Editor:
Tim Peterson in his recent
article (April 3) makes the trite
observation that students don't
seem to be as involved as they
should be, and then fails to ask
the interesting and crucial
questions.
Why are students grade
oriented and anxious for jobs?
Peterson'notes simply that they
are grade conscious, without
inquiring why. He ignores the fact
that social values like "the wheat
separated from the chaff"
principle which operates in the
grading system compel many to
strive for the almighty "A." The
consciousness of grades is just part
of a larger set of social values.
Further, he sets up a false
dichotomy between studying and
involvement One activity need
not conflict with the other, and
political involvement informed by
intelligent research is probably
more productive.
Tho question of the type and
level of student involvement is
another critical question that
Peterson ignores. He quotes his
sister's anti-Nixon jokes with the
implication that this constitutes a
heightened level of involvement
beyond most Stanford students.
One need only listen to casual
conversations among all types of
students to disprove this assertion.
Anti-Nixon references are
pervasive among all manner of
students, and a poor criterion for
political awareness. The crux of
the matter is that Peterson
defines involvement from his own
political perspective.
What type of involvement
Peterson would approve is also
left curiously unspecified.
Parenthetically he implies that a
return to the rock throwing days
would not distress him. To me
this form of involvement is a
travesty of political activity.
Finally, Peterson implicitly
assumes that a higher level of
political awareness and
involvement on the part of
students would lead to political
change and reform. This notion
seems somewhat naive if not
terribly sanguine, given the power
structure in America today.

'Streak In Peace'
Editor:
I am puzzled by Rand
Burnett's article in the Daily (Apr.
2). My original letter to the Daily
condemning streaking was written
as an exercise in repressive
thinking, with full knowledge that
it was content-free (i.e., lacking in
any meaningful information),
consisting only of bias, prejudice
and irrational statements.
As the author, it was obvious
to me that this was the case with
my letter. I hope that Rand's
article was written with the same
satirical aim, but it has
demonstrated that such an
interpretation is not obvious, and
I fear that some people may
actually believe the article.
I want to take this opportunity
to completely disassociate myself
from the repression and
intolerance exhibited in both my
earlier letter and Rand Burnett's
article. Let the people streak in
peace.

Specific Proposals
Editor:
This year's ASSU presidential
campaign confronts the students
of Stanford with a clear-cut
choice as to whether they desire
an administration of individuals
meddling in non-student-oriented
political and social affairs, or a
group of four persons able to act
as a team toward the common
goal of improving conditions for
all Stanford students.
The ticket of Mike Herman,
Ann Carter, Len Mackey, and
Quinn Mayer offers several
specific proposals which stand to
benefit all students. Most
noteworthy of these are the
formation of the Stanford
Student Store (SSS), and a
well-organized lecture notes
program.
Moreover, the Herman slate
presents precise means of making
these ideas realities: the economic
foundations of each of these
proposals have been detailed
down to facts and figures which
indicate that they are feasible.
The Bacon slate has placed
emphasis on issues which do not
directly concern most Stanford
students, i.e. Public Interest
Research Group (PIRG) and the
Prison Information Center.
Herman, Carter, Mackey, and
Mayer present concrete means for
establishing programs which will
directly benefit members of the
Stanford student body. The
choice is ours. It is a clear-cut
choice and it demands a clear,
rational decision.
