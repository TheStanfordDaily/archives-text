# Sammy Davis Jr. Shows Versatility
## 
### JENNIFER RANDISI 
For a performer like Sammy Davis Jr. who has been in show
business over forty years, professionalism is almost a byword. A
recognized virtuoso who is often billed as "the world's greatest
entertainer," Davis enjoyed sell-out crowds during the week of his
engagement at the Circle Star Theatre in San Carlos, March
29-April 4.
Without a doubt one of the most versatile showmen in
America, Davis began his performance on Friday, March 29, with
a few standards in the popular music vein ("Tie a Yellow
Ribbon," "Impossible Dream"), which were followed by medleys
of both recent and 1940s material (Rogers and Hart, Bricusse and
Newley, and the Beatles). For those who have not seen Davis
perform, it is difficult to imagine anyone changing styles as often,
and with as much continuity, as he is able to do. In "Mr.
Bojangles," for example, Davis captures the era of black-face and
soft-shoe with an ease of gesture and posture that are as
technically precise as the James-Brownian style of songs like "Get
It On."
Representative of other eras in music were "The Birth of the
Blues," which was sung in a confidential minor, and "For Once in
my Life," recorded most recently by Stevie Wonder. As well as
performing songs made popular by other artists, Davis sang a few
of his own recordings including "I've Got to Be Me."
