# Dern Looks At Elitism

### JENNIFER RANDISI DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO—Bruce
Dem, in a recent press conference
at the Fairmont Hotel, spoke
candidly about himself and his
role as Tom Buchanan in The
Great Gatsby: "America has no
royalty of its own, so instead we
reverse certain institutionalized
families." Born into a wealthy
Midwest family himself, Dern was
forced to attend Choate School
for Boys which he described as "a
penitentary." In comparing
families in The Great Gatsby to
prominent American families,
Dern made a distinction between
the Rockefellers and the
Kennedys, who he considers
"Gatsby rich."
At one point in the novel,
Fitzgerald states: "They were
careless people, Tom and Daisy —
they smashed up things and
creatures and then retreated back
into their money or their vast
carelessness, or whatever it was
that kept them together, and let
other people clean up the mess
they had made... ." Dern believes
that this perspective of the
American aristocracy is no longer
possible as evidenced by the
Hearst kidnapping.
The characters of Tom and
Daisy Buchanan constitute, in
Dern's opinion, "the arch-villains
of American literature."
Throughout the interview, Dern
alternated between his own
viewpoint and that of Tom
Buchanan. When asked about
Daisy's remark in the film
describing Tom as a "hulking
brute," Dern replied "sure he's a
'hulkingbrute' in a way, but he
doesn't know that." The actor
sees Tom as "a victim of
circumstance."
In making the film, English
director Jack Clayton had two
choices. In Dern's words, "do I
make the book into a movie or

make the movie into a book? He
decided to go line by line — to
make the book into a movie."
Dern spoke of the shortcomings
of the film as well as its strong
points under Clayton's direction;
"One of the problems in the film
is in Clayton's interpretation of
English wealth and American
wealth."
Clayton's theory, according to
Dern, is that there are no
unsympathetic people in the
novel. When asked about the
film's leading man, Robert
Redford, Dern commented that
'he's the nicest man I've ever
worked with — a real gentleman.'
Dern believes Redford "takes
chances" in The Great Gatsby:
"The scene he played best is the
first time he sees Daisy. He really
tried to deal with it."
Of the film's overall effect, the
actor stated "three things get me
emotionally every single time: the
song 'What'll I Do' — whatever the
film misses the song gets, it says it
all; the scene where Myrtle is dead

and I have to go back and deal
with Nick and the rest of them
(the thing I try to pull off more
than anything else is that you
never know what Tom is up to);
Gatsby's father's line where he
says 'my son could have been a
man likes James Jay Hill' — its so
Midwestern."
Speaking as an actor, Dern said
"I'm prouder of my work in
Gatsby than of ahything else I've
ever done — even Laughing
Policeman." During the past 18
years, in which he has made 28
films, Dern has been ostracized
from the upper-class circle of his
childhood. As Dern himself put it,
"there's something tainted about
making a living from being
someone else."
Dern commented in
conclusion, "The saddest thing
about Gatsby is when Bruce Dern
gets the best reviews and Oscar
talk (with Sam Waterston close
behind) then somehow you
haven't made The Great Gatsby."

sees Tom as "a victim of
circumstance."
In making the film, English
director Jack Clayton had two
choices. In Dern's words, "do I
make the book into a movie or

make the movie into a book? He
decided to go line by line — to
make the book into a movie."
Dern spoke of the shortcomings
of the film as well as its strong
points under Clayton's direction;
"One of the problems in the film
is in Clayton's interpretation of
English wealth and American
wealth."
Clayton's theory, according to
Dern, is that there are no
unsympathetic people in the
novel. When asked about the
film's leading man, Robert
Redford, Dern commented that
'he's the nicest man I've ever
worked with — a real gentleman.'
Dern believes Redford "takes
chances" in The Great Gatsby:
"The scene he played best is the
first time he sees Daisy. He really
tried to deal with it."
Of the film's overall effect, the
actor stated "three things get me
emotionally every single time: the
song 'What'll I Do' — whatever the
film misses the song gets, it says it
all; the scene where Myrtle is dead

and I have to go back and deal
with Nick and the rest of them
(the thing I try to pull off more
than anything else is that you
never know what Tom is up to);
Gatsby's father's line where he
says 'my son could have been a
man likes James Jay Hill' — its so
Midwestern."
Speaking as an actor, Dern said
"I'm prouder of my work in
Gatsby than of ahything else I've
ever done — even Laughing
Policeman." During the past 18
years, in which he has made 28
films, Dern has been ostracized
from the upper-class circle of his
childhood. As Dern himself put it,
"there's something tainted about
making a living from being
someone else."
Dern commented in
conclusion, "The saddest thing
about Gatsby is when Bruce Dern
gets the best reviews and Oscar
talk (with Sam Waterston close
behind) then somehow you
haven't made The Great Gatsby."

BRUCE DERN
SAN FRANCISCO—Bruce
Dem, in a recent press conference
at the Fairmont Hotel, spoke
candidly about himself and his
role as Tom Buchanan in The
Great Gatsby: "America has no
royalty of its own, so instead we
reverse certain institutionalized
families." Born into a wealthy
Midwest family himself, Dern was
forced to attend Choate School
for Boys which he described as "a
penitentary." In comparing
families in The Great Gatsby to
prominent American families,
Dern made a distinction between
the Rockefellers and the
Kennedys, who he considers
"Gatsby rich."
At one point in the novel,
Fitzgerald states: "They were
careless people, Tom and Daisy —
they smashed up things and
creatures and then retreated back
into their money or their vast
carelessness, or whatever it was
that kept them together, and let
other people clean up the mess
they had made... ." Dern believes
that this perspective of the
American aristocracy is no longer
possible as evidenced by the
Hearst kidnapping.
The characters of Tom and
Daisy Buchanan constitute, in
Dern's opinion, "the arch-villains
of American literature."
Throughout the interview, Dern
alternated between his own
viewpoint and that of Tom
Buchanan. When asked about
Daisy's remark in the film
describing Tom as a "hulking
brute," Dern replied "sure he's a
'hulkingbrute' in a way, but he
doesn't know that." The actor
sees Tom as "a victim of
circumstance."
