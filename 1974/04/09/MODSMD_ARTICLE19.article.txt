# Young Comedian Sings For Laughs
## 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO—Comedian
Robert Klein appeared six nights
at The Boarding House, April 2-7.
Klein, 32, is of the
"unstructured" school of comedy
to which George Carlin claims to
be a member. Unlike Carlin, who
is famous for "Divorce Game,"
"Wonderful WINO," etc., Klein
does not have any set routines as
such. Instead, he often
concentrates on certain subjects —
athletes, commercials, the 50s,
drugs — but never becomes set in
the material.
Not what could be called a
"subdued" performer, Klein often
screamed, shouted, and screeched
at the audience for emphasis —
not to be confused with the silly
cacophony of a Jerry Lewis or the
insult-humor of a Don Rickles.
Among the topics Klein
touched on Thursday night were:
athletes and drugs ("I'm a tight
end. I do not turn on."); athletes
and commercials, recalling Mickey
Mantle's famous three-word
commercial ("I like Brut.");
Klein's guest-appearance on the
"Jeopardy" quiz show ("Phyliss
Newman $6,600, Robert Klein
just watching."); charities
(".. . that's I-Wanna-Live-Too-
You-Son-Of-A-Bitch, Post Office
Box .. ."); the Watergate
administration, with a very good
impersonation of Gerald Ford's
inauguration speech ("I'm here
today because the last guy was
a felon.");and the national anthem,
with reference to Jose Feliciano's
unorthodox treatment at Yankee
Stadium a few years ago ("He
must've figured no one would
beat the shit out of him 'cos he's
blind.").

To close the first show. Klein
brought out pianist Stanley
Schwartz, of the Melissa
Manchester band, and the two
improvised a song based on a
book title called out by a member
of the audience, Fireplug of My
Life.
Then Klein and Schwartz got
into a blues number a la "I'm A
Man," with Klein shouting
"Machismo!" This evolved into
Klein's blues paraody
"Middle-Class-Educated Blues,"
from his first album, Child of The
Fifties.
*7 got those middle-class
e ducated, college-boy
graduated blues.
Well, I work from 9 to 5, 1 watch
the 'Walter Cronkite News.' "
Proceeding Klein was Melissa
Manchester and her band.
Manchester's singing style seems
to be an amalgamation of several
other singers including Bette
Midler, Carole King, and Janis
Joplin, with a touch of Ray
Charles.
Most of her set was very
repetitious, especially the lyrics,
with the only bright moment
being Schwartz's uptempo clarinet
break in the old standard "I Can't
Get Started."
Manchester closed with a
psuedo-gospel tune entitled "Oh,
Heaven How You've Changed To
Me," received a standing ovation,
and returned for an encore with a
few more choruses.
This week the Boarding House
will present Odetta. Other future
attractions will include blues
singer Jimmy Witherspoon and
Country-folk guitarists Doc and
Merle Watson.

Country-folk guitarists Doc and
Merle Watson.
SAN FRANCISCO—Comedian
Robert Klein appeared six nights
at The Boarding House, April 2-7.
Klein, 32, is of the
"unstructured" school of comedy
to which George Carlin claims to
be a member. Unlike Carlin, who
is famous for "Divorce Game,"
"Wonderful WINO," etc., Klein
does not have any set routines as
such. Instead, he often
concentrates on certain subjects —
athletes, commercials, the 50s,
drugs — but never becomes set in
the material.
Not what could be called a
"subdued" performer, Klein often
screamed, shouted, and screeched
at the audience for emphasis —
not to be confused with the silly
cacophony of a Jerry Lewis or the
insult-humor of a Don Rickles.
Among the topics Klein
touched on Thursday night were:
athletes and drugs ("I'm a tight
end. I do not turn on."); athletes
and commercials, recalling Mickey
Mantle's famous three-word
commercial ("I like Brut.");
Klein's guest-appearance on the
"Jeopardy" quiz show ("Phyliss
Newman $6,600, Robert Klein
just watching."); charities
(".. . that's I-Wanna-Live-Too-
You-Son-Of-A-Bitch, Post Office
Box .. ."); the Watergate
administration, with a very good
impersonation of Gerald Ford's
inauguration speech ("I'm here
today because the last guy was
a felon.");and the national anthem,
with reference to Jose Feliciano's
unorthodox treatment at Yankee
Stadium a few years ago ("He
must've figured no one would
beat the shit out of him 'cos he's
blind.").

To close the first show. Klein
brought out pianist Stanley
Schwartz, of the Melissa
Manchester band, and the two
improvised a song based on a
book title called out by a member
of the audience, Fireplug of My
Life.
Then Klein and Schwartz got
into a blues number a la "I'm A
Man," with Klein shouting
"Machismo!" This evolved into
Klein's blues paraody
"Middle-Class-Educated Blues,"
from his first album, Child of The
Fifties.
*7 got those middle-class
e ducated, college-boy
graduated blues.
Well, I work from 9 to 5, 1 watch
the 'Walter Cronkite News.' "
Proceeding Klein was Melissa
Manchester and her band.
Manchester's singing style seems
to be an amalgamation of several
other singers including Bette
Midler, Carole King, and Janis
Joplin, with a touch of Ray
Charles.
Most of her set was very
repetitious, especially the lyrics,
with the only bright moment
being Schwartz's uptempo clarinet
break in the old standard "I Can't
Get Started."
Manchester closed with a
psuedo-gospel tune entitled "Oh,
Heaven How You've Changed To
Me," received a standing ovation,
and returned for an encore with a
few more choruses.
This week the Boarding House
will present Odetta. Other future
attractions will include blues
singer Jimmy Witherspoon and
Country-folk guitarists Doc and
Merle Watson.
