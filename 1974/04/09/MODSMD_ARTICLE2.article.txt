# Blacks' Switch To Lag Stirs Controversy
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN Background Analysis 
One week ago, Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton
suddenly announced that Stanford's
black theme house next year will be
moved from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia,
in the Lagunita complex.
Half of the 118 places in
Olivo-Magnolia will be assigned to
black students, according to their draw
numbers. The other places will be
filled by the normal draw procedure,
with priority to current residents who
want to remain.
Olivo-Magnolia residents who
choose or _re forced to move will
receive a priority for any other
residence in the housing system, unless
they have a number beyond the cutoff
for University housing.
Different Reactions
The planned black theme house has
elicited different reactions from the
three groups involved: white Roble
residents express quiet elation at the
departure of the black program, black
students have grudgingly accepted the
decision, and Olivo-Magnolia residents
voice anger and misgivings about the
hasty change.
Everyone agrees that the Roble
program was unsatisfactory, but no
one can agree on what sort of
program—if any— would work well.
The course of the negotiations
which ended in the Lagunita plan
remains unclear, because black student
leaders and University officials stoutly
adhere to contradictory positions.
Each side darkly hints at bad faith and
intransigence on the part of the other,
and each professes its own candor.
"Black Cultural Center"
In mid-February, several black

students submitted a proposal for a
new "Black Cultural Center" to
Horton. They envisioned a residence
for about 60 black people, with its
own kitchen and lounge, a room for
meetings, guest rooms, a faculty
resident, provisions for singles and
freshman housing, and other special
amenities.
The proposal went to an advisory
committee of about five student
members, from the Committee on
Student Services, and faculty and
administration representatives from
several University departments.
First Contradiction
Ileite is the first contradiction:
Horton says the blacks submitted the
proposal as a non-negotiable package.
He says they refused to identify
aspects which could be modified or
omitted during their presentation to
the committee.
ASSU co-president Charles Ogletree
and other black spokesmen say they
submitted a working paper, as a point
of departure for revision and
discussion. Ogletree says he left the
advisory committee meeting "with the
impression" that it would try to find a
suitable University residence, perhaps
in a fraternity cluster.
During about 25 hours of meetings,
committee debate focused on the
concept of an all-black house. When a
vote came, during finals week, all
student members were absent; the
seven members present rejected the
plan by a narrow margin.
Horton accepted the
recommendation, announcing his
decision at a Roble meeting on the
Wednesday of finals week. The
meeting then considered other
available options, including changing

Terra House to a black theme house
and perhaps combining it with one of
the Wilbur houses to provide a resident
fellow for freshmen, as University
regulations require.
Here is the second contradiction:
Ogletree says Horton first told the 50
blacks at the meeting that he had not
decided on the Terra suggestion, and
then—faced with an ultimatum of
Terra House or nothing— chose
nothing.
Horton says he told those
participating he was prepared to drop
the black theme program, if it came to
that.
Rejection of Ultimatum
In any case, the meeting ended with
Horton's rejection of the Terra
ultimatium. Afterward, at about 10:30
p.m., Ogletree, ASSU Senate Chairman
Reggie Turner, and another black
visited President Richard Lyman at his
home.

They complained about Horton's
decision. Lyman refused to intervene,
but arranged a meeting with Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyon, Horton's
superior, the next morning.
This two-hour meeting, and one the
same afternoon, first considered an
Administration offer of two Wilbur
houses with a black theme. Blacks
rejected this plan, arguing that two
houses would be too large, and that
Wilbur's facilities were poor.
Bread-And-Butter
In fact, Horton admits that
bread-and-butter considerations, like
carpets, singles, and sinks, may have
been more important than size. Blacks
wanted a house which could attract
students living off-campus; and they
wanted a program with black parity, if
not a black majority.
In the two weeks between first
mention of Lagunita and Horton's
announcement, the 50% figure was set.
