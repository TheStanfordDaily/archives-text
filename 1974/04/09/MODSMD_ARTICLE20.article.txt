# Diz Blows Solid Bop

### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO—It doesn't take a mental
giant to figure out how trumpeter John "Dizzy"
Gillespie got his nick name.
As Ira Gitler wrote in Jazz Masters of the
forties, referring to Gillespie's early days, "He was
observed dancing in the middle of someone else's
turn in a stage show or putting on his metal
trumpet derby and facing the backdrop instead of
the audience."
Judging by his one-night-only appearance at the
Great American Music Hall, Friday, April 5, his
" cage presence has not changed considerably.
Arriving at 10:45 because of an airline mix-up,
his equipment still in Oakland, Dizzy took the stage
to announce, "Fuck Kate Smith!" He then
explained that he was late because he had just
finished a benefit for the Ku Klux Klan and the
United Jewish Appeal which was sponsored jointly
by the Catholic Youth Organization and the SLA,
so we're lucky to be here at all" — an excuse he
has been giving for years on end.
The original beatnik, Dizzy stated his
"philosophy" by saying,"We are all branches of one
tree, leaves of one branch, and fruit thereof."
Dizzy's quartet finally got started at 11:30 with
a Latin number from Black Orpheus. The quartet
consisted of A 1 Gafa (guitar), Earl May (electric
jass), Micker Hocker (drums), and Dizzy playing
his famous disfigured, up-swept trumpet and
congas, often pretending to hurt his fingers on
some of the more energetic rhythms.
Besides his clowning showmanship, another
aspect of Dizzy's performances that fortunately has
not changed during his almost 40 years in jazz is his
; mpeccable trumpet playing.

Dizzy Gillespie was the most advanced
trumpeter of his time and few (if any) have caught
up with him yet. He, along with a few other
innovaters in the 40s, invented bebop, and in fact
gave it its name.
Included in his first set were "Olinda," from
Portrait of Jenny which received a Grammy
nomination, a soul-ish arrangement of Gershwin's
"Summertime," with Diz on vocal, "Ditty Wah
Ditty," and one of Dizzy's most famous
compositions "Night in Tunisia."
The second set was even more varied with
guitarist Gafa stretching out on several tunes,
especially "Ole'," showing that he is among the
best in jazz guitar today.
Another added treat came when San
Francisco's Mary Stallings joined the group to sing
a beautiful rendition of Billie Holiday's "Lover
Man" with nice chording by Gafa and very
sympathetic fills coming from Dizzy's muted
trumpet. Stalling's singing is of the Dinah
Washington-Nancy Wilson school.
Dizzy closed the show by singing a slow blues,
his voice sounding more than slightly like his
trumpet playing. He then fell over backwards and
told the audience to go home — at 2:45 a.m.
When the crowd persuaded Diz to return for an
encore, he called out for a "fast shuffle" and, with
the drummer counting out the beat, blasted a single
note and walked off the stage; a typical Dizzy
Gillespie finale.
In the early stages of his career, Dizzy's playing
was considered by some to be crazy — an opinion
which has since been proven wrong. Maybe
someday someone will be able to explain his
personality.
