# Alan Price Tours USA
## 
### 
SAN FRANClSCO—England's
pianist-organist-vocalist Alan Price
returns to America on tour for the
first time in over ten years,
appearing at the Great American
Music Hall, April 17, Wednesday.
Price was the founder of The
Animals, in the early sixties, and
his organ and piano work can be
heard in the spotlight on most of
their hit records.
Although he was not a vocalist
in The Animals, stepping aside for
lead singer Eric Burdon, Price
handled the lead on his first single
release after leaving the group, "I
Put A Spell On You," a
rearrangement of the Screamin'
Jay Hawkins composition.
The Alan Price Set had a few

» other minor successes with "The
! House That Jack Built," "Hi Lili,
> Hi Lo," and "Simon Smith and
, His Amazing Dancing Bear," but
i none could match the intense
. emotional quality of "I Put A
( Spell On You," an arrangement
I comparable to The Animals'
i "House of the Rising Sun."
In 1973, Price fulfilled a
long-time dream when he wrote
[ the score for a major motion
picture — Lindsay Anderson's O,
Lucky Man! He also appeared in
' the film, which starred Malcom
McDowell.

This, needless to say, brought
the Alan Price Set a sudden
resurgence in popularity, making
it almost imperative that they
come to the States.
Price will be in the Bay Area
for one night only, playing his
jazz-rock style of organ and piano.
Besides appearing on the
soundtrack LP and O, Lucky Man,
and of course many of The
Animals' records, Price has
recently released a new album on
Warner Brothers entitled Between
Today and Yesterday.
