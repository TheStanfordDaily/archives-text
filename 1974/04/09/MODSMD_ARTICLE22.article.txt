The Firesign Theatre returned
to Stanford Thursday for a
scheduled performance in
Memorial Auditorium and an
unscheduled one over the air on
KZSU.
Their show, "Anytown,
U.5.A.," was essentially a long
variation on the theme of their
album I Think We 're All Bozos On
This Bus, with material from the
three previous albums (Waiting for
the Electrician or Someone Like
Him, How Can you Be In Two
Places At Once When You're Not
Anywhere At All and Don Y Crush
That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers
scattered throughout. Porgy
Tirebiter, his friend Mudhead and
"a Clem" were guided throught
the Anytown, U.S.A. exhibit in
"Firesignland," where realistic
robots, computers and holograms
involved them in a myriad of
crazy scenes.
Phil Proctor, Peter Bergman,
Phil Austin and David Ossman
took the stage singing the Porgy
Tirebiter theme song, until Porgy
(Ossman) stepped to the mike and
identified himself as "Worker,"
whereupon the other three robots
stopped. After a brief welcome to
Firesignland and Anytown,
U.S.A., they resumed the
breakfast-Porgy and
Mud head-Principal Poop sequence
from Dwarf. There were enough
Firesign fans in the audience to
shout most of the appropriate
interruptions to the principal's
speech and join in the "pep pills"
cheer.
Turning to some tables at the
rear of the stage for their minimal
props and costume changes, the
robots next became the characters
in Pastor Rod Flash's Church of
the Presumptuous Consumption

of the Blinding Light, also from
Dwarf. A commercial for Ralph
Spoilsport Motors followed, then
led into the "American Pageant"
sequence from Electrician.
Eventually, everyone was in
uniform, and the scene shifted to
Korea, with Pico and Alvarado
returning from patrol:
Lt. Tirebiter: Did you find those
Reds?
Pico: Yeah, we been shooting reds
and yellows all day, man.
Alvarado: Boy, am I sleeeepy. . .
One of the funniest sequences
from Bozos, the "meet the
President" ride followed. "A
Clem" (Proctor) was trying in this
case to find out why he had been
fired as a Firesignland
computer technician, and
succeeded only in scrambling the
President's (Austin's) circuits.

Next was a brief exerpt fron
"The Adventures of Nick Danger'
(from How Can You Be) and «
couple of TV game-show bit
including "Beat the Reaper."
"A Clem" tried a few mori
times to get his job back b>
speaking to Dr. Memory, finalh
destroying the entire compute
(played by Ossman, Austin ant
Bergman), and, incidentally
ending the show. The audienci
called for an encore, but thi
Firesign bozos insisted they wen
out of material.
The fun was not over, however
After the show, the quarte
unwound downstairs in the KZSl
offices and studio. First Ossmai
taped a station break, thei
Proctor wandered into the offici
to do a live station break. Befon

long, Proctor, Ossman and
Bergman had completely taken
over Mike Lopez' MECHA show,
and they were back to doing radio
improvisation.
For a while, Proctor and
Bergman played a pair of
avant-garde film producers, Louis
Louis and Mick Jaguar, with
Ossman trying to moderate the
converstaion. Louis was
eventually dragged away and
beaten by the police, but Jaguar
"didn't want to get involved."
Somehow the scene shifted to
Senate impeachment proceedings,
with Ossman as a drunken
committee chairman and Proctor
as the defendant. After a half
hour or so, the studio turned back
into a pumpkin and The Firesign
Theatre back into whatever they
had been before.

FIRESIGN CHAT—The Firesign Theater over-ran both Memorial Auditorium and KZSU last Thursday
night, with their satirical brand of humor. After finishing their scheduled performance, the "Bozos '
couldn't resist Stanford's airwaves, a practice they're noted for.
