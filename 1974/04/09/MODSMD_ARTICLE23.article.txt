Prosecution Rests In Boyle Case
MEDIA, Pa. — The prosecution in the murder
trial of former United Mine Workers President W.A.
"Tony" Boyle rested its case last night after the key
witness testified that Boyle had ordered the
assassination of Joseph "Jock" Yablonski.
"We're in a fight. We've got to kill Yablonski,
take care of him," William Turnblazer quoted Boyle
as saying on June 23, 1969, at a meeting in UMW
headquarters in Washington, D.C.
Turnblazer, the first person directly to link the
72-year-old Boyle to the killing, said the meeting
took place less than a month after Yablonski
announced his bid to unseat Boyle as union head.
The defense was to begin presentation of its case
today. Charles Moses, chief defense counsel, has
said Boyle would testify in his own defense.
"Were you present when the order was given?"
special prosecutor Richard Sprague asked
Turnblazer, 52, former president of the union's
District 19 in Middlesboro, Ky.
"Yes sir," Turnblazer replied.
"Who gave the order?" Sprague asked.
"Mr. Boyle," Turnblazer said.
Nixon Signs Minimum Wage Bill
WASHINGTON — Legislation raising the federal

minimum wage in stages from $1.60 to $2.30 an
hour was signed into law yesterday by President
Nixon.
Nixon had vetoed similar legislation last year,
and voiced reservations about the measure sent him
by Congress. But he C ".:J he was signing it because
"raising the minimum wage is now a matter of
justice that can no longer be fairly delayed."
The measure raises the minimum wage for 36
million workers covered under the 1966 minimum
wage law from $1.60 to $2.00 on May 1, with other
increases boosting it to $2.30 by Jan. 1, 1976. The
$2.30 rate will be effective for all affected workers
by 1978.
In addition, the legislation extends federal
minimum wage and overtime requirements to 7.4
million additional workers.
When fully effective, the new law will cover 56
million workers.
Israeli Bomber Downed In Lebanon
JERUSALEM — An Israeli fighter-bomber went
down in flames over the embattled Golan Heights
front yesterday, and the two pilots bailed out and
were captured in Lebanon. It was the first Israeli
warplane lost over the front since the October war.
Tank and artillery duels raged from dawn to dusk
along the length of the 40-mile Golan cease-fire line
for the 28th consecutive day. No casualties were
reported.
Syria said the Israeli F4 Phantom was brought
down over Mt. Hermon by its air defense system,
apparently meaning a missile. But Israel denied this,
saying the plane burst into flames because of "a
technical hitch."
Israel admitted using warplanes for the first time
since the October war on Saturday. It said air strikes
were ordered after the Syrians attacked an Israeli
position on 9000-foot Mt. Hermon, on the northern
tip of the heights.
In Damascus, informed sources said Syrian
delegates will leave for Washington within the next
48 hours for talks with Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger on disengagement with Israel on the
heights.
Witness Supports Mitchell, Stans
NEW YORK — A aeiense witness suggested
yesterday that former Cabinet members John N.
Mitchell and Maurice Stans may not have initiated
the alleged cover-up of a secret $200,000 cash
contribution to President Nixon's re-election
campaign.
Sherwin Markman, a Washington lawyer,
suggested that a Securities and Exchange
Commission official may have initiated the cover-up
instead.
Markman's testimony disputed prosecution
testimony by former New Jersey Republican leader
Harry Sears, who said he went to the SEC proposing
that it limit its investigation into the $200,000 cash
contribution from financier Robert L. Vesco.
In return for the donation, the government
charges, Mitchell and Stans sought to impede the
SEC investigation of Vesco's financial empire. They
are charged with conspiracy, obstruction of justice

and perjury.
Sears, who left the New Jersey Legislature to
become a $60,000 Vesco legal aide, has described
himself as the financier's go-between in enlisting the
aid of Mitchell, the former attorney general, and
Stans, one-time secretary of commerce.
Moretti Slops Pamphlets
LOS ANGELES — A temporary restraining order
was issued yesterday against Secretary of State
Edmund G. Brown Jr. by a Los Angeles judge to
halt distribution of 9.5 million official voter
pamphlets.
Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti, who is
campaigning against Brown for the Democratic
nomination for governor, filed suit with Superior
Court Judge David A. Thomas to stop distribution
of the booklets. The judge ordered the distribution
halt until a hearing Thursday.
The pamphlets contain a letter from Brown, who
is California's chief elections officer, which Moretti
described as a self-congratulatory "love letter to
voters" intended to influence the gubernatorial race.
SLA Silence Called 'Bad Omen'
SAN FRANCISCO — Attorney Vincent Hallinan
said yesterday he thinks it "a rather bad omen" that
the Symbionese Liberation Army has remained
silent since he voiced fears last week that they
already have killed Patricia Hearst.
"The longer it goes, the more I fear that she is
dead," Hallinan said when asked if he still thought
the 20-year-old newspaper heiress might be dead at
the hands of her terrorist captors.
Hallinan, a well-known radical lawyer and one of
three trustees for a $4 million food giveaway
promised on Patricia Hearst's safe release, said he's
still the best person to negotiate with the SLA for a
meeting between the girl and her family.
Jury Still Out In Chino Case
LOS ANGELES — A third day of jury
deliberations was concluded yesterday with still no
verdict in the murder trial of two Palo Alto
residents accused of killing a Chino prison guard.
On trial are Jean Hobson, 45, and her 22-year-old
next-door neighbor, Robert Seabock. Both have
pleaded innocent.
Guard Jesus Sanchez, 24, was killed in an
ambush of a prison car on Oct. 6, 1972. Convict
Ronald Beaty, 35, escaped in the ambush but was
later recaptured and turned state's evidence.
Beaty, himself sentenced to life in prison on his
guilty plea in the shooting, testified that Seabock
fired the fatal shots and that Hobson aided his
flight.
The defense produced witnesses who said
Hobson was shopping and Seabock was home ill at
the time of the escape — and also 400 miles away
from the scene.
