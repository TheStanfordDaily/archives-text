# Smyth Calls For Debate
## 
### 
Bruch Smyth, candidate for ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP), challenged
representitives of the 800 Bacon and
Mike Herman slates to a debate
yesterday. The future of the event is
uncertain after members of those
slates either rejected or had no
comment on the proposal.
Smyth issued the challenge just two
days before the COP primaries
tomorrow and Thursday.
Quinn Mayer of the Herman ticket
which includes Ann Carter and Len
Mackey said that his group rejected
the challenge because of the short
notice given and the large number of
slates he thought would have to
participate in the debate to make it
fair.
Smyth had proposed that three of
the COP slates be excluded from the
debate because "there were really only

three serious contenders to make it
past the primaries."
Members of the Bacon ticket
including Chris Baron, Maria Echaveste
and Jack Handy were unable to
contact each other to reach a decision
on the debate. Handy said that he was
surprised by a debate challenge given
so close to the election date.
Smyth said if the debate occurs, he
would like to discuss proposals by
both the Herman and Bacon slates,
and the role that the ASSU Senate
should take in dealing with money
appropiations for "special interest
groups" like the organizers of the
Women's Day Fair. Smyth said ASSU
money should be spent in the general
interest of the whole student body.
The members of Smyth's slate are
Rick Delbecarro, Rick Chavez, and Liz
Kincannon.
