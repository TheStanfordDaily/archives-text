# Former Swedish Ambassador
## Edelstam Describes Chile Junta 
### DAVID SMITH 
"Today the working people of
Chile are silent and defeated under the
terrible junta which is breaking all the
rules of human rights," stated former
Swedish Ambassador to Chile Harold
Edelstam before a large crowd in
Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Edelstam told of his efforts to
harbor political prisoners in the
Swedish and Cuban missions in
Santiago during last year's Chilean
coup. He cited many incidents of
executions and torture of leftists by
the present military government.
In a surprise appearance, folksinger
Joan Baez introduced Edelstam and
sang "Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn
Me Around" and two Chilean songs.
Baez said she had "worked night and
day" to aid Chilean political prisoners.
Edelstam, expelled from Chile by
the military junta, offered strong
praise for ousted President Salvador
Allende. "By sacrificing himself,
Allende called the attention of the
world to Chile, where it has stayed.
This world attention has helped Chile's
oppressed people enormously," he
said.
'Fatal Mistake'
"It was Allende's fatal mistake that
he trusted the oaths of loyalty from
the military and did not arm the
workers," added the ambassador. "The
workers were caught unaware by the
soldiers' betrayal. If the people had

been armed, there would have been
civilian resistance that might have
saved the democracy."
Edelstam read part of the text of
Allende's last broadcast message to the
crowd. In the message, the former
president praised the working classes
and urged them to defend the factories
from the junta.
The ambassador described his own
efforts to harbor political enemies of
the new regime. "I learned that there
were 7000 political prisoners in the
football stadium; then some came to

me asking for protection. I read that
under the Geneva convention articles
we could give refuge in an embassy, so
I took them in without the official
sanction of my government.
Followed His Conscience
"I was very disappointed with my
fellow ambassadors from Europe, who
were very slow to accept refugees.
Many lives would have been saved if
they had acted sooner. I suppose they
followed the instruction book, while I
followed my conscience."
Edelstam said he had harbored 400
refugees in his embassy and in the
Cuban mission, which he supervised
after the Cuban delegation was
expelled by the junta.
Among the brutalities which the
ambassador attributed to the military
regime was the mistreatment of Nobel
Laureate poet Pablo Neruda in an
incident which the ambassador
claimed hastened Neruda's death.
Edelstam also cited the army's
massacre of 300 university students
and the killing of songwriter Victor
Chara.
"They cut off his fingers and told
him, 'now play the guitar,'" said
Edelstam. "When he sang his songs,
they beat him to death."
The ambassador added, "There may
yet be hope for democracy in Chile.
The Allende government at least gave
the people a political conscience, and
that they can never completely lose."
