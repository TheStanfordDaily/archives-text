# Deadlocked C-15 Adjourns Suddenly
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
The group charged with the task of
studying judicial reform, the
Committee of 15 (C-15) unexpectedly
adjourned, apparently for the year,
last Thursday after only its second
meeting. The group accomplished
almost nothing in its efforts to suggest
possible reforms.
According to C-15 member Asst.
Prof, of Political Science Jonathan
Casper, the committee was confronted
by student members seeking to revive
the C-15 proposal which was
overwhelmingly defeated last October.
However, he noted that such changes
would not be approved by faculty or
administration members of the
committee.
The October proposal called for the
creation of a Student Judicial Panel
(SJC) consisting of four student
members to be selected at random
from the student body, three faculty
members chosen by the Faculty
Senate Committee on Committees,
and a representative of the
administration. One student member
of the panel could be removed by vote
of the Faculty Senate, the ASSU
Senate or by order of President
Lyman.

Casper said that the major issues
before the committee concerned the
student majority on the proposed SJC
and the selection procedures of faculty
and student members.
Not An Issue
Casper stated that- the CJP-SJC
debate "really won't be an issue again
until students want it to be so.
However, this may change after the
upcoming ASSU elections or retiring
C-15 members are replaced," he
concluded.
University President Richard
Lyman observed, "Students were being
over-optimistic about getting new
proposals at this time. Their chances
were shot down by not starting sooner

than they have."
Lyman noted that "spring quarter
is just too late to work out any new
proposals." He remarked that last
year's proposal took about a year to
complete.
Lyman said he foresees no new
meetings of the C-15 and no
possibility for resubmission of the
October proposal at this time.
Another C-15 member, Business
Prof. Harold Levitt, expressed
"sadness" over the adjournment. He
added, "There is no way of working
out new proposals nor do I see any
new proposals being submitted."
Levitt explained that he was glad
that "creative options" (such as calling
new meetings) were left open to C-15
members. The failure of the original
C-15 proposal was "no fault of anyone
really," he said. Levitt also was
pessimistic about the liklehood of
resubmitting the October proposal.
"What is really needed," added
Levitt, "is for students to put forward
new proposals because the faculty and
administration probably won't put
forward anything new."
Former C-15 member, Law Prof.
John Friedenthal said there is enough
legitimacy for the CJP to continue to
operate. "I think that any real
opportunity for judicial reform is gone
now," he commented.
Preliminary Work
