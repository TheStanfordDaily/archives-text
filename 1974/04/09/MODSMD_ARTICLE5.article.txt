# Weicker's Testimony Reveals IRS Abuse
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House made a total effort, dating from
the first days of the Nixon
administration to use the Internal
Revenue Service and other federal
agencies to control its political and
ideological opponents, Sen. Lowell P.
Weicker said yesterday.
Weicker, R-Conn., made public a
flood of memos which he said showed
the systematic abuse of the IRS,
starting with the creation in 1969 of a
secret task force to collect tax
information on so-called activist
groups.
Using another set of documents
given the Senate Watergate
Committee, Weicker detailed what he
said were 54 separate undercover
investigations conducted for the White
House by retired New York City
detective Anthony T. Ulasewicz.
They included three separate and
unsuccessful attempts to link Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., to "wild
parties" in California, Hawaii, and
Arizona.
Nixon's Friends
Testifying before a joint session of
three Senate subcommittees
investigating the extent of covert
government intelligence operations,
Weicker produced documents
indicating the White House had a
strong interest in the tax problems
encountered by presidential friends,
evangelist Billy Graham and actor
John Wayne.
Wayne has sent a telegram to
Weicker saying he never asked for or
received IRA favors.
Weicker advised Wayne in a
telegram to take his complaints to the
White House and said he was sending
the actor the memos in which White
House aides John W. Dean 111 and
John Caulfield discussed his tax
difficulties.
Weicker produced what he said was
an IRS memo that showed that
Ronald Reagan, now California's
Republican governor, was assessed
$13,091 in taxes owed for the years
1962 through 1965.
Specific comparison tax audit
information also was supplied the
White House on entertainers Frank

Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Fred
Mac Murray, Peter Lawford, Jerry
Lewis, Richard Boone, and on Lucille
Ball and her husband, Gary Morton,
the memos showed.
Weicker said the IRS memo on the
formation of the special intelligence
task force discussed various means by
which the tax laws could be used to
attack what it described variously as
activist, ideological, radical, militant,
or subversive groups.
The memo, signed by D. O. Virdin,
added: "We do not want the news
media to be alerted to what we are
attempting to do or how we are
operating because disclosure of such
information might embarrass the
administration ..."
