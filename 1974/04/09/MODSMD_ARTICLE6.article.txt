# Move Over Babe Ruth-- Aaron Slams Homer 715
## 
### 
ATLANTA (AP) — Hank Aaron
broke Babe Ruth's home run record
last night, hitting No. 715 in the
fourth inning of a game between the
Atlanta Braves and Los Angeles
Dodgers.
The peerless Brave hit the second
pitch from Dodger hurler A 1 Downing.
Aaron had walked in his first trip to
the plate.
Aaron hit the pitch out over the
left field fence into the Braves'
bullpen, where Atlanta relief pitcher
Tom House retrieved the ball and gave
it back to Aaron.
Aaron had one ball on him when he
connected for the historic home run,
which cleared the fence just right of
the 385-foot marker before an
overflow hometown crowd in the
52,870 seat stadium.
After Aaron touched home plate,
teammates lifted him and carried him
a few steps before the slugger broke
away and trotted to a special box
adjacent to the Atlanta dugout where
he embraced his wife, Billye, and his
parents, the Herbert Aarons of Mobile,
Ala.
Soon after the 40-year-old slugger

hit the homer, President Nixon
phoned his congratulations. Aaron was
in left field when the call came
through but talked to the President
between innings.
Aaron's chase for the record many
thought unbreakable was surrounded
by controversy in which Baseball
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn had
intervened twice.
First Kuhn directed Atlanta to play
Aaron in two of the three opening
road games at Cincinnati. Then after
the slugger had tied the record
Thursday with No. 714, he ordered
the Braves to play Aaron in the final
road game Sunday.
The legendary Ruth played for 22
seasons, got into 2, 503 games and had
8,399 at bats in hitting 714 home
runs. The softspoken Aaron is in his
21st season, and the record-breaker
came on his 11, 295 th at bat in his 2,
967 th game.
The home run also brought Aaron
across the plate for the 2,064 th time
in his career, a National League record
and two runs ahead of Willie Mays in
third place on the all-time run list for
both leagues. Aaron also scored in the
first inning after he had walked.
