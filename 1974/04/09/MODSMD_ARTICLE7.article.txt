## ASSU Proposals 
### 
' Besides the primary election for Council of Presidents,
Ithis week's ASSU ballot will also contain three
.constitutional amendments and the ASSU Program Fee
•assessment. Our recommendations:
I SENATE ELECTIONS
The Daily recommends a NO vote on the constitutional
amendment moving the ASSU Senate elections from the
;autumn to spring quarter. By making such a change, the
•ASSU would effectively disenfranchise an entire class — the
freshmen — while allowing another class with no
; stake in the voting — the outgoing seniors — to have a hand
,in the election. Freshmen are already excluded from the
!Council of Presidents selection; this amendment would only
".serve to make the student government even less responsive
* to the composition of the student body than it already is.
■ In addition, holding the Senate elections at the sametime
■as the Council of Presidents would increase confusion by
I having students campaigning for 24 open positions —
; Council of Presidents and Senate — instead of just the COP.
; Holding the elections in the fall makes it harder for a Senate
, candidate — he must make a greater effort to meet and
" campaign with new voters — but frankly, we think that's a
' good thing: it keeps candidates a bit more in touch with the
'-student body.
As the system now stands, the Senate provides a check on
the COP, making it more difficult for the Council to
manipulate the Senate to the Council's own ends. We think
this vital check on the Council's power ought to be
preserved.
NOMINATIONS COMMISSION REMOVAL
The Daily also recommends a NO vote on the amendment
to establish a procedure to remove members of the
Nominations Committee. While we are not necessarily
opposed to some process for getting rid of a member who
fails to perform his job, we do not like the idea of giving
other board members the decision of removing one of their
number. Surely some other body — perhaps the Senate —
should wield that authority.
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DATE
We recommend a YES vote on the measure to make the
ASSU presidential elections the third and fourth week —
rather than the current second and third — in April. This will
allow more time for preparation for the election and for
discussion of the issues.
This amendment will also allow a six-day extension of the
period between the receipt of a petition-proposed
constitutional amendment and the election itself.
PROGRAM FEE ASSESSMENT
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the $1 per quarter,
two-quarter Program Fee. Some may quarrel with individual
allotments, the fact remains that the Program Fee as a whole
is worthwhile; it provides funding to over 40 campus
organizations that are not seeking enough money to justify
separate fee assessments of their own.
The Program Fee assessment is refundable.
