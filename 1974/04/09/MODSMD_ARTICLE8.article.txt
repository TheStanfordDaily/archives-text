# On Program Fee

This year's ASSU Program Fee
will appear on the ballot
Wednesday and Thursday, along
with the presidential primary. Due
to space limitations the entire
proposal can not be reprinted here
but copies can be gotten from the
ASSU office, and the entire
proposal will appear on the ballot.
I would like to highlight some of
the larger allocations in the
assessment.
The Program Fee is broader
this year than last with a total of
41 groups receiving funds. The
two largest allocations, the BSU
and the Tresidder Program Board,
represent only 18 percent of the
total. In the past the largest
groups have often gotten a greater
percentage than that, sometimes
as high as 35 percent.
Academic groups, including the
Course Review, got a larger share
this year of about $2500. The
ethnic/minority groups' share
remained stable at about one-third
of the total assessment. This
includes groups such as the BSU,
Jewish Students and many others.
Fund Decrease
Four publications received
funds averaging $600. This
represents a decrease from last
year when twice as many
publications applied for funding
and got a larger share as a result.

Among the remaining groups
which have widely varying
purposes, Project Synergy, the
Escondido Village Nursery,
Volunteers in Asia, and the Bridge
all got about $700.
Other groups receiving smaller
amounts ($lOO-200) were Alpha
Phi Omega, Stanford Conservation
Group, SCOPE, Lagunita
Ceramics Workshop and the
Farmworker's support committee.
No one group could get a fee
assessment by itself, but when put
together in a budget that averages
a $450 allotment these groups
have a chance to be funded at an
appropriate level. No student is
expected to like or participate in
all the different activities, but the
ones he likes will now get some
funding.
How many of you will use the
Women's Center, or read the
Sequoia or Stanford Review, or
attend programs put on by the
Tresidder Board? The impact of
this voluntary fee assessment is far
greater than that of the KZSU or
the Band. Support the Program
Fee so that small but diverse
groups can work on more than a
shoe string and be able to open up
to the entire community.
