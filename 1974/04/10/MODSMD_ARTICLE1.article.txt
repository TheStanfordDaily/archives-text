# Theme House Move Handling Defended
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton last night defended his
office's handling of the black theme
house move from Roble to
Olivo-Magnolia in the Lagunita
complex, blaming many of the
problems on the "time frame."
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference Horton admitted that he
did not confer with Olivo-Magnolia
residents before the decision to move
the house was made, but attributed
the lack of student consultation to
time pressures.
He explained that the final decision
was not reached until shortly before
he announced the move last
Tuesday.
He added that he did not want to
"alarm" Lagunita residents
unnecessarily by presenting them with
"half-baked proposals," especially
when it appeared earlier that week
that there was a good possibility the
program might not be moved there.
'Factors'
"There were a lot of factors that
had to fall into place, and we didn't
know if we could get all sides to agree
on the location," he said. "We weren't

even sure if the program would be in
Eucalypto-Granada or Olivo-Magnolia
until Tuesday.
"The possibility of a Lagunita
option didn't even arise until Thursday
of finals week [last quarter]. So we're
talking about roughly a 13- to 14-day
period."
Horton said he called a meeting last
Monday night with Lagunita Court
resident fellows and residence staff to
discuss the possibility of the theme
house move. At that meeting Horton
and the Lagunita staff made the
decision not to inform student
residents.
"I thought it would be wise for
people not to start rumors. They
probably would have raised spectres
far worse than the actuality," Horton
replied after the broadcast last night.
Nothing Coherent
Olivo-Magnolia Resident Fellow
Martin Bresnick echoed Horton's
sentiment. "We didn't have anything
coherent until Tuesday afternoon and
we didn't want to spread rumors," he
told the Daily.
Horton also said he was not
attempting to keep details of the move
"secret" from Lagunita residents. He
added that the arguments he has heard
from Olivo-Magnolia residents since
the decision was made public were
"thoroughly considered" during the
decision-making.
Horton also reaffirmed his stand in
yesterday's Daily article saying that
black students submitted the proposal
for a new "Black Cultural Center" as a
"non-negotiable package." He recalled
that he had "brisk exchanges" with
ASSU Vice President Charles Ogletree
over the proposal during their meeting.
Horton questioned the article for
its reference to "carpets, singles and
sinks" as the "bread and butter
considerations" which may have
singled out Lagunita as the location of
the black theme house.
"There may have been some
trade-off," but black students felt
strongly about placing the house back
in Wilbur, he said. "Wilbur was my
first choice." Anti-Wilbur sentiment
stemmed from black students'
experiences three years ago when the
black theme program occupied Cedro,
Junipero and Soto houses there,
according to Horton.
