# On Political Power Of Labor Unions
## 
### 
Tim Ferguson

As an addendum to Bill Evers' column on
public financing of political campaigns
(Daily, April 4), I might suggest that the true
beneficiaries of legislation of this type
currently before Congress would be the
hierarchies of the nation's powerful labor
unions.
These labor bosses would possess a
singular advantage in the wake of passage of
such legislation: they alone hold the means
of providing large-scale aid to their political
cronies in a way not prohibited by presently
proposed "rigid" campaign finance laws.
Labor's means, as detailed in a January 20
article in the Wall Street Journal, are known
as "indirect aid." On the surface, such aid is
the expenditure of compulsory union dues
not for "contributions" to candidates in
Federal elections (prohibited by current
federal law), but for "educational" projects
for the union's members.
Education = Subterfuge
In actuality, such "education" is
subterfuge. Often the projects are
thinly-veiled manuevers not just to foist the
views of the desired candidate upon the
union members themselves, but upon the
general public as well.
Though carried on by such groups as the
Machinists Non-Partisan Political League,
these union projects have been found by the

Journal to be "almost invariably" supportive
of Democrats. The list of names mentioned is
a virtual Who's Who of donkey party politics.
The sanctimonious cries over Watergate
and ITT might lose some of their shrillness
given public knowledge of the campaign
backgrounds of some of those who originated
them.
The union groups donate "indirect aid"
by way of assigning paid staff members to
candidates' campaigns, allowing use of union
computers, and mobilization of
"non-partisan" get-out-the-vote drives, the
Journal says.
'Educational' Guise
Labor leaders use the guise of
"educational services" to direct hard-core
partisan politicking directed at the union
members. Such tactics are permitted by
federal law. What may be of more nebulous
legality is the use of this "education" money
to buy the flight tickets home of incumbent
candidates so that they might "speak to a
union group" or, better yet, "consult with
union leadership."
In fact, an investigation of the Machinists
group's activities disclosed a union memo to
Sen. Ralph Yarborough, D—'Tex., asking the
then-senator to rationalize the union's
donation of travel funds by sending a letter
for the union's file indicating that
Yarborough would be home to consult with

labor leaders.
Labor aid doesn't end there.
"Non-partisan" registration efforts are often
preceded by "bird dogs" who survey the area
involved to determine strong spots for the
favored (usually Democratic) candidate. A
union-sponsored "appreciation dinner" for
him might amount to little more than a
fund-raising meal. The union buys all the
tickets.
Both Corrupt
So the political gravy train runs in both
directions, the difference being that the aid
often given Republicans by business is direct
and easy prey for campaign finance laws,
while that provided the Democrats by labor
is less discernable. The end result in both
cases is often equally undesirable, however:
bought politicians.
We might consider then what the real
effect would be of public-financing of
campaigns and the subsequent lowering or
banning of individual "contributions"
(direct).
Would it be to free our governmental
officials of undue influences, or rathe, as the
Journal says, "to leave labor in a better
position relative to business than it is now"?
If the latter, what we will do by these laws
is not clean up politics, but merely reshovel
the dirt.

preceded by "bird dogs" who survey the area
involved to determine strong spots for the
favored (usually Democratic) candidate. A
union-sponsored "appreciation dinner" for
him might amount to little more than a
fund-raising meal. The union buys all the
tickets.
Both Corrupt
So the political gravy train runs in both
directions, the difference being that the aid
often given Republicans by business is direct
and easy prey for campaign finance laws,
while that provided the Democrats by labor
is less discernable. The end result in both
cases is often equally undesirable, however:
bought politicians.
We might consider then what the real
effect would be of public-financing of
campaigns and the subsequent lowering or
banning of individual "contributions"
(direct).
Would it be to free our governmental
officials of undue influences, or rathe, as the
Journal says, "to leave labor in a better
position relative to business than it is now"?
If the latter, what we will do by these laws
is not clean up politics, but merely reshovel
the dirt.

As an addendum to Bill Evers' column on
public financing of political campaigns
(Daily, April 4), I might suggest that the true
beneficiaries of legislation of this type
currently before Congress would be the
hierarchies of the nation's powerful labor
unions.
These labor bosses would possess a
singular advantage in the wake of passage of
such legislation: they alone hold the means
of providing large-scale aid to their political
cronies in a way not prohibited by presently
proposed "rigid" campaign finance laws.
Labor's means, as detailed in a January 20
article in the Wall Street Journal, are known
as "indirect aid." On the surface, such aid is
the expenditure of compulsory union dues
not for "contributions" to candidates in
Federal elections (prohibited by current
federal law), but for "educational" projects
for the union's members.
Education = Subterfuge
In actuality, such "education" is
subterfuge. Often the projects are
thinly-veiled manuevers not just to foist the
views of the desired candidate upon the
union members themselves, but upon the
general public as well.
Though carried on by such groups as the
Machinists Non-Partisan Political League,
these union projects have been found by the

Journal to be "almost invariably" supportive
of Democrats. The list of names mentioned is
a virtual Who's Who of donkey party politics.
The sanctimonious cries over Watergate
and ITT might lose some of their shrillness
given public knowledge of the campaign
backgrounds of some of those who originated
them.
The union groups donate "indirect aid"
by way of assigning paid staff members to
candidates' campaigns, allowing use of union
computers, and mobilization of
"non-partisan" get-out-the-vote drives, the
Journal says.
'Educational' Guise
Labor leaders use the guise of
"educational services" to direct hard-core
partisan politicking directed at the union
members. Such tactics are permitted by
federal law. What may be of more nebulous
legality is the use of this "education" money
to buy the flight tickets home of incumbent
candidates so that they might "speak to a
union group" or, better yet, "consult with
union leadership."
In fact, an investigation of the Machinists
group's activities disclosed a union memo to
Sen. Ralph Yarborough, D—'Tex., asking the
then-senator to rationalize the union's
donation of travel funds by sending a letter
for the union's file indicating that
Yarborough would be home to consult with

labor leaders.
Labor aid doesn't end there.
