# Richard Nixon For Ex-President
## 
###

In focusing upon the
scandalous dealings of the present
administration, the Daily has
deviously hidden from its readers
a political problem of more
far-reaching import.
In light (though admitedly
subdued light) of the many recent
shortages which have befallen this
damn nation, none is more serious
than the shortage of ex-presidents.
At the present time we have none.
Ex-presidents are a necessity
for this country. As elder
statesmen they are a vital source
of unsolicited advice for our
nation's leaders. They provide the
calm voice of experience in times
of national crisis. More
importantly they allow themselves
to be exploited by any and all
candidates for public office.
For many years we have been
lulled to complacency by the
many fine men who have served as
ex-presidents. This has led to the
wanton depletion of the supply of
these exhausted men â€” or the
exhaustion of the supply of these
depleted men (if you please).
Phenomenal Death
This trend started with the
phenomenal death of a man who
served as ex-president in full
capacity for a longer, more
honorable time than any man in
history, none other than
Stanford's most famous alumnus,
Herbert Hoover. His death created
a serious void in the office of the
ex-presidency, a phenomenon
known as "The Hoover Vacuum."
Others soon sucked into this
catatonic vacuum were Dwight D.
Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman.
However, we cannot go so far as
to blame the venerable Hoover for
the behavior of Lyndon Baines
Johnson which brought disgrace
to the office of the ex-president.
This irresponsible man reveled
in the glory of being the nation's
only ex-president for less than one
month before he thoughtlessly
kicked off, an act which
plummeted the nation into the
crisis of ex-leadership that we still
face.
Most Exclusive Office
The office of the ex-president

is the most exclusive office in the
world. The members of this group
are drawn only from those who
have been elected to the nation's
highest office.
However, not all Presidents are
capable of becoming
ex-presidents. As a matter of fact,
some of the best Presidents in
U.S. history, men such as
Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D.
Roosevelt, have not contributed
one iota to the office of the
ex-presidency.

Inversely, the worst President
in our history (until the present),
none other than Stanford's most
extinguished alumnus, was by far
the most outstanding ex-president
we have ever had.
Best Qualified
Therefore, we can think of no
one better qualified to be
ex-president than Richard M.
Nixon. Although Nixon fears that
his resignation would ruin the
presidency, he is perpetrating a
more heinous crime by remaining

in office.
In order to prompt the
President's departure into the
only beneficial act of service in his
career, we urge the Congress to
give him the two-thirds vote of
confidence necessary to confer
the title of "Ex-President"upon
him.
