Campaign Financing
Editor:
Bill Evers' attack on public
financing of campaigns in his
April 4 column is off the point
and without foundation.
Few, if any constitutional
lawyers find any problem under
the First Amendment with the
establishment of reasonable
ceilings on campaign spending or
with public financing itself.
For example, the Federal
Campaign Control Act of 1972
places ceilings on how much a
candidate himself can put into his
own campaign and no
constitutional doubt ever clouded
its validity. Moreover, its
prevention of wealthy people
from buying public office is a
desirable objective.
Far from perpetuating existing
party structures, the right kind of
public financing will make it
possible for both independents
and new parties to qualify for the
ballot and to be heard.
Moreover, reforms which I
support, including public
financing, will close precisely the
loopholes which Evers refers to
involving donations of personnel,
equipment and facilities, all of
which is now done with no
control at all, and would so
continue if Evers' opposition
prevailed.
I think it is time that we

stopped big interests from buying
elections and big government
from shaking down small
interests. Only substantial public
financing of campaigns will do
this.

Flores Tenure Denial
Editor:
We the undersigned students
protest the decision of the Dean's
Office to deny tenure to John
Flores. We rannot accept as
satisfactory the reason stated in
the letter of notification nor those
given in subsequent conversations.
The assertion that "Mr. Flores'
scholarly work to date does not
indicate that he will be a scholar
of the level we expect for a
tenured member of the School's
Faculty" is not a sufficient,
acceptable explanation because
we have experienced Flores'
scholarship firsthand, in the
classroom, and find it entirely
commensurate with that of
tenured faculty.
In seminars particularly, we
have sensed the development of a
sophisticated and complex theory
of literature, and we are genuinely
excited by the results of our work
under John's guidance.
We protest the denial of tenure
on other grounds. In taking this

action, the Appointments and
Promotions Committee as well as
the Dean's Office have decided to
override the German Studies
Departmental recommendation
for tenure and, in so doing, they
question the Department's ability
to evaluate the worth of German
scholarship.
Both administrative offices
have determined that their criteria
for judgment supercede those of
the German Studies Department.
Furthermore, internationally
recognized scholars in the field of
German letters have attested to
the excellence of Flores'
scholarship, in recommendations
of the highest praise.
In addition he is the only
scholar in the German Studies
Department at Stanford (and one
of the few in the nation) qualified
to teach and research East
German literature and thought. As
such, the courses taught by Flores
comprise a vital part of our
curriculum. It is our firm desire
that John Flores be retained at
Stanford.
If the Dean's Office and the
A&P Committee refuse our
appeal, we demand an explanation
of the tnje reasons for denying
tenure to John Flores.
We the undersigned agree with
the content of this letter and hope
it will be acted on with justice and
due immediacy:

acceptable explanation because
we have experienced Flores'
scholarship firsthand, in the
classroom, and find it entirely
commensurate with that of
tenured faculty.
In seminars particularly, we
have sensed the development of a
sophisticated and complex theory
of literature, and we are genuinely
excited by the results of our work
under John's guidance.
We protest the denial of tenure
on other grounds. In taking this

action, the Appointments and
Promotions Committee as well as
the Dean's Office have decided to
override the German Studies
Departmental recommendation
for tenure and, in so doing, they
question the Department's ability
to evaluate the worth of German
scholarship.
Both administrative offices
have determined that their criteria
for judgment supercede those of
the German Studies Department.
Furthermore, internationally
recognized scholars in the field of
German letters have attested to
the excellence of Flores'
scholarship, in recommendations
of the highest praise.
In addition he is the only
scholar in the German Studies
Department at Stanford (and one
of the few in the nation) qualified
to teach and research East
German literature and thought. As
such, the courses taught by Flores
comprise a vital part of our
curriculum. It is our firm desire
that John Flores be retained at
Stanford.
If the Dean's Office and the
A&P Committee refuse our
appeal, we demand an explanation
of the tnje reasons for denying
tenure to John Flores.
We the undersigned agree with
the content of this letter and hope
it will be acted on with justice and

Campaign Financing
Editor:
Bill Evers' attack on public
financing of campaigns in his
April 4 column is off the point
and without foundation.
Few, if any constitutional
lawyers find any problem under
the First Amendment with the
establishment of reasonable
ceilings on campaign spending or
with public financing itself.
For example, the Federal
Campaign Control Act of 1972
places ceilings on how much a
candidate himself can put into his
own campaign and no
constitutional doubt ever clouded
its validity. Moreover, its
prevention of wealthy people
from buying public office is a
desirable objective.
Far from perpetuating existing
party structures, the right kind of
public financing will make it
possible for both independents
and new parties to qualify for the
ballot and to be heard.
Moreover, reforms which I
support, including public
financing, will close precisely the
loopholes which Evers refers to
involving donations of personnel,
equipment and facilities, all of
which is now done with no
control at all, and would so
continue if Evers' opposition
prevailed.
I think it is time that we

stopped big interests from buying
elections and big government
from shaking down small
interests. Only substantial public
financing of campaigns will do
this.

Flores Tenure Denial
Editor:
We the undersigned students
protest the decision of the Dean's
Office to deny tenure to John
Flores. We rannot accept as
satisfactory the reason stated in
the letter of notification nor those
given in subsequent conversations.
The assertion that "Mr. Flores'
scholarly work to date does not
indicate that he will be a scholar
of the level we expect for a
tenured member of the School's
Faculty" is not a sufficient,
acceptable explanation because
we have experienced Flores'
