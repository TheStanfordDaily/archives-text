# African Famine

A famine is not usually a front
page item for any newspaper. Like
the phrase "population
explosion," the word famine
implies something dramatic and
attention-getting.
For this reason I think that we
are unconsciously still waiting for
the population explosion and
accompanying famines to happen,
to hit the headlines in a wave of
disaster. But like the population
explosion, the food crisis that was
predicted for this decade is
already here and now.
Undernourishment and
malnutrition, the diseases that
result from famine, are very slow
killers. They weaken the body and
sap the mental and physical
energy of the victim. Their main
characteristic is not sudden and
dramatic death but simply an
increasing lethargy.
A famine is therefore a slow
and silent disaster, a decline that
occurs quietly and insidiously. In
this sense a famine does not
'happen' at all. It is not difficult
to understand how it can go
unnoticed.
Sahel Famine
The famine that now exists in
the Sahel, the area of West Africa
just south of the Sahara
comprising Senegal, Mauritania,
Mali, Upper Volta, Niger and
Chad, is of enough magnitude to
have leaked out onto the front
pages of a few newspapers. It and
the food shortage that exists all
around the world today should be
the subject of a great deal more
discussion and press coverage as
well as planning and activity.
The causes of the famine in the
Sahel are complicated. A
combination of a six year drought
and overgrazing of the
sub-Saharan savana lands (brought
on at least partly by
overpopulation) seems to be
causing the southward advance of
the desert into areas inhabited
mostly by nomadic herdsmen.
The drought, which according
to Newsweek is the worst in 60
years, has caused the death of
large numbers of livestock, a drop
in crop production and hence
widespread famine. In many
places people have been driven to
eat leaves and bark, to break into
anthills for grain or to eat the seed
grains kept for next year's
planting.
Extent Unknown
It is not known how many
people are affected by the
drought simply because no one
knows how many people live in
the Sahel. An article in the New
York Times of Feb. 24 estimated
that 13 million people face
starvation. Other estimates are
lower but still top one million.
The extent of the famine was
not even suspected until a little
more than a year ago when
nomads and farmers began to
arrive in settled areas searching for
water and food. The combination
of a drastic ecological change in
the sub-Saharan lands and severe
drought has made much of the
land useless and so the people are
now forced to move into more
populated areas which in turn
cannot support them.
It was expected last year that
there would be sufficient summer
rains for an improved crop which
would at least provide a
breathing-spell in the crisis. But
the rains did not come as hoped.
The problem grows worse. Where
last year the livestock perished,
this year the people are left to die.
Substantial Relief
There was a substantial relief
effort last year of over $120
million in aid provided by several
countries, including the United
States. Because the drought
continues unabated there will
have to be, at the very least, a
relief effort of the same
proportions this year. However,
much more than that is needed.
The leaders of the six nations
of the Sahel and U.N. Secretary
General Kurt Waldheim have
proposed a "Marshall Plan" of aid
to the area costing over $850
million. Only a huge effort to
restore the land of the Sahel and
implement new farming methods
and to get at the causes of famine
in othei ways, including birth
control, will save the Sahel from
more and more misery and
hunger.
Right now the probelm is to
hold back starvation and
malnutrition. But we cannot keep
the people of the Sahel alive
without also committing ourselves
to an attack on the causes of the
tragedy. The food shortage in
Africa and elsewhere should be
one of the most newsworthy and
talked-about items around.

that 13 million people face
starvation. Other estimates are
lower but still top one million.
The extent of the famine was
not even suspected until a little
more than a year ago when
nomads and farmers began to
arrive in settled areas searching for
water and food. The combination
of a drastic ecological change in
the sub-Saharan lands and severe
drought has made much of the
land useless and so the people are
now forced to move into more
populated areas which in turn
cannot support them.
It was expected last year that
there would be sufficient summer
rains for an improved crop which
would at least provide a
breathing-spell in the crisis. But
the rains did not come as hoped.
The problem grows worse. Where
last year the livestock perished,
this year the people are left to die.
Substantial Relief
There was a substantial relief
effort last year of over $120
million in aid provided by several
countries, including the United
States. Because the drought
continues unabated there will
have to be, at the very least, a
relief effort of the same
proportions this year. However,
much more than that is needed.
The leaders of the six nations
of the Sahel and U.N. Secretary
General Kurt Waldheim have
proposed a "Marshall Plan" of aid
to the area costing over $850
million. Only a huge effort to
restore the land of the Sahel and
implement new farming methods
and to get at the causes of famine
in othei ways, including birth
control, will save the Sahel from
more and more misery and
hunger.
Right now the probelm is to
hold back starvation and
malnutrition. But we cannot keep
the people of the Sahel alive
without also committing ourselves
to an attack on the causes of the
tragedy. The food shortage in
Africa and elsewhere should be
one of the most newsworthy and
talked-about items around.

A famine is not usually a front
page item for any newspaper. Like
the phrase "population
explosion," the word famine
implies something dramatic and
attention-getting.
For this reason I think that we
are unconsciously still waiting for
the population explosion and
accompanying famines to happen,
to hit the headlines in a wave of
disaster. But like the population
explosion, the food crisis that was
predicted for this decade is
already here and now.
Undernourishment and
malnutrition, the diseases that
result from famine, are very slow
killers. They weaken the body and
sap the mental and physical
energy of the victim. Their main
characteristic is not sudden and
dramatic death but simply an
increasing lethargy.
A famine is therefore a slow
and silent disaster, a decline that
occurs quietly and insidiously. In
this sense a famine does not
'happen' at all. It is not difficult
to understand how it can go
unnoticed.
Sahel Famine
The famine that now exists in
the Sahel, the area of West Africa
just south of the Sahara
comprising Senegal, Mauritania,
Mali, Upper Volta, Niger and
Chad, is of enough magnitude to
have leaked out onto the front
pages of a few newspapers. It and
the food shortage that exists all
around the world today should be
the subject of a great deal more
discussion and press coverage as
well as planning and activity.
The causes of the famine in the
Sahel are complicated. A
combination of a six year drought
and overgrazing of the
sub-Saharan savana lands (brought
on at least partly by
overpopulation) seems to be
causing the southward advance of
the desert into areas inhabited
mostly by nomadic herdsmen.
The drought, which according
to Newsweek is the worst in 60
years, has caused the death of
large numbers of livestock, a drop
in crop production and hence
widespread famine. In many
places people have been driven to
eat leaves and bark, to break into
anthills for grain or to eat the seed
grains kept for next year's
planting.
Extent Unknown
It is not known how many
people are affected by the
drought simply because no one
knows how many people live in
the Sahel. An article in the New
York Times of Feb. 24 estimated
that 13 million people face
starvation. Other estimates are
