Dr. Norman E. Shumway,
noted heart transplant pioneer,
has been appointed professor and
chairman of the new Department
of Cardiovascular Surgery at
Stanford University School of
Medicine.
Shumway's appointment and
the establishment of the new
department, both effective June
1, were announced yesterday by
Dr. Clayton Rich, University
vice-president for medical affairs.
They were approved earlier in the
day by the Board of Trustees.
The new department, formerly
a division in the Department of
Surgery, is believed to be the first
of its kind in the United States.
"It is generally recognized that
the Stanford program of
cardiovascular surgery has for 15
years been among the most
productive in the nation in
research and education as well as
patient care," Dr. Rich said.
"Granting departmental status
to cardiovascular surgery will
serve to maintain at Stanford a
distinguished program in a new
discipline which has reached
scientific and academic maturity,"
he concluded.
Shumway, 51, is world
reknowned for his work in cardiac
transplantation and open-heart
surgery. The heart transplant
program here is the most active in
the world, averaging one
transplant per month. To date, 69
patients have received new hearts

at Stanford; 24 are alive, one for
four years and 11 months.
In cardiac surgery, Dr.
Shumway's contributions have
included the development of safer
and more effective techniques for
total surgical correction of "blue
baby"heart defects, heart valve
replacement, and correction of
birth defects involving

transposition of the heart's great
vessels.
In addition to Dr. Shumway,
charter faculty members of the
new department are Dr. Eugene
Dong Jr., associate professor of
cardiovascular surgery, and Drs.
Edward B. Stinson and Randall B.
Griepp, assistant professors.
