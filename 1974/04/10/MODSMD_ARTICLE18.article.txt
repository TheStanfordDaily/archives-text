Chemistry Prof. Paul John Flory — recipient of the American
Chemical Society's 1974 Priestley Medal, the highest honor in
American chemistry—has been chosen by the American Academy
of Achievement as one of "50 giants of accomplishment from
America's great fields of endeavor" to receive a golden plate
award during the 30th annual Salute to Excellence weekend, June
27-29, at Salt Lake City, Utah.
A physical chemist best known for his pioneering research on
large molecules (polymers), Flory has contributed to virtually
every phase of polymer chemistry. (Polymers are large molecules,
like those in rubber composed of smaller molecules linked in
chainlike fashion.)
