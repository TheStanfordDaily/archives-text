# Weather Halts Campus Drive Extension
## 
### JEFFREY HALL 
Row house residents have
received a temporary respite from
the early morning sounds of
earth-moving equipment, but as
soon as the mud caused by recent
rains dries out, it will be back to
work for the contractor on the
Campus Drive extension project.
"The weatherman shut us
down," said University Master
Planner Oscar Nelson, referring to
the week of inclement weather
during spring vacation.
As for the noise, he said, "I'm
sure it's a disturbance, as all
construction projects are."
The project is slated for
completion sometime around the
end of May, according lo Nelson.
The lot where Grove House
once stood and the ftreet in front
of Lasuen House are now fields of
mud, dotted with foot-deep
puddles. A large scraper and roller
stand idle, and large stockpiles of
dirt outline the future Campus
Drive.
Trees Removed
A few large trees were
removed, as well as a number of

small shrubs. This, coupled with
the moving of Grove House last
summer, opened the way for the
connection of Campus Drive with
Mayfield Avenue, which joins the
Stanford campus with traffic from
Junipero Serra.
Plans call for a two-lane road
with an eight-foot bicycle path
paralleling it on the campus side.
The street and path will be lit and
landscaped.
Also, delivery of two traffic
light assemblies is expected during
the summer. They will be erected
at the intersections of Campus
Drive with both Lasuen and
Salvatierra Streets.
The project is designed to
provide a peripheral route for
Stanford traffic, directing flow in
a "circle" around the campus.
John Lerry, manager of
construction and engineering in
the Planning Office, described the
proposed access as "safer and
more usable."
Stanford Ave. Alternative
The new Campus Drive will
offer an alternative to Page Mill
Road and Stanford Avenue,

according to Lerry. Residents in
the College Terrace area have
complained about the traffic on
Stanford Avenue.
Lane W, which runs from the
Tresidder parking lot to Mayfield
Avenue, will be closed and used
for additional parking. More
parking will also be available in
the vicinity of the new lasw
school, where a section of the
"old" Campus Drive will be
blocked to through traffic.
It is likely, said Lerry, that the
section of Mayfield Avenue which
is to be connected to Campus
Drive, will be renamed Campus
Drive. The section of Campus
Drive that will be closed will need
a new name as well.
Lerry pointed out that names

used for campus streets usually
bear some connection with local
history or are named after
Stanford figures.
Natural Traffic Flow
"The master plan for traffic
should provide for a more natural
flow of traffic," said student
intern Lance Friedmann of the
University Committee on Land
and Building Development. The
new Campus Drive will route
traffic around the school, he
noted, thus not disturbing the
inner campus.
The area has been the focus of
many recent construction plans.
The controversial emeriti housing
project, rejected last quarter in a
student referendum, is still under
consideration.
The Provost's Office is

currently conducting a survey of
those who would be eligible to lie
in the Row development, and
expect to finish the survey by
April 11. No decision on the
emeriti proposal can be made
before then.
If approved, the housing
project would be built on the
present site of the Stanford Day
Care Center, formerly the
Stanford Elementary School.
"Most people accept the
Campus Drive extension thing as
all right," said Charlie Hall, a
resident of Hurlbert House, which
borders on the Campus Drive site.
"It's when they start talking
about moving houses and building
the emeriti project on the Row
that we get upset," Hall said.

CONSTRUCTION DETOUR—Row House residents have been spared the sounds of earth-moving
equipment being used to facilitate the extension of Campus Drive, thanks to the recent rains. However,
construction is expected to begin again soon.
Row house residents have
received a temporary respite from
the early morning sounds of
earth-moving equipment, but as
soon as the mud caused by recent
rains dries out, it will be back to
work for the contractor on the
Campus Drive extension project.
"The weatherman shut us
down," said University Master
Planner Oscar Nelson, referring to
the week of inclement weather
during spring vacation.
As for the noise, he said, "I'm
sure it's a disturbance, as all
construction projects are."
The project is slated for
completion sometime around the
end of May, according lo Nelson.
The lot where Grove House
once stood and the ftreet in front
of Lasuen House are now fields of
mud, dotted with foot-deep
puddles. A large scraper and roller
stand idle, and large stockpiles of
dirt outline the future Campus
Drive.
Trees Removed
A few large trees were
removed, as well as a number of

small shrubs. This, coupled with
the moving of Grove House last
summer, opened the way for the
connection of Campus Drive with
Mayfield Avenue, which joins the
Stanford campus with traffic from
Junipero Serra.
Plans call for a two-lane road
with an eight-foot bicycle path
paralleling it on the campus side.
The street and path will be lit and
landscaped.
Also, delivery of two traffic
light assemblies is expected during
the summer. They will be erected
at the intersections of Campus
Drive with both Lasuen and
Salvatierra Streets.
The project is designed to
provide a peripheral route for
Stanford traffic, directing flow in
a "circle" around the campus.
John Lerry, manager of
construction and engineering in
the Planning Office, described the
proposed access as "safer and
more usable."
Stanford Ave. Alternative
The new Campus Drive will
offer an alternative to Page Mill
Road and Stanford Avenue,

according to Lerry. Residents in
the College Terrace area have
complained about the traffic on
Stanford Avenue.
Lane W, which runs from the
Tresidder parking lot to Mayfield
Avenue, will be closed and used
for additional parking. More
parking will also be available in
the vicinity of the new lasw
school, where a section of the
"old" Campus Drive will be
blocked to through traffic.
It is likely, said Lerry, that the
section of Mayfield Avenue which
is to be connected to Campus
Drive, will be renamed Campus
Drive. The section of Campus
Drive that will be closed will need
a new name as well.
Lerry pointed out that names

used for campus streets usually
bear some connection with local
history or are named after
Stanford figures.
Natural Traffic Flow
"The master plan for traffic
should provide for a more natural
flow of traffic," said student
intern Lance Friedmann of the
University Committee on Land
and Building Development. The
new Campus Drive will route
traffic around the school, he
noted, thus not disturbing the
inner campus.
The area has been the focus of
many recent construction plans.
The controversial emeriti housing
project, rejected last quarter in a
student referendum, is still under
consideration.
The Provost's Office is

currently conducting a survey of
those who would be eligible to lie
in the Row development, and
expect to finish the survey by
April 11. No decision on the
emeriti proposal can be made
before then.
If approved, the housing
project would be built on the
present site of the Stanford Day
Care Center, formerly the
Stanford Elementary School.
"Most people accept the
Campus Drive extension thing as
all right," said Charlie Hall, a
resident of Hurlbert House, which
borders on the Campus Drive site.
