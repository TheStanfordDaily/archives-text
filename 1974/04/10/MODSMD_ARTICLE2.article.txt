SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Declaring "the lid is off" the Patricia
Hearst kidnaping, U.S. Atty. Gen.
William Saxbe said yesterday the FBI
now has more freedom and predicted
her abductors will be apprehended.
"Now that the lid is off, I think
we're going to see some results,"
Saxbe said. "We will apprehend the
people involved in this case if they
stay in this country."
Saxbe said in Washington that the
FBI has restricted its investigation
because of concern for the 20-year old
newspaper heiress, who was kidnapped
Feb. 4 from her Berkeley apartment.
He said the FBI had been doing
everything possible to co-operate with
her family.
"Now the family is not thinking she
is going to be returned from day to
day and doesn't think the ransom will
be adequate. This will give the FBI
more freedom to operate," he said.
Parents in Mexico
Saxbe noted the girl's parents,
Randolph and Catherine Hearst, have
gone to the Las Cruces Hotel, 19 miles
south-east of La Paz in Baja California
for vacation.
Patricia Hearst declared in a taped
communique received last Wednesday
that she had renounced her family, her
fiance and her friends and was joining
her Symbionese Liberation Army
kidnapers as an armed revolutionary.
In the largest ransom in U.S.
history, the SLA had demanded Hearst
provide $6 million in food for the
poor. He established a $2 million food
program, and the Hearst Corp. pledged
the additional $4 million if his
daughter is released unharmed by May
3.
FBI Investigation
In San Francisco, Charles Bates,
FBI agent in charge of the case, said
his office has been conducting "an
aggressive investigation and we're still
conducting an aggressive investigation,
doing everything possible.
"We're trying to solve a kidnaping
case and we're going to solve it," Bates
said. "People will be arrested and
brought to court for this crime and
there's no question in my mind about
that."
Bates said Hearst "is not directing
the FBl's investigation and never has,"
adding that the FBI is "still concerned
about her safety and well being."
Asked whether the FBI would try

to find Patricia and rescue her, Bates
replied: "I don't know. It depends on
facts. It's just impossible to say what
we're going to do under that set of
facts until they exist."
In St. Paul, Minn., American Indian
Movement leader Dennis Banks said he
might have received a phone call from
the SLA Monday night. Hearst had
asked Banks to appeal to the SLA for
a meeting between Patty and her
family.
