# NEW RESEARCH GUIDES
## 
### 
Four new research concerning America's minorities —
Afro-American poets, Asian Americans, Mexican-Americans, and
native Americans — have been placed in both the Main and Meyer
Undergraduate libraries.
"The guides were prepared to aid students in finding and using
significant bibliographic information which Stanford libraries
have on these subjects," said Robert Goiter, assistant director of
University libraries.
Copies are also being sent to the appropriate student
organizations, to faculty who teach related subjects Goiter said,
adding, "We hope that greater awareness and use of this
information will help students in pursuing both personal and
academic interests."
