# Cards Win Tuneup, 7-2

### RONALD BECK 
Playing without its top four
team members, Stanford turned
back an unexpectedly tough
University of San Diego tennis
team yesterday at the varsity
courts. Strong winds played tricks
with the balls, but the Cardinals
prevailed for a 7-2 win.
Coach Dick Could let Sandy
Mayer, Jim Delaney, John
Whitlinger and Pat DuPre rest
after their tough weekend in Los
Angeles. By not playing them,
Gould was able to give other
players a chance to get actual
match experience.
San Diego, which finished third
last year in the NCAA college
division, won both its matches in
singles play. Chico Hagey, at first
singles, dropped his match to
Andrew Rae, 6-4, 6-2. Paul
Sidone, at fourth singles, also lost,
7-5, 6-2.

Hagey started the match
looking a bit apprehensive about
going for winners, and never
seemed to get into top form.
Hagey consistently ran around his
backhand and was kept from
reaching the net by Rae's strong
forcing shots.
At the number two spot, Nick
Saviano clearly overpowered
Russell Watts. Displaying a big
serve and a driving crosscourt
backhand, Saviano consistently
had Watts on the defensive, and
won 6-2, 6-3.
Mark Mitchell started off with
a well-played first set against
left-handed Hannu Ojala, but
looked as if he lost his
concentration in the second set.
However, Mitch recovered and
won the third set and match, 6-3,
6-7, 6-4.
Gene Mayer, at fifth singles,
put on another impressive display

by outfinessing his opponent, Don
Dramer, in two quick sets, 6-1,
6-2. Chip Fisher rounded out the
singles with another quick victory,
6-2, 6-3.
Both of the first two doubles
went the full distance of three
sets. Hagey-Fisher teamed to win
the first set 7-5, drop the second
in a tiebreaker 6-7, and win a
close third set by a 6-4 score.
Saviano-Mitchell started off
poorly by mishitting many easy
shots, but came back strongly to
take the next two sets, winning
3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
Tim Noonan-Jake Warde ended
the match with a fast 6-4, 6-0 win,
the only love set of the day.
Saviano said that the
University of San Diego was a "lot
stronger than we had expected.
We had never even heard of them,
but they really extended us."
Gould expressed similar feelings.
"They're a good team, and we had
a lot of close matches."
Gould also added, "We're going
to have to play a lot better if we
expect to do well against Cal on
Thursday." The lineup against
Berkeley will use everyone but
Sandy Mayer, according to Gould.
The JV's fought a tough match
also on the varsity courts
yesterday. The Cards beat Canada
College, the defending California
JC Tennis Team Champions by a
5-4 score. The deciding match was
won by Glenn Golden and Bill
Koran in three sets.
