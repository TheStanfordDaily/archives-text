# Giants' 4-0 Start Points To Pennant
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN Commentary 
Four games does not a season
make.
But if the San Francisco Giants
continue to play as they did last
weekend against the Houston
Astros and Monday against the
Cincinnati Reds, don't be
surprised to see them in the
playoffs this October.
The Giants won four straight
to jump in front of the Western
Division race of the National
League. In doing so, they
convinced a lot of fans that "next
year" has finally arrived.
Friday's opener was marred by
a steady drizzle which held the
crowd to just above 17,500, but
those in attendance (including
Mayor Joseph Alioto who threw
out the ceremonial first ball) were
treated to a near-perfect
performance by the Giants.
Tom Bradley, who acquired
the starting assignment by default
when Ron Bryant injured himself
diving into a swimming pool in
spring training, pitched like a
20-game winner. In the first eight
innings he scattered four hits, but
ran out of gas and yielded three
singles and a run before being

removed with one out in the
ninth.
Brother-Sister Combo
It took reliever Randy Moffitt
but five pitches to retire the last
two batters. Moffitt, who is best
known for being Billie Jean King's
brother, did not give up an earned
run all spring.
If Moffitt keeps up his strong
performances of Friday, Saturday
(when he recorded his first save
with a one-hit 2 2/3 inning
shutout performance) and
Monday (when he induced
Johnny Bench to fly out with
bases loaded in the ninth), King
may become better known as his
sister.
Mike Caldwell, who started
Saturday's game, pitched well
enough to turn early boos from
fans expressing disapproval with
the trading of Willie McCovey for
Caldwell into cheers, and win his
first game as a Giant. In 6 1/3
innings he allowed two runs.
Jim Willoughby, who earned a
starting role by not allowing a run
in 14 innings of spring ball,
pitched a rocky five innings
Sunday, yielding four runs. But
Jim Barr held Houston scoreless
for the remaining four innings for
a save, and the series sweep.
Rookie Jim D'Acquisto held
powerful Cincinnati to two runs
in 6 2/3 innings. Whai he tired,
Elias Sosa, last year's ace reliever,
and Moffitt combined to assure
the 4-3 win.
Plenty of Runs
What made the pitchers' jobs
easier than usual was the
supporting cast which accounted
for 20 runs and 31 hits m the four
games. The Giants' lineup doesn't
give pitchers much of a break.
Bobby Bonds is the best
leadoff hitter in baseball. Last
year he came within one home
run of becoming the first player
to hit 40 or more homers in one
season and steal 40 or more bases
(he stole 43). Other credentials
include 131 runs scored (leading
the majors), 341 total bases
(leading the National League), and
96 runs batted in while batting
leadoff in all but 21 games last
year.
All-star Chris Speier had one
hit in each of the first four games,
and anything he does at the plate
can be considered a bonus to his
excellent fielding and fine arm at
shortstop.
Garry Maddox and Gary
Matthews hit third and fourth,
respectively, and with Bonds
cover the outfield as effectively as
any trio. Matthews hit an even
.300 last year, while Maddox hit a
sizzling .319. Maddox has been
red hot this year with seven hits in
17 trips to the plate, including
two homers. He has a 15-game
hitting streak, extended from last
season.
Two At First
First base is currently held by
rookie Steve Ontiveros, who is
replacing injured Ed Goodson.
Ontiveros homered Saturday after
getting two hits in the opener, and
may force Goodson to fight his
way back into the lineup.
Dave Kingman says he is
satisfied at third base, possibly
because he'll be playing even,' day.
Kingman has five hits this year,
including a three-run homer
against Houston.
Tito Fuentes started the season
at second base, but injured his
back in the opener and was
replaced by Mike Phillips.
Fuentes' loss for any length of
time would be costly, but Phillips
showed Saturday that he would

bo an adequate â– substitute with
two for three.
The catching position finds
two trade acquisitions battling for
the starting job. Ken Rudolph
opened the season behind the
plate, but when John Boccabella
gets into shape, there could be a
battle for the job.
Deep Bench
To support that awesome
lineup, which balances power and
good averages, the Giants have a
fine bench. Either Ontiveros or
Goodson will be playing backup
along with Rudolph or
Boccabella. Gary Thomasson is
available to give outfielders a rest
and Chris Arnold should see
frequent pinch-hitting duty.

The big question mark remains
with the pitching. Bryant comes
of the disabled list tomorrow and
should be in action soon. Bradley
summed up the situation after his
win, when he said that if he didn't
win with the Giants, he wasn't
going to win with anyone.
Pitching Coach Don McMahon
has a tough job, but with a
mixture of season veterans and
strong rookies should be able to
confidently guide the staff this
year.
Challengers
The two teams that have the
best chance to challenge the
Giants are, of course, the Reds
and the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Reds acquired Clav Kirby

and Merv Rettenmund during the
off-season. With one of the most
potent offensive lineups in
baseball, Cincinnati's pitching
success should determine the
team's fate this season.
The Dodgers' biggest asset is a
year of experience, as the young
ball club succumbed to Cincinnati
in the stretch run last September.
The addition of Jim Wynn and
Mike Marshall will make the
Dodgers tougher than a year ago.
But when it comes down to
October, it will be the Giants who
represent the division in the
playoffs, and maybe even the
World Series. "Next year" is here,
and San Francisco fans can't wait
to see it unfold.
