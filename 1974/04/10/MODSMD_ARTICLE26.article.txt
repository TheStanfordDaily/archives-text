Stanford basketball forward
Mike Mann participated last night
in the Four Star Basketball Classic
at Nashville, Tenn., featuring top
college seniors from the Pacific
Eight, Big Ten, Big Eight and
Southwestern conferences.
Mann, a 6-9 three-year varsity
letterman, was invited by letter to
take part in the tournament,
according to varsity assistant Bub
Bowling. The tourney is a single
elimination affair featuring all-star
teams from the four conferences.
The championship game will be
held tonight along with a
consolation tilt between the losers
of last night's openers.
Bowling said the tournament is
not sponsored or sanctioned by
the Pacific Eight but rather by
"one or two guys trying to make
money." Participants are
guaranteed $500, according to
Bowling, with individuals on the
winning squad getting $2000
apiece.
Bill Russell is coaching the
Pac-8 squad, which Bowling says
consists of Mann, Steve Erickson
of Oregon State, -Jim Price of
Washington, Carl Meier and Brady
Allen of California, Dan Anderson
of USC. Tommy Curtis and Greg
Lee of UCLA were also
prospective participants, but
Bruin assistant Gary Cunningham
said yesterday he "doubted" the
two would take part.
Mann suffered through a
disappointing senior season at
Stanford after finishing second in
team scoring average during his
two previous campaigns. Bowling
reasoned that Mann was selected
for the Four Star Classic because
of "the fact he had played as a
sophomore and junior, and played
well, that he's a big guy, capable
of shot blocking, and played good
defense."
"In a game where you can
dunk." said Bowling, referring to
the pro rules of the Classic,
"Mann could be effective."
