# Young-Led JV's Down SCU
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Stanford's junior varsity
baseball team has found a coach
who can provide the motivation it
needs to win the close ball games.
The only trouble is he already has
a job.
Varsity headman Ray Young
led the JV's to an impressive 8-4
victory over the University of
Santa Clara JV's, last Monday on
the Stanford JV Diamond.
This was the third time that
Young's presence has led to a JV
win. Last week the JV's took a
doubleheader from St. Mary's,
scoring 12 runs in the nightcap,
their highest run total of the year.
Monday, behind the pitching
of Jerry Argust, the Cards limited
Santa Clara to just six hits. It was
Argust's first start in four weeks
and he pitched a full nine inning
contest. "Argust did a real good
job for us," said Young. "Most
pitchers would have had trouble
going nine innings if they hadn't

started in four weeks."
"It was a team win," said
Young. "They ran a lot and did a
good job of executing the bunt,"
he continued.
The Cards took a 6-0 lead over
Santa Clara in the second inning
when Bill Lockwood hit a bases
loaded double. The Cards got a
fine performance from Gary
Pitchford who also singled in the
inning to score another run.
Santa Clara came back in the
sixth to keep it close by scoring
four runs on five hits and a Card
error. But that was as close as
they got. Argust limited them to
just one hit in three innings to
shut off their attack.
But when you have a varsity
coach present and you're fighting
for a slot of the varsity roster, the
best always seems to come out,
and this is just what happened.
Stanford erupted for two
more runs on Joel Erickson's

two-run eighth-inning homer to
cinch the game.
What is the difference that a
varsity coach makes to the JV's?
Why has a team which has a so-so
record finally come into its own?
Well the answer is simple —
Young. Rut is it?
Well Young doesn't think it is.
"Having a varsity coach present at
a JV game gives 'em a little more
reason to play. Since we're always
looking for someone who can help
the varsity, they want to play
their best game."
But the difference is not just
improved play but a change in
attitude. Young explained. "When
a varsity coach is with the JV's
there is not as much playing
around. Whether it's me or any
other varsity coach, the same
thing happens. We're trying to run
the JV games just like the varsity
with the same offense and defense
that we use."
The Cards are now 11-7 overall
and they carry a 7-3 Bay Area
Collegiate league record into
tomorrow's game against San Jose
State, on the Stanford JV
Diamond at 2:30 p.m.

PICKOFF ATTEMPT—Card first baseman Mark Luoich awaits a throw
in a pickoff attempt during the second game of Stanford's
doubleheader against USC Saturday. Lucich leads the team in hitting
with a .400 average (4 for 10) in the Pacific-Eight conference. The
Cards were rained out of a non-conference game against Cal
yesterday. Stanford, 2-1 in the conference, travels to Los Angeles this
weekend for a three-game series with UCLA.
