## Two Georgias 
### Don Tollefson 
For many reasons it was fitting that Hank Aaron's recordbreaking
715 th home run was hit in Atlanta. Bowie Kuhn's petty power plav
failed to prevent Aaron from breaking the record at home; the Atlanta
fans got to see the historic moment in person as well they should
have; and the Atlanta management got to reap the financial benefits
of at least one full house in a season that is far from promisingfor the
Braves.
But Atlanta was a fitting site for another less obvious reason.
Henry Aaron reached the pinnacle of sports in a city that prides itself
on being the epitome of the new South, complete with a black mayor.
Certainly no one believes that racism and injustice are completely
remnants of a bygone era there, but Atlanta has made more progress
than almost any other major Southern city.
Elsewhere in Georgia later this week, sports fans will have a chance
to see one of the most vivid reminders of the old South — the Masters
Golf Tournament — which will take place this weekend in Augusta. As
always, America's most aristocratic breed of athletes will return to
this golf plantation for a few days of superb golf, magnificent scenery
and flashes of good ol' Southern racism.
At the Masters, the black man's role is to carry clubs and golf balls
and smile and grimace as he follows his "Master" around the course.
Caddying may be a fine way to learn the finer points of the game, but
its a bit pointless when so few blacks are ever given a real chance to
make it in the sport. It's too bad the game still suffers from some
vestiges of an era best left dead and buried.
Golf does have its share of critics, but I don't buy the argument of
some who claim that golfers are inferior athletes. Such statements are
almost as naive as claiming that just because Kyle Rote Jr. won the
overpublicized Superstars competition, all soccer players are better
athletes than their counterparts in other sports.
Spectator Sport
I will admit that I've never considered golf to be one of the world's
most exciting spectator sports. Some golfers claim that viewing
tournaments on television is extremely helpful to their games, but 1
am somewhat skeptical of how much can be learned from rapid
glances at a wide variety of golfers. I may be wrong on that point, but
1 can assure you that most non-golfing sports fans I know find
televised golf matches about as exciting a spectator sport as bridge is.
But it's not the boredom which really bothers me. It's the
holier-than-holy, upper class, monolithic nature of the sport. Almost
every pro golfer looks like he just stepped out of the same dry
cleaning machine Johnny Carson lives in. Visible non-conformity is
about as tolerated as air horns in the galleries.
And if I read another American Dream story about a ex-frat man,
WASP golfer who wears double-knits, lives in a suburban community
with his ex-sorority queen wife and takes his two children to church
every day, I may go hit some golf balls through the window of a local
pro shop.
Liberal Facade
Some people will claim that it's not the golfers' faults that many
bigots are involved in running the Masters and a number of other
tournaments. And I'm sure some golfers are sincere in expressing
concern about the overwhelming whiteness of the sport and are
dedicated to changing this remnant of yesteryear. But I am sure there
are many others who simply have learned the wisdom of a Madison
Ave. liberal facade and it is obvious that their actions speak louder
than their words.
For despite all the talk about broadening access to the sport and
taking golf out of its upper class ghetto and combatting the racism of
so many country clubs, few golfers have taken any real substantive
stands. If a golfer is really sincere about fighting the country club
injustices which pervade the sport, why does he play in a tournament
run by men who personify that injustice?
In an era when golfers are sharing in the bountiful spoils of
professional sports, why haven't any demonstrated the sincerity of
their reformist concern by setting up some well-financed and well-run
efforts to broaden the access routes to the sport? The only answer to
these questions seems to be a kind of "benign neglect" of the kind
Richard Nixon has practiced so often.
Selfish Citizens
Most golfers still seem more interested in endorsing slacks than
opening up the game to people who possess the talent, but not the
resources and entree, to eventually succeed at the sport. Such
selfishness is hard to explain, especially in a sport which prides itself
on the "fine, upstanding citizens" who dominate the ranks of its
practitioners.
If you happen to tune in coverage of the Masters this weekend,
some announcer will undoubtedly be extolling the great tradition this
tournament represents. Traditions have their place, but not all are
virtuous.
It's too bad that the game of golf continues to perpetuate some
traditions which should have long ago been relegated to the negative
chapters in our history books.
