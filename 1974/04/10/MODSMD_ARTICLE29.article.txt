Anderson: Connally Investigated
WASHINGTON — Former Treasury Secretary John B.
Connally is under investigation by Watergate prosecutors
for bribery, columnist Jack Anderson said yesterday.
Connally, considered a contender for the 1976
Republican presidential nomination, denied the allegation.
FBI investigators assigned to the special prosecution
have evidence that Connally pocketed $10,000 from the
Associated Milk Producers Inc., Anderson said.
Anderson quoted FBI sources as saying the alleged
$10,000 bribe was passed by Milk Producers official Robert
Lilly to lobbyist Jake Jacobsen, who delivered it to
Connally.
Jacobsen is under indictment for perjury for testifying
that he stashed the $10,000 in a safe deposit box and never
removed it until the FBI opened the box last November.
Anderson quoted Connally as saying, "I have told the
Watergate prosecutors the truth about it, and I am going to
continue to tell them the truth."
Connally told the Dallas Times Herald yesterday that "I
have categorically denied I received the money, and I do so
today."
The FBI investigators say Connally returned the $10,000
after the milk producers came under investigation involving
contributions to President Nixon's re-election, Anderson
said.
The FBI sources also told Anderson that, after Connally
pocketed the $10,000 from the Milk Producers, he juggled
his schedule on March 16, 1972, to meet with AMPI
officials George Mehren and Harold Nelson.
In the presence of the Milk Producers officials, according
to sworn testimony, Connally telephoned Atty. Gen. John
N. Mitchell, Anderson said.
Anderson said Connally said, "John get off your — and
find out what is going on in the Mid-west. There is
discontent among the dairy farmers, and I have a group of
them here."
White House Delays Tapes Decision
WASHINGTON — The White House informed the House
Judiciary Committee yesterday it wants to wait until after
the Easter recess of Congress before deciding how to
respond to a committee request for tapes of 42 presidential
conversations.
James D. St. Clair, President Nixon's defense counsel in
the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the
committee, indicated in a letter that additional materials
would be furnished after Congress returns from its Easter
holiday April 22 that "will permit the committee to
complete its inquiry promptly."
The committee had set a Tuesday deadline for a reply to
its request for the tapes. But a White House official, who
declined to be quoted, insisted the only thing expected of
St. Clair was to spell out at this time how the White House
intended to go about considering the request.
In a letter to committee special counsel John M Doar,
St. Clair said Nixon "has directed me to advise you that a
review of the materials in question is under way." The
letter continued:
"We expect that the review can be completed by the end
of the Easter recess, and that the additional materials
furnished at that time will permit the committee to
complete its inquiry promptly.
St. Clair's letter fell far short of promising to furnish all
the materials sought by the committee.
Chairman Peter W. Rodino, D-N.J., plans a committee
meeting for today or tomorrow to deal with the
possible issuance of a subpoena for the materials if St.
Clair's response is deemed unsatisfactory.
Earlier yesterday, Judiciary Committee Democrats
supported a proposal to let President Nixon's lawyer
attend closed sessions of the committee during the

impeachment inquiry.
In another apparent concession to Republican critics,
Doar said he would be able to present an overview of the
case in about seven days, rather than take five to six weeks
in a detailed presentation, as he had proposed earlier.
The Democrats are still proposing to delay any decisions
on whether to call witnesses or receive additional evidence
until the initial presentation is completed.
That is another area of disagreement with at least some
Republican members, who want assurances that important
witnesses will be brought before the committee for
cross-examination by St. Clair.
Doubt Cast On Mitchell Charges
NEW YORK — Insurance tycoon W. Clement Stone cast
doubt yesterday on government claims that former Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell warned a Republican presidential
campaign aide to "stay away" from financier Robert L.
Vesco and his $200,000 campaign contribution.
Vesco's secret cash contribution, the government
charges, was the reason for the charges of conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and perjury of which Mitchell and
former Commerce Secretary Maurice Stans are accused.
The testimony about the warning had come earlier in the
trial from Daniel Hofgren, a government witness at the
criminal conspiracy trial of Mitchell and Stans.
Hofgren testified he talked to Mitchell at a reception
that preceded a March 8, 1972, fund-raising dinner at the
Washington Hilton hotel, and that Mitchell made the "stay
away" remark on that occasion.
Stone, however, testified for the defense that Mitchell
was his guest at the $1,000-a-plate dinner; didn't make the
reception, and arrived late for the dinner itself.
That left it up to the jury to decide whether Mitchell
had the opportunity to talk with Hofgren that night.
In an attempt to counter the testimony, the government,
on cross-examination, drew from Stone testimony that
there were a number of other receptions at the hotel that
night at which Hofgren might have encountered Mitchell.
Stone, 71, a Chicago multimillionaire, was the largest
single contributor to President Nixon's 1972 campaign,
donating more than $2 million. He picked up a $10,000 tab
for a table for 10 at the dinner.
Teamsters Endorse Alioto
SAN FRANCISCO — The powerful Bay Area Teamsters
Union Joint Council yesterday endorsed Mayor Joseph L.
Alioto for governor of California and called him a skilled
and fair labor mediator.
Joint Council President Jack Goldberger said he was
certain the endorsement of Alioto by the Teamsters Joint
Council would be supported solidly by the 80,000 union
members in the council's locals.
He said statewide Teamster backing for Alioto would
mean support from 250,000 members.
"What he Alioto has demonstrated in mediation and
negotiation through the years is that he is fair. We in
organized labor can't ask for more than that," Goldberger
said.
Goldberger said the governor's office in these times
needs a man "who knows how to handle collective
bargaining."
Alioto, seeking the Democratic nomination, appeared
with Goldberger at a news conference and said he hoped for
a similar endorsement by Southern California Teamsters on
Thursday.
Today's Weather
Fair today through tomorrow. Warmer days. Lows
tonight in mid 30s to mid 40s. Highs today in the 60s and
tomorrow in mid 60s to low 70s.
