# Campaign For Stanford Raises $150 Million In First Two Years
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The five-year Campaign For
Stanford has raised $150 million at the
end of its second year, half of its $300
million objective, national co-chairmen
Wallace Sterling and Richard
Guggenhime, announced yesterday at
a news conference.
"This is very encouraging," said
Sterling, chancellor of the University.
"We believe that we will succeed in
raising the $300 million, despite the
economic uncertainties that prevail
throughout the United States and the
world."
The campaign, launched in April
1972 as the most intensive fund raising
drive ever undertaken by an American
university, is intended to increase the
University's endowment by $125
million. The campaign is also supposed
to raise $92 million for current
operating expenses and $83 million for
new buildings.
Sterling said yesterday that - gifts
and pledges for endowment and
operating needs are running ahead of
schedule, but the building fund is
behind the goal set for this point in
the campaign.
Large Contributions
The first two years of the campaign
have been devoted to soliciting large
contributions, Sterling explained. In
the remaining period of the drive, the
University will attempt to pick up
more small gifts and pledges.
In order to solicit funds from
alumni and other sources, the
University has enlisted the support of
3600 volunteers, Sterling said. Their
enthusiasm for fund raising has been a
major factor in the success of the
campaign, he noted.
Guggenheim, a San Francisco
attorney, said he expects that the
volunteers will continue to work hard
to raise money for the University after
the end of the campaign.
He added that a by-product of the
Campaign For Stanford will probably
be an increase in the level of
contributions after the end of the five
year period. "People will be used to
giving more," he remarked.
Rate Rose
Guggenhime recalled that the rate
of donations was substantially
increased after the University's last
major fund raising effort between
1961 and 1964. That campaign set a
national record by raising $114
million.
The current campaign was started
after University officials expressed
concern over the fact that while

Stanford was generally ranked third
among American universities in the
quality of its academic program, its
endowment barely ranked in the top
10.
Both Sterling and President Richard
Lyman emphasized yesterday that a
continuation of high academic quality
depends on the successful solicitation
of funds.
Robert Minge Brown, president of
the Board of Trustees, said the
University has no contingency plan if
the campaign does not reach its goal
three years from now. "We don't plan
on failure; we plan on success," Brown

stated.
Major achievements to date, made
possible by the Campaign, include the
construction of the new Law School
complex, the Fairchild Center for the
Neurosciences and the Terman
Engineering Center. Also, campaign
gifts are supporting one endowed
deanship, 29 new endowed
professorships and 36 new endowed
scholarship and fellowship funds.
Lyman noted that gifts for the
social sciences are just as substantial as
thftse for the natural sciences.
Although gifts for the social sciences
and humanities are often not as great

in monetary size, instruction in the
social sciences isn't as costly as
instruction in natural science, he
pointed out.
Sterling stated that despite the
uncertainty of the world economic
environment, Stanford has every
reason to expect to continue its
growth.
"There's been a lot of talk in the
country of a decline in interest for
higher education. This is a "Doubting
Thomas" attitude that I decline to
accept. I am encouraged that whatever
reasons are behind this attitude are not
present here."

quality of its academic program, its
endowment barely ranked in the top
10.
Both Sterling and President Richard
Lyman emphasized yesterday that a
continuation of high academic quality
depends on the successful solicitation
of funds.
Robert Minge Brown, president of
the Board of Trustees, said the
University has no contingency plan if
the campaign does not reach its goal
three years from now. "We don't plan
on failure; we plan on success," Brown

stated.
Major achievements to date, made
possible by the Campaign, include the
construction of the new Law School
complex, the Fairchild Center for the
Neurosciences and the Terman
Engineering Center. Also, campaign
gifts are supporting one endowed
deanship, 29 new endowed
professorships and 36 new endowed
scholarship and fellowship funds.
Lyman noted that gifts for the
social sciences are just as substantial as
thftse for the natural sciences.
Although gifts for the social sciences
and humanities are often not as great

in monetary size, instruction in the
social sciences isn't as costly as
instruction in natural science, he
pointed out.
Sterling stated that despite the
uncertainty of the world economic
environment, Stanford has every
reason to expect to continue its
growth.
"There's been a lot of talk in the
country of a decline in interest for
higher education. This is a "Doubting
Thomas" attitude that I decline to
accept. I am encouraged that whatever
reasons are behind this attitude are not
present here."
The five-year Campaign For
Stanford has raised $150 million at the
end of its second year, half of its $300
million objective, national co-chairmen
Wallace Sterling and Richard
Guggenhime, announced yesterday at
a news conference.
"This is very encouraging," said
Sterling, chancellor of the University.
"We believe that we will succeed in
raising the $300 million, despite the
economic uncertainties that prevail
throughout the United States and the
world."
The campaign, launched in April
1972 as the most intensive fund raising
drive ever undertaken by an American
university, is intended to increase the
University's endowment by $125
million. The campaign is also supposed
to raise $92 million for current
operating expenses and $83 million for
new buildings.
Sterling said yesterday that - gifts
and pledges for endowment and
operating needs are running ahead of
schedule, but the building fund is
behind the goal set for this point in
the campaign.
Large Contributions
The first two years of the campaign
have been devoted to soliciting large
contributions, Sterling explained. In
the remaining period of the drive, the
University will attempt to pick up
more small gifts and pledges.
In order to solicit funds from
alumni and other sources, the
University has enlisted the support of
3600 volunteers, Sterling said. Their
enthusiasm for fund raising has been a
major factor in the success of the
campaign, he noted.
Guggenheim, a San Francisco
attorney, said he expects that the
volunteers will continue to work hard
to raise money for the University after
the end of the campaign.
He added that a by-product of the
Campaign For Stanford will probably
be an increase in the level of
contributions after the end of the five
year period. "People will be used to
giving more," he remarked.
Rate Rose
Guggenhime recalled that the rate
of donations was substantially
increased after the University's last
major fund raising effort between
1961 and 1964. That campaign set a
national record by raising $114
million.
The current campaign was started
after University officials expressed
concern over the fact that while

Stanford was generally ranked third
among American universities in the
quality of its academic program, its
endowment barely ranked in the top
10.
