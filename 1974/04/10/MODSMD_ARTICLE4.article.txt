# Outside Activities Cited
## Murphy To Leave Post 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Bob Murphy, sports information
director here since 1969, will leave his
post at the end of spring quarter, the
Daily learned yesterday.
Apparently Murphy's professional
activities outside the University,
including his recent appointment as
Executive Director of the East—West
Shrine game, conflicted with Athletic
Director Joe Ruetz' views regarding
the job of sports information director.
"I wasn't fired and I didn't quit,"
Murphy said last night. "I presented
circumstances that were unaccpetable
to the Athletic Director. In essence I
resigned by accepting the outside
responsibilities."
Ruetz emphasized that he has been
satisfied with Murphy's efforts, but
said that the job "demands a lot of
attention and time." He indicated that
he plans to expand the duties of the
sports information office in the future,
and that Murphy's outside
commitments "made it difficult [for
him] to handle both ends of the
spectrum."
Agreement With Taylor
Murphy, 42, has produced the
Stanford and San Francisco 49er
television football highlight shows,
worked as a color commentator on
Stanford football broadcasts and has
been a member of Mutual Radio
Network's golf broadcast teams for
several professional tournaments— all
part of an agreement with former
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor when
Murphy was hired as "Manager of

Athletic Relations" in 1965.
The same agreement prevailed when
Murphy succeeded Don Liebendorfer
as sports information director in 1969.
Ruetz and Murphy both indicated
that his recent appointment as Shrine
game director wasn't the determining
factor. "We've discussed this at some
length in the past," Ruetz said.
Murphy added that Ruetz has never
been favorable to his outside
commitments since assuming the

directorship in September, 1972. "We
would have reached an impasse
without the Shrine game," he said.
Apparently Ruetz insisted that
Murphy drop either his outside
commitments or his Stanford job.
Murphy, despite "strong emotional
ties to the University," chose the latter
primarily because of financial reasons.
Murphy contends, however, that his
various outside activities never
interfered with his job as sports
information director "I did everything
as a representative of Stanford
University," he said.
"Furthermore, it is my opinion that
there are hundreds of others—in all
areas of the University—who do the
same sort of thing since Stanford's
salaries are very often not at a level
where you can reasonably support a
family and handle all the normal
responsibilities."
Praise From Ruetz
In a prepared statement Co be
released today, Ruetz said: "Bob's
work and talents have contributed
greatly to the success of Stanford's
athletic program over the past
decade—which includes two Rose
Bowl victories, a Heisman trophy
winner (Jim Plunkett), NCAA
championship teams in
swimming(l967) and tennis (1973),
and any number of other individual
and team honors."
Ruetz told the Daily last night that
"I think Bob will do a superb job with
the Shrine game. He'll do a superb job
with anything he does."
Ruetz also expressed hope that
Murphy will "continue to work with
Don Klein on our football radio
broadcasts and continue to produce
our football highlights film. We also
want to utilize his talents on
promotion for other events, and may
hire him as a consultant."
Search For Successor
The search for a successor will
begin immediately, Ruetz said. The
athletic department will look for
candidates both inside and outside the
University. Murphy's part-time
assistant, John Wright, is reportedly
not being considered.
Murphy, a 1953 Stanford graduate,
pitched for the Indian baseball team
and also for the Oakland Oaks of the
olf Pacific Coast league. At 25 he was
named General Manager of the San
Jose minor league club, becoming the
youngest general manager in the
history of organized baseball.
