groups. It has also preposed that ASSU
officials' salaries become refundable
fee assessments, and called for a
reduction of the ASSU budget.
Its members are: Bruce Smyth,
ASSU senator: Liz Kincannon,

interested in increasing the student
role in university governance in order
to make Stanford more of a
democracy.
Its members are Leo Ramek, junior
in human biology, and John Artell,
sophomore with an undeclared major.

The proposed ASSU program fee
would call for students to pay $1
during next fall and winter quarters.
The money would be divided among
41 campus groups, with the .largest
percentage, 10.26, going to the Black
Students Union. The second largest
allocation, 7.69 percent, would go to
the Tresidder Program Board.
The fee assessment would be
refundable.
The Senate moved to delay vote on
the three constitutional ammendments
so it could change the wording of the
proposal concerning removal of
members of the Nominations
Committee.
