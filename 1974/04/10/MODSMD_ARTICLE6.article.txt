# Autistic Children Respond
## SWOPSI Class Means Giving 
### BOB LOWE 
Nine-year-old. Jimmy is perched on a balance beam
four feet above a thick foam pad. A young woman
wearing white levis and a Stanford tank top stands in
front of him with hands on hips.
"Help me!" Jimmy yells.
"Come on, you can do it,"the woman says.
"/ need help,"Jimmy retorts.
"No, you don't," she says tersely. "Come on. I'm
on. I'm waiting for you over here. " The young woman
walks a few feet away.
Jimmy waits for a moment, breaks into a big smile
and plunges onto a foam pad. He gets to his feet and
walks over to the woman. "Thank you, Jimmy," she
says and tousles his hair.
Freshman Vangie Hegis has worked at
Children Center (PCC), a day school in Palo Alto for
the emotionally disturbed, two afternoons a week for
the past six months. She is one of about 30 students
who work at PCC through a Stanford course —
SWOPSI 120 C: Volunteer Work with Autistic and
Schizophrenic Children.
The SWOPSI students make up about one-third of
all PCC volunteers. The three-quarter course ends in
June, but PCC uses volunteers throughout the year
who want to help on their own. Largely because of this

non-staff help, the center designs programs which fit
the individual needs of each of the 37 children.
Working with emotionally disturbed children is a
new experience for many of the students and requires
some adjustment. Previously, Hegis had worked only
with non-handicapped children and it took time before
she was comfortable at PCC.
When she saw a boy with self-inflicted scratches
covering his face in the classroom where she works,
Hegis kept her composure but "it took some getting
used to."
First Lessons
Patience and the acceptance of small improvements
in the kids are the first lessons Hegis and the other
volunteers learned.
Senior Evan Laughlin spends most of his time with
Ronny, a child who is completely non-communicative
and unable to perform the simplest tasks. Laughlin is
teaching him how to dress himself.
The process is long and slow but not without
results. "Even if you just teach him how to put his
shirt on, it's something," Laughlin says. In some ways,
he thinks, it can be more significant than teaching a
normal child how to read.
The children at PCC range in age from three to 18

and vary in behavior from autistic, self-destructive
children to kids with less serious speaking and learning
problems. They all have one characteristic in common
— a problem communicating. Each child relates and
responds differently to people. Discovering how to
strike the right chords in each isn't easy.
"You have to remember that they don't always
relate to words," Hegis says. She uses non-verbal
methods to praise the children.
"Larry responds to a hug and Ken likes being
touched," she says. "Jerry thrives on M & Ms and Bill
loves the 'gimme five' hand slap."
Discipline also requires the same type of
adjustment. While Hegis admits that "discipline and
authority come naturally for me,"she had always
verbally told children what they shouldn't do. At PCC
she found that words aren't enough.
Sitting in a corner for a short time and spending a
few minutes in "time out," a room where the child is
alone and receives no attention for his actions, are
disciplinary tactics in her classroom.
Smile
Hegis speaks authoritatively when she needs to, but
a warm undercurrent in her voice softens the edge. Her
long black hair and wire rimmed glasses frame an
always-ready smile.
She, like everyone, needs rewards in her work to
keep her going. "I need a little positive reinforcement
myself," she says.
Hegis finds satisfaction in watching a child learn a
simple task. She spent days teaching Bill how to wash
his hands. He always forgot one vital step — rinsing off
the soap. Time and time again she reminded him,
"rinse your hands."
"One day he rinsed his hands by himself. Wow!" she
says.

One reason why Hegis and the other volunteers
continue working at PCC is because they deal with
people who have concrete problems. "You can take
midterms until you suffocate," Laughlin says, "but this
is real."
'Introverted'
Each volunteer contributes in his own way. Mark
Loveland is a quiet, soft spoken senior who describes
himself as "introverted" and "not very assertive."
He works closely with Bruce, a boy who is
withdrawn and speaks in a squeaky whisper. "I identify
with Bruce's withdrawn, voluntary solitary
confinement," Loveland says."I sort of had that
tendency when I was his age. I feel that I can be more
patient with him than someone who might not
understand."
Loveland adds that working at PCC "forces you to
be assertive and helps to build your own self image."
Hegis says that "my kids have taught me not to be
too selfish." She entered the SWOPSI course because
she felt she had something to give. "They taught me
how to give all the more," she says.
At the end of the day, Hegis and Loveland are
sitting at a table with four boys in their classroom.
"What did you do, today, Bruce?" Hegis asks the boy
next to her.
"Rode a train," Bruce says softly, referring to a
plywood train on the PCC playground.
"Oh, you rode a train, Bruce. What did the train
sound like?" He murmurs something. "What did it
sound like?" Hegis asks again.
Bruce slowly lifts his hand and then jerks it down as
if pulling on an overhead rope. "Toot," he whispers.
"Bruce, that's very good," she says and wraps her
arm around him. "Hey everybody, listen to Bruce!"
He pulls his imaginery rope again and says "toot"a
little louder.
