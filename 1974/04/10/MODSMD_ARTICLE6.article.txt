# Autistic Children Respond
## SWOPSI Class Means Giving 
### BOB LOWE 
Nine-year-old. Jimmy is perched on a balance beam
four feet above a thick foam pad. A young woman
wearing white levis and a Stanford tank top stands in
front of him with hands on hips.
"Help me!" Jimmy yells.
"Come on, you can do it,"the woman says.
"/ need help,"Jimmy retorts.
"No, you don't," she says tersely. "Come on. I'm
on. I'm waiting for you over here. " The young woman
walks a few feet away.
Jimmy waits for a moment, breaks into a big smile
and plunges onto a foam pad. He gets to his feet and
walks over to the woman. "Thank you, Jimmy," she
says and tousles his hair.
Freshman Vangie Hegis has worked at
Children Center (PCC), a day school in Palo Alto for
the emotionally disturbed, two afternoons a week for
the past six months. She is one of about 30 students
who work at PCC through a Stanford course —
SWOPSI 120 C: Volunteer Work with Autistic and
Schizophrenic Children.
The SWOPSI students make up about one-third of
all PCC volunteers. The three-quarter course ends in
June, but PCC uses volunteers throughout the year
who want to help on their own. Largely because of this

non-staff help, the center designs programs which fit
the individual needs of each of the 37 children.
Working with emotionally disturbed children is a
new experience for many of the students and requires
some adjustment. Previously, Hegis had worked only
with non-handicapped children and it took time before
she was comfortable at PCC.
When she saw a boy with self-inflicted scratches
covering his face in the classroom where she works,
Hegis kept her composure but "it took some getting
used to."
First Lessons
Patience and the acceptance of small improvements
in the kids are the first lessons Hegis and the other
volunteers learned.
Senior Evan Laughlin spends most of his time with
Ronny, a child who is completely non-communicative
and unable to perform the simplest tasks. Laughlin is
teaching him how to dress himself.
The process is long and slow but not without
results. "Even if you just teach him how to put his
shirt on, it's something," Laughlin says. In some ways,
he thinks, it can be more significant than teaching a
normal child how to read.
The children at PCC range in age from three to 18
