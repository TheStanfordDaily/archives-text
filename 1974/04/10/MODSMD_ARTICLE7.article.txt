## 'Sweet Nothings' 
### 
Traditionally the things a young man whispers in his girl
friend's ear during a moonlit night have been referred to as
"sweet nothings." That seems an appropriate term to apply
to the many promises aspiring ASSU politicians are flinging
about these days.
Regardless of your particular slant on the ASSU —
whether you want to expand it or scrap it — it's always wise
to keep in mind that Stanford politicians are generally no
different than the professional variety that populate the real
world. They frequently pledge far more than they can
reasonably hope to deliver.
Is there, for instance, currently a Women's Studies
Institute at Stanford? Are lecture outlines distributed "in all
lecture classes"? Has Tresidder established "a grocery store,
a discount record store, dry cleaning services and
pharmaceutical services"? the ASSU sponsor an
off-campus housing service? Does Stanford have "a student
judicial system that recognizes all rights guaranteed by the
Constitution"?
All of these promises are taken right out of the current
O'Grady council's campaign literature from last year. None
of them have been kept, whether through inactivity or
insurmountable difficulties.
The purpose here is not necessarily to attack the O'Grady
council; we are not labeling it as any worse—or any
better—than any other group of student politicians. The
purpose is to point out most of the things current candidates
are promising will never be realized either. All that glitters is
not feasible.
So remember, no matter who you're thinking of voting
for this week, that the more skeptically you approach
politicians, the wiser your ultimate choice will be.
