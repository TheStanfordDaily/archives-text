Glenn Holland

The Stanford Housing Office
takes this opportunity to present
information about four new
theme houses whose descriptive
critiques arrived too late for
inclusion in the Spring Draw
booklet. It is hoped that
interested students will get in
touch with the officials of each
house for further information.
Shi Pig House: Now that the
days of crazy student activists are
over and nostalgia for the good
old days of the fifties is all the
rage, Shi Pig offers a return to
traditional fraternity values and
activities.
These include all night bull
sessions, gross-outs, pantie raids,
making out, mooning the townies,
drinking beer, and barfing in the
Quad. Traditional menu features
cream chip beef on toast. If
you're man enough to go to
college, you're man enough to be
a Shi Pig! Contact Jock Strapp,
Head House Honcho.
NOW House: Now that the
days of misguided and
over-zealous student radicals are
over, it's time for more
progressive ways to express
ourselves in service to the
community and good times in a
communal brotherhood.
Broad Spectrum
NOW House, a fraternal living
unit for men, will sponser a broad
spectrum of activities of interest
to the modern college man,
including heavy rap sessions that
go on until dawn, various
endurance contests, impromptu
laundry service at selected
women's houses, developing
meaningful relationships with
women, streaking, smoking dope,
and food recycling in the Quad. If
you're modern enough to go to
college, you're modern enough for
NOW. Contact Activities
Chairperson.
Rod McKuen House: Now that
the days of anti-intellectual
student revolutionaries are over,

it's time for Stanford students to
be offered a truly intellectual and
stimulating atmosphere in which
to live. If you pass our rigorous
entrance examhation and take
ten units of house seminars pa
quarter, you will be eligible to live
with others of your unique mental
astuteness.
Activities include mlightening
lectures on the state of our
intercoastal waterways and the
plight of the snowy egret,nightly
comparisons of academic progress,
and weekly readings of the poetic
works of minor authors in obscure
languages. A felicitous living
environment for a person like
yourself. Contact Phil Betakapa,
Screening Official.
Xenophon House
Xenophon House: Now that
the days of punk middle class
student pseudo-revolutionaries are
over, it's time for Third World
peoples to get it together in their
own living unit. For minority
groups that as yet have no
residence of their own, Xenophon
offers an exclusive community, or
rather, communities. Depending
on the size of the group involved,
each ethnic minority will receive
its own wing, hallway, room, or
closet to decorate in such a way as
to promote the individual culture
and warn the other groups in the
house to keep out.
Xenophon house offers an
excellent opportunity to eliminate
any chance of having to associate
with anyone who isn't just like
you. Contact Mbutu O'Herlihey,
Head Xenophobe.
As usual, the Housing Office is
at your service. Those not wishing
to participate in the Draw will be
released from their contract upon
ceding to the office their first
born male child. And then you
can try to find a place to live in
Palo Alto, you poor bastard.
