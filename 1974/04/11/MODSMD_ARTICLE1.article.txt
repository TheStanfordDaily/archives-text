# Doctor May File Against Health Dept.
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
A Palo Alto physician, facing
disciplinary action for dispensing a
controversial drug to his cancer patient
at Stanford Hospital, said yesterday
he'll file suit against the state health
department and its cancer advisory
commission.
The physician, Dr. Stewart ML
Jones, charges restraint of trade and
monopoly and also plans to file
separate suit against 10 top health
department officials for malfeasance in
public office.
Jones, 55, may lose his medical
license for administering the drug
Laetrile to terminal cancer patient
Josephine Bergman, a 47-year-old
housewife of Los Altos.
Jones, a Stanford Medical School
graduate, was notified last week by the
state attorney general's office that he
has been charged by the State Board
of Medical Examiners with improperly
dispensing the drug, also known as
Vitamin 817.
Doctor Resigned
Meanwhile, one member of that
board, Hayward physician Julius
Levine, who suffers from cancer, has
resigned from the medical board after
it was disclosed he had been treating
his own cancer with Laetrile,
according to Jones.
The letter of resignation gives no
reason for his departure and Levine
refuses to discuss it with reporters.
When asked why Levine resigned,
Raymond Reid, executive secretary to
the medical board, said, "Dr. Levine
didn't want to bring any discredit on
the board."
Laetrile is banned as a cancer
treatment by the Food and Drug
Administration and the State
Department of Public Health.
However, the drug, obtained from
peach and apricot pits, is approved for
use as a nutrition supplement in
California.
Medically Unethical
Reid said the laws prohibiting the
use of the drug do not forbid a doctor
from taking the drug himself, but
Jones disagreed saying they do. Jones
added that it is medically unethical for
a physician to treat himself for a
serious illness.
"According to the news stories, Dr.
Levine admitted to being guilty of the
charge that is currently made falsely
against me—the use of Laetrile to treat
cancer by a physician.
"Secondly, if he has belief in
Laetrile sufficiently to break the law
by treating himself for cancer with it,
then he is also guilty of abdicating the
Hypocratic Oath if he has withheld it
from any cancer patients of his own."
Many Patients
Jones said he continues to give
Laetrile to many cancer patients
including his mother. He says that he
dispenses the drug not as a treatment
for cancer but to overcome a
nutritional deficiency.
However Jones contends that the
cancer in his mother's neck "has been
controlled for over a year, because she
is taking Laetrile.
"I would give up my practice
before I would stop giving the drug to
her."
No Date
No date for a hearing has been set
on the charges levied against Jones.
Jones, in addition to filing suits against
the health department, is filing a
petition to repeal the law banning
Laetrile on the grounds that the law is
unconstitutional and "its adoption was
a fraudulent and genocidal thing to
do."

Administration and the State
Department of Public Health.
However, the drug, obtained from
peach and apricot pits, is approved for
use as a nutrition supplement in
California.
Medically Unethical
Reid said the laws prohibiting the
use of the drug do not forbid a doctor
from taking the drug himself, but
Jones disagreed saying they do. Jones
added that it is medically unethical for
a physician to treat himself for a
serious illness.
"According to the news stories, Dr.
Levine admitted to being guilty of the
charge that is currently made falsely
against me—the use of Laetrile to treat
cancer by a physician.
"Secondly, if he has belief in
Laetrile sufficiently to break the law
by treating himself for cancer with it,
then he is also guilty of abdicating the
Hypocratic Oath if he has withheld it
from any cancer patients of his own."
Many Patients
Jones said he continues to give
Laetrile to many cancer patients
including his mother. He says that he
dispenses the drug not as a treatment
for cancer but to overcome a
nutritional deficiency.
However Jones contends that the
cancer in his mother's neck "has been
controlled for over a year, because she
is taking Laetrile.
"I would give up my practice
before I would stop giving the drug to
her."
No Date
No date for a hearing has been set
on the charges levied against Jones.
Jones, in addition to filing suits against
the health department, is filing a
petition to repeal the law banning
Laetrile on the grounds that the law is
unconstitutional and "its adoption was
a fraudulent and genocidal thing to
do."
A Palo Alto physician, facing
disciplinary action for dispensing a
controversial drug to his cancer patient
at Stanford Hospital, said yesterday
he'll file suit against the state health
department and its cancer advisory
commission.
The physician, Dr. Stewart ML
Jones, charges restraint of trade and
monopoly and also plans to file
separate suit against 10 top health
department officials for malfeasance in
public office.
Jones, 55, may lose his medical
license for administering the drug
Laetrile to terminal cancer patient
Josephine Bergman, a 47-year-old
housewife of Los Altos.
Jones, a Stanford Medical School
graduate, was notified last week by the
state attorney general's office that he
has been charged by the State Board
of Medical Examiners with improperly
dispensing the drug, also known as
Vitamin 817.
Doctor Resigned
Meanwhile, one member of that
board, Hayward physician Julius
Levine, who suffers from cancer, has
resigned from the medical board after
it was disclosed he had been treating
his own cancer with Laetrile,
according to Jones.
The letter of resignation gives no
reason for his departure and Levine
refuses to discuss it with reporters.
When asked why Levine resigned,
Raymond Reid, executive secretary to
the medical board, said, "Dr. Levine
didn't want to bring any discredit on
the board."
Laetrile is banned as a cancer
treatment by the Food and Drug
Administration and the State
Department of Public Health.
However, the drug, obtained from
peach and apricot pits, is approved for
