# Rhodesia-- Unjust Land Seizures
## 
### 
Bill Evers

I would like to add a few comments to the
discussion of Rhodesia in Charles Ogletree's
article in the April 5 Daily.
The history of European conquest of and
rule over African Rhodesians is a history of
continual theft by Europeans of land
belonging to Africans.
In addition to this massive land seizure,
during the last 40 years there has been a fully
developed system of racial segregation in land
ownership, in which sections of the country
are designated as for whites or for blacks.
In recent years, this policy of land
assignment led to a dramatic confrontation
between the Rhodesian government and
African peasants who refused to leave the
land they and their forefathers had occupied
and cultivated.
Forcible Uprooting
In the late 19605, the Rhodesian
government had to use troops and police to
expropriate the land of the Tangwena people
in the Inyanga area. The Rhodesian
government uprooted forcibly approximately
300 families (approximately 3000 people) in
this removal operation.
The roots of this problem lie in the
activities of some of the early European
colonists in Rhodesia. Dr. Jim Jameson was
an administrator for the British South Africa
Company, a mercantilist entity created by
Cecil Rhodes. Under Jameson's rule in
Rhodesia, large tracts and vast estates were
granted to aristocratic young blades in
England. These tracts became the holdings of
absentee-landowning companies.
Jameson not only parcelled out these
tracts in the manner of a feudal chieftain, he
also paid no attention to whether such land

was occupied by Africans and happily shared
in the looting of Ndebele cattle.
Injustices Recognized
By the turn of the century, some
sentiment had developed in England that
recognized that grave injustices were being
done to the Africans in Rhodesia. But the
attitude was one of paternalistically regarding
the Africans as wards rather than one of
defending the African's full rights and
liberties. Some areas were provisionally set
aside to cushion the effects of change on
tribal life.
Dr. Robin Palmer notes that "by 1914 the
Colonial Office [in London] was resigned to
the fact that it could do little to prevent the
eviction of Africans from European farms."
From this time on, one finds the informal
policy of racial segregation of land areas.
What had originally been an area temporarily
designated as a tribal backwater, now became
an area which was viewed as the only place
Africans were to be given any privileges at all.
Although constitutionally an African in
Rhodesia at this time was supposed to be
able to "acquire, hold, encumber, and
dispose of land on the same conditions" as a
European, in fact the British South Africa
Company refused to allow Africans to buy
land.
European Rhodesian Fear
By the late 19205, the self-governing
European Rhodesians became afraid that
middle-class African farmers interested in
cash-crop agriculture would press to exercise
their constitutional right to own land outside
of the segregated tribal areas.
In response to these white attitudes, a
Land Apportionment Act was passed in 1930

formally segregating land ownership in the
country.
The Tangwena people and their cheif
Rekayi were among the last victims of this
Land Apportionment Act.
In 1969, the Rhodesian government
revised and revamped, the system of
possessory segregation. The parliament of lan
Smith's government scrapped the old law and
passed a Land Tenure Act and the Tribal
Trust Land Development Act.
Intensive Development
Under the latter act a Tribal Trust Lands
Development Corporation is authorized by
the government to undertake intensive
development of the Tribal Trust Land.
An August, 1973, publication of the
African nationalist Zimbabwe African
Peoples' Union points out that "at no stage
of the corporation's future is it envisaged
that freehold title will pass" to individual
African peasants or to a group of African
peasants.
An information booklet put out by the
Rhodesian government emphasizes correctly
the intensity of feeling about land: "Both
here and abroad there is a tendency ... to
believe that Africans have had a raw deal over
land. There is no doubt that this is one of
their most deeply emotional grievances and
agitators have used it to stir up opposition
against the government."
The trouble is not the agitators, but that
the Rhodesian government has absolutely no
intention of rectifying what the Africans
rightly perceive as injustices.

Company, a mercantilist entity created by
Cecil Rhodes. Under Jameson's rule in
Rhodesia, large tracts and vast estates were
granted to aristocratic young blades in
England. These tracts became the holdings of
absentee-landowning companies.
Jameson not only parcelled out these
tracts in the manner of a feudal chieftain, he
also paid no attention to whether such land

was occupied by Africans and happily shared
in the looting of Ndebele cattle.
Injustices Recognized
By the turn of the century, some
sentiment had developed in England that
recognized that grave injustices were being
done to the Africans in Rhodesia. But the
attitude was one of paternalistically regarding
the Africans as wards rather than one of
defending the African's full rights and
liberties. Some areas were provisionally set
aside to cushion the effects of change on
tribal life.
Dr. Robin Palmer notes that "by 1914 the
Colonial Office [in London] was resigned to
the fact that it could do little to prevent the
eviction of Africans from European farms."
From this time on, one finds the informal
policy of racial segregation of land areas.
What had originally been an area temporarily
designated as a tribal backwater, now became
an area which was viewed as the only place
Africans were to be given any privileges at all.
Although constitutionally an African in
Rhodesia at this time was supposed to be
able to "acquire, hold, encumber, and
dispose of land on the same conditions" as a
European, in fact the British South Africa
Company refused to allow Africans to buy
land.
European Rhodesian Fear
By the late 19205, the self-governing
European Rhodesians became afraid that
middle-class African farmers interested in
cash-crop agriculture would press to exercise
their constitutional right to own land outside
of the segregated tribal areas.
In response to these white attitudes, a
Land Apportionment Act was passed in 1930

formally segregating land ownership in the
country.
The Tangwena people and their cheif
Rekayi were among the last victims of this
Land Apportionment Act.
In 1969, the Rhodesian government
revised and revamped, the system of
possessory segregation. The parliament of lan
Smith's government scrapped the old law and
passed a Land Tenure Act and the Tribal
Trust Land Development Act.
Intensive Development
Under the latter act a Tribal Trust Lands
Development Corporation is authorized by
the government to undertake intensive
development of the Tribal Trust Land.
An August, 1973, publication of the
African nationalist Zimbabwe African
Peoples' Union points out that "at no stage
of the corporation's future is it envisaged
that freehold title will pass" to individual
African peasants or to a group of African
peasants.
An information booklet put out by the
Rhodesian government emphasizes correctly
the intensity of feeling about land: "Both
here and abroad there is a tendency ... to
believe that Africans have had a raw deal over
land. There is no doubt that this is one of
their most deeply emotional grievances and
agitators have used it to stir up opposition
against the government."
The trouble is not the agitators, but that
the Rhodesian government has absolutely no
intention of rectifying what the Africans
rightly perceive as injustices.

I would like to add a few comments to the
discussion of Rhodesia in Charles Ogletree's
article in the April 5 Daily.
The history of European conquest of and
rule over African Rhodesians is a history of
continual theft by Europeans of land
belonging to Africans.
In addition to this massive land seizure,
during the last 40 years there has been a fully
developed system of racial segregation in land
ownership, in which sections of the country
are designated as for whites or for blacks.
In recent years, this policy of land
assignment led to a dramatic confrontation
between the Rhodesian government and
African peasants who refused to leave the
land they and their forefathers had occupied
and cultivated.
Forcible Uprooting
In the late 19605, the Rhodesian
government had to use troops and police to
expropriate the land of the Tangwena people
in the Inyanga area. The Rhodesian
government uprooted forcibly approximately
300 families (approximately 3000 people) in
this removal operation.
The roots of this problem lie in the
activities of some of the early European
colonists in Rhodesia. Dr. Jim Jameson was
an administrator for the British South Africa
Company, a mercantilist entity created by
Cecil Rhodes. Under Jameson's rule in
