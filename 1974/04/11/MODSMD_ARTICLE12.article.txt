# Support ASSU Speakers' Bureau

Every spring, candidates for
the ASSU Council of Presidents
promise the Stanford community
three things: the moon, the stars,
and a Speakers' Bureau. Amidst a
host of high-flung promises,
Presidential hopefuls vow they
will build a lasting program to
bring prominent speakers before a
Stanford audience.
But inevitably, the
establishment of the program
takes low priority after the
election, and the Speakers' Bureau
lasts no longer than the Council of
Presidents that tried to establish
it.
Fortunately, the Stanford
community need no longer rely
on empty campaign promises.
Recent action by the student
Senate has for the first time
established the Speakers' Bureau
within the ASSU by-laws. The
Bureau will now become a
continuing facet of ASSU
administration.
The program will be unaffected
by annual changes in the Council
of Presidents: a few key personnel
will continue in the program from
year to year; with them will
continue the expertise developed
through experience. The Speakers'
Bureau will thus achieve and
maintain a high degree of
professionalism in the
presentation of speaking events on
campus.
First Step
The first step in the
establishment of a "professional"
speakers' program at Stanford was
an extensive recruitment
campaign, carried out earlier this
year. Many concerned and
qualified students now staff the
Bureau; among their
accomplishments have been
progress on the following
proposals:

1) Co-sponsorship of speaking
events with student organizations.
Contacts are being made with
representatives of various student
organizations on campus. By
working with groups in a variety
of specialities, the Bureau will
present a broad spectrum of ideas
and issues on campus.
2) "Guests-in-Residence"
Program. Houses and dormitories
on campus are being surveyed to
guage the facilities available for
the "Guests-in-Residence"
Program. Potential
guests-in-residence have been
contacted, and several have
accepted invitations for later in
the year.
3) Coordination with the
University. Countless faculty and
staff members, representing a
variety of interests, would make
fascinating speakers for the
Stanford audience; unfortunately,
there is no simple way to find out
about all such talented
individuals. Thus, contacts are
being made within each
department to fully exploit the
resources the University has to
offer the program.
Coordination Necessary
4) Coordination with existing
programs. Many stimulating
speaking events are presented on
campus regularly, but due to
inadequate planning or publicity,
most of the Stanford community
never hears about them. The
Bureau is thus organizing a central
calendar which will publicize all
speaking events on campus,
regardless of their sponsor.
This is just a sample of what is
being done as necessary
groundwork for the Speakers
Bureau's activities; there is much
more that needs to be done in the
coming year. But many speakers
have already been invited to the

Stanford campus, and the Bureau
will be sponsoring several speaking
events this fall.
There is only one major
problem limiting the number of
speakers which the Bureau can
sponsor —money. Most speakers
demand tremendous fees for a
visit to the campus — $2000 plus
expenses, on the average. The
least costly speakers will contract
for simple expenses, but these
alone are at least $500.
Large Costs Cited
And of course, there are large
costs involved in arranging any
speaking engagement: building use
fees, publicity costs and salaries
for supporting personnel can run
into hundreds of dollars.

The limited funds that the
Bureau now has can finance only
a few speaking engagements. But a
one dollar fee assessment,
refundable to any student on
request, will give the Speakers'
Bureau the money it needs to
bring large numbers of stimulating
visitors to the campus.
A dollar which you might have
spent on a campus flick will give
you free admission to a virtually
limitless number of speaking
events throughout the coming
academic year. I strongly urge
your "YES" vote on the Speakers'
Bureau Fee Assessment, April 17
and 18.
