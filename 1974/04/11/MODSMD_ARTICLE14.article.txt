# Wages And Women
## 
### 
Linda Crousei

For eight hours of work "a
California woman makes less than
50 cents for every $1 earned
by a man." A state commission, in
fact, found it "shocking" that
"the earnings gap between men
and women is actually increasing"
as only a couple of years ago
women took home 56 cents for
every dollar a man did.
The situation is similar at
Stanford. Figures from a recent
Stanford childcare report give at
least a rough idea of the wage gap
at the Medical Center. Fully a
third of the women earned $5500
or less, and almost none earned
over $10,000. Over 40 percent of
the men, however, earned
$11,000 or more.
Those who don't take this gap
seriously should consider two
things. First, most women who
work, have to work, according to
the Department of Labor. Second,
low wages for any group holds
down wages for everybody. In our
office for example, out of five
women, one is single, one is
married, and three are single heads
of families.
One is trying to support herself
and three children on $493 per
month, and another, a black
woman, is trying to support
herself and her daughter on $400
per month.
Administration Offer
What is the administration
offering as a solution to this
problem? What are they proposing
for "Affirmative Action" in our
first union contract?
"The union is informed about
the equal employment
opportunity policy of Stanford
University, and the Affirmative
Action program associated
therewith, and agrees to cooperate
in achieving the goals and
objectives of that program."
In other words, the
administration will allow us to
cooperate with their existing
Affirmative Action program. (The
union will have no voice.) The
administration, moreover,
promises not to violate state and
federal laws against
discrimination. Whoopie.
No Change
What their proposal means is
no change at all. In negotiations
they said they feel their program
is good enough. Women,
minorities affected by the same
program, and other workers, will
have to decide at the April 11
union meeting whether to accept
the administration's non-offer, or
whether we're prepared to fight
for something better.
It should be clear from the
news recently that those workers
willing to fight have won some
minimal needs. San Francisco
SEIU workers, for example, many
of them women, won a $55 per
month increase for everybody,
and a dental plan, among other
things.
We must recognize that in fact
we, too, have the power to win
something better. Many of us feel
helpless about the oil crisis, the
War, food prices, Watergate, etc.
It all seems very big. Well here,
WE make this place run. The
physical plant is run, supplies
unloaded, computers operated,
mail delivered, lab glassware
washed and lab animals cared for
by workers in the unit and in the
union.
Years Of Work
If you take the years of work
we have put into the University,
and if you*remember that a large
chunk of the University's
three-quarters of a billion dollars
of assets comes from our work —
there's hardly an inch on the
campus that hasn't been built,
maintained or operated by labor
then one thing is clear: we have a
right to far more than poverty
level wages, headaches over dental
bills, or medical bills for our
children, or pensions too small to
live on, or worries about the rent,
or outrageous discrimination
against women and minorities. In
fact, we have a right to a hell of a
lot more than we're asking for in
the contract.
The question, then, isn't
whether we have a right to what
we need, or whether we have the
power to win it. The question is
whether we're willing to use that
power.

or outrageous discrimination
against women and minorities. In
fact, we have a right to a hell of a
lot more than we're asking for in
the contract.
The question, then, isn't
whether we have a right to what
we need, or whether we have the

whether we're willing to use that
power.

For eight hours of work "a
California woman makes less than
50 cents for every $1 earned
by a man." A state commission, in
fact, found it "shocking" that
"the earnings gap between men
and women is actually increasing"
as only a couple of years ago
women took home 56 cents for
every dollar a man did.
The situation is similar at
Stanford. Figures from a recent
Stanford childcare report give at
least a rough idea of the wage gap
at the Medical Center. Fully a
third of the women earned $5500
or less, and almost none earned
over $10,000. Over 40 percent of
the men, however, earned
$11,000 or more.
Those who don't take this gap
seriously should consider two
things. First, most women who
work, have to work, according to
the Department of Labor. Second,
low wages for any group holds
down wages for everybody. In our
office for example, out of five
women, one is single, one is
married, and three are single heads
of families.
One is trying to support herself
and three children on $493 per
month, and another, a black
woman, is trying to support
herself and her daughter on $400
per month.
Administration Offer
What is the administration
offering as a solution to this
problem? What are they proposing
for "Affirmative Action" in our
first union contract?
"The union is informed about
the equal employment
opportunity policy of Stanford
University, and the Affirmative
Action program associated
therewith, and agrees to cooperate
in achieving the goals and
objectives of that program."
In other words, the
administration will allow us to
cooperate with their existing
Affirmative Action program. (The
union will have no voice.) The
administration, moreover,
promises not to violate state and
federal laws against
discrimination. Whoopie.
No Change
What their proposal means is
no change at all. In negotiations
they said they feel their program
is good enough. Women,
minorities affected by the same
program, and other workers, will
have to decide at the April 11
union meeting whether to accept
the administration's non-offer, or
whether we're prepared to fight
for something better.
It should be clear from the
news recently that those workers
willing to fight have won some
minimal needs. San Francisco
SEIU workers, for example, many
of them women, won a $55 per
month increase for everybody,
and a dental plan, among other
things.
We must recognize that in fact
we, too, have the power to win
something better. Many of us feel
helpless about the oil crisis, the
War, food prices, Watergate, etc.
It all seems very big. Well here,
WE make this place run. The
physical plant is run, supplies
unloaded, computers operated,
mail delivered, lab glassware
washed and lab animals cared for
by workers in the unit and in the
union.
Years Of Work
If you take the years of work
we have put into the University,
and if you*remember that a large
chunk of the University's
three-quarters of a billion dollars
of assets comes from our work —
there's hardly an inch on the
campus that hasn't been built,
maintained or operated by labor
then one thing is clear: we have a
right to far more than poverty
level wages, headaches over dental
bills, or medical bills for our
children, or pensions too small to
live on, or worries about the rent,
or outrageous discrimination
against women and minorities. In
fact, we have a right to a hell of a
lot more than we're asking for in
the contract.
The question, then, isn't
whether we have a right to what
we need, or whether we have the
power to win it. The question is
