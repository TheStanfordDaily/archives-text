# Money Woes Force Calley Job Search
## 
### 
FT. BENNING, Ga. (AP) -
Army Lt. William L. Calley, Jr.,
whose tiny apartment was his jail
cell for three years, is enjoying
restricted freedom but feels his
financial woes must soon force
him to take a civilian job.
"He has no income now from
the Army and he's right at the end
of his financial rope," says
Calley's local civilian attorney,
Kenneth Henson. "He's reached
the decision he's going to have to
find some type of employment,
notwithstanding Army
restrictions."
Calley, 30, convicted three
years ago in the My Lai massacre,
was freed Feb. 27 by a federal
judge in nearby Columbus in his
own recognizance. He told Judge
J. Robert Elliott that he wanted
to work, to live and to make
money for legal appeals.
Calley's lawyers say, however,
that they are still unclear on his
status as a military prisoner. They
say the Army will not let him take
a job, although he has had many
offers; but he was permitted
recently to visit his sisters in
Florida.
Since he was freed, the Army
has quit paying the $111 a month
rent and utilities it paid while he
was imprisoned in his apartment.
Friends say Calley has had to sell
his boat and his old foreign car to
raise money.
"It seems to us what the Army
is doing, in effect, is imprisoning
Lt. Calley; doing indirectly what
they can't do directly," says
Henson. 'They are refusing to pay
him, they are not releasing him on
any kind of leave status. They are
not assigning him any duties nor
adequately explaining his status.
"Yet they are restricting his
freedom of movement and his
freedom to earn a living."
Henson said he and Calley's
other lawyers have requested
administrative leave, which would
allow him to get a job.
The Army refuses comment.
"All I can say is he is a
convicted military prisoner on
bail," says a spokesman at Ft.
Benning.
Calley and his auburn-haired
girlfriend, Ann Moore,
occasionally dine out, friends say.
Miss Moore was given his power of
attorney while he was imprisoned

so she could visit him daily and
handle his shopping and
secretarial chores.
Free now of restrictions on
visitors, Calley has entertained a
few friends and makes some visits.
He drinks occasionally — a
privilege denied him during his
imprisonment — and he has back
his padded bar. But he no longer
has the parties he had before his
trial.

own recognizance. He told Judge
J. Robert Elliott that he wanted
to work, to live and to make
money for legal appeals.
Calley's lawyers say, however,
that they are still unclear on his
status as a military prisoner. They
say the Army will not let him take
a job, although he has had many
offers; but he was permitted
recently to visit his sisters in
Florida.
Since he was freed, the Army
has quit paying the $111 a month
rent and utilities it paid while he
was imprisoned in his apartment.
Friends say Calley has had to sell
his boat and his old foreign car to
raise money.
"It seems to us what the Army
is doing, in effect, is imprisoning
Lt. Calley; doing indirectly what
they can't do directly," says
Henson. 'They are refusing to pay
him, they are not releasing him on
any kind of leave status. They are
not assigning him any duties nor
adequately explaining his status.
"Yet they are restricting his
freedom of movement and his
freedom to earn a living."
Henson said he and Calley's
other lawyers have requested
administrative leave, which would
allow him to get a job.
The Army refuses comment.
"All I can say is he is a
convicted military prisoner on
bail," says a spokesman at Ft.
Benning.
Calley and his auburn-haired
girlfriend, Ann Moore,

attorney while he was imprisoned

FT. BENNING, Ga. (AP) -
Army Lt. William L. Calley, Jr.,
whose tiny apartment was his jail
cell for three years, is enjoying
restricted freedom but feels his
financial woes must soon force
him to take a civilian job.
"He has no income now from
the Army and he's right at the end
of his financial rope," says
Calley's local civilian attorney,
Kenneth Henson. "He's reached
the decision he's going to have to
find some type of employment,
notwithstanding Army
restrictions."
Calley, 30, convicted three
years ago in the My Lai massacre,
was freed Feb. 27 by a federal
judge in nearby Columbus in his
own recognizance. He told Judge
J. Robert Elliott that he wanted
to work, to live and to make
money for legal appeals.
Calley's lawyers say, however,
that they are still unclear on his
status as a military prisoner. They
say the Army will not let him take
a job, although he has had many
offers; but he was permitted
recently to visit his sisters in
Florida.
Since he was freed, the Army
