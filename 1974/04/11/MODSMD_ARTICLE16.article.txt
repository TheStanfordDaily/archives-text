The American Geophysical
Union's (AGU) 1974 James B.
Macelwane Award "in recognition
of significant contributions to the
geophysical sciences by a young
scientist of outstanding ability"
was presented to Asst. Prof, of
Geophysics Amos M. Nur, 36, at
the annual meeting of the AGU in
Washington D.C., Tuesday.
Nur was cited for "his study of
velocities in low-porosity
crystalline rocks, in particular the
role of pore fluids, [which]
provided the conceptual
framework for explaining
percursory phenomena of
earthquakes and led to the Nur
[dilatancy] hypothesis of
earthquake prediction. The
dilatancy hypothesis is now the
working framework for much of
the earthquake prediction
research in this country."
Born in Israel, Nur received the
bachelor's degree from Hebrew
University and then earned the
Ph.D. at MIT. He served in the
Israeli army from 1957 to 1960,
and has explored for minerals in
soutiern Israel and carried out
geological mapping of the Swiss
Alps.
