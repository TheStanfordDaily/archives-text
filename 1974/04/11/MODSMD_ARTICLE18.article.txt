# A 						SHORT QUARTERLY REPORT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OMBUDSMAN
## 
### 
The charge to the Ombudsman closes with the sen
tence, "He (the Ombudsman) reports at least annually to
the University community and to the President, and it is
anticipated that, at the Ombudsman's discretion, his
reports may be brief and general."
For the first time the incumbent Ombudsman will
heed the admonition that his reports "may be brief." In
previous quarterly reports the philosophy of the incum
bent Ombudsman has been set forth. He has tried to
describe his method of operation, and the scope and
limitations of the office have been detailed. In disguised
form some sample cases (vignettes) have been reported
or described. It does not seem useful to repeat any of
those things in this report.
The Ombudsman's office is located on the second
floor (Room 85) in Building 80 on the inner Quad. The
telephone extension is 3682. The office is open from 8
a.m. to noon and I to 5 p.m. through Friday. The
secretary-assistant, Sara Stephenson, is almost always
there during those hours.
The Ombudsman, Harvey Hall, is usually there, too,
although he may be out of the office investigating some
previous matter. If you are involved in some trouble
some intra-campus matter, please telephone, drop in, or
write to us. If we can't help, we shall at least be glad to
talk the matter over and perhaps we can refer you to
someone who can.
Some statistics: Statistics are not really a very good
way of showing what goes on in the office, but we can
think of none better, other than to include more vi
gnettes. For one thing, some matters may be taken care
of in just a few minutes, whereas others may require a
good many hours.
For another, the rather crude categories may not
really reveal accurately what is actually happening. Wide
ly different kinds of matters can be blanketed by the
bland word "academic." For another, the classifying of
cases by categories is necessarily arbitrary. For instance,
if a student seeks the return of a $50 housing deposit, is
that "financial" or "housing?"
The table below shows comparative figures by type of
individual and by subject. There were a few more
matters brought to the office in the winter than there
were in the fall, but fewer matters, both fall and winter
than in the corresponding quarters in the academic year
1972-73.

some intra-campus matter, please telephone, drop in, or
write to us. If we can't help, we shall at least be glad to
talk the matter over and perhaps we can refer you to
someone who can.
Some statistics: Statistics are not really a very good
way of showing what goes on in the office, but we can
think of none better, other than to include more vi
gnettes. For one thing, some matters may be taken care
of in just a few minutes, whereas others may require a
good many hours.
For another, the rather crude categories may not
really reveal accurately what is actually happening. Wide
ly different kinds of matters can be blanketed by the
bland word "academic." For another, the classifying of
cases by categories is necessarily arbitrary. For instance,
if a student seeks the return of a $50 housing deposit, is
that "financial" or "housing?"
The table below shows comparative figures by type of
individual and by subject. There were a few more
matters brought to the office in the winter than there
were in the fall, but fewer matters, both fall and winter
than in the corresponding quarters in the academic year
1972-73.

The charge to the Ombudsman closes with the sen
tence, "He (the Ombudsman) reports at least annually to
the University community and to the President, and it is
anticipated that, at the Ombudsman's discretion, his
reports may be brief and general."
For the first time the incumbent Ombudsman will
heed the admonition that his reports "may be brief." In
previous quarterly reports the philosophy of the incum
bent Ombudsman has been set forth. He has tried to
describe his method of operation, and the scope and
limitations of the office have been detailed. In disguised
form some sample cases (vignettes) have been reported
or described. It does not seem useful to repeat any of
those things in this report.
The Ombudsman's office is located on the second
floor (Room 85) in Building 80 on the inner Quad. The
telephone extension is 3682. The office is open from 8
a.m. to noon and I to 5 p.m. through Friday. The
secretary-assistant, Sara Stephenson, is almost always
there during those hours.
The Ombudsman, Harvey Hall, is usually there, too,
although he may be out of the office investigating some
previous matter. If you are involved in some trouble
some intra-campus matter, please telephone, drop in, or
