# Young, Bloomfield, Naftalin Give 'Near-Perfect' Evening
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
It is hard to imagine a more
relaxing way to spend an evening
than listening to a Jesse Colin
Young concert. The one Monday
night in Mem Aud was no
exception.
Even more than in his days
with the Youngbloods, Young has
found a near-perfect level of
medium-energy music to go with
his Marin County ridgetop
lifestyle. Backed by Scott
Lawrence on keyboards, Jeffrey
Meyer on drums, Kelly Brown on
bass and Charlie McCarthy
(really!) on reeds, Young played
an hour of pleasant and satisfying
tunes in his opening show
Monday.
He began solo, playing acoustic
guitar and singing "Rye Whiskey,"
after which the band joined him
in one of the Youngbloods' finest
songs, "Sunlight." A boogie
number featuring Lawrence's
piano and McCarthy's soprano sax
followed.

Young played a few tasty
acoustic slide licks on "Walkin'
Blues," which also featured some
nice tenor sax. McCarthy is not a
flashy performer, but handles his
job of accompaniment and short
solos very well.
Most of the rest of the set was
from his latest album. Song For
Juli. His wife Sue helped with the
vocals on the title song, but was
almost inaudible. "Miss
Hesitation," with its nonsense
rhymes and good-time feel, drew
the most response from the
appreciative Mem Aud audience
which seemed to include half of
the high school-age population of
Palo Alto.
Switching to electric guitar,
Young sang "Morning Sun,"
"Ridgetop" and "T-Bone
Shuffle." The last tune included
some scat-singing along with the
guitar licks, which were not half
bad. As an encore, he sang (again
with Sue) a new tune, probably
called "Let Your Light Shine."

Jesse Colin Young seems
satisfied with his current sound,
which incorporates but never
imitates a lot of sources, and
comes out distinctively nice and
easy.
Mike Bloomfield and Mark
Naftalin, on the other hand, have
a hot band which goes straight
back to the blues roots of rock
and roll. They opened Monday's
show with an hour of the same.
Bloomfield, one of the first
young white blues guitarists, and
Naftalin, who is well-versed in
most types of American piano
music, are veterans of the
trend-setting Paul Butterfield
Blues Band. Together with bassist
Roger "Jelly Roll" Troy and
drummer George Rains, they have
one of the Bay Area's finest
resident blues-rock bands.
Their opening set began a few
minutes late (Bloomfield walked
in at 7:35 for a 7:30 show) but
wasted little time in getting down
to business. Bloomfield sang the
opener, "Mary Ann," then Troy
took over on a slow blues, "Sweet
Little Angel." With Troy's big
voice and bass solo, plus tight
guitar and piano leads, the band
went higher on this tune than
anyone has a right to that early in
a set.
Bloomfield sang another
bouncing rocker, "Linda Lou,"
then Troy took over the vocals
again with "Shadows"and Ray
Charles' classic "Unchain My
Heart." Bloomfield's guitar
backup and Naftalin's rich,
tremolo organ were a perfect
complement for Troy's intense
singing.
"Inside Information," a good
rocking tune, followed, then
Bloomfield introduced local harp

player Gary Smith, who sat in on
the last tune. The result was
predictable; a bunch of
professionals doing ten minutes or
so of sympathetic blues jam, with
solos passed around freely, is
bound to produce some good
moments, and this one did.
This may be the last
Bloomfield/Naftalin gig for a
while, however, because
Bloomfield and Troy will head for
Miami next week to record an
album with the re-united Electric

Flag, the former's short-lived band
of the late 60s. Naftalin does
expect this band to keep playing
together after the Electric Flag
sessions, and a Bloomfield/
Naftalin album is a distinct
possibility. Playing together "is
the most natural thing for us to
do," he added.
Naftalin will give a solo piano
concert in Tresidder a week from
tonight, a repeat of a couple of
successful shows last spring.

appreciative Mem Aud audience
which seemed to include half of
the high school-age population of
Palo Alto.
Switching to electric guitar,
Young sang "Morning Sun,"
"Ridgetop" and "T-Bone
Shuffle." The last tune included
some scat-singing along with the
guitar licks, which were not half
bad. As an encore, he sang (again
with Sue) a new tune, probably
called "Let Your Light Shine."

Jesse Colin Young seems
satisfied with his current sound,
which incorporates but never
imitates a lot of sources, and
comes out distinctively nice and
easy.
Mike Bloomfield and Mark
Naftalin, on the other hand, have
a hot band which goes straight
back to the blues roots of rock
and roll. They opened Monday's
show with an hour of the same.
Bloomfield, one of the first
young white blues guitarists, and
Naftalin, who is well-versed in
most types of American piano
music, are veterans of the
trend-setting Paul Butterfield
Blues Band. Together with bassist
Roger "Jelly Roll" Troy and
drummer George Rains, they have
one of the Bay Area's finest
resident blues-rock bands.
Their opening set began a few
minutes late (Bloomfield walked
in at 7:35 for a 7:30 show) but
wasted little time in getting down
to business. Bloomfield sang the
opener, "Mary Ann," then Troy
took over on a slow blues, "Sweet
Little Angel." With Troy's big
voice and bass solo, plus tight
guitar and piano leads, the band
went higher on this tune than
anyone has a right to that early in
a set.
Bloomfield sang another
bouncing rocker, "Linda Lou,"
then Troy took over the vocals
again with "Shadows"and Ray
Charles' classic "Unchain My
Heart." Bloomfield's guitar
backup and Naftalin's rich,
tremolo organ were a perfect
complement for Troy's intense
singing.
"Inside Information," a good
rocking tune, followed, then
Bloomfield introduced local harp

player Gary Smith, who sat in on
the last tune. The result was
predictable; a bunch of
professionals doing ten minutes or
so of sympathetic blues jam, with
solos passed around freely, is
bound to produce some good
moments, and this one did.
This may be the last
Bloomfield/Naftalin gig for a
while, however, because
Bloomfield and Troy will head for
Miami next week to record an
album with the re-united Electric

Flag, the former's short-lived band
of the late 60s. Naftalin does
expect this band to keep playing
together after the Electric Flag
sessions, and a Bloomfield/
Naftalin album is a distinct
possibility. Playing together "is
the most natural thing for us to
do," he added.
Naftalin will give a solo piano
concert in Tresidder a week from
tonight, a repeat of a couple of
successful shows last spring.

JESSE COLIN YOUNG
It is hard to imagine a more
relaxing way to spend an evening
than listening to a Jesse Colin
Young concert. The one Monday
night in Mem Aud was no
exception.
Even more than in his days
with the Youngbloods, Young has
found a near-perfect level of
medium-energy music to go with
his Marin County ridgetop
lifestyle. Backed by Scott
Lawrence on keyboards, Jeffrey
Meyer on drums, Kelly Brown on
bass and Charlie McCarthy
(really!) on reeds, Young played
an hour of pleasant and satisfying
tunes in his opening show
Monday.
He began solo, playing acoustic
guitar and singing "Rye Whiskey,"
after which the band joined him
in one of the Youngbloods' finest
songs, "Sunlight." A boogie
number featuring Lawrence's
piano and McCarthy's soprano sax
followed.

Young played a few tasty
acoustic slide licks on "Walkin'
Blues," which also featured some
nice tenor sax. McCarthy is not a
flashy performer, but handles his
job of accompaniment and short
solos very well.
Most of the rest of the set was
from his latest album. Song For
Juli. His wife Sue helped with the
vocals on the title song, but was
almost inaudible. "Miss
Hesitation," with its nonsense
rhymes and good-time feel, drew
the most response from the
appreciative Mem Aud audience
which seemed to include half of
the high school-age population of
Palo Alto.
Switching to electric guitar,
Young sang "Morning Sun,"
"Ridgetop" and "T-Bone
Shuffle." The last tune included
