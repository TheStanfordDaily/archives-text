# University Officials Rule African Fund Drive Illegal
## 
### BOB LOWE 
The drive to collect 10 percent of
house dues from University
dormitories for the African Famine
Relief Fund, was halted yesterday
when organizers learned that the dues
cannot be spent on activities outside
the University.
James Siena, legal adviser to
President Lyman, explained, "Our
view is that money that students have
to pay as a condition of attending here
is University money." He added that
this applied to Row houses as well as
other residences where house dues are
paid.
According to Siena, the dues can be
spent only if "some direct benefit is
flowing" to those who paid the fees.
He added that allowing a majority of
the house members to spend dues on
an outside activity would be "bad as a
policy, even if it were legal."
$5000
The African Famine Relief Fund
Committee (AFRFC) an auxiliary arm
of the African Famine Relief
Committee (AFRC), had hoped to
collect as much as $5000 through the
dorm drive.
AFRFC co-chairman sophomore
Laune Coplen said that it will be
much harder to raise the money
through individual donations. She said
she was disappointed that "there's no
way we can go through dorm funds."

Dean of the Chapel Robert
Hamerton-Kelly a strong supporter of
the drive, said, "You run into
absurdities when you stick to the
letter of the law — like you can spend
money on beer but not on starving
people."
Coplen said that members of
AFRFC would "probably go door to
door" through the dorms in an effort
to raise funds from individuals. Other
activities are also planned including a
car wash sponsored by Manzanita Park
residents, tentatively set for April 27.
Visit
Melissa Lawson, chairman of the
AFRC, visited the drought stricken
areas last summer. She said "Mali was
the hardest hit" and that "a lot of
people have moved to find more fertile
areas."
She described the people as
"walking skeletons" and said that
children had "stomachs swelling so
badly that their intestines looked like
they were bursting."
"Unless $150 million are
forthcoming in the next year, 13
million people are in danger of dying,"
Lawson said.
The AFRC will sponsor a teach-in
today with Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich
speaking on "The Sahelian Situation —
Causes and Consequences." He will
talk about the biological aspects of
Sahelia.
