# Symphony Performs Mediocre Stravinsky
## 
### KENNETH De LONG 
SAN FRANCISCO - For its
17th program of the year, the San
Francisco Symphony gave an
all-Stravinsky concert featuring
music from his neo-classic period,
but also including Movements for
Piano and Orchestra, an advanced
serial work dating from the
composer's last creative period.
This piece, demanding for both
performer and listener, was
sandwiched between two more
accessible works, the Concerto in
D for String Orchestra and the
Concerto for Piano and Wind
Instruments.
Following intermission, the
orchestra was joined by the
symphony chorus and a variety of
soloists for a performance of Les
Noces. All works except the
Concerto for String Orchestra
received their first regular series
performances. In the main, there
was little to complain about and
also little to write home about.
The performances were
workmanlike, and did justice to
these straightforward works.
Michel Beroff, a young French
pianist, was the soloist for the two
works requiring piano. His playing
was both accurate and athletic,
and his strong musicianship
contributed greatly to the success
of the performances.
Beroff's prowess was
particularly apparent in
Movements, in which his mastery
of extreme rhythmic difficulties
and feeling for the work's unusual
musical shapes made the
difference between success and
musical back-work. Ozawa was
able to lead his orchestra through
the laybrinth of shifting meters
and irregular rhythms to a
successful conclusion.

Stravinsky's Les Noces is an
unusual piece. First, it is scored
for four pianos and percussion,
chorus, and four soloists — at best
an unlikely combination. Second,
it draws its inspiration from
ancient Russian peasant wedding
ceremonies, the significance of
which are all but lost on a 20th
century American audience.
Fortunately, the work is
attractive and varied, and the
Russian qualities emerge as
pleasantly exotic and virile.
The soloists were all local and
acquitted themselves well.
Unfortunately, it was difficult to
hear the soloists in this work, a
difficulty compounded by placing
them at the back of the stage.
Marian March and Evelyn Petros
made themselves heard, but
neither Daniel Parkerson nor
Robert Klang were audible over
the din of the four pianos. In
general, the soloists needed less
"bel canto" and more "can
belto."
All four pianists — including
Stanford's own Nathan Schwartz
— were excellent. Their attacks
were crisp and accurate and their
rhythms secure in a piece
possessing many difficulties.
The chorus, gaily decked in
peasant garb, sang with vigor and
precision. The chorus has the
lion's share of the singing and
the presence of solid vocal talent
prevented demanding and exposed
passages from sounding ragged.
Nicklaus Wyss replaced an
ailing Seiji Ozawa and lead the
musical forces in a thoroughly
adequate performance. All the
music of the evening was to some
extent chamber music, and its
presentation in a large concert hall
somewhat reduced the impact of
the music.

pleasantly exotic and virile.
The soloists were all local and
acquitted themselves well.
Unfortunately, it was difficult to
hear the soloists in this work, a
difficulty compounded by placing
them at the back of the stage.
Marian March and Evelyn Petros
made themselves heard, but
neither Daniel Parkerson nor
Robert Klang were audible over
the din of the four pianos. In
general, the soloists needed less
"bel canto" and more "can
belto."
All four pianists — including
Stanford's own Nathan Schwartz
— were excellent. Their attacks
were crisp and accurate and their
rhythms secure in a piece
possessing many difficulties.
The chorus, gaily decked in
peasant garb, sang with vigor and
precision. The chorus has the
lion's share of the singing and
the presence of solid vocal talent
prevented demanding and exposed
passages from sounding ragged.
Nicklaus Wyss replaced an
ailing Seiji Ozawa and lead the
musical forces in a thoroughly
adequate performance. All the
music of the evening was to some
extent chamber music, and its
presentation in a large concert hall
somewhat reduced the impact of
the music.
SAN FRANCISCO - For its
17th program of the year, the San
Francisco Symphony gave an
all-Stravinsky concert featuring
music from his neo-classic period,
but also including Movements for
Piano and Orchestra, an advanced
serial work dating from the
composer's last creative period.
This piece, demanding for both
performer and listener, was
sandwiched between two more
accessible works, the Concerto in
D for String Orchestra and the
Concerto for Piano and Wind
Instruments.
Following intermission, the
orchestra was joined by the
symphony chorus and a variety of
soloists for a performance of Les
Noces. All works except the
Concerto for String Orchestra
received their first regular series
performances. In the main, there
was little to complain about and
also little to write home about.
The performances were
workmanlike, and did justice to
these straightforward works.
Michel Beroff, a young French
pianist, was the soloist for the two
works requiring piano. His playing
was both accurate and athletic,
and his strong musicianship
contributed greatly to the success
of the performances.
Beroff's prowess was
particularly apparent in
Movements, in which his mastery
of extreme rhythmic difficulties
and feeling for the work's unusual
musical shapes made the
difference between success and
musical back-work. Ozawa was
able to lead his orchestra through
the laybrinth of shifting meters
and irregular rhythms to a
successful conclusion.

Stravinsky's Les Noces is an
unusual piece. First, it is scored
for four pianos and percussion,
chorus, and four soloists — at best
an unlikely combination. Second,
it draws its inspiration from
ancient Russian peasant wedding
ceremonies, the significance of
which are all but lost on a 20th
century American audience.
Fortunately, the work is
attractive and varied, and the
Russian qualities emerge as
pleasantly exotic and virile.
