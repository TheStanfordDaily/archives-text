Milk Money Moved From Safe
WASHINGTON — Watergate investigators
have evidence that somebody removed $10,000
from a bank safe-deposit box where a dairy
cooperative's lawyer says he placed the money,
offering it for use by former Treasury Secretary
John B. Connally, informed sources say.
The money was replaced later by new bills
bearing serial numbers that show they were not
in circulation at the time the original bills were
stashed away, according to two sources familiar
with the case.
Connally has said he was told the money was
put away for his political use, but he has denied
that he actually used it.
Meanwhile, columnist Jack Anderson
reported yesterday that FBI agents working for
the Watergate special prosecutor have evidence
that Connally pocketed the $10,000, then
hastily returned it after the dairy group came
under investigation.
Texas attorney Jake Jacobsen, one-time
lawyer for Associated Milk Producers Inc., has
testified that he put the money in the box for
Cdnnally and that Connally refused it.
A Watergate grand jury indicted Jacobsen for
perjury, saying he lied when he swore that the
money remained in the safe-deposit box for
nearly two and a half years until removed in the
presence of an FBI agent last Nov. 27.
Jacobsen has pleaded innocent, but the
banknote serial numbers make his testimony
logically impossible, sources say.
Anderson reported that according to FBI
sources, Connally first accepted the money,
then gave back the sum in $100 bills. Later,
worried that the bills could be traced, he
substituted smaller bills, Anderson reported.
But though the year on the bills showed they
had been printed before the original payment
was made, they had not been circulated until
after Jacobsen said the money went into the
safe-deposit box, the columnist reported.
Connally said yesterday,"I have categorically
denied I received the money, and I do so
today."
Committee May Ask Subpeona
WASHINGTON — Republican members of
the House Judiciary Committee said yesterday
the White House is risking a subpoena for tapes
of presidential conversations by delaying a
response to the committee's request for them.
The White House, given an April 9 deadline
to say whether it would deliver the tapes, said
yesterday it will provide "additional materials"
some time after April 22.
The reply angered committee members of
both parties, who met in separate caucuses in
advance of a committee meeting today in which
the possibility of issuing a subpoena will be
discussed.
"It looks like the committee will issue a
subpoena if the White House does not yield,"
said Rep. Robert McClery, R-lU., following the

Republican caucus.
He and three other Republicans said they
would support a vote for a subpoena if the
White House has not changed its position by
tomorrow.
One of them, Rep. Tom Railsback, R-111.,
said committee Republicans are "trying to work
something out" that would avoid the
constitutional crisis that could result from a
subpoena aimed at President Nixon.
Chairman Peter Rodino, D-N.J., declined to
comment after the Democratic meeting, other
than to say there was an exchange of views, with
no attempt to reach a party position.
Defense Rests In Boyle Case
MEDIA, Pa. — The defense in the murder
trial of former United Mine Workers President
W. A. "Tony" Boyle yesterday after presenting
testimony to support Boyle's claim he did not
order the murder of union rival Joseph "Jock"
Yablenski.
Both sides were to present summations and
the case was expected to go to the jury by
today. Earlier, Judge Francis Catania turned
down a defense motion for a directed verdict of
acquittal.
Four former members of the union's
International Executive Board testified
yesterday that Boyle was not in the hallway
where a key prosecution witness quoted him as
saying: "We've got to kill Yablonski, take care
of him."
That testimony had come Monday from
William Turnblazer, former president of UMW
district 19 in Middlesboro, Ky., who said the
remark was made to him and Albert Pass,
former secretary-treasurer of the district after a
meeting in Washington on June 23,1969.
Each of the four said he re-called the meeting
clearly because Yablonski had brought his
lawyer to protest his removal by Boyle from a
UMW committee.
Reinecke Pleads Not Guilty
WASHINGTON - California Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke pleaded innocent yesterday to charges
he lied about the ITT case and said there seemed
to be a good chance the trial could be held
before the state gubernatorial primary, as he
requested.
Reinecke, 50, is considered a leading
candidate for governor on the Republican
ticket.
Reinecke's attorney, F. Joseph Donohue,
asked during an arraignment hearing that the
trial be set for May 20. The gubernatorial
primary is June 4.
Donohue asked U.S. District Judge
Barrington D. Parker to move the trial, which is
expected to last not more than a week, to
California. The judge took that under
consideration.
Parker first set the trial for June 19, but said
after arguments by the defense attorney that he
would seriously consider moving it up earlier.

Reinecke's attorney said he wants the earlier
date so his client's "innocence may be
established before the primary."
"I can appreciate your request," said the
judge, "but I would imagine persons in other
cases on the docket would also like a similar
speedy trial."
Mitchell Declares Innocence
NEW YORK — Former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell testified yesterday that he intervened
just once in a Securities and Exchange
Commission fraud investigation of financier
Robert Vesco. He said his action was not to
obstruct the probe but to "further it."
"On your oath, did you do anything during
this entire period of time to fix or quash the
investigation?" the 60-year-old former law and
order man of he Nixon administration was
asked.
"No sir," replied Mitchell, the first American
since the Teapot Dome scandals of 50 years ago
to answer a criminal indictment based on his
record in the Cabinet and in politics.
The exchange was the high-light of
scatter-gun testimony by Mitchell denying
charges by former SEC chairmen William Casey
and G. Bradford Cook and ex-White House
counsel John W. Dean lll—all of whom linked
the former attorney general and ex-Commerce
Secretary Maurice Stans with Vesco's vain
attempt to beat an SEC fraud rap.
Mitchell and former Commerce Secretary
Maurice H. Stans are charged with conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and perjury. They are
accused of trying to block the SEC investigation
of Vesco in return for the financier's secret
$200,000 cash contribution to President
Nixon's re-election campaign.
Mitchell admitted under questioning by his
lawyer that he arranged a meeting between
Harry Sears, a Vesco lawyer, and Casey, then
SEC chairman, as the result of a meeting with
Sears on Feb. 12, 1972. But he denied that he
went beyond that.
Cinque- 4 A Potential Killer'
LOS ANGELES — Donald David DeFreeze,
the man believed to be Patricia Hearst's
kidnaper "Cinque," was seen as a potential killer
four years ago, a man with "a total lack of
regard for human life," court records revealed
yesterday.
The view of DeFreeze was stated by a
prosecutor at the end of the 1970
robbery-assault trial which resulted in
DeFreeze's conviction and imprisonment. He
escaped from prison in 1973.
At the same trial, DeFreeze himself said he
had been told by his wife and doctors that he
was mentally ill and claimed he had escaped
from a mental institution when he was 14.
There is no record indicating this was true, but
the judge who sentenced him recommended that

he receive psychiatric help—"a lot of it"—in
prison.
On May 18, 1970, the court records show,
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Johnson signed a final
report on DeFreeze which was submitted to the
court.
"It is the opinion of the undersigned," said
Johnson, "that this person is a high risk danger
to society and that as soon as he is released from
prison, he will return to his same violent career.
"It is my opinion, further, that this
defendant will eventually kill someone.
"The latter opinion is based upon his actions
in this case wherein he initiated a gun battle
with police officers and a security guard in order
to avoid capture. This indicates a total lack of
regard for human life."
Settlement Near In Steel Talks
WASHINGTON — A settlement appeared
near yesterday in negotiations on a three-year
contract between the United Steelworkers and
the steel industry.
"Both sides agreed to try and wrap it up
today," said one source close to the talks.
However, the source said some issues were "still
up in the air" and snags could develop.
The union's Basic Steel Industry Conference
with representatives from more than 800 locals
was summoned to a meeting today for a report
on the negotiations.
If the negotiators reach tentative agreement
by that time the pact will be submitted to the
600-member conference for ratification, a union
spokesman said.
The talks are taking place under an
experimental negotiating agreement which calls
for all unresolved issues to be submitted to
arbitration by April 15. The deadline could be
extended by mutual agreement.
USW contracts covering 350,000 workers
employed by the 10 major steel producers
expire Aug. 1.
Senate Passes Relief Bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate unanimously
passed and sent to the House yesterday a bill
providing new types of disaster aid to
communities devastated by tornadoes last week.
The House could take up the bill today
before beginning a 10-day Easter recess.
The bill was quarterbacked through the
Senate by Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., who
staved off several attempts to attach
controversial amendments to the measure.
Burdick, whose Public Works subcommittee
drafted the bill, cautioned that the measure
could lose its administration support if it
becomes burdened by amendments.
Today's Weather
Fair today and warmer through tomorrow.
Lows tonight mid 40s to low 50s. Highs today
and tomorrow mid 60s to low 70s. Northerly
winds 10 to 20 mph.
