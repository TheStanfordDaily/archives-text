## SCIRE Submits Reorganization Plan 
### CHESS ERWIN First of Two Parts 
After six months of work, the
Student Center for Innovation and
Research in Education (SCIRE) has
presented a proposal for its
reorganization in 1974-75 to Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs.
Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies B. Michael Closson declined to
comment on behalf of Gibbs saying
that Gibbs would make a statement
after meeting with the SCIRE Policy
Board.
The proposal suggests four
principals activities for SCIRE. These
include continuation of accrediting
and evaluating individual and group
courses for academic credit and three
new functions.
The proposal includes
administration of an innovation fund
to support create that would
not be funded otherwise; development

of a work/study program to provide
new educational opportunities within
the community; and establishment of
task forces to study internal University
problems and possible resolutions.
Not Dormant
Contrary to popular opinion,
SCIRE was not entirely dormant this
year. Dana Weigent, who heads SCIRE
explained SCIRE sponsored 24
projects this year. However, in
1972-72, it supported 72. She said
that some people thought that SCIRE
was "overloaded" this year
particularly in areas such as studio art
and pottery.
The SCIRE proposal also calls for
the appointment of a full-time director
and a half-time assistant to administer
the program in conjunction with the
Policy Board. The program will
continue to operate under the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
A search committee to seek the

director and his assistant will be
organized shortly. Weigent will be
leaving the program in July.
Generally Enthusiastic
The members of the Policy Board
are generally enthusiastic about the
proposal. Cary Ridder, chairwoman of
the Policy Board, said it "is a very
good proposal.
"What we're trying to do," she said,
"is to broaden the scope of SCIRE and
make it an active participant in the
University." Balancing the accrediting
functions with the new proposals for
SCIRE will "be no problem," she
continued.
Another Policy Board member,
John Mensinger stated "A lot of hard
work went into this proposal. We feel
that it incorporates a lot of good ideas
for positive and innovative
contributions to education." He added
that recently SCIRE hadn't been able
to do that but "now we can."

Closson commented, "The Policy
Board did a pretty good job putting
the proposal together." He noted it
"contained a lot of great ideas" for the
future of SCIRE.
"In some ways," continued
Closson, "the new proposal is a kind
of throwback to the original ideas of
SCIRE." In other words, the "projects
won't be the only thing that SCIRE is
concerned with."
Closson emphasized that the new
proposal "meets current needs through
things such as the task force idea."
'Crippled'
As the program now stands, it is
"crippled," he said. "What needs to be
done is to channel SCIRE into creative
work now."
Asst. Prof, of Applied Mechanics
Toby Hayes said simply, "I like the
way things are stated here." What the
Board did was a "reexamination of the
[SCIRE] program," he declared.
SCIRE has encountered problems
recently in determining what projects
should be sponsored.
Grant Academic Credit
The new proposal states "The
ability to grant academic credit raises
questions about what kinds of projects
and courses SCIRE wants to support."
Weigent remarked that large student
projects involving as many as 30
people presented such problems.
The proposal further states that
granting academic credit "is one way
that SCIRE can force the University to
examine what constitutes academically
accreditable activities and, therefore,
what should be a part of a meaningful
education."
The Other Stanford, a report on
undergraduate education prepared by
the Student Workshop on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI), enumerates
educational problems that could be
studied through the task force idea,
Ridder said. The task forces could
"help bring people together," she said,
to help solve troublesome gaps in the
curriculum.
Implementation
Mensinger pointed out that
although The Other Stanford can
expose problems and SCIRE task

Board Cary Ridder played an integral role in formulation of the new program proposal for SCIRE. The new proposal took
six months of work and involves work/study, task force, and innovation fund suggestions in addition to accreditation
student projects.
forces can suggest solutions, the
implementation of such solutions is
still a problem. Both he and Hayes
stressed the importance of
implementing suggestions if the task
forces are to be beneficial.
Closson added that the task forces
must do more than just write papers.
"Implementation [of suggested
solutions] must be kept in mind from
the outset," he explained.
"The basic problem that SCIRE
encountered last year was a lack of
communication" between parties
involved with SCIRE, Closson
acknowledged.
Improving communications
between the director, the Policy
Board, and the dean while still
"retaining the basic elements" of the
program are the basic goals of the new
proposal, Closson concluded.
