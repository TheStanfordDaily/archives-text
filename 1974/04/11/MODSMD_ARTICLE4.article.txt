# Candidates Dispute Proposals For Campaign Spending Curbs
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Despite numerous proposals to
limit campaign spending in primary
races in the 12th Congressional
District which includes Stanford,
neither Democratic nor Republican
candidates can agree upon suitable
allowances.
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey, R-Menlo
Park, and Atherton businessman J.
Gordon Knapp, his principle opponent
in the GOP primary, have been unable
to agree upon a mutual spending
limitation proposed by McCloskey.
Under McCloskey's terms each
candidate would limit his spending to
$75,000. Knapp said he was amenable
to this suggestion, but would not
accept a second part of the McCloskey

proposal that the two candidates
engage in 100 debates throughout the
district during the course of the
campaign.
In his refusal to participate in the
proposed debates, Knapp stated that
he didn't want to "let him
[McCloskey] tell me how to run my
campaign." He noted that he had
already planned to speak publicly with
McCloskey several times during the
course of the campaign.
'Well Known Millionaire'
McCloskey expressed
disappointment with Knapp's refusal
to engage in the 100 debates. He
conjectured that Knapp might spend
more than $150,000 in the course of
the campaign, and lamented the
difficulties of running against a "well
known millionaire."
Knapp said he doubted McCloskey
ever took the proposal seriously,
suggesting that it was merely a means
of attracting publicity.
McCloskey spent $183,000—more
than any other incumbent
congressman in the nation—to win his
party's nomination in 1972, Knapp
charged. "Based on his past record, it
would be almost impossible for Pete
[McCloskey] to limit .his campaign
spending."
$15,000 Limit
Among Democratic contenders in
the primary, the main proponent of a
spending allowance is Santa Clara
Mayor Gary Gillmor. Gillmor sent a
letter last month to the six other
candidates in the district, urging a
$15,000 limit on expenses in the
primary campaign.
Gillmor's plan was attacked by
Thomas Skornia, an attorney
contending for the Democratic
nomination. Skornia said that since
Gillmor is well known in the district,
he doesn't need to spend much money
on publicity.
Skornia said Gillmor may intend to
"suppress his opponent's ability to
achieve any significant name
recognition, thereby grabbing the
election for himself through his
present name recognition as mayor of
Santa Clara, which comprises almost a
quarter of the district."
State Investigations
Skornia added it is possible state
investigations into land development
transactions have scared away people
who contributed to Gillmor's 1972

Congressional campaign.
Gillmor may know that he can't
raise much money this year, and wants
to insure that no one else can, Skornia
speculated.
Gillmor told the Daily yesterday he
is disappointed by Skornia's reaction
to the proposal.
"People keep saying that the
federal government should do
something to limit campaign
spending," Gillmor said. "I don't see
why individual candidates themselves
can't agree to limit spending."
No Funds At All
Gillmor said that the only candidate
who has agreed to his proposal is John
Fredrich, a Palo Alto carpenter.
Fredrich says he has no campaign
funds at all.
Gillmor said McCloskey had agreed
to the plan in principle, but would not
accept the limitation because of
Knapp's refusal to engage in the 100
debates.
McCloskey and Gillmor have agreed
that if they are nominated, they will
limit their spending in the general
election to $25,000.
Another candidate in the
Democratic race Herbert Rhodes has
announced he will spend only
$25,000. Gillmor said he is negotiating
an agreement with Rhodes regarding a
specific mutual limitation of campaign
spending.
