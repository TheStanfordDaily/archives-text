# Golda Meir Quits As Israeli Chief
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Golda Meir
informed her Labor party yesterday,
she was resigning again as Israel's
premier and said this time her decision
is final.
"I have reached the end of my
road," the 75-year-old grandmother
told an assemblage of party leaders in
a room in the Knesset, Israel's
parliament, attended also by newsmen.
She added that her decision will
bring down the entire government and
that she was sorry.
Meir said she would formally tender
her resignation today at a meeting of
the Cabinet. Party officials said this
means new elections would follow, but
probably not until August, and that
Meir is expected to stay on in a
caretaker capacity until then.
If she does stay on, Meir or at least

her foreign minister, Abba Eban,
would be available for conferences
with United States Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger who is expected
here soon in another effort to settle
the Israeli-Syrian conflict on the Golan
Heights front.
The resignation comes in the midst
of a dispute in Israel over the fixing of
blame for Israeli unawareness of the
possibility of an Arab attack last Oct.
6.
tyfeir resigned March 3 in a dispute
over the same issue but agreed to come
back to her job. At that time she had
been ill with the shingles, a nerve
disorder.
She told her party comrades
yesterday, "Don't try to change my
mind."
Meir's present coalition government
includes a Labor alignment, which is a
merger of various Socialist groups. It
includes Defense Minister Moshe
Dayan, who leads a wing of Meir's
Labor party. Others in the coalition
are the National Religious party, the
Independent Liberal party and the
grouping of Arab politicians
representing Arabs who live in Israel.
The resignation left doubt over
Dayan's future. A war enquiry forced
chief of staff Lt. Gen. David Elazar to
resign and avoided blaming Dayan for
Israel's unreadiness to fight last
October.
Party members attending the closed
meeting quoted Meir as saying, "This
time my decision is irrevocable. I have
reached the end of the road and my
decision has nothing to do with
Dayan."
She resigned a month ago because
of party squabbling. But she changed
her mind because of what she termed a
military crisis on the Syrian front.
Israel has been afflicted with
constant turmoil since the October
Middle East war. It centered around
fixing the blame for the nation's
unpreparedness for war last Oct. 6.
Labor party leaders said it was
Finance Minister Pinhas Sapir seemed
the most logical successor.
The resignation becomes formal
only when she announces it to
President Ephraim Katzir, Israel's
ceremonial head of state, who could
then ask any powerful member of
parliament to try to form a new
government within 21 days, to head
off an election battle.
Labor officials said new elections
could not come before August since
the Knesset will not convene until May
6 and elections could follow only 100
days after that.
The right-wing Likud-Unity-op
position bloc was not willing to wait.
Likud leader Menahem Begin said he
will try to set up a new interim
government to rule until the elections.
Begin said Likud wants to put
together a coalition that might include
Dayan and his supporters.
Meanwhile, in the Golan Heights,
where skirmishing along the
Israeli-Syrian border has been going on
for a month, Syria claimed that Israeli
shells nearly hit the new commander
of the United Nations truce observers
in the Middle East.
Lt. Gen. Bengt Liljenstrand of
Sweden was crossing the cease-fire line
with several advisors when Israel
launched a surprise attack, a
spokesman said.

Labor party. Others in the coalition
are the National Religious party, the
Independent Liberal party and the
grouping of Arab politicians
representing Arabs who live in Israel.
The resignation left doubt over
Dayan's future. A war enquiry forced
chief of staff Lt. Gen. David Elazar to
resign and avoided blaming Dayan for
Israel's unreadiness to fight last
October.
Party members attending the closed
meeting quoted Meir as saying, "This
time my decision is irrevocable. I have
reached the end of the road and my
decision has nothing to do with
Dayan."
She resigned a month ago because
of party squabbling. But she changed
her mind because of what she termed a
military crisis on the Syrian front.
Israel has been afflicted with
constant turmoil since the October
Middle East war. It centered around
fixing the blame for the nation's
unpreparedness for war last Oct. 6.
Labor party leaders said it was
Finance Minister Pinhas Sapir seemed
the most logical successor.
The resignation becomes formal
only when she announces it to
President Ephraim Katzir, Israel's
ceremonial head of state, who could
then ask any powerful member of
parliament to try to form a new
government within 21 days, to head
off an election battle.
Labor officials said new elections
could not come before August since
the Knesset will not convene until May
6 and elections could follow only 100
days after that.
The right-wing Likud-Unity-op
position bloc was not willing to wait.
Likud leader Menahem Begin said he
will try to set up a new interim
government to rule until the elections.
Begin said Likud wants to put
together a coalition that might include
Dayan and his supporters.
Meanwhile, in the Golan Heights,
where skirmishing along the
Israeli-Syrian border has been going on
for a month, Syria claimed that Israeli
shells nearly hit the new commander
of the United Nations truce observers
in the Middle East.
Lt. Gen. Bengt Liljenstrand of
Sweden was crossing the cease-fire line
with several advisors when Israel
launched a surprise attack, a
spokesman said.
JERUSALEM (AP) - Golda Meir
informed her Labor party yesterday,
she was resigning again as Israel's
premier and said this time her decision
is final.
"I have reached the end of my
road," the 75-year-old grandmother
told an assemblage of party leaders in
a room in the Knesset, Israel's
parliament, attended also by newsmen.
She added that her decision will
bring down the entire government and
that she was sorry.
Meir said she would formally tender
her resignation today at a meeting of
the Cabinet. Party officials said this
means new elections would follow, but
probably not until August, and that
Meir is expected to stay on in a
caretaker capacity until then.
If she does stay on, Meir or at least

her foreign minister, Abba Eban,
would be available for conferences
with United States Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger who is expected
here soon in another effort to settle
the Israeli-Syrian conflict on the Golan
Heights front.
The resignation comes in the midst
of a dispute in Israel over the fixing of
blame for Israeli unawareness of the
possibility of an Arab attack last Oct.
6.
tyfeir resigned March 3 in a dispute
over the same issue but agreed to come
back to her job. At that time she had
been ill with the shingles, a nerve
disorder.
She told her party comrades
yesterday, "Don't try to change my
mind."
Meir's present coalition government
includes a Labor alignment, which is a
merger of various Socialist groups. It
includes Defense Minister Moshe
Dayan, who leads a wing of Meir's
Labor party. Others in the coalition
are the National Religious party, the
Independent Liberal party and the
grouping of Arab politicians
representing Arabs who live in Israel.
