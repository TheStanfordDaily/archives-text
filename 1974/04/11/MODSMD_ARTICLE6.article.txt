# ASSU Voting Concludes Today
## 
### 
Some 1282 students voted
yesterday in first day of the ASSU
general election, according to Richard
Haskell, election commissioner.
Students chose between six slates
of candidates for the ASSU Council of
Presidents and voted on fee
assessments. Juniors selected next
year's class officers.
Today is the second and final day
of the ASSU election. Students may
vote from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at any one
of the following six locations: the Post
Office, Engineering Corner, Medical
Center, Physics Tank, and Graduate
School of Business.
Haskell noted that by far the largest
proportion of students—sBs—voted
yesterday at the Post Office. He said
381 voted at the Engineering Corner,
the next most popular polling place.
Returns will be announced at the
ASSU office this evening around 10,
Haskell said.
Election returns will be withheld
until all ballots have been counted,
Haskell said. He explained that to post
tabulations throughout the evening
might "create anxiety."
Haskell said that no irregularities in
voting were reported yesterday
although one slate complained because
the ballots were not numbered.
