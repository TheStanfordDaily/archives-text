Kidnaping
Editor:
In light of recent developments
in the kidnaping of Patricia
Hearst by the Symbionese
Liberation Army, I thought your
readers might be interested in a
similar case I read about while
visiting the Midwest a few years
ago. I quote directly from a
clipping from the Chicago Herald
of July 13, 1971, and offer the
story without comment:
"It was recently revealed here
that Danny G. Jenkins, heir to the
Fargo, N.D., Daily Mail fortune,
was abducted late in 1968 by a
right-wing militant group calling
itself 'The United States Army.'
This band of fanatics and
psychopathic killers explained
that young Jenkins' 'number had
come up' and 'it was his turn to
go.'
"Danny's concerned parents
received only sporadic
communication from their
kidnaped son, to the effect that
he was alive and well and being
held captive somewhere in
Southeast Asia. 'They say I'll be
all right if I do what I'm told,' he
said in one communique. These
messages were delivered by a
blue-uniformed courier believed
to be part of the same forces that
control the so-called 'U.S. Army.'
"Young Jenkins referred
vaguely to obscure tortures at the
hands of his psychotic captors,
including 'KP' and 'Vietcong.' He
once wrote, 'I sure wish you'd
write to someone in Washington,
Dad, and get me the hell out of
here.'
"In 1970, the Jenkins' were
informed by the 'U.S. Army' that
Danny would be released, but at
the last moment he 're-uped,' as
he put it, 'to keep on fighting.' He
took the 'Army' name of Lance
Corporal Daniel G. Jenkins and
referred to his father as a 'civvy.'
''His parents were
dumbfounded. 'He must have
been hypnotized or drugged or
something,' his father said. 'Or
perhaps the strain was just too
much for him. My boy'd have to
be crazy to do a thing like that.' "

It makes you think, doesn't it?

Friends, are you bored with
what's happening on campus?
Does your auto-erotic device seem
to have lost its pep? Are you tired
of punching buttons on your
$800 HP copulator? Are you
looking for grand spectacles,
beautiful music, and sparkling
personalities to excite your
senses? Have you considered
opera?
The Stanford branch of the
College Opera Association is
having its first organizational
meeting on Thursday, April 18, at
noon in Tresidder Small Lounge,
Rm. 282. The COA is a new
student organization begun by the
Opera Guild to interest more
students in opera.
Some of the previous functions
that the COA has co-sponsored
are: receptions for stars after the
opera; presentations by the
make-up man and prop-man; tours
of the Opera House; free
attendance at rehearsals; and talks
by Maestro Herbert Adler. These
activities will all be offered if
there is enough interest.
The Stanford Chapter of the
COA will represent Stanford
students in the 20 member COA
and could provide transportation
and previews led by members of
the Opera Guild. It is also possible
that we could bring the Western
Opera Association, the touring
part of the San Francisco Opera,
to Stanford. This, too, depends on
the amount of interest.
The discount tickets allocated
to Stanford for next season will
be sold at the Thursday meeting.
The tickets all for Wednesday
nights, are for Marion Lescaut,
Parsifal, La Cenerentola,
Esclarmonde, Luisa Miller and
Madama Butterfly. The COA
needs student support to continue
its services.
