# Support UFWA

The grape harvest in the
Coarhella Valley will be beginning
within weeks. As it gets under
way, California's farmworkers will
renew their long struggle for
United Farmworker contracts
with the grape growers of
California.
Just a year ago the grape
growers refused to renegotiate
contracts with the UFWA and
instead, sought corrupt Teamster
officials Bill Grami and Einer
Mohn to join them in destroying
the Farmworker Union.
The growers' "sweetheart"
contracts with the Teamsters
deprived the farmworkers of
rights they had won through the
UFWA; rights such as pesticide
protection, mechanization clauses,
a hiring hall, and grassroots
participation in the union of their
choice.
The Farmworkers struck the
fields, badly hurting the Coachella
growers. However, as the summer
wore on, growers used illegal
strikebreakers, repressive court
injunctions which limited
picketing, and massive police and
Teamster violence to eventually
break the strikes throughout the
state.
The UFWA members voted to
call off the strike and renew the
table grape boycott after members
Nagi Daifullah, an Arab
immigrant, and Juan de la Cruz,

sixty-year-old veteran of the
strike, were murdered in August
of 1973.
At present, over 600
farmworker families are working
on the grape and Gallo wine
boycotts in cities throughout the
U.S. and Canada. They will need
our help now and throughout the
summer to win.
As the strikes get underway
this spring, the Union and strikers
will desperately need food and
money. The Farmworker Support
Committee here at Stanford will
be organizing food drives
throughout the quarter. The first
one will be this Saturday, April
13. We will need people to join us
at the Tresidder parking lot at ten
o'clock Saturday morning.
Transportation and literature are
already arranged.
For individuals and
communities who are interested in
donating food, the following
staples are needed: rice, dried
beans, dried and canned milk,
sugar, coffee, canned fruits and
vegetables, flour, and tortillas. If
you have food to donate, you
may drop it off in the food barrel
in the Round Room at Memorial
Church or call 324-1368, and it
will be picked up. Support the
Farmworkers!
