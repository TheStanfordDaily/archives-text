# USE Votes Down Contract Offer
## 
### DON COX VLAE KERSHNER 
Members of the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union voted
overwhelmingly yesterday to reject the
contract proposals the University has
offered the union.
More than 700 people packed into
the Tresidder Large Lounge to listen
to members of the union negotiating
team outline the contract as proposed
by the University after four months of
negotiation.
USE President Jim Berk told the
Daily last night that well over 75
percent of the, 600 voting bargaining
unit members chose to reject each
section of the contract.
Berk said that of the 1400 to 1500
bargaining unit members, over 1000
belong to the union.
"We're going to negotiate like hell
for two weeks starting next Monday,"

Berk said. "If they're unyielding or
unreasonable, we'll call for a strike."
"We're going to negotiate like hell
for two weeks starting next Monday,"
Berk said. "If they're [University
Negotiators] unyielding or
unreasonable, we'll call for a strike."
Sections Considered
The proposed contract offered by
the University was broken down into
ten sections for the consideration of
the members at the meeting.
The ten sections were: maintenance
of standards, representation, staff,
jobs, hours, leaves, pay, working
conditions, benefits and separation.
Workers were asked to accept or
reject the university's offer with
respect to each section and to list their
personal priorities concerning the
specific contract demands within each
section topic.
There was little objection to the

negotiating team's recommendations
to reject each section as offered by the
University.
University 'Bluffing'
In his opening remarks at the
meeting, Berk said the Univeristy "was
bluffing on a helluva lot of things" in
negotiating with the union.
"The [union's negotiating] team
knows they're bluffing and it is up to
you to call their bluff.
"We can wrap this thing up in a
month. By the middle of May we'll be
looking as to whether we have to go
on strike or not," said Berk.
In recommending to the unit
members that they reject the
University's offer, Berk said "a no vote
means you're prepared to fight for"
what you want.
Union Shop
Berk said the university had offered

"what is normally called a modified
union shop."
A union shop requires employees to
join the union in order to hold a job.
However, the university contract
does not requine employees hired
before the signing of the contract to
join the union.
"Everyone could resign from the
union before the contract was signed
and still get the negotiated benefits,"
Berk said.
Berk 'Optimistic'
Berk was "optimistic" and "very
encouraged" by the results of the
meeting.
"The University is going to have to
offer us more. They're going to have
to dip into the reserves to pay us.
They have to go back to the alumni
and the Federal government and get
more money, which is what they
should have done all along," Berk said.
The University has maintained that
union demands such as a 33 percent
average wage increase and a
cost-of-living escalator are
"unreasonable."
Strike Support
The meeting concluded with a
statement by its chairman, Bill
Reynolds. "We do not wish to take
you out on strike. Nobody gains from
a strike. But we may need your
support to say you will strike if you
have to. Still, we'll take a long, long
time to decide to take you out on
strike."
Berk interpreted Reynolds' remarks
to mean "subjectively a long time. The
University wants to see picket signs,"
to test USE's strength, Berk said. He
reiterated that "we're going to wrap
this thing up, one way or another, by
the middle of May."
According to Berk, if the University
refuses to compromise the union
leadership will, within two weeks, mail
out ballots to unit members asking for
authorization of a strike, and will also
seek AFL-CIO sanction for a walkoff.
One Hansen Labs worker
commented, "I think we may take a
strike vote but I don't think it would
pass."

"We're going to negotiate like hell
for two weeks starting next Monday,"
Berk said. "If they're [University
Negotiators] unyielding or
unreasonable, we'll call for a strike."
Sections Considered
The proposed contract offered by
the University was broken down into
ten sections for the consideration of
the members at the meeting.
The ten sections were: maintenance
of standards, representation, staff,
jobs, hours, leaves, pay, working
conditions, benefits and separation.
Workers were asked to accept or
reject the university's offer with
respect to each section and to list their
personal priorities concerning the
specific contract demands within each
section topic.
There was little objection to the

negotiating team's recommendations
to reject each section as offered by the
University.
University 'Bluffing'
In his opening remarks at the
meeting, Berk said the Univeristy "was
bluffing on a helluva lot of things" in
negotiating with the union.
"The [union's negotiating] team
knows they're bluffing and it is up to
you to call their bluff.
"We can wrap this thing up in a
month. By the middle of May we'll be
looking as to whether we have to go
on strike or not," said Berk.
In recommending to the unit
members that they reject the
University's offer, Berk said "a no vote
means you're prepared to fight for"
what you want.
Union Shop
Berk said the university had offered

"what is normally called a modified
union shop."
A union shop requires employees to
join the union in order to hold a job.
However, the university contract
does not requine employees hired
before the signing of the contract to
join the union.
"Everyone could resign from the
union before the contract was signed
and still get the negotiated benefits,"
Berk said.
Berk 'Optimistic'
Berk was "optimistic" and "very
encouraged" by the results of the
meeting.
"The University is going to have to
offer us more. They're going to have
to dip into the reserves to pay us.
They have to go back to the alumni
and the Federal government and get
more money, which is what they
should have done all along," Berk said.
The University has maintained that
union demands such as a 33 percent
average wage increase and a
cost-of-living escalator are
"unreasonable."
Strike Support
The meeting concluded with a
statement by its chairman, Bill
Reynolds. "We do not wish to take
you out on strike. Nobody gains from
a strike. But we may need your
support to say you will strike if you
have to. Still, we'll take a long, long
time to decide to take you out on
strike."
Berk interpreted Reynolds' remarks
to mean "subjectively a long time. The
University wants to see picket signs,"
to test USE's strength, Berk said. He
reiterated that "we're going to wrap
this thing up, one way or another, by
the middle of May."
According to Berk, if the University
refuses to compromise the union
leadership will, within two weeks, mail
out ballots to unit members asking for
authorization of a strike, and will also
seek AFL-CIO sanction for a walkoff.
One Hansen Labs worker
commented, "I think we may take a
strike vote but I don't think it would
pass."

Members of the United Stanford

More than 700 people packed into

by the University after four months of
negotiation.
USE President Jim Berk told the
Daily last night that well over 75
percent of the, 600 voting bargaining
unit members chose to reject each
section of the contract.
Berk said that of the 1400 to 1500
bargaining unit members, over 1000
belong to the union.
"We're going to negotiate like hell
for two weeks starting next Monday,"

Berk said. "If they're unyielding or
