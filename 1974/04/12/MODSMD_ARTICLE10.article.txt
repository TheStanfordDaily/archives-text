# On Unbudgeting

I can't say I wasn't warned. In
the booklet, Approaching
Stanford, sent last August to all
incoming freshmen and transfer
students, a short quotation read,
"Open an unlimited expense
account."
From that I should have
understood that scrimping pennies
at Stanford just wasn't going to be
easy. As I later discovered, it was
downright impossible.
Hence, I cannot present here a
surefire guide to happy budgeting
at Stanford. Instead, I offer a
guide to joyful unbudgeting and
the consequences thereof. I am
highly qualified, since I merrily
and short-sightedly spent a
sizeable portion of my spring
tuition during autumn and winter
quarters.
If you are a cautious spender,
if you have written no more than
two checks all year, if you always
read your magazines in the
Tresidder Store but never buy
them, I wish to congratulate you.
For those people more like
myself, let us see how closely our
spending techniques correspond.
Constantly In Need
Are you constantly in need of
thingsâ€”in need of books on sale at
the bookstore, in need of a full
wardrobe of Stanford T-shirts, in
need of visiting San Francisco one
day, and there, in need of a hot
fudge sundae at Blums?
Then you already know, as I
do, that only one general
technique is required for
successful overspending. Simply
read of an event or see an item,
want it for yourself or someone
else, and shuffle from one foot to
another debating its worth.
Next decide that the world will
little note nor long remember
what money you have not spent
here, and go ahead with the
purchase.
The Awakening
Having skillfully mastered the
above technique, it is small
wonder that I experienced a
moment of awakening on
pre-registration day. When
presented my fees list, I added up
the facts and figures, compared
the total with my checkbook
balance, and trotted down to the
student job center.
There were a number of
opportunities posted, among them

bartending, demonstrating a
vegetable peeling machine (all the
carrots you can eat?), and interior
house painting: "Must be willing
to work all day, if necessary. No
experience required." That was
for me! I then called home to
explain the tuition deficit and
how I planned to resolve it
myself.
A friend gave me a pair of
surgeon's gloves when he learned of
my new occupation. They worked
splendidly, protecting me against
the triphosphates of Spic 'n Span,
until my thumbs popped through.
On a day while I was working
alone, however, I read the box of
Spic 'n Span for entertainment
and discovered that the miracle
detergent actually was "good
for your hands." From then on I
was thankful for my beauty
treatment, like the customers of
Madge soaking in Palmolive
Dishwashing Liquid.
Pet Control Report
We always turned the radio to
a classical station which
interrupted its programs every so
often with news and a pet control
report. While the Bach contatas
and the Strauss waltzes were
aired, however, painting was
transformed into an aesthetically
beautiful experience. The brush
flowed with the music and the
color didn't run down the wall.
Some less fulfilling moments
occurred while I was painting the
ceilings. I was pelted by small
drops landing on my head, nose,
and mouth.
My employer reimbursed me
well for all my painting troubles
though. As a result, my tuition is
now paid in full and I still have
money for a coke. But I notice
that instead of feeling the need to
celebrate I feel a little less need
for anything.
I intend to play "keep away"
with the Stanford Shopping
Center for most of the quarter,
computing money amounts now
into number of paint drops in or
near my eyes per hour. Also, I
want to get a head start on my
savings for this fall. With my
revised outlook on spending, I
may even run for house treasurer.
