# Nguyen Huu Thai

Queries from members of the
Stanford community have shown
me that the campaign to invite
Nguyen Huu Thai to Stanford
needs some clarification.
In the process of gathering the
1700 signatures which put the
issue on Wednesday's and
Thursday's ballot, we had to deal
with the question, "Why two
ballot issues for one project?"
The answer is simply that the
ASSU Guest Professor Program is
out of money, and an invitation
to Mr. Thai to become ASSU
Guest Professor must contain a
salary offer to enable him to come
to Stanford. Thus students are
asked to vote for a $1 refundable
fee assessment to fund the ASSU
Guest Professor Program, and for
a referendum to invite Nguyen
Huu Thai here as ASSU Guest
Professor.
In no way will the Guest
Professor funds be limited to
Nguyen Huu Thai. They will be
available for whomever is chosen
as ASSU Guest Professor. We
hope it is Thai.
Approval Necessary
The Guest. Professor must be
approved by the ASSU Senate and
by a Stanford academic program.
The student body as a whole can
choose the Guest Professor in
place of their representatives, the
ASSU Senate. This is what you
are asked to do by way of the
referendum which instructs the
ASSU Senate to invite Thai.

Then the Senate and the
Committee to Invite Nguyen Huu
Thai to Stanford will together
continue present efforts to have
an academic program or
department support Thai's
appointment.
We have found some interest in
the departments of
communication, urban studies,
political science, engineering
(architecture), and social thought
and institutions. A strongly
favorable vote on the referendum
will tell the faculty that we want
Thai to come here.
Assessment Essential
The fee assessment to fund the
ASSU Guest Professor Program is
clearly essential to our project.
But we do not propose it merely
as an instrument for one special
effort. Everyone working on the
Thai campaign strongly endorses
funding the Guest Professor
Program, whether or not Thai
comes to Stanford.
We believe that it is a very
important program that can
respond to special academic or
social concerns of students.
Nguyen Huu Thai would be far
and away the most unique ASSU
Guest Professor ever invited to
Stanford. Please help bring him
here by voting on April 17 and
18.
