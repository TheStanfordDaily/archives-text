# Sterilization--A Thinking Exercise
## 
### 
William Shockley

My position about eugenic programs has
been grievously distorted. Therefore, I shall
try to respond in advance to the attacks on
me that are to be expected
after the announcement of my scheduled
appearance on university platforms where I
have been excluded in the past.
These distortions have been prevalent and
varied. It would be tedious and impractical to
list them one by one and refute them.
Instead, I offer for inspection and
comparison what I have said, in almost
exactly identical words, for more than three
years.
Note that I do not advocate
implementation. What I do offer is my
thinking exercise in the form of a
voluntary sterilization bonus plan.
Suggestions that eugenics measures should
be considered are often answered by these
unimaginative cliches: Who will decide who
should reproduce? What is the definition of
the perfect man? When the committee to
define the perfect man is formed, how can
you be sure to be appointed to it? Evolution
did not develop man by using the principles
suggested by these questions. Nor, as I next
intend to make clear, do these questions need
to be answered before starting to search for
humane eugenic programs.
Thinking Exercise
The Voluntary Sterilization Bonus Plan is
a THINKING EXERCISE invented for the

purpose of stimulating thought about
dysgenics. Dysgenics is retrogressive
evolution through the disproportionate
reproduction of the genetically
disadvantaged. Dysgenics may pose the most
severe pollution threat that modern
civilization has to face.
Worries about dysgenics, or population
pollution, are very old. They are now
discounted. A related worry, the population
explosion, now taken seriously, was generally
rejected only thirteen years ago.
But today, zero population growth is
becoming a widely accepted goal for planet
earth. My chief purpose is to provoke
responsible citizens to become aware of the
dysgenic threat as they have for the
population explosion.
Population Pollution
The voluntary sterilization bonus plan is a
thipking tool that I use to encourage others
to face the dangers of population pollution.
It answers the objection that any cure for
population pollution would inevitably be
worse than the illness itself. I state the
voluntary-sterilization-bonus-plan thinking
exercise as follows:
Bonuses would be offered for sterilization.
Payers of income tax would get nothing.
Bonuses for all others, regardless of sex, race,
or welfare status, would depend on best
scientific estimates of hereditary factors in
disadvantages such as diabetes, epilepsy,

heroin addiction, arthritis, etc.
At a bonus rate of $1000 for each point
below 100 1.Q., $30,000 put in trust for a 70
I.Q. moron potentially capable of producing
20 children might return $250,000 to
taxpayers in reduced costs of mental
retardation care. Ten percent of the bonus in
spot cash might put our national talent for
entrepreneurship into action.
Thought-Blocks
I measure the objectivity of an individual
with whom I discuss this thinking exercise by
seeing whether or not he can discover one
obvious, major flaw. The potential for
bearing children decreases as age increases.
Therefore, the bonus should decrease with
age. But age is not mentioned in the plan.
This is the obvious flaw that I use to test for
thought-blocks.
A feature that might frustrate the plan is
that those who are not bright enough to learn
of the bonus on their own are the ones most
important to reach. The problem of reaching
such people is what might be solved by
paying the 10 percent of the bonus in spot
cash.
Bounty hunters attracted by getting a cut
of the bonus might then persuade low 1.Q.,
high-bonus types to volunteer. I do not
advocate the implementation of such a
policy. But I do advocate objective inquiry.

Population Pollution
The voluntary sterilization bonus plan is a
thipking tool that I use to encourage others
to face the dangers of population pollution.
It answers the objection that any cure for
population pollution would inevitably be
worse than the illness itself. I state the
voluntary-sterilization-bonus-plan thinking
exercise as follows:
Bonuses would be offered for sterilization.
Payers of income tax would get nothing.
Bonuses for all others, regardless of sex, race,
or welfare status, would depend on best
scientific estimates of hereditary factors in
disadvantages such as diabetes, epilepsy,

heroin addiction, arthritis, etc.
At a bonus rate of $1000 for each point
below 100 1.Q., $30,000 put in trust for a 70
I.Q. moron potentially capable of producing
20 children might return $250,000 to
taxpayers in reduced costs of mental
retardation care. Ten percent of the bonus in
spot cash might put our national talent for
entrepreneurship into action.
Thought-Blocks
I measure the objectivity of an individual
with whom I discuss this thinking exercise by
seeing whether or not he can discover one
obvious, major flaw. The potential for
bearing children decreases as age increases.
Therefore, the bonus should decrease with
age. But age is not mentioned in the plan.
This is the obvious flaw that I use to test for
thought-blocks.
A feature that might frustrate the plan is
that those who are not bright enough to learn
of the bonus on their own are the ones most
important to reach. The problem of reaching
such people is what might be solved by
paying the 10 percent of the bonus in spot
cash.
Bounty hunters attracted by getting a cut
of the bonus might then persuade low 1.Q.,
high-bonus types to volunteer. I do not
advocate the implementation of such a
policy. But I do advocate objective inquiry.

My position about eugenic programs has
been grievously distorted. Therefore, I shall
try to respond in advance to the attacks on
me that are to be expected
after the announcement of my scheduled
appearance on university platforms where I
have been excluded in the past.
These distortions have been prevalent and
varied. It would be tedious and impractical to
list them one by one and refute them.
Instead, I offer for inspection and
comparison what I have said, in almost
exactly identical words, for more than three
years.
Note that I do not advocate
implementation. What I do offer is my
thinking exercise in the form of a
voluntary sterilization bonus plan.
Suggestions that eugenics measures should
be considered are often answered by these
unimaginative cliches: Who will decide who
should reproduce? What is the definition of
the perfect man? When the committee to
define the perfect man is formed, how can
you be sure to be appointed to it? Evolution
did not develop man by using the principles
suggested by these questions. Nor, as I next
intend to make clear, do these questions need
to be answered before starting to search for
humane eugenic programs.
Thinking Exercise
The Voluntary Sterilization Bonus Plan is
a THINKING EXERCISE invented for the

purpose of stimulating thought about
dysgenics. Dysgenics is retrogressive
evolution through the disproportionate
reproduction of the genetically
disadvantaged. Dysgenics may pose the most
severe pollution threat that modern
civilization has to face.
Worries about dysgenics, or population
pollution, are very old. They are now
discounted. A related worry, the population
explosion, now taken seriously, was generally
rejected only thirteen years ago.
But today, zero population growth is
becoming a widely accepted goal for planet
earth. My chief purpose is to provoke
responsible citizens to become aware of the
dysgenic threat as they have for the
population explosion.
