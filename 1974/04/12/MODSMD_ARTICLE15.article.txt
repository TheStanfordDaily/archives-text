Election Reform
Editor:
I find Thomas Skornia's reply
to Bill Evers on campaign
spending utterly absurd. While
Evers has presented facts, Skornia
seems content with the empty
rhetoric of campaign promises.
To say that "few, if any
constitutional lawyers find any
problem" with public financing of
political campaigns only suggests
what circles Skornia is traveling
in. No less an advocate of "liberal"
causes than Adlai Stevenson 111
has questioned the
constitutionality of one of the
fund allocation plans recently
proposed.
As for the Federal Election
Campaign Act (I presume this is
the measure alluded to as the
"Campaign Control Act"),
lawyers for the New York Times
as well as Yale law professors
Alexander Bickel and Ralph K.
Winter are among those who have
questioned its constitutionality.
I do not, however, find it
strange that no court attack has
been actively launched against it
as yet in view of the present
Supreme Court's unbelievable
disregard for the constitution.
(E.g., witness their recent decision
upholding the Bank Secrecy Act
which requires not that banks
maintain ihe privacy of their
customers' accounts but rather
compels them to spy actively on
those accounts.)
Skornia broadly claims that
public financing will make it
possible for new parties to be
heard. How? Apparently only
through their presence on the
ballot. He specifically fails to
counter Evers charge that minor
parties would be frozen into a
non-growth situation by the
currently proposed methods for
fund allocations.
Skornia also indicates that

besides public financing he would
like to see the closing of such
loopholes as "donation of
personnel, equipment and
facilities," although he fails to
elaborate on just how this would
be accomplished. Could it be he
would prevent me from allowing a
politician to speak in my own
home (or on ether property I
owned) unless I invited all of his
competitors as well? Could I not
use my printing press to create
campaign literature unless I
printed an equal amount for all of
the opposition candidates?
Public financing of campaigns
will not stop "big interests from
buying elections." It will insure
that the only big interests who
will be able to do so are those
currently controlling the
government. And as long as
government has the ability to aide
selective groups thru intervention
in the economy there will be
those trying to swing those
sanctions in their direction.

Centrex Obsolete?
Editor:
In 1963, a large northwestern
university installed a much more
advanced and flexible Centrex
system than Stanford's new
system. In 1972, they replaced
their system as obsolete. So one
wonders if the picture on the
cover of the new campus phone
book represents the level of
technical sophistication of
Stanford's new system?

Nguyen Huu Thai
Editor:
There was a petition being
circulated, and there are

numerous leaflets now posted
concerning Nguyen Huu Thai, a
South Vietnamese political
prisoner, and what Stanford
students can do to help bring
about his release from prison.
They would also get his
contributions as a guest professor
in the areas of urban planning,
architecture, journalism and the
situation that has existed and
exists today in South Vietnam.
Both could be accomplished by
inviting Thai to Stanford under a
guest professorship program.
It seems to me to be quite a
minimal effort for the Stanford
students to expend, to cast two
votes in a student election to
accomplish this. Surely there are
enough students willing to do that
much to express their concern

about some of the great injustices
being done in the world today to
limit personal and civil freedoms.
The case of Nguyen Huu Thai
may be just one example of unfair
imprisonment and repressive
government action in a world full
of like cases, but every positive
action taken, and all the attention
that can be drawn to individuals
in Thai's position, will help
alleviate the situation. There is
much to be gained, whether this
proposal is considered from the
point of Stanford's individual
benefit or from a broader, more
ideological stand.
Is it too much to ask that we look
outside of ourselves for a
moment, and care?

besides public financing he would
like to see the closing of such
loopholes as "donation of

elaborate on just how this would
be accomplished. Could it be he
would prevent me from allowing a
politician to speak in my own

Public financing of campaigns
will not stop "big interests from

that the only big interests who
will be able to do so are those
currently controlling the

in the economy there will be
those trying to swing those

Centrex Obsolete?
Editor:
In 1963, a large northwestern
university installed a much more
advanced and flexible Centrex
system than Stanford's new
system. In 1972, they replaced
their system as obsolete. So one
wonders if the picture on the
cover of the new campus phone
book represents the level of
technical sophistication of
Stanford's new system?

Nguyen Huu Thai
Editor:
There was a petition being
circulated, and there are

numerous leaflets now posted
concerning Nguyen Huu Thai, a
South Vietnamese political
prisoner, and what Stanford
students can do to help bring
about his release from prison.
They would also get his
contributions as a guest professor
in the areas of urban planning,
architecture, journalism and the
situation that has existed and
exists today in South Vietnam.
Both could be accomplished by
inviting Thai to Stanford under a
guest professorship program.
It seems to me to be quite a
minimal effort for the Stanford
students to expend, to cast two
votes in a student election to
accomplish this. Surely there are
enough students willing to do that
much to express their concern

about some of the great injustices
being done in the world today to
limit personal and civil freedoms.
The case of Nguyen Huu Thai
may be just one example of unfair
imprisonment and repressive
government action in a world full
of like cases, but every positive
action taken, and all the attention
that can be drawn to individuals
in Thai's position, will help
alleviate the situation. There is
much to be gained, whether this
proposal is considered from the
point of Stanford's individual
benefit or from a broader, more
ideological stand.
Is it too much to ask that we look
outside of ourselves for a
moment, and care?

I find Thomas Skornia's reply
to Bill Evers on campaign
spending utterly absurd. While
Evers has presented facts, Skornia
seems content with the empty
rhetoric of campaign promises.
To say that "few, if any
constitutional lawyers find any
problem" with public financing of
political campaigns only suggests
what circles Skornia is traveling
in. No less an advocate of "liberal"
causes than Adlai Stevenson 111
has questioned the
constitutionality of one of the
fund allocation plans recently
proposed.
As for the Federal Election
Campaign Act (I presume this is
the measure alluded to as the
"Campaign Control Act"),
lawyers for the New York Times
as well as Yale law professors
Alexander Bickel and Ralph K.
Winter are among those who have
questioned its constitutionality.
I do not, however, find it
strange that no court attack has
been actively launched against it
as yet in view of the present
Supreme Court's unbelievable
disregard for the constitution.
(E.g., witness their recent decision
upholding the Bank Secrecy Act
which requires not that banks
maintain ihe privacy of their
customers' accounts but rather
compels them to spy actively on
those accounts.)
Skornia broadly claims that
public financing will make it
possible for new parties to be
heard. How? Apparently only
through their presence on the
ballot. He specifically fails to
counter Evers charge that minor
parties would be frozen into a
non-growth situation by the
currently proposed methods for
fund allocations.
Skornia also indicates that
