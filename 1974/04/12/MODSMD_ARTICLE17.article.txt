# Support NorCal PIRG

Lewin, Weitzel

Are you frustrated after having
to pay exorbitant prices for
gasoline? Do you get a headache
and acid indigestion when you
look at your grocery bill? Are you
sick of energy crises, milk
scandals, and Watergates? Do you
have the idea that something is
rotten in the state of our
government?
Well, a remedy exists. Instead
of taking aspirin, try action—the
Northern California Public
Interest Research Group known
nationwide by its nickname,
PIRG.
From their initial conception
by Ralph Nader, student
controlled PIRGs have sprung up
around the country to combine
investigative research and action
to effectively deal with political
corruption, inept bureaucrats, and
irresponsible corporations. Most
importantly, PIRGs work with
local citizens and community
groups in order to have the
greatest impact.
130 Campuses
Students on more than 130
campuses are voluntarily
supporting PIRGs with over one
million dollars collected with
activities fees. In Minnesota, PIRG
has worked to stop the pollution
of Lake Superior.
An investigation by the Oregon
PIRG found abuses in the
enforcement of subdivision
control laws that culminated in
the resignation of the state real
estate commissioner.
PIRGs are state-wide or
regional organizations which are
supported and controlled by
students. Each campus votes to
assess itself a dollar or more to
support PIRG. The money goes to
the regional board which uses the
funds to hire a professional staff
of organizers, lawyers, engineers,
and scientists to provide PIRG
with expertise and continuity.
The staff is directly responsible to
the regional student board which
is composed of representatives
from local boards on each
campus.
Stanford Affiliated
In California, the state has
been divided into three regions.
Stanford is affiliated with Nor Cal
PIRG. Already Nor Cal PIRG has
been approved by students at
University of California (Davis)
and is operating at University of
Santa Clara Law School.
Last week, students at Hastings
Law School approved PIRG by an
overwhelming majority of 80
percent of the vote. PIRG is also
active in the two other California
regions of Los Angeles and San
Diego.
Nor Cal PIRG's first project is
to stop the construction of a
"Disneyland-North" (called
All-American Theme Park) slated
for the Santa Clara area by the
Mariott Corporation. Nor Cal
PIRG has joined with the Sierra
Club to fight the project.
Current Campaigns
Campaigns are presently
underway at San Francisco State,
San Jose State, and West Valley
Community College. Future issues
Nor Cal PIRG will consider
include environmental and
consumer issues as well as
discrimination based on race,
religion or sex.
The work of PIRG could
include watchdogging the
development of public transit,
fighting for better air and water
quality, and investigating pesticide
contamination in agricultural
products. The final decision on
which issues PIRG will fight for
will be up to those students who
get involved in PIRG.
Already, the PIRG organizing
committee at Stanford is
completing a survey of local banks
to determine which institutions
give the best checking account
privileges and which give student
loans.
Needs Student Support
PIRG needs your support. On
the spring ballot you will be asked
to approve a refundable one dollar
assessment for the 1974-75 school
year. PIRG will come back to the
student body each year to ask for
your continued support.
Therefore, PIRG will have to serve
the interests of students in order
to receive continued backing.
PIRG provides an invaluable
opportunity to research
community problems for both
undergraduate and graduate
students. It is a chance for
students to make a difference.
Remember to vote on April 16 or
17.

gasoline? Do you get a headache
and acid indigestion when you
look at your grocery bill? Are you
sick of energy crises, milk
scandals, and Watergates? Do you
have the idea that something is
rotten in the state of our
government?
Well, a remedy exists. Instead
of taking aspirin, try action—the
Northern California Public
Interest Research Group known
nationwide by its nickname,
PIRG.
From their initial conception
by Ralph Nader, student
controlled PIRGs have sprung up
around the country to combine
investigative research and action
to effectively deal with political
corruption, inept bureaucrats, and
irresponsible corporations. Most
importantly, PIRGs work with
local citizens and community
groups in order to have the
greatest impact.
130 Campuses
Students on more than 130
campuses are voluntarily
supporting PIRGs with over one
million dollars collected with
activities fees. In Minnesota, PIRG
has worked to stop the pollution
of Lake Superior.
An investigation by the Oregon
PIRG found abuses in the
enforcement of subdivision
control laws that culminated in
the resignation of the state real
estate commissioner.
PIRGs are state-wide or
regional organizations which are
supported and controlled by
students. Each campus votes to
assess itself a dollar or more to
support PIRG. The money goes to
the regional board which uses the
funds to hire a professional staff
of organizers, lawyers, engineers,
and scientists to provide PIRG
with expertise and continuity.
The staff is directly responsible to
the regional student board which
is composed of representatives
from local boards on each
campus.
Stanford Affiliated
In California, the state has
been divided into three regions.
Stanford is affiliated with Nor Cal
PIRG. Already Nor Cal PIRG has
been approved by students at
University of California (Davis)
and is operating at University of
Santa Clara Law School.
Last week, students at Hastings
Law School approved PIRG by an
overwhelming majority of 80
percent of the vote. PIRG is also
active in the two other California
regions of Los Angeles and San
Diego.
Nor Cal PIRG's first project is
to stop the construction of a
"Disneyland-North" (called
All-American Theme Park) slated
for the Santa Clara area by the
Mariott Corporation. Nor Cal
PIRG has joined with the Sierra
Club to fight the project.
Current Campaigns
Campaigns are presently
underway at San Francisco State,
San Jose State, and West Valley
Community College. Future issues
Nor Cal PIRG will consider
include environmental and
consumer issues as well as
discrimination based on race,
religion or sex.
The work of PIRG could
include watchdogging the
development of public transit,
fighting for better air and water
quality, and investigating pesticide
contamination in agricultural
products. The final decision on
which issues PIRG will fight for
will be up to those students who
get involved in PIRG.
Already, the PIRG organizing
committee at Stanford is
completing a survey of local banks
to determine which institutions
give the best checking account
privileges and which give student
loans.
Needs Student Support
PIRG needs your support. On
the spring ballot you will be asked
to approve a refundable one dollar
assessment for the 1974-75 school
year. PIRG will come back to the
student body each year to ask for
your continued support.
Therefore, PIRG will have to serve
the interests of students in order
to receive continued backing.
PIRG provides an invaluable
opportunity to research
community problems for both
undergraduate and graduate
students. It is a chance for
students to make a difference.
Remember to vote on April 16 or
