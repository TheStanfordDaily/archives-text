# Unpretentious 'Broadway' Looks At 20's Morality
## 
### DAVID W. MOYER 
SAN FRANCISCO —The
American Conservatory Theatre's
final addition to the season's
repertoire is a delightful
comedy-melodrama return to the
days of prohibition, speak-easies,
bootlegging, and gangsters.
Phillip Dunning and George
Abbott's Broadway, first
produced in 1926, is at once an
historical document of character
types inhabiting the backstage of

a 1920's bootlegging cabaret in
New York City and light and
lively evening's entertainment.
ACT's production is true to the
spirit of the script, if not always
to its letter.
The plot of Broadway is
classically "B movie." Simple and
unpretentious, one knows what
will happen next, but that does
not diminish the fun of watching
it happen, for the broad humor
and striking verisimilitude of

characterization offered by the
playwrights produces ample
challenge to a company of ACT's
stature.
The story revolves around the
eternal triangle, as a slick and
suave bootlegging gangster vies
with an ambitious but poor and
not-too-bright small-time hoofer
for the hand of the latter's
lithesome and naive dance
partner.
The venue for this and
complications which ensue is the
backstage of a Manhattan
speak-easy. The audience looks on
behind the scenes all the while as
the "weenies" (scantily-clad
chorus girls) rehearse their
routines and banter; the hoofer,
Roy Lane, fights to protect his
Billie from the untoward
intentions of the gangster, Steve
Crandall; and Crandall "croaks"
rival bootlegger "Scar" Edwards
in an argument over bootlegging
territory in Harlem.
When the cue sounds, however,
all real-word considerations are
forgotten and replaced by the
glitter and pasted-on smiles of the
stage as the chorus line high-steps
off the Geary stage and onto the
speak-easy's imaginary one. This
device is used to considerable
advantage dramatically, providing
a break from and punctuating the
tension produced by the
melodrama.
For all of Broadway's broad
humor, there is an implicit
indictment of the New Morality
of the Twenties, of the
hero-worship paid the slick
gangsters, and good expectedly

triumphs in the end.
Director Edward Hasting's
production is marvelous in
conception, but there were a few
problems in the translation.
Designer Ralph Funicello's
reconverted warehouse set,
complete with loading dock and
steel support beams overhead,
added just the right amount of
seediness to the goings on,
bringing to mind the garage of the
St. Valentine's Day Massacre and

the secret locations of the
speak-easy.
The acting was good but not
noteworthy throughout with a
few exceptions both ways. On the
negative side, the various accents
adopted by many of the cast
were, with the exception of Ray
Reinhardt's superb Greek
entrepreneur, unconvincing.
Particularly painful was Charles
Lanyer's gangster Crandall whose
supposedly New York City accent
wandered across various
continents and served as a
constant reminder that this was
indeed merely the Geary Stage in
San Francisco, a full 3,000 miles
away from the real vowel sounds
of New York.
The primary weakness of the
production was this lack of any
sense of Gotham City. This is
unfortunate, for although

Broadway is a document of an
era, it is no less a document of
that specific island of asphalt
from which the play derives its
title.
A further detraction was the
occasional tendency to let the
pace drag, which was wholly out
of keeping with a script which
requires machine-gun tempo
throughout.
To dwell on these problems is,
however, to misrepresent the sum

total of the evening, for it was on
the whole a highly reputable
performance if not a particularly
great one.
There were some marvelous
individual efforts which carried
the show. Most notable was James
R. Winker's Roy Lane, the young

hoofer dying to play the Palace
who expects to get there on the
strength of his "personality." The
strength of Winker's own
"personality" and his painstaking
attention to details of subtlety in
even the smallest of parts have
propelled his meteoric ascent with
ACT in his very first year in the
company.
Winker painted this role with
the bright, broad brush strokes
necessary to the humor of the
play, and yet with sufficient
reality of detail to avoid mere
caricature. Keep your eyes on this
star-on-the-rise.
Deborah May's heroine, Billie
Moore, was refreshingly sweet,
lovely, innocent, and sincere,
although at times she was too
much so. Ray Reinhardt's cabaret
owner, Nick Verdis, was
extremely solid at all times and
helped establish atmosphere and
pace. Roger Kern's
"bull"—"dick"—cop was a curious
but effective cross between James
Cagney, Columbo, and Pat

O'Brien; sounds crazy, but it
worked. Ruth Kobart delivered
her usual staunch performance
with a flair.
As usual with ACT the subtle
advantages of impeccable timing
and nuance that come with a
developed sense of ensemble
added most to the script. The
company is at its best in the
crowd scenes in which its fine
sense of team work is displayed.
In all this is an abundantly
amusing script and performance,
not spectacular, but decidedly
successful. Broadway makes no
pretense of offering wisdom; it
settles for wisecracks, and it
makes up in fun what it lacks in
profundity.

complete with loading dock and
steel support beams overhead,
added just the right amount of
seediness to the goings on,
bringing to mind the garage of the
St. Valentine's Day Massacre and

the secret locations of the
speak-easy.
The acting was good but not
noteworthy throughout with a
few exceptions both ways. On the
negative side, the various accents
adopted by many of the cast
were, with the exception of Ray
Reinhardt's superb Greek
entrepreneur, unconvincing.
Particularly painful was Charles
Lanyer's gangster Crandall whose
supposedly New York City accent
wandered across various
continents and served as a
constant reminder that this was
indeed merely the Geary Stage in
San Francisco, a full 3,000 miles
away from the real vowel sounds
of New York.
The primary weakness of the
production was this lack of any
sense of Gotham City. This is
unfortunate, for although

Broadway is a document of an
era, it is no less a document of
that specific island of asphalt
from which the play derives its
title.
A further detraction was the
occasional tendency to let the
pace drag, which was wholly out
of keeping with a script which
requires machine-gun tempo
throughout.
To dwell on these problems is,
however, to misrepresent the sum

total of the evening, for it was on
the whole a highly reputable
performance if not a particularly
great one.
There were some marvelous
individual efforts which carried
the show. Most notable was James
R. Winker's Roy Lane, the young

hoofer dying to play the Palace
who expects to get there on the
strength of his "personality." The
strength of Winker's own
"personality" and his painstaking
attention to details of subtlety in
even the smallest of parts have
propelled his meteoric ascent with
ACT in his very first year in the
company.
Winker painted this role with
the bright, broad brush strokes
necessary to the humor of the
play, and yet with sufficient
reality of detail to avoid mere
caricature. Keep your eyes on this
star-on-the-rise.
Deborah May's heroine, Billie
Moore, was refreshingly sweet,
lovely, innocent, and sincere,
although at times she was too
much so. Ray Reinhardt's cabaret
owner, Nick Verdis, was
extremely solid at all times and
helped establish atmosphere and
pace. Roger Kern's
"bull"—"dick"—cop was a curious
but effective cross between James
Cagney, Columbo, and Pat

O'Brien; sounds crazy, but it
worked. Ruth Kobart delivered
her usual staunch performance
with a flair.
As usual with ACT the subtle
advantages of impeccable timing
and nuance that come with a
developed sense of ensemble
added most to the script. The
company is at its best in the
crowd scenes in which its fine
sense of team work is displayed.
In all this is an abundantly
amusing script and performance,
not spectacular, but decidedly
successful. Broadway makes no
pretense of offering wisdom; it
settles for wisecracks, and it
makes up in fun what it lacks in
profundity.

RISING STAR—James R. Winker's performance as young hoofer Roy
Lane was one of the highlights in ACT's production of Broadway,
directed by Edward Hasting. ACT finished this season's repertoire
nicely with this comedy-melodrama.
SAN FRANCISCO —The
American Conservatory Theatre's
final addition to the season's
repertoire is a delightful
comedy-melodrama return to the
days of prohibition, speak-easies,
bootlegging, and gangsters.
Phillip Dunning and George
Abbott's Broadway, first
produced in 1926, is at once an
historical document of character
types inhabiting the backstage of

a 1920's bootlegging cabaret in
New York City and light and
lively evening's entertainment.
ACT's production is true to the
spirit of the script, if not always
to its letter.
The plot of Broadway is
classically "B movie." Simple and
unpretentious, one knows what
will happen next, but that does
not diminish the fun of watching
it happen, for the broad humor
and striking verisimilitude of

characterization offered by the
playwrights produces ample
challenge to a company of ACT's
stature.
The story revolves around the
eternal triangle, as a slick and
suave bootlegging gangster vies
with an ambitious but poor and
not-too-bright small-time hoofer
for the hand of the latter's
lithesome and naive dance
partner.
The venue for this and
complications which ensue is the
backstage of a Manhattan
speak-easy. The audience looks on
behind the scenes all the while as
the "weenies" (scantily-clad
chorus girls) rehearse their
routines and banter; the hoofer,
Roy Lane, fights to protect his
Billie from the untoward
intentions of the gangster, Steve
Crandall; and Crandall "croaks"
rival bootlegger "Scar" Edwards
in an argument over bootlegging
territory in Harlem.
When the cue sounds, however,
all real-word considerations are
forgotten and replaced by the
glitter and pasted-on smiles of the
stage as the chorus line high-steps
off the Geary stage and onto the
speak-easy's imaginary one. This
device is used to considerable
advantage dramatically, providing
a break from and punctuating the
tension produced by the
melodrama.
For all of Broadway's broad
humor, there is an implicit
indictment of the New Morality
of the Twenties, of the
hero-worship paid the slick
gangsters, and good expectedly

triumphs in the end.
Director Edward Hasting's
production is marvelous in
conception, but there were a few
problems in the translation.

O'Brien; sounds crazy, but it
worked. Ruth Kobart delivered
her usual staunch performance
with a flair.
As usual with ACT the subtle
advantages of impeccable timing
and nuance that come with a
developed sense of ensemble
added most to the script. The
company is at its best in the
crowd scenes in which its fine
sense of team work is displayed.
In all this is an abundantly
amusing script and performance,
not spectacular, but decidedly
successful. Broadway makes no
pretense of offering wisdom; it
settles for wisecracks, and it
makes up in fun what it lacks in
profundity.

RISING STAR—James R. Winker's performance as young hoofer Roy
Lane was one of the highlights in ACT's production of Broadway,
directed by Edward Hasting. ACT finished this season's repertoire
nicely with this comedy-melodrama.
SAN FRANCISCO —The
American Conservatory Theatre's
final addition to the season's
repertoire is a delightful
comedy-melodrama return to the
days of prohibition, speak-easies,
bootlegging, and gangsters.
Phillip Dunning and George
Abbott's Broadway, first
produced in 1926, is at once an
historical document of character
types inhabiting the backstage of

a 1920's bootlegging cabaret in
New York City and light and
lively evening's entertainment.
ACT's production is true to the
spirit of the script, if not always
to its letter.
The plot of Broadway is
classically "B movie." Simple and
unpretentious, one knows what
will happen next, but that does
not diminish the fun of watching
it happen, for the broad humor
and striking verisimilitude of

characterization offered by the
playwrights produces ample
challenge to a company of ACT's
stature.
The story revolves around the
eternal triangle, as a slick and
suave bootlegging gangster vies
with an ambitious but poor and
not-too-bright small-time hoofer
for the hand of the latter's
lithesome and naive dance
partner.
The venue for this and
complications which ensue is the
backstage of a Manhattan
speak-easy. The audience looks on
behind the scenes all the while as
the "weenies" (scantily-clad
chorus girls) rehearse their
routines and banter; the hoofer,
Roy Lane, fights to protect his
Billie from the untoward
intentions of the gangster, Steve
Crandall; and Crandall "croaks"
rival bootlegger "Scar" Edwards
in an argument over bootlegging
territory in Harlem.
When the cue sounds, however,
all real-word considerations are
forgotten and replaced by the
glitter and pasted-on smiles of the
stage as the chorus line high-steps
off the Geary stage and onto the
speak-easy's imaginary one. This
device is used to considerable
advantage dramatically, providing
a break from and punctuating the
tension produced by the
melodrama.
For all of Broadway's broad
humor, there is an implicit
indictment of the New Morality
of the Twenties, of the
hero-worship paid the slick
gangsters, and good expectedly

triumphs in the end.
Director Edward Hasting's
production is marvelous in
conception, but there were a few
problems in the translation.
Designer Ralph Funicello's
reconverted warehouse set,
complete with loading dock and
steel support beams overhead,
added just the right amount of
seediness to the goings on,
bringing to mind the garage of the
St. Valentine's Day Massacre and

the secret locations of the
speak-easy.
The acting was good but not
noteworthy throughout with a
few exceptions both ways. On the
negative side, the various accents
adopted by many of the cast
were, with the exception of Ray
Reinhardt's superb Greek
entrepreneur, unconvincing.
Particularly painful was Charles
Lanyer's gangster Crandall whose
supposedly New York City accent
wandered across various
continents and served as a
constant reminder that this was
indeed merely the Geary Stage in
San Francisco, a full 3,000 miles
away from the real vowel sounds
of New York.
The primary weakness of the
production was this lack of any
sense of Gotham City. This is
unfortunate, for although

Broadway is a document of an
era, it is no less a document of
that specific island of asphalt
from which the play derives its
title.
A further detraction was the
occasional tendency to let the
pace drag, which was wholly out
of keeping with a script which
requires machine-gun tempo
throughout.
To dwell on these problems is,
however, to misrepresent the sum

total of the evening, for it was on
the whole a highly reputable
performance if not a particularly
great one.
There were some marvelous
individual efforts which carried
the show. Most notable was James
R. Winker's Roy Lane, the young

hoofer dying to play the Palace
who expects to get there on the
strength of his "personality." The
strength of Winker's own
"personality" and his painstaking
attention to details of subtlety in
even the smallest of parts have
propelled his meteoric ascent with
ACT in his very first year in the
company.
Winker painted this role with
the bright, broad brush strokes
necessary to the humor of the
play, and yet with sufficient
reality of detail to avoid mere
caricature. Keep your eyes on this
star-on-the-rise.
Deborah May's heroine, Billie
Moore, was refreshingly sweet,
lovely, innocent, and sincere,
although at times she was too
much so. Ray Reinhardt's cabaret
owner, Nick Verdis, was
extremely solid at all times and
helped establish atmosphere and
pace. Roger Kern's
"bull"—"dick"—cop was a curious
but effective cross between James
Cagney, Columbo, and Pat

O'Brien; sounds crazy, but it
worked. Ruth Kobart delivered
her usual staunch performance
with a flair.
As usual with ACT the subtle
advantages of impeccable timing
