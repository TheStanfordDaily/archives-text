## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon was subpoenaed by the House
Judiciary Committee yesterday to turn
over all tapes and other materials
sought for its impeachment inquiry
but the White House declined to say it
would fully comply.
After the subpoena was issued by a
33-3 committee vote, White House
press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
promised only that Nixon would
supply the committee within two

weeks with unspecified materials that
would be "comprehensive and
conclusive in regard to the President's
actions."
Ziegler said the White House had
been pledging since Tuesday to make
some of the requested materials
available when Congress returns from
its Easter recess on April 22. He said
the White House review of these
materials would continue.
The White House spokesman

declined to say that Nixon would fully
comply with the subpoena, declaring
only that he would turn over materials
"consistent with his constitutional
responsibilities."
Ziegler argued that the materials
which he said would reach the
committee between April 22 and April
25 would bear out Nixon's past
explanations of his Watergate role and
"will receive the support of the
House."
The subpoena, approved by a 33-3
vote, directs the President to respond
by 10 a.m. on April 25, four days after
Congress returns from its Easter recess.
All dissenting votes were cast by
members of the Republican minority.
The committee's order came
despite an offer from James D. St.
Clair, the President's Watergate lawyer,
to deliver some of the material
requested within a few days. But St.
Clair had refused to make an
immediate decision on all of the
material the committee had requested.
