# Memorial Church Gives Easter Play
## 
### 
The Easter Play of Trier, a medieval German work, will be
presented on Sunday at 3" p.m. as the first production of a dramatic
series sponsored by Memorial Church.
Dating from the 13th century, the play combines classical German
verse, the Latin liturgy, and slapstick scenes which were originated to
explain the meaning of the liturgy to common people who did not
learn Latin.
Judy Malafronte and Tim Martin of the Early Music Program will
sing the authentic Latin liturgy, while other actors will present the
comic and poetic scenes which have been translated from the German
by director Don Bowman.
Bowman, a third year doctoral student in drama, believes that the
secret of the play lies in the "matching of those extreme contrasts."
While Bowman describes parts of the 40 minute production as slow
and deliberate, he adds that one scene shows the apostles Peter and
John staging a footrace down the center aisle of Memorial Church in
an effort to reach Christ's tomb:
"Zap! There you are, it's the Marx Brothers."
However, Bowman emphasizes that Trier was "designed for Easter
and was meant to be included in the mass."
Dramatically, Bowman suggests that such plays were "the
beginning of modern drama," and that rather than being stiff and
regimented as some audiences might imagine, these works are
embodiments of "the original dramatist's maxim, which is 'show it,
don't tell it.' "
While Sunday's presentation will have overt religious orthodoxy as
its basis, the next production of the Memorial Church series, Sleep of
Prisoners by Christopher Fry, is described by Bowman as "distinctly
questioning."
As opposed to Triers, Prisoners will be built around the need for a
"rethinking of man in the universe if we are going to survive."
Prisoners of Sleep will be performed in Memorial Church on May
22, 23, and 24. There will also be an art exhibit sponsored by the
church in May.
