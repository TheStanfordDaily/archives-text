# Osaka Kabuki Prints Displayed On Campus
## 
### BARBARA HEINS 
The Sarah Miedel room of the
Stanford Art Museum is presently
filled with more than forty
magnificent actor portraits from
the Osaka kabuki stage.
The woodblock prints, and
several related drawings, trace the
development of the portraitist
tradition of the Osaka school
from the last decade of the 18th
century to the 1870s.
Although Westerners have long
known the prints made in the
capital city of Edo, the prints
from Osaka, Japan's second
largest city, have remained fairly
unknown until now due to their
scarcity. Until recently they had
been almost unobtainable for
students and western collectors.
The kabuki theatre actors were
the idols, heros, and living models
for their audience. An author
wrote in 1770, "Wherever you go,
barbershop or bath-house,
whatever people are discussing,
whether loyalty, chastity or filial
devotion, every example is
Kabuki."
The portrait prints of each
actor handed out at every
performance were more than
souvenirs; they served as
guidelines to be emulated and
copied, "nature imitating art."
Actor portraits were published
in Japan from the early 17th
century but few recognizable
likenesses appeared before the
17605. The actors were viewed as
outcasts by the government and
denied citizenship. The prints
broadened the popularity of the
theater, usually depicting an
especially dramatic moment in a
play, often with a facial close-up
in full costume and make-up.

The actors were always men
and their roles were highly
dramatic, varied, and imaginative.
The story of Aigo no Waha tells of
a tragedy befalling a man who
refuses to make love to his
stepmother. It is represented by
an early print of 1795 in light
washes of color and outline.
The actor often played several
roles in the same play. Onoe
Kikugoro 111 in 1826 acted both
as the disfigured wife of Tamiya
lemon and as the dead body of
Koheiji in a play of ghosts and
murders which is still performed
in Japan today.
The process of woodblock
printing in Japan was threefold.
The individual artists conceived
and drew the designs. Engravers
then transferred the designs onto
blocks of wood which the printer
applied to paper to create the
finished prints.
The later prints are extremely
beautiful with intricate detail and
rich, varied color. One of the most
interesting is a complete printing
of the court of Suikode, a print
only rarely seen in its entirety.
With the later works, western
influence can be seen in
background perspective and cloud
depictions.
Accompanying each print are
essays and explanations of the
kabuki theater and the woodblock
print process by Roger S. Keyes
and Keiko Mizushima.
The prints form part of an
important collection recently
purchased and exhibited at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art. The
exhibition of Osaka prints will
continue at Stanford until April
28.

washes of color and outline.
The actor often played several
roles in the same play. Onoe
Kikugoro 111 in 1826 acted both
as the disfigured wife of Tamiya
lemon and as the dead body of
Koheiji in a play of ghosts and
murders which is still performed
in Japan today.
The process of woodblock
printing in Japan was threefold.
The individual artists conceived
and drew the designs. Engravers
then transferred the designs onto
blocks of wood which the printer
applied to paper to create the
finished prints.
The later prints are extremely
beautiful with intricate detail and
rich, varied color. One of the most
interesting is a complete printing
of the court of Suikode, a print
only rarely seen in its entirety.
With the later works, western
influence can be seen in
background perspective and cloud
depictions.
Accompanying each print are
essays and explanations of the
kabuki theater and the woodblock
print process by Roger S. Keyes
and Keiko Mizushima.
The prints form part of an
important collection recently
purchased and exhibited at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art. The
exhibition of Osaka prints will
continue at Stanford until April
28.
The Sarah Miedel room of the
Stanford Art Museum is presently
filled with more than forty
magnificent actor portraits from
the Osaka kabuki stage.
The woodblock prints, and
several related drawings, trace the
development of the portraitist
tradition of the Osaka school
from the last decade of the 18th
century to the 1870s.
Although Westerners have long
known the prints made in the
capital city of Edo, the prints
from Osaka, Japan's second
largest city, have remained fairly
unknown until now due to their
scarcity. Until recently they had
been almost unobtainable for
students and western collectors.
The kabuki theatre actors were
the idols, heros, and living models
for their audience. An author
wrote in 1770, "Wherever you go,
barbershop or bath-house,
whatever people are discussing,
whether loyalty, chastity or filial
devotion, every example is
Kabuki."
The portrait prints of each
actor handed out at every
performance were more than
souvenirs; they served as
guidelines to be emulated and
copied, "nature imitating art."
Actor portraits were published
in Japan from the early 17th
century but few recognizable
likenesses appeared before the
17605. The actors were viewed as
outcasts by the government and
denied citizenship. The prints
broadened the popularity of the
theater, usually depicting an
especially dramatic moment in a
play, often with a facial close-up
in full costume and make-up.

The actors were always men
and their roles were highly
dramatic, varied, and imaginative.
The story of Aigo no Waha tells of
a tragedy befalling a man who
refuses to make love to his
stepmother. It is represented by
an early print of 1795 in light
washes of color and outline.
