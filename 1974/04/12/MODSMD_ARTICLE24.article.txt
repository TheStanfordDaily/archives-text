## A 						Step Backward 
### 
Wednesday's announcement that Bob Murphy will leave his post as
sports information director represents a step backward for Stanford
sports.
In his 10 years at the University, Murphy has contributed
immeasurably to the growth of the entire athletic program. His job
entails working with the media as well as coaches and athletic
department officials. It is to Murphy's credit that as the middle man
in the often abrasive relationships between these factions, he has
received accolades from both sides.
In addition to his efforts as sports information director, Murphy
has undertaken several outside commitments. He has worked as the
color man on KSFO's Stanford football broadcasts, produced the
Stanford and San Francisco 49er football highlight shows and held
other radio and television positions. Two weeks ago, he was named
Executive Director of the East-West Shrine football game.
Athletic Director Joseph Ruetz, who understandably wanted the
sports information director to devote full time to his job at the
University, presented Murphy with an ultimatum-drop the
commitments or resign. Murphy opted for the latter, mainly because
he simply could not live comfortably on the meager salary (estimated
at $12,500 annually) offered by the athletic department.
It is Ruetz' contention that "anyone heading any department of
the University should work full time for the University." As Murphy
leaves, though, other University faculty and administrators continue
to supplement their incomes with little interference from their
superiors.
As sports editors of the Daily the past four years, we have seen
Murphy effectively publicize Stanford sports despite the fact that he
is the only sports information director in the Pacific Eight who works
without a full-time assistant. He has initiated more extensive coverage
of minor sports as well as satisfying the seemingly insatiable media
demands for football and basketball news.
We sympathize with Ruetz' feeling that the sports information
director should devote all of his energies to the Stanford program. But
we have seen Murphy do a lot for Stanford sports—certainly more
than others could accomplish without any outside commitments.
Without question, he has performed the duties his job requires.
Our solution would have been to allow Murphy to continue as
sports information director while supplementing his office with a
full-time assistant. The athletic department argues that this would be
economically unfeasible; we feel that an assistant sports information
director would accomplish considerably more than several full-time
administrators currently on Ruetz' payroll.
We have all argued with Murphy at various times. We realize,
however, that he was always acting in what he believed were the best
interests of Stanford sports.
We also realize that Murphy's national contacts, sense of humor
and promotional flair will be nearly impossible to replace.

to supplement their incomes with little interference from their
superiors.
As sports editors of the Daily the past four years, we have seen
Murphy effectively publicize Stanford sports despite the fact that he
is the only sports information director in the Pacific Eight who works
without a full-time assistant. He has initiated more extensive coverage
of minor sports as well as satisfying the seemingly insatiable media
demands for football and basketball news.
We sympathize with Ruetz' feeling that the sports information
director should devote all of his energies to the Stanford program. But
we have seen Murphy do a lot for Stanford sports—certainly more
than others could accomplish without any outside commitments.
Without question, he has performed the duties his job requires.
Our solution would have been to allow Murphy to continue as
sports information director while supplementing his office with a
full-time assistant. The athletic department argues that this would be
economically unfeasible; we feel that an assistant sports information
director would accomplish considerably more than several full-time
administrators currently on Ruetz' payroll.
We have all argued with Murphy at various times. We realize,
however, that he was always acting in what he believed were the best
interests of Stanford sports.
We also realize that Murphy's national contacts, sense of humor
and promotional flair will be nearly impossible to replace.

Wednesday's announcement that Bob Murphy will leave his post as
sports information director represents a step backward for Stanford
sports.
In his 10 years at the University, Murphy has contributed
immeasurably to the growth of the entire athletic program. His job
entails working with the media as well as coaches and athletic
department officials. It is to Murphy's credit that as the middle man
in the often abrasive relationships between these factions, he has
received accolades from both sides.
In addition to his efforts as sports information director, Murphy
has undertaken several outside commitments. He has worked as the
color man on KSFO's Stanford football broadcasts, produced the
Stanford and San Francisco 49er football highlight shows and held
other radio and television positions. Two weeks ago, he was named
Executive Director of the East-West Shrine football game.
Athletic Director Joseph Ruetz, who understandably wanted the
sports information director to devote full time to his job at the
University, presented Murphy with an ultimatum-drop the
commitments or resign. Murphy opted for the latter, mainly because
he simply could not live comfortably on the meager salary (estimated
at $12,500 annually) offered by the athletic department.
It is Ruetz' contention that "anyone heading any department of
the University should work full time for the University." As Murphy
leaves, though, other University faculty and administrators continue
to supplement their incomes with little interference from their
superiors.
