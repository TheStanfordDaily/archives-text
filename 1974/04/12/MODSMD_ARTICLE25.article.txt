# Oregonian Leads Golf Tourney
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
SANTA CRUZ- Oregon
Sophomore Peter Jacobsen coolly
stroked in a four-foot birdie putt
on the 18th green yesterday,
smiled, picked up his ball and
apparently waved goodby to the
remainder of the 150-man field at
the Western Intercollegiate golf
tournament.
"I don't think he's been
playing the same course," said one
of the former contenders after
Jacobsen had toured the tricky
Pasatiempo golf course in 67-69
for a six-under-par total of 136.
Jacobsen held a comfortable
four-stroke lead over Roger Koch
of Cal State-Fullerton going into
today's final round of the 54-hole
event. In the team competition,
Jacobsen's performance
accounted for Oregon's surprising
position atop the tightly-bunched
25-team field.
The Ducks, with a 589 two-day

total, hold a one-shot edge over
second place San Jose State. Five
teams are tied at 593, followed by
four more at 595, including
Stanford.
The Cards, who trailed 15
teams after Wednesday's first
round, moved into contention
when freshmen Brent Murray and
Glenn Goethals recovered from
disastrous opening rounds with
superb performances yesterday.
Murray carded a one-under-par
70 for a 152, while Goethals
managed a 72 for a 151.
Meanwhile, Dave Baskins added a
73 to his opening round of 72 and
George Pettinger shot 75 for a
36-hole total of 147.
"We're right in it," said
Stanford coach Bud Finger.
Actually, the Cards could be
walking away with it were it not
for several disappointing
excursions into the creeks and
trees bordering Pasatiempo's

narrow fairways.
Stanford's non-counting scores
(only the top four count toward
the team total) are: Conrad
Nilmeier (78-76—154) and Aly
Trompas (80-75—1 55).
