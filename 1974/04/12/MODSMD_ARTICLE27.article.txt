# Cards Seek Pac-8 Lead At UCLA
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
In what may be one of those
"tough acts to follow" Stanford's
baseball team, just off a successful
series against USC and sniffing at
the chance to take undisputed
possession of first place in the
Pacific Eight Southern Division,
meets UCLA at 2:30 this
afternoon at Sawtelle Field on the
Los Angeles campus.
Today's game is the first time
Stanford has played since taking
two out of three games against
USC last weekend. The Cards are
2-1 in the conference and 12-16
overall while UCLA is 1-2, losing
two games to Cal last weekend.
Cal and USC drew byes this

weekend.
"What most people don't
realize is that the ball club hasn't
changed because we beat USC,"
said Card head coach Ray Young.
"We're not head and shoulders
above everyone else. UCLA and
Cal are right with us."
At the moment Young is
worried about todays game.
"We've got to win them one at a
time."
Dave Frost (3-3) is scheduled
to pitch for the Cards today. His
opponent will probably be
righthander Steve Bianchi, who
pitched a win against Cal. "They
have a couple of good pitchers
down there. If he [Bianchi] does
shut down our righthanded
hitters, then he may be able to
pitch around Mark Lucich and
Bruce Robinson, our lefthanders,"
said Young.
The starting pitchers for
Saturday's doubleheader are going
to be a switch from the usual
rotation—sophomore Bernie
Hittner and freshman John
Yandle have drawn the call from

Young. "They've both done a
good job. We feel that [Al]
Arthur and [Mike] Williamson are
not pitching up to their
potential."
With the shift in roles for the
pitchers, Young feels that it "may
weaken our bullpen because both
displaced pitchers haven't done
relief work this year. But, then
again, both were primarily bullpen
pitchers last year.
The Cards have been hitting
the ball very well, an asset that is
especially important in light of
the ballpark they will be playing
in. Sawtelle is very small in the
power alleys and in straight away
center (370 feet). "It has been
very conducive to high scoring

ball games," said Young.
The small park gives almost
every Card a chance to hit a home
run. Two players hitting the long
ball consistently right now are
Bob Hampton (two home runs
against USC) and Mark Lucich.
Both lead the team with four
home runs each and Hampton
tops the runs batted in category
with 30. *
Stanford's overall leading hitter
is Dave Baker with a .353 mark.
Young doesn't take UCLA
lightly, noting that the Bruins
"swing the bat very well." The
Cards beat UCLA 6-4 at the
Riverside Tournament during
spring break.

BIG-SWINGING SOUTHPAW—George Hardie, a junior who is ranked
48th in the U.S. Men's singles, is expected to square off with Sandy
Mayer Saturday when Stanford hosts SMU. Hardie is best known for
his big left-handed serve.
In what may be one of those
"tough acts to follow" Stanford's
baseball team, just off a successful
series against USC and sniffing at
the chance to take undisputed
possession of first place in the
Pacific Eight Southern Division,
meets UCLA at 2:30 this
afternoon at Sawtelle Field on the
Los Angeles campus.
Today's game is the first time
Stanford has played since taking
two out of three games against
USC last weekend. The Cards are
2-1 in the conference and 12-16
overall while UCLA is 1-2, losing
two games to Cal last weekend.
Cal and USC drew byes this

weekend.
"What most people don't
realize is that the ball club hasn't
changed because we beat USC,"
said Card head coach Ray Young.
"We're not head and shoulders
above everyone else. UCLA and
Cal are right with us."
At the moment Young is
worried about todays game.
"We've got to win them one at a
time."
Dave Frost (3-3) is scheduled
to pitch for the Cards today. His
opponent will probably be
righthander Steve Bianchi, who
pitched a win against Cal. "They
have a couple of good pitchers
down there. If he [Bianchi] does
shut down our righthanded
hitters, then he may be able to
pitch around Mark Lucich and
Bruce Robinson, our lefthanders,"
said Young.
The starting pitchers for
Saturday's doubleheader are going
to be a switch from the usual
rotation—sophomore Bernie
Hittner and freshman John
Yandle have drawn the call from

Young. "They've both done a
good job. We feel that [Al]
Arthur and [Mike] Williamson are
not pitching up to their
potential."
With the shift in roles for the
pitchers, Young feels that it "may
weaken our bullpen because both
displaced pitchers haven't done
relief work this year. But, then
again, both were primarily bullpen
pitchers last year.
The Cards have been hitting
the ball very well, an asset that is
especially important in light of
the ballpark they will be playing
in. Sawtelle is very small in the
power alleys and in straight away
center (370 feet). "It has been
very conducive to high scoring

ball games," said Young.
The small park gives almost
every Card a chance to hit a home
run. Two players hitting the long
ball consistently right now are
Bob Hampton (two home runs
against USC) and Mark Lucich.
Both lead the team with four
home runs each and Hampton
tops the runs batted in category
with 30. *
Stanford's overall leading hitter
is Dave Baker with a .353 mark.
Young doesn't take UCLA
lightly, noting that the Bruins
"swing the bat very well." The
Cards beat UCLA 6-4 at the
Riverside Tournament during
spring break.
