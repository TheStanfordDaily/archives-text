# Netters Top Cal 6-3, Host SMU Tomorrow
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Tired of the same old enemies?
Sick of reading that USC and
UCLA will be Stanford's main
competition, in tennis, in football,
in most beer consumed by fans?
Well, you get a break
tomorrow. The Card tennis team
takes on a national power that
comes not from Los Angeles but
from the heart of Dr. Pepper
countryâ€”Southern Methodist
University, located in Dallas.
A near-capacity crowd at the
Varsity Courts is expected for the
match against SMU, which tied
for fourth place in last year's
NCAA net tourney and hopes to
break into the top three this year.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
recognizes the power of SMU in
that he'll play his top lineup for
the match, an "honor" generally
given only USC and UCLA.
Lineup Changes
That lineup is somewhat
different than the one that split
with the L.A. powers last
weekend. Sandy Mayer, of course,

is still number one, followed by
Jim Delaney, John Whitlinger and
Pat DuPre.
However, Nick Saviano moves
up to the fifth singles slot and
Mark Mitchell enters the lineup at
sixth. In doubles, Mayer-Delaney
and Whitlinger-DuPre will be
followed by Saviano-lVfitchell,
teammates at Gunn High School
in Palo Alto two years ago.
Gould, without fanfare,
announced the lineup change last
night after the Cards' 6-3 win over
Cal at Berkeley yesterday.
Waltke Wins
In this match, the Cards used
everyone but Mayer, and it looked
for awhile as if the senior star
would be sorely missed. At first
singles, Delaney dropped a 2-6,
6-4, 6-3 decision to Trey Waltke,
Cal's freshman star from St. Louis
who didn't play in the Northern
California Intercollegiates here in
February.
Whitlinger and DuPre got past
their opponents at second and
third singles, Peter Campbell and

Doug King, by identical 6-4, 7-6
scores. But at fourth singles,
Chico Hagey lost his third straight
singles match, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 to
Chris Sylvan.
Saviano had a tough time with
Manuel Casteneda at fifth singles,
and beat him 7-6, 6-7, 6-1, while
Mitchell breezed past Steve
Bartlett 6-2, 6-2 at the final
singles slot. Thus, he will play
instead of Hagey Saturday.
A t first doubles,
Wh ill i nger-D u Pre beat
Bartlett-Prouix, 6-4, 6-3. But
NorCal champions Hagey-Chip
Fisher dropped a 4-6, 7-6, 6-2
match to Sylvan-Waltke, the Cal
pair thus becoming double
winners. At third doubles,
Mitchell-Sa viano drubbed
King-Campbell,6-2, 6-3, their win
meaning they'll move ahead of
Hagey-Fisher this weekend.
Gould made a similar lineup
switch after the first UCLA, USC
and Cal matches last season. He
moved Chip Fisher into his lineup
to replace slumping Gery
Groslimond, a move which paid
off handsomely in the second dual
matches against those Pacific
Eight conference rivals.
Caricature Of Cards
The SMU lineup Stanford faces
tomorrow is almost a caricature of
Stanford's, and is even more
dominant in its conference.
George Hardie, a junior who is
48th in the U.S. men's rankings,
will play first singles, while Tim
Vann, a senior from Los Altos,
returns to the Midpeninsula to
play second singles.
This pair of Ail-Americans also
forms one of the country's top
doubles teams, much as do
Mayer-Delaney.
Below them are two other fine
players, Adi Kourim of Australia
and Joe Edles, "an exciting player
to watch," according to
Stanford's pressbook.
