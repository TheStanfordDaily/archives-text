Boyle Convicted In Murder Case
MEDIA, Pa. — Former United Mine Workers President
W.A. "Tony" Boyle was convicted last night of three
counts of murder in the slaying more than four years ago of
union rival Joseph "Jock" Yablonski, his wife and
daughter.
The verdict was returned by a jury of nine men and
three women after 4 1/2 hours of deliberation.
The conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life
imprisonment.
The 72-year-old Boyle, who already is serving a
three-year federal prison sentence for misuse of union
funds, exhibited no emotion as the verdict was read by jury
foreman Clyde M. Parris.
Boyle, however, did have a pained expression on his face
as he turned to wave goodbye to his wife and daughter on
his way out of the courtroom.
Boyle was the ninth person to be charged in the murder
of Yablonski, a union insurgent whose dissident movement
shook Boyle's leadership in 1969 and later toppled him
from the UMW's top post.
Kenneth Yablonski, son of the slain man, stood with
tears in his eyes next to special prosecutor Richard A.
Sprague and remarked: "You don't know how happy I am.
There's no words that I can express."
Sprague said the verdict "is proper and shows that
effective law enforcement can get to the people at the top."
"Unfortunately," he said, "too often only people at the
bottom are caught and convicted. We get only the puppets
and not the puppeteers."
Sprague had based his case almost solely on the
testimony of William Turnblazer, 52, the only witness to
link Boyle directly with the killing.
Terrorists Hit Israeli Border
QIRYAT SHMONAH, Israel — Three Arab terrorists
raided this Israeli border town as its inhabitants were rising
from their beds yesterday and killed 18 men, women and
children with bursts of submachine-gun fire and rocket
grenades. Another 15 persons were reported wounded.
Officials said most of the dead were children. The Arabs
died in an explosion inside a four-story apartment building
they had seized.
In Jerusalem, Premier Golda Meir said yesterday that
Israel would continue to seek peace and honor its
international commitments despite the current political
uncertainty in the Jewish state.
Formally announcing her resignation before a packed

parliament, she also warned that Israel's army is deployed
"as always and stands ready to fulfill its task."
Meir told her supporters Wednesday that she would
resign.
It was the second time in just over a month that
Meir had announced her resignation.
On March 3 she announced she would resign after she
failed to win approval for a minority Cabinet. Two days
later, after having received an overwhelming vote of
confidence from the Labor party, she agreed to reverse her
de'cision.
Reinecke Trial Reset
WASHINGTON — A federal judge yesterday reset the
perjury trial of California Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke for as soon
as possible after May 13 - 22 days before the California
gubernatorial primary.
U.S. District Court Judge Barrington D. Parker
summoned Reinecke's Washington attorney and the
government prosecution into his chambers to discuss the
dates when the trial would begin. On Wednesday Parker
tentatively set the trial date for June 19.
But Reinecke's attorney F. Joseph Donohue had argued
during the arraignment Wednesday that a time in May was
preferred so that "Reinecke's innocence may be established
before the primary." Reinecke, 50, is a leading contender
on the Republican ticket in the June 4 primary for
governor.
Judge Parker set May 13 as the date when he would hear
all motions in the trial. He said that depending on his
rulings on the motions on May 13, "the trial will begin
immediately thereafter."
Grand Jury Studies Housing
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal grand jury is probing
possible fraud in government-backed housing by loan
applicants, real estate brokers and contractors, a
government source reported yesterday.
Presentation of evidence, which began yesterday, was
expected to run into May, said the source, who asked not
to be identified.
U.S. Atty. James Browning Jr. confirmed last month
that a federal task force had been investigating possible
fraud for three or four months. He indicated then there
were violations and that there might be indictments.
He said violations involved mostly single-family homes
and were mostly in Oakland and San Jose with a few in San
Francisco.
The investigation was part of a check in 20 major cities
into potential frauds of many millions of dollars, Browning
said. The task force investigators included the FBI, the
Federal Housing Administration and the Department of
Urban Development, he said.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Little warmer today. Lows
