# Student-Guided Proposal May Prompt C-15 Action
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The Committee of 15 (C-15), which
is studying plans for a new University
judicial system, is expected to
reconvene within the next two weeks,
according to student members of the
committee.
In a letter to the Daily the five
students stated, "We are exploring an
approach to the problem which is
entirely different from that which has
dominated the committee's discussion
over the past three years."
Randy Smith, a law student on the
committee, said, "As I understand it, a
new proposal can be submitted by any
sub-group of the committee. If it is
informally approved for discussion by
a majority of the committee, the
committee can reconvene."
When asked what the students' new
proposal contains, ASSU President
Kevin O'Grady said, "We feel we
should discuss it informally with
members of the committee rather than
publicly, because public discussion
may lead to a premature polarization
of the committee on the issues.
"One of the things we're afraid of is
that comments on the proposal by the
university president or others might
have the effect of closing the minds of
some committee members to the
merits of the proposal."
A C-15 faculty member, Business
Prof. Harold Leavitt said, "If there is a
new proposal, I am certainly for
reconvening. Since I don't expect new
proposals coming from the faculty or
administration on the committee, I
presume that such proposals will have
to come from students."
The committee unexpectedly

adjourned last Thursday after a
proposal submitted for discussion by
the students was voted down by the
committee. O'Grady refuted a charge
made by C-15 member Asst. Prof, of
Political Science Jonathan Casper that
at Thursday's meeting student
members had been seeking to revive the
October Student Judicial Panel (SJP)
proposal.
Casper could not be reached for
comment.
According to O'Grady the student
members offered new alternatives to
SJP proposal which students voted
in the October election.
The October proposal called for the
panel to consist of four student
members selected at random from the
student body, three faculty members
chosen by the Faculty Senate
Committee on Committees, and a
representative of the administration.
Under that proposal, a student
member could have been removed at
any time by order of University
President Richard Lyman or by a
two-thirds vote of the Faculty Senate.
The student proposal voted down
Thursday called for "reasonable
discussion" of the following:
—the new panel would still consist
of a student majority.
—the faculty members would be
chosen randomly like the student
members.
—and a student could only be
removed from the committee by a
two-thirds vote of the Faculty Senate
(not allowing Lyman to make the
decision).
The current judicial system - known
as the Campus Judicial Panel- has three
student members, three faculty
members, and the faculty chairman
from the law school who only votes in
case of a tie.
