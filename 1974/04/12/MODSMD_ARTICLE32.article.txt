# Olivo-Magnolia Residents Offered Lagunita Spaces
## 
### 
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton has opened 57 spaces in
Lagunita houses A del fa, Eucalypto
and Granada for present
Olivo-Magnolia residents displaced by

the move of the black theme house
from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia, the
Daily has learned.
The 57 spaces include single, full
double (not doubled-up singles) and
triple rooms previously designated for
freshmen and transfer students.
Students presently living in
Olivo-Magnolia will choose by lottery
tonight whether to accept residence
priority for those spaces, for spaces
still available in Olivo-Magnolia or for
a limited number of spaces available in
Row and independent houses,
Mirrielees apartment complex,
Manzanita Park and other dorms.
Residents must still face next
week's housing draw, however, and
must still draw a number low enough
to qualify them for University housing
before they can use their new
priorities.
Horton told the Daily last night
that any spaces not taken up by
upperclassmen will revert to freshmen
and transfer students. He added that
the number of freshman and transfer
spaces in both Olivo-Magnolia and
Naranjawill remain unchanged.
