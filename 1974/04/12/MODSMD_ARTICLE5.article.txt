# Rich Backs Vote Weights
## 
### DON COX 
Clayton Rich, dean of the School
of Medicine, yesterday announced his
support of a controversial
vote-weighting scheme that would
reduce his school's effective voting
strength in the Academic Council to
50 percent of its present strength.
"I regret to agree that
reapportionment should occur," said
Rich in a special session of the Faculty
Senate called to discuss the Report of
the Committee on the Professoriate.

The weighting scheme, designed to
reduce the impact of schools with
large faculty bodies and small student
enrollment, weights Academic Council
members' votes in relation to the
number of students enrolled in their
respective schools. The report
recommends the change be applied to
mail ballots which might overturn a
decision of the Senate.
Straw Vote
In a straw vote of the Faculty
Senate yesterday the weighted voting
scheme passed overwhelmingly.
Results of straw votes are non-binding
and are procedural tools to provide
direction to discussions.
"The professional schools should
not dominate .. . and should nothave
the same weight on some matters,"
Rich said. He also felt that if no
reapportionment took place now,
people might react more violently in
the future against the rapid growth of
the Medical School's faculty.
"In my view, the Medical School is
suffering as much damage now as a
consequence of its increasing voting
strength [as the weighing scheme might
inflict].The issue is demoralizing to the
Medical School faculty."
University President Richard
Lyman agreed "that for the good of
the Medical School" it should be
far-sighted and support a
less-than-proportionate voting scheme.
Pittendrigh Agrees
Human Bio. Prof. Colin Pittendrigh
said, "Any university should avoid

being dominated in its governance by
professional schools. Humanities and
sciences are at the heart of the
University and the weighting factor is
one way of preserving humanities and
sciences as the heart." Pittendrigh is
chairman of the committee which
authored the report.
Provost William Miller agreed that
while "we do need the participation of
the professional schools, they should
not dominate. The humanities and
sciences, and to a certain extent
engineering and earth sciences, are
central to the University."
One Senate member disagreed that
the Medical School is "really a voting
block to be worried about and to
protect ourselves from." He said the
present one-person, one vote system
was "much wiser" and was responsible
for a "more harmonious Academic
Council." (Senate rules dictate that
members may not be quoted without
their specific permission when the
Senate is acting as the Committee of
the Whole.)

The dean of another professional
school added that "the head as well as
the heart of the University is in H & S.
I'm impresssed with the effort the
committee put into designing this
scheme and it's as sensible a set of
as one could ask for."
Another Senate member said, "We
should hold the Academic Council to
dealing with academic issues. The
Medical School faculty devotes less
time to academic affairs. The
weighting proposal gives some measure
of the total academic effort in each
school and is more equitable."
In other discussions, Piltendrigh
defended the mandatory use of a mail
ballot in the Academic Council to
overturn Senate decisions.
