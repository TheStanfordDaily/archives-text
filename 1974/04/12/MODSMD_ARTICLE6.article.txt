# Bacon, Herman Slates In Runoff; Program Fee Result In Question
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
Student voters yesterday narrowed
the ASSU Council of Presidents'
election to the 800 Bacon and Mike
Herman slates.
ASSU officials are not sure whether
the ASSU Program Fee assessment
passed. Although those voting
supported the fee's passage by a 3-1
margin, the total number of voters
may not have satisfied a minimum
turnout requirement in the
Constitution.
Because neither the Bacon nor
Herman slates received a majority of
the votes, a run-off election was
scheduled next week to decide the
winner.
Bacon's slate received 995 of 2445
votes cast (40.7 percent), the most of
any of the six groups. Co-Members of
Bacon's slate are Chris Baron, Maria
Echaveste and Jack Handy.

Herman's slate received 851 or 34.8
percent of the vote. Members of his
ticket include Ann Carter, Len Mackey
and Quinn Mayer. Though Herman's
slate trailed Bacon's by nearly six
percent of the vote, it
outdistanced the next closest slate,
Bruce Smyth's, by nearly 20 percent.
Voter turnout yesterday was the
lowest of any ASSU primary election
in recent memory.
The low voter turnout accounts for
the uncertainty about the passage of
the ASSU Program Fee assessment.
The ASSU Constitution requires that
20 percent of the student body vote in
an election to pass a fee assessment.
According to Elections Commissioner
Rick Haskell, the number of students
who voted on the assessment (2133)
may have fallen six votes short of
being 20 percent.

However, Haskell said, "For
practical purposes, the assessment has
passed." He said he is sure that at least
17 students at the Stanford in Britain
campus voted on the assessment, but
said he couldn't officially count these
votes because a portion of the
telegraphic message relaying the votes

was garbled.
ASSU Senate Chairman Reggie
Turner said he will call Western Union
early this morning to check the
message. Turner added that it might be
necessary to telegraph the Britain
campus to obtain its results.
Also delaying determination of the
percentage of students voting is that,
as of last night, no one knew exactly
how many students are registered this
quarter.
Registrar Sally Mahoney said she
could report this number at 6 p.m.
tonight, one hour after spring

registration has ended.
In any case, the ASSU Senate will
be the final body to interpret the
Constitution and rule whether or not
the assessment passed.
Another election dispute concerned
a polling site at the Medical School.
ASSU Sen. Mike Amylon complained

that medical students couldn't find
their polling site when its location
changed the second day. However,
Haskell and his two assistants
discounted Amylon's objections and
refused re-open the Med School pollint
site for further voting today.
Mayer of the Herman slate
complained that ballots were not
numbered to avoid possible "ballot
stuffing." Haskell said there was no
chance of this happening because the
number of students who signed voters
lists matched exactly the total number
of ballots.

Bacon's slate are Chris Baron, Maria
Echaveste and Jack Handy.

Herman's slate received 851 or 34.8
percent of the vote. Members of his
ticket include Ann Carter, Len Mackey
and Quinn Mayer. Though Herman's
slate trailed Bacon's by nearly six
percent of the vote, it
outdistanced the next closest slate,
Bruce Smyth's, by nearly 20 percent.
Voter turnout yesterday was the
lowest of any ASSU primary election
in recent memory.
The low voter turnout accounts for
the uncertainty about the passage of
the ASSU Program Fee assessment.
The ASSU Constitution requires that
20 percent of the student body vote in
an election to pass a fee assessment.
According to Elections Commissioner
Rick Haskell, the number of students
who voted on the assessment (2133)
may have fallen six votes short of
being 20 percent.

However, Haskell said, "For
practical purposes, the assessment has
passed." He said he is sure that at least
17 students at the Stanford in Britain
campus voted on the assessment, but
said he couldn't officially count these
votes because a portion of the
telegraphic message relaying the votes

was garbled.
ASSU Senate Chairman Reggie
Turner said he will call Western Union
early this morning to check the
message. Turner added that it might be
necessary to telegraph the Britain
campus to obtain its results.
Also delaying determination of the
percentage of students voting is that,
as of last night, no one knew exactly
how many students are registered this
quarter.
Registrar Sally Mahoney said she
could report this number at 6 p.m.
tonight, one hour after spring

registration has ended.
In any case, the ASSU Senate will
be the final body to interpret the
Constitution and rule whether or not
the assessment passed.
Another election dispute concerned
a polling site at the Medical School.
ASSU Sen. Mike Amylon complained

that medical students couldn't find
their polling site when its location
changed the second day. However,
Haskell and his two assistants
discounted Amylon's objections and
refused re-open the Med School pollint
site for further voting today.
Mayer of the Herman slate
complained that ballots were not
numbered to avoid possible "ballot
stuffing." Haskell said there was no
chance of this happening because the
number of students who signed voters
lists matched exactly the total number
of ballots.
Student voters yesterday narrowed
the ASSU Council of Presidents'
election to the 800 Bacon and Mike
Herman slates.
ASSU officials are not sure whether
the ASSU Program Fee assessment
passed. Although those voting
supported the fee's passage by a 3-1
margin, the total number of voters
may not have satisfied a minimum
turnout requirement in the
Constitution.
Because neither the Bacon nor
Herman slates received a majority of
the votes, a run-off election was
scheduled next week to decide the
winner.
Bacon's slate received 995 of 2445
votes cast (40.7 percent), the most of
any of the six groups. Co-Members of
Bacon's slate are Chris Baron, Maria
Echaveste and Jack Handy.

Herman's slate received 851 or 34.8
