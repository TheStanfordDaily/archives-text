# SWOPSI Head Lewis To Leave In August
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Dan Lewis, director of the Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social
Issues (SWOPSI), has decided not to
return to his position next year, the
Daily has learned.
Lewis, SWOPSI director for three
years, notified Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs Feb. 22 that he
would not seek to renew his yearly
contract with the University. Lewis'
contract expires August 31,1974.
"I've just decided to leave after
three years," Lewis told the Daily. He
added that his decision was for
"personal reasons. There was no
precipitating event."
Gibbs said Lewis had "done a good
job" and that the program would
"miss him." Gibbs emphasized there
was "no acrimony" in Lewis'

departure.
"I'm very pleased that he told me
as early as he did. That allowed the
[SWOPSI Polity Board) time to
decide what direction it wants the
program to take. It was a very
professional decision," he said.
The dean added that he and Lewis
had decided not to announce Lewis'
decision because it was "better for
SWOPSI" and because it was not a
"news item."
Next Year's Program
The SWOPSI Policy Board is
meeting now to discuss next year's
program and budget. The board is
expected to present its proposals to
Gibbs' office next week.
Gibbs said he will begin the search
for a new director once he receives the
board's report.
Lewis said he has not been
"grooming a successor" and that his
own plans for next year are still "in
limbo."
He also said he hoped Gibbs
approved a new budget for SWOPSI
"at a level similar to this year's"
because the program was "having a
real good year with over 62 workshops
and 1000 students."
"I've really enjoyed the three years
I've been here. I just hope the program
and the University go t as much as I
have," he commented.
Undergraduate Loss
B. Michael Closson, assistant dean
of undergraduate studies and Biggs'
liaison to SWOPSI termed Lewis'
departure "a loss for undergraduate
education at Stanfo rd.
