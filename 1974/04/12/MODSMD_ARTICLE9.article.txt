SCIRE-sponsored activity for 1974-75.
It would help provide educational
experiences not available to students
through the regular curriculum at
Stanford."
Cary Ridder, chairwoman of the
Policy Board, explained that the
work/study proposal grew "out of a
need for such a service" at the
University. More importantly, she said,
the purpose of such a service is to "try
to make Stanford more active in terms
of the surrounding community."
Toby Hayes, assistant professor of
applied mechanics, noted that the
initial purpose of the work/study
proposal was to "make information
available about [potential]
opportunities available on campus."
University-Wide Changes
The proposal notes that "an
outgrowth of the above [work/study]
activities could be an attempt by
SCIRE to recommend university-wide
changes in the organization and scope
of off-campus learning activities."
B. Michael Closson, assistant dean
of undergraduate studies, explained
that one of the new incentives for
increased participation in SCIRE is the

proposed innovation fund. Closson
explained that this $4,000 fund would
be used to facilitate innovative
projects that require financial support.
Four Criteria
In the SCIRE report, four criteria
comprised the guidelines for the
operation of the innovation fund.
First, a limit of $1,000 per project
would be imposed. Second, students
must play the biggest role in the
origination of a funded project. Third,
projects related to ongoing SCIRE
activities would be given preference.
Finally, projects would be funded for
one time only.
SCIRE operates under a dual
system of administration as explained
in the proposal. SCIRE is an agency of
the office of the dean of
undergraduate studies which serves as
the Director's immediate supervisor.
The Policy Board, however, sets
program policy for SCIRE and is
expected "to provide direct
supervision of the Director's
administration of the program"
according to the report.
Closson emphasized that good
communication is a necessity for
SCIRE to operate efficiently. The

proposal stresses this point, noting
that "communications should be of an
informal as well as a formal
nature .. . Even with frequent
interaction, formal communication is
in the interest of all parties."
Director's Duties
The Director's duties will involve
administration of SCIRE as well as
support of student projects. He will
also support the SCIRE task forces
that will be created *to study
University problems and help
administer the work/study and
innovation fund projects, according to
the proposal. The director will be
aided by a half-time assistant, Closson
remarked.
A search committee to name a new
director will be appointed shortly.
SCIRE has been without a director
since last May when the contract of W.
Ron Jones was not renewed by the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies.
Jones' firing engendered bitter
feelings and friction between the
Deans' office and the Policy Board.
His dismissal was upheld by an
independent arbiter in a controversial
decision last July.
Policy Board member John
Mensinger explained that on funding
SCIRE for 1974-75, the program will
have to compete with Urban Studies
and the Student Workshops on
Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI)
for money.
The SCIRE budget request for
1974-75 has been set at $25,140. Of
this total, $17,140 is for salary and
benefits, $3,800 is for materials and
project expenses, and $4,000 is for the
innovation fund.

feelings and friction between the
Deans' office and the Policy Board.
His dismissal was upheld by an

Policy Board member John
Mensinger explained that on funding
SCIRE for 1974-75, the program will
have to compete with Urban Studies
and the Student Workshops on
Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI)
for money.
The SCIRE budget request for
1974-75 has been set at $25,140. Of
this total, $17,140 is for salary and
benefits, $3,800 is for materials and
project expenses, and $4,000 is for the
innovation fund.

SCIRE-sponsored activity for 1974-75.
It would help provide educational
experiences not available to students
through the regular curriculum at
Stanford."
Cary Ridder, chairwoman of the
Policy Board, explained that the
work/study proposal grew "out of a
need for such a service" at the
University. More importantly, she said,
the purpose of such a service is to "try
to make Stanford more active in terms
of the surrounding community."
Toby Hayes, assistant professor of
applied mechanics, noted that the
initial purpose of the work/study
proposal was to "make information
available about [potential]
opportunities available on campus."
University-Wide Changes
The proposal notes that "an
outgrowth of the above [work/study]
activities could be an attempt by
SCIRE to recommend university-wide
changes in the organization and scope
of off-campus learning activities."
B. Michael Closson, assistant dean
of undergraduate studies, explained
that one of the new incentives for
increased participation in SCIRE is the

proposed innovation fund. Closson
explained that this $4,000 fund would
be used to facilitate innovative
projects that require financial support.
Four Criteria
In the SCIRE report, four criteria
comprised the guidelines for the
operation of the innovation fund.
First, a limit of $1,000 per project
would be imposed. Second, students
must play the biggest role in the
origination of a funded project. Third,
projects related to ongoing SCIRE
activities would be given preference.
Finally, projects would be funded for
one time only.
SCIRE operates under a dual
system of administration as explained
in the proposal. SCIRE is an agency of
the office of the dean of
undergraduate studies which serves as
the Director's immediate supervisor.
The Policy Board, however, sets
program policy for SCIRE and is
expected "to provide direct
supervision of the Director's
administration of the program"
according to the report.
Closson emphasized that good
communication is a necessity for
SCIRE to operate efficiently. The

proposal stresses this point, noting
that "communications should be of an
informal as well as a formal
nature .. . Even with frequent
interaction, formal communication is
in the interest of all parties."
Director's Duties
The Director's duties will involve
administration of SCIRE as well as
support of student projects. He will
also support the SCIRE task forces
that will be created *to study
University problems and help
administer the work/study and
innovation fund projects, according to
the proposal. The director will be
aided by a half-time assistant, Closson
remarked.
A search committee to name a new
director will be appointed shortly.
SCIRE has been without a director
since last May when the contract of W.
Ron Jones was not renewed by the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies.
