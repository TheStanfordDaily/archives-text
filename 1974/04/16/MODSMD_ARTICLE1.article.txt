# Patricia Hearst Named By FBI As Material Witness To Robbery
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY KEVIN SMITH 
Patricia Hearst was named
yesterday as a "material witness" to a
San Francisco bank robbery
apparently carried out by the
Symbionese Liberation Army.
An affadavit filed with the U.S.
magistrate in San Francisco placed
Hearst at the Sunset district branch of
the Hibernia Bank, which was robbed
of more than $10,000 by nine heavily
armed commandos.
The FBI said yesterday that it had
identified Hearst through photographs
of the robbery taken by a hidden
camera. U.S. Atty. James L. Browning
Jr. said he sought the "material
witness" warrant for Hearst because it
was not known whether she was
voluntarily participating in the
robbery.
Peter Markoff, 59, and Eugene
Brannan, 70, both received gunshot
wounds in the stomach during the
brief robbery. The two were taken to
Mission Emergency Hospital and later

transferred to San Francisco General
Hospital, where a spokeswoman told
the Daily last night that they were
listed in "satisfactory " condition.
"Stay And Fight"
Hearst, daughter of San Francisco
Examiner Editor Randolph A. Hearst,
was kidnaped from her Berkeley
apartment 71 days ago. On April 4,
she told her parents in a tape recording
that she had decided to "stay and
fight" alongside the SLA.
There has been no comment from
the FBI or from the robbers on the
reasons for choosing the Hibernia
Bank. However, Michael Tobin is
related to San Francisco Chronicle
Editor and Publisher Charles de Young
Theriot. Thus there is a possible
connection between the selection of
the Hibernia Bank and Hearst family
acquaintances.
Michael Tobin said, "The FBI
has asked us to make no comment on
the case."
However John Kelly, FBI assistant
special agent, said he knew of no such
request by the FBI and said the
participants in the case could say what
they wanted. "I have no idea at all
what he had reference to," added
Kelly about Tobin's statement.
Michael Tobin, when contacted
again, refused to give further
comment.
Richard Theriot, associate editor of
the Chronicle, said he had "no
opinion" on whether his family's
relation to the Tobin family might
have influenced the SLA to strike the
Hibernia Bank.
Possible Attack
He said he was not fearful of
possible attack on himself or his
family, and said he has not yet been
contacted by the FBI or encouraged to
take any precautionary measures.
Yesterday, the gunmen entered the
.Hibernia branch at 23rd Avenue and
Noriega at about 9:49 a.m. They

escaped with some $10,690, according
to Michael Tobin.
The U.S. magistrate has issued
arrest warrants for Nancy Ling Perry,
the self-styled "Fahizah" who has
previously communicated with the
press; Camille Christine Hall, also
previously alleged to be an SLA
member; and Michelle Soltysik, also
known as "Mizmoon," who has also
been previously identified as an SLA
member.
FBI Statement
An FBI news release stated:
"The material witness warrant for
Patricia Hearst was authorized by U.S.
Atty. James L. Browning Jr. in the
absence of specific evidence indicating
Patricia Hearst's participation in the
holdup of her own free will, and she
may have been acting under duress and
coercion."
Hearst apparently held a gun during
the lightning raid— but photos of the

scene did not rule out speculation that
at least one of the other SLA members
might have kept a gun pointed at her.
The nine commandos left in two
rented cars, both of which were
recovered nearby. Police and FBI
agents hunted door-to-door in the
residential Sunset district without
success.
SLA Members
The commandos reportedly
identified themselves as SLA members
during the holdup. Vincent Greely, a
security officer at the bank, said, "The
people came in and said they were
members of the SLA. They told
people to lie on the floor and then
they went to the tellers' cages and
took the money ... they were in and
out within two minutes."
Hearst's parents were vacationing in
Mexico when they received word of
the robbery. They were reportedly en
route back to their Hillsborough home
yesterday.

Examiner Editor Randolph A. Hearst,
was kidnaped from her Berkeley
apartment 71 days ago. On April 4,
she told her parents in a tape recording
that she had decided to "stay and
fight" alongside the SLA.
There has been no comment from
the FBI or from the robbers on the
reasons for choosing the Hibernia
Bank. However, Michael Tobin is
related to San Francisco Chronicle
Editor and Publisher Charles de Young
Theriot. Thus there is a possible
connection between the selection of
the Hibernia Bank and Hearst family
acquaintances.
Michael Tobin said, "The FBI
has asked us to make no comment on
the case."
However John Kelly, FBI assistant
special agent, said he knew of no such
request by the FBI and said the
participants in the case could say what
they wanted. "I have no idea at all
what he had reference to," added
Kelly about Tobin's statement.
Michael Tobin, when contacted
again, refused to give further
comment.
Richard Theriot, associate editor of
the Chronicle, said he had "no
opinion" on whether his family's
relation to the Tobin family might
have influenced the SLA to strike the
Hibernia Bank.
Possible Attack
He said he was not fearful of
possible attack on himself or his
family, and said he has not yet been
contacted by the FBI or encouraged to
take any precautionary measures.
Yesterday, the gunmen entered the
.Hibernia branch at 23rd Avenue and
Noriega at about 9:49 a.m. They

escaped with some $10,690, according
to Michael Tobin.
The U.S. magistrate has issued
arrest warrants for Nancy Ling Perry,
the self-styled "Fahizah" who has
previously communicated with the
press; Camille Christine Hall, also
previously alleged to be an SLA
member; and Michelle Soltysik, also
known as "Mizmoon," who has also
been previously identified as an SLA
member.
FBI Statement
An FBI news release stated:
"The material witness warrant for
Patricia Hearst was authorized by U.S.
Atty. James L. Browning Jr. in the
absence of specific evidence indicating
Patricia Hearst's participation in the
holdup of her own free will, and she
may have been acting under duress and
coercion."
Hearst apparently held a gun during
the lightning raid— but photos of the

scene did not rule out speculation that
at least one of the other SLA members
might have kept a gun pointed at her.
The nine commandos left in two
rented cars, both of which were
recovered nearby. Police and FBI
agents hunted door-to-door in the
residential Sunset district without
success.
SLA Members
The commandos reportedly
identified themselves as SLA members
during the holdup. Vincent Greely, a
security officer at the bank, said, "The
people came in and said they were
members of the SLA. They told
people to lie on the floor and then
they went to the tellers' cages and
took the money ... they were in and
out within two minutes."
Hearst's parents were vacationing in
Mexico when they received word of
the robbery. They were reportedly en
route back to their Hillsborough home
yesterday.


PATRICIA HEARST?—FBI agents think this is Patricia Hearst participating in a
bank robbery yesterday. Federal authorities are now seeking her as a material
witness in connection with the case.
Patricia Hearst was named
yesterday as a "material witness" to a
San Francisco bank robbery
apparently carried out by the
Symbionese Liberation Army.
An affadavit filed with the U.S.
magistrate in San Francisco placed
Hearst at the Sunset district branch of
the Hibernia Bank, which was robbed
of more than $10,000 by nine heavily
armed commandos.
The FBI said yesterday that it had
identified Hearst through photographs
of the robbery taken by a hidden
camera. U.S. Atty. James L. Browning
Jr. said he sought the "material
witness" warrant for Hearst because it
was not known whether she was
voluntarily participating in the
robbery.
Peter Markoff, 59, and Eugene
Brannan, 70, both received gunshot
wounds in the stomach during the
brief robbery. The two were taken to
Mission Emergency Hospital and later

transferred to San Francisco General
Hospital, where a spokeswoman told
the Daily last night that they were
listed in "satisfactory " condition.
