# USE Proposals Spell Cost Increase
## 
###

Two recent Daily letters have attacked the
University's position on economic issues in
negotiation with United Stanford Employees
(USE).
The cost of living escalator defended by
Tim Knaak of the USE Steering Committee is
but one comparatively small item on an
extensive list of economic proposals which
would more than double Stanford's labor
costs. Others include:
1. Wage increases averaging 33 percent by
USE's own estimates. Where USE initially
proclaimed Stanford wages were 33 percent
below the market, at the bargaining table USE
admitted its 33 percent proposal was
designed to move Stanford scales from their
traditional mid-market position to the 75th
percentile — well above average.
2. A retirement plan providing for income
benefits substantially in excess of the highest
rate ever earned while working. Its costs have
been conservatively estimated at 54 percent
of payroll, compared to the current rate of six
percent of participant's wages. USE at the
bargaining table acknowledged that they
knew of no employer in the country with
such an extravagant plan.
Vacation Increase
3. Two additional weeks of vacation for
all employees with more than three years of
service, and one additional week for those
with less than three years service. USE has
adhered to this proposal even after
acknowledging that present Stanford benefits
— three weeks vacation a year for the first
decade of service, and four weeks thereafter
— are superior to those of most other
employers.
4. Five more paid holidays, in addition to
the present nine. Again, USE knew of no
other employers who provided so many

holidays, but refused to reduce its proposal
even when the University offered to add one
paid holiday.
5. Unlimited sick leave after the first
year's service. Again, USE knew of no other
employer besides USE itself who provided
such benefits.
Medical Coverage Extension
6. Extension of University paid basic and
major medical coverage to include
dependents, and the addition of a fully paid
drug and* dental plan for employees and
dependents.
The current wage and benefit base for
approximately 1400 bargaining unit members
is about $15 million, or between $10,000
and $11,000 per employee. While only very
approximate cost estimates can be developed
on many USE proposals, it is clear these six
items alone would more than double current
costs.
Further USE proposals call for the
University to build and operate three high
quality child care centers, build low cost
housing and provide mobile home sites,
furnish each worker one-tenth of an acre for
a vegetable garden, establish an employee
legal services plan, provide time off for more
than 100 members of the bargaining unit on
union business, double the allowable tuition
benefits and expand coverage to include
worker's spouse and "any constant member
of the worker's household," and nine
different kinds of premium pay to be
routinely added to base wages when various
premium conditions are met.
Common Practice
Many unions at the outset of negotiations
formulate proposals which are patently
beyond reason, reducing them to more
realistic levels after a short time.

What has been discouraging to those who
desire an equitable and early settlement is
that after three and a half months of
bargaining, much of which has been
productive on non-economic items, USE has
not reduced its economic proposals one cent.
Moreover, USE has interrupted face-to
face negotiations without even responding to
several recent University proposals, including
those on job classifications and premium pay.
USE Impedes Progress
Its failure to do so impedes progress on
the economic issues, for it is impossible to
determine wage costs in a particular
classification until it is clear, for example,
whether additional staff must be hired to
absorb time off allowances, whether the
classification will include hazardous duty
pay, as USE proposes.
The University negotiating team has tried
to make its position clear to USE. The
University has not made its last offer on
economic matters and believes that as most
cost-related items are resolved, it can improve
its current position on wages and benefits at
the bargaining table.
We hope, with Knaak, that negotiations
will be complete by June. And we hope, with
Jessee Calvillo of MECHA, that the results
will not require additional tuition or room
and board charges.
If both objectives are to be met, however,
the parties must resume negotiations
promptly with a renewed determination to
reach agreement on a basis which is fair and
equitable to all members of the Stanford
community, whether employee or student,
bargaining unit or non-bargaining unit,
faculty or staff.

would more than double Stanford's labor
costs. Others include:
1. Wage increases averaging 33 percent by
USE's own estimates. Where USE initially
proclaimed Stanford wages were 33 percent
below the market, at the bargaining table USE
admitted its 33 percent proposal was
designed to move Stanford scales from their
traditional mid-market position to the 75th
percentile — well above average.
2. A retirement plan providing for income
benefits substantially in excess of the highest
rate ever earned while working. Its costs have
been conservatively estimated at 54 percent
of payroll, compared to the current rate of six
percent of participant's wages. USE at the
bargaining table acknowledged that they
knew of no employer in the country with
such an extravagant plan.
Vacation Increase
3. Two additional weeks of vacation for
all employees with more than three years of
service, and one additional week for those
with less than three years service. USE has
adhered to this proposal even after
acknowledging that present Stanford benefits
— three weeks vacation a year for the first
decade of service, and four weeks thereafter
— are superior to those of most other
employers.
4. Five more paid holidays, in addition to
the present nine. Again, USE knew of no
other employers who provided so many

holidays, but refused to reduce its proposal
even when the University offered to add one
paid holiday.
5. Unlimited sick leave after the first
year's service. Again, USE knew of no other
employer besides USE itself who provided
such benefits.
Medical Coverage Extension
6. Extension of University paid basic and
major medical coverage to include
dependents, and the addition of a fully paid
drug and* dental plan for employees and
dependents.
The current wage and benefit base for
approximately 1400 bargaining unit members
is about $15 million, or between $10,000
and $11,000 per employee. While only very
approximate cost estimates can be developed
on many USE proposals, it is clear these six
items alone would more than double current
costs.
Further USE proposals call for the
University to build and operate three high
quality child care centers, build low cost
housing and provide mobile home sites,
furnish each worker one-tenth of an acre for
a vegetable garden, establish an employee
legal services plan, provide time off for more
than 100 members of the bargaining unit on
union business, double the allowable tuition
benefits and expand coverage to include
worker's spouse and "any constant member
of the worker's household," and nine
different kinds of premium pay to be
routinely added to base wages when various
premium conditions are met.
Common Practice
Many unions at the outset of negotiations
formulate proposals which are patently
beyond reason, reducing them to more
realistic levels after a short time.

What has been discouraging to those who
desire an equitable and early settlement is
that after three and a half months of
bargaining, much of which has been
productive on non-economic items, USE has
not reduced its economic proposals one cent.
Moreover, USE has interrupted face-to
face negotiations without even responding to
several recent University proposals, including
those on job classifications and premium pay.
USE Impedes Progress
Its failure to do so impedes progress on
the economic issues, for it is impossible to
determine wage costs in a particular
classification until it is clear, for example,
whether additional staff must be hired to
absorb time off allowances, whether the
classification will include hazardous duty
pay, as USE proposes.
The University negotiating team has tried
to make its position clear to USE. The
University has not made its last offer on
economic matters and believes that as most
cost-related items are resolved, it can improve
its current position on wages and benefits at
the bargaining table.
We hope, with Knaak, that negotiations
will be complete by June. And we hope, with
Jessee Calvillo of MECHA, that the results
will not require additional tuition or room
and board charges.
If both objectives are to be met, however,
the parties must resume negotiations
promptly with a renewed determination to
reach agreement on a basis which is fair and
equitable to all members of the Stanford
community, whether employee or student,
bargaining unit or non-bargaining unit,
faculty or staff.
