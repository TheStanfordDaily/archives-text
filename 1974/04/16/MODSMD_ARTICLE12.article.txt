# Franklin, Colorado And Hypocrisy
## 
### 
William Ross

Although Stanford fired H.
Bruce Franklin more than two
years ago, the issue of his
dismissal is still a topic of
considerable interest on campus.
Hence, many people here were
interested to learn last week that
the University of Colorado has
voted to give Franklin a position
in its English department. The
Colorado Board of Regents is
expected to vote at its meeting
this month upon whether to
seat him.
Paul Levitt, chairman of the
English department at the
University of Colorado, has
expressed confidence that the
Regents will approve Franklin's
appointment. Only one Regent
publicly opposes Franklin, and
several Regents claim they will
probably vote to hire Franklin.
The purpose of this column is
not to discuss the question of
whether Franklin should have
been fired. Nor do I wish to
speculate upon whether or not the
University of Colorado is right to
hire Franklin.
Hypocritical Attitude
Rather, I wish to point out
what I believe to be the
hypocritical attitude of certain
people at the University of
Colorado.
Paul Levitt, head of the English
department there, has asserted
that the political views of
Franklin are irrelevant to the
consideration of his academic
credentials.
But he obviously hasn't studied
the report of the Stanford
advisory committee that
recommended Franklin's
dismissal. If he had, he would
realize that rightly or wrongly,
Franklin was not dismissed for his
Maoist ideology but rather for the
practical consequences of his

exhortations to students during a
time of campus turmoil.
'Catalyst To Violence'
Levitt maintains that the
termination of campus unrest in
recent years is not a factor in the
plan to hire Franklin. Levitt
insists that even if student revolt
were imminent, the University of
Colorado would still hire
Franklin, even though he might be
a catalyst to violence.
It is easy for Levitt, during an
apathetic campus spring, to
declare as he did last week that
the University of Colorado is a
more liberal institution than
Stanford. If this were the winter
of 1971, and a potentially
explosive political situation
prevailed at the University of
Colorado, I believe his attitude
might be different — and the

attitude of the Regents would
almost certainly be less amenable
to Franklin.
A good example of the
University of Colorado's type of
liberalism is demonstrated by
what a Colorado Regent told me
last week during an interview. The
Regent stated that he will
probably vote to hire Franklin as
he believes in giving everyone an
opportunity to prove his worth.
"Of course," he added casually,
"if Franklin becomes
obstreperous, we can always
dismiss him."
Views Outdated?
But it is unlikely that Franklin
would be dismissed if hired by the
University of Colorado. In the
current political context,
Franklin's views are almost
anachronistic. He is a relatively

innocuous relic of the now
enervated Movement.
If University of Colorado
employs Franklin, the polite
academics there could
congratulate themselves on their
liberalism. Franklin would serve as
a useful symbol of the supposed
openmindedness of the very
people who would run and hide in
the nearest faculty lounge if a
large number of students began to
give literal expression to
Franklin's views.
In short, if Franklin posed any
threat to the peace of the
University of Colorado, he would
have probably no chance of
obtaining a position there. And
anyone at the University of
Colorado who denies this is a
hypocrite.

Although Stanford fired H.
Bruce Franklin more than two
years ago, the issue of his
dismissal is still a topic of
considerable interest on campus.
Hence, many people here were
interested to learn last week that
the University of Colorado has
voted to give Franklin a position
in its English department. The
Colorado Board of Regents is
expected to vote at its meeting
this month upon whether to
seat him.
Paul Levitt, chairman of the
English department at the
University of Colorado, has
expressed confidence that the
Regents will approve Franklin's
appointment. Only one Regent
publicly opposes Franklin, and
several Regents claim they will
probably vote to hire Franklin.
The purpose of this column is
not to discuss the question of
whether Franklin should have
been fired. Nor do I wish to
speculate upon whether or not the
University of Colorado is right to
hire Franklin.
Hypocritical Attitude
Rather, I wish to point out
what I believe to be the
hypocritical attitude of certain
people at the University of
Colorado.
Paul Levitt, head of the English
department there, has asserted
that the political views of
Franklin are irrelevant to the
consideration of his academic
credentials.
But he obviously hasn't studied
the report of the Stanford
advisory committee that
recommended Franklin's
dismissal. If he had, he would
realize that rightly or wrongly,
Franklin was not dismissed for his
Maoist ideology but rather for the
practical consequences of his

exhortations to students during a
time of campus turmoil.
'Catalyst To Violence'
Levitt maintains that the
termination of campus unrest in
recent years is not a factor in the
plan to hire Franklin. Levitt
insists that even if student revolt
were imminent, the University of
Colorado would still hire
Franklin, even though he might be
a catalyst to violence.
It is easy for Levitt, during an
apathetic campus spring, to
declare as he did last week that
the University of Colorado is a
more liberal institution than
Stanford. If this were the winter
of 1971, and a potentially
explosive political situation
prevailed at the University of
Colorado, I believe his attitude
might be different — and the

attitude of the Regents would
almost certainly be less amenable
to Franklin.
A good example of the
University of Colorado's type of
liberalism is demonstrated by
what a Colorado Regent told me
last week during an interview. The
Regent stated that he will
probably vote to hire Franklin as
he believes in giving everyone an
opportunity to prove his worth.
"Of course," he added casually,
"if Franklin becomes
obstreperous, we can always
dismiss him."
Views Outdated?
But it is unlikely that Franklin
would be dismissed if hired by the
University of Colorado. In the
current political context,
Franklin's views are almost
anachronistic. He is a relatively

innocuous relic of the now
enervated Movement.
If University of Colorado
employs Franklin, the polite
academics there could
congratulate themselves on their
liberalism. Franklin would serve as
a useful symbol of the supposed
openmindedness of the very
people who would run and hide in
the nearest faculty lounge if a
large number of students began to
give literal expression to
Franklin's views.
In short, if Franklin posed any
threat to the peace of the
University of Colorado, he would
have probably no chance of
obtaining a position there. And
anyone at the University of
Colorado who denies this is a
hypocrite.
