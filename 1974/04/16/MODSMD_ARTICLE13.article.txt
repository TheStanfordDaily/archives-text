# PIC Needs Your Support

One of the basic problems
facing prison inmates when they
are released from a penal
institution is finding employment.
Income is obviously essential for
physical survival and if money
cannot be obtained legally an
ex-convict may be forced back to
a life of crime, arrest and
re-imprisonment.
In an attempt to combat this
vicious circle the Prison
Information Center (PIC) has
initiated the La Honda Job
Placement Program.
Modeled on a San Francisco
County program, our Job
Placement program seeks to assist
inmates of La Honda Honor Camp

in finding job openings before the
prisoners are released. Volunteers
from the community work on a
one-to-one basis with the inmates.
Inmates Interviewed
Each volunteer interviews one
inmate regarding the latter's
previous work experience, skills
training and preference. Each
volunteer then telephones local
employers in order to discuss the
possibility of hiring an ex-convict
and to set up a job interview.
This project has enormous
value to prison inmates, all of
whom must have employement.
The PIC would like to involve
students in the pilot run of the
program. Its success or failure

depends directly on manpower.
The first meeting of the project
will be early this week.
If you have time, interest
and/or concern for individuals just
released from prison, or if you are
interested in observing at first
hand the workings of the criminal
justice system, please contact us
at once. We badly need your help.
Call Margaret Bullitt, 324-1368,
Mike Minieka, 327-2330, 01
Susan Mercure, 326-6700, for
more information. Someone's
future depends on it.
