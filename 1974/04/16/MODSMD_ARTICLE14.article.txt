# Sigma Chi's Ideals
## 
### 
| Michael Grasfyl
What type of empathy do the
Chicano and Native American
movements expect to stir when
they are allegedly represented by
members who engage in activities
which reflect the ignorance,
bitterness, prejudice, and wild
generalizations with which they
express themselves?
I refer to the incident in which
someone defaced the sign which
members of Sigma Chi painted on
the Law School fence which faces
UGLY. This sign was erected with
great care and many hours of
work in order to let Stanford
students know that "SIGMA CHI
IS BACK," meaning that Sigma
Chi Omega has been re-admitted
into its international parent
organization.
Those who live near our house
have seen the many hours of work
which we have invested in order
to make it into a more pleasant
place in which to live.
This same pride and strength of
conviction is what led the
members of our house to apply
for the return of our charter.
After more than a year's work we
have succeeded. We can once
again call ourselves Sigma Chis.
High Ideals
The Sigma Chi International
Fraternity is an organization
based on high ideals, and it is
solely interested in the
development of the undergraduate
university student's character
through the brotherhood evoked
in fraternal living.
The brothers of Sigma Chi
believed that the best way to
develop character is through the
cultivation of close friendships
with men of "different
temperaments, talents, and
convictions," as expressed in The
Spirit of Sigma Chi.
As a Chilean I resent the fact
that the name of my country was
painted on the wall together with
all the other inane comments, but
as a member of Sigma Chi I feel
pain, frustration, bitterness, anger
and disappointment when I read
the libelous comments affixed to
our sign.
Racism, Fascism
I do not consider myself an
expert on the subject of racism
and fascism, but I have learned
that Che Guevara was a serious
man dedicated to a worthy cause
who did not spew forth
meaningless discharges. He was an
individual who believed in
courage, justice and pride, and did
not see fit to hide his activities by
the protective anonymity of
darkness.
I do not feel that it is just to
make any one group or
organization responsible for this
outrageous act, but I sincerely
believe the members of Sigma Chi
have been unjustly attacked. It
seems tragically ironic that the
perpetrator of this highly illiberal
attack have done so in the name
of liberty ("VIVA LI3ERTAD")
upon an organization, Sigma Chi,
of which the defamers have no
knowledge or even the curiosity
to find out.
Perhaps those responsible
would find it within themselves to
remedy their wrongdoings by
submitting a public apology or a
willingness to take into
consideration a more mature and
intelligent perspective of the
worth of the Fraternal System.
Our sign reflected the pride
which we feel for our house, those
who live in it, and the Sigma Chi
International Fraternity. Now our
attempts at expressing our feeling
of brotherhood have been
obliterated by the ugly, violent
spectre of willful superficiality.
