Mike Herman et 01.

Now that the race for the
Council of Presidents has been
narrowed to two slates, we feel
that the time has arrived to
examine the clear differences
between the remaining tickets,
differences which each student
should bear in mind while casting
his/her vote tomorrow and
Thursday.
There are three major areas in
which the Herman-Carter-Mackey-
Mayer slate differs from that of
Bacon-Baron-Echaveste-Handy.
The first and most obvious to
the electorate is the approach
each has taken toward the
campaign itself. We feel that the
primary role of the ASSU Council
of Presidents is to initiate,
organize, and support effectively
programs and services to students
that can be provided by no other
source.
Consequently, we have devoted
much of our literature to defining
a few realistic services which we
would like to bring to the
Stanford community. These
proposals were developed in great
depth in our 44-page booklet
which was submitted to the Daily,
including the means we plan to
use to organize and finance the
programs.
Opponents Divided
In sharp contrast, our
opponents have divided their time
between indicating their support
for vague, conventional issues on
which they would have little
direct influence, and attempting
to mount an attack on our
proposals.
Yet, it would clearly be of
greater benefit to the student
body to have available a
well-organized, working, lecture
note service such as we propose
than to have established yet
another bureaucratic task force to
look into changes in the
curriculumn, an activity best
suited for the already-existing
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
The second distinction
between the two slates lies in the
area of past performance. Our
opponents have been involved
primarily in groups peripheral to
the ASSU, groups of recent origin,
and groups dedicated to the
pursuit of special interests rather
than the student body as a whole.
'Novel Perspective'?
While such involvement might
appear to reflect a novel
perspective on the issues facing
the ASSU Council of Presidents, it
similarly reflects a lack of
familiarity both with the
organization with which they will
be forced to work and with the
central concerns of the majority

of the students at Stanford.
This deficiency is
demonstrated in the vague
generalities that are incorporated
in their platform; they exhibit a
dearth of understanding as to
what the Council of Presidents
can and cannot accomplish.
This understanding is the
cornerstone of our slate. Through
the ASSU Senate, University
committees, and other
organizations of the ASSU, we
have exhibited, in our work, our
commitment to the entire
Stanford student body, not
limited factions of it.
Well-Acquainted
Particularly through our
involvement in the committee
system, we are well-acquainted
with how students are most able
to be effective within the
University structure. That
knowledge is invaluable to a
newly-elected Council of
Presidents, especially in
negotiating with the
administration on the students'
behalf.
The final contrast between the
two slates lies in determining their
relative efficiency once elected.
Our opponents have taken pride
in gaining the endorsement of the
present ASSU Council; in point of
fact, the Bacon slate's listed
qualifications have come largely
from association with programs
fostered by the O'Grady
administration.
Yet, as the Daily pointed out
in its editorial of April 10, few of
the promises on which the present
COP ran "have been kept,
whether through inactivity or
insurmountable difficulties."
Accept Responsibility
If our opponents are going to
embrace the philosophy of the
present ASSU Council as the road
to success, they must be prepared
to accept partial responsibility for
the failures of that Council.
In contrast, our ticket
approaches office having already
demonstrated the readiness to
revitalize the ASSU and provide
services the student body has a
right to expect. No other slate of
candidates has ever run for the
Council of Presidents with as
much experience and preparation
to expedite their proposals.
The structure of the ASSU
exists to serve its constituents —
all of the students — and its
primary purpose is to help
improve the quality of student
life. We believe the choice in this
election is clear.

Mackey and Quinn Mayer are
candidates for ASSU Council of
Presidents.)

Yet, it would clearly be of
greater benefit to the student
body to have available a
well-organized, working, lecture
note service such as we propose
than to have established yet
another bureaucratic task force to
look into changes in the
curriculumn, an activity best
suited for the already-existing
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
The second distinction
between the two slates lies in the
area of past performance. Our
opponents have been involved
primarily in groups peripheral to
the ASSU, groups of recent origin,
and groups dedicated to the
pursuit of special interests rather
than the student body as a whole.
'Novel Perspective'?
While such involvement might
appear to reflect a novel
perspective on the issues facing
the ASSU Council of Presidents, it
similarly reflects a lack of
familiarity both with the
organization with which they will
be forced to work and with the
central concerns of the majority

of the students at Stanford.
This deficiency is
demonstrated in the vague
generalities that are incorporated
in their platform; they exhibit a
dearth of understanding as to
what the Council of Presidents
can and cannot accomplish.
This understanding is the
cornerstone of our slate. Through
the ASSU Senate, University
committees, and other
organizations of the ASSU, we
have exhibited, in our work, our
commitment to the entire
Stanford student body, not
limited factions of it.
Well-Acquainted
Particularly through our
involvement in the committee
system, we are well-acquainted
with how students are most able
to be effective within the
University structure. That
knowledge is invaluable to a
newly-elected Council of
Presidents, especially in
negotiating with the
administration on the students'
behalf.
The final contrast between the
two slates lies in determining their
relative efficiency once elected.
Our opponents have taken pride
in gaining the endorsement of the
present ASSU Council; in point of
fact, the Bacon slate's listed
qualifications have come largely
from association with programs
fostered by the O'Grady
administration.
Yet, as the Daily pointed out
in its editorial of April 10, few of
the promises on which the present
COP ran "have been kept,
whether through inactivity or
insurmountable difficulties."
Accept Responsibility
If our opponents are going to
embrace the philosophy of the
present ASSU Council as the road
to success, they must be prepared
to accept partial responsibility for
the failures of that Council.
In contrast, our ticket
approaches office having already
demonstrated the readiness to
revitalize the ASSU and provide
services the student body has a
right to expect. No other slate of
candidates has ever run for the
Council of Presidents with as
much experience and preparation
to expedite their proposals.
The structure of the ASSU
exists to serve its constituents —
all of the students — and its
primary purpose is to help
improve the quality of student
life. We believe the choice in this
election is clear.
(Mike Herman, Ann Carter, ben
Mackey and Quinn Mayer are
candidates for ASSU Council of
Presidents.)
Mike Herman et 01.

Now that the race for the
Council of Presidents has been
narrowed to two slates, we feel
that the time has arrived to
examine the clear differences
between the remaining tickets,
differences which each student
should bear in mind while casting
his/her vote tomorrow and
Thursday.
There are three major areas in
which the Herman-Carter-Mackey-
Mayer slate differs from that of
Bacon-Baron-Echaveste-Handy.
The first and most obvious to
the electorate is the approach
each has taken toward the
campaign itself. We feel that the
primary role of the ASSU Council
of Presidents is to initiate,
organize, and support effectively
programs and services to students
that can be provided by no other
source.
Consequently, we have devoted
much of our literature to defining
a few realistic services which we
would like to bring to the
Stanford community. These
proposals were developed in great
depth in our 44-page booklet
which was submitted to the Daily,
including the means we plan to
use to organize and finance the
programs.
Opponents Divided
In sharp contrast, our
opponents have divided their time
between indicating their support
for vague, conventional issues on
which they would have little
direct influence, and attempting
to mount an attack on our
proposals.
Yet, it would clearly be of
greater benefit to the student
body to have available a
well-organized, working, lecture
note service such as we propose
