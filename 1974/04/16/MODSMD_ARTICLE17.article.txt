Fee Assessments

Kevin O'Grady

The members of the ASSU
Council of Presidents believe that
all six fee assessments appearing
on this Wednesday's and
Thursday's ballot are responsible
proposals for programs which are
of significant benefit to the
student body, and that all six
merit support. We would like to
comment on several of these
proposals.
The ASSU Legal Counseling
Office, now in its third quarter of
operation, has filled an important
need. Statistics for the first four
months of operation showed that
75 student clients were being seen
each month.
Their legal problems included
consumer, tort, family, housing
and criminal problems, to name
only the more common. It is
worth noting that graduate
students, who are often reluctant
to support fee assessments,
constituted 64 percent of the
cases.
Guest Professorship
We strongly support the fee
assessment to fund the ASSU
Guest Professorship. This program
has existed for almost 10 years,
but for the last five years, it has
not been funded.
ASSU Guest Professors are
invited by the ASSU Senate and
must be sponsored by an
academic department so that their
courses will be accredited. This

program is an excellent way of
bringing to campus people to
whom students would not
ordinarily be exposed in a
Stanford education.
We also support the resolution
to invite Nguyen Huu Thai as
ASSU Guest Professor. Thai, a
prominent Vietnamese journalist
who campaigned for peace, is a
political prisoner jailed by the
Thieu regime If Stanford invites
him, there is an excellent chance
that he will be able to come.
Other political prisoners have
been released to accept positions
at American universities.
Congressman McCloskey,
Râ€”Menlo Park, has said he is
willing to exert pressure to have
Thai released.
All Not Needed
It is our understanding that
Thai would not need all of the
funds from the fee assessment and
that a sizeable part of the money
would be available to invite
someone else as well.
We urge students to vote yes
on the fee assessments to fund the
ASSU Legal Counseling Office,
the Public Interest Research
Group, the ASSU Guest
Professorship and also the fee
assessments for the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, KZSU, and the
Band.
