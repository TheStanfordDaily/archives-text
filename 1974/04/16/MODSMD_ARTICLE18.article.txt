# ...Or Elect Bacon
## Opinions 
### 
800 Bacon et al.

Our candidacy is based on the
belief that the ASSU Council of
Presidents should not restrict its
activities to the area of student
services but should also deal with
student involvement in
educational and social change, and
that the Council should be
responsive to the interests of all
students, including women,
minority, and graduate students.
The quality of Stanford
education will be one of our
primary concerns as the Council
of Presidents. We believe
undergraduate education suffers
from a policy which may be
described as "benign neglect."
SWOPSI and SCIRE, student
initiated programs with solid
records of accomplishment, are
under attack. ARLO (Action
Research Liaison Office) is in an
embryonic state.
Chris Baron's experience as
chairwoman of the SWOPSI
Board gives her the insight
necessary to deal effectively with
these issues. As a Daily editorial
stated, "her work on the SWOPSI
Policy Board has been especially
valuable in keeping that important
program going."
Curriculum Gaps
We propose to establish, in
conjunction with SCIRE, a Task
Force on Curriculum to deal with
the need for alternative
introductory courses and
curriculum gaps.

Historically, curriculum has
been an area of effective ASSU
involvement. The Task Force will
serve as an effective means to raise
questions about the scope of
course offerings.
We will also work to
supplement the current advising
system with upperclass advisors
on the model of the Advisors
Associates Program successfully
used by the Engineering
Department this year.
Student Services
While our slate will not
concentrate solely on student
services, we have advanced several
proposals in this area which we
think are sound. We hope to
publish a Guide to Off Campus
Living that would provide
information on various aspects of
off campus life.
Secondly, we propose to
establish a Stanford Flea Market
that would enable students to sell
various goods to one another at
low prices. Thirdly, we support
NorCal PIRG's (Public Interest
Research Group) effort to provide
students with valuable
information on consumer issues
while engaging them in
meaningful research. Jack Handy
has been Chairman of NorCal
PIRG and will work to develop
the program to its full potential at
Stanford.
We have been attacked for
representing "special interests"
because of our concern for

minority affairs. We believe,
however, that all students benefit
from a culturally, ethnically and
sexually diverse university and
that the university and its
students should be committed to
racial and sexual equality.
Goals Pursued Actively
800 Bacon as editor of the
Real News and Maria Echaveste as
co-chairwoman of MECHA have
actively pursued these goals. Both
have also been active in the ASSU
Senate, with Maria serving as
vice-chairwoman .
As ASSU Council of
Presidents, we will perform an
advocacy role in University
decision-making. We support
affirmative action in admission,
hiring, and tenure practices.
We support land use policies
reflecting the' University's
academic function and residential
character. We support investment
policies which emphasize
corporate responsibility.
Our approach to the ASSU, as
the Daily has noted, is less
sweeping than that of other slates,
but we think it is more honest and
realistic. We feel that our
collective experience and
sensitivity to student needs will
allow us to meet a substantial
portion' of the goals that we have
set for the ASSU in this campaign.

character. We support investment
policies which emphasize
corporate responsibility.
Our approach to the ASSU, as
the Daily has noted, is less
sweeping than that of other slates,
but we think it is more honest and
realistic. We feel that our
collective experience and
sensitivity to student needs will
allow us to meet a substantial
portion' of the goals that we have
set for the ASSU in this campaign.
(800 Bacon, Chris Baron, Maria
Echaveste and Jack Handy are
candidates for ASSU Council of
Presidents.)
800 Bacon et al.

Our candidacy is based on the
belief that the ASSU Council of
Presidents should not restrict its
activities to the area of student
services but should also deal with
student involvement in
educational and social change, and
that the Council should be
responsive to the interests of all
students, including women,
minority, and graduate students.
The quality of Stanford
education will be one of our
primary concerns as the Council
of Presidents. We believe
undergraduate education suffers
from a policy which may be
described as "benign neglect."
SWOPSI and SCIRE, student
initiated programs with solid
records of accomplishment, are
under attack. ARLO (Action
Research Liaison Office) is in an
embryonic state.
Chris Baron's experience as
chairwoman of the SWOPSI
Board gives her the insight
necessary to deal effectively with
these issues. As a Daily editorial
stated, "her work on the SWOPSI
Policy Board has been especially
valuable in keeping that important
program going."
Curriculum Gaps
We propose to establish, in
conjunction with SCIRE, a Task
Force on Curriculum to deal with
the need for alternative
introductory courses and
curriculum gaps.

Historically, curriculum has
been an area of effective ASSU
involvement. The Task Force will
serve as an effective means to raise
questions about the scope of
course offerings.
We will also work to
supplement the current advising
system with upperclass advisors
on the model of the Advisors
Associates Program successfully
used by the Engineering
Department this year.
Student Services
While our slate will not
concentrate solely on student
services, we have advanced several
proposals in this area which we
think are sound. We hope to
publish a Guide to Off Campus
Living that would provide
information on various aspects of
off campus life.
Secondly, we propose to
establish a Stanford Flea Market
that would enable students to sell
various goods to one another at
low prices. Thirdly, we support
NorCal PIRG's (Public Interest
Research Group) effort to provide
students with valuable
information on consumer issues
while engaging them in
meaningful research. Jack Handy
has been Chairman of NorCal
PIRG and will work to develop
the program to its full potential at
Stanford.
We have been attacked for
representing "special interests"
because of our concern for

minority affairs. We believe,
however, that all students benefit
from a culturally, ethnically and
sexually diverse university and
that the university and its
students should be committed to
racial and sexual equality.
Goals Pursued Actively
800 Bacon as editor of the
Real News and Maria Echaveste as
co-chairwoman of MECHA have
actively pursued these goals. Both
have also been active in the ASSU
Senate, with Maria serving as
vice-chairwoman .
As ASSU Council of
Presidents, we will perform an
advocacy role in University
decision-making. We support
affirmative action in admission,
hiring, and tenure practices.
We support land use policies
reflecting the' University's
academic function and residential
character. We support investment
policies which emphasize
corporate responsibility.
