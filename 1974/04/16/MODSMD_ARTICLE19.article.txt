Support KZSU Fee
Editor:
KZSU has a fee referendum on
tomorrow's ballot asking for a $2
refundable fee assessment for next
year's operating budget. There are
two main points to be considered
in relation to the 1974 KZSU Fee
Referendum: the allocation and
use of a $20,000 annual budget
and the controversial use of the
1972 Fee Assessment.
A $20,000 budget is necessary
for KZSU to maintain its present
service and improve future service
to the Stanford Community.
Most of the budget goes
directly to recording tape,
transistors, and records which
maintain our air sound. Only
about 7 percent of the budget
pays salaries, and those are only
for jobs which maintain our
legality (Business Manager and
Log Secretary).
The largest budgets are for
news, public affairs and
educational programs which total
approximately $6000. Equipment
maintenance and general
engineering costs are about

$2500. Telephones are expensive
and run about $4000. Innovations
and other improvements to better
serve the Stanford Community
also add to our expenses. I
The 1972 Fee Assessment was
for the amount $39,500. Some
$18,000 went to our operating
expenses, which is what we're
asking for this year. It should be
noted that since 1972 we have
had inflation, fee refunds, and a 4
percent partition to the University
for collection expenses.
Another $18,000 went to
conversion to stereo, which KZSU
realized in July of 1973.
The last $3500 went to higher
power. This was all reported in
the Daily at that time and the
information was in our literature
then. The FCC requires a financial
preparedness before requesting
higher power. For this reason
alone, the fee assessment was
necessary.
But the $3500 has not been
wasted. It is now tied up in
unused equipment. If we decide
we'll never be able to use it, then
we will sell it and recycle the
money back into the budget to

improve our services to Stanford.
As such the money has not been
wasted.
The services which KZSU
provides will not be possible
without funding. The
broadcasting of John Kaplan's
popular course "The Criminal
Law and the Criminal System"
and other educational services are
only possible through an annual
budget of $20,000. Coverage of
local events on and off campus
and comprehensive news coverage
could not be continued without
annual funding.
Vote YES on the KZSU FEE
REFERENDUM in order to KEEP
KZSU ON THE AIR!

'Aliyah' Retraction
In response to the April 8
letter by Rick Mills, the Aliyah
editorial staff desires to clarify its
position:
1) Rick Mills did not consult
the entire editorial staff, and his
opinion represents that of a
minority of the staff.
2) Because there are no issues
in this election directly bearing on
the Jewish community or the

Aliyah, an endorsement from our
paper is unwarranted.

Sahel 'Edict'
Editor:
The callousness and illogic of
this red-tiled sepulchre have once
again come to the fore with the
recent University edict that the
money from dorm funds cannot
be used to help hundreds of
thousands of starving Africans in
the Sahel. The motivation of these
(too) well-fed administrators is
beyond me.
The fact of the matter is that
the University serves only as a
voluntary collecting agent for
house dues. Some dorms collect
dues by other means than through
the University.
Never to my knowledge has the
University claimed any right to
regulate the use of these dues.
Beyond that, only the most
decadent of institutions can deem
it "illegal" to help human beings
in danger of losing their lives.

I suggest that each house make
a provision to refund a certain
amount of the house money,
giving each member the choice of
having his portion go to the
African Relief Fund or to himself.
Finally a note to fellow seniors
— aside from the fact that many
of us don't especially like the idea
of commemorating four years at
Stanford by looking like a
congregation of clowns, though
that might be appropriate, I really
feel that we should have the
option of taking the money that
would otherwise go to the rental
of a useless cap and gown, and
donating it to a more worthy
cause.
A note to that effect in
the program at graduation would
make my parents at least proud of
the fact that I wasn't parading like
a musty scholastic and had
actually learned something here.
When we came here we protested
needless death in Indochina. I
can't think of any more
appropriate way to leave this
university than to protest
needless death in another part of
the third World — the Sahel.
