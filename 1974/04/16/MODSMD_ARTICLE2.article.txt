# Amsterdam Excluded From Gould's Case
## 
### DON COX 
U.S. District Court Judge Robert
Schnacke Friday excluded Law Prof.
Anthony Amsterdam from court
arguments involving the $50 million
class action suit filed by Law Prof.
William Gould against major trucking
firms and Teamsters union locals,
Gould told the Daily last night.
Amsterdam was representing Gould
in connection with a court gag order
placed on Gould March 21, restricting
Gould's communication about the
case.
"I have a constitutional right to be
represented by a lawyer of my own
choosing," Gould said.

The gag order was imposed by
Sehnacke following complaints from
the defendants' attorneys that Gould
was engaged in the unethical
solicitation of clients.
Hiring Practices
Gould has maintained he was only
trying to collect evidence for the trial
of the trucking firms and unions. They
are charged in Gould's suit, brought on
behalf of eight minority truck drivers,
as having engaged in discriminatory
hiring practices.
Amsterdam had appeared in court
Friday to argue in Gould's behalf
against the gag order.
Gould said that Schnacke noted the
court had been "too lax" in allowing
Amsterdam to argue on matters of this
kind in previous hearings and that he
would not allow Amsterdam to argue.
Move For Admittance
Gould said he then moved to have
Amsterdam admitted to the case but
Schnacke would not hear such a
motion at that time.
Amsterdam filed an application
Friday to be admitted to the case.
"These proceedings have put me on
trial and 1 have a right to have
Amsterdam represent me," Gould said
last night.
'Lonely' Fight
Gould also said that his fight
against discriminatory hiring practices
had become "a more lonely one" in
light of the settlement between the
steel industry and the Justice
Department yesterday.
Major steel companies agreed
yesterday to pay over $30 million in
back wages to 40,000 minority
workers who the Justice Department
said had been discriminated against.
G»uld said the settlement suffered
from"the inadequate amount of
money involved" and that workers
would receive "substantially less than
they were entitled to."
'Pernicious' Part
"The Nixon Administration seems
to want to get out from under
litigating these things seriously," said
Gould.
"One of the most pernicious parts
of the agreement" he said, was a clause
that forced the Justice Department to
intervene on the side of the steel
companies if a worker refuses to sign a
waiver relinquishing his right to sue in
the future.
The Justice Department, guardian
of civil rights in the past, "thus
switches to propping up an inadequate
settlement," Gould said.
"I don't believe, however, that this
administration, which is hostile to
black workers to begin with, is going
to influence independent federal
judges appointed for life.
"The federal judiciary is absolutely
first rate on employment
discrimination decisions," he said.

Amsterdam was representing Gould
in connection with a court gag order
placed on Gould March 21, restricting
Gould's communication about the
case.
"I have a constitutional right to be
represented by a lawyer of my own
choosing," Gould said.

The gag order was imposed by
Sehnacke following complaints from
the defendants' attorneys that Gould
was engaged in the unethical
solicitation of clients.
Hiring Practices
Gould has maintained he was only
trying to collect evidence for the trial
of the trucking firms and unions. They
are charged in Gould's suit, brought on
behalf of eight minority truck drivers,
as having engaged in discriminatory
hiring practices.
Amsterdam had appeared in court
Friday to argue in Gould's behalf
against the gag order.
Gould said that Schnacke noted the
court had been "too lax" in allowing
Amsterdam to argue on matters of this
kind in previous hearings and that he
would not allow Amsterdam to argue.
Move For Admittance
Gould said he then moved to have
Amsterdam admitted to the case but
Schnacke would not hear such a
motion at that time.
Amsterdam filed an application
Friday to be admitted to the case.
"These proceedings have put me on
trial and 1 have a right to have
Amsterdam represent me," Gould said
last night.
'Lonely' Fight
Gould also said that his fight
against discriminatory hiring practices
had become "a more lonely one" in
light of the settlement between the
steel industry and the Justice
Department yesterday.
Major steel companies agreed
yesterday to pay over $30 million in
back wages to 40,000 minority
workers who the Justice Department
said had been discriminated against.
G»uld said the settlement suffered
from"the inadequate amount of
money involved" and that workers
would receive "substantially less than
they were entitled to."
'Pernicious' Part
"The Nixon Administration seems
to want to get out from under
litigating these things seriously," said
Gould.
"One of the most pernicious parts
of the agreement" he said, was a clause
that forced the Justice Department to
intervene on the side of the steel
companies if a worker refuses to sign a
waiver relinquishing his right to sue in
the future.
The Justice Department, guardian
of civil rights in the past, "thus
switches to propping up an inadequate
settlement," Gould said.
"I don't believe, however, that this
administration, which is hostile to
black workers to begin with, is going
to influence independent federal
judges appointed for life.
"The federal judiciary is absolutely
first rate on employment
discrimination decisions," he said.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert
