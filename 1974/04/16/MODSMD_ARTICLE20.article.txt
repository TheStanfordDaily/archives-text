# Program Trains Hospital Directors

### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The Health Services
Administration (HSA) Program is
an interdisciplinary program that
aims to provide the student
interested in medical field
management with a more
systematic approach to delivering
health care than the bureaucratic
hospital.
A degree, which was first
offered by HSA last year,
combines the training received in
a graduate program with course
work and outside experience
gained during a summer
"practicum" under the direction
of the Medical School.
The program is directed by
Count D. Gibson, associate dean
of health programs and chairman
of the department of family,
Community and Preventative
Medicine.
There are 25 spaces available
for students in three categories:
those who have just been
admitted to a graduate program,
those in the process of completing
one here, and students who have
recently completed a graduate
program here or at other
universities.
No Medical Studies Prerequisite
Grolle said, "For the student, a
medical studies background is not

a requisite. We are looking for
people who will become the high
level administrators, planners and
managers of tomorrow's public
and private health care
organizations. The emphasis is
definitely on the individual and
his skills."
Business Prof. Jack Moore, a
supporter of the program since its
beginning, said, "Health services
represent a growing and rapidly
changing field. HSA graduates will
find themselves shaping the
technology of future health care
delivery systems as much as
managing the current ones."
"The faculty for the program
comes from all over the
University: engineering,
economics, business, medicine,
social sciences, behavioral
sciences" and other departments,
said Grolle.
Began In Business School
The program began three years
ago as a specialization in the
graduate program at the School of
Business. It was directed by
Nicholas Baloff, William
Abemathy, and John Hershey.
The formal degree program
evolved from interest generated
by the Medical School.
Last December the first degrees

were awarded. Six degrees have
been received so far, all to
graduates from the Business
School.
Grolle added, "the competition
for our graduates has been
dramatic. Some graduates are
consulting: others have found
access to high level positions in
hospitals, clinics, and the newer
Health Maintenance Organizations
[HMO]."
One HSA graduate is David
Ashby, assistant to the president
of KMB Health Systems, a health
consulting firm in Sunnyvale.
Last year's program offered
seminar classes and a summer
"praciticum" in addition to the

regular MBA requirements.
This year the program requires
45 units of HSA core courses.
These may be taken as electives
for a student's other graduate
programs. During one summer,
students will be placed in a
full-time job investigating a health
services problem in the immediate
Bay Area. They will receive a
stipend of $1850.
There is no extra tuition
charged for this program if the
student is already in a graduate
program at Stanford, Grolle said.
He said that HSA is funded with
money from research projects,
government training contracts and
University tuition.

admitted to a graduate program,
those in the process of completing
one here, and students who have
recently completed a graduate
program here or at other
universities.
No Medical Studies Prerequisite
Grolle said, "For the student, a
medical studies background is not

a requisite. We are looking for
people who will become the high
level administrators, planners and
managers of tomorrow's public
and private health care
organizations. The emphasis is
definitely on the individual and
his skills."
Business Prof. Jack Moore, a
supporter of the program since its
beginning, said, "Health services
represent a growing and rapidly
changing field. HSA graduates will
find themselves shaping the
technology of future health care
delivery systems as much as
managing the current ones."
"The faculty for the program
comes from all over the
University: engineering,
economics, business, medicine,
social sciences, behavioral
sciences" and other departments,
said Grolle.
Began In Business School
The program began three years
ago as a specialization in the
graduate program at the School of
Business. It was directed by
Nicholas Baloff, William
Abemathy, and John Hershey.
The formal degree program
evolved from interest generated
by the Medical School.
Last December the first degrees

were awarded. Six degrees have
been received so far, all to
graduates from the Business
School.
Grolle added, "the competition
for our graduates has been
dramatic. Some graduates are
consulting: others have found
access to high level positions in
hospitals, clinics, and the newer
Health Maintenance Organizations
[HMO]."
One HSA graduate is David
Ashby, assistant to the president
of KMB Health Systems, a health
consulting firm in Sunnyvale.
Last year's program offered
seminar classes and a summer
"praciticum" in addition to the

regular MBA requirements.
This year the program requires
45 units of HSA core courses.
These may be taken as electives
for a student's other graduate
programs. During one summer,
students will be placed in a
full-time job investigating a health
services problem in the immediate
Bay Area. They will receive a
stipend of $1850.
There is no extra tuition
charged for this program if the
student is already in a graduate
program at Stanford, Grolle said.
He said that HSA is funded with
money from research projects,
government training contracts and
University tuition.
The Health Services
Administration (HSA) Program is
an interdisciplinary program that
aims to provide the student
interested in medical field
management with a more
systematic approach to delivering
health care than the bureaucratic
hospital.
A degree, which was first
offered by HSA last year,
combines the training received in
a graduate program with course
work and outside experience
gained during a summer
"practicum" under the direction
of the Medical School.
The program is directed by
Count D. Gibson, associate dean
of health programs and chairman
of the department of family,
Community and Preventative
Medicine.
There are 25 spaces available
for students in three categories:
those who have just been
admitted to a graduate program,
those in the process of completing
one here, and students who have
recently completed a graduate
program here or at other
universities.
