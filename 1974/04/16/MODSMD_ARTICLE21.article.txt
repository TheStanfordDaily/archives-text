# Ehrlich: Climate Switch Caused African Famine
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The famine in west Africa is
the result of global climatic
changes caused by increases in
world population and
industrialization, Paul Ehrlich,
professor of biological sciences
told a group of 70 people
Thursday in Bishop Auditorium.
Ehrlich noted that the starving
Africans are innocent victims of a
drastic shift in the weather
conditions of thier homeland. For
six consecutive years, there have
been no monsoons, he said.
Ehrlich urged students to
contribute to the African Famine
Relief Fund, calling the crisis a
"test for the humanity of
mankind."
Ehrlich estimated that up to
1.5 million Africans may have
perished already and that 13
million more lives may be
endangered.
Civilization Endangered
Although the drastic change in
climatic conditions in Africa is
hopefully temporary, it could be
permanent thus endangering the
existence of the entire civilization
in central Africa, Ehrlich said.
It is also possible that a similar
change in climate may occur in
India and Pakistan, endangering
the lives of 500 million people,
Ehrlich warned.
If such a famine occurs, the
desperate Indians might utilize its
nuclear capability and precipitate
a world war, Ehrlich stated.
Washington Response
Although Stanford students
should respond to the African
famine in a spirit of
humanitarianism, Ehrlich
predicted that such appeals will
have little influence on officials in
Washington.
The best way to encourage the
government to respond to the
African famine is to convince it
that American interests are
threatened by famine, Ehrlich
said.
Ehrlich noted that the African
famine could cause an epidemic of

cholera that would spread
throughout the world. When and
if conditions improve, a
revolution in the African nations
affected by the drought is also
likely to occur, he stated.
Change Outlook of World
Ehrlich emphasized that the
only way to solve the world food
dilemma is to change the
economic and political outlook of
the world. Western nations can no
longer isolate themselves from the
problems of the Third World, but
must start working in cooperation
with these nations, he said.
But in the short run, relief
efforts can do much to ameliorate
immediate suffering, Ehrlich
declared.
Laurie Coplen, coorganizer of
the African Famine Relief Fund,
told students that the group
would collect money in the
dorms. She urged students to
contribute at least one dollar
each. But she warned students to
make certain that the students
collecting money were officially
authorized by the Relief Fund.
