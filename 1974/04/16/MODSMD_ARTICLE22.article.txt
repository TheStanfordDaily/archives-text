# Psychiatrist Lectures Against Psychosurgery
## 
### BILL EVERS 
SAN FRANCISCO—Dr. Peter
Breggin, the nation's leading
opponent of psychosurgery, told a
sympathetic audience at the First
Unitarian Church here last
Wednesday evening that
institutional, established
psychiatry has "lost sight of the
fact that there is a person involved
in living life."
Calling the basic conceptions
of man held by contemporary
psychiatry both " evil" and
"wrong," Breggin argued that
making all explanatory factors in
human life either environmental
or biological disregards the fact
that human beings have ideas —
"spiritiual ideas, ideological
values, aspirations for truth, for
beauty."
Breggin, who is a therapist in
the Washington, D.C. area, made
the central core of his talk
entitled "Man Against
Psychiatry" an explanation of his
finding that humans have free
will, make decisions, and make
judgments. The implication of this
finding, according to Breggin, is
that political acts and theraputic
techniques that considered
humans as objects or things are
totalitarian in nature.
At the outset, Breggin reported
on some recent political successes
which his Center for the Study of
Psychiatry and allied groups have
had in combatting what they
consider to be abuses of

psychiatry.
First of all, the government's
National Institute of Mental
Health has designated
psychosurgery (or lobotomy) as
an "experimental" technique,
rather than a proven, normal
course of action.
Halt Funding
Second, all federal funding of
psychosurgery projects has been
halted, and the Justice
Department's Law Enforcement
Assistance Agency has declared
that it will no longer support
psychosurgery and behavior
modification projects.
Finally, a panel of judges in
Michigan declared that
psychosurgery on involuntary
mental patients is
unconstitutional on the grounds
that involuntary patients cannot
give true consent. Additional legal
developments are expected in the
medical malpractice suits recently
filed in Michigan, California, and
Massachusetts against prominent
psychosurgeons.
Breggin provided his audience
with what he called a "whirlwind
history" of institutional
psychiatry in the closing part of
his formal presentation.
He touched on the
development of the physician's
power of civil commitment in the
seventeenth century as a method
of authorizing imprisonment that
got around the procedural and
evidencive requirements of the
criminal law.
