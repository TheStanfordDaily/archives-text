# Sharing The Work Of Child Care
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
Couples who share child care responsibilities between
the man and woman find that despite some unusual
problems, there are significant rewards from such an
arrangement.
Four Stanford area couples practicing this sharing
discussed with the Daily the benefits and drawbacks of
their situations.
A problem which all the couples discussed was the
conflict between spending time on both their careers and
with their children. It's impossible to do both full-time,
they agreed. They estimated that the traditional career
person spends from 60 to 100 hours per week at his job.
Full-time child care requires at least that much time, if not
more, they agreed.
Each couple took different approaches to this problem.
Stanford graduate Keith Benz decided to work less. Six
months after the birth of his son, Benz started working
three days instead of five days a week at his job as an
executive for Westinghouse Learning Corporation in
Mountain View.
'Surprised'
"I was surprised I enjoyed taking care of Jessie [his
son ] as much as I did," Benz said. However, he didn't find
all his problems solved by the change in working hours.
He said that although he didn't mind losing "some
power and some pay," he had trouble knowing what to do
with his free time.
"At first, I felt I had to accomplish things all the
time.... Men don't know what to do with themselves
when they're not working for 40 to 80 hours a week. And
it's a difficult position for them to be in. It's a disorienting
experience for a man who's been socialized to believe in
the whole money-and-success-trip to suddenly leave it
behind."
Benz said that after he stopped trying to rigidly
schedule all his time, he began to realize watching and
caring for his son or pursuing hobbies was "an
accomplishment in itself."
He said he is very pleased with the situation now.
'Accomplishing As Much'
Chris Clark, a graduate student in education, said doing
approximately one-third of the care for his five children
does not prevent him from "accomplishing as much as I
normally would."
"People have four hours a day of work in them, and
after that it's mostly wheel spinning," he said. "A person
should pursue a few good ideas thoroughly without killing
himself."
Clark said that although he spends a lot of time on his
job as coordinator of a research project at the Research
and Development Center, he "makes time" to spend with

his children.
Part of the rationale for his wife, Tryn, entering
graduate school in sociology here next fall is to "set up the
situation where I'll be forced to spend more time with the
kids," Clark explained.
Increasing Role
Clark added that although he was extremely positive
about his increasing role in caring for his children, he
thought his freedom was being curtailed on occasions.
He said when Tryn tells him on short notice hell have
to watch the kids, sometimes he thinks, "Drat. I might go
back to the office tonight and work on writing a paper.
"But," he added, "I get over that quickly."
Tryn Clark said one positive effect of child care
arrangements like hers is that it frees time for mothers.
She said people are becoming more aware that it shouldn't
be the exclusive responsibility of women to care for
children, especially when it conflicts with pursuing their
own careers and interests.
She pointed out that having her husband care for their
children was only one possible way to handle child care.
Many people hire babysitters or use day care centers.
The Clarks use babysitters and day care centers
sometimes. However, they said they felt very strongly that
hiring someone to do most of the child care was not the
best answer to "some very essential questions about child
care."
Chris Clark explained "You have to look at growth in
the family unit, the whole complex of relations of mother
to father, parent to child." Besides, he added, sharing child
care benefits not only the children, but the parents as well.
Tryn Clark explained, "You have to learn patience,
how to be supportive and to develop sensitivity for people
when you handle children or you simply won't succeed
with them.
"We [she and her husband] appreciate each other
more. When we watch each other with the kids, we see
aspects of each others' personalities that don't always
come out when we're relating just to each other."
Jobs Equal
Penni Mann, another parent who shares child care,
voiced this same opinion about positive effects upon
children. She and her husband, David, share both child
care and their job as campus representatives of the United
Campus Christian Ministry "completely equally."
If more parents shared child care equally, it could have
a very healthy effect on their children, Mann asserted.
Most children see their fathers only a few hours each
night and on weekends because fathers work the rest of
the time, she said. Yet so much of traditional

psychotherapy is oriented toward "mother hang-ups," she
added. If kids saw as much of their fathers as they do of
their mothers, this might not be the case, she claimed.
Few Others
All these couples said they did not know very many
others with arrangements like their own. Yet according to
all these couples, their friends and acquaintances had
reacted very positively to their arrangements. People are
mostly envious, they said.
Chris Clark claimed tnat the main reason why more
men don't play a larger role in child care is not the conflict
with thei v careers.
"I think it's something deeper than that," he said.
"Men don't like to admit they need the kind of help one
gets from getting to know their families, but they do.
"Suggesting to a father he should spend more time with
his children can be threatening and even insulting. It's like
someone telling you you don't really know your own kids.
But that assessment is largely correct," he said.
Asst. Psychology Prof. Lee Ross said that the main
pressure for changes to facilitate child care sharing must
come from individual people, not from institutions like
the University.
Ross said although he spends no more time than the
"average father" does with his children, he'd like to spend
more, but his academic commitments prevent him.
But, he added, it is not clear the University should
accommodate itself by making part- or half-time faculty
appointments to facilitate equal child care sharing.
"It would not be clearly to the advantage of the
University," he said. "Stanford has no problem in hiring
faculty with no such conflicts. Such changes would be for
human and not academic means."
Benz said he didn't think many institutions would
strongly resist men's requests for fewer working hours, if
men would ask.
"I think it's nuts to say they have to do the whole
career thing, play by all the rules," he said. "If people
would just ask, if a lot of men would say, 'Hey, we want
less hours of work,' then companies would have to give
in," he asserted.
Susan Swaringen, the Escondido Village representative
of the Dean of Students Affairs office, said that before the
University could take an active role in facilitating child
care sharing, it would have to know how many children
live in Escondido, their ages, and other informaion.
She said her office will try to obtain such information
in the future so it can establish an accurate assessment of
the need for day care centers, babysitting co-ops and
emergency aid for parents caring for more than one child.
