# Jose Limon Dancers Show Exuberance, Versatility
## 
### JANICE ROSS 
Jose Limon died little more
than one year ago, yet the power
and beauty of his artistic genius
lives on. Limon once remarked
that "Death is not mortality, not
when you leave some great part of
your spirit and essence to your
fellow man...
The two performances by the
Jose Limon Dance Company last
Thursday and Friday nights in
Memorial Auditorium were joyous
affirmation that Limon's spirit
and essence are still with us.
Limon's untimely death left his
dancers in a difficult quandry.
They had to decide whether to
disband and relocate themselves in
new dance companies, or to
continue as the Jose Limon

Company without the leadership
of Limon.
The problem was solved when
Ruth Currier, a longtime associate
of both Limon and Doris
Humphrey, emerged soon after
Limon's death to become the
company's new artistic director.
Under Currier's aegis, several new
dancers were added, much of
Limon's pre-existing
choreography was revised and
shortened, and for the first time
the company began performing
works of other choreographers.
Great Promise
Perhaps as a result of these
changes the 'new' sixteen-member
Limon Company today shows
great promise. At last weekend's
performance the dancers

demonstrated that they are
well-trained technically, versatile,
and contagiously exuberant.
Earlier in the week, at a
community lecture-demonstra
tion, Ruth Currier had remarked
on Limon's humanism as well as
his tremendous sense of pride and
dignity. These qualities were
especially evident in La Malinche
(1949) and The Moor's Pavane
(1949), both performed at
Thursday night's concert.
La Malinche and The Moor's
Pavane are the best of Limon's
early works, and as such they are
interesting in both an historical
and an artistic sense. They are
both very literal and dramatic
dances that treat the emotional
disruption of a relationship. In
one, La Malinche, the subject
matter is taken from Linon's
Mexican background, and in the
other, The Moor's Pavane,
Shakespeare's play Othello was
the source.
Despite the differences in story
line, both dances employ similar
dramatic devices in order to make
their respective statements on the
human condition. In both dances
an economy of characters and
gestures is used; only the main
actions between the key symbolic
figures are shown.
Environment
These dances are unusual in
that once the characters enter
they do not leave the stage until
the dance is over. Instead, each
part of the stage becomes a
dramatic environment. Limon
shows us everything from
Desdemona's boudoir to a fiesta
in a Mexican village without the
aid of additional dancers or props.
Neither work is presented as a
straight forward dance; instead
they use the clever device of
nesting a dance within a dance.
All the action in The Moor's

Pavane occurs within the structure
of the dignified and solemn court
dance, the Pavane.
Within this structure the two
couples execute majestic
movements, interrupting them
briefly with emotional gestures as
the deception, anger and finally
murder are revealed. Purcell's
music arranged by Simon Sadoff
alternated between being stately
and controlled, discordant and
emotional, highlighting the
changing passions of the dancers.
At Thursday's performance
Clay Taliaferro danced the part of
the Moor, a role that had become
a Limon trademark. In spite of an
uncanny resemblance to Limon,
both in features and gestures,
Taliaferro managed to include
personal qualities that made his
portrayal memorable.
Universal Themes
In La Malinche, like in The
Moor's Pavane, Limon is
presenting more than just a visual
spectacle or a narrative movement
study. His themes are so universal
and his dramatic devices so
powerful that what we see are
actually poignant reflections of
the human drama.
The dancers in La Malinche
walk onstage and enact a dance
within the dance, a drama of
conquest and rebellion. As
dancers within the dance, they
take bows, returning immediately
for final bows as performers of
the universal dance.
This interesting structure
makes us see the performers as if
they were a group of passing
carnival dancers entertaining the
crowd at a Mexican fiesta. Their
movements, however, have a
certain conviction and vitality
that raises them above the ethnic
vernacular.
The concluding dance on
Thursday night's program was

There Is A Time (1956), another
Limon classic. The dance is based
on a cyclical pattern, outlined in a
well-known scriptural passage
from Ecclesiastes.
Amazing Vigor
Although the dance seemed
overly long, the company
maintained an amazing vigor and
energy throughout. Among the
sections that were especially
noteworthy was 'A Time To
Dance,' which was jubilant and
vivacious; and 'A Time To Keep
Silent and A Time To Speak,'
which was beautifully danced by
Ann Vachon and Ryland Jordan.

jazz and bird sounds.
The curtain rose on an empty
stage, with a brilliant sky blue
scrim. Suddenly drove after drove
of flesh-colored dancers appeared
and they hovered about the stage
beating their cloth wings.
It might have been a cliche, but
it wasn't. The movements were
powerful and expressive, and they
were consistent with the bird
theme. Limon's dancers were not
pretending to do bird-like
gestures, they actually became the
soaring, winged creatures.
Unfortunately The Winged was

Jordan was especially good in the
thigh-slapping, floor-stomping
sequence where he maintained an
easy grace without missing the
slapping punctuations.
The costumes for There Is A
Time, as well as for many of
Limon's other dances, were
designed by Pauline Lawrence,
Limon's widow, and they were
remarkable for their effectiveness
and simplicity.
Friday evening's performance
afforded the audience a look at
two of Limon's more recent
pieces, The Winged (1966) and A
Choreographic Offering (1964).
Unusual Music
The Winged represented
Limon's first attempt to
choreograph in a style outside of
the Humphrey idiom of dramatic
plot development. The music too
was unusual; rather than using
music that was closely correlated
with the movements, Limon used
a tape collage of bits of electronic.

too long. Had the last four
sections been omitted, or
condensed, the work would have
been much tighter and more
powerful. As it was, one kept
wondering what more Limon
could say about birds.
Limon's Tribute
A Choreographic Offering
(1964) was created by Limon as a
tribute to Doris Humphrey, and
many of the movements in it are
variations from her most famous
dances.
A Choreographic Offering is
like The Winged in that it is
primarily a dance about
movement. Throughout both
dances there is an underlying
pulse and flow, that unifies even
the most lengthy segments.
In A Choreographic Offering,
the momentum of the movement
never stops; whether they are
moving through space or
suspended in mid-movement,
there is a pervasive sense of breath

and energy. This quality is most
impressive when groups of dancers
repeat the same sequence, each
only a fraction of a second later
than the previous group. The
effect is like a delicate breeze
blowing across the stage.
'Lorca'
Homage To Frederico Garcia
Lorca (1974), choreographed by
Anna Sokolow, was the only work
presented by Limon's Company in
their Stanford residence that was
not choreographed by Limon.
Homage To Frederico Garcia
Lorca like A Choreographic
Offering was choreographed as a
tribute to a deceased artist. The
dance was divided into three
sections; baile (dance), duelo
(pain) and son (sound). Duelo, a
solo section danced by Clay
Taliaferro, was a powerful study
of pain and anguish. The other
two sections, baile and son, were a
delightful mixture of steps from
both the Mexican and modern
dance vocabularies, combined to
give a sense of unity, and
spontaneity.
The music by Sylvestre
Revueltas was an interesting
melange of rhythms that perfectly
complemented the dancer's
changing moods. In Homage To
Frederico Garcia Lorca, the
company demonstrated a
remarkable versatility and acute
sense of rhythm; rather than
looking superficial and cute, they
captured the essence and spirit of
the piece.
The one drawback to both
evening's performances, was the
excessive length of some of the
dances. Apparently Currier didn't
manage to cut enough from some
of Limon's dances. Perhaps Clive
Barns summed it up best when he
remarked recently that Limon
knew that there was a time for
everything except a time to stop.
