# Getz' Professionalism Highlights Jazz Set
## 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO — Jazz fans were in for a rare treat when
saxophonist Stan Getz appeared at Keystone Korner last week, April
9-14.
Getz has long been one of the leading tenor saxophonists of jazz,
since the late 40s when he was featured in the bands of Stan Kenton,
Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, and others.
Since 1951, Getz has been heading his own small group, and in
1962 recorded Jazz Samba with guitarist Charlie Byrd, thus giving
American audiences their first exposure to bossa nova.
Getz' style is largely derived from the late Lester "Prez" Young,
with its soft, alto-ish tone and extended phrases — he is probably the
best living example of the Young sax school.
On Thursday, April 11, Getz' quartet opened both sets with
uptempo bebop tunes, like "Summer Night" and Miles Davis' "Tune
Up."
The quartet included pianist Albert Daily, bassist Chin Suzuki, and
drummer Lamar Barker.
Getz gave the full-house audience a preview of his upcoming
Columbia LP with a very sympathetic rendering of Billy Strayhorn's
"Lush Life" and three Chick Corea compositions, "Day Waves,"
"Times Lie," and an exciting, flamenco-type number entitled "La
Fiesta."
"Times Lie" featured solos by everyone, with a short, tight drum
solo by Barker, and a nicely repetitious offering from Suzuki.
Getz' Latin successes were recalled with "Wave," as were his earlier
ballad hits with "Here's That Rainy Day."
A tune new to the Getz repertoire was " Sweet Dulcinea," a waltz
written by Kenny Wheeler.
The two things most evident in seeing Getz perform at Keystone
were his consistency and his professionalism. Beginning his first song
of the evening by hitting a completely inaudible note because he'd
forgotten to remove his towel from the bell of his horn, Getz then
proceeded to fulfill the audience's high expectations with some of the
best blowing jazzdom has to offer.
This week Keystone Korner, 750 Vallejo, will present trumpeter
Miles Davis, followed next week by pianist Horace Silver.
