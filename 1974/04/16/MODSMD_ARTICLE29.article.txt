						Perfect Day At Lagunita
## 
### 
The 1974 Aqua-Follies drew hundreds of fans to
Lake Lagunita Sunday, and several soggy hours
later, the following teams had conquered sunburn
and powerboat wakes and emerged victorious:
Canoe racing and greased watermelon race, Phi
Psi; tug-o-war, Kappa Sig over Kairos in the finals;
log rolling, Steve Jenkins over Rick Founan, both
of Jordan.
An 18 way tie developed in the canoe jousting
event, between Alpha Sig, Adelfa, ATO, Burbank,
Donner, El Toro, Faisan, Junipero, Kairos, Lambda
Nu, Larkin, Madera, Manzanita, Phi Psi, Rinconada
'73, Terra, Toyon, and Trancos.
