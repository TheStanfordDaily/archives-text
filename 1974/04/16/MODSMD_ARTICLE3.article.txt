# Wine, Beer By Fall?
## Pub Awaits Licensing 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
A pub serving beer and wine "will
probably" open in place of the Encina
Snack Bar Sept. 15, Tresidder Union
Manager Gordon Starr announced at a
press conference Friday.
The University has reached a
"verbal agreement" on a contract with
Guckenheimer, the holding company
for the Tresidder food service [TDS
Inc.], Starr said. Under the agreement,

TDS will operate and manage the pub.
Starr said the new public house
which would be the second of its kind
in California, will provide "a place for
students to blow off steam, a place
where people can dance. There will
probably be entertainment regularly
on weekends."
The pub—already known by many
as "Little Leland's"—will sell hot food
in addition to beer and wine, he
added.
architect
Starr said plans to choose an
architect and to apply for a liquor
license are set for this week.
He added, "The only roadblock in
the whole thing is the ABC I Dept. of
Alcoholic Beverage Control]," which
must approve the liquor license.
According to Dr. Stewart Ritchie,
president of Guckenheimer, his
company or the University will apply
for an "on sale, beer and wine license"
allowing the pub to sell beer and wine
to persons 21 or over.
45 Days
Once the application is submitted, a
45-day waiting period follows.
During this period a "notice of
intent" to sell beer and wine must be
posted for 30 days. If anyone objects,
he can demand a hearing.
The Faculty Club, which has a
liquor license allowing sale of hard
liquor, spent one and a half years
getting approval from the ABC,
according to Francis Small, the lawyer
for the club in its fight for a license.
Significant Delay
"Unless the attitude of ABC has
changed, the new pub can anticipate a
significant delay," he said, "a delay

that could stop the pub from opening
in September."
The Board of Trustees or President
Richard Lyman will have to decide if
the pub should be allowed to sell beer
for take-out, according to Gerald
Halligan, University legal council. The
selling of wine for take-out is
prohibited by law.
Because the University charter states
that no liquor store shall be operated
within a one-mile radius of the
campus, the selling of packaged liquor
for take-out will probably be
forbidden, Ritchie said.
The ABC could add some
restrictions of its own, according to
ASSU Vice President Jim Friend.
Friend first proposed the pub and
worked last summer on a 75-page
"feasibility study" of the project with
Tom Gidwitz.
'The only precedent we have to
follow is the USF [University of San
Francisco] pub," Friend said.
Currently, USF's pub is monitored
by a full-time checker. Customers
must provide two forms of
identification one with a picture
which are studied under ultraviolet
light for alterations. Also.no liquor
may be taken from the premises.
Not State Law
Starr emphasized that none of these
restrictions on operations are state law
or exist in USF's charter. Instead, the
restrictions were added by the ABC
when USF applied for its license.
The Stanford Board of Trustees has
"implicitly" approved the pub by not
voicing any dissension, according to
Starr.
"The board hasn't voted on it, and
will never vote on it,"he said.
Financial Arrangements
Starr suggested that the board
approves of the pub because it will be
a profit-making organization.
Although the financial arrangements
affect both the University and TDS,
Starr said, "With the sales of beer and

wine, we are confident that it will be
profitable [for the University]."
He said that the pub could help
remove the Tresidder debt [about
$90,000] next year.
Starr estimated that $30,000 from
operating revenue would be available
as student wages. In addition, a
"career manager" will be hired,
according to Starr.
Political Innuendos
"Little Leland's" may not be the
name the pub is finally given because
some University officials, faculty and
alumni are against it, he added.
"Little Leland's' has all sorts of
political innuendos. If we were ever
officially to call it 'Little Leland's
Pub', we'd probably not have one,"
Starr maintained. •
Dan Williams, Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs, said, "Any person
who has some sense of the heritage of
the University may feel that the name
would be an act of irreverence toward
the University."
Sufficiently Respectful
Friend said, "They [the University
faculty and administrators] do not
think the name is sufficiently
respectful of the University founder."
However, Friend feels that the
name is appropriate, and plans to push
for its use.
Although much of the pub's
physical design is still incomplete, two
rooms—one serving food, and the
other serving beer and wine— are
definitely planned, according to
Friend.

Friend admitted that separating
drinkers from non-drinkers could
create "big social problems."
However, Friend said there are only
two "less-acceptable"alternatives— not
selling beer and wine in the pub or not
allowing in anyone under 21.
