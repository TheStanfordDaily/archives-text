# Wine, Beer By Fall?
## Pub Awaits Licensing 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
A pub serving beer and wine "will
probably" open in place of the Encina
Snack Bar Sept. 15, Tresidder Union
Manager Gordon Starr announced at a
press conference Friday.
The University has reached a
"verbal agreement" on a contract with
Guckenheimer, the holding company
for the Tresidder food service [TDS
Inc.], Starr said. Under the agreement,

TDS will operate and manage the pub.
Starr said the new public house
which would be the second of its kind
in California, will provide "a place for
students to blow off steam, a place
where people can dance. There will
probably be entertainment regularly
on weekends."
The pub—already known by many
as "Little Leland's"—will sell hot food
in addition to beer and wine, he
added.

Starr said plans to choose an
architect and to apply for a liquor
license are set for this week.
He added, "The only roadblock in
the whole thing is the ABC I Dept. of
Alcoholic Beverage Control]," which
must approve the liquor license.
According to Dr. Stewart Ritchie,
president of Guckenheimer, his
company or the University will apply
for an "on sale, beer and wine license"
allowing the pub to sell beer and wine
to persons 21 or over.
45 Days
Once the application is submitted, a
45-day waiting period follows.
During this period a "notice of
intent" to sell beer and wine must be
posted for 30 days. If anyone objects,
he can demand a hearing.
The Faculty Club, which has a
liquor license allowing sale of hard
liquor, spent one and a half years
getting approval from the ABC,
according to Francis Small, the lawyer
for the club in its fight for a license.
Significant Delay
"Unless the attitude of ABC has
changed, the new pub can anticipate a
significant delay," he said, "a delay

that could stop the pub from opening
in September."
The Board of Trustees or President
Richard Lyman will have to decide if
the pub should be allowed to sell beer
for take-out, according to Gerald
Halligan, University legal council. The
selling of wine for take-out is
prohibited by law.
Because the University charter states
that no liquor store shall be operated
