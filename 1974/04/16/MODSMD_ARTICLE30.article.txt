# JV Cards Take Two From USF
## 
### 
Well, the scenario changed for
the Stanford junior varsity
baseball team but the result
didn't, Saturday, minus varsity
headman Ray Young who was
directing his charges against
UCLA in Los Angeles, the JV's
swept a doubleheader from the
University of San Francisco JV's
7-6 and 7-2.
The first win was a
come-from-behind effort with the
Cards scoring the winning run in
the top of the seventh inning,
when Gary Malkasian singled in
the winning run. Stanford held a
comfortable 6-0 lead over the
Dons until the bottom of the fifth
inning as Jim Scharffenberger
stifled USF, allowing them just
three hits.
The Dons managed to score
four runs on two hits and a walk,
as Scharffenberger gave way to
reliever Erik Osenbaugh.
Osenbaugh got the last out in the
inning but allowed two more runs
on a couple of errors, to knot the
score at 6-aJI.
But now it was time for
Malkasian's heroics. Malkasian
singled in the winning run after
the Dons had put it aboard on a
walk. The RBI was Malkasian's
fifth of the game and wrapped up
a fine two-for-three and five RBI
performance. Card centerfielder
Ray Anderson also had a fine first
game going two for three.
Jerry Argust allowed USF just
three hits in the nightcap, as the
Cards errupted for three runs in
the fifth and seventh innings to
defeat the Dons 7-2.
Malkasian came up with the big
bat again, to lead a three run
eruption by Stanford. The inning
also featured the fine defensive
play of Steve Abels and Tom
Cook, who shared three assists
between them.
With a 4-2 cushion Argust
frustrated the Dons, allowing
them no more hits, and his
teammates got him three more
runs in the final inning to give the
Cards a 7-2 win.
Stanford is now 13-8 overall
and they carry a 9-4 Bay Area
Collegiate league record into
tomorrow's game against Santa
Qara University on the Santa
Clara campus at 2:30 p.m.

when Gary Malkasian singled in
the winning run. Stanford held a
comfortable 6-0 lead over the
Dons until the bottom of the fifth
inning as Jim Scharffenberger
stifled USF, allowing them just
three hits.
The Dons managed to score
four runs on two hits and a walk,
as Scharffenberger gave way to
reliever Erik Osenbaugh.
Osenbaugh got the last out in the
inning but allowed two more runs
on a couple of errors, to knot the
score at 6-aJI.
But now it was time for
Malkasian's heroics. Malkasian
singled in the winning run after
the Dons had put it aboard on a
walk. The RBI was Malkasian's
fifth of the game and wrapped up
a fine two-for-three and five RBI
performance. Card centerfielder
Ray Anderson also had a fine first
game going two for three.
Jerry Argust allowed USF just
three hits in the nightcap, as the
Cards errupted for three runs in
the fifth and seventh innings to
defeat the Dons 7-2.
Malkasian came up with the big
bat again, to lead a three run
eruption by Stanford. The inning
also featured the fine defensive
play of Steve Abels and Tom
Cook, who shared three assists
between them.
With a 4-2 cushion Argust
frustrated the Dons, allowing
them no more hits, and his
teammates got him three more
runs in the final inning to give the
Cards a 7-2 win.
Stanford is now 13-8 overall
and they carry a 9-4 Bay Area
Collegiate league record into
tomorrow's game against Santa
Qara University on the Santa
Clara campus at 2:30 p.m.
