# Question Marks Come Through
## Netters Trounce SMU, 8-1 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Saturday, the question marks
in Coach Dick Gould's tennis
lineup became the exclamation
points.
But the object of everyone's
attention was subjected to a
strange inversion.
To translate: John Whitlinger,
at third singles, and Mark
Mitchell, at sixth, proved they
could handle those slots as
Stanford beat Southern Methodist
8-1 before a large but quiet crowd
at the Varsity Courts Saturday.
But Sandy Mayer, playing in
his first home match of the year,
blew a triple-match point and
became the day's sole casualty,
falling to the Mustangs'
highly-regarded George Hardie,
1-6,7-5, 6-1.
Whitlinger, whose presence on
the court was, as usual, easily
detected by his squeaking shoes,
simply blew Joe Edles, a former
Junior Davis Cupper, off the
court. With some incredible

ground stokes, Whit won his first
10 games en route to a 6-0, 6-2
victory.
Mitchell, playing his first really
big match, broke Richard Walthall
four straight times and was never
in trouble, winning 6-2, 6-3.
Mitchell took full advantage of his
opponent's weak backhand en
route to the triumph.
Saviano Wins
Lefty Nick Saviano, playing
fifth singles for the first time in a
big match, also played well. After
a nondescript start, Saviano easily
won a tiebreaker and devestated
his opponent Dave Bohrnstadt
from then on, winning 7-6, 6-2.
Another victory came from
second singles player Jim Delaney,
who got off to his usual fast start
against highly-regarded Tim Vann,
loping over and then smashing
groundstrokes and volleys for
winners. He then overcame a
second-set letdown and won 6-3,
7-5.
At fourth singles, Pat DuPre

didn't exactly play great tennis
but still pulled out 6-4, 4-6, 6-3
win over Adi Kourim.
Strange Turnaround
AJI five of these matches were
over when all eyes turned to the
Mayer-Hardie match. Hardie had
beaten UCLA's Brian Teacher two
days before, but against Mayer in
the first set, he couldn't get a shot
in the court, and Sandy won 6-1
as the SMU star muttered to
himself.
For example, after missing a
shot on the side facing the stands,
he yelled out, "where's the ball in
all you people?"
He must have found it. In the
second set Mayer led 5-4 and had
triple match-point on his serve. He
lost all three points, and
collapsed, losing eight straight
games and the match.
Gould commented, "neither
player played well. Maybe Hardie
lulled Sandy to sleep." Both
players did hit one perfect
placement, kaplunking a linesman
whose performance won best
supporting actor mention.
Doubles Wins
In doubles competition,
Stanford again dominated SMU,
fourth-place team in the NCAA's
last year. Particularly impressive
was the job done by
Whitlinger-DuPre, beating one of
the nation's best doubles teams,
Hardie-Vann, 6-3, 7-6.
At second doubles,
S a vi a no - M i t c h e 11 beat
Edles-Kourim 2-6, 6-3, 7-6. At the
final slot, Paul Sidone-Gene Mayer
proved they could play under
pressure with a 7-6, 7-6 win over
Bohrnstedt-Walthall.

and indoor matches Friday against
USC and Saturday against UCLA.
Today, Stanford hosts San Jose

against highly-regarded Tim Vann,
loping over and then smashing
groundstrokes and volleys for
winners. He then overcame a
second-set letdown and won 6-3,
7-5.
At fourth singles, Pat DuPre

didn't exactly play great tennis
but still pulled out 6-4, 4-6, 6-3
win over Adi Kourim.
Strange Turnaround
AJI five of these matches were
over when all eyes turned to the
Mayer-Hardie match. Hardie had
beaten UCLA's Brian Teacher two
days before, but against Mayer in
the first set, he couldn't get a shot
in the court, and Sandy won 6-1
as the SMU star muttered to
himself.
For example, after missing a
shot on the side facing the stands,
he yelled out, "where's the ball in
all you people?"
He must have found it. In the
second set Mayer led 5-4 and had
triple match-point on his serve. He
lost all three points, and
collapsed, losing eight straight
games and the match.
Gould commented, "neither
player played well. Maybe Hardie
lulled Sandy to sleep." Both
players did hit one perfect
placement, kaplunking a linesman
whose performance won best
supporting actor mention.
Doubles Wins
In doubles competition,
Stanford again dominated SMU,
fourth-place team in the NCAA's
last year. Particularly impressive
was the job done by
Whitlinger-DuPre, beating one of
the nation's best doubles teams,
Hardie-Vann, 6-3, 7-6.
At second doubles,
S a vi a no - M i t c h e 11 beat
Edles-Kourim 2-6, 6-3, 7-6. At the
final slot, Paul Sidone-Gene Mayer
proved they could play under
pressure with a 7-6, 7-6 win over
Bohrnstedt-Walthall.

Tennis Talk: As a result of the
SMU match wins, Gould will play
the UCLA and USC matches with
the same singles lineup, and use
the doubles teams of
Mayer-Delaney, Whitlinger-DuPre
and Saviano-Mitchell. Tickets are
still available for both the outdoor
and indoor matches Friday against
USC and Saturday against UCLA.
Today, Stanford hosts San Jose
State at 2:30. Gould, plans to start
with his seventh player (as yet
undecided) in singles, with the
option of playing his top six in
doubles if they are needed to win
the match.
Saturday, the question marks
in Coach Dick Gould's tennis
lineup became the exclamation
points.
But the object of everyone's
attention was subjected to a
strange inversion.
To translate: John Whitlinger,
at third singles, and Mark
Mitchell, at sixth, proved they
could handle those slots as
Stanford beat Southern Methodist
8-1 before a large but quiet crowd
at the Varsity Courts Saturday.
But Sandy Mayer, playing in
his first home match of the year,
blew a triple-match point and
became the day's sole casualty,
falling to the Mustangs'
highly-regarded George Hardie,
1-6,7-5, 6-1.
Whitlinger, whose presence on
the court was, as usual, easily
detected by his squeaking shoes,
simply blew Joe Edles, a former
Junior Davis Cupper, off the
court. With some incredible

ground stokes, Whit won his first
10 games en route to a 6-0, 6-2
victory.
Mitchell, playing his first really
big match, broke Richard Walthall
four straight times and was never
in trouble, winning 6-2, 6-3.
Mitchell took full advantage of his
opponent's weak backhand en
route to the triumph.
Saviano Wins
Lefty Nick Saviano, playing
fifth singles for the first time in a
big match, also played well. After
a nondescript start, Saviano easily
won a tiebreaker and devestated
his opponent Dave Bohrnstadt
from then on, winning 7-6, 6-2.
Another victory came from
second singles player Jim Delaney,
who got off to his usual fast start
against highly-regarded Tim Vann,
loping over and then smashing
groundstrokes and volleys for
winners. He then overcame a
second-set letdown and won 6-3,
7-5.
