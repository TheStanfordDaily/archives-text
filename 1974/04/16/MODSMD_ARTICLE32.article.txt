# Unpredictable Play Marks Western Golf Tournament
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
SANTA CRUZ - On the
surface at least, Dave Baskins'
performance at the Western
Intercollegiate Golf
Championships was up to his
characteristically steady
standards. He shot 72-73-74,
nothing earthshaking but good
enough for a third place tie in the
mammouth 150-man field.
Most observers who watched
Baskins trek up to the 18th green
each day figured the stoic junior
had shot his near-par score with
something like 17 pars and one
bogey. He probably missed only a
couple of greens and never strayed
from the fairways. The picture of
textbook golf.
However, a handful of
Stanford followers who actually
ventured out to the trenches of
Pasatiempo Golf Course's tricky
layout discovered differently.
Friday, they say Dave blast a
driver into the wind on the par
three third hole and curl in a
10-foot putt for a birdie. They saw
him birdie the first hole with a
magnificent approach shot and
save par on the fourth with a
miraculous chip.
But they also saw him struggle
to a double bogey on the sixth
hole and hit a horrid drive out of
bounds on 11. Baskins could only
shake his head and wonder why
he ever took up golf.
Fifth Place Finish
Thanks to the inconsistency
which kept Baskins from
overtaking the leaders and similar
troubles that befell his teammates,
Stanford's Pasatiempo
performance typified the past
three years of Cardinal golf.
Stanford occasionally threatened,
but eventually finished fifth in the
25-team field, six shots behind
Arizona State.
And each of the Cardinal
players could remember at least
six wasted shots of their own.
George Pettinger, for instance,
kept his gallery on its toes with a
performance that rivaled Baskins'
for alternating cheers and groans.
During Thursday's second
round he triple-bogied the third
hole and double-bogied the 12th.
Of course those disasters were
offset by four birdies and
Pettinger managed to shoot a
respectable 75. Friday he shot 76,
spiced by another handful of
birdies and another series of
minor disasters. Added to his

opening round 72, Pettinger's
finishing 75-76 earned him a tie
for 16th at 223.
Wild Scrambling
Not to be outdone, freshmen
Glenn Goethels and Brent Murray
furnished some wild scrambling of
their own. Goethels strayed into
the creeks and trees often enough
on he first six holes during
Wednesday's opening round to
accumulate an astronomical
eight-over-par total. He recovered
in time to shoot 79 for the round,
and his ensuing scores of 72-75
brought a respectable 226 total.
Murray, meanwhile, soared to
an 82 on Wednesday, suffering
three double bogies on a
disastrous back nine. Unphased,
he returned to the course the next
day and chopped 12 strokes off
that total with a magnificent
one-undf-r-par 70. On Friday he
fired a pedestrian 76 for 228.
Those four scores added up to

a hard-earned 896 total, one shot
behind San Jose State and Long
Beach State, four behind Brigham
Young and six back of the Sun
Devils.
In the individual competition,
Oregon's Peter Jacobsen survived
a final round 78 for a victorious
one-over-par 214 total. Jacobsen,
a smooth-swinging sophomore
who fires 67-69 in the opening
rounds, finished four shots ahead
of Oregon State's Dave Molitor
(218) and five ahead of Baskins
and five others at 219.
Stanford's non-counting scores
were Aly Trompas
(80-75-75—230) and Conrad
Nilmeier (78-76-79-233). Setting
the stage perfectly for the Cards'
schizophrenic performance,
Trompas reached the par five first
hole with two perfect shots on
opening day. He proceeded to
four-putt for a bogey.
