# Mysterious Cards Clobber USF After Dropping Three At UCLA
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
"It's a tough club to figure out.
They play when they want to. It
was very disappointing all the way
around. We didn't play good
baseball."
Those were the observations of
Stanford head coach Ray Young
about the Cards, who dropped
three games to UCLA over the
weekend. Stanford lost 8-3
Friday, then dropped both ends
of a doubleheader, 6-0 and 11-8,
Saturday at Sawtelle Field on the
UCLA campus.
Yesterday the Cards returned
to friendlier surroundings, Sunken
Diamond, to play University of
San Francisco in a non-conference
game.
Stanford trounced the Dons
15-1 to bring the Card record to
13-19 for the year.
When the Cards traveled to Los
Angeles there were hopes of
taking over the top spot in the
Pacific Eight Southern Division.
The Cards went into the series
with a 2-1 mark but came home

with a 2-4 record, tied with Cal
for last place. Stanford meets Cal
in a three-game series this
weekend.
"The ball goes out so fast in
that park," said Young. Of course,
Young emphasized the fact that
his hitters and he opportunity to
hit home runs, too. "But we
didn't challenge their pitchers.
Every game has been a struggle,
we just haven't beaten anybody
badly this year."
In all 13 home runs were
recorded by both sides — UCLA
had eight and Stanford five — in
the "phone booth," as John
Wright, team statistician,
described it, which measures 370
feet to dead center and angles
sharply to 345 in the power
alleys. In contrast, Sunken
Diamond's dimensions are more
spacious — 400 to dead center and
375 in the power alleys. "You
never knew what was going to
happen, all of a sudden a fly ball
was a home run," said Young.
UCLA 8, Cards 3
Despite two home runs by
Mark Lucich and one
round-tripper by Kevin Sullivan,
the Card pitchers couldn't limit
the Bruins, who scored five runs
in the last four innings.
Lucich and Sullivan each
connected in the second inning.
Then Lucich parked one in the
fifth.
Card starting pitcher Dave
Frost, troubled by muscle spasms
in his back, began strongly retiring
the first nine batters he faced.
However, in the fifth UCLA
tallied twice on a single by
Marshall Edwards and then added
three more in the sixth on four
consecutive singles and a two-run
double by Venoy Garrison.
Winning pitcher Steve Bianchi
(9-1) got stronger in the late going
as he allowed only one Card to
reach second base other than the
three home runs.
UCLA 6. Cards 0
Card pitching was in hot water
from the outset as the Bruins
loaded the bases in the first
inning. But, a line drive to pitcher

Bernie Hittner initiated a double
play to end the inning with UCLA
scoring just one run.
In the third inning disaster
struck as the Bruins hit three
consecutive home runs. They were
by Mike Edwards, Mark Swedlow
and Tim Doerr. Then in the
fourth inning Dave Colton
knocked Hittner out of the box
with a two-run homer to put
UCLA In front 6-0, the final
score.
Mike Williamson pitched three
masterful innings in relief retiring
nine straight batters.
UCLA's Brad Ross struck out
eight batters in pitching up the
win. He allowed just three singles
to Steve Davis, Dave Baker and
Sullivan.
UCLA 11, Cards 8
Just when the bats seemed to
get hot for Stanford the pitching
got worse as UCLA's Mike
Edwards, the Pac-B's top hitter
last year, hit three consecutive
home runs and collected seven
runs batted in. He was four for
five for the day.
Edwards' feat caused Card
assistant coach Mark Marquess to
say that "it's tough to hit three
home runs even if they were off a
string."
Stanford jumped out in front
on Baker's solo home run but fell

behind a 6-1. Then, the Cards
came back on a two-run single and
a three-run homer by Sullivan.
However, UCLA tallied five times
in the sixth and seventh innings to
take the contest. Again,
Williamson pitched well in the
final two innings.
"About the only time we wake
up at the plate our pitching didn't
hold them off," said Young.
Cards 15, USF 1
A two-run homer by Ray
Anderson in the second inning
started the Cards off on a 15-run
binge against USF.
Steve Davis also homered for
the Card. His shot leading off the
sixth inning highlighted a five-run
barrage which was capped by Bob
Hampton's three-run double.
Gary Bei added a two-run
double in the seventh when the
Cards tallied six times.
"They're not particularly
influenced by what they do," said
Young about the unpredictability
of his club. "It's the same club
today I after the USF game] that
played down in Los Angeles. I
don't know what to say."
A 1 Arthur gained his second
win against five losses for the
season. He throttled the Dons on
four hits, struck out seven and
walked two.
