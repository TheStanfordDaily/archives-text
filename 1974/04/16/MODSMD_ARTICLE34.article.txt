# Undergraduate Ocean Racer
## Fletcher 'High' On Sailing 
### PAUL YEUELL ZACK POLETT 
Stephen Fletcher, a Stanford
undergraduate, has more than
once, since he matriculated, found
the University environment
intolerable. He has spent three of
the last four years on tne Pacific,
cruising and ocean racing.
Since entering Stanford,
Fletcher, or "Boogie" in the
sailing world, has established
himself as one of the west coast's
top crew men in ocean sailboat
racing. He has garnered several
first place credits in both ocean
and bay series racing, in addition
to a first place in the '73
Trans-Pac, the premier event of
west coast ocean sailboat racing.
Fletcher is currently enrolled
at Stanford but he still throws his
tattered sea-bag into "Boris," his
'54 green Chevy panel truck with
taped windows and cruises up to
the harbor for races. Just last
weekend, when the rest of us were
soaking up the rays along the
shores of Lake Lag, "Boogie" was
winning the Arallon Islands race
crewing on the boat "The Animal
Farm."
When he's out of school, he
sails. "Folks in the boatyards ask

me what I do," Fletcher explains,
"because all they ever see me do is
sail. I just smile."
World Traveler
Fletcher's ocean voyaging has
taken him from San Francisco to
Waikiki, Baja and Australia. But
back on campus he views the
commonplace with a hungry stare.
"Most of what I see around here is
funky," says Fletcher, "yet I've
come to feel that there's not a lot
I care to do about it, so I get
high."
Fletcher, like any sailor, gets
particularly high coming in at the
end of a race. "When the
spinnaker pops out and we're
running downwind, surfing in the
swell, we're real high."
The '73 Trans-Pac was an
especially intoxicating experience.
Sailing a custom-designed
prototype aptly named the
"Chutzpah," Fletcher and his
crew-mates won the 3000 mile
race hands down. The
"Chutzpah," over a ton lighter
than a conventional 32-foot
sailboat, is referred to by many
sailors as the "surfboard" because
of its flat bottom and incredible
speed.
'High' Momentum
The problem with being so
high on the race is that when the
winners cross the finish line, their
momentum carries them over into
heavy celebration. "After winning
the Trans-Pac, I remember
walking up for the trophy with a
drink in my hand," says
Fletcher," but then there were
five days after that that I missed."
Another time, after winning a
series on the Bay, Fletcher and his
mates motored up the Sacramento
River to celebrate. On the way
back, they ran aground. The story
has it that they were hung up for
two days and nights. But when
they ran out of beer, they sent for
help.
When asked about ambition

and the future, Fletcher shudders
disdainfully; but when pressed he
admits to a dream of sailing
around Cape Horn by himself
when the time is right. "Cape
Horn," he muses, "a lot of good
men have died there."

men have died there."
Stephen Fletcher, a Stanford
undergraduate, has more than
once, since he matriculated, found
the University environment
intolerable. He has spent three of
the last four years on tne Pacific,
cruising and ocean racing.
Since entering Stanford,
Fletcher, or "Boogie" in the
sailing world, has established
himself as one of the west coast's
top crew men in ocean sailboat
racing. He has garnered several
first place credits in both ocean
and bay series racing, in addition
to a first place in the '73
Trans-Pac, the premier event of
west coast ocean sailboat racing.
Fletcher is currently enrolled
at Stanford but he still throws his
tattered sea-bag into "Boris," his
'54 green Chevy panel truck with
taped windows and cruises up to
the harbor for races. Just last
weekend, when the rest of us were
soaking up the rays along the
shores of Lake Lag, "Boogie" was
winning the Arallon Islands race
crewing on the boat "The Animal
Farm."
When he's out of school, he
sails. "Folks in the boatyards ask

me what I do," Fletcher explains,
"because all they ever see me do is
sail. I just smile."
World Traveler
Fletcher's ocean voyaging has
taken him from San Francisco to
Waikiki, Baja and Australia. But
back on campus he views the
commonplace with a hungry stare.
"Most of what I see around here is
funky," says Fletcher, "yet I've
come to feel that there's not a lot
I care to do about it, so I get
high."
Fletcher, like any sailor, gets
particularly high coming in at the
end of a race. "When the
spinnaker pops out and we're
running downwind, surfing in the
swell, we're real high."
The '73 Trans-Pac was an
especially intoxicating experience.
Sailing a custom-designed
prototype aptly named the
"Chutzpah," Fletcher and his
crew-mates won the 3000 mile
race hands down. The
"Chutzpah," over a ton lighter
than a conventional 32-foot
sailboat, is referred to by many
sailors as the "surfboard" because
of its flat bottom and incredible
speed.
'High' Momentum
The problem with being so
high on the race is that when the
winners cross the finish line, their
momentum carries them over into
heavy celebration. "After winning
the Trans-Pac, I remember
walking up for the trophy with a
drink in my hand," says
Fletcher," but then there were
five days after that that I missed."
Another time, after winning a
series on the Bay, Fletcher and his
mates motored up the Sacramento
River to celebrate. On the way
back, they ran aground. The story
has it that they were hung up for
two days and nights. But when
they ran out of beer, they sent for
help.
When asked about ambition

and the future, Fletcher shudders
disdainfully; but when pressed he
admits to a dream of sailing
around Cape Horn by himself
when the time is right. "Cape
Horn," he muses, "a lot of good
men have died there."
