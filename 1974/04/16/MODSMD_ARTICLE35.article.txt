# Crew Teams Survive At Oregon
## 
### 
Strange things happen up in
Eugene, Oregon. Favored teams —
like UCLA's basketball squad —
come up to Duck country only to
be shot down.
Well, it almost happened to
Stanford's varsity crew team,
which made the long car trip just
before dual races on Saturday.
But not quite.
The Stanford varsity, now 4-1
for the year, pulled out to a lead
of nearly one boat length against
Oregon, then barely staved off a
late challenge to win by the
margin of one seat — the
equivalent of winning by a nose in
horse racing.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal
freshman boat had no trouble
beating a team from Klamath
Falls High School, while the
junior varsity took a two length
decision over Oregon's lightweight
team.
According to captain Dave
Glossbrenner, the varsity event
"was a really good race. They
were psyched up and we were
tired after a long drive up.
"Stanford won stroking at 34,
their foes were at about 35, he
added.
This Saturday, the crewmen
host Santa Clara at Redwood
City. The teams all beat Santa
Clara at the Con Findlay Cup
April 6.
