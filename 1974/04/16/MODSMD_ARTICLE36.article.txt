# Laxmen Whoop, Win

"Hey what's going on over
there, a riot?" said the spectator
in the top row of the Stanford
Varsity Tennis Courts Saturday,
as she saw a lot of funny looking
"butterfly nets" being thrown in
the air and heard what sounded
like lions being let out of the
cages in ancient Rome.
The whoops had invaded the
sanctity of a tennis match between
Stanford's Sandy Mayer and
Southern Methodist's George
Hardie, but while Mayer had little
to cheer about the Stanford
lacrosse club had plenty [as the
din attested to] as they defeated
the San Francisco lacrosse club
11-9.
"This was a very gratifying win
for us," said Stanford assistant
coach Dave Tubbs. The Cards
were down 7-4 at half time, but
rallied to defeat San Francisco
scoring seven goals in the second
half, while holding San Francisco
to only two goals.
"Fred Choate, our goalie,
really came through for us," said
Tubbs. Choate had an amazing
day in the nets with 27 saves.
Stanford got on the scoreboard
first when Jack Mayer took a pass
from Buz Haddow, who led the
Cards with four assists, to give

them a shortlived 1-U lead in the
opening minutes of the first
quarter. San Francisco came back
to allow the Cards just two more
goals while scoring five goals to
take a 5-3 lead in the first half.
Spraggs got the Cards off to a
fine start in the third quarter,
scoring two goals while San
Francisco could manage but one,
which came early in the period.
Mayer also added a goal to the
Stanford cuase to knot the score
at 8-all.
Now it was time for some
inspired play. The Cards spotted
San Francisco a goal with 13:46
gone in the quarter in which San
Francisco took a 9-8 lead. But
that was the last goal Stanford
allowed all day. Haddow came
back just a minute later to knot
the game at 9-all and this set the
stage for what turned out to be
the winning goal.
Mayer tapped in the unassisted
goal with 6:21 remaining in the
game. Spraggs added another goal
with just :34 remaining in the
game to give the Cards an 11-9
margin.
Stanford is now 3-1 in the Bay
Area Lacrosse League standings
and is tied with the Palo Alto
Lacrosse Club for second place.

game to give the Cards an 11-9
margin.
Stanford is now 3-1 in the Bay
Area Lacrosse League standings
and is tied with the Palo Alto
Lacrosse Club for second place.
"Hey what's going on over
there, a riot?" said the spectator
in the top row of the Stanford
Varsity Tennis Courts Saturday,
as she saw a lot of funny looking
"butterfly nets" being thrown in
the air and heard what sounded
like lions being let out of the
cages in ancient Rome.
The whoops had invaded the
sanctity of a tennis match between
Stanford's Sandy Mayer and
Southern Methodist's George
Hardie, but while Mayer had little
to cheer about the Stanford
lacrosse club had plenty [as the
din attested to] as they defeated
the San Francisco lacrosse club
11-9.
"This was a very gratifying win
for us," said Stanford assistant
coach Dave Tubbs. The Cards
were down 7-4 at half time, but
rallied to defeat San Francisco
scoring seven goals in the second
half, while holding San Francisco
to only two goals.
"Fred Choate, our goalie,
really came through for us," said
Tubbs. Choate had an amazing
day in the nets with 27 saves.
Stanford got on the scoreboard
first when Jack Mayer took a pass
from Buz Haddow, who led the
Cards with four assists, to give

them a shortlived 1-U lead in the
opening minutes of the first
quarter. San Francisco came back
to allow the Cards just two more
goals while scoring five goals to
take a 5-3 lead in the first half.
Spraggs got the Cards off to a
fine start in the third quarter,
scoring two goals while San
Francisco could manage but one,
which came early in the period.
Mayer also added a goal to the
Stanford cuase to knot the score
at 8-all.
Now it was time for some
inspired play. The Cards spotted
San Francisco a goal with 13:46
gone in the quarter in which San
Francisco took a 9-8 lead. But
that was the last goal Stanford
allowed all day. Haddow came
back just a minute later to knot
the game at 9-all and this set the
stage for what turned out to be
the winning goal.
Mayer tapped in the unassisted
goal with 6:21 remaining in the
game. Spraggs added another goal
with just :34 remaining in the
game to give the Cards an 11-9
margin.
Stanford is now 3-1 in the Bay
Area Lacrosse League standings
and is tied with the Palo Alto
Lacrosse Club for second place.
