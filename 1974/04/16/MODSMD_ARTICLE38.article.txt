Mitchell Pleads Innocent
NEW YORK — Former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell
swore before a federal trial jury yesterday that he was
innocent of any influence-peddling on behalf of
international financier Robert L. Vesco.
On trial with one time Commerce Secretary Maurice H.
Stans on criminal conspiracy charges, Mitchell was asked at
the close of direct questioning by his attorney:
"Are you guilty or not guilty?"
"Absolutely not guilty to any of those charges,"
Mitchell said.
Mitchell's only admission of intervention on behalf of
Vesco was that after he left the attorney general's office, he
once checked with the Justice Department to find out
whether a perjury case was being prepared against Vesco.
He said the answer was no.
Mitchell, 60, and Stans, 66, are accused of obstructing a
Securities and Exchange Commission fraud investigation of
Vesco in exchange for Vesco's secret $200,000 cash
contribution to President Nixon's 1972 re-election
campaign.
Nixon Files Tax Return
SACRAMENTO — President Nixon, filing his first
California income tax return in a decade, owed no state
taxes for 1973, his tax lawyer disclosed yesterday.
Attorney Dean Butler said he planned to mail the return
late yesterday. He said Nixon's California deductions offset
any California source income that has been declared taxable
by the state.
Nixon received a 60-day extension for filing his federal
income tax return because of the possible effect of his
back-taxes bill on the 1973 return, the Internal Revenue
Service said.
A Congressional committee has declared that Nixon
owes $467,000 in federal taxes for the years 1969-72.
The state of California announced Friday that Nixon
must file state income tax returns for 1969-72 and pay
$4 263.72 in back taxes for the years 1969 and 1970, plus
a penalty and interest. While Nixon must file returns for
1971 and 1972, he owes no taxes for those years because of
substantial deductions, the state's income tax board said.
Butler said those returns will be prepared, and the
money paid, "promptly."
'Zebra' Shootings Total 17
SAN FRANCISCO — The "Zebra-style" shootings of
white persons on the streets of this city have claimed their
17th victim, and police said yesterday they were without
clues in the five-month series of unprovoked attacks.
In the largest manhunt in San Francisco history, police
searched for a black man with a distinctive gold tooth who
opened fire on two white teenagers Sunday night. In each
of the shootings, the victim has been approached by a black
man who opens fire with no warning and for no apparent
reason.
Ward Anderson, 18, and Terry White, 15, of San
Francisco were reported in satisfactory condition yesterday
at San Francisco General Hospital after surgery for a variety
of bullet wounds.
Police said a black man, about 30, with a beard,
mustache, and distinctive gold tooth pumped two shots
into each of them as they were hitchhiking at a bus stop
Sunday night at Hayes and Fillmore streets.
More Wage, Price Controls Lifted
WASHINGTON — The Cost of Living Council yesterday
lifted wage and price controls from food retailers and
wholesalers, including supermarkets, one of the last big
industries which had still been subject to the
administration's dying price control program.

But council director John T. Dunlop said that while
there might be some price increases, the decontrol of the
food industry should not result in "inordinate rises in food
prices in the months ahead ..."
The decontrol action affects virtually all foods on the
supermarket shelf.
Combined sales of the food distribution industry last
year were estimated at $228 billion. The decontrol measure
also applies to the wages of the approximately 2.5 million
employes in the industry.
Job Discrimination Settlement
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration used the
signing yesterday of a historic job discrimination settlement
with nine major steel companies to serve notice that it will
take similar action against other industries.
Under secretary of Labor Richard F. Schubert said that
in industries where race and sex discrimination exist "we
will be knocking on their doors and moving forward against
them as we did with AT&T and the steel industry."
Schubert declined to identify the next civil rights
targets, but government sources said these are likely to be
the copper and aluminum industries.
The sources said they have the same discriminatory job
seniority system as the steel industry.
White House Stiffens Guidelines
WASHINGTON — In the wake of Watergate, the White
House has quietly stiffened the guidelines for its own
staffers who deal with federal regulatory agencies.
A memo circulated last September to President Nixon's
White House staff and the Domestic Council requires now
that any contact with an independent regulatory agency
must be detailed in writing to the White House counsel's
office.
Staff members must also consult with the counsel's
office before making any contacts. Often they are told
there should be no contact made, according to White House
sources familiar with the system.
The new guidelines were drafted after White House chief
of Staff Alexander Haig Jr. asked Leonard Garment, then
White House counsel, to review Nixon staff contacts with
the regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Federal Communications Commission and
Interstate Commerce Commission. Until then, the
guidelines consisted of an admonition of caution that had
been issued early in the administration.
Niger Government Overthrown
LAGOS, Nigeria — The government of drought-stricken
Niger, previously regarded as one of black Africa's stablest
if poorest nations, was toppled yesterday in an army coup,
Radio Niamey reported.
The overthrow of President Hamani Diori's 15-year-old
government was led by Lt. Col. Seyni Kountie, chief of
staff of Niger's 2 500-man army, according to the
broadcasts from Niamey, Niger's capital city.
In a radio address, Kountie said the army acted to relieve
"the catastrophic situation in the country."
"The army had to take its responsibilities. We could not
remain with our arms folded" in a situation where the
citizens of Niger were no longer assured a meal every day,
he said.
The radio reported all was calm in Miamey and said the
army was in "full control." There was no report of violence
during the takeover, but the radio announcements gave no
indication of Diori's whereabouts or condition.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except patches of coastal low
clouds tomorrow. Slightly warmer days. Low tonight and
tomorrow in 40s to low 50s. High both days in 60s to lower
70s. West to northwest winds 10 to 20 mph in afternoons.

The radio reported all was calm in Miamey and said the
army was in "full control." There was no report of violence
during the takeover, but the radio announcements gave no

Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except patches of coastal low

Mitchell Pleads Innocent
NEW YORK — Former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell
swore before a federal trial jury yesterday that he was
innocent of any influence-peddling on behalf of
international financier Robert L. Vesco.
On trial with one time Commerce Secretary Maurice H.
Stans on criminal conspiracy charges, Mitchell was asked at
the close of direct questioning by his attorney:
"Are you guilty or not guilty?"
"Absolutely not guilty to any of those charges,"
Mitchell said.
Mitchell's only admission of intervention on behalf of
Vesco was that after he left the attorney general's office, he
once checked with the Justice Department to find out
whether a perjury case was being prepared against Vesco.
He said the answer was no.
Mitchell, 60, and Stans, 66, are accused of obstructing a
Securities and Exchange Commission fraud investigation of
Vesco in exchange for Vesco's secret $200,000 cash
contribution to President Nixon's 1972 re-election
campaign.
Nixon Files Tax Return
SACRAMENTO — President Nixon, filing his first
California income tax return in a decade, owed no state
taxes for 1973, his tax lawyer disclosed yesterday.
Attorney Dean Butler said he planned to mail the return
late yesterday. He said Nixon's California deductions offset
any California source income that has been declared taxable
by the state.
Nixon received a 60-day extension for filing his federal
income tax return because of the possible effect of his
back-taxes bill on the 1973 return, the Internal Revenue
Service said.
A Congressional committee has declared that Nixon
owes $467,000 in federal taxes for the years 1969-72.
The state of California announced Friday that Nixon
must file state income tax returns for 1969-72 and pay
$4 263.72 in back taxes for the years 1969 and 1970, plus
a penalty and interest. While Nixon must file returns for
1971 and 1972, he owes no taxes for those years because of
substantial deductions, the state's income tax board said.
Butler said those returns will be prepared, and the
money paid, "promptly."
'Zebra' Shootings Total 17
SAN FRANCISCO — The "Zebra-style" shootings of
white persons on the streets of this city have claimed their
17th victim, and police said yesterday they were without
clues in the five-month series of unprovoked attacks.
In the largest manhunt in San Francisco history, police
searched for a black man with a distinctive gold tooth who
opened fire on two white teenagers Sunday night. In each
of the shootings, the victim has been approached by a black
man who opens fire with no warning and for no apparent
reason.
Ward Anderson, 18, and Terry White, 15, of San
Francisco were reported in satisfactory condition yesterday
at San Francisco General Hospital after surgery for a variety
of bullet wounds.
Police said a black man, about 30, with a beard,
mustache, and distinctive gold tooth pumped two shots
into each of them as they were hitchhiking at a bus stop
Sunday night at Hayes and Fillmore streets.
More Wage, Price Controls Lifted
WASHINGTON — The Cost of Living Council yesterday
lifted wage and price controls from food retailers and
wholesalers, including supermarkets, one of the last big
industries which had still been subject to the
administration's dying price control program.

But council director John T. Dunlop said that while
there might be some price increases, the decontrol of the
food industry should not result in "inordinate rises in food
prices in the months ahead ..."
The decontrol action affects virtually all foods on the
supermarket shelf.
Combined sales of the food distribution industry last
year were estimated at $228 billion. The decontrol measure
also applies to the wages of the approximately 2.5 million
employes in the industry.
Job Discrimination Settlement
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration used the
signing yesterday of a historic job discrimination settlement
with nine major steel companies to serve notice that it will
take similar action against other industries.
Under secretary of Labor Richard F. Schubert said that
in industries where race and sex discrimination exist "we
will be knocking on their doors and moving forward against
them as we did with AT&T and the steel industry."
Schubert declined to identify the next civil rights
targets, but government sources said these are likely to be
the copper and aluminum industries.
The sources said they have the same discriminatory job
seniority system as the steel industry.
White House Stiffens Guidelines
WASHINGTON — In the wake of Watergate, the White
House has quietly stiffened the guidelines for its own
staffers who deal with federal regulatory agencies.
A memo circulated last September to President Nixon's
White House staff and the Domestic Council requires now
that any contact with an independent regulatory agency
must be detailed in writing to the White House counsel's
office.
Staff members must also consult with the counsel's
office before making any contacts. Often they are told
there should be no contact made, according to White House
sources familiar with the system.
The new guidelines were drafted after White House chief
of Staff Alexander Haig Jr. asked Leonard Garment, then
White House counsel, to review Nixon staff contacts with
the regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Federal Communications Commission and
Interstate Commerce Commission. Until then, the
guidelines consisted of an admonition of caution that had
been issued early in the administration.
Niger Government Overthrown
LAGOS, Nigeria — The government of drought-stricken
Niger, previously regarded as one of black Africa's stablest
if poorest nations, was toppled yesterday in an army coup,
Radio Niamey reported.
The overthrow of President Hamani Diori's 15-year-old
government was led by Lt. Col. Seyni Kountie, chief of
staff of Niger's 2 500-man army, according to the
broadcasts from Niamey, Niger's capital city.
In a radio address, Kountie said the army acted to relieve
"the catastrophic situation in the country."
"The army had to take its responsibilities. We could not
remain with our arms folded" in a situation where the
citizens of Niger were no longer assured a meal every day,
he said.
The radio reported all was calm in Miamey and said the
army was in "full control." There was no report of violence
during the takeover, but the radio announcements gave no
indication of Diori's whereabouts or condition.

The overthrow of President Hamani Diori's 15-year-old
government was led by Lt. Col. Seyni Kountie, chief of
staff of Niger's 2 500-man army, according to the
broadcasts from Niamey, Niger's capital city.
In a radio address, Kountie said the army acted to relieve
"the catastrophic situation in the country."
"The army had to take its responsibilities. We could not
remain with our arms folded" in a situation where the
citizens of Niger were no longer assured a meal every day,
he said.
The radio reported all was calm in Miamey and said the
army was in "full control." There was no report of violence
during the takeover, but the radio announcements gave no
indication of Diori's whereabouts or condition.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except patches of coastal low
clouds tomorrow. Slightly warmer days. Low tonight and
tomorrow in 40s to low 50s. High both days in 60s to lower
70s. West to northwest winds 10 to 20 mph in afternoons.
Mitchell Pleads Innocent
NEW YORK — Former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell
swore before a federal trial jury yesterday that he was
innocent of any influence-peddling on behalf of
international financier Robert L. Vesco.
On trial with one time Commerce Secretary Maurice H.
Stans on criminal conspiracy charges, Mitchell was asked at
the close of direct questioning by his attorney:
"Are you guilty or not guilty?"
"Absolutely not guilty to any of those charges,"
Mitchell said.
Mitchell's only admission of intervention on behalf of
Vesco was that after he left the attorney general's office, he
once checked with the Justice Department to find out
whether a perjury case was being prepared against Vesco.
He said the answer was no.
Mitchell, 60, and Stans, 66, are accused of obstructing a
Securities and Exchange Commission fraud investigation of
Vesco in exchange for Vesco's secret $200,000 cash
contribution to President Nixon's 1972 re-election
campaign.
Nixon Files Tax Return
SACRAMENTO — President Nixon, filing his first
California income tax return in a decade, owed no state
taxes for 1973, his tax lawyer disclosed yesterday.
Attorney Dean Butler said he planned to mail the return
late yesterday. He said Nixon's California deductions offset
any California source income that has been declared taxable
by the state.
Nixon received a 60-day extension for filing his federal
income tax return because of the possible effect of his
back-taxes bill on the 1973 return, the Internal Revenue
Service said.
A Congressional committee has declared that Nixon
owes $467,000 in federal taxes for the years 1969-72.
The state of California announced Friday that Nixon
must file state income tax returns for 1969-72 and pay
$4 263.72 in back taxes for the years 1969 and 1970, plus
a penalty and interest. While Nixon must file returns for
1971 and 1972, he owes no taxes for those years because of
substantial deductions, the state's income tax board said.
Butler said those returns will be prepared, and the
money paid, "promptly."
'Zebra' Shootings Total 17
SAN FRANCISCO — The "Zebra-style" shootings of
white persons on the streets of this city have claimed their
17th victim, and police said yesterday they were without
clues in the five-month series of unprovoked attacks.
In the largest manhunt in San Francisco history, police
searched for a black man with a distinctive gold tooth who
opened fire on two white teenagers Sunday night. In each
of the shootings, the victim has been approached by a black
man who opens fire with no warning and for no apparent
reason.
Ward Anderson, 18, and Terry White, 15, of San
Francisco were reported in satisfactory condition yesterday
at San Francisco General Hospital after surgery for a variety
of bullet wounds.
Police said a black man, about 30, with a beard,
mustache, and distinctive gold tooth pumped two shots
into each of them as they were hitchhiking at a bus stop
Sunday night at Hayes and Fillmore streets.
More Wage, Price Controls Lifted
WASHINGTON — The Cost of Living Council yesterday
lifted wage and price controls from food retailers and
wholesalers, including supermarkets, one of the last big
industries which had still been subject to the
administration's dying price control program.

But council director John T. Dunlop said that while
there might be some price increases, the decontrol of the
food industry should not result in "inordinate rises in food
prices in the months ahead ..."
The decontrol action affects virtually all foods on the
supermarket shelf.
Combined sales of the food distribution industry last
year were estimated at $228 billion. The decontrol measure
also applies to the wages of the approximately 2.5 million
employes in the industry.
Job Discrimination Settlement
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration used the
signing yesterday of a historic job discrimination settlement
with nine major steel companies to serve notice that it will
take similar action against other industries.
Under secretary of Labor Richard F. Schubert said that
in industries where race and sex discrimination exist "we
will be knocking on their doors and moving forward against
them as we did with AT&T and the steel industry."
Schubert declined to identify the next civil rights
targets, but government sources said these are likely to be
the copper and aluminum industries.
The sources said they have the same discriminatory job
seniority system as the steel industry.
White House Stiffens Guidelines
WASHINGTON — In the wake of Watergate, the White
House has quietly stiffened the guidelines for its own
staffers who deal with federal regulatory agencies.
A memo circulated last September to President Nixon's
White House staff and the Domestic Council requires now
that any contact with an independent regulatory agency
must be detailed in writing to the White House counsel's
office.
Staff members must also consult with the counsel's
office before making any contacts. Often they are told
there should be no contact made, according to White House
sources familiar with the system.
The new guidelines were drafted after White House chief
of Staff Alexander Haig Jr. asked Leonard Garment, then
White House counsel, to review Nixon staff contacts with
the regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Federal Communications Commission and
Interstate Commerce Commission. Until then, the
guidelines consisted of an admonition of caution that had
been issued early in the administration.
Niger Government Overthrown
LAGOS, Nigeria — The government of drought-stricken
Niger, previously regarded as one of black Africa's stablest
