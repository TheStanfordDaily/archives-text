# Program Fee Passes

The ASSU Program Fee assessment
voted upon last week has passed,
ASSU Elections Commissioner Rick
Haskell confirmed last night.
Haskell's announcement ended
confusion over whether enough
students had turned out in last week's
election to satisfy a minimal voter
turnout requirement of the ASSU
Constitution.
Money from the assessment will
support 41 various campus
organizations and publications. The
Black Students Union will receive the
largest share, $7900 or 10.3 percent of
the allocations. The next largest
allotment will go to the Tresidder
Program Board, which will receive
$3000 or 7.7 percent of the money.
Although original tabulations of the
election showed that those voting had
passed the measure by nearly a three
to one margin, Haskell was not sure
the necessary 20 percent of the
student body had voted. Haskell was
unsure how many students had voted
or how many students were registered
on the election date.

Haskell said yesterday that 2214 or
21.0 percent of the student body had
voted last week.
The Stanford overseas campuses in
Britain and Italy telegraphed in the
last votes to be counted last weekend.
Together, they added 62 votes to the
total.
However, Haskell explained the
votes were not essential to the passage
of the fee assessment, as was first
suspected.
The number of students registered
at the time of the election was 10,550,
according to Registrar Sally Mahoney.
This means that the 2152 voter
total before the overseas results
arrived was already 42 votes more
than 20 percent of the student body.
All that remains for the results to
be official is certification by the ASSU
Senate. This group did not meet last
night because it was unable to muster
a quorum.
However, ASSU Financial Manager
Dave Martin and several senators said
they didn't foresee any problems with
certification when the Senate meets
next week.
