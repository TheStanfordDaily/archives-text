# Murder Hinted In Ex-Student Disappearance
## 
### 
A second former Stanford student
is missing under circumstances
possibly related to the death of former
campus activist Barbara Ann (Nan)
Goldie, the San Francisco Examiner
reported yesterday.
Kristin Dana Hind, a close friend of
Goldie and the daughter of a former
Stanford administrator, disappeared
with Goldie on Nov. 3, 1971 after
spending that night in a Spokane,
Wash, motel.
Scattered human bones found in
northeastern Washington last August
were only last month identified as
Goldie's.
According to reports, Goldie, Hind
and former Stanford Medical Center
biophysicist Earl Edwin Jacobs were
among the residents of a British
Columbia commune. The three, plus
two other commune residents who
have not been located, were en route
back to the Bay Area when they
stopped at the Spokane motel.
Last Phone Call?
Jacobs died that night of an
overdose of sleeping pills. Hind has not
been heard from since, except for a
Nov. 4, 1972 phone call to a relative in
New York.
Goldie, a one-time debutante and
daughter of a prominent San Francisco
family, was a well-known campus
activist here. School records show she
was registered intermittently from
1965 through 1969. She never
graduated.
Hind, also active in campus
demonstrations, attended Stanford on
and off from 1966 until 1969. She
majored in sociology and later
psychology, but also never graduated.
Complex Case
Hind is the daughter of Robert R.
Hind Jr., a former associate dean of
Undergraduate Education who left
Stanford in 1969. He is now director
of the Academy for Educational
Development in Palo Alto.
The Goldie death and Hind
disappearance are under investigation
by Washington police, the FBI and the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP). Stevens County, Wash.,
Sheriff Chan St. Clair said he believes
there has been at least one homicide,
according to the Examiner.
Adding to the complexity of the
case is the July 25, 1971 death of Lila
Patty Jacobs, Jacobs' wife, who also
succumbed to an overdose of sleeping
pills. Jacobs later married Hind, and
reportedly had a subsequent affair
with Goldie when both were living at
the British Columbia commune.
