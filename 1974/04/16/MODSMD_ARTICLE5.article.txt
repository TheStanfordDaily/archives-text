# County Abandons Odd-Even Plan
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors contends that the state's
odd-even gas plan worked successfully in the
county and helped alleviate the local
gas shortage.
Declaring that the gas crisis has
passed the Board voted 5-0 last week
to abandon the mandatory program of
gas allocation.
"The plan was definitely a success,"
Supervisor Ralph Mehrkens stated
yesterday. "But we were cautious
about terminating it because we didn't
want another emergency shortage of
gas."
Mehrkens attributed the original gas
shortage to bad allocation procedures
by gasoline dealers. Allocation was
based on sales during 1972 and failed
to take into consideration population
fluctuations, he explained.
'100 Percent Success'
Ken Davis, president of the San

Jose chapter of the National
Association of Service Station Dealers,
stated that the odd-even plan was "a
100 percent success." The most
important result of the plan was that
"it took the panic out of the people,"
he noted. When motorists were forced
to go a day without gas but realized
they could obtain it the next day the
gas lines disappeared, he explained.
Supervisor Victor Calvo stated that
Santa Clara County residents generally
supported the plan.
Telephone Calls
"We were deluged early in March
with telephone calls opposing it during
its first few days in operation," Calvo
said. "But after a while, people
realized that the plan was working. As
people became accustomed to the
program, complaints diminished."
Calvo emphasized the Board
terminated the plan only when it
became convinced that the gas

shortage wouldn't recur.
"All indications pointed to the fact
that the gas shortage was over," Calvo
said. "The quotas reported by the
gasoline companies for May and June
showed that allocations seemed
adequate for the months ahead."
Orange County
Calvo noted that Orange County
went off the plan three weeks ago, and
San Mateo County discontinued the
program at about the same time as
Santa Clara County.
"The big question now is why the
gas shortage was thrust upon us so
suddenly and why it ended so
suddenly," Calvo stated.
He said that the oil industry should
review its operations to insure there
are no more fuel crises.
Legislation
"I expect to see the federal
government enact legislation to deal
with the problem of production
market reporting," Calvo declared.
Calvo explained that gasoline
allocation is reported through a
complicated system lacking central
control. The government should
simplify and centralize reporting
procedures, he suggested.
Davis agreed that no one seems to
know why the gas shortage began or
ended so abruptly.
"Obviously, the gas shortage has
ended because the gas companies have
more oil," he said. "But this can't be
due to the end of the oil embargo. It
ended only 30 days ago and it is
impossible to transport crude oil to
the United States and refine it in one
month," Davis remarked.
Mehrkens declared that he hopes
that there will be no more gas
shortages that would force the county
to reinstate the odd-even plan. "That
would be disillusioning to the people."

with telephone calls opposing it during
its first few days in operation," Calvo
said. "But after a while, people
realized that the plan was working. As
people became accustomed to the
program, complaints diminished."
Calvo emphasized the Board
terminated the plan only when it
became convinced that the gas

shortage wouldn't recur.
"All indications pointed to the fact
that the gas shortage was over," Calvo
said. "The quotas reported by the
gasoline companies for May and June
showed that allocations seemed
adequate for the months ahead."
Orange County
Calvo noted that Orange County
went off the plan three weeks ago, and
San Mateo County discontinued the
program at about the same time as
Santa Clara County.
"The big question now is why the
gas shortage was thrust upon us so
suddenly and why it ended so
suddenly," Calvo stated.
He said that the oil industry should
review its operations to insure there
are no more fuel crises.
Legislation
"I expect to see the federal
government enact legislation to deal
with the problem of production
market reporting," Calvo declared.
Calvo explained that gasoline
allocation is reported through a
complicated system lacking central
control. The government should
simplify and centralize reporting
procedures, he suggested.
Davis agreed that no one seems to
know why the gas shortage began or
ended so abruptly.
"Obviously, the gas shortage has
ended because the gas companies have
more oil," he said. "But this can't be
due to the end of the oil embargo. It
ended only 30 days ago and it is
impossible to transport crude oil to
the United States and refine it in one
month," Davis remarked.
Mehrkens declared that he hopes
that there will be no more gas
shortages that would force the county
to reinstate the odd-even plan. "That
would be disillusioning to the people."
The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors contends that the state's
odd-even gas plan worked successfully in the
county and helped alleviate the local
gas shortage.
Declaring that the gas crisis has
passed the Board voted 5-0 last week
to abandon the mandatory program of
gas allocation.
"The plan was definitely a success,"
Supervisor Ralph Mehrkens stated
yesterday. "But we were cautious
about terminating it because we didn't
want another emergency shortage of
gas."
Mehrkens attributed the original gas
shortage to bad allocation procedures
by gasoline dealers. Allocation was
based on sales during 1972 and failed
to take into consideration population
fluctuations, he explained.
'100 Percent Success'
Ken Davis, president of the San

Jose chapter of the National
Association of Service Station Dealers,
stated that the odd-even plan was "a
100 percent success." The most
important result of the plan was that
"it took the panic out of the people,"
he noted. When motorists were forced
to go a day without gas but realized
they could obtain it the next day the
gas lines disappeared, he explained.
Supervisor Victor Calvo stated that
Santa Clara County residents generally
supported the plan.
Telephone Calls
"We were deluged early in March
with telephone calls opposing it during
its first few days in operation," Calvo
said. "But after a while, people
realized that the plan was working. As
people became accustomed to the
program, complaints diminished."
Calvo emphasized the Board
