# Berkeley Official Speaks
## 'Thieu Allows Prison Torture' 
### JOHN FREED 
Torturing and beating of political
prisoners in South Vietnam is routine,
a Berkeley city councilwoman who
recently visited that country told 40
listeners at Bishop Auditorium last
night.
"When [South Vietnamese
officials] want information, they
would beat or torture the prisoners.
This seemed to be a fairly standard
practice. From prisoner to prisoner,
we found a pretty steady system,"
stated Ying Lee Kelley, one of five
Americans who traveled to Vietnam
last January under the auspices of the
Saigon Inquiry Committee.
Kelley spoke last night in
connection with the effort to bring
Ngyuen Huu Thai, a South Vietnamese
political prisoner, here as a guest
professor. Students will vote
tomorrow and Thursday on a fee
assessment to fund the ASSU Guest
Professor program.
Wait For Release
"If the lesser miracle of Stanford
students approving the referendum
happens, we must still wait for the
greater miracle of [South Vietnamese
President Ngyuen Van] Thieu's
government, releasing him," Kelley
said.
She added that passage of the
referendum and a subsequent
invitation to Thai to lecture here

would help change conditions for ali
political prisoners in Vietnam.
"You will change conditions not
only for Mr. Thai—for he is, after all,
only one political prisoner out of
many— but you will shed light on the
entire prison system in Vietnam,"
Kelley stated.
Political Prisoners
Saigon government officially
maintains there are no political
prisoners, and American officials say
there are "perhaps a few." Amnesty
International, an organization devoted
to release of all political prisoners
claims there are more than 100,000
political prisoners filling South
Vietnam's prison camps.
"[Thieu] has put many persons in
prison like Mr. Thai— intelligent,
articulate, conscientious persons. We
have the names of thousands of
political prisoners," Kelley said.
She accused Thieu of being a
militarist, uninterested in
reconciliation with the North.
"Thieu has never made any attempt
to find a political solution. In fact, he
tries to make the most belligerent
actions. It's hardly the sort of
arrangement that leads to a peace
agreement," she explained.
Neutrality "A Crime"

totally unpopular government" in

which "to be neutral is a crime." She
said that persons who openly state a
neutral position are considered to be
communists.
"We talked to people that had done
no more than collect signatures on a
peace petition, and were picked up [as
political prisoners]," she alleged.
She estimated the number of
political hostages at 200,000. About
50 of them were released in March,
according to Kelley.
"IThe prisoners] said they saw
American advisers, in uniform, walking
in and out of the prisons as late as
March," she related.
Martin Refuses
The group tried to get American
Ambassador Graham Martin to help
them gain entry to the prison camps.
According to Kelley, Martin gave a
point-blank refusal.
"Graham Martin turned to me and
said, 'You, as an Asian, should
appreciate the fact that Vietnam is a
sovereign country,'" she reported.
Thieu's unpopularity forces him to
violate specific provisions of the Paris
Peace Agreements, Kelley asserted.
"That's why he can't risk an
election, that's why he can't risk a
political solution. He can only risk a
military solution. He manages to keep
his territory fairly secure by use of
sheer military force," she maintained.

Vietnam's prison camps.
"[Thieu] has put many persons in
prison like Mr. Thai— intelligent,
articulate, conscientious persons. We
have the names of thousands of
political prisoners," Kelley said.
She accused Thieu of being a
militarist, uninterested in
reconciliation with the North.
"Thieu has never made any attempt
to find a political solution. In fact, he
tries to make the most belligerent
actions. It's hardly the sort of
arrangement that leads to a peace
agreement," she explained.
Neutrality "A Crime"
She described Thieu's regime as "a
totally unpopular government" in

SKEPTICAL—BerkeIey Councilwoman Ying Lee Kelley told a Bishop
Auditorium audience last night that there is no chance that South Vietnam will
release political prisoner Nguyen Huu Thai unless he is invited to Stanford as a
guest professor.
which "to be neutral is a crime." She
said that persons who openly state a
neutral position are considered to be
communists.
"We talked to people that had done
no more than collect signatures on a
peace petition, and were picked up [as
political prisoners]," she alleged.
She estimated the number of
political hostages at 200,000. About
50 of them were released in March,
according to Kelley.
"IThe prisoners] said they saw
American advisers, in uniform, walking
in and out of the prisons as late as
March," she related.
Martin Refuses
The group tried to get American
Ambassador Graham Martin to help
them gain entry to the prison camps.
According to Kelley, Martin gave a
point-blank refusal.
"Graham Martin turned to me and
said, 'You, as an Asian, should
appreciate the fact that Vietnam is a
sovereign country,'" she reported.
Thieu's unpopularity forces him to
violate specific provisions of the Paris
Peace Agreements, Kelley asserted.
"That's why he can't risk an
election, that's why he can't risk a
political solution. He can only risk a
military solution. He manages to keep
his territory fairly secure by use of
sheer military force," she maintained.
Torturing and beating of political
prisoners in South Vietnam is routine,
a Berkeley city councilwoman who
recently visited that country told 40
listeners at Bishop Auditorium last
night.
"When [South Vietnamese
officials] want information, they
would beat or torture the prisoners.
This seemed to be a fairly standard
practice. From prisoner to prisoner,
we found a pretty steady system,"
stated Ying Lee Kelley, one of five
Americans who traveled to Vietnam
last January under the auspices of the
Saigon Inquiry Committee.
Kelley spoke last night in
connection with the effort to bring
Ngyuen Huu Thai, a South Vietnamese
political prisoner, here as a guest
professor. Students will vote
tomorrow and Thursday on a fee
assessment to fund the ASSU Guest
Professor program.
Wait For Release
"If the lesser miracle of Stanford
students approving the referendum
happens, we must still wait for the
greater miracle of [South Vietnamese
President Ngyuen Van] Thieu's
government, releasing him," Kelley
said.
She added that passage of the
referendum and a subsequent
invitation to Thai to lecture here

would help change conditions for ali
political prisoners in Vietnam.
"You will change conditions not
only for Mr. Thai—for he is, after all,
only one political prisoner out of
many— but you will shed light on the
entire prison system in Vietnam,"
Kelley stated.
Political Prisoners
Saigon government officially
maintains there are no political
prisoners, and American officials say
there are "perhaps a few." Amnesty
International, an organization devoted
to release of all political prisoners
claims there are more than 100,000
political prisoners filling South
Vietnam's prison camps.
