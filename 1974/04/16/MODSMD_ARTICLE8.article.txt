## Fee Assessments 
### 
Here are our recommendations for the forthcoming
ASSU balloting on the Council of Presidents, fee assessments
and constitutional amendments:
COUNCIL OF PRESIDENTS
The Daily will make no further endorsement in the
Council of Presidents race beyond its April 5 statement that
the Editorial Board split, with half for the 800 Bacon slate
and half for the Mike Herman slate.
PIRG
The Daily urges a YES vote on the $1, one-quarter fee
assessment for the Northern California Public Interest Group
(NorCal PI RG). This organization appears to be worthy, and
should be given a chance to prove its effectiveness to the
students. Given the system of funding, students will have a
chance to pass judgment on the organization's effectiveness
in the form of future fee assessments.
NorCal PIRG promises to do research and analysis of a
public interest in areas such as consumer affairs, resource
planning, racial and sexual discrimination, and so forth.
Many of these areas directly affect students, and an
organization which helps to inform the public of actions in
these areas would be a welcome addition to the campus.
GUEST PROFESSORSHIP
The Daily recommends a NO vote on the proposals for a
fee assessment to fund the ASSU Guest Professorship and to
select the Vietnamese journalist Nguyen Huu Thai to fill
that post.
While we are not averse to the concept of the guest
professorship, we are not convinced that Thai has sufficient
qualifications to justify the large amount of money
involved. Nor do we wish to present the ASSU Senate with a
$1 2,000 check to bestow as it pleases. Students should get a
chance to vote on anyone selected to fill the guest post, at
least as long as it is funded.
KZSU
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the $1,
two-quarter KZSU fee assessment.
We remain unhappy, as we have stated previously, over
the manner in which KZSU obtained its last fee assessment,
particularly in regards to its proposed power increase, which
was subsequently refused by the Federal Communications
Commission.
However, we also recognize the many accomplishments
of KZSU and the valuable entertainment and informational
functions it serves for the students, and indeed the entire
community. We are particularly impressed with the
institution of the present music programming format, which
is a genuine response to student wants.
SPEAKERS BUREAU
We urge students to vote YES on the $1, one-quarter fee
assessment for the ASSU Speakers Bureau. It is true that the
Bureau has been lackluster this year, but the primary reason
for its inaction was that it ran out of money early in the fall.
We feel that students got their money's worth out of the
last Speakers Bureau assessment. The Bureau used these
funds to bring such prominent speakers as William F.
Buckley Jr., Daniel Ellsberg and author Tom Wolfe to
campus. Hopefully, with new funds, the ASSU
Guest-in-Residence program can become more active in
placing speakers in dormitories to interact with students.
While we believe the Bureau should solicit more speakers
on its own instead of merely distributing funds to speakers
brought by other organizations, the fact is that the Bureau
can do nothing without additional funding.
LEGAL COUNSELING OFFICE
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the $1,
two-quarter ASSU Legal Counseling Office fee assessment.
We are impressed with figures provided by the LCO
concerning the number and range of students who have used
the service this year, and we think it deserves continued
support.
BAND
We recommend a YES vote on the $1 fee assessment to
the Stanford Band. This money is used primarily to aid band
members in making trips to far away athletic events such as
the Michigan football game last year and Penn State this
year. We believe the Band is one of the University's best
instruments of public relations, and this money would help
insure that it remained such.
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS
The vote on constitutional amendments, originally
scheduled for last week, was postponed to change the
wording on the amendment for Nominations Commission
removal. Since we have not yet seen the reworded
amendment, we do not feel we can legitimately decide on its
merits. Thus, we change our stance on the reworded
amendment from NO to NO ENDORSEMENT.
To reiterate, we urge a NO vote on changing the date of
Senate elections from autumn to spring, and a YES vote on
delaying for a week the ASSU Presidential elections.
Here are our recommendations for the forthcoming
ASSU balloting on the Council of Presidents, fee assessments
and constitutional amendments:

We recommend a YES vote on the $1 fee assessment to
the Stanford Band. This money is used primarily to aid band
members in making trips to far away athletic events such as
the Michigan football game last year and Penn State this
year. We believe the Band is one of the University's best
instruments of public relations, and this money would help
insure that it remained such.
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS
The vote on constitutional amendments, originally
scheduled for last week, was postponed to change the
wording on the amendment for Nominations Commission
removal. Since we have not yet seen the reworded
amendment, we do not feel we can legitimately decide on its
merits. Thus, we change our stance on the reworded
amendment from NO to NO ENDORSEMENT.
To reiterate, we urge a NO vote on changing the date of
Senate elections from autumn to spring, and a YES vote on
delaying for a week the ASSU Presidential elections.
Here are our recommendations for the forthcoming
ASSU balloting on the Council of Presidents, fee assessments
and constitutional amendments:
COUNCIL OF PRESIDENTS
The Daily will make no further endorsement in the
Council of Presidents race beyond its April 5 statement that
the Editorial Board split, with half for the 800 Bacon slate
and half for the Mike Herman slate.
PIRG
The Daily urges a YES vote on the $1, one-quarter fee
assessment for the Northern California Public Interest Group
(NorCal PI RG). This organization appears to be worthy, and
should be given a chance to prove its effectiveness to the
students. Given the system of funding, students will have a
chance to pass judgment on the organization's effectiveness
in the form of future fee assessments.
NorCal PIRG promises to do research and analysis of a
public interest in areas such as consumer affairs, resource
planning, racial and sexual discrimination, and so forth.
Many of these areas directly affect students, and an
organization which helps to inform the public of actions in
these areas would be a welcome addition to the campus.
GUEST PROFESSORSHIP
The Daily recommends a NO vote on the proposals for a
fee assessment to fund the ASSU Guest Professorship and to
select the Vietnamese journalist Nguyen Huu Thai to fill
that post.
While we are not averse to the concept of the guest
professorship, we are not convinced that Thai has sufficient
qualifications to justify the large amount of money
involved. Nor do we wish to present the ASSU Senate with a
$1 2,000 check to bestow as it pleases. Students should get a
chance to vote on anyone selected to fill the guest post, at
least as long as it is funded.
KZSU
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the $1,
two-quarter KZSU fee assessment.
We remain unhappy, as we have stated previously, over
the manner in which KZSU obtained its last fee assessment,
particularly in regards to its proposed power increase, which
was subsequently refused by the Federal Communications
Commission.
However, we also recognize the many accomplishments
of KZSU and the valuable entertainment and informational
functions it serves for the students, and indeed the entire
community. We are particularly impressed with the
institution of the present music programming format, which
is a genuine response to student wants.
SPEAKERS BUREAU
We urge students to vote YES on the $1, one-quarter fee
assessment for the ASSU Speakers Bureau. It is true that the
Bureau has been lackluster this year, but the primary reason
for its inaction was that it ran out of money early in the fall.
We feel that students got their money's worth out of the
last Speakers Bureau assessment. The Bureau used these
funds to bring such prominent speakers as William F.
Buckley Jr., Daniel Ellsberg and author Tom Wolfe to
campus. Hopefully, with new funds, the ASSU
Guest-in-Residence program can become more active in
placing speakers in dormitories to interact with students.
While we believe the Bureau should solicit more speakers
on its own instead of merely distributing funds to speakers
brought by other organizations, the fact is that the Bureau
can do nothing without additional funding.
LEGAL COUNSELING OFFICE
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the $1,
two-quarter ASSU Legal Counseling Office fee assessment.
We are impressed with figures provided by the LCO
concerning the number and range of students who have used
the service this year, and we think it deserves continued
support.
BAND
We recommend a YES vote on the $1 fee assessment to
the Stanford Band. This money is used primarily to aid band
members in making trips to far away athletic events such as
the Michigan football game last year and Penn State this
year. We believe the Band is one of the University's best
