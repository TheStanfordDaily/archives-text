# Lyman Still Optimistic In USE Negotiations
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
President Richard Lyman declared
last night that he is optimistic about
the chances for a settlement between
University negotiators and United
Stanford Employees (USE).
"The two sides are at the bargaining
table and there are signs of
movement," Lyman said. "I'm more
optimistic than I was a week ago."
USE members voted last week to
reject a University settlement. Jim
Berk, union president, declared that if
bargaining sessions did not produce a
compromise by the end of April, USE
uembers would vote to strike.
"There are still a host of problems
to be solved," Lyman said. "There
always are problems when an initial
agreement is being negotiated. The
whole matter is not over yet but we
are nearer to an agreement than we
were last week."
But Lyman added that he is not yet
certain that a strike can be avoided.
Lyman noted that administrators are
developing contingency plans to keep
the University open in case of a strike.
Not Extensive
Such plans are not extensive or
precise, however, he emphasized. "It
would be a mistake to plan too
much," he explained, noting that a
strike is not yet imminent.
Lyman criticized Berk's contention
that the University should dip into its
endowment or raise more money to
help pay for the wage increases
demanded by USE negotiators.
Lyman said that the University is
already "using every bit of its energy
and resourcefulness" to improve its
financial position. Using endowment
money to meet union demands would
be a "shortsighted approach," Lyman
said. It would cost the University part
of its income by reducing interest on

capital, he explained.
Employees Interests
"University employees, like
administrators, have an interest in
seeing that the University's position is
as viable the day after tomorrow as it
is today," Lyman said.
When asked about the progress of
the Campaign For Stanford, Lyman
stated that the University's attitude is
one of "wary optimism."
The fund raising drive, designed to
raisfe $300 million in five years, has
reached the half-way mark at the end
of its second year, it was announced
last week.
Inflation Hurts
Lyman noted that inflation has cut
into donations and a declining stock
market has hurt the program
somewhat, but that it has been
successful.
Lyman noted that contributions for
current expenses and endowment are
running on schedule, but gifts and
pledges for the building fund are
behind schedule. This is a reversal of
the trends of previous fund raising
efforts, he said.
Lyman explained that the declining
economy has made people reluctant to
contribute the large sums necessary to
start nucleus funds for new
construction projects on campus. The
need for a new $20 million library is
especially acute, he said.
Lyman added that he is worried
that proposed federal programs for tax
reform might hinder contributions, as
it would reduce the tax benefits
derived from philanthropy.
He stated that he fears that such
legislation might "sweep away
contributions to universities and
philanthropic agencies along with
genuine abuses."
