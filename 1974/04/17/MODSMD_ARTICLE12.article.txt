# Faculty And Constitutional Rights
## 
### 
Rosenberg, Roth

The statement on faculty rights, codifying
certain rights and procedures available for
redress of grievances, is now being debated in
the Faculty Senate. A floor management
committee has brought in a proposal which
we believe is seriously defective. We wish
here to indicate what the most serious
defects are and to suggest alternative
approaches.
We believe that constitutional protections
need to be affirmed in the statement. The
proposal now before the Senate is very weak
in this respect. Although it seems to assert
that the University will not infringe on the
exercise of free speech, it does not in fact
assure that one's livelihood is not jeopardized
by the exercise of the right of free speech.
Thus if a letter to the Daily were written
by a faculty member which was so
inflammatory as to raise the hackles of
alumni, trustees, the President, and the
majority of the faculty, it should still be a
matter of right that no charge be brought
under the discipline code against the letter
writer.
If a civil court were to find the letter
protected in the constitutional sense, the
University should be constrained from
charging the faculty member. As the matter
now stands, this protection is missing. It
seems that some colleagues consider it
unfashionably civil libertarian to take such a
position.
Too Little Concern
It is worth noting that it is precisely the
position enjoyed by faculty at the University
of California at Berkeley. We believe the
floor managmenet committee has shown too
little concern for the rights of dissenters
within the University.
Another major disagreement we have with
the Senate proposal as submitted is that it
establishes an internal grievance procedure
and then states that this procedure so
adequately protects our "noncontractual"

rights that we can and should renounce
recourse to the courts.
To be more precise, it is suggested that we
are to forswear for ourselves, and for future
generations of faculty, court review of the
substance of charges. We are not precluded
from requesting court review of the question
whether in a particular case the internal
hearing procedure has in fact been
conducted.
This is not unlike a hypothetical Article
11 of the United States Constitution which
would restrict the Supreme Court to review
of cases with respect to due process and
preclude their examining anything elseâ€” and
then to present such an article as a fitting
part of the Bill of Rights!
Two Objections
We have two objections: First, we believe
that impartial external review of the
substance of conflicts is occasionally
essential. Second, no faculty right is being
asserted in this section of the "rights"
statement.
If it is desirable to minimize court
interference into University affairs, we
believe it is important that faculties choose
their colleagues wisely, that administrators
administer with forbearance, etc.
Indeed legal embroilment as a
consequence of faculty-administrative
hostility has been a negligible problem, and
we are suspicious of those who raise spectres
of court interference in academic affairs as
cause for divesting ourselves of an important
protection. We believe this portion of the
"rights" statement must be deleted.
We are dissatisfied with the current form
of the statement with respect to guarantees
of rights of access to faculty files. We believe
that individuals should have access to all
information kept in their files (excepting at
most letters of reference obtained from
outside the University in the course of

appointment and promotion procedures). We
feel internal assessments should be made
available for inspection and we should have
the right to file disclaimers and to rebut
negative assessments.
Surveillance Unjust
We believe the statement should clearly
assert that surveillance techniques, spying
and other underhanded attacks on faculty
freedom and independence should be barred
explicitly from the University and that a
statement to that effect should be included
in the document.
Finally, we have grave misgivings about
the proposed so-called grievance procedure.
There are two related documents, one
concerned with faculty discipline and the
other concerned with faculty rights. Let us
for a moment consider the University as a
hierarchical structure with the President at
the apex and the faculty at the base.
With respect to discipline, complaints flow
from apex to base. With respect to rights,
they flow from base to apex. Whether as
complainant or defendant, the President
retains the role of judge.
This is an extreme form of executive
privilege which invites abuse. Thus we favor
some form of impartial binding arbitration. A
simple and fair scheme would be the use of a
panel of three disinterested faculty members.
We are concerned that the rights'
statement now before the Senate is a
legalistic-ally clever defense of administrative
authority. It contains statements and
procedures which impair rather than protect
academic freedom. Especially vulnerable to
the restrictive elements of the proposal are
the nontenured junior faculty and the
growing not-to-be-tenured adjunct
professoriate.
