# Theme Associates' At Junipero
## 
### 
Don Lum

Junipero, the Asian-American
theme house, is going ahead with
its plans for a theme associates
program this coming fall, 1974.
Recently approved by the Dean of
Student Affairs Office, the
program hopes to attract students
who an actively concerned with
the house's theme — the
Asian-American experience.
Specifically, the plan provides
for six theme associate positions,
which will be filled by a
student-faculty committee.
Applications are now available
from either Barbara Yasui,
Junipero 210, 321-1086, or Don
Lum, Junipero 110, 321-1653.
The deadline for turning in
applications is April 19.
It should be stressed that being
a theme associate will not be the
same as being a student staff
member. As a theme associate, the
administrative and counseling
responsibilities will be minimal or
non-existent.
Theme associates will be
students living in the dorm who
would 1) provide continuity in
theme-related programs, 2) serve
as catalysts in initiating and
planning new/more theme
programs, and 3) act as resource
people for students who are
interested in getting more

information about
Asian-American activities outside
the dorm.
Associate's Duties
The theme associate's chief
responsibility will be to plan,
implement, and share his/her ideas
about the Asian-American
experience with other people in
the house. In return for providing
initiative and support for
theme-related programs and
activities in the house, the theme
associate would be guaranteed a
place in Junipero for 1974-75.
The Dean of Student Affairs
Office has requested that
applicants be aware of the
following conditions relating to
theme associate positions in
Junipero:
1) All conditions of housing
assignment, including penalties for
dropping out of the residence
system, apply to theme associates
in the same manner as to other
students.
2) Theme associates must sign
a residence agreement for one
year's occupancy in the residence
system.
3) Theme associates will
receive no compensation.
4) Theme associates will not be
given any special room priorities,
except for those which they may

be previously entitled to.
Basic Qualifications
The qualifications for theme
associates are basic. The applicant
should be a Stanford student,
undergraduate or graduate, Asian
or non-Asian, of at least
sophomore standing. Secondly,
applicants should demonstrate
interest — previous and present —
in Asian-American programs.
Obviously, the commitment we

are looking for is much greater
than the compensation, but we
hope that the reason you are
applying in the first place is
because you are willing to make
that commitment.
If you have any questions
regarding the position of theme
associate in Junipero, please feel
free to contact Barbara or Don.
(Don Lum is an undergraduate
majoring in human biology.)
