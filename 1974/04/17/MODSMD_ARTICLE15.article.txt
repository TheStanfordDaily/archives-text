# RA-TA Salaries

Stanford must be very happy
that its big fund-raising campaign
has made $150 million in two
years, ahead of schedule in many
areas.
But as a research assistan..
making my $61.11 per week,,it
makes me mad.
Not that I'm doing so badly,
relatively speaking. I'm told that
the usual salary for RA's and TA's
at Stanford is $51.11 a week. But
the thought of those million 6
going for endowed professorships
and buildings while we struggle to
make ends meet makes my blood
boil.
Equally irritating is the
knowledge that departments like
my own, which support most of
their graduate students or
government or other outside
money, are pressured by the
University not to ask these
sources for a living wage for their
RA's, on the grounds that it
would make the University-wide
RA pay scale unequal. Thanks,
Dr. Carlsmith.
Antithetical Values
I know that some faculty
members are a little hurt by some
students' efforts to form an RA
and TA union. It does seem
somewhat antithetical to the
values of a university tha +
graduate students should consider
themselves employees instead of
co-pioneers on the frontier of
knowlege, albeit in an apprentice
l status.
All right, let's look at the
situation from a perspective that
does not call graduate students
oppressed workers but partners in
the knowledge-producing process.
In Little Science, Big Science,
Derek J. de Solla Price points out
that "the total number of
scientists goes up as the square,
more or less, of the number o f
good ones." He further notes that
the growth rate of the scientific
population cannot continue.
Change Needed
If we are to continue to
produce scientific insights at a
good rate, then, we are going to.
have to change the ratio ot
scientists to good scientists.
There is a reputable
psychological study which has
established that in most fields
most people produce their best
work at a median age of 28.
I'm 28, so why ain't I rich, or
at least published? Well, consider
what I'm doing when I'm not
writing angry pieces for the Daily,
in class, or booking. I'm fixing the
car I can't afford to have fixed,
hassling the library for the book I
can't afford to buy, not going toi
the play I can't afford, ano
exercising as much self-discipline
as I can to keep from freaking
out.
Time Is Money
Well, poor me. But seriously,
time is money. Without money,
you have less time to think, les. c
chance to buy a book on a
creative impulse, less ability to go
on a high-protein diet to fight the
tendency to hypoglycemia fed by
the University's coffee machines.
Looking at myself as a
specimen, I see that the
institutional forces on me are
quite possibly affecting my
productivity. I see that the system
may produce people of the will to
survive this period of
apprenticeship, but that this will
may not be related to the qualities
necessary to produce scientific
progress.
Higher Salary Needed
In the interests of the pursuit
of knowledge, then, all "workers
of the world, unite" rhetoric aside,
RAs and TAs should do better
than $51.11 a week.
But will they do better? Not
bloody likely. We hear about the
University's "steady state" at
present. We are in a
counterrevolution of declining
expectations. This is a time to
keep a low profile, to not follow
leaders and watch our parking
meters.
There probably won't be a TA
Union. People already pressed for
time and money are the least
likely to have the resources to
organize a movement. And the
double control of academic and
economic sanctions is powerful
indeed. Graduate students,
recipients of very specialized
knowledge and career
motivations, know that their
intended career is not easily
interchangible with another.
But if the University is so
concerned with matters othei
than how we make out, even if in
thirty years the beautiful new
buildings are filled with highly
self-disciplined incompetents, it
could at least have the good grace
not to spread the tales of its
welath under our noses on the
front pages of the Daily.
