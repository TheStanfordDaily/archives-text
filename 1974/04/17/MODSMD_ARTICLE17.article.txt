## NBA (Yawn) Predictions 
### Don Tollefson 
If you left the country in recent weeks to escape
the taxman, you may have missed the beginning of
the NBA Playoffs. But don't worry, you can stay
away for quite a few more weeks and they'll
probably still be going on when you get back. At
the rate things are going, the champions will
probably be crowned two days before the next
NBA "regular" season begins.
A few years ago, promoters discovered that
ticket prices for playoff games can always be
increased and that the networks love televising
playoff games nationally, so they concocted a
round of playoffs that seem almost as long as the
"regular" season. Just like players' salaries and new
franchises, the number of playoff games has
skyrocketed and determining the national
championship can now take as many as 49 games.
Whoopee!
The way things are going in most pro sports,
"regular" season games will soon become part of
the exhibition schedule and the "playoffs" will
account for 90 percent of all games. The NBA
champ will have to survive eight playoff rounds and
as all tickets become astronomically expensive, the
only people who will be able to afford them will be
the players and their lawyers.
One effect of all this is that the playoffs are so
drawn out that they have lost much of their drama.
How excited can you get when your favorite team
narrowly wins a playoff game and moves within 13
games of the final round? Oversaturation is the new
name of the game.
Four Contenders
Still, sometime before the World Series begins,
an NBA champ will be crowned and believe it or
not, the field has now been narrowed to four
contenders.
The Lakers, who made it into the playoffs on
the benevolence of the Warriors, have now joined
the locals on the sidelines after being quickly
humiliated by the Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks are
still led by the often awesome play of a guy named
Kareen Abdul-Jabbar, whom the history books tell
us preceded the Walton Gang at UCLA.
Any team with Jabbar has the potential to win
the title, but I am still a bit unsure of how they'd
do in the finals, although I think they'll have a
fairly easy time disposing of Chicago in the semis.

Chicago center Clifford Ray was vigorously praised
for his play in the Bulls' series-winning victory over
Detroit Saturday, but I'm afraid he is a bit out of
his class when he confronts Jabbar.
Battling Bulls
The Bucks should beat the Bulls, but in the
process, they themselves may get beaten up. A few
weeks ago in a televised game, Milwaukee easily
defeated Chicago, but not before Jabbar had been
sent reeling by a punch from the hand of reserve
Bull center Dennis Awtrey.
Unfortunately, Awtrey's right hand is the source
of almost all the offensive prowess he has and with
guard Jerry Sloan a doubtful participant due to a
foot injury, the Bulls are in trouble. I look for
Milwaukee to win in five.
The Eastern Division semifinals should be
considerably more even as the revitalized Boston
Celtics attempt to eliminate the defending
champion New York Knicks before the finals.
Boston won convincingly in the series opener on
Sunday and unless the Knicks discover some energy
they lacked in the first game, they may find
another championship eluding them for at least one
year and probably more, since the old trooper,
Dave Deßusschere, is retiring at the end of this
season.
Boston Picked
John Havlicek is healthy again and with wild
man Dave Cowens in the middle, the Celtics are
again realizing the form they had when they
accounted for one of the classic athletic dynasties
of all time.
Now that you've gone out and wisely bet against
my choices, I'll make my final prediction before
settling down for endless hours of TV basketball. In
the finals, Boston should win in seven.
If Jabbar and some of his moody cohorts play
their best, the outcome could be much different.
Milwaukee has an awful lot of talent, but at times it
seems as unfocused and uncontrolled as it is
unlimited. Somehow the hustle and teamwork of
the Celtics seems like a safe bet.
But it doesn't really matter if every one of my
picks is wrong, because by the time the playoffs
end, my predictions of today will be forgotten in
the excitement surrounding my World Series picks.

Milwaukee to win in five.
The Eastern Division semifinals should be
considerably more even as the revitalized Boston
Celtics attempt to eliminate the defending
champion New York Knicks before the finals.
Boston won convincingly in the series opener on
Sunday and unless the Knicks discover some energy
they lacked in the first game, they may find
another championship eluding them for at least one
year and probably more, since the old trooper,
Dave Deßusschere, is retiring at the end of this
season.
Boston Picked
John Havlicek is healthy again and with wild
man Dave Cowens in the middle, the Celtics are
again realizing the form they had when they
accounted for one of the classic athletic dynasties
of all time.
Now that you've gone out and wisely bet against
my choices, I'll make my final prediction before
settling down for endless hours of TV basketball. In
the finals, Boston should win in seven.
If Jabbar and some of his moody cohorts play
their best, the outcome could be much different.
Milwaukee has an awful lot of talent, but at times it
seems as unfocused and uncontrolled as it is
unlimited. Somehow the hustle and teamwork of
the Celtics seems like a safe bet.
But it doesn't really matter if every one of my
picks is wrong, because by the time the playoffs
end, my predictions of today will be forgotten in
the excitement surrounding my World Series picks.
If you left the country in recent weeks to escape
the taxman, you may have missed the beginning of
the NBA Playoffs. But don't worry, you can stay
away for quite a few more weeks and they'll
probably still be going on when you get back. At
the rate things are going, the champions will
probably be crowned two days before the next
NBA "regular" season begins.
A few years ago, promoters discovered that
ticket prices for playoff games can always be
increased and that the networks love televising
playoff games nationally, so they concocted a
round of playoffs that seem almost as long as the
"regular" season. Just like players' salaries and new
franchises, the number of playoff games has
skyrocketed and determining the national
championship can now take as many as 49 games.
Whoopee!
The way things are going in most pro sports,
"regular" season games will soon become part of
the exhibition schedule and the "playoffs" will
account for 90 percent of all games. The NBA
champ will have to survive eight playoff rounds and
as all tickets become astronomically expensive, the
only people who will be able to afford them will be
the players and their lawyers.
One effect of all this is that the playoffs are so
drawn out that they have lost much of their drama.
How excited can you get when your favorite team
narrowly wins a playoff game and moves within 13
games of the final round? Oversaturation is the new
name of the game.
Four Contenders
Still, sometime before the World Series begins,
an NBA champ will be crowned and believe it or
not, the field has now been narrowed to four
contenders.
The Lakers, who made it into the playoffs on
the benevolence of the Warriors, have now joined
the locals on the sidelines after being quickly
humiliated by the Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks are
still led by the often awesome play of a guy named
Kareen Abdul-Jabbar, whom the history books tell
us preceded the Walton Gang at UCLA.
Any team with Jabbar has the potential to win
the title, but I am still a bit unsure of how they'd
do in the finals, although I think they'll have a
fairly easy time disposing of Chicago in the semis.

Chicago center Clifford Ray was vigorously praised
for his play in the Bulls' series-winning victory over
Detroit Saturday, but I'm afraid he is a bit out of
his class when he confronts Jabbar.
Battling Bulls
The Bucks should beat the Bulls, but in the
process, they themselves may get beaten up. A few
weeks ago in a televised game, Milwaukee easily
defeated Chicago, but not before Jabbar had been
sent reeling by a punch from the hand of reserve
Bull center Dennis Awtrey.
Unfortunately, Awtrey's right hand is the source
of almost all the offensive prowess he has and with
guard Jerry Sloan a doubtful participant due to a
foot injury, the Bulls are in trouble. I look for
Milwaukee to win in five.
The Eastern Division semifinals should be

Celtics attempt to eliminate the defending
champion New York Knicks before the finals.
