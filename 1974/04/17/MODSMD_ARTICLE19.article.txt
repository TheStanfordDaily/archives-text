# Women Netters Seek Major Triumphs
## 
### CHRISTA BATTELLE 
Stanford's women's
tennis fields a team this year
described by one tennis magazine
as, "having as much success as its
men's team." The women's team
had a fine 8-0 season last year,
winning the Northern California
Intercollegiate Conference
(NCIAC).
The women's varsity will earn
every bit of praise it gets if it
manages to do well throughout its
heavy spring tournament
schedule. Besides numerous
matches with local schools, the
women's varsity team is looking
ahead to several major
tournaments. Among these are the
Ojai Tournament (April 25-28),
the Pac-8 Tournament, and the
National Collegiate Tournament.
Coach "Curley" Neal is
counting on returning varsity
players Andrea Barnes, Tracy
McNair, Terry Albert, Whitney
Grant, Chris Michel, Dani
Dall'Armi, Mariene Veach and
Anne Feeley to head the varsity.
In addition, freshmen Nancy
Anderson, Pat Delaney, Carolyn
Nichols, and Diane Liebenson will
figure strongly in this year's
lineup.

Neal said that ideally she'd like
to see more of a varsity-junior
varsity split of the large team.
Hopefully, the varsity players
would concentrate more on Pac-8
level competition.
"If we could get strong Pac-8
competition for our varsity
players," said Neal, "then we
could let our JV players play
NCIAC matches, and more people
would get to play."

Although confirmation of
funds for women's athletic
scholarships has not yet come
through, many high school
coaches have called Stanford
about their women tennis players.
Some of these girls have come to
visit the campus.
All have received letters
explaining the uncertain status of
women's athletic scholarships at
Stanford, and reminding

prospective women students that
they must meet admission
qualifications.
The women's varsity will have
about the same amount of funds
as last year. This will allow them
to fly to most of the major
tournaments on their schedule,
including the Ojai tournament.
Coach Neal explained that
because many of the local colleges
are on the semester system, they
are able to start working with

their varsity team much earlier in
the year than Stanford. Here,
most of the better women players
come out for tennis during spring
quarter.
This places Stanford at a
disadvantage when faced with a
tournament schedule that begins
at the start of the quarter.
The Stanford JV faced Cal
State-Hayward yesterday in a
practice meet, winning 6-0.
