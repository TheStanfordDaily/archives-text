# Chino Defendants Convicted

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Robert
Seabock was convicted of first-degree
murder yesterday and his codefendant
Jean Hobson of second-degree murder
in the death of a prison guard during a
1972 ambush in which a prisoner was
freed.
A Superior Court jury handed
down the verdict after deliberating
nine days.
Both were convicted in the
shooting death of a Chino correctional
officer who was transporting a
prisoner to a court appearance.
Hobson, 45, and Seabock, 22, both
of Palo Alto, had been charged with
first degree murder in the
ambush-style shooting of Chino prison
guard Jesus Sanchez, 24, on Oct. 6,
1972.
Ronald Wayne Beaty was being
transported to a San Bernardino court
for an appearance on charges of armed
robbery and escape when two cars
containing a total of five persons ran
the prison car off the road.
Guard Killed
Shots were fired, Sanchez was
killed and another guard, George
Fitzgerald, 36, was wounded and
Beaty, 35, was freed.
Two months later, Beaty was

recaptured in San Francisco. He
pleaded guilty to murder in Sanchez'
death and later testified for the
prosecution against Seabock and
Hobson in a courtroom made safe by
bulletproof glass enclosures. Beaty is
serving a life term.
Hobson and Seabock both
presented strong alibis for their
whereabouts at the time of the
ambush but Beaty testified he and
Hobson had planned the escape in
detail and he said "I seen Bob Seabock
with a gun pointing in the back of the
prison car firing ... I felt he emptied
the gun."
On July 18, 1973, Benton D. Burt,
30, of Hayward, and 18-year-old
Andrea Holman Burt, daughter of
Halsted R. Holman, Stanford professor
of medicine, were convicted of second
degree murder, assault with a deadly
weapon and assisting in Beaty's escape.
They were sentenced to prison for five

years to life. A fifth person, not yet
identified, was also believed to have
participated in the ambush.
Venue Change Granted
Because of the heavy publicity in
San Bernardino for that earlier trial,
San Bernardino Superior Court Judge
Thomas M. Haldorson granted a
change of venue to Los Angeles.
Judge Charles H. Stratton felt that
Beaty's life might be in danger because
of his testimony for the prosecution.
He ordered a series of alterations to
the courtroom including
floor-to-ceiling glass with steel
screening and electronic door locks. It
cost the county an estimated $50,000.
During the five-month trial, Beaty
testified he had met Hobson in the
summer of 1972 through the Maoist
political activist organization,
Venceremos. He said Seabock also
belonged to the group.

Ronald Wayne Beaty was being
transported to a San Bernardino court
for an appearance on charges of armed
robbery and escape when two cars
containing a total of five persons ran
the prison car off the road.
Guard Killed
Shots were fired, Sanchez was
killed and another guard, George
Fitzgerald, 36, was wounded and
Beaty, 35, was freed.
Two months later, Beaty was

recaptured in San Francisco. He
pleaded guilty to murder in Sanchez'
death and later testified for the
prosecution against Seabock and
Hobson in a courtroom made safe by
bulletproof glass enclosures. Beaty is
serving a life term.
Hobson and Seabock both
presented strong alibis for their
whereabouts at the time of the
ambush but Beaty testified he and
Hobson had planned the escape in
detail and he said "I seen Bob Seabock
with a gun pointing in the back of the
prison car firing ... I felt he emptied
the gun."
On July 18, 1973, Benton D. Burt,
30, of Hayward, and 18-year-old
Andrea Holman Burt, daughter of
Halsted R. Holman, Stanford professor
of medicine, were convicted of second
degree murder, assault with a deadly
weapon and assisting in Beaty's escape.
They were sentenced to prison for five

years to life. A fifth person, not yet
identified, was also believed to have
participated in the ambush.
Venue Change Granted
Because of the heavy publicity in
San Bernardino for that earlier trial,
San Bernardino Superior Court Judge
Thomas M. Haldorson granted a
change of venue to Los Angeles.
Judge Charles H. Stratton felt that
Beaty's life might be in danger because
of his testimony for the prosecution.
He ordered a series of alterations to
the courtroom including
floor-to-ceiling glass with steel
screening and electronic door locks. It
cost the county an estimated $50,000.
During the five-month trial, Beaty
testified he had met Hobson in the
summer of 1972 through the Maoist
political activist organization,
Venceremos. He said Seabock also
belonged to the group.
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Robert
Seabock was convicted of first-degree
murder yesterday and his codefendant
Jean Hobson of second-degree murder
in the death of a prison guard during a
