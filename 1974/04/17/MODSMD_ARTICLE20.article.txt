# Tennis Team Rolls Over SJS, 7-2
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford tennis coach Dick
Gould once again unleashed his
ocean of depth yesterday, and
beat San Jose State 7-2 despite
not using any of his top six singles
players.
The match, played at home,
was highlighted by the return to
form of Chico Hagey, who broke
a three-match losing streak with
an impressive 6-0, 6-3 triumph
over the Spartans' top player,
Andy Moffat.
Chip Fisher, also trying to
emerge from a slump, sandwiched
two well-played sets around an

indifferent one, and won 6-2, 3-6,
6-2, over Bob Hansen.
The list of singles winners
continues with Paul Sidone, who
dropped Terry Eodgers by a 6-4,
6-3 score, and Craig Johnson, who
downed Joe Meyers 6-3, 6-2.
At the final slots, Tim Noonan
embarrassed Bruce Antal, 6-1, 6-1,
while Jake Warde beat Tony
Yvanovich 7-6, 6-3, completing
the singles sweep.
One of the two losses came
unexpectedly from the varsity
third team of Mark Mitchell-Nick
Saviano. With the match already
clinched, Mitch and Sav were
beaten by Moffat-Meyers, 6-3,
3-6, 7-6.
At second doubles Tim
Noonan-Jake Warde topped

Hansen-Rodgers, 6-3, 6-7, 6-1. At
third doubles, the normal junior
varsity team of Bill Koran-Glenn
Golden certainly didn't embarrass
themselves, bowing to
Antal-Yvanovich 6-4, 6-4.

Tennis Talk: The Sports Face
carpet was put down in Maples
Pavilion for the second time
yesterday, and this time it'll stay
there through this weekend's big
matches. Sandy Mayer, away
during the court's trial run last
quarter, tried the surface for the
first time yesterday and gave his
approval.
Mayer's singles match, along
with Delaney's and the pair's
doubles match, will be played
indoors on Friday night against

USC, beginning at 6:30 p.m.
Gould would like to allow other
players a chance to play in Maples
Saturday night, but that will be
dependent on the approval of
UCLA coach Glenn Bassett,
whose team will get only a scanty
chance to practice in Maples.
Tickets for both the indoor
and outdoor matches remain.
Reserved seats are priced at $2,
non-reserve seats at $1 and
student-faculty-staff tickets
(non-reserved) at 50 cents. For
the outdoor matches, the
non-reserved tickets may sell out
when they're placed on sale
Friday and Saturday mornings at
the gate. Almost half Maples'Booo
seats remain unsold for the indoor

matches.
Stanford tennis coach Dick
Gould once again unleashed his
ocean of depth yesterday, and
beat San Jose State 7-2 despite
not using any of his top six singles
players.
The match, played at home,
was highlighted by the return to
form of Chico Hagey, who broke
a three-match losing streak with
an impressive 6-0, 6-3 triumph
over the Spartans' top player,
Andy Moffat.
Chip Fisher, also trying to
emerge from a slump, sandwiched
two well-played sets around an

indifferent one, and won 6-2, 3-6,
6-2, over Bob Hansen.
The list of singles winners
continues with Paul Sidone, who
dropped Terry Eodgers by a 6-4,
6-3 score, and Craig Johnson, who
downed Joe Meyers 6-3, 6-2.
At the final slots, Tim Noonan
embarrassed Bruce Antal, 6-1, 6-1,
while Jake Warde beat Tony
Yvanovich 7-6, 6-3, completing
the singles sweep.
One of the two losses came
unexpectedly from the varsity
third team of Mark Mitchell-Nick
Saviano. With the match already
clinched, Mitch and Sav were
beaten by Moffat-Meyers, 6-3,
3-6, 7-6.
At second doubles Tim
Noonan-Jake Warde topped

Hansen-Rodgers, 6-3, 6-7, 6-1. At
third doubles, the normal junior
varsity team of Bill Koran-Glenn
Golden certainly didn't embarrass
themselves, bowing to
Antal-Yvanovich 6-4, 6-4.

Tennis Talk: The Sports Face
carpet was put down in Maples
Pavilion for the second time
yesterday, and this time it'll stay
there through this weekend's big
matches. Sandy Mayer, away
during the court's trial run last
quarter, tried the surface for the
first time yesterday and gave his
approval.
Mayer's singles match, along
with Delaney's and the pair's
doubles match, will be played
indoors on Friday night against

USC, beginning at 6:30 p.m.
Gould would like to allow other
players a chance to play in Maples
Saturday night, but that will be
dependent on the approval of
UCLA coach Glenn Bassett,
whose team will get only a scanty
chance to practice in Maples.
Tickets for both the indoor
and outdoor matches remain.
Reserved seats are priced at $2,
non-reserve seats at $1 and
student-faculty-staff tickets
(non-reserved) at 50 cents. For
the outdoor matches, the
non-reserved tickets may sell out
when they're placed on sale
Friday and Saturday mornings at
the gate. Almost half Maples'Booo
seats remain unsold for the indoor
matches.
