GOP Loses Seat In Michigan
SAGINAW, Mich. — Riding a tide of urban votes,
Democrat Bob Traxler captured Michigan's special
congressional election yesterday night, defeating a
Republican for whom President Nixon campaigned.
Traxler's victory, the fourth by a Democrat this
year in five elections for previously Republican
seats, ended a 42-year GOP hold on Michigan's Bth
District and cost Republicans their second district in
the state this year.
A heavy majority for the 42-year-old Traxler in
his Bay City home and a smaller margin in the city
of Saginaw enabled him to withstand a surge for
Republican James Sparling Jr. in the Saginaw
suburbs and the district's rural areas.
"From all indications," Sparling told applauding
supporters, "Mr. Traxler has won."
Returns from 290 of the district's 296 precincts
gave Traxler 58,730, Sparling 55,609, indicating a
turnout of more than 53 percent, considered big for
a special election.
Acknowledging victory while his supporters
chanted, "Nixon Must Go," Traxler said his victory
means "more good people will be elected in
November with the idea of throwing the rascals out
and giving good government to the people."
The Democratic candidate had campaigned as
much against Nixon as against Sparling, calling the
contest "a referendum on Nixon's policies and
moral leadership."
Jaworski Requests Subpoena
WASHINGTON — Special Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski asked federal court yesterday to issue a
subpoena for tape recordings of 63 presidential
conversations, saying the White House has ignored
his repeated requests.
He told the court the tapes and written material
about the conversations are needed in the coming
Watergate cover-up trial.
Jaworski filed a motion with U.S. District Judge
John J. Sirica saying he has received no definitive
response to his requests and"I ... feel obligated to
seek these materials by subpoena."
At Key Biscayne, Fla., a White House spokesman
said there would be no comment until the legal
paper had been reviewed.
Many, but not all, the conversations already have
been subpoenaed by the House Judiciary
Committee for its impeachment inquiry. That
subpoena is returnable on April 25th. The White
House said it will let the committee know what it
will supply soon after Congress' Easter recess ends
on April 22.
Jaworski asked that the subpoena cover
conversations on 27 specific days, beginning June
20, 1972 — three days after the Watergate break-in

— through June 4, 1973, a day when President
Nixon listened to some key tapes.
Most of the conversations were face-to-face or by
telephone either with H.R. Haldeman and John D.
Ehrlichman, Nixon's principal assistants and two of
the seven men charged with conspiring to obstruct
justice in the Watergate cover-up.
Some also were with Charles W. Colson, another
top White House aide who is among those indicted.
Remiro, Little Plead Innocent
OAKLAND — Two alleged Symbionese
Liberation Army "soldiers" pleaded innocent
yesterday to the ambush murder of Oakland school
Supt. Marcus Foster last Nov. 6.
Joseph Remiro, 27, and Russell Little, 24, also
pleaded innocent to the attempted murder of
Foster's aide, Robert Blackburn, in the same burst
of cyanide bullets outside the city's school
administration building.
The two men have been called SLA "soldiers" in
communiques issued by the terrorist group which
claimed responsibility for slaying Foster and
kidnaping newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst from
her Berkeley apartment Feb. 4.
Mitchell Reveals Vesco Memo
NEW YORK — Former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell testified yesterday that he pigeon-holed a
memorandum by financier Robert L. Vesco which
was intended for the White House. He called the
memo "a crude attempt to use muscle."
Mitchell's two days under cross-examination
concluded his defense and his lawyer rested the
case. Still to be completed is the defense of
Mitchell's codefendant, former Commerce Secretary
Maurice Stans.
They are charged with conspiracy, obstruction of
justice and perjury.
"Did you consider this an effort to obstruct
justice?" Mitchell was asked.
"No, I did not," he replied.
"You had been the top law enforcement officer
in the country?"
"Yes," he agreed.
"But you didn't think it Was relevant to let Mr.
Casey know what was going on here?" asked Asst.
U.S. Atty. John Wing, referring to William Casey,
the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman
at the time.
Court Upholds Firing Criteria
WASHINGTON — The federal government has a
right to dismiss Civil Service employees whose
public comments impair the efficiency of the
agencies they work for, the Supreme Court held
Tuesday.

The 6-3 decision upheld the language of the
Lloyd-LaFollette Act which permits dismissal "for
such cause as will promote the efficiency of the
service."
The court said its decision would not prevent
speech that was constitutionally protected. Instead,
Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote, the act
prohibits "only that public speech which
improperly damages and impairs the reputation and
efficiency of the employing agency, and it thus
imposes no greater control on the behavior of
federal employees than are necessary for the
protection of the government as an employer."
The act's language was attacked by dissenting
justices as overly broad, thus having a "chilling
effect" on the exercise of free speech.
Simon To Assume Treasury Post
WASHINGTON — President Nixon is expected to
announce today the appointment of energy chief
William E. Simon to be secretary of the treasury,
and of Simon's deputy, John C. Sawhill, to the top
energy job, administration sources said yesterday.
Simon kept his position as deputy treasury
secretary when he was placed in charge of the new
Federal Energy Office last December; his
appointment to succeed Treasury Secretary George
Shultz has been widely anticipated ever since Shultz
announced his forthcoming resignation.
