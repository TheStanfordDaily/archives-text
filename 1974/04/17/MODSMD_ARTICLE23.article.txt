# Court Supports Gould In Detroit Edison Suit
## 
### DON COX 
An Ohio federal appellate court
yesterday refused to halt the major
non-monetary provisions of a civil
rights suit charging discriminatory
hiring practices brought against the
Detroit Edison Co. by Law Prof.
William Gould.
Gould said he was "elated" at the
appellate decision and said it gave
black workers a key victory in their
fight to end discriminatory practices.
Gould brought suit against the
company and the Utility Workers of
America Local 223 on behalf of black
minority workers.
The suit resulted in an
unprecedented judgement of $4
million against the company,
$250,000 against the union and
non-monetary provisions which
included goals and timetables for the
hiring of black workers.
Reason For Refusal
The appeals court refused to stay
the non-monetary provisions of the
judgement because Detroit Edison had
"failed to establish it would be
irreparably harmed ... or that there is
a strong likelihood it will prevail on
the merits" of the issues.
While the company could appeal
the appellate decision not to stay the
non-monetary provisions, Gould said
"it would be very rare indeed" for it
to reverse the circuit appeals court on
an issue of this kind.
The monetary parts of the original
judgement were stayed by the district
court pending appeal. Gould said the
company would probably appeal the
monetary provisions all the way to the
Supreme Court.
Key Provisions
Among the key non-monetary
provisions that will go into effect
immediately if the Supreme Court
does not intervene are:
— goals and timetables for the
hiring of black applicants. Three
blacks are to be hired for every two
whites in skilled trade positions and
one black per white in supervisory
jobs.
— transfer of seniority rights for
blacks previously locked into low level

jobs who transfer to skilled positions
within the company.
— discontinuance of unlawful
testing used in the past to determine
job placement and promotion.
— the immediate creation of a court
advisory committee composed of the
Association for the Betterment of
Black Edison Employees, the
defendants in the suit and the
government.
Gould said the last provision was
the "most important" in that it
requires the committee to try to
resolve disputes before going to court
and forces the company and the union
to provide blacks with information on
hiring and promotion practices.
Monetary damages, if won by the
plaintiffs, will include interest accrued
on the punitive damages, back pay,
attorney's fees and related expenses
incurred since the initial verdict.

hiring and promotion practices.
Monetary damages, if won by the
plaintiffs, will include interest accrued
on the punitive damages, back pay,
attorney's fees and related expenses
incurred since the initial verdict.
An Ohio federal appellate court
yesterday refused to halt the major
non-monetary provisions of a civil
rights suit charging discriminatory
hiring practices brought against the
Detroit Edison Co. by Law Prof.
William Gould.
Gould said he was "elated" at the
appellate decision and said it gave
black workers a key victory in their
fight to end discriminatory practices.
Gould brought suit against the
company and the Utility Workers of
America Local 223 on behalf of black
minority workers.
The suit resulted in an
unprecedented judgement of $4
million against the company,
$250,000 against the union and
non-monetary provisions which
included goals and timetables for the
hiring of black workers.
Reason For Refusal
The appeals court refused to stay
the non-monetary provisions of the
judgement because Detroit Edison had
"failed to establish it would be
irreparably harmed ... or that there is
a strong likelihood it will prevail on
the merits" of the issues.
While the company could appeal
the appellate decision not to stay the
non-monetary provisions, Gould said
"it would be very rare indeed" for it
to reverse the circuit appeals court on
an issue of this kind.
The monetary parts of the original
judgement were stayed by the district
court pending appeal. Gould said the
company would probably appeal the
monetary provisions all the way to the
Supreme Court.
Key Provisions
Among the key non-monetary
provisions that will go into effect
immediately if the Supreme Court
does not intervene are:
— goals and timetables for the
hiring of black applicants. Three
blacks are to be hired for every two
whites in skilled trade positions and
one black per white in supervisory
jobs.
— transfer of seniority rights for
blacks previously locked into low level

jobs who transfer to skilled positions
within the company.
— discontinuance of unlawful
testing used in the past to determine
job placement and promotion.
— the immediate creation of a court
advisory committee composed of the
Association for the Betterment of
Black Edison Employees, the
defendants in the suit and the
government.
Gould said the last provision was
the "most important" in that it
requires the committee to try to
resolve disputes before going to court
and forces the company and the union
to provide blacks with information on
hiring and promotion practices.
Monetary damages, if won by the
plaintiffs, will include interest accrued
on the punitive damages, back pay,
attorney's fees and related expenses
incurred since the initial verdict.
