# Carvings Stolen From Museum
## 
### 
Some 12 intricately carved ivory
ornaments, valued in excess of $1200,
were stolen from the Stanford
museum yesterday.
The small Japanese antiques,
known as netsukes, were discovered
missing from a sealed plexiglass case
yesterday afternoon by museum
officials.
They indicated the theft took place
between 1:30 and 2:45 yesterday
afternoon. A museum spokesman said
the case was "cleanly broken." No one
heard or saw the break-in.
Museum officials indicated the
ornaments, meant to function as small
pockets on Japanese kimonos, would
be hard to trace. "There are hundreds
of them in the Bay Area, which is why
it's so hard to track them down," one
official told the Daily.
"They're very tiny. You could put
one in the palm of your hand and
conceal it. They're about the size of a
small plum," an official said.
The netsukes were crafted during
the 19th century.
Museum officials indicated they
had no idea who might have stolen the
ornaments, although they claimed
their absence was noticed "almost
immediately."
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office was investigating the crime
yesterday, but apparently had no real
leads.
