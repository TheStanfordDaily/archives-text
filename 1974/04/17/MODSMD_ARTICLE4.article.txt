# McCloskey Backs Thai Resolution
## ASSU Elections Today 
### DENIS CUFF 
Students will vote today and
tomorrow to elect either the Mike
Herman or 800 Bacon slates as the new
ASSU Council of Presidents.
Students will also vote on three
purposed ASSU Constitutional
changes, six fee assessments and a
resolution inviting imprisoned South
Vietnamese journalist Nguyen Huu
Thai to serve as ASSU guest professor.
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,
R-Menlo Park, yesterday endorsed the
efforts of Amnesty International and
the Stanford campaign to pass the
resolution.
Expressing his hope that efforts to
obtain visa authority for Thai would
be successful, McCloskey said, "I will

be glad to try to obtain both
congressional and State Department
assistance should the Stanford
invitation be tendered."
Supporters of the resolution have
said its purpose is to bring political
pressure on the State Department and
the South Vietnamese government to
release Thai.
The polling sites at the Engineering
Corner and the Post Office will be
open today and tomorrow from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. The sites at the History
Corner, Physics Tank, and the Business
and Medical Schools will be open both
days from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Slates Differ
The Herman and Bacon slates
appear to differ from each other in
their emphasis on student services and
programs for social change.
Both slates have said they're
interested in student services, but the
Herman ticket emphasizes this area
more than Bacon's group. Herman's
slate has purposed the establishment
of a student store and a lecture note
series available to students who
purchase it.
The Bacon slate has said it will
work on student services, but
stresses programs for social and
educational change. They have voiced
their support for SWOPSI, SCIRE, and
the Public Interest Research Group
(PIRG).
The Candidates
The ticket headed by Bacon,
member of the ASSU Committee on
Public Events, editor of the Real News
and ASSU Senate alternate, includes
Chris Baron, director of the Prison
Information Center and chairman of
the SWOPSI board; Maria Echaveste,
ASSU senator and co-chairman of
MEChA; and Jack Handy, chairman of
the Stanford chapter of the Northern
California PIRG and former ASSU
assistant elections commissioner.

In addition to Mike Herman,
two-year ASSU senator and member
of the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies and former member of the
ASSU Nominations Committee, the
ticket includes Ann Carter, financial
manager of the ASSU Course Review
and Senate alternate; Len Mackey,
second year law student serving as a
senator; and Quinn Mayer, ASSU
senator, member of the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids and of the
subcommittee of the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement.
Fee Assessments
The six fee assessments on the
ballot are:
— $1 for the Stanford chapter of
PIRG, a Nader-type organization
created to research social and political
issues like consumer advocacy and
racial discrimination.
— $1 for the ASSU guest
professorship program intended to
bring social and political figures to
teach on campus at the ASSU's
invitation. Supporters of this program
have said the general ASSU funds
which supported this program in the
past no longer exist.
— $1 for the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, an organization to bring
prominent social and political figures
to speak here.
— $2 for KZSU, $1 for autumn and
$1 for spring quarter.
— $1 for the ASSU Legal
Counseling Office, $1 for next autumn
and $1 for spring quarter. This
organization offers free legal advice to
students here.
— $1 for the Stanford Band.
Constitutional Amendments
If the three purposed constitutional
amendments pass, they will change the
election dates of the Council and
ASSU Senate and establish a way to
remove members of the Nominations
Committee.
The Senate election date would
change from the fall to spring. The
Council election would occur a week
later than it presently does in spring
quarter.
The ASSU Senate, upon request of
the Nominations Committee, would
remove negligent members of that
committee.
