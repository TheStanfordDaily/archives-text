# Hearst Family Returns; FBI Seeks SLA's Cinque
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Editor Randolph A. Hearst
returned to the Bay Area from Mexico
yesterday and declared that his
daughter's participation in Monday's
San Francisco bank robbery "is one of
the most vicious things I've ever seen
or had happen to me."
Hearst and his wife returned
abruptly from their La Paz, Mexico,
vacation spot when word of the
robbery reached them Monday.
Meanwhile, the FBI announced in
San Francisco that Donald DeFreeze,
the escaped convict identified as
"General Field Marshal Cinque" of the
Symbionese Liberation Army, has

been identified as one of the men who
took part in the robbery.
DeFreeze is being sought on a
federal warrant charging him with
participating in the robbery. Bail was
set for him at $500,000.
Warrants Issued
Named in warrants issued Monday
were:
— Nancy Ling Perry, 27, daughter
of a Santa Rosa, Calif, merchant and
the self-styled "Fahizah" who has
previously communicated with the
press;
— Patricia Michelle (Mizmoon)
Soltysik, 24, another previously
named SLA member;

— and Camilla Christine Hall, 29, a
former social worker and close friend
of Soltysik.
Bail for the three was set at
$500,000 each.
Further Warrants
U.S. Atty. James L. Browning Jr.
told the Daily yesterday that he
"couldn't comment" on whether
further warrants would be sought
imminently. Police reports say nine
commandos took part in the lightning
raid that left two passersby wounded.
The robbery, at the Hibernia Bank
branch in San Francisco's Sunset
district, netted over $10,000. Cameras
in the bank took some 1200 photos of
the holdup, and FBI agents later
identified Patricia Hearst as one of the
commandos.
"We are discussing the possibility
very thoroughly that this was a staged
job to show off Patty Hearst as a
member of their [the SLA's] ranks,"
San Francisco Police Capt. Mortimer
Mclnerney said yesterday.
Other Robbers
Some of the photos appear to show
other robbers with guns trained on
Hearst.
Randolph Hearst told reporters
yesterday that he has "no idea"
whether Patricia's cooperation with
the robbers was voluntary. Patricia is
being sought on a federal warrant as a
"material witness."
Her father, president and editor of
the San Francisco Examiner, said:
"Sixty days ago, she was a lovely
child; 60 days later, a picture of her in
a bank robbery."
'Patricia Is Sick'
Steven Weed, 26, Patricia's fiance,
told reporters he believes that Patricia
"is sick. She is exhausted and she is
being humiliated at the hands of a
group of people that are determined
not to let her get out of this alive.
"She has lost a lot of weight. She
looks like she can hardly hold the gun
she is carrying," he said.
He added, "I quite obviously feel
kind of crushed by this . .
Why Hibernia Bank?
There was still no indication from
authorities yesterday as to why the
Hibernia Bank might have been
chosen. The bank is controlled by the
Tobin family of San Francisco, which
also controls part of the San Francisco
Chronicle and has close social ties to
the Hearsts.
(A Daily article yesterday quoted
Michael Tobin of San Francisco
without identifying him as senior vice
president of the Hibernia Bank. The
identification was omitted through an
editing error.)
Peter Markoff, 59, and Eugene
Brannan, 70, were reported in
"satisfactory" condition last night at
San Francisco General Hospital after
suffering gunshot wounds during the
robbery Monday. Both had originally
been admitted in "serious" condition.
