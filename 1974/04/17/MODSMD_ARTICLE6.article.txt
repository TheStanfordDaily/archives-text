# Campus Radio Interference Controversy
## Position Of Foothill Station Staff Unclear 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Nearly two months after the
Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) denial of a power increase for
KZSU, the radio station still faces a
long series of negotiations with
neighboring station KFJC before any
power increase can be approved.
KFJC, Foothill College's campus
station, successfully blocked the
KZSU power hike from 10 to 500
watts by claiming that inter-station
interference would cut out significant
areas of its coverage.
The FCC concurred and turned
down KZSU's request in February.
A KFJC source last month
suggested that the station would soon
advance a set of demands to KZSU in
exchange for removal of their
objection.
The source, highly-placed in the
KFJC staff, told the Daily in early
March that the station would demand
a change back to KZSU's former loose
progressive format and also the
resignations of then-KZSU Business
Manager Lloyd Snook, Chief Engineer
Mark Lawrence and Program Director
Francis Dickerson.
However, no KFJC management
personnel would confirm those reports
for the Daily.
Former KFJC Asst. Station
Manager Ted Brooks denied that KFJC
had officially contacted or had
planned to contact KZSU management
to offer them any such demands.
Brooks attributed the rumors to
"loose talk around the station
[KFJCI."

Nor nad any of the three principal
KZSU figures involved — Snook,
Lawrence or Dickerson — been
contacted about the alleged KFJC
demands.
The reports gained credence two
weeks ago when an open letter to the
KZSU management, supposedly
written and signed by KFJC Station
Manager Keith Garvey, accused Snook
and Lawrence of "presumptuous and
rude arrogance."
He said it would be "preposterous"
and highly unethical for KFJC to
demand any personnel or format

changes at KZSU in exchange for
removal of his station's objection.
Garvey added that he was unsure
who had actually written and signed
the letter.
The letter, written on KFJC
stationery and printed on the Daily
opinions page April 4, asserted that
"the attitudes of KZSU's management
was the deciding factor" in KFJC's
decision to file its objection to the
KZSU increase.
"At this date, it is not our
contention that KZSU will never be
permitted to amplify its

signal .... However, we refuse to deal
with the likes of Messrs. Lawrence and
Snook," the letter stated.
"Further, we believe that an
amplification of KZSU's signal at a
time when a top-40-request format is
in effect would constitute a disservice
to the education al-FM radio
audience."
Garvey last week flatly denied
composing, signing or even seeing the
letter before it was mailed. "I didn't
write it. I didn't sign it. And it
certainly doesn't represent a pressing,
burning issue at KFJC," he told the
Daily Thursday.

Early last week Brooks accused
KFJC Chief Engineer Doug McCasland
and news staffer David Moskowitz of
drafting the letter "to cause trouble."
McCasland was asked to resign as chief
engineer Tuesday, but was reinstated
Wednesday after a meeting of the
entire KFJC staff and the station's
faculty sponsor.
"The evidence against McCasland
and Moskowitz was only
circumstantial," Garvey told the Daily.
'Ideology Split'
McCasland and Moskowitz
maintained they did not draft the
letter. "We don't know who did it, but
we're not to blame," Moskowitz said.
He blamed Brooks' charge on an
"ideology split" at KFJC.
Both McCasland and Moskowitz are
former KZSU staffers.
"Nobody at KFJC 'ikes the top-40
format, but it would be really absurd
for people to think that we were
thinking of imposing our taste on
KZSU," McCasland said.
Moskowitz added that he believed
the letter to be "mainly fact."
Garvey admitted, "There are little
elements of truth in the letter. There
might have been people at the station
who were offended by things that
were said."
But he cautioned against "further
accusations" that would "only muddle
things up."
"Our engineers felt very strongly
that KZSU's increase would seriously
interfere with our coverage. That's
why we filed our objection," he said.

"Our engineers felt very strongly
that KZSU's increase would seriously
interfere with our coverage. That's
why we filed our objection," he said.

CENTERS OF CONTROVERSY — KZSU Chief Engineer Mark Lawrence (left) and former Business Manager Lloyd Snook
have come under attack in open letter to KZSIPs management supposedly written by KFJC Station Manager Keith
Garvey. Garvev denied drafting the letter.
Nearly two months after the
Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) denial of a power increase for
KZSU, the radio station still faces a
long series of negotiations with
neighboring station KFJC before any
power increase can be approved.
KFJC, Foothill College's campus
station, successfully blocked the
KZSU power hike from 10 to 500
watts by claiming that inter-station
interference would cut out significant
areas of its coverage.
The FCC concurred and turned
down KZSU's request in February.
A KFJC source last month
suggested that the station would soon
advance a set of demands to KZSU in
exchange for removal of their
objection.
The source, highly-placed in the
KFJC staff, told the Daily in early
March that the station would demand
a change back to KZSU's former loose
progressive format and also the
resignations of then-KZSU Business
Manager Lloyd Snook, Chief Engineer
Mark Lawrence and Program Director
Francis Dickerson.
However, no KFJC management
personnel would confirm those reports
for the Daily.
Former KFJC Asst. Station
Manager Ted Brooks denied that KFJC
had officially contacted or had
planned to contact KZSU management
to offer them any such demands.
Brooks attributed the rumors to
"loose talk around the station
[KFJCI."

Nor nad any of the three principal
KZSU figures involved — Snook,
Lawrence or Dickerson — been
contacted about the alleged KFJC
demands.
The reports gained credence two
weeks ago when an open letter to the
KZSU management, supposedly
written and signed by KFJC Station
Manager Keith Garvey, accused Snook
and Lawrence of "presumptuous and
rude arrogance."
He said it would be "preposterous"
and highly unethical for KFJC to
demand any personnel or format

changes at KZSU in exchange for
removal of his station's objection.
Garvey added that he was unsure
who had actually written and signed
the letter.
The letter, written on KFJC
stationery and printed on the Daily
opinions page April 4, asserted that
"the attitudes of KZSU's management
was the deciding factor" in KFJC's
decision to file its objection to the
KZSU increase.
"At this date, it is not our
contention that KZSU will never be
permitted to amplify its

signal .... However, we refuse to deal
with the likes of Messrs. Lawrence and
Snook," the letter stated.
"Further, we believe that an
amplification of KZSU's signal at a
time when a top-40-request format is
in effect would constitute a disservice
to the education al-FM radio
audience."
Garvey last week flatly denied
composing, signing or even seeing the
letter before it was mailed. "I didn't
write it. I didn't sign it. And it
certainly doesn't represent a pressing,
burning issue at KFJC," he told the
Daily Thursday.

Early last week Brooks accused
KFJC Chief Engineer Doug McCasland
and news staffer David Moskowitz of
drafting the letter "to cause trouble."
McCasland was asked to resign as chief
engineer Tuesday, but was reinstated
Wednesday after a meeting of the
entire KFJC staff and the station's
faculty sponsor.
"The evidence against McCasland
and Moskowitz was only
circumstantial," Garvey told the Daily.
'Ideology Split'
McCasland and Moskowitz
maintained they did not draft the
letter. "We don't know who did it, but
we're not to blame," Moskowitz said.
He blamed Brooks' charge on an
"ideology split" at KFJC.
Both McCasland and Moskowitz are
former KZSU staffers.
"Nobody at KFJC 'ikes the top-40
format, but it would be really absurd
for people to think that we were
thinking of imposing our taste on
KZSU," McCasland said.
Moskowitz added that he believed
the letter to be "mainly fact."
Garvey admitted, "There are little
elements of truth in the letter. There
might have been people at the station
who were offended by things that
were said."
But he cautioned against "further
accusations" that would "only muddle
things up."
"Our engineers felt very strongly
that KZSU's increase would seriously
interfere with our coverage. That's
why we filed our objection," he said.

Moskowitz added that he believed
the letter to be "mainly fact."
Garvey admitted, "There are little
elements of truth in the letter. There
might have been people at the station
who were offended by things that
were said."
But he cautioned against "further
accusations" that would "only muddle
things up."
"Our engineers felt very strongly
that KZSU's increase would seriously
interfere with our coverage. That's
why we filed our objection," he said.
