## Roble-Lag Move 
### 
The controversy and confusion surrounding the black
theme house move from Roble to Lagunita has again stirred
the question of communication between the housing office
and students.
Despite claims of time pressure and circumstance by
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton, some
residents of both Lagunita and Roble have expressed anger
that they were not consulted before the decision to move
the theme house was made.
Too often the channels for discussion between students
and the housing office have seemingly broken down before
important decisions affecting students are made.
Horton himself has cited this "lack of communication" in
dealing with student complaints about housing office
decisions concerning the campus housing shortage and dorm
overcrowding, dorm shutdown during Christmas break and
the emeritus faculty housing project on the Row.
His decision not to inform Lagunita and Roble residents
of the theme house switch because it would "alarm" them
and present them with "half-baked proposals" was poor.
Once the decision to move the house was made, there was
little need for student input; the matter was settled.
We feel the final arrangements for the black theme house
move were made too late in the academic year to allow for
the proper amount of student input.
Since Dean Horton was well aware of black student
dissatisfaction with the program in Roble weeks before the
end of winter quarter, he had time to initiate discussion with
both black and white students.
By failing to take that initiative, the housing office
helped precipitate the last-minute mini-crisis which resulted.
