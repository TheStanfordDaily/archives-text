# On Housing Draw
##

Stanford is apparently the only
college campus that deals with its
housing problems by using a
convoluted system of chance and
priorities. Chance is considered
"fair" and democratic. This is
possibly true. However, the
priorities system is so complex
and unfair that it is a wonder that
we students have gone along with
it.
Rather than use the criterion
of "last residence" and a complex
set of time-dated lists, which
discriminate grossly against those
students who were unwillingly
displaced in the draw, the Housing
Office should take it upon itself
to find out two things; first,
whether or not each student could
afford to move off campus, in as
much as decent local housing
ranges fromsl2s-$ 150 per month.
There is also the added cost of
food and transportation.
Second, why doesn't the
priority system take into account
that there may be students who
could easily move in with their
families (i.e. they are already local
residents), and thus alleviate the
space problem without adding
economic stress? In short, why
should a Palo Alto resident be
allowed to move on campus when
someone from out of state must
find housing at a long distance?
In addition, there might be
considered a priority for returning
freshmen, since most freshmen
have not had time to settle into

Stanford, and probably a number
of upperclassmen would prefer
living off campus but find it easier
to stay in their rut.
One last query for the housing
people: What about the estimated
50-100 students who take up
space at some time during the
year, although they have not
registered?
Is this a fair system? Having
been displaced once, I am certain
that this method is not only
unresponsive to the actual needs
of the students, but also so
riddled with chance and
favoritism that any sensitive or
sane person can not undertake the
wait listing and house hunting
without a maximum of frustration
and anxiety. Yet there has been
no move to replace the outdated
trailers nor to upgrade the less
desirable housing.
I am quite aware that various
ASSU slates promised remedies to
the situation, yet I believe the
Housing Office itself must become
aware of the inequities, as it is
their responsibility as a student
service organization to provide
adequate housing. They should
not provide a political platform,
because it is the politics of the
priority system that should
become fair and "apolitical" with
the reformation of the draw, and
hopefully the addition of
adequate space.

food and transportation.
Second, why doesn't the
priority system take into account
that there may be students who
could easily move in with their
families (i.e. they are already local
residents), and thus alleviate the
space problem without adding
economic stress? In short, why
should a Palo Alto resident be
allowed to move on campus when
someone from out of state must
find housing at a long distance?
In addition, there might be
considered a priority for returning
freshmen, since most freshmen
have not had time to settle into

Stanford, and probably a number
of upperclassmen would prefer
living off campus but find it easier
to stay in their rut.
One last query for the housing
people: What about the estimated
50-100 students who take up
space at some time during the
year, although they have not
registered?
Is this a fair system? Having
been displaced once, I am certain
that this method is not only
unresponsive to the actual needs
of the students, but also so
riddled with chance and
favoritism that any sensitive or
sane person can not undertake the
wait listing and house hunting
without a maximum of frustration
and anxiety. Yet there has been
no move to replace the outdated
trailers nor to upgrade the less
desirable housing.
I am quite aware that various
ASSU slates promised remedies to
the situation, yet I believe the
Housing Office itself must become
aware of the inequities, as it is
their responsibility as a student
service organization to provide
adequate housing. They should
not provide a political platform,
because it is the politics of the
priority system that should
become fair and "apolitical" with
the reformation of the draw, and
hopefully the addition of
adequate space.

Stanford is apparently the only
college campus that deals with its
housing problems by using a
convoluted system of chance and
priorities. Chance is considered
"fair" and democratic. This is
possibly true. However, the
priorities system is so complex
and unfair that it is a wonder that
we students have gone along with
it.
Rather than use the criterion
of "last residence" and a complex
set of time-dated lists, which
discriminate grossly against those
students who were unwillingly
displaced in the draw, the Housing
Office should take it upon itself
to find out two things; first,
whether or not each student could
afford to move off campus, in as
much as decent local housing
ranges fromsl2s-$ 150 per month.
There is also the added cost of
food and transportation.
Second, why doesn't the
priority system take into account
that there may be students who
could easily move in with their
families (i.e. they are already local
residents), and thus alleviate the
space problem without adding
economic stress? In short, why
