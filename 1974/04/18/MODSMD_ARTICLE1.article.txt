# NLRB Orders Unionization Vote For Campus TDS Employees
## 
### DON COX 
The National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) yesterday ordered a
unionization, election for regular
part-time and full-time employees,
including students, at the Tresidder
cafeteria and two other on-campus
concessions operated by the private
company TDS, Inc.
If the management of TDS does not
object, employees in the Tresidder
bargaining unit will vote within 30
days either to be represented by the
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union — Local 680 of the Service
Employees International Union — or
to forego unionization.
USE president Jim Berk told the
Daily last night that if the Tresidder
unit elects to have USE represent
them, it would be the first time
students were unionized on the
Stanford campus.

Eligible employees in the voting
unit will be regular employees at the
Tresidder cafeteria, the Coffee House,
and the Encina Snack Bar, who
regularly work more than four hours
per week.
Subcontract
The University subcontracts
operation of the three concessions to
TDS, a private catering company.
Marty Eichner, attorney for USE,
told the Daily last night that regular
student employees are included in the
unit. Management, clerical, supervisory
personnel are excluded, he said.
TDS president Skip Mclntyre said
last night that while he had not read
the NLRB order, he planned
"absolutely not" to object to the
election.
" I welcome them to
exercise their democratic rights,"
said Mclntyre. However, Eichner said

he thought "TDS will try any tactic
possible to prevent the election."
'Good Decision'
Berk said the NLRB order was a
"good decision." The Tresidder unit
workers "all belong in the union. As
far as we're concerned, they're
Stanford employees," he said. USE
had petitioned to represent the
Tresidder bargaining unit.
Berk estimated there were about 40
students in the Tresidder unit.
"The decision will add immeasurably
to attempts to organize students in the
future. There is no essential qualitative
difference between" student workers
and the other staff workers, said Berk.
In a press conference at KZSU
yesterday afternoon, Berk did not
echo the optimism voiced earlier this
week by President Richard Lyman and
University negotiator Douglas Barton
about the USE contract negotiations.

"The University is not negotiating
at the bargaining table" and is forcing
the union into a strike, said Berk.
While a strike "is not inevitable"
he said it was becoming "quite likely."
Berk remained firm in his
contention that the University could
come up with the money to meet
union demands.
"We understand it's a problem, but
we also understand that for many
years they've ignored our needs and
ignored our rights," he said.
Tuesday, on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman said that it would
be "wholly unimaginable" to go to the
alumni for more money.
Lyman Isolated
Lyman is isolated by subordinates
and "doesn't really know what's
happening," he said.
"We're not accepting Lyman's
assessment of what the University can
afford. He is not in a responsible
position to answer this question," said
Berk.
Berk denied that the union
negotiating team was abandoning any
of its demands. Some items have been
relegated to a background status while
the union concentrates on the big
issues that most concern the union
members, he said. The smaller priority
items would not be forgotten, he
emphasized.
He warned that "everybody [in the
union] is getting angry" and that there
were already signs of a work
slowdown.
Shut Place Down
If the union goes on strike, "we're
going to shut this place down," he
said.
While student support for striking
workers would be helpful, Berk said
the strike wouldn't succeed or fail
because of student support.
"Students do owe it to themselves
to look into the issues themselves, and
i* they do we feel they will support
us," he said.
USE won an earlier election
involving about 1500 Stanford
workers last June, becoming the first
large union on the campus. The June
election was the second USE
participated in; in March, 1972, the
campus group lost a primary contest
to Teamsters Local 856.
But the bargaining unit chose not
to unionize in the final election held
the next month.

unit. Management, clerical, supervisory
personnel are excluded, he said.
TDS president Skip Mclntyre said
last night that while he had not read
the NLRB order, he planned
"absolutely not" to object to the
election.
" I welcome them to
exercise their democratic rights,"
said Mclntyre. However, Eichner said

he thought "TDS will try any tactic
possible to prevent the election."
'Good Decision'
Berk said the NLRB order was a
"good decision." The Tresidder unit
workers "all belong in the union. As
far as we're concerned, they're
Stanford employees," he said. USE
had petitioned to represent the
Tresidder bargaining unit.
Berk estimated there were about 40
students in the Tresidder unit.
"The decision will add immeasurably
to attempts to organize students in the
future. There is no essential qualitative
difference between" student workers
and the other staff workers, said Berk.
In a press conference at KZSU
yesterday afternoon, Berk did not
echo the optimism voiced earlier this
week by President Richard Lyman and
University negotiator Douglas Barton
about the USE contract negotiations.

"The University is not negotiating
at the bargaining table" and is forcing
the union into a strike, said Berk.
While a strike "is not inevitable"
he said it was becoming "quite likely."
Berk remained firm in his
contention that the University could
come up with the money to meet
union demands.
"We understand it's a problem, but
we also understand that for many
years they've ignored our needs and
ignored our rights," he said.
Tuesday, on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman said that it would
be "wholly unimaginable" to go to the
alumni for more money.
Lyman Isolated
Lyman is isolated by subordinates
and "doesn't really know what's
happening," he said.
"We're not accepting Lyman's
assessment of what the University can
afford. He is not in a responsible
position to answer this question," said
Berk.
Berk denied that the union
negotiating team was abandoning any
of its demands. Some items have been
relegated to a background status while
the union concentrates on the big
issues that most concern the union
members, he said. The smaller priority
items would not be forgotten, he
emphasized.
He warned that "everybody [in the
union] is getting angry" and that there
were already signs of a work
slowdown.
Shut Place Down
If the union goes on strike, "we're
going to shut this place down," he
said.
While student support for striking
workers would be helpful, Berk said
the strike wouldn't succeed or fail
because of student support.
"Students do owe it to themselves
to look into the issues themselves, and
i* they do we feel they will support
us," he said.
USE won an earlier election
involving about 1500 Stanford
workers last June, becoming the first
large union on the campus. The June
election was the second USE
participated in; in March, 1972, the
campus group lost a primary contest
to Teamsters Local 856.
But the bargaining unit chose not
to unionize in the final election held
the next month.
The National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) yesterday ordered a
unionization, election for regular
part-time and full-time employees,
including students, at the Tresidder
cafeteria and two other on-campus
concessions operated by the private
company TDS, Inc.
If the management of TDS does not
object, employees in the Tresidder
bargaining unit will vote within 30
days either to be represented by the
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union — Local 680 of the Service
Employees International Union — or
to forego unionization.
USE president Jim Berk told the
Daily last night that if the Tresidder
unit elects to have USE represent
them, it would be the first time
students were unionized on the
Stanford campus.

Eligible employees in the voting
unit will be regular employees at the
Tresidder cafeteria, the Coffee House,
and the Encina Snack Bar, who
regularly work more than four hours
per week.
Subcontract
The University subcontracts
operation of the three concessions to
TDS, a private catering company.
Marty Eichner, attorney for USE,
told the Daily last night that regular
student employees are included in the
