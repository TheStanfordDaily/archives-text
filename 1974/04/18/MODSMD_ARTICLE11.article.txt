# John Connolly: From LBJ To RMN
## 
### 
Bill Evers

Columnist Jack Anderson charged
recently that former Treasury Secretary John
B. Connally is under investigation for
bribery.
There is a possibility that $10,000 was
passed from a milk producers' cooperative to
Texas political wheeler-dealer Jake Jacobsen
and ultimately pocketed by Connally.
The career, views, and friends of Connally
provide a good illustration of the sort of man
who is the key to American politics — a man
who is deeply entwined in both business and
government and who can advise Presidents of
either political party.
Since the early 19505, Connally has been
closely associated with the firm of
Richardson & Bass, whose founder Sid
Richardson was one of the richest oilmen in
the world. Connally gained this management
post in business because of the
special ties he had to important Texas
politicians like President Johnson and Sam
Rayburn, long-time speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives.
Political Post
As a politician in his own right, Connally
has been a Democratic secretary of the Navy
and governor of Texas, as well as
Democrat-turned-Republican secretary of the
treasury and trade negotiator.
Connally first went into business on his
own with money borrowed from an Austin
bank dominated by the Brown & Root
construction company, the principal
financier of Johnson's early rise to power.
Brown & Root's lifeblood has been
government contracts from the public works
porkbarrel of the New Deal to building bases
in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War.
The historic ties between Connally and
Brown & Root may well have helped the
company in a dispute it had with the U.S.
government over cost-overruns on some
NATO bases in Spain during the early 19605.
At that time Connally was running the

Navy, and the Navy made what the U.S.
General Accounting Office called "evident"
and "obvious" accounting errors totaling
millions of dollars in favor of Brown & Root
and its associates.
In Connally's 1964 primary campaign for
the Texas gubernatorial nomination, Brown
& Root executives contributed $4500;
associates of the Brown-influenced First City
National Bank of Houston contributed
$9500; and Brown & Root's Washington
lobbyist Frank Oltorf contributed as well.
In the early 19605, Brown & Root became
an independent subsidiary of the Haliburton
Company, the world's leading oil and gas
service company. After he left the governor's
office, Connally himself went on the board
of Halliburton.
Paramount Lobbyist
In the Nixon administration, Connally was
the paramount lobbyist for the $250 million
loan guarantee to subsidize the failing
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.
|ln the hearings that considered the
Lockheed loan, Connally frankly told Sen.
William Proxmire that the government was
not interested in Lockheed's performance or
precise fulfillment of contracts.
What the government was interested in
was a subsidy to keep the company in
operation and its aerospace workers on the
job.
Connally's involvement in the milk fund
controversy is a final example of the
character of his activities. The existence of
the milk fund itself is a natural product of
the mixed-economy that Connally
ideologically prefers.
Dairy product quotas and milk price
support programs not only upset the
economically proper supply-and-demand
situation, but are a financial award to the
domestic dairy industry.
Jake Jacobsen, who is central to the
question of the milk money, was an aide to

Texas Governor Price Daniel in the 19505,
then a White House counsel to Lyndon
Johnson in the 19605, and finally worked
with Connally to get Nixon re-elected
President.
Industry Ties
Jacobsen has been working for the dairy
industry in political campaigns since 1968.
Jacobsen spoke to Connally in February
or March of 1971 on milk price supports and
the political desires of the dairy industry.
Now Jacobsen has testified that $10,000 was
put in a safe-deposit box by the dairy
industry for Connally's use. The only
question is whether he used it.
In John Connally, we have quite a
specimen — a man close to big business
(especially oil and the military-industrial
complex) and Presidents; a proponent of
wage-price controls, large government
expenditures, and arm-twisting trade
negotiations; and now a former official fn the
spotlight because of his possible role in the
day-to-day petty corruption of political life.

Linda Crouse's article on "Wages and
Women" in the April 11 Daily implies that
employer discrimination is the cause of the
difference in the earnings of men and
women.
In the May 1971 Monthly Ixibor Review
of the U.S. Department of Labor, Victor R.
Fuchs writes: "Consider ... the hypothesis
that the employer or supervisor is the
principal source of discrimination. If so, we
would expect the male-female differential in
earnings to be smallest for the self-employed,
because no discrimination of this kind is
possible."
As Fuchs notes, however, the data do not
support this hypothesis. The differential is
larger in self-employed occupations than in
situations of wage or salary employment.

who is the key to American politics — a man
who is deeply entwined in both business and
government and who can advise Presidents of
either political party.
Since the early 19505, Connally has been
closely associated with the firm of
Richardson & Bass, whose founder Sid
Richardson was one of the richest oilmen in
the world. Connally gained this management
post in business because of the
special ties he had to important Texas
politicians like President Johnson and Sam
Rayburn, long-time speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives.
Political Post
As a politician in his own right, Connally
has been a Democratic secretary of the Navy
and governor of Texas, as well as
Democrat-turned-Republican secretary of the
treasury and trade negotiator.
Connally first went into business on his
own with money borrowed from an Austin
bank dominated by the Brown & Root
construction company, the principal
financier of Johnson's early rise to power.
Brown & Root's lifeblood has been
government contracts from the public works
porkbarrel of the New Deal to building bases
in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War.
The historic ties between Connally and
Brown & Root may well have helped the
company in a dispute it had with the U.S.
government over cost-overruns on some
NATO bases in Spain during the early 19605.
At that time Connally was running the

Navy, and the Navy made what the U.S.
General Accounting Office called "evident"
and "obvious" accounting errors totaling
millions of dollars in favor of Brown & Root
and its associates.
In Connally's 1964 primary campaign for
the Texas gubernatorial nomination, Brown
& Root executives contributed $4500;
associates of the Brown-influenced First City
National Bank of Houston contributed
$9500; and Brown & Root's Washington
lobbyist Frank Oltorf contributed as well.
In the early 19605, Brown & Root became
an independent subsidiary of the Haliburton
Company, the world's leading oil and gas
service company. After he left the governor's
office, Connally himself went on the board
of Halliburton.
Paramount Lobbyist
In the Nixon administration, Connally was
the paramount lobbyist for the $250 million
loan guarantee to subsidize the failing
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.
|ln the hearings that considered the
Lockheed loan, Connally frankly told Sen.
William Proxmire that the government was
not interested in Lockheed's performance or
precise fulfillment of contracts.
What the government was interested in
was a subsidy to keep the company in
operation and its aerospace workers on the
job.
Connally's involvement in the milk fund
controversy is a final example of the
character of his activities. The existence of
the milk fund itself is a natural product of
the mixed-economy that Connally
ideologically prefers.
Dairy product quotas and milk price
support programs not only upset the
economically proper supply-and-demand
situation, but are a financial award to the
domestic dairy industry.
Jake Jacobsen, who is central to the
question of the milk money, was an aide to

Texas Governor Price Daniel in the 19505,
then a White House counsel to Lyndon
Johnson in the 19605, and finally worked
with Connally to get Nixon re-elected
President.
Industry Ties
Jacobsen has been working for the dairy
industry in political campaigns since 1968.
Jacobsen spoke to Connally in February
or March of 1971 on milk price supports and
the political desires of the dairy industry.
Now Jacobsen has testified that $10,000 was
put in a safe-deposit box by the dairy
industry for Connally's use. The only
question is whether he used it.
In John Connally, we have quite a
specimen — a man close to big business
(especially oil and the military-industrial
complex) and Presidents; a proponent of
wage-price controls, large government
expenditures, and arm-twisting trade
negotiations; and now a former official fn the
spotlight because of his possible role in the
day-to-day petty corruption of political life.

Linda Crouse's article on "Wages and
Women" in the April 11 Daily implies that
employer discrimination is the cause of the
difference in the earnings of men and
women.
In the May 1971 Monthly Ixibor Review
of the U.S. Department of Labor, Victor R.
Fuchs writes: "Consider ... the hypothesis
that the employer or supervisor is the
principal source of discrimination. If so, we
would expect the male-female differential in
earnings to be smallest for the self-employed,
because no discrimination of this kind is
possible."
As Fuchs notes, however, the data do not
support this hypothesis. The differential is
larger in self-employed occupations than in
situations of wage or salary employment.

Columnist Jack Anderson charged
recently that former Treasury Secretary John
B. Connally is under investigation for
bribery.
There is a possibility that $10,000 was
passed from a milk producers' cooperative to
Texas political wheeler-dealer Jake Jacobsen
and ultimately pocketed by Connally.

post in business because of the
special ties he had to important Texas
politicians like President Johnson and Sam
Rayburn, long-time speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives.
Political Post
As a politician in his own right, Connally
has been a Democratic secretary of the Navy
and governor of Texas, as well as
Democrat-turned-Republican secretary of the
treasury and trade negotiator.
Connally first went into business on his
own with money borrowed from an Austin
bank dominated by the Brown & Root
construction company, the principal
financier of Johnson's early rise to power.
Brown & Root's lifeblood has been
government contracts from the public works
porkbarrel of the New Deal to building bases
in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War.
The historic ties between Connally and
Brown & Root may well have helped the
company in a dispute it had with the U.S.
government over cost-overruns on some
NATO bases in Spain during the early 19605.
At that time Connally was running the

Navy, and the Navy made what the U.S.
General Accounting Office called "evident"
and "obvious" accounting errors totaling
millions of dollars in favor of Brown & Root
and its associates.
In Connally's 1964 primary campaign for
the Texas gubernatorial nomination, Brown
& Root executives contributed $4500;
associates of the Brown-influenced First City
National Bank of Houston contributed
$9500; and Brown & Root's Washington
lobbyist Frank Oltorf contributed as well.
In the early 19605, Brown & Root became
an independent subsidiary of the Haliburton
Company, the world's leading oil and gas
service company. After he left the governor's
office, Connally himself went on the board
of Halliburton.
Paramount Lobbyist
In the Nixon administration, Connally was
the paramount lobbyist for the $250 million
loan guarantee to subsidize the failing
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.
|ln the hearings that considered the
Lockheed loan, Connally frankly told Sen.
William Proxmire that the government was
not interested in Lockheed's performance or
precise fulfillment of contracts.
What the government was interested in
was a subsidy to keep the company in
operation and its aerospace workers on the
job.
Connally's involvement in the milk fund
controversy is a final example of the
character of his activities. The existence of
the milk fund itself is a natural product of
the mixed-economy that Connally
ideologically prefers.
Dairy product quotas and milk price
support programs not only upset the
economically proper supply-and-demand
situation, but are a financial award to the
domestic dairy industry.
Jake Jacobsen, who is central to the
question of the milk money, was an aide to

Texas Governor Price Daniel in the 19505,
then a White House counsel to Lyndon
Johnson in the 19605, and finally worked
with Connally to get Nixon re-elected
President.
Industry Ties
Jacobsen has been working for the dairy
industry in political campaigns since 1968.
Jacobsen spoke to Connally in February
or March of 1971 on milk price supports and
the political desires of the dairy industry.
Now Jacobsen has testified that $10,000 was
put in a safe-deposit box by the dairy
industry for Connally's use. The only
question is whether he used it.
In John Connally, we have quite a
specimen — a man close to big business
(especially oil and the military-industrial
complex) and Presidents; a proponent of
wage-price controls, large government
expenditures, and arm-twisting trade
negotiations; and now a former official fn the
spotlight because of his possible role in the
day-to-day petty corruption of political life.

Linda Crouse's article on "Wages and
Women" in the April 11 Daily implies that
employer discrimination is the cause of the
difference in the earnings of men and
women.
In the May 1971 Monthly Ixibor Review
of the U.S. Department of Labor, Victor R.
Fuchs writes: "Consider ... the hypothesis
that the employer or supervisor is the
principal source of discrimination. If so, we
would expect the male-female differential in
earnings to be smallest for the self-employed,
because no discrimination of this kind is
possible."
As Fuchs notes, however, the data do not
support this hypothesis. The differential is
larger in self-employed occupations than in
situations of wage or salary employment.

Columnist Jack Anderson charged
recently that former Treasury Secretary John
B. Connally is under investigation for
bribery.
There is a possibility that $10,000 was
passed from a milk producers' cooperative to
Texas political wheeler-dealer Jake Jacobsen
and ultimately pocketed by Connally.
The career, views, and friends of Connally
provide a good illustration of the sort of man
who is the key to American politics — a man
who is deeply entwined in both business and
government and who can advise Presidents of
either political party.
Since the early 19505, Connally has been
closely associated with the firm of
Richardson & Bass, whose founder Sid
Richardson was one of the richest oilmen in
the world. Connally gained this management
post in business because of the
special ties he had to important Texas
politicians like President Johnson and Sam
Rayburn, long-time speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives.
