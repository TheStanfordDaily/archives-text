# Roble Move--Another Viewpoint
## 
### 
Marie Simonion

While the housing office's
handling of the black theme house
move was by no means perfect,
yesterday's Daily editorial (April
16) was a bit strong in its
condemnation.
In my months of following the
housing office as a Daily reporter,
I have seen the office and its
administrators make mistakes as
well as perhaps questionable
decisions.
However, in this instance, I feel
the Daily editorial board failed to
take into consideration the many
extenuating circumstances
surrounding the theme house
move.
The most important of these
circumstances is time pressure.
Horton maintains that his office
became aware of the acceptability
of Lagunita to the black students
on Thursday of winter quarter
finals week. His final decision was
made Tuesday, the first week of
spring quarter.
Approval Needed
During this 13-day period,
Horton not only had to confer
with black students to gain their
approval, but also with the Roble
resident fellows, Dr. and Mrs.
Clayton Bates.
Discounting days for spring
break, when most students are on
vacation, the housing office had a
total of three working days in
which to finalize the plans for a
move — plans which under normal
circumstances should have taken
weeks to make.
So, the office took necessary
steps to save time, one of which
was not consulting the majority of
Roble and Lagunita students in

the decision-making.
Another reason Horton has
advanced for not informing these
residents is that he did not want
to "alarm" students by presenting
them with "half-baked
proposals," especially when it
appeared earlier in the week the
program might not be moved to
Lagunita.
While this reasoning may seem
"poor" to the edit board and to
some Roble and Lag residents, it
is understandable from the
housing office's point of view,
considering recent history.
Angry Students
Earlier this year, when the
housing office proposed the
shutdown of dorms over
Christmas break as a "half-baked
proposal," Horton personally
drew fire from irate students
who did not accept his simple "I
don't know" answer as the
housing office sorted the facts and
issues to make a final decision.
Not only were the student
attacks on the housing office and
Horton vitriolic (Horton was even
threatened with a lawsuit), but
students were generally indignant
that the housing office had not
come to them with a
fully-detailed proposal on hand.
Still licking its wounds from
that fiasco, the housing office
decided to try a different tactic
this time — have everything
worked out beforehand.
Olivo-Magnolia residents were
presented with a reasonable
proposal, almost fully detailed.
The editorial also criticizes the
housing office for not taking the
"initiative" to consult students

weeks before the deadline, since
the office was well aware of the
theme house problems.
Modification Needed?
However, the editorial fails to
consider to what extent that
discussion hinged on black
student modification of proposals
already presented and discussed
with the housing office.
Considering the time pressure,
Horton had two alternatives if he
wanted to take time to consult
Lag and Roble residents —
postpone the housing draw or
postpone the theme house move.

Putting off the draw would
have penalized the entire student
body as well as fouled up
arrangements with overseas
campus students.
Delaying the theme house
move probably would have
further angered black students,
already unhappy with both the
situation in Roble and the denial
of a separate Black Cultural
Center.

However, the editorial fails to
consider to what extent that
discussion hinged on black
student modification of proposals
already presented and discussed
with the housing office.
Considering the time pressure,
Horton had two alternatives if he
wanted to take time to consult
Lag and Roble residents —
postpone the housing draw or
postpone the theme house move.

Putting off the draw would
have penalized the entire student
body as well as fouled up
arrangements with overseas
campus students.
Delaying the theme house
move probably would have
further angered black students,
already unhappy with both the
situation in Roble and the denial
of a separate Black Cultural
Center.

While the housing office's
handling of the black theme house
move was by no means perfect,
yesterday's Daily editorial (April
16) was a bit strong in its
condemnation.
In my months of following the
housing office as a Daily reporter,
I have seen the office and its
administrators make mistakes as
well as perhaps questionable
decisions.
However, in this instance, I feel
the Daily editorial board failed to
take into consideration the many
extenuating circumstances
surrounding the theme house
move.
The most important of these
circumstances is time pressure.
Horton maintains that his office
became aware of the acceptability
of Lagunita to the black students
on Thursday of winter quarter
finals week. His final decision was
made Tuesday, the first week of
spring quarter.
Approval Needed
During this 13-day period,
Horton not only had to confer
with black students to gain their
approval, but also with the Roble
resident fellows, Dr. and Mrs.
Clayton Bates.
Discounting days for spring
break, when most students are on
vacation, the housing office had a
total of three working days in
which to finalize the plans for a
move — plans which under normal
circumstances should have taken
weeks to make.
So, the office took necessary
steps to save time, one of which
was not consulting the majority of
Roble and Lagunita students in

the decision-making.
Another reason Horton has
advanced for not informing these
residents is that he did not want
to "alarm" students by presenting
them with "half-baked
proposals," especially when it
appeared earlier in the week the
program might not be moved to
Lagunita.
While this reasoning may seem
"poor" to the edit board and to
some Roble and Lag residents, it
is understandable from the
housing office's point of view,
considering recent history.
Angry Students
Earlier this year, when the
housing office proposed the
shutdown of dorms over
Christmas break as a "half-baked
proposal," Horton personally
drew fire from irate students
who did not accept his simple "I
don't know" answer as the
housing office sorted the facts and
issues to make a final decision.
Not only were the student
attacks on the housing office and
Horton vitriolic (Horton was even
threatened with a lawsuit), but
students were generally indignant
that the housing office had not
come to them with a
fully-detailed proposal on hand.
Still licking its wounds from
that fiasco, the housing office
decided to try a different tactic
this time — have everything
worked out beforehand.
Olivo-Magnolia residents were
presented with a reasonable
proposal, almost fully detailed.
The editorial also criticizes the
housing office for not taking the
"initiative" to consult students

weeks before the deadline, since
the office was well aware of the
theme house problems.
