"Sure I believe every citizen
has a right to demonstrate his
feelings in a peaceful manner. But
not when it's against the law."
Government adviser Frank
Crotch lounges at a Saigon
sidewalk cafe, sipping tea. The
new spring sun's heat distorts the
air of the capital, forms sin curves.
Crotch's thinking. Funny how
nature imitates science.
He's in the shade of a bright
red awning donated to the cafe
for public relations purposes by
the Coca Cola Corporation. His
companion is the French
businessman, Georges,
Demimonde.
"Frank, the law exists only to
limit the competition. The
enterprising citizen must bend the
law a bit if he is to, as you say, get
a foot in the door."
Demimonde's been here since
the French defeat at Dien Bien
Phu. He's made a killing in the
black market, hawking American
chocolate, British cigarettes, and
Japanese radios to the soldiers.
"The white faces are fewer in
the paddies now, but sales haven't
dropped, not considerably. ARVN
troops, awed by the American
fighting man's efficiency, are
quick to ape his habits.
"I sympathize with these
people, Frank. I, too, was
rebellious as a student many years
ago at the Sorbonne. But the
Occupation taught me
discretion."
"Discretion, hell! What about
respect for your government?"
Demimonde snaps off a square of
a Hershey bar, places it in his
mouth. "It wasn't our
government."
The street is suddenly silent.
The Honda-made automobiles and
buses have vanished. The tourists
and merchants are all indoors.
Only their eyes and nostrils are
visible through the breath-fogged
shop windows.
There is soon the murmur of
footsteps, of sandals. A
procession of people turns the
corner, heads up the street. They
carry hand-painted signs, are
chanting the Vietnamese word for
"peace." Demimonde has to
translate it for Crotch.
The demonstrators support
neither the Communists nor
Thieu. They are Neutralists.
Neutralism is a crime in South
Vietnam. An uncommitted mind
can be dangerous.
"Where the hell's the F-6?"
Crotch's nearly pissing from
exasperation. He remembers his
stint with Operation Phoenix, the
U.S.-sponsored effort to eliminate
the republic's dissident element.
But Phoenix has perished in
the ash of December's last-gasp
scatter bombing. Thieu's
government must now do the job
itself. The specially assigned unit
has taken the code name "F-6."
"Christ, what a break! Every
subversive and his mother's in that
crowd. What are those gooks
waiting for?"
The F-6 forces do not wait
long. They descend from the
rooftops. from Sikorsky
helicopters, beating the
demonstrators with the butts of
M-l rifles. The demonstrators do
not resist. This, Crotch cannot
understand. Demimonde does not
attempt to explain.
The police vans arrive. (They
call them paddy wagons in the
provinces.) The demonstrators are
packed and consigned to
interrogation terminals. Crotch
knows the rest.
They are put in tanks of water
and the tanks are struck with
clubs, the resulting vibrations
crushing their guts till they vomit
blood; or, they are pushed from
airborne choppers in an effort to
loosen the tongue of the next guy
in line; or, their genitals are wired
and an electric current sent
screaming through their flesh.
(Will their kids be AC or DC,
Crotch wonders; if they live to
have kids.)
But that's all done with now,
isn't it? The Saigon street's again
rackety with Hondas, buses,
tourists, merchants. Demimonde
has returned to work. Crotch sits
alone at the cafe.
The rains will be here soon.
Crotch is enjoying the sun while
he can. He takes another sip of
tea.

The police vans arrive. (They
call them paddy wagons in the
provinces.) The demonstrators are
packed and consigned to
interrogation terminals. Crotch
knows the rest.
They are put in tanks of water
and the tanks are struck with
clubs, the resulting vibrations
crushing their guts till they vomit
blood; or, they are pushed from
airborne choppers in an effort to
loosen the tongue of the next guy
in line; or, their genitals are wired
and an electric current sent
screaming through their flesh.
(Will their kids be AC or DC,
Crotch wonders; if they live to

But that's all done with now,
isn't it? The Saigon street's again
rackety with Hondas, buses,
tourists, merchants. Demimonde
has returned to work. Crotch sits
alone at the cafe.
The rains will be here soon.
Crotch is enjoying the sun while
he can. He takes another sip of

"Sure I believe every citizen
has a right to demonstrate his
feelings in a peaceful manner. But
not when it's against the law."
Government adviser Frank
Crotch lounges at a Saigon
sidewalk cafe, sipping tea. The
new spring sun's heat distorts the
air of the capital, forms sin curves.
Crotch's thinking. Funny how
nature imitates science.
He's in the shade of a bright
red awning donated to the cafe
for public relations purposes by
the Coca Cola Corporation. His
companion is the French
businessman, Georges,
Demimonde.
"Frank, the law exists only to
limit the competition. The
enterprising citizen must bend the
law a bit if he is to, as you say, get
a foot in the door."
Demimonde's been here since
the French defeat at Dien Bien
Phu. He's made a killing in the
black market, hawking American
chocolate, British cigarettes, and
Japanese radios to the soldiers.
"The white faces are fewer in
the paddies now, but sales haven't
dropped, not considerably. ARVN
troops, awed by the American
fighting man's efficiency, are
quick to ape his habits.
"I sympathize with these
people, Frank. I, too, was
rebellious as a student many years
ago at the Sorbonne. But the
Occupation taught me
discretion."
"Discretion, hell! What about
respect for your government?"
Demimonde snaps off a square of
a Hershey bar, places it in his
mouth. "It wasn't our
government."
The street is suddenly silent.
The Honda-made automobiles and
buses have vanished. The tourists
and merchants are all indoors.
Only their eyes and nostrils are
visible through the breath-fogged
shop windows.
There is soon the murmur of
footsteps, of sandals. A
procession of people turns the
corner, heads up the street. They
carry hand-painted signs, are
chanting the Vietnamese word for
"peace." Demimonde has to
translate it for Crotch.
The demonstrators support
neither the Communists nor
Thieu. They are Neutralists.
Neutralism is a crime in South
Vietnam. An uncommitted mind
can be dangerous.
"Where the hell's the F-6?"
Crotch's nearly pissing from
exasperation. He remembers his
stint with Operation Phoenix, the
U.S.-sponsored effort to eliminate
the republic's dissident element.
But Phoenix has perished in
the ash of December's last-gasp
scatter bombing. Thieu's
government must now do the job
itself. The specially assigned unit
has taken the code name "F-6."
"Christ, what a break! Every
subversive and his mother's in that
crowd. What are those gooks
waiting for?"
The F-6 forces do not wait
long. They descend from the
rooftops. from Sikorsky
helicopters, beating the
demonstrators with the butts of
M-l rifles. The demonstrators do
not resist. This, Crotch cannot
understand. Demimonde does not
attempt to explain.
