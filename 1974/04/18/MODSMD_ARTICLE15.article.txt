## Bunting Talks On Women's Education 
### WENDY QUINONES 
4 'Co-residence — men and
women students living in the same
dorms — was the most educational
thing that happened in my 12
years at Radcliffe," Mary L.
Bunting, former Radcliffe College
president, told an informal
gathering at Whitman House
Tuesday night.
In her discussion of some
recent trends in education for
women, she seemed to suggest by
this and other examples that
bringing more women into the
educational mainstream has
affected not only how many
women are educated, but also
ideas about what an education
consists of and how it is to be
achieved.
"I was surprised to discover the
importance of co-residence," she
admitted. But questionnaires sent
to Radcliffe women before coed
dorms were established and again
two years later showed significant
changes in relationships among
the women themselves as well as
between women and men.
'The most important change
was that they no longer thought
in stereotypes," Bunting said.
"They no longer answered the
questions by saying, 'Men do this
and women do that.' They
answered in terms of individuals,

of people they knew."
Radcliffe Institute
Many of the changes Bunting
spoke of were the result of one of
her own creations, 'the Radcliffe
Institute. During her years as
pesident of Radcliffe from 1960
to 1972, the Institute attempted
to aid women, particularly mature
women with families, to complete
projects, such as books or
research, which they had no other
way of continuing.
"We tried to find out what it
was they needed to do what they
wanted to do," Bunting
explained, "whether it was a room
of their own or money for a
babysitter."
A major problem confronting
these women wishing to continue
their education, she pointed out,
was the difficulty of doing so on a
part-time basis. One woman who
had completed medical school, for
example, had complained that the
live-in nature of hospital
internships made it impossible for
her to complete one, since she had
two children.
The Institute agreed, and by
paying her expenses, obtained a
part-time internship for her at a
prestigious Boston hospital. She
and the part-time interns who
followed her did so well that
Boston hospitals now themselves

support a program of part-time
internships.
Vassar Graduate
Bunting, a graduate of Vassar
College with a Ph.D. in
agricultural bacteriology (a field
now called microbiology) from
the University of Wisconsin, is
now Assistant to the President of
Princeton University. While she
does not specialize in women's
matters there, she said many of
the same problems exist at
Princeton as at Radcliffe.
She stressed particularly both
the need for and the lack of
models of successful women for
women students to follow. The
Radcliffe Institute schoalrs, while
they had little contact with
undergraduates, seemed to be very
important in this respect.
"The undergraduate women
were amazed to find older women
who really cared about what they
were doing," Bunting said. "It
wasn't such a surprise that they
were doing things — the
undergraduates had seen that
before. But they apparently
hadn't seen women who really
cared about their work."
Faculty Attitude Must Change
But the most necessary change
in the education of women,

according to Bunting, is yet to
come. If women students are to
be successful, particularly in fields
which have traditionally held few
women, she said it is essential that
faculty attitudes change toward
higher expectations of their
women students.
"I don't see enough faculty
really working at choosing women
students," she said, "or at
challenging them once they've
been accepted. Too often they
just let the women students slide
by."
She cited the difference
between letters of
recommendation for men and for
women as another example.
"Letters about women have more
about looks and about relating to
other people than letters about
men. They show great concern
over whether the woman will fit
into a given program or place,"
she said.
"But the letters are static.
They don't have a paragraph
about what they expect her to do
in the future, which may be the
most important paragraph in a
letter of this kind. And it comes
from a real gut feeling that
women aren't going to do much."
