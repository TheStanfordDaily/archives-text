# Saxbe Brands Patricia Hearst 'Common Criminal' After Heist
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - U.S.
Atty. Gen. William Saxbe branded
Patricia Hearst a common criminal
yesterday and a federal grand jury
began considering whether she
willingly wielded a gun in a terrorist
bank robbery.
Saxbe said in Washington he was
convinced the 20-year old newspaper
heiress was "not a reluctant
participant" in the $10,000-robbery
Monday by a heavily armed gang
which wounded two persons in its

getaway.
The terrorist Symbionese
Liberation Army dragged Hearst
screaming from her Berkeley
apartment two and a half months ago.
In a "communique" April 3, she
renounced her family and swore she
had been converted into a
revolutionary fighter.
"It would appear to me that she
was not a reluctant participant in this
robbery," Saxbe told his weekly news
conference, adding that SLA members

all are "common criminals." Asked if
he included Hearst, he said, "Miss
Hearst is a part of it."
Her father, newspaper executive
Randolph A. Hearst, called Saxbe's
comments "speculation" and refused
further comment.
Refuses Comment
Charles Bates, the FBI agent in
charge of the case, also refused
comment other than to say: "The FBI
is continuing its aggressive
investigation looking to a solution of
the Hearst kidnaping case and the
bank robbery."
U.S. Attorney James Browning said
evidence in the bank robbery is being
presented to a grand jury and that
indictments are possible by next week.
"It is entirely possible that the
evidence will show that there was no
duress or coercion on the part of these
people, but that is a matter for the
grand jury to determine," he said.
Guard's Story
According to a guard at the bank,
Edward Shea, Patty took an active
part in the robbery â€”
"giving . . . orders and all that, saying
she would shoot the first guy that
moved.
"She wasn't scared. She let it be
known that she meant business," the
66-year old guard said yesterday. "She
had a gun and looked ready to use it."
Late yesterday, her mother,
Catherine, said she had doubts
whether the woman shown in the bank
robbery photographs actually was her
daughter.
"I could never take an oath the girl
in the pictures was Patty," Mrs. Hearst
said in a statement released through a
family spokesman at her suburban
Hillsborough home. "The person I saw
was terribly thin and drawn and wore
a wig," Mrs. Hearst said, "and since all
her limbs were covered, I really
couldn't tell with any assurance from
her stance it was Patty in the bank
holding that gun."
Colston Westbrook, one of three
persons named in an SLA death list
earlier this month, said he believed
Patty definitely was forced to take
part in the holdup.
