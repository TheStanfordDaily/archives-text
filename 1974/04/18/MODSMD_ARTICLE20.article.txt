# Revised ASSU Course Review Scheduled For Late May Release
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The second edition of the
ASSU Course Review, scheduled
to go on sale about the third week
in May, will differ from its
predecessor in both appearance
and content, according to editors
Ed Harris, Jim Lobsenz and Janet
Roberts.
This year, written reviews will
oe supplemented with statistical
summaries, in order to present an
objective as well as a subjective
view of each course. As a guide to
the interpretation of the statistical
summaries, Lobsenz, editor for
the social sciences, has written an
introduction to the review about
statistics. Lobsenz noted, "I hope
people will read [the
introduction] because it does
make a difference."
To supplement the Review's
other financial resources, the
Review is also soliciting
tdvertisements for the first time,
according to Business Manager
Ann Carter. The amount of
income from the ads is uncertain,
she said, since the Review is still
in the process of getting ads.
Approximately 1500 to 2000
copies of the Course Review will
Je distributed. They will probably
be sold for one dollar each, the
same price as last year's.
In addition to the change in
the format of the Review, the
editors have also made several
changes in procedures and policy.
Questionnaires were sent to
professors via interdepartmental

mail and returned in the same
way, instead of the "door to
door" approach used last year.
More questionnaires were sent
out, and another page asking for
students' written comments was
added to the winter quarter
questionnaire.
Harris, editor for the
humanities, said the main point of
the Course Review is "to provide
a good responsible index of
student opinion.... We're not
out to get back at the professors
â€” that's the last thing we want to
do."
Harris also noted that the
"main thrust of the Course
Review is not to criticize, but to
recommend courses." The
emphasis has been on
"constructive criticism with an
eye on improvement."
The editors have also been
working to coordinate the use of
the ASSU questionnaires with the
use of University questionnaires,
by submitting ASSU course lists
to the registrar's office to prevent
duplication.
James Gibbs, dean of
Undergraduate Studies, echoed
the hope that the ASSU would be
able to work with the
Subcommittee on the Evaluation
of Teaching of the Academic
Council's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and
Achievement to find ways in
which the faculty could use both
ASSU and University

questionnaires, adding that the
subcommittee has agreed to work
with the ASSU on this matter.
Gibbs' only criticism of the
Review was that some reviews in
the first edition tended to placp
"more emphasis on the
personality and style" of the
professors than the questionnaires
had done.
Faculty response is the biggest
problem facing the Course Review
now, according to Harris. Lobsenz
estimated that there had been
about a 70 percent response for
the fall quarter, and a little higher
response for winter quarter. Both
Harris and Lobsenz feel that this
might change as the Course
Review becomes more established.
