# Symphony Presents Noble Bach 'St. Matthew Passion'
## 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
SAN FRANCISCO - A half
dozen world-famous soloists and
the San Francisco Boys Chorus
joined the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra and Chorus
under Seiji Ozawa in a noble
holiday performance of Bach's St.
Matthew Passion, April 10.
The St. Matthew Passion is
Easter music par excellance, and
four all-but-complete
performances during the past
week must have climaxed religious
festivities for many Bay Area
residents. And the sheer musical
beauty of those concerts should
have proved equally climactic for
even non-religious music lovers.
A packed opera house was
slightly surprised when, just
before Wednesday's concert was
scheduled to begin, an orchestra
member requested that no
applause precede or follow the
evening's music.
Great Chorus
Maestro Ozawa and

the principal soloists then
appeared on stage, and the great
opening chorus, warm with rich
string and wind tone, began after
unusual silence.
Edwin Flath prepared his boy
choristers well, and they joined
the Symphony's singers (split in
half for Bach's marvellous
antiphonal writing) at important
moments, breathing fresh, young
life into the Passion Chorale
melody that runs through the
opening choral complexities.
Equally lovely were the
numerous simple, yet subtle
repetitions of the Chorale
throughout the rest of the
Passion; Ozawa let Bach's music
flow freely, pausing only at
particularly poignant places for
emphasis. The final chorale
harmonization, on the famous
words "O Head so Sorely
Wounded," was as touching as it
always is, and always must be.
Lustrous Voice
Soloists Robert Tear, tenor, as
the Evangelist (or narrator), and
baritone Benjamin Luxon as
Jesus, exchanged the bulk of the
evening's recitatives intensely, yet
tenderly. Luxon's lustrous voice,
continuously offset by an aureole
of strings, glowed throughout the
evening, and Tear varied his tone
and expressive vocal gestures
skillfully and with only
momentary loss of full control.
Soprano Edith Mathis sang
several arias clearly, and her
concluding phrases in "Bleed and
Break" were particularly sweet.
Bass Andrew Foldi handled his

single solo competently and
musically.
Contralto Maureen Forrester
and tenor Seth McCoy, however,
outsang the rest of the cast all'
evening. McCoy's aria with choral
interjections, "I Would be with
my Jesus Watching," shone with
that gorgeous phrasing and tone
only the finest tenor voices can
deliver.
Rapturous Violin
'Thy Mercy, Lord, my God"
stood out even among Maureen
Forrester's other triumphs that
evening; concertmaster Stuart
Canin joined her in that number
with a rapturous violin obligatto
that perfectly complimented her
lush, expressive singing.
If any fault at all could be
found with this performance, it
would have to belong to what
some might consider Maestro
Ozawa's occasionally
over-romantic conducting. The
entire Passion was well-paced, and
choral interjections were
appropriately exciting; but the
final ensembles were noticeably
loud and fast â€” a bit disconcerting
to some ears. It was a pity that
several bass arias had to be cut,
even though the concert ran 45
minutes longer than usual.
In addition to the soloists
named above, the following San
Francisco Chorus members played
small but effective parts: James
Tippey was Pilate, Ricardo Cascio
played Judas, Donald McKenzie
sang Peter, Luana De Vol and
Susan Ruesch played two Maids
of Galilee, and Peter Van Derick
was the High Priest.
