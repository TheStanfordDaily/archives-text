# Bluesman Naftalin Performs Tonight
## 
### 
Pianist Mark Naftalin, who appeared last week with Michael
Bloomfield on the bill with Jesse Colin Young in Mem Aud, will
give his third solo blues/rock recital in the Tresidder lounges
tonight at 8 p.m.
Naftalin gave two similar solo concerts here in February and
May of last year. Both were successful, and allowed him a chance
to stretch out, playing and singing blues and boogie woogie with
some rock and roll and country thrown in. Co-starring on the bill,
then as now, was Tresidder's beautiful nine-foot Steinway grand
piano, which Naftalin mentioned as one reason for his return.
A veteran of the influential Paul Butterfield Blues Band,
Naftalin recorded four albums with that band, and has been doing
mostly studio work since. His album credits also include albums
by Nick Gravenites, Brewer and Shipley, Van Morrison, the New
Riders of the Purple Sage, Canned Heat, Quicksilver, Alice Stuart,
John Lee Hooker, James Cotton, Otis Rush, Sam Lay, Willie
Foster, Peter, Paul and Mary, and others.
Naftalin currently makes his home in Marin County, and has
become the resident keyboard man for producer Eliot Mazur at
San Francisco's Alembic Studios. In the last year or so, he has
done recording sessions with Chris Darrow, Dave Torbert (of the
New Riders) and Matt Kelley, Mike D'Abo, Blue, Andy
Fairweather Low, and others. He has mentioned the possibility,
or at least the desire, to record a solo and solo/accompaniment
album under his own name.
