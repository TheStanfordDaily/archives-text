ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN AREN'T DEAD—In fact, Shakespeare's two minor characters
take center stage next Tuesday as the Stanford Department of Drama presents Tom Stoppard's play,
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, opening on Shakespeare's 410 th birthday. Above, Rosencrantz
(Jerold Pearson) learns a painful point from Guildenstern (Peter Moore): man's share in the control of his
own existence is dubious. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern will be performed nightly in the Little TTieater at
8 p.m. April 23-27, and April 30-May 4. All student seats are $1.
