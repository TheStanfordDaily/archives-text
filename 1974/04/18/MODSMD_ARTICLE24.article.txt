# 'The Conversation' Stars Hackman As Desperate Man
## 
### JENNIFER RANDISI 
Ever since the release of The
Godfather in 1972, Francis Ford
Coppola has been a busy man. His
most recent film, The
Conversation, was written,
produced, and directed by
Coppola.
A tragic and disturbing film,
The Conversation focuses on a
bugging expert, Harry Caul (Gene
Hackman), and a series of tapes
recorded for one of his clients.
Reminiscent of Blow-Up and
The iMst Tango in Paris in film
technique and theme, The
Conversation is a complex web of
loneliness and intrigue.
Structurally, the film evolves
spirally through a repetition in
which each circle brings the
viewer closer to a composite
truth. A good equivalent in poetry
would be Wallace Stevens'
'Thirteen Ways of Looking at a
Blackbird."
The two threads of the film
that are constantly re-evaluated
and re-defined are the tapes
themselves (portions of which are
replayed up to five times) and the
personality of Harry Caul.
Although the two are presented as
parallel within the film, the
relationship between the tapes
and Caul's psyche is laced with
levels of irony.
The tapes are recorded
fragments of a conversation, yet
conversation (verbal interaction
with others) is the most difficult
obstacle in Caul's personal life;
the tapes contain a mystery, a
secret that Caul is compelled to
discover, yet the most striking
aspect of Caul's own character is
his paranoia.
The muted, moody tone of

The Conversation is sustained not
only by a musical score composed
of blues and jazz selections, but
also through incisive photographic
techniques. The song "Red Red
Robin," for example, recurs
throughout the film, as do several
parallel (similarly photographed),
scenes involving Caul unlocking
doors and moving in and out of a
static frame that focuses on a
chair in his apartment.
In two particularly effective
sequences, Caul is shown in his
apartment talking to a telephone
operator, and playing saxophone
alone, at night, to a record.
As in The Last Tango in Paris,
colors in The Conversation are
subdued and shaded to intensify
Caul's loneliness and quiet
despair. It is an existential
portrayal of the expressionless
world in which Caul functions as a
tragic outcast.
A good example of this
technique occurs in Caul's visit to
a woman on his birthday. She
doesn't know his age and when
she asks, he lies to her in what has
to be a near-perfect expression of
human pathos: "I'm 42.. . I'm 42
today."
Later in the same scene, the
woman expresses a child-like
excitement that is sharply
undercut by the shabbiness of her
surroundings and the futility of
her relationship with Caul: "When
I heard you unlock the door, my
toes were dancing under the

covers.. .
With only sketchy, fragmented
dialogue, Gene Hackman is superb
in defining the complex character
of Harry Caul. His gestures and
expressions convey the tense
restraint of a man who exists on
the brink of insanity.
Throughout the film, Caul
appears mild-mannered yet
ominous, capable of things that
would surprise him. Religious, to
a certain extent moral, and highly
suspicious, Caul becomes involved
in an intrigue that exists outside
his frame of reference.
As he says at one point in the
film, "I'm not afraid of death. I
am afraid of murder, though."
What began as a routine job
turns into Caul's obsession. As he
puts it, "That's no ordinary
conversation. It makes me feel â€”
something." For anyone who has
seen the film, The Conversation
does just that.
