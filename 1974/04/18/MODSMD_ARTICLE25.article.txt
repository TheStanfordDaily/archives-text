Simon Named Treasury Chief
WASHINGTON — President Nixon nominated federal
energy chief William E. Simon to succeed George Shultz as
Treasury secretary yesterday and moved to reclaim for
himself some of the broad economic powers he had granted
Shultz.
John C. Sawhill, Simon's top deputy, was promoted to
federal energy administrator by Nixon with instructions to
press ahead with the effort to make America self-sufficient
in energy by 1980.
Simon and Sawhill will take over their new posts upon
Simon's confirmation by the Senate. Shultz will then
depart for private life, the last remaining member of
Nixon's original cabinet to leave government service.
In announcing Simon's elevation to the Cabinet post, the
White House said the President "will assume an expanded
role in coordination of economic policy himself."
Deputy Press Secretary Gerald L. Warren said that
Nixon, for example, would become chairman of the
Council on Economic Policy, a position held by Shultz for
more than a year.
He also said Simon would not become chairman of the
Cost of Living Council or the Council on International
Economic Policy, two jobs also held by Shultz.
And Shultz's post as assistant to the President for
economic affairs would remain vacant for the time being,
Warren said.
Stans: Vesco Received No Payoff
NEW YORK — Former Commerce Secretary Maurice H.
Stans testified yesterday that financier Robert L. Vesco
never received a payoff in return for a secret $200,000 cash
contribution to President Nixon's 1972 election campaign.
The former Cabinet member took the witness stand in
his own defense at the federal criminal conspiracy trial in
which he is a codefendant with onetime Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell.
When Vesco made the donation, he was the target of a
massive Securities and Exchange Commission frauds
investigation.
Mitchell and Stans are accused of seeking to impede this
probe in exchange for the $200,000. They are charged with
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury.
Stans said that at the March 8, 1972 meeting in which
the money was pledged, it was he and not Vesco who raised
the matter of the SEC investigation.
Banks-Means Case To Continue
ST. PAUL, Minn. — A federal judge refused to dismiss
charges yesterday against American Indian Movement
leaders Dennis Banks and Russell Means, who are charged in
last year's 71-day takeover of Wounded Knee, S.D.
However, U.S. District Court Judge Fred J. Nichol said
3PC3mc msK xm:

the government could not use any evidence it had acquired
by monitoring the single telephone in the village.
The government had an extension to the telephone at a
roadblock it had set up outside the village.
The judge coupled his order with criticism of the
prosecution and the FBI.
Oakland Panthers Freed
OAKLAND — Fourteen Black Panthers arrested in a raid
and held on $280,000 bail walked out of jail free yesterday
when the district attorneys office failed to file a complaint.
Alameda County Asst. Dist. Atty. John Baldwin said the
14 are still under investigation for alleged conspiracy,
possession of a hand grenade, illegal weapons and dangerous
drugs. But he said they were freed because no complaint
was filed against them within the maximum 24-hour
deadline.
Panther spokeswoman Elaine Brown called the Tuesday
morning raid "an unlawful and a malicious attack. It proved
beyond a doubt that this was a police riot."
She said the Panthers were consulting with their
attorney, Charles Garry, about filing suit against the police
for illegal entry and damages.
Garry said no complaint was filed "because whatever
evidence they have was illegally obtained."
Police armed with a search warrant said they confiscated
several sawed-off shotguns, an automatic rifle, a hand
grenade, ammunition, gas masks, bulletproof vests, a
quantity of marijuana and a bloodied baseball bat.
Reineeke Lists Witnesses
WASHINGTON — California Lt. Gov. Ed Reineeke
informed federal court yesterday he may call Gov. Ronald
Reagan and San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto as
character witnesses in his pending perjury trial.
Reineeke listed former White House Chief of Staff H.R.
Haldeman and Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas among 15
witnesses." Dole is the former chairman of the Republican
National Committee.
The lieutenant governor, a candidate in the June 4
California primary to succeed Reagan, listed the prospective
witnesses in support of a motion to have the trial moved
from Washington to California.
'Zebra' Claims Another Victim
SAN FRANCISCO - Nelson T. Shields IV took
advantage of the spring day to play some lacrosse, then
helped a buddy move a rug.
Moments later the 23-year old son of a DuPont Co.
executive lay dead in the street, three bullets in his back,
the 12th white person killed by a black assailant since Nov.
26 in what police call the Zebra case.
The murder bore strong resemblance to the others in a
wave of apparently unprovoked shootings that has
'errorized residents and left the largest police investigation
in the city's history puzzled. Police labeled the case
"Zebra" after four shooting deaths one night in January.
In less than five months, 12 persons have died and six
have been wounded. In almost every case, the victim was
apparently minding his business at night on a city street
when he or she was gunned down with no warning.

Simon Named Treasury Chief
WASHINGTON — President Nixon nominated federal
energy chief William E. Simon to succeed George Shultz as
Treasury secretary yesterday and moved to reclaim for
himself some of the broad economic powers he had granted
Shultz.
John C. Sawhill, Simon's top deputy, was promoted to
federal energy administrator by Nixon with instructions to
press ahead with the effort to make America self-sufficient
in energy by 1980.
Simon and Sawhill will take over their new posts upon
Simon's confirmation by the Senate. Shultz will then

Nixon's original cabinet to leave government service.
In announcing Simon's elevation to the Cabinet post, the
White House said the President "will assume an expanded
role in coordination of economic policy himself."
Deputy Press Secretary Gerald L. Warren said that
Nixon, for example, would become chairman of the
Council on Economic Policy, a position held by Shultz for
more than a year.
He also said Simon would not become chairman of the
Cost of Living Council or the Council on International
Economic Policy, two jobs also held by Shultz.
And Shultz's post as assistant to the President for
economic affairs would remain vacant for the time being,
Warren said.

NEW YORK — Former Commerce Secretary Maurice H.
Stans testified yesterday that financier Robert L. Vesco
never received a payoff in return for a secret $200,000 cash
contribution to President Nixon's 1972 election campaign.
The former Cabinet member took the witness stand in
his own defense at the federal criminal conspiracy trial in
which he is a codefendant with onetime Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell.
When Vesco made the donation, he was the target of a
massive Securities and Exchange Commission frauds
investigation.
Mitchell and Stans are accused of seeking to impede this
probe in exchange for the $200,000. They are charged with
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury.
Stans said that at the March 8, 1972 meeting in which
the money was pledged, it was he and not Vesco who raised
the matter of the SEC investigation.

attorney, Charles Garry, about filing suit against the police
for illegal entry and damages.
Garry said no complaint was filed "because whatever
evidence they have was illegally obtained."

Oakland Panthers Freed
OAKLAND — Fourteen Black Panthers arrested in a raid
and held on $280,000 bail walked out of jail free yesterday
when the district attorneys office failed to file a complaint.
Alameda County Asst. Dist. Atty. John Baldwin said the
14 are still under investigation for alleged conspiracy,
possession of a hand grenade, illegal weapons and dangerous
drugs. But he said they were freed because no complaint
was filed against them within the maximum 24-hour
deadline.
Panther spokeswoman Elaine Brown called the Tuesday
morning raid "an unlawful and a malicious attack. It proved
beyond a doubt that this was a police riot."
She said the Panthers were consulting with their
attorney, Charles Garry, about filing suit against the police
for illegal entry and damages.
Garry said no complaint was filed "because whatever
evidence they have was illegally obtained."
Police armed with a search warrant said they confiscated
several sawed-off shotguns, an automatic rifle, a hand
grenade, ammunition, gas masks, bulletproof vests, a
quantity of marijuana and a bloodied baseball bat.

'Zebra' Claims Another Victim
SAN FRANCISCO - Nelson T. Shields IV took
advantage of the spring day to play some lacrosse, then
helped a buddy move a rug.
Moments later the 23-year old son of a DuPont Co.
executive lay dead in the street, three bullets in his back,
the 12th white person killed by a black assailant since Nov.
26 in what police call the Zebra case.
The murder bore strong resemblance to the others in a
wave of apparently unprovoked shootings that has
'errorized residents and left the largest police investigation
in the city's history puzzled. Police labeled the case
"Zebra" after four shooting deaths one night in January.
In less than five months, 12 persons have died and six
have been wounded. In almost every case, the victim was
apparently minding his business at night on a city street
when he or she was gunned down with no warning.

Simon Named Treasury Chief
WASHINGTON — President Nixon nominated federal
energy chief William E. Simon to succeed George Shultz as
Treasury secretary yesterday and moved to reclaim for
himself some of the broad economic powers he had granted
Shultz.
John C. Sawhill, Simon's top deputy, was promoted to
federal energy administrator by Nixon with instructions to
press ahead with the effort to make America self-sufficient
in energy by 1980.
Simon and Sawhill will take over their new posts upon
Simon's confirmation by the Senate. Shultz will then
depart for private life, the last remaining member of
Nixon's original cabinet to leave government service.
In announcing Simon's elevation to the Cabinet post, the
White House said the President "will assume an expanded
role in coordination of economic policy himself."
Deputy Press Secretary Gerald L. Warren said that
Nixon, for example, would become chairman of the
Council on Economic Policy, a position held by Shultz for
more than a year.
He also said Simon would not become chairman of the
Cost of Living Council or the Council on International
Economic Policy, two jobs also held by Shultz.
And Shultz's post as assistant to the President for
economic affairs would remain vacant for the time being,
Warren said.
Stans: Vesco Received No Payoff
NEW YORK — Former Commerce Secretary Maurice H.
Stans testified yesterday that financier Robert L. Vesco
never received a payoff in return for a secret $200,000 cash
contribution to President Nixon's 1972 election campaign.
The former Cabinet member took the witness stand in
his own defense at the federal criminal conspiracy trial in
which he is a codefendant with onetime Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell.
When Vesco made the donation, he was the target of a
massive Securities and Exchange Commission frauds
investigation.
Mitchell and Stans are accused of seeking to impede this
probe in exchange for the $200,000. They are charged with
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury.
Stans said that at the March 8, 1972 meeting in which
the money was pledged, it was he and not Vesco who raised
the matter of the SEC investigation.
