# Cowell Offers Sex Counseling
## 
### LOUISE LIBBY 
Students who have questions about
contraception, pregnancy, venereal
disease or other sex-related problems
can turn to a new peer counseling
service at Cowell Health Center
beginning this week.
The drop-in center is located in an
upstairs lounge at Cowell, and a
student counselor is available to talk
anytime between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Students also can make private
appointments with counselors in the
afternoons.
According to Dr. James B.
McClenahan, director of Student
Health Services, the program provides
accessible, confidential, and accurate
information, primarily about
contraception, but also about anything
else that may be troubling a student.
The program was conceived shortly
after the abrupt departure of Cowell's
gynecologist, Dr. Sue Massey, last fall.
At that time, the Student Advisory
Committee and the Women's Task
Force submitted a joint list of
recommendations to McClenahan, one
of which included peer counseling on
con trace otion.
The idea motivating the counseling
service was to shorten "the
contraceptive wait" between
counseling and dispensing
contraceptives, according to Strnad.
Cowell is legally required to counsel
before prescribing contraceptives.

Strnad added that counselors are
prepared to cope with most problems
by referring patients to the
appropriate facilities and doctors in
Cowell.
The 15 counselors in the program
all completed a training program at
Cowell last quarter, and about 15
more are being trained through

SWOPSI 134, taught by Strnad, senior
Anne Simons and a professional
counselor. Simons has been involved in
community agencies such as the
Problem Pregnancy Information
Center in Palo Alto.
The original training program
included two couples and two single
males, as well as single females.
