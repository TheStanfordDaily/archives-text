# ASSU Voting Continues Through This Afternoon
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
Some 1598 students voted
yesterday in the first day of the
Council of Presidents runoff election,
according to ASSU Elections
Commissioner Rick Haskell.
Voting concludes this afternoon
and results will be released by 9:30
tonight, Haskell said.
The polling sites at the Engineering
Corner and the Post Office will be
open today from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The sites at the History Corner,
Physics Tank, and the Business and
Medical Schools will be open from 10
a.m. to 2 p.m.
In addition to electing either the
Mike Herman or 800 Bacon slates as
the new Council, students are voting
on six fee assessments, three ASSU
constitutional amendments and a
resolution inviting imprisoned South
Vietnamese journalist Nguyen Huu
Thai to serve as ASSU guest professor.
In addition, students who will be
seniors next year vote among four
slates running for Senior Class
Officers. The four slates, in order of
appearance on the ballot, are:
— David Antonuccio, Karen Chang,
Rich Gonzales, and Dan Spikes;
— Mark Feinstein, Walt Sinclair,
Angi Bonacquisti, and Sally Vaughn;
— Ray Johnson and Randy Amen;
— and Lise Pfeiffer, Jim Dewell and
Susie Schatzman.

If the constitutional amendments
pass, they will change the dates for the
election of the ASSU Senate and the
Council and create a way to remove
unsatisfactory members of the
Nominations Committee, which
appoints students to other University
committees.
The six fee assessments on the
ballot are for the Stanford chapter of
the Northern California Public Interest
Research Group, the ASSU guest
professorship program, Speakers
Bureau, and Legal Counseling Office,
KZSU and the Stanford Band.
Although only a simple majority of
those voting is required to pass the fee
assessments, 20 percent of the student
body must vote in the election to
make it valid. Based on student
registration figures given by the
Registrar's Office, 2196 students must
vote if any of the measures are to pass.
Haskell was confident that at least
that many students would vote.
An official in the registrar's office
said the number of registered students
reported last week by the Daily was
450 less than were actually registered
because cancellations and Law School
students were not counted.
Consequently, 20.3 percent instead
of the reported 21.0 percent of the
student body voted in the election
which passed the ASSU Program Fee.

Haskell was confident that at least
that many students would vote.
An official in the registrar's office
said the number of registered students
reported last week by the Daily was
450 less than were actually registered
because cancellations and Law School
students were not counted.
Consequently, 20.3 percent instead
of the reported 21.0 percent of the
student body voted in the election
which passed the ASSU Program Fee.
Some 1598 students voted
yesterday in the first day of the
Council of Presidents runoff election,
according to ASSU Elections
Commissioner Rick Haskell.
Voting concludes this afternoon
and results will be released by 9:30
tonight, Haskell said.
The polling sites at the Engineering
Corner and the Post Office will be
open today from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The sites at the History Corner,
Physics Tank, and the Business and
Medical Schools will be open from 10
a.m. to 2 p.m.
In addition to electing either the
Mike Herman or 800 Bacon slates as
the new Council, students are voting
on six fee assessments, three ASSU
constitutional amendments and a
resolution inviting imprisoned South
Vietnamese journalist Nguyen Huu
Thai to serve as ASSU guest professor.
In addition, students who will be
seniors next year vote among four
slates running for Senior Class
Officers. The four slates, in order of
appearance on the ballot, are:
— David Antonuccio, Karen Chang,
Rich Gonzales, and Dan Spikes;
— Mark Feinstein, Walt Sinclair,
Angi Bonacquisti, and Sally Vaughn;
— Ray Johnson and Randy Amen;
— and Lise Pfeiffer, Jim Dewell and
Susie Schatzman.

If the constitutional amendments
pass, they will change the dates for the
election of the ASSU Senate and the
Council and create a way to remove
unsatisfactory members of the
Nominations Committee, which
appoints students to other University
committees.
The six fee assessments on the
ballot are for the Stanford chapter of
the Northern California Public Interest
Research Group, the ASSU guest
professorship program, Speakers
Bureau, and Legal Counseling Office,
KZSU and the Stanford Band.
Although only a simple majority of
those voting is required to pass the fee
assessments, 20 percent of the student
body must vote in the election to
make it valid. Based on student
registration figures given by the
Registrar's Office, 2196 students must
vote if any of the measures are to pass.
