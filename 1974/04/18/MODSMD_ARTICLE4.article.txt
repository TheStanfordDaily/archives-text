# Waldie's Campaign Moves To Palo Alto
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
If the battle for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination were a
walking race, Rep. Jerome Waldie
would be the clear favorite. The
Antioch congressman, who has logged
over 1000 miles on foot in his quest
for the nomination, campaigned along
El Camino from San Mateo to Los
Altos yesterday.
"In all my years of running for
office, I've never found a more
effective way of meeting people and
learning about the state than walking,"
Waldie told the Daily yesterday in
Menlo Park. "It's a great method of
campaigning."
For Waldie, whose longest
campaign walk has been a 30-day hike
from the Mexican border to Santa
Barbara, yesterday's trek formed one
leg of a Bay Area tour that started in
San Francisco on Monday.
"I plan to hit hard on where my
opponents' funding comes from," said
Waldie. "[Edmund] Brown, [Robert]
Moretti, and [Joseph] Alioto are each
spending over a million dollars on the

primary campaign, and they're
publicly boasting about it. I think we
should examine closely where they're
getting it.
Special Interests
"They're being funded by special
interest groups which would be very
demanding after the election. For
example, Moretti got $30,000 from
the race tracks, which can be expected
to exert a lot of pressure," Waldie
predicted.
He explained his support for public
campaign financing: "I think that's the
most critical need facing the country
today. In a democratic country, the
people's interest should decide who
gets elected. It shouldn't make any
difference how much money a
candidate has.
"I have no set policy against
corporate contributions, but I think
it's significant that I haven't been
getting them," said the candidate.
'The big corporations have no reason
to support me; I won't protect their
interests."
