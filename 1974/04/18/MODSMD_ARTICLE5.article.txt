# Chino Committee Blasts Verdict
## 
### BOB LOWE 
"We were surprised that the jury could have spent nine
days with so little evidence against them," John
Junkerman, a member of the Chino Defense Committee
said. "Then they came out with the guilty verdict."
Junkerman spoke at an information meeting in Synergy
House last night about Robert Seabock's and Jean Hobson's
second-degree murder convictions, handed down on
Tuesday, for the death of a prison guard in Ronald Beaty's
1972 escape.
Beaty has been the primary prosecution witness in the
Hobson-Seabock trial and the trial of Andrea and Douglas
Burt, which resulted in second-degree murder convictions
last June.
Stanford Prof. Hal Hoi man, Andrea Burt's father, was
present at the meeting and said his reaction to the recent
verdicts was "one of disappointment. .. from the nature of
the witnesses used in prosecution." He said that Beaty was
an unreliable witness and the supporting evidence was

insufficient and filled with inconsistencies.
Holman also said that both trials were "political." After
the Burts' trial, members of the jury were interviewed by
the defense, according to Holman. "One of the influential
jury members said, 'All I'm interested in is whether they're
capable of it,' " Holman added.
He said that the attitude among the jurors was that
"these people are dangerous and should be taken off the
streets."
Jim Rainie, a Stanford Law School graduate, said that
Beaty attempted to implicate innocent people in an escape
attempt several years ago.
"He did a number of things to cover his ass in this
escape," he said. He added that Beaty "left interesting clues
to implicate these people."
Holman was asked about the chance of successful
appeals in the Burts' and the Hobson-Seabock convictions.
"Probably poor," he said.
