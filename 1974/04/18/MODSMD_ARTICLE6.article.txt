# Former ASSU Politicians Turn Professional
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Midpeninsula politicians often select their young
campaign staffers from those groomed in Stanford's
political playground.
Chris Hocker, class of 1973, twice candidate for ASSU
president, and former editor of the defunct, conservative
publication Stanford Arena, recently quit his job selling
motor homes to sell a product he "believes in" more —
Gordon Knapp. He was hired in January as press secretary
by the Republican congressional candidate challenging
incumbent Paul N. McCloskey Jr. in the primary.
Knapp's campaign manager is Stanford graduate Harvey
Hukari, who founded the Free Campus Movement (FCM)
here in 1969 and also ran twice for ASSU president. Knapp,
an Atherton businessman, also graduated from Stanford.
"Stanford has been called a small training ground" for
prospective politicians, Hukari said. San Francisco attorney
Robert Naylor, currently Knapp's campaign adviser and a
former editor of the Daily, agreed. "My feeling is that
campus politics is strongly valuable preparation . . . After
all, politics in the real world is a game, too."
Making Contacts
Part of the game is making contacts — which both
Hocker and Hukari did successfully while here. Brien
Benson, another campaign adviser to Knapp and head of
publicity at the Hoover Institution, was able to recommend
Hocker because "I was impressed with the quality and
thinking of his writing."
"We both worked on the Arena," said Benson about
Hocker, and"I was Harvey's [Hukari] best man."

Naylor explained, "People you know well are the ones
who come to mind right off the bat when you're trying to
fill a position." He added, "You also want somebody
roughly sympathetic."
'Ideologically Akin'
While Hocker is "ideologically akin" to Knapp, said
Benson, "in no sense, could you say Chris' views are
co-terminous with Knapp's ... Hocker and Knapp have a
fundamental kinship in their skepticism about the ability of
government, particularly the federal government, to solve
social and economic problems with perspicacity and
efficiency."
Hocker said bluntly, "Knapp is the lesser of two
evils ... We have our differences, but I haven't brought
them up with him because they don't belong in this
campaign." In 1972, Hocker voted for McCloskey instead
of Knapp, who ran as a write-in and won a record 19,000
votes. Hocker explained his vote for McCloskey amounted
to a vote against Democrat James Stewart. "Besides," he
said, "I'm not really a McCloskey hater."
"It wasn't one of the happiest votes I've ever cast, but it
wasn't all that upsetting."
Libertarian Party
If Hocker had his choice, he would like to help out the
Libertarian party. "As a group, they best represent what I
believe in — minimal government interference," he said.
"There is some overlapping with the Republican party, of
course." Viewing himself as one with the ability to
publicize ideas, he added, "I'd like to whip those guys

(Libertarians] into shape."
Hukari emphasized that in the Republican primary
"Knapp is clearly the better candidate. I'm closer to him
politically than I've been to others I've worked for," who
include state Senator Milton Marks, a liberal Republican
from San Francisco, and Democratic Supervisor Robert
Gonzalez from San Francisco.
"A total purist will never work for anybody," Hukari
said forthrightly. "Politics is the art of compromise. I've
learned to submerge my own political passions." At the
same time, he contends, "I've always done what I believe in
— whether that will prove to be a political mistake later on,
I can't say."
Apolitical
Much of his work in politics, ironically, has been
apolitical. "So little of what is done has any ideological
connotations, he said. "There are mechanical and technical
problems to be taken care of. Stop signs have to be
changed, and the trash taken off the streets. Everybody
does it whether you're a conservative or a liberal."
"It's a frustrating fact of politics," he concluded, "that
you'll never find somebody [a candidate] you agree with
totally.
"Anybody who gets involved in politics and says he
never wants to run is dishonest," Hukari asserted.
Hukari ran for ASSU president in 1968 and 1970 and
says he has been urged to run for office since then. Hocker
pointed out, "To get involved in ASSU politics you have to
have a certain affinity for politics per se." Participating in

ASSU politics was good educational experience, but not
worth much in practical terms, he decided.
The ASSU presidency is a "free ticket to law school,"
Hukari charged, but Hocker pointed out "it doesn't mean
shit when you try to get a job as assistant campaign
manager." At any rate, Hocker landed himself a position
paying $600 per month. Hukari, with several more years of
experience, is paid $1400.
As for the six slates which competed in this year's ASSU
election, none were "worth a damn," Hocker charged. "The
only regret I have about the type of people running for
ASSU office is that with very few exceptions I have little
respect for them — and that includes the current Council."
Politicians
"Politicians, as a class of people," Hukari generaiized,
"are pretty arrogant, egocentric, petty and superficial"
although he maintains Knapp is an exception. In fact, he
said he worries Knapp does not have the "prerequisite
character deficiencies" to be successful.
While Knapp's greatest challenge is making a name for
himself, McCloskey's trouble is just the opposite, Hocker
speculated. Hukari says polls show the district is polarized
with many Republicans willing to vote for anybody besides
McCloskey.
Furthermore, Hocker conjectured that Democrats may
be either too apathetic or disillusioned to re-register to vote
for McCloskey in the primary.
Watergate has no doubt "crystallized latent anti-political
feeling," Hukari said. Moreover, "it may make it tougher to
find good people to run for office."

Hocker, and"I was Harvey's [Hukari] best man."

Naylor explained, "People you know well are the ones
who come to mind right off the bat when you're trying to
fill a position." He added, "You also want somebody
roughly sympathetic."
'Ideologically Akin'
While Hocker is "ideologically akin" to Knapp, said
Benson, "in no sense, could you say Chris' views are
co-terminous with Knapp's ... Hocker and Knapp have a
fundamental kinship in their skepticism about the ability of
government, particularly the federal government, to solve
social and economic problems with perspicacity and
efficiency."
Hocker said bluntly, "Knapp is the lesser of two
evils ... We have our differences, but I haven't brought
them up with him because they don't belong in this
campaign." In 1972, Hocker voted for McCloskey instead
of Knapp, who ran as a write-in and won a record 19,000
votes. Hocker explained his vote for McCloskey amounted
to a vote against Democrat James Stewart. "Besides," he
said, "I'm not really a McCloskey hater."
"It wasn't one of the happiest votes I've ever cast, but it
wasn't all that upsetting."
Libertarian Party
If Hocker had his choice, he would like to help out the
Libertarian party. "As a group, they best represent what I
believe in — minimal government interference," he said.
"There is some overlapping with the Republican party, of
course." Viewing himself as one with the ability to
publicize ideas, he added, "I'd like to whip those guys

(Libertarians] into shape."
Hukari emphasized that in the Republican primary
"Knapp is clearly the better candidate. I'm closer to him
politically than I've been to others I've worked for," who
include state Senator Milton Marks, a liberal Republican
from San Francisco, and Democratic Supervisor Robert
Gonzalez from San Francisco.
"A total purist will never work for anybody," Hukari
said forthrightly. "Politics is the art of compromise. I've
learned to submerge my own political passions." At the
same time, he contends, "I've always done what I believe in
— whether that will prove to be a political mistake later on,
I can't say."
Apolitical
Much of his work in politics, ironically, has been
apolitical. "So little of what is done has any ideological
connotations, he said. "There are mechanical and technical
problems to be taken care of. Stop signs have to be
changed, and the trash taken off the streets. Everybody
does it whether you're a conservative or a liberal."
"It's a frustrating fact of politics," he concluded, "that
you'll never find somebody [a candidate] you agree with
totally.
"Anybody who gets involved in politics and says he
never wants to run is dishonest," Hukari asserted.
Hukari ran for ASSU president in 1968 and 1970 and
says he has been urged to run for office since then. Hocker
pointed out, "To get involved in ASSU politics you have to
have a certain affinity for politics per se." Participating in

ASSU politics was good educational experience, but not
worth much in practical terms, he decided.
The ASSU presidency is a "free ticket to law school,"
Hukari charged, but Hocker pointed out "it doesn't mean
shit when you try to get a job as assistant campaign
manager." At any rate, Hocker landed himself a position
paying $600 per month. Hukari, with several more years of
experience, is paid $1400.
As for the six slates which competed in this year's ASSU
election, none were "worth a damn," Hocker charged. "The
only regret I have about the type of people running for
ASSU office is that with very few exceptions I have little
respect for them — and that includes the current Council."
Politicians
"Politicians, as a class of people," Hukari generaiized,
"are pretty arrogant, egocentric, petty and superficial"
although he maintains Knapp is an exception. In fact, he
said he worries Knapp does not have the "prerequisite
character deficiencies" to be successful.
While Knapp's greatest challenge is making a name for
himself, McCloskey's trouble is just the opposite, Hocker
speculated. Hukari says polls show the district is polarized
with many Republicans willing to vote for anybody besides
McCloskey.
Furthermore, Hocker conjectured that Democrats may
be either too apathetic or disillusioned to re-register to vote
for McCloskey in the primary.
Watergate has no doubt "crystallized latent anti-political
feeling," Hukari said. Moreover, "it may make it tougher to
find good people to run for office."
Midpeninsula politicians often select their young
campaign staffers from those groomed in Stanford's
political playground.
Chris Hocker, class of 1973, twice candidate for ASSU
president, and former editor of the defunct, conservative
publication Stanford Arena, recently quit his job selling
motor homes to sell a product he "believes in" more —
Gordon Knapp. He was hired in January as press secretary
by the Republican congressional candidate challenging
incumbent Paul N. McCloskey Jr. in the primary.
Knapp's campaign manager is Stanford graduate Harvey
Hukari, who founded the Free Campus Movement (FCM)
here in 1969 and also ran twice for ASSU president. Knapp,
an Atherton businessman, also graduated from Stanford.
"Stanford has been called a small training ground" for
prospective politicians, Hukari said. San Francisco attorney
Robert Naylor, currently Knapp's campaign adviser and a
former editor of the Daily, agreed. "My feeling is that
campus politics is strongly valuable preparation . . . After
all, politics in the real world is a game, too."

Part of the game is making contacts — which both
Hocker and Hukari did successfully while here. Brien

Libertarian party. "As a group, they best represent what I
believe in — minimal government interference," he said.
"There is some overlapping with the Republican party, of
course." Viewing himself as one with the ability to
publicize ideas, he added, "I'd like to whip those guys

(Libertarians] into shape."
Hukari emphasized that in the Republican primary
"Knapp is clearly the better candidate. I'm closer to him
politically than I've been to others I've worked for," who
include state Senator Milton Marks, a liberal Republican
from San Francisco, and Democratic Supervisor Robert
Gonzalez from San Francisco.
"A total purist will never work for anybody," Hukari
said forthrightly. "Politics is the art of compromise. I've
learned to submerge my own political passions." At the
same time, he contends, "I've always done what I believe in
— whether that will prove to be a political mistake later on,
I can't say."
Apolitical
Much of his work in politics, ironically, has been
apolitical. "So little of what is done has any ideological
connotations, he said. "There are mechanical and technical
problems to be taken care of. Stop signs have to be
changed, and the trash taken off the streets. Everybody
does it whether you're a conservative or a liberal."
"It's a frustrating fact of politics," he concluded, "that
you'll never find somebody [a candidate] you agree with
totally.
"Anybody who gets involved in politics and says he
never wants to run is dishonest," Hukari asserted.
Hukari ran for ASSU president in 1968 and 1970 and
says he has been urged to run for office since then. Hocker
pointed out, "To get involved in ASSU politics you have to
have a certain affinity for politics per se." Participating in

ASSU politics was good educational experience, but not
worth much in practical terms, he decided.
The ASSU presidency is a "free ticket to law school,"
Hukari charged, but Hocker pointed out "it doesn't mean
shit when you try to get a job as assistant campaign
manager." At any rate, Hocker landed himself a position
paying $600 per month. Hukari, with several more years of
experience, is paid $1400.
As for the six slates which competed in this year's ASSU
election, none were "worth a damn," Hocker charged. "The
only regret I have about the type of people running for
ASSU office is that with very few exceptions I have little
respect for them — and that includes the current Council."
Politicians
"Politicians, as a class of people," Hukari generaiized,
"are pretty arrogant, egocentric, petty and superficial"
although he maintains Knapp is an exception. In fact, he
said he worries Knapp does not have the "prerequisite
character deficiencies" to be successful.
While Knapp's greatest challenge is making a name for
himself, McCloskey's trouble is just the opposite, Hocker
speculated. Hukari says polls show the district is polarized
with many Republicans willing to vote for anybody besides
McCloskey.
Furthermore, Hocker conjectured that Democrats may
be either too apathetic or disillusioned to re-register to vote
for McCloskey in the primary.
Watergate has no doubt "crystallized latent anti-political
feeling," Hukari said. Moreover, "it may make it tougher to
find good people to run for office."
Midpeninsula politicians often select their young
campaign staffers from those groomed in Stanford's
political playground.
Chris Hocker, class of 1973, twice candidate for ASSU
president, and former editor of the defunct, conservative
publication Stanford Arena, recently quit his job selling
motor homes to sell a product he "believes in" more —
Gordon Knapp. He was hired in January as press secretary
by the Republican congressional candidate challenging
incumbent Paul N. McCloskey Jr. in the primary.
Knapp's campaign manager is Stanford graduate Harvey
Hukari, who founded the Free Campus Movement (FCM)
here in 1969 and also ran twice for ASSU president. Knapp,
an Atherton businessman, also graduated from Stanford.
"Stanford has been called a small training ground" for
prospective politicians, Hukari said. San Francisco attorney
Robert Naylor, currently Knapp's campaign adviser and a
former editor of the Daily, agreed. "My feeling is that
campus politics is strongly valuable preparation . . . After
all, politics in the real world is a game, too."
Making Contacts
Part of the game is making contacts — which both
Hocker and Hukari did successfully while here. Brien
Benson, another campaign adviser to Knapp and head of
publicity at the Hoover Institution, was able to recommend
Hocker because "I was impressed with the quality and
thinking of his writing."
"We both worked on the Arena," said Benson about
Hocker, and"I was Harvey's [Hukari] best man."

Naylor explained, "People you know well are the ones
who come to mind right off the bat when you're trying to
fill a position." He added, "You also want somebody
roughly sympathetic."
'Ideologically Akin'
While Hocker is "ideologically akin" to Knapp, said
Benson, "in no sense, could you say Chris' views are
co-terminous with Knapp's ... Hocker and Knapp have a
fundamental kinship in their skepticism about the ability of
government, particularly the federal government, to solve
social and economic problems with perspicacity and
efficiency."
Hocker said bluntly, "Knapp is the lesser of two
evils ... We have our differences, but I haven't brought
them up with him because they don't belong in this
campaign." In 1972, Hocker voted for McCloskey instead
of Knapp, who ran as a write-in and won a record 19,000
votes. Hocker explained his vote for McCloskey amounted
to a vote against Democrat James Stewart. "Besides," he
said, "I'm not really a McCloskey hater."
"It wasn't one of the happiest votes I've ever cast, but it
wasn't all that upsetting."
