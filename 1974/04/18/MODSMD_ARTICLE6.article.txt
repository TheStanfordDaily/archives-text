# Former ASSU Politicians Turn Professional
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Midpeninsula politicians often select their young
campaign staffers from those groomed in Stanford's
political playground.
Chris Hocker, class of 1973, twice candidate for ASSU
president, and former editor of the defunct, conservative
publication Stanford Arena, recently quit his job selling
motor homes to sell a product he "believes in" more —
Gordon Knapp. He was hired in January as press secretary
by the Republican congressional candidate challenging
incumbent Paul N. McCloskey Jr. in the primary.
Knapp's campaign manager is Stanford graduate Harvey
Hukari, who founded the Free Campus Movement (FCM)
here in 1969 and also ran twice for ASSU president. Knapp,
an Atherton businessman, also graduated from Stanford.
"Stanford has been called a small training ground" for
prospective politicians, Hukari said. San Francisco attorney
Robert Naylor, currently Knapp's campaign adviser and a
former editor of the Daily, agreed. "My feeling is that
campus politics is strongly valuable preparation . . . After
all, politics in the real world is a game, too."
Making Contacts
Part of the game is making contacts — which both
Hocker and Hukari did successfully while here. Brien
Benson, another campaign adviser to Knapp and head of
publicity at the Hoover Institution, was able to recommend
Hocker because "I was impressed with the quality and
thinking of his writing."
"We both worked on the Arena," said Benson about
Hocker, and"I was Harvey's [Hukari] best man."

Naylor explained, "People you know well are the ones
who come to mind right off the bat when you're trying to
fill a position." He added, "You also want somebody
roughly sympathetic."
'Ideologically Akin'
While Hocker is "ideologically akin" to Knapp, said
Benson, "in no sense, could you say Chris' views are
co-terminous with Knapp's ... Hocker and Knapp have a
fundamental kinship in their skepticism about the ability of
government, particularly the federal government, to solve
social and economic problems with perspicacity and
efficiency."
Hocker said bluntly, "Knapp is the lesser of two
evils ... We have our differences, but I haven't brought
them up with him because they don't belong in this
campaign." In 1972, Hocker voted for McCloskey instead
of Knapp, who ran as a write-in and won a record 19,000
votes. Hocker explained his vote for McCloskey amounted
to a vote against Democrat James Stewart. "Besides," he
said, "I'm not really a McCloskey hater."
"It wasn't one of the happiest votes I've ever cast, but it
wasn't all that upsetting."
Libertarian Party
If Hocker had his choice, he would like to help out the
Libertarian party. "As a group, they best represent what I
believe in — minimal government interference," he said.
"There is some overlapping with the Republican party, of
course." Viewing himself as one with the ability to
publicize ideas, he added, "I'd like to whip those guys
