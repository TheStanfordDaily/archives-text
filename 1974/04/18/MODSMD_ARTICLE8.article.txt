First Grade Hike
Editor:
On our Walk to the hill we saw
the Stanford creek. We had a
tiring but long Walk to the French
Man's hill. From the top of the
hill We saw the bay, and there was
somebody who tried to work a
video tape recorder and they
asked a lot of people to help
figure out how to work it but
nobody knew how. Dr. Jones
came with us he is Our Principal
of Escondido School. We flew
kites and we played tag in the
long grass. We ran down and tried
to get other kids to play tag. We
ate lunch at the top of the French
Man's Hill.

Unusual Honesty
Editor:
As a faculty child on the
campus from 1914 into the
19305, I remember with pleasure
the openness and honesty of
Stanford. You could leave your
books on a windowsill on the
Quad and find them there two
weeks later; slide rule too.
The Honor Code wasn't
something you signed, it was
something you did automatically.
Nobody dreamed of a bicycle lock.
Nowadays the heavy bike
chains and similar symptoms of
predators abroad make me sorrow
for the "olden times."
Last Sunday I lost my wallet at
the Flicks. Someone unknown
picked it up and turned it in. The
box office staff held it for me,
and returned it complete with my
Sunday Flicks passes, my credit
cards and my cash, all intact.
I am very grateful to them, not
only for the wallet and its
contents but even more for
returning to me the feeling that
Stanford is indeed a place of
uncommonly decent people.
Thank you.

Most prelaw undergraduates
have few opportunities before
actually attending law school to
test their talents and temperament
against the requirements of legal
work. For many of us it is not
until we have graduated from law
school that law becomes anything
more than an academic
abstraction and a cerebral
exercise.
In part to fulfill the need of
pre-law undergraduates for
experience in legal work and for
involvement in the pressing,
concrete legal problems of real
people, the Prison Information
Center offers a legal assistance
program to California-state
prisoners. The program is
currently staffed by an attorney,
several law students and half a
dozen undergraduates.

Prisoners write us for
information on everything from
how to get a divorce while
incarcerated to how to file a
petition: the volunteers meet in
small groups for a few hours a
month to discuss the prisoners'
letters and to decide how best to
answer each prisoner's request.
Because of the large volume
of mail that we receive from
prisoners and because of broad
student interest in the legal
profession, the Prison Information
Center is anxious to expand its
legal assistance program. With
more help from undergraduates
we could answer a larger number
of letters in greater depth and
could develop our skills at reading
and effectively interpreting and
summarizing legal cases.
If you are interested in gaining
some legal experience and would
like to work with us, please
contact Margaret Bullitt at
324-1368 (leave a message if
necessary).
Or you can come to our
weekly meetings at noon every
Wednesday in the PIC office,
located in the Old Firehouse
behind Tresidder Union.

Editor:
The past year has been full of
political turmoil of the most
serious kind, and only very
recently this turmoil has reached
California politics with the
indictment of Lieutenant
Governor Ed Reinecke.
Happily, those of us who have
had to endure eight long years of
Governor Ronald Reagan have an
opportunity this June to bring
about substantial change in state
government.
I write this opinion in support
of William Matson Roth, a
Democratic candidate for
governor , who has impressed me
as being of the highest integrity.
We have formed a campus
organization of students and staff,
the Stanford Community for
Roth, and we urge your interest in
this very important June primary,
and hopefully, in our candidate.
Bill Roth has a very impressive
list of qualifications. As a Regent
of the University of California, he
led the fight against the regressive
educational policies of Ronald
Reagan, including exclusively high
tuition.
Mr. Roth has held high office
in the American Civil Liberties
Union, the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations, and in numerous
conservation organizations, long
before it was "cool" to do so.
His stands on various issues
together with his very excellent
record as an educator, diplomat,
and civil libertarian, make Bill
Roth a man worthy of the
support of this community. Please
contact the Roth Headquarters in
Palo Alto at 322-6223 if we can
supply any additional information
to you.

have few opportunities before
actually attending law school to
test their talents and temperament
against the requirements of legal
work. For many of us it is not
until we have graduated from law
school that law becomes anything
more than an academic
abstraction and a cerebral
exercise.
In part to fulfill the need of
pre-law undergraduates for
experience in legal work and for
involvement in the pressing,
concrete legal problems of real
people, the Prison Information
Center offers a legal assistance
program to California-state
prisoners. The program is
currently staffed by an attorney,
several law students and half a
dozen undergraduates.

Prisoners write us for
information on everything from
how to get a divorce while
incarcerated to how to file a
petition: the volunteers meet in
small groups for a few hours a
month to discuss the prisoners'
letters and to decide how best to
answer each prisoner's request.
Because of the large volume
of mail that we receive from
prisoners and because of broad
student interest in the legal
profession, the Prison Information
Center is anxious to expand its
legal assistance program. With
more help from undergraduates
we could answer a larger number
of letters in greater depth and
could develop our skills at reading
and effectively interpreting and
summarizing legal cases.
If you are interested in gaining
some legal experience and would
like to work with us, please
contact Margaret Bullitt at
324-1368 (leave a message if
necessary).
Or you can come to our
weekly meetings at noon every
Wednesday in the PIC office,
located in the Old Firehouse
behind Tresidder Union.

The past year has been full of
political turmoil of the most
serious kind, and only very
recently this turmoil has reached
California politics with the
indictment of Lieutenant
Governor Ed Reinecke.
Happily, those of us who have
had to endure eight long years of
Governor Ronald Reagan have an
opportunity this June to bring
about substantial change in state
government.
I write this opinion in support
of William Matson Roth, a
Democratic candidate for
governor , who has impressed me
as being of the highest integrity.
We have formed a campus
organization of students and staff,
the Stanford Community for
Roth, and we urge your interest in
this very important June primary,
and hopefully, in our candidate.
Bill Roth has a very impressive
list of qualifications. As a Regent
of the University of California, he
led the fight against the regressive
educational policies of Ronald
Reagan, including exclusively high
tuition.
Mr. Roth has held high office
in the American Civil Liberties
Union, the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations, and in numerous
conservation organizations, long
before it was "cool" to do so.
His stands on various issues
together with his very excellent
record as an educator, diplomat,
and civil libertarian, make Bill
Roth a man worthy of the
support of this community. Please
contact the Roth Headquarters in
Palo Alto at 322-6223 if we can
supply any additional information
to you.

On our Walk to the hill we saw
the Stanford creek. We had a
tiring but long Walk to the French
Man's hill. From the top of the
hill We saw the bay, and there was
somebody who tried to work a
video tape recorder and they
asked a lot of people to help
figure out how to work it but
nobody knew how. Dr. Jones
came with us he is Our Principal
of Escondido School. We flew
kites and we played tag in the
long grass. We ran down and tried
to get other kids to play tag. We
ate lunch at the top of the French
Man's Hill.

Editor:
As a faculty child on the
campus from 1914 into the
19305, I remember with pleasure
the openness and honesty of
Stanford. You could leave your
books on a windowsill on the
Quad and find them there two
weeks later; slide rule too.
The Honor Code wasn't
something you signed, it was
something you did automatically.
Nobody dreamed of a bicycle lock.
Nowadays the heavy bike
chains and similar symptoms of
predators abroad make me sorrow
for the "olden times."
Last Sunday I lost my wallet at
the Flicks. Someone unknown
picked it up and turned it in. The
box office staff held it for me,
and returned it complete with my
Sunday Flicks passes, my credit
cards and my cash, all intact.
I am very grateful to them, not
only for the wallet and its
contents but even more for
returning to me the feeling that
Stanford is indeed a place of
uncommonly decent people.
Thank you.

Governor Ed Reinecke.
Happily, those of us who have
had to endure eight long years of
Governor Ronald Reagan have an
opportunity this June to bring
about substantial change in state
government.
I write this opinion in support
of William Matson Roth, a
Democratic candidate for
governor , who has impressed me
as being of the highest integrity.
We have formed a campus
organization of students and staff,
the Stanford Community for
Roth, and we urge your interest in
this very important June primary,
and hopefully, in our candidate.
Bill Roth has a very impressive
list of qualifications. As a Regent
of the University of California, he
led the fight against the regressive
educational policies of Ronald
Reagan, including exclusively high
tuition.
Mr. Roth has held high office
in the American Civil Liberties
Union, the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations, and in numerous
conservation organizations, long
before it was "cool" to do so.
His stands on various issues
together with his very excellent
record as an educator, diplomat,
and civil libertarian, make Bill
Roth a man worthy of the
support of this community. Please
contact the Roth Headquarters in
Palo Alto at 322-6223 if we can
supply any additional information
to you.

First Grade Hike
Editor:
On our Walk to the hill we saw
the Stanford creek. We had a
tiring but long Walk to the French
Man's hill. From the top of the
hill We saw the bay, and there was
somebody who tried to work a
video tape recorder and they
asked a lot of people to help
figure out how to work it but
nobody knew how. Dr. Jones
came with us he is Our Principal
of Escondido School. We flew
kites and we played tag in the
long grass. We ran down and tried
to get other kids to play tag. We
ate lunch at the top of the French
Man's Hill.

Unusual Honesty
Editor:
As a faculty child on the
campus from 1914 into the
19305, I remember with pleasure
the openness and honesty of
Stanford. You could leave your
books on a windowsill on the
Quad and find them there two
weeks later; slide rule too.
The Honor Code wasn't
something you signed, it was
something you did automatically.
Nobody dreamed of a bicycle lock.
Nowadays the heavy bike
chains and similar symptoms of
predators abroad make me sorrow
for the "olden times."
Last Sunday I lost my wallet at
the Flicks. Someone unknown
picked it up and turned it in. The
box office staff held it for me,
and returned it complete with my
Sunday Flicks passes, my credit
cards and my cash, all intact.
I am very grateful to them, not
only for the wallet and its
contents but even more for
returning to me the feeling that
Stanford is indeed a place of
uncommonly decent people.
Thank you.

PIC Program
Editor:
Most prelaw undergraduates
have few opportunities before
actually attending law school to
test their talents and temperament
against the requirements of legal
work. For many of us it is not
until we have graduated from law
school that law becomes anything
more than an academic
abstraction and a cerebral
exercise.
In part to fulfill the need of
pre-law undergraduates for
experience in legal work and for
involvement in the pressing,
concrete legal problems of real
people, the Prison Information
Center offers a legal assistance
program to California-state
prisoners. The program is
currently staffed by an attorney,
several law students and half a
dozen undergraduates.

Prisoners write us for
information on everything from
how to get a divorce while
incarcerated to how to file a
petition: the volunteers meet in
small groups for a few hours a
month to discuss the prisoners'
letters and to decide how best to
answer each prisoner's request.
Because of the large volume
of mail that we receive from
prisoners and because of broad
student interest in the legal
profession, the Prison Information
Center is anxious to expand its
legal assistance program. With
more help from undergraduates
we could answer a larger number
of letters in greater depth and
could develop our skills at reading
and effectively interpreting and
summarizing legal cases.
If you are interested in gaining
some legal experience and would
like to work with us, please
contact Margaret Bullitt at
324-1368 (leave a message if
necessary).
Or you can come to our
weekly meetings at noon every
Wednesday in the PIC office,
located in the Old Firehouse
behind Tresidder Union.
