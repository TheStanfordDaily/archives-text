# Academic Statement Policy OK'd
## 
### DON COX 
Faculty members' rights were
tentatively defined and documented
yesterday as the Faculty Senate passed
without dissent the Statement on
Academic Freedom.
If the statement is not vetoed by
the Academic Council, President
Lyman or the Board of Trustees, it
will become official policy.
The statement dictates that key
academic and administrative decisions
concerning faculty members are to be
made "without regard to a person's
political, social or other views."
It includes special emphasis on the
need for the internal resolution of
faculty members' grievances rather
than recourse to the courts.
The statement outlines procedures
for the resolution of grievances
whereby the grievance could be
appealed successively from the
immediate administrative unit to the
departmental chairman, the school's
dean, the Provost, the Advisory Board
and the President, who would make
the final decision.
Ultimate Authority
Lengthy debate in yesterday's
Senate meeting centered around the
definition of the President as the
ultimate authority in the appeal
process.
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Bernard Roth suggested that binding
arbitration mediated by a disinterested
party could be used to resolve
grievances.
Provost William Miller objected to
the possible intervention of outside
mediators and said "the faculty should
retain the authority and the
responsibility" in decisions of this
kind.
"I cannot see your almost
passionate desire to remove yourself
from professional status" by allowing
anyone other than the faculty to make
the decision, President Lyman said.
'No Restrictions'
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a
member of the statement's floor
management committee, noted that

president of the University of Rhode Island next August, Rhode ikand's Board
of Regents announced yesterday.
"there are no restrictions at all" to
prevent a faculty member's recourse to
the courts.
Vice Provost Robert Rosenzweig
said, "there is no way to keep the
President out of the resolution of
grievances," since he is the
representative of the Board of Trustees
running the University.
"Call that raw power, but that is an
aspect of the situation and that aspect
can't be changed," he said.
The real authority and the ultimate
stopping point is the University's
charter, which is "unassailable," said
Humanities Prof. William Clebsch.
Faculty Rights
The Senate then voted on
amendments to the statement offered
by Roth. Roth sought in his
amendments to define more broadly

the rights of faculty members.
"We should enunciate in the
broadest way possible the concept of
academic freedom," said Assoc.
Medical Microbiology Prof. Leon
Rosenberg.
The statement is "a very, very
guarded statement of the endorsement
of civil rights," he said.
The Senate voted overwhelmingly
to reject Roth's amendments and an
amendment by Classics Prof. Ronald
Mellor to make the Advisory Board
the ultimate authority in grievance
procedures. It voted to adopt the
statement and adjourned.

The Senate voted overwhelmingly
to reject Roth's amendments and an
amendment by Classics Prof. Ronald
Mellor to make the Advisory Board
the ultimate authority in grievance
procedures. It voted to adopt the
statement and adjourned.
Faculty members' rights were
tentatively defined and documented
yesterday as the Faculty Senate passed
without dissent the Statement on
Academic Freedom.
If the statement is not vetoed by
the Academic Council, President
Lyman or the Board of Trustees, it
will become official policy.
The statement dictates that key
academic and administrative decisions
concerning faculty members are to be
made "without regard to a person's
political, social or other views."
It includes special emphasis on the
need for the internal resolution of
faculty members' grievances rather
than recourse to the courts.
The statement outlines procedures
for the resolution of grievances
whereby the grievance could be
appealed successively from the
immediate administrative unit to the
departmental chairman, the school's
dean, the Provost, the Advisory Board
and the President, who would make
the final decision.
Ultimate Authority
Lengthy debate in yesterday's
Senate meeting centered around the
definition of the President as the
ultimate authority in the appeal
process.
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Bernard Roth suggested that binding
arbitration mediated by a disinterested
party could be used to resolve
grievances.
Provost William Miller objected to
the possible intervention of outside
mediators and said "the faculty should
retain the authority and the
responsibility" in decisions of this
kind.
"I cannot see your almost
passionate desire to remove yourself
from professional status" by allowing
anyone other than the faculty to make
the decision, President Lyman said.
'No Restrictions'
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a
member of the statement's floor
management committee, noted that

president of the University of Rhode Island next August, Rhode ikand's Board
of Regents announced yesterday.
"there are no restrictions at all" to
prevent a faculty member's recourse to
the courts.
Vice Provost Robert Rosenzweig
said, "there is no way to keep the
President out of the resolution of
grievances," since he is the
representative of the Board of Trustees
running the University.
"Call that raw power, but that is an
aspect of the situation and that aspect
can't be changed," he said.
The real authority and the ultimate
stopping point is the University's
charter, which is "unassailable," said
Humanities Prof. William Clebsch.
Faculty Rights
The Senate then voted on
amendments to the statement offered
by Roth. Roth sought in his
amendments to define more broadly

the rights of faculty members.
"We should enunciate in the
broadest way possible the concept of
academic freedom," said Assoc.
Medical Microbiology Prof. Leon
Rosenberg.
The statement is "a very, very
guarded statement of the endorsement
of civil rights," he said.
