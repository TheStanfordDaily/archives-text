# Academic Statement Policy OK'd
## 
### DON COX 
Faculty members' rights were
tentatively defined and documented
yesterday as the Faculty Senate passed
without dissent the Statement on
Academic Freedom.
If the statement is not vetoed by
the Academic Council, President
Lyman or the Board of Trustees, it
will become official policy.
The statement dictates that key
academic and administrative decisions
concerning faculty members are to be
made "without regard to a person's
political, social or other views."
It includes special emphasis on the
need for the internal resolution of
faculty members' grievances rather
than recourse to the courts.
The statement outlines procedures
for the resolution of grievances
whereby the grievance could be
appealed successively from the
immediate administrative unit to the
departmental chairman, the school's
dean, the Provost, the Advisory Board
and the President, who would make
the final decision.
Ultimate Authority
Lengthy debate in yesterday's
Senate meeting centered around the
definition of the President as the
ultimate authority in the appeal
process.
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Bernard Roth suggested that binding
arbitration mediated by a disinterested
party could be used to resolve
grievances.
Provost William Miller objected to
the possible intervention of outside
mediators and said "the faculty should
retain the authority and the
responsibility" in decisions of this
kind.
"I cannot see your almost
passionate desire to remove yourself
from professional status" by allowing
anyone other than the faculty to make
the decision, President Lyman said.
'No Restrictions'
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a
member of the statement's floor
management committee, noted that
