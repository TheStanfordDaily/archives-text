# Educational Tax Deduction Needed
## 
### 
Antony Ruprecht

Since 1969, students at Wichita State
University considered various ways and
means to offset the soaring costs of
educational expenses. We concluded from
these discussions a carefully directed use of
tax relief is perhaps the most effective form
of government assistance to higher education.
First, it does not require the creation of
cumbersome and costly bureaucratic
machinery. Second, it avoids controversy
over Government determinations as to the
institutional beneficiaries of Federal support.
Is there a need for Federal Tax Credit to
counter higher educational expenses? Those
with children know that education costs are a
grim reality. The prospects are even more
alarming, however, when we consider that
while the price of a college education has
mounted considerably over the past few
years, no relief is yet in sight.
It appears that tuition hikes and a general
increase in other educational expenses are
something with which we shall have to -live
for some time to come. In the light of this
situation the Federal Tax Deduction would
be the most appropriate way to help the
hard-pressed middle- and lower-income
taxpayer.
Tuition Tax Credit
Our investigation reveals that the tuition
tax credit meets the needs of most
Americans. The merits of the tuition tax
credit are:
First. Two-thirds of the benefits would go
to families earning less than $15,000 a year.
A special provision cuts out the wealthy
entirely.
Second. The tuition tax deduction would
provide substantial lessening of pressures on
existing scholarship funds and would

encourage the giving of scholarships by
individual to designated deserving students.
Third. The tax credit formula is weighted
in favor of the public and land-grant colleges.
The deduction will be based on 100 percent
of the first $300 of tuition fees and book
costs, 25 percent of the next $300, but only
five percent of the next $1000 of such costs.
Thus, the lower-tuition schools get a higher
percentage of benefits.
Fourth. Tuition tax credit allows the
taxpayer to use a part of his own gross
earnings to pay for his own education or that
of his children.
Deduction Needed
The increasing facts of education reveal
the need for the deduction.
First. The number of students working
toward undergraduate or graduate degrees
has tripled in the last 15 years. One of every
two citizens between the ages of 18 and 21 is
a student.
Second. The cost of higher education is
increasing rapidly. Between 1958 and 1968,
there was a 34 percent increase in the tuition
rates at public institutions of higher
education, and a 59 percent increase in the
tuition rates at private institutions of higher
learning. It is projected that during the next
decade there will be another 25 percent
increase in the former and a 38 percent
increase in the latter.
Third. Because private Institutions of
Higher Learning are especially in need of
funds, their tuitions have been rising far more
rapidly than public IHL. A result has been an
excessive burden placed on public IHL in
terms of student population. By the late
19705, 80 to 90 percent of the student
population will have to be in public IHL

which are paid for by taxpayers.
Poor Fund Distribution
Fourth. Present Federal funds to IHL are
poorly distributed. About 90 percent of
Federal funds go to only five percent of IHL.
Fifth. Tuition tax deductions have won
the support of large segments of the public.
In 1968 and 1971, a nationwide survey by
Better Homes and Gardens revealed that
almost 75 percent of the 300,000 persons
interviewed consider college expenses so
basic that they should be deducted from
Federal income tax returns. The Citizens
National Committee on Higher Education
distributed a questionnaire to the president
and trustees of all public and private
institutions of higher education and it
indicates that 90 percent of those responding
expressed enthusiastic support for the tax
credit approach.
Sixth. Since 1954, over 100 tax deduction
proposals for tuition fees have been before
the two Houses of Congress. In fact, on
March 4, 1971, the Senate passed this
legislation as the Ribicoff-Dominick tuition
tax credit amendment to the 1971 Tax
Reform Act. A majority of Republicans as
well as Democrats joined in passing the
measure, only to see it deleted by the House
in conference.
The need for the deduction is great and
apparent. The question now is one of
implementation. Many Congressmen believe
in the success of this proposed legislation if
you — the educational community — actively
support it. ACT NOW. Cut out this article
and send it to your Congressman
accompanied by your letter of support.

In 1968 and 1971, a nationwide survey by
Better Homes and Gardens revealed that
almost 75 percent of the 300,000 persons
interviewed consider college expenses so
basic that they should be deducted from
Federal income tax returns. The Citizens

distributed a questionnaire to the president
and trustees of all public and private
institutions of higher education and it

tax credit amendment to the 1971 Tax
Reform Act. A majority of Republicans as

measure, only to see it deleted by the House
in conference.

Since 1969, students at Wichita State
University considered various ways and
means to offset the soaring costs of
educational expenses. We concluded from
these discussions a carefully directed use of
tax relief is perhaps the most effective form
of government assistance to higher education.
First, it does not require the creation of
cumbersome and costly bureaucratic
machinery. Second, it avoids controversy
over Government determinations as to the
institutional beneficiaries of Federal support.
Is there a need for Federal Tax Credit to
counter higher educational expenses? Those
with children know that education costs are a
grim reality. The prospects are even more
alarming, however, when we consider that
while the price of a college education has
mounted considerably over the past few
years, no relief is yet in sight.
It appears that tuition hikes and a general
increase in other educational expenses are
something with which we shall have to -live
for some time to come. In the light of this
situation the Federal Tax Deduction would
be the most appropriate way to help the
hard-pressed middle- and lower-income
taxpayer.
Tuition Tax Credit
Our investigation reveals that the tuition
tax credit meets the needs of most
Americans. The merits of the tuition tax
credit are:
First. Two-thirds of the benefits would go
to families earning less than $15,000 a year.
A special provision cuts out the wealthy
entirely.
Second. The tuition tax deduction would
provide substantial lessening of pressures on
existing scholarship funds and would

encourage the giving of scholarships by
individual to designated deserving students.
Third. The tax credit formula is weighted
in favor of the public and land-grant colleges.
The deduction will be based on 100 percent
of the first $300 of tuition fees and book
costs, 25 percent of the next $300, but only
five percent of the next $1000 of such costs.
Thus, the lower-tuition schools get a higher
percentage of benefits.
Fourth. Tuition tax credit allows the
taxpayer to use a part of his own gross
earnings to pay for his own education or that
of his children.
Deduction Needed
The increasing facts of education reveal
the need for the deduction.
First. The number of students working
toward undergraduate or graduate degrees
has tripled in the last 15 years. One of every
two citizens between the ages of 18 and 21 is
a student.
Second. The cost of higher education is
increasing rapidly. Between 1958 and 1968,
there was a 34 percent increase in the tuition
rates at public institutions of higher
education, and a 59 percent increase in the
tuition rates at private institutions of higher
learning. It is projected that during the next
decade there will be another 25 percent
increase in the former and a 38 percent
increase in the latter.
Third. Because private Institutions of
Higher Learning are especially in need of
funds, their tuitions have been rising far more
rapidly than public IHL. A result has been an
excessive burden placed on public IHL in
terms of student population. By the late
19705, 80 to 90 percent of the student
population will have to be in public IHL

which are paid for by taxpayers.
Poor Fund Distribution
Fourth. Present Federal funds to IHL are
poorly distributed. About 90 percent of
Federal funds go to only five percent of IHL.
Fifth. Tuition tax deductions have won
the support of large segments of the public.
In 1968 and 1971, a nationwide survey by
Better Homes and Gardens revealed that
almost 75 percent of the 300,000 persons

The increasing facts of education reveal
the need for the deduction.
First. The number of students working
toward undergraduate or graduate degrees
has tripled in the last 15 years. One of every
two citizens between the ages of 18 and 21 is
a student.
Second. The cost of higher education is
increasing rapidly. Between 1958 and 1968,
there was a 34 percent increase in the tuition
rates at public institutions of higher
education, and a 59 percent increase in the
tuition rates at private institutions of higher
learning. It is projected that during the next
decade there will be another 25 percent
increase in the former and a 38 percent
increase in the latter.
Third. Because private Institutions of
Higher Learning are especially in need of
funds, their tuitions have been rising far more
rapidly than public IHL. A result has been an
excessive burden placed on public IHL in
terms of student population. By the late
19705, 80 to 90 percent of the student
population will have to be in public IHL

which are paid for by taxpayers.
Poor Fund Distribution
Fourth. Present Federal funds to IHL are
poorly distributed. About 90 percent of
Federal funds go to only five percent of IHL.
Fifth. Tuition tax deductions have won
the support of large segments of the public.
In 1968 and 1971, a nationwide survey by
Better Homes and Gardens revealed that
almost 75 percent of the 300,000 persons
interviewed consider college expenses so
basic that they should be deducted from
Federal income tax returns. The Citizens
National Committee on Higher Education
distributed a questionnaire to the president
and trustees of all public and private
institutions of higher education and it
indicates that 90 percent of those responding
expressed enthusiastic support for the tax
credit approach.
Sixth. Since 1954, over 100 tax deduction
proposals for tuition fees have been before
the two Houses of Congress. In fact, on
March 4, 1971, the Senate passed this
legislation as the Ribicoff-Dominick tuition
tax credit amendment to the 1971 Tax
Reform Act. A majority of Republicans as
well as Democrats joined in passing the
measure, only to see it deleted by the House
in conference.
The need for the deduction is great and
apparent. The question now is one of
implementation. Many Congressmen believe
in the success of this proposed legislation if
you — the educational community — actively
support it. ACT NOW. Cut out this article
and send it to your Congressman
accompanied by your letter of support.
