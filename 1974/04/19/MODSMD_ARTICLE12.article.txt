# Campus Change -- Oscar Is Missing
## 
### 
Melinda Hornby

I have heard people exclaiming
that the campus is changing. That
things just aren't the same around
here. Usually they are referring to
political apathy, or the return of
trivial pleasures such as streaking.
Sometimes they are
commenting on the change in
clothing styles. The old jeans from
the Army Surplus store are
replaced by the machine
embroidered diamond studded
jeans from Saks. The purpose of
my article is not to bemoan the
change or to analyze it. I simply
want to bring to your attention an

event which has changed the
campus.
Oscar is a half beagle half
basset mutt. He has been missing
for over two weeks. This may not
seem important but read Oscar's
history before you laugh. Oscar
came" to this campus as a young
puppy seven years ago. In those
seven years Oscar has seen the
passing of more than one era.
Campus Cruiser
During the turbulent years,
Oscar cruised the campuses from
Stanford to Berkeley. He was
involved in political movements

from SRI to the Franklin
Hearings.
Oscar has had more publicity
than most Stanford students. Last
year he was written up in the Palo
Alto Times. He had the
distinction of representing all his
fellow dogs on statewide T.V.
during the controversial "dog off
campus" campaign. His picture
has appeared in the Daily, the
Stanford Alumni calendar, and
other university publications.
What I am trying to say is that
Oscar is an important part of
campus life. Though I write this

with a touch of humor, I am very
serious in my intent.
We need Oscar back.
There is no Oscar climbing into
a chair during a psych lecture,
there is no Oscar cleaning himself
in front of the class during a dull
lecture, there is no Oscar trailing
behind my bike as I speed across
campus. There is a little less color
and variety on campus. Oscar lives
at Kairos and if you have seen him
in the last two weeks, let us know.
We need him back.
