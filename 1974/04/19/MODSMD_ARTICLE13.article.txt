# On Dysgenics

Barbara Hickenlooper

I want to thank Dr. William
Shockley for his invitation to a
thinking exercise (Daily, April 16)
about dysgenics and sterilization,
and I would like to give him this
experiential feedback.
As a former teacher (both in
black and white ghetto schools),
as a worker in drug addiction
research, as an avid reader of
history and as an arm chair
politician, I would like to assent
to the idea that pollution of the
gene pools is a function of I.Q.
So, as a gesture of good faith,
let us begin the sterilization
process with the certified
"geniuses."

Let us include those scientists
who developed atomic weaponry
and bio-chemical warfare,
economists whose theories keep
90 percent of the world
population at a starvation level,
military strategists who effectively
decimated Indo-China, etc.
The workers who built
Chartres, created jazz, and labor
with the shorthandled hoe that I
may eat, seem to me, to be
numbered among the few
blessings that are still visible in my
world.
