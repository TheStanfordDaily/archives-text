# First Moscow Streak
## 
### 
Warfield, Andrews

(The following was delayed
because, in the authors' words, "if
you mail anything from inside
Russia, it may never get out.")
At 12 midnight, March 21,
Moscow time, two
Stanford-in-Germany students
performed the first reporter'
Moscow blue streak. Clad only in
fur cossack hats, hiking boots,
neckerchiefs and sunglasses, the
streakers, Pack Warfield and Don
W. Andrews, raced from the front
door of the Hotel Tourist, along
snow lined walks, 250 yards out
to a main Moscow thoroughfare.
They inched back past the Hotel's
restaurant.
Warfield had outdistanced
Andrews until the final 25 yards,
when a cheering crowd of more
than 20 spectators, primarily
Stanford-in-Germany students
(although several Russians were
also present), began yelling
"Together, together!" for a photo
finish.
The streak occurred during a
field trip to the Soviet Union
during the first week of the
quarter break, in which 46
Stanford-in-Germany and
Stanford-in-Britain students
participated. The group spent
three days in Moscow, one day in
Novograd, and three days in
Leningrad. (They also spent eight
hours in the Moscow airport —
typical Russian inefficiency.)
Andrews left his frisbee behind
on Hie roof of the terminal. This
was the same frisbee which had
flown earlier in the trip, in Red
Square, not more than 200 yards
from Lenin's tomb, despite the
presence of more than 20 Moscow
police guards.
'Great Honor'
Never thinking of himself,
Andrews commented immediately
upon completion of the streak,
"We have done Stanford a great
honor!" Both streakers expressed
the basic feeling that there was
little else to do for excitement in
Moscow. The entire trip had been
so plagued by catches and
problems from Intourist, the
Soviet Governmental Travel
Agency, that the streakers felt it
necessary to vent their
frustrations in a totally non-Soviet
manner.
Upon careful questioning
before the time of the streak, the
Russians indicated they had never
heard of streaking. During the
streak, one Russian commented,
"Oh, you crazy Americans, you'll
do anything."
Warfield tripped on an icy curb
after the first 25 yards, and
skidded dangerously on his hands,
but managed to catch himself
before it was too late. He later
expressed his anxiety: "I almost
lost it when I tripped. I'm glad I
had my shot — it was as cold as
Moscow out there." He called the
streak "a small step for Stanford,
but a giant streak for mankind,"
although concluding "I hope this
doesn't make the Park County
News," this being the Montana
boy's local newspaper.
Under Influence
Perhaps it should be noted that
the streak was performed under
the influence of two kinds of
German white wine, two kinds of
Cognac and Kalena. After-streak
festivities included Ballantine's
Scotch Whiskey and Russian
vodka, drunk with two Russians
during a black market blue jeans
sale, during which Warfield really
did "lose it all."
Andrews felt great satisfaction
after the streak. "I'm so glad I did
that. None of my friends will
believe it. They'll probably say,
'Well, I've read it and it's probably
true, and it probably happened,
but I can hardly believe it.' "
A bandsman, Andrews added,
"I'm sitting here wearing my
LSJUMB T-shirt, feeling very
Bandish. I think that streaking is
in the true spirit of the Band, and
hopefully, in the future, the entire
Band will streak before a national
television audience."
'Bouncing Around'
Further Andrews comments:
"When we started out things were
really bouncing around, but after
the first ten meters, things settled
into an easy rhythm .... It was a
castrating feeling, when the cold
air whipped between my legs —
that area of the body was meant
to be cold anyway."
One Stanford-in-Germany (the
Burg) student said, "It's about
time we got some Burgers to do it.
Don and Pack are right-on
Burgers. Gee, I wish there was a
McDonald's in Moscow."
When asked whether they had
ever considered not doing it on
the way down and out of the
Hotel, Warfield exclaimed, "Hell,
yes!"
(Pack Warfield and Don Andrews
are attending Stanford-in-
Germany.)
