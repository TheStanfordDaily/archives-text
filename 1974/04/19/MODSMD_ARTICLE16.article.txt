# Counterfeit Letter Announces P.A. Mayor's Resignation
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Copies of a spurious letter in
which Palo Alto Mayor Kirke
Comstock announced his
resignation were circulated
Tuesday throughout Palo Alto.
Palo Alto police arrested James
Burill, 25, of Palo Alto on charges
of libel and impersonating a
public official when he was found
handing out copies of the letter in
downtown Palo Alto.
Police said Burill admitted
writing the letter. According to a
spokesman for the police
department, Burill said he wrote
the letter "just for fun and in the
spirit of National Lampoon
magazine."
The letter was printed on
stolen Palo Alto city stationery
and Comstock's signature was
forged.
'Daily Humiliation'
In the letter, Comstock was
quoted as saying his job had
become "a daily humiliation" in
which he was "robbed of all
spontaneity and joy." Comstock
"resigned," calling himself a
"professional bully." He noted
that "my life has been lost to me
— wasted."
Comstock told the Daily
yesterday that he was deeply
offended by the letter.

"This is a complete fraud and
hoax," Comstock declared. "It is
cruel to be misrepresented in this
way. The letter was very upsetting
to my family and to many people
in the Palo Alto community."
Comstock said he was
particularly disturbed by the
statement that his job was
drudgery.
"I enjoy my job," Comstock
said. "I get a lot of satisfaction
from it. And I certainly don't
consider my life to be a failure."
Personal Attack
Comstock said that he could
not view the letter as merely an
attack on government in which he
was the arbitrary victim. Rather,
Comstock said he believes that the
letter was a personal attack.
"The letter was written in a
personal tone," Comstock noted.
"I can't imagine what the author
has against me. I can't ever
remember hearing of him before
this incident."
Comstock said he first became
aware of the letter on Tuesday at
noon when friends notified his
wife of the letter's circulation.
Hundreds and perhaps
thousands of copies of the letter
were circulated throughout the
city, Comstock noted.
