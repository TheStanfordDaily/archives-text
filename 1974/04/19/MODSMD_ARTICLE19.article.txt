# Psychiatric Group Declares Homosexuality Not An Illness
## 
### BOB LOWE 
The American Psychiatric
Association (APA) last week
officially removed homosexuality
from its list of mental disorders.
Although a psychiatrist, a
psychologist and two gay students
here are cynical about the effect
the change will have upon
psychologists and psychiatrists,
they all agree that it should
reduce job discrimination against
homosexuals.
According to Asst. Psychiatry
Prof. Donald Lunde, who teaches
the popular Human Sexuality
class, the previous APA
classification has been ' part of
the ammunition used to support
discrimination against gays in
terms of employment."
Lunde specializes in
psychiatry, law and human
sexuality. He said that employers
can no longer "use the APA
classification as justification" for
discrimination.
Larry Gold, a graduate student
in political science and a member
of the Gay People's Union, agreed
with Lunde. Allowing employers
to "fall back upon the APA"
made "discrimination easier," he
said.
'Dubious Proposition'
But Gold felt that it is a
"dubious proposition" whether or
not psychologists and
psychiatrists will change their
viewpoints. He said that
psychologists tend to look at
homosexuality as a "life style"
and psychiatrists view it as
"arrested development."
Assoc. Psychology Prof. Daryl
Bern, well known social
psychologist, said professionals
probably won't be strongly
affected by the change. The APA
action "is more important for the
public."
Bern said, however, the APA
has "entered the 20th century."
He noted that most psychologists

and psychiatrists have not viewed
homosexuality as a mental
disorder for some time. He added
that psychoanalysts who believe
in Freudian theory have a
different opinion.
Psychoanalysts make up a
"specific minority" of
psychiatrists, according to Lunde.
They interpret homosexuality as a
fixation at one of the early stages
of development.
Influence Behavior
Lunde said that psychoanalysts
are more inclined to influence
homosexual behavior. "Freudian
theory is not going to change," he
said.
"Gays should steer clear of an
analyst if they don't want to be
changed to a heterosexual."
A gay freshman woman, who
wished to remain anonymous,
said, "Most of the professionals,
subtle if not outrightly, want
people to change."
She pointed out that
psychologists sometimes
encourage heterosexual behavior
unintentionally because they
really feel that it's better.
Help Change Laws
She also said the APA change
does constitute a new legal stance
but might help change some laws.
In California oral sex is a crime
carrying a maximum penalty of
15 years. Anal sex can result in a
life sentence. Both laws apply for
partners of opposite sex as well as
the same sex.
Gays are usually picked up on
a less serious charge, soliciting for
a lewd and lascivious act, which
can result in a year in jail.
Neither she nor Gold felt that
the APA change will have much
impact on their own attitudes
about homosexuality.
Gold said that sexual norms are
statistics and the APA change will
help people realize this. "You will
look at yourself as less of a
deviant," he said.
