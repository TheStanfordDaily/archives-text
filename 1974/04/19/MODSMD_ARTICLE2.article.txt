# Angry USE Members Walk Out On Union Contract Negotiations
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Representatives of the United
Stanford Employees (USE) walked out
of contract negotiations yesterday,
claiming that the University bargaining
team refused to discuss major issues.
Jim Berk, USE president, charged
that chief University negotiator
Douglas Barton failed to respond to a
set of modified union demands
presented at Monday's negotiating
session.
Barton told the Daily that he could
not discuss demands presented
Monday because union officials failed
to print union demands. He insisted
that the oral presentation given at
Monday's session was vague.
Barton said that the issue of
premium pay provisions was on
yesterday's agenda and therefore
should have been discussed.
Berk accused Barton of
circumventing discussion of
"substantive issues" such as those
mentioned in the modified demands
presented Monday. There is no reason

to rigidly adhere to a set agenda, he
added.
Provisions Included
Berk noted that the union's
modified demands included provisions
for cost of living raises, minimum pay
and health care for dependents of
union members.
Barton explained that the
University would need specific
information on the nature of the
demands in order to determine their
costs.
But Berk insisted that only the new
wage scale proposals need to be
printed. He promised Barton that he
would present a new wage scale later
this week.
The walk-out brings the union
closer than ever to calling a strike,
Berk said. He emphasized that union
members supported his decision to
walk out of the meeting.
Doubts Seriousness
Barton expressed disappointment
and surprise at the walk-out. "I am
puzzled by the whole thing," Barton
told the Daily yesterday."I hoped

that the USE was serious about
bargaining when it returned to the
bargaining table on Monday after a
three-week adjournment. But after an
action such as this, one might well
have reason to wonder about the
seriousness of USE."
Berk stated that he still wants to
bargain with the University, but first
wants a chance to talk with University
administrators.
"President Lyman said on Monday
that he is optimistic about the
negotiations," Berk said. "He must be
misinformed or he would not say such
a thing. I want to meet with him, not
to negotiate, but to inform him
directly of the union position."
Berk said he would also be willing
to meet with Robert Augsburger, vice
president for business and finance.
'Only A Lackey'
"Barton is only a lackey," Berk
declared, "He does what the officials
of the University tell him to do. If the
USE wants to win more favorable
terms, it must meet directly with
Lyman or Augsburger. I don't want
Barton chastised, but I want the
University administration to tell him
to modify his position."
Berk led about 20 USE members to
Augsburger's office yesterday
afternoon, but Augsburger wasn't
there. The group then went to the
Stanford Center for Research and
Development and Teaching where
Augsburger was supposedly attending
a seminar, but they could not find
him.
USE members then walked to the
University administration building
hoping to meet with President Lyman
but were informed that Lyman was
attending a meeting of the Faculty
Senate.
After walking to the Graduate
School of Business where the meeting
was being held, Berk walked into the
conference and gave Lyman a note
asking him to leave.
Lyman sent University attorney
James Siena from the meeting with
instructions to meet with the USE
contingent.
"I don't see what would be gained
by Lyman's coming out here," Siena
said. "I'm not sure that he wants to
discuss this now. The issues are
extraordinarily complex and this is not
an appropriate time or place to discuss
them."

to print union demands. He insisted
that the oral presentation given at
Monday's session was vague.
Barton said that the issue of
premium pay provisions was on
yesterday's agenda and therefore
should have been discussed.
Berk accused Barton of
circumventing discussion of
"substantive issues" such as those
mentioned in the modified demands
presented Monday. There is no reason

to rigidly adhere to a set agenda, he
added.
Provisions Included
Berk noted that the union's
modified demands included provisions
for cost of living raises, minimum pay
and health care for dependents of
union members.
Barton explained that the
University would need specific
information on the nature of the
demands in order to determine their
costs.
But Berk insisted that only the new
wage scale proposals need to be
printed. He promised Barton that he
would present a new wage scale later
this week.
The walk-out brings the union
closer than ever to calling a strike,
Berk said. He emphasized that union
members supported his decision to
walk out of the meeting.
Doubts Seriousness
Barton expressed disappointment
and surprise at the walk-out. "I am
puzzled by the whole thing," Barton
told the Daily yesterday."I hoped

that the USE was serious about
bargaining when it returned to the
bargaining table on Monday after a
three-week adjournment. But after an
action such as this, one might well
have reason to wonder about the
seriousness of USE."
Berk stated that he still wants to
bargain with the University, but first
wants a chance to talk with University
administrators.
"President Lyman said on Monday
that he is optimistic about the
negotiations," Berk said. "He must be
misinformed or he would not say such
a thing. I want to meet with him, not
to negotiate, but to inform him
directly of the union position."
Berk said he would also be willing
to meet with Robert Augsburger, vice
president for business and finance.
'Only A Lackey'
"Barton is only a lackey," Berk
declared, "He does what the officials
of the University tell him to do. If the
USE wants to win more favorable
terms, it must meet directly with
Lyman or Augsburger. I don't want
Barton chastised, but I want the
University administration to tell him
to modify his position."
Berk led about 20 USE members to
Augsburger's office yesterday
afternoon, but Augsburger wasn't
there. The group then went to the
Stanford Center for Research and
Development and Teaching where
Augsburger was supposedly attending
a seminar, but they could not find
him.
USE members then walked to the
University administration building
hoping to meet with President Lyman
but were informed that Lyman was
attending a meeting of the Faculty
Senate.
After walking to the Graduate
School of Business where the meeting
was being held, Berk walked into the
conference and gave Lyman a note
asking him to leave.
Lyman sent University attorney
James Siena from the meeting with
instructions to meet with the USE
contingent.
"I don't see what would be gained
by Lyman's coming out here," Siena
said. "I'm not sure that he wants to
discuss this now. The issues are
extraordinarily complex and this is not
an appropriate time or place to discuss
them."

QUARREL—Jim Berk, left, president of United Stanford Employees (USE) and
Douglas Barton, chief University negotiator, disagree over the events that led-to
a walk-out by USE members yesterday.
Representatives of the United
Stanford Employees (USE) walked out
of contract negotiations yesterday,
claiming that the University bargaining
team refused to discuss major issues.
Jim Berk, USE president, charged
that chief University negotiator
