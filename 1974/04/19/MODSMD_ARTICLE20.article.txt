# 'The Three Musketeers'
## Fast Paced Comedy Helps Classic Tale 
### JENNIFER RANDISI 
It seems to be increasingly
more difficult to create a film that
is bland enough to receive a PG
rating, yet stimulating enough to
appeal to anyone over 12.
Supported by a cast that includes,
among others, Oliver Reed,
Richard Chamberlain, Michael
York, Raquel Welch, Charlton
Heston, and Faye Dunaway, "The
Three Musketeers" has done just
that.
Directed by Richard Lester,
the film version of "The Three
Musketeers" is a fast-paced
interpretation of Alexandre

Dumas' French classic. The
screenplay, which was written by
George McDonnald Frazier, is
reminiscent of several comic styles
ranging from Chaucer to Mel
Brooks and the Marx Brothers.
In one scene a la the Marx
Brothers, two burly attendants are
seen stoking a fire in a torture
chamber. As one of them pulls a
poker from the coals, the other
reveals a couple of
perfectly-toasted marshmallows.
A similar scene occurs later in the
film when an agitated king strikes
a nearby table with his fist,
causing a lavish fountain seated on

the table to stop.
Like Chaucer's Canterbury
Tales, much of the humor in "The
Three Musketeers" is implicitly
sexual in nature. For example,
one of Chaucer's stock comic
conventions that appears in the
film is the old inn-keeper and his
young, unfaithful wife Constance
(Raquel Welch). Throughout the
film, expressions, puns, and a
good deal of slapstick situation
comedy contribute to an overall
bawdy, Tom Jonesian flavor.
"The Three Musketeers"
contains just enough incongruity
in color and design to lend an

illusory, fairy-tale quality to it.
The blue coaches, paper-mache
horses, and acrobatic
sword-fighting that appear in the
film are consistent with the
pageantry of 14th century legend.
Although heavily satired, one gets
a sense of the complex set of
manners and insults associated
with a society based on chivalry.
Due perhaps to the lightness of
the film, few individual
performances stand out as being
particularly noteworthy. Oliver
Reed is easily the most dynamic
of the musketeers, injecting some
seriousness into an otherwise
comic, and rather one-sided, set of
characters. Michael York, a
country-bumpkin type with most

of the lines in the film, is
convincing as the bungling
novitiate who seeks to join the
musketeers. The women that
appear in the film, Raquel Welch
and Faye Dunaway most
particularly, are thoroughly
representative of midieval
stereotypes.
Created as an introduction to
its sequel — entitled, oddly
enough, "The Four Musketeers"
— "The Three Musketeers" ends
with a multitude of plot-related
questions. Unfortunately, scenes
from the sequel are tacked onto
the end of the film almost before
it has finished. In this reviewer's
opinion, "all for one, and one for
all" need not have been taken
quite so literally.

comic, and rather one-sided, set of
characters. Michael York, a
country-bumpkin type with most

of the lines in the film, is
convincing as the bungling
novitiate who seeks to join the
musketeers. The women that
appear in the film, Raquel Welch
and Faye Dunaway most
particularly, are thoroughly
representative of midieval
stereotypes.
Created as an introduction to
its sequel — entitled, oddly
enough, "The Four Musketeers"
— "The Three Musketeers" ends
with a multitude of plot-related
questions. Unfortunately, scenes
from the sequel are tacked onto
the end of the film almost before
it has finished. In this reviewer's
opinion, "all for one, and one for
all" need not have been taken
quite so literally.
It seems to be increasingly
more difficult to create a film that
is bland enough to receive a PG
rating, yet stimulating enough to
appeal to anyone over 12.
Supported by a cast that includes,
among others, Oliver Reed,
Richard Chamberlain, Michael
York, Raquel Welch, Charlton
Heston, and Faye Dunaway, "The
Three Musketeers" has done just
that.
Directed by Richard Lester,
the film version of "The Three
Musketeers" is a fast-paced
interpretation of Alexandre

Dumas' French classic. The
screenplay, which was written by
George McDonnald Frazier, is
reminiscent of several comic styles
ranging from Chaucer to Mel
Brooks and the Marx Brothers.
In one scene a la the Marx
Brothers, two burly attendants are
seen stoking a fire in a torture
chamber. As one of them pulls a
poker from the coals, the other
reveals a couple of
perfectly-toasted marshmallows.
A similar scene occurs later in the
film when an agitated king strikes
a nearby table with his fist,
causing a lavish fountain seated on

the table to stop.
Like Chaucer's Canterbury
Tales, much of the humor in "The
Three Musketeers" is implicitly
sexual in nature. For example,
one of Chaucer's stock comic
conventions that appears in the
film is the old inn-keeper and his
young, unfaithful wife Constance
(Raquel Welch). Throughout the
film, expressions, puns, and a
good deal of slapstick situation
comedy contribute to an overall
bawdy, Tom Jonesian flavor.
"The Three Musketeers"
contains just enough incongruity
in color and design to lend an

illusory, fairy-tale quality to it.
The blue coaches, paper-mache
horses, and acrobatic
sword-fighting that appear in the
film are consistent with the
pageantry of 14th century legend.
Although heavily satired, one gets
a sense of the complex set of
manners and insults associated
with a society based on chivalry.
Due perhaps to the lightness of
the film, few individual
performances stand out as being
particularly noteworthy. Oliver
Reed is easily the most dynamic
of the musketeers, injecting some
seriousness into an otherwise
comic, and rather one-sided, set of
characters. Michael York, a
country-bumpkin type with most

of the lines in the film, is
convincing as the bungling
novitiate who seeks to join the
musketeers. The women that
