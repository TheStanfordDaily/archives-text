# Streetman Moves Stanford Crowd With Original Songs
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Singer-guitarist Chic Streetman
returned to Stanford Monday
night, for the second quarter in a
row, to play an informal set of
folk-blues as part of "The History
of the Blues" in Burbank Lounge,
Stern Hall.
An audience of about 60
people sang along with Streetman
on original compositions and
re-interpretations of blues
standards, for nearly two hours.
Accompanied only by Steve
Glaizer on snare drum, cymbal,
and conga, Streetman's rhythmic
guitar work and foot stomping
made for a very enjoyable
evening, well representative of the
happier side of blues music.
Most of the songs reflected the
relaxed attitude of the rural blues
of the South ("Pick A Bale of
Cotton," "Shortnin' Bread,"
"Living With The Blues"), while
others had a slightly uptown,
down-hearted mood ("Nobody
Knows You When You're Down
And Out," "Don't Answer the
Door").
A stand-out among his original

compositions was "Ode To
Maphine" in which Streetman
takes the voice of his grandmother
singing of the rape of her mother.
"That man who one noon
Went searching for a coon,
Tore off my mama s dress.
In darkness I was born.
From mama I was torn,
Sixty-three years ago."
Among his selections derived
from other blues artists were fine
versions of Leadbelly's "Ella
Speed," Mississippi John Hurt's
"Candy Man," and "Burnt Child
Afraid of Fire," written by Sonny
Terry and Brownie McGhee.
Streetman went from one style
to another quickly, sometimes
abruptly, playing back-to-back
versions of Leonard Cohen's
"Suzanne" and John Lee

Hooker's "Crawlin' Kingsnake."
Another number went from
Leadbelly's "Keep Your Hands
Off Her" to Chuck Berry's
"Maybelline" to Johnny Otis'
"Willie and the Hand Jive" to "Bo
Diddley."
Besides playing acoustic guitar,
Streetman occasionally played
harmonica on a neck harness, as
on "The Flow," a slow, easy-going
tune he wrote while in Paris,
where he recorded an LP, Chic
Streetman . . . Growing Up, which
may be released here soon.
Chic Streetman, now 27, is not
currently a professional musician;
he is head of a fair housing project
in Hayward. As more than a few
spectators were heard to say
Monday night, "That guy should
be playing in a club around here â€”
he's great."
