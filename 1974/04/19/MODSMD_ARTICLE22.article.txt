Maggie Bell
Queen of the Nigh t
Atlantic SD 7293
Maggie Bell may just be the
next big solo singing superstar.
She can't help but be compared
with Janis Joplin, who was just
the female singer for a little
known group, Big Brother and the
Holding Company, before sudden
and tragic superstardom.
But Bell, although sounding at
times similar to Janis, has more
versatility, and seems more in
control of her voice and her
career. From the lead singer for a
forgotten English group, Stone
the Crows, she has progressed to a
part in the stage version of
"Tommy," and now to her first
solo effort, "Queen of the Night."
It's an eclectic collection of
songs by others, with Maggie
being a bit bluesy (on John Prine's
"Souvenirs,"), a bit countryish (in
a Nashville-arranged version of "A
Woman Left Lonely,") or
straightforward funky rock

("After Midnight," "Caddo
Queen").
The backing arrangements are
tastefully done and refreshingly
different (the guitar counterpoint
in Ringo's "Oh My My," for
example). Background vocals are
handled with verve and style by
the Sweet Inspirations. In fact,
each item of the package seems
constructed by people who knew
just what they were doing —
showing Maggie Bell's talents to
best advantage. If you like gutsy
rock and blues in the Joplin vein,
you've got to give your ears to
"Queen of the Night" for an
evening.

Jan Akkerman
Tabernakel
Atco SD 7032
Jan Akkerman, who is best
known as lead guitarist for the
popular Dutch rock group Focus,
has put out one of the more

interesting albums of recent
months. Tabernakel is an
excellent example of the
possibilities of mixing rock and
classical themes.
An extremely serious musician
with both formal training and
experience "on the streets and in
the clubs," Akkerman has one
idol among guitarists, classical
virtuoso Julian Bream. Tabernakel
includes six solo lute pieces, by
John Dowland, Francis
Pilkington, Anthonie Holborne,
Thomas Morley and Laurencini of
Rome. His lute technique is quite
good, something which goes for
his acoustic and electric guitar
work as well.
'Britannia' Adaptation
The opening selection is an
adaptation of Dowland's
"Britannia," beginning as a solo
lute piece, with bass, drums and a
small orchestra joining later. The
result is a contemporary sound
which neither does violence to the
original nor sounds like a rock
band with a new gimmick.
"House of the King" is the
album's most rock-oriented track.
Akkerman plays electric guitar
with backup by bassist Tim
Bogert and drummer Carmine
Appice as well as flute and strings.
George Flynn's orchestral
arrangements, as elsewhere on the
album, are excellent, forming an
integral part of the overall sound
rather than a distracting,
tacked-on extra as so often
happens in popular music.
"Javeh," the last track on side
one, is a fascinating vehicle for the

combined talents of Akkerman
and Flynn. A short piece (3:22),
it seems most reminiscent of early
20th-century Impressionistic
works, but quite original.
Akkerman plays classical guitar
while Flynn plays harpsichord,
piano and glockenspiel, along with
a 15-piece string section.
Lengthy Song
After a Fantasy by Laurencini,
side two consists of a more
lengthy Akkerman-Flynn
composition, "Lammy." The first
part, "I Am," is an organ and
voice introduction, followed by a
self-explanatory "Asleep, Half
Asleep, Awake," with a droning
background and Indian-sounding
melody on electric guitar. Solos
by Bogert and Appice herald the
"Awake" stage. "She Is" is
essentially a repeat of the
introduction, and gives way to the
central section, "Lammy." A flute
states the melody, which is
repeated by the strings with
elaborations by Akkerman's
guitar. A brief "We Are" theme is
heard in the orchestra, then "The
Last Will and Testament," an
adaptation of a Holborne theme.
The four-voice chorus ends the
piece with a complex a capella
"Amen."
Tabernakel is a well
thought-out and well executed
album, and is devoid of the
artificial "spacey" quality of
many other groups (especially
English) which try to combine
rock and classical elements. It
should age well.

THE NEXT JANIS JOPLIN? — The English blues and rock singer Maggie Bell might well be oh her way to
superstardom. Her work on her new album, "Queen of the Night" compares with that of the late Janis
Joplin.
