# Netters In And Out For Big Matches
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
At a school which has been
fielding major sports teams as long
as Stanford has, there are very few
real "firsts."
But there will be a first tonight
and tomorrow night, when three
individual matches (of a total of
/line) against USC and UCLA, will
be played indoors in Maples
Pavilion.
With over 4,000 tickets sold
for each night, obviously tennis
now joins a select group of sports
that can be considered
money-makers, rather than losers.
And so, the Maples matches mean
a lot, not only to the tennis team,
but to the entire Stanford athletic
department, which is plagued, as
are most programs, by financial
worries.
Enough philosophy. What you
really want to know is whether
Stanford is really the best team in
the country or whether its Los
Angeles rivals, after a brief lapse,
are catching up.
Even Matches
The second possibility gained
some credence two weeks ago,
when the Cardinals were lucky to
get out of L.A. with a split. After
losing to UCLA 5-4, Stanford, by
the width of the wood on Jim

Delaney's racket, beat USC 5-4.
What happened was this. USC
and Stanford were tied, four
matches all. The deciding match,
between Delaney-Sandy Mayer
and John Andrews-Sashi Menon,
went into a third-set tiebreaker.
At four all (double match point)
Delaney hit one off the wood to
win it.
Happily, for those who like
grudge matches, the same two
doubles pairs will play in Maples
tonight, after singles duals
between Delaney and Menon and
Mayer and Andrews — the
first-named match beginning at
6:30 p.m.
The six outdoor matches begin
both today and tomorrow at 1
p.m. It's possible that, because of
the Maples matches, these
matches will not be sold out. Still,
students planning to buy
non-reserved seats should arrive
early.
The Lineups
USC's order is uncertain for
the final four singles positions,
though its reasonably sure Butch
Walts, Mike Wayman, John
Holladay and Hans Guildermeister
will fill these spots.
Holladay-Walts and
Guildermeister-Wayman will play
doubles.
Stanford's order is exact,
barring injury. Mayer and Delaney
will be followed by John
Whitlinger, Pat DuPre, Nick
Saviano and Mark Mitchell, an
order which clicked against SMU.
Whitlinger-DuPre and
Saviano-Mitchell will follow
Mayer-Delaney in the doubles
order.
Tomorrow, Stanford will try to
avenge its loss to UCLA. The
Bruins, at the beginning of the
season, looked comparatively
weak on paper, but have come on
strong to compile a 12-1 match
record, the team's only loss being
5-4 to USC after the Bruins won
four of six singles matches.
UCLA's lineup is reasonably
firm, consisting of Brian Teacher,
who beat Mayer two weeks ago,
Steve Mott, Ferdi Taygan, Tom
Kreiss, Spencer Segura and David
Parker at singles and
Teacher-Mott, Taggan-Segura and
Jim Landes-Horace Reid at
doubles.
As evidenced by the USC
match, when UCLA lost all three
doubles matches to snatch defeat,
the Bruins are probably weaker
than their foes here and if
Stanford can get out of singles
alive, i.e., with a tie or better, it
will be strongly favored to win. R
is unsure which matches against
the Bruins will be played in
Maples.
Should the Cards win both
matches, they will be top-seeded
in the Pacific Eight tourney, at
Washington in May. This seed
would mean that while USC and
UCLA would be paired in the
semis, Stanford would have fairly
easy sailing until the final round.
In addition, these matches will
help determine NCAA seedings.
As the NCAA's will be played in
hostile Los Angeles, the Cardinals
will need all the good seeds it can
get to defend its crown.

A NEW WORLD RECORD—Sophomore Matt Hogsett anchored
Stanford's mile intermediate relay team which established a new
world record Wednesday. Hogsett blazed his leg in 52.2 and led the
relay to break the old record by nearly three seconds. Hogsett and his
teammates may try to improve on the record time of 3:37.8 next
week.
