# Card Golfers Host Dual With SJS
## 
### 
Stanford's golfers will be
treated to a welcome rest from
their busy tournament schedule
tomorrow when the Cards host
San Jose State in a noon dual
match 011 the Stanford course.
The Spartans will be trying to
earn a split in the season dual
match series between the two
teams, having lost 16-11 to the
Cards on Feb. 8 at San Jose
Country Club. Stanford,
meanwhile, hopes to improve its
5-1 dual match record.
Primarily, though, both teams
will be trying to sharpen their
games in preparation for next
week's U.S. Collegiate Invitational
here, where the Cards and
Spartans are expected to provide
the stiffest challenge to favored
USC. The Trojans are currently
the nation's top-ranked team in
Golf World's collegiate poll.
Stanford's Dave Baskins and
San Jose's Mark Lye, who along
with four others tied for third at
last week's Western
Intercollegiates, will square off in
the number-one match tomorrow.
Baskins just recently assumed
the top spot on the Stanford
ladder with a competitive average
of 74.95. Rounding out the
Cardinal lineup tomorrow are Aly
Trompas (75.15), Brent Murray
(75.63), George Pettinger (75.72),
Conrad Nilmeier (76.65) and
Glenn Goethels (78.00).
The same six players will
represent Stanford in next week's
tournament, which begins
Thursday and runs through
Saturday on the Stanford Course.
