# Cards Seek To Rebound Against Cal
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Traditionally any athletic
contest against University of
California at Berkeley has
profound meaning for Stanford.
Today's game at Cal has a
two-fold purpose: First, to
maintain tradition and, second, to
escape the cellar of the Pacific
Eight Southern Division.
Today's contest is scheduled
for 2:30 p.m. at Clint Evans Field
on the Cal campus. A
doubleheader will begin at 12
noon tomorrow at Sunken
Diamond here.
Both teams have 2-4 records so
far in the first round of
conference play. Cal has fared a
little better overall with 18 wins
against 11 losses while Stanford's
record is 13-19.
Stanford's performance so far
in the conference has been
haphazard. The Cards played
inspired baseball against defending
NCAA champion USC to take two
of three games at home but lost
three straight the following
weekend at UCLA (4-2), which
meets USC (4-2) for the top spot
in the conference this weekend.
Close Games
The trend in this unpredictable
season for Stanford has been to
battle out a lot of close games. Cal
has had the same kind of year.
"We've had to scratch for a lot of
games," said Cal Coach Jackie
Jensen, a former major league
star.
Stanford Coach Ray Young's
analysis of his team is almost an
echo. "I expect it to be a struggle
this weekend," said Young. "We
haven't had an easy game all
year."
Cal's starting pitcher today will
be lefthander John Hughes, who
will be going against Stanford's

Dave Frost (3-4). Saturday's
pitchers for Cal will be Juan
Eichleberger (5-1), who ranks
second in the conference in
strikeouts with 17, and Gene Litle
or the ouija board, according to
Jensen. "I may need Gene earlier
in the series so I don't know
who'll go the third game."
Litle is considered a long-relief
man for the Bears. He currently is
1-0 in the conference and ranks at
the top in earned run average
(0.00) in 9-2/3 inning pitched.
Bear shortstop Randy Hooper,

currently the top hitter in the
early conference statistics at .500,
is a questionable starter. "Randy
has been sick for the last week
and a half with strep throat and
herpes simplex [commonly know
as shingles]," said Jensen. "He's
lost a lot of weieht."
Much Improved
"Cal is a much improved club
over last year," said Young.
"They've made very few changes
in their lineup, so they are more
experienced."
In the rivalry between the two

schools Cal has won 147 games
compared to 105 for the Cards.
Last year 12 games were split
between the two teams.
"I was very surprised to see the
UCLA scores against Stanford,"
said Jensen. "It's a shame that the
two of us have to play each other.
We should concentrate on our
southern rivals. UCLA could
knock off USC so anybody can
still win this league."
Stanford's pitchers scheduled
for Saturday are Mike Williamson
(2-3) and A 1 Arthur (2-5). Both
were banished to the bullpen last
week. But when the Card pitching
collapsed Williamson came in to
pitch well in relief and Arthur was
the winner in Stanford's 15-1
trouncing of University of San
Francisco Monday. On the
strength of these performances
the two pitchers have been
restored to their former status.
Shortstop Steve Davis is the
only Card to break into the top
15 in conference hitting. He is
15th with a .368 mark.
Stanford's leading hitter in
overall statistics is catcher Dave
Baker (.336). Kim Hannaford
(.333), Davis (.318) and Mark
Lucich (.306) are the other Card
regulars over .300. Gary Morton
actually tops the Card hitting at
.625 (five for eight) but he has
played in only four games.
Stanford's conference team
batting average of .265 ranks
fourth. However, the Card earned
run average (6.32) is dead last in
the pitching rankings.
