# Cyclists Open Season At Races In San Jose
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
The- Stanford Cycling
Association will field a six-man
team in the opening races of
Northern California intercollegiate
cycling competition tomorrow at
San Jose State. UC-Davis is -the
other confirmed entry, while Cal
State-Sonoma and Chico State
may also send teams.
The team will be led by
sophomore captain Dave Roll,
who is also president of the club
and the 1973 amateur road racing
champion of New Jersey. Bill
Henner, Dan Cautley, John
Drooyan, Greg Wallis and Phil
Dreike round out what Roll calls a
"really strong team."
The racers are among some 30
members of the Cycling
Association, six of whom are
women. Part of the Club Sports
program, the association includes
both racing and recreational
riders. The racers ride lightweight,
handcrafted, largely

European-made ten-speed bikes
costing $300 and up, including
such marques as Cinelli, Masi,
Puegeot and Schwinn Paramount.
Tomorrow's events include a
25-mile criterium, run on a short
course through city streets, and a
40-mile road race over a longer,
more varied course. The criterium
will begin at 9 a.m. at 12th Street
and San Fernando in San Jose,
and the road race at 2 p.m. at
Bailey and Santa Teresa, off 101
near Morgan Hill.
Future events include a meet
here May 4 and a championship
meet at Davis May 18. The May 4
meet will include a 20-mile
criterium on Campus Drive,
Escondido, Galvez and Serra
Streets (around Manzanita,
Branner, Crothers and Encina)
and a 35-mile road race. Unless
another site can be negotiated
with local cities, according to
8011, the road race will have to be
held on campus as well, perhaps
over the same course. The Davis
meet will include criterium and
road racing as well as
one-kilometer time trials, with
one rider against the clock.
"This is the first year this
[intercollegiate racing] has
happened out here," said 8011.
The Amateur Bicycle league of
America is "strongly interested in
developing intercollegiate
competition, because that's where
future riders will come from,"he
added, noting that the average age
of the American Olympic and Pan
American Games riders is about
27 years.
Unfortunately, 801 l * will
probably not be among those
"future riders." Although he is
"coming out of retirement" for
this race, he has all but given up
serious competition because "my
knees are shot."

"This is the first year this
[intercollegiate racing] has
happened out here," said 8011.
The Amateur Bicycle league of
America is "strongly interested in
developing intercollegiate
competition, because that's where
future riders will come from,"he
added, noting that the average age
of the American Olympic and Pan
American Games riders is about
27 years.
Unfortunately, 801 l * will
probably not be among those
"future riders." Although he is
"coming out of retirement" for
this race, he has all but given up
serious competition because "my
knees are shot."
The- Stanford Cycling
Association will field a six-man
team in the opening races of
Northern California intercollegiate
cycling competition tomorrow at
San Jose State. UC-Davis is -the
other confirmed entry, while Cal
State-Sonoma and Chico State
may also send teams.
The team will be led by
sophomore captain Dave Roll,
who is also president of the club
and the 1973 amateur road racing
champion of New Jersey. Bill
Henner, Dan Cautley, John
Drooyan, Greg Wallis and Phil
Dreike round out what Roll calls a
"really strong team."
The racers are among some 30
members of the Cycling
Association, six of whom are
women. Part of the Club Sports
program, the association includes
both racing and recreational
riders. The racers ride lightweight,
handcrafted, largely

European-made ten-speed bikes
costing $300 and up, including
such marques as Cinelli, Masi,
Puegeot and Schwinn Paramount.
Tomorrow's events include a
25-mile criterium, run on a short
course through city streets, and a
40-mile road race over a longer,
more varied course. The criterium
will begin at 9 a.m. at 12th Street
and San Fernando in San Jose,
and the road race at 2 p.m. at
Bailey and Santa Teresa, off 101
near Morgan Hill.
Future events include a meet
here May 4 and a championship
meet at Davis May 18. The May 4
meet will include a 20-mile
criterium on Campus Drive,
Escondido, Galvez and Serra
Streets (around Manzanita,
Branner, Crothers and Encina)
and a 35-mile road race. Unless
another site can be negotiated
with local cities, according to
8011, the road race will have to be
held on campus as well, perhaps
over the same course. The Davis
meet will include criterium and
road racing as well as
one-kilometer time trials, with
one rider against the clock.
