# Cards Host Meeting Of Talented Spikers
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Tomorrow one of the finest
collections of track athletes ever
to hit Northern California will
assemble in Stanford Stadium at
1:15 to participate in the
northern version of the annual
Pac-8 double-dual track meet
between the four leading
California universities. Defending
national champion UCLA will be
assaulting the host Cardinals in
the meet, while Cal and (JSC
simultaneously battle it out in
another.
Several Olympic veterans and
future Olympic participants will
threaten meet and Pac-8 records
tomorrow, and the two schools
that figure to dominate, USC and
UCLA, will use the meet as a
full-blast tuneup for their May 4
showdown which could portend
the Pac-8 and NCAA champion.
"The fans that come to the
meet will see some of the finest
athletes in the country," said
Stanford coach Payton Jordan.
"We have the makings of a

showpiece for future Olympians
in this meet, and I want to show
that this area is the center for
track competition.
"The NCAA champ (UCLA),
the challenger to the throne
(USC), a fine Cal team, and four
teams that come to compete will
be participating. Although we are
outmanned, Stanford will
compete with all their minds and
bodies. It is going to be a highly
competitive meet; one that fans
will enjoy watching."
The Bible of track, Tiack and
Field News, still rates the Bruins
as the outstanding power in the
country, and since the Cards lost
to the third rated power, USC,
122-23 two weeks ago, it would
figure that Stanford would suffer
an even more severe thrashing
tomorrow. But better Cardinal
matchups and the grace of UCLA
coach Jim Bush will narrow the
margin of Bruin victory and even
up the competition.
Keep Score Down
"The main goal for the meet is

to make it a good, competitive
meet," said Bush. "I want to keep
the score down; I have great
respect for Jordan and we're not
going up there to embarass
anybody. We don't run the score
up on anybody but USC.
"I know how Payton feels; you
just can't get the athletes in
without scholarships — and if you
don't have the scholarship money
that we do, you can't get the
horses you need to win.
"We're strong in most areas,
but we do expect to be challenged
in the hurdles and the long
distances. The quarter should be
interesting; I'm just going to run
my two horses in the relays. Our
next three 440 men are good, but
knowing Stanford, they'll
probably go 1-2 on us."
Such an upset is unlikely
considering UCLA's stable of
quarter-horses is deeper and more
talented than most national
contingents. Maxie Parks and
Benny Brown, each timed in 45.5
in the quarter last week, will be
withheld, but Robert Harrell, a
Cal State champion as a 1972
prep, has run 47.2 and should
triumph in the absence of his
world-class teammates. Cards
Scott Wingo, Bruce Henry and
John Kessel will have to dip in the
low 48's to place against the
powerful UCLA quartermilers.
Mile Relay
Although the Cards have
virtually no chance against the
country's best mile relay team,
the speedy UCLA foursome may
pull the Cards close to the
Stanford record of 3:10.5. "We
are very proud of winning the
NCAA mile relay the last five
years," said Bush, "and I think
this year's team could break the
school [and national) record. This
will be the first time our best
relay will be running together. We
were planning to wait until the
USC meet to use them."
Stanford's fourth and fifth best
three-milers of all-time, Tony
Sandoval and Mark McConnel,
will be in a good position to beat
UCLA's regular miler, Gary Nitti,
in another of the meet's better
events. Bob Hayman should be
counted on for points in the
steeple, and another Bruin
weakspot, the high hurdles,
should insure a victory by Dave
Bagshaw in his specialty.
But Bagshaw and teammate
Matt Hogsett will be strongly
challenged in the intermediates by
UCLA's Lynnsey Guerrero, whose
51.9 is only .2 behind Hogsett's
best. Bruin Gordon Peppars will
be favored in the springs, but a
Card who grew up in his shadow
in Southern California, Marvin
Holmes, should be close behind in
both the 100 and 220.

will be in a good position to beat
UCLA's regular miler, Gary Nitti,
in another of the meet's better
events. Bob Hayman should be
counted on for points in the
steeple, and another Bruin
weakspot, the high hurdles,
should insure a victory by Dave
Bagshaw in his specialty.
But Bagshaw and teammate
Matt Hogsett will be strongly
challenged in the intermediates by
UCLA's Lynnsey Guerrero, whose
51.9 is only .2 behind Hogsett's
best. Bruin Gordon Peppars will
be favored in the springs, but a
Card who grew up in his shadow
in Southern California, Marvin
Holmes, should be close behind in
both the 100 and 220.
Tomorrow one of the finest
collections of track athletes ever
to hit Northern California will
assemble in Stanford Stadium at
1:15 to participate in the
northern version of the annual
Pac-8 double-dual track meet
between the four leading
California universities. Defending
national champion UCLA will be
assaulting the host Cardinals in
the meet, while Cal and (JSC
simultaneously battle it out in
another.
Several Olympic veterans and
future Olympic participants will
threaten meet and Pac-8 records
tomorrow, and the two schools
that figure to dominate, USC and
UCLA, will use the meet as a
full-blast tuneup for their May 4
showdown which could portend
the Pac-8 and NCAA champion.
"The fans that come to the
meet will see some of the finest
athletes in the country," said
Stanford coach Payton Jordan.
"We have the makings of a

showpiece for future Olympians
in this meet, and I want to show
that this area is the center for
track competition.
"The NCAA champ (UCLA),
the challenger to the throne
(USC), a fine Cal team, and four
teams that come to compete will
be participating. Although we are
outmanned, Stanford will
compete with all their minds and
bodies. It is going to be a highly
competitive meet; one that fans
will enjoy watching."
The Bible of track, Tiack and
Field News, still rates the Bruins
as the outstanding power in the
country, and since the Cards lost
to the third rated power, USC,
122-23 two weeks ago, it would
figure that Stanford would suffer
an even more severe thrashing
tomorrow. But better Cardinal
matchups and the grace of UCLA
coach Jim Bush will narrow the
margin of Bruin victory and even
up the competition.
Keep Score Down
"The main goal for the meet is

to make it a good, competitive
meet," said Bush. "I want to keep
the score down; I have great
respect for Jordan and we're not
going up there to embarass
anybody. We don't run the score
up on anybody but USC.
"I know how Payton feels; you
just can't get the athletes in
without scholarships — and if you
don't have the scholarship money
that we do, you can't get the
horses you need to win.
"We're strong in most areas,
but we do expect to be challenged
in the hurdles and the long
distances. The quarter should be
interesting; I'm just going to run
my two horses in the relays. Our
next three 440 men are good, but
knowing Stanford, they'll
probably go 1-2 on us."
Such an upset is unlikely
considering UCLA's stable of
quarter-horses is deeper and more
talented than most national
contingents. Maxie Parks and
Benny Brown, each timed in 45.5
in the quarter last week, will be
withheld, but Robert Harrell, a
Cal State champion as a 1972
prep, has run 47.2 and should
triumph in the absence of his
world-class teammates. Cards
Scott Wingo, Bruce Henry and
John Kessel will have to dip in the
low 48's to place against the
powerful UCLA quartermilers.
Mile Relay
Although the Cards have
virtually no chance against the
country's best mile relay team,
the speedy UCLA foursome may
pull the Cards close to the
Stanford record of 3:10.5. "We
are very proud of winning the
NCAA mile relay the last five
years," said Bush, "and I think
this year's team could break the
school [and national) record. This
will be the first time our best
relay will be running together. We
were planning to wait until the
USC meet to use them."
Stanford's fourth and fifth best
three-milers of all-time, Tony
Sandoval and Mark McConnel,
will be in a good position to beat

low 48's to place against the
powerful UCLA quartermilers.
Mile Relay
Although the Cards have
virtually no chance against the
country's best mile relay team,
the speedy UCLA foursome may
pull the Cards close to the
Stanford record of 3:10.5. "We
are very proud of winning the
NCAA mile relay the last five
years," said Bush, "and I think
this year's team could break the
school [and national) record. This
will be the first time our best
relay will be running together. We
were planning to wait until the
USC meet to use them."
Stanford's fourth and fifth best
three-milers of all-time, Tony
Sandoval and Mark McConnel,
will be in a good position to beat
UCLA's regular miler, Gary Nitti,
in another of the meet's better
events. Bob Hayman should be
counted on for points in the
steeple, and another Bruin
weakspot, the high hurdles,
should insure a victory by Dave
Bagshaw in his specialty.
But Bagshaw and teammate
Matt Hogsett will be strongly
challenged in the intermediates by
UCLA's Lynnsey Guerrero, whose
51.9 is only .2 behind Hogsett's
best. Bruin Gordon Peppars will
be favored in the springs, but a
Card who grew up in his shadow
in Southern California, Marvin
Holmes, should be close behind in
both the 100 and 220.
