# Sailors Try For Cup
## 
### TOM WINOKUR 
This afternoon there is a
practice and tonight there is a
welcoming party. It's a day to
psyche up and to psyche the other
teams out.
But tomorrow the Stanford
Sailing Team will begin the 1974
Kennedy Cup in dead earnest.
Eleven of the top collegiate
sailing teams will gather this
weekend to compete at the U.S.
Naval Academy in 44-foot yawls
supplied by the academy.
Stanford will probably not enter
the race as one of the favorites.
That honor will probably be
divided among defending
champion Michigan, eastern
champion Dartmouth and Hawaii,
but Stanford's preparation has
been thorough if not impeccable.
The sailing team spent Spring
Break in San Diego sailing boats
which were essentially identical to
the boats at the Academy and the

team discussed local weather
conditions and currents with
several people knowledgeable
# about the area. The Regatta itself
was discussed with a former Yale
skipper now at Stanford.
While practice never makes
perfect in sailing, it will allow
skipper Craig Daniels and tactician
Brad Mills to concentrate on the
races without worrying too much
about the coordination of the
crew in tight maneuvers.
The regatta is generally won by
a consistent crew as opposed to
one that does well in one or two
races and poorly in the other
three. Last year's winner finished
no higher than third in any one
race. Stanford is capable of this
kind of showing — if not better —
and should be in contention to
bring home an unprecedented
third Kennedy Cup.

Team Notes: Stanford will
probably be the youngest team at
the Kennedy Cup. There will be
two freshmen, four sophomores
and two juniors on the team.
Jody McVittie will be the first
woman to compete in the
Kennedy Cup although Stanford
did take Susie Salisbury to the
1971 regatta. Susie wasn't allowed
to compete but the rule was
changed the next year.
