# Takes Rhode Island Post
## Newman To Leave Stanford 
### JOHN FREED 
Frank Newman, director of
university relations here, will leave
that post to become president of the
University of Rhode Island next
August.
The decision was announced
yesterday at a press conference in
Rhode Island. Newman decided to
accept the invitation last Tuesday,
after being chosen Friday from a field
of 389 candidates by the Rhode Island
Board of Regents.
Newman described the position as
an exciting opportunity.
"One of the things I find exciting is
that the University is very central to
the state. It's a university that's been
transforming itself. It has really
developed itself enormously, and I
think the trend is going to continue,"
he said.
One aspect of the University that
Newman finds interesting is that

although the school has become
increasingly research-oriented in the
past decade, it still maintains a large
stake in teaching.
"The students view it as a
research-university that is still
interesting in teaching," Newman
reported.
Cooperative Spirit
The University of Rhode Island,
being a public university, has certain
advantages over private schools,
according to Newman. One is that the
regents must work closely with the
university, fostering a spirit of
cooperation.
"The Board of Regents and the
university want to work together. As
an example, almost all of [the regents]
showed up at the press conference,"
Newman said.
A Stanford administrator since
1967, Newman has supervised news
and publications, community

relations, public events and
community, state and federal
relations.
"He's done a tremendous job at a
time when the challenge was very
great, when it was necessary to move
fast in developing his office,"
President Richard W. Lyman said.
Albert Carlotti, chairman of the
Rhode Island Board of Regents, also
praised Newman.
High Praise
"[He's] a man with administrative
and financial capabilities developed in
the academic and business world, who
has demonstrated an unusual grasp of
the problems and opportunities facing
all of higher education," Carlotti
stated.
His wife, Lucille, an assistant
professor of anthropology at the
University of California Medical
Center in San Francisco, plans to find
a new job on the East Coast.
"I'm negotiating with a couple of
places in the Boston area," she
remarked.
Newman will be the eighth
president of the University of Rhode
Island, which has a student population
of 22,000 spread over three campuses.
He led a national task force on
higher education, whose report, issued
in 1971, criticized "massive inertia" in
the academic world. Former Secretary
of Health, Education and Welfare
Elliot L. Richardson said the report
was provocative, controversial and
innovative.
More Impact
"The Newman group has had more
impact with fewer dollars than any
other educational commission,"
Harold L. Hodgkinson of UC-Berkeley
later observed.
In an article published in Change
magazine two years ago, Newman
expressed hope for greater diversity
among colleges and universities. He
urged students to attend college only
when they could profit from it, and to
view college as a recurring life-long
experience.
