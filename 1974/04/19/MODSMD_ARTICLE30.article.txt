Sirica Subpoenas Nixon Tapes
WASHINGTON — A federal judge yesterday
ordered President Nixon to surrender tapes and
documents of 64 conversations to be used in the
Watergate cover-up trial involving men who were
once his top lieutenants.
The subpoena was served on the White House a
few hours after it was ordered by U.S. District
Judge John J. Sirica. The President has until May 2
to comply.
There was no immediate word whether the White
House will comply with the latest legal effort to
wrest Watergate information from the President.
Deputy Press Secretary Gerald L. Warren said "the
matter will be considered by the special counsel."
Sirica acted on a request by special Watergate
prosecutor Leon Jaworski, who said he needed the
material for the conspiracy trial involving John N.

Mitchell, H.R. Haldeman, John D. Ehrlichman,
Charles W. Colson and three others. The trial is
scheduled before Sirica on Sept. 9.
Twenty-four of the conversations sought are
included in a subpoena issued by the House
Judiciary Committee for its impeachment inquiry.
The committee's chairman, Peter W. Rodino Jr.,
D—N.J., said in a television interview yesterday that
any White House editing of the 42 conversations his
committee subpoenaed "could be considered a
possible ground of impeachment."
Bomb Damages Teamster Office
BURLINGAME — A thundering bomb blast in
the Western Conference of Teamsters headquarters
yesterday caused up to $75,000 damage and blew
out windows in several surrounding buildings.
No one was injured in the 6:05 a.m. explosion of
a bomb planted against a pillar in the building's
open basement parking garage.
William Grami, a Western Conference spokesman,
said the Teamsters would not speculate publicly on
possible motives for the bombing.
He said the only conflict currently involving
Teamsters is the continuing contest with the
AFL-CIO United Farm Workers of America over
organizing California field workers.
Syrian Jets Bomb Golan Heights
DAMASCUS, Syria — Syrian jet fighters bombed
and strafed Israeli positions on and near Mt.
Hermon yesterday in a new escalation of fighting on
the Golan Heights front.
It was Syria's first use of aircraft in combat since
the Middle East war last October.
The Syrian command said its planes caused
"heavy material damage and losses in enemy lives,"
then returned safely to base. The Israeli military
command said the attacks resulted in the wounding
of one Israeli soldier. It made no mention of deaths
or material damage.
The Syrian attacks coincided with other
important Middle East developments :
—President Nixon and Secretary of State Henry
A. Kissinger held a surprise meeting in Washington
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismail Fahmy. U.S.
officials said the session was to inform Egypt of
continuing U.S. efforts to seek a disengagement of
Syrian and Israeli forces. The Egyptians had
threatened to join Syria in the Golan Heights
fighting if it got any worse, but American sources
said this was not the purpose of the meeting.
—In Cairo, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt
accused the Soviet Union of going back on promises
of military aid and said his government was seeking
weapons elsewhere. Sadat, however, called in a
speech for a meeting soon with Kremlin leaders.
—A terrorist bomb went off in an Israeli town,

wounding 12 Arabs and one Jew.
'Zebra' Manhunt To Continue
SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Joseph L. Alioto,
under fire for ordering police to stop black men in
the streets for questioning and possible search in the
Zebra manhunt, vowed yesterday to press on
regardless of the criticism.
Alioto said police were violating no
constitutional rights by stopping men who resemble
a composite sketch of a black gunman sought in the
slayings of 12 whites here in the last five months.
Police say witnesses have seen at least two black
men take part in three of the random shootings.
The plan, announced Wednesday, quickly drew
sharp criticism from a variety of black leaders,
including the Rev. Cecil Williams, minister of Glide
Memorial Methodist Church.
"We are convinced the black community is under
a police state," Williams told a news conference.
"There have been searches and interrogation and a
dragnet taking place like we've never seen in any
city I know of."
Stans Denies Obstruction
NEW YORK — Former Commerce Secretary
Maurice E. Stans told a federal court jury yesterday
that "on my oath, I never did anything to help
Robert Vesco, and I never asked anyone to do
anything."
"Did you ever try to fix a case against Robert
Vesco because of his contribution of $200,000?"
Stans was asked at his trial with one-time Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell on criminal conspiracy charges.
"I certainly did not," he replied. "I never had
such a thought."
Stans and Mitchell are accused of conspiring to
obstruct a Securities and Exchange Commission
fraud investigation of Vesco, an international
financier, in exchange for the $200,000 cash
contribution to the Nixon campaign, then lying to a
grand jury in an effort to conceal the deal.
"Did you wilfully and knowingly give false
information to that grand jury?" Stans was asked by
his defense lawyer, Walter Bonner.
"I certainly did not," Stans said. "On my oath, I
testified to the facts exactly as I knew them."
"Are you guilty or not guilty?" was Bonner's
final question to the witness, duplicating the last
question put to Mitchell when he was under direct
examination earlier in the trial.
"I am not guilty of these charges, believe me,"
Stans replied, in an answer similar to Mitchell's.
