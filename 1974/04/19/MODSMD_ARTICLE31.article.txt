# Two Auto Accidents

### 
Two students sustained minor injuries in
unrelated automobile accidents last night.
Janet Currie Jones, a senior living in Storey
House, was taken to the Medical Center emergency
room after her car collided with another vehicle at
Dolores and Mayfield Streets about 9 p.m.
X-rays proved negative, according to a hospital
spokesman, but Jones remained in the hospital for
observation of possible head injuries. She was listed
in satisfactory condition after being treated for
minor injuries.
Witnesses said that Jones was driving very fast
south on Mayfield when another car, driven by
junior Holly Thomas, turned left from Dolores
north on Mayfield. Apparently both cars tried to
avoid the collision, because Jones' car hit Thomas'
right front fender. Jones' car continued for another
150 yards before crashing into a telephone pole on
Mayfield. Thomas was unhurt.
At 9:15 p.m., Susan Ball, an undergaduate
residing in Roble Hall, was struck by a car while
crossing Lomita Drive. She was taken to the
hospital, but when x-rays proved negative was taken
to Cowell to spend the night. She was also in
satisfactory condition.
According to a witness, Ball was walking in a
crosswalk between the Black House and Roble when
she was hit by a car proceeding toward Panama
Street on Lomita. Skid marks indicated that the
vehicle was not speeding, a police official said.
The witness indicated that Ball was thrown about
15 feet by the collision, but that she arose and
proceeded to the curb while a passenger in the
vehicle called an ambulance.
The driver's identity is being withheld pending a
California Highway Patrol investigation.
