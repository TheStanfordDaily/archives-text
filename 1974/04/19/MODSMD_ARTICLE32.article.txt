# Yale Protesters Back Disruption
## 
### 
About 200 persons gathered
yesterday at Yale University for a rally
in support of students who prevented
Electrical Engineering Prof. William B.
Shockley from speaking about his
views on genetics Monday night.
The rally was in response to a
Tuesday statement by Yale President
Kingman Brewster Jr. that a
disciplinary committee is considering
what action to take against students
identified among the more than 100
protestors Monday evening.
Brewster said the 70-minute
demonstration that prevented
Shockley from debating his views
violated the principle of free speech.
Shockley was to debate William
Rusher, publisher of the National
Review.
James Davis, a student leader of
yesterday's protest, said at the rally
the question was not free speech. "The
question is: is genocide a debatable
subject on campus."
