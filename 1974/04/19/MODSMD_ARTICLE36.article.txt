# WHITE PLAZA CLEANUP SET FOR TOMORROW
## 
### 
The annual "Rite of Spring"
White Plaza clean-up will be
held tomorrow from 10 a.m. to
1 p.m. Students, faculty and
staff have been invited to don
grubby clothes and help paint
the plaza.
Plant Services and Tresidder
will supply all the paint and
equipment to brighten up the
Dinkelspiel steps, Tresidder
table tops, pillars, walls and
benches around Mem Claw.
The Incomparable Stanford
Band will do its part to "keep
the customers satisfied," and if
music won't do, bread, cheese,
fruit and drinks will be
provided.
