# Herman Slate Elected; All Assessments Pass
## 
### DENIS CUFF RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
ASSU Sen. Mike Herman's slate
squeaked to a narrow victory
yesterday in the Council of Presidents
runoff election.
Herman's ticket defeated one
headed by 800 Bacon, editor of the
Black Students Union paper Real
News, by a 1552-1479 margin.
The lead switched hands several
times during the first half of the
evening, but a sizable Herman plurality
at the Graduate School of Business
provided the surge that put him on
top.
Herman and his running mates —
ASSU Course Review financial
manager Ann Carter, law student and
ASSU Sen. Len Mackey and ASSU
Sen. Quinn Mayer — campaigned on a
platform strongly emphasizing
increased student services.

The Bacon slate — which led the
divided field in last week's primary —
had the unanimous endorsement of
the current Council of Presidents
headed by Kevin O'Grady.
Assessments Passed
Besides electing Herman, student
voters:
—approved all six fee assessments
on the ballot;
—passed a referendum calling for
the invitation of South Vietnamese
political prisoner Nguyen Huu Thai as
an ASSU guest professor;
— approved constitutional
amendments for removing members of
the Nominations Committee and
delaying for a week the date of the
next Presidential election;
—and defeated an amendment that
would have shifted Senate elections
from the fall to the spring.
Members of next year's senior class
also voted slates headed by David
Antonuccio and Lise Pfeiffer into a
runoff. No date has yet been set for
the runoff.
PIRG Future Cloudy
The fee assessment results were
clouded by University officials at the
election headquarters, who indicated
they may not collect funds voted by
the students to fund the
consumer-advocate Northern
California Public Interest Research
Group (PIRG).
The controversy involves a possible
conflict between PIRG's function and
the charitable tax laws which give the
University its tax exempt status.
"The University will not collect
fees for a group that does not directly
benefit students," said Dale Snape,
assistant to the Dean of Student
Affairs. He said the University can't
decide on the fee assessment collection
until it knows the Stanford PIRG's
function, bylaws and relationship
with Northern California PIRG
headquarters. So far, Stanford PIRG
has not supplied this information,

Snape said.
Snape said he plans to discuss the
issue with University legal adviser
James V. Siena and Stanford PIRG
Director Jack Handy in the near
future. (Handy, along with ASSU Sen.
Maria Echaveste and SWOPSI Board
Chairwoman Chris Baron, were vice
presidential candidates on the defeated
Bacon slate.)
Lowest Vote
The PIRG assessment received the
lowest vote of any — 63.4 percent
approval. KZSU proved the most
popular assessment, capturing 71.4
percent. Voters also funded the Legal
Counseling Office, the Band, the
ASSU Speakers Bureau, and the ASSU
Guest Professorship program.
The defeated constitutional
amendment on the Senate election
date received a 59.5 percent favorable
vote, but needed two-thirds approval
for passage.
Herman attributed his slate's
victory to its strong promotion of
student services, including proposals
for a student store and a lecture
outline series.
A disappointed Bacon disagreed
about the cause of his loss: "I
attribute it to two things,
complacency and reactionism.
Complacency on the part of those who
thought we'd win; reactionism because
the charges against us centered on our
slate's interests and the color of our
skin."

MIKE HERMAN
ASSU Sen. Mike Herman's slate
squeaked to a narrow victory
yesterday in the Council of Presidents
runoff election.
Herman's ticket defeated one
headed by 800 Bacon, editor of the
Black Students Union paper Real
News, by a 1552-1479 margin.
The lead switched hands several
times during the first half of the
evening, but a sizable Herman plurality
at the Graduate School of Business
provided the surge that put him on
top.
Herman and his running mates —
ASSU Course Review financial
manager Ann Carter, law student and
ASSU Sen. Len Mackey and ASSU
Sen. Quinn Mayer — campaigned on a
platform strongly emphasizing
increased student services.

The Bacon slate — which led the
divided field in last week's primary —
had the unanimous endorsement of
the current Council of Presidents
headed by Kevin O'Grady.
Assessments Passed
Besides electing Herman, student
voters:
—approved all six fee assessments
on the ballot;
—passed a referendum calling for
the invitation of South Vietnamese
political prisoner Nguyen Huu Thai as
an ASSU guest professor;
— approved constitutional
amendments for removing members of
the Nominations Committee and
delaying for a week the date of the
next Presidential election;
—and defeated an amendment that
would have shifted Senate elections
from the fall to the spring.
Members of next year's senior class
also voted slates headed by David
Antonuccio and Lise Pfeiffer into a
runoff. No date has yet been set for
the runoff.
PIRG Future Cloudy
The fee assessment results were
clouded by University officials at the
election headquarters, who indicated
they may not collect funds voted by
the students to fund the
consumer-advocate Northern
California Public Interest Research
Group (PIRG).
The controversy involves a possible
conflict between PIRG's function and
the charitable tax laws which give the
University its tax exempt status.
"The University will not collect
fees for a group that does not directly
benefit students," said Dale Snape,
assistant to the Dean of Student
Affairs. He said the University can't
decide on the fee assessment collection
until it knows the Stanford PIRG's
function, bylaws and relationship
with Northern California PIRG
headquarters. So far, Stanford PIRG
has not supplied this information,

Snape said.
Snape said he plans to discuss the
issue with University legal adviser
James V. Siena and Stanford PIRG
Director Jack Handy in the near
future. (Handy, along with ASSU Sen.
Maria Echaveste and SWOPSI Board
Chairwoman Chris Baron, were vice
presidential candidates on the defeated
Bacon slate.)
Lowest Vote
The PIRG assessment received the
lowest vote of any — 63.4 percent
approval. KZSU proved the most
popular assessment, capturing 71.4
percent. Voters also funded the Legal
Counseling Office, the Band, the
ASSU Speakers Bureau, and the ASSU
Guest Professorship program.
The defeated constitutional
amendment on the Senate election
date received a 59.5 percent favorable
vote, but needed two-thirds approval
for passage.
Herman attributed his slate's
victory to its strong promotion of
student services, including proposals
for a student store and a lecture
outline series.
A disappointed Bacon disagreed
about the cause of his loss: "I
attribute it to two things,
complacency and reactionism.
Complacency on the part of those who
thought we'd win; reactionism because
the charges against us centered on our
slate's interests and the color of our
skin."
