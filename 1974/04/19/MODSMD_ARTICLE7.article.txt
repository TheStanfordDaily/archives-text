# Centrex Takes Effect Today
## 
### BONITA B. RODDEN 
The University will switch to the Centralized Telephone
Exchange System (Centrex) in stages today from 5 p.m.
until midnight, according to Bruce Wiggins, operations
manager for Plant Services.
During the weekend, Pacific Telephone crew will
investigate all reported troubles in order to have the system
completely operational by Monday, Wiggins said.
The new system will consolidate Hansen Laboratories,
the Medical Center and the Stanford Electronics
Laboratories (SEL) with the University switchboard.
Stanford's telephone center will be moved from White Plaza
to the new Telecommunications building on Bonair Siding.
Centrex will allow "direct inward dialing and direct
outward dialing," Wiggins said. He added that the
"capability of avoiding the operator" will greatly alleviate
the overburdened lines.
At 5 p.m. today the direct inward and outward dialing
trunklines between the Telecommunications building and
Pacific Telephone's central Palo Alto office will be "hooked
up," Wiggins said.
The dialing change will not go into effect until the
present system is disconnected at 9 p.m., however.
Direct Dialing
Therefore, at 9 p.m. tonight it will be possible for
someone calling from a phone outside the University
business system to dial a University extension directly using
the prefix 497. Someone using a University system phone
will dial the extension plus a prefix of 7.
There will still be a central information number (71411
from an extension and 497-2300 for others) for those who
do not know an extension.
The operator, now termed console attendant, will
connect a caller with the extension but will urge him or her

to dial directly next time.
If a person calls the old central number, 321-2300,
during the first few weeks, an intercept operator will
explain the new system and give the caller the new
extension number.
Foreign exchange lines (frequently misttymed tie-lines),
will also change at 9 p.m. At the time the 7 prefix in the
foreign exchange numbers will be switched to 5. It will no
longer be possible to call Pacifica on the San Mateo line
(pre-Centrex—7B, Centrex—sB).
Three-Minute Switch
The major switch-overs will take about three minutes.
However, due to technical complications, service to Hansen
Laboratories and SEL may be interrrupted for up to four
hours starting at 6 p.m., Wiggins said.
University emergency numbers will be changed at 8:30
p.m. From extensions, the new all-purpose emergency
number for police, fire and ambulance will be 71911. From
all other phones it will be 497-1911. The police and fire
departments will also keep their present numbers, 321-3232
and 322-6868 respectively.
The utility emergency numbers will be changed to
72281 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and
to 71914 after working hours. For non-extension phones
the numbers will be 497-2281 and 497-1914.
At midnight tonight the Medical Center will switch to
Centrex.
There are a few major differences between Centrex and
the previous system. First of all, a small electronic console
will replace the traditional switchboard.
Long distance calls can be made by dialing 9, the area
code and the number instead of going through the operator.
There will also be new rate and billing systems.

There will still be a central information number (71411
from an extension and 497-2300 for others) for those who
do not know an extension.
The operator, now termed console attendant, will
connect a caller with the extension but will urge him or her

to dial directly next time.
If a person calls the old central number, 321-2300,
during the first few weeks, an intercept operator will
explain the new system and give the caller the new
extension number.
Foreign exchange lines (frequently misttymed tie-lines),
will also change at 9 p.m. At the time the 7 prefix in the
foreign exchange numbers will be switched to 5. It will no
longer be possible to call Pacifica on the San Mateo line
(pre-Centrex—7B, Centrex—sB).
Three-Minute Switch
The major switch-overs will take about three minutes.
However, due to technical complications, service to Hansen
Laboratories and SEL may be interrrupted for up to four
hours starting at 6 p.m., Wiggins said.
University emergency numbers will be changed at 8:30
p.m. From extensions, the new all-purpose emergency
number for police, fire and ambulance will be 71911. From
all other phones it will be 497-1911. The police and fire
departments will also keep their present numbers, 321-3232
and 322-6868 respectively.
The utility emergency numbers will be changed to
72281 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and
to 71914 after working hours. For non-extension phones
the numbers will be 497-2281 and 497-1914.
At midnight tonight the Medical Center will switch to
Centrex.
There are a few major differences between Centrex and
the previous system. First of all, a small electronic console
will replace the traditional switchboard.
Long distance calls can be made by dialing 9, the area
code and the number instead of going through the operator.
There will also be new rate and billing systems.
The University will switch to the Centralized Telephone
Exchange System (Centrex) in stages today from 5 p.m.
until midnight, according to Bruce Wiggins, operations
manager for Plant Services.
During the weekend, Pacific Telephone crew will
investigate all reported troubles in order to have the system
completely operational by Monday, Wiggins said.
The new system will consolidate Hansen Laboratories,
the Medical Center and the Stanford Electronics
Laboratories (SEL) with the University switchboard.
Stanford's telephone center will be moved from White Plaza
to the new Telecommunications building on Bonair Siding.
Centrex will allow "direct inward dialing and direct
outward dialing," Wiggins said. He added that the
"capability of avoiding the operator" will greatly alleviate
the overburdened lines.
At 5 p.m. today the direct inward and outward dialing
trunklines between the Telecommunications building and
Pacific Telephone's central Palo Alto office will be "hooked
up," Wiggins said.
The dialing change will not go into effect until the
present system is disconnected at 9 p.m., however.
Direct Dialing
Therefore, at 9 p.m. tonight it will be possible for
someone calling from a phone outside the University
business system to dial a University extension directly using
the prefix 497. Someone using a University system phone
will dial the extension plus a prefix of 7.
