Endorsement Error
Editor:
I would like to correct a slight
oversight in one of the campaign
posters for the Herman slate.
Although I discussed the
possibility with Ann Carter over a
week ago, I never formally
endorsed the Herman, Carter,
Mackey, Mayer ticket. I did
consider the possibility of a
Course Review endorsement and
talked it over with Jim Lobsenz,
the editor for the social sciences,
who told me that he himself was
contemplating endorsing the
Bacon slate. Since we could not
agree on this matter, we decided
to forget about it.
Tuesday, April 16, Ann Carter
called me at home in the morning
when I was in class and left a
message asking me to call her
back. I called her room at about 6
p.m. and talked to Len Mackey. I
told him that Jim and I could not
agree upon whom to endors« and
that I fel it would be wrong to put
my name in an endorsement with
the title "Editor — ASSU Course
Review," since I had no right to
speak for the organization as a
whole. I told him that I might
have been willing to have my
name listed in an endorsement
without my title, but thought this
would do them little good.
I would have been reluctant to
do even this since I realized that I
would have made the
endorsement only on the basis of
what I know about Ann Carter
who has done an excellent job so
far in her position as Business
Editor of the Course Review and
not on the basis of what I know
about the other candidates whom
I am not familiar with. Len
Mackey told me that it was too
late anyway since the poster had
already gone off to press. I
interpreted this to mean that it
was too late to include my name
in the poster, but now realize that
he meant it was too late to delete
it.

On Sigma Chi
Editor:
What type of empathy does the
Sigma Chi Frat expect to stir
when they are allegedly
represented by members who
engage in activities which reflect
the ignorance, bitterness,
prejudice and wild generalizations
with which they express
themselves?
I am referring to Michael
Grasty's article in the April 16
Daily. To cry over a sign, I think,
is ridiculous and to include Native
Americans in your accusations
when you aren't certain, is even
more ignorant than the so-called
"vandals[?j." Surely you didn't
think your sign was to emerge
unwounded in "the battle of the
Stanford graffiti on the Law
School fence"? I can assure you
not one Native American
participated in this ordeal and I
am hereby demanding that Sigma
Chi submit a public apology to
the Native American Community.
Sigma Chi should have better
things to do than to devote hours
to a sign since they are "based on
high ideals." Furthermore,
personally I don't condemn the
actions of my Chicano brothers
and sisters. They are involved in a
struggle that strives for the
betterment of their people, but
they are sometimes overpowered
by a thing called "white society."
Native Americans are involved
in a similar struggle. However, we
have been fighting "white
society" for three and a half
centuries now with very little
progress. We Native Americans
and the Chicanos are too involved
in our own plights; we can't help
each other as much as we want to.
Michael Grasty, think and find
the facts before you speak.

Housing Fairness
Editor:
As a fairly rational Stanford
graduate, I feel compelled to
respond to Katherine Draznin's
emotional article in the April 17
Daily about the unfairness of
Stanford's housing system.
1. Off-campus housing only
costs $125-$l5O per month if you
live alone. I have lived off-campus
for two and one-half years in a
wonderful house in Menlo Park,
10 minutes biking distance from
campus. My rent is $66.25 per
month, and food is about $50 per
month. I do live with three other
people, but four people are also
needed to fill a trailer. My living
situation is cheaper and
incomparably nicer than a trailer.
2. Draznin's suggestion that
Palo Alto residents be denied the
opportunity to live on-campus
shows an incredible lack of
fairness and sensitivity. No one
should be forced to live with his
parents. That would deny a
person half the fun of going to
college!
3. Draznin claims that
Stanford's housing system is
"riddled with favoritism." This
statement is a vicious lie. I haven't
personally worked in the housing
office, but friends of mine have,
and I became acquainted with its
functioning when I applied for a
job there last fall. I can tell you
that Susan Espinosa and her
assistants work incredibly hard to
be as fair as possible.
There is no favoritism, no
"spoils" in the Stanford housing
system. The utmost objective of
the housing office is to be fair,
and that's the whole truth.
Politics has nothing to do with it.
The priorities that do exist,
and the entire manner in which
the draw is carried out, seem
completely fair to me. Basically,
you are a victim of chance, and
nothing more. Giving priorities to
freshmen and taking them away
from local residents certainly
seems much less fair.
The off-campus housing
situation is not all that bad. Sure,
you have to look around. It takes
time to find a good place, and you
do need to live with a few friends
in order to do it cheaply.
But this is the real world,
Katherine. If "the wait listing and
house hunting" cause you "a
maximum of frustration and
anxiety," all I can say is good
luck, kid — you're going to have
real problems once you leave the
kindly protection of
Stanfordland.

Constitutional Weakness
Editor:
The recent confusion
surrounding the Program Fee
ballot points out a weakness in
the current ASSU Constitution.
The 2214 votes cast represents
21 percent of the student body,
just more .than the 20 percent
required by the Constitution to
validate the vote.
What seems ironic is that had
105 or more of the people who
voted against the measure simply
not voted, the Program Fee would
not have received the necessary 20
percent. In essence, these people
would have done better not to
vote than to cast their ballots.
There must be a better method
of validating a measure such as
this. Perhaps the proposal should
require a minimum positive vote
in order to go into effect. Another
alternative would be no minimum
at all, as with all other fee
assessments.
I hope the ASSU Senate sees
the flaw in the present system and
works to change the constitution
before another situation such as
the one last week occurs.

respond to Katherine Draznin's
emotional article in the April 17
Daily about the unfairness of
Stanford's housing system.
1. Off-campus housing only
costs $125-$l5O per month if you
live alone. I have lived off-campus
for two and one-half years in a
wonderful house in Menlo Park,
10 minutes biking distance from
campus. My rent is $66.25 per
month, and food is about $50 per
month. I do live with three other
people, but four people are also
needed to fill a trailer. My living
situation is cheaper and
incomparably nicer than a trailer.
2. Draznin's suggestion that
Palo Alto residents be denied the
opportunity to live on-campus
shows an incredible lack of
fairness and sensitivity. No one
should be forced to live with his
parents. That would deny a
person half the fun of going to
college!
3. Draznin claims that
Stanford's housing system is
"riddled with favoritism." This
statement is a vicious lie. I haven't
personally worked in the housing
office, but friends of mine have,
and I became acquainted with its
functioning when I applied for a
job there last fall. I can tell you
that Susan Espinosa and her
assistants work incredibly hard to
be as fair as possible.
There is no favoritism, no
"spoils" in the Stanford housing
system. The utmost objective of
the housing office is to be fair,
and that's the whole truth.
Politics has nothing to do with it.
The priorities that do exist,
and the entire manner in which
the draw is carried out, seem
completely fair to me. Basically,
you are a victim of chance, and
nothing more. Giving priorities to
freshmen and taking them away
from local residents certainly
seems much less fair.
The off-campus housing
situation is not all that bad. Sure,
you have to look around. It takes
time to find a good place, and you
do need to live with a few friends
in order to do it cheaply.
But this is the real world,
Katherine. If "the wait listing and
house hunting" cause you "a
maximum of frustration and
anxiety," all I can say is good
luck, kid — you're going to have
real problems once you leave the
kindly protection of
Stanfordland.

Constitutional Weakness
Editor:
The recent confusion
surrounding the Program Fee
ballot points out a weakness in
the current ASSU Constitution.
The 2214 votes cast represents
21 percent of the student body,
just more .than the 20 percent
required by the Constitution to
validate the vote.
What seems ironic is that had
105 or more of the people who
voted against the measure simply
not voted, the Program Fee would
not have received the necessary 20
percent. In essence, these people
would have done better not to
vote than to cast their ballots.
There must be a better method
of validating a measure such as
this. Perhaps the proposal should
require a minimum positive vote
in order to go into effect. Another
alternative would be no minimum
at all, as with all other fee
assessments.
I hope the ASSU Senate sees
the flaw in the present system and
works to change the constitution
before another situation such as
the one last week occurs.

Endorsement Error
Editor:
I would like to correct a slight
oversight in one of the campaign
posters for the Herman slate.
Although I discussed the
possibility with Ann Carter over a
week ago, I never formally
endorsed the Herman, Carter,
Mackey, Mayer ticket. I did
consider the possibility of a
Course Review endorsement and
talked it over with Jim Lobsenz,
the editor for the social sciences,
who told me that he himself was
contemplating endorsing the
Bacon slate. Since we could not
agree on this matter, we decided
to forget about it.
Tuesday, April 16, Ann Carter
called me at home in the morning
when I was in class and left a
message asking me to call her
back. I called her room at about 6
p.m. and talked to Len Mackey. I
told him that Jim and I could not
agree upon whom to endors« and
that I fel it would be wrong to put
my name in an endorsement with
the title "Editor — ASSU Course
Review," since I had no right to
speak for the organization as a
whole. I told him that I might
have been willing to have my
name listed in an endorsement
without my title, but thought this
would do them little good.
I would have been reluctant to
do even this since I realized that I
would have made the
endorsement only on the basis of
what I know about Ann Carter
who has done an excellent job so
far in her position as Business
Editor of the Course Review and
not on the basis of what I know
about the other candidates whom
I am not familiar with. Len
Mackey told me that it was too
late anyway since the poster had
already gone off to press. I
interpreted this to mean that it
was too late to include my name
in the poster, but now realize that
he meant it was too late to delete
it.

What type of empathy does the
Sigma Chi Frat expect to stir
when they are allegedly
represented by members who
engage in activities which reflect
the ignorance, bitterness,
prejudice and wild generalizations
with which they express
themselves?
I am referring to Michael
Grasty's article in the April 16
Daily. To cry over a sign, I think,
is ridiculous and to include Native
Americans in your accusations
when you aren't certain, is even
more ignorant than the so-called
"vandals[?j." Surely you didn't
think your sign was to emerge
unwounded in "the battle of the
Stanford graffiti on the Law
School fence"? I can assure you
not one Native American
participated in this ordeal and I
am hereby demanding that Sigma
Chi submit a public apology to
the Native American Community.
Sigma Chi should have better
things to do than to devote hours
to a sign since they are "based on
high ideals." Furthermore,
personally I don't condemn the
actions of my Chicano brothers
and sisters. They are involved in a
struggle that strives for the
betterment of their people, but
they are sometimes overpowered
by a thing called "white society."
Native Americans are involved
in a similar struggle. However, we
have been fighting "white
society" for three and a half
centuries now with very little
progress. We Native Americans
and the Chicanos are too involved
in our own plights; we can't help
each other as much as we want to.

week ago, I never formally
endorsed the Herman, Carter,
Mackey, Mayer ticket. I did
consider the possibility of a
Course Review endorsement and
talked it over with Jim Lobsenz,
the editor for the social sciences,
who told me that he himself was
contemplating endorsing the
Bacon slate. Since we could not
agree on this matter, we decided
to forget about it.
Tuesday, April 16, Ann Carter
called me at home in the morning
when I was in class and left a
message asking me to call her
back. I called her room at about 6
p.m. and talked to Len Mackey. I
told him that Jim and I could not
agree upon whom to endors« and
that I fel it would be wrong to put
my name in an endorsement with
the title "Editor — ASSU Course
Review," since I had no right to
speak for the organization as a
whole. I told him that I might
have been willing to have my
name listed in an endorsement
without my title, but thought this
would do them little good.
I would have been reluctant to
do even this since I realized that I
would have made the
endorsement only on the basis of
what I know about Ann Carter
who has done an excellent job so
far in her position as Business
Editor of the Course Review and
not on the basis of what I know
about the other candidates whom
I am not familiar with. Len
Mackey told me that it was too
late anyway since the poster had
already gone off to press. I
interpreted this to mean that it
was too late to include my name
in the poster, but now realize that
he meant it was too late to delete
it.

On Sigma Chi
Editor:
What type of empathy does the
Sigma Chi Frat expect to stir
when they are allegedly
represented by members who
engage in activities which reflect
the ignorance, bitterness,
prejudice and wild generalizations
with which they express
themselves?
I am referring to Michael
Grasty's article in the April 16
Daily. To cry over a sign, I think,
is ridiculous and to include Native
Americans in your accusations
when you aren't certain, is even
more ignorant than the so-called
"vandals[?j." Surely you didn't
think your sign was to emerge
unwounded in "the battle of the
Stanford graffiti on the Law
School fence"? I can assure you
not one Native American
participated in this ordeal and I
am hereby demanding that Sigma
Chi submit a public apology to
the Native American Community.
Sigma Chi should have better
things to do than to devote hours
to a sign since they are "based on
high ideals." Furthermore,
personally I don't condemn the
actions of my Chicano brothers
and sisters. They are involved in a
struggle that strives for the
betterment of their people, but
they are sometimes overpowered
by a thing called "white society."
Native Americans are involved
in a similar struggle. However, we
have been fighting "white
society" for three and a half
centuries now with very little
progress. We Native Americans
and the Chicanos are too involved
in our own plights; we can't help
each other as much as we want to.
Michael Grasty, think and find
the facts before you speak.

Housing Fairness
Editor:
As a fairly rational Stanford
graduate, I feel compelled to
respond to Katherine Draznin's
emotional article in the April 17
Daily about the unfairness of
Stanford's housing system.
1. Off-campus housing only
costs $125-$l5O per month if you
live alone. I have lived off-campus
for two and one-half years in a
wonderful house in Menlo Park,
10 minutes biking distance from
campus. My rent is $66.25 per
month, and food is about $50 per
month. I do live with three other
people, but four people are also
needed to fill a trailer. My living
situation is cheaper and
incomparably nicer than a trailer.
2. Draznin's suggestion that
Palo Alto residents be denied the
opportunity to live on-campus
shows an incredible lack of
fairness and sensitivity. No one
should be forced to live with his
parents. That would deny a
person half the fun of going to
college!
3. Draznin claims that
Stanford's housing system is
"riddled with favoritism." This
statement is a vicious lie. I haven't
personally worked in the housing
office, but friends of mine have,
and I became acquainted with its
functioning when I applied for a
job there last fall. I can tell you
that Susan Espinosa and her
assistants work incredibly hard to
be as fair as possible.
There is no favoritism, no
"spoils" in the Stanford housing
system. The utmost objective of
the housing office is to be fair,
and that's the whole truth.
Politics has nothing to do with it.
The priorities that do exist,
and the entire manner in which
the draw is carried out, seem
completely fair to me. Basically,
you are a victim of chance, and
nothing more. Giving priorities to
freshmen and taking them away
from local residents certainly
seems much less fair.
The off-campus housing
situation is not all that bad. Sure,
you have to look around. It takes
time to find a good place, and you
do need to live with a few friends
in order to do it cheaply.
But this is the real world,
Katherine. If "the wait listing and
house hunting" cause you "a
maximum of frustration and
anxiety," all I can say is good
luck, kid — you're going to have
real problems once you leave the
kindly protection of
Stanfordland.

Constitutional Weakness
Editor:
The recent confusion
surrounding the Program Fee
ballot points out a weakness in
the current ASSU Constitution.
The 2214 votes cast represents
21 percent of the student body,
just more .than the 20 percent
required by the Constitution to
validate the vote.
What seems ironic is that had
105 or more of the people who
voted against the measure simply
not voted, the Program Fee would
not have received the necessary 20
percent. In essence, these people
would have done better not to
vote than to cast their ballots.
There must be a better method
of validating a measure such as
this. Perhaps the proposal should
require a minimum positive vote
in order to go into effect. Another
alternative would be no minimum
at all, as with all other fee
assessments.
I hope the ASSU Senate sees
the flaw in the present system and
works to change the constitution
before another situation such as
the one last week occurs.

costs $125-$l5O per month if you
live alone. I have lived off-campus
for two and one-half years in a
wonderful house in Menlo Park,
10 minutes biking distance from
campus. My rent is $66.25 per
month, and food is about $50 per
month. I do live with three other
people, but four people are also
needed to fill a trailer. My living
situation is cheaper and
incomparably nicer than a trailer.
2. Draznin's suggestion that
Palo Alto residents be denied the
opportunity to live on-campus
shows an incredible lack of
fairness and sensitivity. No one
should be forced to live with his
parents. That would deny a
person half the fun of going to
college!
3. Draznin claims that
Stanford's housing system is
"riddled with favoritism." This
statement is a vicious lie. I haven't
personally worked in the housing
office, but friends of mine have,
and I became acquainted with its
functioning when I applied for a
job there last fall. I can tell you
that Susan Espinosa and her
assistants work incredibly hard to
be as fair as possible.
There is no favoritism, no
"spoils" in the Stanford housing
system. The utmost objective of
the housing office is to be fair,
and that's the whole truth.
Politics has nothing to do with it.
The priorities that do exist,
and the entire manner in which
the draw is carried out, seem
completely fair to me. Basically,
you are a victim of chance, and
nothing more. Giving priorities to
freshmen and taking them away
from local residents certainly
seems much less fair.
The off-campus housing
situation is not all that bad. Sure,
you have to look around. It takes
time to find a good place, and you
do need to live with a few friends
in order to do it cheaply.
But this is the real world,
Katherine. If "the wait listing and
house hunting" cause you "a
maximum of frustration and
anxiety," all I can say is good
luck, kid — you're going to have
real problems once you leave the
kindly protection of
Stanfordland.

Constitutional Weakness
Editor:
The recent confusion
surrounding the Program Fee
ballot points out a weakness in
the current ASSU Constitution.
The 2214 votes cast represents
21 percent of the student body,
just more .than the 20 percent
required by the Constitution to
validate the vote.
What seems ironic is that had
105 or more of the people who
voted against the measure simply
not voted, the Program Fee would
not have received the necessary 20
percent. In essence, these people
would have done better not to
vote than to cast their ballots.
There must be a better method
of validating a measure such as
this. Perhaps the proposal should
require a minimum positive vote
in order to go into effect. Another
alternative would be no minimum
at all, as with all other fee
assessments.
I hope the ASSU Senate sees
the flaw in the present system and
works to change the constitution
before another situation such as
the one last week occurs.
