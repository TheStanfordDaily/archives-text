# Ford Warns Republicans At San Jose Convention
## 
### KEVIN SMITH, WILLIAM ROSS DON COX 
SAN JOSE — Vice President Gerald
R. Ford Saturday cautioned
Republicans not to let Democrats turn
the November elections "into a direct
referendum on President Nixon" and
Watergate.
Ford was the keynote speaker at
the biennial Republican State Central
Committee of California Convention
held Friday and Saturday at the Le
Baron Hotel. Other featured speakers
included Gov. Ronald Reagan, New
York Sen. James Buckley and
numerous candidates for California
offices.
"Let's not let the Democrats set the
rules and call the shots," Ford said.
Referring to Watergate, he warned,
"If we Republicans permit ourselves to
become endlessly embroiled in that
issue, we will forfeit elections from
coast to coast."

The Vice President said that some
Democrats were predicting a "net gain
of 100 seats in the House" for the
Democratic Party in the November
elections.
'Back To 1936'
"If that happens," Ford said, "it
would put us back to the year
1936.... It means a totally
veto-proof Congress."
"That kind of power would be
legislative dictatorship of the worst
kind and we must prevent it," Ford
declared.
As he has done in the past, Ford
blasted the Committee to Re-Elect the
President (CREEP) which managed
President Nixon's 1972 campaign. "1
am disgusted .. . with the trickery of
the CREEP variety, or any other
CREEPs," he said.
'Not A '76 Candidate'
In a press conference after his
speech. Ford reiterated that he was
"not a candidate for any political
office in '76."
He further said he thought "it
would be a great mistake for the
President to resign. It would create in
the minds of many people that he is
guilty."
Earlier in the day, Ford appeared at
the San Jose Hyatt House with Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park,
Rep. John Rousseiot, R-Arcadia and
congressional candidate George Milias.
He urged Republicans to elect
representatives from "all parts of the
political spectrum."
Wide-Based Party
Ford noted that McCloskey and
Rousseiot represent respectively the
liberal and conservative wings of the
Republican Party, while he and Milias
are "in the middle."
"The Republican Party has a
breadth of political views," Ford
stated. "The input that comes from
many sources is the strength of the
party."
Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke, a candidate
for governor, told a very favorable
crowd Friday afternoon that
Americans are "sick and tired of the

kind of nonsense they're seeing
coming out of Mr. Jaworski's office."
Reinecke was recently indicted by a
federal grand jury, under the direction
of Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski,
for three counts of perjury.
To a cheering crowd, Reinecke
declared, "I intend to fight Mr.
Jaworski and all of his political
shenanigans, his delays, and his
motions — whatever he wants to call
them — because, let's face it, this is a
purge of the entire Republican Party,
not just of one man."
At a press conference Saturday,
Reinecke called Jaworski "an
honorable man," but claimed that
Jaworski's staff had been hired by
former Special Prosecutor Archibald
Cox who, Reinecke said, is allied
"with the Kennedy dynasty."
Reinecke charged that the men in
the Special Prosecutor's office were
working to have Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., elected President in
1976.
Reinecke, explaining his own
indictment, said, "Senator Kennedy
would not like to see a Republican
governor in California."
Denies Charges
The Lieutenant Governor insisted
that he was "absolutely not guilty" of
the charges stemming from his alleged
involvement with ITT (International
Telephone and Telegraph) in originally
scheduling the 1972 GOP convention
in San Diego. "All I was doing was
bringing jobs to California," Reinecke
claimed.
Reagan, during his dinnertime
speech Friday night, praised
Republican administrators while
lashing out at Democrats.
He said that in California, "There
are almost 400,000 fewer people on
welfare than there were three years
ago.
"The Vietnam War dragged on for
almost 10 years, but a Republican
President ended that war in 1973 just
as another Republican ended another
war in 1953," Reagan continued.

GOP LEADERS — Vice-President Gerald Ford and Governor Ronald Reagan smile for the camera during Saturday's
Republican State Central Committee Convention in San Jose. Ford cautioned party regulars against getting caught up in
debates on Watergate, and predicted that big gains for the Democrats in the November Congressional elections would
produce "a legislative dictatorship of the worst kind."
