# Ford Warns Republicans At San Jose Convention
## 
### KEVIN SMITH, WILLIAM ROSS DON COX 
SAN JOSE — Vice President Gerald
R. Ford Saturday cautioned
Republicans not to let Democrats turn
the November elections "into a direct
referendum on President Nixon" and
Watergate.
Ford was the keynote speaker at
the biennial Republican State Central
Committee of California Convention
held Friday and Saturday at the Le
Baron Hotel. Other featured speakers
included Gov. Ronald Reagan, New
York Sen. James Buckley and
numerous candidates for California
offices.
"Let's not let the Democrats set the
rules and call the shots," Ford said.
Referring to Watergate, he warned,
"If we Republicans permit ourselves to
become endlessly embroiled in that
issue, we will forfeit elections from
coast to coast."

The Vice President said that some
Democrats were predicting a "net gain
of 100 seats in the House" for the
Democratic Party in the November
elections.
'Back To 1936'
"If that happens," Ford said, "it
would put us back to the year
1936.... It means a totally
veto-proof Congress."
"That kind of power would be
legislative dictatorship of the worst
kind and we must prevent it," Ford
declared.
As he has done in the past, Ford
blasted the Committee to Re-Elect the
President (CREEP) which managed
President Nixon's 1972 campaign. "1
am disgusted .. . with the trickery of
the CREEP variety, or any other
CREEPs," he said.
'Not A '76 Candidate'
In a press conference after his
speech. Ford reiterated that he was
"not a candidate for any political
office in '76."
He further said he thought "it
would be a great mistake for the
President to resign. It would create in
the minds of many people that he is
guilty."
Earlier in the day, Ford appeared at
the San Jose Hyatt House with Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park,
Rep. John Rousseiot, R-Arcadia and
congressional candidate George Milias.
He urged Republicans to elect
representatives from "all parts of the
political spectrum."
Wide-Based Party
Ford noted that McCloskey and
Rousseiot represent respectively the
liberal and conservative wings of the
Republican Party, while he and Milias
are "in the middle."
"The Republican Party has a
breadth of political views," Ford
stated. "The input that comes from
many sources is the strength of the
party."
Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke, a candidate
for governor, told a very favorable
crowd Friday afternoon that
Americans are "sick and tired of the

kind of nonsense they're seeing
coming out of Mr. Jaworski's office."
Reinecke was recently indicted by a
federal grand jury, under the direction
of Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski,
for three counts of perjury.
To a cheering crowd, Reinecke
declared, "I intend to fight Mr.
Jaworski and all of his political
shenanigans, his delays, and his
motions — whatever he wants to call
them — because, let's face it, this is a
purge of the entire Republican Party,
not just of one man."
At a press conference Saturday,
Reinecke called Jaworski "an
honorable man," but claimed that
Jaworski's staff had been hired by
former Special Prosecutor Archibald
Cox who, Reinecke said, is allied
"with the Kennedy dynasty."
Reinecke charged that the men in
the Special Prosecutor's office were
working to have Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., elected President in
1976.
Reinecke, explaining his own
indictment, said, "Senator Kennedy
would not like to see a Republican
governor in California."
Denies Charges
The Lieutenant Governor insisted
that he was "absolutely not guilty" of
the charges stemming from his alleged
involvement with ITT (International
Telephone and Telegraph) in originally
scheduling the 1972 GOP convention
in San Diego. "All I was doing was
bringing jobs to California," Reinecke
claimed.
Reagan, during his dinnertime
speech Friday night, praised
Republican administrators while
lashing out at Democrats.
He said that in California, "There
are almost 400,000 fewer people on
welfare than there were three years
ago.
"The Vietnam War dragged on for
almost 10 years, but a Republican
President ended that war in 1973 just
as another Republican ended another
war in 1953," Reagan continued.

GOP LEADERS — Vice-President Gerald Ford and Governor Ronald Reagan smile for the camera during Saturday's
Republican State Central Committee Convention in San Jose. Ford cautioned party regulars against getting caught up in
debates on Watergate, and predicted that big gains for the Democrats in the November Congressional elections would
produce "a legislative dictatorship of the worst kind."
He cautioned Republicans that the
same Democratic leadership "which
took control of their convention and
took it far to the left" in 1972 is still
in charge of the Democratic Party.
Special Interests
Blasting the Democrats' common
campaign theme that the Republican
Party is funded by special interests,
Reagan said, "Even Common Cause,
when it counted up the campaign
contributions in 1972 . . . found that
special interests donated twice as
much to Democratic candidates as to
Republican candidates."
"I've never been able to figure it
out," Reagan added, "why a rich
Republican is a fat-cat and a rich
Democrat is a public-spirited
philanthropist."
Buckley, who recently called for
Nixon's resignation, told the
Convention, "We are meeting in the
shadow of Watergate.... But a few
special elections do not a general
election make." He was referring to
the five recent special congressional
elections, four of which were won by
Democrats in previously Republican
districts.
"The gloom-mongers forget that 17
months ago ... Richard Nixon was
elected by a landslide margin of 61
percent," Buckley said. "Nothing has
happened in the past 17 months to
negate the 1972 election or to change
the public's view of what they
themselves want."
'Pygmy Candidates'
State Controller Houston Floumoy,
Reinecke's leading opponent for the
Republican gubernatorial nomination,
claimed Friday that the Democrats
had presented "pygmies at best" as
candidates for governor this year.
"If our state is to have a governor
of true stature, that governor will
come from the Republican Party,"
Floumoy said.

Flournoy praised the Reagan
administration as "one of the finest
administrations California has yet
produced. No loud-talking pygmy will
replace our California giant," he said.
"In November, well win."
Demonstrations
During the events Saturday, about
500 demonstrators picketed in front
of the Leßaron hotel.
The demonstrators, including
Pentagon Papers defendant Anthony
Russo, held a rally late in the morning
and then marched up to the hotel.
Police had blocked .off traffic along
the march route and escorted them to
the hotel shortly after noon.
While march permits issued by the
police called for the demonstrators to
stay within the confines of a parking
lot once they got to the vicinity of the

hotel, the police allowed them to
picket on the sidewalk in front of the
hotel.
Three San Jose Police Dept. tactical
squads kept watch on the
demonstrators and prevented th'*r
entrance into the hotel grounds.
Demonstrators picketed in front
yelling at the delegates for an hour and
a half, and at about 2 p.m., the pickets
marched back to the parking lot where
they had originally gathered.
The demonstrators chanted '\U '
Nixon, throw the bums out" to
delegates peering out windows in the
banquet room where Ford gave his
address.
One delegate noted that "it seems
to be more of a pleasant Saturday
outing than a demonstration."
