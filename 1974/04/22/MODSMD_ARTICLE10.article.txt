# Third World 'Realities' Ignored
##

Jose Padilla

This article is written in reference to the
editorial outcry of a fraternity brother
(Daily, April 16), an outcry spurred by the
tragic violence perpetrated on his wooden
toy. Perhaps the "defacing" should be
considered beyond the context in which it
was placed in the editorial, that is, beyond
the context of an action based on "willful
superficiality."
The statement cries of serious
misunderstandings. The alleged attack was
not directed at a specific element of
fraternalism, as stated, but rather at a symbol
of indifference to third world reality iiiat will
never be seen nor felt by young individuals
busily engrossed in their protracted
childhoods mistakenly considered to be
manhoods. Manhood, like maturity, comes
not with age but with understanding.
Understanding?
It has been rumored that once upon a
time, Stanford Sigma Chi sought liberation
for the black man by being rudely
disobedient to its daddy organization; well,
let me tell Sigma Chi that opening or seeking
to open a fraternity's ivy doors to scattered
colored faces smiling amidst white majorities
is very far from understanding an oppressed
people.

You can drink beer with a brown face, but
that is far removed from peering into the soul
of an oppressed man. So who condemns who
for "willful superficiality"?
Contentment And Conformity
For the man of color who has come to
understand his historical situation as a
member of a cultural collective, the
university fraternal system is a symbol of
contentment and conformity, pleasures
willfully not recognized by those who have
accepted their social roles as potential for
necessary social change.
This perpetuated symbol of indifference
based on contentment reflects inculcated
characteristics in a progeny very uncritical of
its inherited society. So as you inherit your
indifferent characteristics and your society,
so people of color inherit their obsequious
relation to that world as well.
And if inequity and injustice plague that
system, the role of "difference" is taken by
the critical man, and not the contented.
But the distinctions are more obvious, as
Grasty's superficial commentary on Che
Guevara readily reveals. This distinction is
one of interpreting historical representations
from different perspectives. The Grastys may
have learned (as it was stated) about Che in

Political Science 119, but that is far from
feeling Guevara's spirit through the sharing of
similar oppressions that confronted him as a
third world man.
Revolutionary Exercise
That, Mr. Fraternity, is an exercise in a
forced third world brotherhood, an exercise
in revolutionary fraternalism. As to the mood
of the moaning commentary, one has to
almost laugh. The implied usage of such
words as "violence" and "tragedy" could not
have been used in a more playful manner.
Perhaps if Grasty could see brown sisters
being beaten by human animals, as 1 did this
past summer in the agricultural fields of
southern California, then he would know
that those words are not used to describe the
painting of phrases on a wooden board.
But let us not be mistaken in thinking that
defacing a graffiti board is a revolutionary
act. It was simply a playful game of symbol
destroying symbol.
But unlike for some of the players, the
game of symbols has to, at some point in
time, be taken seriously for it hides a very
real human violence waged against a very real
third world people.
