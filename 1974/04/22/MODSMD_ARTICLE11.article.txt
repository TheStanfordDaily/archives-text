# Favoritism In The Housing Draw
## 
### 
Katherine Droznin

In response to Robert Douglas'
"emotional" letter (Daily, April
19), I would like to clarify my
position.
Certainly one can live off
campus cheaply with three or four
friends yet Douglas, who, as an
alumnus has not dealt recently
with the Housing Office, does not
explain how returning freshmen
and transfer students with few or
no contacts can find this housing
and roommates.
I also feel that it is not
underhanded to cite rental prices
for a single person since one is
renting as a single person while on
campus.
Of course it is too bad that
someone from the Palo Alto area
does not like their parents — but
what about economics, Douglas?
That is the basis for the problem,
according to the University;
otherwise there would be
adequate and cheap housing on
campus.
People who come to Stanford
to escape their parents aren't
facing the "real world," in my
opinion. And, I truly question if
the purpose of college is to
provide us with a "fun" time.
Politics Involved
It is not a "vicious lie" that
there is favoritism. There is. I
personally am now hassling the
Row Office about my room status
because of an error they made.
There is a hell of a lot of politics
involved, and I can provide a
detailed account to Douglas if he
doesn't believe me.
I am quite certain there is an
attempt to be fair — by Espinosa
and staff — but once the student
enters a dorm or house, there is
the whole realm of roommate
pairing, lists for singles, and room
priorities to deal with.

If that doesn't imply political
manuevering, I don't know what
does. Last year, as a freshman, I
had five different roommates.
They occurred, I had no choice in
the matter. Other people did have
choices, because they knew who
to talk to and they were able to
persuade the persons who made
decisions to favor them over me
and many other people. That is
favoritism, is it not?
Chance Unfair
A "victim of chance" — well,
that simply doesn't satisfy me. I
don't believe chance is fair, nor
does it deal with Douglas' "real
world" as I see it. Economics is
the real world. And there can be a
fair priority system if someone
took the time to think it out.
Finally, I don't find Stanford
to be "protective" at all. I find it

terribly hostile, and I am quite
aware of the contrast to the real
world. In the real world, everyone
is seen as equal by the landlord
because the landlord needs the
tenant.
One has the choice to pay
outrageous rent or low rent, but
one also gets the respect of the
landlord, because the landlord is
providing a service for a price.
You get what you pay for, in
short.
Stanford is very unresponsive
to the individual student's needs
unless the student protests,
pushes, and generally makes
himself obnoxious. In short, they
are not here to serve us, we're
here to serve them. And that is, to
me, a very unfortunate state of
affairs.
I think that before Douglas

attempts to espouse the fairness
of the housing system, he should
take time to interview a random
number of students displaced in
the draw, as well as dissatisfied
campus residents.
Further, Douglas does not
show "sensitivity" to the fact that
many transfer students are forced
to live off campus which creates a
very difficult situation for them.
How does he propose that they
find friends to share expenses
when they are new to the school,
and thus know few people, as well
as to the area in which they must
find housing?
I thank you for your criticisms,
but recommend that you consider
the "realities" of the situation.

renting as a single person while on
campus.
Of course it is too bad that
someone from the Palo Alto area
does not like their parents — but
what about economics, Douglas?
That is the basis for the problem,
according to the University;
otherwise there would be
adequate and cheap housing on
campus.
People who come to Stanford
to escape their parents aren't
facing the "real world," in my
opinion. And, I truly question if
the purpose of college is to
provide us with a "fun" time.
Politics Involved
It is not a "vicious lie" that
there is favoritism. There is. I
personally am now hassling the
Row Office about my room status
because of an error they made.
There is a hell of a lot of politics
involved, and I can provide a
detailed account to Douglas if he
doesn't believe me.
I am quite certain there is an
attempt to be fair — by Espinosa
and staff — but once the student
enters a dorm or house, there is
the whole realm of roommate
pairing, lists for singles, and room
priorities to deal with.

If that doesn't imply political
manuevering, I don't know what
does. Last year, as a freshman, I
had five different roommates.
They occurred, I had no choice in
the matter. Other people did have
choices, because they knew who
to talk to and they were able to
persuade the persons who made
decisions to favor them over me
and many other people. That is
favoritism, is it not?
Chance Unfair
A "victim of chance" — well,
that simply doesn't satisfy me. I
don't believe chance is fair, nor
does it deal with Douglas' "real
world" as I see it. Economics is
the real world. And there can be a
fair priority system if someone
took the time to think it out.
Finally, I don't find Stanford
to be "protective" at all. I find it

terribly hostile, and I am quite
aware of the contrast to the real
world. In the real world, everyone
is seen as equal by the landlord
because the landlord needs the
tenant.
One has the choice to pay
outrageous rent or low rent, but
one also gets the respect of the
landlord, because the landlord is
providing a service for a price.
You get what you pay for, in
short.
Stanford is very unresponsive
to the individual student's needs
unless the student protests,
pushes, and generally makes
himself obnoxious. In short, they
are not here to serve us, we're
here to serve them. And that is, to
me, a very unfortunate state of
affairs.
I think that before Douglas

attempts to espouse the fairness
of the housing system, he should
take time to interview a random
number of students displaced in
the draw, as well as dissatisfied
campus residents.
Further, Douglas does not
show "sensitivity" to the fact that
many transfer students are forced
to live off campus which creates a
very difficult situation for them.
How does he propose that they
find friends to share expenses
when they are new to the school,
and thus know few people, as well
as to the area in which they must
find housing?
I thank you for your criticisms,
but recommend that you consider
the "realities" of the situation.

In response to Robert Douglas'
"emotional" letter (Daily, April
19), I would like to clarify my
position.
Certainly one can live off
campus cheaply with three or four
friends yet Douglas, who, as an
alumnus has not dealt recently
with the Housing Office, does not
explain how returning freshmen
and transfer students with few or
no contacts can find this housing
and roommates.
I also feel that it is not
underhanded to cite rental prices
for a single person since one is
renting as a single person while on
campus.
Of course it is too bad that
someone from the Palo Alto area
does not like their parents — but
