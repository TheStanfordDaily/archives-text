# African Program Planned

Price, Montgomery, Neole

In the last week of May, the fifth grade class of
Belle Haven Elementary School is planning to put
on a production entitled "Project: Survival."
At the beginning of this school year in
September, we happened to be listening to a tape
recording of Attorney Donald Warden's program on
KDIA Radio station entitled "The Matchline" (a
program that we listened to every Monday during
Social Studies Class), when he informed his
listening audience that over 10,000,000 plus of our
black African brothers and sisters were expected to
die because of a severe drought and famine in
Central Africa.
Immediately, the discussion in our classroom
focused on the realities of what we could do to
help save some of these lives. We knew that at
present we were not in a position to send any
money to help our kin; so we decided to spend the
entire school year planning to make a contribution
to the efforts that are now being made by the
Organization of African Unity and the African
Chamber of Commerce to find long-range solutions
to the problems.
Preparations Begun
Since October, we have been preparing the finest
art work to be sold to anyone who comes to our
program in an effort to raise funds for this worthy
cause. Many of the students in the class have given
up a great deal of their free time after school, on
weekdays and even during the holidays in an effort

to help our people.
A conscious effort has been made to make our
art work in many ways relate to Africa so that our
community can develop a strong identification and
respect for our ancestral homeland. The work
comprises large numbers of geometric string
designs in all colors, sizes and shapes, wire
sculpture, rock sculpture, wood carvings of names
of African cities and countries, party pillows,
crochet work and a special work of art to be sent to
Africa in the name of our school and community.
Community Presentation
Also that same evening we hope to be able to
present a program to our community. As of now it
is still in the planning stages. The program will
attempt to highlight African and Afro-American
images that have in many instances been either lost,
stolen, strayed or distorted.
In addition, we will be communicating messages
to the members of our community that will
hopefully be setting goals that will enable
our community to grow and become strong.
It is our sincere hope that all of the members of
our community will plan to make this event a
family affair and make a generous effort to help us
to aid our brothers and sisters in the motherland.
