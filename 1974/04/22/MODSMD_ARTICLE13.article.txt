# Support Panther Party

& Joshua Goldstein S
The Symbionese Liberation
Army frenzy has again come to a
head, following two months of
spectacular daily media coverage.
By now everyone knows of the
SLA and their supposedly
revolutionary goals, and in the
backs of our minds
''revolutionaries" have beer
linked with terrorism and murder.
Now authorities have begun
using the SLA hysteria to crack
down on legitimate groups striving
to change the society.
Last Tuesday at 5 a.m., 50
Oakland and Berkeley police
armed with M-14s and snipec
rifles broke down the door of the
headquarters of last year's
campaign to elect Bobby Seale
mayor of Oakland.
They reportedly found "illegal
weapons" and drugs, and arrested
all 14 occupants of the house on
"conspiracy" charges. Although
reportedly looking for a suspect in
a Berkeley assault case, the
police did not find a suspect.
Lists of precinct workers and
other campaign files were seized
from the house, which is currently
the center for a voter registration
drive in preparation for next
year's Oakland city elections.
14 Arrested
The 14 arrestees were members
of the Black Panther Party
working on survival programs
including the Community
Learning Center, the Seniors
Against a Fearful Environment
(SAFE) escort program, and the
People's Free Health Clinics. The
Learning Center houses the
Intercommunal Youth Institute, a
community-based alternative to
the Oakland public schools, with
100 full-time students aged two to
11.
The Panthers have announced
that they will run five candidates
(a majority) for the City Council,
and two candidates for the School
Board next year.
Lists seized from the house
included names of 3000 campaign
workers already lined up to work
in the election. In 1972 the
Panthers registered 30,000 new
voters in the Bay Area, and Bobby
Seale last year received 45,000
votes in his bid for mayor.
Bail for the 14 arrestees was
first set at $300,000. Then they
were released on Wednesday when
no evidence could be produced
against them. The raid resembles
the 1969-71 FBI campaign to
exterminate the Panthers.
The police action was a
clear provocation to violence
which fortunately did not
succeed.
Police Agent?
At a news conference in Los
Angeles Tuesday, Donald Freed of
the Citizens Research and
Investigating Committee (CRIC)
said he feels the police raid stems
from the current issue of The
Black Panther newspaper which
presents evidence that Field
Marshal Cinque of the SLA may
in fact be a police agent.
CRIC has investigated Cinque's
background as Donald Defreeze
and believes he is tied to the
high-level Criminal Conspiracy
Section of the Los Angeles police
department.
The Black Panther newspaper
last November 17 "Who Killed
Marcus Foster?") printed an
editorial reading in part:
"It is through such infamous
deeds as the attack on the school
officials and the circulation of
such literature as the letter
claiming responsibility for the
attack by a so-called Symbionese
Liberation Army that these
(reactionary) forces hope to incite
and inflame the Oakland
community against the Party and
the Black community.
"Defense against attacks by the
Party and the community will be
the excuse for wholesale, military
assault."
Assault Begun?
Tuesday's raid, five months
later, may represent the beginning
of such an assault.
Having worked with the
Panther community survival
programs myself, as well as on
Bobby Seale's campaign, I would
like to state my whole-hearted
support for their methods and
goals. I would be glad to help
arrange visits to Oakland for
anyone interested in seeing the
survival programs (321-5059).
The media attention given to
the SLA should not distract us
from supporting more concrete
struggles aimed at actual change.
It is hypocrisy to condemn
revolutionary violence and then
sit by as police attack a
nonviolent, but effective, electoral
organization.
