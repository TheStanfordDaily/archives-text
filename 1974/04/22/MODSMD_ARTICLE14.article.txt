# Speakers Urge Executives To Give Women 'Hand Up'
## 
### WENDY QUINONES 
"If women are to have a fair
chance at making it to the top,
you're the ones who are going to
have to give them a hand up,"
Asst. Prof. Francine Gordon of
Graduate School of Business
lold approximately 150 of the
nation's top corporate officers
and executives Thursday.
Participating in a day-long
conference on Women in
Management sponsored by the
Business School Advisory Council,
>,he administrators heard Gordon
and Asst. Business Prof. Myra
Strober, organizers of the
conference, state the major theme
of the day: that their personal
commitment and attention are
required for successful affirmative
action programs for women in
their companies.
Two other speakers were
featured: Colquitt Meacham,
teaching fellow at Harvard Law
School and formerly an assistant
dean for admissions at Boalt Law
School; and Cynthia Fuchs
Epstein, associate professor of
sociology at Queens College in
New York and author of Woman's
Place.
According to its organizers and
to Business School Dean Arjay
Miller, the conference was the
first of its kind. Strober explained
that there have been many
conferences for women on
affirmative action, but none
directed at top management.
"And it's at least as important
to tell the men — who will be
hiring and promoting women —
why and how to bring them into
management," she said.
Legal Overview
In her overview of laws relating
to employment, Meacham stressed
both recent court developments
and the basic antidiscrimination
law, Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act.
In 1972, she reminded her
audience, Title VII was amended
to give the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
the power to sue.
Since then, EEOC has been
able to reach such landmark

settlements as those with the
telephone and steel companies,
requiring both corrective action
and payments of millions of
dollars in back wages.
Maternity Leaves, Benefits
Meacham discussed in detail
the problems of maternity leaves
and benefits. She pointed out that
courts have ruled against
restrictive and unpaid required
maternity leaves.
Meacham also suggested that
permitting a woman to return to
work after childbirth with no loss
of seniority or fringe benefits
could make her "more likely to
view employment as a career
rather than as a mere temporary
source of income."
Epstein citing the "perfect
democracy" with which women
of all types, classes and societies
are excluded from high positions,
charged that, "the greater the
social desirability of a type of
work, the less likely it is that
women are identified with it."
Barriers To Success
The administrative jobs women
are likely to be placed in, she said,
tend to be non-crucial and do not
lead to top jobs. Women who do
make it to the top have been
shown by recent studies to be
almost always widows or
daughters of top men, she said.
In any other context,
according to Epstein, a woman is
denied the knowledge and
experience necessary to obtain
these jobs.
Cultural stereotypes make it
seem inappropriate for her to take
roles of real power and authority,
and the isolated woman in such a
position lacks support both from
male colleagues unaware of her
dilemma and from female
colleagues of whom there often
are none.
Strategies Suggested
Strober emphasized that this
issue of supporting women's
aspirations and achievements is
particularly important in
designing strategies for affirmative
action. "It's crucial," she said,
"because most women have been
socialized to believe that

management, like fatherhood, is
for men."
Breaking this pattern down is
an important factor in both a
short run strategy, designed to
produce immediate benefits for
the company undertaking it, and a
long run strategy, "designed to
bring about slower, more difficult
changes in perceptions about
women and their role in business
and society," said Strober.
In the short run, she showed
that almost no part of traditional
business operations can be left
untouched if barriers to women
are to be broken. It calls for new
interpersonal communications
skills, new search procedures for
employees and new, more flexible
job design for both sexes.
In the long run, Strober said,
companies interested in increasing
women in management must
consider implications of many of
their activities. She specifically
condemned sexist advertising, and
encouraged business to contribute
to non-sexist education for girls as
a means of supporting new
aspirations for women.
"You're always asking, 'Why
can't we find motivated
women?' " she told her audience.
"The answer is simple: you've
already spent 20 years
discouraging those aspirations."
Relying On Tradition
In contrast to Strober, Gordon
stressed reliance on traditional
management tools as a means of
success in affirmative action
programs.
Constant monitoring, explicit
goals and a system of rewards and
punishments for success or failure
in meeting those goals are
important ingredients for success,
Gordon stated.
But she, like the other
speakers, stressed that the direct
involvement of top management is
essential. "These are things that
you, and you alone, can do," she
said.
