# Guru: Reject 'Physical Mind'
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Guru Sri Chinmoy told a
throng of 400 at Memorial Church
Friday night that men must
concern themselves with the
reality of the heart and discard
the unreality of the skeptical
mind when dealing with spiritual
matters.
"Renounce the physical mind
— it leads to self doubt,"
Chinmoy told his followers, many
of whom came adorned in gaily
colored or sterling white attire.
"The questioning mind cannot be
illuminated," said the Sri, himself
dressed in a white toga top over a
pink pleated dress.
Chinmoy spoke for nearly an
hour in a monotone punctuated
by approximately 10 chants of
"om,"
Scant light penetrated the altar

of the chapel on which Chinmoy
sat, prompting one student, John
Rubenstein, to comment, "He
looked like a shadow preaching
bliss."
Approaching Knowledge
Chinmoy continually
advocated approaching knowledge
with few preconceptions, as he
does. "I am not God," he said. "I
merely realize the supreme within
me and the holy and the love ... I
am constantly relearning how to
unite with God ... 1 seek the
truth like a child."
He encouraged learning
through "information, not
elimination" and said the reading
of holy books might be the best
way of attaining knowledge.
But students of the spiritual
should not approach sources of
knowledge with a wary eye, he
said.
"Life has taught me I am
indispensable. I need God for
perfect perfection. God needs me

as His manifestation on earth."
Chinmoy came down hard on
egoism. "The 'I,' the puny 'I*
consciousness is a
nothingness . . . One should just
'be' . . . God consciousness is the
internal pilot."
Exclude, Include
"Life has taught me how to
exclude and include," the Sri
stated. "How to include realities
and how to exclude
unrealities ... When I see that I
am of God and for God, I become
the fulfillment of reality. When 1
see that I am of myself and for
myself, I become the Self —
UNREALITY.
"Unreality lies, conceals and
kills. Reality expands and
transcends. Unreality dies and
dies."
Continuing his attack upon
over-concern for the self,
Chinmoy said, "If I take the body
consciousness as my life, then I
can learn nothing from life.

Become one with the soul
consciousness, leave body
consciousness. Learn some thing,
march forward to my
transcendental goal."
Success
Chinmoy revealed his success
in applying his philosophy to his
life: "I have learned how to love
and live, how to live and love,
how to love and love, and how to
live and live."
But, he went on, the present is
only a stepping stone toward a
blissful future. "Today's
perfection is the beginning of
tomorrow's higher and more
illuminating perfection."
The Sri, said to be the most
placid of the current coterie of
gurus on the world scene, allowed
for "spiritual questions" from the
audience. Much of the crowd was
unswayed by Chinmoy's
platitudes, and sought to probe
his guruic manner.
"There can be only one guru —
the Supreme," Chinmoy
responded. "Human beings can
only be masters [teachers]. They
[masters | are just more
illuminated than others. But the
heart is superior to the mind. You
should only get a guru if you are
ready to sacrifice your heart to
his."
Chinmoy made one obvious
reference to his well-publicized
colleague in the spiritual
profession, 16-year-old Guru
Maharaj Ji: "A guru cannot claim
to be God . . . The elder knows
more than the younger . . . listen
to your higher part."
A follower of the Sri revealed
afterward that he had once asked
Chinmoy specifically about
Maharaj Ji (referred to derisively
as "that fat boy" in portions of
India, the Sri's native land).
Chinmoy, however, begged off
criticism of his fellow, telling the
disciple, "All I know is about me.
I cannot tell you about other
people."

in applying his philosophy to his
life: "I have learned how to love
and live, how to live and love,
how to love and love, and how to
live and live."
But, he went on, the present is
only a stepping stone toward a
blissful future. "Today's
perfection is the beginning of
tomorrow's higher and more
illuminating perfection."
The Sri, said to be the most
placid of the current coterie of
gurus on the world scene, allowed
for "spiritual questions" from the
audience. Much of the crowd was
unswayed by Chinmoy's
platitudes, and sought to probe
his guruic manner.
"There can be only one guru —
the Supreme," Chinmoy
responded. "Human beings can
only be masters [teachers]. They
[masters | are just more
illuminated than others. But the
heart is superior to the mind. You
should only get a guru if you are
ready to sacrifice your heart to
his."
Chinmoy made one obvious
reference to his well-publicized
colleague in the spiritual
profession, 16-year-old Guru
Maharaj Ji: "A guru cannot claim
to be God . . . The elder knows
more than the younger . . . listen
to your higher part."
A follower of the Sri revealed
afterward that he had once asked
Chinmoy specifically about
Maharaj Ji (referred to derisively
as "that fat boy" in portions of
India, the Sri's native land).
Chinmoy, however, begged off
criticism of his fellow, telling the
disciple, "All I know is about me.
I cannot tell you about other
people."
Guru Sri Chinmoy told a
throng of 400 at Memorial Church
Friday night that men must
concern themselves with the
reality of the heart and discard
the unreality of the skeptical
mind when dealing with spiritual
matters.
"Renounce the physical mind
— it leads to self doubt,"
Chinmoy told his followers, many
of whom came adorned in gaily
colored or sterling white attire.
"The questioning mind cannot be
illuminated," said the Sri, himself
dressed in a white toga top over a
pink pleated dress.
Chinmoy spoke for nearly an
hour in a monotone punctuated
by approximately 10 chants of
"om,"
Scant light penetrated the altar

of the chapel on which Chinmoy
sat, prompting one student, John
Rubenstein, to comment, "He
looked like a shadow preaching
bliss."
Approaching Knowledge
Chinmoy continually
advocated approaching knowledge
with few preconceptions, as he
does. "I am not God," he said. "I
merely realize the supreme within
me and the holy and the love ... I
am constantly relearning how to
unite with God ... 1 seek the
truth like a child."
He encouraged learning
through "information, not
elimination" and said the reading
of holy books might be the best
way of attaining knowledge.
But students of the spiritual
should not approach sources of
knowledge with a wary eye, he
said.
"Life has taught me I am
indispensable. I need God for
perfect perfection. God needs me

as His manifestation on earth."
Chinmoy came down hard on
egoism. "The 'I,' the puny 'I*
consciousness is a
nothingness . . . One should just
'be' . . . God consciousness is the
internal pilot."
Exclude, Include
"Life has taught me how to
exclude and include," the Sri
stated. "How to include realities
and how to exclude
unrealities ... When I see that I
am of God and for God, I become
the fulfillment of reality. When 1
see that I am of myself and for
myself, I become the Self —
UNREALITY.
"Unreality lies, conceals and
kills. Reality expands and
transcends. Unreality dies and
dies."
Continuing his attack upon
over-concern for the self,
Chinmoy said, "If I take the body
consciousness as my life, then I
can learn nothing from life.

Become one with the soul
consciousness, leave body
consciousness. Learn some thing,
march forward to my
transcendental goal."
Success
Chinmoy revealed his success
in applying his philosophy to his
life: "I have learned how to love
and live, how to live and love,
how to love and love, and how to
live and live."
But, he went on, the present is
only a stepping stone toward a
