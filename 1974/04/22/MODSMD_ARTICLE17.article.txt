# L.A. Track Powers Coast Over Rivals
## 
### MARK WHITE 
As expected, the top two track
powers in the country easily
brushed aside Northern opponents
in last Saturday's double-dual
track meet at Stanford Stadium.
USC won 93 i /2-51'/2 over an
inspired Cal contingent, while an
equally valiant Stanford squad
succumbed to a juggled UCLA
lineup 99-46.
And although performances
were of the calibre to yield good
marks and to keep the crowd of
12,000 pleased, two factors
prevented world class
performances many of the
athletes were capable of.
First, it is that time of the
track season when athletes are
rounding into top shape, but
mentally are idling.
Championships are coming up
next month and no veteran wants
to peak too early. And as the
athletes are functioning at high
levels of efficiency, coaches don't
want their stars overworked to the
point of being burned out.
As a result, the top two 440
men in college, Maxie Parks and
Benny Brown, and two of the best
west-coast sprinters, Sammy
Burns and Gordon Peppars,
shouldered half the load they
normally would. Two fine
distance runners, Gordon Innes
and Curtis Beck, did not run in
their specialties.
Secondly, both USC and
UCLA, covertly and overtly, held
something back in preparatory
maneuvering for their May 4
showdown meet in Los Angeles.
Neither team wanted to show the
other potential strengths and
weaknesses of their final lineups.
USC Sandbagging?
"1 can't understand it," said
UCLA coach Jim Bush with a
frown, "USC is a good team and
yet they competed so badly here.
They may have been sandbagging
— holding back something for us.
They did this last year; they ran a
bad meet to try and lull us asleep
and then came back hotter than a
firecracker against us.
"But as far as UCLA goes, I am
always pleased with this team. We
shifted several guys around — to
give somebody special speed work
here, strength work in another
case — and they came up with
their usual spirited performance."
One who was especially

spirited was Bruin sprinter Dotson
Wilson, the meet's only double
winner. Wilson took early leads in
both the 100 and 220 and held
off late charges from Card Marvin
Holmes to win both sprints.
"Dotson has had just a great
attitude," said Bush. "He is now
coming into his own."
"I attribute my success to
dedication and confidence,"
Wilson said, and added, with
typical Bruin foresightedness,
"and in two weeks | against USC]
I am going to win the 100, 220
and relay."
Distance Wins
Confidence also had something
to do with sparkling Card
performances in the distance
races. Stanford freshman Steve
Crowley was third in the
combined mile run at the 880
mark behind UCLA's Mark
Luevano who led the race at
2:02.9. Crowley then stayed in
the midst of the front-running
pack until he accelerated with 220
yards to go and sprinted away
from the field on the backstretch
for a 20 yard victory in a lifetime
best of 4:10.5.
Tony Sandoval also had a
lifetime best when he demolished
the field with a 120 yard 13:45.4
victory in the three-mile.
Following a 4:32 mile, Sandoval
took the lead en route to a
blistering 9:07.4 two-mile which
saw him open an 80 yard lead
over the field. Sandy coasted the
rest of the way and said after the
race, "All I can say is that it is a
nice day."
One of the meet's more
exciting finishes came in the 440
hurdles. UCLA's Tom Kight and
Lynnsey Guerrero held big leads
over Cards Matt Hogsett and Dave
Bagshaw at the 330 mark, but
coming down the backstretch
Hogsett made his patented late
surge. Guerrero held on for the
victory over Hogsett, but Bagshaw
outlunged Kight for third in one
of the most crowd-pleasing
finishes of the day.
"I feel good about the race
[52.2] even though I came in
second," said Hogsett. "Guerrero
and I are damn near the same
runner and we knew that the
finish would be a bloody, kicking,
screaming mess. It came down to
who would make the mistake and
I made it."
Other Events
In the 120 high hurdles
Bagshaw led a Stanford sweep in
14.6, as UCLA entered no
hurdlers to force better times.
Card jumper Mike Hall had the
unenviable task of challenging the
leading triple jumper in the
nation, Clarence Taylor. While
Taylor won in 52-2, Hall
improved on his lifetime best by
IV2 feet, soaring 49-ll l/ 4 for
second place.
Similarly, Ken Kring had to
challenge the nation's number
four long jumper, Jerry Herndon,
and although the latter won at
25-0, Kring came up with a
lifetime best of 23-6'/2, good for
third.
Cal provided more than its
share of excitement against USC.
Bear McKinley Mosley overcame
USC's brilliant trio of high
hurdlers to win in a Cal record
time of 13.8. Cal pulled off
another upset in the 440 relay,
using perfect passes to outsprint
the Trojan quartet, ranked second
in the country, 40.4 to 40.6.
Cal's Rick Brown and Trojan
James Baxter, two of the Pac-8's
top three 880 men, duelled for
770 yards before Brown sprinted
away for an eight yard victory.
"Baxter provides a little extra
pressure, but the important thing
I remember is that I don't want to
' lose," said Brown. "Running
, against USC is okay, but I prefer
the Stanford-Cal rivalry because
it's friendlier. But those two
1 teams | USC and UCLA ] are
incredible; one of them is going to
be the national champ."

USC's brilliant trio of high
hurdlers to win in a Cal record
time of 13.8. Cal pulled off
another upset in the 440 relay,
using perfect passes to outsprint
the Trojan quartet, ranked second
in the country, 40.4 to 40.6.
Cal's Rick Brown and Trojan
James Baxter, two of the Pac-8's
top three 880 men, duelled for
770 yards before Brown sprinted
away for an eight yard victory.
"Baxter provides a little extra
pressure, but the important thing
I remember is that I don't want to
' lose," said Brown. "Running
, against USC is okay, but I prefer
the Stanford-Cal rivalry because
it's friendlier. But those two
1 teams | USC and UCLA ] are
incredible; one of them is going to
be the national champ."

YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING - UCLA's Steve Mott looks
incredulous while protesting a line call during his 7-5, 5-7, 7-5 loss to
Stanford's Jim Delaney Saturday. The bipartisan audience of 7200
cheered both players during the match in Maples Pavilion.
As expected, the top two track
powers in the country easily
brushed aside Northern opponents
in last Saturday's double-dual
track meet at Stanford Stadium.
USC won 93 i /2-51'/2 over an
inspired Cal contingent, while an
equally valiant Stanford squad
succumbed to a juggled UCLA
lineup 99-46.
And although performances
were of the calibre to yield good
marks and to keep the crowd of
12,000 pleased, two factors
prevented world class
performances many of the
athletes were capable of.
First, it is that time of the
track season when athletes are
rounding into top shape, but
mentally are idling.
Championships are coming up
next month and no veteran wants
to peak too early. And as the
athletes are functioning at high
levels of efficiency, coaches don't
want their stars overworked to the
point of being burned out.
As a result, the top two 440
men in college, Maxie Parks and
Benny Brown, and two of the best
west-coast sprinters, Sammy
Burns and Gordon Peppars,
shouldered half the load they
normally would. Two fine
distance runners, Gordon Innes
and Curtis Beck, did not run in
their specialties.
Secondly, both USC and
UCLA, covertly and overtly, held
something back in preparatory
maneuvering for their May 4
showdown meet in Los Angeles.
Neither team wanted to show the
other potential strengths and
weaknesses of their final lineups.
USC Sandbagging?
"1 can't understand it," said
UCLA coach Jim Bush with a
frown, "USC is a good team and
yet they competed so badly here.
They may have been sandbagging
— holding back something for us.
They did this last year; they ran a
bad meet to try and lull us asleep
and then came back hotter than a
firecracker against us.
"But as far as UCLA goes, I am
always pleased with this team. We
shifted several guys around — to
give somebody special speed work
here, strength work in another
case — and they came up with
their usual spirited performance."
One who was especially

spirited was Bruin sprinter Dotson
Wilson, the meet's only double
winner. Wilson took early leads in
both the 100 and 220 and held
off late charges from Card Marvin
Holmes to win both sprints.
"Dotson has had just a great
attitude," said Bush. "He is now
coming into his own."
"I attribute my success to
dedication and confidence,"
Wilson said, and added, with
typical Bruin foresightedness,
"and in two weeks | against USC]
I am going to win the 100, 220
and relay."
Distance Wins
Confidence also had something
to do with sparkling Card
performances in the distance
races. Stanford freshman Steve
Crowley was third in the
combined mile run at the 880
mark behind UCLA's Mark
Luevano who led the race at
2:02.9. Crowley then stayed in
the midst of the front-running
pack until he accelerated with 220
yards to go and sprinted away
from the field on the backstretch
for a 20 yard victory in a lifetime
best of 4:10.5.
Tony Sandoval also had a
lifetime best when he demolished
the field with a 120 yard 13:45.4
victory in the three-mile.
Following a 4:32 mile, Sandoval
took the lead en route to a
blistering 9:07.4 two-mile which
saw him open an 80 yard lead
over the field. Sandy coasted the
rest of the way and said after the
race, "All I can say is that it is a
nice day."
One of the meet's more
exciting finishes came in the 440
hurdles. UCLA's Tom Kight and
Lynnsey Guerrero held big leads
over Cards Matt Hogsett and Dave
Bagshaw at the 330 mark, but
coming down the backstretch
Hogsett made his patented late
surge. Guerrero held on for the
victory over Hogsett, but Bagshaw
outlunged Kight for third in one
of the most crowd-pleasing
finishes of the day.
"I feel good about the race
[52.2] even though I came in
second," said Hogsett. "Guerrero
and I are damn near the same
runner and we knew that the
finish would be a bloody, kicking,
screaming mess. It came down to
who would make the mistake and
I made it."
Other Events
In the 120 high hurdles
Bagshaw led a Stanford sweep in
14.6, as UCLA entered no
hurdlers to force better times.
Card jumper Mike Hall had the
unenviable task of challenging the
leading triple jumper in the
nation, Clarence Taylor. While
Taylor won in 52-2, Hall
improved on his lifetime best by
IV2 feet, soaring 49-ll l/ 4 for
second place.
Similarly, Ken Kring had to
challenge the nation's number
four long jumper, Jerry Herndon,
and although the latter won at
25-0, Kring came up with a
lifetime best of 23-6'/2, good for
third.
Cal provided more than its

of the most crowd-pleasing
finishes of the day.
"I feel good about the race
[52.2] even though I came in
second," said Hogsett. "Guerrero
and I are damn near the same
runner and we knew that the
finish would be a bloody, kicking,
screaming mess. It came down to
who would make the mistake and
I made it."
Other Events
In the 120 high hurdles
Bagshaw led a Stanford sweep in
14.6, as UCLA entered no
hurdlers to force better times.
Card jumper Mike Hall had the
unenviable task of challenging the
leading triple jumper in the
nation, Clarence Taylor. While
Taylor won in 52-2, Hall
improved on his lifetime best by
IV2 feet, soaring 49-ll l/ 4 for
second place.
Similarly, Ken Kring had to
challenge the nation's number
four long jumper, Jerry Herndon,
and although the latter won at
25-0, Kring came up with a
lifetime best of 23-6'/2, good for
third.
Cal provided more than its
share of excitement against USC.
Bear McKinley Mosley overcame
USC's brilliant trio of high
hurdlers to win in a Cal record
time of 13.8. Cal pulled off
another upset in the 440 relay,
using perfect passes to outsprint
the Trojan quartet, ranked second
in the country, 40.4 to 40.6.
Cal's Rick Brown and Trojan
James Baxter, two of the Pac-8's
top three 880 men, duelled for
770 yards before Brown sprinted
away for an eight yard victory.
"Baxter provides a little extra
pressure, but the important thing
I remember is that I don't want to
' lose," said Brown. "Running
, against USC is okay, but I prefer
the Stanford-Cal rivalry because
it's friendlier. But those two
1 teams | USC and UCLA ] are
incredible; one of them is going to
be the national champ."

YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING - UCLA's Steve Mott looks
incredulous while protesting a line call during his 7-5, 5-7, 7-5 loss to
Stanford's Jim Delaney Saturday. The bipartisan audience of 7200
cheered both players during the match in Maples Pavilion.
As expected, the top two track
powers in the country easily
brushed aside Northern opponents
in last Saturday's double-dual
track meet at Stanford Stadium.
USC won 93 i /2-51'/2 over an
inspired Cal contingent, while an
equally valiant Stanford squad
succumbed to a juggled UCLA
lineup 99-46.
And although performances
were of the calibre to yield good
marks and to keep the crowd of
12,000 pleased, two factors
prevented world class
performances many of the
athletes were capable of.
First, it is that time of the
track season when athletes are
rounding into top shape, but
mentally are idling.
Championships are coming up
next month and no veteran wants
to peak too early. And as the
athletes are functioning at high
levels of efficiency, coaches don't
want their stars overworked to the
point of being burned out.
As a result, the top two 440
men in college, Maxie Parks and
Benny Brown, and two of the best
west-coast sprinters, Sammy
Burns and Gordon Peppars,
shouldered half the load they
normally would. Two fine
distance runners, Gordon Innes
and Curtis Beck, did not run in
their specialties.
Secondly, both USC and
UCLA, covertly and overtly, held
something back in preparatory
maneuvering for their May 4
showdown meet in Los Angeles.
Neither team wanted to show the
other potential strengths and
weaknesses of their final lineups.
USC Sandbagging?
"1 can't understand it," said
UCLA coach Jim Bush with a
frown, "USC is a good team and
yet they competed so badly here.
They may have been sandbagging
— holding back something for us.
They did this last year; they ran a
bad meet to try and lull us asleep
and then came back hotter than a
firecracker against us.
"But as far as UCLA goes, I am
always pleased with this team. We
shifted several guys around — to
give somebody special speed work
here, strength work in another
case — and they came up with
their usual spirited performance."
One who was especially

spirited was Bruin sprinter Dotson
Wilson, the meet's only double
winner. Wilson took early leads in
both the 100 and 220 and held
off late charges from Card Marvin
Holmes to win both sprints.
"Dotson has had just a great
attitude," said Bush. "He is now
coming into his own."
"I attribute my success to
dedication and confidence,"
Wilson said, and added, with
typical Bruin foresightedness,
"and in two weeks | against USC]
I am going to win the 100, 220
and relay."
Distance Wins
Confidence also had something
to do with sparkling Card
performances in the distance
races. Stanford freshman Steve
Crowley was third in the
combined mile run at the 880
mark behind UCLA's Mark
Luevano who led the race at
2:02.9. Crowley then stayed in
the midst of the front-running
pack until he accelerated with 220
yards to go and sprinted away
from the field on the backstretch
for a 20 yard victory in a lifetime
best of 4:10.5.
Tony Sandoval also had a
lifetime best when he demolished
the field with a 120 yard 13:45.4
victory in the three-mile.
Following a 4:32 mile, Sandoval
took the lead en route to a
blistering 9:07.4 two-mile which
saw him open an 80 yard lead
over the field. Sandy coasted the
rest of the way and said after the
race, "All I can say is that it is a
nice day."
One of the meet's more
exciting finishes came in the 440
hurdles. UCLA's Tom Kight and
Lynnsey Guerrero held big leads
over Cards Matt Hogsett and Dave
Bagshaw at the 330 mark, but
coming down the backstretch
Hogsett made his patented late
surge. Guerrero held on for the
victory over Hogsett, but Bagshaw
outlunged Kight for third in one
of the most crowd-pleasing
finishes of the day.
"I feel good about the race
[52.2] even though I came in
