# Blacks Protest Police Tactics
## 
### 
Stanford's black track and field
athletes wore black arm bands at
Saturday's double dual track meet
as a form of protest against the
stop and search tactics of the San
Francisco police in their search
for the "Zebra" killer.
Triple jumper Derek Toliver,
who organized the protest, said
"The purpose was just to hold a
silent protest against the death of
the Fourth Amendment of the
Constitution, as it lis being
violated by the San Francisco
Police Department."
The majority of black athletes
from California, UCLA and USC
didn't wear the arm bands."Sammy
Burns, of Cal, was the only
[non-Stanford| athlete who wore
an arm band," said Toliver.
"I think the biggest effect of it
was on the television audience. We
wanted to show them that black
athletes at Stanford are human
beings with social consciousness,"
said Toliver.
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan was unaware of the
meaning of the incident until
yesterday morning. "I really
didn't know anything about it
until I read the paper. But it
doesn't make any difference, if
they wish to display their feelings
it's OK. It was no issue with me. I
honor a man's personal life
without asking any questions,"
said Jordan.
