# Cardinals Lose Two Of Three To Cal
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Whenever A 1 Arthur ventures
out to the mound for Stanford he
must be wondering how the
outcome will be: Will he pitch
badly and lose a 9-4 or will he
pitch well and iose 3-2?
Arthur's performance against
California Saturday in Sunken
Diamond was definitely
outstanding. However, the junior
righthander lost a bid for a
no-hitter and the game in the
ninth inning as the Bears won the
nightcap of a doubleheader 3-2.
In the opening game, Stanford
won by the same score on the
strength of Mark Lucich's two-run
homer, his seventh of the year.
Stanford lost 1-0 Friday in
Berkeley.
The snake-bitten Cards are now
3-6 in the Pacific Eight Southern
Division, good enough only for
the cellar. Cal climbed out of the
last place tie with Stanford to tie
UCLA for second with a 4-5

mark. USC swept three games
from the Bruins to lead the league
with a 7-2 record.
"We're not making things
happen," said Stanford head
coach Ray Young.
"The pitching all weekend was
good. But we missed far too many
chances to score when we had
men on base."
Cal 3, Stanford 2
Until the ninth inning Arthur
was masterful in allowing but two
base runners, on a walk and his
own throwing error. He retired 13
straight batters through one
stretch and 22 of 24 in eight
innings.
"Al was wearing that outside
corner [of the plate] out." said
pitching coach Tom Dunton.
"You can't pitch much better
than what Al did today. It's tough
to pitch like that and not win."
Arthur's record is now 2-6 for the
year. Three of those losses have
been by just one run: 2-1, 2-1 and
3-2.
Trailing 2-1, Cal's last gasp
rally was totally unexpected.
Pinch hitter Hank Sauer ripped a
lead-off double down the left field
line for the Bears' first hit off
Arthur. The Bears loaded the
bases on a bunt single by Bobby
Tulk and an error by Steve Davis
on a "sure doubleplay" grounder.
Two sacrifice flies sent home the
tying and winning runs.
In Stanford's last time up Cal
ace Gene Litle, walked Kim
Hannaford, then freshman Fred
Bernhardt laced a wicked line
drive down the right field line that
was caught by a diving Bill Piona.
"That was a great catch," said
Young, "it was the turning
point." Cal's coach, former major

leaguer Jackie Jensen, called the
catch "the play of the series."
That was the difference in the
game, and instead of a one- or
two-hit win, Arthur had lost
again.
Stanford 3, Cal 2
Despite a shaky start and
ending Mike Williamson managed
to pitch well in picking up his
third win of the year against three
losses.
Bernie Hittner's last out relief
was almost fatal as the sophomore
threw eight straight balls to walk
in one run before getting Cal's
Neil Cummings to ground into a
run-down force out to end the
game.
A two-run homer over the
left-centerfield fence by Mark
Lucich with Joe Lamoure aboard
in the first inning and a double by
Bruce Robinson in the third again
scoring Lamoure were all the runs
Stanford needed.
Cal 1, Stanford 0
Again, a Card pitched well
enough to win but did not get
enough support. Dave Frost
scattered 10 Bear hits in allowing
just one run but was beaten by
Cal's John Hughes.
Cal scored the lone run of the
game on a single by Steve
Bartkowski and a triple by Brad
Brian in the third inning.
Stanford's strongest threat,
loading the bases in the second
inning with one out, was snuffed
out when Lucich took three called
strikes and Ray Anderson struck
out.
The Cards (14-21) play host to
Cal in a non-conference game
tomorrow at Sunken Diamond at
2:30 p.m.
