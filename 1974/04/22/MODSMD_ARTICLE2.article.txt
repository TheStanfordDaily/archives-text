# Government Intervention And Energy Crisis
## Buckley Blames 'Control Mentality' 
### GLENN KRAMON 
New York Sen. James Buckley
Friday night blamed "governmental
intervention into the workings of a
free competitive marketplace" for the
"•state of non-preparedness" with
which the United States has
confronted the energy shortage.
"I have found refreshing .. . that
the American public has learned that
there are limits to what Washington
can do for people, [and that j there are
unlimited hazards as to what happens
when Washington intervenes in trying
to help," the Conservative-Republican
told an overflow crowd in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium in a prepared
"Conservative Look at the Energy
Crisis."
"Unfortunately, that which is
obvious to constituents ceases to be
obvious to people who have been in
office too long," Buckley said. He
observed a "cultural lag" between

constituents and congressmen "that
approximates an average incumbency"
of between 10 and 15 years.
Alioto Present
San Francisco Mayor Joseph
Alioto, whose presence was marked
outside the auditorium by 90 black
students opposing his orders to
stop all black males fitting the
description of the "Zebra" killer,
commented on Buckley's speech.
Nobel Laureate Joshua Lederberg
and John McCarthy, director of the
Artificial Intelligence Project, both
professors here, also participated in
the forum.
Buckley, who has studied the
current energy shortage for the past 14
months and serves on the Senate
Committee on the Interior, attacked
Congress' "control mentality" which
has resulted in extension of the

Federal Power Commission's authority
over the pricing of natural gas.
Price Controls
Complaining that such price
controls would "clamp a lid on what
could be charged by people who had
gone out and risked their money to
find a raw material to sell on the
interstate market," Buckley pointed to
a considerable decline in the discovery
rate of natural gas reserves since the
controls were implemented in 1958.
"If the managers of the roulette
table will not allow a return | profit J
above a certain level, individuals will
decide it's not worth their while" to
invest in exploration for now sources
of natural gas, Buckley said.
And at the same time, he added,
consumers rapidly converted from coal
and oil to natural gas to benefit from
its stable price, thus "accelerating the

depletion of one of our most valuable
resources."
Oil Import Quota
Buckley also criticized the oil
import quota system which limits the
flow of foreign oil into the U.S.
When "refinery capacity in the
United States was limited to what
domestic fields could produce plus
that oil that could be imported," there
became a "disincentive to build more
refineries," he said.
He opposed "all kinds of legislation
with the prefix 'emergency' [which
was] enacted to spread misery as
equitably as possible. In trying to
spread the misery, we increased that
misery."
He specifically criticized the
Emergency Energy Allocation Bill,
which "riveted the Federal Energy
Office to a situation as it existed in
1972. Everyone was to be supplied
with x percent of that demand in that
period," despite the "tremendous
fluidity" in this country.
'Enormous Wastage'
Buckley also cited the "enormous
amount of wastage" resulting from the
distribution of oil of equal amounts to
each refinery, no matter how
inefficient or efficient, in order that
each run at 75 percent ofjts capacity.
Mayor Alioto, who arrived late
from a gubernatorial campaign tour in
the Santa Cruz mountains, implored
executives of oi! companies to sit
down with Arab sheiks in a cartel
arrangement to plan production and
prices.
He said he could not see "much
difference between central planning by
a state and central planning by a
cartel."
Rival Fuels
Alioto called for the judgment of
rival fuels — geothermal steam, coal,
oil, and gas — on "their competitive
merits" rather than on their
profitability.
He said in an interview afterward
that only by enforcing the present
"dead lettuce" antitrust laws will large
conglomerates which control all
energy resources be broken into
competitive companies.
He said he believed California could
become one of the first states
independent of foreign oil, but
rejected the reopening of oil drilling in

the Santa Barbara channel as a means
toward that self-sufficiency.
More Research
Lederberg, 1958 Nobel
prize-winner for his work in the
genetics of bacteria and current
chairman of the Genetics Department,
criticized the Nixon administration for
thinking "there are too many brains
around." In a short comment, he
called for more support of research on

the energy shortage.
McCarthy, a computer science
professor, disagreed with Buckley in
noting that he found future use of
nuclear reactors "acceptably safe,
though not perfectly safe."
He compared the danger of nuclear
reactors to that of automobile
accidents. Cars are considered
acceptable even though 50,000 people
die in them annually, he said.
