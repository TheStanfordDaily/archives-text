# Crew Teams Defeat SCU
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity, junior
varsity and freshman crew teams
swept to victory Saturday
morning over Santa Clara at
Redwood Shores.
The varsity scored a narrow
triumph, winning by one or two
seats, with a time of 6:14
compared to Santa Clara's 6:14.2.
The varsity competed without
captain Dave Orchard, who was
injured. Thus, one oarsman had to
participate in both the JV and
varsity events, which obviously
hampered the varsity's
performance.
In the freshman fours which
kicked off the meet, Stanford
won one race from Santa Clara
and Redwood High School, but
lost a second race to the latter
foe.
This weekend, the crew teams
travel to Los Angeles. Friday,
they race UCLA and USC, with
Loyola, Occidental and San Diego
State the Saturday opponents.

UP IN THE AIR — Triple jumper Derek Toliver met with tough competition in Saturday's double dual
meet against UCLA. Toliver finished fourth in the event with a 47-6. He also organized the protest of the
black athletes against the San Francisco police's stop and search tactics.
