# Golfers Edge Spartans

### 
Dave Baskins curled in a clutch
birdie putt on the final green
Saturday to lift Stanford past San
Jose State, 15-12, in a dual match
on the Stanford course.
Baskins, who was tied with San
Jose's Mark Lye after 17 holes, hit
a driver and a five iron within six
feet of the flagstick on the 18th.
He calmly stroked in the putt to
edge Lye by one shot (71-72) and
provide the winning team margin.
"Dave's points were the
difference." said relieved coach
Bud P'inger after the victory. "If
Lye wins the match that's a swing
of two points for each team,
which would give them a 14-13
win."
San Jose's Eric Batten coasted

past Aly Trompas in the second
match, firing a 74 while Trompas
struggled to an 83.
Brent Murray and George
Pettinger each fired 73's in
victories over Don Thames and
Paul Halin, while Conrad Nilmeier
edged Terry Beardsley, 77-79, and
Glenn Goethels defeated Dave
Larson, 74-77.
The match remained close,
however, since the Spartans
accumulated valuable points in
the simultaneous best-ball
competition.
The Cards, now 6-1 for the
season, host the 31-team U.S.
Collegiate Invitational Thursday
through Saturday on the Stanford
course.
