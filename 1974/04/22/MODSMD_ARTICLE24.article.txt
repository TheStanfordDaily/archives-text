# Competitive Netters Crush USC, UCLA
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
When it was all over, many in
the record crowd which watched
Stanford's tennis team
mechanically demolish USC 9-0
and UCLA 7-2 could only mutter
"Is Stanford really that good?".
Maybe so. The Cardinals may
not have played especially well,
according to coach, promoter,
organizer and microphone stringer
Dick Gould, but they competed
well, winning all seven matches
which went the distance of three
sets.
In all, an estimated 14,900
people watched the marathon
triumphs, played both outdoors at
the Varsity 'Courts and inside
Maples Pavilion. Most of those
spectators, of course, were present
at the indoor matches, otherwise
known as the Jim and Sandy
show.
Both nights, Delaney's matches
kicked off the program, followed
by the featured Mayer match and
finally the pair's doubles exploits.
In all, the twosome won five of
six matches, losing only the final
doubles event, a poorly-played
affair, to Brian Teacher-Steve
Mott, 6-4, 6-4.
Earlier Saturday night,
Delanev, a doubtful entry due to
back injury, broke open a five-all
third set with eight straight points
to beat Steve Mott, 7-5, 5-7, 7-5.
The Stanford band, on hand
for the evening matches, loudly
questioned Mott's masculinity,

but the USC sophomore earned
the respect of the crowd of 7200
with fine returns of Delaney's
zinging overheads and perfect
lobs.
The previous night, Delaney
fought off three match-points en
route to a 3-6, 7-6, 7-5 triumph
over SC's Sashi Menon. Delaney,
down 5-2 in the third set, got the
previously quiet Maples crowd
going with the win.
Both nights, with the crowd
buzzing after Delaney's matches,
Mayer took the floor, started
poorly and proceeded to demolish
his opponent. Mayer's play Friday
night was particularly brilliant, his
perfect ground strokes
overwhelming John Andrews, 6-4,
6-2. His brilliance carried over
into the doubles, which he and
Delaney won over
Andrews-Menon, 7-6, 6-4.
Saturday, Mayer didn't look
quite as good, but he completely
unnerved UCLA's Brian Teacher
late in the first set and won 11 of
the final 13 games in a 7-5, 6-2
triumph.
As exciting as the indoor
matches were, they had absolutely
no bearing on the ultimate result
of the matches, both of which
were sewed up during
down-the-line triumphs in the
afternoons. Friday, Stanford ran
off victories the way an expert
shoots clay pigeons.
John Whitlinger, who played
superbly at the third slot all

weekend, downed John Holladay, u
7-5, 6-2, while Pat DuPre, still '
fighting inconsistency, topped
Mike Wayman, 7-5, 5-7, 6*l, at
fourth singles. At fifth singles,
Nick Saviano, playing against
Butch Walts, a frequent foe in
Northern California junior and
men's competition, alternated
brilliant play with muffed shots
and won the grudge match, 3-6,
6-4,7-6.
At the final position, Mark
Mitchell, probably the favorite of
the ballboys and girls present,
won a friendly match with Hans
(Juildemeister, 7-5, 6-2.
Saturday afternoon, the singles
matches went even more
smoothly, as only Saviano was
forced into a third set, where he
quickly dispatched Spencer
Segura to win 4-6, 6-3, 6-1.
Whitlinger and Mitchell, the
two most improved players on the
team, continued their pattern of
easy wins by similar scores, Whit
stopping Ferdi Taygan 6-1, 6-3.
and Mitch reversing that order
against Dave Parker. DuPre beat
Tom Kreiss, 7-6, 6-0.
Stanford's first loss of the
weekend came when
Taygan- Kreiss beat
Whitlinger-DuPre 7-5, 7-6. Kreiss
played as hard as his brother Bob
did last year, when he led UCLA
to the Pacific Eight crown.
