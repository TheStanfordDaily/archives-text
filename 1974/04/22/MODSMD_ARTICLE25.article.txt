# Shuffling The Cards
## Quiet Carnival 
### Dave Robinson 
It was the first time a Stanford audience had ever duplicated the
neck-straining behavior of Pauley Pavilion basketball fans.
After endless vain efforts to match the fast-breaking Bruin cagers,
Stanford decided to change sports. And the result was 25,400 eyes
flip-flopping constantly to catch each point of the Cards'spectacular
indoor tennis matches this weekend against USC and UCLA.
"Yes, it was a spectacle," said Dick Could, a promotional genius
who also happens to coach the defending NCAA champion tennis
team. "It was really a thrill to see so many people enjoying the
matches."
Last fall, Could envisioned the crowd-drawing potential of an
indoor tennis carnival, and discussed the idea just before Christmas
with Athletic Director .Joe Ruetz. "I felt it would sell and Joe thought
it was a good idea," Could recalls, "so we began looking for a
surface."
Stanford purchased a slightly used $8000 Sport Face carpet,
literally laying the groundwork for the matches and signalling a
definite go-ahead.
"The immediate response was phenomenal," Could said. Ticket
sales started fast, eventually reaching 5500 Friday night and 7200
Saturday, in addition to the estimated 2200 fans who viewed the
outdoor matches.
Sophisticated Crowd
It was a different type of crowd, hardly resembling the basketball
fans who scream occasionally at Stanford games and not the least bit
like the maniacal throngs who frequent basketball games and slugfests
at Oregon's McArthur Court.
"The crowd was extremely sophisticated," said Gould, who himself
remained stoic throughout each night's ordeal.
In fact at times it was difficult to determine who the fans were
rooting for. The awe-struck crowd expressed genuine appreciation
after phenomenal shots by all participants, even the hated Irojans.
Deft volleys and cut shots by USC's Sashi Menon and aggressive
service returns by UCLA's Steve Mott prompted cheers surpassed only
by the reaction to Sandy Mayer's awesome domination of his foes.
The players were equally pleased by the production. All expressed
satisfaction with the surface, which was unanimously judged slow but
true. Mayer candidly proclaimed the crowd "tame, much different
than Los Angeles, where it's "like a zoo. They can be really vicious
with their remarks.
"There was one guy who would sound off with a bugle from his
dorm window when we were serving," Mayer told Palo Alto Times
sports editor Dave Wik. "It made me mad enough that I didn't feel
like playing. I couldn't give it my best with jerks like that hounding
me."
Artistic Effort
Stanford's non-partisan crowd elicited no such complaints, and the
only instance of competitive anger occurred when Mott stared
incredulously at a linesman after a call he simply couldn't believe.
Basically, though, it was more of an artistic performance than a
sweaty sporting event. Fans constantly marveled at the expertise of
the players, and often expressed a yearning to leave immediately to
polish their own backhands.
Even Rich Kelley, whose Maples Pavilion exploits are normally
confined to the basketball court, was so inspired by the one-on-one
competition that he confided he'd love to quit basketball and play
tennis for two years, "just to see how good I could be."
In high school, Kelley was very good. In fact he was an outstanding
high school player, and teamed with John Hursh to win several
impressive doubles titles.
"Just think," Kelley said. "The people would still come up to me
on the streets and gawk, 'How tall are you? You must play
basketball.' "
And Kelley could look casually downward and smile, "No, I play
tennis."

Stanford purchased a slightly used $8000 Sport Face carpet,
literally laying the groundwork for the matches and signalling a
definite go-ahead.
"The immediate response was phenomenal," Could said. Ticket
sales started fast, eventually reaching 5500 Friday night and 7200
Saturday, in addition to the estimated 2200 fans who viewed the
outdoor matches.
Sophisticated Crowd
It was a different type of crowd, hardly resembling the basketball
fans who scream occasionally at Stanford games and not the least bit
like the maniacal throngs who frequent basketball games and slugfests
at Oregon's McArthur Court.
"The crowd was extremely sophisticated," said Gould, who himself
remained stoic throughout each night's ordeal.
In fact at times it was difficult to determine who the fans were
rooting for. The awe-struck crowd expressed genuine appreciation
after phenomenal shots by all participants, even the hated Irojans.
Deft volleys and cut shots by USC's Sashi Menon and aggressive
service returns by UCLA's Steve Mott prompted cheers surpassed only
by the reaction to Sandy Mayer's awesome domination of his foes.
The players were equally pleased by the production. All expressed
satisfaction with the surface, which was unanimously judged slow but
true. Mayer candidly proclaimed the crowd "tame, much different
than Los Angeles, where it's "like a zoo. They can be really vicious
with their remarks.
"There was one guy who would sound off with a bugle from his
dorm window when we were serving," Mayer told Palo Alto Times
sports editor Dave Wik. "It made me mad enough that I didn't feel
like playing. I couldn't give it my best with jerks like that hounding
me."
Artistic Effort
Stanford's non-partisan crowd elicited no such complaints, and the
only instance of competitive anger occurred when Mott stared
incredulously at a linesman after a call he simply couldn't believe.
Basically, though, it was more of an artistic performance than a
sweaty sporting event. Fans constantly marveled at the expertise of
the players, and often expressed a yearning to leave immediately to
polish their own backhands.
Even Rich Kelley, whose Maples Pavilion exploits are normally
confined to the basketball court, was so inspired by the one-on-one
competition that he confided he'd love to quit basketball and play
tennis for two years, "just to see how good I could be."
In high school, Kelley was very good. In fact he was an outstanding
high school player, and teamed with John Hursh to win several
impressive doubles titles.
"Just think," Kelley said. "The people would still come up to me
on the streets and gawk, 'How tall are you? You must play
basketball.' "
And Kelley could look casually downward and smile, "No, I play
tennis."
It was the first time a Stanford audience had ever duplicated the
neck-straining behavior of Pauley Pavilion basketball fans.
After endless vain efforts to match the fast-breaking Bruin cagers,
Stanford decided to change sports. And the result was 25,400 eyes
flip-flopping constantly to catch each point of the Cards'spectacular
indoor tennis matches this weekend against USC and UCLA.
"Yes, it was a spectacle," said Dick Could, a promotional genius
who also happens to coach the defending NCAA champion tennis
team. "It was really a thrill to see so many people enjoying the
matches."
Last fall, Could envisioned the crowd-drawing potential of an
indoor tennis carnival, and discussed the idea just before Christmas
with Athletic Director .Joe Ruetz. "I felt it would sell and Joe thought
it was a good idea," Could recalls, "so we began looking for a
surface."
