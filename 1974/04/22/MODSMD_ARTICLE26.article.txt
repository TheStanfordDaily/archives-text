IRS Denies Obstruction Of Probe
WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service denied
reports yesterday that it had obstructed a Senate probe of a
$100,000 campaign contribution by Howard Hughes.
The denial came in response to reports from sources that
the Senate Watergate committee's investigation of the
contribution is focusing as much on the IRS as on the
money itself.
Committee investigators have uncovered what they
consider to be questionable procedures in the IRS's own
probe of the billionaire's contribution. The money was
given to President Nixon's close friend Charles G. "Bebe"
Rebozo in two installments in 1969 and 1970.
In a statement issued yesterday, the IRS said it is not
IRS practice to discuss publicly any pending investigation
or whether it is engaged in an investigation. The statement
said:
'The IRS flatly denies that it has engagad in any
cover-up regarding the committee's investigation and asserts
that it has been cooperating with the committee staff to the
fullest extent consistent with the disclosure limitations in
the tax laws.
The questions were raised in a nine-page memo sent by
the committee's assistant chief counsel Terry Lenzner on
April 15 to committee members. The Associated Press has
obtained access to the memo.
Lenzner's memo also complained that the IRS had put
"frustrating and debilitating roadblocks" into the
committee's investigation of the contribution, by refusing
to turn over material uncovered in IRS' own probe.
FBI Infiltrates SLA Neighborhood
NEW YORK — FBI agents in such guises as postmen and
trash collectors have reportedly infiltrated the
neighborhood in which the Symbionese Liberation Army is
hiding out — but still have not located the terrorist band,
according to Newsweek.
The magazine reported yesterday that it had learned the
FBI had been unable to penetrate the SLA, which claims to
have kidnaped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, or to
develop informers within its midstf But it was understood,
Newsweek said, that agents posing as deliverymen and the
like had fanned out through the SLA's neighborhood and
relayed "valuable new leads" to authorities supervising the
case.
Meanwhile, police have refused to comment on a report
by a roommate of one of Patricia Hearst's cousins that he
was kidnaped by three blacks who thought he was William
R. Hearst 11.
Soviet Crowd Hostile To Kennedy
MOSCOW — Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., was met
with silence, laughter and open hostility at Moscow State
University yesterday, then was hustled out of the
auditorium on the pretext he wasn't feeling well.
Kennedy had asked the audience of Soviet university
students and other spectators whether they thought Soviet
military spending should be increased or decreased. His
question was greeted first with silence, then with an
explosion of laughter.
There is no public discussion in the Soviet Union of
defense expenditures, and it apparently struck the audience
as bizarre and funny that Kennedy would ask their opinion.

An elderly man in the audience angrily shook his fist at
Kennedy and shouted, "That question is a provocation."
The man then stood up and told the Massachusetts
Democrat: "We spend as much on defense as our country
requires."
Kennedy, who often asks questions of his American
student audiences, then asked the audience to vote by
raised hands on which Soviet achievements they considered
most important.
Obviously confused, the audience failed to respond.
After conferring with officials of the dais, an interpreter
came over to the podium and announced that the senator
had to leave because he was not feeling well. "I feel fine,"
Kennedy reported.
Lopez Elected In Colombia
BOGOTA, Colombia — Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, the
left-of-center Liberal party candidate, was elected president
of Colombia Sunday.
His closest rival, Alvaro Gomez Hurtado of the
Conservative party, conceded defeat on the basis of returns
that gave Lopez a commanding and ever-widening lead.
Israeli-Syrian Fighting Continues
An Israeli force stabbed into Lebanese territory and
occupied a hilltop on the south-western slopes of Mt.
Hermon yesterday, according to Lebanese sources, as
fighting between Israel and Syria continued for control of
the strategic peak.
Neither the Israeli nor Lebanese governments
immediately commented on the reports from witnesses in
southern Lebanon.
The witnesses said Lebanese troops lobbed several
rounds of mortar shells on the Israeli force that occupied
Shahar hilltop inside Lebanon early yesterday. They said
the Israelis were still on the hilltop at dusk. There was no
indication of the size of the force.
Cambodian Troops Routed
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Rebel troops routed
government forces from their beachhead north of Phnom
Penh yesterday after a savage 24-hour attack, the
Cambodian command reported.
Casualties among the estimated 1500-man garrison were
not known but were feared to be heavy.
Some of the troops managed to fight their way V/ 2 miles
to the north and link up with government troops isolated at
Longvek, the command said.
A Western military observer said the withdrawal from
the beachhead represented a major defeat for the
govern ment.
