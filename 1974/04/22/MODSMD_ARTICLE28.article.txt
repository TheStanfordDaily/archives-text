# Liquor License Question Delays Pub Progress
## 
### 
The University has already fallen
behind in its schedule to open an
on-campus pub serving beer and wine,
according to University officials.
The University has still not decided
who will apply for the pub's liquor
license, Tresidder Union Manager
Gordon Starr told the Daily.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Dan
Williams said the University must
decide whether it or Guckenheimer,
the holding company for Tout de
Suite, Inc. (TDS), should hold the
pub's license. TDS runs the Tresidder
food service and would manage the
pub.
According to Starr, the University
has delayed to do more research.
However, both he and Williams
declined to specify the nature of that
research for the Daily.
The decision on who will apply for
the license will be reached sometime

this week, Williams said, adding thai
this delay should not alter the pub's
scheduled Sept. 15 opening date.
President Richard Lyman must
approve the decision, Starr said.
Either the University or
Guckenheimer will apply for an "on
sale, beer and wine license," allowing
the pub to sell beer and wine to
persons 21 years of age and older,
according to Guckenheimer President
Dr. Stewart Ritchie.
Ritchie said that if the University
decides to let his company apply for
the license, Guckenheimer will need
five working days before it can submit
the application to the Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC).
Once the application is submitted
to the ABC, a 45-day waiting period
follows. During this period, a "notice
of intent" to sell beer and wine must
be posted for 30 days.
