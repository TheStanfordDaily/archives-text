# Blacks Protest Alioto Order
## 
### 
About 100 black students awaited
San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto's
arrival for an appearance here Friday
night, distributing leaflets protesting as
"illegal police tactics" Alioto's order
to stop and question all black males
fitting the description of the "Zebra"
killer.
The black students, some of them
law students here, cited the order as a
violation of the Fourth Amendment,
which forbids unreasonable search and
seizure.
After issuing a handout to Alioto,
the blacks remained outside
Dinkelspiel Auditorium to listen to a
press statement, and then dispersed.
The handout which Alioto received
accused him of "racist and political
opportunism" for his initiation of
"illegal and repressive programs to
court the white vote at the expense of
the black community" in his campaign
for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination.
"Literally thousands of black males
in San Francisco are being stopped and
subjected to the gross indignities and
inconveniences of illegal body searches
and warrant checks," the statement
read.
U.S. District Court Judge Alfonso
Zirpoli will determine at a hearing
beginning Wednesday whether cause
exists to halt the tactic employed to
catch the killer(s) of 12 persons in San
Francisco.
Alioto defended the order,
declaring that "as one who has always
believed in constitutional rights, I
believe we are fully within our
constitutional rights in stopping those
who resemble the' Zebra' killer."
Praising the 150 officers involved in
the search as "professionals" who will
stay within constitutional bounds,
Alioto insisted that policemen "will
simply ask them (black males who fit
the description] to identify
themselves. We do not go through
their pockets to search them."
He added that "every black
policeman we can muster is being used
in this operation."
"We are proceeding no differently
in the matter of the "Zebra"killer than
we did with the Zodiac killer," Alioto
said. "With the Zodiac killer, we
stopped Caucasians with blonde
hair. . . and nobody objected. ... We
stopped more than a thousand white
men."
