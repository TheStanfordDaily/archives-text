# Franklin Criticizes University
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
H. Bruce Franklin, fired Stanford English professor, told
students here last night that the University has always tried
to rid itself of dissident faculty members.
Speaking to 50 students in the Lagunita Lounge,
Franklin noted that his 1972 dismissal from Stanford for
allegedly inciting students to violence is only the latest in a
long series of repressive measures taken against faculty
members who have criticized the University's relation to
business interests.
Franklin concluded that it is difficult for a student to
obtain an enlightened education at Stanford because of
what he called the University's refusal to allow professors
with anti-capitalist views to serve on the faculty.
Franklin, an avowed Maoist, noted that most students
are kept in ignorance of Marxist thought, which he called
the most formative intellectual influence in the world
today.
'Limited Education'
"A student receives only a very limited kind of
education at Stanford," Franklin stated. "It is more
appropriate to the middle of the nineteenth century than to
the latter part of the twentieth century."
The University itself was built with the funds of railroad
baron Leland Stanford, Franklin noted. The tradition of
close alliance with the business community has always
characterized education at Stanford, he said.
Franklin pointed out that in 1900 Mrs. Stanford forced
Prof. Edward Ross to resign when he mildly criticized the
business ethos of the Founder.
Thorsten Veblen, the famed economist, was forced from
Stanford in 1909 for personal indiscretions, Franklin
reminded students.

And Franklin said that in the 19605, the University was
irritated by the presence of Marxist economist Paul Baran,
but could find no legal way to force his dismissal.
Corporate Connections
Several University trustees presently serve on the boards
of major corporations, Franklin stated. The University is
intimately connected to the military establishment and is
the center of a "Pacific empire" of business and military
interests. Franklin charged.
Franklin noted that the Stanford Research Institute has
developed means of electronic warfare that were used in the
Indochina War. He called the Hoover Institute "one of the
world's main centers of anti-Communist propaganda."
As a result, Stanford educates technicians who advance
the methods of warfare, businessmen who lead world
capitalism and social scientists who attempt to rationalize
the status quo, Franklin declared.
Tool Of Government
Franklin said that the fact that Stanford is private
doesn't shield it from governmental interference. Since the
government is controlled by business interests, the
University's business connections make it a tool of the
government, he insisted.
Franklin said that he is confident of receiving an
appointment at the University of Colorado, but he noted
that someday he hopes to return to Stanford, since he
believes he is needed here to increase students' political
awareness.
Franklin added that he doubted that the University
administration objected to his presence on campus last
night. "They feel as if they have the place well enough
pacified by now," he said.

the center of a "Pacific empire" of business and military
interests. Franklin charged.
Franklin noted that the Stanford Research Institute has
developed means of electronic warfare that were used in the
Indochina War. He called the Hoover Institute "one of the
world's main centers of anti-Communist propaganda."
As a result, Stanford educates technicians who advance
the methods of warfare, businessmen who lead world
capitalism and social scientists who attempt to rationalize
the status quo, Franklin declared.
Tool Of Government
Franklin said that the fact that Stanford is private
doesn't shield it from governmental interference. Since the
government is controlled by business interests, the
University's business connections make it a tool of the
government, he insisted.
Franklin said that he is confident of receiving an
appointment at the University of Colorado, but he noted
that someday he hopes to return to Stanford, since he
believes he is needed here to increase students' political
awareness.
Franklin added that he doubted that the University
administration objected to his presence on campus last
night. "They feel as if they have the place well enough
pacified by now," he said.

CONSERVATIVE COMMENT -Sen. James Buckley (R-N.Y.)answers questions
before Friday night's panel at Dinkelspiel. Buckley blamed current energy
problems on government interference in the private sector.
H. Bruce Franklin, fired Stanford English professor, told
students here last night that the University has always tried
to rid itself of dissident faculty members.
Speaking to 50 students in the Lagunita Lounge,
Franklin noted that his 1972 dismissal from Stanford for
allegedly inciting students to violence is only the latest in a
long series of repressive measures taken against faculty
members who have criticized the University's relation to
business interests.
Franklin concluded that it is difficult for a student to
obtain an enlightened education at Stanford because of
what he called the University's refusal to allow professors
with anti-capitalist views to serve on the faculty.
Franklin, an avowed Maoist, noted that most students
are kept in ignorance of Marxist thought, which he called
the most formative intellectual influence in the world
today.
'Limited Education'
"A student receives only a very limited kind of
education at Stanford," Franklin stated. "It is more
appropriate to the middle of the nineteenth century than to
the latter part of the twentieth century."
The University itself was built with the funds of railroad
baron Leland Stanford, Franklin noted. The tradition of
close alliance with the business community has always
characterized education at Stanford, he said.
Franklin pointed out that in 1900 Mrs. Stanford forced
Prof. Edward Ross to resign when he mildly criticized the
business ethos of the Founder.
Thorsten Veblen, the famed economist, was forced from
Stanford in 1909 for personal indiscretions, Franklin
reminded students.

And Franklin said that in the 19605, the University was
irritated by the presence of Marxist economist Paul Baran,
but could find no legal way to force his dismissal.
Corporate Connections
Several University trustees presently serve on the boards
of major corporations, Franklin stated. The University is
intimately connected to the military establishment and is
the center of a "Pacific empire" of business and military
interests. Franklin charged.
