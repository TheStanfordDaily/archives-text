# University Tax Exempt Status Threatens PIRG Assessment
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
The future of the Public Interest
Research Group (PIRG) fee assessment
passed last week, will remain uncertain
until University officials decide
whether the funds will directly benefit
students.
PIRG's function may conflict with
charitable tax iawsand with University
policies on monies which give it
tax-exempt status.
If the University decides a conflict
exists, it will either impose restrictions
on the use of the money voted to
PIRG or not collect the money at all.
Stanford is one of approximately
six Bay Area Universities with local
chapters of Nor-Cal PIRG, an
organization that hires lawyers and
technical experts to help students
doing research projects in areas such as
consumer advocacy, environmental
protection and sexual and racial
discrimination.

Dale Snape, assistant dean of
student affairs, said he is concerned
that PIRG should offer "specific and
direct benefits to our students in a
manner they determine, not what is
determined by the board of a larger
organization."
Stanford PIRG's organizers Jack
Handy and Mark Weitzel said they will
propose in a meeting tomorrow
with Snape and University legal
counsel James Siena that 80 to 90
percent of the fee assessment be given
to Nor-Cal PIRG headquarters, the
remainder going to office costs and
small projects here.
Only by donating money to
Nor-Cal PIRG can the Stanford
chapter avoid duplicating the
campus-oriented projects of SWOPSI
and SCIRE, Handy said. He stressed
that supervision by professional
advisers makes PIRG different from
other organizations.
Advisers
Nor-Cal PIRG's board of directors
hires these advisers and allows the
local chapters to use their services for
either local projects or regional
projects, Handy said.
He explained that next fall,

students here will elect a majority of
the local board members, two of
whom will serve on the regional board.
Weitzel claimed that students will
benefit directly from the educational
value of PIRG by working with
advisers on research projects.
Theory-Practice Link
"PIRG carries educational means a
step further than other organizations
by linking theory and practice,"
Weitzel said. "We don't just do
research. We're activists. We'll try to
create change by lobbying and
litigation."
Weitzel said that PIRG could also
benefit students in developing
increased citizen responsibility and
getting them involved with the
community.
Snape, however, said even though
PIRG may benefit "students as good
citizens," he has seen no evidence it
will benefit "students as students."
Snape said the University should
encourage students to become
"voluntarily" involved with programs
working to better society, but it
shouldn't coerce students to
contribute to them.

BLASTS STANFORD - Fired English professor H. Bruce Franklin declared last
night that Stanford is a tool of capitalism. He outlined the history of what he
called the University's repression of anti-capitalist opinion.
