All student positions on
University committees are now
open. The ASSU Nominations
Committee, composed of six
students appointed by the ASSU
Senate and one member of the
Council of Presidents, will be
accepting applications until
Wednesday, April 24 (Yes, the
deadline has been extended!).
These University committees
deal with a variety of areas and
are composed of faculty, staff,
and student members. Some of
the most popular committees are
Admissions and Financial Aid,
Foreign Studies, Undergraduate
Studies and the Committee on the
Education and Employment of
Women.
Others include Cable
Television, Land and Buildings,
Finance and Development,
Advising, SWOPSI, a Faculty
Senate seat, etc. There is sure to
be one of the over 40 committees
that appeals to your individual
taste.
The experience of serving on a
University committee can give
you the opportunity to learn how
to function effectively outside the
classroom â€” to articulate your
ideas carefully and persuasively,
and to develop and use the
political techniques required to
accomplish goals you consider
important.
Direct Contact
How often can you have such
direct contact with faculty and

administrators and particularly in
a non-academic context?
At the same time, by your
creativity and hard work on the
committee, you will be able to
have an important effect on
University decision-making.
Last spring, the ASSU
Nominations Committee received
over 550 applications. This
allowed us to be highly selective;
so much so that many highly
qualified students did not receive
positions. We hope that we will
have such a wide range of choice
this year in order that we can
nominate truly competent
students.
Applications Encouraged
The Nominations Committee
wishes to encourage applications
from students who have not in the
past taken an overly active part in
the committee system; this
includes both individuals and
groups, i.e. women, minorities and
graduate students. This varied
student representation is
important if the committees are
to reflect a variety of student
interests and expertise.
Applications are now available
in the ASSU office, second floor
of Tresidder Union. If you want
to find out more about the
committees, there is more
information in the ASSU office.
Your participation is vital.

vice-president.)
