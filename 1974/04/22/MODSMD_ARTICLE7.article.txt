Positive Feedback
Editor:
Your front page article by Bob
Lowe (Daily, April 10) entitled
"SWOPSI Class Means Giving,"
was rewarding for the PCC staff to
read.
The enthusiasm expressed by
Lowe's student interviewees about
their work as volunteers at PCC
was very positive, and it is
gratifying for those of us who
teach the SWOPSI 120 Course,
and for the PCC staff, to receive
such feedback about its meaning
to students.
The additional critical elements
not covered in the
above-mentioned article are those
that make possible such important
experiences for Stanford students
â€” namely, an independently
funded program and a staff which
voluntarily devotes time to
teaching and supervision of
students to direct and guide their
"giving."
It is through such an
independent structure in the
community that Stanford
students work, receive course
credit, obtain the meaningful
experiences reported, and
reciprocally, are able to give so
much of themselves to the
disturbed children with whom
they work.

irresponsible Accusation
Editor:
In the few months that William

Saxbe has held the post of
Attorney General of the U.S., he
has distinguished himself with a
number of controversial quips.
His latest remark, that of
accusing Patricia Hearst of being a
"common criminal " who
willingly participated in the
alleged SLA robbery of a Hibernia
branch bank in San Francisco, is
an act of outrageous speculation,
totally unbefitting of a man in his
position.
To make such a statement,
even before a Grand Jury has
convened to consider the grounds
for an indictment of Patricia,
shows blatant disregard for the
spirit of American justice. Coming
from the man who heads the
Justice Department, this is all the
more insidious.
In view of the mysterious
circumstances surrounding the
kidnap and alleged "conversion"
of Patricia by the SLA, one might
expect cautious reticence rather
than circumstantial accusation
from influential personnages like
Saxbe.
Everyone has an "opinion" on
the Hearst affair, but until Patty,
the Field Marshall, and his ilk are
apprehended, no one can pass any
definitive judgments. To do so can
only confuse and complicate an
already dangerous situation.
Let us hope that our Attorney
General comes to his senses, that a
quotable tongue and prominent
mind might find harmony
together.
