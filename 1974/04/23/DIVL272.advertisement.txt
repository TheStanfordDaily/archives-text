This is your key to unprecedented calculating \
capacity. Only Hewlett-Packard offers it \m
It lets you "speak" to your calculator with total consistency, because \S
it lets you load data into a 4-Register Stack. This means: (1) you always
enter and process your data the same way, no matter what your problem;
(2) you don't have to re-enter data; (3) you can see all intermediate data
Our HP-45 is one of two pre-programmed scientific pocket-sized 'fpj If
computer calculators with this key. That's one reason it's the most pow
erful pre-programmed pocket-sized scientific computer calculator. Here
1. It's pre-programmed to handle 44 arithmetic, trigonometric and
logarithmic functions and data manipulation operations beyond the jBB
2. It lets you store nine constants in its nine Addressable Memory
Registers, and it gives you a "Last X" Register for error correction or
multiple operations on the same number. BBT 1 H| ;'S j:i x MIf
3. It displays up to 10 significant digits in either fixed-decimal or IB
scientific notation and automatically positions the decimal point through
Our HP-35 is the other. It handles 22 functions, has one Addressable |B
Memory Register and also displays up to 10 digits in either fixed-decimal
or scientific notation. It's the second most powerful pre-programmed
pocket-sized scientific computer calculator.
Both of these exceptional instruments are on display now If you're B
