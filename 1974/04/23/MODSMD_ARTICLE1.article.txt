# Valuable Ch'ing Vase Stolen From Museum
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
A $15,000 Ch'ing dynasty Chinese
vase was stolen from the Stanford
Museum Friday, University officials
said yesterday.
The theft came just three days after
some $2400 worth of Japanese ivory
statuary was taken from the museum.
x"here was no immediate word on
whether the two thefts might be
related.
However, Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Capt. Frank Mosunic told the
Palo Alto Times that "there's a good
possibility" that the vase theft was
â€želated to a Friday night Cupertino
burglary in which a $7000 jade statue
was taken.
The Stanford vase was one of an
identical pair donated to the museum

by Mrs. Frank E. Buck in 1969. The
other vase, housed in a separate
display case, was not touched.
The stolen vase, intricately sculpted
from a single piece of jade, was
apparently removed forcibly from its
glass case between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.
Friday.
According to reports, there were
about 20 people in the museum at the
time.
Jon C. Cosovich, University
associate general secretary, said
yesterday that the University would
act immediately to tighten museum
security. He said Art Department and
museum personnel would begin taking
extra security shifts, and that officials
will shortly meet to examine
longer-term solutions.
(A museum official who had earlier
sought to kill a Daily story on the
$2400 burglary last week said then
that budget considerations had left
security at the museum understaffed.
The Daily declined the museum
official's request that the story not be
published.)
Museum Registrar Anita Mozley
said yesterday that a reward would be
offered for the missing vase. Cosovich
said that the donor had already been
informed of the theft, and "she
accepts the situation."
The vase was V2Vi in. tall, small
enough to be easily concealed in a
package or beneath a coat. Museum
officials said they saw no suspicious
persons in the building at the time of
the theft.
Museum officials may soon
circulate flyers with photos and
information about the missing vase to
dealers in the area, in the hope that
such action will make the vase more
difficult to resell.
In the Cupertino theft, a 25-pound
jade statue of the Quan-Yin "goddess
of mercy" was taken from the house
of James Feng, 21965 Hyannisport
Drive. Several smaller ivory carvings,
valued at $500, wnre also taken from
the Feng home, authorities say.
The vase taken from Stanford was
carved from spinach-green nephrite
jade, according to a University
statement.
The vase is decorated with
"elephant leave" handles, carved leaves
and flowers and coiled dragons. An
appraiser's report did not have a
specific date the vase was carved; the
Ch'ing (or Manchu) dynasty lasted
from 1644 to 1911.
