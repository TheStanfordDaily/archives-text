# GOP To Suffer November Losses?
## 
### 
William Ross

Many political pundits predict that voters
will massively rebuke the Republican Party in
November. Some political analysts even
question whether the GOP can survive the
expected debacle.
But while Watergate will almost certainly
cost the Republicans many votes this year,
there is reason to believe that the dangers
faced by the GOP have been exaggerated.
The by-elections in which the Republicans
have been routed this year with four losses
and only one victory aren't the best
harbingers of what is to occur in November.
In by-elections,- much national attention is
focused on one district and voters often use
the occasion as a referendum on the policies
of the executive branch of the national
government.
In the past, votes in the general elections
have tended to be based more on party
loyalty than on local issues.
Significant Similarity
The same is true to an extent in Britain.
Comparisons between the U.S. and Britain
are impossible due to differences in the
respective electoral systems.
But it is significant to note that the
Liberal Party won half of Britain's
by-elections in the year prior to February
1974, but captured only 14 out of 635 seats
in the House of Commons in the General
Election. In both the U.S. and Britain,
by-election votes are often protest votes.
Furthermore, the candidates in the
by-elections are by definition incumbents.
When the voters go to the polls in November,

most will be given a chance to vote for
incumbents.
Voters in Republican districts are unlikely
to reject many congressmen who have given
conscientious service to their constituents,
acquired seniority in Congress, and obviously
are not involved in Watergate.
It seems likely also that voters might cease
to associate Watergate with the Republican
Party. The fallacies of blaming individual
congressmen for the crimes of the Nixon
Administration are obvious.
Attitude Change Possible
But perhaps one of the main reasons why
it is wrong to disparage Republican hopes at
this time is that many events will occur
between now and November which might
change people's attitudes considerably.
If President Nixon is impeached and
removed from office, voters might decide
that the GOP has expiated its sins, causing
them-to be more inclined to vote Republican.
Nixon is obviously a liability to his party
at this time, although some GOP leaders still
futilely deny this. For example, Vice
President Ford told a press conference in San
Jose last Saturday that an appearance by
Nixon in Michigan helped a GOP candidate in
that state who lost a seat held for 42 years by
the Republicans.
He pointed out that the candidate was
nine percentage points behind in the polls
until Nixon arrived, but lost by only three
percentage points.
The fallacies of this statement are obvious.
Aside from the difficulty of analyzing and

interpreting opinion polls, it is clear that
Nixon was the very reason that the GOP was
20 points behind its usual strength in the
district.
Nixon may have pulled the candidate up
by six points but he did this only after
knocking him down by 20 points.
Republican fortunes would be improved by
Nixon's removal from office.
Tenacious Parties
As for predictions about the demise of
the Republican Party, history indicates that
American political parties are tenacious
organizations. Furthermore, their fortunes
have a way of fluctuating widely in short
periods of time.
In 1964 after the Goldwater fiasco,
political commentators questioned whether
the GOP could survive, but by 1966 the
Republicans had recouped many of their
losses and were able to capture the
Presidency in the next election.
In 1972, after the Nixon landslide, few
people guessed that in a matter of months,
impeachment and resignation would be
serious topics of discussion throughout the
nation.
The political situation is bad for the
Republicans today. They seem likely to
suffer losses in November that they as a
minority party can ill afford. But to make
firm predictions about the fortunes of the
GOP is a useless game.

cost the Republicans many votes this year,
there is reason to believe that the dangers
faced by the GOP have been exaggerated.
The by-elections in which the Republicans
have been routed this year with four losses
and only one victory aren't the best
harbingers of what is to occur in November.
In by-elections,- much national attention is
focused on one district and voters often use
the occasion as a referendum on the policies
of the executive branch of the national
government.
In the past, votes in the general elections
have tended to be based more on party
loyalty than on local issues.
Significant Similarity
The same is true to an extent in Britain.
Comparisons between the U.S. and Britain
are impossible due to differences in the
respective electoral systems.
But it is significant to note that the
Liberal Party won half of Britain's
by-elections in the year prior to February
1974, but captured only 14 out of 635 seats
in the House of Commons in the General
Election. In both the U.S. and Britain,
by-election votes are often protest votes.
Furthermore, the candidates in the
by-elections are by definition incumbents.
When the voters go to the polls in November,

most will be given a chance to vote for
incumbents.
Voters in Republican districts are unlikely
to reject many congressmen who have given
conscientious service to their constituents,
acquired seniority in Congress, and obviously
are not involved in Watergate.
It seems likely also that voters might cease
to associate Watergate with the Republican
Party. The fallacies of blaming individual
congressmen for the crimes of the Nixon
Administration are obvious.
Attitude Change Possible
But perhaps one of the main reasons why
it is wrong to disparage Republican hopes at
this time is that many events will occur
between now and November which might
change people's attitudes considerably.
If President Nixon is impeached and
removed from office, voters might decide
that the GOP has expiated its sins, causing
them-to be more inclined to vote Republican.
Nixon is obviously a liability to his party
at this time, although some GOP leaders still
futilely deny this. For example, Vice
President Ford told a press conference in San
Jose last Saturday that an appearance by
Nixon in Michigan helped a GOP candidate in
that state who lost a seat held for 42 years by
the Republicans.
He pointed out that the candidate was
nine percentage points behind in the polls
until Nixon arrived, but lost by only three
percentage points.
The fallacies of this statement are obvious.
Aside from the difficulty of analyzing and

interpreting opinion polls, it is clear that
Nixon was the very reason that the GOP was
20 points behind its usual strength in the
district.
Nixon may have pulled the candidate up
by six points but he did this only after
knocking him down by 20 points.
Republican fortunes would be improved by
Nixon's removal from office.
Tenacious Parties
As for predictions about the demise of
the Republican Party, history indicates that
American political parties are tenacious
organizations. Furthermore, their fortunes
have a way of fluctuating widely in short
periods of time.
In 1964 after the Goldwater fiasco,
political commentators questioned whether
the GOP could survive, but by 1966 the
Republicans had recouped many of their
losses and were able to capture the
Presidency in the next election.
In 1972, after the Nixon landslide, few
people guessed that in a matter of months,
impeachment and resignation would be
serious topics of discussion throughout the
nation.
The political situation is bad for the
Republicans today. They seem likely to
suffer losses in November that they as a
minority party can ill afford. But to make
firm predictions about the fortunes of the
GOP is a useless game.
