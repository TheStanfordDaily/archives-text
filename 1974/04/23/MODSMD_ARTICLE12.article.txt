# Sickle Cell Anemia Info Necessary
## 
### 
Turner, Lyons £

In the wake of increasing
awareness of Sickle Cell Anemia
as an important health problem,
the need for public information
has become urgent. The
utilization of a wide variety of
mechanisms to inform the public
is highly desirable. However, these
efforts have not been as valuable
as possible because some of the
information conveyed has been
inaccurate, unduly alarming, or
misleading.
Through the media, Sickle Cell
Anemia has been portrayed as
solely a black disease, while in
reality Sickle Cell Anemia affects
the lives of some Greeks, Italians,
Sicilians, and Turks. Emphasizing
the disease's most dramatic
symptoms, the media has even
iescribed Sickle Cell Anemia as
'the black scourge." These are
among the many grave
misconceptions concerning Sickle
Cell Anemia.
Widespread also is the
conception that the life span of
persons having Sickle Cell Anemia
is shortened considerably. Such
statements are not only
misleading, but can also be
damaging to those persons
possessing the disease.
Defensive Adaptation
Ironically, Sickle Cell Anemia
results from a genetic adaptation
for defense against malaria. The
sickling phenomenom destroys
the malaria-carrying parasite that
resides in the red blood cells. The
sickle-shaped blood cells were first
observed by Dr. Herrick in 1910.

Not until 1949 when Dr. Linus
Pauling identified the genetic
origin of Sickle Cell Anemia were
any further scientific
investigations of the disease made.
Even though Sickle Cell
Anemia was one of the first
diseases to be understood on the
molecular level, no work was
initiated to develop a cure or an
effective clinical treatment.
Although Sickle Cell Anemia has a
higher prevalence rate than such
disorders as Cystic Fibrosis,
Leukemia, Hemophilia, Muscular
Dystrophy, etc., for years it has
maintained low priority for funds,
and for support of research
efforts.
However, only after an increase
in public awareness about the
disorder in the late 1960s did
research and clinical activity focus
on the Sickle Cell Anemia health
problem. Today, interest and
activity related to Sickle Cell
Anemia has reached major
proportions.
Accurate Info Essential
With the current
misconceptions and fraudulent
uses of the disorder, it is
imperative that any Sickle Cell
Anemia service program provide
its participants with both accurate
information and confidentiality.
With this purpose in mind, the
Mid-Peninsula Sickle Cell Anemia
Foundation was created by Don
Williams, a black Stanford medical
student.
Under the auspices of Stanford
University and the Mid-Peninsula

Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation, a
program is being implemented by
six pre-medical students (called
the Central Committee) this
quarter. The Central Committee
consists of: Don Hearn, Chairman,
Hilliard Floyd, Chris Huddleston,
Emily Lee, Vikki Lyons and
Arnold Turner.
Representing the University is
Dr. McClenahan of Cowell Health
Center and representative for the
Mid-Peninsula Sickle Cell Anemia
Foundation is Aaron Smith,
Clinical Social Worker for the
Medical Center.
The three-phase program aimed
at the entire Stanford Community
(including faculty, staff, and
students) will provide its
participants with education,

testing and counseling about
Sickle Cell Anemia while
maintaining complete
confidentiality. The first part of
the program, the education phase,
began Monday, April 15, and will
continue through Friday, May 10.
A student session will be
conducted in Roble and Lagunita
this Thursday night. Sessions will
also be arranged to accommodate
faculty, staff, and their families.
The specific times and places of
these sessions will be published in
"Once Around the Quad." For
further information please call:
321-1200, extension 5091 or

reality Sickle Cell Anemia affects
the lives of some Greeks, Italians,
Sicilians, and Turks. Emphasizing
the disease's most dramatic
symptoms, the media has even
iescribed Sickle Cell Anemia as
'the black scourge." These are
among the many grave
misconceptions concerning Sickle
Cell Anemia.
Widespread also is the
conception that the life span of
persons having Sickle Cell Anemia
is shortened considerably. Such
statements are not only
misleading, but can also be
damaging to those persons
possessing the disease.
Defensive Adaptation
Ironically, Sickle Cell Anemia
results from a genetic adaptation
for defense against malaria. The
sickling phenomenom destroys
the malaria-carrying parasite that
resides in the red blood cells. The
sickle-shaped blood cells were first
observed by Dr. Herrick in 1910.

Not until 1949 when Dr. Linus
Pauling identified the genetic
origin of Sickle Cell Anemia were
any further scientific
investigations of the disease made.
Even though Sickle Cell
Anemia was one of the first
diseases to be understood on the
molecular level, no work was
initiated to develop a cure or an
effective clinical treatment.
Although Sickle Cell Anemia has a
higher prevalence rate than such
disorders as Cystic Fibrosis,
Leukemia, Hemophilia, Muscular
Dystrophy, etc., for years it has
maintained low priority for funds,
and for support of research
efforts.
However, only after an increase
in public awareness about the
disorder in the late 1960s did
research and clinical activity focus
on the Sickle Cell Anemia health
problem. Today, interest and
activity related to Sickle Cell
Anemia has reached major
proportions.
Accurate Info Essential
With the current
misconceptions and fraudulent
uses of the disorder, it is
imperative that any Sickle Cell
Anemia service program provide
its participants with both accurate
information and confidentiality.
With this purpose in mind, the
Mid-Peninsula Sickle Cell Anemia
Foundation was created by Don
Williams, a black Stanford medical
student.
Under the auspices of Stanford
University and the Mid-Peninsula

Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation, a
program is being implemented by
six pre-medical students (called
the Central Committee) this
quarter. The Central Committee
consists of: Don Hearn, Chairman,
Hilliard Floyd, Chris Huddleston,
Emily Lee, Vikki Lyons and
Arnold Turner.
Representing the University is
Dr. McClenahan of Cowell Health
Center and representative for the
Mid-Peninsula Sickle Cell Anemia
Foundation is Aaron Smith,
Clinical Social Worker for the
Medical Center.
The three-phase program aimed
at the entire Stanford Community
(including faculty, staff, and
students) will provide its
participants with education,

testing and counseling about
Sickle Cell Anemia while
maintaining complete
confidentiality. The first part of
the program, the education phase,
began Monday, April 15, and will
continue through Friday, May 10.
A student session will be
conducted in Roble and Lagunita
this Thursday night. Sessions will
also be arranged to accommodate
faculty, staff, and their families.
The specific times and places of
these sessions will be published in
"Once Around the Quad." For
further information please call:
321-1200, extension 5091 or
5456.

are members of the Central
Committee.)

In the wake of increasing
awareness of Sickle Cell Anemia
as an important health problem,
the need for public information
has become urgent. The
utilization of a wide variety of
mechanisms to inform the public
is highly desirable. However, these
efforts have not been as valuable
as possible because some of the
information conveyed has been
inaccurate, unduly alarming, or
misleading.
