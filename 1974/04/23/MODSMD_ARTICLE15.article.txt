# Lessons Of '72 Election

Before the liberal "McGovern"
forces mount the next effort to
win the Presidency, we need
candidly and publicly to face
the real reasons for our crushing
1972 defeat.
And we have so far avoided
discussion of two very grave
problems: the campaign staff and
the candidate.
The early pre-Wisconsin
McGovern campaign staff was lean
and hungry, much ridiculed for its
unshaking confidence, but
remarkably high-spirited, and
effectively united. Ironically,
however, as McGovern's nomina
tion came to seem more and more
plausible, the moral momentum
was slowed.
The campaign came
increasingly to attract slovenly
and self-serving staff members
who, while perhaps technically
competent, generated tremendous
distrust and hostility in their
struggle for campaign power.
McGovern 'Pure'?
Moreover, much of the
McGovern staff was from the
beginning possessed by a crippling
sense of self-righteousness, a
conviction that McGovern was
"right from the start," and pure,
and that everyone else working
for every other candidate was
wrong from the start, impure, and
therefore unwanted.
An agonizingly large number of
talented Muskie and Lindsay
campaign workers were spurned in
their efforts to help McGovern in
a major way when their
candidates dropped out.
Numerous crucial party leaders
from more moderate ranks, who
could have been won over with
some tactful and well timed peace
feelers, were instead deliberately
antagonized and defied by the
younger campaign brain trust.
Moderates Needed
McGovern needed desperately
to reach out to these more
moderate and traditional wings of
the party. His failure to do so, and
particularly, to control the
oppressively self-righteous tone of
his campaign, must be counted as
a major fpctor in his November
landslide defeat.
This brings us to the problem
of the candidate himself. It is not
enough for the candidate to be
decent and humane, and
imaginative on the crucial issues
of our time.
Liberals must examine as well
with painstaking care the
executive capacity of the
candidates — whether they can
lead, unite, administrate, make
the kind of tough, firm, even
mean decisions that might hurt an
individual but salvage a movement
from backbiting disintegration.
Atmosphere Poisoned
McGovern lacked this capacity.
He was incapable of firing people
who needed to be fired, and so
they lingered on, poisoning the
atmosphere around them.
His inability to control and
discipline his staff might well have
prevented him from constructing
a coalition of political forces
broad enough to get any truly
substantial social legislation
through Congress.
It is easy to have a man as
caring and unselfish as George
McGovern. But we have to get
beyond our emotions, and
consider the chilling prospect of
having finally achieved what we
had sweated and bled and grieved
and gone to jail for — real political
power — only to have the man in
whom it was invested fail
miserably.
Long Term Damage
We must consider the long
term damage that could have been
done to the cause of American
liberalism if the Presidency
crumbled around McGovern as it
has around Nixon, not through
the practice of treachery and
deceit, but through shear
incompetence.
Such a disaster could have
proven much more devastating in
the long run than any assassination
or landslide defeat. We can
rebound from the latter, even if it
is only with great pain. But to
achieve power and then bring
more chaos than reform — this
would plant a long term cynicism
among young people and a long
term resentment in the electorate
which would punish liberal
aspirants in this country for years
to come.
We must be more exacting in
our search for a candidate in
1976. We must demand both
ideals and toughness, both
programs and the administrative
capacity to get them through.
If liberals settle for anything
less in 1976, they will lose, if not
the election, the country.
