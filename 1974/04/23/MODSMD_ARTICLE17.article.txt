### 
Stanford's Bing Nursery School
on Escondido Road, a laboratory
school for the University's
Psychology Department's studies
of human development, has
increased its bilingual program for
both pupils and teachers.
"Stanford student teachers
fluent in both English and Spanish
can communicate with our group
of 18 2'/2-to-5-year-old
Spanish-speaking children in the
familiar language of their homes,"
said Edith Dowley, professor of
psychology and director of the
nursery school.
"At the same time they are
exposing all the children in the
school to two languages, in the
natural, functional relationships
of daily nursery school living.
"It seems especially
appropriate for young children in
California, with its great heritage
of Spanish tradition and history."
