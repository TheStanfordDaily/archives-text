# Mark Naflalin:
## Easy Piano Blues 
### JAY HARLOW 
Pianist Mark NaftaJin has attained an
ever-growing following here since his first solo
concert on campus over a year ago. Last Thursday's
blues et al. recital in the Tresidder lounges should
only serve to continue that trend.
A veteran ofcthe Paul Butterfield Blues Band and
numerous recording sessions with blues, rock, folk
and gospel musicians, Naftalin has become well
known around the Bay area for his solo
appearances and his work with guitarist Michael
Bloomfield.
While his ensemble and recording talents are
obvious, Naftalin is probably at his best in a solo
situation, where he can vary dynamics, tempo and
style much more freely and expressively. Thursday
night, he used the magnificent Tresidder piano to
its limits in a variety of styles.
Stock labels such as blues, country, rock or
boogie don't exactly fit Naftalin's music. He
certainly shows influences of all of these styles, but
the distinctions among them are blurred. All of his
playing and singing is honest, unpretentious, and
with evident feeling.
The foundation for all of Naftalin's piano styles
is his left hand, which tirelessly puts out bouncing
boogie woogie, easy country or walking blues bass
lines. Meanwhile, the right hand is wandering over
the keyboard," doing syncopated melodic figures
full of blue notes and harmonies.
Thursday night's concert included original tunes
as well as those of Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Fats
Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis and others. Naftalin
began with a few instrumentals, then sang on most
of the remaining numbers. His voice, like his
playing, is not without its influences, but definitely

his own sound.
An original tune, "Strawberry Jam," was
dedicated to an unidentified friend in the audience,
and was clearly one of the best tunes of the
evening, exploring many levels of dynamics and
mood with blues modality dominating.
Toward the end of the first set, Naftalin
switched to the electric piano, announcing that it
was the "romantic" portion of the set. With heavy
vibrato effects, the piano sounded more like an
organ, and Naftalin played rich, complex chords to
take advantage of the sound.
To close the set, Naftalin played a requested
"pop tune" â€” Bacharach and David's "Walk On
By." Despite some strange electronic foulups in the
piano, he gave it an interesting, distinctively
personal rendition.
The second set began with a slow, searching
blues tune, then an uptempo boogie number, "I'll
Always Feel the Same." Jerry Lee Lewis' "Overton
Mountain," a Naftalin favorite, was another
standout.
The last number, which was not identified,
began as an easy, country tune, but Naftalin went
on to explore a series of different moods and the
full range of the piano's dynamics. He seemed
completely immersed in his improvisation, which
sometimes bordered on a classical sound. The
crowd of 150 or so obviously enjoyed it.
By all rights, a whole evening of piano music
based on two or three simple chord patterns should
have become boring before too long, but this one
never did. It has been said that there are no original
ideas in music, just old ones put together in
different ways. The way Mark Naftalin puts them
together is worth hearing.
