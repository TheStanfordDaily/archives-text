# Bowdoin Barrier Plan Retained
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Palo Alto City Council voted
6-2 last night to retain a plan to place
a barrier across Bowdoin Street in
College Terrace, rejecting a proposal to
move the proposed barrier to the
corner of Stanford Avenue and
Bowdoin.
In an effort to reduce traffic in
College Terrace, the council voted in
February to place a barrier in Bowdoin
between Stanford Avenue and College
Avenue. The barrier is scheduled to be
installed this week.
Councilman Alan Henderson moved
that the Council shift the proposed
barrier to the corner of Stanford and
Bowdoin, noting that residents
objected to the placement of the
barrier midway between Stanford and
College.
The council didn't place the barrier
at the corner of Bowdoin and Stanford
because it would make entrance to the
University Lutheran Church difficult,
Councilman Stanley Norton explained.
Church Property
Councilman Byron Sher pointed
out that if the barrier were moved to
Bowdoin and Stanford, motorists
would use the church's property to
gain entrance to College Terrace, thus
increasing the neighborhood's traffic
burden. The city cannot place a
blockade in the church's parking lot
because it is private property, he
added.
But D.M. Haskin, a resident of
Bowdoin Street, argued that many
people would drive down Bowdoin
expecting to gain access to Stanford
Avenue or College Avenue and would
have to use driveways to turn around
when they discovered the barrier.
Haskin said he conducted a poll of
18 residents of the 21 occupied houses
on Bowdoin and found that 17
opposed the placement of a barrier
between Stanford and College. The
other resident was disinterested in the
matter, he added.
Unwise
"It wouldn't be wise for the council
to adopt a plan that is opposed by
everyone on the block," Haskin told
the council. "We live there all week
long."
Janet Knecht, another resident of
the block, stated that many young

children play on the block and would
be endangered by motorists who
would enter the street unaware of the
barrier.
But Norton declared, "The
residents of the block are trying to
sterilize their street against all traffic. I
wish my kids could be so well
insulated."
Norton said he doubted if very
many motorists would fail to read the
sign announcing the barrier.
Furthermore, he pointed out, the plan
is only being tried on a three-month

experimental basis.
Henderson argued, however, that
there should be no interior barriers in
College Terrace. He said that it would
be a minor inconvenience for church
members to go around the block to
reach their building.
But Hal Seelsted, a member of the
congregation, said that moving the
barrier would "threaten the viability"
of the church. "The congregation feels
strongly that the barrier at the corner
would be detrimental to the
congregation," he said.
