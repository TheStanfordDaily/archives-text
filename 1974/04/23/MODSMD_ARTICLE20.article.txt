# Jefferson Starship
## Band Puts On 'Slick' Show 
### RANDY BAKER 
You know a stars hip's circling
in the sky
It ought to be ready by 1990.
They'll be building it up in the
air
Ever since 1980.
People with a clever hand
Can assume the role of a pilot
And hijack the starship;
The day is on its way
The day is ours.
SAN FRANCISCO - On
Saturday, April 20, the Jefferson
Starship played to a full house at
San Francisco's Winterland. The
band consists of Jefferson
Airplane leaders Grace Slick and
Paul Kantner, backed up by
drummer John Barbata, pianist
David Frieberg, and fiddler Papa
John Creach, also of the Airplane.
Missing from the original Airplane
group, however, were bassman
Jack Casady and lead guitarist
Jorma Kaukonen, the core of the
Airplane's instrumental sound
(both are supposedly speed
skating in Europe). Although their
replacements, Peter Kangaroo and
Craig Chaquito, were more than
adequate, the group wisely did
not pretend to be the Airplane.
Instead, they focused on the
many things that Kantner and
Slick have done on their own.
The Starship blasted off with
the entire second side of Paul
Kantner's Blows Against the
Empire, from which the above
quote and the group's name were
taken. It was a spectacular way to
open the show, with Slick, bathed

in red light, standing at the center
of the stage, looking like a
sorceress, extending her arms
outward, intoning,
"Sunnnriiise . . .rise civilized
man. ..."
The show reached an early
climax when, as Kantner sang,
"Have you seen the stars tonight?
Would you like to go up on A
deck and look at them with me?",
thousands of tiny lights began to
whirl around the hall. During the
instrumental jam that followed,
they whirled around faster and
faster, until the dots became lines.
The songs played by Starship
were a mixed bag: recent songs
(such as "Milk Train"), middle
Airplane ("Wooden Ships"), old
Airplane (though none of the
classics such as "White Rabbit"),
two songs featuring Papa John,
and songs done on the
Kantner/Slick solo albums. Every
song was enjoyable and the set
had no low points.
Except for when he stepped to
the microphone, Paul Kantner was
content to stay in the background
and play rhythm guitar. Grace,
however, was up front on every
number and stole the show. When
not singing she pranced around
the stage, dancing, joking with the
audience, and talking with her
fellow musicians. With her gypsy
hair style and eyes full of mascara,
she looked strange, to say the
least.
After playing for about an
hour, the group closed with
"Manhole," from Grace's recent

solo album of the same name. The
crowd called them back for an
encore consisting of a blues
number featuring Kangaroo and
Chaquito and an expanded version
of the classic Airplane anthem
"Volunteers."
The crowd called for a second
encore, but the Starship did not
return, apparently because the
newly formed group had played
all of the songs in their repertoire
and had no desire to improvise.
