# Jewish Publication Shows High Quality
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
After standing on the sidelines
for ten months, the second issue
of the Jewish literary magazine
On One Foot proves to be
interesting reading for both Jews
and non-Jews alike. While
suffering from the financial
maladies to which newl>
established magazines are prone,
the quality of the articles is
surprisingly good.
Ranging from a contribution
by Golda Meir, now former prime
minister of Israel, to a chapter
from a novel-in-progress by
faculty member Belle Randall, the
magazine offers a wide variety of
perspectives, although it is
obviously specifically directed to
a Jewish audience.
In the first article, former
prime minister Meir presents a
glowing portrait of the future of
Israel. Rather than being
out-dated by her retirement, the
article offers a well-written
glimpse into the strength and
ideals which made the rebirth of
the state of Israel possible.
Also included are three articles
by Jewish students. Avi Nir, an
Israeli grad student at Stanford,
gives a brief reaction to the 25th
anniversary of Israel's
independence. Gayle Gubman
gives a sarcastic reaction to the
Jews for Jesus, complete with a
'made-up true story' about the
group attributed to Gubman's
grandmother. Daniel Brenner's
"The Holocaust: A Reflection"
offers some interesting, if rather
murky, views on the lessons to be
learned from the persecution of
Jews during World War 11.
In contrast to the other articles
is a chapter of Belle Randall's
forthcoming novel entitled "The
Dope." The scene is an acid trip in

Berkeley during the Spacy Sixties.
Randall takes a potentially corny
situation and creates a humorous
and somewhat nostalgic story of a
young girl's adventure into the
hallucenogenic realm. In the
process, some rather profound
religious points are raised, which
binds this chapter to the rest of
the magazine.
In general, On One Foot
appears to be a very readable
magazine. Editor Jeffrey Perl, a
senior in Communications, has
managed to start what could
easily become the most significant
Jewish publication directed
towards Stanford students.
Hopefully it will appear more
frequently than it has in the past.
