# Witherspoon: 'Dynamic'
## 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO - Jimmy
Witherspoon, the master blues
singer, closed a six-night
engagement at the Boarding
House Sunday night.
As bluesman Charlie
Musselwhite once said, "There're
a lot of guys around who shout
the blues, and a lot of guys who
wail the blues, but Jimmy
Witherspoon — he's a blues
singer
"Spoon," now 51, has been
perhaps the best blues singer on
the scene since joining Jay

McShann's Kansas City band in
1945, singing in a full-bodied style
similar to Big Joe Turner.
Wednesday night, April 17,
Spoon's quartet opened to a
rather sparse crowd with two
instrumental, including Kenny
Burrell's "Chitlins Con Carne."
The quartet consisted of
Russell Feranti (piano), Jim
Chanteloupe (drums), both from
the Robben Ford Sextet which
toured with Spoon for more than
two years, Bob Boehm (bass), and
"a man we affectionately call
Hollywood Fats," a fine blues
guitarist.
Throughout the set, Fats
switched from the distant, yet
biting, sound of T-Bone Walker
(on the slower tunes) to the
multi-note, fluid runs of Albert
King (on the uptempo numbers).
Fats played second guitar behind
Albert a few years back, and the
influence is still quite evident.
Feranti's piano work, when
featured, was a pleasant blend of
barrelhouse and sophisticated
modern jazz. Although he has an
extremely fast right hand, most of
Feranti's ideas come to surface
through his left, in the form of
highly syncopated, wide-open
chords, giving one the impression
of hearing two (or three) pianos at
once. To quote an expression used
sparingly in jazz circles — he
definitely plays with "both
hands."
Physically dominating the stage
even in the presence of
Hollywood Fats, Witherspoon
sang slick arrangements of several
old favorites, like" "Stormy
Monday," "Going Down Slow,"
"Kansas City," and his own "No
Rolling Blues."
"If fish can make love under
water,
And worms can make love
underground;

If rats can make love in a
garbage can,
Woman, you better not turn
me down."
The element most noticeable in
Spoon's arrangements is
dynamics. Spoon would often
start off a tune in almost a
whisper, with Fats barely audible
behind him, then gradually build
to one screaming chorus,
complete with crashing cymbals,
jumping off into a soaring,
high-pressure guitar solo, before
cutting off abruptly, as if teasing
the listeners.
A tune new to the Witherspoon
repertoire, "I Was Lost, But Now
I'm Found" is one of those rare
instances of a song that is more
than just a slow blues. Fats' quiet
guitar work (with reverb switched
in) made for a spooky, dirge-like
atmosphere.
The best numbers of the set
were saved for last, "Money's
Gettin' Cheaper:"
"7 can Y afford to live,
Guess I'll have to try.
Undertakers got a union,
And it costs too much to die.
Times gettin' tougher than
tough.
Things gettin' rougher than
rough.
Well, I make a lot of money;
Just keep spending the stuff."
and Bessie Smith's "Ain't
Nobody's Business" which sold a
million copies for Spoon in 1952,
and is still his most requested
song.
Spoon's voice has undoubtedly
lost a bit of its clarity over his 30
years in the business, but the
overwhelming power is still there
— and the polish.

"Spoon," now 51, has been
perhaps the best blues singer on
the scene since joining Jay

McShann's Kansas City band in
1945, singing in a full-bodied style
similar to Big Joe Turner.
Wednesday night, April 17,
Spoon's quartet opened to a
rather sparse crowd with two
instrumental, including Kenny
Burrell's "Chitlins Con Carne."
The quartet consisted of
Russell Feranti (piano), Jim
Chanteloupe (drums), both from
the Robben Ford Sextet which
toured with Spoon for more than
two years, Bob Boehm (bass), and
"a man we affectionately call
Hollywood Fats," a fine blues
guitarist.
Throughout the set, Fats
switched from the distant, yet
biting, sound of T-Bone Walker
(on the slower tunes) to the
multi-note, fluid runs of Albert
King (on the uptempo numbers).
Fats played second guitar behind
Albert a few years back, and the
influence is still quite evident.
Feranti's piano work, when
featured, was a pleasant blend of
barrelhouse and sophisticated
modern jazz. Although he has an
extremely fast right hand, most of
Feranti's ideas come to surface
through his left, in the form of
highly syncopated, wide-open
chords, giving one the impression
of hearing two (or three) pianos at
once. To quote an expression used
sparingly in jazz circles — he
definitely plays with "both
hands."
Physically dominating the stage
even in the presence of
Hollywood Fats, Witherspoon
sang slick arrangements of several
old favorites, like" "Stormy
Monday," "Going Down Slow,"
"Kansas City," and his own "No
Rolling Blues."
"If fish can make love under
water,
And worms can make love
underground;

If rats can make love in a
garbage can,
Woman, you better not turn
me down."
The element most noticeable in
Spoon's arrangements is
dynamics. Spoon would often
start off a tune in almost a
whisper, with Fats barely audible
behind him, then gradually build
to one screaming chorus,
complete with crashing cymbals,
jumping off into a soaring,
high-pressure guitar solo, before
cutting off abruptly, as if teasing
the listeners.
A tune new to the Witherspoon
repertoire, "I Was Lost, But Now
I'm Found" is one of those rare
instances of a song that is more
than just a slow blues. Fats' quiet
guitar work (with reverb switched
in) made for a spooky, dirge-like
atmosphere.
The best numbers of the set
were saved for last, "Money's
Gettin' Cheaper:"
"7 can Y afford to live,
Guess I'll have to try.
Undertakers got a union,
And it costs too much to die.
Times gettin' tougher than
tough.
Things gettin' rougher than
rough.
Well, I make a lot of money;
Just keep spending the stuff."
and Bessie Smith's "Ain't
Nobody's Business" which sold a
million copies for Spoon in 1952,
and is still his most requested
song.
Spoon's voice has undoubtedly
lost a bit of its clarity over his 30
years in the business, but the
overwhelming power is still there
— and the polish.
