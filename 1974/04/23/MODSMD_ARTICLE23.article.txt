# Igor Kipnis Plays Fine Harpsichord
## 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
Igor Kipnis took command of
both audience and repertoire in a
harpsichord recital at First
Methodist Church, Palo Alto,
Friday night. Known to readers of
Stereo Review as a perceptive
critic, Kipnis proved himself an
equally articulate performer and
engaging speaker.
His impressive ten-foot
Rutkowski and Robinette
harpsichord was well-suited to the
full house and large hall. Although
the four registers of this
extraordinarily large instrument
were put to good use in the course
of the recital, Kipnis tastefully
avoided using his program as a
vehicle for registration tricks.
Instead, he provided listeners
whose appreciation of the
harpsichord might be limited to
nodding acquaintance with a brief
and humorous explanation of its
resources and action.
The program itself, however,
was the greatest exposition of his
eloquence. Considerately selected
for variety and interest as well as a
comfortable length, the recital
presented several national styles
of the Baroque as well as an
exciting and successful
contemporary work.

Kipnis plays with a style which
is neither eccentric nor
monotonous, tailoring his
approach to suit the stylistic
requirements of each movement
and composer. The distinction
between the two prevalent
Baroque musical styles — the
French and Italian — was manifest
in the movements which opened
the Dandrieu Suite in C.
"La Lully" is a mannered and
pompous ouverture followed by
the less severe, mellifluous "La
Corelli." What Kipnis began as an
affetuoso Sarabande in "La Lyre
d'Orphee," however, became
somewhat overworked in the
second reprise, disintegrating into
formlessness.
In the elegant brevity of the
Purcell Suite in F, Kipnis showed
an attentiveness to detail and
nuance which was a hallmark of
his playing. The Prelude was free
but coherent, and the phrases of
the Minuet were delicately
shaped.
The Suite in 112 minor (Book I)
of Handel suffered somewhat
from the lugubrious sixteen-foot
registration of the fugue, which is
already laden with some thick
writing. In the dance movements,
however, Kipnis contributed
ornamentation to the repeats
which was beautifully executed
and integrated with the melodic
contours. This* applied to the
other suites as well, where the
ornamented reprises were
stylistically indiscernable from the
original.
The performance of
(1971) by Barbara Kolb quickly
dispelled any foreboding at
finding a piece for harpsichord
and tape on the bill. Kolb writes
with a sensitive understanding of
the instrument, capitalizing on its
capacity to maintain a texture of
great linear complexity.
Based on thematic fragments
from a Scarlatti sonata, the three
performing components (two tape
channels and the live performer —
all played by Kipnis, for whom
the work was written) enter
successively in different tempos.
Though the tape was subjected to
some electronic manipulation, the
toccata does not depend on
toying with sound effects, and is a
substantial and finely crafted
work.
A more even performance of
Bach was heard in the encore, the
Toccata in e minor. Here Kipnis
delineated the architecture of the
piece, highlighting
the juxtaposition of strict and free
sections, and concluding with an
eloquent, but unencumbered
fugue.
Kipnis' solid technical control
and flair for drama saved the
massive Toccata No. 7 in d minor
by Alessandro Scarlatti from mere
sound and fury. In this display
piece of endless sequences and
bariolage concluding with 23
variations on the folia bass, he
maintained a sense of form and
progression through contrasts of
recitative-like fantasy and
vigorous motor rhythms. It
provided a rousing finale to a
superb performance.

the Minuet were delicately
shaped.
The Suite in 112 minor (Book I)
of Handel suffered somewhat
from the lugubrious sixteen-foot
registration of the fugue, which is
already laden with some thick
writing. In the dance movements,
however, Kipnis contributed
ornamentation to the repeats
which was beautifully executed
and integrated with the melodic
contours. This* applied to the
other suites as well, where the
ornamented reprises were
stylistically indiscernable from the
original.
The performance of
(1971) by Barbara Kolb quickly
dispelled any foreboding at
finding a piece for harpsichord
and tape on the bill. Kolb writes
with a sensitive understanding of
the instrument, capitalizing on its
capacity to maintain a texture of
great linear complexity.
Based on thematic fragments
from a Scarlatti sonata, the three
performing components (two tape
channels and the live performer —
all played by Kipnis, for whom
the work was written) enter
successively in different tempos.
Though the tape was subjected to
some electronic manipulation, the
toccata does not depend on
toying with sound effects, and is a
substantial and finely crafted
work.
A more even performance of
Bach was heard in the encore, the
Toccata in e minor. Here Kipnis
delineated the architecture of the
piece, highlighting
the juxtaposition of strict and free
sections, and concluding with an
eloquent, but unencumbered
fugue.
Kipnis' solid technical control
and flair for drama saved the
massive Toccata No. 7 in d minor
by Alessandro Scarlatti from mere
sound and fury. In this display
piece of endless sequences and
bariolage concluding with 23
variations on the folia bass, he
maintained a sense of form and
progression through contrasts of
recitative-like fantasy and
vigorous motor rhythms. It
provided a rousing finale to a
superb performance.
Igor Kipnis took command of
both audience and repertoire in a
harpsichord recital at First
Methodist Church, Palo Alto,
Friday night. Known to readers of
Stereo Review as a perceptive
critic, Kipnis proved himself an
equally articulate performer and
engaging speaker.
His impressive ten-foot
Rutkowski and Robinette
harpsichord was well-suited to the
full house and large hall. Although
the four registers of this
extraordinarily large instrument
were put to good use in the course
of the recital, Kipnis tastefully
avoided using his program as a
vehicle for registration tricks.
Instead, he provided listeners
whose appreciation of the
harpsichord might be limited to
nodding acquaintance with a brief
and humorous explanation of its
resources and action.
The program itself, however,
was the greatest exposition of his
eloquence. Considerately selected
for variety and interest as well as a
comfortable length, the recital
presented several national styles
of the Baroque as well as an
exciting and successful
contemporary work.

Kipnis plays with a style which
is neither eccentric nor
monotonous, tailoring his
approach to suit the stylistic
requirements of each movement
and composer. The distinction
between the two prevalent
Baroque musical styles — the
French and Italian — was manifest
in the movements which opened
the Dandrieu Suite in C.
"La Lully" is a mannered and
pompous ouverture followed by
the less severe, mellifluous "La
Corelli." What Kipnis began as an
affetuoso Sarabande in "La Lyre
d'Orphee," however, became
somewhat overworked in the
second reprise, disintegrating into
formlessness.
In the elegant brevity of the
Purcell Suite in F, Kipnis showed
an attentiveness to detail and
nuance which was a hallmark of
his playing. The Prelude was free
but coherent, and the phrases of
the Minuet were delicately
shaped.
