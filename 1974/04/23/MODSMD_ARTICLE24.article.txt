Meir Replacement Named
TEL AVIV — Israel's ruling Labor party
yesterday named Yitshak Rabin, former chief of
staff and ambassador to Washington, to replace
Premier Golda Meir and form a new government,
party officials announced.
Rabin, a war veteran and diplomat who entered
politics only last year, defeated Information
Minister Shimon Peres for the nomination by a
party vote of 298 to 254, officials said.
The nomination still leaves Rabin far short of
forming a new coalition government from Israel's
divided and bickering political parties.
Ford Calls For Cooperation
NEW YORK — Vice President Gerald R. Ford
said yesterday he would have pushed the Watergate
investigation harder if he had been in the White
House when the scandals first broke.
In a question-and-answer session at- the annual
meeting of The Associated Press, Ford also called on
President Nixon to "do anything reasonable" to
clear up the Watergate controversy, including
maximum cooperation with the House Judiciary
Committee's impeachment probe.
Ford said he hoped Nixon would, within the
next 72 hours, turn over the relevant material asked
by the committee from the White House.
A subpoena issued by the committee seeking
tapes and documents from the White House files
due Thursday morning.
'Operation Zebra' Halt Sought
SAN FRANCISCO - Citing "fear of
molestation" by police, six young black men asked
a federal court judge yesterday to halt the citywide
stop-and-search dragnet for the black killers of 12
whites.
But unless the court orders otherwise, a police

spokesman said, officers will expand and press their
search for the street killers "until an arrest is made."
Police might call in some 125 reserve officers to
augment the force, stretched thin by the five-day
hunt for a man fitting a police composite drawing of
one of the killers, said the spokesman, Lt. William
O'Connor.
"They will not be used to question any suspects.
They will be used solely as observers, as additional
eyes and ears," O'Connor said of the reserves, who
receive annual training at the police academy.
O'Connor said about 435 persons had been
questioned since Mayor Joseph L. Alioto declared a
"mad killer" was loose in the city and ordered the
procedure last Wednesday night as "an
extraordinary measure."
Black leaders have bitterly denounced the
method employed to find the killers who began
their death spree last November.
SLA Threat To Police Checked
SACRAMENTO — A man purporting to be
"General Pax" of the Symbionese Liberation Army
vowed in messages to a Sacramento newspaper
yesterday that five California peace officers would
be slain for any SLA member killed.
"The Symbionese Liberation Army will not
allow itself to be slaughtered by the Fascist forces
who suppress us now," said a printed message
received by the Sacramento Bee.
The statement and. an accompanying tape
recording were sent to the FBI headquarters in
Washington for analysis.
John Reed, agent in charge of the Sacramento
FBI office, said the two messages do not follow the
pattern of known communiques from the SLA,
which claims responsibility for the Feb. 4 kidnaping
of newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.
But he said the FBI cannot assume they are not
authentic.
"Since the life of the victim is still in jeopardy
and the lives of police officers are in jeopardy, we
can't take that chance," Reed said.
The name General Pax has not appeared on any
of the earlier SLA communications, the style was
different from messages believed to be from the
SLA and there was no reference to Patricia Hearst.
On the tape, the man calling himself General Pax
said the messages were sent to the Bee since "you
represent the capital of the State of California.
"You are responsible for informing the
appropriate authorities. The purpose of this order is
to prevent the setup and assassination of the
members of the SLA by the Fascist state agents,"
said the man called Pax.
Mitchell Trial Testimony Ends
NEW YORK — Testimony ended yesterday in
the federal criminal conspiracy trial of former Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell and onetime Commerce
Secretary Maurice H. Stans as the court proceedings
entered their 10th week.
As attorneys for both sides announced they had
completed presentation of testimony, Mitchell was
leaning forward with his elbows on the defense
table. At a separate table, Stans sat back in his
chair, expressionless.
Federal Judge Lee P. Gagliardi scheduled closings
arguments for today and tomorrow, and indicated
the jury of nine men and three women would get
the case late tomorrow.
In all, 59 witnesses were called, three of them
appearing for both sides.
Mitchell and Stans are accused of conspiring to
impede a Securities and Exchange Commission
fraud probe into the international financial complex
of multimillionaire Robert L. Vesco, in return for
his secret $200,000 cash contribution to President
Nixon's 1972 reelection campaign.

and the $121 million reported in the last three
months of last year.

Meir Replacement Named
TEL AVIV — Israel's ruling Labor party
yesterday named Yitshak Rabin, former chief of
staff and ambassador to Washington, to replace
Premier Golda Meir and form a new government,
party officials announced.
Rabin, a war veteran and diplomat who entered
politics only last year, defeated Information
Minister Shimon Peres for the nomination by a
party vote of 298 to 254, officials said.
The nomination still leaves Rabin far short of
forming a new coalition government from Israel's
divided and bickering political parties.
Ford Calls For Cooperation
NEW YORK — Vice President Gerald R. Ford
said yesterday he would have pushed the Watergate
investigation harder if he had been in the White
House when the scandals first broke.
In a question-and-answer session at- the annual
meeting of The Associated Press, Ford also called on
President Nixon to "do anything reasonable" to
clear up the Watergate controversy, including
maximum cooperation with the House Judiciary
Committee's impeachment probe.
Ford said he hoped Nixon would, within the
next 72 hours, turn over the relevant material asked
by the committee from the White House.
A subpoena issued by the committee seeking
tapes and documents from the White House files
due Thursday morning.
'Operation Zebra' Halt Sought
SAN FRANCISCO - Citing "fear of
molestation" by police, six young black men asked
a federal court judge yesterday to halt the citywide
stop-and-search dragnet for the black killers of 12
whites.
But unless the court orders otherwise, a police

spokesman said, officers will expand and press their
search for the street killers "until an arrest is made."
Police might call in some 125 reserve officers to
augment the force, stretched thin by the five-day
hunt for a man fitting a police composite drawing of
one of the killers, said the spokesman, Lt. William
O'Connor.
"They will not be used to question any suspects.
They will be used solely as observers, as additional
eyes and ears," O'Connor said of the reserves, who
receive annual training at the police academy.
O'Connor said about 435 persons had been
questioned since Mayor Joseph L. Alioto declared a
"mad killer" was loose in the city and ordered the
procedure last Wednesday night as "an
extraordinary measure."
Black leaders have bitterly denounced the
method employed to find the killers who began
their death spree last November.
SLA Threat To Police Checked
SACRAMENTO — A man purporting to be
"General Pax" of the Symbionese Liberation Army
vowed in messages to a Sacramento newspaper
yesterday that five California peace officers would
be slain for any SLA member killed.
"The Symbionese Liberation Army will not
allow itself to be slaughtered by the Fascist forces
who suppress us now," said a printed message
received by the Sacramento Bee.
The statement and. an accompanying tape
recording were sent to the FBI headquarters in
Washington for analysis.
John Reed, agent in charge of the Sacramento
FBI office, said the two messages do not follow the
pattern of known communiques from the SLA,
which claims responsibility for the Feb. 4 kidnaping
of newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.
But he said the FBI cannot assume they are not
authentic.
"Since the life of the victim is still in jeopardy
and the lives of police officers are in jeopardy, we
can't take that chance," Reed said.
The name General Pax has not appeared on any
of the earlier SLA communications, the style was
different from messages believed to be from the
SLA and there was no reference to Patricia Hearst.
On the tape, the man calling himself General Pax
said the messages were sent to the Bee since "you
represent the capital of the State of California.
"You are responsible for informing the
appropriate authorities. The purpose of this order is
to prevent the setup and assassination of the
members of the SLA by the Fascist state agents,"
said the man called Pax.
Mitchell Trial Testimony Ends
NEW YORK — Testimony ended yesterday in
the federal criminal conspiracy trial of former Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell and onetime Commerce
Secretary Maurice H. Stans as the court proceedings
entered their 10th week.
As attorneys for both sides announced they had
completed presentation of testimony, Mitchell was
leaning forward with his elbows on the defense
table. At a separate table, Stans sat back in his
chair, expressionless.
Federal Judge Lee P. Gagliardi scheduled closings
arguments for today and tomorrow, and indicated
the jury of nine men and three women would get
the case late tomorrow.
In all, 59 witnesses were called, three of them
appearing for both sides.
Mitchell and Stans are accused of conspiring to
impede a Securities and Exchange Commission
fraud probe into the international financial complex
of multimillionaire Robert L. Vesco, in return for
his secret $200,000 cash contribution to President
Nixon's 1972 reelection campaign.

Oil Firms' Profits Up Again
NEW YORK — Leading off a week of oil
industry reports, two of the major oil companies
announced yesterday first-quarter profits more than
75 percent higher than a year earlier.
Both companies said overseas operations were
responsible for much of the jump.
Gulf Oil Corp., one of the country's top five oil
firms in terms of sales, said its earnings for the first
three months of this year totaled $290 million, 76
percent over the $165 million reported for the same
period of 1973, and 26 percent over the $230
million in the final quarter of last year.
Standard Oil of Indiana, Amoco, which is ranked
in the top 10 by sales, reported earnings of $219
million for the first quarter, up 81 percent from
both the $121.1 million in the first quarter of 1973
and the $121 million reported in the last three
months of last year.
Survivors Found In Jet Crash
DENPASAR, Bali — A Pan American 707 jetliner
with 107 persons aboard crashed in mountainous
terrain north of here and an Indonesian government
minister said today that some survivors had been
found.
The official, Communications Minister Emil
Salim, did not say how many survivors there were
and gave no details. He said two search and rescue
teams were sent to the crash site at Gragak village,
about 40 miles from the capital of Denpasar,
immediately after the crash last night.
Today's Weather
Increasing cloudiness with chance of showers.
Partly cloudy today through tomorrow with
showers likely. Highs both days in the mid 50s to
mid 60s. Lows both nights in the mid 40s to low
50s. Winds westerly 10 to 20 mph. Chance of rain

Meir Replacement Named
TEL AVIV — Israel's ruling Labor party
yesterday named Yitshak Rabin, former chief of
staff and ambassador to Washington, to replace
Premier Golda Meir and form a new government,
party officials announced.
Rabin, a war veteran and diplomat who entered
politics only last year, defeated Information
Minister Shimon Peres for the nomination by a
party vote of 298 to 254, officials said.
The nomination still leaves Rabin far short of
forming a new coalition government from Israel's
divided and bickering political parties.
Ford Calls For Cooperation
NEW YORK — Vice President Gerald R. Ford
said yesterday he would have pushed the Watergate
investigation harder if he had been in the White
House when the scandals first broke.
In a question-and-answer session at- the annual
meeting of The Associated Press, Ford also called on
President Nixon to "do anything reasonable" to
clear up the Watergate controversy, including
maximum cooperation with the House Judiciary
Committee's impeachment probe.
Ford said he hoped Nixon would, within the
next 72 hours, turn over the relevant material asked
by the committee from the White House.
A subpoena issued by the committee seeking
tapes and documents from the White House files
due Thursday morning.
'Operation Zebra' Halt Sought
SAN FRANCISCO - Citing "fear of
molestation" by police, six young black men asked
a federal court judge yesterday to halt the citywide
stop-and-search dragnet for the black killers of 12
whites.
But unless the court orders otherwise, a police

spokesman said, officers will expand and press their
search for the street killers "until an arrest is made."
Police might call in some 125 reserve officers to
augment the force, stretched thin by the five-day
hunt for a man fitting a police composite drawing of
one of the killers, said the spokesman, Lt. William
O'Connor.
"They will not be used to question any suspects.
They will be used solely as observers, as additional
eyes and ears," O'Connor said of the reserves, who
receive annual training at the police academy.
O'Connor said about 435 persons had been
questioned since Mayor Joseph L. Alioto declared a
"mad killer" was loose in the city and ordered the
procedure last Wednesday night as "an
extraordinary measure."
Black leaders have bitterly denounced the
method employed to find the killers who began
their death spree last November.
SLA Threat To Police Checked
SACRAMENTO — A man purporting to be
"General Pax" of the Symbionese Liberation Army
vowed in messages to a Sacramento newspaper
yesterday that five California peace officers would
be slain for any SLA member killed.
"The Symbionese Liberation Army will not
allow itself to be slaughtered by the Fascist forces
who suppress us now," said a printed message
received by the Sacramento Bee.
The statement and. an accompanying tape
recording were sent to the FBI headquarters in
Washington for analysis.
John Reed, agent in charge of the Sacramento
FBI office, said the two messages do not follow the
pattern of known communiques from the SLA,
which claims responsibility for the Feb. 4 kidnaping
of newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.
But he said the FBI cannot assume they are not
authentic.
"Since the life of the victim is still in jeopardy
and the lives of police officers are in jeopardy, we
can't take that chance," Reed said.
The name General Pax has not appeared on any
of the earlier SLA communications, the style was
different from messages believed to be from the
SLA and there was no reference to Patricia Hearst.
On the tape, the man calling himself General Pax
said the messages were sent to the Bee since "you
represent the capital of the State of California.
"You are responsible for informing the
appropriate authorities. The purpose of this order is
to prevent the setup and assassination of the
members of the SLA by the Fascist state agents,"
said the man called Pax.
Mitchell Trial Testimony Ends
NEW YORK — Testimony ended yesterday in
the federal criminal conspiracy trial of former Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell and onetime Commerce
Secretary Maurice H. Stans as the court proceedings
entered their 10th week.
As attorneys for both sides announced they had
completed presentation of testimony, Mitchell was
leaning forward with his elbows on the defense
table. At a separate table, Stans sat back in his
chair, expressionless.
Federal Judge Lee P. Gagliardi scheduled closings
arguments for today and tomorrow, and indicated
the jury of nine men and three women would get
the case late tomorrow.
In all, 59 witnesses were called, three of them
appearing for both sides.
Mitchell and Stans are accused of conspiring to
impede a Securities and Exchange Commission
fraud probe into the international financial complex
of multimillionaire Robert L. Vesco, in return for
his secret $200,000 cash contribution to President
Nixon's 1972 reelection campaign.
