# Apartment Searched

Police unsuccessfully searched an
Escondido Village apartment late last night,
seeking a suspect in an East Palo Alto murder.
Some 14 police officers and a helicopter
arrived shortly after 10 p.m. last night to
search Blackwelder Court apartment 123 D for
a man they believe was involved in at least one
shooting and possibly two.
The suspect was apparently not connected
with Stanford in any way, according to San
Mateo County Sheriff's Officer Gerald Fitting.
Fitting said police proceeded to the
apartment "on the basis of information"
which he would not reveal. Nor would he say
why the suspect would be in the apartment if
he didn't live there.
Just who did live in the apartment was still
unknown last night.
Officially the suspect is wanted in
connection with only one killing â€” that of
James Stamper, 22, of East Palo Alto, Sunday
night. Police theorized, though, that the
Stamper shooting was related to another
murder in Menlo Park early Saturday morning.
The victim of the first murder was
Lafayette Moultrie, 25, of San Jose.
Fitting refused to release the name of the
suspect in the two murders. But he did offer a
description: a black male, in his early 20s,
about six-foot-one and 185 pounds.
Fitting indicated the police had no warrant,
but said the situation didn't require one. The
search of the empty apartment took 45
minutes, Fitting said, because police checked
the apartment's attic and storage areas.
