## Copiers Produce Paper, Profits 
### K.C. FLYNN 
Copies are big business. Think you spend a lot of money
on those coin-operated Xerox machines in UGLY?
Nonsense.
Coin-operated copying is but a drop in a sea of Stanford
paper. In the ten seconds or so it takes to put your nickel in
the slot, press the green button and get your copy,
somewhere on the campus another 9.4 copies have been
made.
Stanford generates two million copies every month, 20
to 25 million copies a year. Xerox, IBM, and Savin copiers
lurk everywhere on the campus. According to Marty Chase,
a procurement analyst here, all that copying costs the
University about $600,000 a year.
The copies are expensive, but they don't last long, says
Chase. "Even Xerox has done studies," he says, "proving
that the average life of a copy is about three days." Still,
University departments and schools show an insatiable
demand for copies, and for paper in general, he says.
Stanford Big Consumer
Stanford consumed 161,000 reams of paper last year,
much of it in copies. All that paper, if stacked ream upon
ream, would rise five miles into the air, according to one
estimate.
Chase and several other University staff members are
trying to deal with the growing consumption of paper in
the face of increasing shortages from paper suppliers.
Last year Stanford's paper consumption went up 11
percent. But paper suppliers, hit with tightened
environmental rules and other restrictions, have raised
prices and cut production.
"Students aren't the prime consumers of copies," says
Chase. "The Law School, the Main Library, (University
News Service] — these are the big consumers."
Three Types Abound
Three types of copiers abound on the Stanford campus,
with Xerox machines the most popular. In recent years

IBM and Savin copiers have been making inroads, but
Xerox still accounts for 80 percent of the campus copies.
IBM and Xerox produce dry copies electrostatically;
Savin produces cheaper copies, but they're "wet" for a few
seconds, and come out on coated paper. Consumers
generally prefer dry copies; administrators like wet copies"
because they're cheaper.
Most students use copying machines in the campus
libraries, although some departments occasionally allow
students to use their machines.
Main Library Options
Four locations in the Main Library offer Savin copiers
while Xerox machines are located on the second floor of
UGLY. Main Library does have Xerox service, from 8 a.m.
to 9 p.m. in its photocopy room on the first floor. Lines for
this service can be long at peak periods, however, and the
copies are six cents apiece.
UGLY's machines offer the additional service of
two-sided copying, which helps the University save paper.
However, don't plan on saving money; a two-sided copy
costs twice as much as a regular.
Xerox machines are also found in the libraries of the law
school, earth sciences building, Cubberley, and the business
school. The business school earns high marks for its copy
room: it provides an unlimited supply of nickels, and is
rarely crowded. However, large signs indicate that Business
School students have preference.
The Lane Medical Library and the Falconer Biology
Library also have over-the-counter service. Additionally,
copying can be done at the Bookstore and at Tresidder
Union, but not after 5:30 p.m. Obtaining nickels is a
problem at Tresidder.
Large-Scale Copying
For large-scale copying a different type of copying
service is needed: no one wants to stand in front of a
