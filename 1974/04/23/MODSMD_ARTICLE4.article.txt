## Sponsor Sought For Thai 
### JOHN FREED 
Efforts to bring Nguyen Huu Thai
here as a guest professor have taken a
new turn since students voted last
week to invite Thai and to fund his
stay here.
Student organizers of the drive,
mostly residents of Columbae House,
now must coax one or more
departments to sponsor Thai's
appointment.
'The next step is definitely to get a
department to sponsor him," said
Gordon Wheat, a Columbae resident.
Jim Regan, a leader of the
committee to invite Thai to Stanford,
said that the sponsorship process is
apparently necessary, even though
Thai has been invited by the students,
not by a particular department.
Dean's Approval Needed
"I've been talking to some people
to see what 'sponsorship' means.
Apparently, we will have to get
approval from the dean ... of the
School of Humanities and Science.
Then [the nomination] goes to the
Provost and ultimately to the
Trustees," Regan explained.

"Our strategy is to approach the
Programs on Urban Studies, Social
Thought and East Asian Studies, and
then try to get the Communication or
Political Science departments to
co-sponsor him," Regan explained.
"What the question will be is
whether a large department will
sponsor a man invited by the students,
funded by the students, and not
necessarily 'qualified' to teach by the
traditional standards," Regan claimed.
Other hurdles faced by the group
include possible opposition by
American or South Vietnamese
governments.
"We're making plans now as to how
to approach our government and the
South Vietnamese government,"
Regan said.
National Support Sought
Congressman Pete McCloskey,
R-Menlo Park, has indicated he will
seek both Congressional and State
Department assistance for Thai's
release.
Regan revealed that Thai has
already received an invitation to be a
visiting scholar at Hamline University
in St. Paul, Minn, next year.
ASSU President Mike Herman,
whose slate gave no endorsement on
the Thai referendum, said the new
Council of Presidents has not changed
its viewpoint.
Philosophy The Same
"Our philosophy now is the same as
it was during the election," Herman
said. "We will coordinate any activity
which is the responsibility of the
ASSU Council of Presidents. While a
concern of ours is 'outside political
action,' we feel it is the responsibility
of interested student groups, such as
Jim Regan's, to initiate the activity."
Former ASSU President Kevin
O'Grady, who has been active in the

move to invite Thai here, said he will
propose amendments to the ASSU
bylaws to institutionalize the guest
professor program.
Question Of Responsibility
"One of the objections people
voiced [to the guest professor
program] was 'Who do you give
responsibility to?' The committee [on
the guest professorship], which will
have five members, will have that
responsibility," O'Grady stated.
"There is a chance," O'Grady
continued, "that Thai will not be able
to come, or that he will not use all the
money that has been appropriated.
Then, the committee will decide how
the money will be spent — whether
another professor will be invited to
teach for one quarter, for example."

release.
Regan revealed that Thai has
already received an invitation to be a
visiting scholar at Hamline University
in St. Paul, Minn, next year.
ASSU President Mike Herman,
whose slate gave no endorsement on
the Thai referendum, said the new
Council of Presidents has not changed
its viewpoint.
Philosophy The Same
"Our philosophy now is the same as
it was during the election," Herman
said. "We will coordinate any activity
which is the responsibility of the
ASSU Council of Presidents. While a
concern of ours is 'outside political
action,' we feel it is the responsibility
of interested student groups, such as
Jim Regan's, to initiate the activity."
Former ASSU President Kevin
O'Grady, who has been active in the

move to invite Thai here, said he will
propose amendments to the ASSU
bylaws to institutionalize the guest
professor program.
Question Of Responsibility
"One of the objections people
voiced [to the guest professor
program] was 'Who do you give
responsibility to?' The committee [on
the guest professorship], which will
have five members, will have that
responsibility," O'Grady stated.
"There is a chance," O'Grady
continued, "that Thai will not be able
to come, or that he will not use all the
money that has been appropriated.
Then, the committee will decide how
the money will be spent — whether
another professor will be invited to
teach for one quarter, for example."

FLORIDA SENATOR — Democrat Lawton Chiles lambasted traditions which
hamstring Senate committees in a speech in the MeyerLibrary Forum Room last
night. The Senator called for public financing of presidential campaigns.
Efforts to bring Nguyen Huu Thai
here as a guest professor have taken a
new turn since students voted last
week to invite Thai and to fund his
stay here.
Student organizers of the drive,
mostly residents of Columbae House,
now must coax one or more
departments to sponsor Thai's
appointment.
'The next step is definitely to get a
department to sponsor him," said
Gordon Wheat, a Columbae resident.
Jim Regan, a leader of the
committee to invite Thai to Stanford,
said that the sponsorship process is
apparently necessary, even though
Thai has been invited by the students,
not by a particular department.
Dean's Approval Needed
"I've been talking to some people
to see what 'sponsorship' means.
Apparently, we will have to get
approval from the dean ... of the
School of Humanities and Science.
Then [the nomination] goes to the
Provost and ultimately to the
Trustees," Regan explained.

"Our strategy is to approach the
Programs on Urban Studies, Social
Thought and East Asian Studies, and
then try to get the Communication or
Political Science departments to
co-sponsor him," Regan explained.
"What the question will be is
whether a large department will
sponsor a man invited by the students,
funded by the students, and not
necessarily 'qualified' to teach by the
traditional standards," Regan claimed.
Other hurdles faced by the group
include possible opposition by
American or South Vietnamese
governments.
"We're making plans now as to how
to approach our government and the
South Vietnamese government,"
Regan said.

Congressman Pete McCloskey,
R-Menlo Park, has indicated he will
seek both Congressional and State
Department assistance for Thai's
release.
