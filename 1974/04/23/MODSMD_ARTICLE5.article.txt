# Sen. Chiles Blasts Committee 'Barons'
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
"With traditions like calling the roll
still prevalent, the U.S. Senate is 100
to 200 years behind the times," Sen.
Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., declared last
night before a small crowd in Meyer
Library's Forum Room.
"Each committee chairman is like a
feudal baron, and whenever barons do
battle the king always wins. That's
why the President has so much power
today," Chiles noted.
The third-year senator, who won
his seat on a campaign which featured
his walking the length of the state,
expressed optimism that the Watergate
crisis might spur campaign reform
measures.
"We don't know how fruitful the
Watergate issue can be, not in terms of
Republicans losing office but in terms
of real reforms," he said. "Times of
crisis like this are our best chance to
really shake up the system."
Campaign Reform
Chiles voiced his support for a
campaign reform bill that would call

for a non-partisan elections
committee, campaign spending and
contribution limits and the outlawing
of "dummy committees." He also
called for public financing of
presidential campaigns on a "trial and
error" basis.
"I think complete public financing
at this time could be a mistake,"
Chiles said. "I haven't seen a
satisfactory bill on it yet. There might
be 'nut' candidates and all sorts of
court battles if the bills were badly
drawn."
The senator stated that all
candidates for any office should be
required to appear together several
times to publicly debate the issues.
"An incumbent should have to stand
on his record; he shouldn't be allowed
to hide from his opponents," he
declared.
Low-Cost Campaign
Chiles discussed his own campaign
practices, which elevated him from a
virtual unknown while costing far less
than his opponents' strategies: "I used
the book The Selling of the President
as a campaign bible — everything that
book said, I tried to do the opposite.
"People are just as tired as they can
be with all kinds of packaging of
candidates," he added. "People want
to touch and test out the candidate for
themselves, and that's why the walking
campaign was so successful."
Noting that in the primary
campaign he spent no money on radio,
newspaper or television advertising,
Chiles said, "I got my best
'commercials' every night at six and 11
when I made the news broadcasts. We
tried very hard to get continuous
media exposure — we didn't need
traditional campaign workers for
that."
Watergate Reaction
Chiles noted that "the healthiest
aspect of Watergate is that Congress is
finally facing up to the fact that it has
given up so much of its power to the
executive branch. All the power was
with the President; there was no
effective check that could prevent the
In another action, the Senate
appropriated $100 to defray the costs
of United Farmworkers Vice President
Dolores Huerta's speaking engagement
here May 2.
Huerta will speak at Memorial
Church on the current status of the
union and its plans for the future,
according to Doug Rice, member of
the Farmworker Support Committee.
Rice said Huerta helped Cesar Chavez
organize the National Farmworkers
Committee, which later became the
United Farmworkers Committee.
Of the total $1000 needed to pay
Huerta's speaking fee, Rice said $400
has been collected so far, half of that
from a donation by Memorial Church.
The Senate also passed by-laws
establishing staggered two-year terms
for the two student and two faculty
members of the policy board of the
Action Research Liaison Office.
The Senate also certified the results
of the Council of Presidents runoff
election held last week.
