# ASSU Limits Information Given To Lyman's Office
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
The ASSU Senate last night
clarified its position in a conflict with
the University over what information
President Richard Lyman should
receive about student members of his
advisory committees who are chosen
by the Senate.
In a "sense of the Senate"
resolution the Senate voted to limit
the information Lyman's office
receives to public information
including name, address, telephone
number and previous experience on
University committees. If the Senate's
selectee has no previous experience on
University committees, the
Nominations Committee and the
ASSU Senate will give what
information they think is necessary to

the President.
Last quarter the Senate rejected a
request by Assistant to the President
Bill Stone that Senate selectees submit
a personal statement of their interests
and qualifications to the President's
Office.
Both senators and their liaison with
the Dean of Students Office, Dale
Snape, said they were confident the
Senate resolution would resolve the
conflict.
Snape said the important thing
about the resolution is that it
establishes a framework for
communication between the
President's Office and the Senate,
something which he said didn't exist
before.

MORE OF THE SAME — Xerox copying machines, such as this one in Meyer
Library, comprise 80 percent of the copiers on campus. The demand among
Stanford students, faculty and administrators for copies continues to increase.
scandal."
He added, "Congress for thirty
years hasn't been a co-equal force with
the President, but we're moving
toward equality. A bill like the War
Powers Act, which 1 think is the most
important bill 1 have voted on in the
Senate, would have been impossible
before Watergate."
The senator sized up the prospects
for impeachment: "My guess is that
the House will vote the Articles [of
Impeachment]. That's an easy
political vote to make, and it will get
the House rid of the issue without
much fuss.
Facts Speak
'The congressman can tell his
pro-impeachment constituents that
he's supporting their issue, and his
pro-Nixon constituents that he's
letting the facts speak for themselves.
The House will just roll the
impeachment bomb down to the
Senate."

Chiles said that televised
impeachment proceedings would not
be a "circus." He stated, "They will
probably get rather boring. At first,
everyone will watch them, but as they
drag on for six or eight weeks, they
will become less of a spectacle."

SPIC 'N' SPAN — These eager workers clean the benches around the Claw in
White Plaza as part of the annual "Rite of Spring" clean-up held Saturday from
10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Students, faculty and staff — lured out of bed by the offer of
free beer, soft drinks, cheese, fruit and French bread — attacked White Plaza
with detergent and paint. The event, sponsored by Plant Services Director Dan
De Young and Trish Alexander of University Relations, also attracted the
Incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band which amazed
the workers with its musical accomplishments.
