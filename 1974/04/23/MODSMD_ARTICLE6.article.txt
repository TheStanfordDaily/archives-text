# ASSU Limits Information Given To Lyman's Office
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
The ASSU Senate last night
clarified its position in a conflict with
the University over what information
President Richard Lyman should
receive about student members of his
advisory committees who are chosen
by the Senate.
In a "sense of the Senate"
resolution the Senate voted to limit
the information Lyman's office
receives to public information
including name, address, telephone
number and previous experience on
University committees. If the Senate's
selectee has no previous experience on
University committees, the
Nominations Committee and the
ASSU Senate will give what
information they think is necessary to

the President.
Last quarter the Senate rejected a
request by Assistant to the President
Bill Stone that Senate selectees submit
a personal statement of their interests
and qualifications to the President's
Office.
Both senators and their liaison with
the Dean of Students Office, Dale
Snape, said they were confident the
Senate resolution would resolve the
conflict.
Snape said the important thing
about the resolution is that it
establishes a framework for
communication between the
President's Office and the Senate,
something which he said didn't exist
before.
