## Searches Legal? 
### 
In a mass dragnet of apparently unprecedented scope,
San Francisco police last week stopped and searched
hundreds of black citizens in a fruitless hunt for the
mass-murderer code-named "Zebra."
The operation continues this week amidst angry charges
and counter-charges.
"We are not willy-nilly going to stop black men because
they are black," Mayor Joseph L. Alioto said here Friday
night. "We are going to stop only those who reasonably fit
into the profile that the composite picture throws off. And
this is constitutional."
We are not so sure.
Searches and seizures fall under the fourth amendment to
the Constitution. A guiding principle of the amendment's
application is that "probable cause" must be demonstrated
if a search is to be held legal.
The threat posed to law-abiding citizens by the "Zebra"
killer requires extraordinary measures. It does not require
extraconstitutional ones.
It is far from clear that the unprecedented searches are as
constitutional as Mayor Alioto seems to believe. A court test
has been promised this week, and we hope it clears the water
at least a little.
Leaders in the black community have not restricted their
complaints to the dragnet's dubious legality. Some have
charged the almost-indiscriminate search carries overtones of
racism; others, that it is directed more at protecting the
Mayor's political future — the gubernatorial primary is six
weeks away — than at protecting his constituents' lives.
There is ample reason for their suspicions.
Whatever the motives behind the operation, however, one
probable effect is clear: another blow to the confidence
black citizens place in the police. The San Francisco Police
have had community-relations problems before. This episode
can hardly help.
In the last analysis, a criminal like the "Zebra" may never
be caught by public searches, no matter how massive.
There is no substitute for competent criminal
investigation. Without it, the police can accomplish nothing;
even with it, the massive search looks like a highly
inefficient use of police resources.
