# On Tax Coercion

I couldn't agree more with
Antony Ruprecht's position that
some sort of tax relief must be
granted to the American taxpayer
if he is to be able to afford the
college education of his choice for
himself or his dependents. But the
flan he has outlined (Daily, April
9) is blatantly contradictory and
fails to get to the root of the
problem.
Ruprecht frankly admits that
his "tax credit formula is
weighted in favor of the public
and land grant colleges," while
pointing out that "private
Institutions of Higher Learning
are especially in need of funds."
Can he honestly believe that
his proposed tax credit system
would do anything but encourage
more students to attend public
instead of private institutions,
thus worsening the declining
enrollment problem, with
concurrent loss of tuition income,
which has already forced many
private colleges out of business?
Apparently not, because he
envisions that "by the late 19705,
80 to 90 percent of the student
population will have to be in
public IHL which are paid for by
the taxpayers."
Public IHL Taxes
And now we come to the real
reason that Mr. Average-Middle-
Income Taxpayer can't afford to
send his own children to college.
Simply because he is already
paying to send everyone else's
children to public IHL. (I will
ignore for the time being the
complex issue of government aid
to private institutions.)
If a person wishes to send his
offspring to a private institution
such as Stanford, he is not
absolved from paying for a public
one like the University of
California. The only rational
conclusion for such a
financially-pressed individual to
reach is to take the only tax

refund open to him, that of
directly subsidized tuition at a
public IHL.
I therefore counter Ruprecht's
proposal with one of my own.
Each individual taxpayer should
be given the option of taking off
the top of his taxes the amount he
is currently being levied to
support public education and let
him spend it on the school of his
choice.
I further propose that this
option be granted for all levels of
education from pre-school
through post-graduate studies.
Coercion Opposed
I wish to make it clear that
although the implication of my
proposal is that everyone would
still be compelled to pay for
education in some way, I am
against any coerced support of
education institutions, public or
private.
I offer this proposal as a
compromise. It at least allows
each individual to express a
preference for public or private
education without lessening the
total cash flow into the
educational pool.
It is my belief that such a
system will clearly demonstrate a
preference for private education.
Ruprecht's alternative is a clear
death warrant for such
institutions.
If the American people truly
believe that it is their moral
responsibility to support public
education, let them cast the only
truly free votes they can, their
own dollars.
And if they are dissatisfied
with the nature of public
education, let them cast their
dollar ballots for the private
institution which best represents
the kind of education of which
they approve.
