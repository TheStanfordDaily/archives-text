I A Great Comedy Program!
BAMBI MEETS GODZILLA
- second for second the funniest short ever made!
THANK YOU, MASK MAN
-a Lenny Bruce routine in animated cartoon Voice by Lenny Bruce.
KING of
HEARTS *|
-the film that ran for 3 continuous years in one theatre in Cambridge, Mass. hM v
In an isolated surreal pocket of World War I, the British send Alan Bates into a highly unlikely, tiny French town to discover v Ima
a bomb. The townspeople have fled and the inmates of the local asylum have taken their place. The resulting interaction gives Mm
us some of the most enchanting sequences on film. When the reality of the returning armies breaks the bubble and the inmates
have returned to the asylum, we can really share Bates' confusion about which people are really insane. In our opinion, KING
OF HEARTS is a rare treat; funny and sad at the same time. Past audiences will vouch for this, and we know you will too.
