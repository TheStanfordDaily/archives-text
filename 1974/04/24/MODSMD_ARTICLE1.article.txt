# Hargadon Discusses Admissions Process

### WILLIAM ROSS 
The number of applications for
places in the freshman class increased
this year, Admissions Dean Fred
Hargadon stated last night.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Hargadon said that
approximately 9400 applications were
received for the 1470 places in next
year's freshman class, as compared to
9300 last year.
Hargadon noted that he has
consulted admissions officials at
leading eastern universities and said
that they also had experienced slight
increases in applications.
The University has maintained its
academic standards in the selection of
freshmen, Hargadon said. "Many able
and qualified students are
disappointed."
Hargadon emphasized that the
improvement in the quality of state
supported schools and the increase in
the tuition of private schools such as
Stanford has not made well qualified
students less inclined to apply to
Stanford.
'Great Merit'
"There is great merit in private
colleges," Hargadon said. "They still
attract highly qualified students."
Of those students who are accepted
by Stanford but do not attend,
approximately 75 percent attend
private schools that cost as much as
Stanford.
Hargadon stated that while 44
percent of this year's applicants were
Californians, he does not regard the
composition of the Stanford student
body as parochial.
'Wider Variety'
"There is a greater variety of
sections in California than in many
states," Hargadon said. "Since
Stanford is the only major private
university west of the Mississippi, it
attracts students from a wider variety

of locations than it would if it were
located in the east."
Hargadon said he is not sure
whether the political activism of
incoming students has declined in
recent years. Many students still
indicate participation in political
activities on their applications, he
noted. But he said he can discern no
change from the period of student
activism several years ago.
More students are indicating that
they plan to enter particular
professions, Hargadon said. He
expressed surprise that many students
seem to know what they want to do at
such an early age.
Traditional Careers
Hargadon said that he hopes
students do not decide upon
traditional careers without exploring
interesting and unconventional
occupations.
"I'm not sure if there is a causal
connection between the decline in
student idealism and the increase in
careerism," Hargadon said.
Hargadon also said that the
University is committed to keeping its
undergraduate enrollment at its
current level.
DeFunis Case
Hargadon commented on the
Supreme Court's refusal to rule in the
case of Marco DeFunis, a law school
applicant who claimed he was
discriminated against because he
wasn't a member of a minority group.
"My first reaction is that they (the
Court) dodged the issue," Hargadon
said. "I think that DeFunis should win
the case. One cannot discriminate on
the basis of race."
But Hargadon said that he could
understand why schools want to give
special preference to members of
minorities. "The case presents a moral
dilemma as it almost pits two rights
against one another."

FRESH CROP — Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon said that many of next
year's freshman have already decided on their careers.
The number of applications for
places in the freshman class increased
this year, Admissions Dean Fred
Hargadon stated last night.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Hargadon said that
approximately 9400 applications were
received for the 1470 places in next
year's freshman class, as compared to
9300 last year.
Hargadon noted that he has
consulted admissions officials at
leading eastern universities and said
that they also had experienced slight
increases in applications.
The University has maintained its
academic standards in the selection of
freshmen, Hargadon said. "Many able
and qualified students are
disappointed."
Hargadon emphasized that the
improvement in the quality of state
supported schools and the increase in
the tuition of private schools such as
Stanford has not made well qualified
students less inclined to apply to
Stanford.
'Great Merit'
"There is great merit in private
colleges," Hargadon said. "They still
attract highly qualified students."
Of those students who are accepted
by Stanford but do not attend,
approximately 75 percent attend
private schools that cost as much as
Stanford.
Hargadon stated that while 44
percent of this year's applicants were
Californians, he does not regard the
composition of the Stanford student
body as parochial.
'Wider Variety'
"There is a greater variety of
sections in California than in many
states," Hargadon said. "Since
Stanford is the only major private
university west of the Mississippi, it
attracts students from a wider variety

of locations than it would if it were
located in the east."
Hargadon said he is not sure
whether the political activism of
incoming students has declined in
recent years. Many students still
indicate participation in political
activities on their applications, he
noted. But he said he can discern no
change from the period of student
activism several years ago.
More students are indicating that
they plan to enter particular
professions, Hargadon said. He
expressed surprise that many students
seem to know what they want to do at
such an early age.
Traditional Careers
Hargadon said that he hopes
students do not decide upon
traditional careers without exploring
interesting and unconventional
occupations.
"I'm not sure if there is a causal
connection between the decline in
student idealism and the increase in
careerism," Hargadon said.
Hargadon also said that the
University is committed to keeping its
undergraduate enrollment at its
current level.
DeFunis Case
Hargadon commented on the
Supreme Court's refusal to rule in the
case of Marco DeFunis, a law school
applicant who claimed he was
discriminated against because he
wasn't a member of a minority group.
"My first reaction is that they (the
Court) dodged the issue," Hargadon
said. "I think that DeFunis should win
the case. One cannot discriminate on
the basis of race."
But Hargadon said that he could
understand why schools want to give
special preference to members of
minorities. "The case presents a moral
dilemma as it almost pits two rights
against one another."
