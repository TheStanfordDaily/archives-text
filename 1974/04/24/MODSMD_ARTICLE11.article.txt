# USE Bargaining Position Reasonable USE Bargaining Position Reasonable

This is in response to claims by Douglas
Barton, University spokesman in current
negotiations, which were published in the
April 16 Daily. Because the union had shifted
its demands and had been meeting with the
University since the mass assembly on April
11, Barton's article at first seemed untimely,
except for two factors:
1) The unit's demands have always been
"reasonable," as well as just, and Barton's sly
rebuttal must be exposed;
2) The article is just one more example of
how Vice President Augsburger can continue
to isolate the rest of the Stanford community
from any influence in determining personnel
policy, while simultaneously manipulating
people through the several media channels
available.
But, to the issues.
Wage Standards
One problem concerning community wage
standards is the difference between policy
and practice. The 1973-74 Operating Budget
Guidelines say, "As much as it might be
desired — to attain a superior competitive
position in compensation the
recommendation here is aimed at enabling
the University to move from a slightly below
average position to one solidly centered in
the market place."
So the policy is not based on what is paid
for like work elsewhere in the community
(community standards), but on marketplace
values (what they can get away with).
The result (besides cheating workers), is a
dissatisfaction, a high turnover rate and
inefficiency, certainly a false economy. While
Stanford may see itself in a "superior" or
"inferior competitive position," almost all
workers cannot compete when seeking a job.
Therefore a marketplace policy is neither fair

nor economically sound.
What Is Reality?
But what is reality? As the skill of the job
increases, Stanford wages get closer to the
"center of the market place." But the facts
show that Stanford's marketplace policy is a
lie. In practice they pay a little less than they
can get away with. Some Stanford workers
earn so little (for a full-time job) that they
are eligible for food stamps.
USE's demands for above-average wages
are based on the fact that Stanford workers
are called on for a higher mix and variety of
skills.
The administration could have admitted
the inadequacy of its policy, and planned for
yearly increases to wipe out the debt. They
did it nicely (so they brag) in the Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP). There, tens of
millions of dollars, hoarded in the early
19605, were used to reduce deficit spending.
Retirement Plan Charge
Barton's charge on the retirement plan is
off the mark as well. USE had asked that
Stanford workers be able to retire at full
wages, but only after 25 years of service. The
administration is trying to hide the fact that
it contributes less than half as much to the
pension plan as is put into social security.
Similarly, the administration is trying to
hide the fact that it puts 10 percent of the
wages of professionals (which are much
higher), but only six percent of unit workers'
wages, into a retirement plan.
Over 35 percent of the agreements in the
United States which cover 1000 or more
workers provide for five weeks or more of
vacation. Moreover, many service workers at
Stanford are laid off without pay several
times a year, while students and faculty are
on vacation.

Look at our holidays. We asked for Martin
Luther King's birthday, Veterans' Day, the
worker's birthday and one religious holy day
— four, not five holidays, but notice which
ones.
Under the administration proposal a
worker who has used up sick leave and
vacation may be fired during a long illness.
The few who need extended illness coverage
should not be sacrificed to the
administration's callousness. Besides, Barton
was told of IBM's unlimited sick leave, in
addition to USE's plan.
I think it is apparent that the remaining
proposals that Barton chose to list are
legitimate needs of many or most Stanford
workers. Sad to say, the administration's
response will not admit even that. They
haven't even "costed-out" most of the
proposals, although their constant answer is,
"No, the University will not do that."
'Overwhelmingly Costly'?
But if all these proposals are
overwhelmingly costly, then what about a
cost-of-living escalator that Barton thinks
"but one comparatively small item"?
Do you really want to be associated with a
"great" university that expects its workers to
take a pay cut each year? Would you relish
working for an employer that insults your
intelligence as Stanford does its workers'?
And if you were dealt out by Vice
President Augsburger in determining
personnnel policy, what would you do when
the union was forced to strike and thus deal
you back in? Would you recall your parents,
and their struggles to survive? Would you
look ahead to your future working days?
Well, tune in next month.

Employees.)
