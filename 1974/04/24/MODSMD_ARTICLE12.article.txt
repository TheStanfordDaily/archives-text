# Of Violence, Psycopaths And SLA
## 
### 
William Andrews

Many people today seem to
share the mistaken belief that the
end always justifies the means.
Violence and the violation of
the rights of one person, or a
group of people, in the so-called
pursuit of justice is no virtue.
A single, or a few, individuals
can decide that things are not
going along to suit them, and
wreak havoc with the lives of a
great many people. They say, "all
we have to do is to make threats,
or hold a hostage, and we can get
anything we want."
Precedent Set
A few years ago when the
prisoners at San Quentin were
rioting and making demands,
warnings were sounded from some
quarters that if the administration
negotiated with criminals, the
precedent would be set, and it
would never cease to be a
problem. These warnings went
unheeded.
Of course, when innocent
people are being held hostage, it is
a difficult thing to say, "Sorry,
but we can't negotiate for your
release." True, someone could get
hurt; or even killed, and no one in
his right mind would want that to
happen. On the other hand, if we
say to the perpetrators of these
crimes, "YOU LOSE! YOU CAN
NEVER WIN USING SUCH
TACTICS!" then
The news media are at least
partially responsible for the
continuation of some crimes.
Witness the coverage given this
so-called "Symbionese Liberation
Army." The media should say,
"ENOUGH! NO MORE

COVERAGE!" Lack of publicity
would hurt these criminals where
it would hurt the most.
Psycopaths, Death Warrants
Using such catch phrases as,
"exploiters" and "enemies of the
people" these psychopaths have
declared the issuance of death
warrants for certain individuals,
stating thac they will be shot on
sight. It has even been reported
that some families have found it

prudent to evacuate their homes.
If I advocated that SLA
members be shot on sight, I would
be denounced as insane, or
intolerant, at the very least, but
these people have sympathizers,
because it is fashionable to blame
society for the deviate behavior of
some individuals. To some extent,
society does shape the behavior of
its individuals, but it does not
produce every psychopath that

comes along.
I am sick and tired of being
told that society, and I because I
am a member of that society,
must accept responsibility for the
behavior of every individual who
goes berserk.
What ever happened to the idea
that some people are born JUST
PLAIN DAMNED MEAN?

A single, or a few, individuals
can decide that things are not
going along to suit them, and
wreak havoc with the lives of a
great many people. They say, "all
we have to do is to make threats,
or hold a hostage, and we can get
anything we want."
Precedent Set
A few years ago when the
prisoners at San Quentin were
rioting and making demands,
warnings were sounded from some
quarters that if the administration
negotiated with criminals, the
precedent would be set, and it
would never cease to be a
problem. These warnings went
unheeded.
Of course, when innocent
people are being held hostage, it is
a difficult thing to say, "Sorry,
but we can't negotiate for your
release." True, someone could get
hurt; or even killed, and no one in
his right mind would want that to
happen. On the other hand, if we
say to the perpetrators of these
crimes, "YOU LOSE! YOU CAN
NEVER WIN USING SUCH
TACTICS!" then
The news media are at least
partially responsible for the
continuation of some crimes.
Witness the coverage given this
so-called "Symbionese Liberation
Army." The media should say,
"ENOUGH! NO MORE

COVERAGE!" Lack of publicity
would hurt these criminals where
it would hurt the most.
Psycopaths, Death Warrants
Using such catch phrases as,
"exploiters" and "enemies of the
people" these psychopaths have
declared the issuance of death
warrants for certain individuals,
stating thac they will be shot on
sight. It has even been reported
that some families have found it

prudent to evacuate their homes.
If I advocated that SLA
members be shot on sight, I would
be denounced as insane, or
intolerant, at the very least, but
these people have sympathizers,
because it is fashionable to blame
society for the deviate behavior of
some individuals. To some extent,
society does shape the behavior of
its individuals, but it does not
produce every psychopath that

comes along.
I am sick and tired of being
told that society, and I because I
am a member of that society,
must accept responsibility for the
behavior of every individual who
goes berserk.
What ever happened to the idea
that some people are born JUST
PLAIN DAMNED MEAN?

Many people today seem to
share the mistaken belief that the
end always justifies the means.
Violence and the violation of
the rights of one person, or a
group of people, in the so-called
pursuit of justice is no virtue.
A single, or a few, individuals
can decide that things are not
going along to suit them, and
wreak havoc with the lives of a
great many people. They say, "all
