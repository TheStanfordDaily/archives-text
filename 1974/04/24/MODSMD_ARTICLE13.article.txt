# Homosexuality And Law

Lawrence Gold

First of all, my
congratulations. The Daily has
finally recognized the existence of
the gay community at Stanford
and deemed our concerns worthy
of news coverage.
The "news" about the
American Psychiatric Association
decision was a bit old, and while
its tardiness smacks somewhat of
tokenism, better late than never.
I have two objections to Bob
Lowe's article (Daily, April). The
first involves his homework, the
second a "quote" he attributes to
me.
Lowe reports that in California
oral and anal sex carry stiff
penalties, and that the laws apply
to "partners of opposite sex as
well as of the same sex." What
Lowe fails to report is that the
Penal Code of which these laws

are a part is currently being
revised.
'Liberalize' Code?
A bill, SB 39, has passed the
California Senate and is presently
before the Assembly's Committee
on Criminal Justice. This bill
would "liberalize" the penal code
by making such sexual acts legal
between heterosexual couples.
However, for gays, they would
still be illegal! In fact, homosexual
acts would constitute a fifth
degree felony, punishable by five
years in jail and/or a $5000 fine.
That, dear editor, is news.
Lowe concludes his article as
follows: "Gold said that sexual
norms are statistics and the APA
change will help people realize
this. 'You will look at yourself as
less of a deviant.' " I told Lowe
that I was using the word
"deviant" in the statistical sense
which has no moral or judgmental

overtones: it refers to a deviation
from a statistical mean.
'Statistically Deviant'
Homosexuals are statistically
deviant in America, the same way
that people with high IQ scores —
including newspaper editors — are.
Lowe's statement that "sexual
norms are statistics" does not
clarify the way in which
"deviant" is used.
Anyone reading the article
would think I referred to
homosexuality as a deviancy in
the common sense of the word.
Nothing could be farther from the
truth.' Gay people are not
deviants. The way Lowe uses the
word betrays a lack of sensitivity
to his subject matter, a sensitivity
which the Daily will hopefully
cultivate as it continues to cover
concerns of the gay community.
