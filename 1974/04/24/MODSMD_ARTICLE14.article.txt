# The 						Second Attica
##

Kathy Brady

In September 1971, Americans
were stunned by the state
massacre of prisoners and hostages
at Attica. For four days 1300
inmates, with 40 guard-hostages,
had negotiated with officials their
demands for basic changes in an
inhuman prison system, demands
which New York Commissioner of
Corrections Russell Oswald called
"100 years overdue."
Then, in the middle of
negotiations, as inmates, hostages
and prison officials were still
calling on Governor Nelson
Rockefeller to come to Attica as
arbitrator, Rockefeller instead
ordered a massive assault force to
retake the prison with guns. State
troopers and guards fired 11,000
rounds into the unarmed crowd,
leaving 29 inmates and 10
hostages dead, and hundreds more
wounded.
In the words of the New York
State Special Commission on
Attica, "the State Police Assault
which ended the four-day prison
uprising was the bloodiest one-day
encounter between Americans
since the Civil War."
The massacre did not have the
desired effect of serving as an
"example" to other inmates
across the country. Instead, Attica
marked the beginning of the rapid
growth of the prison reform and
radical prison movements.
Shocking Brutality
It also left thousands of people
on the outside shocked and
sickened at the brutality of New
York state officials. As Nixon was
congratulating Rockefeller, and
Rockefeller the state troopers, the
national press was revealing that
the widely promoted official story
that inmates had castrated
hostages and slit their throats was
a big lie: all had died from state
fire.
In the midst of "a credibility
crisis of major proportions,"
Rockefeller quickly hand-picked a
special commission headed by
Robert McKay, to "investigate."
The commission did just that:
when it published its report a year
later it laid the responsibility for
the rebellion and deaths on the
officials, troopers, and the prison
system itself.
Rockefeller, angling for the
Republican presidential
nomination, can not afford to
carry the blame for the hideous
events at Attica. He is now using
the well-known government tactic
of absolving one's guilt by
charging the victim, and so has
launched the second Attica
massacre: the massacre in the
courts.
Inmates Indicted
A special grand jury has been
sitting for over two years, handing
down indictments only against
inmates, despite massive evidence
of state crime found in the McKay
Commission report and on film.
Now York has worked up the
largest and most complex criminal
case in American history: so far
60 prisoners have been charged
with 1500 counts in 43 separate
indictments. The prosecution has
so far used over three million tax
dollars, and three million more
have just been allocated.
Government funds to the defense
have consisted of the minimum
$300 legal aid per defendant;
almost all the defendants are
indigent.
Just as inmates and hostages
alike were sacrificed in the yard as
an "example" to other prisoners,
so 60 defendants face heavy
prison terms, many of them life
sentences, as sacrifices to the
"vindication" of Nelson
Rockefeller.
It was only the attention of the
public which stalled the first
massacre for four days, and which
possibly could have prevented it.
The second massacre is long, and
expensive â€” and invisible to most
of the nation. No legal battle will
be won unless there is visible
people's support.
Tonight at TMU 270 from 7-9
p.m., 22-year-old Native American
defendant John Hill will talk
about the rebellion and the
defense, and Cynda Firestone's
award-winning film about Attica
will be shown. Come, and get
informed.
