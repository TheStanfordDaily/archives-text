# Meyer Library Offers Term Paper Service
## 
### GARY SPRAGUE 
Distraught term paper writers
may have found a new ally in the
guise of an old friend. The Meyer
Undergraduate Library is
sponsoring a Term Paper Advisory
Service from 9 a.m. - 10 p.m. this
week to assist students in utilizing
the entire resources of , the
Stanford library system.
The Term Paper Advisory
Service is basically an expanded
use of the reference librarian,
according to Betty Hyslop, one of
five librarians involved in the
Service. Students will receive
concentrated, individualized help
in locating resources for their
papers. The service aims to "try to
give plenty of time personally so
the student gets a good start,"
stated Hyslop.
The Service is aimed primarily
at the student just starting a
paper. Given a specific topic, the
librarian will suggest a wide range
of sources. "By looking at the
whole picture at the start," stated
Pete Johnson, librarian in the
Service, "we can prevent some
false leads and a lot of wasted
time."
The main goal of the Service
will be to introduce students to
the wide range of sources available

in the Stanford library system.
"Very few people really know
where to get help," commented
Hyslop. "Even many grad
students never get past the
Reader's Guide stage."
"Almost every subject has its
own index," added librarian
Janice Lane, citing the Pollution
Abstracts as an example, "but you
have to ask to find them out."
The Service will be located in a
prominent location In Meyer's
second floor lobby. "When you
walk into the library, you won't
be able to miss it," Johnson
smiled.
Five Meyer librarians —
Hyslop, Lane, Johnson, Charles
Chiang and Alice Gadsen —
constitute the Service. Two or
three will be on duty
continuously from 9 a.m. to 10
p.m. Appointments will be
available, allowing a librarian to
research a subject and supply
more comprehensive information.
Although promoted as a four
day "experimental program," the
Service will continue through the
quarter if student response is
favorable. The program will be
evaluated for possible
continuation in the fall.
