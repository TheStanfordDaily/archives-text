# WHERE THE NEGOTIATIONS STAND NOW-AND WHY
## A 						Statement by the University negotiating team 
### 
Collective bargaining is a complex process,
especially the first time around.
Background
In June 1973 United Stanford Employees won a
National Labor Relations Board election to repre
sent 1,400 Stanford technical, service, and main
tenance employees. In so doing it became by far
the largest and most varied bargaining unit on
campus.
USE spent several months canvassing its mem
bers and preparing for negotiations. Even before
formal proposals were exchanged, both sides met
and agreed on several points to assure an orderly
process, namely:
1. The union would present its proposals in
writing at the outset of negotiations. This was done
Nov. 9, 1973.
2. Negotiations would then recess to permit the
University to present a full counter proposal. This
was given to USE Dec. 14, 1973.
3. Thereafter, both sides would meet Mondays
and Thursdays, trying to narrow the areas of dis
agreement as they proceeded through the pro
posals.
4. Each side would have the right to defer any
item, so both could focus on those areas where
they seemed close to agreement. Both would ex
change written, initialed drafts when agreement
was reached.
5. Initialed drafts would remain tentative pend
ing 1) agreement on the entire contract by both
teams, 2) ratification by USE, and 3) approval by
University management.
From mid-December to mid-March, negotiations
were reasonably consistent with these agreed pro
cedures. The pace was somewhat slower than many
had expected. Agreement on specific items was
more difficult to achieve than many had hoped.
But, on the whole, negotiations were frank and
constructive. Significant progress was achieved in
certain areas, particularly job classification policies
and procedures. (There are more than 250 job
classifications in the bargaining unit.)
USE approach changes
In mid-March, USE abruptly changed its ap
proach. Jim Berk, the chief union negotiator,
announced USE wanted to complete the first re
view of the contract by March 28. After that, the
union did not want to meet until it had taken the
University's "final offer' to its membership for
acceptance or rejection.
The University team agreed to try to complete
the first review by March 28. But the University
urged that both sides continue negotiations be
cause many issues remained unresolved. Both sides
agreed there was no impasse. No "final offer" was
made.
USE's rigid adherence to the March 28 time
table made effective negotiations almost impos
sible. For the most part, "bargaining" consisted of
the USE team moving rapidly from one item to the
next, saying: "This is a proposal. What is your
response: Yes or No?"
When the University team agreed to one USE
proposal, making paydays at SLAC conform with
those of the rest of the unit, the union team
promptly changed its proposal to something
wholly different. The University proposed a modi
fied union shop, but there was little apparent
change in the union position.
The pace slows
At the March 28 session, USE agreed to one
more meeting April 1. When we met, again, the
University team urged that regular negotiations
continue. The University was still waiting for the
union to respond to written University proposals
on job classifications, hours and premium pay, and
payroll deduction of union dues, and for USE to
submit new proposals on training and seniority.
At the same time, USE was told the University
team was preparing new proposals for negotiation
on several other issues—pay for time not worked
(such as holidays and sick leave), grievance pro
cedures, contract preamble, working conditions,
union stewards, and union security.

When the USE team suspended negotiations
April 1, they promised to submit a new, written
counterproposal before returning to the bargaining
table.
Despite this promise, no counterproposals were
received by the University prior to the next bar
gaining session April 15-four days after the USE
membership meeting.
At the bargaining table April 15, Berk discussed
those issues the membership felt strongly about.
Some were economic. But others were primarily
non-economic-such as grievance procedures,
mandatory overtime, seniority in layoffs, and
union shop.
Toward the end of this meeting, Berk said USE
was willing to .reduce its proposals for leave with
pay -holidays, vacations, sick leave, etc.-but he
didn't say by how much. Likewise, he indicated
USE was willing to reduce its proposed 33%
average wage increases-but he didn't say what
they'd be. Further, he said USE was willing to
focus on medical or dental and retirement benefits,
dropping its drug plan, legal services, child care
centers, low income housing, and some other pro
posals-but he provided no specifics.
The USE team asked for a formal response to
their verbal proposals as soon as possible.
After a brief caucus, the University team ex
pressed appreciation for this new flexibility. But
the University said it was essential to have specifics
of the new proposals in writing in order to analyze
their cost.
The University team suggested that the April 18
meeting be devoted to resolving as many of the
issues as possible other than wages and benefits.
USE agreed.
The University promised to have (and later
delivered) new proposals on the grievance and
arbitration procedures, which USE had indicated
was one of its big issues. We also promised new
language covering holidays, sick leave, and other
time not worked.
The University asked if USE would respond in
writing to a proposal made in mid-March con
cerning hours and premium, pay, so we could dis
cuss it April 18. Berk replied, "Sure."
But no written proposals were received. On
April 18, Berk denied making this commitment
and refused to discuss the entire subject. He said
the University team would get a new wage scale
proposal April 19. (And it did.)
He then demanded a response to USE's new
economic proposals, even though none of them
was specific or in writing, and even though he had
agreed to discuss other subjects at that particular
session.
When the University team followed the pre
viously agreed agenda, the USE team walked out.
Wages and benefits
The initial USE contract proposal would have
more than doubled the University's costs for wages
and benefits. This included wage increases aver
aging 33% by USE's own estimate, retirement
benefits conservatively estimated at more than 50%
of payroll, two additional weeks of vacation for
employees with more than three years' service, five
more paid holidays, and unlimited sick leave after
the first year of employment, among many others.
The current wage and benefit base for approxi
mately 1400 bargaining unit members is about $15
million, or between $10,000 and $11,000 per per
son.
The University's initial proposal called for
changes which would result in individuals receiving
increases averaging about 6Vi% to 7% in the first
year of the contract.
After the negotiations began, the University
offered additional increases of 5 to 15% to about
160 persons in certain classifications within the
bargaining unit.
The University also offered to establish pre
mium pay of 10 and 15% for night and early
morning work in those areas of the unit where it
was not being paid.
The University team also offered to add one
paid holiday to the present nine—even though the
USE team knew of no other employer who pro
vided as many holidays as they sought.

Repeatedly, the University has indicated that its
proposals on wages and benefits could be im
proved, but that the expense could not be calcu
lated until other cost-related issues were resolved.
Repeatedly, the University team has asked USE to
focus its economic demands on those items it con
sidered most important, so we could do the neces
sary cost analysis while other issues were being
resolved.
Until April 19—one day after the union left the
table-the University had nothing in writing on
which to base such an analysis. Until then, USE
had not moved a cent from its initial proposals on
wages and benefits.
Take the money and run ?
A collective bargaining agreement is much more
than a simple schedule of wages and benefits, as
USE itself has recognized. Such an agreement
covers many important questions, some of which
clearly bear on costs. For example:
* Can faculty, students, or supervisors be per
mitted to do any of the tasks performed by bar
gaining unit members?
* Should employees be paid doubletime for
weekend work, even if this is not done on over
time? Doubletime for working through scheduled
meal periods? Or an additional 10% for any shift
with more than an hour off for lunch?
* Can the University hire a superior candidate
for an opening, when a current employee wants
and is able to do the job, though not as well?
* Who should determine how many employees
are to be employed on a particular project and
with what skills? University management or some
one else?
* When work declines in one area and increases
in another, can the University reassign employees
accordingly?
* How long should the agreement continue?
Through June 1976, as the University proposes, or
until next December, as USE proposes?
To repeat, collective bargaining is complex,
especially the first time around. USE made this
point very well last September, before the formal
negotiations began.
Employees Organize, the USE newspaper,
warned members to avoid "management tricks" in
negotiation, including the strategy of "Take the
Money and Run." Here's what USE said:
"TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN-This com
mon management trick works when union mem
bers do not fully understand the importance of
having all of their working rights and conditions
incorporated into a collective bargaining contract.
"Management starts by refusing to seriously dis
cuss the 'non-cost items' until all 'money items'—
salary and fringe benefits—have been agreed to.
Then they make a salary offer in line with many
union members' expectations, but say they will
withdraw it if we don't drop the other issues and
take it right away.
"So we end up with a slim contract which still
leaves most things up to administration whims. All
USE members must understand that negotiating
our first contract might take quite a while. ..."
The University is committed to an orderly bar
gaining process, on both economic and non
economic issues.
While both sides anticipated a lengthy bargain
ing process, both would benefit from a timely
resolution of the issues.
Although the University and USE have appeared
close to agreement on several items, to date not a
single article of the proposed contract has been
agreed to in its entirety.
That's why the University wants negotiations to
continue. That's why it has repeatedly urged USE
to continue meeting during the past month.
We believe it's hard to resolve issues without
discussing them. We're still prepared to do so at the
bargaining table.
