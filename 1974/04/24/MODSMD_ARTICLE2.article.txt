# More Locks, More Alarms
## Thefts Up Across Campus

Stanford's ivory towers need locks on the doors and
bars on the windows. Stanford may not be Berkeley or
New York, but it is not the crime-free haven it once was.
According to Stanford Police Officer Tom Berubee,
there is no "safest" residence. "Basically, it's about the
same everywhere," he said. "There will be a lot of crime
reports from Wilbur and Branner — then a spurt of theft
will occur on the opposite side of campus."
Berubee cited different campus situations which are
conducive to crime. "Since the residences went coed," he
said, "It has become more difficult to pick out the
unwanted strangers from those students, male or female,
who have just wandered in to locate a friend."
Berubee said students are told to always lock their
doors but, because Stanford is a relaxed academic
community, they often don't. He also claims students
"plan to return to their rooms so quickly that they may
think it's too much trouble to lock up."
Stanford Officer Jack Donals, who prepares and files
university crime reports and statistics, said, "Most thefts
occur during the evening hours at student residences from
nine p.m. to three a.m. But they do happen in daylight
too, especially over vacations."
Specific Combat Methods
The police have specific methods for combatting crime.
Captain William Wullschleger of the Stanford Police
outlined the university patrol system: "We work in two
divisions made up of the peace officers and the
community service officers. The CSO conduct night foot
patrols from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Their basic function is
security — they lock up dorms, radio in any suspicious
occurrences, and keep alert for fire.
"The second patrol division are the peace officers who
receive that title after 400 hours of police training. They

work in automobile units and patrol the campus in three
beats with one patrol car assigned to each."
Even with police patrols, Donals noted that the crime
rate is on the rise, particularly bike thefts. "In 1965, bike
stealing was almost unheard of. Someone might need
transportation to another end of the campus in a hurry
and borrow a bike, but once he reached his destination,
the bike usually was left there.
Ten-Speeds
"With the advent of the ten-speed, bikes started
disappearing permanently. Last year, the value of bikes
stolen on the Stanford campus totaled $46,700.
"The rate of bike recovery varies," Donals continued.
"One week we may make six recoveries, then a whole
month will pass without a single sighting. Of the burglars
caught, nine out of ten have no connection with Stanford
University. Also, the majority are juveniles 15 to 18 years
old."
Priscilla Bates, resident fellow at Roble, lived in New
York City before moving here. 'There I grew used to
locking and dead-bolting doors," she explained. "Thieves
on campus here do not ordinarily stage break-ins — that
would attract too much attention. Instead, they look for
an open room and grab whatever's there. They have no
time to be selective."
Wallets
Wallets are usually the first thing to disappear. Norm
Robinson, director of Row and fraternity housing knows
that too well. "I had just returned from an R.A.
orientation at the start of one year," he recalled. "I left
my wallet on my desk and then went to get my room key.
When I came back, the wallet was gone."
Robinson has been at Stanford since September, 1967.
Since then, he believes, the campus has witnessed a trend
