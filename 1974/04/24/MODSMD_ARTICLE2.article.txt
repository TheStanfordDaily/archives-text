# More Locks, More Alarms
## Thefts Up Across Campus 
### 
By CECILE HEROLD
Stanford's ivory towers need locks on the doors and
bars on the windows. Stanford may not be Berkeley or
New York, but it is not the crime-free haven it once was.
According to Stanford Police Officer Tom Berubee,
there is no "safest" residence. "Basically, it's about the
same everywhere," he said. "There will be a lot of crime
reports from Wilbur and Branner — then a spurt of theft
will occur on the opposite side of campus."
Berubee cited different campus situations which are
conducive to crime. "Since the residences went coed," he
said, "It has become more difficult to pick out the
unwanted strangers from those students, male or female,
who have just wandered in to locate a friend."
Berubee said students are told to always lock their
doors but, because Stanford is a relaxed academic
community, they often don't. He also claims students
"plan to return to their rooms so quickly that they may
think it's too much trouble to lock up."
Stanford Officer Jack Donals, who prepares and files
university crime reports and statistics, said, "Most thefts
occur during the evening hours at student residences from
nine p.m. to three a.m. But they do happen in daylight
too, especially over vacations."
Specific Combat Methods
The police have specific methods for combatting crime.
Captain William Wullschleger of the Stanford Police
outlined the university patrol system: "We work in two
divisions made up of the peace officers and the
community service officers. The CSO conduct night foot
patrols from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Their basic function is
security — they lock up dorms, radio in any suspicious
occurrences, and keep alert for fire.
"The second patrol division are the peace officers who
receive that title after 400 hours of police training. They

work in automobile units and patrol the campus in three
beats with one patrol car assigned to each."
Even with police patrols, Donals noted that the crime
rate is on the rise, particularly bike thefts. "In 1965, bike
stealing was almost unheard of. Someone might need
transportation to another end of the campus in a hurry
and borrow a bike, but once he reached his destination,
the bike usually was left there.
Ten-Speeds
"With the advent of the ten-speed, bikes started
disappearing permanently. Last year, the value of bikes
stolen on the Stanford campus totaled $46,700.
"The rate of bike recovery varies," Donals continued.
"One week we may make six recoveries, then a whole
month will pass without a single sighting. Of the burglars
caught, nine out of ten have no connection with Stanford
University. Also, the majority are juveniles 15 to 18 years
old."
Priscilla Bates, resident fellow at Roble, lived in New
York City before moving here. 'There I grew used to
locking and dead-bolting doors," she explained. "Thieves
on campus here do not ordinarily stage break-ins — that
would attract too much attention. Instead, they look for
an open room and grab whatever's there. They have no
time to be selective."
Wallets
Wallets are usually the first thing to disappear. Norm
Robinson, director of Row and fraternity housing knows
that too well. "I had just returned from an R.A.
orientation at the start of one year," he recalled. "I left
my wallet on my desk and then went to get my room key.
When I came back, the wallet was gone."
Robinson has been at Stanford since September, 1967.
Since then, he believes, the campus has witnessed a trend
toward urbanization, caused partly by the anti-war
demonstrations of the late sixties.
With this urbanization movement, he said, has come an
increasing tendency toward campus crime or at least
awareness of it.
One senior at Roble feels that the Stanford force does
not take enough positive action to deter crime. "I'm not
saying the police don't try," he said, "but that they don't
work effectively enough."
Moving Men Imposters
Karen Robinson, resident assistant at Storey House
said there have been no theft problems this year within
her residence. "Last year when I lived at Roth, though,
there were several incidents. Once a group of imposters
arrived dressed like professional movers, picked up a
couch and a chair, said they were in need of repairs, and
then walked out with them."
One coed fraternity whose members prefer to remain
anonymous have taken security into their own hands. The
outside of the residence is well-lit, especially the bike
rack, which is floodlighted.
The house plans to install timers on these lights. "In
general," said one resident, "our parties are only for
friends — they are not open."
Members have installed an alarm system on their house
stereo, their TV, and some of the individual rooms.
Residents explained that Rob Younge, an electrical
engineering major now living at Roble, was responsible for
the idea of the alarm system.
Nearly Undefeatable System
Younge has since built an intricate alarm system for
Roble's stereo using a unique circuit he believes is hard to
defeat. Actually, this is the second such system Younge
has built for the stereo.

"Last summer a prospective thief tampered with the
turntable," Younge explained. "Police silenced the alarm
by cutting the wires rather than deactivating the system.
When the stereo was stolen,- presumably by the original
thief, the police reimbursed us for the loss."
The different dormitories on campus follow uniform
precautions against crime besides pursuing individual
methods. "No solicitors are permitted in our dorms,
except the Girl Scouts," said Neil Isbrandtsen, director of
the Stern residences. At Toyon, all girls' showers are kept
locked. "But the boys' showers are not. We'll take any
company we can get!" joked one male resident.
Manzanita — Special Problem
Manzanita Trailer Park, accommodating 450 students
in 106 trailers, presents a special problem to security.
Karen Murray, director of Manzanita, explained that,
"Solicitors don't need to worry about being seen in
dormitory halls and questioned. But sometimes people
will knock on doors of individual trailers, asking for
donations or looking for non-existent friends. It's one way
to gain admittance and look around for valuable things to
pick up later."
Two graduate students compare Stanford security to
that of their former colleges. Peter Pesic, Branner Senior
House Associate, said that some schools in the East have
installed peep holes in the doors and lock all entrances as
a precaution against armed robberies which have been
occurring.
David Federbush, a Crothers' resident, said that thefts
were constant in his dorm at Yale. "On Saturday
afternoons during football games, the place would
undergo a raiding. Even the university gates had to be
locked. Crime here is nothing compared to that," he
claimed.
