# Men's, Women's Matches
## Top Volleyball Duels Today 
### PETE BHATIA 
An exciting evening of volleyball is on tap for Stanford fans
tonight at Maples Pavilion. Three matches featuring the Stanfoid
Men's and Women's teams will be played beginning at 4 p.m.
The feature matches begin at 7 p.m. when the women take on
the California State Champion's from the Oakland YWCA.
Stanford has already faced the Oakland club twice this season and
has lost both contests.
The two meetings came during recent tournaments at Los
Angeles and Davis. Down south, the women finished third out of
twelve teams in a tourney won by Oakland.The two teams clashed
in the semis of that meet with Oakland cruising to a relatively
easy win.
In Davis, at the area's regional tournament, Stanford again
played third, behind Oakland and Davis.
The Oakland club is led by Debbie Gellermann, who played on
the United States team this past summer.
Stanford player Barbara Finn called the match tonight "our
Big Game. Oakland is our biggest rival and we'd really like to beat
them at home."
Following the women's match at 8:30 the evening's top match
will feature what Finn called "the top volleyball in California." In
that match, the California and Western Regional Champions from
San Francisco's Olympic Club will face the highly regarded San
Jose YMCA club.
The Olympic Club features former Stanford Ail-American Jim
lams and is fresh off a big tournament victory in Los Angeles
where the club defeated the perennial Southern California power
named the Charthouse.
Admission to the evening session will be $1, which will be used
to aide the Stanford women's team. The team receives no funding
from either the Men's or Women's Athletic Department.
In the afternoon match, Stanford's Men's team takes on highly
touted Cabrillo College. Stanford's team has been depleted by
graduation and by migration of players to the IM courts this
quarter but Stanford player-coach Willie Mannon will still send a
competitive team on the court against Cabrillo.
Mannon said, "Cabrillio is an excellent team, particularly for a
JC. They play the game fundamentally well and we will have to
play a good game to beat them."
Mannon also announced this week that Wilt's Big Dippers will
make a repeat performance at Stanford this Spring.

Maples Pavilion as part or a tripleheader.
An exciting evening of volleyball is on tap for Stanford fans
tonight at Maples Pavilion. Three matches featuring the Stanfoid
Men's and Women's teams will be played beginning at 4 p.m.
The feature matches begin at 7 p.m. when the women take on
the California State Champion's from the Oakland YWCA.
Stanford has already faced the Oakland club twice this season and
has lost both contests.
The two meetings came during recent tournaments at Los
Angeles and Davis. Down south, the women finished third out of
twelve teams in a tourney won by Oakland.The two teams clashed
in the semis of that meet with Oakland cruising to a relatively
easy win.
In Davis, at the area's regional tournament, Stanford again
played third, behind Oakland and Davis.
The Oakland club is led by Debbie Gellermann, who played on
the United States team this past summer.
Stanford player Barbara Finn called the match tonight "our
Big Game. Oakland is our biggest rival and we'd really like to beat
them at home."
Following the women's match at 8:30 the evening's top match
will feature what Finn called "the top volleyball in California." In
that match, the California and Western Regional Champions from
San Francisco's Olympic Club will face the highly regarded San
Jose YMCA club.
The Olympic Club features former Stanford Ail-American Jim
lams and is fresh off a big tournament victory in Los Angeles
where the club defeated the perennial Southern California power
named the Charthouse.
Admission to the evening session will be $1, which will be used
to aide the Stanford women's team. The team receives no funding
from either the Men's or Women's Athletic Department.
In the afternoon match, Stanford's Men's team takes on highly
touted Cabrillo College. Stanford's team has been depleted by
graduation and by migration of players to the IM courts this
quarter but Stanford player-coach Willie Mannon will still send a
competitive team on the court against Cabrillo.
Mannon said, "Cabrillio is an excellent team, particularly for a
JC. They play the game fundamentally well and we will have to
play a good game to beat them."
Mannon also announced this week that Wilt's Big Dippers will
make a repeat performance at Stanford this Spring.
