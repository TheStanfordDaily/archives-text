# Netters Travel To Ojai
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
For the most part, the
Stanford tennis schedule offers
only two kinds of events. The
important ones, such as the league
and national tournaments, and the
unimportant ones, such as the
easy wins over Long Beach State
and Cal Baptist the last two days.
And then there's Ojai.
The Ojai tournament gives
Stanford players a chance to play
the top entries from other

schools, and it also gives them a
vacation in the Southern
California mountains.
So, sometime after lunch
today, Coach Dick Gould will
assemble his stars for the journey
to the tournament, which begins
tomorrow and lasts through
Sunday.
Stanford has won the last two
Thatcher Cups, symbolic of Ojai
supremacy, by one point over
USC and UCLA. Last year, the
Cardinals took and almost blew a

commanding lead, prompting
Dick Gould to say "maybe we
think of it too much as vacation."
Maybe. The real significance of
Ojai is that any of Stanford's six
players can play anyone else by
advancing far enough. And a win
by Nick Saviano or Mark Mitchell
over, say, Cal's Trey Waltke or
USC's John Andrews would be
very impressive.
Stanford's other entrants are
Sandy Mayer, Jim Delaney, John
Whitlinger and Pat DuPre in the
event, which matches the four
Pacific Eight Southern Division
schools. Gene Mayer and Chico
Hagey, both at singles and as a
doubles team, will play in the
concurrent open division.
Back to a couple of those
unimportant matches. Monday,
Stanford downed Long Beach
State 7-2 using its second team.
Hagey, Gene Mayer, Paul Sidone,
Chip Fisher, Craig Johnson and
Tim Noonan all won singles
matches, with only Sidone's and
Fisher's matches going three sets.
In doubles, Hagey-Mayer and
Alex-Cortez-Bill Koran both lost,
while Noonan-Jake Warde won.
Tuesday, Stanford, leading 6-0,
was rained out of the doubles
against Cal Baptist. In this match,
Gene Mayer, Sidone, Fisher,
Johnson, Noonan and Warde
swept to victory without dropping
a set. The two easy wins on the
Varsity Courts brought Stanford's
varsity record to 9-1.
