# Card Stars ‘Benched’ For Rained Out Game
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
If Stanford had played
California yesterday, two of the
top Card hitters, Dave Baker and
Bob Hampton, would have been
sitting on the bench for
disciplinary reasons.
Yesterday's scheduled
non-conference game against Cal
was rained out and rescheduled
for May 7. Efforts were made to
slate the game for today but Cal
was already committed to play
elsewhere.
Stanford head coach, Ray
Young, indicated that the
temporary benching of his star
players was a result of
"unsportsmanlike conduct on the
bench" which included the
throwing of helmets. "They were
letting out their frustrations," said
Young.
Stanford, 3-6 in the Pacific
Eight Southern Division and
14-21 overall, hosts UCLA in a
three-game series at Sunken
Diamond Friday and Saturday.
The Bruins swept three games
from the Cards two weeks ago but
then lost three games to USC last
weekend to drop into a second
place tie with Cal in the division
each with 4-5 records. USC leads
the division with a 7-2 record.
Both losses were to Stanford.
Three Card pitchers were
scheduled for three innings of
work apiece yesterday. They were
Dean Stotz, Bernie Hittner and
John Yandle. "I wanted them to
get some work, preparing for this
weekend," said Young.
Stanford has been rained out
six ties this season which has
caused some minor problems.
"It's hard to say what difference
it would have made if we had
been able to play those games,"
Young said. "I don't think they
would have meant anything,
except for the guys down the line
who haven't played much."
The leading hitter for the
Cardinals in conference play is
now Bruce Robinson, who raised
his average 97 points over the
weekend. His .391 mark displaces
Steve Davis who dropped from
.368 to .286.
The Davis average wasn't the
only mark to fall. Baker dropped
57 points from .292 to .235.
Young blamed losing two of
three games to Cal last weekend
on the failure of his top two
hitters to drive in runs.
'The people that were up with
men on base did not do
anything," he said. "The third
place [Hampton] and fifth place
[Baker] hitters were 0 for 14
Saturday."

Stanford's games against Cal
were thrilling one-run decisions
very characteristic of conference
play so far. The Cards have had
five one-run games, one two-run
contest and one three-run game.
The only one-sided affair was a
6-0 loss to UCLA.

to play many of his players who
haven't seen much action lately in
the junior varsity game against
San Jose State tomorrow....

Fred Bernhardt, as reported

caught by diving rightfielder Bill
Piona to save the game for Cal in

loss.

three-game series at Sunken
Diamond Friday and Saturday.
The Bruins swept three games
from the Cards two weeks ago but
then lost three games to USC last
weekend to drop into a second
place tie with Cal in the division
each with 4-5 records. USC leads
the division with a 7-2 record.
Both losses were to Stanford.
Three Card pitchers were
scheduled for three innings of
work apiece yesterday. They were
Dean Stotz, Bernie Hittner and
John Yandle. "I wanted them to
get some work, preparing for this
weekend," said Young.
Stanford has been rained out
six ties this season which has
caused some minor problems.
"It's hard to say what difference
it would have made if we had
been able to play those games,"
Young said. "I don't think they
would have meant anything,
except for the guys down the line
who haven't played much."
The leading hitter for the
Cardinals in conference play is
now Bruce Robinson, who raised
his average 97 points over the
weekend. His .391 mark displaces
Steve Davis who dropped from
.368 to .286.
The Davis average wasn't the
only mark to fall. Baker dropped
57 points from .292 to .235.
Young blamed losing two of
three games to Cal last weekend
on the failure of his top two
hitters to drive in runs.
'The people that were up with
men on base did not do
anything," he said. "The third
place [Hampton] and fifth place
[Baker] hitters were 0 for 14
Saturday."

Stanford's games against Cal
were thrilling one-run decisions
very characteristic of conference
play so far. The Cards have had
five one-run games, one two-run
contest and one three-run game.
The only one-sided affair was a
6-0 loss to UCLA.

Diamond Notes: Young expects
to play many of his players who
haven't seen much action lately in
the junior varsity game against
San Jose State tomorrow....
Correction: Joe Lamoure, not
Fred Bernhardt, as reported
Monday, hit the line drive that was
caught by diving rightfielder Bill
Piona to save the game for Cal in
the ninth inning of Stanford's 3-2
loss.
If Stanford had played
California yesterday, two of the
top Card hitters, Dave Baker and
Bob Hampton, would have been
sitting on the bench for
disciplinary reasons.
Yesterday's scheduled
non-conference game against Cal
was rained out and rescheduled
for May 7. Efforts were made to
slate the game for today but Cal
was already committed to play
elsewhere.
Stanford head coach, Ray
Young, indicated that the
temporary benching of his star
players was a result of
"unsportsmanlike conduct on the
bench" which included the
throwing of helmets. "They were
letting out their frustrations," said
Young.
