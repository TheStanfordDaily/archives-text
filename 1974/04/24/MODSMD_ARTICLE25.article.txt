# Golf Greats Meet Mediocre At U.S. Intercollegiates Here
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Very early tomorrow morning,
before even the heartiest pre-meds
hop out of bed to review their
notes for their 8 a.m. classes,
several very mediocre golfers will
begin the annual battle against
nature known as the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational golf
tournament.
The early starters, who tee off
at 6:28 a.m., will most likely find
the hazards of the Stanford Golf
Course quite challenging. But the
late starters will have more than
creeks, trees and sand traps to
contend with — they will also be
battling impending darkness.
Last year there simply wasn't
enough daylight to accommodate
a ridiculously large 34-team field,
and five players were stranded on
the course when the sun set. They
trekked out to the 16th hole at
5:30 the next morning to
conclude their opening rounds.
This year there are only 30
teams entered, so the prospects
for the entire field squeezing in 18
holes in broad daylight are slightly
improved. And after the field is
trimmed to the low 16 teams and
ties following Friday's second
round, Saturday's finale should
actually feature some
championship golf.
Change of Venue
By that time U.S. Amateur
champion Craig Stadler of USC
will be boiling. Stadler, who last
week played with the world's
greatest golfers in the Masters at
Augusta, Ga., will probably be less

than thrilled by the opportunity
to knock heads with hackers
representing teams like Cal
State-Dominguez Hills, West
Valley College and Stanislaus
State.
But assuming Stadler doesn't
snap his graphite shaft in disgust,
he'll still be around on Saturday
when the riff-raff is eliminated
and the tournament gets down to
its serious business. And although
he is the odds-on choice to win
the individual title and his USC
team is favored to capture the
team crown, it may not be that
easy.
Planted firmly in Stadler's path
is Stanford's Dave Baskins, who
coach Bud Finger thinks "can
surpass Stadler if he ever shoots a
65 in the stretch." What Finger
means is that his talented junior
has never exploded in the final
round for a tournament victory.
All the shots are there, "but he
just needs the confidence. He's
just that close to being a great
player."
Pac*B Champion
Baskins tied for third at the
Western Intercollegiates 10 days
ago and Saturday he fired an
even-par 71 in a dual match
victory over San Jose State. Last
summer he defeated defending
Pac-8 champion Mark Pfeil of
USC in the second round of the
U.S. Amateur.
Pfeil joined Stadler at the
Masters, giving USC a
disproportionate entry in the elite
field. Both golfers missed the cut,

but their mere presence was
enough to protect USC's position
atop the Golf World national
collegiate rankings.
The Trojans are powerful, but
hardly unbeatable. At the Fresno
State Classic three weeks ago USC
finished fifth, which came as quite
a shock to jovial coach Stan
Wood. One of the teams ahead of
the Trojans was Stanford, and
Finger believes the Cards have the
potential to do it again.
"We definitely have a shot at
it," Finger said. Ironically though,
his main concerns are his only
scholarship player (Aly Trompas)
and last year's U.S. Collegiate
Invitational champion (Conrad
Nilmeier).
Big Question
Trompas has carded Stanford's
worst score in the Cards' last three
events, with Nilmeier not far
ahead. "Our big question really is
how well Trompas and Nilmeier
are going to play," Finger said,
hoping that both golfers can break
out of their recent doldrums in
time for tomorrow's tee-off.
Joining Baskins, Trompas and
Nilmeier in the Stanford lineup
are junior George Pettinger and
freshman Brent Murray and Glen
Goethels.
A third top challenger in the
team field is San Jose State, a
five-time runnerup to five-time
champion Stanford. (The Cards
have won event five times in
its six-year history, losing only to
USC in 1969.)
The Spartans have a solid
six-man contingent, paced by
Aztec Invitational Champion
Mark Lye. Lye triumphed over a
classy field at the Aztec, including
golfers from Florida, USC and
Houston. Another leading
individual contender is defending
NCAA small college champion
Paul Wise of Cal State-Fullerton.

in addition to the varsity.
Cardinal individuals enter the
tournament with the following
competitive averages: Baskins
(74.76), Murray (75.50), Trompas
(75.52), Pettinger (75.57),
Nilmeier (76.66) and Goethels
(77.77).
Very early tomorrow morning,
before even the heartiest pre-meds
hop out of bed to review their
notes for their 8 a.m. classes,
several very mediocre golfers will
begin the annual battle against
nature known as the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational golf
tournament.
The early starters, who tee off
at 6:28 a.m., will most likely find
the hazards of the Stanford Golf
Course quite challenging. But the
late starters will have more than
creeks, trees and sand traps to
contend with — they will also be
battling impending darkness.
Last year there simply wasn't
enough daylight to accommodate
a ridiculously large 34-team field,
and five players were stranded on
the course when the sun set. They
trekked out to the 16th hole at
5:30 the next morning to
conclude their opening rounds.
This year there are only 30
teams entered, so the prospects
for the entire field squeezing in 18
holes in broad daylight are slightly
improved. And after the field is
trimmed to the low 16 teams and
ties following Friday's second
round, Saturday's finale should
actually feature some
championship golf.
Change of Venue
By that time U.S. Amateur
champion Craig Stadler of USC
will be boiling. Stadler, who last
week played with the world's
greatest golfers in the Masters at
Augusta, Ga., will probably be less

than thrilled by the opportunity
to knock heads with hackers
representing teams like Cal
State-Dominguez Hills, West
Valley College and Stanislaus
State.
But assuming Stadler doesn't
snap his graphite shaft in disgust,
he'll still be around on Saturday
when the riff-raff is eliminated
and the tournament gets down to
its serious business. And although
he is the odds-on choice to win
the individual title and his USC
team is favored to capture the
team crown, it may not be that
easy.
Planted firmly in Stadler's path
is Stanford's Dave Baskins, who
coach Bud Finger thinks "can
surpass Stadler if he ever shoots a
65 in the stretch." What Finger
means is that his talented junior
has never exploded in the final
round for a tournament victory.
All the shots are there, "but he
just needs the confidence. He's
just that close to being a great
player."
Pac*B Champion
Baskins tied for third at the
Western Intercollegiates 10 days
ago and Saturday he fired an
even-par 71 in a dual match
victory over San Jose State. Last
summer he defeated defending
Pac-8 champion Mark Pfeil of
USC in the second round of the
U.S. Amateur.
Pfeil joined Stadler at the
Masters, giving USC a
disproportionate entry in the elite
field. Both golfers missed the cut,

but their mere presence was
enough to protect USC's position
atop the Golf World national
collegiate rankings.
The Trojans are powerful, but
hardly unbeatable. At the Fresno
State Classic three weeks ago USC
finished fifth, which came as quite
a shock to jovial coach Stan
Wood. One of the teams ahead of
the Trojans was Stanford, and
Finger believes the Cards have the
potential to do it again.
"We definitely have a shot at
it," Finger said. Ironically though,
his main concerns are his only
scholarship player (Aly Trompas)
and last year's U.S. Collegiate
Invitational champion (Conrad
Nilmeier).
Big Question
Trompas has carded Stanford's
worst score in the Cards' last three
events, with Nilmeier not far
ahead. "Our big question really is
how well Trompas and Nilmeier
are going to play," Finger said,
hoping that both golfers can break
out of their recent doldrums in
time for tomorrow's tee-off.
Joining Baskins, Trompas and
Nilmeier in the Stanford lineup
are junior George Pettinger and
freshman Brent Murray and Glen
Goethels.
A third top challenger in the
team field is San Jose State, a
five-time runnerup to five-time
champion Stanford. (The Cards
have won event five times in
its six-year history, losing only to
USC in 1969.)
The Spartans have a solid
six-man contingent, paced by
Aztec Invitational Champion
Mark Lye. Lye triumphed over a
classy field at the Aztec, including
golfers from Florida, USC and
Houston. Another leading
individual contender is defending
NCAA small college champion
Paul Wise of Cal State-Fullerton.

(1970) and Sandy Adelman
(1968).... Stanford holds the
team tournament record (872 in
1970), while Watson set the
individiual mark with a 212 score
in 1971.... Stanford will enter
junior varsity and freshman teams
in addition to the varsity.
Cardinal individuals enter the
tournament with the following
competitive averages: Baskins
(74.76), Murray (75.50), Trompas
(75.52), Pettinger (75.57),
Nilmeier (76.66) and Goethels
(77.77).
Very early tomorrow morning,
before even the heartiest pre-meds
hop out of bed to review their
notes for their 8 a.m. classes,
several very mediocre golfers will
begin the annual battle against
nature known as the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational golf
tournament.
The early starters, who tee off
at 6:28 a.m., will most likely find
the hazards of the Stanford Golf
Course quite challenging. But the
late starters will have more than
creeks, trees and sand traps to
contend with — they will also be
battling impending darkness.
Last year there simply wasn't
enough daylight to accommodate
a ridiculously large 34-team field,
and five players were stranded on
the course when the sun set. They
trekked out to the 16th hole at
5:30 the next morning to
conclude their opening rounds.
This year there are only 30
teams entered, so the prospects
for the entire field squeezing in 18
holes in broad daylight are slightly
improved. And after the field is
trimmed to the low 16 teams and
ties following Friday's second
round, Saturday's finale should
actually feature some
championship golf.
Change of Venue
By that time U.S. Amateur
champion Craig Stadler of USC
will be boiling. Stadler, who last
week played with the world's
greatest golfers in the Masters at
Augusta, Ga., will probably be less

than thrilled by the opportunity
to knock heads with hackers
representing teams like Cal
State-Dominguez Hills, West
Valley College and Stanislaus
State.
But assuming Stadler doesn't
snap his graphite shaft in disgust,
he'll still be around on Saturday
when the riff-raff is eliminated
and the tournament gets down to
its serious business. And although
he is the odds-on choice to win
the individual title and his USC
team is favored to capture the
team crown, it may not be that
easy.
Planted firmly in Stadler's path
is Stanford's Dave Baskins, who
coach Bud Finger thinks "can
surpass Stadler if he ever shoots a
65 in the stretch." What Finger
means is that his talented junior
has never exploded in the final
round for a tournament victory.
All the shots are there, "but he
just needs the confidence. He's
just that close to being a great
player."
Pac*B Champion
Baskins tied for third at the
Western Intercollegiates 10 days
ago and Saturday he fired an
even-par 71 in a dual match
victory over San Jose State. Last
summer he defeated defending
Pac-8 champion Mark Pfeil of
USC in the second round of the
U.S. Amateur.
Pfeil joined Stadler at the
Masters, giving USC a
disproportionate entry in the elite
field. Both golfers missed the cut,

but their mere presence was
enough to protect USC's position
atop the Golf World national
collegiate rankings.
The Trojans are powerful, but
hardly unbeatable. At the Fresno
State Classic three weeks ago USC
finished fifth, which came as quite
a shock to jovial coach Stan
Wood. One of the teams ahead of
the Trojans was Stanford, and
Finger believes the Cards have the
potential to do it again.
"We definitely have a shot at
it," Finger said. Ironically though,
his main concerns are his only
scholarship player (Aly Trompas)
and last year's U.S. Collegiate
Invitational champion (Conrad
Nilmeier).
Big Question
Trompas has carded Stanford's
worst score in the Cards' last three
events, with Nilmeier not far
ahead. "Our big question really is
how well Trompas and Nilmeier
are going to play," Finger said,
hoping that both golfers can break
out of their recent doldrums in
time for tomorrow's tee-off.
Joining Baskins, Trompas and
Nilmeier in the Stanford lineup
are junior George Pettinger and
freshman Brent Murray and Glen
Goethels.
A third top challenger in the
team field is San Jose State, a
five-time runnerup to five-time
champion Stanford. (The Cards
have won event five times in
its six-year history, losing only to
USC in 1969.)
The Spartans have a solid
six-man contingent, paced by
Aztec Invitational Champion
Mark Lye. Lye triumphed over a
classy field at the Aztec, including
golfers from Florida, USC and
Houston. Another leading
individual contender is defending
NCAA small college champion
Paul Wise of Cal State-Fullerton.
