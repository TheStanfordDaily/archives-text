Panel To Grant Nixon Delay?
WASHINGTON — The Chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee said yesterday he expects the panel to go along
with President Nixon's request for an additional five days
to reply to a subpoena for 42 Watergate tapes.
Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., said he and the
ranking Republican on the committee had agreed to the
postponement and"I am quite confident the members of
the committee will go along."
Rodino told a news conference the matter will be taken
up formally by the committee tomorrow, the day a
response to the committee's subpoena is due.
At the White House, Deputy Press Secretary Gerald L.
Warren attributed the request to "the pressure of business
at the White House and the demands on the President's
time."
Asked about reports that the White House planned to
give the panel transcripts rather than tapes, Rodino replied
"transcripts would not be satisfactory."
Warren would give no clue as to the likely nature of the
eventual reply to the subpoena, saying, "the President has
not finally decided on the form and content of the
response."
Discrimination Case Ruled Moot
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court avoided, at least
for the present, a ruling yesterday on the constitutionality
of "reverse discrimination" to ease the effects of past
wrongs against racial minorities.
The court majority said the case that was to provide a
basis for the ruling is now moot and therefore there would
be no decision on its merits.
The case was being watched for its potential impact on
affirmative action programs to counteract past
discrimination. The issue was raised by a policy favoring
minority students' admission to the University of
Washington Law School.
The case on which the court acted was brought by a
white student, Marco DeFunis, who was initially denied
admission to the law school while a number of minority
students who did not score as high on admission tests were
admitted.
He went to state court but eventually lost. In the
meantime, however, U.S. Supreme Court Justice William 0.
Douglas issued an order which had the effect of keeping
DeFunis in law school.
It is because DeFunis will graduate this spring that the
majority felt his suit no longer represented the real "case or
controversy" that is required for a federal court to act.
Israeli Premier Begins Reform
JERUSALEM — Yitzhak Rabin, the soldier-diplomat
chosen to replace Premier Golda Meir, began the tricky task
of forming a new government for Israel yesterday amid
forecasts that he might fail.
"There is no certainty that a Rabin government will
come about," said the influential newspaper Maariv, hours
after the ruling Labor party elected the former chief of
staff to try to pull bickering political parties together into a
coalition Cabinet.
"The possibility remains ... that Golda's Cabinet will
continue running the state's affairs until new elections are
held," the politically neutral Maariv said.
Other Israeli newspapers praised Rabin, a 52-year old

retired general who served five years as ambassador and
arms negotiator in Washington.
Expert Calls Patty 'Unwilling'
HILLSBOROUGH — A photo analyst said yesterday
photographs indicate that Patricia Hearst was "very much
an unwilling participant" in a Symbionese Liberation Army
bank robbery April 15.
In a letter to the young woman's father, Randolph A.
Hearst, Peter Davies of New York said one picture indicates
Patricia Hearst's right hand was strapped under her coat to
the gun she was shown to be carrying.
Davies said the terrorist SLA, which claims to have
kidnaped her Feb. 4, apparently took precautions to
prevent her from discarding the gun "in a
surrender-or-be-shot situation."
A spokesman at the Hearst mansion here made Davies'
letter public and said it had been delivered to U.S. Dist.
Atty. James L. Browning Jr. Browning made no comment.
Davies urged that the federal grand jury investigating the
bank holdup "consider this pictorial indication that she was
very much an unwilling participant in the crime."
Asked about Davies' ideas, Hearst said only: "He's the
expert." Hearst is editor and president of the San Francisco
Examiner.
707 Crash: No Known Survivors
DENPASAR, Indonesia — Indonesian soldiers worked
yesterday to clear a trail to the remote site where a Pan
American 707 jetliner crashed in jungle terrain. A rescue
team that reached the site found no sign of survivors.
Twenty-six Americans were among the 107 passengers
and crew members aboard the flight which crashed Monday
night, according to Pan Am.
Airport officials here said the pilot did not give any
indication of trouble when he radioed his altitude in his last
message before the crash.
Oil Companies' Earnings Up
NEW YORK — Following the industrywide pattern, the
country's two biggest oil companies announced yesterday
substantial gains in profits for the first three months of
1974.
Exxon Corp., the world's largest, said its earnings were
up 39 percent to $705 million from the $508 million
reported for the same period last year. Texaco Inc. reported
a whopping 123 percent profit rise to $589.4 million,
compared with $264 million tor the first quarter of 1973.
Queried in New York about the latest round of earnings,
John C. Sawhill, the newly appointed administrator of the
Federal Energy Office, said: "The profits and increases are
very large. We will be analyzing them very carefully to see if
price increases have led to increased investment, especially
in drilling and development rather than in marketing."
Sawhill said he wasn't prepared to discuss whether the
profits were "excessive" until he had looked at the figures
more carefully.

an unwilling participant" in a Symbionese Liberation Army
bank robbery April 15.
In a letter to the young woman's father, Randolph A.
Hearst, Peter Davies of New York said one picture indicates
Patricia Hearst's right hand was strapped under her coat to
the gun she was shown to be carrying.
Davies said the terrorist SLA, which claims to have
kidnaped her Feb. 4, apparently took precautions to
prevent her from discarding the gun "in a
surrender-or-be-shot situation."
A spokesman at the Hearst mansion here made Davies'
letter public and said it had been delivered to U.S. Dist.
Atty. James L. Browning Jr. Browning made no comment.
Davies urged that the federal grand jury investigating the
bank holdup "consider this pictorial indication that she was
very much an unwilling participant in the crime."
Asked about Davies' ideas, Hearst said only: "He's the
expert." Hearst is editor and president of the San Francisco
Examiner.
707 Crash: No Known Survivors
DENPASAR, Indonesia — Indonesian soldiers worked
yesterday to clear a trail to the remote site where a Pan
American 707 jetliner crashed in jungle terrain. A rescue
team that reached the site found no sign of survivors.
Twenty-six Americans were among the 107 passengers
and crew members aboard the flight which crashed Monday
night, according to Pan Am.
Airport officials here said the pilot did not give any
indication of trouble when he radioed his altitude in his last
message before the crash.
Oil Companies' Earnings Up
NEW YORK — Following the industrywide pattern, the
country's two biggest oil companies announced yesterday
substantial gains in profits for the first three months of
1974.
Exxon Corp., the world's largest, said its earnings were
up 39 percent to $705 million from the $508 million
reported for the same period last year. Texaco Inc. reported
a whopping 123 percent profit rise to $589.4 million,
compared with $264 million tor the first quarter of 1973.
Queried in New York about the latest round of earnings,
John C. Sawhill, the newly appointed administrator of the
Federal Energy Office, said: "The profits and increases are
very large. We will be analyzing them very carefully to see if
price increases have led to increased investment, especially
in drilling and development rather than in marketing."
Sawhill said he wasn't prepared to discuss whether the
profits were "excessive" until he had looked at the figures
more carefully.
Today's Weather
Showers likely today. Partly cloudy with chance of
showers tonight. Clearing tomorrow. Continued cool. Lows
tonight in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in the mid
50s to mid 60s. West to southwest wind 10 to 20 mph.
Chance of rain 70 percent today, 40 percent tonight.
Panel To Grant Nixon Delay?
WASHINGTON — The Chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee said yesterday he expects the panel to go along
with President Nixon's request for an additional five days
to reply to a subpoena for 42 Watergate tapes.
Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., said he and the
ranking Republican on the committee had agreed to the
postponement and"I am quite confident the members of
the committee will go along."
Rodino told a news conference the matter will be taken
up formally by the committee tomorrow, the day a
response to the committee's subpoena is due.
At the White House, Deputy Press Secretary Gerald L.
Warren attributed the request to "the pressure of business
at the White House and the demands on the President's
time."
Asked about reports that the White House planned to
give the panel transcripts rather than tapes, Rodino replied
"transcripts would not be satisfactory."
Warren would give no clue as to the likely nature of the
eventual reply to the subpoena, saying, "the President has
not finally decided on the form and content of the
response."
Discrimination Case Ruled Moot
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court avoided, at least
for the present, a ruling yesterday on the constitutionality
of "reverse discrimination" to ease the effects of past
wrongs against racial minorities.
The court majority said the case that was to provide a
basis for the ruling is now moot and therefore there would
be no decision on its merits.
The case was being watched for its potential impact on
affirmative action programs to counteract past
discrimination. The issue was raised by a policy favoring
minority students' admission to the University of
Washington Law School.
The case on which the court acted was brought by a
white student, Marco DeFunis, who was initially denied
admission to the law school while a number of minority
students who did not score as high on admission tests were
admitted.
He went to state court but eventually lost. In the
meantime, however, U.S. Supreme Court Justice William 0.
Douglas issued an order which had the effect of keeping
DeFunis in law school.
It is because DeFunis will graduate this spring that the
majority felt his suit no longer represented the real "case or
controversy" that is required for a federal court to act.
Israeli Premier Begins Reform
JERUSALEM — Yitzhak Rabin, the soldier-diplomat
chosen to replace Premier Golda Meir, began the tricky task
of forming a new government for Israel yesterday amid
forecasts that he might fail.
"There is no certainty that a Rabin government will
come about," said the influential newspaper Maariv, hours
after the ruling Labor party elected the former chief of
staff to try to pull bickering political parties together into a
coalition Cabinet.
"The possibility remains ... that Golda's Cabinet will
continue running the state's affairs until new elections are
held," the politically neutral Maariv said.
Other Israeli newspapers praised Rabin, a 52-year old

retired general who served five years as ambassador and
arms negotiator in Washington.

to reply to a subpoena for 42 Watergate tapes.
Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., said he and the
ranking Republican on the committee had agreed to the
postponement and"I am quite confident the members of
the committee will go along."
Rodino told a news conference the matter will be taken
up formally by the committee tomorrow, the day a
response to the committee's subpoena is due.
At the White House, Deputy Press Secretary Gerald L.
Warren attributed the request to "the pressure of business
at the White House and the demands on the President's
time."
Asked about reports that the White House planned to
give the panel transcripts rather than tapes, Rodino replied
"transcripts would not be satisfactory."
Warren would give no clue as to the likely nature of the
eventual reply to the subpoena, saying, "the President has
not finally decided on the form and content of the
response."
Discrimination Case Ruled Moot
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court avoided, at least
for the present, a ruling yesterday on the constitutionality
of "reverse discrimination" to ease the effects of past
wrongs against racial minorities.
The court majority said the case that was to provide a
basis for the ruling is now moot and therefore there would
be no decision on its merits.
The case was being watched for its potential impact on
affirmative action programs to counteract past
discrimination. The issue was raised by a policy favoring
minority students' admission to the University of
Washington Law School.
The case on which the court acted was brought by a
white student, Marco DeFunis, who was initially denied
admission to the law school while a number of minority
students who did not score as high on admission tests were
admitted.
He went to state court but eventually lost. In the
meantime, however, U.S. Supreme Court Justice William 0.
Douglas issued an order which had the effect of keeping
DeFunis in law school.
It is because DeFunis will graduate this spring that the
majority felt his suit no longer represented the real "case or
controversy" that is required for a federal court to act.
Israeli Premier Begins Reform
JERUSALEM — Yitzhak Rabin, the soldier-diplomat
chosen to replace Premier Golda Meir, began the tricky task
of forming a new government for Israel yesterday amid
forecasts that he might fail.
"There is no certainty that a Rabin government will
come about," said the influential newspaper Maariv, hours
after the ruling Labor party elected the former chief of
staff to try to pull bickering political parties together into a
coalition Cabinet.
"The possibility remains ... that Golda's Cabinet will
continue running the state's affairs until new elections are
held," the politically neutral Maariv said.
Other Israeli newspapers praised Rabin, a 52-year old

retired general who served five years as ambassador and
arms negotiator in Washington.
Expert Calls Patty 'Unwilling'
HILLSBOROUGH — A photo analyst said yesterday
photographs indicate that Patricia Hearst was "very much
an unwilling participant" in a Symbionese Liberation Army
bank robbery April 15.
In a letter to the young woman's father, Randolph A.
Hearst, Peter Davies of New York said one picture indicates
Patricia Hearst's right hand was strapped under her coat to
the gun she was shown to be carrying.
Davies said the terrorist SLA, which claims to have
kidnaped her Feb. 4, apparently took precautions to
prevent her from discarding the gun "in a
surrender-or-be-shot situation."
A spokesman at the Hearst mansion here made Davies'
letter public and said it had been delivered to U.S. Dist.
Atty. James L. Browning Jr. Browning made no comment.
Davies urged that the federal grand jury investigating the
bank holdup "consider this pictorial indication that she was
very much an unwilling participant in the crime."
Asked about Davies' ideas, Hearst said only: "He's the
expert." Hearst is editor and president of the San Francisco
Examiner.
707 Crash: No Known Survivors
DENPASAR, Indonesia — Indonesian soldiers worked
yesterday to clear a trail to the remote site where a Pan
American 707 jetliner crashed in jungle terrain. A rescue
team that reached the site found no sign of survivors.
Twenty-six Americans were among the 107 passengers
and crew members aboard the flight which crashed Monday
night, according to Pan Am.
Airport officials here said the pilot did not give any
indication of trouble when he radioed his altitude in his last
message before the crash.
Oil Companies' Earnings Up
NEW YORK — Following the industrywide pattern, the
country's two biggest oil companies announced yesterday
substantial gains in profits for the first three months of
1974.
Exxon Corp., the world's largest, said its earnings were
up 39 percent to $705 million from the $508 million
reported for the same period last year. Texaco Inc. reported
a whopping 123 percent profit rise to $589.4 million,
compared with $264 million tor the first quarter of 1973.
Queried in New York about the latest round of earnings,
John C. Sawhill, the newly appointed administrator of the
Federal Energy Office, said: "The profits and increases are
very large. We will be analyzing them very carefully to see if
price increases have led to increased investment, especially
in drilling and development rather than in marketing."
Sawhill said he wasn't prepared to discuss whether the
profits were "excessive" until he had looked at the figures
more carefully.
