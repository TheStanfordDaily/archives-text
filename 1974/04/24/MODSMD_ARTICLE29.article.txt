# Sheriff's Office Names Murder Case Suspect
## 
### CHRIS TOREM 
Police have identified the target of
their unsuccessful search of an
Escondido Village apartment Monday
night as Ronald Thompson, 30, a San
Jose State student.
According to San Mateo County
Sheriffs Sergeant Maguire, Thompson
has been identified by a number of
witnesses as the man who allegedly
shot and killed 22-year old James
Stamper of East Palo Alto Sunday
night.
Maguire also said that Thompson
has already served one prison term for
armed robbery, but was released about
a year ago.
The police are in the process of
getting a warrant for Thompson's

arrest, but they had no warrant last
night. Under California law, a suspect
in a felony can be arrested on
"probable cause" of involvement.
When the police came to search for
Thompson, they were, by Maguire's
admission, prepared for possible
violence. Witnesses said that several
officers had their guns drawn. Up to
seven cars were lined up in front of the
two-story apartment house or kept
circling the area while a helicopter
patrolled overhead.
The investigators took 45 minutes
to check over the premises. The search
was complicated by the discovery of a
trap door near the roof. Maguire said
that nothing was taken from the
apartment.
