# NAACP Abandons Suit Opposing Frenchman's Terrace Proposal
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
A suit filed last month in federal
court challenging the legality of the
proposed Frenchman's Terrace
housing project has been dropped by
the National Association For the
Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP).
Frenchman's Terrace, a proposed
225 unit project for low and moderate
income residents of the Palo Alto area,
would be financed by federal funds
and managed by the Urban Coalition.
"We dropped the suit after
consultation with the national office
of the NAACP and its local branches,"
explained Nathaniel Colley, the
Sacramento attorney who filed the
suit in the name of the western
regional office of the NAACP.
Colley noted that the Palo Alto
office of the NAACP opposed the suit.
"We have to be certain that the
NAACP has a high degree of unity,"
Colley declared. "Since a large number
of offices opposed the suit, it was
necessary for us to drop it."
Continue Project
"It was felt that we should allow
the project to continue progress and
see if it will benefit the poor as its
developers claim," Colley told the
Daily yesterday.
James Siena, chief counsel for the
University said that he is "very
pleased" that the suit was dropped.
Siena stated that he was surprised
that the NAACP had dropped the suit,
but not as surprised as he had been
upon learning of the suit originally.
Confusion
Siena suggested that the NAACP
suit was filed as a result of confusion
in the western regional office of the
NAACP.
At the time the suit was filed,
Leonard Carter, the director of the
western regiona! office was ill. Tht>
office refused to comment on whether
it approved of the suit. Carter died last
week.

Ira Hall, executive director of the
Midpeninsula Urban Coalition noted
that when he called the western
regional office, he was told no
information was available regarding
the suit.
'Luxury Project'
The action filed last month by the
NAACP called it a "luxury housing
project" that would violate the
National Housing Act which provides
that federal funds should be used only
for low income housing developments.
Only 20 percent of the units in
Frenchman's Terrace would be

allocated to low income people. Forty
percent would be set aside for people
of moderate incomes who would
receive federal subsidies for rents and
mortgages while 40 percent would be
reserved for people who could pay the
full market price for their housing.
Colley had argued that
Frenchman's Terrace would take
money away from projects that should
be helping the poor. "Federal subsidies
were never intended for projects such
as Frenchman's Terrace," Colley told
the Daily early this month.
Colley yesterday refused to

comment upon whether his personal
opinion regarding Frenchman's
Terrace had changed, but he indicated
that his decision to drop the suit was
made only to preserve harmony within
the NAACP.
Hall told the Daily that it was
"eminently sensible" of the NAACP to
drop the suit.
Hall had argued that Frenchman's
Terrace is indeed legal because the
federal government had provided
funds for it only after careful
investigation as to its legality.

Siena stated that he was surprised
that the NAACP had dropped the suit,
but not as surprised as he had been
upon learning of the suit originally.
Confusion
Siena suggested that the NAACP
suit was filed as a result of confusion
in the western regional office of the
NAACP.
At the time the suit was filed,
Leonard Carter, the director of the
western regiona! office was ill. Tht>
office refused to comment on whether
it approved of the suit. Carter died last
week.

Ira Hall, executive director of the
Midpeninsula Urban Coalition noted
that when he called the western
regional office, he was told no
information was available regarding
the suit.
'Luxury Project'
The action filed last month by the
NAACP called it a "luxury housing
project" that would violate the
National Housing Act which provides
that federal funds should be used only
for low income housing developments.
Only 20 percent of the units in
Frenchman's Terrace would be

allocated to low income people. Forty
percent would be set aside for people
of moderate incomes who would
receive federal subsidies for rents and
mortgages while 40 percent would be
reserved for people who could pay the
full market price for their housing.
Colley had argued that
Frenchman's Terrace would take
money away from projects that should
be helping the poor. "Federal subsidies
were never intended for projects such
as Frenchman's Terrace," Colley told
the Daily early this month.
Colley yesterday refused to

comment upon whether his personal
opinion regarding Frenchman's
Terrace had changed, but he indicated
that his decision to drop the suit was
made only to preserve harmony within
the NAACP.
Hall told the Daily that it was
"eminently sensible" of the NAACP to
drop the suit.
Hall had argued that Frenchman's
Terrace is indeed legal because the
federal government had provided
funds for it only after careful
investigation as to its legality.
A suit filed last month in federal
court challenging the legality of the
proposed Frenchman's Terrace
housing project has been dropped by
the National Association For the
Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP).
Frenchman's Terrace, a proposed
225 unit project for low and moderate
income residents of the Palo Alto area,
would be financed by federal funds
and managed by the Urban Coalition.
"We dropped the suit after
consultation with the national office
of the NAACP and its local branches,"
explained Nathaniel Colley, the
Sacramento attorney who filed the
suit in the name of the western
regional office of the NAACP.
Colley noted that the Palo Alto
office of the NAACP opposed the suit.
"We have to be certain that the
NAACP has a high degree of unity,"
Colley declared. "Since a large number
of offices opposed the suit, it was
necessary for us to drop it."
Continue Project
"It was felt that we should allow
the project to continue progress and
see if it will benefit the poor as its
developers claim," Colley told the
Daily yesterday.
James Siena, chief counsel for the
University said that he is "very
pleased" that the suit was dropped.
