# Emeritus Housing Project
## Row Site Decision Delayed 
### DENIS CUFF 
President Lyman's decision whether
the proposed emeritus faculty housing
project should be built on the Row
will be delayed until the middle of
May.
The decision, previously expected
for this month, will be postponed
because of a month delay in a report
by the provost's office reviewing the
project's feasibility. Lyman's decision
will be largely influenced by the
report, according to its two authors,
Edward Shaw, executive assistant to
the Vice President and Provost, and
Robert Summers, director of
faculty-staff housing.
Since plans for the project have
already been approved through official
channels of University committees,
only a presidential order or rejection
of the architectural plans by the
University and the Trustees' land and
building committees would stop the
project from continuing as planned.
Survey Delayed
Two of the central parts of the
report, a survey of faculty to

determine the demand for the project,
and a review of the architectural plans
were delayed, so Shaw and Summers
decided to delay the whole report.
"Lyman's decision should occur
almost simultaneously with the
presentation of our report," Shaw
said.
Summers said he has the data from
the survey now, but the architects will
not present their plans until May 10
and 11.
Shaw said he did not want to
comment on the survey's preliminary
results becuase his evaluation might be
premature. He added that when he and
Summers make their recommendation
to Lyman, "we want to consider all
the factors including demand for the
project, evaluation of alternative sites
and architectural considerations."
400-500 Responses
Shaw said he received between 400
and 500 responses to the survey,
which was mailed to the entire
Academic Council. Half of those
responding would be eligible to live in
the project under present priorities

which assign 65 of the 100 units to
senior and emeritus faculty.
Shaw declined to say what number
of the senior and emeritus faculty
would be necessary to convince him
there was a sufficient demand for the
project.
Former ASSU Vice President Jim
Friend charged that the survey "would
measure the demand for the project,
but not the demand for the project in
relation to other sites."
Shaw said that was not the purpose
of the survey. He said determining the
demand for the project was site-related
â€” "seeing how many people want to
live in a project exclusive of the
demand for a particular site."
Review Data
To evaluate the feasibility of
alternative sites, Shaw said he and
Summers would review the data on
alternative sites that already exists.
"We're drawing a fine line here,"
Shaw said. "On one hand this project
has already passed through the official
channels. We tell alumni and emeriti
we'll have a housing project, then we
tell them we might not have it.
"But questions were raised whether
we had done enough research on
alternative sites and demand, and we
couldn't answer them. We didn't have
the data."
Shaw said his recommendation to
Lyman about the project's fate would
involve value decisions, but that he
wanted to base these judgments on
"irrefutable data."
Row Residents
"We'll consult Row residents before
making our recommendation," Shaw
said. He added that he was not sure
whether he would talk to them
through personal discussions with
individuals or through public meetings.
Friend charged the review would be
biased. "I wish they'd admit they
already decided to put the project on
the Row and they're just searching for
figures to plug the holes in their
arguments."
Friend claimed Shaw and Summers
were correct in saying that putting the
project on another site would raise
rents by 10 percent because of
inflation in building costs. "But they
ought to admit they're putting the
project on the Row because of cost
and economic factors, not other ones
like architecture."
Shaw disagreed with Friend. Shaw
said his report would take into
consideration the need for the project
to blend into the traditional
architecture of the Row.
