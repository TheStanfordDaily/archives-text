# Seek Diversity, New Image
## Dells Reinstated On Campus 
### JOHN FREED 
The number one "jock" fraternity
on campus — Delta Tau Delta — will
return next year with a new image and
outlook among its members, according
to fraternity leaders.
The "Delts," as members of the
fraternity are known, are coming back
after a one-year suspension for
destructive rowdiness.
Brad Williams, president, promised
that the Delts would change their
image.
"I guarantee you, the first guy that
does anything wrong, as far as
intimidation or rowdiness goes, is
out," Williams pledged.
Larry Horton, associate dean of
student affairs, was optimistic about
next year's Delts.

"I think Delta Tau Delta can be a
very good house on campus. The
house has been renovated, it's in a
good location, the alumni are
enthusiastic and the students
themselves are enthusiastic. I honestly
believe the days of old-fashioned
rowdiness . . . associated with
bulliness ... are gone," Horton said.
Williams added that another
positive attribute of the house is their
cook, known by the Delts as "Mr.
Barnes."
"Athletes have been going through
that house for 20 years, and Mr.
Barnes has kept them fed and happy,"
Williams remarked.
Lost Lease
Delta Tau Delta originally lost the
lease on their land for two years after
a series of incidents involving rock and
bottle throwing through windows at
Synergy and Theta Xi Houses and
shooting BB guns at car windows.
The University agreed to reduce the
suspension to one year if certain
conditions were met, including closer
ties to alumni, greater diversity among
house membership and recognition
that similar incidents in the future
could mean permanent suspension of
the fraternity.
"We're not in good standing right
now with the University — the
administration or the students,"
Williams admitted. "They think we're
a bunch of assholes. We're just a bunch
of fun-loving guys who aren't out to
break or destroy everything," Williams
insisted.
Change Membership
Forrie Martin, rush chairman for
the Delts, noted that the fraternity is
making a concerted effort to change
the previous makeup of the
membership.
"We're looking to get 13 to 18
recruits for next year. They're going to
be a very strong force in re-establishing
the fraternity," continued Martin.
"We don't want a pure freshman
dominance [among recruits]. We want
some older guys and some younger
guys. We're also looking for diversity
in backgrounds. This is terribly crucial.
It's a maturing process to
work ... with people who do not have
the same background as you," Martin
explained.
Dramatic Change
Horton said the University wanted
to see a dramatic change in attitudes
of Delts before allowing them back on
campus.

"What we really wanted was to
have the fraternity radically change
their ways. Since [they were
suspended], they have disciplined two
members of the fraternity by expelling
them ... and they have acknowledged
that last year's behavior was
unacceptable," Horton elaborated.
"They have assured us that similar
conduct in the future will not be
tolerated by members of the house.
The alumni leadership has also
reinforced the judgment that there will
be no return to the type of activities
that occurred last year," Horton
concluded.
Respond Immediately
If the Delts do go back to their old
ways, the administration will respond
immediately, according to Horton.
"We have notified them ... that if
such [destructive] activities do occur,
there will be a prompt and
unequivocal response by the
University .... Residence privileges
would be withdrawn, this time perhaps
permanently," Horton warned.
He praised the Delts' move toward
a more varied membership. "I think
diversification ... in their membership
is essential if they're going to survive,"
he commented.
Probation?
Whether the Delts will be on
probation next year is open to
question. Norm Robinson, assistant
dean of student affairs for fraternities
and the Row, reminded Williams that
the group would indeed be on
probation.
"Although Delta Tau Delta will be
permitted [on campus] . . . beginning
in September, 1974, the group will be
on probation for that entire academic
year," Robinson wrote Williams.
Horton said the fraternity will not
be on probation. " 'Probation' implies
a disciplinary action," Horton stated.
"We didn't take that action in the
sense of a disciplinary action, we took
it to ensure that we had living there a
good living group."
"They've come back. They're going
to be looked at much more closely this
year," Horton concluded.

be on probation. " 'Probation' implies
a disciplinary action," Horton stated.
"We didn't take that action in the
sense of a disciplinary action, we took
it to ensure that we had living there a
good living group."
"They've come back. They're going
to be looked at much more closely this
year," Horton concluded.
The number one "jock" fraternity
on campus — Delta Tau Delta — will
return next year with a new image and
outlook among its members, according
to fraternity leaders.
The "Delts," as members of the
fraternity are known, are coming back
after a one-year suspension for
destructive rowdiness.
Brad Williams, president, promised
that the Delts would change their
image.
"I guarantee you, the first guy that
does anything wrong, as far as
intimidation or rowdiness goes, is
out," Williams pledged.
Larry Horton, associate dean of
student affairs, was optimistic about
next year's Delts.

"I think Delta Tau Delta can be a
very good house on campus. The
house has been renovated, it's in a
good location, the alumni are
enthusiastic and the students
themselves are enthusiastic. I honestly
believe the days of old-fashioned
rowdiness . . . associated with
bulliness ... are gone," Horton said.
Williams added that another
positive attribute of the house is their
cook, known by the Delts as "Mr.
Barnes."
"Athletes have been going through
that house for 20 years, and Mr.
Barnes has kept them fed and happy,"
Williams remarked.
Lost Lease
Delta Tau Delta originally lost the
lease on their land for two years after
a series of incidents involving rock and
bottle throwing through windows at
Synergy and Theta Xi Houses and
shooting BB guns at car windows.
The University agreed to reduce the
suspension to one year if certain
conditions were met, including closer
ties to alumni, greater diversity among
house membership and recognition
that similar incidents in the future
could mean permanent suspension of
the fraternity.
"We're not in good standing right
now with the University — the
administration or the students,"
Williams admitted. "They think we're
a bunch of assholes. We're just a bunch
of fun-loving guys who aren't out to
break or destroy everything," Williams
insisted.
Change Membership
Forrie Martin, rush chairman for
the Delts, noted that the fraternity is
making a concerted effort to change
the previous makeup of the
membership.
"We're looking to get 13 to 18
recruits for next year. They're going to
be a very strong force in re-establishing
the fraternity," continued Martin.
"We don't want a pure freshman
dominance [among recruits]. We want
some older guys and some younger
guys. We're also looking for diversity
in backgrounds. This is terribly crucial.
It's a maturing process to
work ... with people who do not have
the same background as you," Martin
explained.
Dramatic Change
Horton said the University wanted
to see a dramatic change in attitudes
of Delts before allowing them back on
campus.

"What we really wanted was to
have the fraternity radically change
their ways. Since [they were
suspended], they have disciplined two
members of the fraternity by expelling
them ... and they have acknowledged
that last year's behavior was
unacceptable," Horton elaborated.
"They have assured us that similar
conduct in the future will not be
tolerated by members of the house.
The alumni leadership has also
reinforced the judgment that there will
be no return to the type of activities
that occurred last year," Horton
concluded.
Respond Immediately
If the Delts do go back to their old
ways, the administration will respond
immediately, according to Horton.
"We have notified them ... that if
such [destructive] activities do occur,
there will be a prompt and
unequivocal response by the
University .... Residence privileges
would be withdrawn, this time perhaps
permanently," Horton warned.
He praised the Delts' move toward
a more varied membership. "I think
diversification ... in their membership
is essential if they're going to survive,"
he commented.
Probation?
Whether the Delts will be on
probation next year is open to
question. Norm Robinson, assistant
dean of student affairs for fraternities
and the Row, reminded Williams that
the group would indeed be on
probation.
"Although Delta Tau Delta will be
permitted [on campus] . . . beginning
in September, 1974, the group will be
on probation for that entire academic
year," Robinson wrote Williams.
Horton said the fraternity will not
be on probation. " 'Probation' implies
a disciplinary action," Horton stated.
"We didn't take that action in the
sense of a disciplinary action, we took

and the Row, reminded Williams that
the group would indeed be on
probation.

be on probation. " 'Probation' implies

to be looked at much more closely this
year," Horton concluded.
