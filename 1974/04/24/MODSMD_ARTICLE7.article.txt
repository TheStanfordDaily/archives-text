## Newman Leaving 
### 
We note with great interest the announcement late last
week that University Relations Director Frank Newman had
been named the new president of the University of Rhode
Island.
We say interest but not surprise, because Newman's
experience and ability make him a natural choice as a
university president.
In August, Newman will become the eighth president of
the three-campus, 22,000-student Rhode Island institution.
He will bring with him seven years of experience as a
Stanford administrator, as well as a national reputation in
education circles.
As head of University Relations here, Newman has not
only supervised the University's public image, but has also
handled its relations with the various local, state and federal
governmental agencies — experience which should prove
valuable in taking over a public institution. In
addition, he boasts another plus in dealing with elected
officials: he himself is a former political candidate (he ran
against Rep. Jerome Waldie, D—Antioch, several years ago).
Newman earned a national name for himself through his
cogent criticisms of higher education, particularly through
his work as head of a Health, Education and Welfare task
force.
In that HEW report, Newman criticized what he termed
"massive inertia" in the academic world. Knowing
Newman's wit, intelligence, ability and dedication as we do,
we think he will prove himself exempt from that criticism.
We wish him well with his new post, and expect to hear
much more from him in the future.
