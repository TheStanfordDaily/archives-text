Barton Stalling
Editor:
Before last Thursday's
negotiating session, I did not agree
that University negotiator Douglas
Barton was stalling. I thought it
made sense when Barton said he
needed our priorities in order to
respond to our demands.
So we had our balloting, we
established priorities and these
were given to Barton on April 15.
On April 18 Barton made no
mention of this at all. He acted as
though we had never had a break
and a membership meeting. He
came on in the same nit-picking
way he has been doing right along.
My feeling is that common
courtesy called for some kind of
response — even if it was only to
say they were working on it and
needed more time to evaluate.
It seems that this great
prestigious institute of higher
learning is concerned only with
economic, rather than human
values. Our steadily decreasing
buying power does not seem to
mean anything.
If it does, why don't they talk
about it? Why don't they let us
know that they care about their
laborers as well as their faculty
and administrators? How can
Stanford take pride in anything
when some of their full time
workers are eligible for Food
Stamps?
Barton should be made well
aware that when he is dealing with
our team, he is dealing with all of
us. Maybe he will hear better and
respond more promptly and
meaningfully if he knows our
team is sitting on a strike vote.
Let's get it on!

There was a time when I used
to wonder what set of values it
would take to produce a Palo Alto
Times or San Francisco Chronicle,
but now that I have a clearer idea
about that, I am wondering what
the "qualifications" of the Daily's

editorial board were in deciding
that the proposed ASSU Guest
Professor was not well qualified
for the job (editorial, April 16).
I also suppose that the "large
sum of money" that went to
KZSU to boost its power was well
"justified," because the Daily had
learned through a secretary in the
FCC that the power increase will
be permitted.
Similarly, the proposed money
for the Band to perform "all
across the country," boosting the
Daily's pride, is well worth it,
while using dorm funds feeding
the starving people in the Sahel is
"illegal."
The Daily would be better off
if it stuck to its more traditional
stories on cadavers, streaking, and
the Hearst case, in which it is
indeed well qualified.
I don't think you would
normally publish such a letter as
this, but I would like you to know
that if you really represent the
mentalities and values of the
young people, then I feel very sad
for those who will have to read
the Times and the Chronicle in 20
years.

As a supporter of the Herman
slate in the recent ASSU elections,
I feel insulted by 800 Bacon's
explanation of his loss, given in
the April 19 Daily. Bacon refuses
to accept the fact that the
students felt that the Herman
slate tfould do more for all,
branding those of us who voted
for Herman as complacent and
reactionary.
Possibly this was just an
overreaction to the news of his
loss, but he should have either
accepted his defeat more
gracefully, or not gone on record
with an opinion such as that.
I feel that an apology is due to
all those of us who are neither
complacent nor reactionary, but
nevertheless voted for Herman.

The Daily would be better off
if it stuck to its more traditional
stories on cadavers, streaking, and
the Hearst case, in which it is
indeed well qualified.
I don't think you would
normally publish such a letter as
this, but I would like you to know
that if you really represent the
mentalities and values of the
young people, then I feel very sad
for those who will have to read
the Times and the Chronicle in 20
years.

As a supporter of the Herman
slate in the recent ASSU elections,
I feel insulted by 800 Bacon's
explanation of his loss, given in
the April 19 Daily. Bacon refuses
to accept the fact that the
students felt that the Herman
slate tfould do more for all,
branding those of us who voted
for Herman as complacent and
reactionary.
Possibly this was just an
overreaction to the news of his
loss, but he should have either
accepted his defeat more
gracefully, or not gone on record
with an opinion such as that.
I feel that an apology is due to
all those of us who are neither
complacent nor reactionary, but
nevertheless voted for Herman.

Barton Stalling
Editor:
Before last Thursday's
negotiating session, I did not agree
that University negotiator Douglas
Barton was stalling. I thought it
made sense when Barton said he
needed our priorities in order to
respond to our demands.
So we had our balloting, we
established priorities and these
were given to Barton on April 15.
On April 18 Barton made no
mention of this at all. He acted as
though we had never had a break
and a membership meeting. He
came on in the same nit-picking
way he has been doing right along.
My feeling is that common
courtesy called for some kind of
response — even if it was only to
say they were working on it and
needed more time to evaluate.
It seems that this great
prestigious institute of higher
learning is concerned only with
economic, rather than human
values. Our steadily decreasing
buying power does not seem to
mean anything.
If it does, why don't they talk
about it? Why don't they let us
know that they care about their
laborers as well as their faculty
and administrators? How can
Stanford take pride in anything
when some of their full time
workers are eligible for Food
Stamps?
Barton should be made well
aware that when he is dealing with
our team, he is dealing with all of
us. Maybe he will hear better and
respond more promptly and
meaningfully if he knows our
team is sitting on a strike vote.
Let's get it on!

There was a time when I used
to wonder what set of values it
would take to produce a Palo Alto
Times or San Francisco Chronicle,
but now that I have a clearer idea
about that, I am wondering what
the "qualifications" of the Daily's

editorial board were in deciding
that the proposed ASSU Guest
Professor was not well qualified
for the job (editorial, April 16).
I also suppose that the "large
sum of money" that went to
KZSU to boost its power was well
"justified," because the Daily had
learned through a secretary in the
FCC that the power increase will
be permitted.
Similarly, the proposed money
for the Band to perform "all
across the country," boosting the
Daily's pride, is well worth it,
while using dorm funds feeding
the starving people in the Sahel is
"illegal."
The Daily would be better off
if it stuck to its more traditional
