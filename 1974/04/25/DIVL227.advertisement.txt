REPORT ON STUDENT DISCIPLINARY ACTION
DOSA, Case No. 31, December 1973, Honor code
The University Administration filed charges for a
violation of the Honor Code against three students. The
students asked the Dean of Student Affairs to hear the
case, and the dean agreed to do so.
On a midterm examination one student gave aid; one
student received and gave aid; and one student received
aid. The Dean of Students Affairs recommended that all
three students be denied credit for the course in which
the violation occurred and that the student who initially
gave the aid provide approximately forty hours of tutor
ing time. These recommendations were approved by the
President of the University.
One student appealed the decision as to the recom
mended penalty, asserting (1) that students from foreign
countries ought to be treated differently from American
students because of an unfamiliarity with the rules, and
(2) that he was involved in extra curricular activities of
benefit to the school.
To the first claim the President responded that stu
dents, American or foreign, who accept the benefits of a
Stanford education must at the same time accept the
responsibilities that go with being a Stanford student. To
the second claim the President responded that in en
forcing such sanctions the University does not discrimi
nate in favor of those who are active in extra curricular
activities or against those who are not.
The President further observed that although the
ordinary sanction for an Honor Code violation is loss of
academic credit for the course involved and suspension
for a period of time, the dean had already mitigated the
penalty due to certain compelling circumstances and
that no evidence was presented on appeal which would
warrant further mitigation.
