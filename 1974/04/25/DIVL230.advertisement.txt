-the film that ran for 3 continuous years in one theatre in Cambridge, Mass. fIH
In an isolated surreal pocket of World War I, the British send Alan Bates into a highly unlikely, tiny French town to discover \:/|j j flf
a bomb. The townspeople have lied and the inmates of the local asylum have taken their place. The resulting interaction gives J-M JjW
us some of the most enchanting sequences on film. When the reality of the returning armies breaks the bubble and the inmates Jj|&
have returned to the asylum, we can really share Bates' confusion about which people are really insane. In our opinion, KING
OF HEARTS is a rare treat; funny and sad at the same time. Past audiences will vouch for this, and we know you will too. \sgw
