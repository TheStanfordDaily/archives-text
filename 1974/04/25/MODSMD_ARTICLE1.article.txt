SAN FRANCISCO - The
Zebra killings, which have claimed 12
white persons in the last six months,
are not over, San Francisco's chief
police inspector warned in federal
court yesterday.
The prediction came during
testimony at a hearing on two lawsuits
to halt the stopping of hundreds of
black men in an effort to track down
the random street killer.
One suit was filed by the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People on behalf of five
individuals seeking an injunction
against the searches. The second suit,
filed by the American Civil Liberties
Union, asked that the procedure be
declared unconstitutional.
Stanford Law Professor Anthony
Amsterdam was among those working
on the ACLU's presentation.
Loyle Johnston, ACLU counsel for
the plaintiff, told the Daily that the
court concluded its hearing of
testimony at 5:30 p.m. Oral arguments
will be heard this morning.
Johnston Hopeful
Johnston, while hopeful of an early
decision, declined to say when he
thought U.S. District Court Judge
Alfonso Zirpoli would rule. 'There's
no telling, Johnston said. "The judge
may want to think about it."
Zirpoli gave no immediate
indication of when he might issue a
ruling.
Zirpoli asked Chief of Inspectors
Charles Barca if he felt the killings and
attempted killing were over.
"I think it will continue," said
Barca. "There is nothing more urgent
in the annals of the police
department" than to catch the killer
or killers who strike without warning.
Barca told the judge he thought
police have stopped "just about
everyone fitting the profile" of a
composite drawing made by a police
artist from descriptions from two of
the six survivors of Zebra shootings.

PIRGED — Jack Handy (teft) and Mark Weitzel, organizers of the Stanford
chapter of Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), suffered a setback yesterday
when Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale Snape said the University would not
collect funds for PIRG if over 50 percent of the money were given to the group's
Northern California headquarters (Nor-Cal PIRG).
