# Killings May Continue, Police Warn

SAN FRANCISCO - The
Zebra killings, which have claimed 12
white persons in the last six months,
are not over, San Francisco's chief
police inspector warned in federal
court yesterday.
The prediction came during
testimony at a hearing on two lawsuits
to halt the stopping of hundreds of
black men in an effort to track down
the random street killer.
One suit was filed by the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People on behalf of five
individuals seeking an injunction
against the searches. The second suit,
filed by the American Civil Liberties
Union, asked that the procedure be
declared unconstitutional.
Stanford Law Professor Anthony
Amsterdam was among those working
on the ACLU's presentation.
Loyle Johnston, ACLU counsel for
the plaintiff, told the Daily that the
court concluded its hearing of
testimony at 5:30 p.m. Oral arguments
will be heard this morning.
Johnston Hopeful
Johnston, while hopeful of an early
decision, declined to say when he
thought U.S. District Court Judge
Alfonso Zirpoli would rule. 'There's
no telling, Johnston said. "The judge
may want to think about it."
Zirpoli gave no immediate
indication of when he might issue a
ruling.
Zirpoli asked Chief of Inspectors
Charles Barca if he felt the killings and
attempted killing were over.
"I think it will continue," said
Barca. "There is nothing more urgent
in the annals of the police
department" than to catch the killer
or killers who strike without warning.
Barca told the judge he thought
police have stopped "just about
everyone fitting the profile" of a
composite drawing made by a police
artist from descriptions from two of
the six survivors of Zebra shootings.

PIRGED — Jack Handy (teft) and Mark Weitzel, organizers of the Stanford
chapter of Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), suffered a setback yesterday
when Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale Snape said the University would not
collect funds for PIRG if over 50 percent of the money were given to the group's
Northern California headquarters (Nor-Cal PIRG).
"But how do we know he won't
come up from the underground?"
Barca asked rhetorically?
Earlier, Barca testified that the
controversial stop-and-search tactic
"appears to be unproductive and
ineffective" and he promised that
further stops would be modified and
more selective.
A civil rights lawyer called the stops
"A wholesale violation of every black
man's rights."
Barca said the new Zebra order was
approved by Police Chief Donald Scott
Tuesday night. Barca at first hesitated
to disclose the modifications in court
for fear it would hamper the
investigation.
NAACP attorney Anthony Colley
called the shakedown "clearly a
dragnet operation against a substantial
proportion of the black male
population in San Francisco."
"By admission the police are
engaged in a wholesale violation of
every black male's rights if he happens
to be what they think fits the
description of the Zebra killer," he
said.
Colley said one man stopped by
police and issued a field interrogation
card was 59 years old and weighed 255
pounds. Colley noted the police
profile of the Zebra killer describes a
man 20 to 30 years old with a medium
or slender build.
Chief Scott told the court police
instituted Zebra check cards to "lessen
the probability of people being
offended in this type of operation."
He differentiated between check
cards and the field interrogation cards.
He said check cards are issued to
persons who ask for them so they will
not be picked up again.

But if police think more
questioning is necessary, a field
interrogation card is filled out and
turned over to the homicide
department.
Cards Destroyed
Scott said cards would be destroyed
when they no longer were useful in the
Zebra hunt, but said the information
could bp used to help solve other
crimes.
Mayor Joseph L. Alioto, who was
spat upon and hit with a placard by
pickets protesting the procedure
earlier this week, has vowed the city
will abide by the court ruling.
He said the police questioning has
been used before and only involves
stopping black men who resemble a
composite sketch of a Zebra killer.
"The court can't allocate police
power, but it certainly can stop us
from doing something that transcends
the bounds of the Constitution,"
Alioto said. "We will obey the
rulings."
Police said 565 black men have
been stopped and questioned by
officers who believe they resembled
the sketch drawn from descriptions by
witnesses.
The Zebra killer or killers have
murdered 12 persons and wounded six
in apparently random street attacks
since Nov. 25. The police operation is
code named "Zebra" after the "Z"
radio channel assigned by police.
