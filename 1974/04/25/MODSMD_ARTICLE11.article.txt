At about the same time as many of the
revelations of the Watergate case concerning
wiretapping and harassment of Nixon's
political opposition among liberals,
Democrats and journalists, came news
revelations about the U.S. government's
long-time persecution of members of the
Socialist Workers Party.
But in the inundation of news about
Watergate, it is only too likely that the
significance of the Socialist Workers Party
case will be neglected. The experience of this
minority political party shows what can
happen to a group which presents a radical
political alternative to the public.
In February 1973, Lori Paton, a
16-year-old student at West Morris-Meadham
High School in New Jersey, wrote a letter to
the Socialist Workers Party to get
information for a school social studies project.
The government's Federal Bureau of
Investigation obtained her name from its
"mail cover" of the party's national office.
Mail covers are a method the government
uses to interfere with the right of free speecn
in communications delivered by messenger.
Through cooperation with the government
postal monopoly, the police intercept mail
and take down the sender's name and
address. Sometimes the mail is surreptitiously
opened as well.
'Subversive' File Opened
In 1973, the FBI had a mail cover on all
first class mail delivered to the party's
address. Having obtained Paton's name and
address, a criminal investigation was begun
on her and a "subversive" file was opened on
her.
As a result, Paton filed a suit to force the
FBI to expunge her name from its records
and to pay $65,000 in damages.
The suit was termed a class action as well,

representing "all American citizens who wish
to exercise their rights under the First
Amendment to engage in lawful
correspondence with minority political
parties without being the objects of covert
and overt surveillance and interception of
their mail."
Surveillance Acknowledged
Only a short while before the filing of the
Paton suit, the government acknowledged
that it had conducted "electronic
surveillance" of Socialist Workers Party
members from 1945 to 1963 and that the
FBI had a program to disrupt the party from
1967 to 1969.
A page of FBI internal discussion of its
plans to sabotage the activities of the
Socialist Workers Party turned up in material
released to NBC reporter Carl Stern as a
result of a lawsuit under the Freedom of
Information Act.
This 1961 in-house FBI memorandum
said: "The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) has,
over the past several years, been openly
espousing its line on a local and national basis
through running candidates for political
office and strongly directing and/or
supporting such causes as Castro's Cuba and
integration problems in the South.
Trotskyist Contacts
"The SWP has also been in frequent
contact with international Trotskyist groups
stopping short of open and direct contact
with these groups. .. .
"Offices receiving copies of this letter are
participating in the Bureau's Communist
Party, USA Counterintelligence Program. It is
felt that a disruption program along similar
lines could be initiated against the SWP on a
very selective basis. ... Only carefully
thought-out operations with the widest
possible effects and benefit to the nation

could be submitted."
William Sullivan, a former assistant to FBI
director J. Edgar Hoover initiated the
program in the early 19605. Sullivan was
once head of the FBl's internal security
division. In the first Nixon administration, he
was the White House's man in the FBI.
Handled NSC Wiretaps
During the hearings of the Ervin
committee, witnesses declared that Sullivan
handled the wiretapping of National Security
Council aides and supervised early FBI
operations in the case of Daniel Ellsberg.
The party filed its complaint against the
disruption program and related government
activities in July 1963. In replying to the
suit, the government admitted that its
disruption plan was an effort to "neutralize"
the party.
But the government refused to release the
documents it holds on the disruption
program on the grounds that its internal
papers are confidential and that the
documents are protected by "executive
privilege."
No Right of Privacy
Despite the pretended analogies drawn by
government officials, such officials have no
right of privacy like that of private persons.
The public has a right to know everything
about the activities of government officials,
for the memhers of the public have been
supporting these officials via taxes.
In suing the government the party is
seeking $27.3 million in damages for
examining mail, wiretapping, harassment,
and other activities. Most importantly, the
suit seeks a permanent injunction to halt all
such action by government agencies in the
future against the Socialist Workers Party and
those in similar circumstances.
