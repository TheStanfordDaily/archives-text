Editor:
I am a politically independent
resident of Menlo Park who
enjoys the rich cultural life of
events on the Stanford Campus
open to the public.
Last Friday night I heard the
most intelligent discussion of the
energy crisis. Its breadth and
depth exceeded anything I had
previously read and heard. The
meeting was under the auspices of
the Conservative Forum. As has
been the case at all the meetings
of this group, there was a genuine
confrontation of views. Mayor
Alioto and Dr. Lederberg were
excellent in their critical role, as
were Professors Inkeles, Kennedy
and Hook in their response to Dr.
Will Herberg at a previous
meeting.
What I find astonishing and
hard to explain is that during the
last two years it has been only at
the meetings of the Conservative
Forum that a genuine intellectual
give and take occurs.
The meetings of liberal and
especially radical groups are
uniformly one-sided in their
presentation. At the Marcuse
meeting I would have loved to
hear some incisive, critical mind
take his views apart. Although I
am a woman's liberation
sympathizer myself, I find their
meetings on campus depressing, as
are those of the prison reform and
left-wing civil rights groups,
because the audience is offered
mere propaganda which becomes
tedious in the absence of
intelligent criticism.
Even the questions are boring

because no one challenges the
speakers. Why is it that only the
Conservative Forum these days
does not fear debate and offers
intellectually exciting fare? In the
past this was the frustration of
liberal groups.
Whatever the answer, I, for
one, am grateful for the meetings
held under the auspices of the
Conservative Forum, and look
forward in the future, on my
return, to attending more of
them.

'Lesser Miracle'
Editor:
Chalk up one "lesser miracle."
That was the term Berkeley City
Councilwoman Ying Lee Kelley
used to describe the approval by
students of the referendum to
invite Nguyen Huu Thai here as
ASSU Guest Professor. With that
accomplished, in Ying's words
"we must still wait for the greater
miracle of Thieu's government
releasing him."
Participating in a miracle was
very gratifying, and I'd like to
thank publicly all the people who
hoped and helped to bring it
about. I wish that worn-out,
cynical former activists could have
experienced the care and
enthusiasm which attracted
several new people to the
campaign each day.
In the end, over 80 people
worked on the campaign, and the
Thai referendum was passed by a
63 percent majority. The victory
was very heartening to those of us
who still believe that students can

do something positive and very
significant, even when the tenor
of the times is seemingly to avoid
so-called "exterior" concerns.
The successful events here have
encouraged Kelley to go to the
Associated Students of the
University of California at
Berkeley and urge them to adopt
a South Vietnamese political
prisoner, as we have done. Their
student senate has already passed
a resoltuion deploring the
treatment of imprisoned medical
student Huynh Tan Mam, calling
for his release, and demanding
that the Paris Peace Accords be
implemented.
American advisors and dollars
are still covertly supporting war
and political repression in
Vietnam, but it appears that the
American people and Congress are
closer than ever to enforcing a real
American disengagement.
The recent events at Stanford
and continuing student action will
prove to be very significant in the
united campaign to implement the
Peace Accords and ensure a lasting
peace in Vietnam.
And now for the greater
miracle.. . .

Concerning the article titled
"Sex counseling at Cowell" in the
April 18 Daily, there are several
additions and corrections to be
made in order to realistically
describe the program.
The two ideas behind the peer

counseling on contraceptives are:
1) to enable Cowell to offer
contraceptive counseling to
students who, for any number of
reasons, prefer discussing the
subject with peers; and 2) to
encourage and facilitate couple
participation in the discussion,
choice, and responsibility of a
birth control method.
At the same time we are
prepared to make referrals to
professionals for sexuality and
abortion counseling and referrals
to peers for raps on
homosexuality. We are not
qualified to do sexuality
counseling and do not wish to give
that impression.
An additional hope of the
counselors is to decrease the wait
for contraceptives by opening up
the hours normally spent in
contraceptive consultations for
pelvic examinations and the
writing of the prescription for the
method. Next fall we plan to have
an "out-reach" program, taking
open discussion of contraceptives
into the dormitories.
Finally, the project is an effort
of the Task Force on Women's
Health Care at Stanford and has
no formal relation to the Student
Advisory Committee to Cowell.
We hope this letter will clear
up misleading statements in the
article. We are open on a drop-in
basis every weekday 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. and schedule appointments
in the afternoon. Please drop by if
there are any questions.

I am a politically independent
resident of Menlo Park who
enjoys the rich cultural life of
events on the Stanford Campus
open to the public.
Last Friday night I heard the
most intelligent discussion of the
energy crisis. Its breadth and
depth exceeded anything I had
previously read and heard. The
meeting was under the auspices of
the Conservative Forum. As has
been the case at all the meetings
of this group, there was a genuine
confrontation of views. Mayor
Alioto and Dr. Lederberg were
excellent in their critical role, as
were Professors Inkeles, Kennedy
and Hook in their response to Dr.
Will Herberg at a previous
meeting.
What I find astonishing and
hard to explain is that during the
last two years it has been only at
the meetings of the Conservative
Forum that a genuine intellectual
give and take occurs.
The meetings of liberal and
especially radical groups are
uniformly one-sided in their
presentation. At the Marcuse
meeting I would have loved to
hear some incisive, critical mind
take his views apart. Although I
am a woman's liberation
sympathizer myself, I find their
meetings on campus depressing, as
are those of the prison reform and
left-wing civil rights groups,
because the audience is offered
mere propaganda which becomes
tedious in the absence of
intelligent criticism.
Even the questions are boring

because no one challenges the
speakers. Why is it that only the
Conservative Forum these days
does not fear debate and offers
intellectually exciting fare? In the
past this was the frustration of
liberal groups.
Whatever the answer, I, for
one, am grateful for the meetings
held under the auspices of the
Conservative Forum, and look
forward in the future, on my
return, to attending more of
them.

Chalk up one "lesser miracle."
That was the term Berkeley City
Councilwoman Ying Lee Kelley
used to describe the approval by
students of the referendum to
invite Nguyen Huu Thai here as
ASSU Guest Professor. With that
accomplished, in Ying's words
"we must still wait for the greater
miracle of Thieu's government
releasing him."
Participating in a miracle was
very gratifying, and I'd like to
thank publicly all the people who
hoped and helped to bring it
about. I wish that worn-out,
cynical former activists could have
experienced the care and
enthusiasm which attracted
several new people to the
campaign each day.
In the end, over 80 people
worked on the campaign, and the
Thai referendum was passed by a
63 percent majority. The victory
was very heartening to those of us
who still believe that students can

do something positive and very
significant, even when the tenor
of the times is seemingly to avoid
so-called "exterior" concerns.
The successful events here have
encouraged Kelley to go to the
Associated Students of the
University of California at
Berkeley and urge them to adopt
a South Vietnamese political
prisoner, as we have done. Their
student senate has already passed
a resoltuion deploring the
treatment of imprisoned medical
student Huynh Tan Mam, calling
for his release, and demanding
that the Paris Peace Accords be
implemented.
American advisors and dollars
are still covertly supporting war
and political repression in
Vietnam, but it appears that the
American people and Congress are
closer than ever to enforcing a real
American disengagement.
The recent events at Stanford
and continuing student action will
prove to be very significant in the
united campaign to implement the
Peace Accords and ensure a lasting
peace in Vietnam.
And now for the greater
miracle.. . .

Concerning the article titled
"Sex counseling at Cowell" in the
April 18 Daily, there are several
additions and corrections to be
made in order to realistically
describe the program.
The two ideas behind the peer

counseling on contraceptives are:
1) to enable Cowell to offer
contraceptive counseling to
students who, for any number of
reasons, prefer discussing the
subject with peers; and 2) to
encourage and facilitate couple
participation in the discussion,
choice, and responsibility of a
birth control method.
At the same time we are
prepared to make referrals to
professionals for sexuality and
abortion counseling and referrals
to peers for raps on
homosexuality. We are not
qualified to do sexuality
counseling and do not wish to give
that impression.
An additional hope of the
counselors is to decrease the wait
for contraceptives by opening up
the hours normally spent in
contraceptive consultations for
pelvic examinations and the
writing of the prescription for the
method. Next fall we plan to have
an "out-reach" program, taking
open discussion of contraceptives
into the dormitories.
Finally, the project is an effort
of the Task Force on Women's

professionals for sexuality and
abortion counseling and referrals
to peers for raps on
homosexuality. We are not
qualified to do sexuality
counseling and do not wish to give
that impression.
An additional hope of the
counselors is to decrease the wait
for contraceptives by opening up
the hours normally spent in
contraceptive consultations for
pelvic examinations and the
writing of the prescription for the
method. Next fall we plan to have
an "out-reach" program, taking
open discussion of contraceptives
into the dormitories.
Finally, the project is an effort
of the Task Force on Women's
Health Care at Stanford and has
no formal relation to the Student
Advisory Committee to Cowell.
We hope this letter will clear
up misleading statements in the
article. We are open on a drop-in
basis every weekday 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. and schedule appointments
in the afternoon. Please drop by if
there are any questions.

I am a politically independent
resident of Menlo Park who
enjoys the rich cultural life of
events on the Stanford Campus
open to the public.
Last Friday night I heard the
most intelligent discussion of the
energy crisis. Its breadth and
depth exceeded anything I had
previously read and heard. The
meeting was under the auspices of
the Conservative Forum. As has
been the case at all the meetings
of this group, there was a genuine
confrontation of views. Mayor
Alioto and Dr. Lederberg were
excellent in their critical role, as
were Professors Inkeles, Kennedy
and Hook in their response to Dr.
Will Herberg at a previous
meeting.
What I find astonishing and
hard to explain is that during the
last two years it has been only at
the meetings of the Conservative
Forum that a genuine intellectual
give and take occurs.
The meetings of liberal and
especially radical groups are
uniformly one-sided in their
presentation. At the Marcuse
meeting I would have loved to
hear some incisive, critical mind
take his views apart. Although I
am a woman's liberation
sympathizer myself, I find their
meetings on campus depressing, as
are those of the prison reform and
left-wing civil rights groups,
because the audience is offered
mere propaganda which becomes
tedious in the absence of
intelligent criticism.
Even the questions are boring

because no one challenges the
speakers. Why is it that only the
Conservative Forum these days
does not fear debate and offers
intellectually exciting fare? In the
past this was the frustration of
liberal groups.
Whatever the answer, I, for
one, am grateful for the meetings
held under the auspices of the
Conservative Forum, and look
forward in the future, on my
return, to attending more of
them.

'Lesser Miracle'
Editor:
Chalk up one "lesser miracle."
That was the term Berkeley City
Councilwoman Ying Lee Kelley
used to describe the approval by
students of the referendum to
invite Nguyen Huu Thai here as
ASSU Guest Professor. With that
accomplished, in Ying's words
"we must still wait for the greater
miracle of Thieu's government
releasing him."
Participating in a miracle was
very gratifying, and I'd like to
thank publicly all the people who
hoped and helped to bring it
about. I wish that worn-out,
cynical former activists could have
experienced the care and
enthusiasm which attracted
several new people to the
campaign each day.
In the end, over 80 people
worked on the campaign, and the
Thai referendum was passed by a
63 percent majority. The victory
was very heartening to those of us
who still believe that students can

do something positive and very
significant, even when the tenor
of the times is seemingly to avoid
so-called "exterior" concerns.
The successful events here have
encouraged Kelley to go to the
Associated Students of the
University of California at
Berkeley and urge them to adopt
a South Vietnamese political
prisoner, as we have done. Their
student senate has already passed
a resoltuion deploring the
treatment of imprisoned medical
student Huynh Tan Mam, calling
for his release, and demanding
that the Paris Peace Accords be
implemented.
American advisors and dollars
are still covertly supporting war
and political repression in
Vietnam, but it appears that the
American people and Congress are
closer than ever to enforcing a real
American disengagement.
The recent events at Stanford
and continuing student action will
prove to be very significant in the
united campaign to implement the
Peace Accords and ensure a lasting
peace in Vietnam.
And now for the greater
miracle.. . .

Concerning the article titled
"Sex counseling at Cowell" in the
April 18 Daily, there are several
additions and corrections to be
made in order to realistically
describe the program.
The two ideas behind the peer

counseling on contraceptives are:
1) to enable Cowell to offer
contraceptive counseling to
students who, for any number of
reasons, prefer discussing the
subject with peers; and 2) to
encourage and facilitate couple
participation in the discussion,
choice, and responsibility of a
birth control method.
At the same time we are
prepared to make referrals to
professionals for sexuality and
abortion counseling and referrals
to peers for raps on
homosexuality. We are not
