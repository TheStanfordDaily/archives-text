# Zebra, SLA In Town

Hooray! San Francisco has
done it at last! It's achieved a
reknown rivaling the star capital
to the south, Hollywood. Select
City residents are making it big in
the headlines, they're bringing us
fame and doing us proud.
Even television news, long
subordinate to primetime
spectacles has been «elevated in
popularity. The six o'clock cast
now titillates our dinner hour with
mysteries, horror stories and
sexually-toned melodramas
sensational as the later fare.
No longer can the staidness and
ratings of news be scorned.
Ratings are climbing, TV station
managers and ad men rejoice that
they can offer entertainment the
likes of network and movie
produce, and why? All because of
a few fresh faced kids.
New Stars
These new stars have
captivated our attention — and
the media. The only thing lacking
in fact, is a column by Joyce
Haber or another chronicler of the
solar system, running as follows:
Well, stargazers, guess who's
back in town? CINQUE (stage
name) and his Band, with a daring
debut at the Right Bank (Or was
it Wrong? I never get the
distinction straight). They pulled
it off without a hitch — the troops
really wowed 'em — and they're
certainly in the spotlight now!
But Scorpio's rising and so's
that other adventurer, ZEBRA
he's called. Elusive beast, he gives
the snake competition. He only
strikes at dusk, girls (and boys),
though you'd have to be fated to
catch one of his surprise
appearances. But, animal fans,
beware — my sources tell me
Zebra has a yellow streak ... a
Shakespearean flaw that just
makes him more appealingly
human.
Cheap Imitators
As always, a number of cheap
imitators are vying for the
footlights, flaunting their prowess
in various arenas, but we
recognize them for the pretenders
they are. Still, we appeciate their
undaunted tries, for Zebra and the
SLA are hard acts to follow.
Lucky were we indeed that a
well-placed video camera
recorded Cinque's Bank job,
especially because that new
recruit, TANIA, gave a command
performance.
Suddenly lively, San Francisco
will be the talk of the town, the
nation, the continent, and even
the world for some time to come,
thanks to our gay cavaliers.
Names In Lights
Yes, through dint of will and
ambition, San Francisco's progeny
have practically gotten their
names in lights (it won't be long).
And this achievement is only
slightly undermined by rumors
that they "blackmailed" their
publicists or that the media has
been overzealous in covering
them.
Who could argue that their
ingenious theatrical devices
deserve every possible exposure?
Extensive reporting discharges a
public service, by inspiring the
depressed to deeds they'd never
have imagined on their own.
Sensational!
And when Channel 5
anchorman Gene Tuck or KGO
broadcaster Jerry Jensen warn us
during the commercial break
before newstime that the top
story concerns another possible
visit by Zebra, this time to a
couple's home, they are giving a
journalistically valid
interpretation of the event, later
to be clarified, of course.
Nor are their hypertensive
introductions inappropriate to the
story's drama. Likewise, that
newspapers until only recently
have given unlimited space to SLA
press releases is merely due
acknowledgment of deathless
rhetoric.
We can't balk, however, at
intimations that our print-napers
are exhibitionists. And we won't
skirt the charge that they've used
special effects (wigs, weapons, real
bullets) and postures ("social
concern") to gain our acclaim.
Entertainers are notoriously
void of redeeming consciousness;
blithe spirit flirting on the stage of
life, they enflame us with the
passion of the moment, but their
glory is transient.
We and the media must humor
their fragile egos, for they bring
joy to dozens. As everyone
knows, new stars are selfish,
tempermental, reckless babes in
need of pampering for the ratings'
sake. That's showbiz.
