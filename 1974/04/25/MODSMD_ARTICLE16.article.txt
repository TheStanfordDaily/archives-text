# CROW To Discuss Sexism
## 
### 
Matilda Butler-Paisley, lecturer
and research associate in the
Communication Department, will
be speaking on her method and
findings at noon today in Room
87 of the Business School as part
of a weekly lecture series
sponsored by the Committee for
Research on Women (CROW).
She has been studying the
problem of sexism in the mass
media, particularly in advertising.

She emphasizes, however, that
what she means by "mass media"
runs the gamut from advertising
to children's games.
Mass media strongly influence
modern views on women's role in
society, Butler-Paisley says.
In defining sexism for her
study, Butler-Paisley has come up
with a model of five "stages of
consciousness" which she says are
represented in advertising.
