# Rosencrantz, Guildenstern Are Hapless Heroes
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
There must have been a tinte in
the beginning when we could have
said no. But somehow we missed
it. We'// know better next time.
So ends the tale of
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
two minor Shakespearean
characters elevated to the level of
non-heroes extraordinaire in Tom
Stoppard's existential
mind-bender, Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead.
The current Department of
Drama production presents Jerold
Pearson and Peter Moore as
convincing protagonists who don't
know when to say no, don't know
beginnings from endings, and
don't know for sure who is
Rosencrantz and who
Guildenstern.
In fact, Pearson is the small,
warm, innocent Rosencrantz who
takes his environment peacefully
and refuses to panic over the mere
fact that he does not know what
is happening to him.
Moore is the frightened and
threatened Guildenstern,

consistently trying to use his logic
to explain the directionless,
timeless space in which the
original Shakespearean Hamlet is
acted out with Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern as both bystanders
and participants in the events
which lead to their deaths.
Set designer Dale van Dalsem
has used tiered structures of dark,
slatted wood which resemble
stacked packing crates as the only
permanent stage structures. To
these, lighting designer A. Evan
Haag has added strange colored
lights which shine from both
above and below the platforms,
illuminating jets of steam and
fanciful feather-flowers of pure
white.
Perhaps the most effective part
of the setting is not visual but
aural: wierd quadrophonic music
created by Michael McNabb circles
the theater and seems to make the
ghostly steam jets dance.
Although the beginning sequence
of steam and sound is perhaps too
long, the overall effectiveness of
the sound is excellent.

Within their surreal
environment, Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern flip coins which
always turn up heads and play
word games which seem to have
meaning to everyone but them.
Perhaps because it was opening
night the first sequence lagged a
bit, but this was alleviated by the
time Betty James entered as The
Player. *
Although some members of the
audience quite vociferously
balked at the idea of The Player
being portrayed by a female,
James was perhaps the most
consistent performer in the
opening show. If her lusty, sensual
female portrayal of The Player is a
misinterpretation of Stoppard's
script, then it is a delightful one.
The rest of the players were an
incredibly vulgar and amusing
crew of clowns, shown in stark
contrast to the stiff and equally
ridiculous formality of the regular
Hamlet players. This contrast
helps to draw a thin line between
reality and non-reality, for while
it is the Hamlet cast whose actions

control Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, it is the players who
reveal the duo's fate.
Despite a few opening night
problems which can easily be
righted, Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead delivers
efficiently the statements
Stoppard wished to make about
man's confusion .regarding the
nature of the universe and his role
in it. Reality surrounds
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
the clues are all there, yet they
fail to grasp the truth behind the
mirage. As Guildenstern puts it:
All your life you live so close
to truth that it becomes a
permanent blur in the corner of
your eye.

p/obability of a coin turning up heads over 80 times in a row — between moments of pondering the
possibility that they are dead.
