# Fee Assessment Money
## PIRG Allotments Debated 
### DENIS CUFF 
University officials said they will
not allow the majority of the money
from the Public Interest Research
Group (PIRG) fee assessment to go to
the Northern California headquarters
of the group.
In a meeting last Tuesday, Dale
Snape, assistant to the dean of student
affairs, told the organizers of the
Stanford chapters of PIRG, Jack
Handy and Mark Weitzel, that he was
impressed with PIRG's educational
potential but could not accept their
proposal to channel 80 to 90 percent
of the money into the regional board
of directors.
Stanford is one of approximately
six Bay Area universities and junior
colleges which are local chapters of
Nor-Cal PIRG, an organization hiring

lawyers and technical experts to help
students research areas such as
consumer advocacy, environmental
protection and sex and race
discrimination.
Snape said the group's organizers
can either collect funds voluntarily or
accept the assessment money with
restrictions imposed on its use. Snape
declined to say what the restrictions
would be, but said they would ensure
that the money would be used to
benefit students directly.
Disappointed
Handy and Weitzel said they were
disappointed by the rejection of their
proposal. "We're going to take a look
at the options now," Handy said.
Handy said the options are unclear
because the University has not
specified them in writing. Snape is

preparing a formal statement of
options which he says he'll present by
early next week.
If the University agrees to collect
the fee assessment, a review board of
University administrators will decide
upon restrictions of the money's
usage.
Accordingly, students seeking
professional advice would submit a
budget proposal for their project,
Snape said. The review boards would
insure that use of money to hire
professionals would be consistent with
the University's policy on its monies.
Handy said he was unenthusiastic
about both options that Snape
outlined. He said the review board
"could be a lot of bureaucracy," and
added, "It may be more trouble than
it's worth."
Research, Not Profit
Any form of voluntary collection
would be unstable and create
administrative problems, he said. "We
want to do research, not collect
money."
Handy asserted Saturday that he
would not accept a proposal for
voluntary fee collections, but he was
less positive yesterday. He said he will
not reject or accept either option until
he has seen the University's detailed
plans for both of them.
Snape said faculty and staff here
might be able to supply much of the
professional advice for which Stanford
PIRG is willing to pay outsiders. Law
professors like Anthony Amsterdam
and faculty in other departments
might be willing to supply advice, he
said.
Handy said PIRG would rely upon
Stanford's resources as much as
possible, but it would need additional
outside help. "I don't think we can
expect people to drop everything and
help us."
Handy said he hoped he could set
up Stanford PIRG by the end of the
year so its first projects could start
next fall quarter.
