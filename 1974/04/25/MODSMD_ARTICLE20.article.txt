# Hawes Trio Demonstrates Style At Great American
## 
### BOB HENRY 
"The way to learn jazz is to
improvise," pianist Hampton
Hawes told students last month at
a Laney College music clinic.
Saturday night at The Great
American Music Hall, the
Hampton Hawes Trio (Hawes,
bassist Carol Kaye, and drummer
Washington Rucker)
demonstrated how improvisation,
combined with tight ensemble
playing, can be very entertaining.
The trio showed great
versatility by performing numbers
that ranged from Sonny Rollins'
calypso composition, "St.
Thomas," to a 3/4 time rendition
of "Someday My Prince Will
Come" to their own "Moses,"
which Hawes termed "a spiritual."
Their music covered many
different styles, yet it all had a
distinctive jazz flavor, usually
marked by inspired and
entertaining solos. At times Hawes
or Kaye would play alone, and in
other instances, Rucker and Kaye
would support the inventive
Hawes.
Rucker's "support" fluctuated
between his pulsating high-hatting
to drumming that was more
melodic than rhythmic which,
combined with Kaye's imaginative
bass work, created a superb

sound. The trio's versatility in
both choice of material and form
gave them a constant freshness
that kept most of the
near-capacity audience stimulated
for their lengthy three-set show.
The trio succeeds because they
are not only talented musicians,
but because they seem to enjoy
their audience and their music.
Hawes had a very friendly rapport
with the audience, stating that
"this next tune is a Spanish
number. I don't know how to
pronounce it, but anyway..
and that "We're going to take a
short break now, to warm up."
He paid a short tribute to
Sonny Rollins and Stevie Wonder
by playing such songs as
"Superstition," "You Are The

Sunshine Of My Life," "Don't
Worry About A Thing" and
Rollins' "Playing In The Yard."
The Bay Area will be fortunate
when they return to The Great
American Music Hall in June.
