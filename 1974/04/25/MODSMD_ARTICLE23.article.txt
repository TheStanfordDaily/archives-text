Simon Opposes Tax Cut
WASHINGTON — William E. Simon, President
Nixon's choice as next secretary of the Treasury,
said yesterday he opposes a tax cut and called for a
return to economic fundamentals to control
inflation.
Sen. Walter F. Mondale, D-Minn., accused Simon
of following a "typical old-fashioned big banker's
approach to the country's economy."
"The administration has been feeding us
ambrosia for years," Mondale said, while Americans
suffer from high inflation, a depressed housing
market and rising unemployment.
Simon, a 46-year-old former Wall Street
investment banker, testified before the Senate
Finance Committee, which is considering his
nomination to succeed George P. Shultz as Treasury
secretary.
Committee chairman Russell B. Long, D-La., said
he hopes Simon's nomination can be confirmed this
week. He said he is satisfied that Simon "in all
respects is qualified and ought to be confirmed for
the job."
None of the senators on the committee expressed
opposition to the appointment and most of the
questions were friendly, although they zeroed in on
the country's high inflation rate and administration
opposition to a tax cut.
Inflation To Get Worse
WASHINGTON — Inflation in the second half of
the year will be worse than either the Nixon
administration or private economists have predicted,
the government's top price controller said
yesterday.
John T. Dunlop, director of the Cost of Living
Council, also said he believes the inflation rate
during the April-June quarter will be about the same
as the 10.8 percent surge of the January-March
quarter.
"Thereafter, it may go down," he told reporters.
But he said the nation's overall price level will be
higher than the five to six percent increases forecast
for the second half by the administration and most
private economists.
Dunlop said he has suggested to administration
economic advisers that the official inflation forecast
be raised. He referred to the inflation rate as
calculated by the Gross National Product, the
broadest measure of the economy.
Proof that most of the forecasts are wrong and
too low came when first-quarter GNP figures
showed an inflation rate higher than most
economists have forecast, he said.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary-designate William
E. Simon said at his Senate confirmation hearings
that the decline in the GNP in the last three months
appeared to be just temporary, centered in auto, oil
and housing industries.
A tax cut to stimulate production, he said,
"would be highly inflationary, it would stimulate
demand that is already excessive. Our problem
today is one of shortages of supply, not demand."
He told Democratic senators favoring a tax cut
that it "might be good politics temporarily but it's
lousy economics."
Mount Herman Fight Continues
Syrian and Israeli planes strafed and bombed
each other's military positions on Mt. Hermon
yesterday while guns blazed below them along the
length of the cease-fire line for the 44th straight
day.

The Syrian command said it brought down two
Israeli jets with Soviet-made SAM missiles over Mt.
Hermon, but Israel said all its planes returned safely
after attacking Syrian positions on the strategic
mountain.
Israelis captured part of the mountain on the
Syrian-Lebanese border in 1967 and seized the
summit during last October's war, gaining a strategic
panorama of the Golan battleground, southeast
Syria and southern Lebanon.
Beirut newspapers said the Syrians have captured
a chain of peaks east to northwest of the summit
and some 13,000 Syrian commandos were poised
for a "final assault" to take the summit. An Israeli
command spokesman denied the reports.
As the fighting raged Israelis mourned the 10,000
countrymen killed in fighting since the 19405.
Wreath-laying ceremonies were held at 23 military
cemeteries as the state prepared to observe its 26th
anniversary today
Fleming Blasts Prosecution
NEW YORK — John N. Mitchell's defense
attorney denounced a federal criminal conspiracy
case against the former attorney general yesterday
as "a prosecutorial vision ... a vision they set out to
give life to."
"They have failed," Peter Fleming Jr. said in his
summation as the trial of Mitchell and codefendant
Maurice H. Stans, former commerce secretary,
neared an end. It is expected to go to the jury
today.
"This case is one ball of wax," declared Fleming.
"John Mitchell is either a corrupt fixer and liar or
he is neither."
Mitchell, 60, and Stans, 66, are accused of
conspiring to obstruct a Securities and Exchange
Commission fraud investigation of multimillionaire
Robert Vesco in return for Vesco's secret $200,000
cash contribution to President Nixon's reelection
campaign.
Mitchell and Stans left the Cabinet early in 1972
to direct the campaign. They are charged with
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury, and
are liable if convicted for up to 45 years each in
federal prison.
Aid Sought For Indochina
WASHINGTON — President Nixon yesterday
asked Congress to authorize the appropriation of
$939.8 million to assist South Vietnam, Cambodia
and Laos in their efforts to "shift their economies
from war to peace."
The administration figure for aid to Indochina
did not include military assistance which this year is
running at the rate of $1.4 billion. Congress
appropriated $450 million for economic
reconstruction in Indochina in the fiscal year ending
June 30.
"We must recognize that a modest increase in
economic assistance now will permit the
development of viable, self-supporting economies
with lower requirements for assistance within a few
years," Nixon said in a message to Congress.
The Nixon message did not break down the
separate amounts for the three countries for
economic assistance. But from official sources it was
learned that the administration is asking $695.5
million in economic aid for Vietnam, $187 million
for Cambodia and $57.3 million for Laos.
In military assistance for Cambodia in the new
fiscal year, the administration is asking $362
million. Military aid for Laos, it is estimated, will

amount to $85.2 million. The President asked
Congress for $985 million over-all for world-wide
grant military assistance, $555 million for foreign
military sales credits and $385.5 million for security
supporting assistance.
These figures were not broken down for separate
countries, but South Vietnam is receiving $1 billion
in military aid in this fiscal year ending June 30.
Reinecke Refuses To Quit
SACRAMENTO - Indicted Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke rejected a demand that he resign yesterday
and predicted he would win the Republican
nomination for governor by a 60-40 margin.
The demand for Reinecke's resignation came
from State Sen. Lawrence Walsh of Huntington
Park, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for
lieutenant governor.
"This serious problem of indictment for perjury
that confronts you erases your ability to function
effectively as lieutenant governor," Walsh told
Reinecke in a letter released to Capitol reporters.
"There is, too, the tragic possibility that the
incumbent lieutenant governor would be convicted
as charged," Walsh said.
Reinecke was indicted April 3 by the Watergate
grand jury on three counts of lying to the Senate
Judiciary Committee. The committee had
questioned Reinecke about his role in an offer from
the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. to
help underwrite the 1972 GOP national convention.
"The remarks of Mr. Walsh are the typical
desperate campaign tactics of a candidate who is
struggling to get publicity," Reinecke said at a news
conference.
Nixon Attacks Health Bill
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration
attacked parts of a Democratic compromise health
insurance bill yesterday but expressed willingness to
work with Congress toward enacting comprehensive
legislation this year.
While defending President Nixon's proposal at
House Ways and Means Committee hearings,
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Caspar
W. Weinberger criticized the chief features of the
compromise bill sponsored by Rep. Wilbur D. Mills,
D-Ark., the committee chairman, and Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate
Health subcommittee.
Weinberger argued that the administration's bill
"has a clearly limited role for the federal
government, and major roles for state governments
and private health insurance companies," while the
Mills-Kennedy bill "is essentially a federal program,
financed by $40 billion of new federal taxes and
operated by the federal government."
•Weinberger said the Mills-Kennedy bill "would
take a major step down the road toward complete
federal financing and control of all health care in
the United States."
The administration's bill is built around private
health insurance company policies as the mechanism
for providing coverage, with public financing only
where private financing is inadequate, under one of
three plans.

separate amounts for the three countries for
economic assistance. But from official sources it was
learned that the administration is asking $695.5
million in economic aid for Vietnam, $187 million
for Cambodia and $57.3 million for Laos.
In military assistance for Cambodia in the new
fiscal year, the administration is asking $362
million. Military aid for Laos, it is estimated, will

amount to $85.2 million. The President asked
Congress for $985 million over-all for world-wide
grant military assistance, $555 million for foreign
military sales credits and $385.5 million for security
supporting assistance.
These figures were not broken down for separate
countries, but South Vietnam is receiving $1 billion
in military aid in this fiscal year ending June 30.
Reinecke Refuses To Quit
SACRAMENTO - Indicted Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke rejected a demand that he resign yesterday
and predicted he would win the Republican
nomination for governor by a 60-40 margin.
The demand for Reinecke's resignation came
from State Sen. Lawrence Walsh of Huntington
Park, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for
lieutenant governor.
"This serious problem of indictment for perjury
that confronts you erases your ability to function
effectively as lieutenant governor," Walsh told
Reinecke in a letter released to Capitol reporters.
"There is, too, the tragic possibility that the
incumbent lieutenant governor would be convicted
as charged," Walsh said.
Reinecke was indicted April 3 by the Watergate
grand jury on three counts of lying to the Senate
Judiciary Committee. The committee had
questioned Reinecke about his role in an offer from
the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. to
help underwrite the 1972 GOP national convention.
"The remarks of Mr. Walsh are the typical
desperate campaign tactics of a candidate who is
struggling to get publicity," Reinecke said at a news
conference.
Nixon Attacks Health Bill
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration
attacked parts of a Democratic compromise health
insurance bill yesterday but expressed willingness to
work with Congress toward enacting comprehensive
legislation this year.
While defending President Nixon's proposal at
House Ways and Means Committee hearings,
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Caspar
W. Weinberger criticized the chief features of the
compromise bill sponsored by Rep. Wilbur D. Mills,
D-Ark., the committee chairman, and Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate
Health subcommittee.
Weinberger argued that the administration's bill
"has a clearly limited role for the federal
government, and major roles for state governments
and private health insurance companies," while the
Mills-Kennedy bill "is essentially a federal program,
financed by $40 billion of new federal taxes and
operated by the federal government."
•Weinberger said the Mills-Kennedy bill "would
take a major step down the road toward complete
federal financing and control of all health care in
the United States."
The administration's bill is built around private
health insurance company policies as the mechanism
for providing coverage, with public financing only
where private financing is inadequate, under one of
three plans.

Simon Opposes Tax Cut
WASHINGTON — William E. Simon, President
Nixon's choice as next secretary of the Treasury,
said yesterday he opposes a tax cut and called for a
return to economic fundamentals to control
inflation.
Sen. Walter F. Mondale, D-Minn., accused Simon
of following a "typical old-fashioned big banker's
approach to the country's economy."
"The administration has been feeding us
ambrosia for years," Mondale said, while Americans
suffer from high inflation, a depressed housing
market and rising unemployment.
Simon, a 46-year-old former Wall Street
investment banker, testified before the Senate
Finance Committee, which is considering his
nomination to succeed George P. Shultz as Treasury
secretary.
Committee chairman Russell B. Long, D-La., said
he hopes Simon's nomination can be confirmed this
week. He said he is satisfied that Simon "in all
respects is qualified and ought to be confirmed for
the job."
None of the senators on the committee expressed
opposition to the appointment and most of the
questions were friendly, although they zeroed in on
the country's high inflation rate and administration
opposition to a tax cut.
Inflation To Get Worse
WASHINGTON — Inflation in the second half of
the year will be worse than either the Nixon
administration or private economists have predicted,
the government's top price controller said
yesterday.
John T. Dunlop, director of the Cost of Living
Council, also said he believes the inflation rate
during the April-June quarter will be about the same
as the 10.8 percent surge of the January-March
quarter.
"Thereafter, it may go down," he told reporters.
But he said the nation's overall price level will be
higher than the five to six percent increases forecast
for the second half by the administration and most
private economists.
Dunlop said he has suggested to administration
economic advisers that the official inflation forecast
be raised. He referred to the inflation rate as
calculated by the Gross National Product, the
broadest measure of the economy.
Proof that most of the forecasts are wrong and
too low came when first-quarter GNP figures
showed an inflation rate higher than most
economists have forecast, he said.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary-designate William
E. Simon said at his Senate confirmation hearings
that the decline in the GNP in the last three months
appeared to be just temporary, centered in auto, oil
and housing industries.
A tax cut to stimulate production, he said,
"would be highly inflationary, it would stimulate
demand that is already excessive. Our problem
today is one of shortages of supply, not demand."
He told Democratic senators favoring a tax cut
that it "might be good politics temporarily but it's
lousy economics."
Mount Herman Fight Continues
Syrian and Israeli planes strafed and bombed
each other's military positions on Mt. Hermon
yesterday while guns blazed below them along the
length of the cease-fire line for the 44th straight
day.

The Syrian command said it brought down two
Israeli jets with Soviet-made SAM missiles over Mt.
Hermon, but Israel said all its planes returned safely
after attacking Syrian positions on the strategic
mountain.
Israelis captured part of the mountain on the
Syrian-Lebanese border in 1967 and seized the
summit during last October's war, gaining a strategic
panorama of the Golan battleground, southeast
Syria and southern Lebanon.
Beirut newspapers said the Syrians have captured
a chain of peaks east to northwest of the summit
and some 13,000 Syrian commandos were poised
for a "final assault" to take the summit. An Israeli
command spokesman denied the reports.
As the fighting raged Israelis mourned the 10,000
countrymen killed in fighting since the 19405.
Wreath-laying ceremonies were held at 23 military
cemeteries as the state prepared to observe its 26th
anniversary today
Fleming Blasts Prosecution
NEW YORK — John N. Mitchell's defense
attorney denounced a federal criminal conspiracy
case against the former attorney general yesterday
as "a prosecutorial vision ... a vision they set out to
give life to."
"They have failed," Peter Fleming Jr. said in his
summation as the trial of Mitchell and codefendant
Maurice H. Stans, former commerce secretary,
neared an end. It is expected to go to the jury
today.
"This case is one ball of wax," declared Fleming.
"John Mitchell is either a corrupt fixer and liar or
he is neither."
Mitchell, 60, and Stans, 66, are accused of
conspiring to obstruct a Securities and Exchange
Commission fraud investigation of multimillionaire
Robert Vesco in return for Vesco's secret $200,000
cash contribution to President Nixon's reelection
campaign.
Mitchell and Stans left the Cabinet early in 1972
to direct the campaign. They are charged with
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury, and
are liable if convicted for up to 45 years each in
federal prison.
Aid Sought For Indochina
WASHINGTON — President Nixon yesterday
asked Congress to authorize the appropriation of
$939.8 million to assist South Vietnam, Cambodia
and Laos in their efforts to "shift their economies
from war to peace."
The administration figure for aid to Indochina
did not include military assistance which this year is
running at the rate of $1.4 billion. Congress
appropriated $450 million for economic
reconstruction in Indochina in the fiscal year ending
June 30.
"We must recognize that a modest increase in
economic assistance now will permit the
development of viable, self-supporting economies
with lower requirements for assistance within a few
years," Nixon said in a message to Congress.
The Nixon message did not break down the
separate amounts for the three countries for
economic assistance. But from official sources it was
learned that the administration is asking $695.5
million in economic aid for Vietnam, $187 million
for Cambodia and $57.3 million for Laos.

that the decline in the GNP in the last three months
appeared to be just temporary, centered in auto, oil
and housing industries.
A tax cut to stimulate production, he said,
"would be highly inflationary, it would stimulate
demand that is already excessive. Our problem
today is one of shortages of supply, not demand."
He told Democratic senators favoring a tax cut
that it "might be good politics temporarily but it's
lousy economics."
Mount Herman Fight Continues
Syrian and Israeli planes strafed and bombed
each other's military positions on Mt. Hermon
yesterday while guns blazed below them along the
length of the cease-fire line for the 44th straight
day.

The Syrian command said it brought down two
Israeli jets with Soviet-made SAM missiles over Mt.
Hermon, but Israel said all its planes returned safely
after attacking Syrian positions on the strategic
mountain.
Israelis captured part of the mountain on the
Syrian-Lebanese border in 1967 and seized the
summit during last October's war, gaining a strategic
panorama of the Golan battleground, southeast
Syria and southern Lebanon.
Beirut newspapers said the Syrians have captured
a chain of peaks east to northwest of the summit
and some 13,000 Syrian commandos were poised
for a "final assault" to take the summit. An Israeli
command spokesman denied the reports.
As the fighting raged Israelis mourned the 10,000
countrymen killed in fighting since the 19405.
Wreath-laying ceremonies were held at 23 military
cemeteries as the state prepared to observe its 26th
anniversary today
Fleming Blasts Prosecution
NEW YORK — John N. Mitchell's defense
attorney denounced a federal criminal conspiracy
case against the former attorney general yesterday
as "a prosecutorial vision ... a vision they set out to
give life to."
"They have failed," Peter Fleming Jr. said in his
summation as the trial of Mitchell and codefendant
Maurice H. Stans, former commerce secretary,
neared an end. It is expected to go to the jury
today.
"This case is one ball of wax," declared Fleming.
"John Mitchell is either a corrupt fixer and liar or
he is neither."
Mitchell, 60, and Stans, 66, are accused of
conspiring to obstruct a Securities and Exchange
Commission fraud investigation of multimillionaire
Robert Vesco in return for Vesco's secret $200,000
cash contribution to President Nixon's reelection
campaign.
Mitchell and Stans left the Cabinet early in 1972
to direct the campaign. They are charged with
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury, and
are liable if convicted for up to 45 years each in
federal prison.
Aid Sought For Indochina
WASHINGTON — President Nixon yesterday
asked Congress to authorize the appropriation of
$939.8 million to assist South Vietnam, Cambodia
and Laos in their efforts to "shift their economies
from war to peace."
The administration figure for aid to Indochina
did not include military assistance which this year is
running at the rate of $1.4 billion. Congress
appropriated $450 million for economic
reconstruction in Indochina in the fiscal year ending
June 30.
"We must recognize that a modest increase in
economic assistance now will permit the
development of viable, self-supporting economies
with lower requirements for assistance within a few
years," Nixon said in a message to Congress.
The Nixon message did not break down the
separate amounts for the three countries for
economic assistance. But from official sources it was
learned that the administration is asking $695.5
million in economic aid for Vietnam, $187 million
for Cambodia and $57.3 million for Laos.
In military assistance for Cambodia in the new
fiscal year, the administration is asking $362
million. Military aid for Laos, it is estimated, will

amount to $85.2 million. The President asked
Congress for $985 million over-all for world-wide
grant military assistance, $555 million for foreign
military sales credits and $385.5 million for security
supporting assistance.
These figures were not broken down for separate
countries, but South Vietnam is receiving $1 billion
in military aid in this fiscal year ending June 30.
Reinecke Refuses To Quit
SACRAMENTO - Indicted Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke rejected a demand that he resign yesterday
and predicted he would win the Republican
nomination for governor by a 60-40 margin.
The demand for Reinecke's resignation came
from State Sen. Lawrence Walsh of Huntington
Park, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for
lieutenant governor.
"This serious problem of indictment for perjury
that confronts you erases your ability to function
effectively as lieutenant governor," Walsh told
Reinecke in a letter released to Capitol reporters.
"There is, too, the tragic possibility that the
incumbent lieutenant governor would be convicted
as charged," Walsh said.
Reinecke was indicted April 3 by the Watergate
grand jury on three counts of lying to the Senate
Judiciary Committee. The committee had
questioned Reinecke about his role in an offer from
the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. to
help underwrite the 1972 GOP national convention.
"The remarks of Mr. Walsh are the typical
desperate campaign tactics of a candidate who is
struggling to get publicity," Reinecke said at a news
conference.
Nixon Attacks Health Bill
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration
attacked parts of a Democratic compromise health
insurance bill yesterday but expressed willingness to
work with Congress toward enacting comprehensive
legislation this year.
While defending President Nixon's proposal at
House Ways and Means Committee hearings,
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Caspar
W. Weinberger criticized the chief features of the
compromise bill sponsored by Rep. Wilbur D. Mills,
D-Ark., the committee chairman, and Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate
Health subcommittee.
Weinberger argued that the administration's bill
"has a clearly limited role for the federal
government, and major roles for state governments
and private health insurance companies," while the
Mills-Kennedy bill "is essentially a federal program,
financed by $40 billion of new federal taxes and
operated by the federal government."
•Weinberger said the Mills-Kennedy bill "would
take a major step down the road toward complete
federal financing and control of all health care in
the United States."
The administration's bill is built around private
health insurance company policies as the mechanism
for providing coverage, with public financing only
where private financing is inadequate, under one of
three plans.

Simon Opposes Tax Cut
WASHINGTON — William E. Simon, President
Nixon's choice as next secretary of the Treasury,
said yesterday he opposes a tax cut and called for a
return to economic fundamentals to control
inflation.
Sen. Walter F. Mondale, D-Minn., accused Simon
of following a "typical old-fashioned big banker's
approach to the country's economy."
"The administration has been feeding us
ambrosia for years," Mondale said, while Americans
suffer from high inflation, a depressed housing
market and rising unemployment.
Simon, a 46-year-old former Wall Street
investment banker, testified before the Senate
Finance Committee, which is considering his
nomination to succeed George P. Shultz as Treasury
secretary.
Committee chairman Russell B. Long, D-La., said
he hopes Simon's nomination can be confirmed this
week. He said he is satisfied that Simon "in all
respects is qualified and ought to be confirmed for
the job."
None of the senators on the committee expressed
opposition to the appointment and most of the
questions were friendly, although they zeroed in on
the country's high inflation rate and administration
opposition to a tax cut.
Inflation To Get Worse
WASHINGTON — Inflation in the second half of
the year will be worse than either the Nixon
administration or private economists have predicted,
the government's top price controller said
yesterday.
John T. Dunlop, director of the Cost of Living
Council, also said he believes the inflation rate
during the April-June quarter will be about the same
as the 10.8 percent surge of the January-March
quarter.
"Thereafter, it may go down," he told reporters.
But he said the nation's overall price level will be
higher than the five to six percent increases forecast
for the second half by the administration and most
private economists.
Dunlop said he has suggested to administration
economic advisers that the official inflation forecast
be raised. He referred to the inflation rate as
calculated by the Gross National Product, the
broadest measure of the economy.
Proof that most of the forecasts are wrong and
too low came when first-quarter GNP figures
showed an inflation rate higher than most
economists have forecast, he said.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary-designate William
E. Simon said at his Senate confirmation hearings
that the decline in the GNP in the last three months
appeared to be just temporary, centered in auto, oil
and housing industries.

compromise bill sponsored by Rep. Wilbur D. Mills,
D-Ark., the committee chairman, and Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate
Health subcommittee.
Weinberger argued that the administration's bill
"has a clearly limited role for the federal
government, and major roles for state governments
and private health insurance companies," while the
Mills-Kennedy bill "is essentially a federal program,
financed by $40 billion of new federal taxes and
operated by the federal government."
•Weinberger said the Mills-Kennedy bill "would
take a major step down the road toward complete
federal financing and control of all health care in
the United States."
The administration's bill is built around private
health insurance company policies as the mechanism
for providing coverage, with public financing only
where private financing is inadequate, under one of
three plans.

Simon Opposes Tax Cut
WASHINGTON — William E. Simon, President
Nixon's choice as next secretary of the Treasury,
said yesterday he opposes a tax cut and called for a
return to economic fundamentals to control
inflation.
Sen. Walter F. Mondale, D-Minn., accused Simon
of following a "typical old-fashioned big banker's
approach to the country's economy."
"The administration has been feeding us
ambrosia for years," Mondale said, while Americans
suffer from high inflation, a depressed housing
market and rising unemployment.
Simon, a 46-year-old former Wall Street
investment banker, testified before the Senate
Finance Committee, which is considering his
nomination to succeed George P. Shultz as Treasury
secretary.
Committee chairman Russell B. Long, D-La., said
he hopes Simon's nomination can be confirmed this
week. He said he is satisfied that Simon "in all
respects is qualified and ought to be confirmed for
the job."
None of the senators on the committee expressed
opposition to the appointment and most of the
questions were friendly, although they zeroed in on
the country's high inflation rate and administration
opposition to a tax cut.
Inflation To Get Worse
WASHINGTON — Inflation in the second half of
the year will be worse than either the Nixon
administration or private economists have predicted,
the government's top price controller said
yesterday.
John T. Dunlop, director of the Cost of Living
Council, also said he believes the inflation rate
during the April-June quarter will be about the same
as the 10.8 percent surge of the January-March
quarter.
"Thereafter, it may go down," he told reporters.
But he said the nation's overall price level will be
higher than the five to six percent increases forecast
for the second half by the administration and most
private economists.
Dunlop said he has suggested to administration
economic advisers that the official inflation forecast
be raised. He referred to the inflation rate as
calculated by the Gross National Product, the
broadest measure of the economy.
Proof that most of the forecasts are wrong and
too low came when first-quarter GNP figures
showed an inflation rate higher than most
economists have forecast, he said.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary-designate William
E. Simon said at his Senate confirmation hearings
that the decline in the GNP in the last three months
appeared to be just temporary, centered in auto, oil
and housing industries.
A tax cut to stimulate production, he said,
"would be highly inflationary, it would stimulate
demand that is already excessive. Our problem
today is one of shortages of supply, not demand."
He told Democratic senators favoring a tax cut
that it "might be good politics temporarily but it's
lousy economics."
Mount Herman Fight Continues
Syrian and Israeli planes strafed and bombed
each other's military positions on Mt. Hermon
yesterday while guns blazed below them along the
length of the cease-fire line for the 44th straight
day.

The Syrian command said it brought down two
Israeli jets with Soviet-made SAM missiles over Mt.
Hermon, but Israel said all its planes returned safely
after attacking Syrian positions on the strategic
mountain.
Israelis captured part of the mountain on the
Syrian-Lebanese border in 1967 and seized the
summit during last October's war, gaining a strategic
panorama of the Golan battleground, southeast
Syria and southern Lebanon.
Beirut newspapers said the Syrians have captured
a chain of peaks east to northwest of the summit
and some 13,000 Syrian commandos were poised
for a "final assault" to take the summit. An Israeli
command spokesman denied the reports.
As the fighting raged Israelis mourned the 10,000
countrymen killed in fighting since the 19405.
Wreath-laying ceremonies were held at 23 military
cemeteries as the state prepared to observe its 26th
anniversary today
Fleming Blasts Prosecution
NEW YORK — John N. Mitchell's defense
attorney denounced a federal criminal conspiracy
case against the former attorney general yesterday
as "a prosecutorial vision ... a vision they set out to
give life to."
"They have failed," Peter Fleming Jr. said in his
summation as the trial of Mitchell and codefendant
Maurice H. Stans, former commerce secretary,
neared an end. It is expected to go to the jury
today.
"This case is one ball of wax," declared Fleming.
"John Mitchell is either a corrupt fixer and liar or
he is neither."
Mitchell, 60, and Stans, 66, are accused of
conspiring to obstruct a Securities and Exchange
Commission fraud investigation of multimillionaire
Robert Vesco in return for Vesco's secret $200,000
cash contribution to President Nixon's reelection
campaign.
Mitchell and Stans left the Cabinet early in 1972
to direct the campaign. They are charged with
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury, and
are liable if convicted for up to 45 years each in
federal prison.
Aid Sought For Indochina
WASHINGTON — President Nixon yesterday
asked Congress to authorize the appropriation of
$939.8 million to assist South Vietnam, Cambodia
and Laos in their efforts to "shift their economies
from war to peace."
The administration figure for aid to Indochina
did not include military assistance which this year is
running at the rate of $1.4 billion. Congress
appropriated $450 million for economic
reconstruction in Indochina in the fiscal year ending
June 30.
"We must recognize that a modest increase in
economic assistance now will permit the
development of viable, self-supporting economies
with lower requirements for assistance within a few
years," Nixon said in a message to Congress.
The Nixon message did not break down the
separate amounts for the three countries for
economic assistance. But from official sources it was
learned that the administration is asking $695.5
million in economic aid for Vietnam, $187 million
for Cambodia and $57.3 million for Laos.
In military assistance for Cambodia in the new
fiscal year, the administration is asking $362
million. Military aid for Laos, it is estimated, will

amount to $85.2 million. The President asked
Congress for $985 million over-all for world-wide
grant military assistance, $555 million for foreign
military sales credits and $385.5 million for security
supporting assistance.
These figures were not broken down for separate
countries, but South Vietnam is receiving $1 billion
in military aid in this fiscal year ending June 30.
Reinecke Refuses To Quit
SACRAMENTO - Indicted Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke rejected a demand that he resign yesterday
and predicted he would win the Republican
nomination for governor by a 60-40 margin.
The demand for Reinecke's resignation came
from State Sen. Lawrence Walsh of Huntington
Park, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for
lieutenant governor.
"This serious problem of indictment for perjury
that confronts you erases your ability to function
effectively as lieutenant governor," Walsh told
Reinecke in a letter released to Capitol reporters.
"There is, too, the tragic possibility that the
incumbent lieutenant governor would be convicted
as charged," Walsh said.
Reinecke was indicted April 3 by the Watergate
grand jury on three counts of lying to the Senate
Judiciary Committee. The committee had
questioned Reinecke about his role in an offer from
the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. to
help underwrite the 1972 GOP national convention.
"The remarks of Mr. Walsh are the typical
desperate campaign tactics of a candidate who is
struggling to get publicity," Reinecke said at a news
conference.
Nixon Attacks Health Bill
