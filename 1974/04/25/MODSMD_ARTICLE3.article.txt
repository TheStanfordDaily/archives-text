# First Year Appraisal
## LCO Satisfied With Service 
### SUE KING 
During its first year, the ASSU
Legal Counseling Office (LCO) seems
to have filled a need among Stanford
students and their spouses for legal
advice and referral.
Glen Schofield, one of five
part-time attorneys staffing the LCO,
says the office has "worked fairly well
in giving students access to the legal
system."
Problems brought to the LCO
lawyers often "involve questions that
students couldn't afford to take to
private lawyers," Schofield said.
"Students should have access to this
kind of program without paying
astronomical fees.
"I've been fairly surprised that
we've been able to satisfy people with
all the advice that we've given,"
Schofield continued. "To my
knowledge, no one has stamped out of
the office because they were
dissatisfied with the advice that they
were given."
Others Pleased
Thelton E. Henderson, assistant
dean of the Law School and a member
of the LCO Policy Board, said that he
thinks the LCO is "going great, partly
because we got really fine attorneys to
run it. They are meeting the need [for
legal advice] beyond my
expectations."
University Ombudsman Harvey Hall
is also pleased with the LCO's
effectiveness. He has noticed a change
in the type of questions he has
received since the LCO opened last
fall. He says he is sure his office is
getting fewer legal questions now due
to the legal services offered by the
LCO.
Earlier in the year, he and Schofield
agreed to cooperate on questions they
received. Now, Hall said, he refers legal
questions to the LCO and they send
questions of an administrative nature
to him.
Before the existence of the LCO,
Hall said he used to "scrounge around
and try to get [legal information] on
an informal basis. There are a lot of
lawyers around [the University] who
are usually glad to be helpful," he said.
Primary Role
"Our primary role is legal
counseling and advice," explained
Schofield. "We are willing to discuss
any legal problem."
Students with legal questions or

problems are told "what to do next or
how to approach the problem,"
according to Schofield.
This counseling and advice service
includes researching, writing letters
and making phone calls for clients,
said Schofield.
Actual representation of students in
court has to be limited, said Schofield.
He explained this procedure was too
time-consuming. "A court appearance,
even for a simple thing, will often take
a whole morning," he said.
In cases where a student must go to
court, the LCO refers him to the Santa
Clara County Public Defender's office,
the Legal Aid Society or a private
attorney. LCO attorneys make checks
on the case to be sure the student is
being represented.
Over 300 Clients
Over 300 people have come to the
LCO between November, 1973, and

February, 1974. Almost two-thirds of
the clients were graduate students.
Schofield explains grad students have
"more complicated lifestyles" and are
"more sophisticated in terms of
knowing where to go to solve their
problems."
Because the LCO fee referendum
passed in the recent ASSU election,
the office will remain open during the
summer and will be funded for the
1974-75 school year, according to
Schofield.
The LCO is governed by a Policy
Board of three students, a
representative from the Dean of
Students office, a member of the Palo
Alto Bar Association and a faculty
member from the Law School.
The office is open Monday through
Thursday from 1 p.m; until 5 p.m.,
and Friday mornings from 10 until 12.
