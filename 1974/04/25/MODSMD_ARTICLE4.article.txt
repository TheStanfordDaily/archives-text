# Patricia Hearst's Tape Blasts Father, Fiance

From the Associated Press
SAN FRANCISCO — Newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst reviled her
father yesterday as a "pig," scorned
her fiance as a "clown" and declared
she willingly had robbed a bank with
the Symbionese Liberation Army.
"To those people who feel I am
brainwashed I see no need to further
defend my position. I am a soldier in
the people's army," the 20-year-old
coed said in a taped recording received
by San Francisco police l through an
intermediary.
Meanwhile two women, including a
former Stanford student, have been
called to testify before the federal
grand jury investigating the Hearst
kidnaping and the April 15 robbery of
the Hibernia Bank's Sunset District
branch in San Francisco.
The witnesses are former Stanford
student Janet Cooper, also known as

Janet Cooper Weiss, and Cynthia
Garvey, both of Oakland.
Identification bearing Cooper's
name was presented by the woman
who rented the getaway cars used in
the robbery. Cooper reportedly told
friends her identification was stolen a
year ago.
Cars Found
Two getaway cars used in the
robbery were found yesterday in a
basement parking garage, the FBI said.
Charles Bates, FBI agent in charge,
said it was not known how long the
rented cars had been in the garage at
the Japan Center on Geary Street in
the city's Western Addition district.
Police said the green Maverick and
1973 Ford LTD were recovered about
8 a.m. and taken to the city police
garage. The FBI did not immediately
disclose how the cars were found.
It is unclear what role Cooper and
Garvey have played in the Hearst case,
if any. Both have been in seclusion
since before the Feb. 4 kidnaping.
However, authorities said both have
known persons who later joined the
SLA.
'Fighting With Guns'
Hearst, in her second statement
since she declared her allegiance to the
SLA, pledged to continue "fighting —
not with words but with guns."
The scathing tape recording, which
also contained the voices of two men,
was received by police community
relations director Rodney Williams
along with half of Hearst's driver's
license.
It was authenticated by a Hearst
family spokesman, and Patricia's
father said he still believed she had
been brainwashed since her abduction
Feb. 4 and was speaking under
coercion.
Tape To FBI
The tape was turned over to the
FBI, and federal officials had no
immediate comment on how Patricia's

statement might affect the grand jury
probe of the April 15 holdup. She was
photographed by bank cameras
carrying an automatic carbine and was
named in a $500,000 warrant as a
material witness to the holdup because
officials were unsure whether she was
acting under force.
"I was positioned so that I could
hold customers and bank personnel
who were on the floor. My gun was
loaded and at no time did any of my
comrades intentionally point their
guns at me," she said.
The SLA members wounded two
persons in a hail of gunfire during their
escape after the bank robbery.
'Expropriate' Funds
"On April 15 my comrades and I
expropriated $10,660.02 from the
Sunset branch of the Hibernia Bank.
Casualties could have been avoided
had the persons involved cooperated
with the people's forces and kept out
of the way," she said.
Patricia rejected the idea of
arranging a private meeting with some
intermediary or members of her
family.
"To the clowns who want a
personal interview with me — Vincent
Hallinan [an attorney], Steven Weed
[her fiance] and the pig Hearsts — I
prefer giving it to the people in the
bank," she said.
"It's absurd to think that I could
surface to say what I'm saying now
and be allowed to freely return to my
comrades. The enemy still wants me
dead."
Hallinan is a well-known defender
of radical causes and a trustee of the
$4 million trust fund established by
the Hearst Corp. to feed the poor if
Patricia is safely released by May 3.
"As for my ex-fiance," she said in a
calm, firm voice, "frankly I don't care
if I ever see him again.
Brainwashed
"In the last few months he has
