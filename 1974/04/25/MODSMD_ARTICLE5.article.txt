# Summer Job Market Favors Technicians
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
Technical fields offer the best
summer job opportunities in an
otherwise tight job market according
to Pam Evans, director of student
employment at the Career- Planning
and Placement Center.
Students with junior status or
higher have "the best chance at
meaningful work," Evans noted. Lists
of full-time summer jobs all over the
country are available at the Placement
Center.
The job market for both pre-med
and pre-law students is tight. Second
year law students have the best crack.
For pre-meds the outlook is darker
than before due to cutbacks in
research funds.
Jobs demanding technical skills are
more numerous and offer better
average pay, ranging from $3 to $5 per
hour, compared to the usual $2 to
$2.50. However, liberal arts students
will have a tough time landing offers,
Evans warned. Those who can type or

can program computers are better
equipped for skill-oriented work.
Strong Candidate
She emphasized that students don't
need to major in a particular field in
order to get a job in the area. For
example, an English major who also
has a good background in computer
science is a strong candidate.
For those unable to find full-time
work, Evans suggested "getting two or
three part-time jobs" since "it can be a
good way to work 40 hours or more a
week."
About 800 jobs on campus will be
available by July 1, according to
Assistant Director of Financial Aids
Gail Bates. Some 200 will fall under
the work-study program.
On-Campus Jobs
On-campus summer jobs vary from
library work to assistance at the
Medical Center and grounds-keeping.
Bates estimated 70 percent will require
no previous experience. Full-time pay
averages between $2.25 and $2.50 per
hour; part-time pay hovers at $2.25.
The minimum wage on campus is $2
and "will probably go up next year,"
Bates predicted.
Students seeking on-campus
summer employment must show
financial need for next year and must
also plan to enroll in the fall.
The Career Planning and Placement
Center offers its counseling, placement
and referral services to all registered
students and their spouses. One
full-time job recruiter and two student
recruiters currently seek out
prospective employers.
"We really would like students to
come in, so the Center can get an idea
of student interests and know what
kind of jobs to recruit," Evans urged.
