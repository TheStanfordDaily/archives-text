# Summer Job Market Favors Technicians

### ANN AMIOKA 
Technical fields offer the best
summer job opportunities in an
otherwise tight job market according
to Pam Evans, director of student
employment at the Career- Planning
and Placement Center.
Students with junior status or
higher have "the best chance at
meaningful work," Evans noted. Lists
of full-time summer jobs all over the
country are available at the Placement
Center.
The job market for both pre-med
and pre-law students is tight. Second
year law students have the best crack.
For pre-meds the outlook is darker
than before due to cutbacks in
research funds.
Jobs demanding technical skills are
more numerous and offer better
average pay, ranging from $3 to $5 per
hour, compared to the usual $2 to
$2.50. However, liberal arts students
will have a tough time landing offers,
Evans warned. Those who can type or

can program computers are better
equipped for skill-oriented work.
Strong Candidate
She emphasized that students don't
need to major in a particular field in
order to get a job in the area. For
example, an English major who also
has a good background in computer
science is a strong candidate.
For those unable to find full-time
work, Evans suggested "getting two or
three part-time jobs" since "it can be a
good way to work 40 hours or more a
week."
About 800 jobs on campus will be
available by July 1, according to
Assistant Director of Financial Aids
Gail Bates. Some 200 will fall under
the work-study program.
On-Campus Jobs
On-campus summer jobs vary from
library work to assistance at the
Medical Center and grounds-keeping.
Bates estimated 70 percent will require
no previous experience. Full-time pay
