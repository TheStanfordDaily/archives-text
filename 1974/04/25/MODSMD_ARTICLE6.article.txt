# Carpenter-Politician Builds Platform
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
John Fredrich isn't a typical congressional
candidate. He has no political experience, no
campaign organization and not even a
telephone of his own. But Fredrich's name
will be listed on the Republican ballot in the
June 4 primary in the 12th Congressional
District, which includes Stanford.
Fredrich, a Palo Alto carpenter, hopes to
unseat Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr., * R-Menlo
Park, and believes that his lack of political
experience might actually be an asset.
Like his primary opponents, McCloskey
and Atherton businessman J. Gordon Knapp,
Fredrich is a Stanford graduate.
"A particular feature of this year's election
will be that voters want to know if the
rhetoric of candidates can match their
performance," Fredrich told the Daily. "We've
had evasive candidates in the past and voters
are looking for people with new ideas who
haven't been deeply involved in the political
process."
Fredrich says that a major issue this year
will be government spending. Fredrich favors a
general reduction of spending on the national
level, especially military spending, and
decentralization of social service programs.
Local Needs
"Local governments should deal more with

local needs," Fredrich said. "We also need
better administration on the county, state and
city levels."
"I believe in the business ethic. The
initiative for solving many problems should
come from the private sector of the economy.
Individuals should change their own
performance before changing the political
process."
Fredrich added that he favors balancing the
federal budget if possible. His opponents,
McCloskey and Knapp, agree with him on this
issue.
Although Fredrich claims that he could
find a white-collar job if he wanted one, he
says he has preferred to work with his hands
since his graduation in 1968.
A former member of the Peace and
Freedom Party, Fredrich says he joined the
Republican Party because he believes that it is
dedicated to the principles of individual
freedom.
No Contributions
In a statement released this month,
Fredrich listed his 1973 income as $1575.25.
He declared a cash net worth of $10 and net
assets of $200.
Fredrich says he will refuse any campaign
contribution exceeding $100. But he has yet
to receive a contribution of any amount, he
noted.

"I was always rather opposed to limits on
campaign spending until I decided to run for
Congress," Fredrich said. "But when faced
with the problem of starting a campaign
without any money, I changed my mind."
Fredrich stated that some local and radio
and television stations have given him free
time for one-minute campaign advertisements.
"I also plan to publish a pamphlet that will
discuss election issues," Fredrich said. "But
I'm still working on my platform and I don't
yet have money to print one."
Fredrich has been asked to speak at a
number of local meetings and usually travels
to them on his bicycle. He conducts his
campaign from home and has a daily mail load
of six to eight letters regarding his campaign.
Supports Amnesty
Fredrich noted that he is emphasizing the
issue of amnesty. He remarked that it is time
for the nation to forgive the men who fled
from military duty.
"A large number of people are affected by
this issue, so I believe' that it is one of the
most important in the campaign."
Fredrich says he believes that one way to
inject morality into public life is to elect
candidates who have not been exposed to and
possibly corrupted by high office. He believes
that he is just such a man.
