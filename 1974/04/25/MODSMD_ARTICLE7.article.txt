# On Medical Care

Medical coverage for the
dependents paid for by the
University is a major demand for
which members of the bargaining
unit are willing to fight. Workers
outside the bargaining unit will
support this demand. With
reluctance USE gave up its
demand for dental coverage for
this year — a major concession
especially for workers with
children.
Is this an unreasonable demand
by community standards? What
do other employees get? Stanford
Hospital, owned and controlled
by the University, pays not only
medical but also dental coverage
for dependents. Why should other
University employees get less?
Both Lockheed and Syntex
cover employees and dependents.
The city of Palo Alto pays for
both medical and dental care for
dependents. So does the district
for Palo Alto teachers. Should we
be denied similar benefits?
What does our paternalistic
University offer? (Government
grants provide extra funds to
cover employee benefits.) One
plan which Stanford offers is the
"B" plan of Kaiser. For only 33
cents more per month per
individual or 98 cents more for a
family, employees could have the
Kaiser "S" plan. The "S" plan is
better coverage. It eliminates the
payment of $1 for each visit —
a considerable savings for a family
and it eliminates maternity costs.
Both Lockheed and Palo Alto
teachers have the "S" plan.
Few Pennies More
We could have enjoyed
increased coverage years ago for
but a few pennies more. Why
didn't we? Because our
administrators think they know
what's best for THEIR workers.
Did they ask us?
The University Blue Cross plan
compels the employee to pay
extra for himself and $27 for his
family. But outpatient care for
dependents is not covered, which
places an additional cost burden
on employees.
The third, United Medical
Clinic, plan is financially out of
reach of most workers.
Reasonable Demand
USE's demand for dependent
coverage as well as its demand for
the "S" plan or a Blue Cross
equivalent is reasonable. USE
should stand firm on these issues.

All regular employees —
defined by the University as those
who work 20 hours or more —
should be covered by both health
and pension plans. This is of
special importance to women
who must work yet can only work
part time in order to take care of
home and children.
What does our paternalistic
University offer its retirees? If the
retiree is over 65 or is v medically
disabled under 65, he must pay
$6.40 to Medicare plus $4 to Blue
Cross or $9 to Kaiser before the
University will pay $2.50 for
major medical.
Inadequate Coverage
Even this coverage is
inadequate. Otherwise the
University will pay nothing. For
the retiree under 65 — regardless
of length of service — nothing is
paid, but he is permitted to pay
his own major medical. Generous?
The City of Palo Alto allows its
retirees to continue the group
insurance. The Palo Alto teachers
are financially covered in the
group plan upon retirement.
And Stanford? Has it made
arrangements to include retirees in
group plans? No. The employee is
cut off and must buy individual
insurance at much higher cost
with considerably reduced
benefits. Stanford's attitude is
incredibly inconsiderate if not
downright callous.
Better System Needed
It should be obvious that all of
us need a better system of health
care. The present options open to
us are fragmented, inadequate yet
costly. What we need is a "Health
Maintenance Organization"
(HMO) which will take care of the
entire family, one that will be
comprehensive, preventative and
of high quality in which the
consumer has a decisive role.
For the past two years a group
of staff, faculty and students and
others in the community have
worked on a proposal for a
cooperative HMO for the Stanford
community. Organizations will
soon get this proposal for study
and criticism.
For its fruition we should have
the cooperation of individual
doctors and last but not least the
administrators of the Medical
School and the University. Can we
cooperate toward this end?
