# Common Pattern

It has been with interest that I
have followed the accounts,
proposals, referendums and
counter-proposals which have
come from all sides concerning
the fate of the Old Stanford
Elementary School (presently the
Music Annex and Day Care
Center) located at Mayfield and
Santa Ynez streets.
Implicit in all the arguments,
though, is the assumption that the
present structure will give way to
something more functional and up
to date. The new form will be
either emeritus or student
housing.
This pattern of development is
not only common to Stanford,
but is also the rule in San
Francisco and all other expanding
centers nationwide.
All too often lost in the wake
of new, more important
developments are the very origins
that lent San Francisco or
Stanford the characteristic flavor
each enjoys today.
SF Urban Renewal
In San Francisco, urban
renewal is responsible for the
wholesale razing of many of the
post-earthquake large wooden
homes which gave "the City" that
delightful neighborhood feeling.
Here at Stanford, the old
fraternity houses which give such
dignity to Mayfield Avenue are
slowly giving way to "urban

renewal," Stanford style.
The Old Stanford Elementary
School, with its quaint
school house architecture and its
grassy fields, stands as a
monument to Stanford, The Farm
of days past.
Community Grew
As the Stanford Community
grew in size, first Escondido
School was built to augment this
facility, and finally the modern
Lucille M. Nixon school on
Stanford Avenue was built to
replace the old school.
Since their abandonment by
the public school system, the
building and grounds have
continued to serve the present
community by housing the much
needed day care facilities as well
as serving as the Music Annex.
And still it remains one of the
more peaceful spots on an ever
more hustling campus.
So amidst the emeritus vs.
student housing controversy, I
would suggest the conservative
alternative; that is, to modify the
status quo, and look rather at new
land — such as the fields opposite
the medical center in back of the
Panama Street-Campus Drive
intersection — as a possible site
for the new structures.
