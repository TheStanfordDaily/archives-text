ALAN
-the film that ran for 3 continuous years in one theatre V
in Cambridge, Mass.
In an isolated surreal pocket of World War I, the British send
A Alan Bates into a highly unlikely, tiny French town to discover
A a bomb. The townspeople have fled and the inmates of the
A local asylum have taken, their place. The resulting interaction
A gives us some of the most enchanting sequences on film. When
A the reality of the returning armies breaks the bubble and the
A inmates have returned to the asylum, we can really share Bates'
A confusion about which people are really insane. In our opinion,
A KING OF HEARTS is a rare treat; funny and sad at the same time.
