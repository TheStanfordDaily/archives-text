# USE Sets Strike Vote; Negotiations Continue
## 
### DON COX 
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) union will take a strike vote
next week, USE President Jim Berk
told the Daily last night.
Berk said that if the strike vote
passes, the union will negotiate for
another week. He said the union
would strike Monday, May 13 if
negotiations produced no results.
"I think well win it [the strike
vote] and I think we'll have to go out"
on strike, Berk said.
"The University asked us to reduce
our demands and be reasonable and we
did that, but they won't talk about the
major economic issues," Berk said.
USE has been engaged in contract
negotiations with the University since
December.
Stuffing Envelopes
"We're stuffing the envelopes
tonight and will mail them out
Monday," Berk said. USE bylaws
require that the union must vote by
mail ballot to approve a strike, and
that strike decisions must be approved
by two-thirds of all union members.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger told the Daily last night
that he "was saddened by the fact that
they apparently feel they have to use
the actuality of a strike to accomplish
their objectives."
Augsburger said the University
wants to iron out what the union
refers to as "minor" issues before
moving on to the big economic issues.
Concessions
"We're prepared to make
concessions on the wage front but
we're not prepared to make them until
we know what the other contract
items will cost us," said Augsburger.
Berk said that he did not think the

University would give the union
adequate compromises to avert a
walkout.
'They will escalate their offers
after we win the vote, but it won't be
enough," he predicted.
He was optimistic about winning
the strike vote. "We wouldn't, have
gone for it if we didn't think we would
win it,"he said.
Strike Next Step
"Very few people believe the
University has been reasonable in its
response to our demands. People
recognize that a strike is the next step
to take," Berk said.
Augsburger hoped a strike could be

avoided, saying, "I don't think anyone
would be helped by a strike."
Doug Barton, University negotiator,
said yesterday that he was guardedly
optimistic about avoiding a strike. If
the union negotiates in good faith a
strike can be averted, he told KZSU.
Barton said that if the union did
approve a strike vote, it would not
affect the University'o negotiating
position.
Strike Sanction
The USE is "honing up relations
with other unions to sanction a USE
strike," said Berk. USE received strike
sanction from the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU), AFL-CIO,
March 30. Berk said USE would as'
SEIU to renew the sanction, which
expires April 30. (USE is Local 680 of
SEIU.)
USE will also seek strike sanction
from the AFL-CIO. Berk said that he
and Barton had been invited to a
meeting of the San Mateo County
Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO, tc.
present their views of the negotiations.
Augsburger said last night that he
"suspects" Barton will attend the
meeting.
University and union negotiators
met again yesterday. Barton said that
he sees progress in the negotiations but
Berk said he does not share Barton's
optimism.

Augsburger told the Daily last night
that he "was saddened by the fact that
they apparently feel they have to use
the actuality of a strike to accomplish
their objectives."
Augsburger said the University
wants to iron out what the union
refers to as "minor" issues before
moving on to the big economic issues.
Concessions
"We're prepared to make
concessions on the wage front but
we're not prepared to make them until
we know what the other contract
items will cost us," said Augsburger.
Berk said that he did not think the

University would give the union
adequate compromises to avert a
walkout.
'They will escalate their offers
after we win the vote, but it won't be
enough," he predicted.
He was optimistic about winning
the strike vote. "We wouldn't, have
gone for it if we didn't think we would
win it,"he said.
Strike Next Step
"Very few people believe the
University has been reasonable in its
response to our demands. People
recognize that a strike is the next step
to take," Berk said.

avoided, saying, "I don't think anyone
would be helped by a strike."
Doug Barton, University negotiator,
said yesterday that he was guardedly
optimistic about avoiding a strike. If
the union negotiates in good faith a
strike can be averted, he told KZSU.
Barton said that if the union did
approve a strike vote, it would not
affect the University'o negotiating
position.
Strike Sanction
The USE is "honing up relations
with other unions to sanction a USE
strike," said Berk. USE received strike
sanction from the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU), AFL-CIO,
March 30. Berk said USE would as'
SEIU to renew the sanction, which
expires April 30. (USE is Local 680 of
SEIU.)
USE will also seek strike sanction
from the AFL-CIO. Berk said that he
and Barton had been invited to a
meeting of the San Mateo County
Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO, tc.
present their views of the negotiations.
Augsburger said last night that he
"suspects" Barton will attend the
meeting.
University and union negotiators
met again yesterday. Barton said that
he sees progress in the negotiations but
Berk said he does not share Barton's
optimism.
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) union will take a strike vote
next week, USE President Jim Berk
told the Daily last night.
Berk said that if the strike vote
passes, the union will negotiate for
another week. He said the union
would strike Monday, May 13 if
negotiations produced no results.
"I think well win it [the strike
vote] and I think we'll have to go out"
on strike, Berk said.
"The University asked us to reduce
our demands and be reasonable and we
did that, but they won't talk about the
major economic issues," Berk said.
USE has been engaged in contract
negotiations with the University since
December.
Stuffing Envelopes
"We're stuffing the envelopes
tonight and will mail them out
Monday," Berk said. USE bylaws
require that the union must vote by
mail ballot to approve a strike, and
that strike decisions must be approved
by two-thirds of all union members.

Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger told the Daily last night
