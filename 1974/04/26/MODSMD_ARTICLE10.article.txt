# USE Pension Plan Not Extravagant'
## 
### 
Linda Crouse

I would like to respond to
University negotiator Douglas
Barton's comment on the
"extravagant" pension plan
proposed by USE.
First, there are three reasons
why the administration's pension
plan is unacceptable:
1) The pension often is not
enough to live on, even when
combined with social security.
After 48 years, a man recently
retired with a pension of $120 per
month. After 30 years, a woman
is going to get a pension of around
$100 per month.
2) The pension plan gives unit
workers far less than what's given
to professionals and faculty. The
administration contributes the
equivalent of 10 percent of their
salaries and only six percent of unit
salaries. Further, pensions are
based on earnings, and
professionals and faculty have
higher earnings to begin with, the
average associate professor's salary
being close to three times the
average unit pay.
Further, for retiring early
faculty can get $2000-10,000
extra, which is two to ten times
the total amount some workers
get yearly. Finally, if faculty can't
make it on their pension income,
the administration has a fund to
supplement it. Workers, in
contrast, can get food stamps
from their local welfare office.
Unfair Pension Plan
3) The pension plan gives
workers far less than what they
have earned. If you take the years
of productivity of a worker,
combined with technology, she/he

has earned the right to far more
than a poverty-level retirement.
A certain amount of work a
person does every day pays for
what she/he consumes in goods
and services, for example, food,
rent, clothes, etc. With this work,
you "pay your way." Another
portion of work, called "surplus
value," is literally taken from that
worker as profits or capital, for
example, more research
equipment, stocks, buildings, etc.
In this country each of us
works approximately two-three
hours a day to produce surplus
value for those who own and
control our institutions and
industries. That is two-three hours
of unpaid work per day which is
concealed by our pay being spread
out over eight hours.
Workers Built Stanford
That is what we mean when we
say workers have earned far more
than a poverty-level retirement.
Workers built Stanford from the
ground up. Every brick, every
pipe, cable, paper, machinery was
put there, cleaned, kept up and
run by labor. (Even the money
Leland Stanford put into the
University came from labor —
from the labor of workers who
built a railroad for which Stanford
got $16,000-$28,000 per mile
from the government while the
workers got wages far lower than
what they earned.)
For this labor workers have
earned the right to the same
respect and the same
compensation given to other
members of the University.
However, what we have a right to

and what we will get in this
system are two different things.
The union is only asking, now,
for a minimum of $250 per
month pension, and a
contribution to our plan equal to

that given professionals and
faculty.
I think this is a very small
compensation.

has earned the right to far more
than a poverty-level retirement.
A certain amount of work a
person does every day pays for
what she/he consumes in goods
and services, for example, food,
rent, clothes, etc. With this work,
you "pay your way." Another
portion of work, called "surplus
value," is literally taken from that
worker as profits or capital, for
example, more research
equipment, stocks, buildings, etc.
In this country each of us
works approximately two-three
hours a day to produce surplus
value for those who own and
control our institutions and
industries. That is two-three hours
of unpaid work per day which is
concealed by our pay being spread
out over eight hours.
Workers Built Stanford
That is what we mean when we
say workers have earned far more
than a poverty-level retirement.
Workers built Stanford from the
ground up. Every brick, every
pipe, cable, paper, machinery was
put there, cleaned, kept up and
run by labor. (Even the money
Leland Stanford put into the
University came from labor —
from the labor of workers who
built a railroad for which Stanford
got $16,000-$28,000 per mile
from the government while the
workers got wages far lower than
what they earned.)
For this labor workers have
earned the right to the same
respect and the same
compensation given to other
members of the University.
However, what we have a right to

and what we will get in this
system are two different things.
The union is only asking, now,
for a minimum of $250 per
month pension, and a
contribution to our plan equal to

that given professionals and
faculty.
I think this is a very small
compensation.

I would like to respond to
University negotiator Douglas
Barton's comment on the
"extravagant" pension plan
proposed by USE.
First, there are three reasons
why the administration's pension
plan is unacceptable:
1) The pension often is not
enough to live on, even when
combined with social security.
After 48 years, a man recently
retired with a pension of $120 per
month. After 30 years, a woman
is going to get a pension of around
$100 per month.
2) The pension plan gives unit
workers far less than what's given
to professionals and faculty. The
administration contributes the
equivalent of 10 percent of their
salaries and only six percent of unit
salaries. Further, pensions are
based on earnings, and
professionals and faculty have
higher earnings to begin with, the
average associate professor's salary
being close to three times the
average unit pay.
Further, for retiring early
faculty can get $2000-10,000
extra, which is two to ten times
the total amount some workers
get yearly. Finally, if faculty can't
make it on their pension income,
the administration has a fund to
supplement it. Workers, in
contrast, can get food stamps
from their local welfare office.
Unfair Pension Plan
3) The pension plan gives
workers far less than what they
have earned. If you take the years
of productivity of a worker,
combined with technology, she/he

has earned the right to far more
than a poverty-level retirement.
