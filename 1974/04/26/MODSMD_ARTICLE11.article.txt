# A 						Poem Of Life

(A satirical comment on political
angry people.)
GOD is the being who gives life
and takes life away. (GOD may
be society's product)
Life is what we have while we are
alive.
If I am free of society and the
concept that "Life is
precious," then I may question
the giving and taking away of
life.
As a matter of fact I no longer am
bound by that society's rules
regarding a human life.
Society teaches that human
life—all human life—is precious
(and I feel it is so).
If I am apart from that society,
and have been taught that this
principle only governs one sect
of that society, and if
I belong to the other sect, then it
follows that I have been taught
only that human life is to be
used.
So my attitude toward the only
thing we have while we are
alive is; that
/ have the power over it, and so I
am like unto GOD...

When I assert My Power it can
take many forms; one form is
to question everything and
everyone as if it or they must
answer to GOD.
And as with GOD if you like I will
know.
Another form is the taking of a
life.
It may be for any reason I feel is
justified, because I have
already stated
I am like God because I can mess
with life.
I must be GOD,
I can take or give life. ..
If I am GOD I don't have to
answer to anyone but myself,
because GOD is right and
righteous,
I can then make any kind of a
decision based on myself.
Don't tell me what the truth is — I
AM GOD, I KNOW THE
TRUTH - I AM THE
TRUTH IF YOU
DISPLEASE ME I WILL
TAKE AWAY THE ONLY
THING YOU HAVE
