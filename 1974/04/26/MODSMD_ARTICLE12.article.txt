# Food Service Success

Vince Turner I

After a month of renewed
operation, the Stanford Food
Service has announced the success
of its most recent innovation.
After the 70s food squeeze and
threats of economic perish, not to
mention the sustained costs of the
Great Food Riot of 1979, the
Food Service has found rebirth in
the discovery of an almost
unlimited food source — old
automobile tires.
For years scientists have been
experimenting with processes of
converting petroleum into
palatable protein. Owing to the
depletion of our oil reserves,
Stanford engineers, as far back as
1975, began to research the
possibilities of converting tires, a
product of petroleum, into an
edible product.
With numerous grants from
Goodyear and other leading tire
companies who faced extinction
along with the automobile in
1978, the Stanford Engineering
Department became the country's
foremost pioneer of the tire eating
industry.
Tangling with the problems of
economy, the Department at last
arrived at a low cost tire-protein
conversion process and received
U.S. Patent 3,269,00,396 on Dec.
12 of last year. Under demanding
deadlines, the process was
incorporated into the University's
food system during Christmas
recess.
'Bad Product'
"We concede now," admitted
one food official, "that we were
serving a bad product through an
archaic system during the 70s. We
thought we had the students'
hands tied, over a barrel so to
speak. We certainly didn't count
on the Food Riot nor the public
outcry from the publication of
The Jungle Revisited.
But with this new process
everyone's satisfied. The students
say that they look forward to
each meal."
Indeed, most of the students
interviewed were enthusiastic
about the change. Many reported
gaining weight and most were
feeling much healthier.
'First Abhorred'
As an R.A. in Lagunita recalls:
"At first we were abhorred by the
idea. But everything looked so
tantilizing compared to what they
used to serve us, how could we
lose? After one meal we were
hooked. I don't understand how
we could have put up with that
Beef Burgundy for as long as we
did."
With such a variety of tires still
to be found, menu planners were
posed with an interesting
challenge which they
enthusiastically pursued. A typical
menu for the day consists of
two-ply nylon cord omelettes for
breakfast, shredded aircraft tires
topped with minced white
sidewalls for lunch and a choice of
Goodyear steel-belted cutlets or
Goodrich four-ply's ala carte for
dinner.
The service is even considering
the possibility of a banquet each
month with the main dish
consisting of Michelin six-ply
steel-belted wide tracks simmered
for eight hours in a Pennsoil
broth.
Cook Excited
A cook in the Lagunita kitchen
is just as excited as the students,
acclaiming the Food Service as
"benevolent and flexible to
student needs."
"Where else could this happen
but at Stanford? It's great to see
everyone taking such pride in
their work. Nothing is wasted.
The hashers now and then slip
scraps into their pockets in hopes
of making a pair of sandals. But
we frown on this and it's grounds
for immediate dismissal."
One of the University's
financial analysts deemed the
innovation as "our school's
greatest cost reduction fact in the
last quarter century." With a
national old and new tire reserve
of over 4.5 billion, University
administrators are confident of
enormous added income by
competing on the open market
with the new economical process.
However, one dissenter was
overheard at dinner echoing the
sentiments of a small dissatisfied
faction of students: "Retreads!
All they serve us are retreads!"

converting petroleum into
palatable protein. Owing to the
depletion of our oil reserves,
Stanford engineers, as far back as
1975, began to research the
possibilities of converting tires, a
product of petroleum, into an
edible product.
With numerous grants from
Goodyear and other leading tire
companies who faced extinction
along with the automobile in
1978, the Stanford Engineering
Department became the country's
foremost pioneer of the tire eating
industry.
Tangling with the problems of
economy, the Department at last
arrived at a low cost tire-protein
conversion process and received
U.S. Patent 3,269,00,396 on Dec.
12 of last year. Under demanding
deadlines, the process was
incorporated into the University's
food system during Christmas
recess.
'Bad Product'
"We concede now," admitted
one food official, "that we were
serving a bad product through an
archaic system during the 70s. We
thought we had the students'
hands tied, over a barrel so to
speak. We certainly didn't count
on the Food Riot nor the public
outcry from the publication of
The Jungle Revisited.
But with this new process
everyone's satisfied. The students
say that they look forward to
each meal."
Indeed, most of the students
interviewed were enthusiastic
about the change. Many reported
gaining weight and most were
feeling much healthier.
'First Abhorred'
As an R.A. in Lagunita recalls:
"At first we were abhorred by the
idea. But everything looked so
tantilizing compared to what they
used to serve us, how could we
lose? After one meal we were
hooked. I don't understand how
we could have put up with that
Beef Burgundy for as long as we
did."
With such a variety of tires still
to be found, menu planners were
posed with an interesting
challenge which they
enthusiastically pursued. A typical
menu for the day consists of
two-ply nylon cord omelettes for
breakfast, shredded aircraft tires
topped with minced white
sidewalls for lunch and a choice of
Goodyear steel-belted cutlets or
Goodrich four-ply's ala carte for
dinner.
The service is even considering
the possibility of a banquet each
month with the main dish
consisting of Michelin six-ply
steel-belted wide tracks simmered
for eight hours in a Pennsoil
broth.
Cook Excited
A cook in the Lagunita kitchen
is just as excited as the students,
acclaiming the Food Service as
"benevolent and flexible to
student needs."
"Where else could this happen
but at Stanford? It's great to see
everyone taking such pride in
their work. Nothing is wasted.
The hashers now and then slip
scraps into their pockets in hopes
of making a pair of sandals. But
we frown on this and it's grounds
for immediate dismissal."
One of the University's
financial analysts deemed the
innovation as "our school's
greatest cost reduction fact in the
last quarter century." With a
national old and new tire reserve
of over 4.5 billion, University
administrators are confident of
enormous added income by
competing on the open market
with the new economical process.
However, one dissenter was
overheard at dinner echoing the
sentiments of a small dissatisfied
faction of students: "Retreads!
All they serve us are retreads!"

After the 70s food squeeze and

automobile tires.
