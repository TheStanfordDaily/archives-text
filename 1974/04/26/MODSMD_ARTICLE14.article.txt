# Official Attacks U.S. Prison System
## 
### TONY DELLING 
John Boone, former
Massachusetts Commissioner of
Corrections told a Tresidder
audience Wednesday night that
the prison system in the United
States must be abolished and
claimed that "the public is a
victim of the prison system."
Boone, who is heading the
National Campaign Against
Prisons said that "most prisoners
will admit they have done wrong.
But they still want to be treated
right." According to Boone, the
treatment received by prisoners
brutalizes and discourages them.
Thus when they are released, they
most often return to a life of crime
for which the public at large pays.
In his speech, Boone also
sharply criticized government and
prison officials for standing in the
way of prison reform. He
mentioned several instances where
furlough programs (which permit
prisoners to visit their families,
occasionally at home) were
terminated by government
authorities because one prisoner
would use the program to escape
from prison. "It is unjust to
punish a whole group of prisoners
just because one man violates the
rules," said Boone.
Unfair To Minorities
Moreover, he maintained that
the prison system is especially
unfair to minority groups. Boone
asserted that 70 percent of
prisoners in the South are black,
and that in Northern cities such as
Philadelphia, around 80 percent
of prisoners are black.

Lastly, Boone stressed that the
socio-economic system in the
United States forces crime on
certain disadvantaged groups.
Hence with the abolition of the
prison system, he said there must
be social change. "To close
prisons there must be jobs and
education. We must put integrity
and morality into the
socio-economic system."
Reasons For Attica
Following Boone, John Hill, a
Native American under
indictment in the Attica, New
York prison rebellion of
September, 1971, spoke on the
conditions leading to the uprising.
He cited "police brutality,
murders, kangaroo courts, and
solitary confinement," as key
factors causing the prison revolt.
Hill also described most prison
guards as "racist suburb police
who didn't understand third
world people who forced us to
rebel."
After Hill's speech the film
Attica was shown, describing
the events of the prison uprising.
The film blamed New York
prison authorities and Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller for the tragic
end to the prison takeover in
which 31 inmates and 9 hostages
were killed when police and state
troopers were called in to end the
takeover.
In addition, the film claimed
that since the 1971 uprising, New
York has made no effort to
improve conditions at Attica.
