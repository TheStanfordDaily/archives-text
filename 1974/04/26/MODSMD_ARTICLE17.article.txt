# Americans Using More Energy
## 
### 
From The Associated Press
Americans are abandoning the
strict conservation measures they
imposed on themselves at the
height of the energy crisis.
A nationwide Associated Press
survey finds that automobile
traffic in most areas of the
country is approaching
pre-embargo levels. It also shows
that toll road receipts are
climbing, mass transit use is
slipping and the rate of electricity
conservation is falling.
"There are as many people on
the road now as there were in
September," before the Arab oil
embargo brought the winter
energy crisis, said federal energy
chief John C. Sawhill.
The AP survey showed that in
recent weeks police in many states
have written many more speeding
tickets as motorists press down on
the gas pedal.
End Of Embargo
It was the embargo imposed by
Middle East producers in the fall
that forced Americans to
significantly cut back their use of
energy, and it was the end of that

embargo on March 18 that
apparently has started them back
toward their old habits.
A spokesman for Florida
Power & Light Co., the state's
largest utility, said its customers
used six percent less electricity
than they normally would have
between early December and late
February.
But that figure fell to three
percent in March.and a spokesman
said "figures the week the Arab
oil embargo was lifted indicate
customers used noticeably more
electricity than any other week in
March."
Conservation Sipping
A similar pattern was repeated
in many states, with utilities and
state agencies reporting that
conservation is slipping. They
noted, however, that Americans
still are not using the amount of
electricity they would under
normal growth patterns.
The push by city, state and
federal governments for citizens
to use car pools appears from the
AP survey to hve been a miserable
failure in most areas.

A group of scientists at the
Opinion Research Center in
Chicago, who have conducted
weekly energy surveys for a year,
said they found no tendency by
consumers to switch away from
the single-passenger auto trip.
Higher Prices
The sharply higher prices for
gasoline brought about by a
quadrupling in the foreign price of
oil does not seem to be keeping
people off the roads. But the price
hikes, coupled with lower speed
limits, may be responsible for the
continued strong business being
done by Amtrak and the airlines.
The American Automobile
Association said Tuesday that the
gasoline situation in the country is
generally stabilized. It said a spot
check of 6,152 stations found
only 2 percent out of gas, only
2.5 percent operating on split
shifts and only 6 percent limiting
purchases.
And everywhere, from the
major cities to rural areas, the
gasoline lines which aggravated
motorists and shocked politicians
in January and February are gone.

federal governments for citizens
to use car pools appears from the
AP survey to hve been a miserable
failure in most areas.

A group of scientists at the
Opinion Research Center in
Chicago, who have conducted
weekly energy surveys for a year,
said they found no tendency by
consumers to switch away from
the single-passenger auto trip.
Higher Prices
The sharply higher prices for
gasoline brought about by a
quadrupling in the foreign price of
oil does not seem to be keeping
people off the roads. But the price
hikes, coupled with lower speed
limits, may be responsible for the
continued strong business being
done by Amtrak and the airlines.
The American Automobile
Association said Tuesday that the
gasoline situation in the country is
generally stabilized. It said a spot
check of 6,152 stations found
only 2 percent out of gas, only
2.5 percent operating on split
shifts and only 6 percent limiting
purchases.
And everywhere, from the
major cities to rural areas, the
gasoline lines which aggravated
motorists and shocked politicians
in January and February are gone.
From The Associated Press
Americans are abandoning the
strict conservation measures they
imposed on themselves at the
height of the energy crisis.
A nationwide Associated Press
survey finds that automobile
traffic in most areas of the
country is approaching
pre-embargo levels. It also shows
that toll road receipts are
climbing, mass transit use is
slipping and the rate of electricity
conservation is falling.
"There are as many people on
the road now as there were in
September," before the Arab oil
embargo brought the winter
energy crisis, said federal energy
chief John C. Sawhill.
The AP survey showed that in
recent weeks police in many states
have written many more speeding
tickets as motorists press down on
the gas pedal.
End Of Embargo
It was the embargo imposed by
Middle East producers in the fall
that forced Americans to
significantly cut back their use of
energy, and it was the end of that

embargo on March 18 that
apparently has started them back
toward their old habits.
A spokesman for Florida
Power & Light Co., the state's
largest utility, said its customers
used six percent less electricity
than they normally would have
between early December and late
February.
But that figure fell to three
percent in March.and a spokesman
said "figures the week the Arab
oil embargo was lifted indicate
customers used noticeably more
electricity than any other week in
March."
Conservation Sipping
A similar pattern was repeated
in many states, with utilities and
state agencies reporting that
conservation is slipping. They
noted, however, that Americans
still are not using the amount of
electricity they would under
normal growth patterns.
The push by city, state and
federal governments for citizens
to use car pools appears from the
AP survey to hve been a miserable
failure in most areas.
