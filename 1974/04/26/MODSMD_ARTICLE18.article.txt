## Frontrunners Lose Ground 
### 
From The Associated Press
A poll says both Democratic
and Republican front runners are
losing ground in their race for
governor, but the No. 1
contenders still see a silver lining
in the poll results.
Mervin Field's California Poll
published in two installments
Tuesday and Wednesday, said Lt.
Gov. Ed Reinecke's 30 percentage
point lead in February over
Controller Houston Flournoy in
the GOP primary has slipped to
four points.
In the Democratic race,
Secretary of State Edmund G.
Brown Jr. slipped from a 30-point
lead in February over San
Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto to
a 17-point lead over Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti, who moved
into second spot in Field's April
sampling.
'Good News' For Brown
Brown's press secretary, Doug
Faigin, said Field's current

38-21-20 breakdown for Brown,
Moretti and Alioto is "pretty
consistent with what our polls
have shown" and that it is good
news, not bad.
Faigin said he expects Brown's
lead to diminish still more as six
other major candidates continue
to get wide exposure. But he said
the rate at which the margin is
narrowing means Brown will win
the June 4 primary.
"It confirms what we thought,
and it shows Moretti has moved
up only slightly. And remember,
the poll was taken right after
heavy Moretti television
advertising. We had no television
in that period," Faigin said of the
Field poll.
Moretti Gain
Moretti, meanwhile, said his
gain of five points since February
in the Field poll, from 16 to 21
percent, is only the beginning.
Brown dropped from 52 to 38
percent and "his decrease is only

beginning. He's going to fall that
much more," a jubilant Moretti
said.
'The people are just beginning
to realize they shouldn't elect
someone governor just beause his
father was governor," Moretti
added.
On the Republican side, both
Flournoy and Reinecke read
victory in the Field poll results,
which showed Reinecke 28
percent, Flournoy 24, undecided
47 and other candidate 1 percent.
Before Reinecke's indictment
by a Watergate grand jury on
perjury charges, he led 52-22. The
Field poll said if he is cleared
before the June 4 election, he will
gain back most of that lead.
"I have asked the voters to
wait until I am cleared of the
charges against me, and the voters
are waiting. This poll shows that
when I am cleared there will be an
overwhelming turn to me by the
undecided voters," added
Reinecke, who predicted a 60-40
win over Flournoy.
