# Video Microscope Aids In Delicate Operations

### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A new video television microscope that
magnifies a surgeon's view may vastly expand microsurgery in delicate
eye and nerve operations — and eventually aid in cancer and organ
transplant surgery, its surgeon-inventor reports.
"It's the greatest advance in surgery in 100 years," said the
inventor, Dr. John P. Beale Jr. of San Francisco Eye and Ear Hospital.
He demonstrated his $85,000 machine at a recent news conference.
He said it displays on a television monitor before the surgeons eye
a three-dimensional calor image of the area on which he is operating —
magnified 16 times.
Exhausting Procedure
In the current standard procedure, surgeons repairing delicate eye
tissue or tiny nerves have to peer through a binocular-type eye piece.
The intense focus of attention is exhausting in surgery that can last
several hours, Dr. Beale said.
With the new instrument, he said, "It's almost like looking through
a little window that magnifies things."
He said watching the video image frees the surgeon to move his
head without losing sight of the magnified operation and also permits
him to glance down directly at his hands.
Fed Into Monitors
Dr. Beale said the picture can be fed into monitors and taped for
replay.
He said he has used the device in 10 operations including
procedures to correct crossed eyes and repair damaged eyelids.
Dr. Beale said he had spent $50,000 developing the instrument. It
was perfected by James Butterfield of Sherman Oaks, an engineer who
has worked on space and nuclear instruments and will market the
video microscope around the world.
He said the new microscope could have dramatic new techniques in
organ transplant and heart cancer and brain surgery.
