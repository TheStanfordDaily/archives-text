# Operation Zebra Search Declared Unconstitutional
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A
federal judge ordered police yesterday
to halt the sweeping stops of hundreds
of black men in the search for the
Zebra killers of 12 whites and said the
dragnet violates their Constitutional
rights.
"An injunction is necessary in the
interests of public tranquility," U.S.
District Court Judge Alfonso Zirpoli
said in issuing the temporary
injunction.
Police Capt. Charles Barca, head of
the Zebra investigation, said, "We are
naturally unhappy with the decision
and our legal people are consulting
now with our city attorney. An appeal
will undoubtedly be filed."
Zirpoli said the massive week-old
manhunt was unconstitutional and a
violation of black men's rights. The
operation already had been curtailed
drastically by police on Wednesday
after they said it was unproductive.
Barca said, "We will continue our
Operation Zebra, staying within the
constitutional limits as described in
Judge Zirpoli's order. And there will
be no lessening of our efforts to
apprehend the killer or killers."
Barca added, "Within our
guidelines, we will continue checking
out people who fit the profile — as
defined in our latest guidelines."
The NAACP and the American Civil

Liberties Union had filed suits
challenging Mayor Joseph Alioto's
order that police stop and search black
men fitting the description of the man
or men who killed 12 whites and
wounded six in random shootings
since last November.
About 600 blacks have been
stopped by police since last
Wednesday.
The judge said no one may be
stopped in the hunt for the Zebra
killers unless there is "other
independent evidence such as conduct
which creates a reasonable suspicion
that the person has committed or is
committing a crime.
The injunction prohibits "pat
searching, frisking or otherwise
searching any person on the ground
that the person appears to be within
the so-called profile ... unless other
independent evidence known to the
officer creates a reasonable suspicion
that such person has committed or is
committing a crime and that such
person is armed and dangerous."
The preliminary injunction also
prohibits the preparation or retaining
of field interrogation cards in violation
of the standards of his order.
Such cards had been issued to
blacks when an officer felt that more
than casual questioning was needed.
