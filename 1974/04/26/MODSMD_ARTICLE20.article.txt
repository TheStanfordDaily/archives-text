# Validity Of Mobil Ad Challenged
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Mobil Oil Co. claims in a national
television ad that drilling for oil is
a risky business since only one in
60 wells pays off. But oil industry
statistics indicate results 36 times
better.
Data obtained from the
American Petroleum Institute and
from several mjyor oil companies
appears to dispute Mobil's figures.
However, a spokesman for the oil
company said Mobil would stand
by the television spot.
Sources within the Federal
Trade Commission said that at
one time an investigation of the
Mobil ad had been suggested but
said they did not know the
current status of the matter. An
official spokesman for the FTC
would not comment.
The television ad is one of a
number that were produced for
major oil companies during the
worst stages of the energy crisis to
try to explain fuel shortages and
high prices.
API Figures
Figures compiled by the
American Petroleum Institute
show that of all new wells drilled
worldwide last year, 61.2 percent
— or three of every five — was
productive, a record 36 times
better than that claimed in
Mobil's ad.
An executive of Doyle Dane
Bernbach, the advertising agency
that created the Mobil ad, said the
ad did not refer to all wells dug
everywhere in the world, but only
to exploratory wells. Asked why
the ad didn't specify exploratory
wells, the executive, Mary
McCarthy, replied:
"We couldn't explain what an
exploratory well is because the
public wouldn't understand it."
'Wildcat' Drilling
Exploratory drilling,
sometimes called wildcatting, is
searching for oil or gas in new,
untried areas. Production drilling
is the sinking of wells where
reserves have already been proved.
The oublic records of three oil

companies — including Mobil —
showed their success rate at
wildcatting considerably higher
than one-in-60, or 1.5 percent.
Standard Oil of California, the
nation's fifth largest oil company,
drilled 33 wildcat wells in the
United States last year and five, or
15 percent, were productive.
Worldwide, Standard's success
rate was close to 17 percent.
Exxon Wells
In 1973, the Exxon Corp., the
world's largest oil company,

drilled 161 wildcat wells and 23
were commercial successes for a
14.3 percent success rate.
Mobil, the nation's third largest
oil company, drilled 51
exploratory wells and nine of
them prdduced for 21.4 percent —
or better than a one-in-five success
rate.
J.A. Gillespie, the Mobil
spokesman, defended the
television ad, saying that both the
CBS and NBC networks had
accepted it on the basis of an API

publication that used the
one-in-60 figure.
An API spokesman, J. Spair
Collins, said the figure referred
only to a narrow segment of oil
exploration.
'The figure is way off if you're
talking about all wells drilled
worldwide," he said. "Where the
one-in-60 figure applies is only for
wildcat drilling in the United
States in brand new fields where
there are no proven oil or gas
reserves."

oil company, drilled 51
exploratory wells and nine of
them prdduced for 21.4 percent —
or better than a one-in-five success
rate.
J.A. Gillespie, the Mobil
spokesman, defended the
television ad, saying that both the
CBS and NBC networks had
accepted it on the basis of an API

publication that used the
one-in-60 figure.
An API spokesman, J. Spair
Collins, said the figure referred
only to a narrow segment of oil
exploration.
'The figure is way off if you're
talking about all wells drilled
worldwide," he said. "Where the
one-in-60 figure applies is only for
wildcat drilling in the United
States in brand new fields where
there are no proven oil or gas
reserves."
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Mobil Oil Co. claims in a national
television ad that drilling for oil is
a risky business since only one in
60 wells pays off. But oil industry
statistics indicate results 36 times
better.
Data obtained from the
American Petroleum Institute and
from several mjyor oil companies
appears to dispute Mobil's figures.
However, a spokesman for the oil
company said Mobil would stand
by the television spot.
Sources within the Federal
Trade Commission said that at
one time an investigation of the
Mobil ad had been suggested but
said they did not know the
current status of the matter. An
official spokesman for the FTC
would not comment.
The television ad is one of a
number that were produced for
major oil companies during the
worst stages of the energy crisis to
try to explain fuel shortages and
high prices.
API Figures
Figures compiled by the
American Petroleum Institute
show that of all new wells drilled
worldwide last year, 61.2 percent
— or three of every five — was
productive, a record 36 times
better than that claimed in
Mobil's ad.
An executive of Doyle Dane
Bernbach, the advertising agency
that created the Mobil ad, said the
ad did not refer to all wells dug
everywhere in the world, but only
to exploratory wells. Asked why
the ad didn't specify exploratory
wells, the executive, Mary
McCarthy, replied:
"We couldn't explain what an
exploratory well is because the
public wouldn't understand it."
'Wildcat' Drilling
Exploratory drilling,
sometimes called wildcatting, is
searching for oil or gas in new,
untried areas. Production drilling
is the sinking of wells where
reserves have already been proved.
The oublic records of three oil

companies — including Mobil —
showed their success rate at
wildcatting considerably higher
than one-in-60, or 1.5 percent.
Standard Oil of California, the
nation's fifth largest oil company,
drilled 33 wildcat wells in the
United States last year and five, or
15 percent, were productive.
Worldwide, Standard's success
rate was close to 17 percent.
Exxon Wells
In 1973, the Exxon Corp., the
world's largest oil company,

drilled 161 wildcat wells and 23
were commercial successes for a
14.3 percent success rate.
Mobil, the nation's third largest
oil company, drilled 51
exploratory wells and nine of
them prdduced for 21.4 percent —
or better than a one-in-five success
rate.
