# Council: Inflation To Rise; Demos Want Controls Revived
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Amid predictions that
inflation for the remainder of the year may be
higher than previously believed, Senate Democrats
are trying to breathe new life into the
administration's dying wage and price controls
program.
But the administration says it doesn't want the
authority.
The Democratic action came as John T. Dunlop,
the head of the Cost of Living Council, predicted
that the rate of inflation for the second half of
1974 may be higher than the 5 or 6 percent
administration economists had forecast. Prices
increased at an annual rate of 10.8 percent in
January, February and March.
Administration's Objection
Issuing the administration's objection to
continuation of wage and price controls, Edgar R.
Fielder said, "For the economy as a whole, standby
authority creates more problems and more inflation
than it could ever help prevent." Fielder is assistant
secretary of the treasury for economic policy.

William E. Simon, President Nixon's nominee as
the new secretary of the treasury told the Senate
Finance Committee Wednesday he opposes any
continuation of controls except in the health and
construction industries.
Simon also came out against any income tax cut
for citizens, a move which leading Democrats favor
as a means of countering the effects of inflation.
Controls End Soon
The wage and price controls program will end
April 30 unless Congress acts to extend it.
Sen. Mike Mansfield, the Democratic majority
leader, said after Wednesday's vote by a Democratic
conference that an attempt would be made to add
the standby controls legislation to a minor bill
already on the Senate calendar. Sources said the
move likely would not come before next week.
One administration source said the Democrats
may fear they will be blamed for continuing
inflation since they had earlier rejected the
administration's plan for continuing controls on a
limited basis.
