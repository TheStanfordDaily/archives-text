Melvin Van Peebles
What The ... You Mean / Can't
Sing?!
Atlantic SD 7295
Melvin Van Peebles is many
things artistically, but definitely
not a singer. He's the one that
started the current craze of
movies featuring rugged black
heroes beating the shit out of
crooked honkies with Sweet
Sweetback's Baaaadasss Song,
produced plays on and off
Broadway, and in general was one
of the first black artists to have
total control over what he was
doing.
Unfortunately, his many
talents don't extend to being a
great singer, or even a great lyric
writer. As the producer of the
record, Van Peebles at least had
the sense to cover himself with
some of the lushest, loudest soul
arrahgements this side of Tower
of Power.
"Come On Write Me" or "My
Love Belongs To You" repeat the
song titles endlessly. Both,
unfortunately, are on the second
side, which is long and dull, with
only three songs. The first side is
somewhat better, with a laid-back
ditty about drinking
establishments, "So Many Bars,"
and a catchy-titled "A Birth
Certificate Ain't Nothing But A
Death Warrant Anyway." Overall,
though, this soul offering is about
as appetizing as a plate of
luke-warm chitterlings smothered

in hot sauce.

Check It Out
Capitol ST 11258
Tavares are here to stay! As
one of the latest additions to the
Capitol family they emerge in the
forefront as five extremely
professional and talented
performers. Their debut album
Check It Out proves to be an
excellent beginning to what I see
as a long and fruitful career.
Produced at Devonshire in
North Hollywood by Johnrty
Bristol (who also wrote five of the

albums 10 cuts), the album hails
an extremely distinguished
musical back-up unit that includes
guitarist David T. Walker, and
keyboard man Joe Sample of the
Jazz Crusaders.
Check It Out with its brisk
vocals and traditional
arrangements successfully
intertwines slow, soulful melodies
with faster rhythm reacting pieces
that cause the listener to move
with the music. Side one,
composed of five together jams
features Tavares current
Top-Of-The-Charts hit "Check It
Out," the title cut.
"Check It Out," the only song

on the album written by the team
of Butler and Osborn proves to be
my favorite. Antone "Chubby"
Tavares, leads the heart rendering
melody in such a way as to make
the listener fully understand the
message.
Side two provides enjoyment
in "Little Girl," a song written by
Billy Preston. Untypical of
Preston, "Girl" is a slow,
"wanna-testify," number of
gospel quality. Also of note on side
two is "I'm In Love," featuring
Feliciano "Butch" Tavares.
"Love," the only song on the
album written by Robert Bowles
(who also produced, arranged, and

conducted the cut), proves to be a
beautifully organized piece of
music. From the precision of the
musical unit to the euphoric voice
of the lead singer this cut emerges
as one of the albums best.
All in all, this excellent album
will prove to be a milestone in the
careers of Tavares, Check it out!

Scott Joplin
Palm Leaf Rag
Angel S-36074
Angel Records has been a
respectable classical label for
years, but never a very big money
maker. But after being caught by
surprise by the success of
"Dawn," from Also Sprach
Zarathustra, Angel was ready
when Scott Joplin finally hit the
big time.
"Dawn" became the over used
and abused "Theme from 2001"
which appeared in other movies
(Catch-22 and The Strawberry
Statement) in less noble
situations, and finally ended up
being used for numerous
commercials.
Hopefully, Scott Joplin won't
suffer the same fate now that

"The Sting" has become winner
of seven Oscars. Joplin's music
was part and parcel of the movie
and helped immeasurably to
establish the mood of the 1930s
that the film was trying to
recreate. The arrangements were
done in the style of the Angel
recording, The Red Back Book,
with fuller orchestration than
Joplin envisioned.
Joplin's joyful ragtime music,
or rags, were written for piano,
and were usually associated with
saloons and bordellos at the turn
of the century. Although Joplin
tried to remove the music from
this milieu, he failed, dying a
broken man in 1917.
It took the success of "The
Sting," though, to impress
Joplin's rags upon the popular
consciousness. The Palm Leaf Rag
album continues in the vein of The
Red Back Book, presenting Joplin
tunes in a more fully orchestrated
setting. By buying both albums,
one can hear six of the Joplin rags
that helped make "The Sting" so
popular.
This newest collection is more
joyful than most music
soundtracks, alternating between
bouncy numbers like "Palm Leaf
Rag," and "Gladiolus Rag" to the
Spanish flavored "Solace,"
featuring a dreamy melody and
just a touch of castinets.
All Joplin fans can do now is
hope this fine, upbeat music
won't be cheapened by being used
to sell salad dressing and
disposable diapers. In any case
Angel hasn't been fooled by this
latest surge of Joplin nostalgia,
like they were with "2001."
