# 'Disciplines'
## New Poetry Magazine Starts Here 
### GENE RICHIE 
Small press poetry printed in
Bay Area print shops is primarily
concerned with the antiquarian
tradition of quality publication.
This tradition emphasizes unique
design for each page.
Disciplines, a small press
publication by three Stanford
students is of this nature. Each
page and section is individual and
self contained with poetry and
drawing.
In the winter quarter (1974)
Jack Kenealy, Gene Richie and
Jill Greenwood began to pursue
the appropriate avenues to initiate
such a tradition for current voices
in poetry at Stanford. Their
proposal included the
presentation of two short acts
written by the authors of
Disciplines to be presented during
spring quarter.
Stanford is a major crossroads
for recent poetic voices.
Disciplines integrates the poetry
at Stanford with the existing, Bay
Area, small press poetry echelon.
The design and preparation of a
book for printing, the knowledge
of the printing and publication
procoss, the availability of these
factors and the nature of this
endeavor's interaction with the
student community are of value
to this University.
This is not proposed as a one
time undertaking, nor is it
proposed as a rival to any existing
literary factions on campus. Not
only does the project include the
printing of a book of poetry or
prose; it also integrates many
cooperative sources to give the
project both contact with the
academic community and
developmental depth.
SCIRE Involvement
Disciplines is integrated with
SCIRE, giving students immediate
contact with the drama
department through special

assistance of directors in a SCIRE
seminar called, "Seminar in the
Irish Theater."
This seminar will present the
two short acts written by the
authors of Disciplines and work
innovatively with academic
authorities on a study of Irish
literary history, culture and
thought during the era of Yeats
and Synge in Ireland.
SCIRE, SWOPSI aid
Undergraduate Specials have
become the sources of literary
revival at Stanford. The freedom
they give to students to choose
the literature they wish to read or
the theater they wish to present is
of value to the undergraduate
community and cannot be denied
at a school that is in any way
concerned with academic
freedom.
Charles Lyons, chairman of the
drama department, has expressed
support for this freedom as has
Mike Closson, assistant dean of
undergraduate studies; each has
assisted the formation of the
SCIRE seminar involved with
Disciplines this year.
Two Short Acts
Disciplines will present two
short acts for the Stanford
community and a poetry reading
in Tresidder large lounge on
Thursday evening May 23rd at 8
p.m. A one dollar admission fee
for the two short acts will include
the price of the book. The poetry
reading is free and will involve
several undergraduates.
After the short acts have been
presented the book will be
available at the Stanford
Bookstore in anticipation of the
reading on May 23rd. The book
will also be put on consignment at
City Lights Bookstore, San
Francisco and Serendipity
Bookstore, Berkeley.
Jack Shoemaker of the
Serendipity Bookstore has a

current press operation called
Sand Dollar. He contacts certain
individual fine letter presses such
as Arif in Berkeley and Cranium
Press (Clifford Burke) in San
Francisco to do his printing.
Handset Type
Shoemaker's current
operations are fine letter presses
with handset type in the most
antiquarian fashion lending
flexibility to page design. He has
printed books such as Book of
Janna by Micheal McClure and
Ceasar's Gate with special
permission of Robert Duncan, a
modern American poet born in
Oakland. Shoemaker presents an
alternative to the usual forms of
commercial design for poets who
wish to publish in a printing field
of excellence.
Printing Agent
Walt Justus, the printing agent
for Disciplines, is a Palo Alto
resident. He has called design "the
visual aspect of the book in the
mind's eye." He encourages small

press composition through open
field design, that is, "you can read
it and appreciate it for its beauty,
but you can't describe it."
The quality is in the
arrangement on the page. Justus
says, "you don't know then what
a book is until you have made
something physical of it." This
method leaves no preconception
to block the originaltiy of design
and typography.
Various papers are available in
small press operations. The most
antiquarian is a laid paper.
Hardwoods have the longest fibers
and are the most durable. Chips
are cut up at a pulp mill and
mixed into solution at a paper
mill.
Manufacturing
The desired whitener is added
with zinc and clay. An eighty inch
screen is prepared with the
solution and set into a vacuum
box. A web of paper forms which
is transferred onto felt rollers to
extract the water out of the

cellulose fibers.
Discipline has remained as
close as possible to the
antiquarian tradition of small
press poetry. Justus regards small
press publication as "initiation
into publishing," that is, "ready
for the world to see."
The book is a celebration of
community. A 1 Young, an
American poet teaching at
Stanford, has voiced this
celebration in his introduction:
".. . meaningfully romantic and
less concerned with mere
self-expression than with touching
the feelings of others."
The short acts, "Shelter," a
dance play, and "Captain Billy" a
dialogue with a young student are
intended to please, yet they
sustain the depths of human
experience.
Advance sale tickets for the
two short acts to be presented
Thursday May 9th, Friday May
10th and Saturday May 11th are
now on sale at Wilbur and Stern.
