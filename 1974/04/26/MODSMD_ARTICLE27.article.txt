# BBC's 'War And Peace' Perfects A Classic
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
What is the most enthralling, enchanting, philosophical,
escapist series currently being rerun on Bay Area
television?
Granted that Star Trek seems to be the obvious answer,
this review does not present an argument for escape into
man's cloudy future, but rather suggests that equally
exciting fare can be found in a return to czarist Russia.
At first the idea that watching something as classical as
the BBC version of Tolstoy's War and Peace can be
relaxing, even pleasurable, may seem a little crazy to those
who think television is best taken in small doses and at an
intellectual level commensurate with The Hogan's Heroes
Hour.
Yet, 15 minutes into the fourth segment of the nine
part series — without having seen the first three parts —
this reviewer must admit that she was hooked. For the
next five weeks, she was compelled to seek out a television
set at the appointed hour and flip the dial to KQED,
Channel 9 — an act which can in itself prove controversial.

For those who missed the December-January showing
of War and Peace, KQED is reshowing it Thursday
evenings at 9 p.m. with a repeat broadcast Saturday at 9
p.m. The repeat showing of part two is tomorrow.
Because the production pays such close attention to
every detail of costuming, set design, and continuity
throughout the 13 hour drama, and because the acting is
absolutely superb, one could start watching the series at
almost any time and not feel lost.
The acting in particular provides a realism and human
quality which is immensely appealing. Anthony Hopkins
as Pierre Bezuhov is perfect as the bumbling, kind-hearted
protagonist. His evolution from illegitimate son of a
nobleman to legitimized heir to prisoner of Napoleon's
army and back to nobleman is carried out perfectly.
Hopkins' performance in the last two episodes of the series
is particularly good.
Morag Hood's transition from child to wife as Natasha
Rostova shows her to be an actress of exceptional talent.
Hood supplies both the childlike exuberance and the

maturity necessary to make this role — the central role —
convincing.
Alan Dobie is cast as the moody and disenchanted
Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. His role provides the
counterpoint both to Hopkins and Hood, providing much
of the impetus for philosophical questioning among all of
the characters. Dobie is neither too pretty not too cold for
the part, and the result is an Andrei who is both attractive
yet distant in an ideal equilibrium.
To say that all the acting is excellent would not be an
overstatement; it is doubtful that such an overwhelming
mass of acting talent has appeared in one production
before, whether on film, tape, or stage.
If you want a quality hour and a half of television, War
and Peace is probably unequaled. Granting first that
Tolstoy's novel is one of the greatest ever written, the BBC
has added its talents to create what may be a perfect
statement of what it means to be human and to know the
agony of war.

next five weeks, she was compelled to seek out a television
set at the appointed hour and flip the dial to KQED,
Channel 9 — an act which can in itself prove controversial.

For those who missed the December-January showing
of War and Peace, KQED is reshowing it Thursday
evenings at 9 p.m. with a repeat broadcast Saturday at 9
p.m. The repeat showing of part two is tomorrow.
Because the production pays such close attention to
every detail of costuming, set design, and continuity
throughout the 13 hour drama, and because the acting is
absolutely superb, one could start watching the series at
almost any time and not feel lost.
The acting in particular provides a realism and human
quality which is immensely appealing. Anthony Hopkins
as Pierre Bezuhov is perfect as the bumbling, kind-hearted
protagonist. His evolution from illegitimate son of a
nobleman to legitimized heir to prisoner of Napoleon's
army and back to nobleman is carried out perfectly.
Hopkins' performance in the last two episodes of the series
is particularly good.
Morag Hood's transition from child to wife as Natasha
Rostova shows her to be an actress of exceptional talent.
Hood supplies both the childlike exuberance and the

maturity necessary to make this role — the central role —
convincing.
Alan Dobie is cast as the moody and disenchanted
Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. His role provides the
counterpoint both to Hopkins and Hood, providing much
of the impetus for philosophical questioning among all of
the characters. Dobie is neither too pretty not too cold for
the part, and the result is an Andrei who is both attractive
yet distant in an ideal equilibrium.
To say that all the acting is excellent would not be an
overstatement; it is doubtful that such an overwhelming
mass of acting talent has appeared in one production
before, whether on film, tape, or stage.
If you want a quality hour and a half of television, War
and Peace is probably unequaled. Granting first that
Tolstoy's novel is one of the greatest ever written, the BBC
has added its talents to create what may be a perfect
statement of what it means to be human and to know the
agony of war.
What is the most enthralling, enchanting, philosophical,
escapist series currently being rerun on Bay Area
television?
Granted that Star Trek seems to be the obvious answer,
this review does not present an argument for escape into
man's cloudy future, but rather suggests that equally
exciting fare can be found in a return to czarist Russia.
At first the idea that watching something as classical as
the BBC version of Tolstoy's War and Peace can be
relaxing, even pleasurable, may seem a little crazy to those
who think television is best taken in small doses and at an
intellectual level commensurate with The Hogan's Heroes
Hour.
Yet, 15 minutes into the fourth segment of the nine
part series — without having seen the first three parts —
this reviewer must admit that she was hooked. For the
