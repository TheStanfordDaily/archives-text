# Season Frustrates 'Robby', Cards' Top League Hitter
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
It had been a sunny afternoon,
but now the chill of twilight was
beginning to drift into Sunken
Diamond. Looking at the faces of
the few ballplayers left in the
dugout the gloom of defeat,
frustration and lethargy seemed
already firmly entrenched on their
faces. You could see it on the face
of a young, slim, Stanford
outfielder named Bruce Robinson.
It was the mirror of dejection.
This scene happened last
Saturday afternoon after the
Cards, with A 1 Arthur working on
a no-hitter, lost a 3-2 heartbreaker
to Cal in the ninth inning.
For Robinson and the
Cardinals the frustration of defeat
has been everpresent this season.
But Robinson and the others are
learning to live with it. In fact,
Robinson has overcome
frustration enough to become
Stanford's top hitter at the end of
the first round of the Pacific Eight I
Southern Division.
Stanford, 3-6 in conference
play and 14-21 overall, plays host
to UCLA (4-5) this afternoon at
2:30 in Sunken Diamond. The
Cards play the Bruins in a
doubleheader beginning at noon
tomorrow. KZSU (90.1 FM) will
broadcast today's game and the
second game of the twinbill,
beginning at 2:30 each day.
Climbing Average
Robinson, a sophomore, has
hit in all seven conference games
he has played in to bring his
average up to .391 in conference
play and .244 overall.
"God, it's been a frustrating
year," said Robinson, who began

the season slowly dipping to .143
by the time the Cards went to the
Riverside Tournament during
spring break.
"I think I've learned
frustration," said Robinson.
"Riverside seems to bring the
good out of me."
Last year, as a freshman,
Robinson went to Riverside to
play for the varsity for the first
time. And, he made the most of
the opportunity, hitting over .400
for the week.
Opened Stance
This year, a season of ups and
downs for the Cards, Robinson
has managed to endure the travails
of the season. "Coach [Ray]
Young told me to open up my
stance a little so I wouldn't get
jammed [on the inside pitch],"
said Robinson. "I feel a lot
quicker with the bat, now."
Young explains Robinson's
i "hot bat." "I think the
1 biggest thing is that he had to
have some success to give him
confidence," said Young.
"Another thing that has been a
big factor is that we've had
something on — either the
hit-and-run or the bunt — when
he's come up to bat giving him
more responsibility. There's no
question about it that he's the
most reliable bunter on the
team." Robinson leads the team
with six sacrifice bunts.
Young gave Robinson every
opportunity to improve himself
by taking extra batting practice.
And, he even put "Robby," a
lefthanded batter, up in an
unusual situation, one time
placing him in the designated

hitter spot against a lefthanded
pitcher.
Pitching Rotation
The pitching rotation for the
Cards is the same as it was last
week. Dave Frost (3-5) will pitch
today with Mike Williamson (3-3)
throwing the seven-inning opener
tomorrow and A 1 Arthur (2-5)
scheduled for the nightcap.
In Arthur's last outing
Saturday the lanky junior
righthander was nearly flawless in
the first eight innings, allowing
but two base runners and nary a
hit. But in a disastrous ninth he
gave up a double, a bunt for a
base hit and two sacrifice flies to
lose.
"It was the worst loss I've ever
had," said Arthur. "I was thinking
more about not getting the
no-hitter than getting it. I threw a
horrible pitch to the guy that hit
the double."
UCLA's leading hitter is Mike
Edwards (.337 overall) with 12
home runs and 35 runs batted in.
The scheduled pitchers for the
Bruins are Steve Bianchi (9-2)
today, Brad Ross (2-3) and Ed
Cowan (2-5) tomorrow.
Stanford's top hitter for the
season is Kim Hannaford (.333).
Bob Hampton leads with 34 runs
batted in and Mark Lucich has
slugged seven home runs.
