# Pro Prognosis
## Unchanged Pick 
### Don Tollefson 
Since most sportswriters are terrible prognosticators, they never
fail to constantly remind people of their brilliance whenever they get
lucky and pick one right. Since I enjoy breaking traditions, I'm not
going to remind you of my prediction made earlier this year that the
Philadelphia Flyers had an outstanding chance to win the Stanley
Cup. Instead of reminding you, I'll just repeat that brilliant
prediction.
The Broad Street Bullies still have a number of obstacles to
overcome, but they are a lot further along than many people ever
thought they would be after the pundits predicted long-term Montreal
domination when the Stanley Cup returned to Montreal for the fourth
time in six years last spring.
At that time, many of the experts were predicting another
Yankee-like tenure at the top. For those of you who missed Mt,
Montreal was eliminated this year in the quarterfinals by New York.
The Rangers have a recent history of knocking off defending
champions in preliminary rounds, but they themselves haven't won a
cup since 1940. With the Knicks derailed, the Rangers have become
Gotham's greatest hope and after the New Yorkers easily eliminated
Montreal, Madison Square Garden fans had visions of a Stanley Cup
dancing in their heads. But the arrogant young Flyers have other
ideas.
Everyone expected the Flyers to brutally dispose of Atlanta in the
opening round — and they did. Everyone expected the Flyers to
present the Rangers with countless bumps and bruises — and they
have not let people down in this regard either. But only the
Philadelphia faithful, who have endured decades of athletic
incompetence, expected the Flyers to whip the Rangers in the first
two games of their semifinal series. But that's exactly what they did.
Enjoyable Hockey
Hockey may seem a bit alien to many sun-soaked Californians, but
I defy any true sports fan to deny that watching the Flyers play is
exciting. Anyone who enjoys the drama, speed and unpredicatbility of
sport at its best has to enjoy a Flyers' game.
I am sure there are enough transplanted Easterners and enlightened
Californians in this area to make telecasting of hockey a viable affair.
But possibly because they misinterpret Seals' attendance figures as
being indicative of a lack of hockey popularity instead of a reaction to
incompetence, the KRON decisionmakers decided to limit Stanley
Cup telecasts in the Bay Area.
At a time when as many as four NBA playoff games are telecast
during one week, only one Stanely Cup game is seen on Sunday. Some
of the weeknight games in the final round may be televised according
to a KRON spokeswoman, but I am sure a large number of Bay Area
sports fans would have enjoyed seeing one of the first two
Flyers-Rangers games.
Other Teams
Enough for television criticism. Getting back to predictions, I'd
better run down the other three Cup contenders before I get a
predictable stream of fan mail. The Rangers do have a sizeable amount
of talent, insanely rabid fans and a great hunger for the Cup which has
eluded them for so long. But Philadelphia has more talent and should
win the series in five games and move on to face the winner of the
Boston-Chicago series.
Two seasons ago, the Boston Bruins were the kings of the NHL and
everyone talked about a Boston dynasty in the same way they talked
about Montreal last year. But last season a combination of personnel
changes and complacency led to Boston's rapid demise. Phil Esposito
was knocked out of the opening round series with New York due to a
knee injury, but I am confident the Bruins would have been
eliminated anyway.
Goalie Gerry Cheevers has been sorely missed by the Bruins for
two seasons now and the determination of Derek Sanderson hasn't
helped either. But Esposito, who scored 68 goals during the regular
season, and hockey's finest player, Bobby Orr, are so good that the
Bruins still may be able to regain the heights they achieved two years
ago.
Hawks Determined
Bobby Hull and the Black Hawks used to be synonymous, but now
Chicago is playing very well for the second straight season without the
Golden Jet. Phil Esposito's brother Tony is a fine goalie and when an
old-timer like Stan Mikita can play like he did Tuesday night in
leading the Hawks to a dramatic 4-3 overtime victory, Chicago
opponents are in trouble. Still, I look for Boston to rebound and win
in seven.
The finals are going to be interesting no matter who plays in them.
Philadelphia is a team trying desperately to show that the expansion
teams of the late 60s have reached full maturity. New York is trying
to shake the image of a perennial close-but-no-cigar team. Boston is
trying to regain the glory it lost as quickly as it had been gained. And
the Hawks are trying to prove they can win it all without Number
Nine.
I am going to be brash and predict that Philadelphia will prove to
be the finest of these four talented hockey teams. They should top
Boston in six games. Even if they don't, the Flyers have brought some
much needed civic pride to Philadelphia. Even W. C. Fields would
have to admit that.

old-timer like Stan Mikita can play like he did Tuesday night in
leading the Hawks to a dramatic 4-3 overtime victory, Chicago
opponents are in trouble. Still, I look for Boston to rebound and win
in seven.
The finals are going to be interesting no matter who plays in them.
Philadelphia is a team trying desperately to show that the expansion
teams of the late 60s have reached full maturity. New York is trying
to shake the image of a perennial close-but-no-cigar team. Boston is
trying to regain the glory it lost as quickly as it had been gained. And
the Hawks are trying to prove they can win it all without Number
Nine.
I am going to be brash and predict that Philadelphia will prove to
be the finest of these four talented hockey teams. They should top
Boston in six games. Even if they don't, the Flyers have brought some
much needed civic pride to Philadelphia. Even W. C. Fields would
have to admit that.
Since most sportswriters are terrible prognosticators, they never
fail to constantly remind people of their brilliance whenever they get
lucky and pick one right. Since I enjoy breaking traditions, I'm not
going to remind you of my prediction made earlier this year that the
Philadelphia Flyers had an outstanding chance to win the Stanley
Cup. Instead of reminding you, I'll just repeat that brilliant
prediction.
The Broad Street Bullies still have a number of obstacles to
overcome, but they are a lot further along than many people ever
thought they would be after the pundits predicted long-term Montreal
domination when the Stanley Cup returned to Montreal for the fourth
time in six years last spring.
At that time, many of the experts were predicting another
Yankee-like tenure at the top. For those of you who missed Mt,
Montreal was eliminated this year in the quarterfinals by New York.
The Rangers have a recent history of knocking off defending
champions in preliminary rounds, but they themselves haven't won a
cup since 1940. With the Knicks derailed, the Rangers have become
Gotham's greatest hope and after the New Yorkers easily eliminated
Montreal, Madison Square Garden fans had visions of a Stanley Cup
dancing in their heads. But the arrogant young Flyers have other
ideas.
Everyone expected the Flyers to brutally dispose of Atlanta in the
opening round — and they did. Everyone expected the Flyers to
present the Rangers with countless bumps and bruises — and they
have not let people down in this regard either. But only the
Philadelphia faithful, who have endured decades of athletic
incompetence, expected the Flyers to whip the Rangers in the first
two games of their semifinal series. But that's exactly what they did.
Enjoyable Hockey
Hockey may seem a bit alien to many sun-soaked Californians, but
I defy any true sports fan to deny that watching the Flyers play is
exciting. Anyone who enjoys the drama, speed and unpredicatbility of
sport at its best has to enjoy a Flyers' game.
I am sure there are enough transplanted Easterners and enlightened
Californians in this area to make telecasting of hockey a viable affair.
But possibly because they misinterpret Seals' attendance figures as
being indicative of a lack of hockey popularity instead of a reaction to
incompetence, the KRON decisionmakers decided to limit Stanley
Cup telecasts in the Bay Area.
At a time when as many as four NBA playoff games are telecast
during one week, only one Stanely Cup game is seen on Sunday. Some
of the weeknight games in the final round may be televised according
to a KRON spokeswoman, but I am sure a large number of Bay Area
sports fans would have enjoyed seeing one of the first two
Flyers-Rangers games.
Other Teams
Enough for television criticism. Getting back to predictions, I'd
better run down the other three Cup contenders before I get a
predictable stream of fan mail. The Rangers do have a sizeable amount
of talent, insanely rabid fans and a great hunger for the Cup which has
eluded them for so long. But Philadelphia has more talent and should
win the series in five games and move on to face the winner of the
Boston-Chicago series.
Two seasons ago, the Boston Bruins were the kings of the NHL and
everyone talked about a Boston dynasty in the same way they talked
about Montreal last year. But last season a combination of personnel
changes and complacency led to Boston's rapid demise. Phil Esposito
was knocked out of the opening round series with New York due to a
knee injury, but I am confident the Bruins would have been
eliminated anyway.
Goalie Gerry Cheevers has been sorely missed by the Bruins for
two seasons now and the determination of Derek Sanderson hasn't
helped either. But Esposito, who scored 68 goals during the regular
season, and hockey's finest player, Bobby Orr, are so good that the
Bruins still may be able to regain the heights they achieved two years
ago.
Hawks Determined
Bobby Hull and the Black Hawks used to be synonymous, but now
Chicago is playing very well for the second straight season without the
Golden Jet. Phil Esposito's brother Tony is a fine goalie and when an
old-timer like Stan Mikita can play like he did Tuesday night in

Two seasons ago, the Boston Bruins were the kings of the NHL and
everyone talked about a Boston dynasty in the same way they talked
about Montreal last year. But last season a combination of personnel
changes and complacency led to Boston's rapid demise. Phil Esposito
was knocked out of the opening round series with New York due to a
knee injury, but I am confident the Bruins would have been
eliminated anyway.
Goalie Gerry Cheevers has been sorely missed by the Bruins for
two seasons now and the determination of Derek Sanderson hasn't
helped either. But Esposito, who scored 68 goals during the regular
season, and hockey's finest player, Bobby Orr, are so good that the
Bruins still may be able to regain the heights they achieved two years
ago.
Hawks Determined
Bobby Hull and the Black Hawks used to be synonymous, but now
Chicago is playing very well for the second straight season without the
Golden Jet. Phil Esposito's brother Tony is a fine goalie and when an
old-timer like Stan Mikita can play like he did Tuesday night in
leading the Hawks to a dramatic 4-3 overtime victory, Chicago
opponents are in trouble. Still, I look for Boston to rebound and win
in seven.
The finals are going to be interesting no matter who plays in them.
Philadelphia is a team trying desperately to show that the expansion
teams of the late 60s have reached full maturity. New York is trying
to shake the image of a perennial close-but-no-cigar team. Boston is
trying to regain the glory it lost as quickly as it had been gained. And
the Hawks are trying to prove they can win it all without Number
Nine.
I am going to be brash and predict that Philadelphia will prove to
be the finest of these four talented hockey teams. They should top
Boston in six games. Even if they don't, the Flyers have brought some
much needed civic pride to Philadelphia. Even W. C. Fields would
have to admit that.
