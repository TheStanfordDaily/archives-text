# Committee Polls Freshmen
## ROTC Group Seeks Support 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
A student-faculty group calling
itself the "Stanford Committee on
ROTC" has mailed letters and
questionnaires to some 1500
freshmen, in an attempt to measure
possible student interest in a new
version of the controversial 'military
training program.
Members of the group, which is not
an official University committee, hope
a show of student interest in a revived
Reserve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) here will influence the
Faculty Senate toward reinstating the
program.
Applied Physics graduate student
Robert J. Barker, a member of the
group, said the questionnaire's results
will be released next week.

"The returns so far are rather
impressive," Barker said yesterday.
"We've exceeded the figure we
established as a figure that will force
the issue. And among those who
responded, the attitude toward ROTC
is extremely positive."
(On May 7, 1970, after weeks of
anti-ROTC demonstrations, the
Faculty Senate voted 36 to 8 to close
ROTC "as presently constituted" to
new enrollment. Last fall, Barker
gathered some 50 faculty signatures,
forcing the issue onto the Faculty
Senate agenda. On Jan. 25, 1974, the
Senate voted 29 to 12 to postpone the
question indefinitely. One reason cited
for the Senate's action was the absence
of demonstrated student interest in a
new military training program.)
The letter to freshmen emphasizes
the availability of full-tuition
scholarships to students enrolled in an
ROTC program. It says the program's
"reinstitution is being seriously
considered," and promises: "If
sufficient interest exists, the program
will be brought back."
Assistant to the President William
Stone said he believes the letter may
be "misleading."
"It's pretty oversimplified," Stone
said. "It's really a question of
definition of the program, of what
kind of courses would be permissible,
of financial aid, of the presence of
some kind of 'penal clause' in the
student's contract, and a whole host of
other things. The Faculty Senate
tabled the whole matter indefinitely.
To say that after a poll of freshmen, if
x percent of those who return their
ballots are interested, the program will
be brought back — that's quite
misleading."
Barker was more optimistic. "It
depends on who you talk to in the
Administration," he said. "President
Lyman comes out with statements in
our favor occasionally, but he hasn't
committed himself one way or
another, and with some justification.
Without any indication of student
support, the ROTC issue has simply
been an intellectual debate. Our survey
should charfge that."
Barker said the Committee on
ROTC includes "a couple dozen
faculty who are active," and about an
equal number of students. He said the
mailing was paid for by "contributions
solicited from the Stanford
community" and was mailed through
the Registrar's office.
