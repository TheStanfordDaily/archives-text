# Olympic Club Wins Volleyball Match
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
In a display of
excellent-but-dull volleyball The
Olympic Club of San Francisco
routinely routed the San Jose
YMCA 15-10, 15-7 in a Maples
Pavilion exhibition Wednesday
night as part of the "Send
Stanford to the Nationals"
tripleheader.
Olympic, the California and
Western Regional champion,
played a flashy, fast offense paced
by the booming hits of Tom
Krause and the sets of Ron
Clausen and Dave Weston. The

Olympic offense featured
numerous short sets to Krause and
repeated intricate fakes to confuse
San Jose's defense.
Krause played on the last
United States Olympic team and
during his career has been named
to just about every all-anything
team.
Krause's impressive hitting was
complemented nicely by former
Stanford star Jim lams' defense,
lams made several spectacular
diving digs—one in which he
turned completely around in
mid-air to save the ball.

The first game of the
exhibition was a see-saw affair
with the scoring coming largely
off the other's miscues. Olympic
won the game 15-10.
In the second game San Jose
came to life and led 5-0 largely on
the hitting heroics of Bruce
Downing. However, the hitting of
Krause off some pretty Weston
sets brought Olympic back and
they rolled to an easy 15-7
victory.
Olympic was playing without
its top star and lams said, "this
was a low-keyed match for us.
We're sort of relaxing after the
regionals and we were here
tonight to aide a good cause."
The cause was the Stanford
Women's volleyball team, to
which all proceeds from the
match went. The Stanford
women, hoping to raise enough
money to travel to the nationals,
fell to the superior California
State Champions from the
Oakland YMCA 5-515, 11-15,
8-15, in the prelim to the
Olympic-San Jose match.
Oakland controlled the tempo
of the match, and was in
command from start to finish.
Stanford threatened to make it a
match in the second game but fell
victim to its own miscues.
Iri the day's third match,

Stanford's laughing Men's team
lost to Cabrillo College 13-15,
11-15, 16-14, 6-15. The Men's
team has become somewhat of a
joke this quarter losing its top two
players (lams and Steve Hoch) to
graduation and several others to
the Intramural courts.
Cabrillo clearly outclassed the
Card squad, which at least was
having a good time. The Men's
team will meet Wilt's Big Dippers
again this Spring — May 24 — in
Maples. The Dippers, featuring
Wilt Chamberlain, beat the Cards
in four games last year before a
crowd of 3,000.


WORLD S BEST FOURSOME—On April 17 these Stanford runners (1 to r), Matt Hogsett (52.2), Dave Bagshaw (55.9), Reggie Mason (55.0),
Ken Kring (54.7) established a new world record in the Mile Intermediate Hurdle Relay by running the four lap event in 3:37.8. Hogsett
indicated that the foursome would run the event again "if some other school breaks our record."
