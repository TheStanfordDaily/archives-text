# Spring Rerun
## Netters Lead Ojai 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Undoubtedly, the Southern
California mountain resort of Ojai
has been the scene of many
movies and TV shows. Yesterday,
it hosted a rerun.
For the second year in a row,
Stanford's varsity tennis team
qualified four of its six singles
entries into the quarterfinals of
the Pacific Eight division of the
Ojai Intercollegiates, and took the
lead with 10 points, compared to
seven for UCLA, six for USC and
five for California.
Coach Dick Gould hopes rerun
season ends here, however. Last
season, the Cardinals completely
blew the lead on Friday and
barely managed to hold on for a
one-point win of the Thatcher
Cup.
Today's pairings match Cal's
Trey Waltke with Sandy Mayer,
Pat DuPre with UCLA's Brian
Teacher, Jim Delaney with the
Bruins' Steve Mott in a repeat of
last week's thrilling Maples match
and John Whitlinger with USC's
John Andrews.
Only Stanford's bottom two
players failed to qualify. Mark
Mitchell lost to USC's Butch Walts

in the first round, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4,
while Nick Saviano, after beating
UCLA's Dave Parker 6-2, 6-4, fell
to Andrews 6-3, 1-6, 6-3 in the
second round.
Stanford's four qualifiers all
were exempted from first round
play. In the second round,
Delaney topped Cal's Doug King
6-4, 7-5, Whitlinger beat the
Bears' Peter Campbell 7-6, 6-4 and
Mayer downed UCLA's Spencer
Segura 7-5, 6-3. DuPre qualified in
an unusual way when in the midst
of a 7-6, 3-6, 5-5 match with SC's
Mike Wayman when the latter
literally "tightened up" and had
to default.
In doubles play, only
Saviano-Mitchell had to qualify
for the quarters and they did,
beating Wayman-Martolin 6-3
7-5.
In the concurrent open
division, both Chico Hagey and
Gene Mayer, in singles and at
doubles, won their matches.
In the women's collegiate
division, Tracy McNair aced
UC-Riverside's Michelle Gurbada
6-0, 6-0, while the doubles team
of Terry Albert-Whitney Grant
also won.

Stanford's varsity tennis team
qualified four of its six singles
entries into the quarterfinals of
the Pacific Eight division of the
Ojai Intercollegiates, and took the
lead with 10 points, compared to
seven for UCLA, six for USC and
five for California.
Coach Dick Gould hopes rerun
season ends here, however. Last
season, the Cardinals completely
blew the lead on Friday and
barely managed to hold on for a
one-point win of the Thatcher
Cup.
Today's pairings match Cal's
Trey Waltke with Sandy Mayer,
Pat DuPre with UCLA's Brian
Teacher, Jim Delaney with the
Bruins' Steve Mott in a repeat of
last week's thrilling Maples match
and John Whitlinger with USC's
John Andrews.
Only Stanford's bottom two
players failed to qualify. Mark
Mitchell lost to USC's Butch Walts

in the first round, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4,
while Nick Saviano, after beating
UCLA's Dave Parker 6-2, 6-4, fell
to Andrews 6-3, 1-6, 6-3 in the
second round.
Stanford's four qualifiers all
were exempted from first round
play. In the second round,
Delaney topped Cal's Doug King
6-4, 7-5, Whitlinger beat the
Bears' Peter Campbell 7-6, 6-4 and
Mayer downed UCLA's Spencer
Segura 7-5, 6-3. DuPre qualified in
an unusual way when in the midst
of a 7-6, 3-6, 5-5 match with SC's
Mike Wayman when the latter
literally "tightened up" and had
to default.
In doubles play, only
Saviano-Mitchell had to qualify
for the quarters and they did,
beating Wayman-Martolin 6-3
7-5.
In the concurrent open
division, both Chico Hagey and
Gene Mayer, in singles and at
doubles, won their matches.
In the women's collegiate
division, Tracy McNair aced
UC-Riverside's Michelle Gurbada
6-0, 6-0, while the doubles team
of Terry Albert-Whitney Grant
also won.
