# Bizarre Stories Spice Golf Tourney

### DAVE ROBINSON 
Scoreboard watchers were treated to an
unending series of stories, excuses and
exaggerations yesterday as 30 teams
completed first round play in the seventh
annual U.S. Collegiate Invitational on the
Stanford golf course.
But nobody could match the saga of
Sacramento State's Greg Oxendine.
There were only a few shivering coaches
and players still on the scene when Oxendine
practically knocked down the flagstick with
his second shot on the 454-yard 18th hole.
Nobody noticed when he curled in the
ensuing three-foot birdie putt.
But Oxendine, one of the few black
players in collegiate golf, had a story to tell
as he walked off the green at 7:15 p.m., the
last of 180 competitors on a day that began
13 hours earlier.
"What did you shoot?" a reporter asked.
"I had 33 on the back nine," Oxendine
replied.
"What about the front?"
"Well, I shot 46."
There had to be an explanation, and
Oxendine obliged. "I've never felt so
uncomfortable in my life," he said of a
painful front nine experience apparently
caused by a hamburger and a milkshake he
ate for lunch.

The resulting problems in Oxendine's
lower digestive tract weren't remedied until
he dashed to the clubhouse after the front
nine. Sufficiently relieved, Oxendine
chopped 13 strokes off his front nine total
for a two-under-par 33.
A less spectacular but more significant 33
was recorded by defending Pacific Eight
champion Mark Pfeil of USC, who grabbed a
share of the lead with a 36-33-69. San Jose
State's Eric Batten joined Pfeil atop the
leader board with nines of 34-35.
In the team competition, top-ranked USC
compiled a 292 first-day total, followed by
defending NCAA small college champion
Cal-State Northridge at 295. Stanford and
San Jose State shared third at 296.
But those stories were more conventional
— hardly a match for the antics of Oxendine,
Barry Ruhl of Pacific and Bob Harrington, a
Stanford senior whose even-par 71 didn't
help his Cardinal team.
By way of explanation, Harrington is
competing unattached, as are two other
members of the Stanford team who failed to
qualify for the Cardinal varsity or JV units.
So Harrington's even-par performance earned
accolades and individual gratification, but
only a minor headache for coach Bud Finger.
Meanwhile, Ruhl began his round with an
eagle on the par five first hole, an proceeded

to birdie the second, birdie the third, par the
fourth and birdie the fifth - five under par
for the first five holes. A subsequent collapse
— well, choke — brought Ruhl down to earth
with a score of 32-42—74.
Stanford's varsity suffered from similar
inconsistency. Aly Trompas and Dave
Baskins each stayed in the running with 735,
but Trompas said he accomplished his
two-over-par total "with great difficulty."
Still, he managed to chip in for a birdie on 13
and save countless pars with miraculous chips
and trouble shots.
Glenn Goethels overcame mid-round
putting woes to shoot 74, but George
Pettinger never recovered from a disastrous
seven on the ninth hole. Pettinger, who was
two under par at the time, finished with 76.
Stanford's non-counting scores (only the
top four count toward the team total), were
an 80 by defending champion Conrad
Nilmeier, and Brent Murray's 77.
Murray was paired with Craig Stadler of
USC, and watched the long-hitting U.S.
Amateur champion shoot a pedestrian 72.
All the Stanford and USC players tee off
between 10:52 and 11:32 this morning.
After today's second round, the field will be
trimmed to the low 16 teams and all
individuals within 10 shots of the leader.
The low scorers will tee off around noon
for tomorrow's final 18 holes.
