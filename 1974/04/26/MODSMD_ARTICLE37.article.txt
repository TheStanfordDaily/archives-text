# 11 Spikers Enter Relays
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Most of the Stanford track
team will spend this weekend
preparing for next Saturday's Big
Meet with Cal. But for 11 Cards,
Saturday will mean the same
calibre of competition they faced
against UCLAâ€”and then some.
Today, Stanford's best field
and short distance athletes travel
to Southern California to
participate in the Mt. San Antonio
Relays held all day tomorrow in
Walnut.
'The Mt. Sac meet is one of
the big relay meets in the
country," sand Peyton Jordan,
Stanford coach. "There are only a
couple of other meets where the
quality of the athletes is equal to
this one. The qualifying standards
are incredible; for instance the
qualifying mark for the pole vault
is 16-8, for the 880 it is
1:50.0....
"Some of the country's best
pole vaulters, discus throwers and
sprinters will be there. USC and
UCLA will be there, but they
won't extend themselves, because
they'll be doing what we are
doing; aiming for the big meet.
With them holding back like that,
the more relaxed teams often can
do very well."
The Northern California Field
Athlete of the Week, Mike Hall,
who was so named for his lifetime
best triple jump of 49-llVi against
UCLA last week, will lead a Card
two man contingent in the field.
Steve Hopkins will compete in the
javelin, trying to improve on his
best of 224-9.
Tony Sandoval, another big
performer last week, qualified for
the two-mile, but will only run on
the distance medley relay. "We
are pointing Sandy and several
other athletes for the Pac-8
championships; we don't want
him running one too many
two-miles," said Jordan.
Leading off the medley will be
Ken Kring in the 440, followed by
Ben Schieble in the 880, Sandoval
in the 1320 (three laps) and Steve
Crowley will anchor with a mile.
Card ace hurdlers Matt Hogsett
and Dave Bagshaw will be entered
in the intermediates, while
Bagshaw also runs the college
division 120 highs. Scott Wingo
and Bruce Henry join the two
hurdlers on the mile relay.
Marvin Holmes rounds out the
Stanford delegation with entry in
the college division 100 yard dash.
