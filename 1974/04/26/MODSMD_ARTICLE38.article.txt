Portuguese Army Ousts Premier
LISBON, Portugal — Rebellious troops pledging
democracy at home and an end to the costly war
against black independence movements in Portugal's
African territories overthrew the authoritarian
government of Premier Marcello Caetano yesterday.
Gen. Antonio de Spinola, apparent leader of a
new military junta, went on national radio and
television early today to promise freedom of
thought and speech, free elections to the National
Assembly and "justice with the citizen having his
rights."
Delirious crowds surged through the streets of
Lisbon last night and a navy ship fired a triumphal
salvo. Unconfirmed reports said at least four persons
had been killed in Lisbon, including a police
inspector.
Rebel broadcasts said Caetano, 68, and several of
his Cabinet ministers had presented their
resignations to Gen. Antonio de Spinola after tanks
surrounded them at police headquarters in
downtown Lisbon. Caetano's resignation would
signify the end of the authoritarian civilian regime
that the late Antonio de Oliveira Salazar set up in
1932.
The newspaper O Seculo said Caetano later was
escorted to a plane — reportedly by Spinola — and
forced to leave for the Portuguese island of Madeira.
Portugal, the poorest and most backward
country in Western Europe, has been spending
about 40 percent of its budget and maintaining
142,000 soldiers in Africa in its struggle to hold on
to Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea.
The drain on the country's manpower and
economy has caused major discontent, and Spinola
recently published a book recommending a political
solution with rebel elements in the valuable African
territories — perhaps a commonwealth system.
No Mitchell-Stans Verdict
NEW YORK — The federal court jury was sent to
bed last night unable to agree in initial deliberations
on a criminal conspiracy case against former Atty.
Gen. John Mitchell and onetime Commerce
Secretary Maurice Stans.
The nine men and three women were sent to
their hotel at 10:35 p.m. EDT after about four
hours of deliberations.
The jurors got the case at 4:55 p.m. after a
10-week trial — the first criminal prosecutions of
Cabinet colleagues in nearly 50 years of American
history.
Exactly 30 minutes after the jurors filed out of
the courtroom, they were back, having sent a note
requesting 12 coDies of the indictment. These
subsequently were provided.
In addition, forewoman Sybil Kucharski, a

brown-haired bank teller who postponed her
scheduled marriage because of the long
sequestration as a juror, announced a future work
schedule for the jury of 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily.
Later, the jurors requested and received a reading
from documents and the judge's charge relating to
laws governing the public reporting of campaign
contributions — one of the issues in the conspiracy
charge against Mitchell and Stans.
Impeachment Probe Narrowed
WASHINGTON — The House impeachment
inquiry staff reported yesterday that it is
concentrating its investigation on the major
Watergate allegations and President Nixon's tax
problems.
The staff told the House Judiciary Committee
that it is halting its inquiries into 17 of the 56
original allegations against the President.
In each of the 17 cases the staff said "either
there is no substantial evidence known to the staff
that supports an allegation of wrongdoing or the
evidence is insufficient to justify devoting the
resources required to complete a thorough
investigation."
And to facilitate its inquiry into the taxes, the
staff suggested that a series of questions be
submitted to Nixon for his written replies.
Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J.,
emphasized that the final decision on dropping any
allegation would be up to committee members.
During the 2'/2-hour meeting the committee also
voted 34 to 4 to give the White House five more
days to respond to a subpoena for tapes of 42
presidential conversations.
The White House response was put off until 10
a.m. on Tuesday.
Most of the items set aside by the staff include
allegations that presidential friends and big
campaign contributors received favored treatment
from government agencies.
U.S. Worker Output Falls
WASHINGTON — The productivity of American
workers took its biggest nosedive on record as
output slumped in all sectors of the economy during
the first quarter, the Labor Department reported
yesterday.
At the same time, the department said the value
of workers' paychecks continued to shrink under
the rising cost of living.
The combination adds to the already heavy
inflationary pressures plaguing the economy.
Falling productivity — output per hour of work
— puts upward pressure on prices as unit labor costs
rise. Moreover, with real hourly pay declining,
workers can be expected to seek higher wages to
catch up with the cost of living.

Brandt Aide Alleged Spy
BONN, Germany — An aide to Chancellor Willy
Brandt was under arrest yesterday as the alleged key
man in a Communist East German spy ring in a
burgeoning scandal that could cause more problems
for his already weakened government.
Federal prosecutor Siegfried Buback confirmed
in Karlsruhe that 47-year old Guenter Guillaume,
Brandt's personal assistant for affairs concerning his
Social Democratic party, was among "several
people" detained in Bonn by security men
Wednesday.
Guillaume has admitted he is an officer in East
Germany's National People's Army and an
espionage collaborator of East Berlin's Ministry for
State Security, Buback said.
A government spokesman said the other persons
held for investigation of spy charges are Guillaume's
wife Christel, who worked as a secretary for the
Hessian State government's Bonn office; two of her
colleagues, and her mother.
Though the chancellery aide wielded no political
authority and the government claimed he did not
handle state secrets, observers said they believed he
was in an excellent position to gain information on
government and party affairs.
The discovery of a security leak so close to
Brandt was a further blow to the chancellor's
embattled political position, recently weakened by
setbacks in state and local elections. The case
dimmed his hopes for recovering voter support in
state elections in Lower Saxony on June 9.
NFL Adopts Rule Changes
NEW YORK — Moving boldly against growing
criticism of their game, the National Football
League owners adopted sweeping and revolutionary
rule changes yesterday in an effort to juice up
sagging offenses and discourage the increasing
spread of field goals.
Included among the widespread changes is the
adoption of sudden death overtime for exhibition
and regular season games, moving the goal posts
from the goal line to the end line, and returning
missed field goals to the line of scrimmage or the
20-yard line, whichever is farther from the goal line.
The changes are designed to open up offenses
and encourage kick returns. Kickoffs will be from
the 35-yard line and members of the team kicking
from scrimmage, either punts or field goals, may not
cross the line of scrimmage until the ball is kicked.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through tonight. Fair tomorrow.
Low temperatures nights in the 40s. High today in
the 60s and tomorrow in the mid 60s to low 70s.
Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph in afternoons.
