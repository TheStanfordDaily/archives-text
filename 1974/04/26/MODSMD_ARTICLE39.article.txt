# No Report Changes

In informal committee of the whole
action yesterday, the Faculty Senate
rejected several amendments to the
Professoriate Report that would have
altered the scope of the proposed
adjunct professoriate.
The no n-tenured adjunct
professoriate, as recommended in the
Report of the Committee on the
Professoriate, would include Academic
Council members currently designated
senior lecturers and senior research
associates, and the full-time clinical
faculty in the School of Medicine.
Law Prof. Howard Williams
proposed that the additional
designations of assistant adjunct and
associate adjunct professor be created
throughout the University.
Williams proposed the additional
designations to create a uniformity in
the report which recommends the
associate adjunct professor title for
only the medical school.
Lyman Attacks Proposal
President Lyman attacked the
proposed expansion of the adjunct
professoriate line "as an organized
evasion of the tenure system."
With the availability of these
non-tenured designations Lyman said
departments could avoid the "tough
decisions of granting tenure and create
considerable ambiguity."
"If this becomes the case, the
central administration will assert what
pressure it can to prevent the adjunct
professoriate from being used in this
way," he said.
In a non-binding straw vote the
Senate overwhelmingly rejected
Williams' amendment.
Another Senate member moved
that the associate adjunct professor
designation for the Medical School be
deleted since the presence of the
associate adjunct line in the Medical
School sets a precedent which might
lead to University-wide adoption of
the classification.
Committee of the whole rules do
not allow Senate members' statements
to be attributed to them or the
recording of the results of straw votes.
Med School Disadvantage
Dean of the Medicine School
Clayton Rich objected to the proposal.
"There is a distinct disadvantage in
having only one level of the adjunct

professoriate" in the Medical School,
he said.
One Senate member defended the
creation of the adjunct professoriate in
the Medical School since clinical
faculty members were professionals
engaged in teaching. He said that the
Medical School had already
compromised considerably by
accepting a non-tenure status for the
clinical faculty.
Critical discussion also centered
about the proposed weighting of votes
of Academic Council members to
reflect the numbers of students in the
members' schools.
The weighting was proposed to
limit the impact of professional
schools like the Medical School which
have large faculty bodies but small
student enrollment.
