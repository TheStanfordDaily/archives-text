# University Of Colorado Turns Down Franklin
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Fired Stanford English Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin was denied a
University of Colorado appointment
yesterday by the Board of Regents in a
9-0 vote.
Franklin, dismissed from Stanford
for allegedly inciting students to
violence, told the Daily that the
Regents' decision proves that "there is
no academic freedom in the United
States."
The decision to reject the
recommendation of the English
Department to hire Franklin was

clouded by political problems within
the University of Colorado.
The Regents also voted to fire
University President Frederick T.
Thieme. One Regent, Fred Betz,
claimed that he opposed Franklin's
appointment in order to preclude
further controversy at the troubled
school.
Regents Withdraw Support
Until today, a large number of
Regents openly supported Franklin, an
avowed Maoist. Several members of
the Board told the Daily two weeks
ago that they would probably vote to
hire Franklin.
Paul Levitt, chairman of the English
Department, asserted on April 8 that
the Regents would vote to hire
Franklin because "the University of
Colorado believes in academic
freedom." After yesterday's vote,
Levitt declared that violence had been
done to academic freedom.
A University of Colorado source
told the Daily that many of the people
in the English Department voted to
hire Franklin only in order to
embarrass Thieme.
Faculty members persuaded
Thieme to support Franklin, causing
his position with the Regents to be
undermined when a last-minute
barrage of publicity portrayed
Franklin as a dangerous radical.
Donald Kennedy, Stanford
professor who headed the advisory
board that recommended Franklin's
dismissal in 1972, said yesterday that
he was not surprised by the Regents'
decision.
Colorado Dispute
"I have a feeling that Franklin's
proposed appointment at Colorado
was an element in the dispute between
the faculty and the administration and
the Regents," said Kennedy.
But Franklin said he doubted that
the firing of Thieme was related to the
Regents' decision.
"That is a misreading of things,"
Franklin commented. "It is possible of

course that some individuals
maneuvered but I don't believe that
thpre was any organization to it."
But Franklin reasserted that the
Stanford administration attempted to
persuade the Regents to reject his
appointment. Packets of libelous
material were sent by Stanford to
Colorado, he insisted.
Robert M. Rosenzweig, vice provost
and assistant to President Lyman,
denied last night that the Stanford
administration conspired to keep
Franklin unemployed. "We would
have no reason to do anything like
that," he told the Daily.
Only a few students at the
University of Colorado attempted to
persuade the Regents to hire Franklin,
according to Cindy Calkins,
co-president of the student body at
the school.
Aside from student government
officers, most students were apathetic,
she said.
"I was very disappointed that the
Board chose to disregard academic
freedom," Calkins said. "Franklin is a
distinguished scholar and should have
been hired on his academic
qualifications."
Calkins noted that the political
atmosphere in Colorado is so apathetic
that Franklin would pose no threat to
its peace. "Five years ago, during
student unrest, Franklin wouldn't even
have been considered for an
appointment here," Calkins claimed.
Calkins said that Regent Byron
Johnson made a speech at the meeting
in which he reminded his colleagues of
the violence that occurred on
campuses several years ago, noting in
particular the destruction at the
University of Wisconsin.
Speeches such as that were a main
factor in the changed mood of the
Regents, Calkins contended.
Franklin remarked that people can
learn a lesson from the decision of the
Regents about the "dishonesty and
hypocrisy of people in power."
