# Ex-Campus Radical Appears In SLA Grand Jury Investigation
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
One-time Stanford radical Janet Cooper appeared before
a San Francisco grand jury investigating the Hibernia bank
robbery yesterday, but didn't offer any testimony.
Cooper asked for a lawyer as soon as she was asked a
question, and will appear before the grand jury again next
Thursday.
Another witness, Cynthia Garvey, refused to testify,
citing the Fifth Amendment when questioned.
The two were apparently subpoenaed because of their
acquaintance with members of the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA), which has taken credit for the April 15 bank
robbery.
Cooper, who went by the name Janet Weiss while
attending Stanford — she has since divorced her husband
and assumed her unmarried name — told reporters there
was only one matter she considered legitimate for
consideration by the grand jury.
'The only legitimate purpose there can be for this is to
ask me to confirm what they already know — that is, that
my billfold, containing all my papers, was stolen last
October," she said.
Her driver's license was apparently used to rent one of
the getaway cars involved in the bank robbery. Campus
sources have confirmed that she reported the billfold

missing last fall.
Cooper was a graduate student in English until February,
1971, when the Stanford Judicial Council recommended a
four-quarter suspension for her participation in the
disruption of a campus speech by Henry Cabot Lodge the
month before.
Shortly after that the University sought and obtained an
injunction barring Cooper and 19 others from campus after
a series of violent demonstrations against the war.
She was a leading theoretician for the Maoist group
Venceremos, and wrote a defense of the group's split with
the Revolutionary Union, another Maoist organization. The
Revolutionary Union formally purged her as a result.
Some law enforcement officials have claimed a number
of former Venceremos members are involved in the
Symbionese Liberation Army, but the members themselves
have fervently denied it.
Cooper herself blasted the SLA in a statement to the
press yesterday, claiming it had "nothing in common" with
real revolutionaries.
"None of the actions they have taken credit for
[including the kidnaping of Patricia Hearst and the murder
of Oakland School Superintendent Marcus Foster] have
been done for the people," Cooper insisted.
