# Chimps' Big Move To Freedom
## 
### SANDY WHITE 
Just like Euell Gibbons, the University's
chimpanzees are going back to nature. Five chimps
were moved last week from indoor cages at Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) to the new Primate
Research Facility in the hills behind Stanford Linear
Accelerator.
The facility, completed months behind schedule,
cost $408,000 and consists of two adjoining IV2 acre
enclosures. The SRI chimps live in one half and will
soon have eight next-door neighbors. Both groups
will be under observation by a team of students and
scientists, led by psychiatrist David Hamburg,
primatologist Jane Goodall and biochemist Charles
Doering.
After a week in their new home, the chimps are
beginning to relax and exhibit "normal" behavior,
reports facility director Patrick McGinnis. Caged-in
apes tend to be slightly neurotic. The living area at
SRI was about the size of a tennis court, so these
chimps had never seen such wide expanses or tall
grass before.
Cautious at first, they explored the perimeter of
the new enclosure, followed through the screen
windows by the solemn eyes of grazing cows. Now,
Willie, Bashful and company venture occasionally
into the center of the pen to play on their
jungle-gym, or climb one of the old oak trees.
When they grow accustomed to the outdoors,
they will spend less time near the observation tower
with its warm cages and cement floors.
As they "waltz" together around the enclosure,

chomping on chimp chaw or fresh fruit, the chimps
do not notice the people above them, watching.
Most of the observers are human biology
students: the primate facility is a teaching lab as
well as an experimental center. Each student
watches one chimp from tne tower, recording his
behavior every 30 seconds, just as thousands of
miles away, students at Gombe, Tanzania, watch for
similar behavior in wild chimps.
The coded behavior is fed into a computer,
which draws a personality profile of each chimp and
a map of the group's social activity.
The purpose of the project, explains McGinnis, is
to correlate the development of chimpanzee social
behavior with the development of blood chemistry.
Specifically, they are seeking a relation between
hormone levels and changes in behavior. Chimps are
physiologically very similar to humans, so the
results of primate study are valuable to
psychologists and psychiatrists.
Doering and his associates will draw a
biochemical profile of each chimp from periodic
blood and urine samples. It is hard to catch a chimp
and remove blood, so the scientists will have to be
content with urine. McGinnis hopes eventually to
train the chimps to stick their arms into a cage for
blood sampling, but "chimps are unpredictable."
For the first few months, researchers will only
observe, not manipulate, the chimps' behavior.
When the animals are well-adjusted, the researchers
will introduce experimental conditions such as
visual barriers and special food machines. They hope

that the chimps will reproduce, so mother-infant
relationships can be studied.
This type of facility is ideal for primate research,
says Doering. "It is not as artificial as their cages at
SRI, nor is it as hard to control as Africa." Caged
chimps do not behave "normally." Zoos, for
example, create an unnatural competition at feeding
time. Chimps in the wild behave normally, but they
cannot be manipulated experimentally. A spacious
enclosure such as this one — known affectionately
as Gombe West — and two older ones in Louisiana
and Georgia, provide natural habitats which can be
manipulated.
Hamburg, Goodall, and their associates had a
difficult time finding funds. The Grant Foundation
of New York City donated $250,000, which was to
have financed the whole project. But estimates
jumped to keep up with construction costs, and one
architect projected a price of $750,000.
Alan Grundmann, who finally built the facility,
compromised. "Things were really touch-and-go" in
the summer of 1973, and it looked as if the dream
might never be realized. The National Institute of
Mental Health finally granted the balance of the
$408,000. The original plan was to build a six-acre,
circular enclosure with four quadrants. As it turned
out, they could only afford a semi-circle. The
sponsors hope to raise enough money to complete
the circle within the next ten years.
In the meantime, the carefree chimps will live
and play in the California hills as observers try to
unravel the mysteries of hormones and behavior.

SET FREE — Instead of being cooped up in cages, these chimps have moved
from the Stanford Research Institute to a new $408,000 home in the foothills
behind the Stanford Linear Accelerator. Hie three chimps, Babu (the baby),
Bashful (partially hidden) and Topsy (both females), will be the primary tenants
of the Primate Research Facility.
