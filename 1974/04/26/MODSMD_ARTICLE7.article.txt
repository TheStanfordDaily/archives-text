# Sahel Famine
## 
### 
Paul Ehrlich

Stanford students are now
attemptingadrivetoaid thestarving
people of the sub-Saharan region
of Africa — the Sahel. Few causes
deserve our attention and efforts
more at this time.
The Sahelian nations of
Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad,
Upper Volta and Senegal have
now undergone six consecutive
years of drought. Newspapers
have reported that "untold
thousands" have died of famine as
a result of the drought.
Further, there are rumors that
this is a vast underestimate and
that perhaps 1.5 million people
have perished. In addition, as
many as 100,000 people have died
of starvation in Ethiopia, which
also suffered from drought. Not
only are statistics difficult to
obtain because many of the
deaths are occurring among
nomads in very poor countries,
but at least in Ethiopia deliberate
attempts were made by local
government officials to conceal
the famines.
What seems certain is that the
death of livestock has destroyed
the way of life of some proud
nomadic peoples like the Tuareg,
forcing them at best to become
hangers-on around the fringes of
poverty-stricken towns. Even
though 1973 rains were better
than the previous five years (but
not normal), the region remains in
deep trouble because of the lack
of breeding animals and seed
stocks from which to start again.
Optimists Wrong
In short, the perennial
optimists, who a few years ago
were ridiculing predictions of
famines in the 19705, have already
been proven wrong.
Fortunately there are some
centers of growing concern, and I
hope that our campus will soon be
outstanding among them. But
even those who don't care about
other people dying far away
should not take the sub-Saharan
drought lightly. Events there are
symptomatic of far more universal
food problems.
Serious Situation
In 1973 the food situation was
also serious in India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal,
Ceylon, Indonesia, the Philippines
and parts of tropical America.
Last May, Dr. Addeke Boerma,
director of FAO (United Nations
Food and Agriculture
Organization) announced that
world reserves of grains were at
their lowest level since 1952,
amounting to the equivalent of
what the United States consumes
in seven weeks. The world
population in 1952 was some 2.5
billion people; in 1973 it was
almost four billion.
Therefore, in early 1973 the
world's per capita reserves were
far lower than they had been at
the previous low, 21 years earlier.
Thus, after a quarter of a century
of agriculturalists' assurances that
they could feed an ever-increasing
population indefinitely, and after
five years of a "green revolution"
that many uninformed optimists
promised would solve the world
food problem, Homo sapiens once
again is threatened with massive
famines.
The argument is sometimes
heard, however, that mankind has
not caused escalating food
shortages; that they must be
blamed on "bad weather." This is
a preposterous evasion. "Bad"
weather is a characteristic and
well-known feature of the planet
Earth. Climatic change has
occurred naturally throughout the
past, caused by such things as
shifting positions of continents
and cycles of volcanic activity.
Changes Continuing
Today such natural changes are
continuing and interacting with
other changes induced by human
activities. Industrial societies
produce air pollution, cut down
forests, and build heat-producing
cities. Overpopulated farming
societies not only cut down
forests, but also inject large
amounts of dust into the
atmosphere, forming agricultural
hazes.

It now seems that these human
activities may be contributing to
recent unfavorable shifts in the
climate — especially the monsoon
failures that are responsible for
the sub-Saharan droughts and that
have exacerbated food problems
in southern Asia.
The factors that control the
climate are still not thoroughly
understood. Small changes in such
things as the dustiness of the
atmosphere may cause shifts in
the colossal forces that interact to
create planetary weather patterns.
By convention among
meteorologists, "normal" weather
is that which occurred between
1930 and 1960. Careful
reconstruction of past climate,
however, shows that period to
represent the most extreme
weather pattern in a thousand
years.
Careful Selection
Virtually all of mankind's
high-yield crops are genetic strains
selected to give maximum
productivity under a narrow set of
environmental conditions — those
that prevailed during what appears
to have been a once-in-a
millenium period of freakish
weather!
Of course, it should be possible
to select new crop strains that will
give their maximum response
under a different set of
conditions. Two very important
things are required to do this
successfully: time and genetic
variability in the crops. Time
might be available if climatic
changes were slow enough, their
recognition prompt, and the
human response rapid.
But climatic change is not
necessarily slow (as we have seen
in the sub-Saharan region), it is
extremely difficult to distinguish
short-term fluctuations from
long-term trends,and agricultural
scientists have, for the most part,
failed to recognize the
evolutionary dimension of their
business.
Variability Unavailable?
Even if time were available,
however, the requisite genetic
variability might not be. One of
the major errors made by
agriculturalists in the last two
decades has been to encourage the
spread of single strains of
high-yield crop plants plants so
that they now dominate large
areas.
The growing uniformity of
crops has been accelerated by the
green revolution, the introduction
of fertilizer-sensitive, high-yielding
crop strains into UDCs. Genetic
variability, once lost, is for
practical purposes gone forever —
and with it goes man's ability to
develop new strains of crops. The
ability to breed new strains is
critical not only to meeting
changing climatic conditions, but
also to maintaining crop resistance
to pests. In terms of the ability to
maintain high-yield agriculture,
mankind is rapidly painting itself
into a corner.
In short, the first people to feel
the full weight of the rapid
environmental changes inevitable
on our overpopulated globe are
the proud and independent
peoples who wrested their living
from the inhospitable lands to the
south of the Sahara — but they
will not be the last. And sooner or
later the bell will toll for us too.
If we turn our backs
and let these nomadic peoples die,
we may never succeed in
establishing a pattern of
international cooperation to deal
with the population-resource
environment crisis.
Food aid must be the first step
to alerting people to our global
peril and to organizing humanity
to deal with the causes of hunger.
But our government seems to be
too pre-occupied with its own
scandals to do anything helpful,
while American industry is too
busy chasing profits (while they
still can). So it's up to us.

climate — especially the monsoon
failures that are responsible for
the sub-Saharan droughts and that
have exacerbated food problems
in southern Asia.
The factors that control the
climate are still not thoroughly
understood. Small changes in such
things as the dustiness of the
atmosphere may cause shifts in
the colossal forces that interact to
create planetary weather patterns.
By convention among
meteorologists, "normal" weather
is that which occurred between
1930 and 1960. Careful
reconstruction of past climate,
however, shows that period to
represent the most extreme
weather pattern in a thousand
years.
Careful Selection
Virtually all of mankind's
high-yield crops are genetic strains
selected to give maximum
productivity under a narrow set of
environmental conditions — those
that prevailed during what appears
to have been a once-in-a
millenium period of freakish
weather!
Of course, it should be possible
to select new crop strains that will
give their maximum response
under a different set of
conditions. Two very important
things are required to do this
successfully: time and genetic
variability in the crops. Time
might be available if climatic
changes were slow enough, their
recognition prompt, and the
human response rapid.
But climatic change is not
necessarily slow (as we have seen
in the sub-Saharan region), it is
extremely difficult to distinguish
short-term fluctuations from
long-term trends,and agricultural
scientists have, for the most part,
failed to recognize the
evolutionary dimension of their
business.
Variability Unavailable?
Even if time were available,
however, the requisite genetic
variability might not be. One of
the major errors made by
agriculturalists in the last two
decades has been to encourage the
spread of single strains of
high-yield crop plants plants so
that they now dominate large
areas.
The growing uniformity of
crops has been accelerated by the
green revolution, the introduction
of fertilizer-sensitive, high-yielding
crop strains into UDCs. Genetic
variability, once lost, is for
practical purposes gone forever —
and with it goes man's ability to
develop new strains of crops. The
ability to breed new strains is
critical not only to meeting
changing climatic conditions, but
also to maintaining crop resistance
to pests. In terms of the ability to
maintain high-yield agriculture,
mankind is rapidly painting itself
into a corner.
In short, the first people to feel
the full weight of the rapid
environmental changes inevitable
on our overpopulated globe are
the proud and independent
peoples who wrested their living
from the inhospitable lands to the
south of the Sahara — but they
will not be the last. And sooner or
later the bell will toll for us too.
If we turn our backs
and let these nomadic peoples die,
we may never succeed in
establishing a pattern of
international cooperation to deal
with the population-resource
environment crisis.
Food aid must be the first step
to alerting people to our global
peril and to organizing humanity
to deal with the causes of hunger.
But our government seems to be
too pre-occupied with its own
scandals to do anything helpful,
while American industry is too
busy chasing profits (while they
still can). So it's up to us.

Stanford students are now
attemptingadrivetoaid thestarving
people of the sub-Saharan region
of Africa — the Sahel. Few causes
deserve our attention and efforts
more at this time.
The Sahelian nations of
Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad,
Upper Volta and Senegal have
now undergone six consecutive
years of drought. Newspapers
have reported that "untold
thousands" have died of famine as
a result of the drought.
Further, there are rumors that
this is a vast underestimate and
that perhaps 1.5 million people
have perished. In addition, as
many as 100,000 people have died
of starvation in Ethiopia, which
also suffered from drought. Not
only are statistics difficult to
obtain because many of the
deaths are occurring among
nomads in very poor countries,
but at least in Ethiopia deliberate
attempts were made by local
government officials to conceal
the famines.
What seems certain is that the
death of livestock has destroyed
the way of life of some proud
nomadic peoples like the Tuareg,
forcing them at best to become
hangers-on around the fringes of
poverty-stricken towns. Even
though 1973 rains were better
than the previous five years (but
not normal), the region remains in
deep trouble because of the lack
of breeding animals and seed
stocks from which to start again.
Optimists Wrong
In short, the perennial
optimists, who a few years ago
were ridiculing predictions of
famines in the 19705, have already
been proven wrong.
Fortunately there are some
centers of growing concern, and I
hope that our campus will soon be
outstanding among them. But
even those who don't care about
other people dying far away
should not take the sub-Saharan
drought lightly. Events there are
symptomatic of far more universal
food problems.
Serious Situation
In 1973 the food situation was
also serious in India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal,
Ceylon, Indonesia, the Philippines
and parts of tropical America.
Last May, Dr. Addeke Boerma,
director of FAO (United Nations
Food and Agriculture
Organization) announced that
world reserves of grains were at
their lowest level since 1952,
amounting to the equivalent of
what the United States consumes
in seven weeks. The world
population in 1952 was some 2.5
billion people; in 1973 it was
almost four billion.
Therefore, in early 1973 the
world's per capita reserves were
far lower than they had been at
the previous low, 21 years earlier.
Thus, after a quarter of a century
of agriculturalists' assurances that
they could feed an ever-increasing
population indefinitely, and after
five years of a "green revolution"
that many uninformed optimists
promised would solve the world
food problem, Homo sapiens once
again is threatened with massive
famines.
The argument is sometimes
heard, however, that mankind has
not caused escalating food
shortages; that they must be
blamed on "bad weather." This is
a preposterous evasion. "Bad"
weather is a characteristic and
well-known feature of the planet
Earth. Climatic change has
occurred naturally throughout the
past, caused by such things as
shifting positions of continents
and cycles of volcanic activity.
Changes Continuing
Today such natural changes are
continuing and interacting with
other changes induced by human
activities. Industrial societies
produce air pollution, cut down
forests, and build heat-producing
cities. Overpopulated farming
societies not only cut down
forests, but also inject large
amounts of dust into the
atmosphere, forming agricultural
hazes.

It now seems that these human
activities may be contributing to
recent unfavorable shifts in the
climate — especially the monsoon
failures that are responsible for
the sub-Saharan droughts and that
have exacerbated food problems
in southern Asia.

this is a vast underestimate and
that perhaps 1.5 million people
have perished. In addition, as
many as 100,000 people have died
of starvation in Ethiopia, which
also suffered from drought. Not
only are statistics difficult to
obtain because many of the
deaths are occurring among
nomads in very poor countries,
but at least in Ethiopia deliberate
attempts were made by local
government officials to conceal
the famines.
What seems certain is that the
death of livestock has destroyed
the way of life of some proud
nomadic peoples like the Tuareg,
forcing them at best to become
hangers-on around the fringes of
poverty-stricken towns. Even
though 1973 rains were better
than the previous five years (but
not normal), the region remains in
deep trouble because of the lack
of breeding animals and seed
stocks from which to start again.
Optimists Wrong
In short, the perennial
optimists, who a few years ago
were ridiculing predictions of
famines in the 19705, have already
been proven wrong.
Fortunately there are some
centers of growing concern, and I
hope that our campus will soon be
outstanding among them. But
even those who don't care about
other people dying far away
should not take the sub-Saharan
drought lightly. Events there are
symptomatic of far more universal
food problems.
Serious Situation
In 1973 the food situation was
also serious in India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal,
Ceylon, Indonesia, the Philippines
and parts of tropical America.
Last May, Dr. Addeke Boerma,
director of FAO (United Nations
Food and Agriculture
Organization) announced that
world reserves of grains were at
their lowest level since 1952,
amounting to the equivalent of
what the United States consumes
in seven weeks. The world
population in 1952 was some 2.5
billion people; in 1973 it was
almost four billion.
Therefore, in early 1973 the
world's per capita reserves were
far lower than they had been at
the previous low, 21 years earlier.
Thus, after a quarter of a century
of agriculturalists' assurances that
they could feed an ever-increasing
population indefinitely, and after
five years of a "green revolution"
that many uninformed optimists
promised would solve the world
food problem, Homo sapiens once
again is threatened with massive
famines.
The argument is sometimes
heard, however, that mankind has
not caused escalating food
shortages; that they must be
blamed on "bad weather." This is
a preposterous evasion. "Bad"
weather is a characteristic and
well-known feature of the planet
Earth. Climatic change has
occurred naturally throughout the
past, caused by such things as
shifting positions of continents
and cycles of volcanic activity.
Changes Continuing
Today such natural changes are
continuing and interacting with
other changes induced by human
activities. Industrial societies
produce air pollution, cut down
forests, and build heat-producing
cities. Overpopulated farming
societies not only cut down
forests, but also inject large
amounts of dust into the
atmosphere, forming agricultural
hazes.

It now seems that these human
activities may be contributing to
recent unfavorable shifts in the
climate — especially the monsoon
failures that are responsible for
the sub-Saharan droughts and that
have exacerbated food problems
in southern Asia.
The factors that control the
climate are still not thoroughly
understood. Small changes in such
things as the dustiness of the
atmosphere may cause shifts in
the colossal forces that interact to
create planetary weather patterns.
By convention among
meteorologists, "normal" weather
is that which occurred between
1930 and 1960. Careful
reconstruction of past climate,
however, shows that period to
represent the most extreme
weather pattern in a thousand
years.
Careful Selection
Virtually all of mankind's
high-yield crops are genetic strains
selected to give maximum
productivity under a narrow set of
environmental conditions — those
that prevailed during what appears
to have been a once-in-a
millenium period of freakish
weather!
Of course, it should be possible
to select new crop strains that will
give their maximum response
under a different set of
conditions. Two very important
things are required to do this
successfully: time and genetic
variability in the crops. Time
might be available if climatic
changes were slow enough, their
recognition prompt, and the
human response rapid.
But climatic change is not
necessarily slow (as we have seen
in the sub-Saharan region), it is
extremely difficult to distinguish
short-term fluctuations from
long-term trends,and agricultural
scientists have, for the most part,
failed to recognize the
evolutionary dimension of their
business.
Variability Unavailable?
Even if time were available,
however, the requisite genetic
variability might not be. One of
the major errors made by
agriculturalists in the last two
decades has been to encourage the
spread of single strains of
high-yield crop plants plants so
that they now dominate large
areas.
The growing uniformity of
crops has been accelerated by the
green revolution, the introduction
of fertilizer-sensitive, high-yielding
crop strains into UDCs. Genetic
variability, once lost, is for
practical purposes gone forever —
and with it goes man's ability to
develop new strains of crops. The
ability to breed new strains is
critical not only to meeting
changing climatic conditions, but
also to maintaining crop resistance
to pests. In terms of the ability to
maintain high-yield agriculture,
mankind is rapidly painting itself
into a corner.
In short, the first people to feel
the full weight of the rapid
environmental changes inevitable
on our overpopulated globe are
the proud and independent
peoples who wrested their living
from the inhospitable lands to the
south of the Sahara — but they
will not be the last. And sooner or
later the bell will toll for us too.
If we turn our backs
and let these nomadic peoples die,
we may never succeed in
establishing a pattern of
international cooperation to deal
with the population-resource
environment crisis.
Food aid must be the first step
to alerting people to our global
peril and to organizing humanity
to deal with the causes of hunger.
But our government seems to be
too pre-occupied with its own
scandals to do anything helpful,
while American industry is too
busy chasing profits (while they
still can). So it's up to us.

1930 and 1960. Careful
reconstruction of past climate,
however, shows that period to
represent the most extreme
weather pattern in a thousand
years.
Careful Selection
Virtually all of mankind's
high-yield crops are genetic strains
selected to give maximum
productivity under a narrow set of
environmental conditions — those
that prevailed during what appears
to have been a once-in-a
millenium period of freakish
weather!
Of course, it should be possible
to select new crop strains that will
give their maximum response
under a different set of
conditions. Two very important
things are required to do this
successfully: time and genetic
variability in the crops. Time
might be available if climatic
changes were slow enough, their
recognition prompt, and the
human response rapid.
But climatic change is not
necessarily slow (as we have seen
in the sub-Saharan region), it is
extremely difficult to distinguish
short-term fluctuations from
long-term trends,and agricultural
scientists have, for the most part,
failed to recognize the
evolutionary dimension of their
business.
Variability Unavailable?
Even if time were available,
however, the requisite genetic
variability might not be. One of
the major errors made by
agriculturalists in the last two
decades has been to encourage the
spread of single strains of
high-yield crop plants plants so
that they now dominate large
areas.
The growing uniformity of
crops has been accelerated by the
green revolution, the introduction
of fertilizer-sensitive, high-yielding
crop strains into UDCs. Genetic
variability, once lost, is for
practical purposes gone forever —
and with it goes man's ability to
develop new strains of crops. The
ability to breed new strains is
critical not only to meeting
changing climatic conditions, but
also to maintaining crop resistance
to pests. In terms of the ability to
maintain high-yield agriculture,
mankind is rapidly painting itself
into a corner.
In short, the first people to feel
the full weight of the rapid
environmental changes inevitable
on our overpopulated globe are
the proud and independent
peoples who wrested their living
from the inhospitable lands to the
south of the Sahara — but they
will not be the last. And sooner or
later the bell will toll for us too.
If we turn our backs
and let these nomadic peoples die,
we may never succeed in
establishing a pattern of
international cooperation to deal
with the population-resource
environment crisis.
Food aid must be the first step
to alerting people to our global
peril and to organizing humanity
to deal with the causes of hunger.
But our government seems to be
too pre-occupied with its own
scandals to do anything helpful,
while American industry is too
busy chasing profits (while they
still can). So it's up to us.
