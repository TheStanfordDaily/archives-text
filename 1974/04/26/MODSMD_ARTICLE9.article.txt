# Dean Announces Admissions Policy
## 
### 
Rod Koon

The Dean of Admissions of a small,
private West Coast university has recently
announced that the criteria used for choosing
prospective students from a vast number of
adequately qualified students is rapidly
changing.
"We used to look for leadership, sports
ability, citizenship, drive, ambition," he
stated recently in an interview. "But these
are no longer of prime concern."
The student of the seventies is a new
breed, and Dean Hardlygon wants to make
sure his students "fit the mold." Just what
are they looking for these days?
Instead of the standard application form,
complete with the essay "What I Want to do
When I Grow Up," (and please attach photo
but DO NOT STAPLE!) all candidates for
admission will have to visit the university's
sprawling campus. Here he will undergo a
number of tests.
Lecture Test
First, he will be seated in a large lecture
classroom, and be asked to take notes during
an 8 a.m. lecture. To assure he will be in the
same boat as most students, he will have been
given NO IDEA of what the lecture will be
about.
The candidate will be scored on this test
thusly: one point if he remembers to bring a
pen and notebook, four points if his notes
are illegible and nine points if he falls asleep
halfway through the lecture. As you can see,
the higher one scores, the better is his chance
for admission.
Next, he will be taken to a large
auditorium and placed in the balcony
section. Given a small amount of paper, he
will be asked to make paper airplanes and fly
them. If his planes are successful in reaching
the stage far below him, he will receive 15
points. If he can set one on fire and still have
it reach the stage before disintegrating, he
will receive an additional 10 points. Any

outstanding belches, obscenities, vulgarities
or jungle calls uttered during this process by
the applicant will be weighed in his favor.
Dorm Test
Travelling to a dorm for the next phase of
testing, the applicant will be judged on his
ability to study in a room where 15
people are playing poker and smoking all
kinds of things, while in the next room the
Rolling Stones are on at 165 decibels. He
receives three points if he successfully
studies, 10 points if he gives up and goes to
sleep, and 24 points if he can sing along to
the Stones' music.
This segment is followed by a trip to the
dorm dining room, where the applicant is
given four points for every food item he eats,
seven points for every item he DOES NOT
eat, and five points for every food item he
RECOGNIZES. (Milk is not included in this
test)
Not wanting any students to be lacking in
physical finesse, the next leg of the test takes
place in a large plaza in the center of campus.
Left alone at one end with only a 10-speed
bike with a flat tire, the applicant must walk
the bike safely to the other end a half mile
away.
Bicycling Trick
The trick is that this MUST be done
during the break between 10 and 11 o'clock
classes. So our prospective student is facing
close to 4586 people, 1986 bikes (which is
about 10,768 speeds), and 27 sordid dogs
thrown in for flavor. In this trial, our hero
receives three points if he makes the journey
safely without injury to himself, his bike, or
others. He can win five points for every
person he runs over, three for every dog he
kicks, and one-quarter point for every look
he picks up during the course of the journey.
The final phase of this test, which is
designed to separate the men from the boys
as well as the women from the girls, also

emphasizes the physicality of the applicant.
This is known as the Peak Streak, in which he
is asked to cavort sans vetements through the
same plaza at the rush hour, without the aid
of a bicycle.
Points are awarded in a similar fashion as
before, with a bonus of 30 points if he
manages the ordeal without having himself
molested or arrested. All applicants who
survive this ordeal will receive a $25 clothes
gift certificate for use at a nearby shopping
center.
'Separate Chiefs From Shafts'
Dean Hardlygon hopes that this new
setup, "will help separate the chiefs from the
shafts. We want this to make the Army
obstacle courses to look like a kindergarten
swing set."
Though the new measure met with some
enthusiasm, there was much weeping and
gnashing of teeth at the same time. As one
frustrated applicant put it, "It's getting
harder to score at this university every day."
Another griper contends, "Great students
aren't born, they just kind of regress here
until they fit into the proper pattern."
This comment aroused anger in
another student who proudly contended,
"This university has the best students money
can buy. Or something like that."
Perhaps the best summary of the attitude
which this new policy is eliciting comes from
G.P. Adams, an early guinea pig in this
process. Though he had a low GPA in high
school, was not involved in school activities,
nor seemed to care much about anything, he
had the highest score of 100 applicants on
this new test. To what did he attribute his
success? "I'm just glad I learned how to
sleep, fight, streak, eat and make paper
airplanes in high school. Otherwise, the test
might have been really miserable."

Though the new measure met with some
enthusiasm, there was much weeping and
gnashing of teeth at the same time. As one
frustrated applicant put it, "It's getting
harder to score at this university every day."
Another griper contends, "Great students
aren't born, they just kind of regress here
until they fit into the proper pattern."
This comment aroused anger in
another student who proudly contended,
"This university has the best students money
can buy. Or something like that."
Perhaps the best summary of the attitude
which this new policy is eliciting comes from
G.P. Adams, an early guinea pig in this
process. Though he had a low GPA in high
school, was not involved in school activities,
nor seemed to care much about anything, he
had the highest score of 100 applicants on
this new test. To what did he attribute his
success? "I'm just glad I learned how to
sleep, fight, streak, eat and make paper
airplanes in high school. Otherwise, the test
might have been really miserable."

The Dean of Admissions of a small,
private West Coast university has recently
announced that the criteria used for choosing
prospective students from a vast number of
adequately qualified students is rapidly
changing.
"We used to look for leadership, sports
ability, citizenship, drive, ambition," he
stated recently in an interview. "But these
are no longer of prime concern."
The student of the seventies is a new
breed, and Dean Hardlygon wants to make
sure his students "fit the mold." Just what
are they looking for these days?
Instead of the standard application form,
complete with the essay "What I Want to do
When I Grow Up," (and please attach photo
but DO NOT STAPLE!) all candidates for
admission will have to visit the university's
sprawling campus. Here he will undergo a
number of tests.
Lecture Test
First, he will be seated in a large lecture
classroom, and be asked to take notes during
an 8 a.m. lecture. To assure he will be in the
same boat as most students, he will have been
given NO IDEA of what the lecture will be
about.
The candidate will be scored on this test
thusly: one point if he remembers to bring a
pen and notebook, four points if his notes
are illegible and nine points if he falls asleep
halfway through the lecture. As you can see,
the higher one scores, the better is his chance
for admission.
Next, he will be taken to a large
auditorium and placed in the balcony
section. Given a small amount of paper, he
will be asked to make paper airplanes and fly
them. If his planes are successful in reaching
the stage far below him, he will receive 15
points. If he can set one on fire and still have
it reach the stage before disintegrating, he
will receive an additional 10 points. Any

outstanding belches, obscenities, vulgarities
or jungle calls uttered during this process by
the applicant will be weighed in his favor.
Dorm Test
Travelling to a dorm for the next phase of
testing, the applicant will be judged on his
ability to study in a room where 15
people are playing poker and smoking all
kinds of things, while in the next room the
Rolling Stones are on at 165 decibels. He
receives three points if he successfully
studies, 10 points if he gives up and goes to
sleep, and 24 points if he can sing along to
the Stones' music.
This segment is followed by a trip to the
dorm dining room, where the applicant is
given four points for every food item he eats,
seven points for every item he DOES NOT
eat, and five points for every food item he
RECOGNIZES. (Milk is not included in this
test)
Not wanting any students to be lacking in
physical finesse, the next leg of the test takes
place in a large plaza in the center of campus.
Left alone at one end with only a 10-speed
bike with a flat tire, the applicant must walk
the bike safely to the other end a half mile
away.
Bicycling Trick
The trick is that this MUST be done
during the break between 10 and 11 o'clock
classes. So our prospective student is facing
close to 4586 people, 1986 bikes (which is
about 10,768 speeds), and 27 sordid dogs
thrown in for flavor. In this trial, our hero
receives three points if he makes the journey
safely without injury to himself, his bike, or
others. He can win five points for every
person he runs over, three for every dog he
kicks, and one-quarter point for every look
he picks up during the course of the journey.
The final phase of this test, which is
designed to separate the men from the boys
as well as the women from the girls, also

emphasizes the physicality of the applicant.
This is known as the Peak Streak, in which he
is asked to cavort sans vetements through the
same plaza at the rush hour, without the aid
of a bicycle.
Points are awarded in a similar fashion as
before, with a bonus of 30 points if he
manages the ordeal without having himself
molested or arrested. All applicants who
survive this ordeal will receive a $25 clothes
gift certificate for use at a nearby shopping
center.
'Separate Chiefs From Shafts'
Dean Hardlygon hopes that this new
setup, "will help separate the chiefs from the
shafts. We want this to make the Army
obstacle courses to look like a kindergarten
swing set."
Though the new measure met with some
enthusiasm, there was much weeping and
gnashing of teeth at the same time. As one
frustrated applicant put it, "It's getting

safely without injury to himself, his bike, or
others. He can win five points for every
person he runs over, three for every dog he
kicks, and one-quarter point for every look
he picks up during the course of the journey.
The final phase of this test, which is
designed to separate the men from the boys
as well as the women from the girls, also

emphasizes the physicality of the applicant.
This is known as the Peak Streak, in which he
is asked to cavort sans vetements through the
same plaza at the rush hour, without the aid
of a bicycle.
Points are awarded in a similar fashion as
before, with a bonus of 30 points if he
manages the ordeal without having himself
molested or arrested. All applicants who
survive this ordeal will receive a $25 clothes
gift certificate for use at a nearby shopping
center.
'Separate Chiefs From Shafts'
Dean Hardlygon hopes that this new
setup, "will help separate the chiefs from the
shafts. We want this to make the Army
obstacle courses to look like a kindergarten
swing set."
Though the new measure met with some
enthusiasm, there was much weeping and
gnashing of teeth at the same time. As one
frustrated applicant put it, "It's getting
harder to score at this university every day."
Another griper contends, "Great students
aren't born, they just kind of regress here
until they fit into the proper pattern."
This comment aroused anger in
another student who proudly contended,
"This university has the best students money
can buy. Or something like that."
Perhaps the best summary of the attitude
which this new policy is eliciting comes from
G.P. Adams, an early guinea pig in this
process. Though he had a low GPA in high
school, was not involved in school activities,
nor seemed to care much about anything, he
had the highest score of 100 applicants on
this new test. To what did he attribute his
success? "I'm just glad I learned how to
sleep, fight, streak, eat and make paper
airplanes in high school. Otherwise, the test
might have been really miserable."

The Dean of Admissions of a small,
private West Coast university has recently
announced that the criteria used for choosing
prospective students from a vast number of
adequately qualified students is rapidly
changing.
"We used to look for leadership, sports
ability, citizenship, drive, ambition," he
stated recently in an interview. "But these
are no longer of prime concern."
The student of the seventies is a new
breed, and Dean Hardlygon wants to make
sure his students "fit the mold." Just what
are they looking for these days?
Instead of the standard application form,
complete with the essay "What I Want to do
When I Grow Up," (and please attach photo
but DO NOT STAPLE!) all candidates for
admission will have to visit the university's
sprawling campus. Here he will undergo a
number of tests.
Lecture Test
First, he will be seated in a large lecture
classroom, and be asked to take notes during
an 8 a.m. lecture. To assure he will be in the
same boat as most students, he will have been
given NO IDEA of what the lecture will be
about.
The candidate will be scored on this test
thusly: one point if he remembers to bring a
pen and notebook, four points if his notes
are illegible and nine points if he falls asleep
halfway through the lecture. As you can see,
the higher one scores, the better is his chance
for admission.
Next, he will be taken to a large
auditorium and placed in the balcony
section. Given a small amount of paper, he
will be asked to make paper airplanes and fly
them. If his planes are successful in reaching
the stage far below him, he will receive 15
points. If he can set one on fire and still have
it reach the stage before disintegrating, he
will receive an additional 10 points. Any

outstanding belches, obscenities, vulgarities
or jungle calls uttered during this process by
the applicant will be weighed in his favor.
Dorm Test
Travelling to a dorm for the next phase of
testing, the applicant will be judged on his
ability to study in a room where 15
people are playing poker and smoking all
kinds of things, while in the next room the
Rolling Stones are on at 165 decibels. He
receives three points if he successfully
studies, 10 points if he gives up and goes to
sleep, and 24 points if he can sing along to
the Stones' music.
This segment is followed by a trip to the
dorm dining room, where the applicant is
given four points for every food item he eats,
seven points for every item he DOES NOT
eat, and five points for every food item he
RECOGNIZES. (Milk is not included in this
test)
Not wanting any students to be lacking in
physical finesse, the next leg of the test takes
place in a large plaza in the center of campus.
Left alone at one end with only a 10-speed
bike with a flat tire, the applicant must walk
the bike safely to the other end a half mile
away.
Bicycling Trick
The trick is that this MUST be done
during the break between 10 and 11 o'clock
classes. So our prospective student is facing
close to 4586 people, 1986 bikes (which is
about 10,768 speeds), and 27 sordid dogs
thrown in for flavor. In this trial, our hero
receives three points if he makes the journey
safely without injury to himself, his bike, or
others. He can win five points for every
person he runs over, three for every dog he
kicks, and one-quarter point for every look
he picks up during the course of the journey.
