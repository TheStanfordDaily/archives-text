# Famine Relief Group May Not Reach Goal

### RAY SQUITIERI 
The African Famine Relief
Committee (AFRC) will apparently
not achieve its goal of raising $5000
since its drive to channel dorm dues
for relief work was halted by the
University, according to AFRC
organizer Laurie Coplcn.
"We won't make it. We don't have
the manpower to raise the money,"
Coplen commented.
But Melissa Lawson of the Black
Students Union and AFRC thought
otherwise. "We will get $5000 if
people decide to support us." She
cited other fund-raising projects—a
dance, a fashion show that raised $300
and Faculty Club Chef Dave "Big
Daddy" McCullum's dinners that
netted over $2000—as AFRC's main
(source of money now.
Earlier this month, the University
halted AFRC's drive to collect 10
percent of house dues from University
dormitories because the money
collected would not be of "direct
benefit" to students.
"Collecting money from the dorms
would have been easier," commented
Jeff Oxley of Columbae House. "If 50
percent of a house says okay, you've
got a dollar from everyone. If you
have to ask individuals, it's money
they've got in their pockets. It's easy
to brush something like that off."

Hillary Lash of the Chapel office
reported, however, that at least $500
has gone to the drive through the
church, mostly from door-to-door
contact.
About 15 students washed cars
Saturday to earn $172.50 for the relief
fund, according to Coplen. She said
the money was raised from one dollar
car wash fees, supplemented by
donations.
AFRC has also used work pledges
to raise money. "Skip" Rung of Serra
Housq said, "another guy and I got
jobs weeding one Saturday," and
donated the money. Half the residents
of Serra have contributed more than
$120 individually according to Rung.
Money collected by AFRC goes to
Relief for Africans in Need in the
Sahel (RAINS), whose members
include the NAACP, the Urban League
and 30 other national organizations.
RAINS hopes to collect $150 million
this year, to be spent on food, medical
supplies, and other immediate needs.
Danger Of Starvation
In the six countries of the Sahel,
according to Coplen, 13 million people
are in danger of starving to death.
Americans are just now becoming
aware of it, she said, emphasizing the
need for immediate aid.
In some areas, she said, 80 percent
of the cattle are dead. Even camels are
starting to die. "And when the camels
die, it's time to give in," she remarked.
"People are beginning to despair.
"The crisis has not been publicized
as much as Bangla Desh or Biafra. If
there was a racial issue here, or
political conflict, it would be all over
the papers."
Lawson added, "People don't
realize how serious it is." To publicize
the problem, AFRC sponsored a
lecture on causes of the drought by
Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, and
showed a documentary film on the
crisis. "We're trying to put the drought
on people's minds," said Lawson.
AFRC organizers here plan a
carnival and dance set for the weekend
of May 10 to support the drive. A
panel discussion is slated for the 16th,
a day of fasting, similar to the fast for
Biafra in 1969, is planned for later in
May.
