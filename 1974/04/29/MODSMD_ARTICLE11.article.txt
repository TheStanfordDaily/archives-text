# Bargaining And University Finances

The April 12 Daily quotes USE President
Jim Berk as saying, "The University is going
to have to offer us more. They're going to
have to dip into reserves to pay us. They have
to go back to the alumni and federal
government and get more money, which is
what they should have done all along."
Contrary to the impression conveyed by
Berk, the University has for a long time been
meeting the need for money by a
combination of tough-minded measures —
aggressive application for federal support,
extensive and sustained fundraising,
maintenance of high rates for room and
board, tuition, investment return and other
forms of income, and expenditure reduction.
The Budget Adjustment Program (BAP)
was begun in the teeth of a deficit of well
over $1 million, and for five years we have
been examining budgets for reasonable
cost-cutting alternatives. In developing our
budget for next year, we had to budget twice
as much as planned — over $1,400,000 — in
order to provide an average faculty salary
increase of six percent and a still higher
increase for staff.
The Campaign For Stanford, our major
fundraising drive, was launched two years ago
after a long planning period. At that time, it
was the largest effort to reach individuals,

corporations, and foundations ever
undertaken in the history of higher
education.
Its goal was to double private giving to
Stanford and to emphasize endowment
support. Reaching that goal will help
Stanford maintain — but not increase — its
scope and quality in the face of an uncertain
and often discouraging economic picture.
At the same time that BAP was underway
and the Campaign was being planned and
implemented, federal support was shifting
and shrinking. Hard and continuing work by
principal investigators and others was and
will be required to maintain adequate levels
of federal sponsorship.
To date, a relatively strong showing has
been made at SLAC and in the rest of the
University even while total government
support for high energy physics and other
academic research has overall failed to keep
pace with inflation.
The judgment that reserves can be called
on to cover basic expenses is a shortsighted
one. Reserves do exist to fall back on when
problems arise. But reserves are not solutions.
They are only a shc>rt-run way to keep an
activity going when a long-run solution is in
sight.

Basic expenses — like wages and salaries —
must be supported by income that can be
depended upon for as long as the expenditure
will be required. That is why endowment is
so important. Endowment is an
income-producing asset. Year after year, it
earns money to meet budget needs.
Reserves, on the other hand, are by their
nature limited. Once spent, they are gone.
Any continuing obligations met from reserves
must fall on other, permanent sources of
income when the reserves run out.
If the view persists that Stanford has
plenty of money, it will have to do so
without any help from the facts. For the
better part of a decade, Stanford's income
has not increased as fast as its expenses,
despite the extraordinary measures noted
above. Balanced budgets have come to
depend upon cutbacks, tradeoffs, and
reallocations, and they will continue to do so
for the indefinite future.
An offer was made early in the
negotiations to present the USE bargaining
team a description and analysis of the
University's financial make-up. The USE
leadership has not to date been interested in
such a briefing. The offer remains open.

cost-cutting alternatives. In developing our
budget for next year, we had to budget twice
as much as planned — over $1,400,000 — in
order to provide an average faculty salary
increase of six percent and a still higher
increase for staff.
The Campaign For Stanford, our major
fundraising drive, was launched two years ago
after a long planning period. At that time, it
was the largest effort to reach individuals,

corporations, and foundations ever
undertaken in the history of higher
education.
Its goal was to double private giving to
Stanford and to emphasize endowment
support. Reaching that goal will help
Stanford maintain — but not increase — its
scope and quality in the face of an uncertain
and often discouraging economic picture.
At the same time that BAP was underway
and the Campaign was being planned and
implemented, federal support was shifting
and shrinking. Hard and continuing work by
principal investigators and others was and
will be required to maintain adequate levels
of federal sponsorship.
To date, a relatively strong showing has
been made at SLAC and in the rest of the
University even while total government
support for high energy physics and other
academic research has overall failed to keep
pace with inflation.
The judgment that reserves can be called
on to cover basic expenses is a shortsighted
one. Reserves do exist to fall back on when
problems arise. But reserves are not solutions.
They are only a shc>rt-run way to keep an
activity going when a long-run solution is in
sight.

Basic expenses — like wages and salaries —
must be supported by income that can be
depended upon for as long as the expenditure
will be required. That is why endowment is
so important. Endowment is an
income-producing asset. Year after year, it
earns money to meet budget needs.
Reserves, on the other hand, are by their
nature limited. Once spent, they are gone.
Any continuing obligations met from reserves
must fall on other, permanent sources of
income when the reserves run out.
If the view persists that Stanford has
plenty of money, it will have to do so
without any help from the facts. For the
better part of a decade, Stanford's income
has not increased as fast as its expenses,
despite the extraordinary measures noted
above. Balanced budgets have come to
depend upon cutbacks, tradeoffs, and
reallocations, and they will continue to do so
for the indefinite future.
An offer was made early in the
negotiations to present the USE bargaining
team a description and analysis of the
University's financial make-up. The USE
leadership has not to date been interested in
such a briefing. The offer remains open.

Budget and Planning.)

The April 12 Daily quotes USE President
Jim Berk as saying, "The University is going
to have to offer us more. They're going to
have to dip into reserves to pay us. They have
to go back to the alumni and federal
government and get more money, which is
what they should have done all along."
Contrary to the impression conveyed by
Berk, the University has for a long time been
meeting the need for money by a
combination of tough-minded measures —
aggressive application for federal support,
extensive and sustained fundraising,
maintenance of high rates for room and
board, tuition, investment return and other
forms of income, and expenditure reduction.
The Budget Adjustment Program (BAP)
was begun in the teeth of a deficit of well
over $1 million, and for five years we have
been examining budgets for reasonable
cost-cutting alternatives. In developing our
