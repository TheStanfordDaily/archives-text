# Herman Slate's Campaign Criticized
##

Pamela Barnes

As a supporter of the Bacon
slate in the recent ASSU elections,
I feel compelled to respond to the
"reactionary" letter written by
Randy Bird which appeared in the
Wednesday, April 24 issue of the
Daily. It was reactionary in the
sense that Randy Bird responded
very defensively to statements
that were never made.
Bacon attributed his loss partly
to the "complacency" of his own
supporters who assumed he was
sure to win. He did however,
attribute part of his loss to
"reactionary" students who
supported the Herman slate which
seems to be an accurate statement
considering the letter by the
avowed Herman supporter.
The Herman slate's entire
campaign was extremely unjust
and reactionary. The Bacon slate
was not attacked on their
proposals or ideas, but on their
physical aspects. More
specifically, they were labeled as a
"special interest" group and as
being "peripheral" to the
Stanford community simply
because the slate included
minority members.
I find this highly ironic when
you consider the fact that every
individual has their own special
interest. It is that quality which
gives people their individuality.
The question should not be where
a person's own interests lie, but
whether they can successfully
consider other peoples' interests.
Self Deception
The Herman slate as well as his
supporters are only deceiving
themselves if they assume the
Herman slate possesses the
interests of even the majority of
Stanford students. Moreover, to
label the Bacon slate as being a
"peripheral" group is outright
racism. In other words, minority
students don't qualify as an
integral part of the Stanford
community.
Members of the Herman slate
left a rather distasteful note to
former ASSU Vice President
Charles Ogletree, telling him to
vacate the office while removing
his name plate from the office

door without consulting him
beforehand. In light of this fact,
none of tho name plates of the
other former council members
were removed, nor were they
given notes telling them to
immediately vacate the premises.
Such actions are indeed
reactionary and elicit strong racial
implications. Why is it that
Charles Ogletree should receive
less respect than other members
of the former Council of
Presidents? Is it because he too
has "special interests" and is a
"peripheral" part of the Stanford
community?
Voting Influenced?
In response to a final statement

in Bird's letter which suggested
that 800 Bacon should have
accepted his defeat in a more
appropriate manner, I would like
to mention the circumstances
under which the Bacon slate
accepted defeat. For one thing, a
number of polls were manned by
avid Herman supporters who
made no secret of the fact that
they were pushing for Herman.
It seems highly probable that
people in such a strategic position
could easily have influenced
voting at those polls. Moreover,
members of the Herman slate
spent Wednesday night of the
run-off elections in the ASSU

office. '
Also, Ann Carter in my
presence, stated that the door to
the office where the ballots are
kept was left unlocked. She
accused the former Council of
Presidents of being irresponsible.
However, only members of the
Herman slate occupied the office
which is officially closed at 5:30
p.m.
In conclusion, I think it goes
without saying that the entire
election on the part of the
Herman slate was indeed
reactionary and racist in nature.
