"I spent several days with Alley riding into the
ghost towns and the deserts which had once been
fertile plains. There for the first time I saw children
dying by the thousands, in a famine which
eventually took more than five million lives ..."
In another famine, tens of thousands of corpses
were picked off the streets of Shanghai.

That was China before the revolution.
Twenty-four years after the revolution China is
exporting food.
This last month, after no revolution, police fired
into hungry, rioting crowds in India, hundreds
stood for seven hours in the rain for a couple of
bags of food in Oakland, and tens of thousands
starved in Africa. Ehrlich and others have
attributed much of this to over-population.
The Chinese, however, have a different view.
Here are some excerpts from one of their reports on
the basic cause of poverty and backwardness:
People Valuable
"We hold that, of all things in the world, people
are the most precious.... Those views which
regard people as a negative factor, that people are
purely consumers and that growth in population
means an obstacle to economic development do not
correspond to the historical facts in the
development of mankind ...
"We hold that the fundamental reason for the
present poverty and backwardness in many
developing countries in the Asian and Far East
regions as well as in other regions lies in the policies
of aggression, plunder, and war pushed by

imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism, and
in particular by the superpowers, which seriously
destroy these countries' productive forces ...
"Old China's poverty and backwardness is
known to all. Under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China, headed by Chairman
Mao Tse-tung, the .Chinese people after a long and
valiant struggle, overthrew the reactionary rule of
imperialism, founded the People's Republic of
China, and are engaged in socialist economic
construction independently, self-reliantly, and in a
planned way ...
Production Doubles
"Over the past 24 years, China's population
grew from more than 500 million to over 700
million, an increase of more than 40 percent, but
during the same period, grain production more than
doubled.... Moreover, at present, China's
cultivated land only amounts to a little more than
10 percent of the total area of the country .. .
"China is a developing country and the living
standards of her people are still rather low.
However, starvation and unemployment have been
eliminated. There is food, clothing and work for
the people."
Birth control, in fact, is freely available in China,
not because of "overpopulation," but for the
liberation of women, the health and education of
children, and for planned production. Most
important, that production is in the framework of a
rational and fair economic system.
