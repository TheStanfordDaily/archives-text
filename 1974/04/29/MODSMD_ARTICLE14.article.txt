# Switch To GOP
## 
### 
jjj Friend, Harmatz §
Earlier this month Pete
McCloskey, R-Menlo Park, was at
Stanford just as he had been in
1972, once again asking students
to register Republican and vote
for him in the June primary.
"Thirty-eight percent of the
Republicans in my district oppose
my candidacy and will vote for
anyone except me because of my
opposition to the President," he
said.
McCloskey knew that his
outspokenness would bring him
nothing but political troubles in
the Republican primary. Still, he
was unwilling to tailor his political
positions based on the results of a
poll. "I'll get out of Congress
first," he said.
Speaking out against his own
party was not new to McCloskey.
In 1971 he had incurred the
dislike of many Republican voters
for challenging the President in
the New Hampshire primary in an
effort to stop the Vietnam war.
"As a Republican," McCloskey
wrote to Nixon in 1970, "I plead
with you to abandon your
intransigent attitude on
Vietnam." He continued: "The
young have a legitimate
complaint. Their friends and older
brothers are being killed and
maimed. In their view and in
mine, tank commanders and air
strikes destroying Vietnamese and
Cambodian villages have little
relevance to any ideological battle
between freedom and
Communism."
Near Defeat
For his anti-war posture,
McCloskey nearly lost his
Congressional seat in the 1972
Republican primary. His
opponents together received 57
percent of the vote while
McCloskey received only 43
percent.
Since 1972 McCloskey could
have remained quiet and gained
easy re-election this year. Instead,
he has been a national leader in
the effort to impeach Nixon.
On June 6,1973, long before it
was "safe" to discuss
impeachment, McCloskey
addressed the subject on the
House floor. "There should
certainly be no fear of considering
the constitutional process of
impeachment," he told his
Congressional colleagues.
McCloskey is aware that some
of his stands could be politically
suicidal. "Government tends to
award with its highest accolades
those who do not make waves or
step on toes," he points out.
But the simple truth is that
Pete McCloskey is not so afraid of
losing that he is unwilling to
"make waves."
Anti-War Platform
"When I ran against Shirley
Temple in 1967," he recalls, "the
voters in my district were in favor
of the war two to one." But "we
knocked on a lot of doors and
gave people the facts," and
McCloskey won an impressive
victory on one of the first
anti-war platforms.
Now that impeachment has
finally come into political vogue,
we cannot forget McCloskey's
courage in making such an early
and forceful stand. This year
McCloskey faces only one
right-wing opponent. He opposes
impeachment, supported Nixon's
war policies, opposes amnesty,
supports capital punishment and
as owner of $300,000 worth of oil
company stocks, wants to increase
the oil depletion allowance.
Support Needed
A great deal of national
attention will be focused on this
election. We must send a message
to Washington that we support
Pete McCloskey — that we
supported his opposition to the
war and that we now support his
efforts to impeach Nixon.
McCloskey's victory will not
only allow him to continue
working toward impeachment but
will also go a long way toward
signaling other Congressmen that
their political futures are
dependent on a vote to impeach
the President.
McCloskey's stands have not
made him popular among
Republicans, but as a Republican,
his opposition to the President
could not be dismissed as simply
partisan:
If McCloskey had never spoken
out against Nixon, he would not
be facing a serious threat in his
own primary. But he did challenge
Nixon, and now he may lose
because of it.
Registration deadline is May 5.
If you want to register
Republican to help keep
McCloskey in Congress, go to
White Plaza any day this week
between 11:30 and 1 or call
321-6121 or 326-1417.
