# Speaker Hits Media Stereotypes

### WENDY QUINONES 
To the strains of Rex Harrison
singing "Why Can't A Woman Be
More Like A Man," Matilda
Butler-Paisley Thursday showed
slides which demonstrated one
answer to that question.
Her slides were of
advertisements, children's books,
news articles, games, movies and
televisionâ€”all showing the limited
view most media convey of
women's roles in society.
Butler-Paisley, a lecturer and
research associate in the
Communication Department,
spoke on "Images of Women in
the Media" as part of a weekly
lecture series sponsored by the
Committee for Research on
Women (CROW).
Images in the media, she said,

have been shown by various
studies to have "significant
impact" on people's beliefs. "In
many cases the image actually
becomes the belief system," she
added.
Variety Of Rides
This applies to children's books
which show innumerable little
girls cooking, sewing and spinning
while little boys play outdoors in
a variety of roles, as well as to
television and movies in which
womens' images are further
manipulated, Butler-Paisley said.
Other media, such as classified
advertisements for a "girl Friday"
or a "production foreman"
further this limiting process.
Butler-Paisley illustrated her
lecture with a court document
currently in use in Santa Clara

County by counselors attached to
the Conciliation Court in trying to
save failing marriages.
The document allots the
responsibility for family support
to the husband and for all
housekeeping and meals to the
wife.
Levels Of Consciousness
This kind of limitation of
women's roles is both reflected by
and contributed to the media,
according to Butler-Paisley. She
outlined five "levels of
consciousness" evident in today's
media.
The first, which she calls
"putting her down," shows
women only as sex objects or in
other roles which are demeaning
in that context. The recent issue
here over "honey shots"
illustrates this level of
consciousness, she said, as do the
ads for pornographic movies.
The second level, "keeping her

in her place," offers a woman
only one respectable role: in the
home. "These ads don't put her
down," Butler-Paisley explained.
"They just emphasize that that's
where she belongs."
"Giving her a second place" is
the third level of consciousness,
which places women in a job. But
while allowing this as a secondary
role, Butler-Paisley pointed out,
"these ads still make certain she's
in the home as well." As an
example, she pointed out one ad
for soap which stresses a woman's
need for relaxation after a busy
day at the office and at home.
The ad shows her cleaning while
her husband reads the paper.
It is not until the fourth level is
reached that one finds equality
between men and women, while
the fifth level shows that women
can be superior. "But there aren't
too many examples when you get
this far," Butler-Paisley said.
