### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford's varsity tennis team
didn't let the rave reviews it got in
Sports Illustrated this week go to
its head as the Cardinals utterly
demolished its foes in the Ojai
Intercollegiate tournament,
winning the Thatcher Cup with 23
points compared to eight for both
USC and UCLA.
The Cards won all four
quarterfinal singles matches
Friday to cinch the win. Because
of this, Sandy Mayer, saying he
felt tired, packed up and left his
teammates to fight it out for
individual honors.
John Whitlinger ended up the
winner, scoring one of the greatest
triumphs of his life. Friday, Whit
beat USC's top player, John
Andrews, 7-6, 6-4. Saturday, he
crushed teammate Jim Delaney,
6-3, 6-0, and yesterday, he
downed teammate Pat DuPre 3-6,
6-3, 64.
DuPre got to the finals by
downing UCLA's top player,
Brian Teacher, 7-6, 6-1 in the

quarterfinals and then winning
Saturday because of Mayer's
default. Mayer reached the
quarters by beating Cal's Trey
Waltke 7-6, 7-5, while Delaney
topped UCLA's Steve Mott 6-4,
2-6, 6-4.
In do Ã¼bles play,
DuPre-Whitlinger won the title,
stopping Andrews-Hans
Gildemeister 7-6, 3-6, 6-3 in the
finals after scoring a 7-5, 6-3 win
over Teacher-Mott the previous
day. Teacher-Mott beat
Mayer-Delaney last week in
Maples Pavilion. The
Mayer-Delaney team reached the
semis and then forfeited due to
Mayer's absence.
In the concurrent open
division, Stanford's Chico Hagey
took the singles title, when
teammate Gene Mayer defaulted
due to a sore elbow with the score
5-7, 6-3, 1-1 in the final match.
Mayer came back to team with
Hagey to win the doubles final
over Robert Wright-David
Eastman of UC-Irvine, 6-3, 7-6.
