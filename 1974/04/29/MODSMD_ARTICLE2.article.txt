# Superintendent Speaks In Palo Alto
## Avoid Negativism, Warns Riles 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
"We have to get away from the
negativism that has permeated the
educational system," State
Superintendent of Schools Wilson
Riles told supporters last night.
Speaking to more than 200 people
at a campaign fundraising event in a
Palo Alto residence, Riles said, "No
one person can accomplish what needs
to be accomplished when you're
working for better education, but I
have been able to establish a new
climate . .. convincing people that a
change has to be made."
Riles, who is seeking a second term
in June, recently introduced legislation
that would require each public school
to offer special education for all
mentally and physically handicapped
children between the ages of three and
21. He said he hopes that it will pass
during this legislative session.
The measure is designed to give
handicapped youngsters a chance to
mix with normal children and to
obtain special education now denied
to as many as 175,000 California
children, he said.
'More Individualization'
The state school chief also spoke
highly of his new Early Childhood
Education (ECE) program, which
provides "more individualization in
the classroom" for children. The
program calls for California children to
begin public school at age
four-and-a-half.
The legislature allocated $52
million for the first year's trial run,
which should be enough to cover
one-fourth of the children in
kindergarten through third grade,
according to Riles.
To reach all students in the state,
Riles said the program would need
$350 million.
"I challenge those people who say
that education is already a top priority
in California. I don't believe it."
If re-elected, Riles said that his next

priority would be improving the
secondary school system by offering
more alternatives in education and
"different learning styles.
"Each student should master a
salable trade in high school, regardless
of whether the child is going to college
or not. We've assumed that you can
mechanize education, but that's
obviously not true."
Riles called for the setting up of
"internship-like" programs to spark
student interest.
Discrimination
The superintendent also said that

"children in ... California should not
be discriminated against on the basis
of wealth of the district."
He said that some districts only
spend $400 per year for each child
"which is ridiculously low," while
other districts spend $2000.
Riles charged that property taxes
cause this discrimination, adding "We
have to find a different way to finance
education."
School districts like Palo Alto are
really suffering because of inflation,
but property taxes are not the answer,
Riles said.
