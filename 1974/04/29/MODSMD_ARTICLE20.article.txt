# Cards Win Mile Relay
## 
### 
Stanford won the mile relay at
Saturday's Mt. San Antonio
Relays, running 3:14.0 in a meet
in which many of the best athletes
from USC and UCLA either did
not show up or were looking
ahead to the big showdown
between the schools next week.
Matt Hogsett, who was
suffering from a flu-like illness,
opened with a speedy 48.0 first
quarter, and when Bruce Henry
and Dave Bagshaw followed with
identical 49.0 legs, Scott Wingo
had .enough of a lead to coast to
victory in 48.0.
"One of the best races of the
day was the Distance Medley,"
added Stanford coach Payton
Jordan. "We ran faster this year
than we did last year when we
won the race, and yet we finished
fifth."
A spirited Arizona squad just
nipped an all-star contingent
which included Jerell Luzins and
Byron Dyce for the medley
victory. Card Steve Crowley, who
won the mile against UCLA last
week, opened with a speedy
3:01.4 1320, but Stanford hopes
wilted when Ken Kring was forced
into a dead stop by a sprawling
opponent on the track. Ben
Scheible followed Kring's 50.5
quarter with a 1:53.6 880, and
Tony Sandoval anchored with a
4:09.5 mile.
