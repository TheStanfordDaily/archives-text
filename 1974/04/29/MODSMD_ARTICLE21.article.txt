# Stanford Nine Routs UCLA
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
After Friday's rainout against
UCLA, a rainbow did not appear.
But Stanford's Mike Williamson
and A 1 Arthur found the pot of
gold on Saturday as they both
pitched nothing but goose eggs, to
begin the Cards' three game sweep
of the Bruins.
Stanford blanked UCLA 6-0
and 2-0 on Saturday at Sunken
Diamond, then survived an 8-7
slugfest yesterday to move into
second place in the Pacific Eight
Southern Division with a 6-6
record. USC, which won two
games out of three from Cal, leads
the conference with a 9-3 mark.
Cal is 5-7 and UCLA 4-8.
The "gold" that Williamson
and Arthur shared is a pitcher's
pot that has been up for grabs all
season. Pitching coach Tom
Dunton collects a quarter for each
walk, home run or
no-ball- two-strike base hit given
up by each pitcher. Needless to
say, the pot grew quite large
because of the pitching troubles
this season. But that all changed
Saturday as "close to $30",
according to Dunton,was won by
the pair.
'The pitching staff has done a
very fine job the last two
weekends," said Stanford coach
Ray Young. "We're giving the
pitchers enough runs to work
with."
Stanford 2, UCLA 0
Williamson twirled a sparkling
seven-inning one-hitter to launch
the Cards on a successful
weekend.
The tall sophomore

righthander improved his record
to 4-3 by allowing just five base
runners, none of whom reached
third base. The only hit off
Williamson was a single by Mike
Edwards in the fifth inning.
Williamson was staked to just
two runs. The first came in the
first inning when Joe Lamoure led
off with a walk, was picked off
first and forced a bad throw in the
run down to advance to third. He
came home on a ground ball by
Steve Davis.
Stanford's second run was the
result of a single and stolen base
by Dave Baker in the sixth and a
double by Kevin Sullivan.
Stanford 6, UCLA 0
Arthur attributed his victory to
"keeping the ball low, the most
important thing in the world." He
allowed just one base runner to
reach third as the Bruins got only
four hits.
"Both Mike and A 1 had great
command all the time," said
Dunton. "It was just a super job
by them."

Mark Lucich started the Card
fireworks, again in the first inning,
with a towering two-run homer
that almost cleared the green
fence in right field, 360 feet away
from home plate.
Stanford 8, UCLA 7
With Card ace Dave Frost
sidelined by tendonitis in his
pitching shoulder, Bernie Hittner
drew the pitching assignment for
Stanford. He lasted but one and
two-thirds innings before being
relieved by John Yandle as he was
tagged for five runs but the Cards
came back to tie the game at 6-all.
Sullivan was the big stick for
Stanford, hitting a devastating
three-run shot an estimated 430
feet and driving in four runs. Bob
Hampton added a two-run
(homer.
Kim Hannaford drove in Dave
Baker with what proved to be the
winning run in the seventh inning.
Dean "Bearcat" Stotz picked
up the win for Stanford by
pitching the final two and
one-third innings.

games out of three from Cal, leads
the conference with a 9-3 mark.
Cal is 5-7 and UCLA 4-8.
The "gold" that Williamson
and Arthur shared is a pitcher's
pot that has been up for grabs all
season. Pitching coach Tom
Dunton collects a quarter for each
walk, home run or
no-ball- two-strike base hit given
up by each pitcher. Needless to
say, the pot grew quite large
because of the pitching troubles
this season. But that all changed
Saturday as "close to $30",
according to Dunton,was won by
the pair.
'The pitching staff has done a
very fine job the last two
weekends," said Stanford coach
Ray Young. "We're giving the
pitchers enough runs to work
with."
Stanford 2, UCLA 0
Williamson twirled a sparkling
seven-inning one-hitter to launch
the Cards on a successful
weekend.
The tall sophomore

righthander improved his record
to 4-3 by allowing just five base
runners, none of whom reached
third base. The only hit off
Williamson was a single by Mike
Edwards in the fifth inning.
Williamson was staked to just
two runs. The first came in the
first inning when Joe Lamoure led
off with a walk, was picked off
first and forced a bad throw in the
run down to advance to third. He
came home on a ground ball by
Steve Davis.
Stanford's second run was the
result of a single and stolen base
by Dave Baker in the sixth and a
double by Kevin Sullivan.
Stanford 6, UCLA 0
Arthur attributed his victory to
"keeping the ball low, the most
important thing in the world." He
allowed just one base runner to
reach third as the Bruins got only
four hits.
"Both Mike and A 1 had great
command all the time," said
Dunton. "It was just a super job
by them."

Mark Lucich started the Card
fireworks, again in the first inning,
with a towering two-run homer
that almost cleared the green
fence in right field, 360 feet away
from home plate.
Stanford 8, UCLA 7
With Card ace Dave Frost
sidelined by tendonitis in his
pitching shoulder, Bernie Hittner
drew the pitching assignment for
Stanford. He lasted but one and
two-thirds innings before being
relieved by John Yandle as he was
tagged for five runs but the Cards
came back to tie the game at 6-all.
Sullivan was the big stick for
Stanford, hitting a devastating
three-run shot an estimated 430
feet and driving in four runs. Bob
Hampton added a two-run
(homer.
Kim Hannaford drove in Dave
Baker with what proved to be the
winning run in the seventh inning.
Dean "Bearcat" Stotz picked
up the win for Stanford by
pitching the final two and
one-third innings.
After Friday's rainout against
UCLA, a rainbow did not appear.
But Stanford's Mike Williamson
and A 1 Arthur found the pot of
gold on Saturday as they both
pitched nothing but goose eggs, to
begin the Cards' three game sweep
of the Bruins.
Stanford blanked UCLA 6-0
and 2-0 on Saturday at Sunken
Diamond, then survived an 8-7
slugfest yesterday to move into
second place in the Pacific Eight
Southern Division with a 6-6
record. USC, which won two
games out of three from Cal, leads
the conference with a 9-3 mark.
