# Cards Dominate Golf Tourney
## 'New' Baskins Triumphs 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Dave Baskins decided to
change his image Saturday, and
the result was an impressive
victory in the U.S. Collegiate
Invitational golf tournament.
Baskins, previously an efficient
but colorless performer, arrived at
the Stanford golf course bedecked
in flash white pants with red snow
flake designs. He walked
purposefully to the first tee, laced
a towering drive down the center
of the fairway and proceeded to
eliminate all challengers during
the next 18 holes.
Only his father, who paced the
fairways more nervously than he
paced the hospital corridors when
Dave was born, had any doubts as
to the eventual champion.
Baskins finished with a nearly
flawless one-under-par 70,
winning the individual title by
three shots while leading Stanford
to its fifth straight team
championship in the seventh
annual event.
And even though the
mammouth 30-team field featured
more also-rans than all-stars, both
victories were significant. Playing
head-to-head, Baskins defeated
the nation's top individual, Craig
Stadler, and Stanford defeated the
nation's top team, USC.
'Wanted It'
"I wanted it awfully bad," said
Baskins, who shared the second
round lead with Armando Claudio
of San Jose City College at 144.
"I was nervous for a while, but
after the fifth hole, I knew I had
it."
Paired with Claudio and
Stadler, Baskins was even par
through four holes, having hit
every fairway and every green.
Ironically, the fifth hole brought
Baskins' first mis-hit shot and his
first birdie.
After a perfect drive, he balded
a six-iron, barely getting his
Titleist airborne. But the ball
rolled within a foot of the cup
and Stadler could only offer a
cynical smile when Baskins tapped
in the putt.
Baskins carded more
conventional birdies on the next
two holes before finishing with
nine pars and two bogies for a
one-under-par 70.
Team Effort
Meanwhile, Baskins' teammates
were hitting some superb shots of
their own. Glenn Goethels, who
canned a 60-foot "seagoer" for a
birdie on the second hole, went
on to shoot an even par 71. Aly
Trompas also matched par figures,

and Conrad Nilmeier contributed
a 74.
It all added up to a convincing
team victory, as the Cards hit the
ball 14 times less than USC and
15 less than San Jose State. One
of the Trojan shots, however, was
particularly costly.
On the final green, Stadler
watched in amazement as his
six-foot par putt rimmed the cup
but failed to drop. He smiled and
walked around the green,
seemingly in search of heavenly
advice. Finally, he tapped it in
with the grip of his putter,
prompting tournament officials to
slap the roly-poly golfer with a
two-stroke penalty.
That gave Stadler a 75 instead
of a 73 and moved San Jose State
a shot ahead of the Trojans. The
Spartans, perennial bridesmaids to
the perennial champion Cardinals,
finished second for the fifth
straight year.
But the big story was Baskins,
whose precision shots came as no

surprise to coach Bud Finger.
After the victory, Finger said
that Baskins "has really worked at
it. Except for Tom Watson [now
on the pro tour], Dave practices
more than any player I've ever
coached."
So after Baskins had spent
Saturday night celebrating his
victory with smiles and
champagne, he returned to reality
yesterday by hitting a large
bucket of balls at the Stanford
driving range. "The Pac-B's are
only two weeks away," he
explained with a sheepish grin.
