Nixon Pressured For Tapes
WASHINGTON — Secluded at his Camp
David, Md., retreat, President Nixon faced
mounting pressure yesterday to reverse his
indicated course and surrender completely the
tapes subpoenaed by the House Judiciary
Committee.
The recordings are of such paramount
importance, declared former Atty. Gen. Elliot
Richardson, that they "could very well tip it
one way or another," as to whether Nixon is
adjudged guilty of criminal conduct.
As of now, said Richardson in a television
interview, "the case is closed."
White House sources have indicated in recent
days that Nixon would meet the committee's
Tuesday deadline with a limited, transcribed
version of the tapes, which are wanted in the
panel's impeachment inquiry.
But that would run counter to the strongest
advice of congressional Republicans, who warn
it could heighten the risk of impeachment
despite whatever merit might be contained in
the transcriptions.
Richardson said transcriptions would fail to
meet the legal command of the subpoena.
Moreover, he said, "a failure to fully meet the
requests for tapes justifies an adverse inference"
as to Nixon's guilt in the Watergate affair.
Sen. Jacob K. Javits, R-N.Y., said on a
separate interview program that even allowing
selected committee members and staff to listen
to the tapes would miss the mark. "They might
as well go the whole way," he declared.
The subpoena calls for delivery to the
committee by 10 a.m. Tuesday of tapes and
other records relating to 42 conversations
between Nixon and his top aides about the time
Watergate coverup was unraveling a year ago.
Segretti Case Influenced?
NEW YORK - Donald
Segretti says there apparently was a White
House attempt to influence his case prior to his
indictment but he wasn't aware of it until much
later.
Segretti, who was involved in political
sabotage of Democratic presidential candidates
and served a jail term for his illegal campaign
activities, commented in a taped interview with

CBS newsman Mike Wallace aired last night on
the "60 Minutes" show.
Segretti also said he was informed that a
reporter for the New York Times was given
copies of raw FBI files on him "to show the
press and the world that they had investigated
me thoroughly."
And he related that once when he asked his
"paymaster," President Nixon's personal
attorney, Herbert Kalmbach, for $5000
Kalmbach gave him $25,000 in cash in a brown
envelope, saying: "Here's 25, be careful with
it."
He said Kalmbach had told him that instead
of giving him checks for his campaign dirty
tricks, "he wished to switch to green."
Segretti said: "Perhaps it would have been
better for me to perhaps come out very early in
the ball game and say, all right, this is what
happened." But he said he was advised against it
by an attorney whom John Dean, then White
House counsel, referred him to.
Segretti said he gave the attorney full details
of his activities, and months later was told by
his lawyer that notes on his activities "were
Xeroxed and sent on to the White House."
Unions Push For Wages
WASHINGTON - The expiration of
economic control authority tomorrow will bring
a new push for higher wages as unions seek to
catch up with inflation.
Although hopeful that labor will show
restraint, Nixon administration officials view the
prospect with concern, fearing that explosive
wage hikes will only fuel the nation's boiling
inflation.
Government figures show settlements have
inched up in the first quarter, reversing a four
year trend. Strike activity in recent weeks is also
up substantially.
An indication of labor's militancy came last
week when the Machinists Union voted 5 to 1
against a new contract with United Air Lines
which would have raised mechanics' pay $1 per
hour over the next year.
Potential labor troubles also lie ahead in
construction, coal, longshoring, communications
and railroading.
"All the ingredients are there to have a very
difficult time," says W.J. Usery Jr., the

President's chief labor troubleshooter.
While Usery says there is heavy pressure from
the rank-and-file for more money, he sees "a
continuing responsible attitude on the part of
both management and labor."
Senate Democratic leaders are attempting to
push through standby wage and price controls,
but both labor and business have lobbied hard
against continuation.
Labor has argued that under controls, wages
were held down while prices soared.
Kissinger Leaves For Mideast
Israeli and Syrian warplanes resumed strafing
and bombing yesterday and gun duels continued
unabated as Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger embarked on his fifth mission to the
Middle East.
Israel, which lost 14 of its soldiers Saturday
in the highest casualty toll for a sihgle day since
October, said the escalated fighting could
damage Kissinger's mission.
Kissinger headed first for Geneva, where he
met for two hours last night with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko.
Kissinger was expected to reassure the Soviet
Union of a role in the Middle East peacemaking
and to discuss with Gromyko the stalled
U.S.-Soviet strategic arms limitation talks.
Kissinger planned to go to Algiers today to
meet Algerian President Houari Boumedienne
and was scheduled to confer with Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in Alexandria tomorrow.
Two Guilty In Chino Case
SAN FRANCISCO — A jury found two men
guilty yesterday of aiding convicted killer
Ronald Beaty after his 1972 escape from Chino
Prison guards.
Bruce Hobson, 24, of Mountain View, and
Morton Newman, 31, of Menlo Park, were
found guilty of assisting an escapee to avoid
apprehension, harboring and concealing an
escaped prisoner, and conspiracy.
A panel of 10 women and two men
deliberated 16 hours over three days before
returning the verdict in the six-week trial.
However, the jury did not reach a verdict on
whether Hobson was guilty of giving a gun to a
convicted felon as charged.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert F. Peckham

set May 31 for sentencing the pair.
Asst. U.S. Atty. David Bancroft said the men
could be sentenced up to 12V4 years each for the
offenses. Both were freed on $5000 bail.
One guard was killed and another badly
wounded when Beaty escaped on Oct. 6, 1972
while he was being taken to San Bernardino for
a court appearance.
Exile Returns To Portugal
LISBON — A tumultuous crowd chanting
"Death to Political Police" welcomed back
exiled Socialist leader Mario Soares yesterday in
one of the first public demonstrations permitted
in Portugal in years.
Soares, who arrived from Paris, was the first
politician to return from exile since the
government was overthrown last Thursday.
The country's new leader, Gen. Antonio de
Spinola, greeted the 49-year-old Soares at
Lisbon station. The two met privately for about
20 minutes.
Soares emerged from the meeting, saying he
had no personal political ambitions but added:
"I have for the Socialist party."
Spinola has promised free national assembly
elections within a year.
Soares spoke to the crowd, estimated at
between 3000 and 5000 persons, saying:
"The army has given people freedom of
expression. But it is not the army but the
workers and the people who must finish the job.
It is not the time for division. People who want
democracy must unite."
Soares, in exile since 1970, said the Socialist
party could agree to the ruling military junta's
program announced two days ago but called for
independence of the provinces as soon as
possible.
Spinola was reported to have told political
leaders Saturday that self-determination in the
provinces should not be confused with
independence.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy low
clouds along the coast night and morning
increasing tonight. A little warmer today. Low
temperatures tonight in the upper 40s to mid
50s. Highs today and tomorrow in the 70s to
mid 80s except in the 60s along the coast.

indicated course and surrender completely the
tapes subpoenaed by the House Judiciary
Committee.
The recordings are of such paramount
importance, declared former Atty. Gen. Elliot
Richardson, that they "could very well tip it
one way or another," as to whether Nixon is
adjudged guilty of criminal conduct.
As of now, said Richardson in a television
interview, "the case is closed."
White House sources have indicated in recent
days that Nixon would meet the committee's
Tuesday deadline with a limited, transcribed
version of the tapes, which are wanted in the
panel's impeachment inquiry.
But that would run counter to the strongest
advice of congressional Republicans, who warn
it could heighten the risk of impeachment
despite whatever merit might be contained in
the transcriptions.
Richardson said transcriptions would fail to
meet the legal command of the subpoena.
Moreover, he said, "a failure to fully meet the
requests for tapes justifies an adverse inference"
as to Nixon's guilt in the Watergate affair.
Sen. Jacob K. Javits, R-N.Y., said on a
separate interview program that even allowing
selected committee members and staff to listen
to the tapes would miss the mark. "They might
as well go the whole way," he declared.
The subpoena calls for delivery to the
committee by 10 a.m. Tuesday of tapes and
other records relating to 42 conversations
between Nixon and his top aides about the time
Watergate coverup was unraveling a year ago.
Segretti Case Influenced?
NEW YORK - Donald
Segretti says there apparently was a White
House attempt to influence his case prior to his
indictment but he wasn't aware of it until much
later.
Segretti, who was involved in political
sabotage of Democratic presidential candidates
and served a jail term for his illegal campaign
activities, commented in a taped interview with

CBS newsman Mike Wallace aired last night on
the "60 Minutes" show.
Segretti also said he was informed that a
reporter for the New York Times was given
copies of raw FBI files on him "to show the
press and the world that they had investigated
me thoroughly."
And he related that once when he asked his
"paymaster," President Nixon's personal
attorney, Herbert Kalmbach, for $5000
Kalmbach gave him $25,000 in cash in a brown
envelope, saying: "Here's 25, be careful with
it."
He said Kalmbach had told him that instead
of giving him checks for his campaign dirty
tricks, "he wished to switch to green."
Segretti said: "Perhaps it would have been
better for me to perhaps come out very early in
the ball game and say, all right, this is what
happened." But he said he was advised against it
by an attorney whom John Dean, then White
House counsel, referred him to.
Segretti said he gave the attorney full details
of his activities, and months later was told by
his lawyer that notes on his activities "were
Xeroxed and sent on to the White House."
Unions Push For Wages
WASHINGTON - The expiration of
economic control authority tomorrow will bring
a new push for higher wages as unions seek to
catch up with inflation.
Although hopeful that labor will show
restraint, Nixon administration officials view the
prospect with concern, fearing that explosive
wage hikes will only fuel the nation's boiling
inflation.
Government figures show settlements have
inched up in the first quarter, reversing a four
year trend. Strike activity in recent weeks is also
up substantially.
An indication of labor's militancy came last
week when the Machinists Union voted 5 to 1
against a new contract with United Air Lines
which would have raised mechanics' pay $1 per
hour over the next year.
Potential labor troubles also lie ahead in
construction, coal, longshoring, communications
and railroading.
"All the ingredients are there to have a very
difficult time," says W.J. Usery Jr., the

President's chief labor troubleshooter.
While Usery says there is heavy pressure from
the rank-and-file for more money, he sees "a
continuing responsible attitude on the part of
both management and labor."
Senate Democratic leaders are attempting to
push through standby wage and price controls,
but both labor and business have lobbied hard
against continuation.
Labor has argued that under controls, wages
were held down while prices soared.
Kissinger Leaves For Mideast
Israeli and Syrian warplanes resumed strafing
and bombing yesterday and gun duels continued
unabated as Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger embarked on his fifth mission to the
Middle East.
Israel, which lost 14 of its soldiers Saturday
in the highest casualty toll for a sihgle day since
October, said the escalated fighting could
damage Kissinger's mission.
Kissinger headed first for Geneva, where he
met for two hours last night with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko.
Kissinger was expected to reassure the Soviet
Union of a role in the Middle East peacemaking
and to discuss with Gromyko the stalled
U.S.-Soviet strategic arms limitation talks.
Kissinger planned to go to Algiers today to
meet Algerian President Houari Boumedienne
and was scheduled to confer with Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in Alexandria tomorrow.
Two Guilty In Chino Case
SAN FRANCISCO — A jury found two men
guilty yesterday of aiding convicted killer
Ronald Beaty after his 1972 escape from Chino
Prison guards.
Bruce Hobson, 24, of Mountain View, and
Morton Newman, 31, of Menlo Park, were
found guilty of assisting an escapee to avoid
apprehension, harboring and concealing an
escaped prisoner, and conspiracy.
A panel of 10 women and two men
deliberated 16 hours over three days before
returning the verdict in the six-week trial.
However, the jury did not reach a verdict on
whether Hobson was guilty of giving a gun to a
convicted felon as charged.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert F. Peckham

set May 31 for sentencing the pair.
Asst. U.S. Atty. David Bancroft said the men
could be sentenced up to 12V4 years each for the
offenses. Both were freed on $5000 bail.
One guard was killed and another badly
wounded when Beaty escaped on Oct. 6, 1972
while he was being taken to San Bernardino for
a court appearance.
Exile Returns To Portugal
LISBON — A tumultuous crowd chanting
"Death to Political Police" welcomed back
exiled Socialist leader Mario Soares yesterday in
one of the first public demonstrations permitted
in Portugal in years.
Soares, who arrived from Paris, was the first
politician to return from exile since the
government was overthrown last Thursday.
The country's new leader, Gen. Antonio de
Spinola, greeted the 49-year-old Soares at
Lisbon station. The two met privately for about
20 minutes.
Soares emerged from the meeting, saying he
had no personal political ambitions but added:
"I have for the Socialist party."
Spinola has promised free national assembly
elections within a year.
Soares spoke to the crowd, estimated at
between 3000 and 5000 persons, saying:
"The army has given people freedom of
expression. But it is not the army but the
workers and the people who must finish the job.
It is not the time for division. People who want
democracy must unite."
Soares, in exile since 1970, said the Socialist
party could agree to the ruling military junta's
program announced two days ago but called for
independence of the provinces as soon as
possible.
Spinola was reported to have told political
leaders Saturday that self-determination in the
provinces should not be confused with
independence.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy low
clouds along the coast night and morning
increasing tonight. A little warmer today. Low
temperatures tonight in the upper 40s to mid

importance, declared former Atty. Gen. Elliot
Richardson, that they "could very well tip it
one way or another," as to whether Nixon is
adjudged guilty of criminal conduct.
As of now, said Richardson in a television
interview, "the case is closed."
White House sources have indicated in recent
days that Nixon would meet the committee's
Tuesday deadline with a limited, transcribed
version of the tapes, which are wanted in the
panel's impeachment inquiry.
But that would run counter to the strongest
advice of congressional Republicans, who warn
it could heighten the risk of impeachment
despite whatever merit might be contained in
the transcriptions.
Richardson said transcriptions would fail to
meet the legal command of the subpoena.
Moreover, he said, "a failure to fully meet the
requests for tapes justifies an adverse inference"
as to Nixon's guilt in the Watergate affair.
Sen. Jacob K. Javits, R-N.Y., said on a
separate interview program that even allowing
selected committee members and staff to listen
to the tapes would miss the mark. "They might
as well go the whole way," he declared.
The subpoena calls for delivery to the
committee by 10 a.m. Tuesday of tapes and
other records relating to 42 conversations
between Nixon and his top aides about the time
Watergate coverup was unraveling a year ago.
Segretti Case Influenced?
NEW YORK - Donald
Segretti says there apparently was a White
House attempt to influence his case prior to his
indictment but he wasn't aware of it until much
later.
Segretti, who was involved in political
sabotage of Democratic presidential candidates
and served a jail term for his illegal campaign
activities, commented in a taped interview with

CBS newsman Mike Wallace aired last night on
the "60 Minutes" show.
Segretti also said he was informed that a
reporter for the New York Times was given
copies of raw FBI files on him "to show the
press and the world that they had investigated
me thoroughly."
And he related that once when he asked his
"paymaster," President Nixon's personal
attorney, Herbert Kalmbach, for $5000
Kalmbach gave him $25,000 in cash in a brown
envelope, saying: "Here's 25, be careful with
it."
He said Kalmbach had told him that instead
of giving him checks for his campaign dirty
tricks, "he wished to switch to green."
Segretti said: "Perhaps it would have been
better for me to perhaps come out very early in
the ball game and say, all right, this is what
happened." But he said he was advised against it
by an attorney whom John Dean, then White
House counsel, referred him to.
Segretti said he gave the attorney full details
of his activities, and months later was told by
his lawyer that notes on his activities "were
Xeroxed and sent on to the White House."
Unions Push For Wages
WASHINGTON - The expiration of
economic control authority tomorrow will bring
a new push for higher wages as unions seek to
catch up with inflation.
Although hopeful that labor will show
restraint, Nixon administration officials view the
prospect with concern, fearing that explosive
wage hikes will only fuel the nation's boiling
inflation.
Government figures show settlements have
inched up in the first quarter, reversing a four
year trend. Strike activity in recent weeks is also
up substantially.
An indication of labor's militancy came last
week when the Machinists Union voted 5 to 1
against a new contract with United Air Lines
which would have raised mechanics' pay $1 per
hour over the next year.
Potential labor troubles also lie ahead in
construction, coal, longshoring, communications
and railroading.
"All the ingredients are there to have a very
difficult time," says W.J. Usery Jr., the

President's chief labor troubleshooter.
While Usery says there is heavy pressure from
the rank-and-file for more money, he sees "a
continuing responsible attitude on the part of
both management and labor."
Senate Democratic leaders are attempting to
push through standby wage and price controls,
but both labor and business have lobbied hard
against continuation.
Labor has argued that under controls, wages
were held down while prices soared.
Kissinger Leaves For Mideast
Israeli and Syrian warplanes resumed strafing
and bombing yesterday and gun duels continued
unabated as Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger embarked on his fifth mission to the
Middle East.
Israel, which lost 14 of its soldiers Saturday
in the highest casualty toll for a sihgle day since
October, said the escalated fighting could
damage Kissinger's mission.
Kissinger headed first for Geneva, where he
met for two hours last night with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko.
Kissinger was expected to reassure the Soviet
Union of a role in the Middle East peacemaking
and to discuss with Gromyko the stalled
U.S.-Soviet strategic arms limitation talks.
Kissinger planned to go to Algiers today to
meet Algerian President Houari Boumedienne
and was scheduled to confer with Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in Alexandria tomorrow.
Two Guilty In Chino Case
SAN FRANCISCO — A jury found two men
guilty yesterday of aiding convicted killer
Ronald Beaty after his 1972 escape from Chino
Prison guards.
Bruce Hobson, 24, of Mountain View, and
Morton Newman, 31, of Menlo Park, were
found guilty of assisting an escapee to avoid
apprehension, harboring and concealing an
escaped prisoner, and conspiracy.
A panel of 10 women and two men
deliberated 16 hours over three days before
returning the verdict in the six-week trial.
However, the jury did not reach a verdict on
whether Hobson was guilty of giving a gun to a
convicted felon as charged.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert F. Peckham

set May 31 for sentencing the pair.
Asst. U.S. Atty. David Bancroft said the men
could be sentenced up to 12V4 years each for the
offenses. Both were freed on $5000 bail.
One guard was killed and another badly
wounded when Beaty escaped on Oct. 6, 1972
while he was being taken to San Bernardino for
a court appearance.
Exile Returns To Portugal
LISBON — A tumultuous crowd chanting
"Death to Political Police" welcomed back
exiled Socialist leader Mario Soares yesterday in
one of the first public demonstrations permitted
in Portugal in years.
Soares, who arrived from Paris, was the first
politician to return from exile since the
government was overthrown last Thursday.
The country's new leader, Gen. Antonio de
Spinola, greeted the 49-year-old Soares at
Lisbon station. The two met privately for about
20 minutes.
Soares emerged from the meeting, saying he
had no personal political ambitions but added:
"I have for the Socialist party."
Spinola has promised free national assembly
elections within a year.
Soares spoke to the crowd, estimated at
between 3000 and 5000 persons, saying:
"The army has given people freedom of
expression. But it is not the army but the
workers and the people who must finish the job.
It is not the time for division. People who want
democracy must unite."
Soares, in exile since 1970, said the Socialist
party could agree to the ruling military junta's
program announced two days ago but called for
independence of the provinces as soon as
possible.
Spinola was reported to have told political
leaders Saturday that self-determination in the
provinces should not be confused with
independence.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy low
clouds along the coast night and morning

As of now, said Richardson in a television
interview, "the case is closed."
White House sources have indicated in recent
days that Nixon would meet the committee's
Tuesday deadline with a limited, transcribed
version of the tapes, which are wanted in the
panel's impeachment inquiry.
But that would run counter to the strongest
advice of congressional Republicans, who warn
it could heighten the risk of impeachment
despite whatever merit might be contained in
the transcriptions.
Richardson said transcriptions would fail to
meet the legal command of the subpoena.
Moreover, he said, "a failure to fully meet the
requests for tapes justifies an adverse inference"
as to Nixon's guilt in the Watergate affair.
Sen. Jacob K. Javits, R-N.Y., said on a
separate interview program that even allowing
selected committee members and staff to listen
to the tapes would miss the mark. "They might
as well go the whole way," he declared.
The subpoena calls for delivery to the
committee by 10 a.m. Tuesday of tapes and
other records relating to 42 conversations
between Nixon and his top aides about the time
Watergate coverup was unraveling a year ago.
Segretti Case Influenced?
NEW YORK - Donald
Segretti says there apparently was a White
House attempt to influence his case prior to his
indictment but he wasn't aware of it until much
later.
Segretti, who was involved in political
sabotage of Democratic presidential candidates
and served a jail term for his illegal campaign
activities, commented in a taped interview with

CBS newsman Mike Wallace aired last night on
the "60 Minutes" show.
Segretti also said he was informed that a
reporter for the New York Times was given
copies of raw FBI files on him "to show the
press and the world that they had investigated
me thoroughly."
And he related that once when he asked his
"paymaster," President Nixon's personal
attorney, Herbert Kalmbach, for $5000
Kalmbach gave him $25,000 in cash in a brown
envelope, saying: "Here's 25, be careful with
it."
He said Kalmbach had told him that instead
of giving him checks for his campaign dirty
tricks, "he wished to switch to green."
Segretti said: "Perhaps it would have been
better for me to perhaps come out very early in
the ball game and say, all right, this is what
happened." But he said he was advised against it
by an attorney whom John Dean, then White
House counsel, referred him to.
Segretti said he gave the attorney full details
of his activities, and months later was told by
his lawyer that notes on his activities "were
Xeroxed and sent on to the White House."
Unions Push For Wages
WASHINGTON - The expiration of
economic control authority tomorrow will bring
a new push for higher wages as unions seek to
catch up with inflation.
Although hopeful that labor will show
restraint, Nixon administration officials view the
prospect with concern, fearing that explosive
wage hikes will only fuel the nation's boiling
inflation.
Government figures show settlements have
inched up in the first quarter, reversing a four
year trend. Strike activity in recent weeks is also
up substantially.
An indication of labor's militancy came last
week when the Machinists Union voted 5 to 1
against a new contract with United Air Lines
which would have raised mechanics' pay $1 per
hour over the next year.
Potential labor troubles also lie ahead in
construction, coal, longshoring, communications
and railroading.
"All the ingredients are there to have a very
difficult time," says W.J. Usery Jr., the

President's chief labor troubleshooter.
While Usery says there is heavy pressure from
the rank-and-file for more money, he sees "a
continuing responsible attitude on the part of
both management and labor."
Senate Democratic leaders are attempting to
push through standby wage and price controls,
but both labor and business have lobbied hard
against continuation.
Labor has argued that under controls, wages
were held down while prices soared.
Kissinger Leaves For Mideast
Israeli and Syrian warplanes resumed strafing
and bombing yesterday and gun duels continued
unabated as Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger embarked on his fifth mission to the
Middle East.
Israel, which lost 14 of its soldiers Saturday
in the highest casualty toll for a sihgle day since
October, said the escalated fighting could
damage Kissinger's mission.
Kissinger headed first for Geneva, where he
met for two hours last night with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko.
Kissinger was expected to reassure the Soviet
Union of a role in the Middle East peacemaking
and to discuss with Gromyko the stalled
U.S.-Soviet strategic arms limitation talks.
Kissinger planned to go to Algiers today to
meet Algerian President Houari Boumedienne
and was scheduled to confer with Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in Alexandria tomorrow.
Two Guilty In Chino Case
SAN FRANCISCO — A jury found two men
guilty yesterday of aiding convicted killer
Ronald Beaty after his 1972 escape from Chino
Prison guards.
Bruce Hobson, 24, of Mountain View, and
Morton Newman, 31, of Menlo Park, were
found guilty of assisting an escapee to avoid
apprehension, harboring and concealing an
escaped prisoner, and conspiracy.
A panel of 10 women and two men
deliberated 16 hours over three days before
returning the verdict in the six-week trial.
However, the jury did not reach a verdict on
whether Hobson was guilty of giving a gun to a
convicted felon as charged.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert F. Peckham

set May 31 for sentencing the pair.
Asst. U.S. Atty. David Bancroft said the men
could be sentenced up to 12V4 years each for the
offenses. Both were freed on $5000 bail.
One guard was killed and another badly
wounded when Beaty escaped on Oct. 6, 1972
while he was being taken to San Bernardino for
a court appearance.
Exile Returns To Portugal
LISBON — A tumultuous crowd chanting
"Death to Political Police" welcomed back
exiled Socialist leader Mario Soares yesterday in
one of the first public demonstrations permitted
in Portugal in years.
Soares, who arrived from Paris, was the first
politician to return from exile since the
government was overthrown last Thursday.
The country's new leader, Gen. Antonio de
Spinola, greeted the 49-year-old Soares at
Lisbon station. The two met privately for about
20 minutes.
Soares emerged from the meeting, saying he
had no personal political ambitions but added:
"I have for the Socialist party."
Spinola has promised free national assembly
elections within a year.
Soares spoke to the crowd, estimated at
between 3000 and 5000 persons, saying:
"The army has given people freedom of
expression. But it is not the army but the
workers and the people who must finish the job.
It is not the time for division. People who want
democracy must unite."
Soares, in exile since 1970, said the Socialist
party could agree to the ruling military junta's
program announced two days ago but called for
independence of the provinces as soon as
possible.
Spinola was reported to have told political
leaders Saturday that self-determination in the
provinces should not be confused with
independence.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy low
clouds along the coast night and morning
increasing tonight. A little warmer today. Low
temperatures tonight in the upper 40s to mid
50s. Highs today and tomorrow in the 70s to
mid 80s except in the 60s along the coast.
Nixon Pressured For Tapes
WASHINGTON — Secluded at his Camp
David, Md., retreat, President Nixon faced
mounting pressure yesterday to reverse his
indicated course and surrender completely the
tapes subpoenaed by the House Judiciary
Committee.
The recordings are of such paramount
importance, declared former Atty. Gen. Elliot
Richardson, that they "could very well tip it
one way or another," as to whether Nixon is
adjudged guilty of criminal conduct.
As of now, said Richardson in a television
interview, "the case is closed."
White House sources have indicated in recent
days that Nixon would meet the committee's
Tuesday deadline with a limited, transcribed
