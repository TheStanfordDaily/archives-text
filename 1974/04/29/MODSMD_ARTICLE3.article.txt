# Will Study Sun's Magnetic Field
## Solar Observatory Dedicated 
### GEORGE TIBBITS 
Stanford's new solar observatory,
located in the foothills above campus,
was formally dedicated Friday
afternoon despite a lack of sunshine
that caused the event to be moved
indoors to Annenberg Auditorium in
Cummings Art Building.
The observatory, scheduled for
completion next month, is designed to
study the sun as a star, concentrating
especially on the solar magnetic field.
Among the speakers welcomed by
President Richard W. Lyman were
John M. Wilcox, director of the
Stanford Plasma Research Institute,
solar astronomer Walter Orr Roberts
of the University Corporation for
Atmospheric Research, Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park, and
Valeri Kotov of the Soviet Union's
Crimean Astrophysical Observatory.
The ceremonies climaxed a two-day
Symposium on Solar System Magnetic
Fields sponsored by the Plasma
Research Institute.
The observatory will use a pair of
mirrors located within a 12-foot dome

on its roof to focus and reflect
sunlight to a diffraction grating at the
bottom of an 80-foot pit bored
beneath the structure.
The light will then return to ground
level where an electromechanical
system will analyze the sun's magnetic
field.
Routine operation of the telescope
and some preliminary analysis of the
observations will be handled by a small
computer.
A similar Russian facility near Yalta
on the Crimea will coordinate
operations with the observatory here,
making possible a near-constant watch
of the sun's properties from the
northern hemisphere.
The two installations are
exchanging scientists to insure proper
coordination. Kotov, the first visiting
scientist, will remain at Stanford for
approximately four months. Next
year, Phillip H. Scherrer, a research
associate with the Plasma Research
Institute, will visit the Crimean
observatory.
Roberts, speaking before the

approximately 150 guests at the
dedication, described the work to be
done at the observatory as "very much
at the cutting edge of solar terrestrial
physics."
"Climate change and changes of
weather is one of the most important
research areas," Roberts said.
He expressed the hope that with
the knowledge gained from such
research "we will better be able to
regulate the bounty of earth."
Researchers from the Plasma
Research Institute last year reported
evidence of a definite connection
between solar magnetism and the
weather in the northern hemisphere.
Roberts himself recently suggested
that sunspots affect weather and that
periods of low sunspot activity are
part of a cycle that match periods of
drought in the Great Plains regions.
The solar observatory is funded by
the Office of Naval Research, the
National Science Foundation and the
Max C. Fleischmann Foundation.
Architects are Spencer, Lee and Busse
of Menlo Park and the builder is
Stevenson-Pacific Inc.
