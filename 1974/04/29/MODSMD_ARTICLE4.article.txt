# N.Y. Jury Acquits Mitchell, Stans Of Perjury, Conspiracy Charges
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Former Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell and
ex-Commerce Secretary Maurice H.
Stans were acquitted yesterday of all
charges in connection with a secret
$200,000 cash contribution to
President Nixon's re-election
campaign.
Mitchell, 60, and Stans, 66, had
been jointly charged with one count of
criminal conspiracy and two of
obstructing justice in connection with
the contribution by financier Robert
Vesco.
In addition, each man was charged
with six counts of perjury, accused of
lying to the grand jury that indicted
them.
"I've been reborn," said a jubilant
Stans, blinking back tears. "I was
innocent all along, but it's good to
have it confirmed."
"I don't think Mr. Stans ever lost
faith, and I didn't," Mitchell said later
at a news conference.
'Faith In Jury'
"Our faith was resting with a very,
very fine jury. They were a
cross-section of the people and they
were representative of If
there is one place I am firmly
convinced you can get justice, it's
from the American people. I have
great faith in America and that's why I
love this country."
The U.S. District Court jury of nine
men and three women deliberated 26
hours over a four-day period in a trial
that began Feb. 19.
It was the first time in the nation's
history that two Cabinet colleagues
had been tried together on criminal
charges connected with official or
political duties and it was the first
time in half a century that any Cabinet
member faced criminal judgment.
'Vindicated'
"When the indictment was
announced on May 10th a year ago, I
said I had confidence in God and the
jury system," said Stans. "What I said
then has been vindicated by this jury."
"We had great faith in a man, the
President, to do everything we could
to get him elected. Everything we did
in that cause was proper and just.
"The jury's decision established the
kind of exaggeration that has taken
place in the last 18 months. It was not
only unfair, but it did not sell itself to
the jury."
Shadow Of Watergate
The shadow of Watergate hovered
over the trial, although the Vesco
matter was not directly linked to the
break-in at Democratic national

headquarters.
When they pronounced Mitchell
innocent count-by-count, defense
attorney John Sprizzo clapped an arm
around the former attorney general's
neck and pulled his head onto his
shoulder. Mitchell smiled broadly.
Stans was next. When the jury
concluded its findings, he sank back in
his chair. Stans put his head in his
hands momentarily. When he lifted it,
his eyes were wet with tears.
Changes
Mitchell and Stans were accused of
conspiring to obstruct a massive
Securities and Exchange Commission
fraud investigation of Vesco's
multimillion dollar corporate empire
in return for the $200,000 1972
campaign contribution.
Vesco fled the country at the

height of the SEC investigation into
his affairs and has successfully resisted
all legal efforts by the U.S.
government to force his return. He had
been indicted with Mitchell and Stans.
Mitchell still faces conspiracy,
obstruction and perjury charges in
Washington in connection with the
Watergate coverup.
His indictment there was held up
until the day following the
sequestration of the Stans-Mitchell
trial jury here, so members of the
panel would not be influenced by the
Watergate action.
Juror
Juror Clarence Brown, 50, a postal
worker from Ossining, N.Y., described
himself as a "law and order man" and
said: "I used to believe that when a

prosecutor brings a charge, they have
to be right. I learned an awful lot in
this case.
"When you come in with that view
and you go out with a different
verdict, then the prosecution didn't
prove its case."
Gov. Ronald Reagan of California
said yesterday he thinks the
Stans-Mitchell verdict will help
President Nixon in his fight to regain
confidence in the court of public
opinion.
Asked how the Stans-Mitchell
decision might assist the President,
Reagan said, "It possibly might make a
lot of people, who have that tendency
to accept accusations as guilt to be a
little more patient and let the judicial
process go forward."
