# C-15 Students Outline Ideas
## New Judicial Plan Proposed 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The student members of the
Committee of Fifteen (C-15) unveiled
a new proposal for a University
judicial system Friday, according to
Dale Snape, assistant dean of student
affairs.
Snape, an administration member of
C-15, said the "broad outline" calls for
the formation of a board similar to
the student board which recommends
credit for SWOPSI courses to the
Faculty Senate.
Under the plan, the all-student
board would make all judicial
decisions as recommendations to the
Dean of Students.
If he disagreed with them, a faculty
board would take up the matter. Their
decision would have to be approved by
the University President.
'Buffer Zone'
If accepted, this proposal would
"set up a faculty buffer zone between
the administration and the students,"
Snape said.
Both former ASSU President Kevin
O'Grady, a C-15 member, and current
ASSU President Mike Herman agree
that the new proposal should be
enough to reconvene the committee
next week.
However O'Grady had announced
three weeks ago that the committee
would reconvene last week.
'Things slowed down when it was
decided that Herman should know
more about the new proposal before it
was submitted," O'Grady explained.
Herman replaced fall graduate
Kimberly McCleary on the committee
last week.
The committee has been studying
possible University judicial reform for
three years. Snape said he can only
schedule a C-15 meeting at the request
of a majority of the members.
Even if the committee does
reconvene, a new proposal may not be
approved until next fall, for several
reasons, according to Herman.
'Lame Ducks'
The committee may not be able to
work out the technicalities of the new
proposal with only two months of the
quarter left, he said, adding that
student C-15 members who will not be
back in the fall are slowly becoming
"lame ducks."

Herman also cited "a general lack
of enthusiasm" by faculty C-15
members that he said threatens the
ability of the panel to come to an
agreement.
Snape warned that because of
student, faculty and administration
fatigue, the committee may not meet
again this year.
The current judicial system—known
as the Campus Judicial Panel "is
operating fine now and we're receiving
no complaints," he said.
The CJP is composed of three
student members, three faculty
members and the faculty chairman
from the law school who only votes in
case of a tie.
"The philosophical position [that
all parties governed by the judicial
system should approve it] is not

compelling enough to force a change,"
Snape said.
'Meaningful Participation'
The student C-15 members
disagree. In a letter to the Daily they
stated that the purpose of the CJP
should be to "safeguard individual
rights against institutional needs and
to allow for meaningful participation
by students.
"It is clear.. .that the CJP fulfills
neither of these purposes. It is
incumbent upon all members of the
C-15 to make a serious effort to
develop a system which has the
consent of all constituencies," the
letter said.
Herman said, "regardless of what
happens with the committee this
quarter, I plan to speak on a personal
level with faculty and administration
to see what their personal views are."
Personal views of the faculty and
administration C-15 members may be
different than the official views they
state at C-15 meetings, he contended.

O'Grady, a C-15 member, and current
ASSU President Mike Herman agree
that the new proposal should be
enough to reconvene the committee
next week.
However O'Grady had announced
three weeks ago that the committee
would reconvene last week.
'Things slowed down when it was
decided that Herman should know
more about the new proposal before it
was submitted," O'Grady explained.
Herman replaced fall graduate
Kimberly McCleary on the committee
last week.
The committee has been studying
possible University judicial reform for
three years. Snape said he can only
schedule a C-15 meeting at the request
of a majority of the members.
Even if the committee does
reconvene, a new proposal may not be
approved until next fall, for several
reasons, according to Herman.
'Lame Ducks'
The committee may not be able to
work out the technicalities of the new
proposal with only two months of the
quarter left, he said, adding that
student C-15 members who will not be
back in the fall are slowly becoming
"lame ducks."

Herman also cited "a general lack
of enthusiasm" by faculty C-15
members that he said threatens the
ability of the panel to come to an
agreement.
Snape warned that because of
student, faculty and administration
fatigue, the committee may not meet
again this year.
The current judicial system—known
as the Campus Judicial Panel "is
operating fine now and we're receiving
no complaints," he said.
The CJP is composed of three
student members, three faculty
members and the faculty chairman
from the law school who only votes in
case of a tie.
"The philosophical position [that
all parties governed by the judicial
system should approve it] is not

compelling enough to force a change,"
Snape said.
'Meaningful Participation'
The student C-15 members
disagree. In a letter to the Daily they
stated that the purpose of the CJP
should be to "safeguard individual
rights against institutional needs and
to allow for meaningful participation
by students.
"It is clear.. .that the CJP fulfills
neither of these purposes. It is
incumbent upon all members of the
C-15 to make a serious effort to
develop a system which has the
consent of all constituencies," the
letter said.
Herman said, "regardless of what
happens with the committee this
quarter, I plan to speak on a personal
level with faculty and administration
to see what their personal views are."
Personal views of the faculty and
administration C-15 members may be
different than the official views they
state at C-15 meetings, he contended.
The student members of the
Committee of Fifteen (C-15) unveiled
a new proposal for a University
judicial system Friday, according to
Dale Snape, assistant dean of student
affairs.
Snape, an administration member of
C-15, said the "broad outline" calls for
the formation of a board similar to
the student board which recommends
credit for SWOPSI courses to the
Faculty Senate.
Under the plan, the all-student
board would make all judicial
decisions as recommendations to the
Dean of Students.
If he disagreed with them, a faculty
board would take up the matter. Their
decision would have to be approved by
the University President.
'Buffer Zone'
If accepted, this proposal would
"set up a faculty buffer zone between
the administration and the students,"
Snape said.
Both former ASSU President Kevin
O'Grady, a C-15 member, and current
ASSU President Mike Herman agree
that the new proposal should be
enough to reconvene the committee
