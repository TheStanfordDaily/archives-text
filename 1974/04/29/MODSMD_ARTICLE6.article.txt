# Mediator To Attend Labor Negotiations
## 
### 
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) union announced yesterday
that it has asked a federal mediator to
attend contract negotiating sessions
between USE and the University.
"In an effort to avert a possible
strike," USE said it has asked Clarence
Washington of the United States
Federal Mediation Service to attend
negotiations beginning this week.
USE President Jim Berk told the
Daily yesterday that while
"Washington has no powers to dictate
a settlement, he has powers by
deference to put pressure on both
parties to reach an agreement."
"We want to put pressure on
management to go as fast as possible
to avoid walking out May 13," he said.
Berk said the union strike vote
scheduled for this week will go on as
planned and that the union will strike
May 13 if issues cannot be resolved.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger told the Daily yesterday
that the union's request for a mediator
"is a very positive step" and that the
University would be "really receptive"
to the idea.

Augsburger said he has seen "some
improvement" in recent negotiations
but that "a mediator would be very
helpful."
"Often the injection of a third
disinterested party is very helpful," in
resolving issues, he said.
Berk fcaid a mediator "was not
needed or essential," but he would be
"useful and helpful."
"We feel a mediator will show the
union is doing everything it can to
avoid a strike. His intervention will be
a decided factor in our behalf," said
Berk.
Augsburger said the mediator
would be to "everyone's advantage."
Washington will not be able to
attend today's negotiating session but
would probably attend the next
session, Berk said. A time has not been
set for the next session.
USE and the University have been
engaged in contract negotiations since
December. USE is Local 680 of the
Service Employees International
Union, AFL-CIO, and represents 1400
technical, service and maintenance
employees.
