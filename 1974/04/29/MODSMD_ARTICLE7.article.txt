Campaign Proposals
Editor:
In the past, the function of
Senior Class Officers has generally
been limited to planning
graduation and scheduling Happy
Hours. While continuing these
activities we wish also to pursue
the following programs:
1) Senior class escape trips —
ski trips to Tahoe; day trips to
Carmel;
2) Senior class project for the
community — e.g. continuation of
the effort to raise money to
purchase opticons; electric carts
for the non-ambulatory and other
ideas;
3) Senior class picnic;
4) Improving alumni relations
with the seniors — small dinners
or cocktail parties; career/job
meetings;
5) Senior dance in San
Francisco
6) A tribute to those seniors
who will be graduating in fall or
winter quarter.
Finally, in order to gain
cooperation and feedback in the
implementation of these ideas, we
propose establishing a senior
representative in each residence,
housing a senior, with whom we
will be in direct contact during
the year.

Candidates for
Senior Class Officers

Endorsement
Editor:
As Senior Class Officers for the
Class of 1974 we are very familiar
with the responsibilities of this
office and the commitment it
requires. Many of the functions of
the officers are static (e.g.
choosing graduation speaker,
organizing Class Day) but the way
in which these are accomplished
need not be.
There is also a large potential
for new activities and programs
sponsored by the Senior Class that
would interest and involve a larger
number of seniors than existing
activities. This potential should be
realized for the Class of 1975.
The slate of Pfeiffer, Dewell
and Schatzman desires to develop
this potential as indicated by their
proposals. They hope to involve
more seniors and increase
communication between seniors
by sponsoring senior week-ends
and senior class projects. Their
desire to represent all groups and
increase input from all groups is
evident in their plan to organize a
council of senior class
representatives chosen from the
residences.
Lise Pfeiffer, Jim Dewell and
Susie Schatzman possess the
energy and the commitment to
effectively represent the Class of
1975. We enthusiastically endorse
the slate of Pfeiffer, Dewell and
Schatzman for Senior Class
Officers for 1975.
