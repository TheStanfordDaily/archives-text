# On Packer Report

This statement concerns a
proposal made by the "Ad-Hoc
Sub-Committee to study the
distribution requirement in the
Humanities," chaired by Prof.
Nancy Packer. Discussion of the
proposal has revealed that there is
strong sentiment among faculty
members against allowing foreign
language courses to count toward
the fulfillment of the distribution
requirement. We are being urged
to introduce sequences of courses
in the humanities, at the expense
of language study and other
ill-defined "lesser" disciplines.
If the Packer proposal becomes
a reality, it will toll the death
knell of all courses in which
foreign literatures are studied in
the language in which they were
written. Enrollment in these
courses has already reached an
all-time low, since the dropping of
the University-wide language
requirement in 1969-70.
Despite this inevitable
consequence of the SES reforms,
a small number of students still
refuse to minimize the language
factor in the study of foreign
literatures. They know that
translation divests literature of its
value as a means of artistic
expression. Since academic
freedom often means the freedom
of others not to study languages,
they will not allow
interdisciplinary programs to
penalize them for other people's
ignorance in this area.
Report Prejudiced
But the future of such students
is threatened by the kind of
prejudice expressed in the Packer
report. There can be no doubt
that freshmen will gravitate
toward courses that satisfy the
distribution requirement. If
foreign languages are denied such
status, students will have to make
a special effort to seek them out.
With that kind of delay, they may
never reach the advanced stages of

language study.
It has yet to be demonstrated
that even beginning language
courses are devoid of intellectual
content. They are the
ground-work of a well-structured
discipline that encompasses the
study of syntax, semantics,
morphology and leads to the most
complex forms of linguistic and
literary analysis.
No one questions the need of a
mathematician to master calculus.
Why should language study be
challenged on the grounds of the
disciplined effort it requires as a
part of a well-organized whole?
Inappropriate Attitude >
At a time when the University
advocates "trans-nationalism," is
it appropriate to adopt a "let 'em
speak English" attitude, and to
deny the humanistic value of
foreign language study?
The Packer report contains
unmistakable evidence that SES
has been a failure, and that
students are generally not capable
of choosing their own course of
study. They have devised
programs which, to quote, are
"incoherent," lacking in
"breadth," "continuity," and
"historical perspective." Such an
assessment is long overdue. We
will not improve the situation by
further demoting language study.
Let us devise a responsible
curriculum instead, in which every
academic subject has its rightful
place. This will take courage, for
it means scrapping the laissez-faire
policies of SES, and laying down
definite requirements, presented
as such.
If we don't do so, there will be
another four year cycle of false
humanistic pretence, and another
sub-committee to undo the work
of the previous one. As usual, the
students will be the losers.
