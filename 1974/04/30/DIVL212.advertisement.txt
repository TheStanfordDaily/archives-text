HEARTS I
-the film that ran for 3 continuous years in one theatre in Cambridge, Mass.
In an isolated surreal pocket of World War I, the British send Alan Bates into a highly unlikely, tiny French town'to discover ~ : «§
a bomb. The townspeople have fled and the inmates of the local asylum have taken their place. The resulting interaction gives /|3I I'W?
us some of the most enchanting sequences on film. When the reality of the returning armies breaks the bubble and the inmates J® iV|l
have returned to the asylum, we can really share Bates' confusion about which people are really insane. In our opinion. KING * «
OF HEARTS is a rare treat; funny and sad at the same time. Past audiences will vouch for this, and we know you will too Xsmv
