Our HP-45 is one of two pre-programmed scientific pocket-sized 11
computer calculators with this key. That's one reason it's the most pow
erful pre-programmed pocket-sized scientific computer calculator. Here
are three of many others: JHHwM|i|||M
1. It's pre-programmed to handle 44 arithmetic, trigonometric and
logarithmic functions and data manipulation operations beyond the
basic four (+, —, x, ).
2. It lets you store nine constants in its nine Addressable Memory
Registers, and it gives you a "Last X" Register for error correction or B
multiple operations on the same number.
3. It displays up to 10 significant digits in either fixed-decimal or
scientific notation and automatically positions the decimal point through
out its 200-decade range.
Memory Register and also displays up to 10 digits in either fixed-decimal
or scientific notation. It's the second most powerful pre-programmed
pocket-sized scientific computer calculator.
Both of these exceptional instruments are on display now. If you're
looking for unprecedented calculating capacity for your money, by all
means see and test them.
