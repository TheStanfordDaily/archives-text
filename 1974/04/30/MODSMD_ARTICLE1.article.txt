# Nixon To Release Edited Transcripts
## White House Conversations On Watergat 'Will Tell It All,' President Announces 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fighting to
blunt impeachment moves, President
Nixon said last night he would give a
House committee, and then make
public, edited transcripts of White
House conversations that "will tell it
all" in theWatergate scandal.
Sharply attacking the Senate
testimony of his former counsel and
chief Watergate accuser, John W. Dean
111, Nixon traced for a national TV
and radio audience his activities in the
Watergate controversy.
He said he was waiving the
precedent of executive privilege to
make public the transcripts of dozens
of private presidential conversations.
But he said such disclosure was
necessary to prove to the public he
personally had no knowledge of the
Watergate break-in and did not
participate in a subsequent cover-up.
"I want there to be no question
remaining about the fact that the
President has nothing to hide in this
matter," Nixon said.
Lets Two Listen
The President said he would allow
the senior Democrat and Republican
on the House Judiciary Committee to
listen to the tapes and verify that none
of the deletions in the transcripts
relate to relevant Watergate matters.
His action, Nixon said, would quash
the "vague general impression of
massive wrongdoing" in the nation's
highest office. Nixon said he has
nothing to hide, and the tapes will
show it.
The President acknowledged that
portions of the conversations are
ambiguous because they are recordings
of individuals "just thinking out
loud."
Trusts 'Fairness'
"Never before have records so
private been made public," he said,

adding that he was placing his trust "in
the basic fairness of the American
people."
As Nixon spoke in a nationally
broadcast speech, the transcripts were
stacked beside his Oval Office desk,
each set in a notebook. One,
emblazoned with the presidential seal,
faced the television cameras.
Nixon said the notebooks contain
more than 1200 pages of transcripts of
private conversations he held between
Sept. 15, 1972, and April 27, 1973,
with regard to Watergate.
He said they include all relevant
portions of all subpoenaed
conversations.
Other Transcripts
The President said he would make
public not only these transcripts, but
also transcripts covering tape
recordings of 19 other conversations,
and more than 700 White House
documents, which already have been
delivered to the House committee and
the Watergate special prosecutor.
Nixon acknowledged that the
transcripts include material that will
be embarrassing to him and to his
aides.
The President also said he does not
know how the celebrated 18V£-minute
gap in one tape recording could have
occurred. But he said he is certain it
was not done purposely by his
secretary, Rose Mary Woods.
Challenges Dean
Directly challenging the testimony
of Dean, Nixon said again he knew
nothing of Watergate involvement or
cover-up until Dean told him about it
on March 21, 1973.
Nixon said Dean's disclosures on
March 21, 1973, were "a sharp
surprise" to him. The President said he
asked more than 150 questions of
Dean. He quoted Dean as saying at the

time he could tell Nixon had no
knowledge of the case.
In Senate testimony, Dean had said
that at a meeting on the morning of
March 21, Nixon said he was
impressed with Dean's knowledge of
the Watergate case and its
ramifications, "but he did not seem
particularly concerned with their
implications . . ."
In saying that he would make
transcripts available to the House
committee weighing his impeachment,
Nixon said the senior committee
members, Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J.,
and Edward Hutchinson, R-Mich.,

need only satisfy themselves that
transcripts are accurate.
Transcripts Not Complete
Nixon said the transcripts tl
contain do not cover everything th«
on the tape recordings subpoenaed
the House committee in its inqi
into possible impeachment.
But he said they cover everyth
relevant to that inquiry, "the rougl
well as the smooth."

today.
Rodino Wants Tapes
Rodino had said earlier in the day
that his committee would "accept no
less than the material specified," the
tapes themselves, in response to the
subpoena.
Another committee member, Rep.
Don Edwards, D-Calif., said any
procedure for screening the tapes that
would leave the committee without
the actual tapes in its possession
afterward would be "totally
unacceptable."
Hutchinson Satisfied
Hutchinson, despite some signs of
dissent from other committee
members, said earlier yesterday he
expects the tape transcripts offered by
President Nixon to be adequate for the
committee's impeachment
investigation.
However, he said a final
determination of the transcripts'
adequacy will have to await their
delivery and their verification by

Rodino and himself.
Rodino's office has said prior to the
speech that he would have no
immediate comment.
View Not Shared
Hutchinson's expression of pleasure
at Nixon's offer was not shared,
however, by some other members of
the committee.
Rep. Tom Railsback, R-Dl., said, "I
have some problem with having the
White House respond to the subpoena
by offering edited tapes, and I think
others will, too."
Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, called
Nixon's offer unacceptable.
Rep. Robert McClory, R-111., called
the offer satisfactory, adding, "whether
the President's offer will satisfy the
entire committee, I have no way of
knowing."
Committee member Rep. Jerome
R. Waldie, D-Calif., said, 'The
President's condescending statement
that he would permit Rodino and
Hutchinson access to the tapes is
contemptuous."
