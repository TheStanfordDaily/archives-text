# Why Wasn't Bruce Franklin Hired?
## 
### 
William Ross

The unanimous refusal last week of the
Colorado Board of Regents to hire fired
Stanford English professor H. Bruce Franklin
was not generally expected, but it is not
surprising either.
The question of why the Regents rejected
Franklin's appointment can only be answered
satisfactorily by the Regents themselves and
a small group of people within the University
of Colorado.
Several Regents claimed until the day of
the balloting that they would vote to hire
Franklin, and only one Regent, Dale
Ampkins, had publicly opposed Franklin's
proposed appointment. But several theories
attempt to explain why the decision was
made.
Some people have claimed that the 33-5
vote by the University of Colorado English
department to hire Franklin was actually part
of a plot to dispose of Frederick T. Thieme,
president of the University. Thieme was given
a vote of no confidence by the University
faculty last year and there has been a move
to dump him ever since that time.
Persuasion Attempted
According to this theory, several members
of the English department voted to hire
Franklin in order to persuade Thieme to
support Franklin. After convincing Thieme
that Franklin should be hired, they
convinced the Regents that Franklin was a
threat to the peace of the University. Hence,
Thieme's already tenuous position was
further undermined.
Despite the fact that the Regents fired
Thieme last week, I am not inclined to accept
this rather Machiavellian theory. Neither is
Franklin. It seems far fetched to suggest that
the rejection of Franklin and the ouster of
Thieme are directly related. It is not hard to

understand why the English department and
the Regents would have different voting
records in the Franklin case.
Franklin's fame as a Melville scholar
would naturally impress the English
department, while the Regents would be
more concerned with the political
implications of his appointment, fearing a
reaction among the people of Colorado.
Connection Plausible
But there seems to be at least some
connection between the firing of Thieme and
the decision not to hire Franklin. Perhaps
many of the Regents agreed with their
colleague Fred Betz Sr. who said that enough
tension had been created by the dismissal of
Thieme without adding to the controversy by
hiring Franklin.
Furthermore, it is possible that when
several of the Regents expressed support for
Franklin two weeks ago, they weren't fully
aware of the political activities of Franklin,
an avowed Marxist-Leninist.
Also, it is possible that the continuation
of political terrorism on the west coast bred a
reaction in Colorado of which Franklin was
the victim.
Early this month, Fred Betz said in a
Daily interview that "the events in the Hearst
kidnapping case give an impetus to those
people who agree that Franklin's views are a
danger to the peace of the University of
Colorado."
Renewed Violence?
At their meeting last week, some of the
Regents reminded their colleagues of the
campus violence of two years ago and tried
to associate Franklin's proposed
appointment with its possible renewal. There
was also a movement among conservatives in

Colorado to keep Franklin out of the
university.
Although Franklin claims that the
Stanford administration sent information to
the University of Colorado opposing his
appointment, this seems unlikely for several
reasons.
First, the University of Colorado would
rightly resent any such interference by the
Stanford administration in an internal
matter. If anything, the receipt of such
material by the University of Colorado would
only give credence to Franklin's contention
that he has been maligned by Stanford.
Second, Stanford administrators would
actually benefit from Franklin's appointment
to Colorado as he would cease to live in the
Stanford area and function as a gadfly to the
administration.
No 'Hate Mail'
Finally, several Regents have flatly denied
receiving any hate mail from the Stanford
administration. Although some of them have
acknowledged the receipt of material from
the Stanford area, they deny that it has
origins with the administration.
Franklin is correct in asserting that his
rejection at the University of Colorado helps
to make the Stanford administration appear
justified in its rejection of him. But for the
reasons outlined above, it seems unlikely that
the administration would send libelous
material to Colorado.
Hence, the decision of the University of

those of us at Stanford to fathom.

But there seems to be at least some
connection between the firing of Thieme and

tension had been created by the dismissal of
Thieme without adding to the controversy by
hiring Franklin.
Furthermore, it is possible that when
several of the Regents expressed support for
Franklin two weeks ago, they weren't fully

an avowed Marxist-Leninist.
Also, it is possible that the continuation

people who agree that Franklin's views are a

Renewed Violence?
At their meeting last week, some of the
Regents reminded their colleagues of the
campus violence of two years ago and tried
to associate Franklin's proposed
appointment with its possible renewal. There
was also a movement among conservatives in

Colorado to keep Franklin out of the
university.
Although Franklin claims that the
Stanford administration sent information to
the University of Colorado opposing his
appointment, this seems unlikely for several
reasons.
First, the University of Colorado would
rightly resent any such interference by the
Stanford administration in an internal
matter. If anything, the receipt of such
material by the University of Colorado would
only give credence to Franklin's contention
that he has been maligned by Stanford.
Second, Stanford administrators would
actually benefit from Franklin's appointment
to Colorado as he would cease to live in the
Stanford area and function as a gadfly to the
administration.
No 'Hate Mail'
Finally, several Regents have flatly denied
receiving any hate mail from the Stanford
administration. Although some of them have
acknowledged the receipt of material from
the Stanford area, they deny that it has
origins with the administration.
Franklin is correct in asserting that his
rejection at the University of Colorado helps
to make the Stanford administration appear
justified in its rejection of him. But for the
reasons outlined above, it seems unlikely that
the administration would send libelous
material to Colorado.

The unanimous refusal last week of the
Colorado Board of Regents to hire fired
Stanford English professor H. Bruce Franklin
was not generally expected, but it is not
surprising either.
The question of why the Regents rejected
Franklin's appointment can only be answered
satisfactorily by the Regents themselves and
a small group of people within the University
of Colorado.
Several Regents claimed until the day of
the balloting that they would vote to hire
Franklin, and only one Regent, Dale
Ampkins, had publicly opposed Franklin's
proposed appointment. But several theories
attempt to explain why the decision was
made.
Some people have claimed that the 33-5
vote by the University of Colorado English
department to hire Franklin was actually part
of a plot to dispose of Frederick T. Thieme,
president of the University. Thieme was given
a vote of no confidence by the University
faculty last year and there has been a move
to dump him ever since that time.
Persuasion Attempted
According to this theory, several members
of the English department voted to hire
Franklin in order to persuade Thieme to
support Franklin. After convincing Thieme
that Franklin should be hired, they
convinced the Regents that Franklin was a
threat to the peace of the University. Hence,
Thieme's already tenuous position was
further undermined.
Despite the fact that the Regents fired
Thieme last week, I am not inclined to accept
this rather Machiavellian theory. Neither is
Franklin. It seems far fetched to suggest that
the rejection of Franklin and the ouster of
Thieme are directly related. It is not hard to

understand why the English department and
the Regents would have different voting
records in the Franklin case.
Franklin's fame as a Melville scholar
would naturally impress the English
department, while the Regents would be
more concerned with the political
implications of his appointment, fearing a
reaction among the people of Colorado.
Connection Plausible
But there seems to be at least some
connection between the firing of Thieme and
