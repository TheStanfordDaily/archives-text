# Letters To The Daily'

Election Suggestions
Editor:
Our slate decided to submit a
letter to the Daily because there
has been a definite lack of
publicity about the senior class
elections and it would be very
embarrassing if we won this
election by a 4-3 vote. Hopefully,
there will be more interest than
that.
We are serious about this office
and have some suggestions we
would like to work on if elected:
1) A Senior "Ball" (we think that
this speaks for itself), 2) career
clinics and workshops with
alumni, followed by sherry hours
and informal dinners (contact
with alumni has been lacking for
all undergraduates and can be
particularly relevent to seniors),
3) a senior class all-night cookout
and beach party, 4) a graduation
speaker chosen with class input,
5) a senior class bike rally and
trips, 6) initiation of a trophy for
the top senior woman athlete
comparable to the present award
for the top male athlete, 7) a
senior rock concert (this may be a
little ambitious, but a
money-making venture such as
this sponsored by the class might
be both feasible and enjoyable),
8) mu/f/-cultural events—possibly
the senior class could contribute
to the Minorities Symposium in
October, 9) and lastly, improved
Happy Hours and other party
"functions."
The election takes place
Wednesday and Thursday, May 1
and 2, from 10-2 at the Post
Office polling station.

On ROTC
Editor:
So, the ROTC question once
again shows its ugly face here on
campus. You'd think that once a
body of 'intelligent" people had
made a decision it would be final,
wouldn't you? Or would you?
To begin this pro-ROTC letter,
I'd like to suggest that if you feel
any decision by a body as large as
Stanford is final, then you are not
only naive about the extent of
human wishy-washy-ness, but you
are also failing to perceive the fact
that this world is in a constant
state of change. Don't ever expect
an action to be final unless it is
irreversible.
The pro and con arguments on
ROTC are many, and how you
choose to make your decision is
your own business, but I suggest
that the University should address
itself to the real problems of the
real world, and kicking ROTC off
campus is a classic example of the
ostrich responses, "Out of sight,
out of mind," and "Hide and
maybe it will go away."
It is a return to the Ivory
Tower. (For those who would
point to what ROTC symbolizes
as a justification for ousting it, I
would direct your attention to a
quote by Freud: "Sometimes a
cigar is just a cigar.")
I think rather than running
from the injustices inherent in the
military and in ROTC, it makes
more sense to swallow a bit of
idealism, concede that for the
near future the military will

remain a reality, and get to work
trying to improve it. If you must
stay an idealist, try peddling the
Golden Rule.
I'll buy it if you will.

Editor:
Once again the Stanford Daily
(April 22, 1974) shed crocodile
tears over Bruce Franklin. What is
the reason for the front page
up-to-date briefings on his
"sufferings in this evil society?"
Franklin complained a year ago
about his "kangaroo" trial. In a
front page interview with the

Stanford Daily (Nov. 16, 1973) he
continued with cheap
demagoguery and lies such as
"under socialism this particular
kind of oppression is certainly not
possible" — meaning his
unemployment.
Your perfidious hero still
laments about "necessity of
overthrowing the dictatorship of
the wealthy." At the same time
this "idealist" published a book
on Stalin in which he defends a
real dictatorship and ignores real
kangaroo trials! It seems that the
truths which are for publishing are
carefully selected by the "last
bastion of democracy" — the
Stanford Daily.

On ROTC
Editor:
So, the ROTC question once
again shows its ugly face here on
campus. You'd think that once a
body of 'intelligent" people had
made a decision it would be final,
wouldn't you? Or would you?
To begin this pro-ROTC letter,
I'd like to suggest that if you feel
any decision by a body as large as
Stanford is final, then you are not
only naive about the extent of
human wishy-washy-ness, but you
are also failing to perceive the fact
that this world is in a constant
state of change. Don't ever expect
an action to be final unless it is
irreversible.
The pro and con arguments on
ROTC are many, and how you
choose to make your decision is
your own business, but I suggest
that the University should address
itself to the real problems of the
real world, and kicking ROTC off
campus is a classic example of the
ostrich responses, "Out of sight,
out of mind," and "Hide and
maybe it will go away."
It is a return to the Ivory
Tower. (For those who would
point to what ROTC symbolizes
as a justification for ousting it, I
would direct your attention to a
quote by Freud: "Sometimes a
cigar is just a cigar.")
I think rather than running
from the injustices inherent in the
military and in ROTC, it makes
more sense to swallow a bit of
idealism, concede that for the
near future the military will

remain a reality, and get to work
trying to improve it. If you must
stay an idealist, try peddling the
Golden Rule.
I'll buy it if you will.

Once again the Stanford Daily
(April 22, 1974) shed crocodile
tears over Bruce Franklin. What is
the reason for the front page
up-to-date briefings on his
"sufferings in this evil society?"
Franklin complained a year ago
about his "kangaroo" trial. In a
front page interview with the

Stanford Daily (Nov. 16, 1973) he
continued with cheap
demagoguery and lies such as
"under socialism this particular
kind of oppression is certainly not
possible" — meaning his
unemployment.
Your perfidious hero still
laments about "necessity of
overthrowing the dictatorship of
the wealthy." At the same time
this "idealist" published a book
on Stalin in which he defends a
real dictatorship and ignores real
kangaroo trials! It seems that the
truths which are for publishing are
carefully selected by the "last
bastion of democracy" — the
Stanford Daily.

Election Suggestions
Editor:
Our slate decided to submit a
letter to the Daily because there
has been a definite lack of
publicity about the senior class
elections and it would be very
embarrassing if we won this
election by a 4-3 vote. Hopefully,
there will be more interest than
that.
We are serious about this office
and have some suggestions we
would like to work on if elected:
1) A Senior "Ball" (we think that
this speaks for itself), 2) career
clinics and workshops with
alumni, followed by sherry hours
and informal dinners (contact
with alumni has been lacking for
all undergraduates and can be
particularly relevent to seniors),
3) a senior class all-night cookout
and beach party, 4) a graduation
speaker chosen with class input,
5) a senior class bike rally and
trips, 6) initiation of a trophy for
the top senior woman athlete
comparable to the present award
for the top male athlete, 7) a
senior rock concert (this may be a
little ambitious, but a
money-making venture such as
