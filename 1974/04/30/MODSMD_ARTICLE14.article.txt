# Nixon's Tax Fiasco
## 
### 
Carl Landauer

The recent developments
involving President Nixon's
dealings with the Internal
Revenue Service have exposed
lucidly the bumbling
incompetence of the President
and his lawyers in an alleged
attempt to reduce the President's
tax liability.
The specific items singled out
by the Congressional committee
indicate a lack of the type of
expertise and planning present in
the tax preparations of Nelson
Rockefeller.
The most striking example of
this incompetence was the sale of
the President's New York
apartment. Capital gain in the sale
of a residence is permitted to be
deferred if within the year, the
individual invests this gain into
the purchase of a new house "as
his principal residence."
Richard Nixon claimed that
the purchase of Casa Pacifica in
San Clemente was the purchase of
his ""principal residence." At the
same time, the President has not
paid California state income taxes
on the pretext that he is a resident
of the District of Columbia, which
demands no tax payment by
elected officials in the expectation
that they are paying state taxes in
their constituencies.
'No' Answer
To have the full cost of Casa
Pacifica considered as the cost of
his "principal residence," the
President answered "No" to the
IRS form question whether "any
rooms in either residence (were)
rented or used for business
purposes at any time." Yet, on
another page of his tax return, the
President utilized 25 percent
depreciation allowance of rooms
used for business for Casa
Pacifica.
Thus, the President's tax forms
labeled the same capital loss
twice. He had a $85,399 capital
loss in the depreciation of a
business investment (Casa
Pacifica) and a purchase of a new
"principal residence" (Casa
Pacifica) to balance the capital
gain acquired from the sale of the.
New York apartment. He
managed to avoid all state income
tax at the same time.
These items are examples of
blatant contradictions written on
the IRS forms. One wouldn't find
these explicit machinations or
misinterpretations on the tax
returns of Nelson Rockefeller.
Rockefeller, whose family has
managed great quantities of
money for generations, has
acquired an expertise in reducing
his tax liability. Most of his
practices, no matter how subtle or
unsubtle, do not appear as
contradictions on his tax forms.
Corporation Set Up
Rockefeller set up a
corporation to manage his
Pocantico Hills estate (the
Greenrock Corporation). This has
several financial and tax
advantages, even including the
fact that the corporation
purchases all materials for the
estate without paying sales tax.
(The state specifies that only the
"final consumer" pays sales tax.)
In this way Rockefeller avoids
paying the "four cents for
Rocky."
The 3668 acre estate is assessed
at $5,115,795 for tax purposes.
Under the equalization formula
this is approximately three-tenths
of an "actual value" assessment at
$15,347,385. During the
Depression the land alone, which
was then 1500 acres less, was
valued at $50 million.
Exaggerated Appreciation
The Rockefeller family often
buys art collections. After a short
period, they donate the art to
museums. The museum, out of
gratitude, confirms an assessment
that includes exaggerated
appreciation during the time that
the Rockefellers possess the art.
An investment can attain a tax
deduction double or triple the
initial sum.
There is a definite contrast
between the practices of Nelson
Rockefeller and those of Richard
Nixon under present scrutiny.
Rockefeller's practices are highly
sophisticated, incorporating
maintenance corporations, real
estate companies, charitable
institutions and the many
Rockefeller and Rockefeller
related foundations.
Nixon's practices incorporate
only pretended naivete and
misinterpretations of tax law.
Nixon's practices affirm his "boy
from Whittier" illusions of
simplicity. This crudeness has
resulted ir fiasco.

The recent developments
involving President Nixon's
dealings with the Internal
Revenue Service have exposed
lucidly the bumbling
incompetence of the President
and his lawyers in an alleged
attempt to reduce the President's
tax liability.
The specific items singled out
by the Congressional committee
indicate a lack of the type of
expertise and planning present in
the tax preparations of Nelson
Rockefeller.
The most striking example of
this incompetence was the sale of
the President's New York
apartment. Capital gain in the sale
of a residence is permitted to be
deferred if within the year, the
individual invests this gain into
the purchase of a new house "as
his principal residence."
Richard Nixon claimed that
the purchase of Casa Pacifica in
San Clemente was the purchase of
his ""principal residence." At the
same time, the President has not
paid California state income taxes
on the pretext that he is a resident
of the District of Columbia, which
demands no tax payment by
elected officials in the expectation
that they are paying state taxes in
their constituencies.
'No' Answer
To have the full cost of Casa
Pacifica considered as the cost of
his "principal residence," the
President answered "No" to the
IRS form question whether "any
rooms in either residence (were)
rented or used for business
purposes at any time." Yet, on
another page of his tax return, the
President utilized 25 percent
depreciation allowance of rooms
used for business for Casa
Pacifica.
Thus, the President's tax forms
labeled the same capital loss
twice. He had a $85,399 capital
loss in the depreciation of a
business investment (Casa
Pacifica) and a purchase of a new
"principal residence" (Casa
Pacifica) to balance the capital
gain acquired from the sale of the.
New York apartment. He
managed to avoid all state income
tax at the same time.
These items are examples of
blatant contradictions written on
the IRS forms. One wouldn't find
these explicit machinations or
misinterpretations on the tax
returns of Nelson Rockefeller.
Rockefeller, whose family has
managed great quantities of
money for generations, has
acquired an expertise in reducing
his tax liability. Most of his
practices, no matter how subtle or
unsubtle, do not appear as
contradictions on his tax forms.
Corporation Set Up
Rockefeller set up a
corporation to manage his
Pocantico Hills estate (the
Greenrock Corporation). This has
several financial and tax
advantages, even including the
fact that the corporation
purchases all materials for the
estate without paying sales tax.
(The state specifies that only the
"final consumer" pays sales tax.)
In this way Rockefeller avoids
paying the "four cents for
Rocky."
The 3668 acre estate is assessed
at $5,115,795 for tax purposes.
Under the equalization formula
this is approximately three-tenths
of an "actual value" assessment at
$15,347,385. During the
Depression the land alone, which
was then 1500 acres less, was
valued at $50 million.
Exaggerated Appreciation
The Rockefeller family often
buys art collections. After a short
period, they donate the art to
museums. The museum, out of
gratitude, confirms an assessment
that includes exaggerated
appreciation during the time that
the Rockefellers possess the art.
An investment can attain a tax
deduction double or triple the
initial sum.
There is a definite contrast
between the practices of Nelson
Rockefeller and those of Richard
Nixon under present scrutiny.
Rockefeller's practices are highly
sophisticated, incorporating
maintenance corporations, real
estate companies, charitable
institutions and the many
Rockefeller and Rockefeller
related foundations.
Nixon's practices incorporate
only pretended naivete and
misinterpretations of tax law.
Nixon's practices affirm his "boy
from Whittier" illusions of
simplicity. This crudeness has
resulted ir fiasco.
