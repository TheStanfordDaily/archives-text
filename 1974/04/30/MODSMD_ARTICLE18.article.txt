# 'Badlands' Gives An Unreal Reality
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Remember that scene in Giant
where James Dean stands, outlined
against the horizon, a rifle slung
casually straight across his back,
his hands dangling loosely from
both barrel and butt? Such
super-cool scenes made thousands
of young men who grew up in the
1950s want to be like James
Dean.
In Badlands Martin Sheen gets
his chance to do a similar scene
portraying Kit Carruthers, a
listless 25-year-old raised on the
plains of South Dakota. He meets
and sort of falls in love with a
rather bland 15-year-old of like
background, Holly Stargis (Sissy
Space k).
The confining banality of their
existance gets to be too much, so
they attempt to make their own
world by getting rid of the main
obstacle to their living together,
Holly's father (Warren Oates).
People won't let them live in
peace in their tree house in the

wilderness, so Kit and Holly
embark on a sort of James Dean
as Charles Starkweather murder
spree. Just like Starkweather did
in Nebraska in 1958, Kit does in
South Dakota-Montana in 1959,
killing everyone who seems to be
remotely threatening, while Holly
looks on as if she were watching
"The Untouchables" on
television.
This strange fantasy of a young

couple slowly being driven into
insanity by the confining
sameness of the Dakota badlands
was written, produced and
directed by Terrence Malick. It's
his first film, an auspicious debut
that's mannered in spots, but
succeeds in creating the most
unreal reality this side of 2001.
The low-key, but intense acting
of the two principals, Sheen and
Spacek, is a main factor in the
film's success. Sheen has

portrayed a variety of roles in
both film and television which
have been rich in character, but
short in virility.
As Kit in Badlands Sheen plays
a character every bit as confused
as the unwilling soldier in The
Execution of Private Slovak. But
there is no confusion about Kit's
machismo, or his ability to drive a
car or handle weapons, which
were tremendous virility symbols

in 1959 South Dakota.
That's why Kit becomes so
popular with the police after his
capture. In the sly grins of the
officers of the law, you see an
almost deferential respect for his
shooting spree. In a perverse way,
Kit finally gets individual
recognition that would never be
his as a garbage collector or stock
yard worker.
Holly, on the other hand,
remains near zombie-like

throughout, providing a trite,
banal voice over narration that
bulldozes her vacuous viewpoint
of the whole affair right into the
audience.
In fact, her comments are so
inane and cloying that they
become a distracting counterpoint
to what's happening on the
screen. But in demeanor, Spacek
is perfect in a part much more
demanding than that of Lee
Marvin's companion in the
raunchy, violence-filled Prime
Cut.
Even with its stylistic excesses,
Badlands remains an engrossing
film, if you like a fantasy that just
happens to be about a polite
murderer and his accomplice. It's
a film about those forgotten
Americans, the "little people," as
hard to categorize as most Stanley
Kubrick movies.

Badlands might best be
thought of as an acutely skewed
version of certain parts of In Cold
Blood. In that film the Great
Plains became desolate, forboding,
and drove men to commit twisted,
insane acts.
In Badlands, though, the
prairies become a vast surreal
canvas, with magic mountains in
the distance where all your
dreams can come true; where you
can even dance in the glow of a
car's headlights to a Nat King Cole
song, lost but not uncomfortable
in the inky vastness.
It's that kind of a movie, which
every frame can have symbolic
meaning and be the subject of
endless words of speculation and
criticism. So if you have a
hankering for non-Walt Disney
fantasy, Badlands is well worth
seeing.

popular with the police after his
capture. In the sly grins of the
officers of the law, you see an
almost deferential respect for his
shooting spree. In a perverse way,
Kit finally gets individual
recognition that would never be
his as a garbage collector or stock
yard worker.
Holly, on the other hand,
remains near zombie-like

throughout, providing a trite,
banal voice over narration that
bulldozes her vacuous viewpoint
of the whole affair right into the
audience.
In fact, her comments are so
inane and cloying that they
become a distracting counterpoint
to what's happening on the
screen. But in demeanor, Spacek
is perfect in a part much more
demanding than that of Lee
Marvin's companion in the
raunchy, violence-filled Prime
Cut.
Even with its stylistic excesses,
Badlands remains an engrossing
film, if you like a fantasy that just
happens to be about a polite
murderer and his accomplice. It's
a film about those forgotten
Americans, the "little people," as
hard to categorize as most Stanley
Kubrick movies.

Badlands might best be
thought of as an acutely skewed
version of certain parts of In Cold
Blood. In that film the Great
Plains became desolate, forboding,
and drove men to commit twisted,
insane acts.
In Badlands, though, the
prairies become a vast surreal
canvas, with magic mountains in
the distance where all your
dreams can come true; where you
can even dance in the glow of a
car's headlights to a Nat King Cole
song, lost but not uncomfortable
in the inky vastness.
It's that kind of a movie, which
every frame can have symbolic
meaning and be the subject of
endless words of speculation and
criticism. So if you have a
hankering for non-Walt Disney
fantasy, Badlands is well worth
seeing.

Remember that scene in Giant
where James Dean stands, outlined
against the horizon, a rifle slung
casually straight across his back,
his hands dangling loosely from
both barrel and butt? Such
super-cool scenes made thousands
of young men who grew up in the
1950s want to be like James
Dean.
In Badlands Martin Sheen gets
his chance to do a similar scene
portraying Kit Carruthers, a
listless 25-year-old raised on the
plains of South Dakota. He meets
and sort of falls in love with a
rather bland 15-year-old of like
background, Holly Stargis (Sissy
Space k).
The confining banality of their
existance gets to be too much, so
they attempt to make their own
world by getting rid of the main
obstacle to their living together,
Holly's father (Warren Oates).
People won't let them live in
peace in their tree house in the

wilderness, so Kit and Holly
embark on a sort of James Dean
as Charles Starkweather murder
spree. Just like Starkweather did
in Nebraska in 1958, Kit does in
South Dakota-Montana in 1959,
killing everyone who seems to be
remotely threatening, while Holly
looks on as if she were watching
"The Untouchables" on
television.
This strange fantasy of a young

couple slowly being driven into
insanity by the confining
sameness of the Dakota badlands
was written, produced and
directed by Terrence Malick. It's
his first film, an auspicious debut
that's mannered in spots, but
succeeds in creating the most
unreal reality this side of 2001.
The low-key, but intense acting
of the two principals, Sheen and
Spacek, is a main factor in the
film's success. Sheen has

portrayed a variety of roles in
both film and television which
have been rich in character, but
short in virility.
As Kit in Badlands Sheen plays
a character every bit as confused
as the unwilling soldier in The
Execution of Private Slovak. But
there is no confusion about Kit's
machismo, or his ability to drive a
car or handle weapons, which
were tremendous virility symbols

in 1959 South Dakota.
That's why Kit becomes so
popular with the police after his
capture. In the sly grins of the
officers of the law, you see an
almost deferential respect for his
shooting spree. In a perverse way,
Kit finally gets individual
recognition that would never be
his as a garbage collector or stock
yard worker.
