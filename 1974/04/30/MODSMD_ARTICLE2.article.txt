# Anti-Franklin Plan Topic Of FBI Note?
## 
### BILL EVERS 
A recent re-evaluation of an FBI
memorandum released on March 7
seems to indicate that in December
1970 the FBI suspended or halted a
proposed disruption program directed
against the political activities of
since-fired Stanford English Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin.
Leonard Siegel, a member of the
Pacific Studies Center research group
in East Palo Alto, made the new
assessment of the memorandum last
Friday while examining a set of
internal FBI documents. The
documents had been released in
censored form by the Justice
Department as a result of a Freedom
of Information Act suit brought by
NBC reporter Carl Stem.
Siegel found a Dec. 24, 1970
memorandum from FBI Director J.
Edgar Hoover to the Special Agent in
charge of the FBl's San Francisco
office. "It obviously referred to Prof.
Franklin," Siegel said of the document
later that day.
'Franklin' Fits Space
Close examination of the
photographically reproduced text of
the document shows (1) the words
"Bruce Franklin" and "Franklin" fit
exactly in the typewriter letter spaces
where someone's name has been
deleted; (2) the initials "RU," standing
for the Revolutionary Union — the
communist group to which Franklin
belonged — fit in the spaces where
organizational initials originally were;
and (3) the date of the memorandum
matches the date of the split between
the present-day RU and the Peninsula
radical group led by Franklin that
subsequently became the now-defunct
Venceremos organization.
Inserting what is believed to have
been deleted, this memorandum reads:
"[Re previous correspondence]
outlining a proposed disruptive
technique to be applied against RU
leader H. Bruce Franklin with the
objective of neutralizing the?].
"Recent information indicates that
Franklin has broken with the RU

organization and is in the process of
forming a new group. For this reason,
and because of the expanding
complexities of the proposed
technique, no further action should be
taken on this suggested disruptive
technique."
Part Of FBI Plan
The memorandum is part of the
FBl's internal correspondence on what
it called its COINTELPRO
(counterintelligence program) effort to
"expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit,
or otherwise neutralize" radical
political groups.
The March 22 issue of The Militant,
a Trotskyist weekly newspaper, said
this same memorandum referred to the
split between Eldridge Cleaver and
W'jey Newton in the Black Panther
Party. However, Cleaver was at the
time in Algeria not the Bay Area, his
name does not fit in the blanks
properly, and the split in the Black
Panthers occurred in late February,
1971.
Franklin, in an interview with the
Daily, added that he knew from
"first-hand evidence" that at that time
the New York Panther 21, a group of
trial defendants who supported
Cleaver's position, were "out here
having meetings with the Oakland
people," who supported the Newton
position. Therefore, the Panthers were
still united at the time the
memorandum was written.
Franklin believes that the
memorandum is referring to him and
says"it proves what we have been
saying" about police provocateurs and
"the kind of operation they conduct."
Memorandum 'Outrage'
Charles Marson, legal director of
the Northern California American Civil
Liberties Union, called the
memorandum and the disruption
program mentioned in it "an outrage."
Such disruption programs, Marson
stated, were "wholly illegal." He said
that the typical pattern was
infiltration by a provocateur, who
would then urge illegal acts which
