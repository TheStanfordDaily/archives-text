Tickets are still available for this Sunday's concert in Frost
Amphitheater featuring Canadian singer-composer Gordon
Lightfoot and the father-and-son team of Doc and Merle
Watson.
Lightfoot has recorded a dozen albums,*but was relatively
unknown to American audiences until his only AM hit, "If
You Could Read My Mind/' climbed the charts in 1970.
Indeed, the sea ballads, love songs, and rebellious lyrics that
make Lightfoot Lightfoot are impossible to label on the merits
of one song.
With Lightfoot will be Doc and Merle Watson, bluegrass
musicians who played last weekend at the Golden State
Country Bluegrass Festival in Marin.
Tickets are available at Tresidder Box Office for $3.50.
Gates open at noon, and the concert begins at 2 p.m.
