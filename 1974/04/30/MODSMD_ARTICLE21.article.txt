# Carmen McRae Swings
## 
### VICKI LaBRIE 
SAN FRANCISCO—There was
standing room only Friday night
at the Great American Music Hall
as Carmen Mcßae carried on her
love affair with San Francisco and
it with her. Each song was met
with thunderous applause amid
cries of "We love you, Carmen"
from the audience and she did her
utmost to please them.
When a song is given the
Carmen Mcßae treatment, it
undergoes a metamorphosis and
emerges with a new life, a new
feeling full of thought. She has a
way of savoring each word and
pulling out subtle shades of
meaning that were never there
before by sliding notes, giving
words onomatopoeic aspects, or a
yodel-like vibrato. A lot of
imagination goes into the
arranging, mood, and performance
of each song.
Miss Mcßae's back up group
has changed since she was here
last December but the members
continue to display the
professional wisdom and good
taste that always characterizes

Carmen's musicians. On piano was
Pat Manago, the bassist was
Monty Budwig and Ted Hawk
played drums.
Carmen's repertoire consists
mainly of standards with a few
contemporary songs sandwiched
in. Among the oldies were "Them
There Eyes," Thelonious Monk's
composition "Round Midnight,"
which she does with breathtaking
care, and "Our Love is Here to
Stay." Of the newer songs,
Manago displayed particularly fine
embellishments on "A Song for
You" and the Latinesque
accompaniment worked well with
"Sunshine of My Life."
Although Miss Mcßae is a
master of most song styles, her
forte is the uptempo number. She
can really swing ("Day by Day"
and "A Foggy Day in London
Town") and the arrangements are
always tight and intense.
During both sets, Carmen sat

down at the piano and did several
songs without the group; in
between she entertained the
crowd with musical anecdotes and
friendly patter.
Although there were pleas for
another set (most shows at the
Great American Music Hall offer
3), she had extended her 2nd set
by half an hour and Miss Mcßae
believes in never giving too much
to an audience or they might
become saturated. I don't think
Carmen Mcßae has to worry
about that in San Francisco.
