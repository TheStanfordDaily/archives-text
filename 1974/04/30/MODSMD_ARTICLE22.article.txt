Forewoman: Jurors Doubled Dean
NEW YORK — The forewoman of the jury that
acquitted John N. Mitchell and Maurice H. Stans said
yesterday the jurors doubted the truthfulness of John W.
Dean 111, a key government witness at the criminal
conspiracy trial of the former Cabinet members.
Sybil Kucharski, 21, a Westchester County bank teller,
said she and the other jurors were convinced Mitchell and
Stans told the truth when they took the witness stand in
their own defense at their 48-day federal trial.
Dean's credibility came into question when he admitted
he had pleaded guilty to a charge of obstruction of justice
in the Watergate scandal in hope of drawing a lighter
sentence, Kucharski said on NBC's "Today" show.
Vice President Gerald R. Ford said in a statement issued
by his Washington office that the jury verdict in the
Mitchell-Stans case "says to me that John Dean's credibility
has been severely eroded."
Ousted by President Nixon as White House counsel,
Dean is expected to testify for the government at other
trials spawned by the 1972 Watergate break-in and
subsequent coverup attempt. He also is regarded as a major
witness should President Nixon be impeached and tried.
Nixon Funds To Pay Legal Fees?
WASHINGTON — The trustees of President Nixon's
leftover campaign funds plan to wait until bills are
submitted before deciding whether to pay the legal
expenses of former Cabinet members John N. Mitchell and
Maurice Stans.
Mitchell and Stans were acquitted Sunday by a federal
court jury in New York of conspiracy and other charges
arising from a secret $200,000 contribution to Nixon's
1972 campaign.
Charles E. Potter, former Republican senator from
Michigan who is one of three trustees of Nixon's
$3.5-million campaign surplus, said he assumed there would
be no difficulty over payment of legal fees for Stans,
former head of the Finance Committee to Re-elect the
President.
Potter said in an interview yesterday he was not certain
about the case of Mitchell, who headed the political side of
the re-election campaign for several months in 1972.
Stans was accused and acquitted of lying to a federal
grand jury about his knowledge of a Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation into the affairs of
Robert Vesco who gave $200,000 secretly to Nixon's
re-election campaign.

Stans was head of the Nixon fund raising operation
throughout the period in 1972 and early 1973 when the
Vesco matter was pending before the SEC.
Court Limits Mail Censorship
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court placed
restrictions yesterday on prison officials who want to
censor prisoners' mail. The action limits censorship to what
is necessary to further "one or more of the substantial
governmental interests of security, order and
rehabilitation."
In other actions, the court:
— Agreed to decide next term whether Congress
intended to grant President Nixon the authority to
withhold $9 billion intended for water pollution control.
— Decided 6-3 that federal narcotics enforcement law
superseded a stringent District of Columbia search warrant
requirement. The dissenters said the decision could have
national impact.
In the prison mail case, the justices struck down the
existing state regulations in California, calling them an
invitation to prison officials and employees "to apply their
own personal prejudices and opinions" to the detriment of
free speech.
Portuguese Leaders Confer
LISBON — Portugal's Communist and Socialist leaders
met with Gen. Antonio de Spinola yesterday and reported
the ruling junta leader opposes an immediate ceasefire in
the country's African provinces.
He also is against negotiations to end the 13-year
guerrilla war in Portugal's colonies, they said. Spinola told
them Portuguese Guinea, Angola and Mozambique are not
yet ready for independence.
A spokesman for the 18 leaders representing the
Communist, Socialist and Christian Anti-Fascist parties said
they could not agree with Spinola on this, but otherwise
Spinola indicated acceptance for a large part of their
domestic programs.
