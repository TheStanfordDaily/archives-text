"Current world problems will
trigger a massive switch of research
and development money from other
fields into energy research," General
Electric Senior Vice President Thomas
Paine predicted in a Skilling
Auditorium speech yesterday
afternoon.
"I don't think energy research will
be too much for the United States to
afford," he continued. "Our first
objective should be to prove that
research and development will be
profitable in the long run."
Paine, a former chief administrator
of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), described
what he considers the five most
important new areas in the energy
field: developing new oil fields in the
Western Hemisphere, accelerating
nuclear plant development, upgrading
coal technology, extracting synthetic
oil and gas from coal and shale, and
finding new energy sources.
Shale Oil Problems
Paine stated that known domestic
energy reserves, excluding nuclear
sources, could last about 50 years. "If
shale oil is included," he added, "the
figure is 500 years. But there are
substantial social problems connected
with shale oil technology.
"If we are really to develop our
shale oil economy in the Western
states, we would have to dig the
equivalent of a Panama Canal a day.

Sure we can rebuild the mountains,
but it wouldn't be quite the same," he
added.
Nuclear Splitting Feasible
Noting that Russian scientists have
made notable progress in synthesizing
proteins from fossil fuels, Paine
declared, "Development of these
proteins would free mankind from his
50-century dependence on agriculture
for subsistence. We could fuel the
world with fossil fuels.
"We may find that coal and oil are
too precious to burn," Paine said.
The former NASA head said
hydrogen produced by nuclear
splitting of water could be a feasible
fuel in the future. "This would give us
a clean fuel independent of our fossil
sources; many people consider it the
major prospect for research and
development," stated Paine.
He also expressed optimism that
the problem of storage for nuclear
wastes could be effectively solved.
"All the reactor by-products from this
century could easily be stored in a sort
of mausoleum the size of Fort Knox,
which certainly is not a large portion
of our land area," he said.
"With effective guarding, the
hazards of radioactive wastes would be
no greater than life's other hazards,"
Paine said. He noted that proposed
long-term storage of the wastes in
abandoned mines probably could be
made to work.

"I don't think energy research will
be too much for the United States to
afford," he continued. "Our first
objective should be to prove that
research and development will be
profitable in the long run."
Paine, a former chief administrator
of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), described
what he considers the five most
important new areas in the energy
field: developing new oil fields in the
Western Hemisphere, accelerating
nuclear plant development, upgrading
coal technology, extracting synthetic
oil and gas from coal and shale, and
finding new energy sources.
Shale Oil Problems
Paine stated that known domestic
energy reserves, excluding nuclear
sources, could last about 50 years. "If
shale oil is included," he added, "the
figure is 500 years. But there are
substantial social problems connected
with shale oil technology.
"If we are really to develop our
shale oil economy in the Western
states, we would have to dig the
equivalent of a Panama Canal a day.

Sure we can rebuild the mountains,
but it wouldn't be quite the same," he
added.
Nuclear Splitting Feasible
Noting that Russian scientists have
made notable progress in synthesizing
proteins from fossil fuels, Paine
declared, "Development of these
proteins would free mankind from his
50-century dependence on agriculture
for subsistence. We could fuel the
world with fossil fuels.
"We may find that coal and oil are
too precious to burn," Paine said.
The former NASA head said
hydrogen produced by nuclear
splitting of water could be a feasible
fuel in the future. "This would give us
a clean fuel independent of our fossil
sources; many people consider it the
major prospect for research and
development," stated Paine.
He also expressed optimism that
the problem of storage for nuclear
wastes could be effectively solved.
"All the reactor by-products from this
century could easily be stored in a sort
of mausoleum the size of Fort Knox,
which certainly is not a large portion
of our land area," he said.
"With effective guarding, the
hazards of radioactive wastes would be
no greater than life's other hazards,"
Paine said. He noted that proposed
long-term storage of the wastes in
abandoned mines probably could be
made to work.
