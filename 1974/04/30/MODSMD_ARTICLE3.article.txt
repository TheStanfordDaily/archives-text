# Decision May Initiate Watergate's Final Ac
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY News Analysis 
President Nixon's decision to
release edited transcripts of the
subpoenaed Watergate tapes could be
just a holding action against the House
Judiciary Committee's impeachment
inquiry — or it could be the first scene
in the final act of Watergate.
The central point of the President's
speech last night — despite his
emphasis on what he says the
transcripts will show — was his refusal
to yield the actual tapes as the House
panel had ordered by a 33-3 vote
earlier this month. *
In offering to allow only
Committee Chairman Peter Rodino
and ranking GOP member Edward
Hutchinson direct access to the tapes
themselves, Mr. Nixon last night made
no mention of any procedures for

determining the authenticity of
tapes. Thus, even if the tapes ag

last night, he speaks for ot

Ultimate Success
The ultimate success of Mr. Nixc
gambit may rest with the
Republicans who voted to issue

a significant number of those 13, tl
Mr. Nixon will have driven a wei

remarkably united panel.
If, on the other hand, th
"swing" Republicans find
President's offer unacceptable — £
first reactions last night seen
inconclusive — Mr. Nixon may w

Further Light
Meanwhile, the actual release of t
transcripts today should provide
least some further light on the
Watergate affair. Of particular interest
may be:
— the transcript of a tape already
turned over to the Watergate grand
jury (and now in the hands of the
committee) of a March 21, 1973
meeting at which "hush money" for
the Watergate burglars was discussed.
H.R. Haldeman has been indicted for
perjury for testifying that the
President said "it would be wrong" to
raise the money; Mr. Nixon last night
again asserted that that was what he
said;
— Mr. Nixon's desire, revealed last
night, to protect some Administration
members who might have been
"technically indictable" but who were
"morally" blameless;
— the transcript version of the
March 21 Nixon-Dean meeting when
the President said he first learned the
extent of the cover-up. Nixon said the
transcript quotes Dean as saying it was
clear the President did not know of
the cover-up; Dean has previously
testified that the President was aware
of it as early as September, 1972;
— and Mr. Nixon's assertion that
the transcripts show Dean made no
mention of the fact at the March 21
meeting that "he himself had
authorized promises of clemency, that
he had personally handled money for
the Watergate defendants, that he had
suborned perjury." Dean had told the
Senate Watergate Committee that he
told Nixon "that I thought I was
involved in an obstruction of justice
situation."
