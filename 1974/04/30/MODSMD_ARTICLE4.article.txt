# Grand Jury Indicts Sen. Gurney

### 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Sen.
Edward J. Gurney, R-Fla., has been
indicted by a county grand jury on
charges of violating state election laws,
Gurney's Washington office said
yesterday. Gurney immediately
declared his innocence.
The grand jury reportedly ordered
the indictment drawn up last Friday,
before it recessed until tomorrow.
The grand jury began its
investigation of Gurney at the urging
of Marshall Harris, a Democratic state
legislator from Miami. He charged that
the senator had acknowledged last
December that he violated state
election laws by receiving campaign
donations and failing to report them.
John Gardney, Gurney's
Washington press aide, said Gurney
had been indicted on a state law which
makes it illegal to accept campaign
funds without designating a campaign
treasurer or setting up a campaign
bank account. Gurney charged the
indictment was politically motivated.
'Unwarranted Attack'
"This is an unfortunate result of a
vicious and unwarranted attack,"

Gurney said in a statement. "I am
confident that the process of justice
and courts will operate swiftly to
vindicate me of this unlawful charge
and any wrongdoing. I am absolutely
innocent."
Gurney, 60, is a member of the

Senate Watergate committee who has
announced he will seek re-election this
year. He was first elected to the Senate
in 1968 after three terms in the U.S.
House of Representatives.
The grand jury's probe of Gurney
related to his announcement at a news
conference last December that
$100,000 had been raised in his name
without his knowledge.
Money Unreported
He said he learned about the fund
raising in mid-1972 and had ordered it
stopped. He said he did not report the
money to the state because at the time
he was not a candidate and did not
have a fund-raising committee.
"The only solution seemed to be to
wait until I became a candidate and
report the funds then," Gurney said in
December.
On Friday, Circuit Judge John
Rudd told the Leon County grand jury
that it could indict an elected federal
official under a state law which
prohibits the acceptance of campaign
contributions without naming a
campaign treasurer or setting up a
campaign bank account.
