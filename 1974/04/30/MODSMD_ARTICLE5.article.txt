## Grads Opt For Offbeat Vocations 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
"There are two things that come only once in
life," claims Woody Allen in the movie Sleeper.
"Death and sex." If that's true, then Steve
Dougherty and Rick Miller have once-in-a-lifetime
jobs.
Both graduated from Stanford last June, but
unlike their upwardly mobile classmates, neither
went to med school or law school or biz school or
grad school of any kind.
Before his classmates had briefed their first cases,
Dougherty had written and sold his first
pornographic novel. And while the junior Marcus
Welbys were dissecting corpses, Miller was cremating
them.
In choosing offbeat occupations, Dougherty and
Miller are not unique. Stanford also graduates
Hollywood actors (Jack Palance, '49), best-selling
writers (Allen Drury, '39), and professional athletes
(Jim Plunkett '71). Thousands of housewifely hearts
throb for David O'Brien ('56), who plays Steve
Aldrich on The Doctors, a daytime soap opera.
Stewart Brand went on to publish the extremely
popular Whole Earth Catalogue. Roger and Marsha
(Cook) Woodbury settled on a 500-acre sheep farm
in New Zealand. Michael Moore ('64) paints
landscapes; as a sideline, he produces prints of
abandoned cars in the desert.

It is usually job hunters with degrees in
humanities and "fuzzy studies" who are forced to
improvise in the real world.
"I found out how far you can get with a psych
major," Miller says. An old friend, the son of a
mortician, proposed the cremation business and
Miller, an alum of the Band, was interested.
Together they founded the California Cremation
Society, headquartered in San Jose.
"We do the minimum the law requires to dispose
of a body," Miller says. "We don't sell any urns or
accessories. No frills."
Meets Requirements
The Society picks up the body in a station
wagon, takes care of legal requirements, contracts
out the actual cremation, and, if relatives request,
scatters the ashes. So far, over one hundred people
have paid $15 for Society membership, which
allows them cheaper rates for cremation.
A recent survey showed that the average cost of a
funeral is $1033, not counting cemetery expenses.
A gravesite and marker may cost another $500.
Miller charges $250-$3OO for cremation.
Yet most of the Cremation Society's members
could easily afford a full funeral, Miller says. "We
mostly get educated people, a lot of doctors, upper
middle class. Poor people tend to go in for big
religious funerals."

In four months of operation, the society has
cremated eleven bodies. The business is losing
money and Miller works as a security guard to
support himself. But he thinks it has a future and
hopes to franchise the idea someday.
Miller finds the work not as grisly as he originally
expected. "You develop a callous attitude. The first
time I handled a dead body I had to force myself.
Now I just see it as a dead hunk of meat."
Miller's ambition got him into the cremating
business, but it was sheer laziness that spurred
Dougherty to become a pornographer. "I have this
thing against working," the former anthropology
major explains. "I figured anybody could write
trash."
Becoming a smut slinger was relatively simple.
Dougherty wrote porno publishers listed in books at
newsstands. Despite the Supreme Court and the
paper shortage, he heard from a few firms which
were accepting material.
Studies Books
Since he had not read any pornography since his
teen days, Dougherty bought five dirty books and
studied them carefully to pinpoint the accepted
formulas. Then he sat down and wrote his novel.
"My first draft is my final draft," the young
author says."The limiting factor is how fast I type.
I can get about four pages done in an hour and I try
