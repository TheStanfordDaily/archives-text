# Porno Author, Cremation Service
## Grads Opt For Offbeat Vocations 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
"There are two things that come only once in
life," claims Woody Allen in the movie Sleeper.
"Death and sex." If that's true, then Steve
Dougherty and Rick Miller have once-in-a-lifetime
jobs.
Both graduated from Stanford last June, but
unlike their upwardly mobile classmates, neither
went to med school or law school or biz school or
grad school of any kind.
Before his classmates had briefed their first cases,
Dougherty had written and sold his first
pornographic novel. And while the junior Marcus
Welbys were dissecting corpses, Miller was cremating
them.
In choosing offbeat occupations, Dougherty and
Miller are not unique. Stanford also graduates
Hollywood actors (Jack Palance, '49), best-selling
writers (Allen Drury, '39), and professional athletes
(Jim Plunkett '71). Thousands of housewifely hearts
throb for David O'Brien ('56), who plays Steve
Aldrich on The Doctors, a daytime soap opera.
Stewart Brand went on to publish the extremely
popular Whole Earth Catalogue. Roger and Marsha
(Cook) Woodbury settled on a 500-acre sheep farm
in New Zealand. Michael Moore ('64) paints
landscapes; as a sideline, he produces prints of
abandoned cars in the desert.

It is usually job hunters with degrees in
humanities and "fuzzy studies" who are forced to
improvise in the real world.
"I found out how far you can get with a psych
major," Miller says. An old friend, the son of a
mortician, proposed the cremation business and
Miller, an alum of the Band, was interested.
Together they founded the California Cremation
Society, headquartered in San Jose.
"We do the minimum the law requires to dispose
of a body," Miller says. "We don't sell any urns or
accessories. No frills."
Meets Requirements
The Society picks up the body in a station
wagon, takes care of legal requirements, contracts
out the actual cremation, and, if relatives request,
scatters the ashes. So far, over one hundred people
have paid $15 for Society membership, which
allows them cheaper rates for cremation.
A recent survey showed that the average cost of a
funeral is $1033, not counting cemetery expenses.
A gravesite and marker may cost another $500.
Miller charges $250-$3OO for cremation.
Yet most of the Cremation Society's members
could easily afford a full funeral, Miller says. "We
mostly get educated people, a lot of doctors, upper
middle class. Poor people tend to go in for big
religious funerals."

In four months of operation, the society has
cremated eleven bodies. The business is losing
money and Miller works as a security guard to
support himself. But he thinks it has a future and
hopes to franchise the idea someday.
Miller finds the work not as grisly as he originally
expected. "You develop a callous attitude. The first
time I handled a dead body I had to force myself.
Now I just see it as a dead hunk of meat."
Miller's ambition got him into the cremating
business, but it was sheer laziness that spurred
Dougherty to become a pornographer. "I have this
thing against working," the former anthropology
major explains. "I figured anybody could write
trash."
Becoming a smut slinger was relatively simple.
Dougherty wrote porno publishers listed in books at
newsstands. Despite the Supreme Court and the
paper shortage, he heard from a few firms which
were accepting material.
Studies Books
Since he had not read any pornography since his
teen days, Dougherty bought five dirty books and
studied them carefully to pinpoint the accepted
formulas. Then he sat down and wrote his novel.
"My first draft is my final draft," the young
author says."The limiting factor is how fast I type.
I can get about four pages done in an hour and I try
to knock out a chapter at a time."
He wrote for several hours each night, drawing on his
nine-to-five construction job at a Marine base. Marine Tail
centers around Sgt. Neil Dunaway's active life as a training
instructor for a platoon of female recruits.
Dougherty sold Marine Tail to the first publisher he
tried, but earned only $175, a dollar per page. An
established writer can earn over $1000 for a book,
depending on the state of the porno market. Dougherty's
second novel, California Creaming, was accepted in January
by another publisher for a five percent royalty. Dougherty
hopes to earn $900-1100.
For subject matter, Dougherty uses personal experience
and his imagination. "I figure I have a good background for
smut, being a sexual animal," he says. He cast himself three
times in his first book, once in his second.
"A porno writer cannot dream of fame, he can only
aspire to productivity. Stamina is more important than

skill."
Thus far, smut has not made him rich, or even
comfortable. He lives in the garage of a Palo Alto house,
sharing the rent with four friends. Most of his room is taken
up by a giant waterbed and a large desk where he does his
work. His bookshelf holds novels by Burroughs, Barth,
Hawkes, Pynchon and Joyce, as well as a large jar of peanut
butter and two cans of beans.
Dougherty dreams of making a living by writing what he
calls "the real stuff." Currently he is trying to sell a play
and a short story.
But if the demand for smut remains high, he may set
aside his serious writing and turn to work utterly without
redeeming social importance.
"I could do something with science fiction porno. You
know, beings from outer space. You could put three males
and twenty females on a different planet, different
gravity." His eyes light up. "Virgin territory. The animal in
us all."
