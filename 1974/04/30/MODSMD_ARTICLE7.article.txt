the individual has the right to

igth of this belief is evident in
recent bill before Congress to
the gathering of information
ing to private habits and
yles of American people by
[overnment.
Equally Free
he black community also has
ong attachment to this belief
Teels that black society as well
hite society should be equally
against governmental
ference with people's lives.

there are some who believe
black people cannot share in

olice, through their gathering
field interrogation cards" have
;sed sums of information
se potential for abuse is
nited. Field interrogation
s go into police files and
ain names, addresses, social
rity numbers, driver's licenses,
ipation, employer, physical

description, and other
information about the person
stopped.
Clearly, this information has
nothing to do with effective
capture of the Zebra. The only
conceivable purpose for this
immense amount of information
is to monitor the black
community — to gather
information on their private
habits and lifestyles.
Potential Abuses
Black people are concerned
about the potential and actual
abuses of a Zebra-type order.
Information gathered on such
cards can be used in the future for
whatever purposes the police
deem necessary (including times
of riots or other times when
police feel that entire black
communities should be roped off
and invaded).
Actual abuse of such an order
has already surfaced. On April 23
in Sacramento (according to the
April 24 Chronicle), Zebra-type
procedures to arrest suspects in
the murder of a man and an
attempted murder of an off-duty
police sergeant were implemented.
Several blocks of Sacramento's
black ghetto were "cordoned off"
while police searched the area (no
weapons were found). If the
situation were reversed (white
shooting black) would the police
have hastily implemented such a
search in such a manner with so
little evidence that involved many
innocent people?
Frequent 'Stopping'
Another actual abuse is the
gross inconvenience and indignity
of being stopped as many as three
times in one day. Effective police
practice could alleviate such
duplication even without
monitoring cards. Black people
are further concerned about the
uniqueness of the Zebra order,
Mayor Alioto's comparison
between the Zebra and Zodiac,
and think that the two are
distinguishable.
Even the mayor has called the
Zebra order and hunt
"unprecedented" and "a police
action without parallel in San
Francisco history." One can easily
infer that the Zebra order is the
first of its kind. Moreover, the
Zodiac did not involve a mass
public campaign for apprehension
of a killer and no "field
investigation cards" were issued.
Mayor Alioto's motive for
issuing such an order should be
questioned since the Chief of
Inspection has admitted that the
dragnet method has been
"unproductive and ineffective." It
is indeed a cynical political move
to get reactionary (Orange
County?) votes at the expense of
black citizens to aid one in his
gubernatorial bid.
Two Results
The mayor must have realized
that the order could only have
done two things, give the
community some security and
deter further Zebra killings (but
apprehension of Zebra is
unlikely.)
The appropriate response of
the black community is through
political action: campaign against
Mayor Alioto. Politicians cannot
take such cynical-political and
calculated actions against blacks
and not suffer the consequences.
Admittedly, waging a negative
campaign is not desirable but
there appears to be no alternative.
Essentially, our campaign would
be no different than what Alioto
has done: wage a campaign against
black people.

Clearly, this information has
nothing to do with effective
capture of the Zebra. The only
conceivable purpose for this
immense amount of information
is to monitor the black
community — to gather
information on their private
habits and lifestyles.
Potential Abuses
Black people are concerned
about the potential and actual
abuses of a Zebra-type order.
Information gathered on such
cards can be used in the future for
whatever purposes the police
deem necessary (including times
of riots or other times when
police feel that entire black
communities should be roped off
and invaded).
Actual abuse of such an order
has already surfaced. On April 23
in Sacramento (according to the
April 24 Chronicle), Zebra-type
procedures to arrest suspects in
the murder of a man and an
attempted murder of an off-duty
police sergeant were implemented.
Several blocks of Sacramento's
black ghetto were "cordoned off"
while police searched the area (no
weapons were found). If the
situation were reversed (white
shooting black) would the police
have hastily implemented such a
search in such a manner with so
little evidence that involved many
innocent people?
Frequent 'Stopping'
Another actual abuse is the
gross inconvenience and indignity
of being stopped as many as three
times in one day. Effective police
practice could alleviate such
duplication even without
monitoring cards. Black people
are further concerned about the
uniqueness of the Zebra order,
Mayor Alioto's comparison
between the Zebra and Zodiac,
and think that the two are
distinguishable.
Even the mayor has called the
Zebra order and hunt
"unprecedented" and "a police
action without parallel in San
Francisco history." One can easily
infer that the Zebra order is the
first of its kind. Moreover, the
Zodiac did not involve a mass
public campaign for apprehension
of a killer and no "field
investigation cards" were issued.
Mayor Alioto's motive for
issuing such an order should be
questioned since the Chief of
Inspection has admitted that the
dragnet method has been
"unproductive and ineffective." It
is indeed a cynical political move
to get reactionary (Orange
County?) votes at the expense of
black citizens to aid one in his
gubernatorial bid.
Two Results
The mayor must have realized
that the order could only have
done two things, give the
community some security and
deter further Zebra killings (but
apprehension of Zebra is
unlikely.)
The appropriate response of
the black community is through
political action: campaign against
Mayor Alioto. Politicians cannot
take such cynical-political and
calculated actions against blacks
and not suffer the consequences.
Admittedly, waging a negative
campaign is not desirable but
there appears to be no alternative.
Essentially, our campaign would
be no different than what Alioto
has done: wage a campaign against
black people.

nited. Field interrogation
s go into police files and
ain names, addresses, social
rity numbers, driver's licenses,
ipation, employer, physical

description, and other
information about the person
stopped.
Clearly, this information has
nothing to do with effective
capture of the Zebra. The only
conceivable purpose for this
immense amount of information
is to monitor the black
community — to gather
information on their private
habits and lifestyles.
Potential Abuses
Black people are concerned
about the potential and actual
abuses of a Zebra-type order.
Information gathered on such
cards can be used in the future for
whatever purposes the police
deem necessary (including times
of riots or other times when
police feel that entire black
communities should be roped off
and invaded).
Actual abuse of such an order
has already surfaced. On April 23
in Sacramento (according to the
April 24 Chronicle), Zebra-type
procedures to arrest suspects in
the murder of a man and an
attempted murder of an off-duty
police sergeant were implemented.
Several blocks of Sacramento's
black ghetto were "cordoned off"
while police searched the area (no
weapons were found). If the
situation were reversed (white
shooting black) would the police
have hastily implemented such a
search in such a manner with so
little evidence that involved many
innocent people?
Frequent 'Stopping'
Another actual abuse is the
gross inconvenience and indignity
of being stopped as many as three
times in one day. Effective police
practice could alleviate such
duplication even without
monitoring cards. Black people
are further concerned about the
uniqueness of the Zebra order,
Mayor Alioto's comparison
between the Zebra and Zodiac,
and think that the two are
distinguishable.
Even the mayor has called the
Zebra order and hunt
"unprecedented" and "a police
action without parallel in San
Francisco history." One can easily
infer that the Zebra order is the
first of its kind. Moreover, the
Zodiac did not involve a mass
public campaign for apprehension
of a killer and no "field
investigation cards" were issued.
Mayor Alioto's motive for
issuing such an order should be
questioned since the Chief of
Inspection has admitted that the
dragnet method has been
"unproductive and ineffective." It
is indeed a cynical political move
to get reactionary (Orange
County?) votes at the expense of
black citizens to aid one in his
gubernatorial bid.
Two Results
The mayor must have realized
that the order could only have
done two things, give the
community some security and
deter further Zebra killings (but
apprehension of Zebra is
unlikely.)
The appropriate response of
the black community is through
political action: campaign against
Mayor Alioto. Politicians cannot
take such cynical-political and
calculated actions against blacks
and not suffer the consequences.
Admittedly, waging a negative
campaign is not desirable but
there appears to be no alternative.
Essentially, our campaign would
be no different than what Alioto
has done: wage a campaign against
black people.
