# German Campus Moves Location In Beutelsbach
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Stanford-in-Germany will remain in Beutelsbach, but
will relocate within the town, the Overseas Studies Office
announced yesterday.
Don Price, associate director for budget and planning of
the overseas campus programs, told a press conference in
he Old Union that new facilities have been found in
Beutelsbach to contain a somewhat revised program
beginning in January, 1975.
The present site of the German campus, Landgut Burg
just outside Beutelsbach, will be vacated for financial
reasons when the lease runs out in December of this year.
Price expressed his satisfaction with the relocation in
ieutelsbach, which will allow the program to continue its
successful family program, which "created close personal
ties between Beutelsbachers and Stanford students over a
period of 15 years.
"The town of Beutelsbach has been very cooperative in
making these facilities available to us, and we can truly say
that our program will be conducted in partnership with the
community," Price added.
Spindler Attends
About 30 students are expected to enroll in the program

beginning in January. Anthropology Prof. George Spindler,
who with the help of students published a monograph on
the rural culture around Beutelsbach, will be the first
faculty member at the new site.
Plans call for one Stanford faculty member and two
local academic staffers, with local scholars contracted for
individual courses. Alfred Schmid will continue as the
Beutelsbach program director.
The new program will be considerably more flexible
than past ones. Rather than a set two-quarter session,
students will have the option of spending from one to three
quarters at Beutelsbach.
Transfer
Plans are in progress for similar study centers in Berlin
and Vienna; students may choose to transfer to one of
these after a quarter or two at Beutelsbach. Those with
sufficient proficiency in German might move to the
German Studies Department's program at the University of
Bonn (see related story on page five).
Facilities for the Berlin program have not been found
yet, but the University has a full-time employee currently
seeking suitable space there.

NEW HOME ABROAD—Stanford-in-Germany will move to these new quarters in 1975. The facilities will remain in
Beutelsbach but the program will be slightly revised.
The new Beutelsbach site consists
of three buildings in the town which
will provide academic and living space
for faculty and students. Classroom,
library and office space will be rented
in an old grammar school and a large
house nearby, called the Stifthaus.
Next door to the Stifthaus is
another large building, the
Zehntscheuer, which is currently being
remodeled by the town with help from
the University. It will provide living
space for the students and a center for
the town's youth club.
Students not housed in the
Zehntscheuer will live in apartments or
in private homes. Board arrangements
will be flexible, primarily through
reimbursements for meals in local
restaurants.
Applications are now being taken for
the Beutelsbach program in Winter
quarter, 1974-75, and subsequent
quarter.

Plans are in progress for similar study centers in Berlin
and Vienna; students may choose to transfer to one of
these after a quarter or two at Beutelsbach. Those with
sufficient proficiency in German might move to the
German Studies Department's program at the University of
Bonn (see related story on page five).
Facilities for the Berlin program have not been found
yet, but the University has a full-time employee currently
seeking suitable space there.

NEW HOME ABROAD—Stanford-in-Germany will move to these new quarters in 1975. The facilities will remain in
Beutelsbach but the program will be slightly revised.
The new Beutelsbach site consists
of three buildings in the town which
will provide academic and living space
for faculty and students. Classroom,
library and office space will be rented
in an old grammar school and a large
house nearby, called the Stifthaus.
Next door to the Stifthaus is
another large building, the
Zehntscheuer, which is currently being
remodeled by the town with help from
the University. It will provide living
space for the students and a center for
the town's youth club.
Students not housed in the
Zehntscheuer will live in apartments or
in private homes. Board arrangements
will be flexible, primarily through
reimbursements for meals in local
restaurants.
Applications are now being taken for
the Beutelsbach program in Winter
quarter, 1974-75, and subsequent
quarter.
Stanford-in-Germany will remain in Beutelsbach, but
will relocate within the town, the Overseas Studies Office
announced yesterday.
Don Price, associate director for budget and planning of
the overseas campus programs, told a press conference in
he Old Union that new facilities have been found in
Beutelsbach to contain a somewhat revised program
beginning in January, 1975.
The present site of the German campus, Landgut Burg
just outside Beutelsbach, will be vacated for financial
reasons when the lease runs out in December of this year.
Price expressed his satisfaction with the relocation in
ieutelsbach, which will allow the program to continue its
successful family program, which "created close personal
ties between Beutelsbachers and Stanford students over a
period of 15 years.
"The town of Beutelsbach has been very cooperative in
making these facilities available to us, and we can truly say
that our program will be conducted in partnership with the
community," Price added.
Spindler Attends
About 30 students are expected to enroll in the program

beginning in January. Anthropology Prof. George Spindler,
who with the help of students published a monograph on
the rural culture around Beutelsbach, will be the first
faculty member at the new site.
Plans call for one Stanford faculty member and two
local academic staffers, with local scholars contracted for
individual courses. Alfred Schmid will continue as the
Beutelsbach program director.
The new program will be considerably more flexible
than past ones. Rather than a set two-quarter session,
students will have the option of spending from one to three
quarters at Beutelsbach.
