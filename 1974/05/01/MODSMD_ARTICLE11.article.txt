# Why Stanford Deserves A Strike

On Monday, April 29, United Stanford
Employees' members received strike ballots. I
feel that Stanford deserves a strike, unless
management changes its bargaining position.
But can anything be done to avert a
strike? Let me make two suggestions on how
members of the Stanford community can
help.
First, we need better coverage by the news
media. Reporters must investigate more
thoroughly and ascertain the actual positions
of USE and Stanford management more
accurately, if the public is to understand
current events and the reasons for them.
For instance, the reasons for USE's
walkout on April 18 must be unclear to
non-union readers of the Daily, and I hope
this letter will clarify the reasons for the
walkout and the strike ballot.
Debate Helpful
Secondly, a debate between USE and
management representatives would be even
more helpful. I feel it might avert a strike,
because management's current offer and their
current negotiating tactics could not stand
the light of day. Such a debate would at least
inform the community and allow for
intelligent choice in the event of a strike.
If there is a strike, everyone will be
confronted with the question of whether to
cross the picket line. If workers are willing to
sacrifice their pay to get a better contract,
the community has a responsibility to learn
the facts and should support the most
reasonable party. To claim ignorance or
uninvolvement is to support management's
position automatically.
A debate was offered to both parties by
the ASSU. USE is quite willing to present its

position in an open debate. Douglas Barton,
university negotiator, has turned down this
invitation from the ASSU in the past, as well
as an invitation from a group of medical
school students.
Debate Demand Needed
USE hopes that the ASSU and others, law
school students, business school students and
faculty for instance, will demand such a
debate. Indeed, we feel the administration
itself might react differently if its negotiators
had to debate USE representatives rather
than just present their side of the story in
closed administration meetings. Some lower
echelon administrators and other exempt
employees have expressed sympathy for
USE's, position.
Now to the question of why a strike vote
is necessary at all. USE does not have the
money to take out full-page ads as
management can. But our position is simple,
unlike the obfuscation and refusal to get to
the point by management negotiators.
The contract is a complicated affair as
management's ad stresses, but with one or
two exceptions, USE's position has been
known to management since November, time
enough to count the cost.
No New Demands
We came back from the April 11 meeting
with priorities, not a new set of demands. We
dropped some of our demands and indicated
others as of the highest priority, what
negotiations should focus on. Management
negotiators have refused to recognize these
priorities after they spent so many hours
telling us they needed these priorities!
Barton has said the University can make a
better offer on the major items, but will not

reveal it until the minor items have been
negotiated. After complaining in the Daily of
the cost of USE's proposal, Barton refuses to
discuss the major cost items! This is like
insisting on covering no-cost, penny and
dollar items before discussing the ten dollar
ones.
Barton's position is backwards from the
university's interests as well as backwards
from USE's priorities.
Two Exceptions Explained
I mentioned two exceptions above. These
are major cost items for which USE changed
its demand, drastically reducing the cost. One
is pay increases to the 75th percentile of
community standards. We are now asking a
step in this direction for the first contract of
only one fourth of the previous demand. A
detailed computer listing has been supplied
management negotiators concerning the
demand.
The other is the pension plan, where we
seek equality with the other university
employees.
We realize it may take a few days to count
the cost of these items, but if we can do it on
our free time, management can surely do it
even faster. The cost of the other items
should have been known since November.
There is no excuse for not discussing
minimum pay, cost of living, and the medical
plan immediately and moving to community
standards and pension at the next session.
There are also many lower cost items on
which USE's priorities have been indicated.
Let's talk about the major items first and
then the minor ones, not vice versa!
