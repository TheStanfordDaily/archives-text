BAP Correction
Editor:
The column "Bargaining and
University Finances" Daily, April
29 contains an error. In the third
paragraph, the second sentence
should read, "In developing our
budget for next year, we had to
BAP twice as much as
planned—over $1,400,000—in
order to provide an average
faculty salary increase of six
percent and a still higher increase
for staff." The good English verb
"budget" was printed instead of
the Stanford verb "BAP." We
wish the facts were otherwise, but
it was BAPping that was required
before next year's highest priority
needs could be met.

Clapping Hands
Editor:
In trying to hear the sound of
one hand clapping, one should not
listen for the sound of two hands
clapping. I believe Tim Ferguson's
report on guru Sri Chinmoy Daily,
April 22, reflects the latter,
however.
After describing throughout
the article the Sri's beliefs that
one must reject the Self — "the
puny T consciousness" — in order
to fulfill the God-Reality,
Ferguson comments that
"Chinmoy made one obvious
reference to his well-publicized
colleague . . . 16-year-old Guru
Maharaj-Ji: 'A guru cannot claim
to bo God .. . The elder knows
more than the younger . ~ listen

to your higher part.' "
But this is quoted out of
context. The Sri was speaking on
the role of gurus in general, a role
he minimizes. Not everyone needs
a teacher, he said, but in choosing
one, "If you see a group of four
or five people sitting before you,
he who gives you the most joy is
your teacher."
His quoted reference to
"elder" and "younger" was part
of his analogy of a guru as an
older brother in a family, not a
divine being (a Son of Man, not a
Son of God, as another guru put
it).
And as an older brother, he can
guide his younger brothers to
their father, since he "knows the
whereabouts of the Father
better."
To read in this analogy the
petty comparisons of a
competitive Self reflects more our
Western habits than any abyss in
Sri Chinmoy's consciousness,
which seems far beyond listening
for the ego's soundless applause.

National Socialism
Editor:
At a time when America
virtually teeters at the precipice of
political catastrophe, economic
insanity, and the societal essence
of organizational chaos, now,
more than ever before, our great
Nation needs national socialism as
advocated by the National
Socialist White People's Party
(NSWPP).
The NSWPP is made up of

Americans who believe in America
and the white race, like most
Americans do. And, we are willing
to stand up and fight for our
nation and race to protect and
advance them. We believe in the
greatness of our country and its
traditions.
Also, we believe that the white
race has every right to demand
and expect that its government be
for the people—the people for
whom and by whom the founders
of our country genuinely
intended—white people!
In the hearts of the American
people, there is a righteous anger
rising, and so it should. White
people are getting sick and tired
of having the good jobs go to the
incompetent and illiterate
primitives of society, while the
productive and hard-working
American is being passed over
time and time again. White people
just don't have a say in
government. If they did, America
wouldn't be in the mess it's in
today.
Americans who genuinely love
this Nation have a moral Socialist
White People's Party and its
program of "realistic
practicality." Americans, then,
who have the courage of their
convictions should demonstrate
their loyalty and love of country
by sending a letter of support to:
Commander Matt Koehl, National
Headquarters, P. O. Box 5505,
Arlington, VA 22201, today!
Remember, a strong and free
America can never be won by
sedentary apathy, but can only be
achieved by the struggle of active

involvement.
National Socialism in America
is not only a practical necessity, it
is also a theoretical necessity—an
exigency of logic and common
sense! It is the means by which
America may effectively stem the
menacing tide of those adversaries
of Aryan humanity that seeks, by
a world conspiracy, to destroy
and subdue our people and
nation.
