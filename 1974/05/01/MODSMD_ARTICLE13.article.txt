# Problem Solving

Ralph Samuelson

The increasing number of
problems which Stanford students
are being required to solve has
brought increasing attention to
the search for a universal solution.
While such a breakthrough has yet
to be made, great progress has
been made in recent years. In this
context, I shall summarize here
some of the key findings. First, I
shall discuss useful constants, and
then partial universal solutions.
1. The Most Random Number:
"17." This finding, credited to
Fast (1973), is highly useful in a
wide variety of statistical and
probabilistic problems. The proof
is too intricate to recite here.
Interested readers should consult
Fast's definitive work
Deterministic, Probabilistic, and
Nude Models.
2. The Schwettman Fudge
Factor. Let c=the correct answer
and let d=your answer. Then
multiplying your answer by the
constant c/d will always yield the
proper answer. This finding,
credited to Schwettman, is
actually of unknown origin. The
proof is trivial and is left to the
reader as an exercise.
3. Pring's Constant. "The
answer is 14." This discovery by
Pring (1972) follows from the
earlier Oiler formula: let n=
number of hours spent working
on problem, t=next year's tuition,
and g= l/(your grade point
average). Then the correct answer
equals nt/g. Pring's constant
follows by taking the limit as n,g,
and t approach infinity.
Special Case
A special case of Pring's
constant is Bonnie's Whole (Hole,
1971) which states "The answer is
9.1 in some appropriate system of
units."
We now turn to partial
universal solutions:
4. Weitzilian Invariant
Permativity Process (Weitzel,
1973). "Take the negative
reciprocal of the slope and
integrate from zero to infinity."
This solution process is especially
suitable for use in the various
branches of tree theory.
Textbook Problems
5. Samuelson's First Law of
Textbooks. "All textbook
problems work out nicely." Some
have suggested that the theorem
should be modified to state
"where the course number is less
than a," where a is some unknown
constant. This theorem has
important applications in
sociology and other sub-optimal
disciplines. The proof is beyond
the scope of this paper, but will
be contained in the author's
soon-to-be-published work, Brick,
Cement, and Other Foundations
of Education.
6. Whan's Universal Proof.
Probably the greatest
breakthrough in universal
solutions to date. Whan (1974)
states "Restate the given, from
which the proof follows
immediately."
Proof: Given the entire body
of mathematics, the proof follows
by inspection.
So here we have a short
summary of progress to date. The
programs directed toward a
universal solution are in an
exploratory period and can be
described as being almost feverish.
Discoveries, new understanding
and technological advances are
coming too rapidly for anyone to
be sure what course this
development will take. A great
deal of work will be required to
answer these questions, however,
and the promise of a solution
makes the effort worth while.

and g= l/(your grade point
average). Then the correct answer
equals nt/g. Pring's constant
follows by taking the limit as n,g,
and t approach infinity.
Special Case
A special case of Pring's
constant is Bonnie's Whole (Hole,
1971) which states "The answer is
9.1 in some appropriate system of
units."
We now turn to partial
universal solutions:
4. Weitzilian Invariant
Permativity Process (Weitzel,
1973). "Take the negative
reciprocal of the slope and
integrate from zero to infinity."
This solution process is especially
suitable for use in the various
branches of tree theory.
Textbook Problems
5. Samuelson's First Law of
Textbooks. "All textbook
problems work out nicely." Some
have suggested that the theorem
should be modified to state
"where the course number is less
than a," where a is some unknown
constant. This theorem has
important applications in
sociology and other sub-optimal
disciplines. The proof is beyond
the scope of this paper, but will
be contained in the author's
soon-to-be-published work, Brick,
Cement, and Other Foundations
of Education.
6. Whan's Universal Proof.
Probably the greatest
breakthrough in universal
solutions to date. Whan (1974)
states "Restate the given, from
which the proof follows
immediately."
Proof: Given the entire body
of mathematics, the proof follows
by inspection.
So here we have a short
summary of progress to date. The
programs directed toward a
universal solution are in an
exploratory period and can be
described as being almost feverish.
Discoveries, new understanding
and technological advances are
coming too rapidly for anyone to
be sure what course this
development will take. A great
deal of work will be required to
answer these questions, however,
and the promise of a solution
makes the effort worth while.

The increasing number of
problems which Stanford students
are being required to solve has
brought increasing attention to
the search for a universal solution.
While such a breakthrough has yet
to be made, great progress has
been made in recent years. In this
context, I shall summarize here
some of the key findings. First, I
shall discuss useful constants, and
then partial universal solutions.
1. The Most Random Number:
"17." This finding, credited to
Fast (1973), is highly useful in a
wide variety of statistical and
probabilistic problems. The proof
is too intricate to recite here.
Interested readers should consult
Fast's definitive work
Deterministic, Probabilistic, and
Nude Models.
2. The Schwettman Fudge
Factor. Let c=the correct answer
and let d=your answer. Then
multiplying your answer by the
constant c/d will always yield the
proper answer. This finding,
credited to Schwettman, is
actually of unknown origin. The
proof is trivial and is left to the
reader as an exercise.
3. Pring's Constant. "The
answer is 14." This discovery by
Pring (1972) follows from the
earlier Oiler formula: let n=
number of hours spent working
on problem, t=next year's tuition,
and g= l/(your grade point
average). Then the correct answer
equals nt/g. Pring's constant
follows by taking the limit as n,g,
and t approach infinity.
