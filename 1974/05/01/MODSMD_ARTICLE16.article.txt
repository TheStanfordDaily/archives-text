# Tape Interpretations Differ
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY News Analysis 
As President Nixon said Monday night, his
own and others' interpretations of the edited
transcripts of subpoenaed Watergate tapes
indeed differ in many crucial areas.
In a 50-page brief accompanying the
transcripts, presidential attorney James D. St.
Clair cited several excerpts from the
transcripts as "proof" of Mr. Nixon's
innocence. But the true meaning of much of
the material cited is still open to question.
For example, the transcripts appear to
contradict in some points previous testimony
and presidential statements about the March
21, 1973 meeting at which the President said
he first learned of the cover-up.
Former White House chief of staff H.R.
Haldeman told the Senate Watergate
Committee last the President
later endorsed Haldeman's recollection—that
the President said "it would be wrong" to
raise hush money for the Watergate
defendants:
"He [the President] asked how much
money would be involved over the years and

Dean said 'over a million dollars—but the
problem is that it is hard to raise.' The
President said, 'There is no problem in raising
a million dollars, we can do that, but it
would be wrong.'"
In fact, according to the transcripts, Mr.
Nixon seems to have approved the payment
of hush money:
NIXON (to John W. Dean III): "We could get
that, you could get a million dollars; you
could get it in cash. I know where it could be
gotten."
And later:
NIXON: "You have no choice but to come
up with the $120,000, right?
DEAN: "That's right."
NIXON: "Would you agree that that's the
prime thing you damn well better get done?"
DEAN: "Obviously he [E. Howard Hunt]
ought to be given some signal, anyway."
NIXON: "(expletive), get it!"
According to the transcript, Nixon said it
would be "wrong" to offer executive
clemency to the Watergate burglars; but the
context seems to indicate he was speaking in

terms of political feasibility.
Other information cited by St. Clair as
proof of the President's innocence is also
questionable. For example, the brief cites an
April 15 conversation with Asst. Atty. Gen.
Henry Petersen in which Mr. Nixon told him:
"I want him [G. Gordon Liddy] to be sure
to understand that as far as the President is
concerned, everybody in this case is to talk
and tell the truth. You are to tell everybody,
and you don't even have to call me on that
with anybody. You just say those are your
orders."
But even if Mr. Nixon had been involved
with the cover-up it is highly unlikely that he
would have told Petersen, then ultimately
responsible for the Justice Department probe,
anything different. And Petersen himself has
said that the course of action he asked Mr.
Nixon to take to facilitate the
investigation—firing Haldeman and John D.
Ehrlichman immediately, and retaining, at
least temporarily, Dean—was not followed.
Instead, Haldeman and Ehrlichman
remained for another two weeks, until they
resigned and Dean was fired at the same time.

21, 1973 meeting at which the President said
he first learned of the cover-up.
Former White House chief of staff H.R.
Haldeman told the Senate Watergate
Committee last the President
later endorsed Haldeman's recollection—that
the President said "it would be wrong" to
raise hush money for the Watergate
defendants:
"He [the President] asked how much
money would be involved over the years and

Dean said 'over a million dollars—but the
problem is that it is hard to raise.' The
President said, 'There is no problem in raising
a million dollars, we can do that, but it
would be wrong.'"
In fact, according to the transcripts, Mr.
Nixon seems to have approved the payment
of hush money:
NIXON (to John W. Dean III): "We could get
that, you could get a million dollars; you
could get it in cash. I know where it could be
gotten."
And later:
NIXON: "You have no choice but to come
up with the $120,000, right?
DEAN: "That's right."
NIXON: "Would you agree that that's the
prime thing you damn well better get done?"
DEAN: "Obviously he [E. Howard Hunt]
ought to be given some signal, anyway."
NIXON: "(expletive), get it!"
According to the transcript, Nixon said it
would be "wrong" to offer executive
clemency to the Watergate burglars; but the
context seems to indicate he was speaking in

terms of political feasibility.
Other information cited by St. Clair as
proof of the President's innocence is also
questionable. For example, the brief cites an
April 15 conversation with Asst. Atty. Gen.
Henry Petersen in which Mr. Nixon told him:
"I want him [G. Gordon Liddy] to be sure
to understand that as far as the President is
concerned, everybody in this case is to talk
and tell the truth. You are to tell everybody,
and you don't even have to call me on that
with anybody. You just say those are your
orders."
But even if Mr. Nixon had been involved
with the cover-up it is highly unlikely that he
would have told Petersen, then ultimately
responsible for the Justice Department probe,
anything different. And Petersen himself has
said that the course of action he asked Mr.
Nixon to take to facilitate the
investigation—firing Haldeman and John D.
Ehrlichman immediately, and retaining, at
least temporarily, Dean—was not followed.
Instead, Haldeman and Ehrlichman
remained for another two weeks, until they
resigned and Dean was fired at the same time.
As President Nixon said Monday night, his
own and others' interpretations of the edited
transcripts of subpoenaed Watergate tapes
indeed differ in many crucial areas.
In a 50-page brief accompanying the
transcripts, presidential attorney James D. St.
Clair cited several excerpts from the
transcripts as "proof" of Mr. Nixon's
innocence. But the true meaning of much of
the material cited is still open to question.
For example, the transcripts appear to
contradict in some points previous testimony
and presidential statements about the March
21, 1973 meeting at which the President said
he first learned of the cover-up.
