The bike riders of Stanford would be in ecstasy if the treacherous
Serra Street from Galvez Street west were totally re paved. Is there any
chance of this happening? B. vM.
Probably not, according to Perry Hackett, head of Environmental
Protection Services.
Hackett said that repaying Serra from Arguello to Via Palou was
high on his list of priorities, but there is no money in the budget that
will cover the cost of repaving. He also said that he has no idea when
there will be enough money to fix the road.
Does Stanford own Felt Lake? If so, who can use it? M.J.S.
I realize that Stanford University owns the area around Felt Lake,
but could you give me the name and address of the person to whom it
is leased? G.H.
Stanford does own Felt Lake and the surrounding land, but leases
it to Manuel Piers, according to Zera Coleman of the Land Resources
Department.
Piers's address is P.O. Box 1040, Palo Alto, CA 94302. Coleman
said that Stanford students may use the lake for educational purposes,
(for example, biology students might want to take water samples) but
a student must contact the Land Resources Department for
permission.
If a student wants to use Felt Lake for recreational purposes, he or
she should contact Piers, according to Coleman.
Just what is "dead week "? I fear I have been laboring under a grave
misconception. S.M.
Dead week is the week immediately preceding the beginning of
final exams. Classes are ending; the Daily publishes only once; in
short, the University pace seems to slacken.
President Richard Lyman claims that use of the term is one of his
pet peeves; he noted several months ago that it seemed to him
antithetical that the week of the quarter in which academic pursuits
are most intense should be referred to as "dead."
Who was Theodore Roosevelt's running mate when he ran for
President in 1912 on the Bull Moose Party ticket? H.A.C.
California Gov. Hiram Johnson.
