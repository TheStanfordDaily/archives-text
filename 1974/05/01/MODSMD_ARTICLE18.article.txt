# Body Movements Tell Story
## 
### CECILE HEROLD 
Three people are led into a
room of bare surroundings, seated
at a table, and told they are to be
jurors in a juvenile delinquency
case. The proceedings of the
conversation are then watched
through one-way mirrors and
videotaped via television cameras
and microphones set in the room.
The developer of this
experiment, Dr. Thomas Conner,
is a visiting professor of sociology
on a one-year sabbatical leave
from Michigan State University.
He is doing thorough research on
the subject of "body language,"
designing and carrying out a
number of his own experiments.
"The whole point of the jury
member test was to see how much
communication can occur in a
short space of time." "Conner
explains, "It began when the first
participant said, 'I think they
should send the boy to a foster
home.' 'I think so,' said
participant two, who nodded. The
third participant said nothing,
indicating tacit approval with
both body and facial movements.
Finally, he cast his eyes down at
the floor, having opted out of the
discussion."
Conner says such small group
experiments demonstrate a
tendency for participants to
establish themselves into a rank
order. 'The volunteers are given a
problem to solve and their
different competencies emerge.
We watch to see what effect this
has upon the pattern of
interaction. If a silence occurs,
who takes the floor and why?
Who is most easily influenced by
opinions? Why are some
suggestions accepted over others?
A person may say virtually little,
yet is given greater attention than
someone who is saying more but
lacks the presence of authority."
Conner's subjects are paid
volunteers, aware that they are
being watched, although "they
soon get used to the cameras."
In another study, Conner
learned that most working groups
try to avoid disagreement during
their meetings. "A member of a
committee may state an
unpopular opinion. Immediately a
ripple of body movement occurs
throughout the room. The
members get restless, look away,
and gradually shift the topic,"
Conner says.
The sociologist has recorded
other examples of body language
in his studies. "The same
movement can have different
meanings depending upon when it
is used. A nod serves as a
continuation reaction in some
cases,assuring the speaker, 'Go on.

I agree with what you say.' In
other circumstances it means,
'Hurry up and finish what you're
saying! It's my turn to talk!'
"The hands are used as
illustrators to give directions or
identify shapes as well as to stress
rhetorical points. The placement
of the hands during a conversation
is a key indicator of one's tension
or ease. Other indicators are far
more subtle. For instance, during
certain transactions even the
pupils may dilate."
Culture, besides circumstance,
influences body language. Conner
points out that Americans usually

stand three to four feet apart
when speaking and shift their
gazes from their partner's upper
lip to his eyes and back again. "In
contrast," he says, "Arabs stand
so close they can smell one
another's breath."
In the near future, Conner
plans to carry out body language
research on a more dynamic level,
studying conversation at an
emotional peak. He suggests one
plan, that of "following a
policeman around during his day's
duty as he makes an arrest,
confronts an irate motorist and
the like."
