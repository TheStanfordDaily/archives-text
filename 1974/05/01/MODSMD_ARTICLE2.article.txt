# Welcomes New Mediator
## Lyman Hopes To Avoid Strike 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Despite the slow progress in
negotiations, President Richard Lyman
yesterday expressed guarded optimism
that the University could avert a May
13 strike proposed by leaders of the
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman officially
welcomed federal mediator Clarence
Washington's entry into the now daily
bargaining sessions between the
University and the Union.
He called Washington "a very useful
third party" who might be able to see
a compromise that both sides have
missed.
"I have the sense that bargaining is
now going on at an accelerated pace,"
Lyman said, stressing that the
University will continue to "bargain in
good faith" to avoid a strike.
Contingency Plan
He again refused to detail the
University's "contingency plan" to
keep the University running should
USE's 1400 members walk out.
"1 don't want to be provocative. I
want to be constructive," Lyman
explained, adding that too much focus
on the "hypothetical" strike situation
might help bring that strike about.
A strike "certainly would have lot
of adverse consequences for
everybody," he said. "We want a
contract. I believe they want a
contract. ... We don't want a strike."
He emphasized that should a strike
occur, the University would do its best
to insure "good communication"
between the striking workers and the
University and to see that
"information about employees' rights
and responsibilities" reached those
workers.
Terrace Position
On other matters, Lyman
reaffirmed the University's position
that the Frenchman's Terrace housing
project should be composed of 40
percent middle income families rather
than only 20 percent as suggested by
the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD).
He also said a decision was
"imminent" on the emeritus faculty
housing project, previously set for the
Row.
Lyman said he is waiting for
campus committees to hand in their
recommendations before he approves a
final decision. However, the issue
"must be decided before summer

quarter," he stressed.
Judicial System
Asked about a new proposal from
student members of the Committee of
Fifteen (C-15) for a campus judicial
system, Lyman noted that the
proposal closely resembles the judicial
system which broke down in 1969
after a series of student sit-ins at Old
Union.
Bitterly criticized then, the system
invited the all-student trial panel and
the all-faculty appeals panel to become
"antagonists," Lyman said.
He added that the new proposal,
outlined in Monday's Daily, has not
been officially presented to him.
Turning to recent University
proposals for an on-campus pub in
Encina Snack Bar serving wine and
beer, Lyman said he thought it was "a
good idea from the start," but that he
has received a great deal of mail from
"older people" criticizing the
student-proposed name of "Little
Leland's."

"must be decided before summer

quarter," he stressed.
Judicial System
Asked about a new proposal from
student members of the Committee of
Fifteen (C-15) for a campus judicial
system, Lyman noted that the
proposal closely resembles the judicial
system which broke down in 1969
after a series of student sit-ins at Old
Union.
Bitterly criticized then, the system
invited the all-student trial panel and
the all-faculty appeals panel to become
"antagonists," Lyman said.
He added that the new proposal,
outlined in Monday's Daily, has not
been officially presented to him.
Turning to recent University
proposals for an on-campus pub in
Encina Snack Bar serving wine and
beer, Lyman said he thought it was "a
good idea from the start," but that he
has received a great deal of mail from
"older people" criticizing the
student-proposed name of "Little
Leland's."

PRESIDENT LYMAN
Despite the slow progress in
negotiations, President Richard Lyman
yesterday expressed guarded optimism
that the University could avert a May
13 strike proposed by leaders of the
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman officially
welcomed federal mediator Clarence
Washington's entry into the now daily
bargaining sessions between the
University and the Union.
He called Washington "a very useful
third party" who might be able to see
a compromise that both sides have
missed.
"I have the sense that bargaining is
now going on at an accelerated pace,"
Lyman said, stressing that the
University will continue to "bargain in
good faith" to avoid a strike.
Contingency Plan
He again refused to detail the
University's "contingency plan" to
keep the University running should
USE's 1400 members walk out.
"1 don't want to be provocative. I
want to be constructive," Lyman
explained, adding that too much focus
on the "hypothetical" strike situation
might help bring that strike about.
A strike "certainly would have lot
of adverse consequences for
everybody," he said. "We want a
contract. I believe they want a
contract. ... We don't want a strike."
He emphasized that should a strike
occur, the University would do its best
to insure "good communication"
between the striking workers and the
University and to see that
"information about employees' rights
and responsibilities" reached those
workers.
Terrace Position
On other matters, Lyman
reaffirmed the University's position
that the Frenchman's Terrace housing
project should be composed of 40
percent middle income families rather
than only 20 percent as suggested by
the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD).
He also said a decision was
"imminent" on the emeritus faculty
housing project, previously set for the
Row.
Lyman said he is waiting for
campus committees to hand in their
recommendations before he approves a
final decision. However, the issue
"must be decided before summer

quarter," he stressed.
