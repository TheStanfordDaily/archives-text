# Rita Campbell: Catalyst
## 
### 
Women's Newsservice
To some, committees are
groups that keep minutes and
waste hours. But as a veteran of
several presidential committees
and councils, Dr. Rita Ricardo
Campbell, economist and senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution,
finds them informative and
worthwhile.
Campbell will draw on her
experience as a member of the
National Advisory Drug
Committee and the Citizens'
Advisory Council on the Status of

Women, among others, in her
lecture on "Women and
Government Policy" at noon
tomorrow in Room 87 of the
Business School.
In addition to her viewpoint as
"a conservative economist,"
Campbell stresses her consumer
point of view on committees. "I
feel the consumer is
under-represented," she says. "We
should inform consumers, and
then let them decide on issues
which affect them, rather than
relying.. on government
regulations."
While Campbell defines her role
on most committees as a catalyst
bringing together several areas of
knowledge, her membership on
the Status of Women council has
been "a learning experience.
"I was not aware of the extent
of discrimination against women,"
she says. "For instance, I was
astonished at what I learned about
rape law in many states."
Although the Council is still
investigating the rape issue,
recommendations such as its
definition of maternity leave as a

temporary disability, and its
criterion of sex discrimination as a
means of denying federal
contracts, have already had
national impact.
Some of Campbell's economic
views may seem to put her at odds
with proposals advocated by some
feminists, but she maintains that
she is concerned about overall
gains for women. At present, for
example, working women receive
lower yearly social security
benefits than men because
statistically women have longer
life spans.
Campbell argues against
proposals for higher annuity
benefits for women because "for
an employer this would increase
the cost of hiring a women vis a
vis a man and would be
detrimental to increasing the
number of women hired."
Instead, she suggests redefining
mortality figures for women in
terms of women in the working
force. If preliminary data are
correct, this would make female
and male mortality figures more
similar.
