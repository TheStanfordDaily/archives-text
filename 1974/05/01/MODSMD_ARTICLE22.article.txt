# Bonn Program Praised By Students
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
The first group of students to
study at the Stanford German
Studies Program at the University
of Bonn have returned, and the
students' faith in the program
"has been well served," according
to two of them.
Janice Borgerson and David
Wisowaty, who were among the
pilot group in the Bonn program,
praised in a statement the "direct
and intensive contact with a
different culture" through classes
at the German university, cultural
activities in nearby cities and
friendship with German students
and families.
The program, co-sponsored by
the German Studies Department
and the Overseas Studies Office,
offers advanced undergraduate
and graduate students in German

studies as well as other majors a
chance to study at a German
university with full credit at
Stanford. The first group included
eight undergraduates and four
graduates, with majors in German
studies, economics, history and
psychology.
Adviser
German Studies Prof. Josef
Hutschneider accompanied the
group as an adviser and
student-university mediator.
Borgerson and Wisowaty praised
his "capacity for giving academic
and personal advice and creating
interest in cultural events."
The two-quarter program
includes a semester of study at the
University of Bonn, preceded by a
six-week introductory session in
September and October. Language
instruction, lectures and

orientation sessions administered
by the host university's
Auslandsamt (Foreign Students'
Office) prepare the students for
the semester which runs from
October to February.
Borgerson and Wisowaty were
somewhat critical of the
introductory program, which they
found "too uniform in structure
and content." However, the office
was receptive to their comments
and recommendations, and they
expect to see some revision in the
program to meet the needs of
future students, they added.
In addition to the University's
lecture and seminar courses, the
Auslandsamt offers group
tutorials and arranges for semester
examinations for the foreign
students. German students do not
take semester exams, but take a

series of comprehensive exams
after several years of study.
Living Options
Like German students,
Stanford students in Bonn can
choose from several living options
including dorms, private housing
or rooming with a family. Local
student pubs are one of the more
popular meeting places.
Cultural activities center
around Bonn, which is both the
West German capital and "a
provincial university town on the
Rhine," according to Borgerson
and Wisowaty. The nearby city of
Cologne offers "more
metropolitan activities," they
added, but noted that Bonn too
offered plenty of cultural variety,
from Brecht to Mozart to
Neanderthal man to Brandt.

and families.
The program, co-sponsored by
the German Studies Department
and the Overseas Studies Office,
offers advanced undergraduate
and graduate students in German

studies as well as other majors a
chance to study at a German
university with full credit at
Stanford. The first group included
eight undergraduates and four
graduates, with majors in German
studies, economics, history and
psychology.
Adviser
German Studies Prof. Josef
Hutschneider accompanied the
group as an adviser and
student-university mediator.
Borgerson and Wisowaty praised
his "capacity for giving academic
and personal advice and creating
interest in cultural events."
The two-quarter program
includes a semester of study at the
University of Bonn, preceded by a
six-week introductory session in
September and October. Language
instruction, lectures and

orientation sessions administered
by the host university's
Auslandsamt (Foreign Students'
Office) prepare the students for
the semester which runs from
October to February.
Borgerson and Wisowaty were
somewhat critical of the
introductory program, which they
found "too uniform in structure
and content." However, the office
was receptive to their comments
and recommendations, and they
expect to see some revision in the
program to meet the needs of
future students, they added.
In addition to the University's
lecture and seminar courses, the
Auslandsamt offers group
tutorials and arranges for semester
examinations for the foreign
students. German students do not
take semester exams, but take a

series of comprehensive exams
after several years of study.
Living Options
Like German students,
Stanford students in Bonn can
choose from several living options
including dorms, private housing
or rooming with a family. Local
student pubs are one of the more
popular meeting places.
Cultural activities center
around Bonn, which is both the
West German capital and "a
provincial university town on the
Rhine," according to Borgerson
and Wisowaty. The nearby city of
Cologne offers "more
metropolitan activities," they
added, but noted that Bonn too
offered plenty of cultural variety,
from Brecht to Mozart to
Neanderthal man to Brandt.
The first group of students to
study at the Stanford German
Studies Program at the University
of Bonn have returned, and the
students' faith in the program
"has been well served," according
to two of them.
Janice Borgerson and David
Wisowaty, who were among the
pilot group in the Bonn program,
praised in a statement the "direct
and intensive contact with a
different culture" through classes
at the German university, cultural
activities in nearby cities and
friendship with German students
and families.
