## Maybe Giants' Sex Lives Are Good

"Hitting a home run to win the game is even
better than making love. "
—Reggie Jackson
At the rate the San Francisco Giants are
hitting home runs this year, one must hope
that they are enjoying fantastic sex lives.
Through 22 games and 714 at bats, the
Giants' supposedly brutal bats had accounted
for all of 11 home runs. At this rate, the
Giants as a team might have trouble topping
Roger Maris' season home run record in their
remaining 140 games.
Dave Kingman leads the club with four
roundtrippers and my sources in Atlanta
assure me that Hank hasn't yet begun to
shake in fear. With their brilliant trading
tradition, the Giants are undoubtedly
responding to their toothpick problem by
negotiating for the services of Ed Brinkman.
Bay Area fans are used to the Giants
spending every October watching the Series
on TV, but a Giants team that hits with the
power of Little Leaguers is a new experience.
Willie Mays, who might very well have
broken the Babe's record before Aaron had it
not been for Candlestick Park, and Willie
McCovey, who used to hit balls into Alameda
County, were for years trademarks of a team
that depended on awesome power.
Other Problems
So far this season, the Giants have
definitely had problems compensating for
their lack of power in other ways. When you
aren't hitting home runs, you need a lot of
singles and a .231 team batting average isn't
the answer.
Elias Sosa and Billie Jean King's brother,
Randy Moffitt, constitute possibly the finest
bullpen in baseball, but when they have to
bail out starters with alarming frequency,

their effectiveness is bound to suffer.
The Giants have desperately missed Ron
Bryant, Tito Fuentes and Ed Goodson, but
injuries are not responsible for Bobby Bonds'
.250 average and seven RBIs, Chris Speier's
.231 average or Gary Matthews' .189
effectiveness.
Bright Spots
The Giants have had two bright spots so
far this season. Pitcher Mike Caldwell has
performed extremely well after coming into a
pressure-filled situation when the Giants sent
the legendary McCovey to San Diego for the
young lefthander. Caldwell has won four of
five decisions and has a fine 2.31 earned run
average.
Outfielder Garry Maddox has the
unenviable task of batting in Mays' old spot
and after hitting .319 a year ago, is off to a
.330 start this season. With Bonds, Matthews
et al slumping, Maddox has been largely
responsible for keeping the Giants from
challenging San Diego.
But as of yesterday, the Giants were only
2Vi games ahead of the Padres and an early
June swoon must might make a rapid descent
to the bottom a reality.
Leaving pitching aside momentarily, the
Giants can field potentially the finest group
of eight players in the league. With the
possible exception of catcher Ken Rudolph,
the Giants have players of unlimited
potential who seem frustrated primarily by
seemingly correctable problems such as
excessive strike out tendencies. When players
don't seem to learn however, one must often
turn to their mentor for an explanation.
But before moving onto the depressing
subject of Charlie Fox, let me briefly
examine the Giants pitching staff. Juan

Marichal and Gaylord Perry are long gone
and compared to the Dodgers, the Giants
staff appears questionable at best.
But if Bryant, who cut himself badly in an
absurd swimming pool accident during spring
training, can return to his form of last season,
and Caldwell continues his effectiveness, the
staff will be doing about as well as can be
expected.
The Giants might escape their mediocrity
and challenge the Dodgers for the division
title. But don't count on it as long as Fox is
running the show.
Evolution Disproved?
Fox is a caricature of what a baseball
manager should be and his primary job
qualification seems to be his "drinking
buddy" status with Giants owner Horace
Stoneham. Some cynics who claim that a
monkey could manage a major league
baseball team have suggested that the Giants
would be a perfect team for such an
experiment because they feel such a change
would not effect the mental capabilities of
the team's field management.
In all fairness, Fox is a nice guy, but he
suffers from an acute generation gap problem
that prevents meaningful communication
with his players. That is a charge frequently
leveled even at coaches from good ol
progressive Stanford, but it does apparently
have merit in its application to the situation
at Candlestick.
The Giants are unpredictable enough that
they could as easily finish last as first in their
division. Most likely, they'll end up
somewhere around their usual second place
spot. But I guess a lot of other perennial
bridesmaids probably have pretty active sex
lives too.
