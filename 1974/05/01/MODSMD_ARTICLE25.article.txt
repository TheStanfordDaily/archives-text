# The 						Recruiting Mess In College Athletics
## 
### PHILIP HEIMLICH First of Four Parts 
A high school football player once called up a
local radio station and told its sports director that
he had just received an athletic scholarship from
the U. of Mississippi.
Visibly impressed, the sports director asked the
athlete what position he played. "Halfback," the
player replied. And what honors, the man inquired,
had the boy received during his high school career?
"I led my conference in scoring," the player
answered.
The man then asked him how many points he
had scored his senior year. The athlete paused
momentarily, and then asked, "how much is six
times six?"
Few would argue that the player mentioned in
the story above stereotypes the recruited athlete.
Still, the episode points out the large premium
placed on obtaining a winning team in big-time
intercollegiate athletics today. Most assistant
football and basketball coaches spend over 50
percent of their working hours on recruiting.
No Stone Unturned
"You can't afford to leave a rock unturned,"
Nevada — Las Vegas football coach Ron Meyer has
stated. The U. of Texas is one school that doesn't;
it spends over $50,000 a year to finance its
recruiting efforts. The U. of Florida spends
$60,000.
At Ohio State the coaches spend enough time
just talking on the telephone to high school recruits
to run up a phone bill of $27,000 a year.
) This massive expenditure of time and money is
not made without reason. Most coaches agree that
"If you don't get the studs to begin with, no
amount of coaching will get you a winner."
Imaginative Inducements
According to NCAA rules, colleges may offer no
more than tuition, room, board, books and $15 a
month. A recent Time magazine article, however,
pointed out that to get high school stars to sign
letters of intent, "many schools use inducements

limited only by the imagination of their recruiters."
Moses Malone, this year's top high school
basketball prospect, has, been offered cars, a
campus apartment and money. Offensive tackle
Marvin Powell, now a freshman at USC, told Time
that "alumni from other schools were always
slipping me a $100 bill when we shook hands."
"You're out there trying to sell yourself and the
facts about your school," stated Texas football
coach Darrell Royal, "and the guy ain't hearing a
word you're saying. All he's wondering is when
you're going to start talking about money."
Ticket Scalping
Money, reported Time, is not the only
inducement offered, though. Another involves the
use of free tickets. "The NCAA permits every
player four tickets to each of his team's games—and
then winks at the common practice of scalping
those tickets."
NCAA regulations also state that "schools are
required to house and entertain visiting athletes on
a scale comparable to that of normal student life."
Yet recruits brought to Nevada—Las Vegas are put
up at a hotel on the strip and given a tab for meals
and sometimes gambling money.
Another popular technique involves using the
opposite sex to attract athletes. Kansas State coach
Vince Gibson takes a great deal of pride in the 50
"Gibson Girls" who he personally selects each year.
"Their job," sportswriter Sandy Padwe has
reported, "is to function as hostesses for the
pimply faced high school hotshots who are being
recruited by Gibson."
This is not an unusual practice. At Florida, the
hostess coeds are called "Gator Getters." Other
schools, such as Wichita State, employ less subtle
approaches.
One recruit there explained how he was given a
$20 bill and a blind date by the coach. "With a
dirty grin and a 'have fun,' the coach sent us off in
his red, air-conditioned, convertible Chevy. My date
liked to tease me with little quips like 'Oh, there's
the motel—l mean theater.' "

to run up a phone bill of $27,000 a year.
) This massive expenditure of time and money is
not made without reason. Most coaches agree that
"If you don't get the studs to begin with, no
amount of coaching will get you a winner."
Imaginative Inducements
According to NCAA rules, colleges may offer no
more than tuition, room, board, books and $15 a
month. A recent Time magazine article, however,
pointed out that to get high school stars to sign
letters of intent, "many schools use inducements

limited only by the imagination of their recruiters."
Moses Malone, this year's top high school
basketball prospect, has, been offered cars, a
campus apartment and money. Offensive tackle
Marvin Powell, now a freshman at USC, told Time
that "alumni from other schools were always
slipping me a $100 bill when we shook hands."
"You're out there trying to sell yourself and the
facts about your school," stated Texas football
coach Darrell Royal, "and the guy ain't hearing a
word you're saying. All he's wondering is when
you're going to start talking about money."
Ticket Scalping
Money, reported Time, is not the only
inducement offered, though. Another involves the
use of free tickets. "The NCAA permits every
player four tickets to each of his team's games—and
then winks at the common practice of scalping
those tickets."
NCAA regulations also state that "schools are
required to house and entertain visiting athletes on
a scale comparable to that of normal student life."
Yet recruits brought to Nevada—Las Vegas are put
up at a hotel on the strip and given a tab for meals
and sometimes gambling money.
Another popular technique involves using the
opposite sex to attract athletes. Kansas State coach
Vince Gibson takes a great deal of pride in the 50
"Gibson Girls" who he personally selects each year.
"Their job," sportswriter Sandy Padwe has
reported, "is to function as hostesses for the
pimply faced high school hotshots who are being
recruited by Gibson."
This is not an unusual practice. At Florida, the
hostess coeds are called "Gator Getters." Other
schools, such as Wichita State, employ less subtle
approaches.
One recruit there explained how he was given a
$20 bill and a blind date by the coach. "With a
dirty grin and a 'have fun,' the coach sent us off in
his red, air-conditioned, convertible Chevy. My date
liked to tease me with little quips like 'Oh, there's
the motel—l mean theater.' "
Friday: The source of the problem.
A high school football player once called up a
local radio station and told its sports director that
he had just received an athletic scholarship from
the U. of Mississippi.
Visibly impressed, the sports director asked the
athlete what position he played. "Halfback," the
player replied. And what honors, the man inquired,
had the boy received during his high school career?
"I led my conference in scoring," the player
answered.
The man then asked him how many points he
had scored his senior year. The athlete paused
momentarily, and then asked, "how much is six
times six?"
Few would argue that the player mentioned in
the story above stereotypes the recruited athlete.
Still, the episode points out the large premium
placed on obtaining a winning team in big-time
intercollegiate athletics today. Most assistant
football and basketball coaches spend over 50
percent of their working hours on recruiting.
No Stone Unturned
"You can't afford to leave a rock unturned,"
Nevada — Las Vegas football coach Ron Meyer has
stated. The U. of Texas is one school that doesn't;
it spends over $50,000 a year to finance its
recruiting efforts. The U. of Florida spends
$60,000.
At Ohio State the coaches spend enough time
just talking on the telephone to high school recruits
to run up a phone bill of $27,000 a year.
