# Improved Club Hosts Bears
## Laxmen Attempt To Stop Cal Streak 
### 
It's evident that Stanford's
lacrosse club is considerably
improved from previous years, as
its 4-1 league record shows. The
proof may come today.
The Cards host California at 4
p.m. at the lacrosse field, located
between the tennis courts and
Maples Pavilion. Stanford hasn't
beaten the Bears in four years,
and will be trying to avenge a 12-6
defeat in an unofficial scrimmage
earlier this season.
A win would tie the Cards for
the lead in the Northern
California Lacrosse Association,
and would ensure that they meet
the Bears when playoffs begin
later this month.
But of course, a win will be
hard to get. While the new league
ruling which allows graduate
students to play for their schools
greatly aids Stanford, it also
provides Cal with a top
attackman, All-American Dick
Graham from Princeton.
Volunteer coaches Sam Stadler
and Dave Tubbs have assigned
junior defenseman Tom Earthman
to guard Graham. Earthman will
be joined by consistent freshman
Dave Swanson, with Henry Miner
and ailing Whit Budge filling in
the other slot position.
The defense has played
inconsistently this season, but
Earthman insists that "by rotating
all of our defensemen in and out
throughout the game, we expect
to put the lid on Graham and his
cohorts. If we can shut them out,
then our attack and middies will
have fun all afternoon."
One of those middies turns out
to be ex-cadet Jack Mayer, a
former All-American from West
Point. Mayer, a graduate student
in engineering, has bolstered the
Stanford team considerably this
year with his aggressive, skillful

play.
Another middie, senior Shelley
Gordon, has added to Stanford's
scoring punch with his side-arm,
left-handed shot. "Wheezer"
Taylor and John Sprole will also
see action.
Senior Buzz Haddow leads the
attack again this year, but the
addition of two partners—grad

student Lyn Spraggs, known for
his quick stick and freshman
Gregg Hoberg—has aided
Stanford's goal-scoring potential.
One other factor has improved
the team this season to the point
where it could beat Cal. Coaches
Tubbs and Stadler have
introduced discipline to the club,

which formerly was noted mainly
for post-game beer parties. Their
combined total of over 50 years
of lacrosse experience has been of
great aid to the players.
After the Cal game, Stanford
will rest until Sunday, when it
hosts Claremont, which it beat by
a narrow 7-6 margin earlier this
season.
