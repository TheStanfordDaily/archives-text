# Hampton, Davis Star In Stanford Grand Finale
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Saving the grand finale until
there were two outs in the ninth
inning, Stanford's baseball team
came from behind to beat
California 10-7 yesterday in a
three-ring circus at Clint Evans
Park on the Berkeley campus.
The non-conference victory,
the fourth straight for the Cards,
brought Stanford's record up to
18-21 for the year. The Cards
travel to Los Angeles for three
games against USC in a bid to take
a share of first place in the Pacific
Eight Southern Division this
weekend. Stanford is 6-6 while
USC is 9-3.
The Cards fell behind 6-3 late in
the ball game mainly as a result of
six errors. "It was probably our
worst defensive game of the
year," said team statistician John
Q. Wright. "We just brutalized the
game."
An example of a Card miscue

came in the fifth inning when
Eandy Hooper reached first on an
error by Kim Hannaford. Hooper,
attempting to steal second, scored
from first when catcher Dave
Baker's throw went into
centerfield and skipped by 'a
charging Bob Hampton on a wierd
hop. Those were three of
Stanford's errors.
"It was just horrendous," said
Stanford head coach Ray Young.
"We played as poor baseball as we
could for 8 2/3-' innings. Then we
turned everything around."
The Cards scored seven times
in the last inning, which was
highlighted by Bob Hampton's
two-out two-run double that
brought in Gary Pitchford and
Baker with the tying and
winning runs.
Then, Steve Davis slugged a
400-foot homer over the
left-centerfield fence for three
more runs to cinch the win.
Hampton belted his sixth home
run of the year in the second
inning.
Stanford's Dave Frost, who has
been hampered by back problems,
started the game but pitched to
only one batter. The senior
righthander is suffering from
tendonitis in his pitching
shoulder. He was administered a
cortisone shot last Saturday.
"Dave is very doubtful for this

weekend," said Young. "We're
going to take two freshman
pitchers, Bruce Davis and Jerry
Argust to USC. They have pitched
very well on the junior varsity
level."
Kent Caldwell relieved Frost
and pitched well for six innings,
allowing no earned runs. He
struck out three and walked two.
Bernie Hittner pitched the final
two innings for Stanford gaining
the win, his third win against two
losses.

wild against UCLA catchers

Mark Lucich is tied with Mike
