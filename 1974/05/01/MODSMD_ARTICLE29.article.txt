Subpoena Challenge Reported
WASHINGTON — The White House is preparing
legal moves to challenge special Watergate
prosecutor Leon Jaworski's subpoena for tape
recordings of 64 of President Nixon's conversations,
sources indicated last night.
The sources said the final decision on whether to
fight the Jaworski subpoena in the courts still is to
be made by the President.
But they reported that work already is underway
on a proposed motion to quash the subpoena, which
carries a Thursday deadline for response by the
President.
However, The New York Times, in a story
published last night quoting Nixon's chief Watergate
lawyer, said the President already has decided to
refuse to surrender the materials subpoenaed by
Jaworski, and that a move will be made in court to
quash the subpoena.
Zebra Suspects In Jail?
SAN FRANCISCO — Two men believed linked
to the Zebra street slayings are being held in jails
outside San Francisco, television station KRON said
last night.
Police refused to comment on the report.
The station, which did not identify the men or
the jails, also said Mayor Joseph L. Alioto met over
the weekend with an eyewitness to at least one of
the apparently motiveless slayings of 12 white
persons and the wounding of six others by black
assailants since last November.
Police would not comment on the report. Alioto
earlier had said that no arrests have been made.
The broadcast report also said, "Channel Four
has learned that the killings are related to a weird
and bizarre initiation rite for a black militant group
that is active throughout the United States."
The station said it had learned that the reason
Alioto abruptly halted his campaign for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination last weekend
was to return to San Francisco and "talk with an
eyewitness to at least one of the Zebra killings. Not
only an eyewitness ... but probably an accomplice
in at least one of those murders."
Alioto has said only that he met with an attorney
and client and police to discuss the killings. He did
say yesterday that a .32 caliber weapon has been
turned over to police and "tests are being made now
to determine whether or not it is the weapon in
question."
The Zebra shootings all involved .32 caliber guns.
Alioto said he planned to meet with state Atty.
Gen. Evelle Younger last night and would make a
statement today when "things will be a lot clearer."
He said of Younger, "I will give him information
which at the present time he doesn't have."
Earlier, the attorney general said there was no
evidence of a statewide conspiracy to link the Zebra
shootings here with a string of almost 70 murders
dating back to 1971.
Alioto told reporters Monday that he believed
the Zebra shootings may be related to as many as 68
murders throughout the state because they seemed
to follow a similar pattern.
SLA 'Founder': Release Hearst
SAN FRANCISCO — The imprisoned,
self-proclaimed founder of the Symbionese
Liberation Army urged the terrorists yesterday to
provide $4 million in food for the poor by releasing
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.

Clifford "Death Row Jeff" Jefferson issued his
plea to SLA Field Marshall Cinque through his
lawyer Vincent Hallinan, saying:
"I have absolute faith that Cinque will do what is
proper to prove the conditions for spending the $4
million."
The appeal came just three days before a
deadline set by the Hearst Corp., which pledged the
money for a massive food giveaway if Hearst is
released unharmed by Friday.
Meanwhile in Oakland, a judge set the highest
bail ir. Alameda County history — $500,000 each —
for two alleged SLA "soldiers" accused of
murdering Oakland schools Supt. Marcus Foster last
Nov. 6.
In another development corporations and
foundations would be barred from paying extortion
demands such as those in the Patricia Hearst
kidnaping under legislation sponsored by California
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger.
The five bills, to be introduced by state Sen.
Dennis E. Carpenter, R—Newport Beach, would
make organizers of food distributions and other
giveaways demanded by extortionists subject to
prosecution.
Any official actions such as the release of a state
prisoner in response to such demands would be void
under one of the measures.
Dock Workers May Strike
SAN FRANCISCO — The International
Longshoremen and Warehousemen's Union alerted
12,000 dock workers for a possible strike today at
West Coast ports from San Diego to Seattle to win a
cost-of-living pay raise, a union source here said.
At the ILWU headquarters here the official word
was "no comment," but one high ILWU official told
the Associated Press, "We're still on standby, but
there's every indication we'll go out at 8 a.m."
With the expiration of controls yesterday, the
longshoremen contend they should have the 30
cents that was cut from a 72-cent-an-hour raise in
1972, plus a few cents more to make up for the
inflation in the interim.
Kissinger Arrives In Egypt
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt — Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger flew into this Egyptian port city
last night to enlist the prestige and support of
President Anwar Sadat in his drive to disentangle
Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights.
A senior American official said on the flight from
Algiers that Kissinger's hopes "were slightly raised"
following ' talks with President Houari
Boumedienne and before that with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei A. Gromyko.
But the official said the Middle East peace
mission would be "protracted" and there will not be
an agreement unless both Syria and Israel make
concessions.
And in Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Abba Eban
announced that U.N. Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim will visit the Middle East in early June.
It will be Waldheim's second visit to the area in
less than a year. His first visit preceded the October
war by only five weeks.
Meanwhile, Israeli planes flew over Mt. Hermon
again yesterday, blasting Syrian targets near the
craggy crest that looms over the Golan Heights plain
with increasing strategic and political value.
The Israeli command said all of its planes
returned safely.
Artillery duels and heavy fighting were reported

on Mt. Hermon and the Golan Heights below.
The Syrian command said its forces destroyed
four Israeli tanks, one missile base and an
ammunition depot in predawn fighting, but Israel
denied it.
Wage-Price Controls Expire
WASHINGTON — Scorned and reviled by those
who had once supported it, the administration's
wage and price controls program expired yesterday
after two and a half years of controversy.
Industries freed from wage and price restraints as
of midnight yesterday included steel, health,
construction food processing, local and state
government employees, copper and retail auto sales.
Most other industries were previously freed from
controls. The only industry still subject to them is
petroleum, which is under a different program.
Director John T. Dunlop of the Cost of Living
Council has warned that particularly big price
increases may come in the near future in the steel
and health industries.
The Senate has scheduled a vote today on a
last-minute proposal to give the President authority
to impose controls on a selected basis for one more
year.
Its passage is doubtful. The administration
opposes it. House Speaker Carl Albert said yesterday
that the Democratic leadership in the Congress
"cannot at this time recommend further
continuation" of controls.
Marijuana Bill Clears Committee
SACRAMENTO — Legislation easing penalties
for marijuana possession cleared its last committee
hurdle yesterday and headed for the Senate floor.
The measure by Assemblyman Alan Sieroty,
D—Beverly Hills, was apporved 7-3 by the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
It would reduce the penalty for street possession
of two ounces or less of marijuana to a maximum
six months in jail and a $500 fine for first offenders.
The measure would provide the same penalities
for persons found possessing four ounces or less of
marijuana in their home.
Minimum Wage Raise In Effect
WASHINGTON — About 4.2 million workers are
due for immediate raises of up to $16 a week under
the new minimum wage law taking effect today, but
it could be several weeks before the money begins
showing up in paychecks.
The increase in the minimum wage is the first in
six years. It will go up in steps over the next two
years to an ultimate floor of $2.30 an hour for some
56 million workers.
Milwaukee Evens Series
MILWAUKEE — Cornell Warner sank two stuff
shots in the last 34 seconds of overtime, blunting a
furious Boston comeback and lifting the Milwaukee
Bucks to a 105-96 victory last night that evened the
National Basketball Association final series at 1-1.
Today's Weather
Low clouds and fog near the coast extending

announced that U.N. Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim will visit the Middle East in early June.
It will be Waldheim's second visit to the area in
less than a year. His first visit preceded the October
war by only five weeks.
Meanwhile, Israeli planes flew over Mt. Hermon
again yesterday, blasting Syrian targets near the
craggy crest that looms over the Golan Heights plain
with increasing strategic and political value.
The Israeli command said all of its planes
returned safely.
Artillery duels and heavy fighting were reported

on Mt. Hermon and the Golan Heights below.
The Syrian command said its forces destroyed
four Israeli tanks, one missile base and an
ammunition depot in predawn fighting, but Israel
denied it.
Wage-Price Controls Expire
WASHINGTON — Scorned and reviled by those
who had once supported it, the administration's
wage and price controls program expired yesterday
after two and a half years of controversy.
Industries freed from wage and price restraints as
of midnight yesterday included steel, health,
construction food processing, local and state
government employees, copper and retail auto sales.
Most other industries were previously freed from
controls. The only industry still subject to them is
petroleum, which is under a different program.
Director John T. Dunlop of the Cost of Living
Council has warned that particularly big price
increases may come in the near future in the steel
and health industries.
The Senate has scheduled a vote today on a
last-minute proposal to give the President authority
to impose controls on a selected basis for one more
year.
Its passage is doubtful. The administration
opposes it. House Speaker Carl Albert said yesterday
that the Democratic leadership in the Congress
"cannot at this time recommend further
continuation" of controls.
Marijuana Bill Clears Committee
SACRAMENTO — Legislation easing penalties
for marijuana possession cleared its last committee
hurdle yesterday and headed for the Senate floor.
The measure by Assemblyman Alan Sieroty,
D—Beverly Hills, was apporved 7-3 by the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
It would reduce the penalty for street possession
of two ounces or less of marijuana to a maximum
six months in jail and a $500 fine for first offenders.
The measure would provide the same penalities
for persons found possessing four ounces or less of
marijuana in their home.
Minimum Wage Raise In Effect
WASHINGTON — About 4.2 million workers are
due for immediate raises of up to $16 a week under
the new minimum wage law taking effect today, but
it could be several weeks before the money begins
showing up in paychecks.
The increase in the minimum wage is the first in
six years. It will go up in steps over the next two
years to an ultimate floor of $2.30 an hour for some
56 million workers.
Milwaukee Evens Series
MILWAUKEE — Cornell Warner sank two stuff
shots in the last 34 seconds of overtime, blunting a
furious Boston comeback and lifting the Milwaukee
Bucks to a 105-96 victory last night that evened the
National Basketball Association final series at 1-1.
Today's Weather
Low clouds and fog near the coast extending
inland nights and this morning becoming patchy
tomorrow morning. Fair otherwise through
tomorrow. Slightly warmer tomorrow. Low tonight
in upper 40s to low 50s. Highs today in upper 50s
and 60s and tomorrow in mid 60s to mid 70s.
Westerly wind 10 to 20 mph.
Subpoena Challenge Reported
WASHINGTON — The White House is preparing
legal moves to challenge special Watergate
prosecutor Leon Jaworski's subpoena for tape
recordings of 64 of President Nixon's conversations,
sources indicated last night.
The sources said the final decision on whether to
fight the Jaworski subpoena in the courts still is to
be made by the President.
But they reported that work already is underway
on a proposed motion to quash the subpoena, which
carries a Thursday deadline for response by the
President.
However, The New York Times, in a story
published last night quoting Nixon's chief Watergate
lawyer, said the President already has decided to
refuse to surrender the materials subpoenaed by
Jaworski, and that a move will be made in court to
quash the subpoena.
Zebra Suspects In Jail?
SAN FRANCISCO — Two men believed linked
to the Zebra street slayings are being held in jails
outside San Francisco, television station KRON said
last night.
Police refused to comment on the report.
The station, which did not identify the men or
the jails, also said Mayor Joseph L. Alioto met over
the weekend with an eyewitness to at least one of
the apparently motiveless slayings of 12 white
persons and the wounding of six others by black
assailants since last November.
Police would not comment on the report. Alioto
earlier had said that no arrests have been made.
The broadcast report also said, "Channel Four
has learned that the killings are related to a weird
and bizarre initiation rite for a black militant group
that is active throughout the United States."
The station said it had learned that the reason
Alioto abruptly halted his campaign for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination last weekend
was to return to San Francisco and "talk with an
eyewitness to at least one of the Zebra killings. Not
only an eyewitness ... but probably an accomplice
in at least one of those murders."
Alioto has said only that he met with an attorney
and client and police to discuss the killings. He did
say yesterday that a .32 caliber weapon has been
turned over to police and "tests are being made now
to determine whether or not it is the weapon in
question."
The Zebra shootings all involved .32 caliber guns.
Alioto said he planned to meet with state Atty.
Gen. Evelle Younger last night and would make a
statement today when "things will be a lot clearer."
He said of Younger, "I will give him information
which at the present time he doesn't have."
Earlier, the attorney general said there was no
evidence of a statewide conspiracy to link the Zebra
shootings here with a string of almost 70 murders
dating back to 1971.
Alioto told reporters Monday that he believed
the Zebra shootings may be related to as many as 68
murders throughout the state because they seemed
to follow a similar pattern.
SLA 'Founder': Release Hearst
SAN FRANCISCO — The imprisoned,
self-proclaimed founder of the Symbionese
Liberation Army urged the terrorists yesterday to
provide $4 million in food for the poor by releasing
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.

Clifford "Death Row Jeff" Jefferson issued his
plea to SLA Field Marshall Cinque through his
lawyer Vincent Hallinan, saying:
"I have absolute faith that Cinque will do what is
proper to prove the conditions for spending the $4
million."
The appeal came just three days before a
deadline set by the Hearst Corp., which pledged the
money for a massive food giveaway if Hearst is
released unharmed by Friday.
Meanwhile in Oakland, a judge set the highest
bail ir. Alameda County history — $500,000 each —
for two alleged SLA "soldiers" accused of
murdering Oakland schools Supt. Marcus Foster last
Nov. 6.
In another development corporations and
foundations would be barred from paying extortion
demands such as those in the Patricia Hearst
kidnaping under legislation sponsored by California
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger.
The five bills, to be introduced by state Sen.
Dennis E. Carpenter, R—Newport Beach, would
make organizers of food distributions and other
giveaways demanded by extortionists subject to
prosecution.
Any official actions such as the release of a state
prisoner in response to such demands would be void
under one of the measures.
Dock Workers May Strike
SAN FRANCISCO — The International
Longshoremen and Warehousemen's Union alerted
12,000 dock workers for a possible strike today at
West Coast ports from San Diego to Seattle to win a
cost-of-living pay raise, a union source here said.
At the ILWU headquarters here the official word
was "no comment," but one high ILWU official told
the Associated Press, "We're still on standby, but
there's every indication we'll go out at 8 a.m."
With the expiration of controls yesterday, the
longshoremen contend they should have the 30
cents that was cut from a 72-cent-an-hour raise in
1972, plus a few cents more to make up for the
inflation in the interim.
Kissinger Arrives In Egypt
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt — Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger flew into this Egyptian port city
last night to enlist the prestige and support of
President Anwar Sadat in his drive to disentangle
Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights.
A senior American official said on the flight from
Algiers that Kissinger's hopes "were slightly raised"
following ' talks with President Houari
Boumedienne and before that with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei A. Gromyko.
But the official said the Middle East peace
mission would be "protracted" and there will not be
an agreement unless both Syria and Israel make
concessions.
And in Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Abba Eban
announced that U.N. Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim will visit the Middle East in early June.
It will be Waldheim's second visit to the area in

Alioto said he planned to meet with state Atty.
Gen. Evelle Younger last night and would make a
statement today when "things will be a lot clearer."
He said of Younger, "I will give him information
which at the present time he doesn't have."
Earlier, the attorney general said there was no
evidence of a statewide conspiracy to link the Zebra
shootings here with a string of almost 70 murders
dating back to 1971.
Alioto told reporters Monday that he believed
the Zebra shootings may be related to as many as 68
murders throughout the state because they seemed
to follow a similar pattern.
SLA 'Founder': Release Hearst
SAN FRANCISCO — The imprisoned,
self-proclaimed founder of the Symbionese
Liberation Army urged the terrorists yesterday to
provide $4 million in food for the poor by releasing
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.

Clifford "Death Row Jeff" Jefferson issued his
plea to SLA Field Marshall Cinque through his
lawyer Vincent Hallinan, saying:
"I have absolute faith that Cinque will do what is
proper to prove the conditions for spending the $4
million."
The appeal came just three days before a
deadline set by the Hearst Corp., which pledged the
money for a massive food giveaway if Hearst is
released unharmed by Friday.
Meanwhile in Oakland, a judge set the highest
bail ir. Alameda County history — $500,000 each —
for two alleged SLA "soldiers" accused of
murdering Oakland schools Supt. Marcus Foster last
Nov. 6.
In another development corporations and
foundations would be barred from paying extortion
demands such as those in the Patricia Hearst
kidnaping under legislation sponsored by California
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger.
The five bills, to be introduced by state Sen.
Dennis E. Carpenter, R—Newport Beach, would
make organizers of food distributions and other
giveaways demanded by extortionists subject to
prosecution.
Any official actions such as the release of a state
prisoner in response to such demands would be void
under one of the measures.
Dock Workers May Strike
SAN FRANCISCO — The International
Longshoremen and Warehousemen's Union alerted
12,000 dock workers for a possible strike today at
West Coast ports from San Diego to Seattle to win a
cost-of-living pay raise, a union source here said.
At the ILWU headquarters here the official word
was "no comment," but one high ILWU official told
the Associated Press, "We're still on standby, but
there's every indication we'll go out at 8 a.m."
With the expiration of controls yesterday, the
longshoremen contend they should have the 30
cents that was cut from a 72-cent-an-hour raise in
1972, plus a few cents more to make up for the
inflation in the interim.
Kissinger Arrives In Egypt
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt — Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger flew into this Egyptian port city
last night to enlist the prestige and support of
President Anwar Sadat in his drive to disentangle
Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights.
A senior American official said on the flight from
Algiers that Kissinger's hopes "were slightly raised"
following ' talks with President Houari
Boumedienne and before that with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei A. Gromyko.
But the official said the Middle East peace
mission would be "protracted" and there will not be
an agreement unless both Syria and Israel make
concessions.
And in Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Abba Eban
announced that U.N. Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim will visit the Middle East in early June.
It will be Waldheim's second visit to the area in
less than a year. His first visit preceded the October
war by only five weeks.
Meanwhile, Israeli planes flew over Mt. Hermon
again yesterday, blasting Syrian targets near the
craggy crest that looms over the Golan Heights plain
with increasing strategic and political value.
The Israeli command said all of its planes
returned safely.
Artillery duels and heavy fighting were reported

on Mt. Hermon and the Golan Heights below.
The Syrian command said its forces destroyed
four Israeli tanks, one missile base and an
ammunition depot in predawn fighting, but Israel
denied it.
Wage-Price Controls Expire
WASHINGTON — Scorned and reviled by those
who had once supported it, the administration's
wage and price controls program expired yesterday
after two and a half years of controversy.
Industries freed from wage and price restraints as
of midnight yesterday included steel, health,
construction food processing, local and state
government employees, copper and retail auto sales.
Most other industries were previously freed from
controls. The only industry still subject to them is
petroleum, which is under a different program.
Director John T. Dunlop of the Cost of Living
Council has warned that particularly big price
increases may come in the near future in the steel
and health industries.
The Senate has scheduled a vote today on a
last-minute proposal to give the President authority
to impose controls on a selected basis for one more
year.
Its passage is doubtful. The administration
opposes it. House Speaker Carl Albert said yesterday
that the Democratic leadership in the Congress
"cannot at this time recommend further
continuation" of controls.
Marijuana Bill Clears Committee
SACRAMENTO — Legislation easing penalties
for marijuana possession cleared its last committee
hurdle yesterday and headed for the Senate floor.
The measure by Assemblyman Alan Sieroty,

Judiciary Committee.
It would reduce the penalty for street possession
of two ounces or less of marijuana to a maximum
six months in jail and a $500 fine for first offenders.
The measure would provide the same penalities
for persons found possessing four ounces or less of
marijuana in their home.
Minimum Wage Raise In Effect
WASHINGTON — About 4.2 million workers are
due for immediate raises of up to $16 a week under
the new minimum wage law taking effect today, but
it could be several weeks before the money begins
showing up in paychecks.
The increase in the minimum wage is the first in
six years. It will go up in steps over the next two
years to an ultimate floor of $2.30 an hour for some
56 million workers.
Milwaukee Evens Series
MILWAUKEE — Cornell Warner sank two stuff

Bucks to a 105-96 victory last night that evened the
National Basketball Association final series at 1-1.
Today's Weather
Low clouds and fog near the coast extending
inland nights and this morning becoming patchy

Subpoena Challenge Reported
WASHINGTON — The White House is preparing
legal moves to challenge special Watergate
prosecutor Leon Jaworski's subpoena for tape
recordings of 64 of President Nixon's conversations,
sources indicated last night.
The sources said the final decision on whether to
fight the Jaworski subpoena in the courts still is to
be made by the President.
But they reported that work already is underway
on a proposed motion to quash the subpoena, which
carries a Thursday deadline for response by the
President.
However, The New York Times, in a story
published last night quoting Nixon's chief Watergate
lawyer, said the President already has decided to
refuse to surrender the materials subpoenaed by
Jaworski, and that a move will be made in court to
quash the subpoena.
Zebra Suspects In Jail?
SAN FRANCISCO — Two men believed linked
to the Zebra street slayings are being held in jails
outside San Francisco, television station KRON said
last night.
Police refused to comment on the report.
The station, which did not identify the men or
the jails, also said Mayor Joseph L. Alioto met over
the weekend with an eyewitness to at least one of
the apparently motiveless slayings of 12 white
persons and the wounding of six others by black
assailants since last November.
Police would not comment on the report. Alioto
earlier had said that no arrests have been made.
The broadcast report also said, "Channel Four
has learned that the killings are related to a weird
and bizarre initiation rite for a black militant group
that is active throughout the United States."
The station said it had learned that the reason
Alioto abruptly halted his campaign for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination last weekend
was to return to San Francisco and "talk with an
eyewitness to at least one of the Zebra killings. Not
only an eyewitness ... but probably an accomplice
in at least one of those murders."
Alioto has said only that he met with an attorney
and client and police to discuss the killings. He did
say yesterday that a .32 caliber weapon has been
turned over to police and "tests are being made now
to determine whether or not it is the weapon in
question."
The Zebra shootings all involved .32 caliber guns.
Alioto said he planned to meet with state Atty.
Gen. Evelle Younger last night and would make a
statement today when "things will be a lot clearer."
He said of Younger, "I will give him information

for persons found possessing four ounces or less of
marijuana in their home.
Minimum Wage Raise In Effect
WASHINGTON — About 4.2 million workers are
due for immediate raises of up to $16 a week under
the new minimum wage law taking effect today, but
it could be several weeks before the money begins
showing up in paychecks.
The increase in the minimum wage is the first in
six years. It will go up in steps over the next two
years to an ultimate floor of $2.30 an hour for some
56 million workers.

Today's Weather
Low clouds and fog near the coast extending
inland nights and this morning becoming patchy
tomorrow morning. Fair otherwise through

Subpoena Challenge Reported
WASHINGTON — The White House is preparing
legal moves to challenge special Watergate
prosecutor Leon Jaworski's subpoena for tape
recordings of 64 of President Nixon's conversations,
sources indicated last night.
The sources said the final decision on whether to
fight the Jaworski subpoena in the courts still is to
be made by the President.
But they reported that work already is underway
on a proposed motion to quash the subpoena, which
carries a Thursday deadline for response by the
President.
However, The New York Times, in a story
published last night quoting Nixon's chief Watergate
lawyer, said the President already has decided to
refuse to surrender the materials subpoenaed by
Jaworski, and that a move will be made in court to
quash the subpoena.
Zebra Suspects In Jail?
SAN FRANCISCO — Two men believed linked
to the Zebra street slayings are being held in jails
outside San Francisco, television station KRON said
last night.
Police refused to comment on the report.
The station, which did not identify the men or
the jails, also said Mayor Joseph L. Alioto met over
the weekend with an eyewitness to at least one of
the apparently motiveless slayings of 12 white
persons and the wounding of six others by black
assailants since last November.
Police would not comment on the report. Alioto
earlier had said that no arrests have been made.
The broadcast report also said, "Channel Four
has learned that the killings are related to a weird
and bizarre initiation rite for a black militant group
that is active throughout the United States."
The station said it had learned that the reason
Alioto abruptly halted his campaign for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination last weekend
was to return to San Francisco and "talk with an
eyewitness to at least one of the Zebra killings. Not
only an eyewitness ... but probably an accomplice
in at least one of those murders."
Alioto has said only that he met with an attorney
and client and police to discuss the killings. He did
say yesterday that a .32 caliber weapon has been
turned over to police and "tests are being made now
to determine whether or not it is the weapon in
question."
The Zebra shootings all involved .32 caliber guns.
Alioto said he planned to meet with state Atty.
Gen. Evelle Younger last night and would make a
statement today when "things will be a lot clearer."
He said of Younger, "I will give him information
which at the present time he doesn't have."
Earlier, the attorney general said there was no
evidence of a statewide conspiracy to link the Zebra
shootings here with a string of almost 70 murders
dating back to 1971.
Alioto told reporters Monday that he believed
the Zebra shootings may be related to as many as 68
murders throughout the state because they seemed
to follow a similar pattern.
SLA 'Founder': Release Hearst
SAN FRANCISCO — The imprisoned,
self-proclaimed founder of the Symbionese
Liberation Army urged the terrorists yesterday to
provide $4 million in food for the poor by releasing
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.

Clifford "Death Row Jeff" Jefferson issued his
plea to SLA Field Marshall Cinque through his
lawyer Vincent Hallinan, saying:
"I have absolute faith that Cinque will do what is
proper to prove the conditions for spending the $4
million."
The appeal came just three days before a
deadline set by the Hearst Corp., which pledged the
money for a massive food giveaway if Hearst is
released unharmed by Friday.
Meanwhile in Oakland, a judge set the highest
bail ir. Alameda County history — $500,000 each —
for two alleged SLA "soldiers" accused of
murdering Oakland schools Supt. Marcus Foster last
Nov. 6.
In another development corporations and
foundations would be barred from paying extortion
demands such as those in the Patricia Hearst
kidnaping under legislation sponsored by California
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger.
The five bills, to be introduced by state Sen.
Dennis E. Carpenter, R—Newport Beach, would
make organizers of food distributions and other
giveaways demanded by extortionists subject to
prosecution.
Any official actions such as the release of a state
prisoner in response to such demands would be void
under one of the measures.
Dock Workers May Strike
SAN FRANCISCO — The International
Longshoremen and Warehousemen's Union alerted
12,000 dock workers for a possible strike today at
West Coast ports from San Diego to Seattle to win a
cost-of-living pay raise, a union source here said.
At the ILWU headquarters here the official word
was "no comment," but one high ILWU official told
the Associated Press, "We're still on standby, but
there's every indication we'll go out at 8 a.m."
With the expiration of controls yesterday, the
longshoremen contend they should have the 30
cents that was cut from a 72-cent-an-hour raise in
1972, plus a few cents more to make up for the
inflation in the interim.
Kissinger Arrives In Egypt
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt — Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger flew into this Egyptian port city
last night to enlist the prestige and support of
President Anwar Sadat in his drive to disentangle
Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights.
A senior American official said on the flight from
Algiers that Kissinger's hopes "were slightly raised"
following ' talks with President Houari
Boumedienne and before that with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei A. Gromyko.
But the official said the Middle East peace
mission would be "protracted" and there will not be
an agreement unless both Syria and Israel make
concessions.
And in Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Abba Eban
announced that U.N. Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim will visit the Middle East in early June.
It will be Waldheim's second visit to the area in
less than a year. His first visit preceded the October
war by only five weeks.
Meanwhile, Israeli planes flew over Mt. Hermon
again yesterday, blasting Syrian targets near the
craggy crest that looms over the Golan Heights plain
with increasing strategic and political value.
The Israeli command said all of its planes
returned safely.
Artillery duels and heavy fighting were reported

on Mt. Hermon and the Golan Heights below.
The Syrian command said its forces destroyed
four Israeli tanks, one missile base and an
ammunition depot in predawn fighting, but Israel
denied it.
Wage-Price Controls Expire
WASHINGTON — Scorned and reviled by those
who had once supported it, the administration's
wage and price controls program expired yesterday
after two and a half years of controversy.
Industries freed from wage and price restraints as
of midnight yesterday included steel, health,
construction food processing, local and state
government employees, copper and retail auto sales.
Most other industries were previously freed from
controls. The only industry still subject to them is
petroleum, which is under a different program.
Director John T. Dunlop of the Cost of Living
Council has warned that particularly big price
increases may come in the near future in the steel
and health industries.
The Senate has scheduled a vote today on a
last-minute proposal to give the President authority
to impose controls on a selected basis for one more
year.
Its passage is doubtful. The administration
opposes it. House Speaker Carl Albert said yesterday
that the Democratic leadership in the Congress
"cannot at this time recommend further
continuation" of controls.
Marijuana Bill Clears Committee
SACRAMENTO — Legislation easing penalties
for marijuana possession cleared its last committee
hurdle yesterday and headed for the Senate floor.
The measure by Assemblyman Alan Sieroty,
D—Beverly Hills, was apporved 7-3 by the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
It would reduce the penalty for street possession
of two ounces or less of marijuana to a maximum
six months in jail and a $500 fine for first offenders.
The measure would provide the same penalities
