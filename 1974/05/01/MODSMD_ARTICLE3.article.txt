# Ed School Ranks Top Of Class

### BOB LOWE (First of Two Parts)

In surveys that attempt to
establish pecking orders for
professional schools, the Stanford
School of Education is always near
the top. Last year, a poll of deans
of education across the nation rated
Stanford as the best — no other
school came close.
The main reason for Stanford's
eminence in the field of
education is the school's emphasis
on research and development. While
most other schools of education
concentrate on training
administrators, Stanford tackles
more theoretical problems.
The School of Education hasn't
always been research oriented. In
the last 20 years the school has
shifted away from administrative
training and toward more
theoretical study.
During that time, the faculty
under went a massive facelift.
Instead of professors who specialize
exclusively in education, the
present faculty is mainly composed
of professors who are experts in both

education and some other
discipline, such as sociology,
linguistics or business.
Diversity
Arthur Coladarci, dean of
education, said this diversity is "our
strength." He added that "half of
our faculty hold degrees in relevant
social sciences" and estimated that
30 of the 40 faculty members have
"formal relations with other
departments."
The graduate students also
reflect and maintain the school's
research orientation.
Approximately 300 are in the
doctoral program at the School of
Education. Many are former
teachers and administrators.
The School of Education seeks
graduates who are research minded
and think conceptually, rather than
purely mechanically. As a result,
the graduates do much of the
research work and initiate their
own programs.
Only 20 percent of the doctoral
students are in the School of
Education's Administrative and
Organizational Studies program,

which emphasizes administrative
training.
Examination
"Most other schools of
education focus on training
practitioners of education. Stanford
doesn't," Coladarci said. He added
that the administrators Stanford
does train will be influenced by the
school's direction. 'They will be
superintendents who will examine
their own rules and behavior," he
said.
The Stanford Center for
Research and Development in
Teaching (SCRDT) brings together
the faculty of the School of
Education and professors from
other departments in the
University. Part of the School of
Education, SCRDT houses most of
the local research and
experimentation in education and is
a major reason for Stanford's high
reputation in the field of education.
Prof. Robert Bush, SCRDT
Director, said that SCRDT is one of
20 remaining education research
and development centers which were
funded by the federal government
in the early 19605.
Different centers study various
areas in education. SCRDT focuses
on improving teaching, mainly in
elementary and secondary schools.
The building which houses
SCRDT was completed in 1972 and
is both a monument to and a tool
for the education research which
goes on at Stanford. A $4 million
federal grant paid for the
modern-looking building which
holds classrooms with adjustable
walls and a television studio, among
other facilities.
Prof. Elizabeth Cohen heads the
Environment of Teaching program,
one of several SCRDT projects. She
said that the SCRDT building
encourages experimentation. "We
cook things up with the facility
egging us on," she said.
The Environment of Teaching
program examines "relationships
between schools' organization and
the kinds of teaching" that take
place, according to Cohen.
This particular project found that
"open space classrooms" make a
tremendous difference in teaching,
she said.
Open space classrooms involve
one large room divided by movable
partitions into smaller areas or
offices. They give the sensation of
being in a large place with many
people , rather than in a small,
isolated room. Offices and rooms
can be altered to a desired shape
and size.
Originally designed by many
school districts to cut down on
cost, open space classrooms allow
more flexibility in class groupings
and teaching methods, Stanford
researchers have found.

This particular project found that
"open space classrooms" make a
tremendous difference in teaching,
she said.
Open space classrooms involve
one large room divided by movable
partitions into smaller areas or
offices. They give the sensation of
being in a large place with many
people , rather than in a small,
isolated room. Offices and rooms
can be altered to a desired shape
and size.
Originally designed by many
school districts to cut down on
cost, open space classrooms allow

and teaching methods, Stanford
researchers have found.

In surveys that attempt to
establish pecking orders for
professional schools, the Stanford
School of Education is always near
the top. Last year, a poll of deans
of education across the nation rated
Stanford as the best — no other
school came close.
The main reason for Stanford's
eminence in the field of
education is the school's emphasis
on research and development. While
most other schools of education
concentrate on training
administrators, Stanford tackles
more theoretical problems.
The School of Education hasn't
always been research oriented. In
the last 20 years the school has
shifted away from administrative
training and toward more
theoretical study.
During that time, the faculty
under went a massive facelift.
Instead of professors who specialize
exclusively in education, the
present faculty is mainly composed
of professors who are experts in both

education and some other
discipline, such as sociology,
linguistics or business.
Diversity
Arthur Coladarci, dean of
education, said this diversity is "our
strength." He added that "half of
our faculty hold degrees in relevant
social sciences" and estimated that
30 of the 40 faculty members have
"formal relations with other
departments."
The graduate students also
reflect and maintain the school's
research orientation.
Approximately 300 are in the
doctoral program at the School of
Education. Many are former
teachers and administrators.
The School of Education seeks
graduates who are research minded
and think conceptually, rather than
purely mechanically. As a result,
the graduates do much of the
research work and initiate their
own programs.
Only 20 percent of the doctoral
students are in the School of
Education's Administrative and
Organizational Studies program,

which emphasizes administrative
training.
Examination
"Most other schools of
education focus on training
practitioners of education. Stanford
doesn't," Coladarci said. He added
that the administrators Stanford
does train will be influenced by the
school's direction. 'They will be
superintendents who will examine
their own rules and behavior," he
said.
The Stanford Center for
Research and Development in
Teaching (SCRDT) brings together
the faculty of the School of
Education and professors from
other departments in the
University. Part of the School of
Education, SCRDT houses most of
the local research and
experimentation in education and is
a major reason for Stanford's high
reputation in the field of education.
Prof. Robert Bush, SCRDT
Director, said that SCRDT is one of
20 remaining education research
and development centers which were
funded by the federal government
in the early 19605.
Different centers study various
areas in education. SCRDT focuses
on improving teaching, mainly in
elementary and secondary schools.
The building which houses
SCRDT was completed in 1972 and
is both a monument to and a tool
for the education research which
goes on at Stanford. A $4 million
federal grant paid for the
modern-looking building which
holds classrooms with adjustable
walls and a television studio, among
other facilities.
Prof. Elizabeth Cohen heads the
Environment of Teaching program,
one of several SCRDT projects. She
said that the SCRDT building
encourages experimentation. "We
cook things up with the facility
egging us on," she said.
The Environment of Teaching
program examines "relationships
between schools' organization and
the kinds of teaching" that take
place, according to Cohen.
