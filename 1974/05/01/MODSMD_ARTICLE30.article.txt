# Goldie's Death Seen As Possible Suicide
## 
### 
The 1971 death of former campus
activist Barbara Ann (Nan) Goldie
appears to have been a suicide,
Stevens County Sheriff Chan St. Clair
said Monday from Colville, Wash.
St. Clair said deputies were
completing contacts with members of
a party Goldie was traveling with when
she disappeared in November 1971.
"It's beginning to sound like a
suicide," St. Clair said, but cautioned
that "we're not saying definitely that
foul play was not involved."
Scattered human bones found in
northeastern Washington last August
were identified in March as Goldie's.
According to reports, Goldie,
Kristin Dana Hind — a friend of Goldie

and daughter of a former University
administrator—and former Stanford
Medical Center biophysicist Earl
Edwin Jacobs were among residents of
a British Columbia commune. The
three, plus two other commune
residents who have not been located,
were en route back to the Bay Area
when they stopped at a Spokane
motel.
Jacobs died that night of an
overdose of sleeping pills. Hind has not
been heard from since, except for a
Nov. 4, 1972 phone call to a relative.
Goldie, a one-time debutante and
daughter of a prominent San Francisco
family, was registered intermittently
here from 1965 through 1969. She
never graduated.
