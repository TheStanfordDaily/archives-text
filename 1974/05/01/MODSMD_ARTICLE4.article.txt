# Watergate Transcripts Raise Further Questions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Richard Nixon's edited Watergate
transcripts were issued yesterday as he
sought to prove his innocence with an
extraordinary journal recounting his
conversations about possible payoffs,
his rejection of clemency and his
strategy for handling the emerging
scandal.
At one point 13 months ago, he
said he could weather adverse
Watergate publicity but was concerned
that his aides would be branded
criminals "if we had to let the whole
damn thing hang out."
As Nixon and his lawyers had said
in advance, the transcripts are often
ambiguous, answering some questions
but raising others about the intent of
the President and his men.
One crucial phase is the transcript
of White House discussions on March
21, 1973 — the day on which Nixon
said he first learned of the Watergate
cover-up.
Nixon-Dean Conversation
It recounts a conference between
Nixon and John W. Dean 111, then his
White House counsel, now his chief
accuser. And in it, Nixon repeatedly
expresses surprise at Dean's disclosures
of high-level official involvement in
the Watergate case.
That portion of the transcript
includes a key, and contested,
discussion of payoffs for the silence of
Watergate defendants, and of possible
executive clemency — which Nixon
ruled out.
The transcript does not include a
clear Nixon rejection of payoffs, and
at one point includes an exchange
about the payoff demands of
Watergate conspirator E. Howard
Hunt.
It begins with Dean's suggestion
that the Watergate defendants other
than Hunt are likely to remain silent
about the involvement of others.
'Stonewall'
Dean: "They're going to stonewall
it, as it now stands. Excepting Hunt.
That's why his threat."
H.R. Haldeman, then Nixon's top
aide: "It's Hunt's opportunity."
Nixon: "That's why for your
immediate things you have no choice
but to come up with the $120,000, or
whatever it is. Right?"
Dean: "That's right."
Nixon: "Would you agree that
that's the prime thing that you damn
well better get that done?"
Dean: "Obviously he ought to be
given some signal anyway."
Nixon: "[Expletive deleted] get it.
In a way that — who is going to talk to
him? Charles W. Colson? He is the one
who is supposed to know him."
Rejected
The White House said that Nixon
discussed a number of different
possibilities for handling the Watergate
situation, but that he rejected the
payment of $120,000 to Hunt or any
other sum to Hunt or other Watergate
defendants.
At another point in the same
conversation, the transcript records
Nixon's rejection of clemency for
Watergate defendants:
Dean: "I am not sure that you will
ever be able to deliver on the
clemency. It may be just too hot."
Nixon: "You can't do it politically
until after the '74 elections, that's for
sure. Your point is that even then you

couldn't do it."
Dean: "That's right. It may further
involve you in a way you should not
be involved in this."
Delivery
The White House delivered the
transcripts to Congress — specifically,
to the House Judiciary Committee for
its inquiry into the possible
impeachment of the President. With
them went a summation that
pronounced them proof of his
innocence.
Then the entire package was made
public by the White House.
There was immediate controversy
as to whether the expurgated
documents were a satisfactory

response to the committee's subpoena
for tape recordings of 42 White House
conversations.
Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J.,
the committee chairman, said he was
disappointed. In an interview with
CBS News, Rodino said the material
the committee requested "has not
been forthcoming."
The full, 38-member panel was to
decide tonight whether the President's
terms were acceptable. At least nine
members termed the transcripts
inadequate.
Innocence
Nixon's lawyers said the raw
materials of those recorded
conversations, 1308 pages bound in
blue, established that he did not know
in advance of the Watergate break-in,
and did not learn of the cover-up until
March 21,1973.
The transcript shows that the
President concluded one crucial White
House meeting on that date by saying
that erosion among those who knew
the Watergate story would lead to its
disclosure, that it was bound to
become a major issue, and that:
"Delaying is the great danger to the
White House area. We don't, I say that
the White House can't do it."
Nixon's terms included an offer to
let the committee chairman and top
Republican listen to the tapes to verify
the transcripts.

The White House said that Nixon
discussed a number of different
possibilities for handling the Watergate
situation, but that he rejected the
payment of $120,000 to Hunt or any
other sum to Hunt or other Watergate
defendants.
At another point in the same
conversation, the transcript records
Nixon's rejection of clemency for
Watergate defendants:
Dean: "I am not sure that you will
ever be able to deliver on the
clemency. It may be just too hot."
Nixon: "You can't do it politically
until after the '74 elections, that's for
sure. Your point is that even then you

couldn't do it."
Dean: "That's right. It may further
involve you in a way you should not
be involved in this."
Delivery
The White House delivered the
transcripts to Congress — specifically,
to the House Judiciary Committee for
its inquiry into the possible
impeachment of the President. With
them went a summation that
pronounced them proof of his
innocence.
Then the entire package was made
public by the White House.
There was immediate controversy
as to whether the expurgated
documents were a satisfactory

response to the committee's subpoena
for tape recordings of 42 White House
conversations.
Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J.,
the committee chairman, said he was
disappointed. In an interview with
CBS News, Rodino said the material
the committee requested "has not
been forthcoming."
The full, 38-member panel was to
decide tonight whether the President's
terms were acceptable. At least nine
members termed the transcripts
inadequate.
Innocence
Nixon's lawyers said the raw
materials of those recorded
conversations, 1308 pages bound in
blue, established that he did not know
in advance of the Watergate break-in,
and did not learn of the cover-up until
March 21,1973.
The transcript shows that the
President concluded one crucial White
House meeting on that date by saying
that erosion among those who knew
the Watergate story would lead to its
disclosure, that it was bound to
become a major issue, and that:
"Delaying is the great danger to the
White House area. We don't, I say that
the White House can't do it."
Nixon's terms included an offer to
let the committee chairman and top
Republican listen to the tapes to verify
the transcripts.
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Richard Nixon's edited Watergate
transcripts were issued yesterday as he
sought to prove his innocence with an
extraordinary journal recounting his
conversations about possible payoffs,
his rejection of clemency and his
strategy for handling the emerging
scandal.
At one point 13 months ago, he
said he could weather adverse
Watergate publicity but was concerned
that his aides would be branded
criminals "if we had to let the whole
damn thing hang out."
As Nixon and his lawyers had said
in advance, the transcripts are often
ambiguous, answering some questions
but raising others about the intent of
the President and his men.
One crucial phase is the transcript
of White House discussions on March
21, 1973 — the day on which Nixon
said he first learned of the Watergate
cover-up.
Nixon-Dean Conversation
It recounts a conference between
Nixon and John W. Dean 111, then his
White House counsel, now his chief
accuser. And in it, Nixon repeatedly
expresses surprise at Dean's disclosures
of high-level official involvement in
the Watergate case.
That portion of the transcript
includes a key, and contested,
discussion of payoffs for the silence of
Watergate defendants, and of possible
executive clemency — which Nixon
ruled out.
The transcript does not include a
clear Nixon rejection of payoffs, and
at one point includes an exchange
about the payoff demands of
Watergate conspirator E. Howard
Hunt.
It begins with Dean's suggestion
that the Watergate defendants other
than Hunt are likely to remain silent
about the involvement of others.
'Stonewall'
Dean: "They're going to stonewall
it, as it now stands. Excepting Hunt.
That's why his threat."
H.R. Haldeman, then Nixon's top
aide: "It's Hunt's opportunity."
Nixon: "That's why for your
immediate things you have no choice
but to come up with the $120,000, or
whatever it is. Right?"
Dean: "That's right."
Nixon: "Would you agree that
that's the prime thing that you damn
well better get that done?"
Dean: "Obviously he ought to be
given some signal anyway."
Nixon: "[Expletive deleted] get it.
In a way that — who is going to talk to
him? Charles W. Colson? He is the one
who is supposed to know him."
Rejected

discussed a number of different

transcripts were issued yesterday as he
sought to prove his innocence with an
extraordinary journal recounting his
conversations about possible payoffs,
his rejection of clemency and his
strategy for handling the emerging
scandal.
At one point 13 months ago, he
said he could weather adverse
Watergate publicity but was concerned
that his aides would be branded
criminals "if we had to let the whole
damn thing hang out."
As Nixon and his lawyers had said
in advance, the transcripts are often
ambiguous, answering some questions
but raising others about the intent of
the President and his men.
One crucial phase is the transcript
of White House discussions on March
21, 1973 — the day on which Nixon
said he first learned of the Watergate
cover-up.
Nixon-Dean Conversation
It recounts a conference between
Nixon and John W. Dean 111, then his
White House counsel, now his chief
accuser. And in it, Nixon repeatedly
expresses surprise at Dean's disclosures
of high-level official involvement in
the Watergate case.
That portion of the transcript
includes a key, and contested,
discussion of payoffs for the silence of
Watergate defendants, and of possible
executive clemency — which Nixon
ruled out.
The transcript does not include a
clear Nixon rejection of payoffs, and
at one point includes an exchange
about the payoff demands of
Watergate conspirator E. Howard
Hunt.
It begins with Dean's suggestion
that the Watergate defendants other
than Hunt are likely to remain silent
about the involvement of others.
'Stonewall'
Dean: "They're going to stonewall
it, as it now stands. Excepting Hunt.
That's why his threat."
H.R. Haldeman, then Nixon's top
aide: "It's Hunt's opportunity."
Nixon: "That's why for your
immediate things you have no choice
but to come up with the $120,000, or
whatever it is. Right?"
Dean: "That's right."
Nixon: "Would you agree that
that's the prime thing that you damn
well better get that done?"
Dean: "Obviously he ought to be
given some signal anyway."
Nixon: "[Expletive deleted] get it.
In a way that — who is going to talk to
him? Charles W. Colson? He is the one
who is supposed to know him."
Rejected
The White House said that Nixon
discussed a number of different
possibilities for handling the Watergate
situation, but that he rejected the
payment of $120,000 to Hunt or any
other sum to Hunt or other Watergate
defendants.
At another point in the same
conversation, the transcript records
Nixon's rejection of clemency for
Watergate defendants:
Dean: "I am not sure that you will
ever be able to deliver on the
clemency. It may be just too hot."
Nixon: "You can't do it politically
until after the '74 elections, that's for
sure. Your point is that even then you

couldn't do it."
Dean: "That's right. It may further
involve you in a way you should not
be involved in this."
Delivery
The White House delivered the
transcripts to Congress — specifically,
to the House Judiciary Committee for
its inquiry into the possible
impeachment of the President. With
them went a summation that
pronounced them proof of his
innocence.
Then the entire package was made
public by the White House.
There was immediate controversy
as to whether the expurgated
documents were a satisfactory

response to the committee's subpoena
for tape recordings of 42 White House
conversations.
Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J.,
the committee chairman, said he was
disappointed. In an interview with
CBS News, Rodino said the material
the committee requested "has not
been forthcoming."
The full, 38-member panel was to
decide tonight whether the President's
terms were acceptable. At least nine
members termed the transcripts
inadequate.
Innocence
Nixon's lawyers said the raw
materials of those recorded
conversations, 1308 pages bound in
blue, established that he did not know
in advance of the Watergate break-in,
and did not learn of the cover-up until
March 21,1973.
The transcript shows that the
President concluded one crucial White
House meeting on that date by saying
that erosion among those who knew
the Watergate story would lead to its
disclosure, that it was bound to
become a major issue, and that:
"Delaying is the great danger to the
White House area. We don't, I say that
the White House can't do it."
Nixon's terms included an offer to
let the committee chairman and top
Republican listen to the tapes to verify
the transcripts.
