# University To Retain Terrace Restrictions
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Stanford does not plan to increase
the number of low-income units in the
proposed Frenchman's Terrace
housing complex despite the
objections of some governmental
authorities, according to Robert
Augsburger, vice president for business
and finance.
Augsburger told the Daily that the
University plans to retain the plan
allocating 40 percent of the units to
market-priced housing, 40 percent to
moderate income federally subsidized
housing and 20 percent to low income
housing.
Frenchman's Terrace, a proposed
225-unit complex designed to
ameliorate the housing shortage among
University employees, would be built
on Stanford land but would be

managed by the Urban Coalition and
financed by federal funds.
James Price, the director of the
western regional office of the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development, has expressed objections
to the income bracket allocations.
A spokesman for his office told the
Daily yesterday that he will probably
recommend to the national office that
the project not be built if the
restrictions aren't revised.
Legal
According to Dirk Murphy, special
assistant to Price, there is no question
about the legality of the project under
the provisions of National Housing Act
of 1965.
But the western regional office does
not believe an allocation of 40 percent
of the units to market-priced housing
would be in keeping with the spirit of
the law, which was designed to aid
people with low incomes, Murphy
declared.
Murphy explained that the western
regional office favors allowing 20
percent of the units to be set aside for
market-priced units in order to prevent
the project from becoming a ghetto.
But Augsburger indicated fears that
middle income groups would shun the
project unless 40 percent of the units
were devoted to market-priced
housing.
Housing Scarce
Furthermore, Augsburger declared
that housing is so scarce for University
employees that even people with
incomes of $18,000 find it difficult to
obtain housing. He insisted the project
should serve them, too.
Augsburger noted that the
University's Land and Building
Committee recommended 40 percent
of the units be priced at market values.
The Board of Trustees approved the
plan and hence the University is
committed to the plan.
But a spokesman for the western
regional office of HUD said flatly, "we
won't recommend that the project be
built if 40 percent of the units are
going to be allotted to market-priced
units."
Murphy said, however, that he is
hopeful of negotiating some sort of an
agreement with Stanford. "The
University has not been inflexible at
all," Murphy said. "It has made every
effort to cooperate and we will try to
accommodate its wishes as much as
possible."
Compromise?
Murphy said the 40 percent of units
allocated to market-priced housing
could be removed from federal
support altogether, while HUD
finances the 60 percent of the units
that would be allotted to low and
moderate income units.
But Augsburger said that the
University could not afford to finance
the market-priced units without
federal support. He claimed, though,
that the University is currently trying
to work out some sort of an agreement
with HUD.
If the western regional office of
HUD refuses to recommend that the
Frenchman's Terrace project be
approved, the Urban Coalition might
appeal the matter to the national
office of HUD, according to
Augsburger.
The University originally intended
to allocate 50 percent of the units to
Stanford employees, 25 percent to
employees of companies located on
Stanford land, and 25 percent to
members of the general community.
After Price objected to the
restrictions, the University agreed to
conside; placing restrictions on no
more than 50 percent of the units,
according to Murphy.

market-priced units in order to prevent
the project from becoming a ghetto.
But Augsburger indicated fears that
middle income groups would shun the
project unless 40 percent of the units
were devoted to market-priced
housing.
Housing Scarce
Furthermore, Augsburger declared
that housing is so scarce for University
employees that even people with
incomes of $18,000 find it difficult to
obtain housing. He insisted the project
should serve them, too.
Augsburger noted that the
University's Land and Building
Committee recommended 40 percent
of the units be priced at market values.
The Board of Trustees approved the
plan and hence the University is
committed to the plan.
But a spokesman for the western
regional office of HUD said flatly, "we
won't recommend that the project be
built if 40 percent of the units are
going to be allotted to market-priced
units."
Murphy said, however, that he is
hopeful of negotiating some sort of an
agreement with Stanford. "The
University has not been inflexible at
all," Murphy said. "It has made every
effort to cooperate and we will try to
accommodate its wishes as much as
possible."
Compromise?
Murphy said the 40 percent of units
allocated to market-priced housing
could be removed from federal
support altogether, while HUD
finances the 60 percent of the units
that would be allotted to low and
moderate income units.
But Augsburger said that the
University could not afford to finance
the market-priced units without
federal support. He claimed, though,
that the University is currently trying
to work out some sort of an agreement
with HUD.
If the western regional office of
HUD refuses to recommend that the
Frenchman's Terrace project be
approved, the Urban Coalition might
appeal the matter to the national
office of HUD, according to
Augsburger.
The University originally intended
to allocate 50 percent of the units to
Stanford employees, 25 percent to
employees of companies located on
Stanford land, and 25 percent to
members of the general community.
After Price objected to the
restrictions, the University agreed to
conside; placing restrictions on no
more than 50 percent of the units,
according to Murphy.
Stanford does not plan to increase
the number of low-income units in the
proposed Frenchman's Terrace
housing complex despite the
objections of some governmental
authorities, according to Robert
Augsburger, vice president for business
and finance.
Augsburger told the Daily that the
University plans to retain the plan
allocating 40 percent of the units to
market-priced housing, 40 percent to
moderate income federally subsidized
housing and 20 percent to low income
housing.
Frenchman's Terrace, a proposed
225-unit complex designed to
ameliorate the housing shortage among
University employees, would be built
on Stanford land but would be

managed by the Urban Coalition and
financed by federal funds.
James Price, the director of the
western regional office of the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development, has expressed objections
to the income bracket allocations.
A spokesman for his office told the
Daily yesterday that he will probably
recommend to the national office that
the project not be built if the
restrictions aren't revised.
Legal
According to Dirk Murphy, special
assistant to Price, there is no question
about the legality of the project under
the provisions of National Housing Act
of 1965.
But the western regional office does
not believe an allocation of 40 percent
of the units to market-priced housing
would be in keeping with the spirit of
the law, which was designed to aid
people with low incomes, Murphy
declared.
Murphy explained that the western
regional office favors allowing 20
percent of the units to be set aside for
market-priced units in order to prevent
the project from becoming a ghetto.
But Augsburger indicated fears that
middle income groups would shun the
project unless 40 percent of the units
were devoted to market-priced
housing.
