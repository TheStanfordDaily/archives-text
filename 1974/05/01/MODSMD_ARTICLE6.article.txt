# Senior Class Officer Vote Starts Today
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Juniors will vote today and
tomorrow in a runoff election between
two slates of candidates for senior
class officers.
The Post Office polling place will
be open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on
both days for juniors choosing
between the slates, one including Lise
Pfeiffer, Jim Dewell and Susie
Schatzman; the other, David
Antonuccio, Karen Chang, Rich
Gonzales and Dan Spikes.
Both Antonuccio and Pfeiffer
downplayed the importance of the
election.
"It's a relatively minor office,
compared to the ASSU elections,"
Antonuccio remarked. "I think maybe
the campaigning is overdone by both
sides."
"It's really low-keyed — people
don't care," Pfeiffer said.
Slates are not constitutionally
required to put up four candidates.
Thus, Pfeiffer has two running mates
while Antonuccio has three. Pfeiffer
said that three persons could handle
the duties of senior class officers as
well as four could.
"We're going to be delegating
responsibility. It's not just the three of
us — there are 1500 seniors," Pfeiffer
noted.
The two platforms coincided on
many points, including proposals for
improved alumni-senior relations, a
senior class dance, and trips for
seniors.
Antonuccio explained his running
mates' philosophy.
"We ali have a lot of energy, we are
very serious about this, and will work
hard. .. . Stanford has been a fun
place for most people, and your last
year should be the one you remember
the most," Antonuccio stated.
"We know each other very well. We
all have different majors. ... Perhaps
we represent a wider variety of the
class," he added.
Pfeiffer said her slate would like to
refocus attention on seniors.
"When you arrive as a freshman,
you get all this attention. .. . We'd like
to bring back to the seniors the kind
of attention they got when they were
freshmen," Pfeiffer said.
"Debbie Stinchfield [a current
officer], said to me, 'Would you like
us to endorse you?' They know the
other [slate's candidates], so it's not
like obvious favoritism," Pfeiffer
concluded.
