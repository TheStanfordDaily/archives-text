## Open Discussion 
### 
Since the University is by its nature intended as a forum
for free and open discussion of issues and ideas, we find it
antithetical that the Faculty Senate continues to
operate under rules and procedures seemingly designed for
no purpose other than to restrict the free flow of
information.
We object particularly to the use of the "Committee of
the Whole" during debate and discussion. Under this
procedure, reporters are not allowed to quote —or even to
attribute general comments to — Senate members without
their consent, and are not allowed to report the actual vote
totals on issues considered.
We realize that the Faculty Senate has become more
"open" now that it once was—chiefly through the prompting of
University News Service Director Robert Beyers.
Nonetheless, this does not excuse the fact that the Senate
still maintains rules which are at best outdated and at worst
actively detrimental to the free flow of information.
The entire University community—and particularly the
faculty—has a right to know the contents of Senate debates
and the stands taken by Senate members. We particularly
wonder how faculty members can make informed choices at
election time when Senate members can conceal their
comments during debates.
These restrictions do not just affect the Daily. KZSU, the
News Service—all are similarly bound by these restrictions
on the press. In short, the Senate continues to manipulate
the information made available to the public. And in a body
dedicated to the cause of academic freedom, we find that
not only peculiar, but downright contradictory. A change is
long overdue.
