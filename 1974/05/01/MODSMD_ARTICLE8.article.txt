# On RA-TA Union
## 
### 
Daniels, Chase-Dunn

The efforts of graduate students to organize themselves collectively
to deal with the University must be understood in the context of the
current economic squeeze which has affected many aspects of
academic life.
The University is tightening up its expenditures in the face of rising
costs. This austerity program has resulted in the scarcity of materials
and resources felt in most departments. The university is best able to
put the squeeze on those groups least able to resist — the powerless.
Thus graduate students have faced speed-ups in the form of the
restriction of financing beyond the fourth year of graduate school,
and salaries frozen at the 1968 level, and thus declining in real terms.
The University encourages graduate students to get through
quickly, to borrow money if they cannot live on their meager wages,
and forcefully opposes the attempts of graduate students to organize
themselves into a collective bargaining unit.
University To Gain?
The University stands to gain much from the suffering of its
supporting community of grad-students' families. Artificially depressed
wages serve to homogenize the people who would attend grad school.
Thus we get a preponderance of white, male students who come from
relatively well-to-do families. They are the only ones that can afford
the opportunity costs of a Stanford education, and can manage to live
on the going wage by borrowing money or receiving gifts from their
families.
For the rest of the population, either their families are too poor, or
have set priorities that give preference to funding the education of
their sons. Until a living wage is instituted that will open up grad
education, by making it financially feasible for all, affirmative action
is a joke at best.
Those of us concerned not only with having enough to eat, but
with the process of graduate education and its consequences should
ask what other effects this squeeze will have.
Time Limited
For one thing, it will be very difficult for graduate students to do
work which is unorthodox, and which therefore requires additional
time and effort. Furthermore, the $10,000 loan ceiling suggested by
Dean Moses serves to hinder free choice of occupation once the
student has graduated. Those of us interested in community work or
less lucrative jobs are forced to reconsider due to the burden of these
loans.
For those families with children, Stanford's miserly T.A. and R.A.
wages make it necessary for the non-student spouse to work; in the
majority of cases this is the woman, who effectively is prohibited by
the pressing financial situation from continuing her education.
Working wives provide Stanford with a tremendous trained labor
pool, and suffer as a consequence in two ways— by being forced by
the University into working at jobs not reflecting the value of their
BA's and MA's; and by taking low wages for their work since the sheer
size of their numbers allows the University its exploitive priviliges.
Stanford's pay policy also spills over into the surrounding
community where wages for non-university affiliated workers are
depressed artificially. Have no pretense that this is a free market. The
TA-RA Union (STREU) is working to better the lot of our entire
community, by recognizing that it is the University administration
that is our oppressor, and not our individual departments. Sua Culpa,
sua culpa . . .

supporting community of grad-students' families. Artificially depressed
wages serve to homogenize the people who would attend grad school.
Thus we get a preponderance of white, male students who come from
relatively well-to-do families. They are the only ones that can afford
the opportunity costs of a Stanford education, and can manage to live
on the going wage by borrowing money or receiving gifts from their
families.
For the rest of the population, either their families are too poor, or
have set priorities that give preference to funding the education of
their sons. Until a living wage is instituted that will open up grad
education, by making it financially feasible for all, affirmative action
is a joke at best.
Those of us concerned not only with having enough to eat, but
with the process of graduate education and its consequences should
ask what other effects this squeeze will have.
Time Limited
For one thing, it will be very difficult for graduate students to do
work which is unorthodox, and which therefore requires additional
time and effort. Furthermore, the $10,000 loan ceiling suggested by
Dean Moses serves to hinder free choice of occupation once the
student has graduated. Those of us interested in community work or
less lucrative jobs are forced to reconsider due to the burden of these
loans.
For those families with children, Stanford's miserly T.A. and R.A.
wages make it necessary for the non-student spouse to work; in the
majority of cases this is the woman, who effectively is prohibited by
the pressing financial situation from continuing her education.
Working wives provide Stanford with a tremendous trained labor
pool, and suffer as a consequence in two ways— by being forced by
the University into working at jobs not reflecting the value of their
BA's and MA's; and by taking low wages for their work since the sheer
size of their numbers allows the University its exploitive priviliges.
Stanford's pay policy also spills over into the surrounding
community where wages for non-university affiliated workers are
depressed artificially. Have no pretense that this is a free market. The
TA-RA Union (STREU) is working to better the lot of our entire
community, by recognizing that it is the University administration
that is our oppressor, and not our individual departments. Sua Culpa,
sua culpa . . .

Daniels, Chase-Dunn

The efforts of graduate students to organize themselves collectively
to deal with the University must be understood in the context of the
current economic squeeze which has affected many aspects of
academic life.
The University is tightening up its expenditures in the face of rising
costs. This austerity program has resulted in the scarcity of materials
and resources felt in most departments. The university is best able to
put the squeeze on those groups least able to resist — the powerless.
Thus graduate students have faced speed-ups in the form of the
restriction of financing beyond the fourth year of graduate school,
and salaries frozen at the 1968 level, and thus declining in real terms.
The University encourages graduate students to get through
quickly, to borrow money if they cannot live on their meager wages,
and forcefully opposes the attempts of graduate students to organize
themselves into a collective bargaining unit.
University To Gain?
The University stands to gain much from the suffering of its
supporting community of grad-students' families. Artificially depressed
wages serve to homogenize the people who would attend grad school.
