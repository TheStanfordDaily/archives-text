# Alioto Links Levine, Zebra Killings
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
David Levine — the 20-year old
Stanford student murdered on campus
last September — may have been a
victim of the "Death Angels," the
organization allegedly responsible for
the so-called Zebra killings.
San Francisco Mayor Joseph
A/loto, announcing the arrest of seven
men in connection with the killings,
said Levine's murder was one of 73
"murderous assaults" in the state that
might be laid to the reputed black
separatist sect.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
L . tective Capt. Frank Mosunic told
the Daily yesterday that "what we
have would coincide with what San
Francisco has released to the media."
Mosunic said that there is a "very
strong possibility that two blacks were
involved in the murder," and that "we
w 11 be in touch with San Francisco

tonight, and some people from
Alameda."
Police had speculated that the Sept.
11 Levine murder might be connected
with the Dec. 20 slaying of a
UC-Berkeley graduate student. Both
victims were brutally and repeatedly
stabbed in the chest and back. The
Berkeley murder was also on Alioto's
list.
No Comment
Mosunic declined any further
comment on the matter. A Berkeley
Police Department spokesman flatly
refused to comment on the reports.
Police Services Director Marvin
Herrington was out of town and
unavailable for comment, and
Stanford Capt. William Wullschleger
referred all inquiries to Mosunic.
Levine, a physics major from
Ithaca. N.Y., was slain sometime
between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. on Sept.

11. His body was discovered on a
walkway near Meyer Library by an
early-morning jogger.
He had been active in student
government here, and had been an
ASSU senator.
(The Daily has learned that local
law enforcement authorities do not
feel that two other recent unsolved
campus murders — those of Leslie
Marie Perlov, 21, and Janet Taylor, 20
— are related to the Zebra
investigation. Both women were
strangled.)
'Reverse KKK'
At a press conference yesterday,
Alioto said that the seven Zebra
suspects — arrested by police in a
series of raids beginning at 5 a.m.
yesterday morning — were members of
a nationwide group he described as "a
reverse Ku Klux Klan."
"The 'Death Angels,' who use wings

as an insignia, literally earn their
promotion upon presentation of proof
of the number and nature of the
murders committed," Alioto alleged,
"The local group is a division of a
larger organization dedicated to the
murder and mutilation of whites and
dissident blacks," Alioto claimed.
"The pattern of killing is by random
street shooting or hacking to death
with machete, cleaver or knife."
The seven suspects arrested
yesterday were identified as J.C.
Simon, 29; Larry Greene, 22; Dwight
Stallings, 28; Tom Manney, 31; Edgar
D. Burton, 22; Manuel Moore, 23; and
Clarence Jamerson, 29. No further
personal information was released.
Booked
All the suspects were booked on
charges of murder or conspiracy to
commit murder. Police said fhe men
would be arraigned today.
According to Alioto, the "Death
Angels" are "fanatical believers in
black separatism" who base their
philosophy on "muddled aberrations
clearly outside the mainstream of
Islamic religions. In my opinion, it
represents as much potential threat to
blacks as to whites."
Promotions in the alleged
organization are determined by a
national leader located outside of
California, Alioto said.
Continue
"The investigation will continue
until we are satisfied that we have
rounded up all the members of this
group and have insured the fact that
new members will not take their
place," he said.
State Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger
said at a news conference he has "no
clear evidence" linking the Zebra
killings to any others outside the Bay
Area, but conceded that his office had
not yet viewed all evidence used by
San Francisco police.
He noted that it was not improper
to say that there were similarities
between the Zebra killings and a
number of others in the state since
1971.
The Zebra case was apparently
broken with the aid of an informant
who had witnessed some of the
killings.

VJRDER CONNECTIONS — The murder of Stanford junior David Levine last
September may have been one of 73 committed in the state by the "Death
Angels," allegedly responsible for the Zebra killings.
David Levine — the 20-year old
Stanford student murdered on campus
last September — may have been a
victim of the "Death Angels," the
organization allegedly responsible for
the so-called Zebra killings.
San Francisco Mayor Joseph
A/loto, announcing the arrest of seven
men in connection with the killings,
said Levine's murder was one of 73
"murderous assaults" in the state that
might be laid to the reputed black
separatist sect.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
L . tective Capt. Frank Mosunic told
the Daily yesterday that "what we
have would coincide with what San
Francisco has released to the media."
Mosunic said that there is a "very
strong possibility that two blacks were
involved in the murder," and that "we
w 11 be in touch with San Francisco

tonight, and some people from
Alameda."
Police had speculated that the Sept.
11 Levine murder might be connected
with the Dec. 20 slaying of a
UC-Berkeley graduate student. Both
victims were brutally and repeatedly
stabbed in the chest and back. The
Berkeley murder was also on Alioto's
list.
No Comment
Mosunic declined any further
comment on the matter. A Berkeley
Police Department spokesman flatly
refused to comment on the reports.
Police Services Director Marvin
Herrington was out of town and
unavailable for comment, and
Stanford Capt. William Wullschleger
referred all inquiries to Mosunic.
Levine, a physics major from
Ithaca. N.Y., was slain sometime
between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. on Sept.

11. His body was discovered on a
walkway near Meyer Library by an
early-morning jogger.
He had been active in student
government here, and had been an
ASSU senator.
(The Daily has learned that local
law enforcement authorities do not
feel that two other recent unsolved
campus murders — those of Leslie
Marie Perlov, 21, and Janet Taylor, 20
— are related to the Zebra
investigation. Both women were
strangled.)
'Reverse KKK'
At a press conference yesterday,
Alioto said that the seven Zebra
suspects — arrested by police in a
series of raids beginning at 5 a.m.
yesterday morning — were members of
a nationwide group he described as "a
reverse Ku Klux Klan."
"The 'Death Angels,' who use wings

as an insignia, literally earn their
promotion upon presentation of proof
of the number and nature of the
murders committed," Alioto alleged,
"The local group is a division of a
larger organization dedicated to the
murder and mutilation of whites and
dissident blacks," Alioto claimed.
"The pattern of killing is by random
street shooting or hacking to death
with machete, cleaver or knife."
The seven suspects arrested
yesterday were identified as J.C.
Simon, 29; Larry Greene, 22; Dwight
Stallings, 28; Tom Manney, 31; Edgar
D. Burton, 22; Manuel Moore, 23; and
Clarence Jamerson, 29. No further
personal information was released.
Booked
All the suspects were booked on
charges of murder or conspiracy to
commit murder. Police said fhe men
would be arraigned today.
According to Alioto, the "Death
Angels" are "fanatical believers in
black separatism" who base their
philosophy on "muddled aberrations
clearly outside the mainstream of
Islamic religions. In my opinion, it
represents as much potential threat to
blacks as to whites."
Promotions in the alleged
organization are determined by a
national leader located outside of
California, Alioto said.

"The investigation will continue
until we are satisfied that we have
rounded up all the members of this
group and have insured the fact that
new members will not take their
place," he said.
State Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger
said at a news conference he has "no
clear evidence" linking the Zebra
killings to any others outside the Bay
Area, but conceded that his office had
not yet viewed all evidence used by
San Francisco police.
He noted that it was not improper
to say that there were similarities
between the Zebra killings and a
number of others in the state since
1971.
The Zebra case was apparently
broken with the aid of an informant
who had witnessed some of the
killings.
