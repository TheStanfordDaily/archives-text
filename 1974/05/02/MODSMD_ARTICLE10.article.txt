# AFRC-- Real Goals
## 
### 
t Melissa Lawson 2
In two Daily articles now, yoiu
reporters have inaccurately
portrayed the African Famine
Relief Committee, its goals and its
activities in the Stanford
community.
The title of the April 11
article—"University Officials
African Fund D rive
Illegal"—strongly suggested that
our organization was working
outside University laws. The fact
is that an auxiliary arm of the
AFRC headed by Laurie Coplen
was halted from seeking a
percentage of dorm funds becaui
the University prohibits the
solicitation and use of dorm funds
for any "political" purpose.
/ However, the University does
not forbid individual
contributions or dorm
112 u nd - ra iser s. Voluntary
contributions are indeed lega.,
tax-deductible, and may be sent
to R.A.I.N.S. (Relief for Africans
in Need in the Sahel), P.O. Box
2368, Stanford, Calif. 94305
In the Monday, April 29 Daily,
the reporter wrote that the AFRC
"May Not Reach Goal." The goals
of the AFRC, a subcommittee
the BSU, are 1) to disseminate
information concerning the
drought 2) to initiate political
action (e.g., writing your
congressman to support aid for
the stricken areas) and 3) to raise
funds.
Our fund-raising activities have
included "Big Daddy's" dinners,
concerts and dances, and a
letter-writing campaign soliciting
contributions. In our continued
efforts to both publicize and raise
funds, we have broadened our
scale of operation to include th
Bay Area.
The auxiliary group under
Laurie Coplen has continued the
canvass of the Stanford
community with a car wash held
last Saturday and with a carnival
planned for May 10-12. T*
further clarify issues, there is but
one African Famine Relief
Committee on campus under my
direction and we have many other
activities slated.
The Daily reporters repeatedly
misquoted me and incorrectly,
attributed statements I made to
Coplen. The effectiveness of the
AFRC will not be measured solely
in terms of funds raised, but will
also include the other goals
mentioned earlier. We can be
maximally effective with maximal
support from the Stanford
community.

In the Monday, April 29 Daily,
the reporter wrote that the AFRC
"May Not Reach Goal." The goals
of the AFRC, a subcommittee
the BSU, are 1) to disseminate
information concerning the
drought 2) to initiate political
action (e.g., writing your
congressman to support aid for
the stricken areas) and 3) to raise
funds.
Our fund-raising activities have
included "Big Daddy's" dinners,
concerts and dances, and a
letter-writing campaign soliciting
contributions. In our continued
efforts to both publicize and raise
funds, we have broadened our
scale of operation to include th
Bay Area.
The auxiliary group under
Laurie Coplen has continued the
canvass of the Stanford
community with a car wash held
last Saturday and with a carnival
planned for May 10-12. T*
further clarify issues, there is but
one African Famine Relief
Committee on campus under my
direction and we have many other
activities slated.
The Daily reporters repeatedly
misquoted me and incorrectly,
attributed statements I made to
Coplen. The effectiveness of the
AFRC will not be measured solely
in terms of funds raised, but will
also include the other goals
mentioned earlier. We can be
maximally effective with maximal
support from the Stanford
community.
