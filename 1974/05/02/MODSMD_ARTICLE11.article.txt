# Union Propaganda' And Employee Rights'
## 
### 
Patricia Nash

I am a staff member in the Law
School. I have held many jobs
prior to this at various places: for
example, with First City National
Bank, Bishop Travel, and the
University of Hawaii. On the basis
of my experience, I am qualified
to reply to the most recent item
in a long series of union
propaganda.
I refer to the advance
distribution of a union document
entitled "Employee Rights in
Event of a Strike." I have never
received the callous and
contemptuous treatment
described. I have riot been issued
orders, as sucb; I have been asked
to do the job for which I was
hired.
I will try to assure that my
office will operate in the event of
a strike; and I have a legal right
not to be coerced into joining the
strike or into staying away from
my job.
I feel that my wage is fair by
community standards. Every
September the University does an
analysis of the "cost-of-living,"
and wages are adjusted. The
vacation (three weeks beginning
with the first year on the job),sick
leave (10 days paid) optional time
off for personal business (given
with the approval of the
supervisor-I have requested time
off once and it was granted
immediately) are far more
generous thah those offered by
any previous employer. There is a
medical plan for dependents (I
believe there are at least three).
Union Unwanted
I wish to forego union
representation. Stanford
University, with the benefits
outlined above and library use,
discount travel, recreational

facilities and aesthetic value is not
something from which I wish to
be protected.
I will cross picket lines—not
due to pressure from University,
but because I believe in my
judgment. My self-respect is not
so unsteady that I fear the "heavy
trip" of facing my co-workers
after a strike. I reject this threat
of illegal coercion.
How can you bet Stanford
University would cut you and
your family off health insurance if
they could? In my orientation
lecture, the University went out
of its way to explain how one
could retain health plans even if
one's relationship with the
University were severed
completely.
I have seen no anti-union
propaganda. I have, however, been
badgered by union members and
student supporters of the union.
In addition, several notices such as
the one to which this letter is in
reply have been placed in my
mailbox—by the union.
So far as I can see, the Union is
trying to create hostility between
employees and the University so
the Union leaders can then pose as
our guardians against a hostile
employer-all financed by
employee dues.
It won't work with me. Don't
let them work it on you.

Questions and answers
concerning employee rights
during a strike
In the past few months the
term "strike" has been mentioned
by members of United Stanford
Employees in some of our
publications and meetings. Talk of
a strike has prompted a number of
questions.
Currently negotiators for the
University and USE continue to
meet in an effort to reach
agreement on a contract for the
USE bargaining unit employees
and with the intent to resolve
differences without a strike.
The rights of a University
worker during a strike are
outlined below by the Union's
legal staff.
If USE were to call a strike
would Stanford University remain
open and continue operations?
No. The administration has driven
the Technical, Maintenance and
Service workers to the extremity
of a strike through their callous
and contemptuous treatmentofthe
people who make Stanford run.
Of course, administrators will
stand around and issue orders, but
they can't do the work. The unit
workers are forced to exercise an
economic consequence to protect
their livelihood. Thus, the
University will not operate.
Would I have a right to work in
my University job during a strike?
Yes, and you also have a right to
cut off your nose. The unit
workers will be striking for
themselves and all will gain. They
are fighting for a cost-of-living
escalator, a minimum wage, a fair
wage by community standards,

medical plan coverage of
dependents, pension
improvements and union
representation. As a Stanford
worker these are things you need.
Would you help yourself, or harm
yourself?
Are scabbing employees or
University administrators
permitted to force me to work?
No. Your right to join with others
to take action to protect your
economic rights as workers is
protected by law and by the
Union. All workers striking with
the unit will be protected and
represented by the Union.
We think the administration
will be' tempted to use as many
methods as possible to break the
strike but they will be frustrated
by our size, our stfength, our
defenses, and public opinion.
As a USE member, would I be
subject to penalty if I crossed a
picket line? Our Union is an
association of Stanford workers
joined together to support each
other. To quit the Union so as to
scab or break the strike and avoid
future fines is a union-busting
tactic commonly urged by
employers. No one should be
surprised that Stanford should
hope to, or try to bust the Union.
They still hope to avoid dealing
with us collectively. But it won't
work with USE.
Besides, those who feel
pressured by the administration
and are inclined to go to work in a
strike, may work for a short while
during the strike but then have to
face their co workers after the
strike is settled. That's a heavy
trip.
Do employees have a right to
strike? Yes. Many supervisors

cannot do the work, and they are
too few to get the job done. But
in this strike even the supervisors
will be supporting the Union.
Don't they and their families ea'.
too? Don't they, too, suffer from
the administration's outrageous
position on the increasing
cost-of-living? "The University
cannot afford to keep up with the
(D. Barton)
Can an employee lose his job if
he goes on strike? No. Only il
they allow their Union to be
smashed. Every strike settlement
includes an amnesty provision so
all go back to work even those
charged with 'misconduct.'
Will those employees who do
not work during a strike be pair'
their regular Stanford wages and
benefits? No. You can bet
Stanford would cut you and your
family off health insurance if they
could. But they can't. They will
have to either put people on
vacation or on leave without pay.
They do refuse to pay th*
premium, but they can't keep us
from making the payment
ourselves.
What can you do with an
administration like this? Resist.
It's their job to administer the
University, but they can't do th? 4
without our help, and that 01
many others. Our brothers and
sisters in other unions will support
us, as well as the large majority of
the Stanford community. But our
own strength will see us through.
P.S. You might protest their use
of our money to spread the 5 -
anti-union propaganda. Tr,
protesting to your Congressman
on improper use of government
funds. Is it our government or
theirs?
