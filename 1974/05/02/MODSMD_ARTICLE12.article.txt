# Co-Ed Living Arrangements
## Liberal Relations Becoming Popular 
### ANN BLACKMAN Associated Press Writer 
BOSTON — Almost every night a student
named Jeff stuffs a toothbrush in his shirt
pocket and walks across the courtyard of his
Harvard dormitory to spend the night with
his Radcliffe girlfriend.
At Beloit College in Wisconsin,
19-year-old Charlie and his girlfriend, Sue,
have pushed their single beds together.
They've lived in her dorm room for almost a
year.
A 21-year-old athlete and his sophomore
girlfriend at the University of Louisville in
Kentucky have lived in her dorm room since
last summer. They rely on their friends not
to snitch on them and on a resident adviser
who agrees to look the other way.
The college couples are among hundreds
of students from Boston to Berkeley — and a
lot more conservative places in between —
who are living together on campus.
Popular Way Of Life
Interviews with scores of students and
administrators at more than a dozen colleges
and universities across the country indicate
that although living together is rarely
discussed in the college catalogue, it's
become a popular way of life for some on
campus.
It isn't as widespread as the "going
steady" craze of the 1950s and early '60s,
but almost all students interviewed could
name at least two or three couples living
together on campus. They saw nothing wrong
with it.

The trend raised many eyebrows among
parents, alumni and school officials when it
appeared in the mid-60s and there was public
outcry about campuses becoming dens of
dope and sex. But most of that has
disappeared.
"Serious Relationship"
"Most couples living together in the
Harvard dorm have a very serious
relationship," said a graduate student
assigned as resident adviser to one dormitory,
or "house" as it's called at Harvard. "It's a
very acceptable thing."
"It's ordinary," said a Harvard housing
official. "I don't know how the university
could intrude. You couldn't possibly do a
thing like bed checks."
None of the couples living together on
campus had been assigned to the same room
by the college. In fact, most use both rooms
for the sake of appearance, mail, more
storage space — and privacy when they want
it.
"He only sleeps here when my roommate
is away," said a chubby freshman at Indiana
University. "But we eat together, study
together and think about getting married
some time, but not right away."
Her boyfriend reached over and took her
hand. "As far as personal relations are
concerned," he said, "you can learn a lot
about each other this way. You can cope
with problems better and understand each
other better. It was a long time after we
began spending most of our time together

that we thought about sex, four or five
jnonths. Our relationship isn't just to sleep
together."
"For a whole set of reasons, you're
dealing with a very diverse group of students
in terms of levels of maturity, past
experience, personal needs and hometown
environment," said Thomas C. Schreck,dean
of students at Indiana where students can
choose dorms with closed, limited or open
visitation policies. "If you try to force them
all into a set mold, you're not addressing
yourself to the differences people possess."
A study of 482 member institutions of the
Association of College and University
Housing Officers shows that 70 percent of
the nation's colleges offer some type of co-ed
housing to students. Only 15 percent of the
schools offer men and women rooms on the
same floor or in the same suite. The study
was produced by David A. DeCoster, an
assistant dean of students in charge of
residence life at Indiana. He said there is no
evidence that co-ed housing or visitation has
increased sexual activity among students.
"Literature shows that attitudes have
changed dramatically in a liberal direction,"
said DeCoster, who is recognized by many
college and university officials as an expert
on campus housing. 'They are more
accepting of peer behavior. But there is no
documentation that there are differences in
their own behavior. And there is a false
interpretation that liberal attitudes mean
liberal behavior."
