# Specially Equipped Intensive Care Nurseries
## Babies Nursed To Life At Medical Center

Medical Center Newsservice
Most critically ill newborn infants who would
otherwise have died, today recover without
handicaps because of various supportive measures
now available at the University Hospital's
Intensive Care Nursery (ICN) and Premature
Infants Research Center, now entering its 11th year
of operation.
Julie, for example, was born prematurely and
weighed just four pounds. Her blood condition
required that she have a transfusion minutes after
birth.
Shortly afterwards, she developed respiratory
problems severe enough to require a lengthy period
on a respirator to assist her breathing. More
transfusions were required. Doctors put her chances
of survival at only 40 percent.
Julie was born at Stanford University Hospital in
1967 and today she is a bright, healthy, highly
intelligent six-year-old.
Greater Survival Chance
Infants like Julie born today have a much
greater chance of survival than she had. Today, the
overall survival rate for infants with respiratory
distress syndrome is 85 percent, according to
Stanford nursery statistics.
Survival for all infants admitted to the Stanford
intensive care nurseries in the first half of 1973 was
92 percent.
Follow-up studies of survivors who had
mechanical ventilation (oxygen assistance) between
1962 and 1969 at Stanford show that more than 80
percent have no handicaps, neurologically or
intellectually. Incidence of handicaps decreased in
the latter part of the period studies.
Dr. John Johnson, assistant director of ICN,
points out that 95 percent of those studies
probably would not have survived at all without
treatment.
Several Developments
Dr. Philip Sunshine, director of ICN, and
Johnson list several developments in the care of
critically ill infants at Stanford that have helped
bring about this improvement. They cite more
extensive monitoring, new equipment, more

diagnostic tools, and changes in therapy and general
procedures.
About 700 infants are admitted to the ICN
yearly. An additional 50 are admitted to the
Premature Research Center annually, where the
intensive care is supported by a grant from the
General Clinical Research Centers Branch of the
National Institutes of Health.
Respiratory Distress Syndrome
Today respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)
occurs in approximately one to two percent of all
births, affecting 20 to 25 percent of all prematurely
born infants in the U.S.
Mechanical ventilation techniques have been
most important in Stanford's success in altering the

picture of RDS mortality, according to Sunshine.
RDS, or hyaline membrane disease, art terms
often used interchangeably to describe the
developmental phenomenon.
Treatment aid, said Sunshine, is to support the
infant until he produces a surface-active material to
line the airway and keep the alveoli, the tiny air
sacs in his lungs, from collapsing.
Normally this material is manufactured during
the late fetal period before birth, but may be
absent in premature infants.
"We treat HMD as one would treat a heart
attack. We treat the complications it brings and give
the infant time to heal himself," said Sunshine.
Recently, research has begun to indicate that

steroids administered to the mother a day or two
before birth may cause the enzyme material to be
made more readily by the infant.
The use of oxygen in the care of the premature
infant is a subject of great controversy, since
prolonged use of high concentrations of oxygen can
be damaging to both the lungs and eyes of the
baby.
Stanford doctors have developed specific criteria
for initiating oxygen therapy. Their aim is to have a
shortened exposure to oxygen, starting at lower
concentrations.
Anticipating the need for this therapy is an
important development in the Stanford ICN during
the past 10 years. The ideal management of an
infant with RDS is to anticipate the infant at risk
to develop the syndrome and to monitor that
infant carefully, said Sunshine. Time is of
utmost importance."
Small-for-dates Infants
Not only premature infants require intensive
care. Recently the ICN has placed increasing
emphasis on identification of small-for-dates
infants: those full-term babies weighing under 2500
grams (5.5 lbs). Only infants delivered before 37
weeks are termed premature. More than 20 percent
of the infants admitted to the Stanford nurseries
are small-for-dates.
The problems and complications of such infants
are markedly different from those encountered in
an infant of the same weight, but who suffers from
early growth retardation. The small-for-dates infant
normally doesn't have respiratory distress
syndrome, but hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and
pneumonias are characteristic problems.
Another factor in lowering newborn mortality
has been improved infant transport systems.
Stanford's heliport is a well-known feature, with
more than 200 infants flown or transported by
ambulance annually to the ICN from outlaying
community hospitals.
Improvements in infant transport systems have
lowered mortality in transit to about 15 percent
from the 25 to 35 percent rate of 10 years ago, said
Sunshine.

1962 and 1969 at Stanford show that more than 80
percent have no handicaps, neurologically or
intellectually. Incidence of handicaps decreased in
the latter part of the period studies.
Dr. John Johnson, assistant director of ICN,
points out that 95 percent of those studies
probably would not have survived at all without
treatment.
Several Developments
Dr. Philip Sunshine, director of ICN, and
Johnson list several developments in the care of
critically ill infants at Stanford that have helped
bring about this improvement. They cite more
extensive monitoring, new equipment, more

diagnostic tools, and changes in therapy and general
procedures.
About 700 infants are admitted to the ICN
yearly. An additional 50 are admitted to the
Premature Research Center annually, where the
intensive care is supported by a grant from the
General Clinical Research Centers Branch of the
National Institutes of Health.
Respiratory Distress Syndrome
Today respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)
occurs in approximately one to two percent of all
births, affecting 20 to 25 percent of all prematurely
born infants in the U.S.
Mechanical ventilation techniques have been
most important in Stanford's success in altering the

picture of RDS mortality, according to Sunshine.
RDS, or hyaline membrane disease, art terms
often used interchangeably to describe the
developmental phenomenon.
Treatment aid, said Sunshine, is to support the
infant until he produces a surface-active material to
line the airway and keep the alveoli, the tiny air
sacs in his lungs, from collapsing.
Normally this material is manufactured during
the late fetal period before birth, but may be
absent in premature infants.
"We treat HMD as one would treat a heart
attack. We treat the complications it brings and give
the infant time to heal himself," said Sunshine.
Recently, research has begun to indicate that

steroids administered to the mother a day or two
before birth may cause the enzyme material to be
made more readily by the infant.
The use of oxygen in the care of the premature
infant is a subject of great controversy, since
prolonged use of high concentrations of oxygen can
be damaging to both the lungs and eyes of the
baby.
Stanford doctors have developed specific criteria
for initiating oxygen therapy. Their aim is to have a
shortened exposure to oxygen, starting at lower
concentrations.
Anticipating the need for this therapy is an
important development in the Stanford ICN during
the past 10 years. The ideal management of an
infant with RDS is to anticipate the infant at risk
to develop the syndrome and to monitor that
infant carefully, said Sunshine. Time is of
utmost importance."
Small-for-dates Infants
Not only premature infants require intensive
care. Recently the ICN has placed increasing
emphasis on identification of small-for-dates
infants: those full-term babies weighing under 2500
grams (5.5 lbs). Only infants delivered before 37
weeks are termed premature. More than 20 percent
of the infants admitted to the Stanford nurseries
are small-for-dates.
The problems and complications of such infants
are markedly different from those encountered in
an infant of the same weight, but who suffers from
early growth retardation. The small-for-dates infant
normally doesn't have respiratory distress
syndrome, but hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and
pneumonias are characteristic problems.
Another factor in lowering newborn mortality
has been improved infant transport systems.
Stanford's heliport is a well-known feature, with
more than 200 infants flown or transported by
ambulance annually to the ICN from outlaying
community hospitals.
Improvements in infant transport systems have
lowered mortality in transit to about 15 percent
from the 25 to 35 percent rate of 10 years ago, said
Sunshine.

Most critically ill newborn infants who would
otherwise have died, today recover without
handicaps because of various supportive measures
now available at the University Hospital's
Intensive Care Nursery (ICN) and Premature
Infants Research Center, now entering its 11th year
of operation.
Julie, for example, was born prematurely and
weighed just four pounds. Her blood condition
required that she have a transfusion minutes after
birth.
Shortly afterwards, she developed respiratory
problems severe enough to require a lengthy period
on a respirator to assist her breathing. More
transfusions were required. Doctors put her chances
of survival at only 40 percent.
Julie was born at Stanford University Hospital in
1967 and today she is a bright, healthy, highly
intelligent six-year-old.
Greater Survival Chance
Infants like Julie born today have a much
greater chance of survival than she had. Today, the
overall survival rate for infants with respiratory
distress syndrome is 85 percent, according to
Stanford nursery statistics.
Survival for all infants admitted to the Stanford
intensive care nurseries in the first half of 1973 was
92 percent.

RDS, or hyaline membrane disease, art terms
often used interchangeably to describe the
developmental phenomenon.
Treatment aid, said Sunshine, is to support the
infant until he produces a surface-active material to
line the airway and keep the alveoli, the tiny air
sacs in his lungs, from collapsing.
Normally this material is manufactured during
the late fetal period before birth, but may be
absent in premature infants.
"We treat HMD as one would treat a heart
attack. We treat the complications it brings and give
the infant time to heal himself," said Sunshine.
Recently, research has begun to indicate that

steroids administered to the mother a day or two
before birth may cause the enzyme material to be
made more readily by the infant.
The use of oxygen in the care of the premature
infant is a subject of great controversy, since
prolonged use of high concentrations of oxygen can
be damaging to both the lungs and eyes of the
baby.
Stanford doctors have developed specific criteria
for initiating oxygen therapy. Their aim is to have a
shortened exposure to oxygen, starting at lower
concentrations.
Anticipating the need for this therapy is an
important development in the Stanford ICN during
the past 10 years. The ideal management of an
infant with RDS is to anticipate the infant at risk
to develop the syndrome and to monitor that
infant carefully, said Sunshine. Time is of
utmost importance."
Small-for-dates Infants
Not only premature infants require intensive
care. Recently the ICN has placed increasing
emphasis on identification of small-for-dates
infants: those full-term babies weighing under 2500
grams (5.5 lbs). Only infants delivered before 37
weeks are termed premature. More than 20 percent
of the infants admitted to the Stanford nurseries
are small-for-dates.
The problems and complications of such infants
are markedly different from those encountered in
an infant of the same weight, but who suffers from
early growth retardation. The small-for-dates infant
normally doesn't have respiratory distress
syndrome, but hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and
pneumonias are characteristic problems.
Another factor in lowering newborn mortality
has been improved infant transport systems.
Stanford's heliport is a well-known feature, with
more than 200 infants flown or transported by
ambulance annually to the ICN from outlaying
community hospitals.
Improvements in infant transport systems have
lowered mortality in transit to about 15 percent
from the 25 to 35 percent rate of 10 years ago, said
Sunshine.

Medical Center Newsservice
Most critically ill newborn infants who would
otherwise have died, today recover without
handicaps because of various supportive measures
now available at the University Hospital's
Intensive Care Nursery (ICN) and Premature
Infants Research Center, now entering its 11th year
of operation.
Julie, for example, was born prematurely and
weighed just four pounds. Her blood condition
required that she have a transfusion minutes after
birth.
Shortly afterwards, she developed respiratory
problems severe enough to require a lengthy period
on a respirator to assist her breathing. More
transfusions were required. Doctors put her chances
of survival at only 40 percent.
Julie was born at Stanford University Hospital in
1967 and today she is a bright, healthy, highly
intelligent six-year-old.
Greater Survival Chance
Infants like Julie born today have a much
greater chance of survival than she had. Today, the
overall survival rate for infants with respiratory
distress syndrome is 85 percent, according to
Stanford nursery statistics.
Survival for all infants admitted to the Stanford
intensive care nurseries in the first half of 1973 was
92 percent.
Follow-up studies of survivors who had
mechanical ventilation (oxygen assistance) between
1962 and 1969 at Stanford show that more than 80
percent have no handicaps, neurologically or
intellectually. Incidence of handicaps decreased in
the latter part of the period studies.
Dr. John Johnson, assistant director of ICN,
points out that 95 percent of those studies
probably would not have survived at all without
treatment.
Several Developments
Dr. Philip Sunshine, director of ICN, and
Johnson list several developments in the care of
critically ill infants at Stanford that have helped
bring about this improvement. They cite more
extensive monitoring, new equipment, more

diagnostic tools, and changes in therapy and general
procedures.
About 700 infants are admitted to the ICN
yearly. An additional 50 are admitted to the
Premature Research Center annually, where the
intensive care is supported by a grant from the
General Clinical Research Centers Branch of the
National Institutes of Health.
Respiratory Distress Syndrome
Today respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)
occurs in approximately one to two percent of all
births, affecting 20 to 25 percent of all prematurely
born infants in the U.S.
Mechanical ventilation techniques have been
most important in Stanford's success in altering the

picture of RDS mortality, according to Sunshine.
