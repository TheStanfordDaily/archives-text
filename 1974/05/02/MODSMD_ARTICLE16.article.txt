# Grad Education Program Thrives Here
## 
### BOB LOWE Second of Two Parts 
Declining growth in enrollment at all levels of
education and budget cutting by many school districts
have hurt the teaching profession and schools of education
across the nation. In spite of this trend, Stanford's
graduate programs in education still thrive and the vast
majority of graduates are finding the jobs they want.
The Stanford School of Education has approximately
300 doctoral and 200 M.A. students. Although in recent
years, fewer people apply to the graduate programs, there
are still three or four applicants for every available space.
Furthermore, in the M.A. program, the quality of
applicants seems to be rising.
About one-half of the M.A. students in the School of
Education are in the Secondary Education Teaching
Program (STEP), a four-quarter program in which the
student earns both a teaching credential and an M.A. in
education.
Of 107 students who graduated from STEP last June,
79 now teach full time â€” 72 percent of the total. (Many of
the others went into Ph.D. programs or didn't want to
teach.) Seven years ago, when the teaching market was
expanding, that figure was only 56 percent.
Ruth Schneider, director of Teaching Placement in the
Career Planning and Placement Center, offers one
explanation for the increasing percentage of teaching
STEP graduates in a market which tightens more and
more.
Teaching Oriented
"If you are aware of the market, you don't go into
STEP unless you are motivated," she said. In other words,
students entering STEP are more oriented toward a
teaching career than those several years ago.
Students may be "screening themselves," Schneider
says, so that only the more motivated apply, but another
reason for the Stanford graduates' job market success is
that the School of Education favors applicants who show a

strong desire to continue in education.
Elizabeth Morris, admissions secretary of the School
of Education, said that STEP chooses students who are
"committed to education as a career." Many in STEP have
already had some form of "teaching experience," such as
recreation work, she said.
Similarly, doctoral students are screened with an eye
toward practical experience in education. Many are former
teachers and administrators. Some are on sabbatical from
school districts or being groomed for a particular post.
Success Stories
Graduates from the doctoral program, like those in
STEP, do relatively well in the job market. A majority
wind up with research or teaching positions at universities.
Many find high level administrative posts with school
districts.
Dr. Ralph Keller, Director of the Placement Center, is
responsible for placing graduates who wish to go into
administration. "By and large, graduates at the School of
Education are very successful," he said. "We've had very,
very few problems placing them."
Keller said that "we have a shortage" of administrators,
if an administrator is defined as one who has "good
academic background, a good performance record and a
reasonable amount of experience." Most of the Stanford
graduates fill these qualifications, he said.
Dr. Bruce Keepes, director of research for the Palo Alto
Unified School District (PAUSD), is a Stanford graduate in
education. He said that he was "sitting down in Cuba,
drunking Bacardi rum when I decided that I was going to
be an alcoholic or get my doctorate." He chose the latter
and finished his Ed.D. in 1968, at the age of 38.
Research Effects
The School of Education's research orientation heavily
influences the graduate programs. STEP is housed in the
Stanford Center for Research and Development in
Teaching and serves as a laboratory for studies about how
to teach teachers.

Although recognized as the School of Education's
strength, the research emphasis isn't viewed as an asset by
all students.
Brian McCauley, dean of student affairs at Los Altos
High School, is "critical of schools of education in
general." McCauley, who finished his doctoral work in
1971, said, "I didn't get good professional help at
Stanford. When you talk about the job I'm doing right
now, I don't really feel that I learned much that helped
99
me.
Julie Weber, a STEP student, said that "many of the
education courses I took last summer and fall were in the
realm of theory ... and not practical."
Job Placement
Whether or not the prospective teacher or administrator
agrees with the School of Education's teaching practices,
he can't ignore Stanford trained educators' remarkable
success in the job market. It's a strong incentive to come
here.
Keith Wilson, another STEP student, said that he had
to accept the "reality that Stanford has a name. Education
is a competitive field and it makes a difference," he said.
One person who may soon be in a position to hire
Wilson, agrees. Dr. Robert McLean, PAUSD Asst.
Superintendent in charge of personnel, said, "My
experience with STEP has been outstanding."
He added that "Stanford does a fine job of screening"
and that STEP interns and teachers are usually better than
those from other programs. McLean said that he is swayed
by the School of Education's good record. "They (STEP
graduates) get favored treatment, but they earn it, too,"
he said.
A doctoral student and one of the STEP supervisors,
Robin Alexander, agrees that STEP students deserve their
job market advantage.
She received her credential and M.A. at Cal State-Los
Angeles and said that "you get more personal treatment
here than you would at a state school."
