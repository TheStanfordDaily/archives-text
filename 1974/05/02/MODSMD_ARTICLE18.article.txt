# Bluegrass Festival Attracts Thousands
## 
### PAUL YEUELL 
Country Bluegrass, possibly
one of America's oldest musical
traditions, is marrying happily
with the energies and talents of
the West Coast rock scene.
Last week-end, at the Golden
State Country Bluegrass Festival
in Marin, the Nashville old-timers
mixed with the youngsters and
laid down some damned good
licks.
The list of performers included
not only the Nashville folks like
Doc and Merle Watson, Vassar
Clements, Merle Travis, and Ralph
Stanley, but also several from San
Francisco's scene like John
Dawson, Taj Mahal and Jerry
Garcia.
But the entertainment was
hardly limited to the hot licks up
front. In addition to the playing
and singing on stage, there were
square dances, clogging lessons,
pickin' sessions on the lawns,
banjo and guitar workshops and
an ample supply of good country
lovin'.
Little children wandered about
naked with their names painted
across their bellies. And their
parents, laying in the sun, drifted
in and out of consciousness.
A plane flew lazily overhead,
trolling Marin County with a
banner advertising the festival.
One fan in the latter stages of

mind-twist entertained the crowd
during a break in the music with
an LSD dance that ended with a
drive into the cyclone fence.
And all the while, the wind
blew the sweet talk of guitars,
mandolins, fiddles, and bluegrass
harmonies over the festival.
The chief reason that these
several thousand folks got along
so well was the festival's excellent
production. Paul and Judy
Lammers, creators and promoters
of the event, did not miss a trick.
They had the West Coast pros
to work for them. For instance,
the stage was handled by
"Sparky," the noted stage
manager for the grateful Dead.
The sound system was similar
to the Dead's, only better. The
mid-range, which includes the
vocals, was probably the best ever
at an outdoor concert thanks to
the new design by Jeff Cook, an
ex-Dead sound man.
The security personnel, crucial
in the success of a festival, must
have been hand-picked. They were
just the right combination of
inefficacy and indifference. After
all, who needs Nazis at a party?
One guard thought he was at a
jazz festival. Another danced with
a covy of "nine year-old girls in
front of the stage.
Onstage, the boogie was
non-stop. One of the finest acts

came on Friday night when the
newly-formed Great American
String Band jammed with some
friends.
The String Band, with Taj
Mahal (string bass), David
Nichtem (guitar), David "Dog"
Grisman (mandolin) and Richard
Green (fiddle), amazed the crowd
with original songs that are bound
to become classics.
They were joined by Jerry
Garcia (banjo) and the man to
whom the festival was dedicated,
Vassar Clements (fiddle). And
finally, Maria Muldaur joined
them to sing "Midnight at the
Oasis."
Other outrageous acts included
"Tut" Tuttle, Norman Blake, Mac
Wiseman, John Herald and plenty
more of Vassar Clements.
Backstage, four huge grills
seared barbequed chicken for the
performers all day long and
gallons of Coors flowed to wash it
down.
Between chicken thighs and
rounds of beer, everybody that
could was pickin' and those that
cound not, were singing.
Out front, corn bread, baked
ham flown in from Virginia,
fritters, black-eyed peas, pecan pie
and cider were served up. And
everywhere, the music was sweet
and friendly.
Bluegrass grew up in the

southeast, but its origin is
Elizabethan England. The lyrics,
inflections, and melodies can be
traced back to 17 th and 18th
century England.
The instruments, which are
without exception string
acoustics, evolved from gilded
Elizabethan chambers to the
rugged Smoky Mountains of
North Carolina, the backwoods of
Georgia and the Shenandoah
Valley.
The instruments included
guitars, banjos, mandolins, fiddler
string basses, zithers, and hammer
dulcimers.
"Well, when I was Merle's age,"
said Doc Watson about choosing
an instrument to play, "I bought
me a fiddle and about the best I
could do was make it sound like a
hungry pig."
The songs themselves, even
though they are sung with a great

deal of energy, can be sadder than
any blues Doc Watson sang.
Gonna get up and pick my
guitar.
Cause this old bed is making
me tired.

Entertainment

Or Jim and Jessie Mcßeynolds
sang,
While I'm not next to you,
I'm sleeping in shackles and
chains.
The songs may laud the
baddest man in the county, like
the one about a truck driver who
was so mean that he wore nothing
but a loin-cloth made from
Freuhauf mud flaps.

But the most moving songs are
the bittersweet tunes about the
old South. Lou Harris sang,
It took 300,000 Yankees
before they conquered us,

And if we'd had another year,
we would have turned 'em
around."
The theme of something lost,
something gone forever is the
strongest and works itself into a
large part of bluegrass. The notion
of going back to some forgotten
place is found in songs like
"Rocky Top," a song about a

mountain where the "gals are
sweeter than sodie pop."
Rocky Top, you'll always be,
Home sweet home to me,sang
pretty Emy Lou Harris.
Or "Hickory Winds." The
Hickory tree, like the southern
people's army, fell in the mid
19th century when a plight swept
through the south. New Hickories
grow not from seedlings but out
of the fallen bodies of the old.
"Whenever I'm lonesome,
I always pretend,
That Vm getting the feeling of
those Hickory winds."
In joining the spirit of the
South East with the rasty
straw-hat San Francisco country
scene, last week-end's bluegrass
festival was a great success. In the
town where people show their
appreciation by hooting and
hollering, the Nashvillt folks felt
right at home.

strongest and works itself into a
large part of bluegrass. The notion
of going back to some forgotten
place is found in songs like
"Rocky Top," a song about a

mountain where the "gals are
sweeter than sodie pop."
Rocky Top, you'll always be,
Home sweet home to me,sang
pretty Emy Lou Harris.
Or "Hickory Winds." The
Hickory tree, like the southern
people's army, fell in the mid
19th century when a plight swept
through the south. New Hickories
grow not from seedlings but out
of the fallen bodies of the old.
"Whenever I'm lonesome,
I always pretend,
That Vm getting the feeling of
those Hickory winds."
In joining the spirit of the
South East with the rasty
straw-hat San Francisco country
scene, last week-end's bluegrass
festival was a great success. In the
town where people show their
appreciation by hooting and
hollering, the Nashvillt folks felt
right at home.

WOODSTOCK?—Not really. This mass of people is assembled for last weekend's Country Bluegrass Festival at the Marin County Fairgrounds.
Although these people look like they're waiting for a rousing rock concert, their reason for attending was to listen to such artists as Merle
Travis, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, Mac Wiseman, John Hartford, Doc and Merle Watson, and many other popular bluegrass performers.
Country Bluegrass, possibly
one of America's oldest musical
traditions, is marrying happily
with the energies and talents of
the West Coast rock scene.
Last week-end, at the Golden
State Country Bluegrass Festival
in Marin, the Nashville old-timers
mixed with the youngsters and
laid down some damned good
licks.
The list of performers included
not only the Nashville folks like
Doc and Merle Watson, Vassar
Clements, Merle Travis, and Ralph
Stanley, but also several from San
Francisco's scene like John
Dawson, Taj Mahal and Jerry
Garcia.
But the entertainment was
hardly limited to the hot licks up
front. In addition to the playing
and singing on stage, there were
square dances, clogging lessons,
pickin' sessions on the lawns,
banjo and guitar workshops and
an ample supply of good country
lovin'.
Little children wandered about
naked with their names painted
across their bellies. And their
parents, laying in the sun, drifted
in and out of consciousness.
A plane flew lazily overhead,
trolling Marin County with a
banner advertising the festival.
One fan in the latter stages of

mind-twist entertained the crowd
during a break in the music with
an LSD dance that ended with a
drive into the cyclone fence.
And all the while, the wind
blew the sweet talk of guitars,
mandolins, fiddles, and bluegrass
harmonies over the festival.
The chief reason that these
several thousand folks got along
so well was the festival's excellent
production. Paul and Judy
Lammers, creators and promoters
of the event, did not miss a trick.
They had the West Coast pros
to work for them. For instance,
the stage was handled by
"Sparky," the noted stage
manager for the grateful Dead.
The sound system was similar
to the Dead's, only better. The
mid-range, which includes the
vocals, was probably the best ever
at an outdoor concert thanks to
the new design by Jeff Cook, an
ex-Dead sound man.
The security personnel, crucial
in the success of a festival, must
have been hand-picked. They were
just the right combination of
inefficacy and indifference. After
all, who needs Nazis at a party?
One guard thought he was at a
jazz festival. Another danced with
a covy of "nine year-old girls in
front of the stage.
Onstage, the boogie was
non-stop. One of the finest acts

came on Friday night when the
newly-formed Great American
String Band jammed with some
friends.
The String Band, with Taj
Mahal (string bass), David
Nichtem (guitar), David "Dog"
Grisman (mandolin) and Richard
Green (fiddle), amazed the crowd
with original songs that are bound
to become classics.
They were joined by Jerry
Garcia (banjo) and the man to
whom the festival was dedicated,
Vassar Clements (fiddle). And
finally, Maria Muldaur joined
them to sing "Midnight at the
Oasis."
Other outrageous acts included
"Tut" Tuttle, Norman Blake, Mac
Wiseman, John Herald and plenty
more of Vassar Clements.
Backstage, four huge grills
seared barbequed chicken for the
performers all day long and
gallons of Coors flowed to wash it
down.
Between chicken thighs and
rounds of beer, everybody that
could was pickin' and those that
cound not, were singing.
Out front, corn bread, baked
ham flown in from Virginia,
fritters, black-eyed peas, pecan pie
and cider were served up. And
everywhere, the music was sweet
and friendly.
Bluegrass grew up in the

southeast, but its origin is
Elizabethan England. The lyrics,
inflections, and melodies can be
traced back to 17 th and 18th
century England.
The instruments, which are
without exception string
acoustics, evolved from gilded
Elizabethan chambers to the
rugged Smoky Mountains of
North Carolina, the backwoods of
Georgia and the Shenandoah
Valley.
The instruments included
guitars, banjos, mandolins, fiddler
string basses, zithers, and hammer
dulcimers.
"Well, when I was Merle's age,"
said Doc Watson about choosing
an instrument to play, "I bought
me a fiddle and about the best I
could do was make it sound like a
hungry pig."
The songs themselves, even
though they are sung with a great

deal of energy, can be sadder than
any blues Doc Watson sang.
Gonna get up and pick my
guitar.
Cause this old bed is making
me tired.

Entertainment

Or Jim and Jessie Mcßeynolds
sang,
While I'm not next to you,
I'm sleeping in shackles and
chains.
The songs may laud the
baddest man in the county, like
the one about a truck driver who
was so mean that he wore nothing
but a loin-cloth made from
Freuhauf mud flaps.

But the most moving songs are
the bittersweet tunes about the
old South. Lou Harris sang,
It took 300,000 Yankees
before they conquered us,

And if we'd had another year,
we would have turned 'em
around."

rugged Smoky Mountains of
North Carolina, the backwoods of
Georgia and the Shenandoah
Valley.
The instruments included
guitars, banjos, mandolins, fiddler
string basses, zithers, and hammer
dulcimers.
"Well, when I was Merle's age,"
said Doc Watson about choosing
an instrument to play, "I bought
me a fiddle and about the best I
could do was make it sound like a
hungry pig."
The songs themselves, even
though they are sung with a great

deal of energy, can be sadder than
any blues Doc Watson sang.
Gonna get up and pick my
guitar.
Cause this old bed is making
me tired.

Entertainment

Or Jim and Jessie Mcßeynolds
sang,
While I'm not next to you,
I'm sleeping in shackles and
chains.
The songs may laud the
baddest man in the county, like
the one about a truck driver who
was so mean that he wore nothing
but a loin-cloth made from
Freuhauf mud flaps.

But the most moving songs are
the bittersweet tunes about the
old South. Lou Harris sang,
It took 300,000 Yankees
before they conquered us,

And if we'd had another year,
we would have turned 'em
around."
The theme of something lost,
something gone forever is the
strongest and works itself into a
large part of bluegrass. The notion
of going back to some forgotten
place is found in songs like
"Rocky Top," a song about a

mountain where the "gals are
sweeter than sodie pop."
Rocky Top, you'll always be,
Home sweet home to me,sang
pretty Emy Lou Harris.
Or "Hickory Winds." The
Hickory tree, like the southern
people's army, fell in the mid
19th century when a plight swept
through the south. New Hickories
grow not from seedlings but out
of the fallen bodies of the old.
"Whenever I'm lonesome,
I always pretend,
That Vm getting the feeling of
those Hickory winds."
In joining the spirit of the
South East with the rasty
straw-hat San Francisco country
scene, last week-end's bluegrass
festival was a great success. In the
town where people show their
appreciation by hooting and
hollering, the Nashvillt folks felt
right at home.

WOODSTOCK?—Not really. This mass of people is assembled for last weekend's Country Bluegrass Festival at the Marin County Fairgrounds.
Although these people look like they're waiting for a rousing rock concert, their reason for attending was to listen to such artists as Merle
Travis, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, Mac Wiseman, John Hartford, Doc and Merle Watson, and many other popular bluegrass performers.
Country Bluegrass, possibly
one of America's oldest musical
traditions, is marrying happily
with the energies and talents of
the West Coast rock scene.
Last week-end, at the Golden
State Country Bluegrass Festival
in Marin, the Nashville old-timers
mixed with the youngsters and
laid down some damned good
licks.
The list of performers included
not only the Nashville folks like
Doc and Merle Watson, Vassar
Clements, Merle Travis, and Ralph
Stanley, but also several from San
Francisco's scene like John
Dawson, Taj Mahal and Jerry
Garcia.
But the entertainment was
hardly limited to the hot licks up
front. In addition to the playing
and singing on stage, there were
square dances, clogging lessons,
pickin' sessions on the lawns,
banjo and guitar workshops and
an ample supply of good country
lovin'.
Little children wandered about
naked with their names painted
across their bellies. And their
parents, laying in the sun, drifted
in and out of consciousness.
A plane flew lazily overhead,
trolling Marin County with a
banner advertising the festival.
One fan in the latter stages of

mind-twist entertained the crowd
during a break in the music with
an LSD dance that ended with a
drive into the cyclone fence.
And all the while, the wind
blew the sweet talk of guitars,
mandolins, fiddles, and bluegrass
harmonies over the festival.
The chief reason that these
several thousand folks got along
so well was the festival's excellent
production. Paul and Judy
Lammers, creators and promoters
of the event, did not miss a trick.
They had the West Coast pros
to work for them. For instance,
the stage was handled by
"Sparky," the noted stage
manager for the grateful Dead.
The sound system was similar
to the Dead's, only better. The
mid-range, which includes the
vocals, was probably the best ever
at an outdoor concert thanks to
the new design by Jeff Cook, an
ex-Dead sound man.
The security personnel, crucial
in the success of a festival, must
have been hand-picked. They were
just the right combination of
inefficacy and indifference. After
all, who needs Nazis at a party?
One guard thought he was at a
jazz festival. Another danced with
a covy of "nine year-old girls in
front of the stage.
Onstage, the boogie was
non-stop. One of the finest acts

came on Friday night when the
newly-formed Great American
String Band jammed with some
friends.
The String Band, with Taj
Mahal (string bass), David
Nichtem (guitar), David "Dog"
Grisman (mandolin) and Richard
Green (fiddle), amazed the crowd
with original songs that are bound
to become classics.
They were joined by Jerry
Garcia (banjo) and the man to
whom the festival was dedicated,
Vassar Clements (fiddle). And
finally, Maria Muldaur joined
them to sing "Midnight at the
Oasis."
Other outrageous acts included
"Tut" Tuttle, Norman Blake, Mac
Wiseman, John Herald and plenty
more of Vassar Clements.
Backstage, four huge grills
seared barbequed chicken for the
performers all day long and
gallons of Coors flowed to wash it
down.
Between chicken thighs and
rounds of beer, everybody that
could was pickin' and those that
cound not, were singing.
Out front, corn bread, baked
ham flown in from Virginia,
fritters, black-eyed peas, pecan pie
and cider were served up. And
everywhere, the music was sweet
and friendly.
Bluegrass grew up in the

southeast, but its origin is
Elizabethan England. The lyrics,
inflections, and melodies can be
traced back to 17 th and 18th
century England.
The instruments, which are
without exception string
acoustics, evolved from gilded
Elizabethan chambers to the
rugged Smoky Mountains of
North Carolina, the backwoods of
Georgia and the Shenandoah
Valley.
