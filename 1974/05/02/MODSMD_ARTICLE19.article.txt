# S.F. Ballet Shows Variety

### JANET SWANBERG 
; SAN FRANCISCO—The
performance of the San Francisco
Ballet on April 25th contained a
delightful combination of modern
technique and disciplined
classicism.
The company presented four
individual dances: "Serenade,"
"Jest of Cards," Tchaikovsky's
"Pas De Deux," and
"Schubertiade."
Highlighting the evening was
Balanchine's interpretation of the
"Pas De Deux," which was
superbly danced by Patricia
Mcßride and Jean-Pierre
Bonnefous (guest artists from the
New York City Ballet). Mcßride's
exacting virtuosity matched with
the energy of Tchaikovsky's music

was breathtaking. Her
spontaneous lightness, mixed with
control and strength, absorbed the
audience and was received with
rounds of energetic applause.
Bonnefous maintained high
leaps and energetic turns, and the
two worked harmoniously
together, for her beauty of
movement was complemented by
his muscular support.
"Schubertiade" was lively and
fun. Set at a social gathering in a
Vienese salon, the dance was a
talent show, where richly
costumed guests displayed their
new steps and turns in front of
each other. It was suitably
accompanied by Schubert waltzes,
played by Roy Bogas on the piano
in the corner of the salon.

The guests participated in an
elegant game of one-up-manship,
as delightful combinations of male
and female dancers showed off
their strength of movement,
discipline, and intricate
choreography. The dance began
with effective silhouette lighting,
focused on a couple in the salon
who moved with graceful
extension.
Silhouettes gave birth to soft
candlelight, which blossomed into
full stage illumination, and the
enjoyable talent show continued.
"Schubertiade" was
choreographed in 1970 especially
for the San Francisco Ballet by
Michael Smuin, the company's
choreographer in residence.
"Jest of Cards," a revival of
previous performances, was
disappointing. Art abstract ballet,
using playing cards as its theme,
the dance portrays kings and
queens as they tower above the
lesser cards who are shuffled
about by life.
The royal figures, in 12-foot
tall costumes, clumsily waddled
on and off stage and seemed
purposeless. The lesser cards,
dressed in masks and leotards,
salvaged the dance with an
imaginative intertwine of bodies,
accompanied by electronic music.
The joker, John McFall, added
comic relief with his energetic
leaps and turns. However, the
total effect of "Jest of Cards"
was not very exciting.
"Serenade," choreographed by
Balanchine in 1934, was a well
executed, disciplined dance
without a plot. Dressed in misty
blue, large groups of female
dancers moved in a classically
restrained style. In between
groups, soloists displayed their
talent.
Overall, Tuesday's ballet was
most enjoyable. Its combination
of frolic, mixed with classical
discipline shows that the San
Francisco Ballet is a much
improved company.
