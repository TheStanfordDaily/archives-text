# Renewal Vote Due
## PACC Unsure Of Drug Group 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Most members of the Palo Alto
City Council seem to want to review
the performance of the Palo Alto Drug
Abuse Board (PACDAB) before
deciding whether or not to renew
PACDAB's contract with the city this
J uie.
"I don't want to prejudge the
program," Councilman Byron Sher
told the Daily in a statement typical of
council members. "I want to keep an
open mind and study the reports of
the evaluators of the program."
Sher explained that the John F.
Kennedy Institute of Martinez, an
organization that specializes in the
evaluation of drug abuse programs, is
conducting a study of PACDAB's
per forma pre.
A professional auditing firm is
investigating PACDAB's financial
i<ctivities, Sher added.
Unity House Closed
Sher remarked that the March
closing of Unity House, PACDAB's
residential treatment center, removed
one of the main targets of

anti-PACDAB opinion. Some people
might be more amenable to the
renewal of the PACDAB contract as a
result of the closure, he said.
"Unity House generated publicity
and discussion," Sher said. "There
seems to be less controversy over the
preventative drug program."
Joel Davidson, a member of the
PACDAB board of directors, said he
believes the preventative drug program
has been extremely successful, and
expressed hope the council will vote to
renew PACDAB.
No Organized Effort
Claire Smith, a staff member at
PACDAB's prevention center, said
yesterday that board members do not
plan to start a concerted effort to
convince the council of the program's
viability. Instead, PACDAB members
merely intend to continue what she
called its effective services.
But if the program appears to be
endangered after the completion of
investigations, she noted that
PACDAB would request that its
supporters write letters to the council

testifying to the merits of the
program.
Councilman Roy Clay told the
Daily that he has reservations about
PACDAB but will wait until the
issuance of the investigative reports
before deciding whether to vote to
renew the program.
Clay said that the program's
objectives were never defined and that
the council should never have made
such a big financial commitment to
PACDAB without defining its
objectives.
A large number of questions about
PACDAB will no doubt be answered
by the Kennedy Institute report , Clay
declared. But since the Institute will
start its work without a clear idea of
the objectives of the program, the
report will not be as clear as it should
be, he added.
Clay stated that the "collective
responsibility" theory of the PACDAB
staff constitutes one of his main
reservations about the program. Under
this theory, the staff has no
hierarchical structure. Hence, decisions
of the council are often not
implemented in an orderly fashion,
Clay explained.
Furthermore, Clay said that the
political philosophy of PACDAB has
bothered many people in the
community. PACDAB members insist
that they must formulate political
attitudes because drug abuse must be
attacked at its roots, which they claim
lie in the political and economic
situation of the nation.
Clay also said he is not certain if
the program can operate effectively
without Unity House. But Sher stated,
"the two [Unity House and the
prevention center] aren't inseparable."
Fred Eyerly, president of the
Crescent Park Homeowner's
Association, a group highly critical of
PACDAB in the past, said that the
organization has no immediate plans
to oppose renewal of the contract.
"We are not against the program,"
Eyerly emphasized. "But we do
believe that it is not fiscally
responsible.
"There is no rhyme or reason to the
way money is spent. Petty cash has
been spent for pizza, liquor and a trip
to Yosemite Park. They need to have
good accounting methods."
But Eyerly said that unless the
new contract provides a remedy for
the problems that he noted, the
homeowners' association "would bring
political pressure" on the council.
