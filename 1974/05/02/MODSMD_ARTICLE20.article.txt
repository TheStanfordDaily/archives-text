# Hendricks Concert Salutes Ellington
## 
### DAN FORTE 
On Monday, April 29, Edward
Kennedy "Duke" Ellington,
America's greatest contribution to
the world of music, turned 75
years of age.
Unfortunately, due to illness,
Duke was forced to cancel his
scheduled Sacred Concert here on
that date.
Saturday night in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, as part of the "Salute
to Duke Ellington" (the only
segment which was presented),
jazz singer-lyricist-San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Jon
Hendricks sang a program of
Ellington numbers to an
"intimately-sized" audience.
Backed more than capably by
pianist Larry Vukovitch's trio,
with Ratso Harris (bass) and
Benny Barth (drums), Hendricks
sang such Ellington classics as
"Solitude," "Mood Indigo,"
"Caravan," and "Satin Doll."
After the trio's rendition of
"Things Ain't What They Used To
Be," Hendricks took the stage
with his wife Judith and Bob
Mays to sing Duke's theme "Take
The 'A' Train" written by Billy
Strayhorn.
Hendricks, Kendricks, and
Mays suffer a good deal from
comparisons with Hendricks'
former scat trio, Lambert,
Hendricks, and Ross. Judith
Hendricks is no match for Annie
Ross, although her impersonation
of Cootie Williams' trumpet solo

on "In A Mellotone" was nice.
On Hendricks' solo vocals Mays
replaced Harris on bass fiddle — a
mistake because Harris was the
better of the two.
Hendricks is possibly the best
scat singer around of the few that
are left. Standing slightly hunched
over an invisible saxophone, his
hands in front of him forming the
notes, Hendricks crooned,
screamed, wailed, and blasted out
"sax solos" ranging in sound from
the late tenor great Ben Webster
to baritone saxophonist Harry
Carney to the late Johnny
Hodges' alto.
During one such solo, in
"C-Jam Blues," Hendricks didn't
quite reach a high note, so he
stepped back to tighten the
"mouthpiece" before proceeding
on to a few more fine choruses.
On the whole, the concert was
very well balanced, with several
highlights and few low spots.
Vukovitch soloed on two slow
numbers, "Sophisticated Lady"
and "Passion Flower," which were
perhaps the highest points in the
show. Vukovitch is an extremely
versatile pianist, and obviously has
a great deal of empathy for the
Duke.
Although Hendricks seemed
more at home improvising a scat
solo than singing lyrics to a set
melody, his most outstanding
performances came on two of
Ellington's most beautiful ballads,
"Do Nothing Till You Hear From

Me (Concerto for Cootie)" and"I
Let A Song Go Out Of My
Heart," with Hendricks' voice at
its best of the night, nearly
matching the original rendition by
Joy a Sherrill.
Had ley Caliman, used
all-too-sparingly on tenor sax,
nearly stole the show on the few
numbers he was able to stretch
out on, most notably "It Don't
Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got
That Swing)" and "Perdido."
Caliman, a Bay Area mainstay,
played in a style reminiscent of
John Coltrane, but sometimes
dipped back to the days of
Coleman Hawkins for some real
gut-buckset blues.

But, the highpoints of the
show were of course the songs
themselves, all written by the
master, Duke Ellington.
As trumpeter Miles Davis once
said, "I think all of the musicians
should get together one day, and
get down on their knees to thank
Duke."
When Duke Ellington's
Stanford appearance had to be
cancelled, the ASSU made a very
wise decision in not cancelling the
Hendricks concert as well.
Any pairing of the Duke's
beautiful tunes and the powerful,
energetic voice of Jon Hendricks
is bound to be a treat, and
Saturday night was no exception.

Duke was forced to cancel his
scheduled Sacred Concert here on
that date.
Saturday night in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, as part of the "Salute
to Duke Ellington" (the only
segment which was presented),
jazz singer-lyricist-San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Jon
Hendricks sang a program of
Ellington numbers to an
"intimately-sized" audience.
Backed more than capably by
pianist Larry Vukovitch's trio,
with Ratso Harris (bass) and
Benny Barth (drums), Hendricks
sang such Ellington classics as
"Solitude," "Mood Indigo,"
"Caravan," and "Satin Doll."
After the trio's rendition of
"Things Ain't What They Used To
Be," Hendricks took the stage
with his wife Judith and Bob
Mays to sing Duke's theme "Take
The 'A' Train" written by Billy
Strayhorn.
Hendricks, Kendricks, and
Mays suffer a good deal from
comparisons with Hendricks'
former scat trio, Lambert,
Hendricks, and Ross. Judith
Hendricks is no match for Annie
Ross, although her impersonation
of Cootie Williams' trumpet solo

on "In A Mellotone" was nice.
On Hendricks' solo vocals Mays
replaced Harris on bass fiddle — a
mistake because Harris was the
better of the two.
Hendricks is possibly the best
scat singer around of the few that
are left. Standing slightly hunched
over an invisible saxophone, his
hands in front of him forming the
notes, Hendricks crooned,
screamed, wailed, and blasted out
"sax solos" ranging in sound from
the late tenor great Ben Webster
to baritone saxophonist Harry
Carney to the late Johnny
Hodges' alto.
During one such solo, in
"C-Jam Blues," Hendricks didn't
quite reach a high note, so he
stepped back to tighten the
"mouthpiece" before proceeding
on to a few more fine choruses.
On the whole, the concert was
very well balanced, with several
highlights and few low spots.
Vukovitch soloed on two slow
numbers, "Sophisticated Lady"
and "Passion Flower," which were
perhaps the highest points in the
show. Vukovitch is an extremely
versatile pianist, and obviously has
a great deal of empathy for the
Duke.
Although Hendricks seemed
more at home improvising a scat
solo than singing lyrics to a set
melody, his most outstanding
performances came on two of
Ellington's most beautiful ballads,
"Do Nothing Till You Hear From

Me (Concerto for Cootie)" and"I
Let A Song Go Out Of My
Heart," with Hendricks' voice at
its best of the night, nearly
matching the original rendition by
Joy a Sherrill.
Had ley Caliman, used
all-too-sparingly on tenor sax,
nearly stole the show on the few
numbers he was able to stretch
out on, most notably "It Don't
Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got
That Swing)" and "Perdido."
Caliman, a Bay Area mainstay,
played in a style reminiscent of
John Coltrane, but sometimes
dipped back to the days of
Coleman Hawkins for some real
gut-buckset blues.

But, the highpoints of the
show were of course the songs
themselves, all written by the
master, Duke Ellington.
As trumpeter Miles Davis once
said, "I think all of the musicians
should get together one day, and
get down on their knees to thank
Duke."
When Duke Ellington's
Stanford appearance had to be
cancelled, the ASSU made a very
wise decision in not cancelling the
Hendricks concert as well.
Any pairing of the Duke's
beautiful tunes and the powerful,
energetic voice of Jon Hendricks
is bound to be a treat, and
Saturday night was no exception.
On Monday, April 29, Edward
Kennedy "Duke" Ellington,
America's greatest contribution to
the world of music, turned 75
years of age.
Unfortunately, due to illness,
Duke was forced to cancel his
scheduled Sacred Concert here on
