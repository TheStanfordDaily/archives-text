# Doc Watson Sunday
## 
### 
Doc Watson is regarded by some as the greatest country-folk
guitarist alive. His flat-picking and finger-style guitar licks have
continually delighted and amazed his listeners since he was
brought to the public's attention in the late fifties, during the
"folk revival."
With his huge repertoire, Doc can run the gamut of folk
styles nearly full-cycle, including blues, Country & Western,
fiddle tunes from Appalacia, folk songs from modern
composers, and even an occasional Elvis-type rockabilly
number.
Blind since birth, Doc also plays banjo and harmonica,
always in an informal relaxed manner no matter how large or
small the audience. He is as much a storyteller as a singer.
This Sunday, May 5, Doc Watson and his son Merle (another
truly fantastic guitarist—banjoist) will perform in Frost
Amphitheater at 2:00, along with Gordon Lightfoot. Tickets are
$3.50, on sale at Tresidder Box Office.
