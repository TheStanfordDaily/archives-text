Nixon Fights Subpoena
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's lawyer
said yesterday he will move to quash a
Watergate prosecution subpoena for 64
additional White House tapes.
He would not say whether Nixon would
abide by an adverse Supreme Court decision
should the tape battle come to that.
Facing today's deadline for responding to the
subpoena from special prosecutor Leon
Jaworski, Nixon defense attorney James D. St.
Clair held a broad-ranging news conference in
which he discussed Nixon's reason for making
public more than 1200 pages of edited
transcripts of Watergate tapes.
He also disclosed that the House Judiciary
Committee seeks more than 140 additional
tapes for its impeachment inquiry.
Discussing the Jaworski subpoena, St. Clair
argued that the massive public release of
transcripts by Nixon Tuesday strengthens his
effort to have the subpoena quashed. He said he
will move on two grounds:
— "Especially now, clearly the prosecution
must have enough evidence to proceed to try
these cases. And knowing Mr. Jaworski, I am
confident that he wouldn't have indicted these
people if he didn't think he had enough
evidence to convict them."
— Acknowledging that the White House has a
duty to make available materials that would be
helpful to the defendants, he said, "everything
we know of is in that book [transcripts]. What's
exculpatory is there."
Sadat May Ask U.S. Arms
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt — President Anwar
Sadat said yesterday night he is fully confident
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger will work
out a Syrian-Israeli disengagement pact on the
Golan Heights.
Sadat also said he may take up with Kissinger
the possibility of U.S. arms supplies for Egypt,
but that the subject had not been discussed yet.
Two weeks ago Sadat announced that Egypt was
ending its 18-year reliance on Russia for
weapons.
He charged the Soviets with making long
delays in promised arms shipments and with
trying to use arms as a club to control Egypt's
foreign policy.
Sadat stressed that Syrian President Hafez
Assad "has the final word" with Kissinger about
a Syrian-Israeli troop separation on the Golan,
but added: "We are discussing all the

possibilities."
Egyptian sources said the only two remaining
stumbling blocks are a way of linking
disengagement to further steps toward peace
and the question of who controls three vantage
points west of Mt. Hermon which look down on
Syrian and Israeli positions.
However, American sources cautioned there
was no deal in the offing and predicted
negotiations would be protracted.
Earlier Sadat told a May Day gathering in
Helwan that critics of his increasingly friendly
relations with Washington were "fanatics" and
"political teenagers." As he spoke Kissinger and
his wife Nancy took a relaxed two-hour tour of
ancient Roman ruins here, and hundreds of
Egyptians waved at them and applauded.
Convict Appeals To SLA
HILLSBOROUGH — An imprisoned founder
of the Symbionese Liberation Army appealed
through kidnaped heiress Patricia Hearst's father
yesterday for her release to speak around the
country about the SLA's revolutionary goals.
Clifford "Death Row Jeff" Jefferson,
self-proclaimed SLA founder, talked by
telephone with Patricia's father, Randolph A.
Hearst, and urged that the woman be
immediately freed.
Jefferson, speaking from the California
Medical Facility at Vacaville where he is serving
a sentence for killing another inmate, spoke of
Patty Hearst as "Comrade Tania," a name she
said in a recent SLA tape she had adopted. The
20-year-old coed renounced her family and said
she was joining her abductors.
"There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever
that Comrade Tania freely and voluntarily
joined the SLA," Jefferson said in the taped
message released by the Hearst family.
Senate Rejects New Controls
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted 57 to 31
yesterday to kill an attempt to revive wage-price
controls on a standby basis for another year.
However, it adopted 44 to 41 another part of
an anti-inflation package advanced by three
Democratic senators which would give President
Nixon power to monitor price and wage hikes
through the Cost of Living Council or some
other agency.
The President also would have authority to
enforce commitments made by industries when
they entered into decontrol agreements.
The Nixon administration said earlier
yesterday that it will seek to enforce
anti-inflation commitments made by several
hundred business firms, even though its wage
and price controls program has expired.
A White House statement, prepared but not
issued, said the Cost of Living Council will
continue as an economy monitoring agency
through June 30, with authority to gather
information on wages and prices.

But it said it was abolishing immediately the
Committee on Interest and Dividends, a group
which has sought to restrain dividend payments
by corporations and interest charges by banks
on consumer loans.
The White House decided late in the day
against issuing its statement on the economy,
but said it would possibly have the statement
today. Information on the decision to abolish
the Committee on Interest and Dividends was
contained in an advance copy of the statement
obtained by the Associated Press.
Mideast Battle Continues
JERUSALEM — Syrian and Israeli gunners
traded artillery barrages along the entire length
of the 40-mile Golan Heights front yesterday,
the eve of Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger's fifth peace mission to the Middle
East.
The Israeli military command reported three
Israeli soldiers were wounded in the shelling,
bringing Israel's casualty toll in the 51 days of
fighting on the front to 40 dead and 103
wounded.
Syria claimed its forces destroyed one Israeli
tank and an arms dump today in clashes before
dawn on the Golan Heights. It also reported
"artillery duels continued without letup on Mt.
Hermon."
A communique in Damascus said Syrian and
Israeli patrols clashed with machine guns and
grenades and "our heavy artillery pounded
enemy tank concentrations in various sectors of
the front."
Spectators Barred From Court
SIOUX FALLS, S.D. - Faced by the
possibility of another bloody courthouse battle,
Circuit Court Judge Joseph Bottum apparently
will bar spectators from his courtroom when
jury selection resumes tomorrow for five Custer,
S.D., defendants.
About 20 American Indian Movement
members and supporters were forcibly removed
from Bottum's courtroom Tuesday after they
refused to stand when the judge entered. AIM
contends Bottum is prejudiced against Indians.
Two dozen members of the Sioux Falls
Tactical Squad, wearing riot helmets and armed
with yard-long clubs, cleared the courtroom
after a violent 10-minute battle with the
Indians.
Five persons were arrested. Police said four
officers were injured, none seriously. One of
those protestors injured, David Hill, was
hospitalized and at last a half-dozen others were
seen with head wounds.
Dock Workers Return To Work
SAN FRANCISCO — West Coast dock
workers will return to work today while their
union and shippers discuss a demand for a

cost-of-living salary adjustment, the Pacific
Maritime Association said last night.
Pacific ports from San Diego to Seattle were
shut down yesterday morning when 12,000
dock workers walked out to demand the return
of a 30-cent per hour wage hike denied them by
the federal government two years ago.
The agreement for the dock workers to
return to work came after a s'/2-hour negotiating
session ending yesterday night.
There was no elaboration on the statement
that there "shall be a return to work as of May 2
and the parties will immediately discuss the
union's proposal for a cost-of-living
adjustment."
Eight hours after federal wage and price
controls expired at midnight Tuesday, the dock
workers obeyed their union's order for a work
stoppage.
It was a move designed to win back 30 cents
slashed by the federal pay board from a 62-cent
per hour wage increase negotiated after a
1971-72 strike that lasted 134 days, the longest
in American mainland shipping history.
Transcripts Sell Out
WASHINGTON — President Richard Nixon's
private utterances proved to be a best-seller
yesterday as the government's initial
700-volume supply sold out in three hours.
When the Government Printing Office
bookstore opened its doors at 8 a.m., two dozen
government employees, lawyers, businessmen,
journalists and tourists were lined up, eager to
buy a piece of history hot off the press.
Customers paid $12125 for each of the
blue-bound, three pound copies. Some bought
as many as 25 volumes for gifts, office libraries,
collector's items and bedside reading.
The supply had been expected to last all day,
but more volumes are being printed, according
to GPO spokesmen. They hope 5000 copies will
be available in GPO bookstores in 19 cities by
next week.
Today's Weather
Low clouds clearing this morning otherwise

Lows tonight in the low 40s to low 50s. Highs
