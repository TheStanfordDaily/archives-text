# Stanford Trustee Pleads Guilty To Illegal Contribution Charges
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Stanford trustee Thomas V. Jones
yesterday pleaded guilty to criminal
charges that he illegally used corporate
funds to finance contributions to
President Nixon's re-election
campaign.
Jones, chairman and chief executive
officer of the Northrop Corp. — a
Beverly Hills aerospace concern — was
fined $5000 by Washington U.S.
District Court Judge George L. Hart
Jr. He could have been sentenced to
up to five years in prison.
Northrop Corp. itself was also fined
$5000, and Northrop Vice President
James Allen pleaded guilty to a lesser
charge and was fined $1000.
In a two-count indictment released
yesterday, the Watergate Special
Prosecutor's office charged Jones with
"aiding, abetting, counseling and
commanding" the corporation to give

some $150,000 to the Finance
Committee for the Re-election of the
President and its California branch
between March 16, 1972 and March 4,
1974.
1940 Law
The contributions violated a 1940
law, never before invoked, barring
political contributions where the
contributor is a major government
contractor.
Hart indicated that a factor in his
decision not to sentence the
defendants to jail was that the law had
never before been used.
However, he said, "if there ever
comes before me a case on or after this
date of this nature, somebody most
certainly will go to jail."
According to the indictment, the
$150,000 in company funds was paid
to a European consultant associated
with Northrop, who then made the

contributions.
However, at least $50,000 found its
way back to Jones, who turned it over
to presidential attorney Herbert W.
Kalmbach in July, 1972. The cash was
later used as support money for the
seven original Watergate defendants.
In sworn testimony before the
Senate Watergate Committee last
summer, Kalmbach said he received
$75,000 from Jones. The Northrop
executive, however, has maintained all
along that the sum was actually
$50,000, and that he had no idea what
the money would be used for.
Last summer, Jones issued a
statement declaring that the Kalmbach
contribution was "a personal one,
made with my own funds." Yesterday,
a Northrop spokesman admitted to the
Daily that the contribution came from
part of the $150,000 in corporate
money.
'No Idea'
The spokesman said he had "no
idea" how the money that was
supposedly tunneled through the
European consultant had wound up
with Jones. Jones himself was
unavailable for comment.
According to the government, some
$100,000 of Jones' personal funds was
used to replace the illegally
contributed money on Jan. 25 of this
year.
There was little immediate campus
reaction to the Jones plea yesterday.
President Richard Lyman could not be
reached for comment, and the
University issued no statement.
Jones, 53, has been a Stanford
trustee since 1968, and also served as a
trustee of the California Institute of

Technology. A 1942 Stanford
graduate, he became president of
Northrop in 1960 and chairman three
years later.
The Northrop Corp. board of
directors said in a statement that Jones
would remain in his post with the
company:
"It has been determined that the
best interests of the corporation, its
shareholders, its employees and its
customers will best be served by the
continued leadership of Mr. Jones."
The Northrop annual shareholders'
meeting, previously scheduled for May
7, has been postponed until July 31
"in order that a revised proxy
statement may be distributed
reporting fully on these events and on
the reforms instituted within the
company to prevent their repetition."
