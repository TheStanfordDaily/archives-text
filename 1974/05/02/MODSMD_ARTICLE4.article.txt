# House Committee Rejects Nixon's Edited Transcripts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sharply
splitting along party lines, the House
impeachment inquiry voted last night
to tell President Nixon he has "failed
to comply" with its subpoena for
Watergate tapes.
The committee approved, 20 to 18,
with only one Republican joining
Democrats in voting to send Nixon a
letter saying that he has failed to
comply by publicly releasing edited
transcripts rather than turning over
subpoenaed tapes. Two Democrats
joined Republicans in voting no.
Rep. Jerome R. Waldie, D-Calif.,
laid groundwork for possibly citing
noncompliance as an impeachable
offense against the President in the
future.
Waldie asked special impeachment
counsel John Doar if the President's
willful refusal to comply with the
House subpoena is an impeachable
offense and Doar replied: "1 believe it
could be an impeachable offense under
these circumstances."
But Republicans contended that
President Nixon has substantially
complied with the subpoena by
publicly releasing transcripts that they
contended in some cases are better
than the tapes themselves.
'Good Faith'
"We should accept the material in
good faith and make further
representations in the future if

necessary," said the committee's
senior Republican, Edward
Hutchinson of Michigan.
The President has supplied the
committee with a great deal of
information, said Rep. Robert
McClory, Republican of Illinois, "that
is a substantial and adequate response
to our subpoena."
But chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr.,
D-N.J., said "the President has not
complied with our subpoena."
Not Transcripts
"We did not subpoena an edited
White House version of partial
transcripts of portions of presidential
conversations," Rodino said. "We did
not subpoena presidential
interpretation of what is necessary or
relevant for our inquiry. And we did
not subpoena a lawyer's argument
presented before we have heard any of
the evidence."
The committee approved a simple
letter proposed by Rep. Harold D.
Donohue, D-Mass., to the President
from Rodino saying that as of 10 a.m.
Tuesday, the subpoena's deadline,
"You have failed to comply with the
committee's subpoena."
Earlier in the evening, Rodino had
rejected Nixon's proposal that only he
and Hutchinson verify the transcripts
released by the White House. Rodino
said he would not listen to the tapes
