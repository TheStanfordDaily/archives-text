# Flores Claims Politics Involved In Tenure Decision
## 
### J.R. SULLIVAN 
Claiming that he is being
discriminated against on the basis of
his political views, German Studies
j»»st. Prof. John (Juan) Flores is
fighting the decision of Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Halsey
Rovden denying him tenure.
Acting Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Lawrence Ryan claims that
Flores, once on the Central Committee
( " the now defunct Maoist group
Venceremos, "has not provided
sufficient evidence of continued
scholarly publication to warrant
promotion."
The German Department will
probably seek a review of Royden's
decision, according to German Studies
< ,'iairman Walter Lohnes.
But Flores insists that publication is
not why he was denied tenure. "The
real reason is that 1 have consistently
spoken out against the owners of this
University, the Board of Trustees, and
what they stand for. The capitalist
owners of Stanford do not like that
k.Md of criticism and they dictated my
removal," Flores said.
Flores also noted that he has
participated in campus protest
demonstrations.

When Royden issued his decision in
February, Lohnes asked for a
clarification of the ruling.
In response, Ryan wrote on April
19 that "only one review article and a
book based on a dissertation" was not
enough work to warrant promotion.
Ryan pointed to a steady state in
faculty size and a limited number of
positions available for appointments to
the tenured rank associate professor
"as contributing factors."
Ambiguities
But many supporters of Flores
claim that these explanations leave
many ambiguities unanswered.
They say that it is unclear how
much publication is needed for tenure
and whether there is any kind of
trade-off between quantity and quality
of publications. Flores' supporters
would also like to know the formula
used by the Appointments and
Promotions Committee (A&P) for
determining qualifications for tenure.
Confidential
Appointments and promotions is
traditionally a confidential part of a
university's procedure, according to
Lewis W. Spitz, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences. Teaching,
publication and contributions to

university life are the only three
factors known to be involved in the
procedure, Ryan said. If the
department recommends tenure to the
dean, the case goes before the A&P.
After the German Department
unanimously recommended Flores to
the A&P, the committee advised the
dean that the German Studies
Department was not justified in
recommending Flores. Roy den
concurred with their opinion.
Negative Decisions
"About one out of three assistant
professors recommended by their
departments are denied tenure,"
according to Spitz. Lohnes admitted
that in the last few years, "the rate of
negative decisions has increased, due
to the stabilization of faculty size."
But further explanation is needed
in the case of Flores, because he is one
of the few radical professors left at
Stanford, according to German Studies
Prof. Peter Foulkes.
"In the matter of Flores, who is
well known for his left-wing views, we
need both a general account of the
principles and criteria, and an
explanation of how they were applied
in this particular case," Foulkes said.
"When a faculty member has been

honest and open about his
commitment to political beliefs which
are popular neither nationally nor
locally, it becomes imperative that
justice not merely be done, but that it
is seen to be done."
Prejudice
Flores said that since he cannot yet
prove assertions of political prejudice
on the part of the University, he is
using the formal procedure to try to
obtain a review. He has three
objectives in following this action.
First and most important, he hopes
to get a review and overturn the
denial. Second, he wants to find
evidence of political prejudice against
him, and third he hopes to have the
dean define what is required for
tenure, in order that other junior
faculty members become aware of
what is expected of them.
Lohnes said that "some kind of
machinery will be set up in which Mr.
Flores will get a review." Last year,
the English Department got a review
for two of its junior faculty who were
denied tenure at first. Both cases
resulted in a reversal of denial.
These reviews were granted by the
dean, however, only when new
evidence was brought into each case.

Appointments and promotions is
traditionally a confidential part of a
university's procedure, according to
Lewis W. Spitz, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences. Teaching,
publication and contributions to

university life are the only three
factors known to be involved in the
procedure, Ryan said. If the
department recommends tenure to the
dean, the case goes before the A&P.
After the German Department
unanimously recommended Flores to
the A&P, the committee advised the
dean that the German Studies
Department was not justified in
recommending Flores. Roy den
concurred with their opinion.
Negative Decisions
"About one out of three assistant
professors recommended by their
departments are denied tenure,"
according to Spitz. Lohnes admitted
that in the last few years, "the rate of
negative decisions has increased, due
to the stabilization of faculty size."
But further explanation is needed
in the case of Flores, because he is one
of the few radical professors left at
Stanford, according to German Studies
Prof. Peter Foulkes.
"In the matter of Flores, who is
well known for his left-wing views, we
need both a general account of the
principles and criteria, and an
explanation of how they were applied
in this particular case," Foulkes said.
"When a faculty member has been

honest and open about his
commitment to political beliefs which
are popular neither nationally nor
locally, it becomes imperative that
justice not merely be done, but that it
is seen to be done."
Prejudice
Flores said that since he cannot yet
prove assertions of political prejudice
on the part of the University, he is
using the formal procedure to try to
obtain a review. He has three
objectives in following this action.
First and most important, he hopes
to get a review and overturn the
denial. Second, he wants to find
evidence of political prejudice against
him, and third he hopes to have the
dean define what is required for
tenure, in order that other junior
faculty members become aware of
what is expected of them.
Lohnes said that "some kind of
machinery will be set up in which Mr.
Flores will get a review." Last year,
the English Department got a review
for two of its junior faculty who were
denied tenure at first. Both cases
resulted in a reversal of denial.
These reviews were granted by the
dean, however, only when new
evidence was brought into each case.

NO TENURE — German Prof. Juan Flores is currently appealing the University'?
decision not to grant him tenure.
Claiming that he is being
discriminated against on the basis of
his political views, German Studies
j»»st. Prof. John (Juan) Flores is
fighting the decision of Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Halsey
Rovden denying him tenure.
Acting Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Lawrence Ryan claims that
Flores, once on the Central Committee
( " the now defunct Maoist group
Venceremos, "has not provided
sufficient evidence of continued
scholarly publication to warrant
promotion."
The German Department will
probably seek a review of Royden's
decision, according to German Studies
< ,'iairman Walter Lohnes.
But Flores insists that publication is
not why he was denied tenure. "The
real reason is that 1 have consistently
spoken out against the owners of this
University, the Board of Trustees, and
what they stand for. The capitalist
owners of Stanford do not like that
k.Md of criticism and they dictated my
removal," Flores said.
Flores also noted that he has
participated in campus protest
demonstrations.

When Royden issued his decision in
February, Lohnes asked for a
clarification of the ruling.
In response, Ryan wrote on April
19 that "only one review article and a
book based on a dissertation" was not
enough work to warrant promotion.
Ryan pointed to a steady state in
faculty size and a limited number of
positions available for appointments to
the tenured rank associate professor
"as contributing factors."
Ambiguities
But many supporters of Flores
claim that these explanations leave
many ambiguities unanswered.
They say that it is unclear how
much publication is needed for tenure
and whether there is any kind of
trade-off between quantity and quality
of publications. Flores' supporters
would also like to know the formula
used by the Appointments and
Promotions Committee (A&P) for
determining qualifications for tenure.
