## If USE Strikes... 
### 
Viae Kershner

Beneath the angry rhetoric of United Stanford Employees (USE)
leaders and the calmer, but no less partisan, statements of University
spokesmen,there lie substantive differences on many issues.
But if USE members, as expected, vote to strike tomorrow, it will
probably be because of one reason—money. On a dollars-and-cents
level, USE wants the University to raise its payroll 22.75
percent—from $13 to about $16 million per year for the 1400
workers in the bargaining unit.
The University's offer, giving the average worker a 6V6-7 percent
raise, would only increase the payroll about $750,000. So, for the
first year of the contract alone, the two sides are an estimated $2.2
million apart.
The University's offer proposes the continuation of the current
system of offering raises on "step" and "merit" bases. Briefly, as a
worker gains seniority, he moves up the steps automatically. When he
or she nears or reaches the top, raises are offered on a merit base. In
addition, the pay for each level rises by a relatively small percentage
each year.
USE's proposed method of structuring raises is based on the much
different concepts of minimum pay, cost-of-living bonuses and a
community standards clause.
Minimum Pay
The minimum pay section of the proposal calls for a bottom line of
$600 per month. Currently, the minimum for the lowest paid
classification, a food service I worker, is $408. USE President Jim
Berk considers this minimum to be a method of "racist" exploitation
of the third-world workers who fill these jobs.
Even the University considers the current minumum embarrassingly
low. So its offer, by eliminating the bottom steps in the six-step plan,
would provide each worker with a minimum of $504.
The resulting difference of $96 maximum per worker is hardly a
high-cost item, and makes up little of the total differential between
the two sides. The issue is solvable. The University might be willing to
accede.
Cost-Of-Living
USE's second proposal, a cost-of-living escalator clause, calls for
pay for all workers to increase by $6 per month per point increase in
the consumer price index retroactive to Sept. 1,1973, the first day of
the new contract. USE proposes this flat rate increase because, in its
opinion, the CPI largely measures price rises in necessities for which
workers of all incomes must spend similar amounts.
The proposal would jack up the University payroll by an estimated
5.5 percent during the first year, a substantial sum but not one so
large that compromise (the University opposes retroactivity) would be
impossible.
Once again, it seems as if this issue can be successfully settled by
effort on both sides. Unfortunately, the third USE proposal, that of a
community standards clause, appears to defy attempts at amicable
solution.
USE wants Stanford to raise wages on a job-for-job basis to the
75th percentile of that workers outside the University are making.
Because this would entail a 33 percent increase in the University r s
payroll, the union has said that this can be done in four years—still a
heftv 8.3 percent increase per annum.
Different Views
The union's rationale is that since the University is not a
profit-making corporation which has to hold wages down, it should
try to pay its workers fairly. The 75th percentile was chosen, Berk
explains, because jobs at the University generally call for a wider
variety of skills than do outside jobs.
The University gulps at this. The main reason is, of course,
financial. Most of the workers who would receive large increases due
to this clause are in higher income ranges. And why should an
institution pay more than the going rate to middle-income workers?
USE won't easily drop this proposal, as if it did, it would mean
that lower income workers would receive much larger percentage
raises than skilled ones, who would be underpaid. And the University
won't accede to it, as, over four years, it might cost $10 million.
Both sides have valid points, and a workable compromise will be
hard to reach.
Still, the reason I think there will be a strike is not because it's
inevitable given the differences of the two interests. If there is a strike,
it will be because both sides have been playing the power game, and
haven't been saying "well, you have a good point and so do I, now
how can we settle this."
Well, happy striking. I wonder if the union can drive the University
to its knees before Stanford makes the workers come back begging.

percent—from $13 to about $16 million per year for the 1400
workers in the bargaining unit.
The University's offer, giving the average worker a 6V6-7 percent
raise, would only increase the payroll about $750,000. So, for the
first year of the contract alone, the two sides are an estimated $2.2
million apart.
The University's offer proposes the continuation of the current
system of offering raises on "step" and "merit" bases. Briefly, as a
worker gains seniority, he moves up the steps automatically. When he
or she nears or reaches the top, raises are offered on a merit base. In
addition, the pay for each level rises by a relatively small percentage
each year.
USE's proposed method of structuring raises is based on the much
different concepts of minimum pay, cost-of-living bonuses and a
community standards clause.
Minimum Pay
The minimum pay section of the proposal calls for a bottom line of
$600 per month. Currently, the minimum for the lowest paid
classification, a food service I worker, is $408. USE President Jim
Berk considers this minimum to be a method of "racist" exploitation
of the third-world workers who fill these jobs.
Even the University considers the current minumum embarrassingly
low. So its offer, by eliminating the bottom steps in the six-step plan,
would provide each worker with a minimum of $504.
The resulting difference of $96 maximum per worker is hardly a
high-cost item, and makes up little of the total differential between
the two sides. The issue is solvable. The University might be willing to
accede.
Cost-Of-Living
USE's second proposal, a cost-of-living escalator clause, calls for
pay for all workers to increase by $6 per month per point increase in
the consumer price index retroactive to Sept. 1,1973, the first day of
the new contract. USE proposes this flat rate increase because, in its
opinion, the CPI largely measures price rises in necessities for which
workers of all incomes must spend similar amounts.
The proposal would jack up the University payroll by an estimated
5.5 percent during the first year, a substantial sum but not one so
large that compromise (the University opposes retroactivity) would be
impossible.
Once again, it seems as if this issue can be successfully settled by
effort on both sides. Unfortunately, the third USE proposal, that of a
community standards clause, appears to defy attempts at amicable
solution.
USE wants Stanford to raise wages on a job-for-job basis to the
75th percentile of that workers outside the University are making.
Because this would entail a 33 percent increase in the University r s
payroll, the union has said that this can be done in four years—still a
heftv 8.3 percent increase per annum.
Different Views
The union's rationale is that since the University is not a
profit-making corporation which has to hold wages down, it should
try to pay its workers fairly. The 75th percentile was chosen, Berk
explains, because jobs at the University generally call for a wider
variety of skills than do outside jobs.
The University gulps at this. The main reason is, of course,
financial. Most of the workers who would receive large increases due
to this clause are in higher income ranges. And why should an
institution pay more than the going rate to middle-income workers?
USE won't easily drop this proposal, as if it did, it would mean
that lower income workers would receive much larger percentage
raises than skilled ones, who would be underpaid. And the University
won't accede to it, as, over four years, it might cost $10 million.
Both sides have valid points, and a workable compromise will be
hard to reach.
Still, the reason I think there will be a strike is not because it's
inevitable given the differences of the two interests. If there is a strike,
it will be because both sides have been playing the power game, and
haven't been saying "well, you have a good point and so do I, now
how can we settle this."
Well, happy striking. I wonder if the union can drive the University
to its knees before Stanford makes the workers come back begging.
