On Indian Jewelry
Stanford University should be
disgraced for permitting the sale
of American Indian jewelry in the
Bookstore by a commercial Indian
store from Hollywood. It
continues the exploitation of
Indians by white traders.
The jewelry was substantially
overpriced and inferior in quality.
Much of the turquoise was not
natural but treated. Worse, an
Indian silversmith receives about
$50 for a bracelet selling for $350
by a dealer.
The Bookstore, if it did want
to have Indian jewelry, could have
arranged a sale by the Navajo Arts
and Craftguild or the Hopi Crafts
Guild. Both guilds are Indian
cooperatives. The Indian
silversmith receives 80 percent of
the retail price for his jewelry,
which is priced substantially less
than a white dealer's price. Thus
an Indian would have received
something like $280 for a $350
bracelet; instead he got $50.
I would urge those people who
purchased jewelry from the

Bookstore inquire about the
quality of their pieces so they
might know what they really got.
Then they should request a refund
from the store and buy good
quality jewelry through one of
the Indian guilds.

Housing Question
Editor:
I have a simple question that
I'd liked answered. I've played the
bureaucracy game, and after half a
dozen phone calls and referralsl've
given up, hoping someone out
there in Daily land can come up
with the answer. There is a very
apparent housing shortage on
campus and there is also a $300
million fund raising campaign
going on. Put two and two
together and one has my
question: how much, if any, of
that money is earmarked toward
the building of additional
on-campus housing?
