# Draft Should Be Dismantled Forever
## 
### 
Bill Evers 2

Last week a 19-yearold man was
sentenced in North Carolina to 26 months in
prison after being convicted in federal court
of refusing to register for the draft.
Bruce A. Baechler had been indicted after
he notified the Orange County, N.C., draft
board one day before his eighteenth birthday
on March 28, 1973, that his religious beliefs
would not permit him to comply with the
law.
He was arrested by Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents in Washington, D.C., on Jan.
22 while attending a Quaker prayer meeting.
Perhaps, you believed that the draft had
ended in the United States. This is not the
case. Draft calls have ended.
Registration Required
But the requirement that 18-year-old
males register still exists and is enforced. The
draft lottery still takes place every year.
People with low lottery numbers are still
classed 1-A. No, the draft system is not yet
ended as the case of Bruce Baechler makes
clear.
Dismantle Draft
The reason the draft should be opposed and
the entire draft machinery dismantled forever
is the fundamentally involuntary nature of
the whole process.
Washington Post columnist Nicholas von
Hoffman once wrote: "This kind of
compulsion is involuntary servitude, in short,

slavery." Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz. has
opposed the draft as an attack upon "man's
most fundamental right and
responsibility ... to live his own life." Sen.
Robert A. Taft also denounced the draft as
"absolutely opposed to the principles of
individual liberty."
In contrast, the principle behind a
volunteer armed force is making the pay and
working conditions in the military attractive
enough that the desired number of recruits
sign up. This also does away with the
tremendous hidden tax (the difference
between earnings as a civilian and the army's
old slave wages) formerly paid by draftees.
Hidden Tax Explained
Consider the case of a young man who
would volunteer for the military at a wage of
$10,000 per year or more. If he were drafted
and paid $6000 per year, he personally
would be bearing a $4000 cost of defense
which would not appear in the defense
budget.
Since draft calls ended, proponents of the
draft, like the New York Times, have been
criticizing the all-volunteer armed force.
While many of the proponents of the draft
favor compulsory means on philosophical
grounds, much current debate centers on the
practical implementation of the volunteer
scheme.
A study written last year by two staff
members of the Brookings Institution

provides the answers to many of the practical
questions that have been raised.
In the view of the Brookings consultants,
the recent monthly "shortfalls" in recruiting
are not critical. The quality of the new
recruits is holding up well, although the
military may have set quality standards too
high for certain tasks and thus distorted
quality figures.
In addition, according to the Defense
Department, the Air Force has so many
volunteers that, through selection, it is taking
in the highest-quality recruits in its history.
Objectives Met
During the last four months, the Army has
met 95 percent of its recruiting objectives.
But there are real problems in Army
recruiting. The root of the problems is the
fact that most Pentagon officials would
prefer a draft, yet the same Pentagon officials
are the men who must devise and supervise
the new recruiting policies to attract
volunteers.
This conflict of interest impedes
successful recruiting and offers many
opportunities for sabotage of the volunteer
system.
As a matter of justice, the efforts of the
proponents of conscription to revive the
system must be defeated, and the machinery
of conscription must be destroyed.

While many of the proponents of the draft
favor compulsory means on philosophical
grounds, much current debate centers on the
practical implementation of the volunteer
scheme.
A study written last year by two staff
members of the Brookings Institution

provides the answers to many of the practical
questions that have been raised.
In the view of the Brookings consultants,
the recent monthly "shortfalls" in recruiting
are not critical. The quality of the new
recruits is holding up well, although the
military may have set quality standards too
high for certain tasks and thus distorted
quality figures.
In addition, according to the Defense
Department, the Air Force has so many
volunteers that, through selection, it is taking
in the highest-quality recruits in its history.
Objectives Met
During the last four months, the Army has
met 95 percent of its recruiting objectives.
But there are real problems in Army
recruiting. The root of the problems is the
fact that most Pentagon officials would
prefer a draft, yet the same Pentagon officials
are the men who must devise and supervise
the new recruiting policies to attract
volunteers.
This conflict of interest impedes
successful recruiting and offers many
opportunities for sabotage of the volunteer
system.
As a matter of justice, the efforts of the
proponents of conscription to revive the
system must be defeated, and the machinery
of conscription must be destroyed.

Last week a 19-yearold man was
sentenced in North Carolina to 26 months in
prison after being convicted in federal court
of refusing to register for the draft.
Bruce A. Baechler had been indicted after
he notified the Orange County, N.C., draft
board one day before his eighteenth birthday
on March 28, 1973, that his religious beliefs
would not permit him to comply with the
law.
He was arrested by Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents in Washington, D.C., on Jan.
22 while attending a Quaker prayer meeting.
Perhaps, you believed that the draft had
ended in the United States. This is not the
case. Draft calls have ended.
Registration Required
But the requirement that 18-year-old
males register still exists and is enforced. The
draft lottery still takes place every year.
People with low lottery numbers are still
classed 1-A. No, the draft system is not yet
ended as the case of Bruce Baechler makes
clear.
Dismantle Draft
The reason the draft should be opposed and
the entire draft machinery dismantled forever
is the fundamentally involuntary nature of
the whole process.
Washington Post columnist Nicholas von
Hoffman once wrote: "This kind of
compulsion is involuntary servitude, in short,

slavery." Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz. has
opposed the draft as an attack upon "man's
most fundamental right and
responsibility ... to live his own life." Sen.
Robert A. Taft also denounced the draft as
"absolutely opposed to the principles of
individual liberty."
In contrast, the principle behind a
volunteer armed force is making the pay and
working conditions in the military attractive
enough that the desired number of recruits
sign up. This also does away with the
tremendous hidden tax (the difference
between earnings as a civilian and the army's
old slave wages) formerly paid by draftees.
Hidden Tax Explained
Consider the case of a young man who
would volunteer for the military at a wage of
$10,000 per year or more. If he were drafted
and paid $6000 per year, he personally
would be bearing a $4000 cost of defense
which would not appear in the defense
budget.
Since draft calls ended, proponents of the
draft, like the New York Times, have been
criticizing the all-volunteer armed force.
While many of the proponents of the draft
favor compulsory means on philosophical
grounds, much current debate centers on the
practical implementation of the volunteer
scheme.
