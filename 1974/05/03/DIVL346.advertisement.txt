A -the film that ran for 3 continuous years in one theatre V
A in Cambridge, Mass.
In an isolated surreal pocket of World War I, the British send
M, Alan Bates into a highly unlikely, tiny French town to discover
A a bomb. The townspeople have fled and the inmates of the
focal asylum have taken their place. The resulting interaction
gives us some of the most enchanting sequences on film. When
the reality of the returning armies breaks the bubble and the
m. inmates have returned to the asylum, we can really share Bates'
A confusion about which people are really insane. In our opinion,
M. KING OF HEARTS is a rare treat; funny and sad at the same time.
Past audiences will vouch for this, and we know you will too.
