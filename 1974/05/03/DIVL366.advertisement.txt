City feet need Roots.
Sport Root Tee-Root.
Rocker Sole
In natural stride, weight moves from the heel, along the outer
side of the foot then diagonally across to the big toe, which
springs you off on your next step. Roots rocker sole helps this
shift in weight, making every footstep just a little less tiring.
Supported Arch
The city sidewalk can be a real arch-enemy. And fallen arches
hurt. Roots are contoured to support the arch and the small
recess between th«* balls of your feet.
Recessed Heel
Walk on sand and your heels will leave the deepest part of your
footpring. In natural walking, most of your weight lands on
your heel. Conventional shoes—even low-heeled shoes—tilt you
forward and change your basic posture. In Roots, your heel
sinks into a comfortable recess, giving you a natural walk on
any kind of surface.
