# Faculty Senate Nixes Vote Weight Scheme
## 
### DON COX 
The controversial weighted-voting
scheme recommended in the
Professoriate report was tentatively
rejected yesterday by the Faculty
Senate.
The weighting scheme, designed to
reduce the impact of schools with
large faculty bodies and small student
enrollment, would weight Academic
Council members' votes in relation to
the number of students enrolled in
their respective schools.
During informal committee of the
whole action, the Senate voted
overwhelmingly in a non-binding straw
poll to delete the provision.
The vote represented a major
reversal in opinion by the Senate
which voted overwhelmingly last
month to accept the scheme.
Persuasive Speech
Many Senate members cited SLAC
Prof. Burton Richter's speech to the
Senate during last week's session as
one of the persuasive forces
responsible for their change in attitude
about the weighting system.
Richter said last week that the
system would make him "40 percent
of a faculty member."
"I will not be voted to be 40
percent of a professor without a
corresponding decrease in my service
to, and concern for, the University,"
he said.
History Prof. Gordon Craig and
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch
agreed with Richter yesterday and
noted that most Senate decisions
appealed to the Academic Council
were of general concern to the

University and the professional
schools.
Issues Predictable?
President Lyman objected and said
he did "not share the confidence that
the last six years would predict the
next six in the kinds of issues that will
be encountered."
Vice Provost Robert Rosenzweig
said that the weighting scheme arises
out of a fear of block voting and
"assumes the existence of units that
are not only intensely cohesive, but
also have different outlooks" on the
University.
"This prospect of block voting is
inflated and doesn't take into account
the large differences in opinion in
different schools," he said.
