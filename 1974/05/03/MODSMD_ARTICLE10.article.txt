# Kent State Killings And Humanity

Tomorrow marks the fourth anniversary
of the killings at Kent State University by
members of the Ohio National Guard. It is
fitting, particularly in light of the national
day of reflection and prayer declared by
Congress and the Governor last Tuesday, to
consider where we stand relative to those
awful days in May, 1970.
From the point of view of justice, much
has transpired, especially within the last five
weeks, to sound a note of encouragement.
On March 29 a federal grand jury in
Cleveland indicted eight Guardsmen, charging
them with violating the civil rights of the
students. As Robert Bacon noted (Daily,
April 3) the likelihood remains high that
those charges will not stick because of the
delay in obtaining the indictments.
Nevertheless, the trial would itself be
curative, bringing forth the inquiry into Kent
State which has too long been kept out of
a court of law.
Second Action
Greater success at trial is likely to occur in
a second action whose way was cleared by
the Supreme Court on April 17. The high
court ruled that the parents of three of the
four students killed at Kent State had the
right to sue the former governor of Ohio,
James Rhodes, the head of the state national
guard and members of the guard, as
individuals, for civil damages.
Chief Justice Burger, wiring for a
unanimous court, rejected the conclusions of
lower courts that the actions violated a
constitutional ban on suing a state and that
state officials were immune from damage
suits for discretionary acts within the scope

of their authority.
As Mrs. Bernard Miller, the mother of one
of the slain students, said after the court's
decision was announced, "We're delighted
that the Supreme Court has proved once
again that our system of justice, while not
perfect, is very alive and well."
No 'Sovereign Immunity'
Indeed, if the sustaining of these civil suits
proves anything, it signals all public officials
that they cannot expect to find absolute
protection under the cloak of sovereign
immunity for any act done in furtherance of
what they claim to be their job.
The arrival of a new attorney general and
an enlightened Supreme Court decision may
suggest substantial progress in the litigation
of suits arising out of May 4. But they say
nothing about how well American society has
come to grips with the terrible fact that on
that day we turned the guns of the state on
an unarmed crowd of college students and
fired peint blank.
Perhaps those scenes of murder are best
left to generations who can review them with
the dispassion of hindsight. But to take such
a tack is in a sense to deny a part of what was
happening in this country not so long ago.
Senseless Killings
To my mind the Kent State and Jackson
State shootings, as well as those senseless
student killings at Orangesburg and Southern
University, point to the danger of viewing
one's victim not as a person but as a thing.
No individual, seized by the stark reality
that he was about to fire at innocent
bystanders, could have discharged his rifle.
Only by relying on a subjective intuition,
twisted by inner fear and support from those

officials in charge, could one kill on behalf of
the state in cold blood.
The guardsmen who committed the
murders were not much older than their
victims, and it would be fair to suggest that
many shared world outlooks similar to the
students.'
Official Order 'Awesome'
Yet there is something awesome about an
official order to fire, a drive which confounds
common sense and even basic human
instincts. What made these men killers was
not a meanness of spirit; we all possess that.
Rather, it was their inability to keep that
spirit in check, to remember that their
victims did not constitute a rock-throwing
mob, but were individuals like themselves.
The inevitable result of this mob rule
psychology in reverse coupled with the
frightful power of the M-l rifle, was the
killing of innocent students.
We do well to remember that those
students were not much different than most
of us â€” they were all out on the Kent State
green that day simply to learn about the
campus protest over the Cambodian
incursion. But just as the students' lawful
assembly resembled those convened at
Stanford, so too should we be mindful of the
similarity between the guardsmen and
ourselves.
We all have the tendency to abstract those
we fear or dislike. If Kent State recalls
anything, it should be the danger of losing
sight of the humanity which resides in every
enemy.
