# Let Republicans Support McCloskey
##

I am concerned with the
current "Register Republican for
McCloskey" drive on campus.
Although this campaign is being
conducted with good intentions, I
take issue with the tactics being
used.
I should explain the position
from which I am writing. I am a
registered Democrat (in another
state), consider myself to be
liberal politically, and am a strong
supporter of our country's
two-party system. I am very
concerned with the present state
of our government, and I fully
endorse the President's
impeachment.
As for Pete McCloskey, I have
heard him speak at a number of
constituents' meetings, and not
only do I agree with his stands on
many issues, but I think he is a
good man — given the
opportunity, I probably would
not hesitate to vote him back into
office.
Yet this present campaign
bothers me, for two reasons. First,
there seems to be a double
standard here. McCloskey is often
asked why he isn't a Democrat,
considering his somewhat liberal
views and his charges against the
President.

McCloskey, and the few men like
them who not only believe in the
underlying principles of the
Republican party, but also choose
to stay in the party and to make
their stand, trying to effect some
real change through reform of the
party's policies, rather than taking
the easy way out by changing
parties.
McCloskey is right in seeing
this as a "cop-out." But then he
expects Stanford students,

unregistered, Independent, and
Democratic alike, to change their
status, to even switch parties, for
the sole purpose of voting in the
Republican primary — with the
simple option, of course, of
"switching back" as soon as
the primary is over.
I think that this type of double
standard is wrong.
Party System Forgotten?
My second concern is that
McCloskey appears to have
forgotten the purposes of our
American two-party system. He
has decided to run not as a
Democrat, not as an Independent,

but as a Republican in
November's election.
To represent the Republicans,
though, he must receive a
mandate from his fellow party
members showing that they want
him to represent their party in
that election — this is the purpose
of the primary.
Is it right, then, that
McCloskey should urge students
who have no stake in the
Republican party, who do not
wish to remain Republicans, who
may even disagree with the party's
principles, to register as
Republicans, simply to "tip the

balance" towards McCloskey? Are
these the people who should
represent the Republican party? I
think not.
Again, I don't want to see
McCloskey lose in the primary,
nor in the Congressional election
in November. But I say that the
choice of Republican candidates
should be left to members of the
Republican party, and that the
students should throw their full
support behind McCloskey when,
and if, the Republicans select him
to represent thier party in the
Congressional race.
