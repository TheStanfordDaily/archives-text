Julia Harvey's article (Daily, April 25) about
Stanford's medical and health benefits contained
several inaccuracies that need to be corrected.
Specifically—
The Palo Alto Unified School District does not
pay the costs of medical or dental insurance for
employees' dependents.
Government grants do not provide >l extra"
funds to pay the costs of employee benefits.
Government grants provide funding for performing
the proposed research including the compensation
of employees working under the grant — wages,
salaries and benefits.
Three Health Options
Stanford offers a choice of three basic health
plans to all employees who work 20 hours a week
or more on a continuing basis. Stanford now
contributes $18.32 a month for each
employee-subscriber working 75 percent time or
more. Half-timers enroll at their own cost but with
the savings of lower group rates which are possible
because the University collects the monthly
premiums and provides substantial administrative
support.

All currently employed staff over age 65 and
retired former staff over age 65 have Major
Medical paid for by Stanford for their lifetime.
Stanford does not require employees over age 65 to
have Medicare B or Blue Cross 65 or the Kaiser
equivalent in order to obtain Major Medical
coverage. Employees with Medicare Band
accompanying Blue Cross or equivalent
supplemental coverage do qualify for the $100
deductible.
Stanford employees who voluntarily terminate
before age 65 to retire early do not lose all their
benefits. The University makes Major Medical
coverage available with these employees paying the
cost of their coverage only for the time between
early retirement and age 65.
About one-fourth of the 4700 University staff
members participating in Stanford's three base
health plans are enrolled in the United Medical
Clinic's Plan. Half are enrolled in the Blue Cross
and the other one-fourth are subscribers to the
Raise* Plan.
