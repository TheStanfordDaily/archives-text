# Don't Change To GOP

Jo an Hinman

Over the past few weeks you've
probably been buttonholed at
least once by a zealous supporter
of Congressman Paul N. "Pete"
McCloskey, R—Menlo Park.
McCloskey's troops have been
canvassing the campus in an effort
to get Democrats, out-of-state
voters and the unaffiliated to
become Republicans in order to
vote for McCloskey in the June
primary.
This column will frankly try to
persuade you to register
Democratic.
California has suffered for
eight years under the leadership of
Ronald Reagan. One try at
removing Reagan from office
failed largely because of
factionalism within the
Democratic leadership of the
state.
This year's race for the
governorship looks deceptively
easy, with Republican leadership
seemingly scattered and
Democratic hopefuls campaigning
fiercely for the June primary.
Without a strong Republican
leader, the Democrats may seem
assured of winning in November.
Three Democrats
However, the three major
Democratic contenders — San
Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto,
Secretary of State Edmund G.
Brown, Jr. and Assembly Speaker
Bob Moretti — could split the
Democratic allegiances of voters
so severely that either bitter
feelings or total confusion could
result.
Indeed, the state AFL-CIO
Council on Political Education
endorses all three major
candidates and Rep. Jerome
Waldie, D—Contra Costa. This in
the eyes of many Democrats
amounts to no endorsement at all.
It is doubtful that more liberal
Democrats would support Alioto
if he received the nomination in
June; it is also doubtful that
Alioto's supporters would
wholeheartedly support Brown,
Moretti or Waldie.
Call it Hubert Humphrey
emerging from the national
non-convention of 1968, or call it
McGovern fall-out after the 1972
convention — if Democrats don't
show a strong preference for a
reasonable man in June, the
Republicans might easily take
advantage of the resulting chaos
and creep back to the governor's
mansion.
Reagan To White House?
Obviously, this may not seem
too important to students from
out of state, but everyone would
be wise to consider that the
California governorship may be
providing Ronald Reagan with a
backdoor to the White House.
There are other important
Democratic races which should be
considered before registering.
Stanford is in the new 21st
Assembly district which has no
incumbent.
The 21st Assembly seat is
totally open, and could therefore
tip the balance between
Republicans and Democrats in the
state Assembly.
The candidates in the 21st
district are: William B. Black, a
former East Palo Alto
councilman; J. Ken Croft, 1970
Democratic Assembly
candidate; Santa Clara County
Supervisor Victor J. Calvo; and
Herbert Rhodes, an East Palo Alto
councilman.
Riles Also Running
State Superintendent of
Schools Wilson Riles, a black
elected despite the best efforts of
Ronald Reagan in a bitter 1970
race against arch-conservative
incumbent Max Rafferty, is also
up for reelection.
McCloskey's multitudes will
try to persuade you that these
Democratic races, particularly the
ones involving Riles and Sen. Alan
Cranston, D—Calif., are not as
important as the McCloskey race.
In the Watergate Election Year,
1974, McCloskey wants us to
believe that refinement of
Republican leadership is necessary
to the survival of the two-party
system.
Back home in California, the
refinement of Democratic
leadership can reinforce the gains
made in the Senate and Assembly
since 1970, and assure four years
during which the legislature and
the governor will not try to veto
and override each other out of
existence.
The refinement of California's
Democratic leadership is necessary
to the unity of the most populous
state over the next eight years.
That may be worth more than one
congressional seat.

In the Watergate Election Year,
1974, McCloskey wants us to
believe that refinement of
Republican leadership is necessary
to the survival of the two-party
system.
Back home in California, the
refinement of Democratic
leadership can reinforce the gains
made in the Senate and Assembly
since 1970, and assure four years
during which the legislature and
the governor will not try to veto
and override each other out of
existence.
The refinement of California's
Democratic leadership is necessary
to the unity of the most populous
state over the next eight years.
That may be worth more than one
congressional seat.

Over the past few weeks you've
probably been buttonholed at
least once by a zealous supporter
of Congressman Paul N. "Pete"
McCloskey, R—Menlo Park.
McCloskey's troops have been
canvassing the campus in an effort
to get Democrats, out-of-state
voters and the unaffiliated to
become Republicans in order to
vote for McCloskey in the June
primary.
This column will frankly try to
persuade you to register
Democratic.
California has suffered for
eight years under the leadership of
Ronald Reagan. One try at
removing Reagan from office
failed largely because of
factionalism within the
Democratic leadership of the
state.
This year's race for the
governorship looks deceptively
easy, with Republican leadership
seemingly scattered and
Democratic hopefuls campaigning
fiercely for the June primary.
Without a strong Republican
leader, the Democrats may seem
assured of winning in November.
Three Democrats
However, the three major
Democratic contenders — San
Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto,
Secretary of State Edmund G.
Brown, Jr. and Assembly Speaker
Bob Moretti — could split the
Democratic allegiances of voters
so severely that either bitter
feelings or total confusion could
result.
Indeed, the state AFL-CIO
Council on Political Education
endorses all three major
candidates and Rep. Jerome
Waldie, D—Contra Costa. This in
the eyes of many Democrats
amounts to no endorsement at all.
It is doubtful that more liberal
Democrats would support Alioto
if he received the nomination in
June; it is also doubtful that
Alioto's supporters would
wholeheartedly support Brown,
Moretti or Waldie.
Call it Hubert Humphrey
emerging from the national
non-convention of 1968, or call it
McGovern fall-out after the 1972
convention — if Democrats don't
show a strong preference for a
reasonable man in June, the
Republicans might easily take
advantage of the resulting chaos
and creep back to the governor's
mansion.
Reagan To White House?
Obviously, this may not seem
too important to students from
out of state, but everyone would
be wise to consider that the
California governorship may be
providing Ronald Reagan with a
backdoor to the White House.
There are other important
Democratic races which should be
considered before registering.
Stanford is in the new 21st
Assembly district which has no
incumbent.
The 21st Assembly seat is
totally open, and could therefore
tip the balance between
Republicans and Democrats in the
state Assembly.
The candidates in the 21st
district are: William B. Black, a
former East Palo Alto
councilman; J. Ken Croft, 1970
Democratic Assembly
candidate; Santa Clara County
Supervisor Victor J. Calvo; and
Herbert Rhodes, an East Palo Alto
councilman.
Riles Also Running
State Superintendent of
Schools Wilson Riles, a black
elected despite the best efforts of
Ronald Reagan in a bitter 1970
race against arch-conservative
incumbent Max Rafferty, is also
up for reelection.
McCloskey's multitudes will
try to persuade you that these
Democratic races, particularly the
ones involving Riles and Sen. Alan
Cranston, D—Calif., are not as
important as the McCloskey race.
