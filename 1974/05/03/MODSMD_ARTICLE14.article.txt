Ira Hall, a member of the
University's Board of Trustees,

director of the Stanford
Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition.
Hall, who graduated from here
in 1966, with a degree in electrical

Hall has been executive
director of the Coalition since
1968. The Coalition works
through task forces of volunteers
in areas such as fair housing, law
and justice, health and economic
development.
Hall said that he came to the
Coalition five years ago, when it
was just starting, to help establish
the organization. "I am convinced
that the organization is now
established," he told the Daily.
Due to an intense recruiting
campaign last year, the Coalition
now has more than 400 members.
Hall noted that he had
originally placed a five-year Limit
on his job with the Coalition. He
said that he mentioned the
possibility of resigning about a
year ago to the Coalition's Board
of Directors, but just recently
decided to make the
announcement public.
Hall's term as a University
trustee expires this June, and he
said the he does not plan to run
again. "The purpose of the trustee
elections [by the alumnij is to
introduce new people on a
periodic basis," he said.
