# German Graduate Students To Stage One-Day Walkout
## 
### DON COX 
A dozen graduate students in the
German Studies Department decided
yesterday to hold a one day walkout
Wednesday to protest the
"intolerable" wages they receive.
The graduate students, all of whom
teach at some time during their
four-year Ph.D. program, assert they
are not paid adequately for the
teaching they do.
The main area of conflict between
the graduate students and the
administration is that "they [the
administration] refuse to classify what
we do as work," said German graduate
student Dorothy Rosenberg.
"Graduate students do a high
percentage of the teaching and the
University needs them," she said.
"[Dean of Graduate Studies
Lincoln] Moses flatly denies we're
working for money and it's getting
hard for us to understand why he
doesn't think we're working for the
University," said German graduate
student Jim Coleman.
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Studies J.
Merrill Carlsmith told the Daily
yesterday that "University philosophy
is to make it possible for graduate
students to be able to pursue their
studies.
"It is not to provide adequate
wages, but to subsidize graduate
studies," he said.
Current Compensation
Graduate students in the German
Department currently receive up to
$2100 and tuition for two years and
$3150 and tuition for the years in
which they teach (up to two years),
according to Rosenberg. In addition,

financial assistance is sometimes
available during summers.
"They don't seriously expect you
to live on $2100 a year, but expect
you to supplement this with loans or
something," said Rosenberg.
"I do not agree that all graduate
students should be forced to go $7000
to $10,000 in debt," said German
graduate student Woody Williams.
' Rosenberg agreed that "it's
unreasonable to demand that high a
level of debt.
No Certainty
"With the present uncertainty in
the job market, there is no guarantee
that you will be able to pay them
back. I don't know why they are
demanding a four-year Ph.D. program
and then making it so hard to get one
in four years," she said.
Carlsmith said, "Students are able
to live on the current stipend."
However, he contended, "It's not a
large amount of money and some may
find it difficult to live on it."
Carlsmith said he doubted that
many students are forced to go $7000
in debt.
The graduate students complained
that they could not engage in any
substantial off-campus work since they
cited a clause in their support contract
that restricted the amount of
off-campus work they could do.
Wrong Priorities
"We realize that the University is in
a tight financial situation but we also
realize that they have priorities and wje
object to those priorities," since we
are not high enough on the list, said
Rosenberg.
