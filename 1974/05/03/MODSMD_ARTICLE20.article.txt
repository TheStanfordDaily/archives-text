# Early Music Consort of London
## Old Music Delights Crowd 
### KENNETH DeLONG 
Through the efforts of the
Early Music' wing of the Stanford
Music Department, an audience
now exists in Palo Alto ready to
savor the delights of a pre-Bach
repetoire. The extent of this
support was evident last Friday
night by the capacity crowd
which turned out to hear The
Early Music Consort of London.
The Early Music Consort of
London consists of five men who
combined their musical talents in
a program devoted to popular
music covering five centuries â€”
from 1100 through 1600 A.D.
The program's success was the
result of the cheerful and even
humorous musical numbers
performed by a group of players
possessing a discreet flair for the
theatrical. Although dressed in
tuxes replete with mauve
cummerbunds, the group soon
softened its severe image and
seemed thoroughly to enjoy
presenting its kaleidoscope of
musical styles and moods.
Unfamiliar Instruments
Despite my connection with
Stanford's Early Music program,
several instruments were
decidedly unfamiliar. Most
remarkable was the crwth, a
bowed lyre of medieval extraction

that appeared to be related in
shape to the modern bathroom
scale. Even in these enlightened
days, it is rare to hear music
played on a gemshorn, a citole or
a kortholt.
Apart from these more unusual
instruments, the Consort
concentrated upon the more usual
sets of viols, recorders,
crumhorns, dulcians etc.
One of the great delights was
the singing of countertenor James
Bowman. His voice is clear and
expressive, and remarkably free of
the Dellerisms normally associated
with falsettists. The songs,
presented with great animation
and excellent tuning, were among
the most enjoyable selections of
the evening.
Specialist Members
Each of the other members of
the Consort specializes in a
particular instrumental family.
David Munrow, the director,
played all manner of wind
instruments and proved to be a
phenomenal recorder player. His
performance of a Fourteenth
Century Istampitta complete with
virtuoso embellishments was a
great crowd-pleaser and a high
point of the evening.
James Tyler played lute and
viols, as well as helping out with

crumhorns and recorders. His
special skill is with the plucking
instruments, and he revealed the
considerable extent of his mastery
in a fine performance of a 16th
century Piva by Dalza. The Piua, a
lively Italian dance, was a set of
written-out improvisations over a
drone, and took the performer to
dizzying heights of virtuosity.
Obscure Music
The music was by and large
obscure, but was always highly
characteristic. Since the program
was so excellently chosen and
paced, it is difficult to single out
particular highlights.
Nevertheless, special mention
must be made of the Gloria in
cielo that concluded the first half.
This piece, performed by the
whole Consort, had a distinct
Moorish flavor and was filled with
terrific energy and zest.
In response to the thunderous
ovation, the Consort played two
encores by Henry VIII of England
which included some witty and
well-chosen remarks by David
Munrow on the nature of the
King's composing technique.
In all, it was a first-rate concert
by a fine group of musicians. May
they have a speedy return to our
town.
