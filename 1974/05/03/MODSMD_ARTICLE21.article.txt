# n Excellent Night At S.F. Symphony
## Isaac Stern, Seiji Ozawa Play Violin, Toy Piano 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
SAN FRANCISCO - When
estro Seiji Ozawa walked onto
stage of the War Memorial
era House Wednesday evening
rying a flaming red toy piano,
audience roared with laughter.
Two hours later, the audience
red again — this time with
>lause and cheers for one of the
;st Bay Area orchestral
icerts of the past year.
One reason Wednesday's
»gram was such a success was
oist Isaac Stern, perhaps the
atest living violinist. A native
» Franciscan, Stern studied at
city's conservatory before
king his debut at 15 in 1937.
ce then he has made eighteen
>earances with the San
incisco Symphony.
Innumerable stints as soloist in
irly every major concert hall in
world has brought Stern
versal acclaim. Yesterday he
:ame the first person to receive
honorary doctorate from his
mer school.
Bela Bartok's First Violin
ncerto is scarcely great music,
>ugh filled with appealing
mories of Wagner and Strauss,
well as premonitions of the

composer's mature,
contrapuntally-oriented style.
Stern and Ozawa, however, took
the work seriously, lavishing care
on even weaker and less coherent
passages.
The first movement, for
instance, opens with a triple
canon for the soloist and both
first-desk violinists. Concertmaster
Stuart Canin and associate Peter
Schaffer matched Stern's devotion
and intensity, if not his
miraculous tone; together, the
three musicians displayed real
feeling and intelligence.
In the more chaotic second and
third movements, Ozawa guided
his ensemble through an
undergrowth of difficulties with
skill. Stern's second movement
cadenza was particularly
brilliant, and the work's
concluding moments brought
violinist and orchestra together
with a convincing, if muffled
bang.
Stern shone more brightly in
the gently lyrical Romance in F
Major by Antonin Dvorak. From
opening theme to caressing
conclusion, Stern played with a
tenderness of expression, a clarity
and simplicity of tone and

phrasing that were deeply moving
even in such comparatively slight
musical surroundings.
Before Stern's appearance,
however, Maestro Ozawa put that
red toy piano to good use in the
first of two performances of John
Cage's Suite for Toy Piano, which
opened the concert. Ozawa and
orchestra then performed Lou
Harrison's arrangement of the
same piece.
Much of John Cage's work is,
at best, nominally "art," but the
Suite is clever, even expressive
music cast in five movements
containing only the seven notes of
the C Major scale. Cage used ideas
borrowed from Indian ragas to
organize each movement around

particular melodic and rhythmic
phrases.
Ozawa, perched on a tiny
bench (which, in delightful
parody of concert pianists'
fidgetings, he "adjusted" several
times), played accurately and as
expressively as his instrument
permitted. The subsequent
orchestra performance was, of
course, warmer and more deeply
felt.
Perhaps no arrangement of
keyboard music I have ever heard
sounds so different from the
original as Harrison's score of the
Cage Suite. As an independent
work, though, it was attractive
and , accomplished, and the
instrumentalists under Ozawa's

charge played with enthusiasm
and elan.
Dvorak's Ninth Symphony
("From the New World") brought
the evening's music making to a
stunning conclusion. Too often
Dvorak's masterpiece has become
familiar through mediocre
performances which blur a solid
architectural outline and a Slavic
sense for instrumental theme and
color.
Ozawa's breathtakingly

powerful reading, on the other
hand, presented the work in terms
of both its intellectual and
emotional merits, clarifying and
intensifying the innate values of
the music itself. The
straightforward first movement,
for example, gained in impact
through a performance featuring
strong attacks, piquant phrasing,
and a sustained sense of
developing tension.
The "hackneyed" slow

movement was loveliness itself in
a singing performance that
emphasized melody and tone
instead of rhythmic articulation.
The concluding Scherzo and
Finale were masterful studies in
restrained violence brought to life,
violence which almost broke free
only in the work's final few
measures. Bravo!
