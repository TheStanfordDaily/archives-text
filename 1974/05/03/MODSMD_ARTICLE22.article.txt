# Photo Exhibit Offers Variety

### BARBARA HEINS 
An exhibition of 112 prints,
described by Leo Holub as a
"retrospective of an Unknown
Photographer," is now on view at
the Stanford Art Gallery.
The photographs offer a view
of the rich variety of Holub's
world as seen through the camera
lens. According to Holub the
beauty of photography is that it
"can take a complex subject . . .
and make it simple."
Viewing the black and white
prints makes one acutely aware of
carefully constructed
compositions, gradations of color
and varied textures found in
objects that usually go unnoticed.
It is only when they are captured
and frozen by the camera that
their beauty is apparent.
The camera makes us stop and
re-look at ourselves and our world
in much the same way that the
billboard eyes stare back at the
viewer in one of the prints. Holub
describes his particular method
saying, "I feel something about
each thing I photograph and make
a statement about it ... my style
is to render the way it is."
Many of the photographs are
purely descriptive: the many
views of San Francisco, the shots
contrasting the modern white
buildings, and the rough wooden
plants floating in the water.
Instead of concentrating on
one style and aspect of
experience, Holub moves from
wide complex viewing to the close
and intimate.
A series of nature close-ups are
among the most beautiful prints

in the exhibition. Drops of beaded
water lie on a blade of grass so
stark that it appears almost
abstract: in another an insect
appears to be part of the plant it
perches on.
The show is arranged in similar
groupings; views of Stanford with
dogs, water reflections, scenes of
San Francisco, cement decoration,
doll parts and behind-the-scene
workings of an artists' studio.
A humorous note is included
by a print of a tombstone which
reads, "Marko Rado, Leg buried

1926," dates reading,
"1891-1947."
Apart from subject matter, the
most enjoyable aspect of the show
is the realization that there is
nothing contrived or gimmicky in
Holub's photography. The works
are united in their clarity and
directness of vision.
The exhibition also includes a
room full of paintings in ceramic
by internationally known Particia
Scarlett. The various works
compose three groups: her
Introverted Box Series, Communal

Eating Plates and Icon Plates.
Scarlett uses the clay
background much as a painter
uses canvas. She paints slightly
art-nouveauish designs in color
glazes, firing the works several
times to achieve her desired
effects. The works are quite
unique and interestingly combine
the idea of functional craft and
art.
The exhibition of Holub's
photographs and Scarlett's
ceramics will be on view at the
Stanford Gallery through May 5.
