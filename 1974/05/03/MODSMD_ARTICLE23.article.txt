# Horace Silver Performs Jazz
## 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO-Jazz
pianist Horace Silver closed a
week-long engagement Sunday
night, April 28, at Keystone
Korner.
The 45-year-old Silver, who
served his sideman apprenticeship
for years with people like Stan
Getz, Lester Young, Coleman
Hawkins, and Art Blakey, now
heads a well-rounded, young
quintet featuring Bob Berg
(tenor), Tom Harrell (trumpet),
Alvin Queen (drums), and Michael
Richmond (bass).
Sidemen-soloists are essential
to Silver's format since he is not
noted for his own piano solos.
Saxophonist Berg's solos were
his "free-set," sounding quite a bit
like John Coltrane; (doesn't
everyone?). Harrell, a veteran of
the Woody Herman and Stan
Kenton bands, played beautifully
thought-out passages on both
trumpet and fluglehorn.
Silver's first set included only
three tunes, all fairly new,
exhibiting his soul-rock-influenced
style, lacking much individual
distinctions.
All three, "Barbara," "Kissin'
Cousins," and "Liberated
Brother," were uptempo, slightly
choppy, and almost
heavy-handed, as are the majority
of Silver's more familiar
compositions.
"Liberated Brother," written
by Weldon Irving, appears on
Silver's most recent Blue Note LP,
In Pursuit of the 27th Man, and
stands the best chance of being
remembered among Silver's
standards, such as "Senor Blues"
and "Song For My Father."
It was unfortunate that Silver's
first set included only these three
extended numbers, which were
somewhat similar to each other,
but variety is not, and never has
been, a primary element in the
Horace Silver jazz style.
In coming weeks, Keystone
Korner will bring Airto and
Fingers, the Ahmad Jamal Trio,
and the Ron Carter Quartet.

trumpet and fluglehorn.
Silver's first set included only
three tunes, all fairly new,
exhibiting his soul-rock-influenced
style, lacking much individual
distinctions.
All three, "Barbara," "Kissin'
Cousins," and "Liberated
Brother," were uptempo, slightly
choppy, and almost
heavy-handed, as are the majority
of Silver's more familiar
compositions.
"Liberated Brother," written
by Weldon Irving, appears on
Silver's most recent Blue Note LP,
In Pursuit of the 27th Man, and
stands the best chance of being
remembered among Silver's
standards, such as "Senor Blues"
and "Song For My Father."
It was unfortunate that Silver's
first set included only these three
extended numbers, which were
somewhat similar to each other,
but variety is not, and never has
been, a primary element in the
Horace Silver jazz style.
In coming weeks, Keystone
Korner will bring Airto and
Fingers, the Ahmad Jamal Trio,
and the Ron Carter Quartet.
