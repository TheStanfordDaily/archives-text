# Big-Time College Athletics
## Source Of Problem: The Four-Year Rule 
### PHILIP HEIMLICH Second of Four Parts 
In many college sports, such as
baseball and tennis, one rarely
hears of payoffs, huge recruiting
budgets or rule infractions. The
overwhelming majority of
violations occur in football and
basketball.
The reason for this can be
traced less to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
than to the professional football
and basketball leagues. For within
the bylaws of the National
Football League, National
Basketball Association, and
American Basketball Association,
there exists a clause known as the
four-year rule. Some observers
believe this rule is the source of
many of the irregularities plaguing

college sports today.
The four-year rule states that
no player may sign a pro contract
until he has passed four years
beyond his high school
graduation. (The NBA and ABA
have relaxed this somewhat in
certain "hardship cases").
The major sports leagues
suggest that the rule exists to
allow each youngster a chance to
finish his college education.
However, the fact that 50.4
percent of professional players
never graduate from college, does
not support this viewpoint.
While some players go back to
get their degrees, most do not.
The pros, like many college
athletic departments, appear to be
more interested in the athlete's
eligibility than his graduation.
What does the rule do for the
NFL, NBA and ABA? According
to a report by Sports Illustrated,
"it automatically creates a vast,
and free, farm system in which
future professionals can be
polished as performers and even
premerchandised as celebrities for
years before they move into the
big leagues."
The rule, in other words, saves
professional football and
basketball owners millions of
dollars they would otherwise have
to spend operating a minor-league
system similar to professional
baseball's. At the same time the
rule allows college athletic
departments to have
professionalized intercollegiate
athletic teams without "having to
pay their employees competitive
wages."
The only group whose rights
have been ignored by this

"gentlemanly agreement"
between the pro and college
sports establishments is that of
the undergraduate players. Since
the four-year-rule, in effect,
makes four years' attendance at
college a "prerequisite" for
employment as a professional
athlete, numerous young men are
forced to attend college.
Many of these athletes have no
reason to attend school but
athletics. Having little concern
over the academic qualifications
of the university, it is not
surprising that they are
susceptible to offers of money,
cars and other rewards dangled in
front of them by recruiters.
A collegiate baseball player, on
the other hand, is free to turn pro
at any time, and therefore is more
likely to be attending college
principally for academic reasons.
Once the athlete enters the
college of his choice, one of the
chief priorities of his school's
athletic department is to see that
he passes the minimum number of
units necessary to remain eligible.
This sometimes includes offering
such unique courses as elementary
badminton, elements of tumbling,
and Canadian geography.
Michigan State once offered a B.S.
degree with a major in mobile
homes.
Brain Coaching
Occasionally, more help is
needed. Most major universities
have an employee within the
athletic department who provides
athletes with "tutorial assistance."
Whether he is called the Brain
Coach at Texas or the Academic
Coordinator at Berkeley, his task,
points out former Syracuse

football star Dave Meggyesy, is
the same: "to keep athletes
eligible by whatever means
necessary, even if it involves
getting them an early look at
exams, or hiring graduate students
to write their term papers or to
take finals for them."
The athletic department's
concern for the player's welfare,
though, tends to expire about the
same time his eligibility does. The
free tutoring stops and an athlete,
Meggyesy goes on to explain,
"finds himself faced with a flock
of difficult classes which
somebody has put off to keep him
eligible."
Many, like James Street, never
graduate. Street, after leading
Texas to a national championship,
dropped all his courses six days
before final exams, claiming, "I
can't read a lick." Of the five
starters on Texasâ€”El Paso's 1966
NCAA championship basketball
team, none graduated.
License To Control
Many athletes regard their
scholarship as a contract which
allows the coaching staff to
control their personal appearance,
social life and political activities.

Under the NCAA's Manifest
Disobedience rule, aid can be
terminated to an athlete who is
involved in a protest or
demonstration.
More importantly, though,
they see this "contract" as not
being a very profitable one.
College athletic departments pay
athletes from $500 to $3000 per
year in the form of a scholarship
even though the players are
frequently spending as much time
on athletics as professional
athletes.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has said
that the major difference between
playing for UCLA and the
Milwaukee Bucks was that with
the Bucks he is paid over
$150,000 per year instead of
$100 a month plus tuition.
"If you took a football
scholarship, which covers room
board, tuition, books and laundry
money," said Rex Kern when he
quarterbacked Ohio State, "and
put it on a job scale, we probably
make less than a dollar an hour.
There are days you simply don't
want to do it."
