# Cal Downs Card Laxmen
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
The scene was all set for what
was to have been the Stanford
'acrosse team's first victory over
California in four years
Wednesday on the Stanford
lacrosse field. The beer keg was
flowing and there was even a
crowd led by a contingent from
the Stanford band.
The only thing missing was a
victory. The Bears erupted
for seven goals in the third period
to beat the Cards 14-8.
Stanford coach Sam Stadler
was amazed by the third period
collapse of the Card defense,
"They [Cal] beat us on fast
breaks, but seven fast breaks? It
.ure beats the hell out of me."
The cross-Bay rivals were tied
2-all in the first quarter. The
Cards would have led 3-2 except
for a controversial call at the end
of the quarter. Attackman Buzz
Haddow scored just as the first
quarter whistle sounded, but it
was ruled that although he fired
the shot with one second
remaining, the ball did not cross
the plane of the goal before the
clock ran out.
'That was a tough goal to
lose," said Stadler, "But we
should have been able to come
back from it,"he added.
The Card defense collapsed in
the third period. The only reason
California didn't score 20 points
was because they put in guys who
fired shots into near-by deGuerre
Pool.
Stanford held the Bears to two
goals in the fourth period. But the
Cards weren't able to hold
Ail-American Dick Graham down.
Graham led the Bear scoring
attack with five goals.
The Cards are now 4-2 in
league. Sunday Stanford will take
on Claremont in a 2 p.m. contest
here.
