# Cards Face Herculean Task, Must Sweep USC In L.A.
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
When USC's Trojans visited
Sunken Diamond last month
Stanford took two out of three
games from the defending NCAA
champions. This weekend that
performance won't be enough if
the Cardinals have any hopes of
winning the Pacific Eight
Southern Division.
The Cards, 6-6 in conference
play, need to win all three games
starting this afternoon at Dedeaux
Field on the USC campus. The
Trojans (9-3) just need one win to
hold a two-game lead with three
games left on the schedule.
"We're going to have to play
some emotional baseball," said
Stanford coach Ray Young. "It's
almost unrealistic to think about
sweeping the series. We just have
to play the games one at a time."
Stanford's A 1 Arthur (3-6) is
scheduled to pitch today,
probably against USC's ace Russ
McQueen.
The Cards, riding a four-game
winning streak, are playing
without the services of their top
pitcher, Dave Frost, who is out
indefinitely with tendonitis in his
pitching shoulder. Frost has been
plagued with injuries most of his
athletic career. He has been
hampered by pains in his lower
back this year. And, he was having
a fine season for Stanford's
basketball team when he quit to
play baseball because of strained
ligaments in his knee.
Another Card who isn't at full
strength is outfielder Bob

Hampton, who is hampered by a
strained achilles tendon. Hampton
leads the team with 41 runs
batted in and has hit six homers
this year.
Stanford's pitchers tomorrow
will be Mike Williamson (4-3),
who threw a one-hitter against
UCLA last Saturday, and Bernie
Hittner (3-2), who pitched in
Stanford's 10-6 come-from-behind
win at California Tuesday.
USC's probable pitchers are
Pete Redfern and Mark Barr or
John Racanelli of Palo Alto.
One of the few weak points of
USC this year has been a very
inconsistent pitching staff that has
been supported by some very
heavy hitting. Another flaw in the
Trojan lineup has been the
defense, according to USC's coach
Rod Dedeaux. Young agrees with

both diagnoses, saying, "USC's
pitching hasn't been that great."
Stanford's overall leading hitter
is Dave Baker, who had a good
weekend against UCLA to bring
his average up to .329 to displace
Kim Hannaford (.324). Other
Cards over .300 are Steve Davis
(.311), Mark Lucich (.305) and
freshman Gary Pitchford (.300).
Lucich leads the team with eight
homers.

is Dave Baker, who had a good
weekend against UCLA to bring
his average up to .329 to displace
Kim Hannaford (.324). Other
Cards over .300 are Steve Davis
(.311), Mark Lucich (.305) and
freshman Gary Pitchford (.300).
Lucich leads the team with eight
homers.
When USC's Trojans visited
Sunken Diamond last month
Stanford took two out of three
games from the defending NCAA
champions. This weekend that
performance won't be enough if
the Cardinals have any hopes of
winning the Pacific Eight
Southern Division.
The Cards, 6-6 in conference
play, need to win all three games
starting this afternoon at Dedeaux
Field on the USC campus. The
Trojans (9-3) just need one win to
hold a two-game lead with three
games left on the schedule.
"We're going to have to play
some emotional baseball," said
Stanford coach Ray Young. "It's
almost unrealistic to think about
sweeping the series. We just have
to play the games one at a time."
Stanford's A 1 Arthur (3-6) is
scheduled to pitch today,
probably against USC's ace Russ
McQueen.
The Cards, riding a four-game
winning streak, are playing
without the services of their top
pitcher, Dave Frost, who is out
indefinitely with tendonitis in his
pitching shoulder. Frost has been
plagued with injuries most of his
athletic career. He has been
hampered by pains in his lower
back this year. And, he was having
a fine season for Stanford's
basketball team when he quit to
play baseball because of strained
ligaments in his knee.
Another Card who isn't at full
strength is outfielder Bob

Hampton, who is hampered by a
strained achilles tendon. Hampton
leads the team with 41 runs
batted in and has hit six homers
this year.
Stanford's pitchers tomorrow
will be Mike Williamson (4-3),
who threw a one-hitter against
UCLA last Saturday, and Bernie
Hittner (3-2), who pitched in
Stanford's 10-6 come-from-behind
win at California Tuesday.
USC's probable pitchers are
Pete Redfern and Mark Barr or
John Racanelli of Palo Alto.
One of the few weak points of
USC this year has been a very
inconsistent pitching staff that has
been supported by some very
heavy hitting. Another flaw in the
Trojan lineup has been the
defense, according to USC's coach
Rod Dedeaux. Young agrees with

both diagnoses, saying, "USC's
pitching hasn't been that great."
Stanford's overall leading hitter
is Dave Baker, who had a good
weekend against UCLA to bring
his average up to .329 to displace
Kim Hannaford (.324). Other
Cards over .300 are Steve Davis
(.311), Mark Lucich (.305) and
