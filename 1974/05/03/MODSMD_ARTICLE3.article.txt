# Profs Differ On Nixon Strategy
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
President Nixon's recently released
transcripts of conversations with his
aides indicate that he gave a "clear
authorization" to permit the cover-up
of the Watergate scandal, according to
Law Prof. Thomas Grey.
"I am at a loss to see how what
Nixon said is ambiguous," Grey said.
"But I haven't yet read the 1200 pages
of transcripts and it is possible that the
full context of Nixon's conversations
would change my opinion."
But Political Science Asst. Prof.
Richard A. Brody told the Daily that
he could understand how a

"disagreement on the interpretation"
of Nixon's remarks could occur.
Although Brody noted that he has
an "active dislike" for Nixon, he
conceded that "it is possible that
Nixon was merely trying out ideas"
when he discussed the payoff of
Watergate defendant E. toward Hunt.
Political Science Prof. Robert Horn
generally agreed with Brody's analysis.
Language Inexplicit
"The conversations seem to
indicate that the White House should
pay off Hunt, but the language used
by Nixon was not direct and explicit,"
Horn stated.
It could be argued that Nixon was
merely worried that Hunt would make
dangerous disclosures about national
security rather than political scandal,
Horn noted.
"It is also possible that Nixon was
discussing ways to pay Hunt's legal
expenses rather than suggesting that he
be given hush money," Horn added, i
"The transcripts leave these matters
dangling."
Enforcement Impractical
Horn explained that although the
House Judiciary Committee requested
tapes rather than transcripts, "there is
no practicable way for the committee
to enforce its subpoena."
The committee could recommend
to the House that the President be
declared in contempt of Congress,
Horn said. However, the only real
sanction would be if the committee
declared his refusal to relinquish the
tapes an impeachable offense, he
added.
Horn said that he doubted the
committee would do so because
Nixon's refusal to give up the tapes is
not a sufficiently substantive matter to
warrant impeachment charges.
But Horn remarked that it is
possible the committee will eventually
use Nixon's refusal to respond to the
subpoena as one of a series of articles
of impeachment.
Transcript Influence
Horn said it is still too early to
determine what effect the release of
the transcripts will have on the
impeachment process.
"I don't know if the House will be
more likely to impeach Nixon," Horn
stated. "But if the House Judiciary
Committee decides that the President
has not committed an impeachable
offense it might still recommend to
the House that a vote of impeachment

be taken."
Horn explained that even if
committee members opposed
impeachment, they might want the
House to vote on the matter in order
to relieve the committee of
responsibility on a controversial
matter.
Horn said that committees usually
do not recommend that votes be taken
on matters of which they disapprove,
but he noted that the impeachment
process is not a usual procedure.
Unlike Horn, Grey contended that
the revelations of the transcripts make
Nixon more likely than ever to be
impeached.
"At this point, it would be
shocking if the House didn't impeach
Nixon," Grey said.
None of the three professors
expressed surprise at the content of
the transcripts.
"The conversations seemed
plausible," Brody said. "I am not
surprised that political judgments
dominated over moral judgments."
Brody said that Nixon's release of
the transcripts was calculated to make

impeachment a partisan matter.
"When he refused to surrender any
material Nixon drove the House
Judiciary Committee together," Brody
said. "But now votes regarding further
considerations will probably break
along strictly partisan lines."
Brody pointed out that on
Wednesday, the committee voted on a
nearly straight party line to insist that
Nixon comply with the subpoena
ordering him to turn over the 42 tapes.
Noting that 53 percent of the
Republicans polled in a recent Gallup
survey approve of Nixon's
performance in office, Brody said he
expects that percentage to rise as a
result of the release of the transcripts.
But the percentage of Democrats
supporting Nixon is likely to decline,
he stated.
Brody said he is not sure if the
House committee will recommend to
the House that an impeachment vote
take place.
Democrats will want to be certain
that they have a strong case against the
President before deciding to call for a
vote of impeachment, Brody declared.

Law Prof. Thomas Grey.
"I am at a loss to see how what
Nixon said is ambiguous," Grey said.
"But I haven't yet read the 1200 pages
of transcripts and it is possible that the
full context of Nixon's conversations
would change my opinion."
But Political Science Asst. Prof.
Richard A. Brody told the Daily that
he could understand how a

"disagreement on the interpretation"
of Nixon's remarks could occur.
Although Brody noted that he has
an "active dislike" for Nixon, he
conceded that "it is possible that
Nixon was merely trying out ideas"
when he discussed the payoff of
Watergate defendant E. toward Hunt.
Political Science Prof. Robert Horn
generally agreed with Brody's analysis.
Language Inexplicit
"The conversations seem to
indicate that the White House should
pay off Hunt, but the language used
by Nixon was not direct and explicit,"
Horn stated.
It could be argued that Nixon was
merely worried that Hunt would make
dangerous disclosures about national
security rather than political scandal,
Horn noted.
"It is also possible that Nixon was
discussing ways to pay Hunt's legal
expenses rather than suggesting that he
be given hush money," Horn added, i
"The transcripts leave these matters
dangling."
Enforcement Impractical
Horn explained that although the
House Judiciary Committee requested
tapes rather than transcripts, "there is
no practicable way for the committee
to enforce its subpoena."
The committee could recommend
to the House that the President be
declared in contempt of Congress,
Horn said. However, the only real
sanction would be if the committee
declared his refusal to relinquish the
tapes an impeachable offense, he
added.
Horn said that he doubted the
committee would do so because
Nixon's refusal to give up the tapes is
not a sufficiently substantive matter to
warrant impeachment charges.
But Horn remarked that it is
possible the committee will eventually
use Nixon's refusal to respond to the
subpoena as one of a series of articles
of impeachment.
Transcript Influence
Horn said it is still too early to
determine what effect the release of
the transcripts will have on the
impeachment process.
"I don't know if the House will be
more likely to impeach Nixon," Horn
stated. "But if the House Judiciary
Committee decides that the President
has not committed an impeachable
offense it might still recommend to
the House that a vote of impeachment

be taken."
Horn explained that even if
committee members opposed
impeachment, they might want the
House to vote on the matter in order
to relieve the committee of
responsibility on a controversial
matter.
Horn said that committees usually
do not recommend that votes be taken
on matters of which they disapprove,
but he noted that the impeachment
process is not a usual procedure.
Unlike Horn, Grey contended that
the revelations of the transcripts make
Nixon more likely than ever to be
impeached.
"At this point, it would be
shocking if the House didn't impeach
Nixon," Grey said.
None of the three professors
expressed surprise at the content of
the transcripts.
"The conversations seemed
plausible," Brody said. "I am not
surprised that political judgments
dominated over moral judgments."
Brody said that Nixon's release of
the transcripts was calculated to make

impeachment a partisan matter.
"When he refused to surrender any
material Nixon drove the House
Judiciary Committee together," Brody
said. "But now votes regarding further
considerations will probably break
along strictly partisan lines."
Brody pointed out that on
Wednesday, the committee voted on a
nearly straight party line to insist that
Nixon comply with the subpoena
ordering him to turn over the 42 tapes.
Noting that 53 percent of the
Republicans polled in a recent Gallup
survey approve of Nixon's
performance in office, Brody said he
expects that percentage to rise as a
result of the release of the transcripts.
But the percentage of Democrats
supporting Nixon is likely to decline,
he stated.
Brody said he is not sure if the
House committee will recommend to
the House that an impeachment vote
take place.
Democrats will want to be certain
that they have a strong case against the
President before deciding to call for a
vote of impeachment, Brody declared.
