# IM Roundup
## Bike Race Sunday 
### PETE BHATIA 
This Sunday at 12:30 p.m. the
1974 edition of the intramural
Bike Race will be held at the
Artificial Intelligence Center on
Arastradero Road. The race, a
ten-mile affair, will require each
entrant to complete 27 laps
around the quarter-mile course.
The entry deadline is 5 p.m.
today. Teams consist of five
riders, with the top three finishers
counting toward the final race
standings. Each organization is
allowed to enter one team.
Questions should be addressed to
race director Garth "Wheels"
Sherman at 497-1081.

In six-player volleyball, it
appears a rematch of last year's
playoffs is in the offing. Last
year's champions Theta Delt and
runnerup JBA both have
extremely strong teams and
appear destined to meet in the
finals. Among the two
organizations there are five
outstanding "A" teams, each
capable of reaching the finals.
JRA has three of the five teams
and the strongest is probably their
JRA A3 team. This team features

former Stanford Club player Kyle
Mashima as well as reknowned
Stanford idiot Buz Burr. You
might remember Buz from the
ill-fated "Jacks or Better"
basketball team.
Buz has switched sports now
and barring any injuries, like
running into the net, he should do
much better now.
IM volleyball director Bob
Rondeau has asked that all teams
turn in the results of their
matches to the IM office.

In softball, competition is so
strong that last year's champion,
Sigma Chi, fell from the unbeaten
ranks in the season's second week.
It lost to the Beta's 6-3.
Similarly, last year's
semifinalist Theta Delt dropped a
3-0 decision to Law 111 Monday.
Several teams have been very
impressive in the season's early
weeks. Among these undefeated
teams are the Betas, Biz I, and the
independent We M. Good.
In horseshoes, one of the more
grueling IM events, SAE
continued its determined march
towards the championship by
crushing JRA 11, 2-0.
