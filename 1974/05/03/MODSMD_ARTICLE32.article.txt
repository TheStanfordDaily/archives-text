# Red-White Game Tomorrow
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Jack Christiansen will be sitting alone in
the bleachers or leaning pensively against a
goalpost tomorrow when Stanford concludes
spring football drills with the annual
Red-White game at 1:30 p.m. in Stanford
Stadium.
Normally, the spring game doesn't mean
much or prove anything significant. The
coaching staff has usually completed its
serious evaluation of personnel, so the game
serves two purposes: providing a stage for the
players and a show for the fans.
But this year offers a glaring exception —
an exception certain to keep Christiansen
quiet and contemplative tomorrow and likely
to cause several sleepless summer nights.
The question is who is the Cardinal
quarterback.
For the first time since Jim Plunkett's
sophomore year in 1968, Stanford will bpgin
its season without a leading All-League
candidate at quarterback. Three sophomores,
however, all seem capable of continuing the
Plunkett-Don Bunce-Mike Boryla tradition.
Strong Points
Of Guy Benjamin, Mike Cordova and
Jerry Waldvogel (listed alphabetically),
Christiansen says: "Each has outstanding
qualities. Benjamin is the best pure passer,

Cordova is the strongest — the best at
running the option. Waldvogel is the best
mechanically and maybe the smartest."
All three have been equally impressive in
spring drills, leaving Christiansen in a
quandary. "Each has qualities you'd like to
use at different times in a football game," he
says, "But I think you have a better team if
you have a definite number-one
quarterback."
Tomorrow, Benjamin and Waldvogel will
split time with the White unit, while Cordova
shares the Red signal-calling duties with
transfer Bob Sotta.
"If one sticks his head that far above the
others in the spring game," Chris says, "I'd
like to make a choice. If it's possible I'd like
to go in with a definite quarterback in mind
when we start fall ball."
Late Selection?
If none of the three are spectacular
tomorrow, Christiansen says the final
decision may not be made until the first
league game against UCLA on Oct. 12.
Whoever gets the nod will be directing a
Cardinal squad essentially solid in every
department except the defensive backfield
and kicking game. Christiansen admits that
Rod Garcia's talents simply can't be replaced.
"A guy like that comes around every 100

years," Christiansen says, presumably
referring to Rod's behavior both on and off
the football field.
In the defensive backfield, where coach
George Seifert's foursomes have led the Pac-8
in pass defense three straight years, the
outlook is similarly bleak for matching past
performances. Still, Christiansen says he's
been "pretty well satisfied" with the
secondary's improvement during spring
practice.
Backup Corps
Elsewhere, Christiansen says spring drills
have been helpful in developing a backup
corps for the Cardinal front-liners. "It looks
pretty solid two-deep," he said, "especially
the defensive line and linebackers."
Tomorrow, Seifert, Pete Kettela and
Hudson Houck will direct the Red squad,
which features Cordova, Ron Inge, Eric Test
and Alex Karakozoff on offense and Pat
Donovan, Gordy Riegel and Doc Blanchard
on defense.
The White squad, coached by Dave
Currey, Norb Hecker and Gunther
Cunningham, includes Benjamin, Waldvogel,
Scott Laidlaw, Sig Ostrom, Todd Anderson,
Bill Singler and Tony Hill on offense, with
Roger Stillwell and Forrie Martin anchoring
the defense.


A TASTE OF THINGS TO COME — Stanford football fans who can't
wait until September to see stars such as All-American Pat Donovan
(83) perform are invited to view the annual Red-White football
scrimmage at Stanford Stadium at 1:30 tomorrow. Donovan, to the
dismay of the White offense, is on the Red squad.

Late Selection?
If none of the three are spectacular
tomorrow, Christiansen says the final
decision may not be made until the first
league game against UCLA on Oct. 12.
Whoever gets the nod will be directing a
Cardinal squad essentially solid in every
department except the defensive backfield
and kicking game. Christiansen admits that
Rod Garcia's talents simply can't be replaced.
"A guy like that comes around every 100

years," Christiansen says, presumably
referring to Rod's behavior both on and off
the football field.
In the defensive backfield, where coach
George Seifert's foursomes have led the Pac-8
in pass defense three straight years, the
outlook is similarly bleak for matching past
performances. Still, Christiansen says he's
been "pretty well satisfied" with the
secondary's improvement during spring
practice.
Backup Corps
Elsewhere, Christiansen says spring drills
have been helpful in developing a backup
corps for the Cardinal front-liners. "It looks
pretty solid two-deep," he said, "especially
the defensive line and linebackers."
Tomorrow, Seifert, Pete Kettela and
Hudson Houck will direct the Red squad,
which features Cordova, Ron Inge, Eric Test
and Alex Karakozoff on offense and Pat
Donovan, Gordy Riegel and Doc Blanchard
on defense.
The White squad, coached by Dave
Currey, Norb Hecker and Gunther
Cunningham, includes Benjamin, Waldvogel,
Scott Laidlaw, Sig Ostrom, Todd Anderson,
Bill Singler and Tony Hill on offense, with
Roger Stillwell and Forrie Martin anchoring
the defense.


A TASTE OF THINGS TO COME — Stanford football fans who can't
wait until September to see stars such as All-American Pat Donovan
(83) perform are invited to view the annual Red-White football
scrimmage at Stanford Stadium at 1:30 tomorrow. Donovan, to the
dismay of the White offense, is on the Red squad.
Jack Christiansen will be sitting alone in
the bleachers or leaning pensively against a
goalpost tomorrow when Stanford concludes
spring football drills with the annual
Red-White game at 1:30 p.m. in Stanford
Stadium.
Normally, the spring game doesn't mean
much or prove anything significant. The
coaching staff has usually completed its
serious evaluation of personnel, so the game
serves two purposes: providing a stage for the
players and a show for the fans.
But this year offers a glaring exception —
an exception certain to keep Christiansen
quiet and contemplative tomorrow and likely
to cause several sleepless summer nights.
The question is who is the Cardinal
quarterback.
For the first time since Jim Plunkett's
sophomore year in 1968, Stanford will bpgin
its season without a leading All-League
candidate at quarterback. Three sophomores,
however, all seem capable of continuing the
Plunkett-Don Bunce-Mike Boryla tradition.
Strong Points
Of Guy Benjamin, Mike Cordova and
Jerry Waldvogel (listed alphabetically),
Christiansen says: "Each has outstanding
qualities. Benjamin is the best pure passer,

Cordova is the strongest — the best at
running the option. Waldvogel is the best
mechanically and maybe the smartest."
All three have been equally impressive in
spring drills, leaving Christiansen in a
quandary. "Each has qualities you'd like to
use at different times in a football game," he
says, "But I think you have a better team if
you have a definite number-one
quarterback."
Tomorrow, Benjamin and Waldvogel will
split time with the White unit, while Cordova
shares the Red signal-calling duties with
transfer Bob Sotta.
"If one sticks his head that far above the
others in the spring game," Chris says, "I'd
like to make a choice. If it's possible I'd like
to go in with a definite quarterback in mind
when we start fall ball."
