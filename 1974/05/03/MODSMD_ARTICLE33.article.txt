# Spikers Attempt Big Meet Upset
## 
### MARK WHITE 
The pressure will be on Cal in
the 80th annual Big Meet this
Saturday in Berkeley, for the
Bears must contend with a
spirited underdog Stanford team
which, with a 1-4 dual meet
record, risks little in pulling out
all the stops in an upset bid.
The favored Bears, on the
other hand, see the Big Meet as
the acid test for establishing the
success of their season.
"I don't care what the final
score is, it could be 73-72 for all I
care, we have to win this meet in
order to consider our season a
success," Cal coach Erv Hunt told
the Daily.
"We had a special meeting
Monday to let the boys know that
this is the Big Meet and that we
can't take Stanford lightly. Too
many funny things have happened
in the past for us to overlook the
threat they pose to us," Hunt
said.
Little Chance
Stanford coach Pay ton Jordan
does not see a Card upset likely,
however. "Cal has greater
numbers, more talented
performers and a better record
against common foes; for these
reasons they should be favored,"
said Jordan.
"Right now it looks like they
should win about 90-40. If we can
score more than 50 points, I
would consider it a good meet,"
Jordan said.
Cardinal hopes for most points
rest in the intermediate hurdles,
mile, two-mile, triple-jump and
javelin. Matt Hogsett and Dave
Bagshaw should go 1-2 in the
intermediates, while freshman
Steve Crowley attempts to
improve on his 4:10.5 mile which
gave him a victory against UCLA
two weeks ago.
Tony Sandoval will lead a
strong three-man contingent
against Cal's ace twomilers, Brad
Duffey, who holds the Cal record
(8:52.8) and Wolfgang
Schmulewicz (8:55.8). Mark
McConnel and Jack Bellah will
join Sandy in what could be the
meet's best race as all five
competitors have been timed
within 3.5 seconds of each other

in the eight-lap event.
Cal Favored
Cal should be favored in the
half-mile, high hurdles, most of
the field events and the relays.
Cal captain Rick Brown has
lost but one Pac-8 880 race in his
four year career, and odds are he
will improve on his seasonal best
1:48.8 in his last appearance
before a home crowd.
High hurdler McKinley
Mosley, who, like Brown, is
ranked fourth in the nation in his
specialty, should edge Bagshaw in
the 120. Bret Mannon recently
improved two feet in the shot put
(57-2) and high jumper Eric
Ritterath (6-10) is also favored to
win.
Jordan expects defeat, but
hopes to push Cal in the relays.
"We may pray that they drop the
stick in the 440 relay," said
Jordan, "but we are going to
make them run their fastest time
in the mile relay, otherwise they'll
lose." Hogsett will lead off,
followed by Scott Wingo, Bruce
Henry and Ken Kring.
"Another pivotal area will be
the sprints," Jordan said. "While
their sprinters [Wes Walker,
Sammy Burns, Howard
Strickland] should be favored, I
think we may pull a few surprises
on them. Ken Curl is running with
more strength and confidence
than he has all season. He may let
loose Saturday."
