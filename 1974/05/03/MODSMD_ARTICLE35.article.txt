# Football Shakeup
## ABC's Student Voice 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
You've probably already heard that ABC-TV has replaced
Chris Schenkel on its 1974 college football telecasts. But the
elimination of Schenkel is not the only change in the works; ABC
hopes to make "the color and pageantry of college football"
more relevant to its youthful viewers this fall by hiring a full-time
student announcer.
Three ABC representatives were on campus Wednesday
interviewing candidates from Northern California, Oregon and
Washington in one of 10 stops on a nationwide tour. Of the 400
candidates nominated by various sports information directors,
university officials and friends of ABC, one survivor will become
a regular member of the 1974 broadcast crew.
ABC Sports President Roone Arledge explained that the role
of the college-age reporter will be to "put in perspective not only
the football game itself, but the spirit of the colleges involved,
their students, their faculties, their players and coaches.
"This college-age reporter — male or female — will be featured
in the pre-game and post-game shows, and during the game, and
will have the latitude to interview and report on persons from
cheerleaders to student activists."
The student-reporter will join Keith Jackson, last year's
Sportscaster of the Year, and a guest head coach on the broadcast
team.
In a carefully worded statement, Arledge kicked Schenkel
tactfully upstairs, explaining that "three-time Sportscaster of the
Year Chris Schenkel will act as host of NCAA Football. He will
operate from a studio in New York City and will function in
much the same capacity as he has during ABC's coverage of the
past two Olympiads."
Bud Wilkinson and Duffy Daugherty, last year's color
commentators, "will be asked to serve on some telecasts,"
Arledge said
Terry Jastrow and Barbara Roche, two of the ABC
representatives on the three-person interviewing team, said the
student-reporter will arrive at the site of the game on Monday,
well ahead of the bulk of the ABC contingent. He will interview
players, coaches and students — maybe even professors — in the
five days preceding the game, "trying to get a feel for the
campus."
One of the 400 candidates, an individual who represents a
sharp contrast to the golly gee, sugar-coated Schenkel style, is
former Daily editor and noted Pro Prognosis writer Don
Tollefson.
