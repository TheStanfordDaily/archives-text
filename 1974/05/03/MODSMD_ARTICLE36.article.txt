Sirica Extends Tape Deadline
WASHINGTON — President Nixon gained a
six-day delay yesterday in his fight against a
Watergate subpoena, and a panel of experts said it
will present another report tomorrow on the
18'/2-minute gap in a crucial White House tape.
A sweeping subpoena issued against Nixon by the
Watergate special prosecutor had been due
yesterday morning, but U.S. District Court Judge
John J. Sirica gave lawyers additional time to file
briefs and set a hearing date after the White House
petitioned the court to quash the subpoena.
In a brief session with lawyers in the Watergate
cover-up case and White House attorneys, Sirica
gave them until next Monday to file answers to the
White House motion and set a hearing for
Wednesday.
In a similar struggle last fall, Sirica rejected White
House claims of executive privilege and ordered
Nixon to turn over several tape recordings of
presidential conversations. He was upheld by the
U.S. Court of Appeals here, but Nixon eventually
turned over the tapes without appealing to the
Supreme Court.
There were strong indications from both sides,
however, that this time the final showdown may
come in the high court.
Meanwhile, two members of the panel of tape
recording experts said they would present their
report to Sirica tomorrow. The panel has been
studying the cause of the gap since last November.
Peterson Used By Dean
WASHINGTON — The original Watergate
prosecutors stopped giving information gathered in
their investigation to Asst. Atty. Gen. Henry E.
Petersen because Petersen was passing the
information to the White House, sources close to
the investigation disclosed yesterday.
The sources emphasized that no one believed
Petersen was a part of any conspiracy but believed
instead he was being used by White House Counsel
John W. Dean 111.
The sources said Dean told Petersen that
President Nixon wanted the information about the
Watergate investigation when, in fact, Dean was
passing the information out to potential Watergate
defendants.
"Dean is counsel to the President, for God's
sake," one source said. "He told Henry the
President wanted the information and Henry
believed him.
"When the prosecutors found out what Dean was
doing with the information Henry was giving him,
the prosecutors told Henry he had to sever himself
from the case because he was a potential
prosecution witness against Dean in an obstruction
of justice.
"Petersen bridled at that. He took the position
that Nixon and [then Atty. Gen. Elliot] Richardson
wanted him to be there doing what he was doing."
Eventually, one source said, the prosecutors had
to resume the distribution of information to
Petersen because he seemed to have the continued
support of officials higher up.
SEC Alleges Railroad Fraud
WASHINGTON — The Securities and Exchange
Commission accused the Penn Central Co. and two
of its former top officers yesterday of a massive
scheme to defraud investors in the Penn Central
Railroad before its financial collapse in 1970.

The SEC complaint says the merger of the old
Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central in
1968 was carried out with high public expectations,
even though the defendants knew it would be costly
and lacked any plan to make it succeed financially.
Besides Penn Central, those named in the
complaint filed in U.S. District Court in
Philadelphia included Stuart T. Saunders of
Ardmore, Pa., the former chief executive officer of
Penn Central, David C. Bevan of Gladwyne, Pa., a
former top financial officer of Penn Central, and 14
other defendants.
One defendant is a New. York accounting firm,
Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., which the SEC said
aided in preparing false and misleading financial
statements for the company.
The complaint said the defendants sought to
inflate earnings and cover up losses to disguise the
critical financial condition of the railroad in 1968
and 1969. They even borrowed money to pay cash
dividends as part of the scheme, the SEC said.
Nixon, Dairymen Link Alleged
WASHINGTON — Former milk-producer
lobbyist Bob A. Lilly is quoted in court papers as
saying his boss told him campaign donations were
pledged to President Nixon "in conjunction with
the 1971 price support" increase.
The statement is the first to be attributed to a
dairy cooperative official alleging a link between
Nixon's order to raise federal milk price supports in
1971 and the dairymen's promises of up to $2
million in campaign donations.
In a White House statement last January, the
President specifically denied that he ordered prices
increased in return for campaign money. He
conceded that "traditional political considerations"
played a part in his decision to overrule the
Agriculture Department's desire to keep prices
steady.
Court Delays Ehrlichman Trial
LOS ANGELES — A Superior Court judge agreed
yesterday to delay John D. Ehrlichman's perjury
trial until after he stands trial on federal charges in
the Ellsberg break-in case. But the judge refused to
move the perjury trial out of Los Angeles.
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer also ruled
v against a motion by attorneys for Ehrlichman, the
former chief domestic adviser to President Nixon, to
dismiss the perjury charge.
Ehrlichman is charged with perjury in his
testimony to a Los Angeles county grand jury which
was investigating the 1971 break-in at the office of
Dr. Lewis Fielding, who was Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist. Ehrlichman also has been indicted on
charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI by a
federal grand jury in Washington which probed the
same case.
U.S. Steel Announces Price Hike
PITTSBURGH, Pa. - U.S. Steel Corp., the
nation's largest steel producer, joined others in the
industry yesterday and announced price increases
that were less than predicted before government
price controls were lifted.
U.S. Steel said it would hike prices on its full
product line by an average of 5.7 percent, effective
today. It gave no further breakdown of the
increases.
Industry observers had predicted increases of
between 13 and 20 percent, following elimination

of price controls.
A broad range of steel products, from airplanes
and automobiles to bolts, boats and bobbie pins,
will be affected by the increases, announced one
day after the Cost of Living Council's wage and
price controls expired.
More Zebra Attacks Unlikely
SAN FRANCISCO — A top police official said
yesterday he is confident the "Zebra" street
shootings of whites ended with the arrest of seven
black men in San Francisco.
"The odds against being killed by a new Zebra
suspect are great. We feel we have the bulk if not all
of the persons responsible for the Zebra shootings,"
Chief of Inspectors Charles Barca told a news
conference.
But he said police would maintain intensive
patrols as their probe continues into the six-month
string of random shootings that claimed 12 lives and
injured six.
"I am not fearful of more murders. I am not
fearful of walking on the streets of San Francisco,"
Barca said. "It's just that we want to cover all
bases."
Mayor Joseph L. Alioto said the Zebra attacks
were the work of a black separatist group calling
itself "Death Angels," with ties outside the state
and "dedicated to the murder and mutilation of
whites and dissident blacks." Alioto said the group
was responsible for some 80 "murderous assaults"
throughout California.
No Progress In Kissinger Talks
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger held three rounds of talks with Premier
Golda Meir's government yesterday trying to end
the fighting on the Syrian front, but Israeli officials
reported no progress.
Kissinger also indicated that raging artillery and
air fighting was hampering his peace efforts. "We
believe the negotiations would work best if there
was no pressure by either side, and particularly if
military actions were stopped," Kissinger told
newsmen.
Emerging from a two-hour conference with
Israel's top cabinet ministers and the military chief
of staff, Kissinger said they were "clarifying
elements of the possibilities of disengagement."
But Information Minister Shimon Peres, who sat
in on the discussions, said no progress was made in
eliminating the conflict in demands by Israel and
Syria.
Walton To Sign With Portland
PORTLAND, Ore. — UCLA superstar Bill Walton
has agreed to sign with the Portland Trail Blazers for
a salary estimated at more than $2 million, the
National Basketball Association team said
yesterday.
Walton agreed to sign a contract before coming
to Portland for the weekend, Herman Sarkowsky,
president of the Trail Blazers, said at a news
conference.
Figures were not disclosed, but estimates ranged
as high as $2.5 million in the multiyear pact.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but local low clouds near
the coast this morning. Slightly warmer days. Lows
tonight in the upper 40s to low 50s. Highs today in
the 60s and tomorrow in mid 60s to mid 70s. West

More Zebra Attacks Unlikely
SAN FRANCISCO — A top police official said
yesterday he is confident the "Zebra" street
shootings of whites ended with the arrest of seven
black men in San Francisco.
"The odds against being killed by a new Zebra
suspect are great. We feel we have the bulk if not all
of the persons responsible for the Zebra shootings,"
Chief of Inspectors Charles Barca told a news
conference.
But he said police would maintain intensive
patrols as their probe continues into the six-month
string of random shootings that claimed 12 lives and
injured six.
"I am not fearful of more murders. I am not
fearful of walking on the streets of San Francisco,"
Barca said. "It's just that we want to cover all
bases."
Mayor Joseph L. Alioto said the Zebra attacks
were the work of a black separatist group calling
itself "Death Angels," with ties outside the state
and "dedicated to the murder and mutilation of
whites and dissident blacks." Alioto said the group
was responsible for some 80 "murderous assaults"
throughout California.
No Progress In Kissinger Talks
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger held three rounds of talks with Premier
Golda Meir's government yesterday trying to end
the fighting on the Syrian front, but Israeli officials
reported no progress.
Kissinger also indicated that raging artillery and
air fighting was hampering his peace efforts. "We
believe the negotiations would work best if there
was no pressure by either side, and particularly if
military actions were stopped," Kissinger told
newsmen.
Emerging from a two-hour conference with
Israel's top cabinet ministers and the military chief
of staff, Kissinger said they were "clarifying
elements of the possibilities of disengagement."
But Information Minister Shimon Peres, who sat
in on the discussions, said no progress was made in
eliminating the conflict in demands by Israel and
Syria.

Sirica Extends Tape Deadline
WASHINGTON — President Nixon gained a
six-day delay yesterday in his fight against a
Watergate subpoena, and a panel of experts said it
will present another report tomorrow on the
18'/2-minute gap in a crucial White House tape.
A sweeping subpoena issued against Nixon by the
Watergate special prosecutor had been due
yesterday morning, but U.S. District Court Judge
John J. Sirica gave lawyers additional time to file
briefs and set a hearing date after the White House
petitioned the court to quash the subpoena.
In a brief session with lawyers in the Watergate
cover-up case and White House attorneys, Sirica
gave them until next Monday to file answers to the
White House motion and set a hearing for
Wednesday.
In a similar struggle last fall, Sirica rejected White
House claims of executive privilege and ordered
Nixon to turn over several tape recordings of
presidential conversations. He was upheld by the
U.S. Court of Appeals here, but Nixon eventually
turned over the tapes without appealing to the
Supreme Court.
There were strong indications from both sides,
however, that this time the final showdown may
come in the high court.
Meanwhile, two members of the panel of tape
recording experts said they would present their
report to Sirica tomorrow. The panel has been
studying the cause of the gap since last November.
Peterson Used By Dean
WASHINGTON — The original Watergate
prosecutors stopped giving information gathered in
their investigation to Asst. Atty. Gen. Henry E.
Petersen because Petersen was passing the
information to the White House, sources close to
the investigation disclosed yesterday.
The sources emphasized that no one believed
Petersen was a part of any conspiracy but believed
instead he was being used by White House Counsel
John W. Dean 111.
The sources said Dean told Petersen that
President Nixon wanted the information about the
Watergate investigation when, in fact, Dean was
passing the information out to potential Watergate
defendants.
"Dean is counsel to the President, for God's
sake," one source said. "He told Henry the
President wanted the information and Henry
believed him.
"When the prosecutors found out what Dean was
doing with the information Henry was giving him,
the prosecutors told Henry he had to sever himself
from the case because he was a potential
prosecution witness against Dean in an obstruction
of justice.
"Petersen bridled at that. He took the position
that Nixon and [then Atty. Gen. Elliot] Richardson
wanted him to be there doing what he was doing."
Eventually, one source said, the prosecutors had
to resume the distribution of information to
Petersen because he seemed to have the continued
support of officials higher up.
SEC Alleges Railroad Fraud
WASHINGTON — The Securities and Exchange
Commission accused the Penn Central Co. and two
of its former top officers yesterday of a massive
scheme to defraud investors in the Penn Central
Railroad before its financial collapse in 1970.

The SEC complaint says the merger of the old
Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central in
1968 was carried out with high public expectations,
even though the defendants knew it would be costly
and lacked any plan to make it succeed financially.
Besides Penn Central, those named in the
complaint filed in U.S. District Court in
Philadelphia included Stuart T. Saunders of
Ardmore, Pa., the former chief executive officer of
Penn Central, David C. Bevan of Gladwyne, Pa., a
former top financial officer of Penn Central, and 14
other defendants.
One defendant is a New. York accounting firm,
Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., which the SEC said
aided in preparing false and misleading financial
statements for the company.
The complaint said the defendants sought to
inflate earnings and cover up losses to disguise the
critical financial condition of the railroad in 1968
and 1969. They even borrowed money to pay cash
dividends as part of the scheme, the SEC said.
Nixon, Dairymen Link Alleged
WASHINGTON — Former milk-producer
lobbyist Bob A. Lilly is quoted in court papers as
saying his boss told him campaign donations were
pledged to President Nixon "in conjunction with
the 1971 price support" increase.
The statement is the first to be attributed to a
dairy cooperative official alleging a link between
Nixon's order to raise federal milk price supports in
1971 and the dairymen's promises of up to $2
million in campaign donations.
In a White House statement last January, the
President specifically denied that he ordered prices
increased in return for campaign money. He
conceded that "traditional political considerations"
played a part in his decision to overrule the
Agriculture Department's desire to keep prices
steady.
Court Delays Ehrlichman Trial
LOS ANGELES — A Superior Court judge agreed
yesterday to delay John D. Ehrlichman's perjury
trial until after he stands trial on federal charges in
the Ellsberg break-in case. But the judge refused to
move the perjury trial out of Los Angeles.
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer also ruled
v against a motion by attorneys for Ehrlichman, the
former chief domestic adviser to President Nixon, to
dismiss the perjury charge.
Ehrlichman is charged with perjury in his
testimony to a Los Angeles county grand jury which
was investigating the 1971 break-in at the office of
Dr. Lewis Fielding, who was Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist. Ehrlichman also has been indicted on
charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI by a
federal grand jury in Washington which probed the
same case.
U.S. Steel Announces Price Hike
PITTSBURGH, Pa. - U.S. Steel Corp., the
nation's largest steel producer, joined others in the
industry yesterday and announced price increases
that were less than predicted before government
price controls were lifted.
U.S. Steel said it would hike prices on its full
product line by an average of 5.7 percent, effective
today. It gave no further breakdown of the
increases.
Industry observers had predicted increases of
between 13 and 20 percent, following elimination

of price controls.
A broad range of steel products, from airplanes
and automobiles to bolts, boats and bobbie pins,
will be affected by the increases, announced one
day after the Cost of Living Council's wage and
price controls expired.

other defendants.
One defendant is a New. York accounting firm,
Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., which the SEC said
aided in preparing false and misleading financial
statements for the company.
The complaint said the defendants sought to
inflate earnings and cover up losses to disguise the
critical financial condition of the railroad in 1968

dividends as part of the scheme, the SEC said.
Nixon, Dairymen Link Alleged
WASHINGTON — Former milk-producer
lobbyist Bob A. Lilly is quoted in court papers as
saying his boss told him campaign donations were
pledged to President Nixon "in conjunction with
the 1971 price support" increase.
The statement is the first to be attributed to a
dairy cooperative official alleging a link between
Nixon's order to raise federal milk price supports in
1971 and the dairymen's promises of up to $2
million in campaign donations.
In a White House statement last January, the
President specifically denied that he ordered prices
increased in return for campaign money. He
conceded that "traditional political considerations"
played a part in his decision to overrule the
Agriculture Department's desire to keep prices
steady.
Court Delays Ehrlichman Trial
LOS ANGELES — A Superior Court judge agreed
yesterday to delay John D. Ehrlichman's perjury
trial until after he stands trial on federal charges in
the Ellsberg break-in case. But the judge refused to
move the perjury trial out of Los Angeles.
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer also ruled
v against a motion by attorneys for Ehrlichman, the
former chief domestic adviser to President Nixon, to
dismiss the perjury charge.
Ehrlichman is charged with perjury in his
testimony to a Los Angeles county grand jury which
was investigating the 1971 break-in at the office of
Dr. Lewis Fielding, who was Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist. Ehrlichman also has been indicted on
charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI by a
federal grand jury in Washington which probed the
same case.
U.S. Steel Announces Price Hike
PITTSBURGH, Pa. - U.S. Steel Corp., the
nation's largest steel producer, joined others in the
industry yesterday and announced price increases
that were less than predicted before government
price controls were lifted.
U.S. Steel said it would hike prices on its full
product line by an average of 5.7 percent, effective
today. It gave no further breakdown of the
increases.
Industry observers had predicted increases of
between 13 and 20 percent, following elimination

of price controls.
A broad range of steel products, from airplanes
and automobiles to bolts, boats and bobbie pins,
will be affected by the increases, announced one
day after the Cost of Living Council's wage and
price controls expired.
More Zebra Attacks Unlikely
SAN FRANCISCO — A top police official said
yesterday he is confident the "Zebra" street
shootings of whites ended with the arrest of seven
black men in San Francisco.
"The odds against being killed by a new Zebra
suspect are great. We feel we have the bulk if not all
of the persons responsible for the Zebra shootings,"
Chief of Inspectors Charles Barca told a news
conference.
But he said police would maintain intensive
patrols as their probe continues into the six-month
string of random shootings that claimed 12 lives and
injured six.
"I am not fearful of more murders. I am not
fearful of walking on the streets of San Francisco,"
Barca said. "It's just that we want to cover all
bases."
Mayor Joseph L. Alioto said the Zebra attacks
were the work of a black separatist group calling
itself "Death Angels," with ties outside the state
and "dedicated to the murder and mutilation of
whites and dissident blacks." Alioto said the group
was responsible for some 80 "murderous assaults"
throughout California.
No Progress In Kissinger Talks
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger held three rounds of talks with Premier
Golda Meir's government yesterday trying to end
the fighting on the Syrian front, but Israeli officials
reported no progress.
Kissinger also indicated that raging artillery and
air fighting was hampering his peace efforts. "We
believe the negotiations would work best if there
was no pressure by either side, and particularly if
military actions were stopped," Kissinger told
newsmen.
Emerging from a two-hour conference with
Israel's top cabinet ministers and the military chief
of staff, Kissinger said they were "clarifying
elements of the possibilities of disengagement."
But Information Minister Shimon Peres, who sat
in on the discussions, said no progress was made in
eliminating the conflict in demands by Israel and
Syria.

Sirica Extends Tape Deadline
WASHINGTON — President Nixon gained a
six-day delay yesterday in his fight against a
Watergate subpoena, and a panel of experts said it
will present another report tomorrow on the
18'/2-minute gap in a crucial White House tape.
A sweeping subpoena issued against Nixon by the
Watergate special prosecutor had been due
yesterday morning, but U.S. District Court Judge
John J. Sirica gave lawyers additional time to file
briefs and set a hearing date after the White House
petitioned the court to quash the subpoena.
In a brief session with lawyers in the Watergate
cover-up case and White House attorneys, Sirica
gave them until next Monday to file answers to the
White House motion and set a hearing for
Wednesday.
In a similar struggle last fall, Sirica rejected White
House claims of executive privilege and ordered
Nixon to turn over several tape recordings of
presidential conversations. He was upheld by the
U.S. Court of Appeals here, but Nixon eventually
turned over the tapes without appealing to the
Supreme Court.
There were strong indications from both sides,
however, that this time the final showdown may
come in the high court.
Meanwhile, two members of the panel of tape
recording experts said they would present their
report to Sirica tomorrow. The panel has been
studying the cause of the gap since last November.
Peterson Used By Dean
WASHINGTON — The original Watergate
prosecutors stopped giving information gathered in
their investigation to Asst. Atty. Gen. Henry E.
Petersen because Petersen was passing the
information to the White House, sources close to
the investigation disclosed yesterday.
The sources emphasized that no one believed
Petersen was a part of any conspiracy but believed
instead he was being used by White House Counsel
John W. Dean 111.
The sources said Dean told Petersen that
President Nixon wanted the information about the
Watergate investigation when, in fact, Dean was
passing the information out to potential Watergate
defendants.
"Dean is counsel to the President, for God's
sake," one source said. "He told Henry the
President wanted the information and Henry
believed him.
"When the prosecutors found out what Dean was
doing with the information Henry was giving him,
the prosecutors told Henry he had to sever himself
from the case because he was a potential
prosecution witness against Dean in an obstruction
of justice.
"Petersen bridled at that. He took the position
that Nixon and [then Atty. Gen. Elliot] Richardson
wanted him to be there doing what he was doing."
Eventually, one source said, the prosecutors had
to resume the distribution of information to
Petersen because he seemed to have the continued
support of officials higher up.
SEC Alleges Railroad Fraud
WASHINGTON — The Securities and Exchange
Commission accused the Penn Central Co. and two
of its former top officers yesterday of a massive
scheme to defraud investors in the Penn Central
Railroad before its financial collapse in 1970.

The SEC complaint says the merger of the old
Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central in
1968 was carried out with high public expectations,
even though the defendants knew it would be costly
and lacked any plan to make it succeed financially.
Besides Penn Central, those named in the
complaint filed in U.S. District Court in
Philadelphia included Stuart T. Saunders of
Ardmore, Pa., the former chief executive officer of
Penn Central, David C. Bevan of Gladwyne, Pa., a
former top financial officer of Penn Central, and 14
other defendants.
One defendant is a New. York accounting firm,
Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., which the SEC said
aided in preparing false and misleading financial
statements for the company.
The complaint said the defendants sought to
inflate earnings and cover up losses to disguise the
critical financial condition of the railroad in 1968
and 1969. They even borrowed money to pay cash
dividends as part of the scheme, the SEC said.

In a brief session with lawyers in the Watergate
cover-up case and White House attorneys, Sirica
gave them until next Monday to file answers to the
White House motion and set a hearing for
Wednesday.
In a similar struggle last fall, Sirica rejected White
House claims of executive privilege and ordered
Nixon to turn over several tape recordings of
presidential conversations. He was upheld by the
U.S. Court of Appeals here, but Nixon eventually
turned over the tapes without appealing to the
Supreme Court.
There were strong indications from both sides,
however, that this time the final showdown may
come in the high court.
Meanwhile, two members of the panel of tape
recording experts said they would present their
report to Sirica tomorrow. The panel has been
studying the cause of the gap since last November.
Peterson Used By Dean
WASHINGTON — The original Watergate
prosecutors stopped giving information gathered in
their investigation to Asst. Atty. Gen. Henry E.
Petersen because Petersen was passing the
information to the White House, sources close to
the investigation disclosed yesterday.
The sources emphasized that no one believed
Petersen was a part of any conspiracy but believed
instead he was being used by White House Counsel
John W. Dean 111.
The sources said Dean told Petersen that
President Nixon wanted the information about the
Watergate investigation when, in fact, Dean was
passing the information out to potential Watergate
defendants.
"Dean is counsel to the President, for God's
sake," one source said. "He told Henry the
President wanted the information and Henry
believed him.
"When the prosecutors found out what Dean was
doing with the information Henry was giving him,
the prosecutors told Henry he had to sever himself
from the case because he was a potential
prosecution witness against Dean in an obstruction
of justice.
"Petersen bridled at that. He took the position
that Nixon and [then Atty. Gen. Elliot] Richardson
wanted him to be there doing what he was doing."
Eventually, one source said, the prosecutors had
to resume the distribution of information to
Petersen because he seemed to have the continued
support of officials higher up.
SEC Alleges Railroad Fraud
WASHINGTON — The Securities and Exchange
Commission accused the Penn Central Co. and two
of its former top officers yesterday of a massive
scheme to defraud investors in the Penn Central
Railroad before its financial collapse in 1970.

The SEC complaint says the merger of the old
Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central in
1968 was carried out with high public expectations,
even though the defendants knew it would be costly
and lacked any plan to make it succeed financially.
Besides Penn Central, those named in the
complaint filed in U.S. District Court in
Philadelphia included Stuart T. Saunders of
Ardmore, Pa., the former chief executive officer of
Penn Central, David C. Bevan of Gladwyne, Pa., a
former top financial officer of Penn Central, and 14
other defendants.
One defendant is a New. York accounting firm,
Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., which the SEC said
aided in preparing false and misleading financial
statements for the company.
The complaint said the defendants sought to
inflate earnings and cover up losses to disguise the
critical financial condition of the railroad in 1968
and 1969. They even borrowed money to pay cash
dividends as part of the scheme, the SEC said.
Nixon, Dairymen Link Alleged
WASHINGTON — Former milk-producer
lobbyist Bob A. Lilly is quoted in court papers as
saying his boss told him campaign donations were
pledged to President Nixon "in conjunction with
the 1971 price support" increase.
The statement is the first to be attributed to a
dairy cooperative official alleging a link between
Nixon's order to raise federal milk price supports in
1971 and the dairymen's promises of up to $2
million in campaign donations.
In a White House statement last January, the
President specifically denied that he ordered prices
increased in return for campaign money. He
conceded that "traditional political considerations"
played a part in his decision to overrule the
Agriculture Department's desire to keep prices
steady.
Court Delays Ehrlichman Trial
LOS ANGELES — A Superior Court judge agreed
yesterday to delay John D. Ehrlichman's perjury
trial until after he stands trial on federal charges in
the Ellsberg break-in case. But the judge refused to
move the perjury trial out of Los Angeles.
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer also ruled
v against a motion by attorneys for Ehrlichman, the
former chief domestic adviser to President Nixon, to
dismiss the perjury charge.
Ehrlichman is charged with perjury in his
testimony to a Los Angeles county grand jury which
was investigating the 1971 break-in at the office of
Dr. Lewis Fielding, who was Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist. Ehrlichman also has been indicted on
charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI by a
federal grand jury in Washington which probed the
same case.
U.S. Steel Announces Price Hike
PITTSBURGH, Pa. - U.S. Steel Corp., the
nation's largest steel producer, joined others in the
industry yesterday and announced price increases
that were less than predicted before government
price controls were lifted.
U.S. Steel said it would hike prices on its full
product line by an average of 5.7 percent, effective
today. It gave no further breakdown of the
increases.
Industry observers had predicted increases of
between 13 and 20 percent, following elimination

of price controls.
A broad range of steel products, from airplanes
and automobiles to bolts, boats and bobbie pins,
will be affected by the increases, announced one
day after the Cost of Living Council's wage and
price controls expired.
More Zebra Attacks Unlikely
SAN FRANCISCO — A top police official said
yesterday he is confident the "Zebra" street
shootings of whites ended with the arrest of seven
black men in San Francisco.
"The odds against being killed by a new Zebra
suspect are great. We feel we have the bulk if not all
of the persons responsible for the Zebra shootings,"
Chief of Inspectors Charles Barca told a news
conference.
But he said police would maintain intensive
patrols as their probe continues into the six-month
string of random shootings that claimed 12 lives and
injured six.
"I am not fearful of more murders. I am not
fearful of walking on the streets of San Francisco,"
Barca said. "It's just that we want to cover all
bases."
Mayor Joseph L. Alioto said the Zebra attacks
were the work of a black separatist group calling
itself "Death Angels," with ties outside the state
and "dedicated to the murder and mutilation of
whites and dissident blacks." Alioto said the group
was responsible for some 80 "murderous assaults"
throughout California.
No Progress In Kissinger Talks
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger held three rounds of talks with Premier
Golda Meir's government yesterday trying to end
the fighting on the Syrian front, but Israeli officials
reported no progress.
Kissinger also indicated that raging artillery and
air fighting was hampering his peace efforts. "We
believe the negotiations would work best if there
was no pressure by either side, and particularly if
military actions were stopped," Kissinger told
newsmen.
Emerging from a two-hour conference with
Israel's top cabinet ministers and the military chief
of staff, Kissinger said they were "clarifying
elements of the possibilities of disengagement."
But Information Minister Shimon Peres, who sat
in on the discussions, said no progress was made in
eliminating the conflict in demands by Israel and
Syria.
Walton To Sign With Portland
PORTLAND, Ore. — UCLA superstar Bill Walton
has agreed to sign with the Portland Trail Blazers for
a salary estimated at more than $2 million, the
National Basketball Association team said
yesterday.
Walton agreed to sign a contract before coming
to Portland for the weekend, Herman Sarkowsky,
president of the Trail Blazers, said at a news
conference.
Figures were not disclosed, but estimates ranged
as high as $2.5 million in the multiyear pact.

Sirica Extends Tape Deadline
WASHINGTON — President Nixon gained a
six-day delay yesterday in his fight against a
Watergate subpoena, and a panel of experts said it
will present another report tomorrow on the
18'/2-minute gap in a crucial White House tape.
A sweeping subpoena issued against Nixon by the
Watergate special prosecutor had been due
yesterday morning, but U.S. District Court Judge
John J. Sirica gave lawyers additional time to file
briefs and set a hearing date after the White House
petitioned the court to quash the subpoena.
In a brief session with lawyers in the Watergate
cover-up case and White House attorneys, Sirica
gave them until next Monday to file answers to the
