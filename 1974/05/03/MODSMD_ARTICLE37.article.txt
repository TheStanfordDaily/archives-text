### 
Lise Pfeiffer, Jim Dewell and Suzie
Schatzman were elected Senior Class
Officers for the Class of '75 yesterday.
The Pfeiffer slate defeated the slate
of David Antonuccio, Karen Chang,
Rich Gonzales and Dan Spikes by a
vote of 87 to 73.
The election was a runoff of the
top two slates in the primary election
held two weeks ago. Only students
who will be seniors next year were
permitted to vote.
Commenting on what her slate
hopes to accomplish, Pfeiffer said,
"There's no class spirit at all right
now. We want to get the seniors
together," and revive the kind of class
spirit that most freshmen have.
Pfeiffer said the new officers will
set up a system of dormitory
representatives "to feed
communication from people that are
in the house who are seniors to the
people who are coordinating events."
She said the new officers would also
try to involve more off-campus seniors
in class activities next year.
Asst. Elections Commissioner Bill
Gurza, who conducted the election,
said the election was "very smoothly
run."
He commented that the low voter
turnout shows that most seniors are
not interested in selecting Senior Class
Officers.
