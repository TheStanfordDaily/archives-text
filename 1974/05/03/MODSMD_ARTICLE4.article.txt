# Appeals Court Disbars Agnew
## 
### 
ANNAPOLIS (AP) — Describing
Spiro T. Agnew as a man who
consciously cheated the federal
government, the Maryland Court of
Appeals disbarred the former vice
president yesterday.
In a unanimous 13-page ruling
which took away Agnew's right to
practice law, the seven-judge court,
Maryland's highest, termed Agnew "so
morally obtuse that he consciously
cheats for his own pecuniary gain."
Agnew pleaded no contest last
October to federal income tax evasion
charges, an action tantamount to
conviction.
The court's decision affirmed a
recommendation made in January by a

three-judge Circuit Court panel.
Agnew was not available for
comment on the decision in the
disciplinary action brought by the
state bar association.
No Appeal
The Court of Appeals ruling is not
subject to appeal, although Agnew
could petition the court at any time
for reinstatement as a lawyer, his
profession before entering politics full
time in 1962.
Agnew was not a member of the
federal bar, and his disbarment in
Maryland prevents his practicing law
elsewhere. •
His lawyer, Leon H.A. Pierson,
argued before the court in April that
the former Maryland governor should
only be suspended from the practice
of law.
Agnew Pleaded
Previously, Agnew personally
pleaded with the Circuit Court judges
not to deprive him of a means of
earning a living. Agnew since has
announced he is writing a political
novel, which publishing experts have
predicted will earn him $100,000 or
more.
The high court said it considered
tax evasion a crime involving moral
turpitude, fraud and deceit and, as
such, required disbarment under state
law, previous court decisions and the
ethical rules of the American Bar
Association.
"It is difficult to feel compassion
for an attorney who" cheats the
government "he has sworn to serve,
completely disregards the words of the
oath he uttered when first admitted to
the bar and absolutely fails to perceive
his professional duty to act honesty in
all matters," the ruling said.
"To do other than disbar the
respondent in this case, therefore,
would constitute a travesty of our
responsibility," said the ruling, written
by Associate Judge J. Dudley Digges.
