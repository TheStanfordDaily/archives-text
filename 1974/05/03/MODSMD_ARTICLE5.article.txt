# Women Med Students Increase As Faculty Rejects Quota Plan
## 
### AMY SABRIN 
Women will comprise a record 28
percent of this fall's entering class at
Stanford Medical School — up from
three percent five years ago.
And no quota system or timetable
for admissions was responsible for the
increase. As more women apply, more
are admitted, the theory goes.
In fact, the Medical Faculty Senate
recently voted down a plan to achieve
a 50-50, male-female ratio over the
next five years, and adopted instead a
less stringent plan to simply accelerate
the increase in the number of women
accepted.
Opposing the Senate's action is the
Professional Women of Stanford
Medical School (PWSMS), a group
which has sought to increase steadily
the number of women medical
students. Although Helene Rauch of
PWSMS said she approved of the
current admissions practice, which

leads to the acceptance of a slightly
higher percentage of women than their
percentage in the applicant pool, she
maintained, "We would like to see the
medical school admit 50 percent
women today."
Dr. Gerald Reaven, head of the
Joint Committee on the Status and
Tenure of Women which proposed the
five-year timetable, said he cared more
about the end than the means. "If we
accomplish our goals by their words
instead of ours, we couldn't care less,"
he said.
Reaven speculated why the Senate
turned down his committee's proposal.
These included a feeling that a quota
system would be unfair to male
applicants, a reluctance to inhibit the
free will of the admissions committee,
a fear that the quality of students
might drop and lack of evidence that
the admissions process had
discriminated against women in the

past.
The admissions committee has
always accepted women in proportion
to their percentage of the applicant
pool. The dramatic increase in female
applicants since 1969 accounts for the
increase in the percentage of women
admitted each year: 11 percent in
1970, 23 percent in 1971, 24 percent
in 1972 and 26 percent this year. One
member of the admission's committee,
Dr. Dorinda Loeffel, commented,
"The committee does a fair job of
evaluating women. I wasn't expecting
that when I joined."
Less Qualified
Loeffel said a quota and timetable
might result in a less qualified class. "I
think if you made a binding law on the
admissions committee, it would be
disastrous," she said.
Rauch disagreed. The female
applicants are so well qualified that
"you could accept a class of 50-80
percent women now and it would be
of the same quality as the present
class." She based her statement upon
objective criteria, such as grade point
average and board scores.
"It would be grossly unfair to men"
to accept a class of 50 percent women
when less than half the applicants were
female, Loeffel maintained. She
estimates that the ratio of females to
males applying would be 40:60 by
1979.

As admissions figures show, the
number of women applicants has been
leveling off. Rauch claimed the
increase would continue only if the
percentage of women accepted
exceeds the percentage in the
applicant pool.
"An increase in acceptances leads
to an increase in the number of
women applying," she said. "The
message filters down from college
counselors to students that Stanford is
admitting lots of women, so more
apply." It is unfair to men, she said,
"only if you conceive of those places
as belonging to men in the first place."
Reaven said his joint Committee
favored the five-year plan because "we
felt that Stanford, as a leading medical
school, should take a social stand to
increase women in medicine. There is
no question that if we were to
announce we were taking more
women, we'd increase the applicant
pool."

women today."
Dr. Gerald Reaven, head of the
Joint Committee on the Status and
Tenure of Women which proposed the
five-year timetable, said he cared more
about the end than the means. "If we
accomplish our goals by their words
instead of ours, we couldn't care less,"
he said.
Reaven speculated why the Senate
turned down his committee's proposal.
These included a feeling that a quota
system would be unfair to male
applicants, a reluctance to inhibit the
free will of the admissions committee,
a fear that the quality of students
might drop and lack of evidence that
the admissions process had
discriminated against women in the

past.
The admissions committee has
always accepted women in proportion
to their percentage of the applicant
pool. The dramatic increase in female
applicants since 1969 accounts for the
increase in the percentage of women
admitted each year: 11 percent in
1970, 23 percent in 1971, 24 percent
in 1972 and 26 percent this year. One
member of the admission's committee,
Dr. Dorinda Loeffel, commented,
"The committee does a fair job of
evaluating women. I wasn't expecting
that when I joined."
Less Qualified
Loeffel said a quota and timetable
might result in a less qualified class. "I
think if you made a binding law on the
admissions committee, it would be
disastrous," she said.
Rauch disagreed. The female
applicants are so well qualified that
"you could accept a class of 50-80
percent women now and it would be
of the same quality as the present
class." She based her statement upon
objective criteria, such as grade point
average and board scores.
"It would be grossly unfair to men"
to accept a class of 50 percent women
when less than half the applicants were
female, Loeffel maintained. She
estimates that the ratio of females to
males applying would be 40:60 by
1979.

As admissions figures show, the
number of women applicants has been
leveling off. Rauch claimed the
increase would continue only if the
percentage of women accepted
exceeds the percentage in the
applicant pool.
"An increase in acceptances leads
to an increase in the number of
women applying," she said. "The
message filters down from college
counselors to students that Stanford is
admitting lots of women, so more
apply." It is unfair to men, she said,
"only if you conceive of those places
as belonging to men in the first place."
Reaven said his joint Committee
favored the five-year plan because "we
felt that Stanford, as a leading medical
school, should take a social stand to
increase women in medicine. There is
no question that if we were to
announce we were taking more
women, we'd increase the applicant
pool."
Women will comprise a record 28
percent of this fall's entering class at
Stanford Medical School — up from
three percent five years ago.
And no quota system or timetable
for admissions was responsible for the
increase. As more women apply, more
are admitted, the theory goes.
In fact, the Medical Faculty Senate
recently voted down a plan to achieve
a 50-50, male-female ratio over the
next five years, and adopted instead a
less stringent plan to simply accelerate
the increase in the number of women
accepted.
Opposing the Senate's action is the
Professional Women of Stanford
Medical School (PWSMS), a group
which has sought to increase steadily
the number of women medical
students. Although Helene Rauch of
PWSMS said she approved of the
current admissions practice, which

leads to the acceptance of a slightly
higher percentage of women than their
percentage in the applicant pool, she
maintained, "We would like to see the
medical school admit 50 percent
women today."
