## Huerta Blasts Grape Growers 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Racism and politics are two reasons the grape growers
"want to get rid of" the farmworkers, Dolores Huerta,
executive vice president of United Farmworkers of
America, claimed last night.
"They don't want to sit down at the bargaining table
and be equals with us," she accused. The growers know that
"if the farmworkers get organized they will change the
politics of the whole country," by settling down, registering
to vote and using their political power.
Huerta spoke to almost 200 people in Memorial Church
as part of the chicano community's traditional observance
of Cinco de Mayo. After working in New York City for the
past year, she said she was happy to "touch this sacred
ground [California] again."
Huerta described the effectiveness of the boycott in the
East. 'The city of Boston is clean," she exuberantly
remarked. "All chain stores except A&P have taken lettuce,
grapes and wine off their shelves." Huerta said the boycott
was successful because the area "has so many students."
Governors Support
Huerta noted that the governors of Pennsylvania, New
York and Ohio have endorsed the boycott of lettuce and
grapes picked by strikebreakers.
She pointed out that Abraham Beame, mayor of New
York, said the city will not buy any non-union lettuce or
grapes. "The [New York] state legislature passed a
resolution" urging citizens to boycott grapes, lettuce and
Gallo wine, Huerta stated.

Huerta pointed out some of the changes that have
occurred since the farmworkers organized in 1970. These
include a medical plan which covers a worker's entire
family, five medical clinics (four in California and one in
Mexicali), a credit union and bank run by the farmworkers,
a death benefit program and a free ombudsman-type service
program, Huerta said.
Teamster's Record
"Compare that record with what the Teamsters have
done in the 40 years they have had the contract with
cannery and processing workers," she challenged. "And they
have lots of money ... [while] we have no money."
Huerta noted the Teamsters'future strategy. They "will
try to discredit Cesar" Chavez. They are spending
"$lOO,OOO per week in their P.R. campaign," she claimed.
Huerta outlined the farmworkers' strategy to combat the
Teamsters during the next few months. Besides asking
people not to shop at Safeway, the Farmworkers will
continue a primary boycott, she said.
By picketing and leafieting, "we will try to reach the
growers and take that blindfold off of them."
She also emphasized that the farmworkers must reach
"all the people who don't care and don't want to be
bothered."
When the boycott is over, she said, "the victory will be
for all the people that helped;" those who wore a button,
passed a petition, marched in a picket line or boycotted
non-union lettuce, grapes or wine.
