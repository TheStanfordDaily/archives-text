Prof. Pauline Newman-
Gordon's impassioned and
misleading article entitled "On
Packer Report" in the April 29
Daily needs clarification and
correction. As a University
Fellow, I directed a small group in
examining the freshman year at
Stanford. We submitted a report
to the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies.
Professor Newman-Gordon
stated "The Packer report
contains unmistakable evidence
that SES has been a failure." No
such "evidence" was in our
report. To say it was is to
misconceive in a fundamental way
what SES was about and sought
to achieve. It is also to distort our
report.
For the uninitiated, SES was
Stanford's massive self-study of
1967-69. Our report stated, "SES
was a successful attempt to
replace a system based on no
longer existing agreement as to
educational means and ends. That
system had been rigid and
complex to the point of bizarre
and prescriptive to the point of
dictatorial."
The thrust of our report was
not to aid those who would
dismantle SES and return to the
old special-interest-ridden days,
but rather to realize one of the
basic principles of SES: "A
University, above all other social
institutions, should engage in a
continuing process of
self-examination and
self-renewal." (Vol. 1) For some,
this process will always be a dire
threat; for others, it is an
opportunity to exchange the good
for the better.
Freshman Year Imperfect
Not remarkably, our study
found that the freshman year
could be improved. CUS accepted
our fundamental recommendation
and established ad hoc advisory
groups in each of the three areas
"to establish goals for the
distribution requirement in that
area, to promote guidelines for
courses that are intended to fulfill
the requirement, and to evaluate
course offerings as to whether the
goals of the requirement are
fulfilled."
I am the CUS representative to
the humanities advisory
committee and became, by
default, its chairman. The area
distribution requirement is aimed
not at majors within an area but
at students outside the area.
For humanities the target
group is made of scientists,
pre-meds, engineers, social
scientists — many of whom spend
no more time outside their
discipline than the University
demands. The purpose of the
requirement is to bring these
non-humanists into contact with
the humanities. The question is,
what is the best use to be made of
the limited time available for
humanities in this pluralistic
University?
Introduction To Humanism
For me, as a humanist and a
Stanford instructor, the most
important task is to devise a
means of introducing
non-humanist students r to
humanistic endeavor in sufficient
depth for them to appreciate and
understand works of human
imagination as they emerged from
a social and historical milieu.
To that end, our report
proposed that each department in
humanities design or identify a
three-course sequence, including
interdepartmental sequences, and
that each freshman be asked to
select one such sequence in order
to fulfill the area requirement.
I thought, and still do, that
such a humanities sequence
would, without increasing the

amount of time required, provide
coherence, depth and continuity,
as well as historical perspective
that some freshman programs
lack. The plan, I thought, would
allow for ample structure and
plenty of freedom of choice.
Members 'Reluctant'
Most members of our
committee are reluctant to
"require" such a sequence. I think
they are wrong, but I am willing
to settle for "strongly encourage."
We are now in the process of
determining what kinds of courses
should be acceptable for the area
distribution requirement.
Many of us think that first-year
language study — with its
necessary concentration on
vocabulary and grammar and
pronunciation — does not fit the
bill. Further, many of us believe
that non-humanist students ought
to be exposed, in their brief time
among us, to accomplished
humanistic scholars who have
spent their lives examining the
works of human imagination.
In arguing a different view,
Prof. Newman-Gordon wrote that
the future of students who
"refuse to minimize the language
factor in the study of foreign
literatures" is "threatened by the
kind of prejudice expressed in the
Packer report."
Prejudice?
Prejudice? What right has
Professor Newman-Gordon to
characterize our considered views
as prejudice? Is difference of
opinion always prejudice?
Apparently, anything she thinks
might serve her purpose is
evidence and anything that does
not is prejudice.
Since her article is concerned
not with broad issues of
educational policy but only with
defending first-year language
study as fulfilling the humanities
requirement, she must have seen
prejudice in what we said of
language. In illustrating the
possible function of the ad hoc
committees, our report stated,
"The advisory group in
humanities might decide that
creative writing, studio art,
perhaps first-year language
courses, perhaps linguistics, did
not fulfill the goals."
Our prejudice, then, is not
merely against languages but also
against, in her words, "other
ill-defined 'lesser' disciplines." I
admit that creative writing, which
I teach, is ill-defined but,
honestly, I don't think it is lesser.
Four Subjects Insufficient
I don't want to be
disingenuous. It is my opinion
that the four subjects cited ought
not to fulfill the requirement. I do
not think they are the best use of
the limited time humanities has.
But to suggest, as Professor
Newman-Gordon did, that our
proposal "will toll the death-knell
of all courses in which foreign
literatures are studied in the
language in which they are
written" is, to put it mildly,
foolishness. Over 90 percent of
our entering students have studied
a language, and many of those will
go on, perhaps start another
language even. Two of our largest
departments — history and
English — require a language of
their majors, as do some small
ones. Language is required at all
overseas campuses but Cliveden,
and for study in non-English
speaking universities.
In any case, issues of
educational policy should not be
decided on the basis of
narrowly-conceived special
interests.
