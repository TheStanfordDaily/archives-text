KING of «|
HEARTS *112
-the film that ran for 3 continuous years in one theatre in Cambridge, Mass.
In an isolated surreal pocket of World War I, the British send Alan Bates into a highly unlike!}, tiny French town to discover \wßj
a bomb. The townspeople have fled and the inmates of the local asylum have taken their place. The resulting interaction gives |jy
us some of the most enchanting sequences on film. When the reality of the returning armies breaks the bubble and the inmates ' ilk
I have returned to the asylum, we can really share Bates' confusion about which people are really insane. In our opinion, KING
OF HEARTS is a rare treat; funny and sad at the same time. Past audiences will vouch for this, and we know you will too.
