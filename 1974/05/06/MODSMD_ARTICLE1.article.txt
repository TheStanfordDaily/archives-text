# Nguyen Huu Thai Released From S. Vietnamese Prison

### JAY HARLOW 
Nguyen Huu Thai, the Vietnamese
journalist whom students recently
voted to invite as an ASSU guest
professor, has been released from
South Vietnamese prison, the Daily
has learned.
David Marr of the Indochina
Resource Center in Berkeley told the
Daily yesterday he had received a call
from Thai's sister, Nguyen Thi Ngoc
Thoa, informing him that Thai had
been released from the Go Vap
military prison west of Saigon several
days ago.
Thai has not been completely freed,
however. He is currently under house
arrest in Saigon and must report to the
police daily, according to Marr. But,
"the situation has improved," he said.
Marr attributed the improvement at
least partly to the formal invitation
extended Thai by Hamline University
in St. Paul, Minn, and to efforts by
Amnesty International, Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park, and the
Committee to Invite Nguyen Huu Thai
to Stanford.
Three Steps Remain
He outlined three remaining steps
to be taken before Thai can come
here: Saigon must "eliminate the
remaining restrictions on his
freedom;" Thai must obtain an exit

visa from the Saigon government; and
he must obtain permission from the
Federal government to enter the
United States.
The exit visa will be a "more
difficult step," than the release from
police custody, Marr said. He noted
that Saigon will have to decide
between two possibly unpleasant
alternatives.
If Thai were detained indefinitely,
there would be continued pressure for
his release, according to Marr. Public
pressure in the United States might
have an influence on American foreign
aid money to Saigon, he noted, and

this might influence their decision.
If, on the other hand, Thai is
released, he will almost certainly speak
and write critically of the Saigon
government, and could become an
effective leader of the neutralist "third
force" provided for in the January,
1973, Paris Agreement, he said.
'Third Force' Leader
Thai is "one of 10 or 15 people
that could begin to assert an
independent third force" in South
Vietnamese politics, Marr added.

will probably be automatic, he said.
Marr, who has known Thai since
1965, said Thai is "seriously
interested" in the opportunity to
come to Stanford, where the
surroundings would be conducive to
"serious discussion" of journalism,
urban planning and politics in Vietnam
and other developing nations.
Marr said the Indochina Resource
Center maintains a list of political
prisoners in South Vietnam and can
provide names and biographical
information to institutions or groups
interested in individual prisoners.
Berkeley Follows Lead
He added that the University of
California at Berkeley "is following
Stanford's lead" in an attempt to free
imprisoned student leader Huynh Thu
Mam.
Before his imprisonment, Mam was
a fifth-year medical student and
chairman of South Vietnam's national
student association.
Thai was first arrested in 1966 and
held for two years without trial,
according to Marr.
He was arrested again in 1971 for
alleged involvement in a political
assassination (despite public denials by
the murdered politician's widow) and
was held, again without trial or formal
charges, until his recent release.
