# University Compromise Necessary
## 
### 
Ricardo de Anda

This statement is in reply to the article
written by Patricia Nash (Daily, May 2),
entitled "Union Propaganda and Employee
Rights." Essentially, Nash argues that
Stanford workers are already receiving a fair
shake from their employers, and that USE is
doing a disservice by threatening to strike.
Unfortunately Nash seems to have fallen
prey to the administration ploy of deluding
University workers into believing that "we
the administration are the experts, let us
continue to decide what is best for our
employees."
But the history of trade unionism in this
country is based on the self-evident
assumption that workers can speak for
themselves and that it is they who best
understand their problems and their interests.
Nash is appalled by th£ fact that USE has
the audacity to ask for her support in their
struggle with the University administration.
Indeed, USE's publicity campaign is
insignificant when compared to the
administration's full-page propaganda ads in
the Daily obviously meant to garner
sympathy for their position and break the
backs of USE.
Complicated Problems
But what is particularly disconcerting to
me is the fact that Nash holds herself out to
understand the highly complicated labor
problems facing this community without
pointing out that she herself has been a
Stanford employee for barely two months.
Of course Nash has the legal right to walk
through a picket line if she wishes, but that is
hardly an act of courage as she implies. If
there is a strike it will be the strikers and
their families who will suffer the real
hardships.
It is they who will lose their paychecks,

whose lives will be at least temporarily
dislocated, and who will face the possibility
of losing their jobs. For these reasons it is
absurd for Nash to suggest that USE is
provoking a strike.
In fact the opposite is true. The University
negotiators have brought matters to a head
by going through the motions of collective
bargaining without negotiating in good faith. ,
Good Faith Lacking
For example, on the issue of raising the
wages of USE employees to those equivalent
to like jobs in the surrounding community
(community standards), USE has already
agreed to allow the University four years to
meet their proposal rather than immediately
as they had originally demanded.
As to the medical plan — USE has agreed
to compromise by dropping their proposal
for dental coverage if the University will
reciprocate by acceding to the union request
for dependent coverage in the current
medical plan.
Both these compromises are significant,
yet the only economic compromise on the
part of the University has consisted of one
extra holiday, and raising the wages of
high-paid skilled workers five-15 percent.
The latter is not really a gift, for these
workers would have received the very same
raises under the University's own
range-adjustment plan (i.e. their skills will be
worth more outside the University if their
wages are not raised, which of course does
not apply to unskilled workers).
Bargaining in good faith involves more
than sitting down at a table. It clearly
involves a responsible approach to dealing
with the main issues and meeting
compromise with compromise.
Yet not only has the University failed to

move from their original position on the
major economic issues, but has further
compounded the problem by refusing to deal
with these issues unless the union agrees to
negotiate on their terms.
USE's proposal is eminently reasonable.
Without a cost of living increase, workers will
be forced to accept significant reductions in
buying power in these times of rampant
inflation. Without a minimum wage the
'University will continue to exploit those
unskilled workers, mostly third world, who
are especially susceptible to the high
unemployment rate in this area.
Inadequate Wages
$408 per month is hardly a living wage for
a worker with a family to support. In
demanding an increase in pension benefits,
USE is asking for nothing more than what is
currently enjoyed by the faculty and other
professional employees.
The strategy of the University is patently
clear. The demands of USE represent more to
the administration than merely an economic
headache. If USE succeeds in any way,
non-USE employees will be made aware of
the power of worker unity and organization.
Most importantly, the almost
absolute control wielded by the
administration and faculty over the affairs of
this community will begin to dissolve.
USE is prepared to meet the University's
power with the only weapon at their disposal
— the strike. But if the workers strike it will
be only because it is absolutely necessary to
gain a decent contract. It is in the interests of
all workers to support such a strike, if it
occurs, by refusing to work or by slowing
down.

prey to the administration ploy of deluding
University workers into believing that "we
the administration are the experts, let us
continue to decide what is best for our
employees."
But the history of trade unionism in this
country is based on the self-evident
assumption that workers can speak for
themselves and that it is they who best
understand their problems and their interests.
Nash is appalled by th£ fact that USE has
the audacity to ask for her support in their
struggle with the University administration.
Indeed, USE's publicity campaign is
insignificant when compared to the
administration's full-page propaganda ads in
the Daily obviously meant to garner
sympathy for their position and break the
backs of USE.
Complicated Problems
But what is particularly disconcerting to
me is the fact that Nash holds herself out to
understand the highly complicated labor
problems facing this community without
pointing out that she herself has been a
Stanford employee for barely two months.
Of course Nash has the legal right to walk
through a picket line if she wishes, but that is
hardly an act of courage as she implies. If
there is a strike it will be the strikers and
their families who will suffer the real
hardships.
It is they who will lose their paychecks,

whose lives will be at least temporarily
dislocated, and who will face the possibility
of losing their jobs. For these reasons it is
absurd for Nash to suggest that USE is
provoking a strike.
In fact the opposite is true. The University
negotiators have brought matters to a head
by going through the motions of collective
bargaining without negotiating in good faith. ,
Good Faith Lacking
For example, on the issue of raising the
wages of USE employees to those equivalent
to like jobs in the surrounding community
(community standards), USE has already
agreed to allow the University four years to
meet their proposal rather than immediately
as they had originally demanded.
As to the medical plan — USE has agreed
to compromise by dropping their proposal
for dental coverage if the University will
reciprocate by acceding to the union request
for dependent coverage in the current
medical plan.
Both these compromises are significant,
yet the only economic compromise on the
part of the University has consisted of one
extra holiday, and raising the wages of
high-paid skilled workers five-15 percent.
The latter is not really a gift, for these
workers would have received the very same
raises under the University's own
range-adjustment plan (i.e. their skills will be
worth more outside the University if their
wages are not raised, which of course does
not apply to unskilled workers).
Bargaining in good faith involves more
than sitting down at a table. It clearly
involves a responsible approach to dealing
with the main issues and meeting
compromise with compromise.
Yet not only has the University failed to

move from their original position on the
major economic issues, but has further
compounded the problem by refusing to deal
with these issues unless the union agrees to
negotiate on their terms.
USE's proposal is eminently reasonable.
Without a cost of living increase, workers will
be forced to accept significant reductions in
buying power in these times of rampant
inflation. Without a minimum wage the
'University will continue to exploit those
unskilled workers, mostly third world, who
are especially susceptible to the high
unemployment rate in this area.
Inadequate Wages
$408 per month is hardly a living wage for
a worker with a family to support. In
demanding an increase in pension benefits,
USE is asking for nothing more than what is
currently enjoyed by the faculty and other
professional employees.
The strategy of the University is patently
clear. The demands of USE represent more to
the administration than merely an economic
headache. If USE succeeds in any way,
non-USE employees will be made aware of
the power of worker unity and organization.
Most importantly, the almost
absolute control wielded by the
administration and faculty over the affairs of
this community will begin to dissolve.
USE is prepared to meet the University's
power with the only weapon at their disposal
— the strike. But if the workers strike it will
be only because it is absolutely necessary to
gain a decent contract. It is in the interests of
all workers to support such a strike, if it
occurs, by refusing to work or by slowing
down.
