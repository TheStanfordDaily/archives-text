# On Stipends For Graduate Teaching
## 
### 
Lincoln Moses 3

Your article (Daily, May
3) on the projected German TA
walkout leads me to offer through
your columns some factual
information relevant to that
situation.
First, how adequate are
teaching stipends in the
Humanities? The stipend for a
Teaching Fellow meeting a class
30-50 times a quarter is $1050.
This is fair in two senses:
(2) It approximates usual
stipends for teaching assistants in
California. (A recent brochure
entitled "HELP!" and distributed
in White Plaza described stipends
as being higher at UC Berkeley,
UCLA, USC, and Cal State,
Sacramento. I checked into these.
One of the schools pays
two-thirds what we do — and
requires literally 20 hours of work
per week. The others, after
subtracting tuition which must be
paid from them, are a little higher
— like 10 percent but require
somewhat larger teaching loads —
perhaps 10-20 percent.)
(2) Stanford stipends for
teaching are equal to or higher
than local community college
salary scales (about $3200 per
quarter for 15 units) for teachers
of the same experience and
education. Tuition is then added
to our stipend.
The main reason the University
has not chosen to have
well-trained professional teachers
do this teaching is the importance
it attaches to the support of
graduate students and to their
training as future professors.
Second, what else do we do for
teaching assistants in the
Humanities? We give them tuition
all the way to the Ph.D. (in excess
of $10,000); we give them $2100
in the years they do not teach; we

give many of them summer
support. This is the real way in
which Stanford is far more
generous to its graduate students
than any of the California
institutions said to have "higher"
stipends.
At each of those institutions at
least 50 percent of the graduate
students in Humanities at any
time are entirely on their own —
and must pay tuition.
A student who teaches four
quarters in his four years (a
typical arrangement) will receive
about $4000 in teaching stipend,
$10,000 in tuition, and $6000 in
fellowship. Thus, teaching is justly
seen as more a part of graduate
training than as "employment."
\' This philosophy accounts for
the increasing use of
Departmental Fellows Plans (the
so-called Carlsmith Plan). Here the
student is assured four years of
support at $2100 per academic
year, tuition, and $500 per
summer for three summers.
The department defines an
amount (usually about four
quarters) of teaching appropriate
to training a Ph.D. in that
discipline, and the student picks
up these duties at some time in his
studies, with no alteration in his
level of support during the
quarters he teaches.
Third, can graduate students
live on $2100 per academic year?
Some can; some need more. The
undergraduate budget of Room
and Board plus $600 comes to
$2125. The average money
received by doctoral students in
H&S in 1972-73 was $2616 (up
from $2489 the year before and
$2224 the year before that).
For this year it should grow
further, reflecting this year's

increases of $150 in the
fellowship level and $100 in the
summer support level. Some
students borrow, but not many.
Last year in the Humanities
departments 79 percent did not.
The graduate students who did
borrow averaged $1276.
Fourth, why not raise teaching
stipends anyway? The University
has vigorously pumped additional
money into graduate student
support while cutting budgets
elsewhere. That additional money
has gone into additional
fellowships, additional summer
support, additional teaching
assistantships, higher fellowship
stipends, and increased tuition
grants.

Each of these has been a more
pressing need than ensuring that
while the student is teaching his
stipend exceeds a fellowship
stipend more than it does now. I
believe these same needs are still
of higher priority than higher
teaching stipends.
We know that more money will
still be going into graduate
student support: we intend to
continue meeting tuition rises; we
expect to find support to replace
the last of the disappearing
government fellowships; we
expect to extend summer support.
Teaching stipends may not
shoulder their way ahead of these.

Your article (Daily, May
3) on the projected German TA
walkout leads me to offer through
your columns some factual
information relevant to that
situation.
First, how adequate are
teaching stipends in the
Humanities? The stipend for a
Teaching Fellow meeting a class
30-50 times a quarter is $1050.
This is fair in two senses:
(2) It approximates usual
stipends for teaching assistants in
California. (A recent brochure
entitled "HELP!" and distributed
in White Plaza described stipends
as being higher at UC Berkeley,
UCLA, USC, and Cal State,
Sacramento. I checked into these.
One of the schools pays
two-thirds what we do — and
requires literally 20 hours of work
per week. The others, after
subtracting tuition which must be
paid from them, are a little higher
— like 10 percent but require
somewhat larger teaching loads —
perhaps 10-20 percent.)
(2) Stanford stipends for
teaching are equal to or higher
than local community college
salary scales (about $3200 per
quarter for 15 units) for teachers
of the same experience and
education. Tuition is then added
to our stipend.
The main reason the University
has not chosen to have
well-trained professional teachers
do this teaching is the importance
it attaches to the support of
graduate students and to their
training as future professors.
Second, what else do we do for
teaching assistants in the
Humanities? We give them tuition
all the way to the Ph.D. (in excess
of $10,000); we give them $2100
in the years they do not teach; we

give many of them summer
support. This is the real way in
which Stanford is far more
generous to its graduate students
than any of the California
institutions said to have "higher"
stipends.
At each of those institutions at
least 50 percent of the graduate
students in Humanities at any
time are entirely on their own —
and must pay tuition.
A student who teaches four
quarters in his four years (a
typical arrangement) will receive
about $4000 in teaching stipend,
$10,000 in tuition, and $6000 in
fellowship. Thus, teaching is justly
seen as more a part of graduate
training than as "employment."
\' This philosophy accounts for
the increasing use of
Departmental Fellows Plans (the
so-called Carlsmith Plan). Here the
student is assured four years of
support at $2100 per academic
year, tuition, and $500 per
summer for three summers.
The department defines an
amount (usually about four
quarters) of teaching appropriate
to training a Ph.D. in that
discipline, and the student picks
up these duties at some time in his
studies, with no alteration in his
level of support during the
quarters he teaches.
Third, can graduate students
live on $2100 per academic year?
Some can; some need more. The
undergraduate budget of Room
and Board plus $600 comes to
$2125. The average money
received by doctoral students in
H&S in 1972-73 was $2616 (up
from $2489 the year before and
$2224 the year before that).
For this year it should grow
further, reflecting this year's

increases of $150 in the
fellowship level and $100 in the
summer support level. Some
students borrow, but not many.
Last year in the Humanities
departments 79 percent did not.
The graduate students who did
borrow averaged $1276.
Fourth, why not raise teaching
stipends anyway? The University
has vigorously pumped additional
money into graduate student
support while cutting budgets
elsewhere. That additional money
has gone into additional
fellowships, additional summer
support, additional teaching
assistantships, higher fellowship
stipends, and increased tuition
grants.

Each of these has been a more
pressing need than ensuring that
while the student is teaching his
stipend exceeds a fellowship
stipend more than it does now. I
believe these same needs are still
of higher priority than higher
teaching stipends.
We know that more money will
still be going into graduate
student support: we intend to
continue meeting tuition rises; we
expect to find support to replace
the last of the disappearing
government fellowships; we
expect to extend summer support.

has gone into additional
fellowships, additional summer
support, additional teaching
assistantships, higher fellowship
stipends, and increased tuition
grants.

Each of these has been a more
pressing need than ensuring that
while the student is teaching his
stipend exceeds a fellowship
stipend more than it does now. I
believe these same needs are still
of higher priority than higher
teaching stipends.
We know that more money will
still be going into graduate
student support: we intend to
continue meeting tuition rises; we
expect to find support to replace
the last of the disappearing
government fellowships; we
expect to extend summer support.
Teaching stipends may not
shoulder their way ahead of these.
