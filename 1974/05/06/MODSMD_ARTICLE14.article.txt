Considerations For USE
Editor:
In the past few weeks there
have been quite a few articles
addressing the issue of the
transactions between the USE and
the University. I would like to ask
the head of the USE, Jim Berk, if
his union has taken the following
problems under consideration
when formulating their demands.
First, has there been any
consideration by the USE as to
the effects of their proposed
contract on the surrounding
community, and its problems with
inflation? Second, has the union
thought about the effect that its
package may have on the students
of the University?
The first point to the best of
my knowledge is never the
concern of unions. The basic
function of unions is to put forth
the "problems" of their
membership. But something that
all unions do not even consider a
part of their responsibility "to their
membership is that their own
demands are one of the major, if
not the major, contributions to
the inflation which possesses this
country.
The second point has a direct
connection with the first. We are
all in this squeeze together. If the
University cannot come up with
the funds because of its long term
commitments, then where is the
money to come from?
Should the students, many of
whom are paying some or all of
their way through school be asked
to come up with the additional
funds to pay these raises?
Berk and the membership of
USE are being quite inconsiderate
of those people who are not
within the confines of the union.
There is a basic idea which
perhaps he has not heard of; if all
those possessed of a problem will
work together then the chances of
its solution will be increased.
As things now stand. Berk and
the USE have abandoned this
tenet for the modern American
tack of "cover thine own ass,"
which to say the least is
counterproductive to the general
betterment of society.

I would like to clarify a
misinterpretation on a rather
complicated matter at the end of
a story about me (Daily, May 1).
Private retirement benefits to
women under a company plan are
often less than those paid to men
earning the same amount over the
same number of years, even
though the same yearly premium
rate on their salaries has been paid
by the company to the insurer.
This is because females have, on
the average, a longer life
expectancy than males, and the
actuarial relationship between
benefit and premium takes this
into account.
Non-discrimination, to my
mind, does not require an
employer to pay higher premium
rates on behalf of his women
employees than he, is paying for
his male employees. However, if
mortality data for women were
"refined" (not "redefined") to
include two sets of data — one for
women who work 35 hours or
more per week outside of the
home and one for women who do
not work outside of the home —
the differential in the relevant
mortality rates by sex may be
narrowed.
To require higher premium
payments by the employer in
order to equalize annuity benefits
for women and men employees,
using the existing data, would
tend to discourage hiring on the
margin (other things being equal)
of a woman as compared to hiring
a man.
In reference to Social Security
or federal government benefits. 1
believe that married working
women can claim discrimination.
To go into greater detail about
this, at this time. 1 feel is on my
part unwise, since I have just
accepted an appointment by the
Secretary of HEW to the Advisory
Council on Social Security which
is required by law to review the
status of the four social securit',
trust funds, the scope of coverage,
adequacy of benefits, etc.

I would like to clarify a
misinterpretation on a rather
complicated matter at the end of
a story about me (Daily, May 1).
Private retirement benefits to
women under a company plan are
often less than those paid to men
earning the same amount over the
same number of years, even
though the same yearly premium
rate on their salaries has been paid
by the company to the insurer.
This is because females have, on
the average, a longer life
expectancy than males, and the
actuarial relationship between
benefit and premium takes this
into account.
Non-discrimination, to my
mind, does not require an
employer to pay higher premium
rates on behalf of his women
employees than he, is paying for
his male employees. However, if
mortality data for women were
"refined" (not "redefined") to
include two sets of data — one for
women who work 35 hours or
more per week outside of the
home and one for women who do
not work outside of the home —
the differential in the relevant
mortality rates by sex may be
narrowed.
To require higher premium
payments by the employer in
order to equalize annuity benefits
for women and men employees,
using the existing data, would
tend to discourage hiring on the
margin (other things being equal)
of a woman as compared to hiring
a man.
In reference to Social Security
or federal government benefits. 1
believe that married working
women can claim discrimination.
To go into greater detail about
this, at this time. 1 feel is on my
part unwise, since I have just
accepted an appointment by the
Secretary of HEW to the Advisory
Council on Social Security which
is required by law to review the
status of the four social securit',
trust funds, the scope of coverage,
adequacy of benefits, etc.

Considerations For USE
Editor:
In the past few weeks there
have been quite a few articles
addressing the issue of the
transactions between the USE and
the University. I would like to ask
the head of the USE, Jim Berk, if
his union has taken the following
problems under consideration
when formulating their demands.
First, has there been any
consideration by the USE as to
the effects of their proposed
contract on the surrounding
community, and its problems with
inflation? Second, has the union
thought about the effect that its
package may have on the students
of the University?
The first point to the best of
my knowledge is never the
concern of unions. The basic
function of unions is to put forth
the "problems" of their
membership. But something that
all unions do not even consider a
part of their responsibility "to their
membership is that their own
demands are one of the major, if
not the major, contributions to
the inflation which possesses this
country.
The second point has a direct
connection with the first. We are
all in this squeeze together. If the
University cannot come up with
the funds because of its long term
commitments, then where is the
money to come from?
Should the students, many of
whom are paying some or all of
their way through school be asked
to come up with the additional
funds to pay these raises?
Berk and the membership of
USE are being quite inconsiderate
of those people who are not
within the confines of the union.
There is a basic idea which
perhaps he has not heard of; if all
those possessed of a problem will
work together then the chances of
its solution will be increased.
As things now stand. Berk and
the USE have abandoned this
tenet for the modern American
tack of "cover thine own ass,"
which to say the least is
counterproductive to the general
betterment of society.
