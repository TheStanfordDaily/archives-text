# Wanted: Statistics Graduates

'Ten years ago a Ph.D. in
statistics could go anywhere. Five
years ago people were beginning
to worry about overproduction.
In the last year or two demands
for Ph.D.'s have gone up, but the
production has not matched the
increase in demand," says Prof.
Ingram Olkin, chairman of
Statistics Department.
In a recent campus interview
Olkin and Prof. Bradley Efron, a
former University Fellow,
emphasized the extension of the
application of statistics to new
and diverse problems.
"Our department is receiving
demands for people from
universities, government, and
from private industry. Much of
this increased demand is related to
the increased use of statistics in
many fields, in economic research,
in medicine, and in the legal
field," Olkin said.
"Sampling evidence is now
admissible in courts. Probability
arguments can now be used. For
example, in one major case, hair
comparisons were made on
sampling evidence."
Efron himself testified for the
defense in the Angela Davis trial.
"They thought the jury wasn't
being chosen in a fair way, that
voter registration lists didn't
represent the average citizen,"
Efron said. "I testified to that
effect."
Economic Research
Efron, former editor of the
Journal of the American
Statistical Association, said
demand for statistics in economic
research has increased. "For
example, experiments are being
done by places like the Rand
Corp. in which the economic
destiny of a family is controlled
for several years by the
apportioning of money. Other
experiments are being run to see
the effect of a new medical

insurance plan, or to see what
effect a new income tax will have.
"Generally speaking, people
are more willing now to undertake
large experiments. And they're
collecting large sets of numbers
that have to be analyzed."
Efron has been associated with
the Medical School for the last
eight years. Statistics now are
being used in studies of pregnant
women working in operating
rooms, he noted. "Gases used in
anesthesia may increase the
danger of spontaneous abortion.
Currently we're investigating this
data."
Responsibility Question
As the uses of statistics
increase, Olkin said, the question
of responsibility in the field
becomes an ever more important
one. "The general tendency is as
with the legal profession. If you
give me data, I'll do the problem
objectively.
"But if we look at what's gone
on with smoking and cancer, we
see the problem is more
complicated. Even statisticians are
prone to jump to conclusions in
favor of the social good. Let's say
that we know that smoking
doesn't do anyone any good. How
do we deal with that
prejudgment? How do you get an
objective study of the data?
Unsolved Problems
"Many serious problems are
being raised that we, as
statisticians, haven't solved. For
example, someone will do a study
and announce the results, which
can be extremely important,
whether on MSG (monosodium
glutinate), or the Head Start
program, or on smoking and
cancer. One problem is that the
profession has no formal
scrutinizing procedure."
This question, Olkin adds, is
now under study by a federal
commission.
'The air of the study is to
develop procedures and standards
for presentations of statistics and
to try to answer questions such as
'Who owns the data? Is the data in
public domain or does anyone
have the right to it? After all,
someone can do a study in a room
and he can go out and publicize it
and no one can verify it.
"These are all questions we
have to deal with, and they are
more pressing with the
enlargement of areas of use, with
the problem of the power of
numbers, and the belief of people

in numbers."
The Statistics Department will
be celebrating its 25th anniversary
later this spring. Albert Bowker,
presently chancellor of UC, was
the first chairman of the
department.
"What Bowker conceived of,"
Olkin said, "was that statistics
should have a close liaison with
substantive fields, and that the
theory generally should be
developed in terms of application.
"Look at it this way. There are
two kinds of consulting that our
department can do. First we can
give straight information. For
example, we can refer someone to
a book. That's like the
information booth at Macy's.

"The other kind is of a
different order. It requires a much
more intimate relationship with
the problem. You have to build
into your picture all the complex
pieces of information. You have
to actually develop something
new."

now under study by a federal
commission.

develop procedures and standards

someone can do a study in a room
and he can go out and publicize it
and no one can verify it.

'Ten years ago a Ph.D. in
statistics could go anywhere. Five
years ago people were beginning
to worry about overproduction.
In the last year or two demands
for Ph.D.'s have gone up, but the
production has not matched the
increase in demand," says Prof.
Ingram Olkin, chairman of
Statistics Department.
In a recent campus interview
Olkin and Prof. Bradley Efron, a
former University Fellow,
emphasized the extension of the
application of statistics to new
and diverse problems.
"Our department is receiving
demands for people from
universities, government, and
from private industry. Much of
this increased demand is related to
the increased use of statistics in
many fields, in economic research,
in medicine, and in the legal
field," Olkin said.
"Sampling evidence is now
admissible in courts. Probability
arguments can now be used. For
example, in one major case, hair
comparisons were made on
sampling evidence."
Efron himself testified for the
defense in the Angela Davis trial.
"They thought the jury wasn't
being chosen in a fair way, that
voter registration lists didn't
represent the average citizen,"
Efron said. "I testified to that
effect."
Economic Research
Efron, former editor of the
Journal of the American
Statistical Association, said
demand for statistics in economic
research has increased. "For
example, experiments are being
done by places like the Rand
Corp. in which the economic
destiny of a family is controlled
for several years by the
apportioning of money. Other
experiments are being run to see
the effect of a new medical

insurance plan, or to see what
effect a new income tax will have.
"Generally speaking, people
are more willing now to undertake
large experiments. And they're
collecting large sets of numbers
that have to be analyzed."
Efron has been associated with
the Medical School for the last
eight years. Statistics now are
being used in studies of pregnant
women working in operating
rooms, he noted. "Gases used in
anesthesia may increase the
danger of spontaneous abortion.
Currently we're investigating this
data."
Responsibility Question
As the uses of statistics
increase, Olkin said, the question
of responsibility in the field
becomes an ever more important
one. "The general tendency is as
with the legal profession. If you
give me data, I'll do the problem
objectively.
"But if we look at what's gone
on with smoking and cancer, we
see the problem is more
complicated. Even statisticians are
prone to jump to conclusions in
favor of the social good. Let's say
that we know that smoking
doesn't do anyone any good. How
do we deal with that
prejudgment? How do you get an
objective study of the data?
Unsolved Problems
"Many serious problems are
being raised that we, as
statisticians, haven't solved. For
example, someone will do a study
and announce the results, which
can be extremely important,
whether on MSG (monosodium
glutinate), or the Head Start
program, or on smoking and
cancer. One problem is that the
profession has no formal
scrutinizing procedure."

large experiments. And they're
collecting large sets of numbers
that have to be analyzed."
Efron has been associated with
the Medical School for the last
eight years. Statistics now are
being used in studies of pregnant
women working in operating
rooms, he noted. "Gases used in
anesthesia may increase the
danger of spontaneous abortion.
Currently we're investigating this
data."
Responsibility Question
As the uses of statistics
increase, Olkin said, the question
of responsibility in the field
becomes an ever more important
one. "The general tendency is as
with the legal profession. If you
give me data, I'll do the problem
objectively.
"But if we look at what's gone
on with smoking and cancer, we
see the problem is more
complicated. Even statisticians are
prone to jump to conclusions in
favor of the social good. Let's say
that we know that smoking
doesn't do anyone any good. How
do we deal with that
prejudgment? How do you get an
objective study of the data?
Unsolved Problems
"Many serious problems are
being raised that we, as
statisticians, haven't solved. For
example, someone will do a study
and announce the results, which
can be extremely important,
whether on MSG (monosodium
glutinate), or the Head Start
program, or on smoking and
cancer. One problem is that the
profession has no formal
scrutinizing procedure."
This question, Olkin adds, is
now under study by a federal
commission.
'The air of the study is to
develop procedures and standards
for presentations of statistics and
to try to answer questions such as
'Who owns the data? Is the data in
public domain or does anyone
have the right to it? After all,
someone can do a study in a room
and he can go out and publicize it
and no one can verify it.
"These are all questions we
have to deal with, and they are
more pressing with the
enlargement of areas of use, with
the problem of the power of
numbers, and the belief of people

in numbers."
The Statistics Department will
be celebrating its 25th anniversary
later this spring. Albert Bowker,
presently chancellor of UC, was
the first chairman of the
department.
"What Bowker conceived of,"
Olkin said, "was that statistics
should have a close liaison with
substantive fields, and that the
theory generally should be
developed in terms of application.
"Look at it this way. There are
two kinds of consulting that our
department can do. First we can
give straight information. For
example, we can refer someone to
a book. That's like the
information booth at Macy's.

"The other kind is of a
different order. It requires a much
more intimate relationship with
the problem. You have to build
into your picture all the complex
pieces of information. You have
to actually develop something
new."
