# Former Student Joins Scientists In U.S.-Soviet Exchange Program
## 
### 
A recently graduated Stanford
Ph.D. in chemistry, Michael R.
MacLaury, is among the first three
American exchange scientists now
in the Soviet Union to conduct
research under the new
U.S.-Soviet Science and
Technology Agreement
:announced in May 1972, by
President Nixon and General
Secretary Leonard Brezhnev.
MacLaury, of Pacific Grove,
left last month to spend six
months at the Institute for
Catalysis in Siberia's "science
city," Novosibirsk, working under

Yu I. Yermakov.
MacLaury studies here under
Chemistry Prof. James P.
Collman, specializing in inorganic
chemistry and catalysis. His
research at Novosibirsk will center
on catalysis, widely used in the
chemical industry and particularly
in oil refining.
Charles L. Kibby of the Gulf
Research and Development
Company in Pittsburgh, Pa., and
Thomas A. Weil of the University
of Chicago, are the other two
chemists involved in the scientist
exchange. They are doing research

at other Russian laboratories.
Their appointments were
announced by the National
Science Foundation which
administers the Chemical Catalysis
Program under the international
agreement.
The program is under the
chairmanship of Cal Tech Prof.
James D. Baldeschwieler, formerly
of Stanford. Collman is a
coordinator of the program. A
Russian exchange scientist is
scheduled to spend six months in
chemical research here beginning
next fall.
