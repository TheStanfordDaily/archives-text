# Foreign Students To Face Difficulties In Summer Employment Opportunities
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
A change in the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's policy on permission
for summer employment will make it more
difficult for foreign students to get summer
jobs off-campus, according to Bechtel
International Center Director Lee Zeigler.
The policy, which applies only to foreign
students who are already here, is in effect for
this summer only and could change again
next year, Zeigler stated.
Foreign students on the F-l, or
independent student visa will now have to
obtain work permission from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service,
rather than from school officials.
The decision was intended to "protect
summer job opportunities for American
youth, including Vietnam veterans and
members of minority groups," said
Immigration Commissioner Leonard F.
Chapman, Jr. in a Department of Justice
news release.
Manpower Administration Advice
Chapman stated that the decision was
based on labor market advice from the U.S.
Manpower Administration.
"For several years the Manpower
Administration has advised us that
unemployment among American youth is of
such magnitude that summer employment of
aliens is depriving young Americans of
needed employment opportunities," he said.
Zeigler contested this statement, saying
that in proportion to the total work force,
the total number of foreign students working
"is so small as to fade into insignificance."
Statistics
In support of his argument, Zeigler cited
statistics from a survey taken this winter by
the National Association for Foreign Student
Affairs. According to the survey,
approximately 30,000 foreign students were
employed in the summer of 1973 — only
.037 percent of the total work force.
Zeigler felt that the new policy reflected
the prevalence of an "isolationist" attitude in

the government climate. He observed that
general support of international educational
exchange has been declining over the past
five years.
Chapman stated that since taking office
last November, he has found that foreign
students had been allowed to engage in
employment under the summer program
without establishing financial need. He
commented this policy was "not warranted."
About 80 percent of the foreign students
here will be affected by the policy change,
estimated Foreign Student Adviser Clifford
Clarke.
Applying for work permission will take
longer than before, and even then, there is no
guarantee that the student will qualify and
that permission will be granted, Clarke
observed. "It's up for grabs—we don't know
if the students are going to get jobs," said
Clarke.
"Unfair" Policy
Zeigler considers the new policy unfair
because it cuts options off the already
limited financial aid opportunities available
to foreign students, a situation amounting to
"double jeopardy," he said.
The new policy could also discourage
foreign students from coming to Stanford,
Zeigler said, "if students realize they're going
to have more problems generating funds than
before."
Some of the disadvantages already facing
foreign students seeking employment were
pointed out by Director of Student
Employment Pam Evans.
Foreign students would generally have a
difficult time getting any sort of government
funded job because such positions usually
require U.S. citizenship or permanent
resident status, Evans said.
Moreover, the fact that companies may
often use summer employment as a
"recruiting mechanism" makes it
"unfeasible" for them to hire foreign
students who would not be able to stay on at
permanent positions.

How do the foreign students feel about
the matter?
Chon Hock Leow, an undergraduate in
electrical engineering, said many students
would be affected by the change in policy
because "a lot of foreign students do depend
on making some kind of money during the
summer." As for himself, "I'll be dead if I
can't work this summer," Leow said.
Ashok Shenvi, graduate student in
chemistry, commented that those most
affected would be the students who come
here "on their own" with neither government
nor University financial aid.
"Some people (do ] come here on their
own, hoping that they will be able to work
during the summer to pay for their
schooling," Shenvi observed.
Efficiency Questioned
Michael Pong, an undergraduate in
electrical engineering, questioned the
efficiency of the new policy. "With all the
bureaucracy—who knows how long it will
take [to get permission]?" By the time a
student got permission to work it might be
too late to find a job, Pong said.
Pong didn't think that the new policy
would discourage foreign students from
coming to the United States. He felt that if
potential students were told that there was
no way for them to make money here, "not
many people would believe [it]."
Leow expressed concern for the foreign
students who might not be able to secure
work permission. "What happens to students
who aren't given permission to work and who
don't have funds to go home?— Who takes
care of them?" he asked.
Zeigler felt that it was "too early to tell
what impact [the new policy] will have
-locally."
"In the past we've had good relations with
the immigration service in San Francisco,"
Zeigler said. "We're hoping for its
cooperation in giving our students permits."
