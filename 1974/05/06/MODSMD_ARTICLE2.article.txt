PARIS (AP) — French voters
yesterday sent Socialist leader
Francois Mitterrand and Finance
Minister Valery Giscard d'Estaing into
a runoff election May 19 that will
make one of them president of France.
With official tallies covering all but
a handful of the returns, Mitterrand
had 10,935,763, or 43.36 percent of
the balloting; Giscard d'Estaing,
candidate of the Independent
Republican party, had 8,286,382
votes, or 32.85 percent, and Gaullist
vandidate Jacques Chaban-Delmas won
3,693,168 votes, or 14.64 percent.
The rest of the votes were divided
among nine other candidates in a
heavy turnout of France's more than
30.5 million voters who cast ballots
under cloudy skies and scattered
showers.

Mitterrand and Giscard d'Estaing
said they were confident of victory.
The finance minister was promised
support by Premier Pierre Messmer
and other Gaullist chieftains, although
Chaban-Delmas refused to say whether
he would support Giscard d'Estaing.
Communist boss Georges Marchais,
whose party is officially backing
Mitterrand, urged more support for
the Socialist leader. The marshalling of
forces behind both candidates is likely
to make the final outcome very close,
analysts said.
Both candidates have said they
would pursue essentially the same
foreign policy as the late President
Georges Pompidou — national
independence, friendship for the
United States and a more positive role
in European affairs.
