# Research To Affect Agriculture, Medicine
## Prof: Geneticists Won't Create Supermen

Research in molecular genetics
will have major consequences for
curing the sick and for developing
novel plants of particular
advantage to agriculture rather
than creating supermen, said
Biochemistry Ptof. David
Hogness.
"I can imagine attempts to
create particularly advantageous
domestic animals and plants,"
said Hogness, "but I do not find
that schemes to create supermen
by such techniques are credible."
Many laymen, including
Congressmen, have often
expressed concern about future
possibilities of "perfecting the
race" by altering genes.
But Hogness, writing about the
human use of genetics in a new
book The Great Adventure, says
no one would want to perform
such potentially horrendous
experiment.
Practical Advantages
With the exception of efforts
to cure hereditary defects and
finding answers to diseases such as
cancer, the practical advantages of
man's search for new gene
combinations will be restricted to
agriculture, according to Hogness.

Among the possibilities would
be to create plants that would not
need nitrogen fertilizers, the
biochemistry professor said. "This
might be done by inserting
bacterial genes that allow the
needed nitrogen to be obtained
from the air, rather than from
fertilizers in the soil."
In agriculture, knowledge of
heredity has allowed construction
of new plant varieties "because
the aims are better defined, the
system is simpler .. . and ethical
objections are tenuous," Hogness
said.
But man has only just begun to
tap the reservoir of genes made
available by centuries of mutation
and natural selection.
Crop Yields Augmented
"The yield from different
crops has been augmented by
selecting for resistance to
particular pests or for growth
cycles to fit different growing
seasons," he said.

"Short, stiff-strawed rice
varieties developed at the Rice
Institute in the Philippines
increased the yield from 1,200 to
more than 9,000 pounds per acre.
"This extraordinary increase
soon allowed the Philippines to
become an exporter of rice, and
we may expect that the food
supply will be profoundly altered
as these strains are introduced
throughout Asia.
"Seedless watermelons are now
available to those with inhibitions
about spitting, and pineapples
have been developed that will fit a
number two can."
Genetic Information
Hogness said there is some
urgency in preparing a proper base
by moving genetics to the center
of man's educational experience.
"The knowledge we have acquired
regarding the molecular structure
of genetic information forms the
unifying link and fundamental
basis for all terrestrial life."

"It indicates that man's
potential for changing life through
the use of his intellect is far
greater than we would have
guessed even 30 years ago. It is
much as if we had taken a drink
from Alice's elixir, and had
shrunk smaller and smaller, until
we could see the individual atoms
of which genes are composed."
Hogness said pessimists who
fear the advance of man's
knowledge in molecular genetics
are unduly concerned. "In any
case, it is not possible to halt that
advance, so interrelated are all
aspects of biology," he said.
'Cure For Cancer'
"The millions we spend on a
'cure for cancer' will inevitably
reveal some of the basic
mechanisms for the integration of
viral DNA into human
chromosomes ..."
(DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid
is the substance of heredity. Its
purpose is to perpetuate a species

by cell division and provide the
information for constructing the
proteins that develop and operate
the cell).
In experiments here, animal
genes have been inserted into
bacteria, Hogness added, but we
may reasonably suppose that in
the future it will be possible to
insert bacterial genes into plants
or animals, or mix genes.
"The implications of this type
of genetic mixing are indeed
radical," Hogness said. "We can
imagine the insertion of new genes
into the cells of genetic cripples to
provide the functions that cannot
be contributed by the defective
genes."
He said it is recognized that
many diseases are hereditary.
There are about 2,000 of these
ranging from anemias to diabetes
and mongolism. As more of these
are treated and prevented, they
will occupy an increasing fraction
of the physician's load.
