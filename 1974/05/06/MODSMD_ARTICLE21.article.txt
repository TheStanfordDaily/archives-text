# The
						Establishment's Justification
## 
### PHILIP HEIMLICH Third of Four Parts 
How do members of the intercollegiate
athletic establishment justify their programs
in light of mounting criticism of the
professionalism involved? Officials
interviewed by the Daily offered numerous
justifications.
Vince Gibson., head football coach at
Kansas State, points out the value of a
successful football team in building spirit
among students and alumni.
Before Gibson took over in 1967, the
Wildcats had compiled an 8-60-1 record over
seven seasons. Under his leadership the
school has built a new stadium, an $800,000
athletic dorm (known as the "Sheraton
Gibson"), not to mention a winning football
team.
aince then, he explains, donations from
alumni have more than doubled. Purple, the
team's color, can be seen everywhere in
Manhattan, Kansas. "I told the people that
we got to have purple pride," Gibson has
stated, "I even have purple boots and I wear
purple underwear."
Oregon State coach Dee Andros believes
that a sound and aggressive intercollegiate
athletic program is an integral part of an
educational institution. "Notice how schools
like the University of Chicago have gone
down since they dropped football," he says.
"There's nothing to bring the alumni back
together."
Andros feels that a successful football
team is a great source of public relations for
universities. "You just can't buy that kind of
ink anywhere else."
Later Challenges
After 25 years of coaching, Jim Sweeney
of Washington State swears by the values of
football. "College football," he says,
"prepares a boy to meet other challenges in
later life. It's a pride thing, part of the
American way of life."
Gibson agrees that the athlete gets a good

deal more out of the experience than just a
scholarship. "It teaches you to compete in
business or anything else, to work for what
you get."
The athlete, Andros adds, feels a great
deal of pride in being able to "earn" his way
through school. "He deserves his scholarship
and extra tutoring, if it's necessary, in return
for the time, blood and sweat he has put into
it."
One of the arguments frequently
mentioned in support of the present system
is that it serves as a means of social mobility
for disadvantaged youngsters. A football
scholarship, says Arizona State coach Frank
Kush, gives a boy who would otherwise not
be able to attend college the opportunity to
do so.
This theory has been particularly
emphasized in regard to minorities. "While
the black athlete may have been exploited in
minor instances," says Gibson, "sports have
opened up an avenue for him to survive by
giving him a way to go to college."
Many Misled
Critics, however, disagree with this
assessment. They charge that while a small
percentage of disadvantaged youth benefit
from collegiate athletics, the rest are misled
into believing that the only way they can
succeed in life is through sports.
NCAA figures, in fact, indicate that only
one out of every 30 high school football
players ever gets a chance to play college ball,
and fewer than one in 100 gets an athletic
scholarship.
Jack Scott, who "escaped" a Pennsylvania
coal-mining town through the assistance of
an athletic scholarship to Stanford, writes
that "Schoolboys who spend four years of
high school dreaming of collegiate gridiron
glory are suddenly confronted by reality on
graduation day.
"For every Broadway Joe Namath there
are hundreds of sad, dissillusioned men
standing on the street corners and sitting in

the beer halls of Pennsylvania towns such as
Scranton, Beaver Falls, and Altoona."
This "myth of social advancement," it is
alleged, has been most severely perpetrated
on black youngsters. "Gifted black athletes
will usually make out all right, but what
happens," asks Scott, "to the thousands of
young unathletic black children whose only
heroes are sports stars?"
Criticisms Discounted
John McKay, athletic director and
football coach at USC, discounts these
criticisms. "They criticize everything today,
including childbirth," he says. McKay feels
that stars like Mike Garrett and O.J.
Simpson, who rose from poor surroundings,
have served as an inspiration to
underprivileged youngsters everywhere.
Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr., on the other
hand, director of New York University's
Institute for Afro-American affairs, feels that
these young athletes have been exploited
more than anything else.
"We need more education," he has stated.
"Black youngsters pour too much time and
energy into sports. They're deluded and
seduced by the athletic flesh-peddlers, used
for public amusement — and discarded."
Andros concedes that his black players at
Oregon State do not always graduate.
"True," he says, some of them have not
reached their goals, but who can say they're
not better citizens from just hanging around
the university for four years."
Jerry Tarkanian, a former basketball
coach at Long Beach State and now coach at
Nevada-Las Vegas, also admits that the
number of players on his basketball teams
there that graduated was "not real high. It's
about 50 percent.
"But I don't buy that exploitation stuff,"
he says. "Just because a kid from a ghetto
comes here and doesn't get a degree, it
doesn't mean he was exploited. He's going to
pick up something while he's here."

SUCCESSFUL SIDONE — Paul Sidone, who turns professional today,
ended his Stanford career Saturday with a doubles win. Sidone,
playing with about 10 partners in his four years, boasts an incredible
22-1 doubles record.
