# Golfers Enter Southern Tourney
## 
### 
Their first tournament victory
safely in hand, Stanford's golfers
begin preparation for a more
important title today and
tomorrow at the Pacific Eight
Southern Division championships
in Los Angeles.
The Cards, who defeated San
Jose State, USC and 27 other
teams in Stanford's U.S.
Collegiate Invitational last week,
hope to use the Southern Division
tourney as a "training ground" for
next weekend's Pacific Eight
championships, according to
coach Bud Finger.
"We're obviously trying to win
the Southern Division," Finger
said, "but the Pac-B's are what
really count. Hopefully the
Southern tournament will help us
get our games in shape." Stanford
will host the 72-hole Pac-8 event
on May 17-18.
The four Southern Division

schools (Stanford, USC, UCLA,
Cal) will play 36 holes today at
Hillcrest Country Club in Los
Angeles, with an 18-hole final
round scheduled for tomorrow.
Stanford and USC are expected to
dominate the team competition,
although improving UCLA could
be a factor. The Bruins upset the
Trojans 29-25 in a dual match last
week.
Individual favorites include
U.S. Collegiate Invitational
champion Dave Baskins of
Stanford, UCLA's Jim Porter,
Cal's Don Compton and USC stars
Craig Stadler and Mark Pfeil.
Representing Stanford will be
Baskins, Aly Trompas, George
Pettinger, Conrad Nilmeier, Glenn
Goethels and Bob Harrington.
Harrington, a senior who hasn't
played in a varsity match this
year, earned the right to challenge
Brent Murray with a strong

performance while playing
unattached in the U.S. Collegiate
Invitational.
Harrington then fired rounds
of 74-70 in the 36-hole challenge
match, defeating the freshman
star by 12 shots. Ironically,
Stanford's last lineup change
occurred when Murray edged Tom
Mason last February in a similar
challenge match.
Murray, Stanford's top
performer in March and early
April tournaments, has slumped in
recent weeks.
