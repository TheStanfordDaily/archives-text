# Netters Post 14-1 Record
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER Ho-hum 
You probably won't be too
shocked to learn that Stanford's
varsity tennis team won its final
two dual matches of the year, 9-0
over Washington Friday and 6-3
over California Saturday at the
Varsity Courts.
And so, the Cardinals end their
dual match season with a
disappointing record of 14-1.
Disappointing? Well, according
to coach Dick Gould, "we should
have been 15-0. We're the best
team. And if Pat DuPre hadn't
gotten sick at UCLA, we would
have been undefeated."
If you read these predictable
tennis articles every week, you
know that this is about the spot
where the week's best performers
are singled out.
"I thought Chico Hagey and
Gene Mayer did outstanding
jobs," Gould stated, without
waiting for the predictable
question. The coach indicated
that either or both players could
move up into the starting lineup
for the Pacific Eight tournament
May 16-18, depending on how
they do in this week's California
State Championships at Alpine
Hills.
Friday, Jim Delaney, John
Whitlinger, Nick Saviano, Mark
Mitchell, Hagey and Chip Fisher
all won their matches. Delaney
and Fisher both played poor
tennis and were forced into three
sets.
Delaney played much better
Saturday in avenging a loss to
Cal's Trey Waltke, 6-3, 6-3. Other
singles wins came from Whitlinger,
who fell asleep leading 6-3, 4-0
and had to settle for a 6-3, 4-6,
6-0 win over Peter Campbell,
Saviano, Hagey and Gene Mayer.
Mitchell lost to Chris Sylvan
7-6, 6-3. The big Bear freshman,
who wore gold basketball shorts,
also teamed with Waltke to beat
Saviano-Mitchell at doubles and
has now beaten Stanford foes all
four times he has played them.
