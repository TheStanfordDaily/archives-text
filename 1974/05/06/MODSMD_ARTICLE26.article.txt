# Cards Sweep USC In L.A., Tie For League Lead
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
All year long, questions have been asked
about the Stanford baseball team. For
example: (1) Why are the Cardinals so
inconsistent? (2) What's wrong with the
pitching'? (3) Are the Cards ever going to play
up to their potential?
Well, last weekend the Stanford Cardinals
stopped listening to questions and began
providing some answers. Like Stanford 4,
USC 1 on Friday; Stanford 7, USC 0; and
Stanford 6, USC 5 in Saturday's
doubleheader.
That's right, the Cards did the
unbelievable! Stanford swept all three games
from USC, four-time defending NCAA
champions, in Los Angeles. As a result, the
Cards came home tied with the Trojans at the
top of the Pacific Eight Southern Division
with 9-6 records and just three games to be
played.
Stanford (21-21 overall) winds up the
conference schedule with California (6-9)
while USC takes on UCLA (6-9).
Non-League Games
The Cards, who reached the .500 mark for
the first time since the first week of the
season, host San Francisco today at 2:30
p.m. in Sunken Diamond. Stanford plays Cal
tomorrow here in a non-conference game
broadcast on KZSU (90.1 FM) at 2:30.
"It was no fluke," said Stanford head
coach Ray Young, about the sweep of one of
the nation's top baseball teams. It's been a
long time since anyone can remember a
Stanford sweep of USC. And, the last time
the Trojans were swept was 1969, when
UCLA turned the trick en route to the
NCAA championship.
The Pac-8 championship is "in our
hands, now," said Young.
If both teams were to finish the season
with the same records, Stanford would win
the championship on the basis of the
head-to-head record between the two teams.
Stanford has won five out of six games

against USC.
On Hot Streak
Before making the trip to Los Angeles
Stanford had won four straight games to
bring its season mark to 18-21 and
conference record to 6-6. One could see that
if the Cards were to get off to a good start in
L.A. anything could happen.
That spark came in the form of second
baseman Joe Lamoure, who led off Friday's
game with a home run. Then, a few moments
later Bob Hampton belted his third home run
in three games to keep the Cards going.
Saturday, the Cards didn't stop Hying as
Mike Williamson hurled his second straight
shutout in a week as USC was humbled 7-0 in
the first game.
Cards 4. USC 1
Al Arthur pitched a brilliant three-hitter
in bringing his conference earned run average
down to 1.11. He gave up no walks and
collected seven strikeouts.
"Everybody just did an outstanding job,"
said Arthur.
Pitching coach Tom Dunton was a little
more explicit, "Arthur pitched as masterful a
game on Friday as you would ever want to
see."
There were only four balls hit into the
Stanford outfield, as Arthur had the Trojans
baffled. Anthony Davis collected USC's first
hit when he beat out an infield grounder that
Card shortstop Steve Davis stopped over
second base.
The only run USC scored was unearned
when Lamoure threw away a possible double
play ball at first base, allowing Tom Bhagwat,
who had singled, to score.
Cards 7, USC 0
"We stole, we ran, we did everything
well," said Young. "We put the pressure on
them from the start."
Two-run homers by Kevin Sullivan and
Hampton were the big clouts in Saturday's
whitewash.

According to catcher Dave Baker,
Sullivan's was a "titan shot," which cleared
the 400-foot sign in dead centerfield with
Mark Lucich aboard in the second inning.
Hampton's fourth home run in as many
games was in the three-run seventh.
Williamson, who upped his record to 5-3,
was aided by three double plays turned over
by the Cards, who had six for the series.
Young pointed out that the defensive
prowess of the infield was a big factor.
The only trouble the tall sophomore
righthander had was in the seventh when the
Trojans loaded the bases with one out. But a
ended the game.
Cards 6, USC 5
Freshman Gary Pitehford, who played at
third base in all three games, collected three
hits and two runs batted in to lead the Cards
in a thriller.
Pitehford was taking Kim Hannaford's
spot in the infield. Hannaford played
centerfield replacing Hampton who could
only play designated hitter because of a
strained achilles tendon.
Bernie Hittner, who worked his way into
the rotation because of injuries plaguing Dave
Frost, started the game but lasted only until
the fifth as the Trojans began to hammer him
in tying the score at 4-4. Freshman John
Yandle came in to snuff out the rally.
The Cards went ahead in the sixth inning
on three consecutive singles by Pitehford,
Lamoure and Bruce Robinson. Lucich drove
in Lamoure with a single for the eventual
winning run.
USC staged a last gasp rally that fell short
in the ninth, scoring one run on a single by
Rich Dauer, who was 0 for 10 until that
point in the series, driving in Dennis Stahl,
who had doubled.
In an instant replay of the 6-5 win the
Cards took from USC a month ago at Sunken
Diamond, Yandle struck out the final batter
of the game, Bhagwat, on a called third
strike.
