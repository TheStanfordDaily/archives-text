# Defense Is Cardinal Key
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
In more ways than one, Mike Cordova may have
signalled the strengths of 1974 Stanford football at
the annual Red-White game Saturday in Stanford
Stadium.
Cordova completed 11-17 passes for 175 yards
in the second half to lead the Reds to a 9-7 victory
over the Whites. But before those heroics, he
writhed painfully on the ground in the first half,
the victim of a jarring tackle by All-American
defensive end Roger Still well. "I've never been hit
like that before," Cordova told an assistant coach
as he slowly rose to his feet.
Cordova may or may not be the starting
quarterback when Stanford opens its season on
Sept. 14 at Penn State (see related column). But
Stillwell will definitely be in the lineup, along with
fellow All-American Pat Donovan, linebackers
Gordie Riegel and Forrie Martin and a solid
supporting cast. Opposing ballcarriers will have two
choices in 1974 — escape to the sidelines or endure
some substantial pain.
'The defense was really hitting," coach Jack
Christiansen said after the game. "But we expect
'em to." *
Low Rushing Totals
The defense was indeed dominant Saturday, as
the Red team managed only 82 yards rushing and
the Whites only 80. "At this time the defense
should be ahead of the offense," Christiansen said,
"especially with two starting offensive linemen
(Keith Rowen and Gary Anderson] on the
sidelines." Rowen has a broken thumb and
Anderson is recovering from knee surgery.
The game's first touchdown came after the
Whites recovered a Cordova fumble at the Red 39
late in the first half. Guy Benjamin immediately hit
Tony Hill on a post pattern for a 21-yard gain, and
the two sophomores collaborated on a carbon copy
— this one for an 18-yard touchdown — on the very
next play. Chip Underwood's conversion gave the
Whites a 7-0 lead with 1:47 remaining in the first
half.

The Whites maintained their advantage through
the third quarter and most of the fourth, until
explosive sophomore running back Ron Inge bolted
across the goal line from eight yards out behind a
solid block by fullback Dave Tenn.
Brandon Abbey's conversion attempt never had
a chance until Forrie Martin blocked it, but
Martin's unintentional tip-in try hit the crossbar,
leaving the Reds a point behind with five minutes
remaining.
The Reds regained possession after a short punt
and Cordova engineered a 52-yard drive that took
the Reds to the White 15. With 48 seconds
remaining, Glenn Cristofori booted a soccer-style
32-yard field goal to give the Reds a 9-7 victory.
Afterwards, the sun-drenched crowd estimated
by objective onlookers at 3000 and by athletic
department officials at 6000, walked casually out
of the stadium while Christiansen staged an equally
casual press conference on the sidelines.
Ahead Of Last Year
Christiansen reiterated the team's strengths,
praising the performance of the defensive line,
linebackers, offensive line, running backs and a
solid receiving corps headed by Bill Singler, Eric
Test and Tony Hill. The tight end position is up for
grabs, Chris said, with Brad Williams and Ted
Pappas battling for the starting spot.
In the suspect defensive backfield, Christiansen
admits that "we don't have any speed-burners, but
we do have adequate quickness." Despite the fact
that next fall's Pac-8 race will feature more passing
than ever, Christiansen doesn't appear worried,
possibly assuming that Donovan, Stillwell and Drew
Palin will prevent opposing quarterbacks from ever
getting the ball airborne.
"We set out this spring to find two or three
backup people at some crucial positions," Chris
said, "and I think we found them," singling out
offensive guard Tom Tipton, defensive tackles John
Harris and A 1 Tenßruggencate and linebackers John
Olenchalk, Dan Francis and Andy Kolesnikow.

FEROCIOUS FORRIE — After the Red-White game Saturday, many of the offensive players expressed
satisfaction they didn't have to play the Stanford defense again. This jarring tackle by Forrie Martin (49)
is one reason why.
In more ways than one, Mike Cordova may have
signalled the strengths of 1974 Stanford football at
the annual Red-White game Saturday in Stanford
Stadium.
Cordova completed 11-17 passes for 175 yards
in the second half to lead the Reds to a 9-7 victory
over the Whites. But before those heroics, he
writhed painfully on the ground in the first half,
the victim of a jarring tackle by All-American
defensive end Roger Still well. "I've never been hit
like that before," Cordova told an assistant coach
as he slowly rose to his feet.
Cordova may or may not be the starting
quarterback when Stanford opens its season on
Sept. 14 at Penn State (see related column). But
Stillwell will definitely be in the lineup, along with
fellow All-American Pat Donovan, linebackers
Gordie Riegel and Forrie Martin and a solid
supporting cast. Opposing ballcarriers will have two
choices in 1974 — escape to the sidelines or endure
some substantial pain.
'The defense was really hitting," coach Jack
Christiansen said after the game. "But we expect
'em to." *
Low Rushing Totals
The defense was indeed dominant Saturday, as
the Red team managed only 82 yards rushing and
the Whites only 80. "At this time the defense
should be ahead of the offense," Christiansen said,
"especially with two starting offensive linemen
(Keith Rowen and Gary Anderson] on the
sidelines." Rowen has a broken thumb and
Anderson is recovering from knee surgery.
The game's first touchdown came after the
Whites recovered a Cordova fumble at the Red 39
late in the first half. Guy Benjamin immediately hit
Tony Hill on a post pattern for a 21-yard gain, and
the two sophomores collaborated on a carbon copy
— this one for an 18-yard touchdown — on the very
next play. Chip Underwood's conversion gave the
Whites a 7-0 lead with 1:47 remaining in the first
half.

The Whites maintained their advantage through
the third quarter and most of the fourth, until
explosive sophomore running back Ron Inge bolted
across the goal line from eight yards out behind a
solid block by fullback Dave Tenn.
Brandon Abbey's conversion attempt never had
a chance until Forrie Martin blocked it, but
Martin's unintentional tip-in try hit the crossbar,
leaving the Reds a point behind with five minutes
remaining.
The Reds regained possession after a short punt
and Cordova engineered a 52-yard drive that took
the Reds to the White 15. With 48 seconds
remaining, Glenn Cristofori booted a soccer-style
32-yard field goal to give the Reds a 9-7 victory.
Afterwards, the sun-drenched crowd estimated
by objective onlookers at 3000 and by athletic
department officials at 6000, walked casually out
of the stadium while Christiansen staged an equally
casual press conference on the sidelines.
Ahead Of Last Year
Christiansen reiterated the team's strengths,
praising the performance of the defensive line,
linebackers, offensive line, running backs and a
solid receiving corps headed by Bill Singler, Eric
Test and Tony Hill. The tight end position is up for
