## The 						Quarterback Question 
### Vlae Kershner 
Who's going to be the quarterback next season?
Every time Saturday's Red-White game was
mentioned at conversations after the contest, that
question came up. And just about every time, I'd
be willing to bet, the conversation went something
like this.
"Cordova really looked good in the second half.
Did vou see the way he was throwing to Eric
Test?"
"Waldvogel didn't look bad either. He really
seems to be able to move the ball."
"And don't forget Benjamin. He threw two
really perfect passes to Tony Hill."
"Even Sotta looked pretty good."
"Yeah, Christiansen's going to have a helluva
time picking a quarterback next year."
A pause in the conversation. Then, quietly,
almost as if you're afraid Jerry Waldvogel, Guy
Benjamin or Bob Sotta will hear, comes the key
line.
"Yeah. But I think in the end, they'll go with
Mike Cordova."
Equal QB's
Coach Jack Christiansen, normally blunt about
who his starters will be, spent much of his
postgame interview trying to prove that the four
QB's were models of social and geometric equality.
Chris plans to test all the quarterbacks during
fall drills and the first games of the season, before
making a choice, at the latest, before the league
opener with UCLA Oct. 12.
Maybe the factor of choice is the reason
Christiansen is so wary about making a decision.
It's not really too important whether Brad Williams
or Ted Pappas starts at tight end or whether Sig
Ostrom or Ron Inge gets the nod at halfback.
.Vhether starters or not, all four players will see
considerable'playing time.
But the losers for the QB job? Since, as any
Dallas Cowboy fan knows, a team does nothing but
screw up its timing by alternating quarterbacks, a

coach has to make a decision and stick with it. The
losers sit on the bench and help call plays.
OK, let's look at the candidates.
Sotta, who'll be a senior, is a transfer from
Harvard. He's looked good mechanically, but has
but a slim chance against the stiff competition he
faces.
Benjamin, a sophomore, may be the best passer
of the four. He lacks experience, however, missing
last season when he underwent knee surgery after
being injured walking to class.
Waldvogel is an intelligent junior whose
play-calling ability won last year's Red-White game
(he threw a TD pass on third and inches) and was
similarly impressive this year.
A native of San Diego, Waldvogel redshirted last
season. He runs and passes well enough to start at
QB for most colleges, but has a history of being
intercepted.
Publicity Buildup
Despite their credentials, Stanford's other
quarterbacks are definitely underdogs, to
sophomore Cordova, who's been receiving the
publicity buildup associated with a first-string QB.
Cordova has shown himself to be a strong runner
and effective passer. In addition, Saturday he and
Eric Test combined beautifully to complete passes
on post patterns Test ran as curls. This summer,
Cordova will work with star receiver Bill Singler in
an effort to produce similarly effective
cooperation.
So what's going to happen? Christiansen says
"it's up in the air. The competition will continue
into the first 2-3 weeks of the fall," and maybe
beyond that, as whoever is designated as starter will
have to prove himself in tough non-league games.
Maybe it is completely up in the air. But it may
not be a coincidence that three photos hang on the
wall in back of Chris' desk. One is of Plunkett,
another of Mike Boryla.
The third is of Mike Cordova.
