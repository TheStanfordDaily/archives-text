# USE Members Authorize Strike, Set May 13 Negotiation Deadline

United Stanford Employees (USE)
union members voted last week to
strike May 13 if they cannot reach
agreement with the University on their
contract demands.
USE announced Friday afternoon
that members had voted 613 to 218
(74 to 26 percent) to allow the union
contract committee to call a strike.
Ninety-seven percent of the eligible
USE members voted.
The vote easily fulfilled the
provision in union by-laws stipulating
two-thirds of the voting members must
approve any strike.

The 50 members of the union who
assembled Friday at Tresidder for the
vote count reacted with cheers and
toasts when the vote was announced.
One worker yelled, "they've been
screwing us for 25 years, now it's our
turn."
Berk: 'Solidarity'
USE president Jim Berk said he was
happy at the results not because he
wanted to go on strike, but because
the vote illustrated the solidarity of
the union.
"We will now begin very active
preparations for a strike," Berk said.
Berk said he saw "no evidence in
the past relations with the University"
to indicate any substantial
breakthrough in negotiations would
occur this week.
"We will continue to negotiate, but
as far as we're concerned, May 13 is
the final deadline," he said.
USE and the University have been
engaged in contract negotiations since
December. USE is Local 680 of the
Service Employees International
Union, AFL-CIO, and represents 1400
technical, service and maintenance
employees. Only 860 of these were
dues-paying USE members eligible to
vote.
Augsburger: 'No Surprise'
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger told the
Daily yesterday that the strike vote
"doesn't come as any surprise."
University negotiator Douglas
Barton agreed, saying "it would be a
rare thing indeed for the membership
of the union to refuse to give the

bargaining team permission to call a
strike."
Augsburger added that the vote
"doesn't indicate that there is
overwhelming support for the union in
the bargaining unit since all members
of the unit are not in the union."
USE and University bargaining
teams negotiated most of Friday in the
presence of Federal mediators
Clarence Washington and Ruth
Carpenter.
Washington told the Daily Friday

that there was "no real indication of
progress at this point" and that there
were "no substantial areas of
agreement" between the University
and the union.
"We haven't explored all of the
issues on the table, but every issue that
has been explored is" a sticking point,
he said.
"I'm always optimistic, but I'm not
encouraged by any special move on
the part of one party or the other,"
