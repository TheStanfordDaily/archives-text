# Cal's Horses Overpower Spikers

### MARK WHITE 
BERKELEY â€” A stronger,
bigger herd of California Bears
thundered past the Stanford track
Cardinals 100-44 Saturday in the
80th annual Big Meet.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan,
obviously relieved to have
weathered one of the most
grueling dual-meet seasons of his
18 years on the Farm, focused on
preparation for the upcoming
Pac-8 and national meets

following the pasting.
"Nobody is going to die
because we came in second
today," said Jordan. "You must
give Cal credit; they did a good
job and we had some good
head-to-head competition. My
greatest desire next week (at the
West Coast Relays] is to have
some of our men meet the
qualifying standards for the Pac-8
meet."
Two mile victor Brad Duffey
echoed the sentiments of many of
the Californians. "This meet
meant a lot to us; we have a good,
clean rivalry with Stanford and we
like to win in front of our fans.
With guys like [McKinley] Mosley
and | Rick] Brown running in
races before you, you better run
well, or you're a horse's ass," said
Duffey.
Duffey looked like anything
but an equine posterior on the
final lap of the day's best race, the
two mile. Fellow Bear Wolfgang
Schmulewicz opened the race
with an insane 3:13.5 first three
laps, leading until Card Tony
Sandoval dramatically took the
lead on the fifth lap.
Sandy maintained a 20-yard
lead on Duffey until the
backstretch of the seventh lap
when Duffey and Card Mark
McConnell moved up on his
shoulder. Duffey then kicked
home the last 330 for a 50-yard
victory over the surging second
place McConnell and expiring
third-place Sandoval.
"Wolfgang ran a gutty race,"
said Duffy. "He made Sandoval
assert himself too early, and he
made it possible for me to outkick
McConnell."
Another cliffhanger came in
the mile. Card freshman Dave
Allen and Stanford's Steve
Crowley led at the 880 mark, but
a slow third lap gave Bear Chuck
Harris a one-yard lead at the bell.
Crowley and Harris duelled until
the backstretch when Crowley
tantalizingly eked out a one-yard
victory over Cal's Simon Langer.
Both were tined in 4:13.8.
Matt Hogsett provided another
Stanford late-surging victory in
the 4-10 hurdles. Bear Chris
Edson, who would be undefeated
if the race were 220 yards instead
of 440. took a huge lead into the

final turn, when Hogsett made his
move. Dave Bagshaw took second
by outsprinting the staggering
Edson in the last 15 yards.
In the field, Jim Royer came
up with a lifetime best 169-0
against former high-school nemisis
Scott Overton to win the discus.
Steady Steve Hopkins provided
the Card's final victory, hitting
223-11 in the'javelin. "I really get
a charge out of competing against
Cal," said Hopkins.
Olympian Rick Brown closed
out his Cal career with an easy
1:50.2 880 victory. Brown never
lost an 880 race to an opponent in
his four years at Cal.
Brown also anchored the
victorious Bear mile relay team.
Hogsett opened the relay in a fine
48.2 and Bruce Henry, who closed
out his Stanford career with a
third place 440 lifetime best of
48.7, maintained Stanford's lead
with an identical second leg.
