Milk Lobby Considered Mills ?
WASHINGTON — A top official of the nation's
largest dairy cooperative planned to raise $2 million
to elect Rep. Wilbur D. Mills, D-Ark., to the White
House in 1972, according to statements filed in
court.
They say David L. Parr, once the second-ranking
official of Associated Milk Producers Inc., believed
Mills could capture the Democratic presidential
nomination and beat President Nixon, who was also
receiving substantial support from the milk
producers.
According to the statements, attributed to
several of Parr's former associates at the
cooperative, Parr assigned five to seven cooperative
employees to assist the Mills presidential effort, an
apparent violation of federal laws prohibiting
indirect donations of corporation money for
political purposes.
"Dave Parr wanted to build a kitty for Wilbur
Mills of $2 million,"the cooperative's former
lobbyist Bob A. Lilly was quoted as saying.
The milk producers, who currently hold the
richest political trust in the country, frequently
have given to both the Republican and Democratic
candidates in election races.
St. Clair Claims Nixon Innocent
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's chief lawyer
indicated yesterday he believes the House
impeachment inquiry hinges on whether the
President approved hush money payments to
Watergate defendants.
And the presidential tape transcripts released last
week, said attorney James St. Clair, prove that
Nixon "neither authorized ... nor knew" about
such a payment.
Both St. Clair and White House Chief of Staff
Alexander M. Haig Jr., appearing separately on
televised interview programs, predicted that Nixon
would be vindicated in the House.
Meanwhile in Houston, former Watergate special
prosecutor Archibald Cox says the edited
Watergate-related transcripts released last week by

Nixon suggest an attempt by Nixon to obstruct
justice.
Speaking to newsmen here Saturday, he also
urged his successor, Leon Jaworski, and the House
Judiciary Committee's formal impeachment inquiry
to "go forward until the last stone has been
unturned."
"I think the committee is entitled to judge for
itself what is relevant," Cox said. "The material that
has been produced is said to be all that is relevant to
Watergate. But neither the prosecutor's investigation
nor the congressional investigation is limited
entirely to Watergate."
Cox, fired by Nixon last October, said he was
most distressed by the transcript of Nixon's
conversations on March 21, 1973 with former White
House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman and former
White House counsel John Dean.
"I think it could be inferred that there was an
intent to obstruct justice on that date," Cox said of
the conversation. "He [NixonJ was present on
March 21 and all those present were involved in the
coverup."
"All I saw was a sort of sleazy discussion on how
'we' will manipulate, hold and hide," he said. "I
didn't see anything about justice, the law or
strengthening the law. I saw nothing of integrity."
Kissinger Confers With Hussein
AMMAN, Jordan — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger flew here yesterday and his Soviet
counterpart Andrei Gromyko arrived in Syria in an
apparently coordinated effort to end the fighting in
the Golan Heights.
Artillery duels on the Israeli-Syrian cease-fire line
continued Sunday but Israeli Information Minister
Shimon Peres expressed guarded optimism the
fighting might subside "in another day."
Kissinger arrived in Jordan Sunday afternoon
following extended talks with Israeli leaders. He
conferred for three hours with Jordan's King
Hussein and his top aides about their hopes for an
Israeli pullback on the west bank of the Jordan
River, and for increased U.S. economic and military
aid.

Art Treasures Recovered
DUBLIN, Ireland — A 33-year-old former
debutante turned self-styled freedom fighter was in
custody yesterday after police found the 19
paintings stolen a week ago in the world's largest art
theft.
Police said Bridget Rose Dugdale, the daughter of
an English millionaire insurance executive, was
arrested Saturday in a remote country cottage in
southwest Ireland where police found the paintings
valued at over $20 million.
The paintings were stolen April 26 from the
sprawling rural mansion of gold and diamond
magnate Sir Alfred Beit.
The paintings — which include a Vermeer, a
Goya, a Frans Hals and three Rubens — were taken
to the Dublin police technical bureau.
Zebra Informant To Testify?
SAN FRANCISCO — Authorities bound by a gag
order refused to say yesterday if Mayor Joseph
Alioto's informant would testify to the San
Francisco County Grand Jury investigating the
Zebra street shootings.
Dist. Atty. John Fay Ferdon said he could not
comment on a possible appearance by the
mysterious informer because of the broad gag rule
issued Friday by Municipal Court Judge Agnes
O'Brien Smith.
The grand jury will begin hearing evidence
tonight.
An informant's story to Alioto touched off seven
arrests in the case last week and led the mayor to
announce that he believes the Zebra shootings were
committed by a fanatical cult of black separatists
called Death Angels. Four of the persons arrested
later were released for lack of sufficient evidence.
Today's Weather
Low clouds along the coast extending inland
night and mornings. Fair otherwise through
Tuesday. Little temperature change. Lows tonight
in mid 40s to mid 50s. Highs today and tomorrow
in mid 60s to low 70s except 55 to 60 near the
coast. West to northwest wind 10 to 20 mph.

to elect Rep. Wilbur D. Mills, D-Ark., to the White
House in 1972, according to statements filed in
court.
They say David L. Parr, once the second-ranking
official of Associated Milk Producers Inc., believed
Mills could capture the Democratic presidential
nomination and beat President Nixon, who was also
receiving substantial support from the milk
producers.
According to the statements, attributed to
several of Parr's former associates at the
cooperative, Parr assigned five to seven cooperative
employees to assist the Mills presidential effort, an
apparent violation of federal laws prohibiting
indirect donations of corporation money for
political purposes.
"Dave Parr wanted to build a kitty for Wilbur
Mills of $2 million,"the cooperative's former
lobbyist Bob A. Lilly was quoted as saying.
The milk producers, who currently hold the
richest political trust in the country, frequently
have given to both the Republican and Democratic
candidates in election races.
St. Clair Claims Nixon Innocent
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's chief lawyer
indicated yesterday he believes the House
impeachment inquiry hinges on whether the
President approved hush money payments to
Watergate defendants.
And the presidential tape transcripts released last
week, said attorney James St. Clair, prove that
Nixon "neither authorized ... nor knew" about
such a payment.
Both St. Clair and White House Chief of Staff
Alexander M. Haig Jr., appearing separately on
televised interview programs, predicted that Nixon
would be vindicated in the House.
Meanwhile in Houston, former Watergate special
prosecutor Archibald Cox says the edited
Watergate-related transcripts released last week by

Nixon suggest an attempt by Nixon to obstruct
justice.
Speaking to newsmen here Saturday, he also
urged his successor, Leon Jaworski, and the House
Judiciary Committee's formal impeachment inquiry
to "go forward until the last stone has been
unturned."
"I think the committee is entitled to judge for
itself what is relevant," Cox said. "The material that
has been produced is said to be all that is relevant to
Watergate. But neither the prosecutor's investigation
nor the congressional investigation is limited
entirely to Watergate."
Cox, fired by Nixon last October, said he was
most distressed by the transcript of Nixon's
conversations on March 21, 1973 with former White
House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman and former
White House counsel John Dean.
"I think it could be inferred that there was an
intent to obstruct justice on that date," Cox said of
the conversation. "He [NixonJ was present on
March 21 and all those present were involved in the
coverup."
"All I saw was a sort of sleazy discussion on how
'we' will manipulate, hold and hide," he said. "I
didn't see anything about justice, the law or
strengthening the law. I saw nothing of integrity."
Kissinger Confers With Hussein
AMMAN, Jordan — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger flew here yesterday and his Soviet
counterpart Andrei Gromyko arrived in Syria in an
apparently coordinated effort to end the fighting in
the Golan Heights.
Artillery duels on the Israeli-Syrian cease-fire line
continued Sunday but Israeli Information Minister
Shimon Peres expressed guarded optimism the
fighting might subside "in another day."
Kissinger arrived in Jordan Sunday afternoon
following extended talks with Israeli leaders. He
conferred for three hours with Jordan's King
Hussein and his top aides about their hopes for an
Israeli pullback on the west bank of the Jordan
River, and for increased U.S. economic and military
aid.

Art Treasures Recovered
DUBLIN, Ireland — A 33-year-old former
debutante turned self-styled freedom fighter was in
custody yesterday after police found the 19
paintings stolen a week ago in the world's largest art
theft.
Police said Bridget Rose Dugdale, the daughter of
an English millionaire insurance executive, was
arrested Saturday in a remote country cottage in
southwest Ireland where police found the paintings
valued at over $20 million.
The paintings were stolen April 26 from the
sprawling rural mansion of gold and diamond
magnate Sir Alfred Beit.
The paintings — which include a Vermeer, a
Goya, a Frans Hals and three Rubens — were taken
to the Dublin police technical bureau.
Zebra Informant To Testify?
SAN FRANCISCO — Authorities bound by a gag
order refused to say yesterday if Mayor Joseph
Alioto's informant would testify to the San
Francisco County Grand Jury investigating the
Zebra street shootings.
Dist. Atty. John Fay Ferdon said he could not
comment on a possible appearance by the
mysterious informer because of the broad gag rule
issued Friday by Municipal Court Judge Agnes
O'Brien Smith.
The grand jury will begin hearing evidence
tonight.
An informant's story to Alioto touched off seven
arrests in the case last week and led the mayor to
announce that he believes the Zebra shootings were
committed by a fanatical cult of black separatists
called Death Angels. Four of the persons arrested
later were released for lack of sufficient evidence.
Today's Weather
Low clouds along the coast extending inland
night and mornings. Fair otherwise through
Tuesday. Little temperature change. Lows tonight
in mid 40s to mid 50s. Highs today and tomorrow
in mid 60s to low 70s except 55 to 60 near the
coast. West to northwest wind 10 to 20 mph.

House in 1972, according to statements filed in
court.
They say David L. Parr, once the second-ranking
official of Associated Milk Producers Inc., believed
Mills could capture the Democratic presidential
nomination and beat President Nixon, who was also
receiving substantial support from the milk
producers.
According to the statements, attributed to
several of Parr's former associates at the
cooperative, Parr assigned five to seven cooperative
employees to assist the Mills presidential effort, an
apparent violation of federal laws prohibiting
indirect donations of corporation money for
political purposes.
"Dave Parr wanted to build a kitty for Wilbur
Mills of $2 million,"the cooperative's former
lobbyist Bob A. Lilly was quoted as saying.
The milk producers, who currently hold the
richest political trust in the country, frequently
have given to both the Republican and Democratic
candidates in election races.
St. Clair Claims Nixon Innocent
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's chief lawyer
indicated yesterday he believes the House
impeachment inquiry hinges on whether the
President approved hush money payments to
Watergate defendants.
And the presidential tape transcripts released last
week, said attorney James St. Clair, prove that
Nixon "neither authorized ... nor knew" about
such a payment.
Both St. Clair and White House Chief of Staff
Alexander M. Haig Jr., appearing separately on
televised interview programs, predicted that Nixon
would be vindicated in the House.
Meanwhile in Houston, former Watergate special
prosecutor Archibald Cox says the edited
Watergate-related transcripts released last week by

Nixon suggest an attempt by Nixon to obstruct
justice.
Speaking to newsmen here Saturday, he also
urged his successor, Leon Jaworski, and the House
Judiciary Committee's formal impeachment inquiry
to "go forward until the last stone has been
unturned."
"I think the committee is entitled to judge for
itself what is relevant," Cox said. "The material that
has been produced is said to be all that is relevant to
Watergate. But neither the prosecutor's investigation
nor the congressional investigation is limited
entirely to Watergate."
Cox, fired by Nixon last October, said he was
most distressed by the transcript of Nixon's
conversations on March 21, 1973 with former White
House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman and former
White House counsel John Dean.
"I think it could be inferred that there was an
intent to obstruct justice on that date," Cox said of
the conversation. "He [NixonJ was present on
March 21 and all those present were involved in the
coverup."
"All I saw was a sort of sleazy discussion on how
'we' will manipulate, hold and hide," he said. "I
didn't see anything about justice, the law or
strengthening the law. I saw nothing of integrity."
Kissinger Confers With Hussein
AMMAN, Jordan — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger flew here yesterday and his Soviet
counterpart Andrei Gromyko arrived in Syria in an
apparently coordinated effort to end the fighting in
the Golan Heights.
Artillery duels on the Israeli-Syrian cease-fire line
continued Sunday but Israeli Information Minister
Shimon Peres expressed guarded optimism the
fighting might subside "in another day."
Kissinger arrived in Jordan Sunday afternoon
following extended talks with Israeli leaders. He
conferred for three hours with Jordan's King
Hussein and his top aides about their hopes for an
Israeli pullback on the west bank of the Jordan
River, and for increased U.S. economic and military
aid.

Art Treasures Recovered
DUBLIN, Ireland — A 33-year-old former
debutante turned self-styled freedom fighter was in
custody yesterday after police found the 19
paintings stolen a week ago in the world's largest art
theft.
Police said Bridget Rose Dugdale, the daughter of
an English millionaire insurance executive, was
arrested Saturday in a remote country cottage in
southwest Ireland where police found the paintings
valued at over $20 million.
The paintings were stolen April 26 from the
sprawling rural mansion of gold and diamond
magnate Sir Alfred Beit.
The paintings — which include a Vermeer, a
Goya, a Frans Hals and three Rubens — were taken
to the Dublin police technical bureau.
Zebra Informant To Testify?
SAN FRANCISCO — Authorities bound by a gag
order refused to say yesterday if Mayor Joseph
Alioto's informant would testify to the San
Francisco County Grand Jury investigating the
Zebra street shootings.
Dist. Atty. John Fay Ferdon said he could not
comment on a possible appearance by the
mysterious informer because of the broad gag rule
issued Friday by Municipal Court Judge Agnes
O'Brien Smith.
The grand jury will begin hearing evidence
tonight.
An informant's story to Alioto touched off seven
arrests in the case last week and led the mayor to
announce that he believes the Zebra shootings were
committed by a fanatical cult of black separatists
called Death Angels. Four of the persons arrested
later were released for lack of sufficient evidence.
Today's Weather
Low clouds along the coast extending inland
night and mornings. Fair otherwise through
Tuesday. Little temperature change. Lows tonight
in mid 40s to mid 50s. Highs today and tomorrow
in mid 60s to low 70s except 55 to 60 near the
coast. West to northwest wind 10 to 20 mph.
