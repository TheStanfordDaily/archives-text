# Kent State-Jackson State Lecture
## Coffin Calls For Draft Amnesty 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Yale Chaplain William Sloan Coffin
Jr. Friday night urged students to sign
amnesty petitions for draft dodgers in
memory of the four Kent State
students killed by National Guardsmen
in 1970.
Delivering the second annual Kent
State-Jackson State memorial address
to more than 300 students in

Memorial Church, Coffin said that the
four students "should be considered
[Vietnam] war dead, because that's
what they are."
"The worst argument that one can
make is to say that to honor those
who are incarcerated and ex-carcerated
by allowing them to return is to
somehow dishonor those who died in
Vietnam."
Saying that he did not wish to talk
about a subject on which most
students would agree with him, Coffin
spoke for the next half hour on "the
spiral of violence."
Not All Justified
More young affluent Americans
have begun to understand the
problems of the poor, but some have
responded with violent acts, Coffin
declared.
He said, "The integrity of emotions
has been magnificient, but as bad
poetry shows us, honest emotions do
not justify everything done to express
them."
Asked afterwards what he thought
of the actions of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA), Coffin said,
"My fear is the SLA is more interested
in punishing the rich than helping the
poor.
"The question of Foster really
bothers me. [Oakland School
Superintendent Marcus Foster was
allegedly killed last year by SLA
members.]
"They say a little bit of learning is a
dangerous thing. The worst kind of
learning is Marxism. Their action could

represent the politics of guilt of
middle class America. Afterall, it [the
SLA] is a white middle class
operation, although it has its token
black."
Spiral Of Violence
Coffin who has written for The
Nation, Saturday Review, Christian
Century and The Intercollegian,
stated, "oppression by the powerful
against the poor is violence number
one in this country."
This "institutional violence" leads
to the rebellion of the oppressed, a
second type of violence, according to
Coffin. Rebellion is in turn followed
by, a third type of violence, repression
by the powerful.
"National attention always seems
to focus on rebellion and calls for
repression," Coffin noted.
However, he said that the people
should deal with the violence of
oppression which causes the problem
in the first place.
Human degradation is just as bad as
physical deprivation," he said.
"Violence can be done to the soul as
well as the body, a fact Alioto forgot
in his effort to save white bodies from
black killers."
Just as many poor people are
entrapped in their poverty, Coffin
maintained that "the rich are
entrapped by their riches."
Finally, Coffin urged people not to
try to justify violence. "Violence is
inevitable, but it is also evil."

who are incarcerated and ex-carcerated
by allowing them to return is to
somehow dishonor those who died in
Vietnam."
Saying that he did not wish to talk
about a subject on which most
students would agree with him, Coffin
spoke for the next half hour on "the
spiral of violence."
Not All Justified
More young affluent Americans
have begun to understand the
problems of the poor, but some have
responded with violent acts, Coffin
declared.
He said, "The integrity of emotions
has been magnificient, but as bad
poetry shows us, honest emotions do
not justify everything done to express
them."
Asked afterwards what he thought
of the actions of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA), Coffin said,
"My fear is the SLA is more interested
in punishing the rich than helping the
poor.
"The question of Foster really
bothers me. [Oakland School
Superintendent Marcus Foster was
allegedly killed last year by SLA
members.]
"They say a little bit of learning is a
dangerous thing. The worst kind of
learning is Marxism. Their action could

represent the politics of guilt of
middle class America. Afterall, it [the
SLA] is a white middle class
operation, although it has its token
black."
Spiral Of Violence
Coffin who has written for The
Nation, Saturday Review, Christian
Century and The Intercollegian,
stated, "oppression by the powerful
against the poor is violence number
one in this country."
This "institutional violence" leads
to the rebellion of the oppressed, a
second type of violence, according to
Coffin. Rebellion is in turn followed
by, a third type of violence, repression
by the powerful.
"National attention always seems
to focus on rebellion and calls for
repression," Coffin noted.
However, he said that the people
should deal with the violence of
oppression which causes the problem
in the first place.
Human degradation is just as bad as
physical deprivation," he said.
"Violence can be done to the soul as
well as the body, a fact Alioto forgot
in his effort to save white bodies from
black killers."
Just as many poor people are
entrapped in their poverty, Coffin
maintained that "the rich are
entrapped by their riches."
Finally, Coffin urged people not to
try to justify violence. "Violence is
inevitable, but it is also evil."
Yale Chaplain William Sloan Coffin
Jr. Friday night urged students to sign
amnesty petitions for draft dodgers in
memory of the four Kent State
students killed by National Guardsmen
in 1970.
Delivering the second annual Kent
State-Jackson State memorial address
to more than 300 students in

Memorial Church, Coffin said that the
four students "should be considered
[Vietnam] war dead, because that's
what they are."
"The worst argument that one can
make is to say that to honor those
who are incarcerated and ex-carcerated
by allowing them to return is to
somehow dishonor those who died in
Vietnam."
