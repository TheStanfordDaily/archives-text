# State GOP Factions Endorse Rival Slates
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
"The Republican Party is not going
to be able to wash away the cloud
hanging over our heads, the Watergate
issue," Sen Charles Percy, R-111., told a
convention of the California
Republican League (CRL) Saturday in
Burlingame.
"Some analysts have predicted the
loss of 50 or even 100 Republican seats
in the House in November," he added.
"It's not going to be that bad, but it
won't be good either."
Percy and former Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare Robert
Finch were featured speakers at the
convention, and most Republican
candidates for office in the state
appeared to seek the league's support.
The organization endorsed state
Controller Houston Flournoy, one of
the league's founders, in his campaign
for governor and also approved John
G. Veneman for lieutenant governor
and Earl Brian for U.S. Senator.
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,
R-Menlo Park, received the CRL 12th
Congressional District chapter
endorsement in his bid for re-election.
Conservative Slate
In nearby San Mateo yesterday, the
more conservative United Republicans
of California supported a completely
different slate, unanimously endorsing
Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke for governor and
including candidates John Harmer for
lieutenant governor and H.L.
Richardson for U.S. Senate.
Percy expressed his optimism that
the Republican party could avoid being
severely damaged by Watergate.

"Guilt by association is an
un-American attitude," he said. "Wo
have to separate in the voters' minds
the completely innocent candidates
and the small group of men at CREEP
[Committee to Re-Elect the
President]."
The senator expressed concern that
defendants in Watergate-related trials
might be hurting the party by undue
legal maneuvering. "The rights of a
defendant are very clear in the law," he
noted, "but that's hardly the way to
get Watergate behind us."
Attacks Democrats
Like most of the other speakers at
the convention, Percy took time to
attack the Democratic party. He cited
"disastrous blows taken at the
economy" by the Democrats and
called Democrats' proposals for income
tax cuts "sheer hypocrisy in the midst
of two-figure inflation."
Finch told the Daily that he
thought Watergate would become
much less of an issue than recent
analysts have predicted. "People have
just been venting their spleen in the
special congressional elections," he
stated. "From now to November is an
awfully long time by political
standards."
Commenting on the recent actions
of President Richard Nixon, Finch,
who left Washington in 1972 after a
three-year stint as a cabinet member
and later as a presidential counsel, said.
"From a tactical standpoint, I'm afraid
he [Nixon] appears to give up only
what he is required to give up, and this

might hurt from a public-image
standpoint."
Finch cited difficulty in fund-raising
as a major reason he chose not to run
for office this year. "Besides, I think a
public servant is less effective if he's
out there running every time the bell
sounds," he said. "I wanted a chance
to recharge my batteries."
Against Prop. 9
Now a practicing attorney in Los
Angeles, Finch is active in campaigning
against Prop. 9, the campaign-reform
measure on the November ballot. He
said the proposition would call for a
legal invasion of the candidate's
privacy and make "unfair demands on
the media."
Both Flournoy and Reinecke made
brief addresses before the CRL
convention. Floumoy, greeted very
enthusiastically by the delegates,
emphasized that he gained first place in
the most recent pre-primary polls.
Reinecke gave special attention to
his recent indictment for perjury,
saying "we're doing everything we can
to expedite this matter." He said that
wire service reports last week that he
was seeking a postponement of his trial
until after the primaries were false. .

Finch cited difficulty in fund-raising
as a major reason he chose not to run
for office this year. "Besides, I think a
public servant is less effective if he's
out there running every time the bell
sounds," he said. "I wanted a chance
to recharge my batteries."
Against Prop. 9
Now a practicing attorney in Los
Angeles, Finch is active in campaigning
against Prop. 9, the campaign-reform
measure on the November ballot. He
said the proposition would call for a
legal invasion of the candidate's
privacy and make "unfair demands on
the media."
Both Flournoy and Reinecke made
brief addresses before the CRL
convention. Floumoy, greeted very
enthusiastically by the delegates,
emphasized that he gained first place in
the most recent pre-primary polls.
Reinecke gave special attention to
his recent indictment for perjury,
saying "we're doing everything we can
to expedite this matter." He said that
wire service reports last week that he
was seeking a postponement of his trial
until after the primaries were false. .
"The Republican Party is not going
to be able to wash away the cloud
hanging over our heads, the Watergate
issue," Sen Charles Percy, R-111., told a
convention of the California
Republican League (CRL) Saturday in
Burlingame.
"Some analysts have predicted the
loss of 50 or even 100 Republican seats
in the House in November," he added.
"It's not going to be that bad, but it
won't be good either."
Percy and former Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare Robert
Finch were featured speakers at the
convention, and most Republican
candidates for office in the state
appeared to seek the league's support.
The organization endorsed state
Controller Houston Flournoy, one of
the league's founders, in his campaign
for governor and also approved John
G. Veneman for lieutenant governor
and Earl Brian for U.S. Senator.
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,
R-Menlo Park, received the CRL 12th
Congressional District chapter
endorsement in his bid for re-election.
Conservative Slate
In nearby San Mateo yesterday, the
more conservative United Republicans
of California supported a completely
different slate, unanimously endorsing
Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke for governor and
including candidates John Harmer for
lieutenant governor and H.L.
Richardson for U.S. Senate.
Percy expressed his optimism that
the Republican party could avoid being
severely damaged by Watergate.

"Guilt by association is an
un-American attitude," he said. "Wo
have to separate in the voters' minds
the completely innocent candidates
and the small group of men at CREEP
[Committee to Re-Elect the
President]."
The senator expressed concern that
defendants in Watergate-related trials
might be hurting the party by undue
legal maneuvering. "The rights of a
defendant are very clear in the law," he
noted, "but that's hardly the way to
get Watergate behind us."
Attacks Democrats
Like most of the other speakers at
the convention, Percy took time to
attack the Democratic party. He cited
"disastrous blows taken at the
economy" by the Democrats and
called Democrats' proposals for income
tax cuts "sheer hypocrisy in the midst
of two-figure inflation."
Finch told the Daily that he
thought Watergate would become
much less of an issue than recent
analysts have predicted. "People have
just been venting their spleen in the
special congressional elections," he
stated. "From now to November is an
awfully long time by political
standards."
