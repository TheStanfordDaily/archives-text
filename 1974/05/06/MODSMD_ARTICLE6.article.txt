# Calculating Computers Blend Music With Science
## 
### K.C. FLYNN 
The room slowly fills with sounds—some
familiar, some strange. Bat-like noises whiz
across the black space from somewhere
beyond the walls. Wooden drums come out of
nowhere, changing pitch as they move from
side to side, from front to back. Bells tingle
everywhere. A deep gong surrounds the
listeners.
You are in a small, dark room at Stanford's
artificial intelligence laboratory as a Sony
four-channel tape recorder begins rolling.
The sounds originate in the complex
circuitry of the artificial intelligence lab's
PDP-10 computer. Painstakingly composed
."mm millions of calculations, these sounds are
the extraordinary music of the Stanford
computer music program, part of the
Department of Music here.
Interdisciplinary Project
The computer music program, a highly
interdisciplinary project, blends the art and
science of music with the technology of the
computer and has brought together
composers, physicists, computer experts,
audio engineers and even psychologists.
After years of work, the computer music
program has begun to show very promising
results. Stanford recently formed a "Center

for Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics," and is applying to the National
Science Foundation and to the National
Endowment for the Arts for more than
$600,000 in grants to continue the project.
But until—and unless—the grants are
awarded, the program is stalled due to
financial pressure.
John Chowning, a slender, intense
composer who led much of the work in
computer music, recently left Stanford to
become a resident composer for the city of
Berlin. His appointment as assistant professor
of music ended in April.
'State Of Flux'
'The program is in a state of flux," says
Albert Cohen, Music Department chairman
since last September. Cohen would like very
much to expand the program, which up to
now has produced remarkable results "on a
shoestring," he says.
Stanford's work has brought composers
from Europe as well as from the Bay Area to
the lab's hilly location behind the campus. In
the blinking light of the green cathode-ray
tubes, musicians see staffs and clefs moving
around. Over the speakers they hear sounds
never created before.
The possibilities of computer-produced

music are vast, and the combinations of
possibilities infinite. A major problem has
been to limit those possibilities. The basic
reproducer of computer sound is the
loudspeaker, which can theoretically
reproduce any sound it is fed. The
loudspeaker uses electrons in varying amounts,
or voltages, to produce sound.
The computer works in numbers, in a
binary code of ones and zeroes. Converting
the numbers to varying voltages, the computer
produces changing vibrations in a loudspeaker.
We hear the product as sound.
Complex Sound
Unfortunately, the simplicity ends there.
Sound is so complex that figuring out how to
program a computer to produce any sound
takes vast amounts of computer time. To
compose his latest work, Chowning estimated
he used 40 hours of high-speed computer
calculation to get 10 minutes of music. Some
500 individual sounds are involved in moving
one "bat" sound across the room.
Computers can be considered only the
latest in a series of electronic instruments that
started when a Parisian named J.B. Delaborde
hooked up an electric harpsichord.
But it wasn't until after World War 11, when
magnetic tape was introduced, that composers

began to deal directly with the basic aspects of
sound. Tape could be played at varying
speeds, or backwards. Sounds could be mixed,
or superimposed on other sounds.
Synthesizers, introduced in the late 19505,
produced new sounds entirely by electronic
means. They rapidly became an important
part of music, both serious and popular.
Synthesizers now create music for
television commercials as well as for the New
York Philharmonic. The most popular
synthesizer is the "Moog," (which rhymes
with vogue) used often at rock concerts and in
university electronic music laboratories.
Moogs
Stanford's computer music program goes
far beyond the Moog. In fact, there are no
Moogs on the campus partly because research
on the Moog is very difficult. The synthesizer
lacks real precision and the sounds can not be
thoroughly analyzed.
Also, except for the computer work, the
Stanford music department offers few courses
in the "new music" that would involve
synthesizers or other electronic music. And
although Cohen is sympathetic to computer
and electronic music, Chowning's departure
leaves only one professor fully involved with
the computer.

That man is Leland Smith, a tall, bearded
music professor who grows ever more attached
to his computer terminal the longer he works
at the artificial intelligence lab.
Smith has recently written a computer
program that brings the art of musical
notation into the computer era. He uses a
TV-like terminal hooked to the computer to
arrange the notes, clefs, and other graphic
symbols of the music score.
When the score is finished, a few
instructions to the computer produce a
printed copy. The original is stored in the
computer's memory.
"It's my effort for the musical library- of
the future," says Smith. Another of his
programs allows musical notes, carefully
specified in terms of loudness, duration, and
other variables, to be played directly from the
computer's memory over a loudspeaker.
Notes Can Be Varied
The notes can be varied endlessly. By
typing a few commands, the operator can
change the sound of a clarinet to that of a
bassoon, or to a buzz, or to a "toot."
"You actually play the computer," says
Smith. As he types a few new instructions, he
changes the rhythms, the volume, and even
adds a few random notes to the music he has
created in a few minutes.
The vast possibilities of composition on a
computer have preoccupied the scientists and
composers in the project. Serious work has been
devoted not only to attempts to formulate new
music, but to analyze the sounds that come out as
well.
One of the prime requirements in the research is
to divide the universe of sounds into two
groups—sounds that have meaning to us, and those
that don't. The computer can theoretically produce
all sound, since sound can be reduced to numbers
stored in a computer memory.
Psycho acoustics
But which of the many combinations of
numbers, for example, sounds like a violin tone?
And which don't? John Grey, a psychologist in the
computer music group, is probing sound and its
meaning for humans, a field called psychoacoustics.
"We're trying to find clues to what the ear listens

to," says Andy Moorer, a graduate student in the
program, "and what it ignores."
"The idea is to simplify things so that we may
more easily create sounds like violins, bells, and so
on," Moorer says. By simplifying sound patterns,
researchers have drastically shortened the amount of
computer calculation needed for the computer to
generate that tone.
'Hal'
Some musicians say they find the atmosphere a
bit sterile, although the computer scientists have put
computer-printed portraits on the walls, and little
signs on the machines, including the name "HAL"
over the main memory bank.
In the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL was a
computer who tried to take control of humans on a
space voyage. HAL was eventually subdued, but as
he was short-circuited, he sang a song.
The irony of making music by harnessing a
powerful computer doesn't seem to bother the
computer musicians. "I still love to bang away on
the piano," says Loren Rush, a San Francisco

composer who created a three-minute work for
computer that seems to vibrate with th? overtones
of an Indian sitar.
"I don't think computer music will ever replace
that special relationship between a pevson and the
old-fashioned instrument he's playing," he says.
Other, younger musicians see the future a bit
differently. "I think it would be silly for a young
person to get totally involved in something like the
clarinet," says Dick Moore, a graduate student here
in computer acoustics who plays the clarinet.
Moore recently co-authored an article in Science
magazine with two other prominent computer
music researchers, writing that "We believe current
technology—computers, integrated circuits, and
make possible a new musical art,
one that will be immeasurably more potent than
existing music in certain ways."
The music of the future? If the proposals go
through, much of it may come from Stanford's
unique interaction of science and art.
