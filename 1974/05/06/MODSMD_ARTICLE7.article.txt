# Support Spitters

After the massive effort last
week to get students to re-register
Republican in order to vote for
Pete McCloskey, R-Menlo Park, I
would like to say a word about a
candidate running for the
Democratic nomination in this
same Congressional district —
Larry Spitters.
This is Spitters' first attempt to
run for public office, but he
brings to his candidacy a wealth
of other qualifications which I
feel demand some attention.
Spitters is from a poor family
of Dutch immigrants, yet still
managed to earn a Harvard MBA
and a Doctor of Jurisprudence
degree. He built Memorex
corporation from a small garage
operation to an international one
employing 5100 people.
On the way he managed to
successfully challenge IBM, so
much so that IBM was forced to
cut prices and battle anti-trust
suits at the same time.
Spitters is an expert in
economic areas, but has a very
sophisticated knowledge of
international relations and many
areas of national policy as well.
He is strongly pro-impeachment
and is very concerned about the
problem of inflation, especially
with its effects upon the aged and
the poor.
Supports Tax Reform
He is a forceful proponent of
major tax reform, and supports
cuts in the defense budget with
concurrent withdrawal of
American troops abroad. Even
though he is now a wealthy man,
he apparently has not forgotten
what it was like to be poor, since
he speaks with remarkable insight
and understanding on the
problems of poverty.
Perhaps the most impressive
aspect about Spitters is his

honesty and straightforwardness.
He has not resorted to the tactics
of name-calling and the like, but
rather speaks with integrity and
truthfulness about his opponents.
He has complimented the
work McCloskey has done on
some issues (conservation, etc.),
but at the same time has pointed
out a few of McCloskey's
weaknesses. For example,
McCloskey's attitude on economic
issues is essentially conservative
Republican — he favors a balanced
budget and is skeptical of welfare
programs.
In my own opinion McCloskey
is attempting to have the best of
both worlds; being a liberal and a
Republican at the same time is
bound to cause some
incongruities, as is witnessed by
the support Gerald Ford gave to
McCloskey.
Conservatives Wooed
Certainly the support given by
Ford was a political stroke of
genius by the McCloskey people —
an attempt to woo the
conservative Republicans into the
fold, right along with the more
liberal elements of his supporters,
Stanford students included.
I, for one, am wary of jumping
on any bandwagon for McCloskey
that includes a Gerald Ford who
publicly states that Richard Nixon
is innocent.
Thus, I urge those who have
not committed themselves to
McCloskey to investigate Spitters'
candidacy. He is a qualified and
insightful man who I feel would
effectively represent the liberal
interests of this district. Anyone
interested in meeting or working
with Larry Spitters should call
328-2854.

of other qualifications which I
feel demand some attention.
Spitters is from a poor family
of Dutch immigrants, yet still
managed to earn a Harvard MBA
and a Doctor of Jurisprudence
degree. He built Memorex
corporation from a small garage
operation to an international one
employing 5100 people.
On the way he managed to
successfully challenge IBM, so
much so that IBM was forced to
cut prices and battle anti-trust
suits at the same time.
Spitters is an expert in
economic areas, but has a very
sophisticated knowledge of
international relations and many
areas of national policy as well.
He is strongly pro-impeachment
and is very concerned about the
problem of inflation, especially
with its effects upon the aged and
the poor.
Supports Tax Reform
He is a forceful proponent of
major tax reform, and supports
cuts in the defense budget with
concurrent withdrawal of
American troops abroad. Even
though he is now a wealthy man,
he apparently has not forgotten
what it was like to be poor, since
he speaks with remarkable insight
and understanding on the
problems of poverty.
Perhaps the most impressive
aspect about Spitters is his

honesty and straightforwardness.
He has not resorted to the tactics
of name-calling and the like, but
rather speaks with integrity and
truthfulness about his opponents.
He has complimented the
work McCloskey has done on
some issues (conservation, etc.),
but at the same time has pointed
out a few of McCloskey's
weaknesses. For example,
McCloskey's attitude on economic
issues is essentially conservative
Republican — he favors a balanced
budget and is skeptical of welfare
programs.
In my own opinion McCloskey
is attempting to have the best of
both worlds; being a liberal and a
Republican at the same time is
bound to cause some
incongruities, as is witnessed by
the support Gerald Ford gave to
McCloskey.
Conservatives Wooed
Certainly the support given by
Ford was a political stroke of
genius by the McCloskey people —
an attempt to woo the
conservative Republicans into the
fold, right along with the more
liberal elements of his supporters,
Stanford students included.
I, for one, am wary of jumping
on any bandwagon for McCloskey
that includes a Gerald Ford who
publicly states that Richard Nixon
is innocent.
Thus, I urge those who have
not committed themselves to
McCloskey to investigate Spitters'
candidacy. He is a qualified and
insightful man who I feel would
effectively represent the liberal
interests of this district. Anyone
interested in meeting or working
with Larry Spitters should call
328-2854.

After the massive effort last
week to get students to re-register
Republican in order to vote for
Pete McCloskey, R-Menlo Park, I
would like to say a word about a
candidate running for the
Democratic nomination in this
same Congressional district —
Larry Spitters.
This is Spitters' first attempt to
run for public office, but he
