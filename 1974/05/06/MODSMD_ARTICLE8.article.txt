# On USE's Role

I have read Patricia Nash's
article (Daily May 2) and feel that
she makes some interesting points.
I too have felt that some of the
rhetoric in the union handouts is
rather overblown.
I am sure that Nash does
indeed find her position as a
faculty secretary in the law school
equal to or better than her
previous positions. I am also a law
school employee and it is a good
place to work.
However, the law school is not
the whole of Stanford, the
administration of the law school
does not necessarily represent the
University administration as a
whole, and a faculty secretary's
position and experience are not
typical of those of the
non-secretarial employee.
Benefits Enjoyed?
The benefits Nash mentioned
do exist; I consider it unlikely,
however, that a food service
worker I ($4OB-518), particularly
one with dependents, has much
opportunity to enjoy the benefits
of discount travel or recreational
opportunities, or prefers to
substitute aesthetic value for
take-home pay.
Within the past month the High
Energy Laboratory (Physics) has
terminated a number of
employees, at least one of whom
was given one month's notice of
termination after 23 years of
service. There are some who
would consider that a callous

action.
I would like to present one
thought for consideration. How
often do any of us give any
thought or feeling to the
economic or personal problems of
the grocery store checkout
attendant, the letter carrier, the
sales clerk, etc. Rarely, I suspect.
Dimly Perceived
I think that the University
administration perceives the
workers only dimly, as we
perceive those who provide
essential services for us. I think
that it is the function of the union
to educate the administration in
the needs and concerns of the
workers.
Many of the benefits which
Stanford does offer, and certainly
the salaries which have been
dramatically upgraded in recent
years, are offered in response to
an awareness that has been
created by the interest of the
workers in forming a union. If the
union did not directly obtain the
benefits, the climate produced by
employees' interest in a union
certainly was a factor in obtaining
the benefits.
I hope that the union will be
able to educate the University
community in the needs of the
workers while respecting the
convictions of those employees
who have reservations about a
union.
