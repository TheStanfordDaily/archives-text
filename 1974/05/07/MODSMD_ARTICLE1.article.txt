# Willy Brandt Resigns: Espionage Scandal
## 
### 
BONN (AP) — Willy Brandt, whose
East-West reconciliation policy earned
him the Nobel Peace Prize, resigned as
West German chancellor late yesterday
over a scandal involving East German
espionage.
In a dramatic and unexpected move
plunged his country into political
uncertainty, Brandt told President
Gustav Heinemann in a letter of
resignation that he accepted
responsibility for "negligence" in
connection with the espionage role of
a close aide, Guenther Guillaume, 47.
A spokesman said Heinemann
received Brandt's letter while on a trip
to Hamburg and accepted the
resignation.
Brandt's move came after the
opposition charged that chancellory
officials ignored security service
warnings in approving the
appointment of Guillaume to Brandt's
staff.
Guillaume, who became Brandt's
aide for party political affairs in late
1972, was unmasked April 24 as an
East German spy.
The 60-year-old chancellor's letter
to Heinemann asked him to appoint
Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister
Walter Scheel as caretaker head of
government until a new chancellor is
elected.
Scheel, who heads the small Free
Democratic party which has shared a
ruling coalition with Brandt's Social
Democrats since 1969, was planning to
resign as foreign minister and vice
chancellor this month to succeed
Heinemann as' the largly ceremonial
head of state.
Brandt's popularity had begun to
wane from its high points — in 1971
when he won the Nobel Peace Prize
for his Ostpolitik efforts at
accommodation with the Communist
Eastern bloc, and in 1972 when he
signed a normalization agreement with
East Germany.

Lately an increasing number of
West Germans have viewed Ostpolitik
with displeasure. The spy scandal
intensified that feeling.
The West German economy also has
been hit hard by the energy shortage
and inflation, and the chancellor's
Social Democrats have suffered in
provincial elections.
Reliable sources in Brandt's party
said early today that a joint
commission of the coalition parties
would prepare a new government
program this week and discuss a
Cabinet realignment.
Sources said the two parties will ask
Bundestag President Annemarie
Renger to schedule parliamentary
balloting on a new chancellor for May
17.
That would be a day after the
special electoral assembly meets in
Bonn to chose a successor to
Heinemann, 74, who is retiring for age
reasons.

BONN (AP) — Willy Brandt, whose
East-West reconciliation policy earned
him the Nobel Peace Prize, resigned as
West German chancellor late yesterday
over a scandal involving East German
espionage.
In a dramatic and unexpected move
plunged his country into political
uncertainty, Brandt told President
Gustav Heinemann in a letter of
resignation that he accepted
responsibility for "negligence" in
connection with the espionage role of
a close aide, Guenther Guillaume, 47.
A spokesman said Heinemann
received Brandt's letter while on a trip
to Hamburg and accepted the
resignation.
Brandt's move came after the
opposition charged that chancellory
officials ignored security service
warnings in approving the
appointment of Guillaume to Brandt's
staff.
Guillaume, who became Brandt's
aide for party political affairs in late
1972, was unmasked April 24 as an
East German spy.
The 60-year-old chancellor's letter
to Heinemann asked him to appoint
Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister
Walter Scheel as caretaker head of
government until a new chancellor is
elected.
Scheel, who heads the small Free
Democratic party which has shared a
ruling coalition with Brandt's Social
Democrats since 1969, was planning to
resign as foreign minister and vice
chancellor this month to succeed
Heinemann as' the largly ceremonial
head of state.
Brandt's popularity had begun to
wane from its high points — in 1971
when he won the Nobel Peace Prize
for his Ostpolitik efforts at
accommodation with the Communist
Eastern bloc, and in 1972 when he
signed a normalization agreement with
East Germany.

Lately an increasing number of
West Germans have viewed Ostpolitik
with displeasure. The spy scandal
intensified that feeling.
The West German economy also has
been hit hard by the energy shortage
and inflation, and the chancellor's
Social Democrats have suffered in
provincial elections.
Reliable sources in Brandt's party
said early today that a joint
commission of the coalition parties
would prepare a new government
program this week and discuss a
Cabinet realignment.
Sources said the two parties will ask
Bundestag President Annemarie
Renger to schedule parliamentary
balloting on a new chancellor for May
17.
That would be a day after the
special electoral assembly meets in
Bonn to chose a successor to
Heinemann, 74, who is retiring for age
reasons.
