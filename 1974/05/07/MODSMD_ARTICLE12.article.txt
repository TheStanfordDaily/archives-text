# On The Democratic Primary Race
## 
### 
William Ross 3

Although many Stanford students are
registered Democrats, surprisingly little
interest here has focused on the Democratic
primary race in the 12th Congressional
District, which includes the University.
Perhaps this is because Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R—Menlo Park, the popular
Republican incumbent, has distracted
attention from the Democratic race in his
highly publicized struggle to win the GOP
primary.
Apathy regarding the Democratic primary
may also exist because none of the four
Democrats in the contest seem to be headed
for certain nomination. Furthermore, none
of the candidates seem to be well known on
the Stanford campus.
Probably the best known of the four at
Stanford is Herbert Rhodes, a University
employment representative and member of
the East Palo Alto Municipal Council.
Neo-Populist Overtones
Rhodes, 44, told the Daily at the start of
his campaign that he would emphasize the
need to send a man to Congress who lacks
the business and political connections that
have corrupted many officials. Rhodes'
campaign seems to contain distinct
neo-populist overtones.
Rhodes has concentrated much of his
campaign rhetoric on the issue of energy.
Calling recently disclosed oil profits "a
national disgrace," Rhodes has called for a
roll-back in gasoline prices, an end to
monopolies in the oil industry and public
audit of oil reserves.
At the beginning of the campaign, the
leading contender was generally
acknowledged to be Gary Gillmor, the mayor
of Santa Clara. Gillmor's apparent advantage

in the race has been attributed to the fact
that his name is widely recognized by the
voters of the district as a result of his long
standing participation in local politics.
Minimal Financing
Gillmor has emphasized the need to
conduct a campaign that relies on a minimum
of financing. Consequently, he offered
contracts to the six other candidates in the
12th Congressional District in which his
opponents were asked to spend no more than
$15,000 in the primary.
None of his Democratic opponents
accepted the offer, claiming that they needed
to establish better name recognition. Among
Republicans, only John Fredrich, a candidate
with no funds, agreed to the proposal.
Gillmor, 36, seems to want to make the
rejections of this offer into a campaign issue.
In a recent Daily interview, he noted that the
other Democrats said the plan was unfair
because they were not as well known as
Gillmor. But Gillmor argued that he is well
known because he has worked long and hard
to respond to the needs of the people in the
district. Hence his name recognition is not an
unfair advantage, he argued.
Local Issues Stressed
During the Daily interview, this reporter
received the impression that Gillmor is
primarily interested in local issues. As
representative, he would probably serve as
protector of constituent interests rather than
as a spokesman on national issues.
Also seeking the Democratic nomination
in the primary is Lawrence Spitters, the
former president of Memorex Corp. Spitters'
campaign started later than those of the
other candidates and Spitters has been forced
to spend most of his time thus far defending

himself against charges that the Memorex
Corp. violated the Securities Act of 1934 in
its 1970 report. Spitters' campaign has yet to
take shape.
In contrast to some of the other
candidates, Thomas Skornia, 39, conveys the
impression of being a cosmopolitan who is
interested in both local and national issues.
Skornia, a Palo Alto attorney, is conducting a
vigorous campaign and seems to believe that
he has a good chance of winning the June 4
primary.
Like candidates for almost every office this
year, Skornia is emphasizing the need for
people to have confidence in their public
officials.
Unemployment Benefits
Noting that there are 25,000 jobs in the
12th Congressional District that are
vulnerable to cutbacks in fuel allocations,
Skornia is advocating the establishment by
Congress of permanent unemployment
benefits for people who lose their jobs due to
the energy crisis.
Skornia also believes in a return to the
Keynesian economic policies of the early
1960's which he believes were responsible for
the prosperity of the Kennedy-Johnson
years.
Long active in liberal Democratic politics,
Skornia was active in 1964 in the campaign
to preserve a California's open housing law.
In 1968, he was Marin County co-chairman
of the Eugene McCarthy-For-President
campaign.
More than the other candidates, Skornia is
emphasizing the need for an expansion of
women's rights.

Although many Stanford students are
registered Democrats, surprisingly little
interest here has focused on the Democratic
primary race in the 12th Congressional
District, which includes the University.
Perhaps this is because Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R—Menlo Park, the popular
Republican incumbent, has distracted
attention from the Democratic race in his
highly publicized struggle to win the GOP
primary.
Apathy regarding the Democratic primary
may also exist because none of the four
Democrats in the contest seem to be headed
for certain nomination. Furthermore, none
of the candidates seem to be well known on
the Stanford campus.
Probably the best known of the four at
Stanford is Herbert Rhodes, a University
employment representative and member of
the East Palo Alto Municipal Council.
Neo-Populist Overtones
Rhodes, 44, told the Daily at the start of
his campaign that he would emphasize the
need to send a man to Congress who lacks
the business and political connections that
have corrupted many officials. Rhodes'
campaign seems to contain distinct
neo-populist overtones.
Rhodes has concentrated much of his
campaign rhetoric on the issue of energy.
Calling recently disclosed oil profits "a
national disgrace," Rhodes has called for a
roll-back in gasoline prices, an end to
monopolies in the oil industry and public
audit of oil reserves.
At the beginning of the campaign, the
leading contender was generally
acknowledged to be Gary Gillmor, the mayor
of Santa Clara. Gillmor's apparent advantage

in the race has been attributed to the fact
that his name is widely recognized by the
voters of the district as a result of his long
standing participation in local politics.
Minimal Financing
Gillmor has emphasized the need to
conduct a campaign that relies on a minimum
of financing. Consequently, he offered
contracts to the six other candidates in the
12th Congressional District in which his
opponents were asked to spend no more than
$15,000 in the primary.
None of his Democratic opponents
accepted the offer, claiming that they needed
to establish better name recognition. Among
Republicans, only John Fredrich, a candidate
with no funds, agreed to the proposal.
Gillmor, 36, seems to want to make the
rejections of this offer into a campaign issue.
In a recent Daily interview, he noted that the
other Democrats said the plan was unfair
because they were not as well known as
Gillmor. But Gillmor argued that he is well
known because he has worked long and hard
to respond to the needs of the people in the
district. Hence his name recognition is not an
unfair advantage, he argued.
Local Issues Stressed
During the Daily interview, this reporter
received the impression that Gillmor is
primarily interested in local issues. As
representative, he would probably serve as
protector of constituent interests rather than
as a spokesman on national issues.
Also seeking the Democratic nomination
in the primary is Lawrence Spitters, the
former president of Memorex Corp. Spitters'
campaign started later than those of the
other candidates and Spitters has been forced
to spend most of his time thus far defending

himself against charges that the Memorex
Corp. violated the Securities Act of 1934 in
its 1970 report. Spitters' campaign has yet to
take shape.
In contrast to some of the other
candidates, Thomas Skornia, 39, conveys the
impression of being a cosmopolitan who is
interested in both local and national issues.
Skornia, a Palo Alto attorney, is conducting a
vigorous campaign and seems to believe that
he has a good chance of winning the June 4
primary.
Like candidates for almost every office this
year, Skornia is emphasizing the need for
people to have confidence in their public
officials.
Unemployment Benefits
Noting that there are 25,000 jobs in the
12th Congressional District that are
vulnerable to cutbacks in fuel allocations,
Skornia is advocating the establishment by
Congress of permanent unemployment
benefits for people who lose their jobs due to
the energy crisis.
Skornia also believes in a return to the
Keynesian economic policies of the early
1960's which he believes were responsible for
the prosperity of the Kennedy-Johnson
years.
Long active in liberal Democratic politics,
Skornia was active in 1964 in the campaign
to preserve a California's open housing law.
In 1968, he was Marin County co-chairman
of the Eugene McCarthy-For-President
campaign.
More than the other candidates, Skornia is
emphasizing the need for an expansion of
women's rights.
