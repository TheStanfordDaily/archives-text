# University Ignores Employee Rights
## 
### 
Joseph Virga 1

There has been a great deal
printed in both the Daily and
Campus Report as well as a great
many handouts distributed by
USE and the University dealing
with the ongoing negotiations.
Each side has accused the other of
dealing unfairly and of
disregarding the feelings and needs
of the individual employee. Each
group wishes to persuade the
workers and the public in general
of the reasonableness of its
position.
What it boils down to for
employees and the general public
is what our personal experiences
with the University have been and
how much trust we put in the
University as opposed to USE.
The University has always
emphasized that it deals with
employees on a personal basis and
as fairly as possible. The
University would like us to believe
that it has our good in mind in all
that it does and that USE is being
entirely unreasonable and radical
in its demands and position.
At one time I would have
agreed, but no longer.
After working for the
University full time for nearly
three years as an emergency
communications dispatcher, I am
sorry to say I can no longer feel
the University is fair and honest in
its dealings with employees.
No Real Concession
If you have read any of the
University's publications
concerning negotiations you will
remember that they made a point
of mentioning that they have
offered a premium pay
differential of 10 percent and 15
percent respectively for swing
shift and grave yard workers. This
might seem like a great concession

by the University to the unaware.
What the University fails to
mention is the fact that nearly
everyone who works these shifts is
already being paid this
differential. In fact, to my
knowledge only the emergency
communications dispatchers are
not presently receiving this
premium.
So the University is offering to
give its workers what they already
have and to include the
dispatchers in the bargain. To add
injury to insult, the University has
offered to make this pay starting
at the signing of the contract and
not retroactively to Sept. 1, 1973
as all the other provisions of the
contract are.
Normal Channels Used
My fellow shift workers and I
at Emergency Communications
have been working through the
normal channels over this and
several other job-related items for
many months. We believed in the
fairness of the University and in
its willingness to deal with the
individual.
After having gone through all
our supervisors without any
results we finally resorted to a
formal grievance procedure in
November 1973. We were delayed
and denied until March when we
were told verbally by a member of
the University negotiations team
that we should be getting that pay
and that we should have been
getting it all along. Yet, when the
contract offer by the University
came out, we found ourselves
abandoned.
The stationary engineers at the
Steam Plant, the computer
operators, and the
telecommunications people at
Centrex all filed grievances and all

won the differential as well as
receiving retroactive pay. We only
ask the University to give us what
it had already given the other
people it employed who worked
similar hours.
Small Group Overlooked
There are only six dispatchers
eligible for this pay and it would
appear that since we're such a
small group of "individuals," the
University can overlook and deny
us what it has given to everybody
else.
I wonder how many other
small groups of "individuals" have
encountered this same lack of

concern for their rights and
welfare that the University has
shown my fellow disptachers and
me.
USE offers us workers the
respect we deserve as individuals
and the strength we need in order
to make ourselves heard by the
University.
When and if USE calls a strike,
I will s f and in the picket line —
not because I want to leave my
job, but because the University
has forced me to by its lack of
concern for me as an individual
and employee.

There has been a great deal
printed in both the Daily and
Campus Report as well as a great
many handouts distributed by
USE and the University dealing
with the ongoing negotiations.
Each side has accused the other of
dealing unfairly and of
disregarding the feelings and needs
of the individual employee. Each
group wishes to persuade the
workers and the public in general
of the reasonableness of its
position.
What it boils down to for
employees and the general public
is what our personal experiences
with the University have been and
how much trust we put in the
University as opposed to USE.
The University has always
emphasized that it deals with
employees on a personal basis and
as fairly as possible. The
University would like us to believe
that it has our good in mind in all
that it does and that USE is being
entirely unreasonable and radical
in its demands and position.
At one time I would have
agreed, but no longer.
After working for the
University full time for nearly
three years as an emergency
communications dispatcher, I am
sorry to say I can no longer feel
the University is fair and honest in
its dealings with employees.
No Real Concession
If you have read any of the
University's publications
concerning negotiations you will
remember that they made a point
of mentioning that they have
offered a premium pay
differential of 10 percent and 15
percent respectively for swing
shift and grave yard workers. This
might seem like a great concession

by the University to the unaware.
What the University fails to
mention is the fact that nearly
everyone who works these shifts is
already being paid this
differential. In fact, to my
knowledge only the emergency
communications dispatchers are
not presently receiving this
premium.
So the University is offering to
give its workers what they already
have and to include the
dispatchers in the bargain. To add
injury to insult, the University has
offered to make this pay starting
at the signing of the contract and
not retroactively to Sept. 1, 1973
as all the other provisions of the
contract are.
Normal Channels Used
My fellow shift workers and I
at Emergency Communications
have been working through the
normal channels over this and
several other job-related items for
many months. We believed in the
fairness of the University and in
its willingness to deal with the
individual.
After having gone through all
our supervisors without any
results we finally resorted to a
formal grievance procedure in
November 1973. We were delayed
and denied until March when we
were told verbally by a member of
the University negotiations team
that we should be getting that pay
and that we should have been
getting it all along. Yet, when the
contract offer by the University
came out, we found ourselves
abandoned.
The stationary engineers at the
Steam Plant, the computer
operators, and the
telecommunications people at
Centrex all filed grievances and all

won the differential as well as
receiving retroactive pay. We only
ask the University to give us what
it had already given the other
people it employed who worked
similar hours.
Small Group Overlooked
There are only six dispatchers
eligible for this pay and it would
appear that since we're such a
small group of "individuals," the
University can overlook and deny
us what it has given to everybody
else.
I wonder how many other
small groups of "individuals" have
encountered this same lack of

concern for their rights and
welfare that the University has
shown my fellow disptachers and
me.
USE offers us workers the
respect we deserve as individuals
and the strength we need in order
to make ourselves heard by the
University.
When and if USE calls a strike,
I will s f and in the picket line —
not because I want to leave my
job, but because the University
has forced me to by its lack of
concern for me as an individual
and employee.
