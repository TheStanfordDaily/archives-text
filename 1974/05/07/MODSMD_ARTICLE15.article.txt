Editor:
Although I have very seldom
written a letter to a newspaper,
Prof. Pauline Newman-Gordon's
article (Daily, April 20) has
shaken me into joining her
protest. As curator for romance
languages materials in the
Stanford libraries, I am obviously
biased, but I can not believe that
Stanford University could be
short-sighted as to abandon
foreign language study entirely.
As the world daily grows
smaller due to technical
improvements in communication,
how can we afford to erect
unnecessary barriers to
understanding by ignoring the
language of other peoples?
Interpretation and translation will
never supplant even an imperfect
original.
Actually, the mere effort of
attempting to learn the other
person's language establishes a
sympathetic relationship and the
beginning of a deeper
understanding.
Finally, let us not forget the
advantages to the student of the
discipline of learning another
language. Prof. Newman-Gordon
mentioned this in passing, but it
should not be taken lightly.
Even if the process is painful at
times, the satisfaction of
accomplishment as the new field
opens up is one of the great joys
of learning. If all the difficult
parts are to be extracted from a
university education, what will be
left?

At the risk of belaboring the
point, I would like to comment
on Brad Levin's article (Daily,
May 3).
Levin really seems to argue for
an increase in involvement on the
part of progressive Republicans.
As a progressive Republican I
fully support this conclusion. The
likes of McCloskey and Brooke
will only be secure when large
numbers of forward looking
Republicans take an active part in
GOP candidate selection.
However, I disagree that
Independents and Democrats
should sit by and watch one of
the nation's most outspoken and
effective congressmen fall by the
wayside because a small
conservative Republicans refuse to
nominate him.
Each voter has a responsibility
to determine which candidate he
supports and then work to assure
his victory. The primary system is
not designed to prevent citizens
from voting for their favorite
candidate.
Party registration is simply the
method by which one involves
oneself in the candidate selection
process. It requires neither an
ideological test nor proof of
loyalty to a party.
The system of democracy in
the U.S. demands that the
individual candidate prove himself
regardless of party. When a
candidate like McCloskey
demonstrates his ability, party
politics must not deter us from
lending our total support.
The California primary is June

Jones Should Resign
Editor:
I hope that Stanford trustee
Thomas Jones has the good sense
to resign from his important
University post now that he is a
convicted criminal.
If Northrop Corp. wishes to
retain Jones "in the best interests
of the corporation," that is its
business. However, it is hard to
understand how the continued
presence of a convicted criminal
in the midst of our corporation
could serve our best interests. I
should think that the remaining
unconvicted trustees would be as
offended as I am at that notion.
Official University reaction is
understandably slow in
forthcoming. After all, we are in
the midst of a fund-raising
campaign ourselves, so the
successes of the friends, criminals,
and criminals-to-be associated
with the Republican Committee
for the Re-election of the
President (CREEP) can hardly be
overlooked. . . .
Nevertheless, if Jones won't
resign, perhaps President Lyman
and the trustees will have the
good sense to remove him.

numbers of forward looking
Republicans take an active part in
GOP candidate selection.
However, I disagree that
Independents and Democrats
should sit by and watch one of
the nation's most outspoken and
effective congressmen fall by the
wayside because a small
conservative Republicans refuse to
nominate him.
Each voter has a responsibility
to determine which candidate he
supports and then work to assure
his victory. The primary system is
not designed to prevent citizens
from voting for their favorite
candidate.
Party registration is simply the
method by which one involves
oneself in the candidate selection
process. It requires neither an
ideological test nor proof of
loyalty to a party.
The system of democracy in
the U.S. demands that the
individual candidate prove himself
regardless of party. When a
candidate like McCloskey
demonstrates his ability, party
politics must not deter us from
lending our total support.
The California primary is June

Jones Should Resign
Editor:
I hope that Stanford trustee
Thomas Jones has the good sense
to resign from his important
University post now that he is a
convicted criminal.
If Northrop Corp. wishes to
retain Jones "in the best interests
of the corporation," that is its
business. However, it is hard to
understand how the continued
presence of a convicted criminal
in the midst of our corporation
could serve our best interests. I
should think that the remaining
unconvicted trustees would be as
offended as I am at that notion.
Official University reaction is
understandably slow in
forthcoming. After all, we are in
the midst of a fund-raising
campaign ourselves, so the
successes of the friends, criminals,
and criminals-to-be associated
with the Republican Committee
for the Re-election of the
President (CREEP) can hardly be
overlooked. . . .
Nevertheless, if Jones won't
resign, perhaps President Lyman
and the trustees will have the
good sense to remove him.

Although I have very seldom
written a letter to a newspaper,
Prof. Pauline Newman-Gordon's
article (Daily, April 20) has
shaken me into joining her
protest. As curator for romance
languages materials in the
Stanford libraries, I am obviously
biased, but I can not believe that
Stanford University could be
short-sighted as to abandon
foreign language study entirely.
As the world daily grows
smaller due to technical
improvements in communication,
how can we afford to erect
unnecessary barriers to
understanding by ignoring the
language of other peoples?
Interpretation and translation will
never supplant even an imperfect
original.
Actually, the mere effort of
attempting to learn the other
person's language establishes a
sympathetic relationship and the
beginning of a deeper
understanding.
Finally, let us not forget the
advantages to the student of the
discipline of learning another
language. Prof. Newman-Gordon
mentioned this in passing, but it
should not be taken lightly.
Even if the process is painful at
times, the satisfaction of
accomplishment as the new field
opens up is one of the great joys
of learning. If all the difficult
parts are to be extracted from a
university education, what will be
left?

At the risk of belaboring the
point, I would like to comment
on Brad Levin's article (Daily,

Levin really seems to argue for
an increase in involvement on the
part of progressive Republicans.
As a progressive Republican I
fully support this conclusion. The
likes of McCloskey and Brooke
will only be secure when large
numbers of forward looking
Republicans take an active part in
GOP candidate selection.
