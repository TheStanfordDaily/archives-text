# Indians Celebrate Pow Wow

### JAVED SHAH SUSAN LUTTNER 
A pow wow, sponsored by the
Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO) attracted
more than 500 native Americans
from as far away as Montana and
Canada last weekend.
SAIO members set up a pow
wow circle in the practice field
between El Camino and the
Stanford Stadium, and invited
Bay Area Indian groups. Most of
the participants were Californians.
Visiting Indians, dressed in
traditional costumes, played
drums, chanted, and danced for
several hours each day.
Around the edge of the field,
other native Americans sold
Indian food, jewelry, and crafts.
Mary Thompson, student
coordinator of the event, said that
present-day pow wows are a
homogenization of different tribal

traditions. Pow wows were
originally religious ceremonies
among the plains Indians, but are
now social events involving several
tribes.
The predominant attitude
among Indians participating this
weekend was that the event was
planned as fun for the dancers
rather than an exhibition for the
spectators. "We just decided we
wanted to bring a lot of Indians
together and have fun," said
Thompson.
The program centered around
the singers and dancers, with eight
contests scheduled between
continuous group dances.
Violet Cook, SAIO member
and contest judge, said that
dancers were evaluated on three
points: authenticity of costume,
fluidity of movement with respect
to the drum, and how well the

costumes stayed intact during the
dance.
Singers sat in groups of three
to 10 around large drums. They
beat the drum together, chanting
traditional songs for the dancers.
Since cultures are so different in
different areas of the country,
there were both northern and
southern drummers.
California Indian groups have
almost weekly pow wows during
the summer, said Jo Ann Harris, a
Navajo from Oakland. She and her
family attend when they can
reach them by car. Otherwise
there are smaller weekly dances at
the San Jose or Oakland centers.
Around the pow wow area,
visitors camped in tents, trailers,
and even a few teepees. (There are
only about 100 native Americans
at the University, half of them
undergraduates.)
