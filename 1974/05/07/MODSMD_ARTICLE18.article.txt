# Lightfoot Sings Well, Talks Little
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Amidst the tossing of frisbees,
the gliding of balsa wood gliders
and the total picnic atmosphere
that pervaded Frost Amphitheater
Sunday afternoon, Gordon
Lightfoot proved to the capacity
crowd of over 10,000 that he is
indeed a professional singer, not a
conversationalist.
Although Lightfoot expertly
performed a substantial number
of songs right on key, his style
frequently came across as
mechanical primarily because he
didn't speak to the audience
either at the beginning or between
numbers. Only at the end did he
say a few things to the crowd —
but it was clear by then that his
lack of personality had made this
a good concert not a superb one.
After people had drunk their
wine, eaten their fruit and settled
down for a peaceful afternoon,
they were immediately put into
fine spirits by the bluegrass team
of Doc and Merle Watson, who
not only exhibited guitar and
banjo picking talent but got the
audience to tap its toes and
whoop like coyotes. The Watsons
enthusiastically excited the crowd
and it was obvious that they
(particularly Doc) had fun too.
ASSU special events directors
Doug Baldwin and Dan Scher
must be acknowledged for
providing a superior sound system
and for hiring the Watsons as a
first act to break ground for
Lightfoot. Certainly, they seemed
to add the pizzaz that Lightfoot
left at home.
Not to say that Lightfoot was
bad — on the contrary, he was as
good as his records. But that's the
problem — a concert should
provide an intimacy that records
don't. And in this concert,
Lightfoot came across without

warmth, as a man who was doing
the very minimum necessary to
earn his pay.
Clad in a white open shirt and
red-patched blue jeans, Lightfoot
carried a well polished
reddish-brown twelve-string guitar
onto the stage and, without even
greeting the audience, began to
play and sing. Within an hour, he
performed eighteen songs, almost
equaling the amount of
commercials that AM radio
stations run per hour. But he said
scarcely a word.
Indeed his renditions could not
have been better. Lightfoot's AM
"hits," "If You Could Read My
Mind," "Don Quixote,"
"Beautiful" (which some
members of the crowd disrupted
by making noise) and the current
hit "Sundown" were delivered
with polish. Other less familiar
songs including "High and Dry,"
"Watchman's Gone" and"The
Auctioneer's Song" were equally
enjoyable.
Lightfoot frequently
alternated between six and
twelve string guitar and this was
effective, visually as well as
acoustically.
Bass player Rick Haynes
particularly excelled on "Ode To
Big Blue" (a salute to whales.)
Lightfoot's rendition of his own
"In the Early Mornin' Rain" was
perhaps faster than necessary and
that added to the mechanistic
feeling which infiltrated
Lightfoot's portion of the
concert.
Lightfoot's most emotionally
charged renditions were
"Canadian Railroad Trilogy"
(about his homeland) and "Me
and Bobby McGee," which ended
the concert after the audience had
called Lightfoot from backstage
for the second time. In this

number, Lightfoot actually asked
the audience to join in and there
was a sense of his getting into
what he was doing — probably the
first sense of that all day, and it
lasted briefly.
The audience enjoyed
Lightfoot's performance as did
this reviewer. But the
performance seemed to lack
enthusiasm. Gordon Lightfoot is
probably the most popular male
folk singer today. His voice is

rustic and unique. His songs are
from the soul. And one becomes
disappointed when his in-person
rendition of them is not.
Someone in the crowc
commented toward the end of the
day, "What better way could
there be to spend a Sunday
afternoon!" How true that is —
but there is a better way for
Gordon Lightfoot to give a
concert. It is called a whole-souled
approach and next time, we wil.
settle for nothing less.

MINSTREL OF THE DAWN—Like a character from one of his own songs, Gordon Lightfoot serenaded
several thousand people Sunday in Frost Amphitheater. Backed by bassist Rick Haynes and lead guitarist
Terry Clemens, Lightfoot sang but a fraction of his repertoire in a performance which may have been the
least charismatic of his five most recent Bay Area concerts. Nevertheless, Lightfoot was called back for
two encores by the Frost crowd.

POPCORN, ANYONE?—The fair maiden above was one of many
student vendors who attempted to make their way through the
overflow crowd at Frost Amphitheater Sunday. Bikinied bodies and
trunked torsoeswere predominant in the crowd.
