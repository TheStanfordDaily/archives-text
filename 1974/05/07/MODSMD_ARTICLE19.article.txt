# Strums, Stomps, Sunshine, Several Thousand Smiles
## Backstage With Lightfoot... 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
Gordon Lightfoot hot-footed into Frost
Amphitheater at about 12:30 p.m. behind the
wheel of a rust colored rent-a-car. After briefly
scrutinizing the crowd, Lightfoot changed clothes
backstage — from a pair of new-looking rust velvet
jeans and white t-shirt to a pair of patched blue
jeans and a blue workshirt spangled with Canadian
medals.
Thus clad in calculated hippie-gypsy style,
Lightfoot strolled along the perimeter of the crowd
attempting to see the Watsons on stage. Many
people didn't recognize Lightfoot as he sat on the
northwest side of Frost Amphitheater.
Another change of clothes and two encores
later, Lightfoot smilingly signed autographs for
little girls and bigger girls, flirted with groupies,
belted down beer, and answered a couple of
interview questions.
"Well, ya know, it's awfully hard to play for
11,000 people," Lightfoot explains. "You feel
really drained.
"We've been doing this for three days now, and
we haven't been behaving ourselves — you know,
drinkin', stayin' out late, smokin' a little dope."
Serious questioning proves futile. Asked about
his philosophy in presenting a concert, Lightfoot
only laughs a little, rolling his pale eyes
heavenward.
Talking about the man's music is far easier.
Lightfoot says that a new album is "in the works,"
and then comments to one of his crew, "Shit, we
should've done .. ." and names a new song.
"Well, sing it now," says someone in the crowd,
and Lightfoot obliges by singing a few verses while
sitting on the back of his car.
Answers to highly personal questions — such as
the source material for the song "Sundown" or
Lightfoot's astrological sign — get whispered into
the ears of groupies and journalists, causing giggles
from the female fans gathered around.
"I just want to shake your hand, because I feel
like I know you," says a boy in the crowd as
Lightfoot takes his hand. The handshake says more
about what Lightfoot is to people than ten serious
answers to serious questions could say.




The bluegrass picking of Doc and Merle Watson and the musical poems of Gordon
Lightfoot brought thousands to their feet Sunday in Frost Amphitheater. A stage-eye
view of the crowd and a characteristic Lightfoot whisper in the ear of Doc Watson
backstage are captured above by Daily photographer Doug Archerd. Lightfoot's sideline
smile and Watson on stage are seen in closeup's by Daily photographer Cathy Lane.

Lightfoot strolled along the perimeter of the crowd
attempting to see the Watsons on stage. Many
people didn't recognize Lightfoot as he sat on the
northwest side of Frost Amphitheater.
Another change of clothes and two encores
later, Lightfoot smilingly signed autographs for
little girls and bigger girls, flirted with groupies,
belted down beer, and answered a couple of
interview questions.
"Well, ya know, it's awfully hard to play for
11,000 people," Lightfoot explains. "You feel
really drained.
"We've been doing this for three days now, and
we haven't been behaving ourselves — you know,
drinkin', stayin' out late, smokin' a little dope."
Serious questioning proves futile. Asked about
his philosophy in presenting a concert, Lightfoot
only laughs a little, rolling his pale eyes
heavenward.
Talking about the man's music is far easier.
Lightfoot says that a new album is "in the works,"
and then comments to one of his crew, "Shit, we
should've done .. ." and names a new song.
"Well, sing it now," says someone in the crowd,
and Lightfoot obliges by singing a few verses while
sitting on the back of his car.
Answers to highly personal questions — such as
the source material for the song "Sundown" or
Lightfoot's astrological sign — get whispered into
the ears of groupies and journalists, causing giggles
from the female fans gathered around.
"I just want to shake your hand, because I feel
like I know you," says a boy in the crowd as
Lightfoot takes his hand. The handshake says more
about what Lightfoot is to people than ten serious
answers to serious questions could say.




The bluegrass picking of Doc and Merle Watson and the musical poems of Gordon
Lightfoot brought thousands to their feet Sunday in Frost Amphitheater. A stage-eye
view of the crowd and a characteristic Lightfoot whisper in the ear of Doc Watson
backstage are captured above by Daily photographer Doug Archerd. Lightfoot's sideline
smile and Watson on stage are seen in closeup's by Daily photographer Cathy Lane.
