# Senate Approves Board For Guest Professorship
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The ASSIJ Senate last night quickly
ipproved a by-laws addition which
creates a new guest professorship
board.
The new board will oversee
arrangements for sponsoring ASSU
guest professors, and will have sole
authority to nominate prospective
guest professors to the Senate.
The Senate selected as the initial
members of the board former ASSU
President Kevin o'Grady, representing
the Action Research Liaison Office;

John Mensinger, representing SCIRE;
and Michelle de Planque and Gerald
Koblentz of Columbae House to
represent the Senate.
A fifth member, representing the
SWOPSI Policy Board, will be
appointed when that board makes a
recommendation, according to
By-Laws Committee Chairman Michael
Amylon.
One Year Term
The five students will serve fall
through summer quarters.
The Senate action follows last
month's student vote to invite
Vietnamese journalist Nguyen Huu
Thai here as a guest professor.
Thai was recently released from a
South Vietnamese prison but remains
under house arrest in Saigon and must
report to police daily, according to
David Marr of the Indochina Resource
Center in Berkeley.
Needs U.S. Permission
The professorship board will first
try to gain "institutional support" for
Thai's release from the the University
through a major department,
according to de Planque.
She expressed hope that Thai
would gain his exit visa and permission
from the Federal government to enter
the United States, but warned that if
Thai does not become a guest
professor, the board will decide on a
new person.
Board members will take
suggestions from students, she said.
In other actions, the Senate
unanimously approved a proposal
which may end controversy over what
information University President
Richard Lyman will be given
concerning student applications to
positions on University committees.
Lyman had requested that he not
only be given "public information" on
student nominees to his advisory
committees, but also a statement of
qualifications for each prospective
committee member.
Public information is comprised of
name, address, telephone number,
class and past committee experience.
Under the new proposal the Senate
will give not only "public
information" but also previous
"relevant" committee experience.
"If the nominee has no previous
experience in the committee system,
then other relevant previous
experience will be substituted," the
proposal stated.
Amylon stressed that "only factual
information will be provided."
