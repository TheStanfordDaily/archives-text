Doc Watson, flat-pick guitarist from Deep Gap,
North Carolina, brought his guitars and his band
across the country for a five week tour in an
air-conditioned Winnebago. But no women.
"You talk about something breaking up a crew
fast," said Doc's son Merle, who accompanies him,
"nothing'll break up a show faster than some
women."
Doc and Merle have been on tour for five weeks.
Since Doc and Merle recorded their first album
together in 1971, they have been away from home
20 days out of every month.
Even though traveling the circuit helps record
sales, home in the southern end of the Blue Ridge
Mountains is where they'd rather be.
"There's only one thing more important than
my music," said Doc, "and that's takin' care of my
family, and lovin' them."
Doc has played music all his working life. "If I
was a sighted man," he said, "music would have
been a hobby."
When he was proded a little, he spoke of his two
grandchildren. "Shucks," he said, "you're only
young as you feel."
