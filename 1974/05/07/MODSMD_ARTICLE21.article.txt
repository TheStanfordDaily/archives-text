Nixon Transcripts Questioned
WASHINGTON — The Senate Watergate
committee said yesterday the White
House-released transcripts of presidential
conversations "are suspect" and "neither
complete nor accurate."
The committee told the U.S. Court of
Appeals it still needs the five conversations
subpoenaed July 23 last year despite the
transcripts that cover the conversations.
Even the incomplete versions of the five
conversations, the committee said, vindicate its
claim that the tapes are needed "to inform the
public of the extent of corruption in the
executive branch."
The appeals court last week asked the
committee to say whether it still needed the five
conversations despite release of the transcripts.
The committee said the answer "is
unequivocally and emphatically in the
affirmative," and that it is essential that it have
a complete and accurate account of the
conversations.
"The committee should not have to perform
its legislative missions on the basis of transcripts

that are suspect," said the memorandum to the
court."The public facts demonstrate that the
edited versions provided the public are neither
complete nor accurate."
The tapes the Senate committee seeks in its
second trip to the appeals court are of Nixon
conversations of Sept. 15, 1972, Feb. 28, March
13 and two on March 21,1973.
In related developments, Court action on 64
presidential tapes was postponed yesterday,
indicating an accommodation may be in the
works to avoid a court fight between the White
House and the special Watergate prosecutor.
The five-day postponement was on a hearing
on a White House motion to quash a subpoena
for the tapes. U.S. District Court Judge John J.
Sirica moved the hearing from tomorrow to
Monday.
"The continuance was granted for the
purpose of facilitating discussions leading to
possible compliance with the subpoena," the
judge said.
White House counsel James D. St. Clair said
he had asked for the extra five days "to permit
the special prosecutor and myself to see whether
we can come to some accommodation."
In his motion last week to halt the subpoena
St. Clair had indicated that the fight might be
carried to the Supreme Court.
The judge's announcement indicated there is
a possibility an agreement can be worked out to
avoid a fight similar to last year when the White
House went to the U.S. Court of Appeals to
avoid yielding other subpoenaed tapes.
Jaworski said the tapes are needed for the
Sept. 9 trial of Colson, John N. Mitchell, H.R.
Haldeman, John D. Ehrlichman, Robert
Mardian, Kenneth W. Parkinson and Gordon
Strachan.
All are charged with conspiracy to obstruct
justice in covering up the 1972 break-in of
Democratic headquarters in the Watergate
complex.
Mitchell, Colson and Mardian supported
Jaworski's demand for the tapes.
Reinecke Trial Date Set
SACRAMENTO — Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke's
perjury trial was set yesterday for July 15, a full
six weeks after the California primary in which
he is running for the Republican nomination for
governor.
But Reinecke called the date "just a
technicality" and added, "We're going to fight
very hard to get that trial advanced" to before
the June 4 primary.
In an interview, Reinecke said he will appear
next Monday before U.S. District Judge
Barrington Parker, in Washington, D.C., on
motions to drop the charges or move the trial to
California.
If Judge Parker grants a change of venue
Monday, the trial could be set sooner in another
court, he said. "If it is not granted Monday, we
will appeal," Reinecke said.
He added that an appeal would also increase
the chances of an earlier trial date because that
would move the matter into another court and
"this has become a hot potato."
Reinecke was indicted by a Watergate grand
jury April 3 on three counts of lying to a Senate
committee about International Telephone &

Telegraph Corp's $400,000 offer to help
underwrite the 1972 Republican National
Convention.
He pleaded innocent to all three counts and
declared that the indictments were politically
motivated.
Kissinger, Gromyko To Confer
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A.
Gromyko scheduled a surprise meeting today on
the island of Cyprus to discuss an end to the
Middle East fighting.
Ambassador-at-large Robert J. McCloskey,
with the Kissinger party, said the secretary and
Gromyko also would confer on other East-West
topics, including chances for a new treaty
limiting offensive nuclear weapons.
U.S. officials dismissed suggestions that the
American and Soviet foreign ministers might
have intentions of imposing a pact on Israel and
Syria. McCloskey asserted that the meeting has
the "full understanding and approval of the
government of Israel."
Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban said after
conferring with Kissinger: "We have no reason —
so far — to think we will suffer."
He confirmed that the Israelis were notified
in advance about the Gromyko meeting, and
had received an outline of what Kissinger
intended to discuss with the foreign minister.
As the Cyprus meeting was announced,
Kissinger started a new round of negotiations
with Israeli leaders.
Kissinger is to return tonight, confer with
Israeli officials and fly to Damascus tomorrow.
Premier Golda Meir's government faced
mounting opposition yesterday to any
separation of forces pact with Syria that would
pull Israeli troops behind the 1967 cease-fire
line.
University professors and writers went on a
hunger strike, and demonstrators berated the
government, Kissinger and President Nixon in a
protest outside the U.S. Embassy. Parliament
called a special session today for debate on the
negotiations.
Kennedy To Seek Presidency?
WASHINGTON - Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., said yesterday he would like to be
president and is giving some consideration to
running in 1976.
He said that by late next year, and possibly
earlier, "I'll make a definitive kind of a decision
about my plans."
Kennedy, one of whose brothers was
assassinated while president and another while
running for president, said members of his
family will not have a veto over his decision.
"No, they won't," he said in response to a
question. "And they've indicated were I to
make a judgment to run that they would
support me."
Kennedy was interviewed on Washington
Straight Talk, a national public affairs
broadcasting program, by Paul Duke.
"Which way are you leaning at this
moment?" Kennedy was asked.
"If I was asked today, I'd just run for
re-election to the Senate," he replied.
"Would you, deep down, like to be

President?"
"Yes."
Senate Cuts Vietnam Military Aid
WASHINGTON - The Senate voted
yesterday to cut off military aid shipments to
South Vietnam for the next two months.
An amendment by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., to deny an additional $266 million for
ammunition and aircraft replacement was
approved by a 43-38 roll call vote.
The Kennedy amendment would require the
Pentagon to stay within the $1,126 billion
South Vietnam military aid ceiling voted by
Congress last year. It is subject to House
concurrence.
The administration asked to increase the
ceiling to $1.6 billion, but the request was voted
down by the House and the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
The Senate committee, however, approved a
bookkeeping transaction that would have made
$266 million more available.
The committee called it an error to have
charged the 1974 budget for ammunition and
supplies actually delivered in 1972 and 1973.
Jury Hears Zebra Evidence
SAN FRANCISCO — A grand jury heard
three hours of evidence last night against three
men accused of "Zebra" street slayings and
scheduled another session for tonight.
"I have no comment about the case or the
witnesses," said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Walter
Giubbini after the session.
Giubbini said he would continue his
presentation today and possibly into tomorrow
night. Indictments traditionally have been
returned on Thursday.
Newsmen were not permitted in tightly
guarded City Hall where the 19 jurors heard the
case, but five witnesses were seen entering the
building.
Only one — a young black miniskirted
woman who covered her head with a jacket —
came escorted with officers. The others included
a young Oriental woman and three white men.
A key grand jury witness was expected to be
an informer who provided Alioto with
information that led to the arrests of seven
black men last Wednesday. Four later were
released for lack of evidence.
The three charged with murder are Larry
Green, 22, Manuel Moore, 29, and J.C. Simon,
29, all workers at a Black Muslim self-help store.
They will appear in court Thursday to enter a
plea.
The leader of the San Francisco Bay area's
Black Muslims told a public meeting Sunday
that the mayor's source was a former mental
patient. Identifying the man by name, Minister
John Muhammad termed the informer a
"crackpot" and "a man who has a mental
problem."
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today except fog and low
overcast near coast extending inland night and
morning. Slightly cooler days. Lows in mid 40s
to low 50s. High tomorrow in mid to upper 50s
near the ocean and in the 60s to low 70s inland.
Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph in afternoons.
