# Kalmbach: $2 Million Contribution
## Nixon Linked To Dairy Pledge? 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Herbert L.
Kalmbach has testified of a midnight
meeting at which he said a top dairy
cooperative official was told that milk
prices would be increased and that the
White House wanted confirmation of a
$2 million campaign pledge, according
to informed sources.
Kalmbach, a former campaign
fund-raiser for President Nixon, said in
the secret testimony that the session
took place on March 24, 1971, in his
suite at the Madison Hotel, the sources
said.
Milk price supports were increased
the following day.
The White House has said that
Nixon's milk price order was not

influenced by the promise of campaign
contributions from the cooperative, an
organization of dairy farmers.
Ehrlichman Involved
The alleged meeting, which took
place after a Republican fund-raising
dinner attended by dozens of dairy
cooperative officials, included
Kalmbach, Murray M. Chotiner and
Harold S. Nelson, according to the
Kalmbach testimony.
Chotiner had quit three weeks
earlier as President Nixon's special
counsel, and had just entered private
law practice, where he was receiving a
retainer of $57,000 a year paid by the
nation's largest dairy cooperative,
Associated Milk Producers Inc. Nelson
was the chief executive officer of the
cooperative.
According to the sources,
Kalmbach swore that Chotiner told
Nelson that John D. Ehrlichman, who
was Nixon's chief domestic adviser,
wanted Nelson to reaffirm the milk
producers' promise of $2 million in
light of a milk-price increase that the
President had just ordered. Kalmbach
said Nelson agreed, the sources said.
The next day the administration
made its public announcement of the
price increase of 27 cents per
hundredweight, which added hundreds
of millions of dollars to the income of
dairy farmers.
Committee Letter
Kalmbach's testimony was given
about six weeks ago to two
investigators for the Senate Watergate
committee, Alan Weitz and David
Dorsen, according to the sources.
They said this testimony, along
with other unspecified evidence
provides the basis for a letter which
lawyers for the House Judiciary
Committee sent to the White House
April 19.
That letter, intended to state facts
showing the impeachment
investigators' need for 45 presidential
tape recordings about the milk-fund
affair, was made public Friday.

It said, among other things, that on
March 24, 1971, "Mr. Chotiner stated
to several dairymen that Mr.
Ehrlichman expected the dairy
industry to reaffirm its $2-million
'commitment' in light of a
forthcoming increase in milk price
supports."
Democratic Pressure?
The White House has said that
President Nixon was aware of the
dairymen's $2-million promise,
because his aide Charles Colson had
told him about it in 1970. Colson has
been identified as the main contact in
the White House for Nelson and other
dairy cooperative officials.
The White House has denied that
Nixon's decision to raise prices was
influenced by this promise of money.
He was influenced by "traditional
political considerations" including
pressure from Democrats in Congress
who wanted a price increase, the White
House said.
After this time, several references
to a "commitment" show up in
material already discovered in
milk-fund probes.
Meanwhile, CBS-TV News said
yesterday that documents on file in
federal court indicate the late
President Lyndon B. Johnson, almost
four years after leaving the White
House, reminded Texas dairy
producers of a $250,000
"commitment" to him.
CBS News correspondent Daniel
Schorr said officials of the Associated
Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI), suggested
the commitment was in return for
Johnson administration decisions to
raise price supports and lower import
quotas.
CBS quoted AMPI General Manager
George Mehren as saying Johnson later
insisted on continuing the lease to
supplement his retirement income.
