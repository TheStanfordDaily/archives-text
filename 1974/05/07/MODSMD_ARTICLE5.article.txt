# Fewer Students Placed By Draw
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Results from round one of the
housing draw were distributed
yesterday, with fewer students being
assigned than last year, despite an
increase in total number of spaces in
the draw.
Only 2005 students received
on-campus assignments in round one,
compared to 2038 last year.
All students wanting on-campus
housing in the draw must participate
in round two. Response cards are due
on Thursday, even if the students are
satisfied with their round one
assignment.
Cutoffs for round one assignment
were set at 2403 for men and 3043 for
women, down from last year's figures
of 2485 and 3297. Larry Horton,
associate dean of student affairs for
residential education, said students
unassigned in round one should remain
calm.
"It is important for people who are
unassigned not to panic at this point,"
Horton said.
Cutoffs Higher
Round two cutoffs are higher than
those for round one because many
students drop out of the draw after
round one to join fraternities or for
other reasons. Also, 474 spaces were
left vacant in Manzanita Park and
Mirrielees apartments after housing
officials tabulated the results.
'There is a chance that someone
would have a better opportunity to get
into Manzanita or Mirrielees," Horton
related. "Of course, if everyone did
that, this wouldn't be true."
Horton suggested to students, "put
down your choices in the order you
want them. In order to maximize your
opportunity, you check the box saying
'assign me to any spot available,'"
Horton explained.
Housing officials will sponsor a

meeting for persons unassigned after
round two when results are posted.
Those students will receive a packet of
materials outlining their alternatives
for housing in the area.
Horton claimed the draw was
effective in providing students with
housing they desire.
"About 60 percent of the people
who are assigned get their first choice
for housing, we have found," Horton
stated.
Chances Reduced
Horton admitted that the policy of
giving preference to students
unassigned two years in a row in the
draw does reduce the chances of other
students trying to get housing.
"When you're dealing with a
housing shortage — a scarce
commodity — [and] you give
priorities to one group, another always
suffers as a result," he said.
Though Delt House is being
returned to the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity and Hurlburt House will be
replaced with the house at 584
May field Ave., the total number of
spaces in the draw will go up.
Different Distribution
The total number of spaces for
on-campus housing will not increase,
said David Bell, assistant dean of
student affairs. However, the spaces
will be distributed differently so that
more are available in the spring draw,
he added.
He said that the housing office
regularly assigns a certain number of
spaces in the fall to house managers
and residence assistants.
Next year, the housing office will
hold fewer spaces open for f.dl
assignment and thus increase the
number of housing spaces in the draw,
Bell said.
"It's just a question of when the
spaces are assigned," Bell remarked.

more are available in the spring draw,
he added.
He said that the housing office
regularly assigns a certain number of
spaces in the fall to house managers
and residence assistants.
Next year, the housing office will
hold fewer spaces open for f.dl
assignment and thus increase the
number of housing spaces in the draw,
Bell said.
"It's just a question of when the
spaces are assigned," Bell remarked.
Results from round one of the
housing draw were distributed
yesterday, with fewer students being
assigned than last year, despite an
increase in total number of spaces in
the draw.
Only 2005 students received
on-campus assignments in round one,
compared to 2038 last year.
All students wanting on-campus
housing in the draw must participate
in round two. Response cards are due
on Thursday, even if the students are
satisfied with their round one
assignment.
Cutoffs for round one assignment
were set at 2403 for men and 3043 for
women, down from last year's figures
of 2485 and 3297. Larry Horton,
associate dean of student affairs for
residential education, said students
unassigned in round one should remain
calm.
"It is important for people who are
unassigned not to panic at this point,"
Horton said.
Cutoffs Higher
Round two cutoffs are higher than
those for round one because many
students drop out of the draw after
round one to join fraternities or for
other reasons. Also, 474 spaces were
left vacant in Manzanita Park and
Mirrielees apartments after housing
officials tabulated the results.
'There is a chance that someone
would have a better opportunity to get
into Manzanita or Mirrielees," Horton
related. "Of course, if everyone did
that, this wouldn't be true."
Horton suggested to students, "put
down your choices in the order you
want them. In order to maximize your
opportunity, you check the box saying
'assign me to any spot available,'"
Horton explained.
Housing officials will sponsor a

meeting for persons unassigned after
round two when results are posted.
Those students will receive a packet of
materials outlining their alternatives
for housing in the area.
Horton claimed the draw was
effective in providing students with
housing they desire.
"About 60 percent of the people
who are assigned get their first choice
for housing, we have found," Horton
stated.
Chances Reduced
Horton admitted that the policy of
giving preference to students
unassigned two years in a row in the
draw does reduce the chances of other
students trying to get housing.
"When you're dealing with a
housing shortage — a scarce
commodity — [and] you give
priorities to one group, another always
suffers as a result," he said.
Though Delt House is being
returned to the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity and Hurlburt House will be
replaced with the house at 584
May field Ave., the total number of
spaces in the draw will go up.
Different Distribution
The total number of spaces for
on-campus housing will not increase,
said David Bell, assistant dean of
student affairs. However, the spaces
will be distributed differently so that
more are available in the spring draw,
he added.
