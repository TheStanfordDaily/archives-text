# Gibbs Tells Policy Boards
## SWOPSI, SCIRE Funding Unsure 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs told the
SWOPSI and SCIRE policy boards last week his office can
no longer fund their programs at current levels, the Daily
has learned.
But Gibbs has promised to raise enough money — from
University or non-University sources — to fund the
programs "close to the levels they requested," he said
yesterday.
The student-initiated academic programs submitted their
budget requests for next year on April 15, SWOPSI
Director Dan Lewis said. SWOPSI asked for $32,000, an
"inflationary" increase over this year's $25,000 budget,
Lewis said. SCIRE, which was not in full operation this
year, requested $24,000.
Last week, Gibbs told the policy boards his office could
supply only $25,000 for the two programs.
In recent years, the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies (ODUS) has supplied some $60,000 annually to the
two programs. Of that, $25,000 has come from the
University's general funds, the remainder from ODUS
reserves.
Reserves Shrink
According to Lewis, Gibbs told the policy boards his
reserves have "shrunken substantially" and can no longer
provide money to the programs.
"I have three questions," Lewis said yesterday. "Why are
we hearing about this on May 1? What is the dean spending

money on in his office that's more important or more
successful than these extradepartmental programs? And,
finally, is he serious — because three months isn't enough
time for us to get the funding we need to do a good job."
"It's just that SWOPSI and SCIRE are low priority for
the dean's reserves," Lewis said. "The people who are going
to get screwed are going to be the students, if there's 110
SWOPSI next year."
'Boards Pessimistic'
Gibbs believes the policy boards are unduly pessimistic.
"The problem is that the programs are not used to dealing
with any financial uncertainty," he said. "If they don't see
the money there, they think they're the ones who are going
to be screwed."
Gibbs is confident he can raise enough money to keep
the programs going. "I'm making a promise that my office
will obtain funding for the programs close to the levels they
have requested, and that 111 work with the provost's and
general secretary's offices to do that," he said.
"I will work hard to fill the gap," Gibbs continued.
"There has to be a little faith 01 the part of the programs. I
don't make this kind of promise lightly."
Gibbs said he could not have notified the policy boards
of their budget problem sooner. "We didn't know
ourselves," he said. "It didn't become clear until around the
end of March.
"Part of the problem was that it took the SCIRE Policy
Board so long to decide what they wanted to do."
