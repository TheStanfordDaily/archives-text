# Millionaire Seeks Congressional Seat
## Knapp Says McCloskey Vulnerable 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Millionaire businessman J. Gordon Knapp
says he has a chance of upsetting Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park, in the June 4
Republican primary in the 12th Congressional
District, which includes Stanford.
His assertion might appear typical of the
hyperbolic campaign rhetoric that characterizes
political campaigns if it were not for the fact
that McCloskey claims he agrees with Knapp.
"I would not be in this race if I did not
believe that I have a serious chance I could
win," Knapp told the Daily last month.
Knapp, 52, is president and majority
stockholder of the American Beverage Corp. of
Menlo Park, which manufactures Calso and
Quintonic. He has accumulated a fortune
estimated at $2.6 million and claims that his
business expertise will attract votes.
According to Knapp, McCloskey has failed to
respond to the needs of his constituents.
McCloskey has spent too much effort attacking
the policies of President Nixon and too little
time responding to the needs of the voters of
the district, Knapp claims.
Inflation
Chris Hocker, Knapp's press secretary, told
the Daily last week that Knapp believes the
main issue of the campaign is inflation. Knapp
insists that his business expertise has
familiarized him with economics, enabling him
to grapple with fiscal problems better than

McCloskey.
Like McCloskey, Knapp favors a balanced
budget as the best means to curb inflation.
Unlike McCloskey, he is a strong opponent of
wage and price controls. Knapp is also
emphasizing the need for tax reduction more
than McCloskey, according to Hocker.
Although Knapp says he is more wary of cuts
in the defense budget than McCloskey, he is a
proponent of the volunteer army, unlike
McCloskey, who has expressed reservations
about ending the draft.
According to Hocker, the two candidates also
differ on the issue of capital punishment. Knapp
favors the imposition of the death penalty for
certain crimes.
Knapp has frequently criticized McCloskey
for his opposition to the Alaska Pipeline,
claiming that McCloskey's position would
aggravate the energy crisis without necessarily
benefiting the environment.
Hocker noted that Knapp favors conservation
efforts but believes that unless industrial
expansion can be proven to endanger the
environment, there is no reason to prevent it.
Knapp believes that cases involving a trade-off
between concern for the environment and
industrial expansion should be considered on an
individual basis, according to Hocker.
In 1971, Knapp donated 456 acres of land
adjoining the south end of the Bay to the
Nature Conservatory, saying that he was

motivated by an interest in conservation. The
land will someday be part of the parks bordering
the Bay and assure protection of many species
of wildlife for future generations.
Impeachment
Knapp differs sharply from McCloskey on
impeachment. Knapp has criticized McCloskey's
advocacy of impeachment, insisting that
sufficient grounds do not yet exist to assume
that Nixon is guilty of an impeachable offense.
"I have not yet seen enough evidence to
convince me that Nixon should be impeached,"
Knapp told the Daily.
Although Knapp said Vice President Gerald
Ford would make a good president, he
emphasized that he expects Nixon to complete
his term of office.
According to Hocker, Knapp will benefit
from the recent reapportionment of the
congressional districts on the peninsula, which
brought a large number of "conservative" voters
into McCloskey's district.
Reapportionment
Knapp designed a reapportionment plan for
the area that was largely the basis for the State
Assembly's eventual reapportionment of the
district.
Knapp believes that one of his main problems
at the present time is lack of name recognition.
Although he won nine percent of the votes as a
write-in candidate in the 1972 general election,

he says that he is directing his campaign toward
establishment of name recognition among voters
in the district.
Hocker said Knapp is conducting
"walk-about tours" in 110 of the district's 500
precincts. He noted that the districts in which
Knapp is campaigning were carefully chosen as
districts in which "there existed a lot of latent
pro-Knapp sentiment."
Television spots have been ruled out because
they are too expensive, Hocker stated. The
Knapp campaign does not plan to use gimmicks
to attract voters, he stated. "We are running an
issue-oriented campaign."
Knapp, a 1943 Stanford graduate, has not
yet planned any visits to the Stanford campus,
Hocker said. But Knapp may appear here before
the end of the campaign, he added.
Debates
Although Knapp refused to agree to
McCloskey's proposal for 100 debates, the two
candidates will appear together approximately
20 times during the course of the campaign,
Hocker noted.
McCloskey's plan for 100 debates was
presented after Knapp had already planned his
campaign, he said. Knapp's acceptance of the
offer would have disrupted carefully laid plans,
Hocker explained.
Knapp does not believe that Watergate would
hurt him in the general election if he were
nominated.
"The Republican Party is not guilty of
Watergate," Knapp told the Daily. He
acknowledged that the scandal might cause a
reaction against Republican candidates "in
certain electoral pockets" but he said that he is
still confident that he could win the November
election if nominated.

McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park, in the June 4
Republican primary in the 12th Congressional
District, which includes Stanford.
His assertion might appear typical of the
hyperbolic campaign rhetoric that characterizes
political campaigns if it were not for the fact
that McCloskey claims he agrees with Knapp.
"I would not be in this race if I did not
believe that I have a serious chance I could
win," Knapp told the Daily last month.
Knapp, 52, is president and majority
stockholder of the American Beverage Corp. of
Menlo Park, which manufactures Calso and
Quintonic. He has accumulated a fortune
estimated at $2.6 million and claims that his
business expertise will attract votes.
According to Knapp, McCloskey has failed to
respond to the needs of his constituents.
McCloskey has spent too much effort attacking
the policies of President Nixon and too little
time responding to the needs of the voters of
the district, Knapp claims.
Inflation
Chris Hocker, Knapp's press secretary, told
the Daily last week that Knapp believes the
main issue of the campaign is inflation. Knapp
insists that his business expertise has
familiarized him with economics, enabling him
to grapple with fiscal problems better than

McCloskey.
Like McCloskey, Knapp favors a balanced
budget as the best means to curb inflation.
Unlike McCloskey, he is a strong opponent of
wage and price controls. Knapp is also
emphasizing the need for tax reduction more
than McCloskey, according to Hocker.
Although Knapp says he is more wary of cuts
in the defense budget than McCloskey, he is a
proponent of the volunteer army, unlike
McCloskey, who has expressed reservations
about ending the draft.
According to Hocker, the two candidates also
differ on the issue of capital punishment. Knapp
favors the imposition of the death penalty for
certain crimes.
Knapp has frequently criticized McCloskey
for his opposition to the Alaska Pipeline,
claiming that McCloskey's position would
aggravate the energy crisis without necessarily
benefiting the environment.
Hocker noted that Knapp favors conservation
efforts but believes that unless industrial
expansion can be proven to endanger the
environment, there is no reason to prevent it.
Knapp believes that cases involving a trade-off
between concern for the environment and
industrial expansion should be considered on an
individual basis, according to Hocker.
In 1971, Knapp donated 456 acres of land
adjoining the south end of the Bay to the
Nature Conservatory, saying that he was

motivated by an interest in conservation. The
land will someday be part of the parks bordering
the Bay and assure protection of many species
of wildlife for future generations.
Impeachment
Knapp differs sharply from McCloskey on
impeachment. Knapp has criticized McCloskey's
advocacy of impeachment, insisting that
sufficient grounds do not yet exist to assume
that Nixon is guilty of an impeachable offense.
"I have not yet seen enough evidence to
convince me that Nixon should be impeached,"
Knapp told the Daily.
Although Knapp said Vice President Gerald
Ford would make a good president, he
emphasized that he expects Nixon to complete
his term of office.
According to Hocker, Knapp will benefit
from the recent reapportionment of the
congressional districts on the peninsula, which
brought a large number of "conservative" voters
into McCloskey's district.
Reapportionment
Knapp designed a reapportionment plan for
the area that was largely the basis for the State
Assembly's eventual reapportionment of the
district.
Knapp believes that one of his main problems
at the present time is lack of name recognition.
Although he won nine percent of the votes as a
write-in candidate in the 1972 general election,

J. GORDON KNAPP
he says that he is directing his campaign toward
establishment of name recognition among voters
in the district.
Hocker said Knapp is conducting
"walk-about tours" in 110 of the district's 500
precincts. He noted that the districts in which
Knapp is campaigning were carefully chosen as
districts in which "there existed a lot of latent
pro-Knapp sentiment."
Television spots have been ruled out because
they are too expensive, Hocker stated. The
Knapp campaign does not plan to use gimmicks
to attract voters, he stated. "We are running an
issue-oriented campaign."
Knapp, a 1943 Stanford graduate, has not
yet planned any visits to the Stanford campus,
Hocker said. But Knapp may appear here before
the end of the campaign, he added.
Debates
Although Knapp refused to agree to
McCloskey's proposal for 100 debates, the two
candidates will appear together approximately
20 times during the course of the campaign,
Hocker noted.
McCloskey's plan for 100 debates was
presented after Knapp had already planned his
campaign, he said. Knapp's acceptance of the
offer would have disrupted carefully laid plans,
Hocker explained.
Knapp does not believe that Watergate would
hurt him in the general election if he were
nominated.
"The Republican Party is not guilty of
Watergate," Knapp told the Daily. He
acknowledged that the scandal might cause a
reaction against Republican candidates "in
certain electoral pockets" but he said that he is
still confident that he could win the November
election if nominated.

Republican primary in the 12th Congressional
District, which includes Stanford.
His assertion might appear typical of the
hyperbolic campaign rhetoric that characterizes
political campaigns if it were not for the fact
that McCloskey claims he agrees with Knapp.
"I would not be in this race if I did not
believe that I have a serious chance I could
win," Knapp told the Daily last month.
Knapp, 52, is president and majority
stockholder of the American Beverage Corp. of
Menlo Park, which manufactures Calso and
Quintonic. He has accumulated a fortune
estimated at $2.6 million and claims that his
business expertise will attract votes.
According to Knapp, McCloskey has failed to
respond to the needs of his constituents.
McCloskey has spent too much effort attacking
the policies of President Nixon and too little
time responding to the needs of the voters of
the district, Knapp claims.
Inflation
Chris Hocker, Knapp's press secretary, told
the Daily last week that Knapp believes the
main issue of the campaign is inflation. Knapp
insists that his business expertise has
familiarized him with economics, enabling him
to grapple with fiscal problems better than

McCloskey.
Like McCloskey, Knapp favors a balanced
budget as the best means to curb inflation.
Unlike McCloskey, he is a strong opponent of
wage and price controls. Knapp is also
emphasizing the need for tax reduction more
than McCloskey, according to Hocker.
Although Knapp says he is more wary of cuts
in the defense budget than McCloskey, he is a
proponent of the volunteer army, unlike
McCloskey, who has expressed reservations
about ending the draft.
According to Hocker, the two candidates also
differ on the issue of capital punishment. Knapp
favors the imposition of the death penalty for
certain crimes.
Knapp has frequently criticized McCloskey
for his opposition to the Alaska Pipeline,
claiming that McCloskey's position would
aggravate the energy crisis without necessarily
benefiting the environment.
Hocker noted that Knapp favors conservation
efforts but believes that unless industrial
expansion can be proven to endanger the
environment, there is no reason to prevent it.
Knapp believes that cases involving a trade-off
between concern for the environment and
industrial expansion should be considered on an
individual basis, according to Hocker.
In 1971, Knapp donated 456 acres of land
adjoining the south end of the Bay to the
Nature Conservatory, saying that he was

motivated by an interest in conservation. The
land will someday be part of the parks bordering
the Bay and assure protection of many species
of wildlife for future generations.
Impeachment
Knapp differs sharply from McCloskey on
impeachment. Knapp has criticized McCloskey's
advocacy of impeachment, insisting that
sufficient grounds do not yet exist to assume
that Nixon is guilty of an impeachable offense.
"I have not yet seen enough evidence to
convince me that Nixon should be impeached,"
Knapp told the Daily.
Although Knapp said Vice President Gerald
Ford would make a good president, he
emphasized that he expects Nixon to complete
his term of office.
According to Hocker, Knapp will benefit
from the recent reapportionment of the
congressional districts on the peninsula, which
brought a large number of "conservative" voters
into McCloskey's district.
Reapportionment
Knapp designed a reapportionment plan for
the area that was largely the basis for the State
Assembly's eventual reapportionment of the
district.
Knapp believes that one of his main problems
at the present time is lack of name recognition.
Although he won nine percent of the votes as a
write-in candidate in the 1972 general election,

he says that he is directing his campaign toward
establishment of name recognition among voters
in the district.
Hocker said Knapp is conducting
"walk-about tours" in 110 of the district's 500
precincts. He noted that the districts in which
Knapp is campaigning were carefully chosen as
districts in which "there existed a lot of latent
pro-Knapp sentiment."
Television spots have been ruled out because
they are too expensive, Hocker stated. The
Knapp campaign does not plan to use gimmicks
to attract voters, he stated. "We are running an
issue-oriented campaign."
Knapp, a 1943 Stanford graduate, has not
yet planned any visits to the Stanford campus,
Hocker said. But Knapp may appear here before
the end of the campaign, he added.
Debates
Although Knapp refused to agree to
McCloskey's proposal for 100 debates, the two
candidates will appear together approximately
20 times during the course of the campaign,
Hocker noted.
McCloskey's plan for 100 debates was
presented after Knapp had already planned his
campaign, he said. Knapp's acceptance of the
offer would have disrupted carefully laid plans,
Hocker explained.
Knapp does not believe that Watergate would
hurt him in the general election if he were
nominated.
"The Republican Party is not guilty of
Watergate," Knapp told the Daily. He
acknowledged that the scandal might cause a
reaction against Republican candidates "in
certain electoral pockets" but he said that he is
still confident that he could win the November
election if nominated.
