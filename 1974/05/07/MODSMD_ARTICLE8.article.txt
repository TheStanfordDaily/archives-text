# Solitary Strike

John Newcomb

I have been a Stanford worker
for well over twelve years and I
used to love this place. The esprit
de corps of my fellow workers
was a wondrous thing to me when
I first came to Stanford. People
cared about each other. We even
had a vice president (Alf Brandon)
who made a sincere effort to
know us personally and to
understand our problems.
I know the campus situation
would be a lot different if he were
still with us. Vice President for
Business and Finance, Robert
Augsburger, is only a name to me
— a name without a face, without
feelings or human values — just
one more cog in the insatiable
economic machine that is
snowballing (and snowjobbing) us
all to destruction.
Administrators can't help being
what they are. They've been
programmed that way just like a
normal man who was thought to
be mentally retarded as a child
and therefore raised in an
institution. He couldn't
communicate with people
considered normal any better than
administrators can communicate
with workers.
It seems that 95 percent of us
do about five percent of our own
thinking and most of our actions
and reactions are predictable.
Stanford didn't have to have a
union. The dissatisfaction of
workers was visible years ago. As
one poet asked, "How many times
can a man turn his head,
pretending he just doesn't see?"
Stanford has financial
problems with rising costs, over
most of which they have little or
no control. The price of pencils
goes up and they have to pay it.
The price of fuel and power goes
up and they have to pay it. The
cost of construction labor goes up
and they pay that too and keep
on building more buildings with
fewer people to maintain them.
But they do have control over
the cost of their own labor force
and this is where they take up the
slack. It* seems to me that if
Stanford can't afford to pay their
workers enough to keep up with
the rising cost of living that they

can't really afford to stay in
business.
Why are you letting it happen,
mighty Stanford? Why don't you
"clean up your act?" Why can't
you really be an example to the
world of what a great university
should and can be? All you have
to do is show people that you
really care.
I have the feeling that
administrators think the workers
of Stanford are some kind of
inferior beings like beasts of
burden that must be pacified and
kept in line as cheaply as possible.
If that's the way it is, then I don't
want to work here anymore.
A university is made up of
faculty, students, administrators
and workers, and we're all
necessary to keep it going. I don't
begrudge President Lyman his
Mercedes, but I do want to keep
my little Toyota going so I can
haul my cans to the recycling
center even if Stanford doesn't
care about theirs. Isn't it strange
that Stanford with all its wisdom
can't do what's right because it's
not economically feasible — but I
can?
Whether USE got the
two-thirds vote it needs to go on
strike or not, I am withdrawing
from the union and going on
strike alone.
I am philosophically opposed
to unions and all pressure groups
and I feel as if I am caught up in
some kind of crazy game that I
have had no control over but I'm
ready to retake control over
myself.
To you, Augsburger, I lay my
job on the line. If you want me to
continue working at Stanford,
come and convince me that I
should — eyeball to eyeball — you
don't need an appointment. If I'm
only a faceless name that has no
worth to you, forget it, but you'll
have to live with the knowledge
that there was once a man who
challenged you to a very simple
thing and you didn't have the
courtesy to meet it.
