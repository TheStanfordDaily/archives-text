# A 						Chinese View

I appreciate Linda Crouse's
efforts in pointing out China's
achievements in her article (Daily,
April 29). However, as a Chinese
person who is concerned about
the population problem, I feel
that she has misunderstood both
China's population policy and the
concerns of population control
advocates.
China's view on her shooting
population growth can best be
evaluated on the basis of her
actions. Which government is
willing to publicly admit trouble
at home? Right now, China has
discouraged early marriages to the
extent of holding them as social
misdoings. The same attitude
applies to families with more than
two children. The government has
provided free contraceptives in
China.
But moreover, one of the main
duties of the barefoot doctors
they have trained is to pleasantly
ensure that his female clients take
the pill every day.
Therefore without an official
proclamation, China has quietly
made birth control more or less
compulsory... at least where
there are barefoot doctors. A
country would not expand all this
energy had she not thought
population growth a prime
problem and a "negative factor."
As early as 1957, in the famous

speech "On the Correct Handling
of Contraceptives among the
People," Mao realized that food
production can never catch up if
the population was allowed to
grow unrestrained. Only 10
percent of China's land is tilled
because only 10 percent can be
cultivated at a reasonable expense.
China is a very mountainous
country.
China may export food but it
is more of a trade-off. She imports
food from other countries (wheat
from Canada, and recently from
the U.S.) and exports high quality
rice and other foodstuff and thus
makes a profitable foreign
exchange.
An effective, powerful and
strong government is definitely
essential to a country of large
population, but no amount of
management can produce more
food than is physically possible.
Just as a final sobering
thought, there are two estimates
for China's population — one
from Peking and one from Hong
Kong — and their figures differ by
about 100,000,000 people (half
the U.S. population). As a Chinese
person, I don't find that any more
comforting — and I think the
Chinese Government feels the
same.

the pill every day.
Therefore without an official
proclamation, China has quietly
made birth control more or less
compulsory... at least where
there are barefoot doctors. A
country would not expand all this
energy had she not thought
population growth a prime
problem and a "negative factor."
As early as 1957, in the famous

speech "On the Correct Handling
of Contraceptives among the
People," Mao realized that food
production can never catch up if
the population was allowed to
grow unrestrained. Only 10
percent of China's land is tilled
because only 10 percent can be
cultivated at a reasonable expense.
China is a very mountainous
country.
China may export food but it
is more of a trade-off. She imports
food from other countries (wheat
from Canada, and recently from
the U.S.) and exports high quality
rice and other foodstuff and thus
makes a profitable foreign
exchange.
An effective, powerful and
strong government is definitely
essential to a country of large
population, but no amount of
management can produce more
food than is physically possible.
Just as a final sobering
thought, there are two estimates
for China's population — one
from Peking and one from Hong
Kong — and their figures differ by
about 100,000,000 people (half
the U.S. population). As a Chinese
person, I don't find that any more
comforting — and I think the
Chinese Government feels the
same.
