-the film that ran for 3 continuous years in one theatre in Cambridge, Mass. |w
In an isolated surreal pocket of World War I, the British send Alan Bates into a highly unlikely, tiny French town to discover \ Tfj ,
a bomb. The townspeople have fled and the inmates of the local asylum have taken their place. The resulting interaction gives AJj J fa?
us some of the most enchanting sequences on film. When the reality of the returning armies breaks the bubble and the inmates i IIL
have returned to the asylum, we can really share Bates' confusion about which people are really insane In our opinion, KING yjMB
OF HEARTS is a rare treat; funny and sad at the same time Past audiences will vouch for this, and we know you will 100.
