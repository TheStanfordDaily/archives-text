WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon decided yesterday to turn over
no more Watergate tapes, thus risking
a constitutional showdown with
Congress on one hand and inviting a
Supreme Court test on the other.
White House lawyer James D. St.
Clair said the President had reviewed
special Watergate prosecutor Leon
aworski's subpoena for 64 tape
recordings and ordered St. Clair to
fight the demand to the Supreme
Court if necessary.
And, St. Clair said, the President
Afill not give more tapes to the House
Judiciary Committee for its
mpeachment inquiry.
"I do not believe it will be an
impeachable offense," St. Clair said.
Litigation Continues
A spokesman for Jaworski declined
comment other than to say "we plan
to ..-ontinue with our litigation."
There was no immediate reaction
from Judiciary Committee leaders.
A committee member, Rep. Tom
Railsback, R-111., called the
announcement "most unfortunate"
and added:
"This decision is certain to provide
a confrontation with the Judiciary
Committee, the end result of which
will certainly be bad for the country as
well as for the Republican party."
'Shabby Performance'
Before the latest refusal, Senate
Republican Leader Hugh Scott — in a
significant shift from his past support
af the President — said transcripts of
key Watergate conversations reveal "a
shabby, disgusting, immoral
performance" by all involved.
Scott declined to criticize Nixon
directly but made plain, in talking to
reporters and in a floor speech, "I am
not going to take any position
supporting any action which involved
any form of immorality or criminality
as the transcripts indicate."
