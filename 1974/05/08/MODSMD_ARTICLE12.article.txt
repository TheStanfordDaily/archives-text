# Economics Of Grad Student Walkout

On Friday, May 3, an article appeared in
the Daily headlined: "German Graduate
Students To Stage One-Day Walkout."
Although it relied heavily on quotes, the
quotes selected present a highly skewed
picture of the grievance in the department.
Since the "walkout" is not a strike but a
vehicle to publicize our problem, here is
some information.
The catalyst for the troubles between the
students and Dean Moses was a directive the
Dean sent to the chairman of German Studies
at the end of winter quarter. This order
prohibited students from teaching more than
six quarters during the four years of graduate
study for which support is provided.
Dean Moses apologized for "falling
asleep" in regards to the situation in the
department, where graduates had become
used to teaching three years. He said he
wanted to correct the situation in the interest
of the academic progress of the students.
Bad News For Some
For those graduates who had already
taught six quarters, the Dean's letter brought
bad news indeed. They were counting on the
$1050 difference between the basic support
level and a teaching fellowship. The idea of
"losing" that thousand dollars provoked a
series of meetings among the German
graduates which has extended into this
quarter.
Dean Moses will tolerate no plan with
more than $10,400 of fellowship support.
The $10,400 figure comes from the Fellows
Plan most vigorously pleaded by Associate
Dean Carlsmith.
The German graduate students conjecture
that Dean Moses' directive may have been
designed in part to make the Carlsmith
Fellows Plan look attractive to them. They
now are to teach six quarters and receive

$10,500 distributed over four years. In
contrast, the Fellows Plan — which advertises
an average three and one-half quarters of
teaching while providing only $100 less is
manifestly more appealing.
$217 Per Month
The rub with the Fellows Plan is in living
on $217 per month. Also, although the
Fellows Plan presents the three and one-half
quarters of teaching as an enticement, the
amount of teaching varies among
departments, depending on what is
pedagogically right for the average students.
(Dean Moses has already told the German
graduate students that the amount of
teaching pedagogically appropriate for them
might well be six quarters, if that is the
recommendation of the department.)
What is more, the Fellows Plan has the
stipulation that the student complete the
Ph.D. within four years — an absurdity in
certain of the programs where it has been
adopted, such as Comparative Literature.
Fellows Plan's Purpose
The purpose of the Fellows Plan is to
spread out a small amount of money (one
and one-half percent of the Operating
Budget) among as many graduate students as
possible. The evaporation of graduate
support monies from outside the University
made some such plan necessary.
A financial problem called the plan into
existence. However, the Fellows Plan is
commonly advocated on lines of making
good academic sense. It frees the student
from overmuch teaching — or more
accurately, from the temptation to teach
overly much, since teaching above the
prescribed amount is not rewarded with extra
money. It is also presented as sound
academics by disciplining would-be
malingerers into getting their Ph.D.'s in

whatever H& S department within four
years.
In trying to make the Fellows Plan work
well educationally, the deanery makes the
Plan do too much. Graduate students would
best be helped to concentrate on their
academic programs if they did not have to
seek paying work — teaching or something
else — to make ends meet. The support level
of the Fellows Plan does not relieve the
economic pinch most graduates find
themselves in.
Economic Measure
Instead of relieving economic pressure, it
increases academic pressure by demanding
that graduates finish in four years. The
Fellows Plan is an economic measure taken
by the University — and not a measure to
further good orderly scholarship.
A concluding (unscientific?) postscript:
Once already this year the German
Department has seen how an economic
problem was presented by the deanery as an
academic issue. An internationally acclaimed
scholar with a Marxist approach, John Flores,
was denied tenure by Dean Royden.
He cited insufficient scholarly work on
the part of Flores as the reason for
tenure denial. In light of John Flores'
scholarship and teaching, this does not make
sense.
What does make sense is that the
University is in a better position to appeal to
alumni and corporations for funds when
people like John Flores are not around
making waves. As long as the money was
flowing in abundantly, Stanford could afford
to be more liberal towards those with
unpopular views.
