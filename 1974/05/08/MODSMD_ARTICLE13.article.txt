# The 						Case For Balance In Education
## 
### 
Robert Cohn

Nancy Packer's proposals for
required courses in the humanities
send us back to an old drawing
board, as does Sidney Hook's
clarion call to the universities to
return to a core curriculum.
The latter strikes me as the
more serious appeal and perfectly
timed. Its rationale can be
summed up as follows:
Symbolic disciplines (math,
languages) are so basic to all
mental achievement that
everybody ought to be trained in
at least one of them up to a
decent level. This study represents
such a small fraction of a total
college program and is so essential
that it seems frivolous to
experiment on a vast scale, as we
have been doing, with alternatives
(including no such study at all).
Much the same argument applies
to English and history.
The case for required study in
the three areas is that it involves
and ideal of balance in education
quite parallel to "checks and
balances" in our government.
Conversely, the pursuit of any
one branch of knowledge
eventually becomes as one-sided,
inane and even dangerous as any
other "runaway" growth.
Premature Professionalism
Recent examples here: the
imbalance toward science,
technology and premature
professionalism. Lacking even
minimal built-in clientele, some
abandoned professors turn to
student-wooing as standards drop.
In all these contexts, a
university, like a church, needs
some equilibrium between the
vertical (individual) axis and its
horizontal (social, plural) axis.

At times, to be sure, as in
Plato's evolving republic, a phase
of relative anarchy, or
"balance-be-damned," seems
inevitable as the effects of
excessive 'human control are
purged. But we have just gone
through such a phase, lavishly. It
is high time we went on to a
rounded (some will say "square")
long-range posture of civilization.
No panacea, the core curriculum
is still one of the best gestures we
can make in this direction.
It can provide some steadying
sense of guidance and shape in a

loose era (and incidentally do
away with the curious and ironic
black market in student-provided
guidance which poured into the
vacuum); offer some minimal
ground of consensus, community
of discourse, in learning; and give
resistance, dialectically, to student
natural bents or talents,
sharpening them. Most
importantly, it brings the basic
symbolic and balancing values
mentioned earlier.
Some of my colleagues argue
that foreign language courses
should be considered among those

satisfying a humanities
requirement. Packer demurs.
This useless dilemma reminds
me of the anecdote Camus
recounts about the Nazi who gave
a mother a choice between which
of her two sons she preferred to
be executed. Why should we be
forced to choose one infinitely
valuable entity over another,
when the obvious sane and decent
solution is to make room for both
languages and advanced
humanities subjects in a core
curriculum?

guidance which poured into the
vacuum); offer some minimal
ground of consensus, community
of discourse, in learning; and give
resistance, dialectically, to student
natural bents or talents,
sharpening them. Most
importantly, it brings the basic
symbolic and balancing values
mentioned earlier.
Some of my colleagues argue
that foreign language courses
should be considered among those

satisfying a humanities
requirement. Packer demurs.
This useless dilemma reminds
me of the anecdote Camus
recounts about the Nazi who gave
a mother a choice between which
of her two sons she preferred to
be executed. Why should we be
forced to choose one infinitely
valuable entity over another,
when the obvious sane and decent
solution is to make room for both
languages and advanced
humanities subjects in a core
curriculum?

Robert Cohn

Nancy Packer's proposals for
required courses in the humanities
send us back to an old drawing
board, as does Sidney Hook's
clarion call to the universities to
return to a core curriculum.
The latter strikes me as the
more serious appeal and perfectly
timed. Its rationale can be
summed up as follows:
Symbolic disciplines (math,
languages) are so basic to all
mental achievement that
everybody ought to be trained in
at least one of them up to a
decent level. This study represents
such a small fraction of a total
college program and is so essential
that it seems frivolous to
experiment on a vast scale, as we
have been doing, with alternatives
(including no such study at all).
Much the same argument applies
to English and history.
The case for required study in
the three areas is that it involves
and ideal of balance in education
quite parallel to "checks and
balances" in our government.
Conversely, the pursuit of any
one branch of knowledge
eventually becomes as one-sided,
inane and even dangerous as any
other "runaway" growth.
Premature Professionalism
Recent examples here: the
imbalance toward science,
technology and premature
professionalism. Lacking even
minimal built-in clientele, some
abandoned professors turn to
student-wooing as standards drop.
In all these contexts, a
university, like a church, needs
some equilibrium between the
vertical (individual) axis and its
horizontal (social, plural) axis.

At times, to be sure, as in
Plato's evolving republic, a phase
of relative anarchy, or
"balance-be-damned," seems
inevitable as the effects of
excessive 'human control are
purged. But we have just gone
through such a phase, lavishly. It
is high time we went on to a
rounded (some will say "square")
long-range posture of civilization.
No panacea, the core curriculum
is still one of the best gestures we
can make in this direction.
It can provide some steadying
sense of guidance and shape in a

loose era (and incidentally do
away with the curious and ironic
black market in student-provided
guidance which poured into the
vacuum); offer some minimal
ground of consensus, community
of discourse, in learning; and give
resistance, dialectically, to student
natural bents or talents,
sharpening them. Most
