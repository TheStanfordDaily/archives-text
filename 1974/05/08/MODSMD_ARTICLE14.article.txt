# Nixon Role In Hunt Payoff

Prof. Horn seemed to be engaged in wishful
thinking when he said (Daily, May 3) that Nixon's
language concerning the pay-off to E. Howard Hunt
was "not direct and explicit." According to parts of
the transcript published in the San Francisco
Chronicle and the Wall Street Journal, the
following conversation took place:
Haldeman: "It's Hunt's opportunity."
Dean: "They're going to stonewall it, as it now
stands. Excepting Hunt. That's why his threat."
Nixon: "That's why for your immediate things
you have no choice but to come up with the
$120,000, or whatever it is. Right?"
Dean: "That's right."
Nixon: "Would you agree that that's the prime
thing, that you damn well better get that done?"
Dean: "Obviously he ought to be given some
signal anyway."
Nixon: (Expletive deleted), ". . . get it."
'Cap on Bottle'
On the same day, Nixon said to Dean:
.. don't you think you have to handle Hunt's

financial situation damn soon? .... It seems to me
we have to keep the cap on the bottle that much or
we don't have any options."
That night $75,000 was turned over to Hunt.
To an ordinary non-expert like me, these
exchanges seem chillingly explicit. And they are
consistent with other passages in which Nixon
encouraged the cover-up of the Watergate
investigation, intimidation of the press, and the
obstruction of justice.
Above all, the published portions of the
transcript show Nixon to be a man who would
willingly violate the law, the Constitution, and the
rules of ordinary human decency to save his own
skin or to punish an opponent.
The usually conservative Wall Street Journal
apparently found none of the ambiguity claimed by
Horn; it reported bluntly that "Nixon's
key defenses are shattered by release of the tape
transcripts."
