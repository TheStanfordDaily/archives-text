Photo IDs
Editor:
Having not heard any furth*
news or students opinions on tl<
subject of the Univer?
terminating the use of Photo 1
I wish to express my opinioi.
think it is a very foolish thing U
do. There are many clear
advantages to having Photo ID
and the alleged cost crisis '
funding the Photo IDs appeals
be someone's illusion.
The University IDs pro 1
instant identification for stuc
who make bank transactions
particularly those who
checks out of the area. Ma
not most banks and stores req
two forms of ID to cash a chec
personally do not have a crc
card which these stores w ;l
accept, but they always accept t,
Photo ID. I can imagine that the
are a lot of students who use tl
ID in a similar manner.
Beyond the usual use of Pho
IDs on campus — to attain acc<
to libraries and books, ID l
sporting events, ticket purchase a
the Box Office, etc. — the Foo.
Service uses it to be sure they ar
not overly ripped off. The Foo
Service has said they will have t
issue Photo IDs should th
University terminate their'
Carrying around two IDs soun .
to me redundant. No matter wh
puts out the Photo IDs we pay f<
it out of our pockets. If the Foe
Service needs the Photo ID an
the University needs any ID, wh
don't they share the cost of
single ID, with a photograph
it? Two institutions «
omnipresent as these should nc
fight against each other and us.
If you think so, let them knov

Editor:
We, the undersigned membe.
of organizations of students ani
faculty of Stanford Univesity
wish to express our strong suppor
for the striking RAs and TAs
the German Department. They
have led the way in fighting
Stanford on issues of important
to all students.
They are demanding that
graduate student teaching and
research be recognized as wo*J.
meriting adequate compensatioi
They are also demanding
recognition as employees of th'
University with the right t
organize and bargain about thei
conditions of employment.
The German Department
RA/TAs are in the forefront 112
the campaign to prevent tne
"rationalization" of graduate
studies. They are attacking
scheme which would level a
cheapen to a lowest common
denominator all graduate suppor'
programs. Because Stanford rel ;
on TAs for a portion
undergraduate instruction, ♦
speed-up would worsen the abi
of TAs to provide sympathetic
to undergraduates.
A few weeks ago Presi
Lyman lamented what a setba
would be if students were to
themselves as workers. As the ivi
13 USE strike deadline
approaches, we now understand
why. The administration ha;
sought to keep students divided
from workers as USE has steadi'
grown. We as students and facul
have much to learn frc ;
Stanford's other workers.
The management fears u
action — we should do our b
bring it about. A first step \
the meeting on Thursday i
noon in the large lounge
