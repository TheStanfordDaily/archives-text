# Hoover Tower Malady Strikes Stanford Grads
## 
### SUZIE BOSS 
Spring traditionally arrives at
Stanford with a burst of flowers,
. >lleybaJl players and Lake
Lagunita sailors. But, this season
can also heighten a strictly local
ailment. Particularly severe among
soon-to-graduate seniors and grad
students, the malady is
characterized by psychological
dependence on a small geographic
area. Afflicted students seek help
not at Cowell Health Center, but
at the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC).
"We call it the Hoover Tower
Syndrome," explained Dr. Ralph
Keller, director of the center.
Many students just don't want to
eave this area after they
graduate."
As a result, over 25,000 alumni
presently live in and around the
Bay Area. Ernest Phinney,
assistant director of classes and
student services at Bowman
Jumni House, said the Bay Area
> louses one quarter of the 100,000
Stanford alumni. Like Keller, he
attributes the region's popularity
to its geography and climate. "I
was from San Diego," he said,
"but just liked this area and
lecided to stay."
Many Alumni Return
Many alumni leave the area,
only to find themselves returning
later. Ronald Boyer, leader of the
Peninsula Alumni Club and
member of the Class of 1953,
found the area "good by
omparison. I moved East," he
said, "then eventually came back"
to his present home in Portola
Valley.
Keller has noticed a majority
of students list the Bay Area as
their top priority when seeking
work through the Placement
Jenter. Many preference cards
stipulate "definitely not Los
Angeles," he added.
Job shortages within the Bay-
Area are essentially the same as
those nationwide. Liberal arts
graduates are most affected,
according to Keller. One million
überal arts grads hit the job
market each year — an amount
five times larger than in 1940.
Yet, over the same years, available
positions have increased only 20
percent.
Job Availability Up
Stanford graduates face "not
nearly the problems of the
national situation," in finding
employment, Keller said. He
attributes his optimism partially
to the caliber of students enrolled
here. He also emphasized the
improved liberal arts job finding
.apacity of the Placement Center.
In 1973, when the national job
availability figures were down 10
percent, Stanford's placement
success rose 15 percent.
The Placement Center employs
a Director of Placement for
liberal Arts — a rare position,
according to Keller. Last year,
138 (or 56 percent) of the
students actively seeking work in
this field were placed by the
Center by late August, according

to the CPPC 1973 annual report.
Liberal arts graduates finding
employment in the Bay Area
made up 70 percent of these
placements.
Keller believes students may be
willing to make some concessions
to remain in this area In a study
done by the Placement Center last
year, over one third of the 83
seniors surveyed accepted
alternative jobs that did not relate
to stated career goals. Of those,
two thirds had chosen to stay in
the Bay Area.
Better Job Later
Although Keller did not think
many would opt for no job rather
than leaving the area, he did say,
"If given a choice between a
higher salary or staying here,
many would tend to stay here,
where they can have a high
expectation of getting a better job
later."
Business students, who tend to
accept the highest paying job
offer, also show a tendency to
remain in Northern California.
Last year, 40 percent of the
business school grads accepted
jobs in this area. The average
salary for the Bay Area group,
however, ranked seventh among
eight national areas, according to
the CPPC 1973 report.
Job demand currently runs
highest for business and
engineering grads, according to
Keller. Most students in these
fields had a range of job
possibilities to choose from last
year. Education graduates,
however, received a different
picture of the job market.
Especially in the Bay Area, the
market is now incapable of
absorbing all educators who want
to work here. The CPPC report
states that a number of education
graduates were unable to find jobs
due to self-imposed geographic
restrictions.
Nonetheless, the majority of
STEP (Secondary Teacher
Education Program) grads last
year preferred to remain here. Of

the 75 placed, 46 found jobs in
the Bay Area.
'Climate Attractive'
Reasons for remaining near
Stanford vary among alumni.
Phinney, of Bowman House, said
many are willing to remain
"despite low salary expectations
and job opportunities." Climate
and surroundings form part of the
attraction. Phinney also
mentioned many chances for
alumni to remain active with the
University and its alumni in this
area.
Those wishing to stay current
on academic life can participate in
various Alumni Association
activities. A summer Alumni
College gives members a chance to
go back to the lecture hall to hear
presentations on current topics by
Stanford professors. Quarterly
monographs are available through
Bowman House, offering
information on a variety of recent
topics.
Stanford Clubs Abound
Stanford clubs abound in the
Bay Area, particularly on the
Peninsula. Activities often
combine socializing with service
functions. The peninsula Club
generates funds for an annual
undergrad scholarship through
club dues and social events. The
Palo Alto Club provides
counseling by making local
professionals available to students.
Claudia Salquist of the Foothills
Club explained, "We exist to let
club members reunite and make
new acquaintances."
The Alumni Association,
together with its chapter clubs,
enbales graduates to extend ties
with Stanford beyond their years
enrolled here. Its success draws on
the same symptoms that lead to
the Hoover Tower Syndrome
resurgence each spring. Whatever
the nebulous quality is that keeps
alumni in the area, its
pervasiveness cannot be disputed.
As one alumni summarized, "It's
just awfully easy to get hooked on
Stanford."
