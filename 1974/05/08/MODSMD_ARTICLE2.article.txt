# Five-Year, Life Sentences Set For Hobson, Seabock
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP)- Two more
members of the revolutionary
Venceremos group were sentenced to
prison yesterday, completing the long
series of trials connected with the
escape of convict Ronald Wayne
Beaty.
Superior Court Judge Charles
Stratton ordered Robert Alan Seabock
to state prison "for the term specified
by law" â€” life imprisonment for
first-degree murder.
Jean Hobson was sentenced to five
years to life for second-degree murder.
On April 16, after a five-month
trial, a jury convicted Seabock, 22,
and Hobson, 45, both of Palo Alto, of
murder, assault with a deadly weapon
and the rescue of a prisoner in
connection with the ambush Oct. 2,
1972, that set Beaty free, killed one
prison guard and wounded another.
Beaty's Escape
Beaty, 35, was serving time at the
California Institute for Men at Chino
for armed robbery when a car carrying
him to a San Bernardino court
appearance was run off the road by
two other vehicles and a burst of
bullets killed guard Jesus Sanchez,

24, and wounded guard George
Fitzgerald, 36.
Beaty was recaptured two months
later in San Francisco while driving
across the Golden Gate Bridge with
Hobson. He pleaded guilty to murder
in Sanchez' death and testified for the
prosecution in the trials of nine
persons accused of helping him escape.
He testified that Seabock shot Sanchez
and that he and Hobson plotted his
escape after they met through
Venceremos in the summer of 1972.
New Trial Denied
Judge Stratton denied motions for
a new trial and attorneys said they
would appeal the decision.
Seabock, Hobson, her son Bruce
Hobson and Morton Newman, 31, of
Menlo Park, were all indicted by a San
Francisco federal grand jury on
conspiracy charges in the Beaty case.
Police and the FBI identified the four
as all being members of Venceremos,
described as a Palo Alto-area Maoist
revolutionary group.
Bruce Hobson and Newman are to
be sentenced May 31 in San Francisco
federal court on their April 28
conviction of harboring a fugitive.
