# Vibes From The Oval Office
## 
### DOUGLASS CATER Analysis Commentary 
During the third of the
so-called Great Debates between
candidates Nixon and Kennedy in
1960, a question was posed about
a recent outburst of cussing by
former President Harry S.
Truman. Kennedy answered
somewhat flippantly but Nixon
felt called upon to respond that
"whoever is President is going to
be a man that all the children of
America will either look up to or
will look down to and I can only
say that I am very proud that
President Eisenhower restored
dignity and decency and, frankly,
good language to the conduct of
the Presidency of the United
States. And I only hope that,
should I win this election, that I
could approach President
Eisenhower in maintaining the
dignity of the office; in seeing to
it that whenever any mother or
father talks to his child, he can
look at the man in the White
House and, whatever he may
think of his policies, he will say,
'There is a man who maintains the
kind of standards personally that I
would want my child to follow.' "
Whatever other impact they
may have, last week's revelations
of Nixon's private language will

hardly contribute to our
children's uplift. Even deleting the
expletives helps little since only
the very unimaginative will have
trouble filling in these particular
gaps. They reveal that Nixon
under stress, like Johnson and
Kennedy and, yes, Eisenhower,
did not refrain from mule-skinner
rhetoric. My impression is that he
has set new records in the sheer
frequency of his vulgarisms, yet
they appear to lack the rich
metaphorical content and lilting
alliteration which LBJ was able to
achieve in moments of
exasperation. Perhaps memory
plays tricks, but I cannot recall
that LBJ was content simply to
repeat the conventionally crude.
Ever reaching for new heights of
descriptiveness, he showed a
touch of the poet which earned
the secret admiration of his
associates even when they were
the particular objects of his wrath.
But cusswords aside, the
literature of Presidential language
has been vastly enriched by the
Nixon transcripts. and

congressmen may push for the
tapes in order to make meticulous
comparisons — for nuance of
spoken word as well as for deleted
words. But scholars of language
and leadership have more than
enough grist for analysis. What do
these dialogues reveal of the way
Nixon communicated with his
closest associates on perhaps the
most tormentful issue ever to
occupy a President?-
Rambling, Repetitive
In making his assessment, the
reader should not be misled
because the conversations are
rambling and repetitive, with
Nixon often appearing to think
out loud in , stream-of
consciousness fasion. This is the
way Presidents are apt to go about
their business, especially when
confronting difficult personal
choices. Nor does every White
House conference conclude with a
precise command from the
President. Aides on occasion are
obliged to balance contradictory
message signals to determine what
the President really decided. What
the President doesn't say can be as
important as what he does. It is
necessary, with or without help of
the tapes to weigh the implicit as
well as explicit language of the
Nixon dialogues.

Aides on occasion are obliged to
balance contradictory message
signals . . . What the President
doesn't say can be as important
as what he does

They reveal that the President,
months after the Watergate
break-in, still felt surprise and
anger at the sheer stupidity of the
culprits. But his greater anger by
far was directed at the Democrats
and the "soft headed"
Republicans. For Haldeman and
Dean, the clearer message lay in
Nixon's words:
President: Just remember all the
trouble we're taking.
We'll have a chance to get
back one day. (Sept. 13, 1972)
Even more revealing
Presidential language is directed to
the attempted cover-up of the
Watergate crimes , and what John
Mitchell so aptly called "the
White House horrors." For White
House counsel John Dean, surely
the message was not lost when
Nixon exploded:
President: But let's remember this
was not done by the White
House. This was done by the
Committee to Re-Elect, and
Mitchell was chairman,
correct?
Dean: That's correct.
President: And Kleindienst owes
Mitchell everything. Mitchell
wanted him for Attorney
General. Wanted him for
Deputy, and here his is. Now,
(expletive deleted), Baker's got
to realize this, and that if he
allows this thing to get out of
hand he is going to potentially
ruin John Mitchell. He won't.
Mitchell can't allow himself to
be ruined. He will put on his

big stone face... {Feb. 28,
1973)
It would have been an obtuse
aide who concluded that the
President really wished to get to
the heart of the matter.
Explicit Desire
Two weeks later, the
President's desire for cover-up
became more explicit when Dean
told the President that former
White House aide Gordon
Strachan had committed perjury
in denying knowledge of the
Watergate plot.
President: I will be damned! Well,
that is the problem in Bob's
[Haldeman] case. Not Chapin
then but Strachan. Strachan
worked for him, didn't he?
Dean: Yes. They would have one
hell of a time proving that
Strachan had knowledge of it,
though.
President: Who knew better?
Magruder?
Dean: Magruder and Liddy.
President: Oh, I see. The other
weak link for Bob is Magruder.
(March 13, 1973)
But Dean received no orders to
probe this suggestion of Watergate
complicity involving the
President's top assistant. Instead,
three days later, Nixon was
instructing him to prepare a
statement that Dean might deliver
to the Cabinet and then release:
President: You've got to have
something where it doesn't
appear that I am doing this in,
you know, just in a — saying to
hell with the Congress and to
hell with the people, we are
not going to tell you anything
because of Executive Privilege.
That, they don't understand.
But if you say, 'No, we are
willing to cooperate,' and
you've made a complete
statement, but make it very
incomplete. See, that is what I
mean. 1 don't want a, too
much in chapter and verse as
« you did in your letter, I just
want just a general.. .
Dean: An all-around statement.
President: That's right. Try just
something general. Like 'I have
checked into this matter; I can
categorically, based on my
investigation, the following:
Haldeman is not involved in
this, that and the other thing.
Mr. Colson did not do this; Mr.
so and so did not do this. Mr.
Blank did not do this.' Right
down the line, taking the most
glaring things. If there are any
further questions, please let me
know. See?
Dean: Uh, huh. I think we can do
that. (March 20, 1973)
Next day, at the fateful
meeting when Dean made an
effort to describe the "growing
cancer," Nixon's response was
more that of a defense lawyer
than a seeker of the truth. Dean
related that it had been White
House assistant Charles Colson
who had applied pressure to set
up the Liddy/Hunt operation in
CREEP:
President: Did Colson know what
they were talking about?
Dean: I can only assume, because
of his close relationship with
Hunt, that he had a damn good
idea what they were talking
about, a damn good idea. He
would probably deny it today
and probably get away with

denying it. But I still—unless
Hunt blows on him—
President: But then Hunt isn't
enough. It takes two, doesn't
it?
Dean: Probably. Probably. But
Liddy was there also and if
Liddy were to blow—
President: Then you have a
problem—l was saying as to the
criminal liability in the White
House. (March 21, 1973)
Hush Money
Both the President and special
counsel James St. Clair now claim
that at the March 21 meeting
Nixon rejected Howard Hunt's
demand for $120,000 hush
money. St. Clair argues that the
President decided instead to
initiate a new Grand Jury
proceeding. But those responsible
for carrying out the President's
wishes may have been more
impressed by his final words
about the Hunt hush money at
that mid-day meeting:
President: That's why for your
immediate things you have no
choice but to come up with the
$120,000, or whatever it is.
Right?
Dean: That's right.
President: Would you agree that
that's the prime thing that you
damn well better get that
done?
Dean: Obviously he ought to be
given some signal anyway.
President: (Expletive deleted), get
it. In a way that — who is going
to talk to him? Colson? He is
the one who is supposed to
know him?
Later that evening the hush
money came up one more time:
President: Yeah. And then so the
point we have to, the bridge we
have to cross there, that you
have - to cross I understand
quite soon, is what you do
about Hunt and his present
finance? What do we do about
that?
Dean; Well, apparently Mitchell
and Laßue are now aware of it
so they know how he is feeling.
President: True. Are they going to
do something?
Dean: Well, I have not talked with
either of them. Their positions
are sympathetic.
President: Well, it is a long road
isn't it? (March 21, 1973)
As for going the Grand Jury
route, an uneasy Presidential aide
might have gotten guidance from
the following:
President: .. .1 want everybody in
the White House called. And
that gives you a reason not to
have to go before the Ervin and

Baker committee. It puts it in
an executive session, in a sense.
Haldeman: Right.
Dean: That's right.
Haldeman: And there would be
some rules of evidence, aren't
there?
Dean: There are rules of evidence.
President: Rules of evidence and
you have lawyers.
Haldeman: You are in a hell of a
lot better position than you are
up there.
Dean: No, you can't have a lawyer
before the Grand Jury.
President: Oh, no. That's right.
Haldeman: But you do have rules
of evidence. You can refuse to
talk.
Dean: You can take the Fifth
Amendment.
President: That's right.
Haldeman: You can say you have
forgotten too can't you?
Dean: Sure but you are chancing a
very high risk for perjury
situation.
President: But you can say I don't
remember. You can say I can't
recall. I can't give any answer
to that that I can recall. (March
21, 1973)
One Among Equals
As the conversations drone on,
Nixon appears to become just one
among equals in this endless quest
to break free from their growing
entrapment. His aides, as if
sensing their mutual degradation,
drop the usual deference to a
President and answer him in
slurred "yeah" and "uh-huh."
One searches beneath the words
for what the President is really
feeling about his plight. He
vacillates so widely among a
multitude of emotions: self pity
("Nobody is a friend of ours.
Let's face it. Don't worry about
that sort of thing."),
vindictiveness (to Dean: "Do you
need any of that IRS stuff?"),
suspicion of a vast conspiracy
("The establishemnt is dying and
so they've got to show that
despite the successes we have had
in foreign policy and in the
election, they've got to show that
it is just wrong because of this.").
Strangely, there are no words
of anger for associates like
Mitchell, who might have helped
him avoid this predicament — no
rebukes for failure to alert him.
When John Dean blurts out that
he, Dean, might go to jail for
obstruction of justice, Nixon's
immediate response is,
"Sometimes it is well to give them
something and then they don't
want the bigger push?"
He seems to have memory

lapses that he has bugged his own
office. How else can one explain
the dialogue during Dean's
"growing cancer" discourse?
Dean: Now what has happened
post June 17? I was under
pretty clear instructions not to
investigate this, but this could
have been disastrous on the
electorate if all hell had broken
loose. I worked on a theory of
containment. .. .
President: Sure.
Dean: To try to hold it right
where it was.
President: Right. (March 21,
1973)
Later on, it is obvious that
Nixon is speaking strictly for the
benefit of the hidden
microphones.
The lonely little group winds
its way through countless
explorations of ways to defy, to
evade, to take the
counter-offensive. Both Nixon
and Dean keep reassuring
themselves that ex-FBI employee

William Sullivan will supply them
with the goods on former
administrations that will divert
public attention. At the start of
the conversation of March 21, the
President asks about Sullivan and
pleads, "As soon as you get that, I
will be available to talk to you
this afternoon." But Sullivan sinks
from sight in the dialogues
without a trace of the promised
dirt.
Instead, they dig ever deeper
into their trench mentality while
bandying wild schemes of ways to
divide or distract the enemy. One
searches in vain to discover just
when Nixon realizes how
desperate his predicament really
is. But he repeatedly voices
confidence that the public will
soon weary of this because
"average people won't think it is
much of a crisis unless it affects
them." On March 13, Nixon
considers Dean's suggestion to
"let it all hang out" and
concludes: "We have passed that
point." A short time later in the
same conversation, he asks Dean,
"Is it too late to go the hang-out
road?" and Dean replies, "Yes, I
think it is."

Perhaps the most poignant and
revealing exchange concerns
Watergate culprit Gordon Liddy,
who went off to jail without a
murmur:
President: How the hell does
Liddy stand up so well?
Dean: He's a strange man, Mr.
President.
President: Strange or strong.
Dean: Strange and strong. His
loyalty is — I think it is just
beyond the pale. Nothing. . .
President: He hates the other side,
too, doesn't he? (March 13,
1973)
During a later conversation,
Dean tells the President that
Liddy had justified the Watergate
break-in on grounds that he was
being pushed "without mercy" to
supply information to the White
House. The President muses:
Why at that point in time I
wonder? I am just trying to
think. We had just finished the
Moscow trip. The Democrats
had just nominated McGovern

One searches in vain to discover just
when Nixon realizes how desperate
his predicament really is

[sic] I mean, (expletive
deleted), what in the hell were
these people doing? I can see
their doing it earlier. I can see
the pressures, but I don't see
why all the pressure was on
then. (March 21, 1973)
What caused it all to happen? I
have an explanation which is
based on many years of watching
Presidents, one of them at very
close hand. What they
communiate cannot be measured
alone by their public acts and
formal utterances. They create the
environment of their leadership
by the countless private words
and gestures that get transmitted
down through the hierarchies of
Washington. Their more
meaningful message is in the
vibrations they generate. LBJ's
vibes transmitted a dogged
stay-the-course in Vietnam despite
his occasional orders to reexamine
the growing catastrophe. For
Richard M. Nixon, as these
transcripts make perfectly clear,
his vibes set off the outrage of
Watergate, the cover-up and"the
White House horrors" as surely as
if he had issued a direct
command.
