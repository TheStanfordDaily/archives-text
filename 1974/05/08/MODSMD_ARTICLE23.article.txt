# But Sandy Defaults
## Gene Mayer Triumphs 
### 
First seed Sandy Mayer
withdrew from the California
State Championships yesterday,
but the day wasn't a total loss to
the Mayer family.
Sandy's brother Gene won one
of the biggest matches of his life
when he defeated California's top
player, Trey Waltke, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3
in the round of 64 at the
prestigious tournament, held at
the Alpine Hills Tennis Club in
Portola Valley.
According to coach Dick
Gould, Mayer "hit his first serve
and first volleyed well, especially
in the first set." The Stanford
freshman will be idle tomorrow,
as his scheduled foe, Tom
Bohrnstedt, withdrew. He'll play
in the round of 16 on Thursday.

Meanwhile, first-seeded Sandy
Mayer, the defending champion,
withdrew after having a wisdom
tooth pulled Monday night. The
senior star is all right, according to
Gould, but did not want to jump
up and down on the hard cement
courts.
Today, three Stanford players
will be in action for the first time:
John Whitlinger, Jim Delaney and
Nick Saviano. Pat DuPre, also
scheduled to play tomorrow,
withdrew after having another
cortisone shot in his wrist
yesterday. "I'm a lot more
concerned about Pat than I am
about Sandy," Gould said.
Stanford entrants Mark
Mitchell and Chico Hagey remain
alive after singles wins yesterday.

Mitchell beat Cary Stansburg 6-3,
6-2, while Hagey crushed Dan
Bleckinger 6-1, 6-1. Today,
Mitchell plays Dick Dell while
Hagey has a bye because of yet
another withdrawal, that of Tito
Vasquez of Argentina, and thus
has reached the round of 16.
Today, Delaney is paired with
teaching professional John Zweig,
Whitlinger with Greg Shepard and
Saviano with Henry Kamakana.
In doubles, Chip Fisher-Craig
Johnson, Tim Noonan-Jake
Warde, Hagey-Gene Mayer and
Mitchell-Saviano all remain alive.
Because of the withdrawals of
DuPre and Sandy Mayer, the
Cards' top two doubles teams
have been broken up and had to
forfeit.
In doubles today,
Fisher-Johnson meet third-seeded
Dick Dell-Sherwood Stuart,
Noonan-Warde face Rodney
Kopp-Chuck White, Hagey-Mayer
meet Whitney Reed-Chuck Darby
and Mitchell-Saviano are idle until
the round of 16 tomorrow.

STILL THE BEST — Roger Still well, along with Pat Donovan, leaves
Friday for Chicago to take part in picture-taking ceremonies for
Playboy's preseason All-America team. The two defensive ends
received several All-America mentions after last season, but have never
before been named to the same All-America team.
