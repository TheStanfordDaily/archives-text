# Big-Time College Athletics
## Methods Of Reforming The System 
### PHILIP HEIMLICH Last of Four Parts 
The system which our colleges
presently use to investigate
violations is considered woefully
inadequate. The NCAA has a
full-time staff of four investigators
to police 664 colleges.
While penalties have been
imposed on 15 schools in the last
14 months, many educators and
athletic officials, according to a
survey conducted by the New
York Times, believe that this is
only a small fraction of the total
number of schools violating the
rules.
Those schools which are caught
paying an athlete, cheating on
recruiting, or committing some
other infraction are placed on
probation, which merely means
they cannot participate in certain
post-season games. Frequently the
boy who accepts money is barred
from competition while the coach
who pressed it on him is let off
clean.
Long Beach State was recently
put on a three-year probation for
violating dozens of association
rules — including moving one
recruit's family to a home near
the college while providing his
relatives with money and jobs.
Meanwhile, the coach who
presided over these violations,
Jerry Tarkanian, simply moved to
another school — Las Vegas,
Nevada — where a lucrative
contract awaited him. "Every
school violates those rules," says
Tarkanian. "If they [the NCAA]
concentrated, they could get any
school in the country."
Reform Attempts
Since the overwhelming
number of irregularities occur in
football and basketball, most
attempts at reform have been
centered on these two sports.
Ptnn State football coach Joe
Paterno has suggested that the
NCAA increase its investigating
staff. The National Football
League, he points out, has been
able to keep its sport relatively
free of scandal with a staff of 28.
The NFL, however, has only 24
teams to police — not 664.
Another method of improving
the current system has been
proposed by Stanford Athletic
Director Joseph Ruetz. He asks
that financial need be made a
factor in athletic scholarships.
This, he explains, would allow
universities to cut costs by no
longer awarding full scholarships
to athletes with no demonstrated
need while, at the same time,
permitting the schools to raise the
amount of money given to
students who are most
disadvantaged.
Many coaches and
administrators, nonetheless,
disagree with this idea. UCLA
Athletic Director J.D. Morgan
believes that the grant-in-aid is a
source of great pride to the
athlete who, regardless of his

need, wants to be on his own.
Others feel it would lead to
increased violations. "That kind
of rule encourages people to
cheat," says Vince Gibson. "There
are so many ways for people to
show need," adds USC Athletic-
Director John McKay, "that it's
extremely difficult to
differentiate, say, between how
much a boy in Mississippi deserves
in relation to a boy from New
York."
Professionalism
The most basic criticism aimed
at intercollegiate sport today is
that it is too professionalized.
Whereas professional sports are
played for material rewards, one
supposedly participates in
amateur athletics for the joy of
doing so. At many universities this
distinction has become harder and
harder to find.
At Stanford, the athletic
program, despite a recruiting
budget of over $28,000, is
virtually devoid of violations.
There are no under-the-table
payoffs or cars offered to recruits,
nor does one find snap courses
being used to keep athletes
eligible.
Academically, Stanford
athletes have a higher graduation
rate within four years than the
school as a whole; their majors
reflect a broad cross-section of the
University; and 85 percent of
them go on to graduate and
professional schools.
Still, when most of the athletic
scholarships are awarded Stanford
football and basketball players
(over 80 each year), the need
factor is not even considered. It
appears that the purpose of these
grants-in-aid, like those offered at
other schools, is not to provide a
needy student with an education
he otherwise would not receive,
but to pay the athlete to compete
for Stanford.
It is difficult to maintain, in
other words, that the young man
is playing merely for the love of
the game, as long as his
scholarship is dependent on his
participation on a team.
Academic Comparison
Ruetz believes that a student
with athletic ability should not be
treated any differently than
someone with talent in chemistry,
for example.
And yet, most chemistry
students are not recruited in high
school and then automatically
placed on scholarship, regardless
of their financial situation, upon
admission to college.
Furthermore, a chemistry major
who is receiving financial aid does
not have his scholarship taken
away from him if he drops out of
that department.
The Ivy League schools appear
to have recognized this
distinction. They award
scholarships to needy students
who have distinguished themselves
in athletic as well as other

endeavors.
Once admitted, however, they
are under no more obligation to
participate in sports than join the
chess club. Thus, it is likely that
people playing football for Yale
or Harvard are doing so simply
because they enjoy the game —
not because their grant-in-aid
depends on it.
The coaching staff, having no
control over the athlete's
scholarship, is not able to freely
manipulate his appearance and
personal life. At these schools,
massive recruiting programs are
virtually nonexistent; with no
guarantee that a player will
compete, it is simply not worth
the effort to recruit him.
Implementation
While most observers agree that
big-time college athletics are in
need of change, it is unclear who
should implement it. One unlikely
source would be the coaches,
most of whom are not known for
their liberalism.
Woody Hayes, football coach
at Ohio State, seemed to express
the feeling of many of his
colleagues when he stated, "I
honestly think there's a great
movement on campuses today to
undermine athletes. Some of these
psychology and sociology
professors we can do without."
Reform is also not expected to
come from the central
policymakers of the NCAA. In
1969, when hundreds of black
athletes across the country
launched protests against various
discriminatory practices, Walter
Byers, executive director of the
NCAA, had the problem all
figured out.
"The evidence is clear," he

wrote in the December issue of
NCAA News, "that there is
operating in this country a
hard-core revolutionary force
designed to destroy the present
governmental and educational
system of the United States.
"It divides into a number of
different groups, and
representatives of this movement
have direct communication with
Communist-oriented,
revolutionary groups in other
nations. . ~" Byers said.
Financial Limitations
Some limits may eventually be
imposed on collegiate athletic
departments by university
administrators unable to cope
with the spiraling cost of
intercollegiate sports. Ninety
percent of all college athletic
departments, according to the
Times survey, are now operating
in the red.
Whereas Stanford's
intercollegiate athletic program is
self-supporting (and, in fact, pays
for intramural and recreational
activities, as well), most other big
schools spend as much as a million
dollars a year in general funds and
compulsory student fees on
intercollegiate athletics.
"I'm paying half a million in
salaries, half a million in
scholarships, and I haven't taken a
jockstrap out of the bin yet,"
John Loetz, athletic business
manager at Michigan State, has
stated.
Other areas, besides
scholarships, have also been hit by
inflation. At Florida the price of
football equipment has increased
from $16,000 to more than
$33,000 in 10 years.

41 colleges in the past 10 years
(eight last year) found the price
too high to pay and have dropped
football. A task force of students,
administrators and faculty at Ohio
University reportedly pointed out
that $2 million a year was being
spent on 617 of the University's
18,000 students and
recommended that all
intercollegiate sports (except
basketball) be reduced to the club
level.
The solution, interestingly
enough, to the problems facing
intercollegiate sport may finally
come from the source of much of
its troubles: the professional
football and basketball leagues.
Forced Change
While the owners of these
teams are by no means expected
to drop their profitable four-year
rule voluntarily, they may not
have a choice. Federal Judge
Warren J. Ferguson has declared
that the four-year rule is a
violation of Section I of the
Sherman Act.
Following the decision, NFL
Commissioner Pete Rozelle told
Sports Illustrated that he could
not believe that "a practice that is
for the protection of the colleges
could be legally ruled invalid. If it
could be, of course, it would no
doubt destroy college football and
basketball."
What the ruling actually means
is that the pros might eventually
be forced to operate their own
minor leagues rather than using
the colleges for that purpose. In
that case, stated one college
commission, "we could always go
back to using students as
athletes."
