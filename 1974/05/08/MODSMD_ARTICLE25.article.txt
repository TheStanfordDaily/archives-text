# Sizzling Trojans Win Southern Golf
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Coach Bud Finger and the
Stanford golf team flew home
from Los Angeles last night with
nothing but respect for USC's
talented Trojans.
'They just played out of this
world," Finger said after USC
skyrocketed past Stanford to win
the Pacific Eight Southern
Division championship at Hillcrest
Country Club.
The Trojans, who trailed the
Cards by three shots after
Monday's opening 36 holes,
parlayed rounds of 73-70-68-67 in
yesterday's 18-hole finale for a
comfortable 16-shot victory. USC
finished with an 862 total,
followed by Stanford (878),
UCLA (898) and California (909).
"We just went out there and
played mediocre golf," lamented
Finger. "And they played super."
Super may have been an
understatement. While Craig
Stadler cruised the par 71
Hillcrest layout in 70 strokes and
Mark Pfeil fired a 73, two
lesser-known Trojans literally
brought Hillcrest to its knees. Jim
Ruziecki carded a 68 and Jon
Fiedler turned in a 67, giving USC
a 278 final round total —
six-under-par as a team.
Mediocre Scores
The Cardinal scores,
meanwhile, were far from
sensational. Dave Baskins fired a
73, Aly Trompas shot 74, Conrad
Nilmeier shot 76 and George
Pettinger slumped to a 77 after
impressive opening rounds of
72-70.
Much to Finger's dismay, a 72
by Harrington and a 73 by Glenn
Goethels came too late to matter.
Both golfers accumulated 153
totals on Monday, so their final
round efforts didn't count toward
Stanford's team score (only the

low four scores determine the
team championship).
Stadler defended his individual
title with a 212 total on rounds of
69-73-70, edging teammate Pfeil
by two strokes. Baskins carded
steady rounds of 72-72-73 to
Ruziecki for third at 217, while
Pettinger shared fifth with Fiedler
at 219.
Fiedler was seemingly out of it
after opening, rounds of 77-75,
but his final round 67 represented
a 10-shot advantage over
Pettinger. "George gave it a good
try," Finger said. "He had putting
problems on the back nine, but
there was a lot of pressure on him.
You gotta win one first to feel
reaJly confident in the stretch."
Rough Back Side
Pettinger trailed second-round
leader Pfeil by only one shot
entering the final round and
stayed in contention with a
one-over-par 37 on the front nine
yesterday. He ballooned to a 40
on the back side, however, for a
77 and a 219 total.
Trompas finished seventh on
rounds of 75-71-74—220, while
Nilmeier shot 72-74-76—222 to
tie for ninth. Stanford's
non-counting scores were
Harrington (77-76-72—225) and
Goethels (74-79-73-226).
The Trojans, currently the
nation's second-ranked team in
Golf World's collegiate poll, hope
to defend their overall Pac-8 title
on May 17-18 at the Stanford
course.
In major tournaments,
Stanford and USC are now 2-2 for
the season. The Cards triumphed
at last week's U.S. Collegiate
Invitational and finished ahead of
the Trojans at the Fresno Classic,
while USC won yesterday and also
captured the Pacific Coast
Invitational title.

DOUBLES STAR — Senior Terry Albert has been a consistent doubles
winner for the Stanford women's tennis team this year. She and
partner Whitney Grant won the NCIAC first doubles championship
last weekend.
Coach Bud Finger and the
Stanford golf team flew home
from Los Angeles last night with
nothing but respect for USC's
talented Trojans.
'They just played out of this
world," Finger said after USC
skyrocketed past Stanford to win
the Pacific Eight Southern
Division championship at Hillcrest
Country Club.
The Trojans, who trailed the
Cards by three shots after
Monday's opening 36 holes,
parlayed rounds of 73-70-68-67 in
yesterday's 18-hole finale for a
comfortable 16-shot victory. USC
finished with an 862 total,
followed by Stanford (878),
UCLA (898) and California (909).
"We just went out there and
played mediocre golf," lamented
Finger. "And they played super."
Super may have been an
understatement. While Craig
Stadler cruised the par 71
Hillcrest layout in 70 strokes and
Mark Pfeil fired a 73, two
lesser-known Trojans literally
brought Hillcrest to its knees. Jim
Ruziecki carded a 68 and Jon
Fiedler turned in a 67, giving USC
a 278 final round total —
six-under-par as a team.
Mediocre Scores
The Cardinal scores,
meanwhile, were far from
sensational. Dave Baskins fired a
73, Aly Trompas shot 74, Conrad
Nilmeier shot 76 and George
Pettinger slumped to a 77 after
impressive opening rounds of
72-70.
Much to Finger's dismay, a 72
by Harrington and a 73 by Glenn
Goethels came too late to matter.
Both golfers accumulated 153
totals on Monday, so their final
round efforts didn't count toward
Stanford's team score (only the

low four scores determine the
team championship).
Stadler defended his individual
title with a 212 total on rounds of
69-73-70, edging teammate Pfeil
by two strokes. Baskins carded
steady rounds of 72-72-73 to
Ruziecki for third at 217, while
Pettinger shared fifth with Fiedler
at 219.
Fiedler was seemingly out of it
after opening, rounds of 77-75,
but his final round 67 represented
a 10-shot advantage over
Pettinger. "George gave it a good
try," Finger said. "He had putting
problems on the back nine, but
there was a lot of pressure on him.
You gotta win one first to feel
reaJly confident in the stretch."
Rough Back Side
Pettinger trailed second-round
leader Pfeil by only one shot
entering the final round and
stayed in contention with a
one-over-par 37 on the front nine
yesterday. He ballooned to a 40
on the back side, however, for a
77 and a 219 total.
Trompas finished seventh on
rounds of 75-71-74—220, while
Nilmeier shot 72-74-76—222 to
tie for ninth. Stanford's
non-counting scores were
Harrington (77-76-72—225) and
Goethels (74-79-73-226).
