# Cards Extend Winning Streak To Nine
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Stanford's baseball team held
some organized batting practice
the past two days, clobbering USF
23-5 Monday and California 13-6
yesterday in a pair of non-league
games at Sunken Diamond. The
victories put the Cards over the
.500 mark for the first time this
year (23-21) and extended their
winning streak to nine games.
Normally these would be great
achievements, but in a year when
the Cards find themselves tied for
the Pacific Eight Southern
Division lead, they're about as
meaningless as the Stanford tennis
team defeating similar foes.
The real action comes this
weekend as the Cards meet Cal in
a three-game series. If they win all
three they're assured of winning
the Southern Division title.
But Stanford coach Ray Young
thought the warmup victories
were part of the real action.
"Every game is important," he
said. "When we looked like we
were out of it a couple of weeks

ago, we played 'em one at a time
and we're still doing it. The only
difference is that we're playing
with greater intensity now."
Intensity indeed. The Cards
erupted for 24 hits Monday and
the 23 runs they scored wouldn't
even fit on the scoreboard.
Come-From-Behind
Stanford came from behind in
both contests. Monday the Dons
held a 3-0 second inning lead
before the Cards battled back to
score two runs in the bottom of
the second and three in the third.
Cal was also riding comfortably
with a 6-1 lead when the Cards
scored seven runs in the bottom
of the sixth.
The contests did wonders for
the Cards' averages. Dave Baker
just missed the "cycle" (single,
double, triple, home run) against
Cal. Baker's last at bat was a
double, his second of the game,
which was about five feet shy of
the wall. Mark Lucich's two home
runs boosted his total to 10, just
one shy of the Stanford record for

most home runs in a season.
The games also provided an
opportunity for the non-starters
to get in some work. Pitcher Jerry
Argust got some great experience
as he came in with the bases
loaded in the fourth against Cal
and promptly got Stanford out of
a jam. Argust went on to retire 16
out of 17 batters.
Stanford 23, USF 5
The Cards erupted for 24 hits
to give Dean Stotz his third win of
the year. The "Bearcat," who was
slated to start Tuesday, was given
the nod so his parents could see
him in action.
Stotz gave Mom and Dad
something to remember, allowing
just three earned runs in five
innings of work. Bruce Davis
finished up for Stotz, allowing
just two runs.
The big inning came in the
fifth. Lucich's three-run homer
highlighted the production as the
Cards scored nine runs on six hits,
to take a 15-5 lead. But they
weren't through. Reserve catcher
John Crosby came up with
another three-run homer in the
eighth to cap the victory.
Stanford hit seven doubles in the
contest.
Stanford 13, Cal 6
Stanford fans were thinking
that the Cards should have saved
some of those runs they scored
the day before, as Cal held a 6-1
advantage going into the bottom
of the sixth inning. Starter Kent
Caldwell allowed seven hits and

the Bears were threatening to
stretch their six run lead with the
bases loaded in the fourth inning.
But Argust came in to put out
the fire and went on to allow just
one hit.
If Argust's pitching didn't give
the Cards the win, a seven-run
sixth inning certainly did.
Stanford scored seven runs on just
three hits as Cal reliever Lou Irwin
wild pitched in two runs. Baker's
one RBI triple was the highlight
of the inning.
But Stanford wasn't satisfied
with that lead. Lucich capped a
five-run eighth inning with a two
run homer.

the Pacific Eight Southern
Division lead, they're about as
meaningless as the Stanford tennis
team defeating similar foes.
The real action comes this
weekend as the Cards meet Cal in
a three-game series. If they win all
three they're assured of winning
the Southern Division title.
But Stanford coach Ray Young
thought the warmup victories
were part of the real action.
"Every game is important," he
said. "When we looked like we
were out of it a couple of weeks

ago, we played 'em one at a time
and we're still doing it. The only
difference is that we're playing
with greater intensity now."
Intensity indeed. The Cards
erupted for 24 hits Monday and
the 23 runs they scored wouldn't
even fit on the scoreboard.
Come-From-Behind
Stanford came from behind in
both contests. Monday the Dons
held a 3-0 second inning lead
before the Cards battled back to
score two runs in the bottom of
the second and three in the third.
Cal was also riding comfortably
with a 6-1 lead when the Cards
scored seven runs in the bottom
of the sixth.
The contests did wonders for
the Cards' averages. Dave Baker
just missed the "cycle" (single,
double, triple, home run) against
Cal. Baker's last at bat was a
double, his second of the game,
which was about five feet shy of
the wall. Mark Lucich's two home
runs boosted his total to 10, just
one shy of the Stanford record for

most home runs in a season.
The games also provided an
opportunity for the non-starters
to get in some work. Pitcher Jerry
Argust got some great experience
as he came in with the bases
loaded in the fourth against Cal
and promptly got Stanford out of
a jam. Argust went on to retire 16
out of 17 batters.
Stanford 23, USF 5
The Cards erupted for 24 hits
to give Dean Stotz his third win of
the year. The "Bearcat," who was
slated to start Tuesday, was given
the nod so his parents could see
him in action.
Stotz gave Mom and Dad
something to remember, allowing
just three earned runs in five
innings of work. Bruce Davis
finished up for Stotz, allowing
just two runs.
The big inning came in the
fifth. Lucich's three-run homer
highlighted the production as the
Cards scored nine runs on six hits,
to take a 15-5 lead. But they
weren't through. Reserve catcher
John Crosby came up with
another three-run homer in the
eighth to cap the victory.
Stanford hit seven doubles in the
contest.
Stanford 13, Cal 6
Stanford fans were thinking
that the Cards should have saved
some of those runs they scored
the day before, as Cal held a 6-1
advantage going into the bottom
of the sixth inning. Starter Kent
Caldwell allowed seven hits and

the Bears were threatening to
stretch their six run lead with the
bases loaded in the fourth inning.
But Argust came in to put out
the fire and went on to allow just
one hit.
If Argust's pitching didn't give
the Cards the win, a seven-run
sixth inning certainly did.
Stanford scored seven runs on just
three hits as Cal reliever Lou Irwin
wild pitched in two runs. Baker's
one RBI triple was the highlight
of the inning.
But Stanford wasn't satisfied
with that lead. Lucich capped a
five-run eighth inning with a two
run homer.

ago, we played 'em one at a time
and we're still doing it. The only
difference is that we're playing
with greater intensity now."
Intensity indeed. The Cards
erupted for 24 hits Monday and
the 23 runs they scored wouldn't
even fit on the scoreboard.
Come-From-Behind
Stanford came from behind in
both contests. Monday the Dons
held a 3-0 second inning lead
before the Cards battled back to
score two runs in the bottom of
the second and three in the third.
Cal was also riding comfortably
with a 6-1 lead when the Cards
scored seven runs in the bottom
of the sixth.
The contests did wonders for
the Cards' averages. Dave Baker
just missed the "cycle" (single,
double, triple, home run) against
Cal. Baker's last at bat was a
double, his second of the game,
which was about five feet shy of
the wall. Mark Lucich's two home
runs boosted his total to 10, just
one shy of the Stanford record for

most home runs in a season.
The games also provided an
opportunity for the non-starters
to get in some work. Pitcher Jerry
Argust got some great experience
as he came in with the bases
loaded in the fourth against Cal
and promptly got Stanford out of
a jam. Argust went on to retire 16
out of 17 batters.
Stanford 23, USF 5
The Cards erupted for 24 hits
to give Dean Stotz his third win of
the year. The "Bearcat," who was
slated to start Tuesday, was given
the nod so his parents could see
him in action.
Stotz gave Mom and Dad
something to remember, allowing
just three earned runs in five
innings of work. Bruce Davis
finished up for Stotz, allowing
just two runs.
The big inning came in the
fifth. Lucich's three-run homer
highlighted the production as the
Cards scored nine runs on six hits,
to take a 15-5 lead. But they
weren't through. Reserve catcher
John Crosby came up with
another three-run homer in the
eighth to cap the victory.
Stanford hit seven doubles in the
contest.
Stanford 13, Cal 6
Stanford fans were thinking
that the Cards should have saved
some of those runs they scored
the day before, as Cal held a 6-1
advantage going into the bottom
of the sixth inning. Starter Kent
Caldwell allowed seven hits and

the Bears were threatening to
stretch their six run lead with the
bases loaded in the fourth inning.
But Argust came in to put out
the fire and went on to allow just
one hit.
If Argust's pitching didn't give
the Cards the win, a seven-run
sixth inning certainly did.
Stanford scored seven runs on just
three hits as Cal reliever Lou Irwin
wild pitched in two runs. Baker's
one RBI triple was the highlight
of the inning.
But Stanford wasn't satisfied
with that lead. Lucich capped a
five-run eighth inning with a two
run homer.

Stanford's baseball team held
some organized batting practice
the past two days, clobbering USF
23-5 Monday and California 13-6
yesterday in a pair of non-league
games at Sunken Diamond. The
victories put the Cards over the
.500 mark for the first time this
year (23-21) and extended their
winning streak to nine games.
Normally these would be great
achievements, but in a year when
the Cards find themselves tied for
the Pacific Eight Southern
Division lead, they're about as
meaningless as the Stanford tennis
team defeating similar foes.
The real action comes this
weekend as the Cards meet Cal in
a three-game series. If they win all
three they're assured of winning
the Southern Division title.
But Stanford coach Ray Young
thought the warmup victories
were part of the real action.
"Every game is important," he
said. "When we looked like we
were out of it a couple of weeks

ago, we played 'em one at a time
and we're still doing it. The only
difference is that we're playing
with greater intensity now."
