# Women's Tennis Team Wins Tourney, Duals
## 
### 
Stanford's women's tennis
team won fhe Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) tournament
held Friday and Saturday at the
U. of Pacific.
The team continued its
winning ways with wins over
Santa Clara and Mills College
Monday and yesterday.
At the 16-team NCIAC
tourney, Stanford won three of
the six divisions. First singles
player Tracy McNair, first doubles
team Whitney Grant-Terry Albert
and third doubles team Ann
Feeley-Diane Liebenson all won
the championships of their
respective divisions.
At second singles, Andrea
Barnes placed second, as did the
second doubles team of Chris
Michael-Danny D'Aldarmi. Third
singles entrant Nancy Anderson
reached the semis.
UC-Davis finished second, with
California third.
Monday, the team
overwhelmed Santa Clara at the
loser's courts, 6-0. Barnes,
Anderson and Pat Delaney won
singles matches while
Feeley-Liebenson, Marlene
Veach-Carolyn Nichols and Leslie
Simon-Jane Hayes emerged with
doubles triumphs.
Yesterday, the team beat Mills
College 6-0 on the women's

courts. Anderson, Delaney and
Nichols won at singles, with
Feeley-Liebenson, Veach-Carol Cox
and Simon-Hayes winning at
doubles.
While the NCIAC
championships represented a
major victory, a win in the Pacific
Eight tournament this Friday and
Saturday will be even
more impressive as both USC and
UCLA are strong. The expected
lineup places McNair and Barnes
at the singles positions with
Grant-Albert and Michael-
D'Aldari at doubles.
