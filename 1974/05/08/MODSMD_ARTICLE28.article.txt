# Top Prep Swimmer To Enroll At Stanford
## 
### 
Stanford's swim team moved
up a length on the opposition this
spring when it was announced
that Mike Bruner, probably the
best high school swimmer in the
U.S., had signed a letter of intent
to attend school here next year.
Bruner has already surpassed
the marks which won this year's
NCAA championship in both the
1,650 and 500 freestyles, and has
come close in the 200 butterfly.
Obviously, Bruner, a senior at
Lincoln High School in Stockton,
is a prime candidate for the 1976

Olympic team.
Bruner holds the American
record in the 1,650, with a
phenomenal 15:15.5 clocking,
over 40 seconds faster than the
Stanford record. In the 500,
Bruner has clocked 4:25.81 and in
the 200 fly his time is 1:47.05.
Obviously, the addition of one
swimmer cannot be itself boost
Stanford from sixth to first in the
NCAA swim meet. But Gaughran
says "if you've got four guys like
Bruner, you're in business. There
are a lot of good high school
juniors now; next year will be a
good recruiting year. If Bruner
does a good job, then maybe we
can get some of these people to
come here."
According to Gaughran, Bruner
chose Stanford because of
academics and because his lifelong
swim coach, Bill Rose, is at the
nearby DeAnza Swim Club.
While none of Stanford's other
recruits are nearly as talented as
Bruner, Gaughran feels they
should all add depth to the team
and could develop into
outstanding swimmers.
The group includes
breaststroker Stuart Corliss from
Memphis, Tenn., sprinter Rich
Johannsen from Santa Barbara,
middle distance man Bill Chao
and sprinter and individual
medleyist Hugh Kuhn from
Indiana.
