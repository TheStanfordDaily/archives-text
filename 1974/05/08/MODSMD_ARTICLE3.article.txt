# Jewish Scholar Fills Dinkelspiel
## Biblical Tales 'Timeless' 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
"If what happened to biblical
characters was limited to them alone,
the stories would have long been
forgotten," author and educator Elie
Wiesel said Sunday. "But Judaism
teaches us not to forget... [that]
man's tale is timeless. Scripture is the
history book of the future."
Wiesel "spoke" to three consecutive
overflow crowds of 900 at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium Sunday through yesterday
on the topic of "Biblical Heroes: Our
Contemporaries."
"Spoke" may not be the best
reference to Wiesel's presentations,
though. In the Hasidic tradition, he
told stories through which "the
present could only be seen through the
lens of the past," in the words of
Religious Studies Prof. Robert M.
Brown, who introduced Wiesel on

Sunday.
The stories were of Adam, Cain and
Abel, and The Binding of Isaac, but
the entire series was a message of
responsibility.
"The first couple [Adam and Eve]
had to sin for history to spring forth,"
Wiesel noted. 'They had to open the
door leading to the downfall."
Punished
But, according to Wiesel, the
Midrash says that Adam and Eve were
"punished not so much for sin, but for
alibi," for trying to "evade
responsibility."
"Original sin," he commented, "is
absent from the Talmud and alien to
Jewish thought. Sin cannot be
transmitted or inherited. We are linked
to Adam by his death, not his sin."
"It is given to man to defeat death
by creating life and sanctifying it. That
is why we claim Adam's anguish as our
own. Adam is in us, and it is up to us
to keep him alive.
Responsibility
"Man's responsibility is not only
for himself and his brother, but also
for God. What man does, commits
more than his own world."
Wiesel concludes that Cain is guilty
for slaying his brother, "from the
Jewish point of view. He may have had
the purer vision, but he had no right to
destroy life."
"Cain killed, and Cain goes on
killing," Wiesel said. "But now we
know ... he who kills, kills himself.
Come to think of it, do we know?"
Wiesel concluded Monday.
Story Of Isaac
Yesterday, he related the story of
Isaac, who was saved from being
sacrificed by his father, Abraham,
because of God's mercy.
But those who heard the
presentation, could not help but hear
_n unmentioned, but obvious different
tale. "It was the story of Wiesel's life
and the holocaust," one student said.
Wiesel's life is related in his first
book, Night, a grim tale of how he
watched his parents and younger sister

used as fuel in the furnaces of the
Auschwitz concentration camp.
Wiesel was spared, just as Isaac was
spared thousands of years before. But
he has been repeatedly asked about
the responsibility of others for the
holocaust.
Wiesel, 45, was born in Hungary.
After the war he lived in Paris, where
he adopted the French language and
assumed French nationality. His books
include prize-winning novels A Beggar
in Jerusalem and Souls on Fire, Dawn,
The Accident, The Town Beyond the
Wall, Hie Gates of the Forest and
Legends of our Time. Currently, he is
professor of Judaic studies at the City
University of New York.
