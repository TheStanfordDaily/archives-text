Wallace, Glenn Win Primaries
Former astronaut John H. Glenn Jr. won a Democratic
Senate nomination in Ohio on his third try, and Alabama
Gov. George C. Wallace easily won renomination for an
unprecedented third term last night.
The 52-year-old Glenn, first American to orbit the earth
12 years ago, showed surprising strength in urban areas to
defeat appointed Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum in a race in
which financial disclosure was a major issue.
Metzenbaum, a wealthy Cleveland lawyer and
businessman disclosed he paid no federal income tax in
1969 because of business losses.
In Alabama, the only doubt was whether Wallace would
get more than 50 percent of the vote and thus avoid a June
4 runoff against the No. 2 finisher.
His four rivals included State Sen. Eugene McLain, who
contended Wallace was more interested in a 1976
presidential race than the governorship, and former Gov.
James E. Folsom.
SLA After Alioto Grandchildren?
SAN FRANCISCO — Three grandchildren of San
Francisco Mayor Joseph L. Alioto may have been targeted
for kidnaping by the Symbionese Liberation Army, the
mayor said last night.
He was commenting on reports an alleged member of the
SLA, which kidnaped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst
Feb. 4, was seen questioning the grandchildren while they
were playing outside their home in San Francisco about
three weeks ago.
The New York Times and San Francisco radio station
KCBS both reported last night that the woman was seen by
the mayor's daughter, Angela Veronese, mother of the
three pre-school children involved. It was also reported

Veronese later saw a car with two black men parked near
the house, apparently observing the family's living patterns.
Nixon Signs Energy Legislation
WASHINGTON — President Nixon signed legislation
creating the Federal Energy Administration yesterday and
warned of "disturbing indications that ... many Americans
believe that good conservation habits can be forgotten"
with the easing of the energy crisis.
The new, independent agency created by the legislation
will coordinate federal policy and actions in coping with
energy shortages. It replaces the Federal Energy Office.
John Sawhill, who has been assistant FEO director, will
take over today as head of the new agency when William E.
Simon is sworn in as Treasury secretary.
Sehmidt To Run In Germany
BONN, Germany — Helmut Schmidt, a tough finance
minister rated as a firm friend of the United States, won his
party's nomination yesterday to succeed West German
Chancellor Willy Brandt.
Brandt, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for improving
relations between West Germany and Communist Eastern
Europe, resigned early yesterday over an espionage scandal.
While Bonn buzzed with rumor over possible underlying
causes for Brandt's decision to accept personal
responsibility for a close aide's role as a Communist East
German spy, the 55-year-old Schmidt's nomination was
approved in an emotional session of the Social Democratic
Party's parliamentary caucus.
SAN FRANCISCO — Under heavy and unprecedented
security, a San Francisco County grand jury called a rare
Tuesday night session to hear evidence against three men
accused in the Zebra street slayings.
The young blacks — Larry C. Green, 22; J.C. Simon, 29,
and Manuel Moore, 29 — are charged with three of 13
random Zebra slayings of whites. Seven persons were
wounded in the attacks that began more than six months
ago.
They are scheduled Thursday to enter pleas in the
slayings that Mayor Joseph Alioto has called the work of a
fanatical sect of black separatists called Death Angels.
Eight witnesses were reported called before the jury
Monday night in a three-hour session conducted under
heavy guard.
Today's Weather
Coastal overcast extending inland today with local
morning drizzle but clearing partly this afternoon. Local
low cloudiness tonight, then sunny and warmer tomorrow.
Low both nights in mid 40s to low 50s. Highs today in the
upper 50s and 60s and tomorrow in the mid 60s to mid
70s.
