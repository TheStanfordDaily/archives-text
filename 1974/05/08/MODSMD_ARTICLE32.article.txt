# Trial May Legally Define Death
## 
### 
Stanford heart surgeon Norman
Shumway is scheduled to testify
Monday at a murder trial involving a
victim whose heart Shumway removed
to be transplanted after the victim was
declared neurologically dead.
Alameda County Deputy Dist.
Atty. Albert Meloling has asked
Shumway along with at least 12 other
witnesses to testify in the controversial
case, which could result in a legal
definition of death.
Meloling previously hinted that
although Shumway was directly
involved with the case, the surgeon
will only be asked to give his opinions
on death criteria and the cause of
death in this particular case.

Shumway has made no comment
about the case, except to say that the
use of heart stoppage is a "Boy Scout
definition of death."
In the case, Andrew D. Lyons, a
34-year-old car polisher, is accused of
fatally shotting Samuel Mitchell Allen,
Sept. 10 in Oakland. John F.
Cruikshank, Lyons' attorney, claims
the first degree murder charge should
be dismissed on the grounds the
victim's heart was still beating when
his brain stopped functioning and he
was declared "dead."
Meloling will try to prove that the
victim met criteria established by a
Harvard University Medical School
panel for "brain death" before the

heart was removed.
Moore's heart was taken froi.
Oakland's Highland Hospital to thi
Stanford Medical Center, where a tean
of surgeons led by Dr. Randall Griepp
transplanted the heart into Blaine
Wixom, 52, a retired constructic*
engineer from Salt Lake City.
Wixom died less than a montn later
from pneumonia and other
complications arising from the
transplant.
Jury selection was
yesterday, and the eight men and four
women selected and sworn in are
scheduled to begin hearing testimony
today.
