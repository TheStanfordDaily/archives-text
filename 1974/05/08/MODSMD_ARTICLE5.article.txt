# USE Issues Ultimatum, Demands Offer Thursday
## 
### DON COX 
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) will strike Sunday night if the
union does not receive an adequate
contract offer from the University by
Thursday afternoon at the latest, USE
President Jim Berk told the Daily last
night.
Berk said the union would "have to
strike if we don't receive anything
good by the end of Thursday since
there would be no way of calling a
general meeting" of the bargaining
unit members for a vote on a proposal
received Friday or later.
It would be "impossible" to call
such a meeting over the weekend
because of the logistical problems of
contacting all of the unit members,
Berk said.
USE members voted last week to
strike Monday if an agreement were

not reached in the contract
negotiations with the University.
University negotiator Douglas
Barton told the Daily last night that he
was not surprised at the new deadline.
"We're at a point where we are far
apart and disagree and it looks to me
that they're pretty determined.
They've set the fight for Monday and I
don't know what would sway them
from their path," Barton said. "The
rolling up of the date suggests this
also," he said.
USE and University negotiators met
throughout yesterday but reported no
significant progress had been made.
"In terms of the overall assessment,
we're a little bit closer but not
significantly closer," said Barton.
Union Demands
Berk said he would present the
University negotiators with a list of
union demands this morning that the
University would have to adequately
meet to avert a strike.
The negotiating teams will meet
again today. Berk said negotiations
would continue the rest of this week
and next week whether the union
struck or not.
USE is local 680 of the Service
Employees International Union and
represents 1400 service, technical, and
maintenance employees.
Solicit Support
Berk also confirmed that USE was
actively soliciting support among
students and faculty.
USE members walked through
dorms yesterday talking with students
about the strike and the union's
bargaining position.
"We're reaching out for all allies,"
said Berk. He said USE had also mailed
material to most faculty members
explaining their position.
Barton and Berk will address and

answer questions about their
respective negotiating positions at a
special session of the ASSU Senate at
7 Thursday night in the Physics tank.
Contingency Plans
President Richard Lyman yesterday
outlined the basics of the University's
"contingency plans" to maintain
University operations in the event of a
strike.
Plans call for the establishment of
an "Operations Center" headed by
Director of Plant Services Dan
De Young "to coordinate the
continued provision of essential
support services."
In a memorandum circulated by
University administrators, Lyman
emphasized that the University does
not want a strike but "not to plan for
the contingency of a strike would be
irresponsible."
"The University clearly is
committed to remain open and to
perform its normal teaching and
scholarly functions to the fullest
possible extent," he said.
Operations Center
DeYoung said yesterday that the
Operations Center would be primarily
for communicating and coordinating
University resources.
"Our responsibility is to plan how
to keep the University going, to
become aware of critical problems and
to marshall the forces to meet them,"
he said.
"Every department will do its best
by itself to deal with any situation,
but can turn to the Operations Center
when the situation becomes
unmanageable," DeYoung said.
In the event of a strike, DeYoung
said the University would "attempt to
avoid hiring outside people. We will
really try to keep operational with the
personnel present here," he concluded.

Operations Center
DeYoung said yesterday that the
Operations Center would be primarily
for communicating and coordinating
University resources.
"Our responsibility is to plan how
to keep the University going, to
become aware of critical problems and
to marshall the forces to meet them,"
he said.
"Every department will do its best
by itself to deal with any situation,
but can turn to the Operations Center
when the situation becomes
unmanageable," DeYoung said.
In the event of a strike, DeYoung
said the University would "attempt to
avoid hiring outside people. We will
really try to keep operational with the
personnel present here," he concluded.
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) will strike Sunday night if the
union does not receive an adequate
contract offer from the University by
Thursday afternoon at the latest, USE
President Jim Berk told the Daily last
night.
Berk said the union would "have to
strike if we don't receive anything
good by the end of Thursday since
there would be no way of calling a
general meeting" of the bargaining
unit members for a vote on a proposal
received Friday or later.
It would be "impossible" to call
such a meeting over the weekend
because of the logistical problems of
contacting all of the unit members,
Berk said.
USE members voted last week to
strike Monday if an agreement were

not reached in the contract
negotiations with the University.
University negotiator Douglas
Barton told the Daily last night that he
was not surprised at the new deadline.
"We're at a point where we are far
apart and disagree and it looks to me
that they're pretty determined.
They've set the fight for Monday and I
don't know what would sway them
from their path," Barton said. "The
rolling up of the date suggests this
also," he said.
USE and University negotiators met
throughout yesterday but reported no
significant progress had been made.
"In terms of the overall assessment,
we're a little bit closer but not
significantly closer," said Barton.
Union Demands
Berk said he would present the
University negotiators with a list of
union demands this morning that the
University would have to adequately
meet to avert a strike.
The negotiating teams will meet
again today. Berk said negotiations
would continue the rest of this week
and next week whether the union
struck or not.
USE is local 680 of the Service
Employees International Union and
represents 1400 service, technical, and
maintenance employees.
Solicit Support
Berk also confirmed that USE was
actively soliciting support among
students and faculty.
USE members walked through
dorms yesterday talking with students
about the strike and the union's
bargaining position.
"We're reaching out for all allies,"
said Berk. He said USE had also mailed
material to most faculty members
explaining their position.
Barton and Berk will address and

answer questions about their
respective negotiating positions at a
special session of the ASSU Senate at
7 Thursday night in the Physics tank.
Contingency Plans
President Richard Lyman yesterday
outlined the basics of the University's
"contingency plans" to maintain
University operations in the event of a
strike.
Plans call for the establishment of
an "Operations Center" headed by
Director of Plant Services Dan
De Young "to coordinate the
continued provision of essential
support services."
In a memorandum circulated by
University administrators, Lyman
emphasized that the University does
not want a strike but "not to plan for
the contingency of a strike would be
irresponsible."
"The University clearly is
committed to remain open and to
perform its normal teaching and
scholarly functions to the fullest
possible extent," he said.
