# Jones Charges Reveal Plans For Contributions, Concealment

### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The Watergate Special Prosecutor's charges filed last
week against Stanford trustee Thomas V. Jones reveal a
complicated plan to make, and then conceal, illegal
contributions to President Nixon's re-election campaign —
but leave several questions unanswered.
Jones, chairman and president of the Northrop Corp., a
Los Angeles aerospace concern, pleaded guilty last
Wednesday to charges that he "did aid, abet, counsel and
command" Northrop's violation of a 1940 law barring
campaign contributions by major government contractors.
He was fined $5000, as was the corporation itself.
Another defendant, Northrop Vice President James Allen,
pleaded guilty to a charge of "nonwillful violation" of the
law and was fined $1000.
The Contributions
Here is the story of the contributions, as reconstructed
from the Special Prosecutor's charges:
Between March 16, 1972 and March 4, 1974, the
Northrop Corp. contributed — directly or indirectly — some
$150,000 in corporate funds to the Finance Committee to
Re-Elect the President and its California branch. To disguise
the source of the money, it was channeled through an
unnamed European consultant associated with Northrop.
Once the money was dispatched to the consultant — and
thus officially disbursed by the corporation — it began
coming back into this country. It was speculated that some
of it might have gone directly from the consultant to the
finance committees; at least $50,000 in cash ended up in
Jones' safe.
This was the money that Jones personally handed over
to Presidential attorney Herbert W. Kalmbach in July,
1972, which was used as support money for the seven
original Watergate defendants.
Around Jan. 25, 1973 — 2V2 months after the election —

Jones arranged for the substitution of $100,000 in personal
funds to replace the Northrop money used in the
contributions. At that time, back-dated documents were
prepared in an effort to make it appear that no corporate
money had ever been involved. These documents were
shown to government agencies investigating the
contribution.
On March 15, 1973 — four months after the election,
and six weeks after the $100,000 substitution — defendant
Allen used another $24,000, obtained from the consultant,
to reimburse two senior Northrop executives for personal
contributions they had made to the Nixon effort.
This is where the chain of events specified by the Special
Prosecutor ends. Spokesmen for both the Special
Prosecutor's office and Northrop declined to explain why
the charges extend as late as March 4 of this year; there was
also no comment on whether any further charges might
come out of the investigation or whether Northrop officials
cooperated with the prosecutors in exchange for reduced
charges or sentences.
The Special Prosecutor's investigation does seem to clear
up a few points. In a statement read in open court, the
prosecutors said they had found no evidence to indicate
that Northrop either sought or received special favors from
the government in exchange for its contribution. In
addition, the investigation bore out Jones' contention that
he gave Kalmbach only $50,000 — not $75,000, as
Kalmbach had told the Senate Watergate Committee last
summer.
Unanswered Questions
But other significant questions remain unanswered;
neither the prosecutors nor Northrop will comment further,
and Jones himself has been unavailable. Among the
questions:
