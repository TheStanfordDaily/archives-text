# ASSU Nomination Committee: An Uneven Screen
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL First of Two Parts 
Serving on committees seems to be
unusually attractive to the hundreds of
students who apply for these positions
in the spring.
But just how the ASSU
Nominations Committee screens the
jumble of enthusiasts is, at best,
mystifying.
The Nominations Committee,
which places students on committees,
is perhaps "the most powerful student
committee in the University,"
according to Lise Pfeiffer, former
member of the all-student committee
and newly elected senior class
president.
The ASSU Senate generally rubber
stamps the Committee's nominees.
Then, with few exceptions, these
nominees are officially approved by
the heads of the presidential, trustee,
and academic council committees to
which the students were nominated.
Selection Practices
A measure to modify the selection
practices of the Nominations
Committee is currently bogged down
in ASSU Senate committees. The

question is whether or not it will be
voted upon by the Senate in time to
affect this year's screening process.
The measure would keep members
of the Nominations Committee from
nominating themselves to other
committees, and would prevent
students from occupying places on
more than one committee. Last spring,
four out of the seven students on the
Nominations Committee landed seats
on other prestigious committees, with
Committee member David Garvin
securing two spots.
Re-Applying
This year, two members of the
Committee, Barbara Glenn and 800
Bacon, are re-applying for the
committee seats they held this year.
Mike Herman, Committee chairman
and current ASSU president, is seeking
appointment to the Committee of 15
(C-15), a committee created several
years ago to explore alternative
campus judicial systems.
The powerful Nominations
Committee is, ironically, one of "the
easiest to get on," Pfeiffer said. For
example, at the ASSU Senate meeting
of April 9, Elena Rios running

unopposed, was appointed to the
Committee, after introducing herself
as a freshman who would "like to get
involved." A senator asked for her last
name, moved that she be appointed,
and she was.
O'Grady Elaborates
Former ASSU President, Kevin
O'Grady explained that there was
more to this incident than meets the
eye. What happens on the Senate
floor, according to O'Grady, often
reflects events that have gone on
before the meeting. "All senators
know people they'd like to interest in
trying out for committees. It's not like
she [Rios] walked in cold. Many of
the senators already knew her."
He added that if anybody else had
tried out for the Nominations
Committee on his own initiative — and
O'Grady can't remember when that
last happened — he would have been
given "a fair hearing."
Senate Nominations
This spring, the Senate appointed
two graduate students and two
undergraduates to the Nominations
Committee. Theoretically, the
competition was open to al! interested.

but in fact all four members were
hand-picked. Senators and members of
the Council of Presidents approached
their acquaintances and urged them to
apply.
Freshman Harold Sussman said,
"0'Grady suggested that I try out for
the Nominations Committee." Rios
and Glenn were asked to apply by
ASSU Sen. Rosemary Esparza.
Economics graduate student Orlando
Rodriguez said frankly, "A phone call
from a friend got me into this."
The rationale behind such pointed
recruitment is that "there is a problem
finding any graduate students to serve
anywhere," Rodriguez said, despite
efforts to notify them of openings by
stuffing their mailboxes.
'A Circus'
Two other students, also
encouraged by O'Grady to apply,
showed up at a Senate meeting where
there was no quorum for a vote. Reece
Newman, a senior philosophy major,
said he decided, "The whole thing was
a bunch of horseshit, a real circus that
I didn't want to get involved in."
