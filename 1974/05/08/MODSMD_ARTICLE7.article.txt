# ASSU Nomination Committee: An Uneven Screen
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL First of Two Parts 
Serving on committees seems to be
unusually attractive to the hundreds of
students who apply for these positions
in the spring.
But just how the ASSU
Nominations Committee screens the
jumble of enthusiasts is, at best,
mystifying.
The Nominations Committee,
which places students on committees,
is perhaps "the most powerful student
committee in the University,"
according to Lise Pfeiffer, former
member of the all-student committee
and newly elected senior class
president.
The ASSU Senate generally rubber
stamps the Committee's nominees.
Then, with few exceptions, these
nominees are officially approved by
the heads of the presidential, trustee,
and academic council committees to
which the students were nominated.
Selection Practices
A measure to modify the selection
practices of the Nominations
Committee is currently bogged down
in ASSU Senate committees. The

question is whether or not it will be
voted upon by the Senate in time to
affect this year's screening process.
The measure would keep members
of the Nominations Committee from
nominating themselves to other
committees, and would prevent
students from occupying places on
more than one committee. Last spring,
four out of the seven students on the
Nominations Committee landed seats
on other prestigious committees, with
Committee member David Garvin
securing two spots.
Re-Applying
This year, two members of the
Committee, Barbara Glenn and 800
Bacon, are re-applying for the
committee seats they held this year.
Mike Herman, Committee chairman
and current ASSU president, is seeking
appointment to the Committee of 15
(C-15), a committee created several
years ago to explore alternative
campus judicial systems.
The powerful Nominations
Committee is, ironically, one of "the
easiest to get on," Pfeiffer said. For
example, at the ASSU Senate meeting
of April 9, Elena Rios running

unopposed, was appointed to the
Committee, after introducing herself
as a freshman who would "like to get
involved." A senator asked for her last
name, moved that she be appointed,
and she was.
O'Grady Elaborates
Former ASSU President, Kevin
O'Grady explained that there was
more to this incident than meets the
eye. What happens on the Senate
floor, according to O'Grady, often
reflects events that have gone on
before the meeting. "All senators
know people they'd like to interest in
trying out for committees. It's not like
she [Rios] walked in cold. Many of
the senators already knew her."
He added that if anybody else had
tried out for the Nominations
Committee on his own initiative — and
O'Grady can't remember when that
last happened — he would have been
given "a fair hearing."
Senate Nominations
This spring, the Senate appointed
two graduate students and two
undergraduates to the Nominations
Committee. Theoretically, the
competition was open to al! interested.

but in fact all four members were
hand-picked. Senators and members of
the Council of Presidents approached
their acquaintances and urged them to
apply.
Freshman Harold Sussman said,
"0'Grady suggested that I try out for
the Nominations Committee." Rios
and Glenn were asked to apply by
ASSU Sen. Rosemary Esparza.
Economics graduate student Orlando
Rodriguez said frankly, "A phone call
from a friend got me into this."
The rationale behind such pointed
recruitment is that "there is a problem
finding any graduate students to serve
anywhere," Rodriguez said, despite
efforts to notify them of openings by
stuffing their mailboxes.
'A Circus'
Two other students, also
encouraged by O'Grady to apply,
showed up at a Senate meeting where
there was no quorum for a vote. Reece
Newman, a senior philosophy major,
said he decided, "The whole thing was
a bunch of horseshit, a real circus that
I didn't want to get involved in."

Nominations Committee discovered
the operation is a heavy time
commitment. Over a two-week span,
they are devoting more than 60 hours
interviewing the 350 applicants for
about 100 committee openings.
The number of applicants this
spring has dropped by almost 200
from last year. Herman noted he had
expected the opposite in light of the
publicity given committees during the
controversy over the proposed
emeritus housing project and the black
theme house.
Beth Garfield, former chairwoman
of the Nominations Committee and
former ASSU vice president, conceded
that her job of advertising the
committee openings was ineffective.
'The advertisements blended in with
all the other political ads," she pointed
out. "The recruiting came at the
wrong time, before next year's [the
Herman] council was elected. Last
year a lot of people applied (after the
O'Grady slate was elected) because
they knew us and wanted to work
specifically with us."
Some students point to another
reason for the decline in applicants: a
bad taste left over from last year on
the part of those who were
interviewed and turned down.
A case in point is a junior who
applied for the C-15 last year. She
described her rejection by the
Nominations Committee as "an
entirely political vote. A prime
example of ASSU junior power
politics." She claimed that O'Grady
gave her the highest rating while one
of O'Grady's opponents on the
Committee, Tom Flohr, gave her the
lowest rating.
According to jottings in Pfeiffer's
notebook, where she kept tally of
applicants, this particular interviewee
offered "no ideas." The interviewee
retorted she didn't get a chance to

speak because Flohr and O'Grady used
her interview time to argue.
In another instance, a junior
applying for the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US)
complained that her interviewers were
so preoccupied unwrapping their
sandwiches, struggling with stubborn
packets of mustard and guzzling
beverages that she felt "gypped out of
the attention I deserved."
This year the Committee, which
directly eliminated about 10 percent
of the applicant pool because of
unsatisfactory application essays, is
interviewing fewer students and
making "an attempt to be as pleasant
as possible," Herman said.
Nevertheless, according to
Rodriguez, "some people come in here
and seem to say, 'What is this? The
Inquisition all over again?' "
After questioning, each interviewer
rates the applicant on a five-point

scale. Glenn stressed the importance of
selecting a well-balanced group.
"We've heard a lot about the need for
the sexes and races to be balanced, but
we tend to forget that equal
distribution of freshmen and graduate
students is also important," she said.
Herman weighs heavily whether an!
applicant has researched the
committee for which he is applying.
He estimates 35 to 40 percent have.
One student who hadn't, came out
of his interview muttering, "I'm
butchered." He explained, "I realized
all I didn't know about the committer,
I applied for."
Remember Name
Some applicants can barely
remember the formal name of the
committee to which they are seeking
nomination. Some are simply
credential-hunting.
"One guy applied for
committees under four different
names," Pfeiffer recalled about a
candidate last year.
"Most aren't looking for
credentials," Rodriguez said,
"although it's inevitable it will happen
somewhere down the road. But there
are easier ways to come by theml
[credentials]."
Impressed
Pfeiffer said she was impressed
overall with last year's crop of
candidates. "It was so encouraging to
see so many students sincerely wanting
to h,elp out this University," she
"They felt Stanford had given them so
much. They were so good I just
wanted to hug them."
This year, "hashing out just who's
going to be nominated hasn't begun
yet," said Bacon. When it does, the
same old pressures may be brought to
bear on the selection process.
those who are weeded out may be left
unsatisfied even by a "big hug."

Serving on committees seems to be
unusually attractive to the hundreds of
students who apply for these positions
in the spring.
But just how the ASSU
Nominations Committee screens the
jumble of enthusiasts is, at best,
mystifying.
The Nominations Committee,
which places students on committees,
is perhaps "the most powerful student
committee in the University,"
according to Lise Pfeiffer, former
member of the all-student committee
and newly elected senior class
president.
The ASSU Senate generally rubber
stamps the Committee's nominees.
Then, with few exceptions, these
nominees are officially approved by
the heads of the presidential, trustee,
and academic council committees to
which the students were nominated.
Selection Practices
A measure to modify the selection
practices of the Nominations
Committee is currently bogged down
in ASSU Senate committees. The

question is whether or not it will be
voted upon by the Senate in time to
affect this year's screening process.
The measure would keep members
of the Nominations Committee from
nominating themselves to other
committees, and would prevent
students from occupying places on
more than one committee. Last spring,
four out of the seven students on the
Nominations Committee landed seats
on other prestigious committees, with
Committee member David Garvin
securing two spots.
Re-Applying
This year, two members of the
Committee, Barbara Glenn and 800
Bacon, are re-applying for the
committee seats they held this year.
Mike Herman, Committee chairman
and current ASSU president, is seeking
appointment to the Committee of 15
(C-15), a committee created several
years ago to explore alternative
campus judicial systems.
The powerful Nominations
Committee is, ironically, one of "the
easiest to get on," Pfeiffer said. For
example, at the ASSU Senate meeting
of April 9, Elena Rios running

unopposed, was appointed to the
Committee, after introducing herself
as a freshman who would "like to get
involved." A senator asked for her last
name, moved that she be appointed,
and she was.
O'Grady Elaborates
Former ASSU President, Kevin
O'Grady explained that there was
more to this incident than meets the
eye. What happens on the Senate
floor, according to O'Grady, often
reflects events that have gone on
before the meeting. "All senators
know people they'd like to interest in
trying out for committees. It's not like
she [Rios] walked in cold. Many of
the senators already knew her."
He added that if anybody else had
tried out for the Nominations
Committee on his own initiative — and
O'Grady can't remember when that
last happened — he would have been
given "a fair hearing."
Senate Nominations
This spring, the Senate appointed
two graduate students and two
undergraduates to the Nominations
Committee. Theoretically, the
competition was open to al! interested.

but in fact all four members were
hand-picked. Senators and members of
the Council of Presidents approached
their acquaintances and urged them to
apply.
Freshman Harold Sussman said,
"0'Grady suggested that I try out for
the Nominations Committee." Rios
and Glenn were asked to apply by
ASSU Sen. Rosemary Esparza.
Economics graduate student Orlando
Rodriguez said frankly, "A phone call
from a friend got me into this."
The rationale behind such pointed
recruitment is that "there is a problem
finding any graduate students to serve
anywhere," Rodriguez said, despite
efforts to notify them of openings by
stuffing their mailboxes.
'A Circus'
Two other students, also
encouraged by O'Grady to apply,
showed up at a Senate meeting where
there was no quorum for a vote. Reece
Newman, a senior philosophy major,
said he decided, "The whole thing was
a bunch of horseshit, a real circus that
I didn't want to get involved in."

Nominations Committee discovered
the operation is a heavy time
commitment. Over a two-week span,
they are devoting more than 60 hours
interviewing the 350 applicants for
about 100 committee openings.
The number of applicants this
spring has dropped by almost 200
from last year. Herman noted he had
expected the opposite in light of the
publicity given committees during the
controversy over the proposed
emeritus housing project and the black
theme house.
Beth Garfield, former chairwoman
of the Nominations Committee and
former ASSU vice president, conceded
that her job of advertising the
committee openings was ineffective.
'The advertisements blended in with
all the other political ads," she pointed
out. "The recruiting came at the
wrong time, before next year's [the
Herman] council was elected. Last
year a lot of people applied (after the
O'Grady slate was elected) because
they knew us and wanted to work
specifically with us."
Some students point to another
reason for the decline in applicants: a
bad taste left over from last year on
the part of those who were
interviewed and turned down.
A case in point is a junior who
applied for the C-15 last year. She
described her rejection by the
Nominations Committee as "an
entirely political vote. A prime
example of ASSU junior power
politics." She claimed that O'Grady
gave her the highest rating while one
of O'Grady's opponents on the
Committee, Tom Flohr, gave her the
lowest rating.
According to jottings in Pfeiffer's
notebook, where she kept tally of
applicants, this particular interviewee
offered "no ideas." The interviewee
retorted she didn't get a chance to

speak because Flohr and O'Grady used
her interview time to argue.
In another instance, a junior
applying for the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US)
complained that her interviewers were
so preoccupied unwrapping their
sandwiches, struggling with stubborn
packets of mustard and guzzling
beverages that she felt "gypped out of
the attention I deserved."
This year the Committee, which
directly eliminated about 10 percent
of the applicant pool because of
unsatisfactory application essays, is
interviewing fewer students and
making "an attempt to be as pleasant
as possible," Herman said.
Nevertheless, according to
Rodriguez, "some people come in here
and seem to say, 'What is this? The
Inquisition all over again?' "
After questioning, each interviewer
rates the applicant on a five-point

scale. Glenn stressed the importance of
selecting a well-balanced group.
"We've heard a lot about the need for
the sexes and races to be balanced, but
we tend to forget that equal
distribution of freshmen and graduate
students is also important," she said.
Herman weighs heavily whether an!
applicant has researched the
committee for which he is applying.
He estimates 35 to 40 percent have.
One student who hadn't, came out
of his interview muttering, "I'm
butchered." He explained, "I realized
all I didn't know about the committer,
I applied for."
Remember Name
Some applicants can barely
remember the formal name of the
committee to which they are seeking
nomination. Some are simply
credential-hunting.
"One guy applied for
committees under four different
names," Pfeiffer recalled about a
candidate last year.
"Most aren't looking for
credentials," Rodriguez said,
"although it's inevitable it will happen
somewhere down the road. But there
are easier ways to come by theml
[credentials]."

Serving on committees seems to be
unusually attractive to the hundreds of
students who apply for these positions
in the spring.
But just how the ASSU
Nominations Committee screens the
jumble of enthusiasts is, at best,
mystifying.
The Nominations Committee,
which places students on committees,
is perhaps "the most powerful student
committee in the University,"
according to Lise Pfeiffer, former
member of the all-student committee
and newly elected senior class
president.
The ASSU Senate generally rubber
stamps the Committee's nominees.
Then, with few exceptions, these
nominees are officially approved by
the heads of the presidential, trustee,
and academic council committees to
which the students were nominated.
Selection Practices
A measure to modify the selection
practices of the Nominations
Committee is currently bogged down
in ASSU Senate committees. The

question is whether or not it will be
voted upon by the Senate in time to
affect this year's screening process.
The measure would keep members
of the Nominations Committee from
nominating themselves to other
committees, and would prevent
students from occupying places on
more than one committee. Last spring,
four out of the seven students on the
Nominations Committee landed seats
on other prestigious committees, with
Committee member David Garvin
securing two spots.
Re-Applying
This year, two members of the
Committee, Barbara Glenn and 800
Bacon, are re-applying for the
committee seats they held this year.
Mike Herman, Committee chairman
and current ASSU president, is seeking
appointment to the Committee of 15
(C-15), a committee created several
years ago to explore alternative
campus judicial systems.
The powerful Nominations
Committee is, ironically, one of "the
easiest to get on," Pfeiffer said. For
example, at the ASSU Senate meeting
of April 9, Elena Rios running

unopposed, was appointed to the
Committee, after introducing herself
as a freshman who would "like to get
involved." A senator asked for her last
name, moved that she be appointed,
and she was.
O'Grady Elaborates
Former ASSU President, Kevin
O'Grady explained that there was
more to this incident than meets the
eye. What happens on the Senate
floor, according to O'Grady, often
reflects events that have gone on
before the meeting. "All senators
know people they'd like to interest in
trying out for committees. It's not like
she [Rios] walked in cold. Many of
the senators already knew her."
He added that if anybody else had
tried out for the Nominations
Committee on his own initiative — and
O'Grady can't remember when that
last happened — he would have been
given "a fair hearing."
Senate Nominations
This spring, the Senate appointed
two graduate students and two
undergraduates to the Nominations
Committee. Theoretically, the
competition was open to al! interested.

but in fact all four members were
hand-picked. Senators and members of
the Council of Presidents approached
their acquaintances and urged them to
apply.
Freshman Harold Sussman said,
"0'Grady suggested that I try out for
the Nominations Committee." Rios
and Glenn were asked to apply by
ASSU Sen. Rosemary Esparza.
Economics graduate student Orlando
Rodriguez said frankly, "A phone call
from a friend got me into this."
The rationale behind such pointed
recruitment is that "there is a problem
finding any graduate students to serve
anywhere," Rodriguez said, despite
efforts to notify them of openings by
stuffing their mailboxes.
'A Circus'
Two other students, also
encouraged by O'Grady to apply,
showed up at a Senate meeting where
there was no quorum for a vote. Reece
Newman, a senior philosophy major,
said he decided, "The whole thing was
a bunch of horseshit, a real circus that
I didn't want to get involved in."

Nominations Committee discovered
the operation is a heavy time
commitment. Over a two-week span,
they are devoting more than 60 hours
interviewing the 350 applicants for
about 100 committee openings.
The number of applicants this
spring has dropped by almost 200
from last year. Herman noted he had
expected the opposite in light of the
publicity given committees during the
controversy over the proposed
emeritus housing project and the black
theme house.
Beth Garfield, former chairwoman
of the Nominations Committee and
former ASSU vice president, conceded
that her job of advertising the
committee openings was ineffective.
'The advertisements blended in with
all the other political ads," she pointed
out. "The recruiting came at the
wrong time, before next year's [the
Herman] council was elected. Last
year a lot of people applied (after the
O'Grady slate was elected) because
they knew us and wanted to work
specifically with us."
Some students point to another
reason for the decline in applicants: a
bad taste left over from last year on
the part of those who were
interviewed and turned down.
A case in point is a junior who
applied for the C-15 last year. She
described her rejection by the
Nominations Committee as "an
entirely political vote. A prime
example of ASSU junior power
politics." She claimed that O'Grady
gave her the highest rating while one
of O'Grady's opponents on the
Committee, Tom Flohr, gave her the
lowest rating.
According to jottings in Pfeiffer's
notebook, where she kept tally of
applicants, this particular interviewee
offered "no ideas." The interviewee
retorted she didn't get a chance to

speak because Flohr and O'Grady used
her interview time to argue.
In another instance, a junior
applying for the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US)
complained that her interviewers were
so preoccupied unwrapping their
sandwiches, struggling with stubborn
packets of mustard and guzzling
beverages that she felt "gypped out of
the attention I deserved."
This year the Committee, which
directly eliminated about 10 percent
of the applicant pool because of
unsatisfactory application essays, is
interviewing fewer students and
making "an attempt to be as pleasant
as possible," Herman said.
Nevertheless, according to
Rodriguez, "some people come in here
and seem to say, 'What is this? The
Inquisition all over again?' "
After questioning, each interviewer
rates the applicant on a five-point

scale. Glenn stressed the importance of
selecting a well-balanced group.
"We've heard a lot about the need for
the sexes and races to be balanced, but
we tend to forget that equal
distribution of freshmen and graduate
students is also important," she said.
Herman weighs heavily whether an!
applicant has researched the
committee for which he is applying.
He estimates 35 to 40 percent have.
One student who hadn't, came out

Remember Name
Some applicants can barely

committee to which they are seeking
nomination. Some are simply

"One guy applied for
committees under four different
names," Pfeiffer recalled about a

"Most aren't looking for

Impressed
Pfeiffer said she was impressed
overall with last year's crop of
candidates. "It was so encouraging to
see so many students sincerely wanting
to h,elp out this University," she
"They felt Stanford had given them so
much. They were so good I just
wanted to hug them."

same old pressures may be brought to

Serving on committees seems to be
unusually attractive to the hundreds of
students who apply for these positions
in the spring.
But just how the ASSU
Nominations Committee screens the
jumble of enthusiasts is, at best,
mystifying.
The Nominations Committee,
which places students on committees,
is perhaps "the most powerful student
committee in the University,"
according to Lise Pfeiffer, former
member of the all-student committee
and newly elected senior class
president.
The ASSU Senate generally rubber
stamps the Committee's nominees.
Then, with few exceptions, these
nominees are officially approved by
the heads of the presidential, trustee,
and academic council committees to
which the students were nominated.
Selection Practices
A measure to modify the selection
practices of the Nominations
Committee is currently bogged down
in ASSU Senate committees. The

question is whether or not it will be
voted upon by the Senate in time to
affect this year's screening process.
The measure would keep members
of the Nominations Committee from
nominating themselves to other
committees, and would prevent
students from occupying places on
more than one committee. Last spring,
four out of the seven students on the
Nominations Committee landed seats
on other prestigious committees, with
Committee member David Garvin
securing two spots.
Re-Applying
This year, two members of the
Committee, Barbara Glenn and 800
Bacon, are re-applying for the
committee seats they held this year.
Mike Herman, Committee chairman
and current ASSU president, is seeking
appointment to the Committee of 15
(C-15), a committee created several
years ago to explore alternative
campus judicial systems.
The powerful Nominations
Committee is, ironically, one of "the
easiest to get on," Pfeiffer said. For
example, at the ASSU Senate meeting
of April 9, Elena Rios running

unopposed, was appointed to the
Committee, after introducing herself
as a freshman who would "like to get
involved." A senator asked for her last
name, moved that she be appointed,
and she was.
O'Grady Elaborates
Former ASSU President, Kevin
O'Grady explained that there was
more to this incident than meets the
eye. What happens on the Senate
floor, according to O'Grady, often
reflects events that have gone on
before the meeting. "All senators
know people they'd like to interest in
trying out for committees. It's not like
she [Rios] walked in cold. Many of
the senators already knew her."
He added that if anybody else had
tried out for the Nominations
Committee on his own initiative — and
O'Grady can't remember when that
last happened — he would have been
given "a fair hearing."
Senate Nominations
This spring, the Senate appointed
two graduate students and two
undergraduates to the Nominations
Committee. Theoretically, the
competition was open to al! interested.

but in fact all four members were
hand-picked. Senators and members of
the Council of Presidents approached
their acquaintances and urged them to
apply.
Freshman Harold Sussman said,
"0'Grady suggested that I try out for
the Nominations Committee." Rios
and Glenn were asked to apply by
ASSU Sen. Rosemary Esparza.
Economics graduate student Orlando
Rodriguez said frankly, "A phone call
from a friend got me into this."
The rationale behind such pointed
recruitment is that "there is a problem
finding any graduate students to serve
anywhere," Rodriguez said, despite
efforts to notify them of openings by
stuffing their mailboxes.
'A Circus'
Two other students, also
encouraged by O'Grady to apply,
showed up at a Senate meeting where
there was no quorum for a vote. Reece
Newman, a senior philosophy major,
said he decided, "The whole thing was
a bunch of horseshit, a real circus that
I didn't want to get involved in."

Nominations Committee discovered
the operation is a heavy time
commitment. Over a two-week span,
they are devoting more than 60 hours
interviewing the 350 applicants for
about 100 committee openings.
The number of applicants this
spring has dropped by almost 200
from last year. Herman noted he had
expected the opposite in light of the
publicity given committees during the
controversy over the proposed
emeritus housing project and the black
theme house.
Beth Garfield, former chairwoman
of the Nominations Committee and
former ASSU vice president, conceded
that her job of advertising the
committee openings was ineffective.
'The advertisements blended in with
all the other political ads," she pointed
out. "The recruiting came at the
wrong time, before next year's [the
Herman] council was elected. Last
year a lot of people applied (after the
O'Grady slate was elected) because
they knew us and wanted to work
specifically with us."
Some students point to another
reason for the decline in applicants: a
bad taste left over from last year on
the part of those who were
interviewed and turned down.
A case in point is a junior who
applied for the C-15 last year. She
described her rejection by the
Nominations Committee as "an
entirely political vote. A prime
example of ASSU junior power
politics." She claimed that O'Grady
gave her the highest rating while one
of O'Grady's opponents on the
Committee, Tom Flohr, gave her the
lowest rating.
According to jottings in Pfeiffer's
notebook, where she kept tally of
applicants, this particular interviewee
offered "no ideas." The interviewee
retorted she didn't get a chance to

speak because Flohr and O'Grady used
her interview time to argue.
In another instance, a junior
applying for the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US)
complained that her interviewers were
so preoccupied unwrapping their
sandwiches, struggling with stubborn
packets of mustard and guzzling
beverages that she felt "gypped out of
the attention I deserved."
This year the Committee, which
directly eliminated about 10 percent
of the applicant pool because of
unsatisfactory application essays, is
interviewing fewer students and
making "an attempt to be as pleasant
as possible," Herman said.
Nevertheless, according to
Rodriguez, "some people come in here
and seem to say, 'What is this? The
Inquisition all over again?' "
After questioning, each interviewer
