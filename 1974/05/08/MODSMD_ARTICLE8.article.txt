# Nixon's Guilt

Two days before Watergate
burglar James McCord was
sentenced to jail fop breaking into
the Democratic National
Headquarters, President Nixon
learned that McCord's conviction
involved perjured testimony. Did
Nixon immediately inform Judge
John Sirica of this new
information, as the law requires?
No, he did not, and in failing to
do so Nixon committed a crime.
This crime is just one of many
to which Nixon has, in effect,
confessed in the White House
transcripts.
When Nixon learned that an
illegal burglary had been carried
out in the office of Ellsberg's
psychiatrist, did he inform
Matthew Byrne, the presiding
judge in the Pentagon Papers case,
of this fact?
On the contrary, he offered to
make Judge Byrne the director of
the FBI, as soon as the Ellsberg
case was satisfactorily disposed of.
Both the failure to report a felony
and the attempted bribe are
crimes.
Hush Money
On March 21, 1973, Nixon
told John Dean that "the prime
thing that you damn well better
get... done" is to pay Hunt the
hush money he is demanding, and
to pay it "damn soon ... to keep
the cap on the bottle." The
payment of hush money, which
was carried out later that day, is a
crime.
In that same March 21
conversation Nixon instructed
Dean and Haldeman on how to
commit perjury before the Senate
Watergate Committee: "You can
say 'I don't remember.' You can
say 'I can't recall. I can't give any
answer to that that I can recall.' "
Subornation of perjury is also a
crime.
In spite of protestations that
he continually sought to find out
what was going on, Nixon told

John Ehrlichman on April 16,
1973 that "the point is you've
now told me. That's the
problem. .. . See, the difference is
that the problem of my position
up to this time has been quite
frankly, nobody ever told me a
damn bit of this, that Mitchell was
guilty.
Learned 'Accidently'
Once Nixon had learned
"accidently" what he had made a
concerted effort not to find out,
he pragmatically determined that
to save himself he would have to
sacrifice someone, and he showed
no trace of emotion in deciding
that his trusted friend, John
Mitchell, was the one to sacrifice:
"Look, if they get a hell of a big
fish, that is going to take a lot of
fire out of this thing on the
coverup and all that sort. If they
get the President's former law
partner and attorney general, you
know."
Only a month earlier, on March
21, Nixon had praised Mitchell's
handling of the coverup, saying
that he, Mitchell, "handled it just
right. [He] contained it. And now
after the election we have to have
another plan." One coverup
before the election, another one
after.
On the basis of the President's
own sanitized and expurgated
transcripts, one may cite endless
examples of overt criminal acts
which Nixon himself committed.
There is no longer any puzzle over
why the Watergate Grand Jury
wanted to indict Nixon, nor why
Nixon was so unwilling to release
those tapes which had not been
"lost" or erased by mysterious
forces.
It is now time to "put
Watergate behind us," but this can
only be done by putting Nixon in
jail, where he, Agnew and all
other crooks belong.
