# On Flores Case
##

Harold Kahn

The political and academic
aspects of the Juan Flores tenure
case are too important to ignore.
On the surface it appears to be a
case of publish and perish. Flores'
mistake was that he published too
well, too soon.
Had his book, Poetry in East
Germany, been issued this year
rather than three years before the
tenure decision was due, the little
minds in the Dean's office that
count titles rather than account
for quality would have had to
discover another excuse for
excusing him. For the book
received critical acclaim not just
in the trade journals but in
literary establishment circles too.
Assistant professors whose first
books appear too soon are
vulnerable. Look in contrast at
the History Department. Only
four or five out of the current
fourteen tenured associate
professors had even one book
published before they were given
tenure.
And if the unspoken rules have
changed to prevent that in the
future, it remains compellingly
true that "marketplace" strategy
compels ambitious young scholars
to time their publications right.
Books in the academy are meant
to be seen, not read.
More Than Stupidity
If Flores were victim only of
this "time-motion" stupidity, we
could sit back and agree how
irrational it all is. But I believe the
decision against him was very

rational â€” and very political. He is
being let go not because he is a
Marxist but because he is a
communist.
The academy loves tame
Marxologists: they give false
credence to the idea of the
marketplace of ideas. But
practicing Marxist revolutionaries
are another thing altogether. They
threaten the very concept of the
marketplace and take seriously
the intellectual responsibility to
act as well as to think.
Juan Flores was arrested in
the Stanford Hospital sit-in three
years ago; and again two years ago
in another demonstration. People
now in the Provost's and Dean's
offices who make or affirm tenure
decisions were active, bitter
opponents of the demonstrators.
It would be interesting to go
back and review the attitudes of
Deans Royden and Spitz, for
example, and Provosts Rosensweig
and Miller, toward Flores and his
role as a faculty member in those
political actions. Unquiet rumor
insists that one of our colleagues,
close to decisions in German
Studies, wrote a letter at the time
of the Hospital action urging or
suggesting that Flores be fired.
One keeps wondering when
administrative decisions, coated in
respectable "academic" garb, will
be seen for the naked political
acts they often really are.
