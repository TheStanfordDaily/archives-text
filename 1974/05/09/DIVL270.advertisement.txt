For the session starting July, 1974.
Euromed will assist qualified Amer
ican students in gaining admission
to recognized overseas medical
schools.
And that's just the beginning.
Since the language barrier constitutes
the preponderate difficulty in succeed
ing at a foreign school, the Euromed
program also includes an intensive
12-16 week medical and conversa
tional language course, mandatory for
all students. Five hours daily, 5 days
per week (12-16 weeks) the course is
given in the country where the student
will attend medical school.
In addition, Euromed provides stu
dents with a 12-16 week intensive cul
tural orientation program, with Amer
ican students now studying medicine
in that particular country serving as
counselors.
Senior or fradmte students currently
enrolled in an American university are
eligible to participate in the Euromed
program.
