# USE, University Prepare For Threatened Strike
## Negotiators Still Far Apart 
### DON COX 
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) union and the University lie far
apart with respect to the contract
♦erms they are negotiating — so far
apart, in fact, that USE may decide
this afternoon to strike Monday.
USE has said it will strike Monday
if it does not receive an adequate offer
from the University by this afternoon.
USE is local 680 of the Service
Employees International Union and
Represents 1400 service, technical, and
maintenance employees. USE and the
University have been engaged in
contract negotiations since December.
As in most contract negotiations,
the major issues in contention are
economic, though there are equally
important non-economic issues that
jhave hung up negotiations for some
time.
USE is demanding average
economic gains of 22.75 percent for
the bargaining unit it represents. By
USE's own approximations, this would
boost the wage base for the bargaining
unit it represents from $12.9 to almost

$16 million per year.
The University responded to union
demands with an offer to give workers
wage increases averaging six-and-a-half
to seven percent, thereby boosting the
unit wage base by about $750,000.
Economic Demands
Union demands for a higher
minimum monthly pay rate, a cost of
living escalator, and a community
standards clause make up about
two-thirds of the $2.2 million
difference separating the two parties.
University negotiators say that
union estimates of the cost of the
economic package to the University
are somewhat conservative and that
their demands represent at least a 25
percent increase.
USE is also asking for
non-economic items including a union
shop, a maintenance of standards
clause, increased sick leave, and revised
layoff procedures.
Most of these items are sharply
contested by the University.

"significant effect" on Plant Services
operations.
Rely On Supervisors
University Housing is relying on
Plant Services supervisors to respond
to plumbing and electrical problems,
said Alan Cummings, student housing
manager.
"We should be able to respond to
most emergencies," Cummings said,
but "there is no way we can provide
anywhere near the present level of
service."
All custodians are members of the
bargaining unit, and Cummings is
preparing for the possibility that all of
them may strike. In that case,
"Custodial supervisors will try to keep
supplies (i.e., toilet paper, cleaning
supplies, paper towels] in the
commons areas of dorms, and hope
students will clean up a little by
themselves," Cummings said.
Row houses and fraternities have
been advised that the University plans
to deliver supplies from the
commissary, but that the houses
should stockpile canned goods. It
might become necessary to buy
supplies in nearby shopping areas if
the commissary becomes inaccessible
because of pickets, Cummings
explained.
Supplies Distribution
University Stores, responsible for
distributing supplies, will try to
maintain service using supervisory
personnel. Storekeeper Melvin L. Perry
indicated * that "supplies are
sufficiently stockpiled to meet the
needs of the University for some
time."
Stores' first priority will be keeping
Stanford Hospital supplied. "We hope
USE will permit the delivery of
material to tne hospital," he said.
At the Stanford Hospital, Personnel
Services Director James Moore
emphasized that "vital patient care"
would continue regardless of a strike,
according to a plan similar to that used
in case of natural disaster.
Supervisory personnel would step
into roles vacated during a walk-out,
Moore said.
"USE would like to tie up the
hospital," he claimed. However, USE
negotiator Dennis Davie told last
night's audience in Roble that USE
would not picket the hospital.
In the School of Medicine itself,
Assoc. Dean for Administration
Richard Balch said he had "no idea
how many employees total will leave."
About 200 life-science technicians and
animal caretakers may walk out

Monday.
Should a large percentage of these
research technicians leave the Medical
School, "vital ongoing research" in
areas such as cancer treatment and
biochemistry could be interrupted and
perhaps destroyed, Balch said.
The school will staff these projects
"with myself and others if there is no
other way," he said, adding that many
students have been asked to assume
technician roles. "It's a voluntary
situation," he concluded.
The school will keep operating and
classes will continue as scheduled,
Balch stated.
Other Plans
SLAC, SCIP and Hansen
Laboratories are also making plans to

deal with a strike.
At SLAC, the problem is doubly
difficult. SLAC plans to start the
accelerator next week (it is only used
part of the year).
According to Assoc. Director
Joseph Bellam, "We think we'll be able
to bring up the beam with supervisory
personnel. Our plans are to go ahead
and run the experiment schedule as
planned. Obviously, this will be very
difficult."
'Some Deterioration'
SCIP Director Charles R. Dickens
says he is sure there will be some
deterioration in service. All regular
computer operators are members of
the bargaining unit, and Dickens says
that "longer range development

projects may be suspended." However,
the normal computer service is
scheduled to continue.
Likewise, at Hansen Labs "some
jobs will be delayed," according to
Director Marshall O'Neill. He
anticipates being able to maintain
operations at a level necessary to fulfill
contractual obligations to research
sponsors.
Members of the Stanford Police
Officers Association and Firefighters
Association have contracts which
forbid them from striking.
In the event of a strike, Police
Marvin Herrington plans to keep the
department "more on the alert. Our
reaction depends on the actions of the
strikers."

supplies (i.e., toilet paper, cleaning
supplies, paper towels] in the
commons areas of dorms, and hope
students will clean up a little by
themselves," Cummings said.
Row houses and fraternities have
been advised that the University plans
to deliver supplies from the
commissary, but that the houses
should stockpile canned goods. It
might become necessary to buy
supplies in nearby shopping areas if
the commissary becomes inaccessible
because of pickets, Cummings
explained.
Supplies Distribution
University Stores, responsible for
distributing supplies, will try to
maintain service using supervisory
personnel. Storekeeper Melvin L. Perry
indicated * that "supplies are
sufficiently stockpiled to meet the
needs of the University for some
time."
Stores' first priority will be keeping
Stanford Hospital supplied. "We hope
USE will permit the delivery of
material to tne hospital," he said.
At the Stanford Hospital, Personnel
Services Director James Moore
emphasized that "vital patient care"
would continue regardless of a strike,
according to a plan similar to that used
in case of natural disaster.
Supervisory personnel would step
into roles vacated during a walk-out,
Moore said.
"USE would like to tie up the
hospital," he claimed. However, USE
negotiator Dennis Davie told last
night's audience in Roble that USE
would not picket the hospital.
In the School of Medicine itself,
Assoc. Dean for Administration
Richard Balch said he had "no idea
how many employees total will leave."
About 200 life-science technicians and
animal caretakers may walk out

Monday.
Should a large percentage of these
research technicians leave the Medical
School, "vital ongoing research" in
areas such as cancer treatment and
biochemistry could be interrupted and
perhaps destroyed, Balch said.
The school will staff these projects
"with myself and others if there is no
other way," he said, adding that many
students have been asked to assume
technician roles. "It's a voluntary
situation," he concluded.
The school will keep operating and
classes will continue as scheduled,
Balch stated.
Other Plans
SLAC, SCIP and Hansen
Laboratories are also making plans to

deal with a strike.
At SLAC, the problem is doubly
difficult. SLAC plans to start the
accelerator next week (it is only used
part of the year).
According to Assoc. Director
Joseph Bellam, "We think we'll be able
to bring up the beam with supervisory
personnel. Our plans are to go ahead
and run the experiment schedule as
planned. Obviously, this will be very
difficult."
'Some Deterioration'
SCIP Director Charles R. Dickens
says he is sure there will be some
deterioration in service. All regular
computer operators are members of
the bargaining unit, and Dickens says
that "longer range development

projects may be suspended." However,
the normal computer service is
scheduled to continue.
Likewise, at Hansen Labs "some
jobs will be delayed," according to
Director Marshall O'Neill. He
anticipates being able to maintain
operations at a level necessary to fulfill
contractual obligations to research
sponsors.
Members of the Stanford Police
Officers Association and Firefighters
Association have contracts which
forbid them from striking.
In the event of a strike, Police
Marvin Herrington plans to keep the
department "more on the alert. Our
reaction depends on the actions of the
strikers."
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) union and the University lie far
apart with respect to the contract
♦erms they are negotiating — so far
apart, in fact, that USE may decide
this afternoon to strike Monday.
USE has said it will strike Monday
if it does not receive an adequate offer
from the University by this afternoon.
USE is local 680 of the Service
Employees International Union and
Represents 1400 service, technical, and
maintenance employees. USE and the
University have been engaged in
contract negotiations since December.
As in most contract negotiations,
the major issues in contention are
economic, though there are equally
important non-economic issues that
jhave hung up negotiations for some
time.
USE is demanding average
economic gains of 22.75 percent for
the bargaining unit it represents. By
USE's own approximations, this would
boost the wage base for the bargaining
unit it represents from $12.9 to almost

$16 million per year.
The University responded to union
demands with an offer to give workers
wage increases averaging six-and-a-half
to seven percent, thereby boosting the
unit wage base by about $750,000.
Economic Demands
Union demands for a higher
minimum monthly pay rate, a cost of
living escalator, and a community
standards clause make up about
two-thirds of the $2.2 million
difference separating the two parties.
University negotiators say that
union estimates of the cost of the
economic package to the University
are somewhat conservative and that
their demands represent at least a 25
percent increase.
USE is also asking for
non-economic items including a union
shop, a maintenance of standards
clause, increased sick leave, and revised
layoff procedures.
Most of these items are sharply
contested by the University.

'Some Deterioration'
SCIP Director Charles R. Dickens
says he is sure there will be some
deterioration in service. All regular
computer operators are members of
the bargaining unit, and Dickens says
that "longer range development

projects may be suspended." However,
the normal computer service is
scheduled to continue.
Likewise, at Hansen Labs "some
jobs will be delayed," according to
Director Marshall O'Neill. He
anticipates being able to maintain
operations at a level necessary to fulfill
contractual obligations to research
sponsors.
Members of the Stanford Police
Officers Association and Firefighters
Association have contracts which
forbid them from striking.
In the event of a strike, Police
Marvin Herrington plans to keep the
department "more on the alert. Our
reaction depends on the actions of the
strikers."
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) union and the University lie far
apart with respect to the contract
♦erms they are negotiating — so far
apart, in fact, that USE may decide
this afternoon to strike Monday.
USE has said it will strike Monday
if it does not receive an adequate offer
from the University by this afternoon.
USE is local 680 of the Service
Employees International Union and
Represents 1400 service, technical, and
maintenance employees. USE and the
University have been engaged in
contract negotiations since December.
As in most contract negotiations,
the major issues in contention are
economic, though there are equally
important non-economic issues that
jhave hung up negotiations for some
time.
USE is demanding average
economic gains of 22.75 percent for
the bargaining unit it represents. By
USE's own approximations, this would
boost the wage base for the bargaining
unit it represents from $12.9 to almost

$16 million per year.
The University responded to union
demands with an offer to give workers
wage increases averaging six-and-a-half
to seven percent, thereby boosting the
unit wage base by about $750,000.
Economic Demands
Union demands for a higher
minimum monthly pay rate, a cost of
living escalator, and a community
standards clause make up about
two-thirds of the $2.2 million
difference separating the two parties.
University negotiators say that
union estimates of the cost of the
economic package to the University
are somewhat conservative and that
their demands represent at least a 25
percent increase.
USE is also asking for
non-economic items including a union
shop, a maintenance of standards
clause, increased sick leave, and revised
layoff procedures.
Most of these items are sharply
contested by the University.
The lowest paid workers in the

"significant effect" on Plant Services
operations.
Rely On Supervisors
University Housing is relying on
Plant Services supervisors to respond
to plumbing and electrical problems,
said Alan Cummings, student housing
manager.
"We should be able to respond to
most emergencies," Cummings said,
but "there is no way we can provide
anywhere near the present level of
service."
All custodians are members of the
bargaining unit, and Cummings is
preparing for the possibility that all of
them may strike. In that case,
"Custodial supervisors will try to keep
supplies (i.e., toilet paper, cleaning
supplies, paper towels] in the
commons areas of dorms, and hope
students will clean up a little by
themselves," Cummings said.
Row houses and fraternities have
been advised that the University plans
to deliver supplies from the
commissary, but that the houses
should stockpile canned goods. It
might become necessary to buy
supplies in nearby shopping areas if
the commissary becomes inaccessible
because of pickets, Cummings
explained.
Supplies Distribution
University Stores, responsible for
distributing supplies, will try to
maintain service using supervisory
personnel. Storekeeper Melvin L. Perry
indicated * that "supplies are
sufficiently stockpiled to meet the
needs of the University for some
time."
Stores' first priority will be keeping
Stanford Hospital supplied. "We hope
USE will permit the delivery of
material to tne hospital," he said.
At the Stanford Hospital, Personnel
Services Director James Moore
emphasized that "vital patient care"
would continue regardless of a strike,
according to a plan similar to that used
in case of natural disaster.
Supervisory personnel would step
into roles vacated during a walk-out,
Moore said.
"USE would like to tie up the
hospital," he claimed. However, USE
negotiator Dennis Davie told last
night's audience in Roble that USE
would not picket the hospital.
In the School of Medicine itself,
Assoc. Dean for Administration
Richard Balch said he had "no idea
how many employees total will leave."
About 200 life-science technicians and
animal caretakers may walk out

Monday.
Should a large percentage of these
research technicians leave the Medical
School, "vital ongoing research" in
areas such as cancer treatment and
biochemistry could be interrupted and
perhaps destroyed, Balch said.
The school will staff these projects
"with myself and others if there is no
other way," he said, adding that many
students have been asked to assume
technician roles. "It's a voluntary
situation," he concluded.
The school will keep operating and
classes will continue as scheduled,
Balch stated.
Other Plans
SLAC, SCIP and Hansen
Laboratories are also making plans to

deal with a strike.
At SLAC, the problem is doubly
difficult. SLAC plans to start the
accelerator next week (it is only used
part of the year).
According to Assoc. Director
Joseph Bellam, "We think we'll be able
to bring up the beam with supervisory
personnel. Our plans are to go ahead
and run the experiment schedule as
planned. Obviously, this will be very
difficult."
