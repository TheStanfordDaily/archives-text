# USE, University Prepare For Threatened Strike
## Negotiators Still Far Apart 
### DON COX 
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) union and the University lie far
apart with respect to the contract
♦erms they are negotiating — so far
apart, in fact, that USE may decide
this afternoon to strike Monday.
USE has said it will strike Monday
if it does not receive an adequate offer
from the University by this afternoon.
USE is local 680 of the Service
Employees International Union and
Represents 1400 service, technical, and
maintenance employees. USE and the
University have been engaged in
contract negotiations since December.
As in most contract negotiations,
the major issues in contention are
economic, though there are equally
important non-economic issues that
jhave hung up negotiations for some
time.
USE is demanding average
economic gains of 22.75 percent for
the bargaining unit it represents. By
USE's own approximations, this would
boost the wage base for the bargaining
unit it represents from $12.9 to almost

$16 million per year.
The University responded to union
demands with an offer to give workers
wage increases averaging six-and-a-half
to seven percent, thereby boosting the
unit wage base by about $750,000.
Economic Demands
Union demands for a higher
minimum monthly pay rate, a cost of
living escalator, and a community
standards clause make up about
two-thirds of the $2.2 million
difference separating the two parties.
University negotiators say that
union estimates of the cost of the
economic package to the University
are somewhat conservative and that
their demands represent at least a 25
percent increase.
USE is also asking for
non-economic items including a union
shop, a maintenance of standards
clause, increased sick leave, and revised
layoff procedures.
Most of these items are sharply
contested by the University.
