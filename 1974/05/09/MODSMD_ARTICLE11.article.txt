# E. A. Ross' Ideological Position
## 
### 
Bill Evers

Edward Alsworth Ross is known to many
at Stanford as a professor who was fired in
the early days of the University because Jane
Stanford disagreed with Ross'
unconventional views on social and economic
questions. Some people have drawn parallels
between Ross' case and the firing of Prof.
Bruce Franklin.
Whiie this much is generally known about
Ross, few people have a picture of the
ideological position of Ross as a social
theorist. Ross was an immigration
restrictionist, nativist, and prohibitionist
whose unifying global outlook called for
Bismarckian welfare state capitalism.
In Roger Daniels' study of the California
anti-Japanese movement, he says that "Ross
was the most conspicuous exception to the
general rule . .. that California university
professors and presidents were opponents of
anti-Japanese measures."
In 1900, Ross was reported in a San
Francisco newspaper as having declared at a
meeting that "should the worse come to the
worst it would be better for us to train our
guns on every vessel bringing Japanese to our
shores rather than to permit them to land."
Active Restrictionist
During the first two decades of the
twentieth century, Ross was active in the
cause of immigration restriction. He had a
scientific interest in questions of the effect of
heredity and environment on races and
cultures.
But he illogically developed out of this
scholarly interest a political belief in
government-enforced racial supremacy and
ending the freedom of individuals to

immigrate into the United States.
Ross called the immigrants from Southern
and Eastern Europe — the Italians, the Slavs,
and the Russian Jews — "beaten men of
beaten breeds" and "cheap stucco
mannikins." He complained that the children
of these new immigrants would not "really
take the place of the unbegotten sons of the
granite men who fell at Gettysburg and Cold
Harbor."
Saw 'Collective Entities'
Because of his philosophical predilections,
Ross could see only collective entities. He
saw America as a Teutonic tribe being
invaded by other tribes. Because of his
anti-individualism, he was eager to end
freedom of travel and migration in order to
prevent what he called "race suicide."
Ross took a neo-Malthusian approach
toward fertility, population growth, and food
production. Since he combined this with a
racialistic perspective, he endorsed Madison
Grant's The Passing of the Great Race and
Lothrop Stoddard's Rising Tide of Color. He
considered child-bearing by persons with
defective genes "a crime against society."
Because Ross looked at all political
questions from the viewpoint of a social
engineer who intended to mold and shape
people like objects, he neglected the right of
people to make their own choices about
raising children. Imposing politically a
standard of genetic normality is a serious
invasion of liberty.
Active Prohibitionist
During the first quarter of the twentieth
century, Ross was active in the movement to
prohibit alcoholic beverages. He believed that

the Anglo-Saxon race had not adapted to
alcohol consumption, whereas
Mediterraneans had. Again, Ross was
unwilling to let individual persons make the
choices and take the consequences.
Ross' position on such issues as alcohol
prohibition and immigration was integrated
with his over-all belief in a sort of
Bismarckian statism.
Historian Gabriel Kolko points out that
"thousands of key*academics" from America
studied in Germany in the late nineteenth cen
tury. There they absorbed and Americanized
the "Bismarckian idealization of the state,
with its centralized welfare functions designed
to preserve capitalism and the status quo in its
more fundamental aspects."
Among these thousands of academics were
Ross and more importantly Ross' teacher and
mentor, Richard T. Ely. Ely's welfare state
capitalism' (a mixtureof socialism • and
capitalism) and the parallel views of Lester F.
Ward were the greatest intellectual influences
on Ross' thinking.
Once one sees Ross as aspiring to be the
adviser to some future benevolent social
planner, then one can understand why he
wanted to manipulate racial characteristics or
interfere with people's drinking habits. He
also did not want free choices to immigrate
to interfere with his plans for labor unions or
public schools. He wanted to control people
and plan their lives. Of course, he wanted to
do it for their own good.

people to make their own choices about
raising children. Imposing politically a
standard of genetic normality is a serious
invasion of liberty.
Active Prohibitionist
During the first quarter of the twentieth
century, Ross was active in the movement to
prohibit alcoholic beverages. He believed that

the Anglo-Saxon race had not adapted to
alcohol consumption, whereas
Mediterraneans had. Again, Ross was
unwilling to let individual persons make the
choices and take the consequences.
Ross' position on such issues as alcohol
prohibition and immigration was integrated
with his over-all belief in a sort of
Bismarckian statism.
Historian Gabriel Kolko points out that
"thousands of key*academics" from America
studied in Germany in the late nineteenth cen
tury. There they absorbed and Americanized
the "Bismarckian idealization of the state,
with its centralized welfare functions designed
to preserve capitalism and the status quo in its
more fundamental aspects."
Among these thousands of academics were
Ross and more importantly Ross' teacher and
mentor, Richard T. Ely. Ely's welfare state
capitalism' (a mixtureof socialism • and
capitalism) and the parallel views of Lester F.
Ward were the greatest intellectual influences
on Ross' thinking.
Once one sees Ross as aspiring to be the
adviser to some future benevolent social
planner, then one can understand why he
wanted to manipulate racial characteristics or
interfere with people's drinking habits. He
also did not want free choices to immigrate
to interfere with his plans for labor unions or
public schools. He wanted to control people
and plan their lives. Of course, he wanted to
do it for their own good.

Edward Alsworth Ross is known to many
at Stanford as a professor who was fired in
the early days of the University because Jane
Stanford disagreed with Ross'
unconventional views on social and economic
questions. Some people have drawn parallels
between Ross' case and the firing of Prof.
Bruce Franklin.
Whiie this much is generally known about
Ross, few people have a picture of the
ideological position of Ross as a social
theorist. Ross was an immigration
restrictionist, nativist, and prohibitionist
whose unifying global outlook called for
Bismarckian welfare state capitalism.
In Roger Daniels' study of the California
anti-Japanese movement, he says that "Ross
was the most conspicuous exception to the
general rule . .. that California university
professors and presidents were opponents of
anti-Japanese measures."
In 1900, Ross was reported in a San
Francisco newspaper as having declared at a
meeting that "should the worse come to the
worst it would be better for us to train our
guns on every vessel bringing Japanese to our
shores rather than to permit them to land."
Active Restrictionist
During the first two decades of the
twentieth century, Ross was active in the
cause of immigration restriction. He had a
scientific interest in questions of the effect of
heredity and environment on races and
cultures.
But he illogically developed out of this
scholarly interest a political belief in
government-enforced racial supremacy and
ending the freedom of individuals to

immigrate into the United States.
Ross called the immigrants from Southern
and Eastern Europe — the Italians, the Slavs,
and the Russian Jews — "beaten men of
beaten breeds" and "cheap stucco
mannikins." He complained that the children
of these new immigrants would not "really
take the place of the unbegotten sons of the
granite men who fell at Gettysburg and Cold
Harbor."
Saw 'Collective Entities'
Because of his philosophical predilections,
Ross could see only collective entities. He
saw America as a Teutonic tribe being
invaded by other tribes. Because of his
anti-individualism, he was eager to end
freedom of travel and migration in order to
prevent what he called "race suicide."
Ross took a neo-Malthusian approach
toward fertility, population growth, and food
production. Since he combined this with a
racialistic perspective, he endorsed Madison
Grant's The Passing of the Great Race and
Lothrop Stoddard's Rising Tide of Color. He
considered child-bearing by persons with
defective genes "a crime against society."
Because Ross looked at all political
questions from the viewpoint of a social
engineer who intended to mold and shape
people like objects, he neglected the right of
people to make their own choices about
raising children. Imposing politically a
standard of genetic normality is a serious
invasion of liberty.
