# Ideas Of Feminism And Socialism

The concept of feminism
frightens some people, enlightens
others, but probably confuses
most. To some it brings to mind
images of exuberant pride and
unity among women as they
discover their latent capacities for
group as well as individual
strength and power. To others it
might bring to mind visions of
emasculation or the total leveling
of sexual differentiation.
Exclusively, neither of these
concepts does justice to a
movement which involves men as
well as women, and which seeks
to overhaul outdated societal
mores governing the roles of the
sexes. More accurately, then,
feminism is a striving for equality
of opportunity and a widening of
the routes which lead to personal,
economic, educational and career
fulfillment for both sexes.
Feminism as a movement is, we
believe, an impetus for social
change and improvement, for as
long as one sex (or one race or
one class) remains wholly
dependent on another for its
fulfillment and/or livlihood, the
prospect for the attainment of
even relative societal harmony and
cooperation remains distant.
Our collective striving for the
attainment of feminist goals
necessarily originates on the
personal level, for we must all be
made to see for ourselves just how
it is that we as women and as
individuals are deprived of and
restricted from the more
productive and influential spheres
of life.
Men Also Restricted
It becomes readily apparent,
however, that it is not only we, as
women, who are restricted. Men,
as restrictive figures of power, are
depriving themselves of much
which is beneficial when they
refuse the "feminine" that exists

not only in themselves, but in
society at large.
In short, men are restricting
themselves by exclusively
honoring those male principles of
aggression, independence,
unemotionality, etc. Without the
balancing factors of the feminine
tendencies toward relative
receptivity, interdependence, and
attention to emotions, we as
individuals and as society stand to
suffer the powerful consequences
of misdirected social, scientific
and technological potentials.
A heightened personal
awareness of the effects which
female liberation can have on
one's own life leads first to the
ability to discriminate the subtle
means by which women are
culturally bound to live within the
pre-established life structures by
1) the media, 2) the dictates of
traditional social standards, and 3)
the existing political structure.
Secondly, it leads to the
realization that real liberation is
the confluence of the personal
with the political. Political
reorganization involves the
replacement of the existing
patriarchal superstructure with a
more androgenous social and
political order.
It is the present political
system which is most responsible
for the imposition of outmoded
cultural limitations on women, as
well as on men and children. This
limiting political structure is to
blame for the more subtle display
of oppression through the media
which impresses each individual
with the ideology of an
"oppressed vs. oppressor" social
structure.
This "oppressed vs. oppressor"
social structure is evident in
existing sexual relationships as
well as relations between races,

between workers and owners, and
between age groups. Feminism,
feminist socialism in particular,
seeks to level the oppressed vs.
oppressor nature of these
categories, replacing them with a
system guided by principles of
mutuality and reciprocity.
Less Discrimination
Thus people would not be
discriminated against on the basis
of sex, race, age, or education, but
would be enouraged and allowed
to take control of their own lives
and activities with responsibility
for their undertakings and
(re)production.
The revamping of political and
legal standards as they exist today
will not be easy. Perhaps even
more difficult, however, will be

the restructuring of a social
consciousness which for centuries
has discriminated against one half
of the population.
To replace the male-oriented
capitalist system which we live
under today we must actively seek
a more cooperative, socialistic
system which- incorporates those
traits which are traditionally
masculine together with those
which are traditionally feminine.
This merger will, we believe, pave
the way to a new and higher order
of existence for us all.
