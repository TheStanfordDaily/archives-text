# If USE Strikes
## 
### 
Hofmeister, i

Unless there is a dramatic
change in negotiations, on May 13
Stanford students will find
themselves attending a university|l
whose workers are on strike. For
the past five months students have
read Daily accounts of the
progress, or lack of it, in
negotiations. The campus myth is
that students are only spectators
in that struggle.
*
Students are clients of a
management whose employees
may go on strike. There is no way
to remain neutral. The "invisible"
people who cook students' food,
clean their dormitories and service
their classrooms, libraries and
laboratories are fighting fori,
decent wages and living
conditions.
To continue "business as
usual" is to lend support to the
management (university
administration). It is the
University's obligation to fulfill its
contractual obligations to
students — but not at the expense
of University workers.
The USE team has been
negotiating with the University
since December, and very little
headway has been made. USE
compromised on many of the
major issues (dental plan,
community standards, cost of
living), while the University has
conceded only minor issues. (For
example, giving an extra holiday.)
Rights Violated
The administration has made
the outrageous demand that it
have the right to fire any
employee who, on his or her own
time, carries any picket sign, on or
off campus — a clear violation of
constitutional rights.
On April 11, more than 600
USE members voted to reject the
University's contract offer, and
listed 20 demands which they saw
as primary. In the last few weeks
of negotiations the University has
refused to discuss any of these
priorities and has instead j
negotiated less significant issues.
The imion feels that these gestures
of bad faith leave no alternative
but to strike.
The loss of services which
University workers perform will
obviously inconvenience students,
who have entered into and
depended upon a contract with
the University. However, the
people whose labor the University
uses to fulfill that contract are
more than "inconvenienced."
They are lower paid and have less
benefits than workers with
comparable jobs in the area.
They have overcome University
opposition and voted in their own
union, and they have voted
overwhelmingly to lose their
paychecks and take on a strike.
They are not "sabotaging" the 4
University community — they are
a part of that community, and
have in *fact been subsidizing it
with their poorly paid labor.
We ask students to analyze
their own position vis a uis the
administration and the union. We
ask them not to cross picket lines
or to act as scab labor by filling
striking workers' jobs. We ask
them actively to support the
workers and join the lines, to
discuss the issues with other
students and encourage professors
not to hold classes or to hold
them outside. Student support of
workers can help bring the
University back to the bargaining
table, to begin talking seriously.

decent wages and living
conditions.
To continue "business as
usual" is to lend support to the
management (university
administration). It is the
University's obligation to fulfill its
contractual obligations to
students — but not at the expense
of University workers.
The USE team has been
negotiating with the University
since December, and very little
headway has been made. USE
compromised on many of the
major issues (dental plan,
community standards, cost of
living), while the University has
conceded only minor issues. (For
example, giving an extra holiday.)
Rights Violated
The administration has made
the outrageous demand that it
have the right to fire any
employee who, on his or her own
time, carries any picket sign, on or
off campus — a clear violation of
constitutional rights.
On April 11, more than 600
USE members voted to reject the
University's contract offer, and
listed 20 demands which they saw
as primary. In the last few weeks
of negotiations the University has
refused to discuss any of these
priorities and has instead j
negotiated less significant issues.
The imion feels that these gestures
of bad faith leave no alternative
but to strike.
The loss of services which
University workers perform will
obviously inconvenience students,
who have entered into and
depended upon a contract with
the University. However, the
people whose labor the University
uses to fulfill that contract are
more than "inconvenienced."
They are lower paid and have less
benefits than workers with
comparable jobs in the area.
They have overcome University
opposition and voted in their own
union, and they have voted
overwhelmingly to lose their
paychecks and take on a strike.
They are not "sabotaging" the 4
University community — they are
a part of that community, and
have in *fact been subsidizing it
with their poorly paid labor.
We ask students to analyze
their own position vis a uis the
administration and the union. We
ask them not to cross picket lines
or to act as scab labor by filling
striking workers' jobs. We ask
them actively to support the
workers and join the lines, to
discuss the issues with other
students and encourage professors
not to hold classes or to hold
them outside. Student support of
workers can help bring the
University back to the bargaining
table, to begin talking seriously.

Unless there is a dramatic
change in negotiations, on May 13
Stanford students will find
themselves attending a university|l
whose workers are on strike. For
the past five months students have
read Daily accounts of the
progress, or lack of it, in
negotiations. The campus myth is
that students are only spectators
in that struggle.
*
Students are clients of a
management whose employees
may go on strike. There is no way
to remain neutral. The "invisible"
people who cook students' food,
clean their dormitories and service
their classrooms, libraries and
laboratories are fighting fori,
decent wages and living
conditions.
