# Kurzweil For Assessor
## 
### 
Chris Gray

One of the many local offices that voters will
have to make a decision on this June 4 is that of
Santa Clara County Tax Assessor. This year Jack
Kurzweil has an excellent chance to force the
incumbent into a run-off which would be held in
November.
Jack Kurzweil is an Assistant Professor of
Electrical Engineering at San Jose State University.
He is on the Executive Committee of his union,
United Professors of California Local 1362 (AFT,
AFL-CIO) and he represents it on the Santa Clara
County Central Labor Council. He is a member of
the Communist Party of the United States.
The present assessor refuses to release
information on the 100 biggest property tax
payers, on the proportion industry pays of total
county taxes, or on the breakdown on the biggest
companies in Santa Clara County. What is being
hidden?
Jack Kurzweil will open all assessment

information to the public.
Perhaps what is being hidden is the unequitable
assessments in Santa Clara County. Residential land
is appraised at $60,000-$lOO,OOO per acre. The
land of Hewlett-Packard is appraised at $30,000 per
acre; the San Jose Mercury is $25,000 per acre;
IBM is $20,000 per acre; and Ford is $12,000 per
acre. The highest assessment rate in the county is in
East San Jose, where the poorest people live.
Jack Kurzweil will review all assessments with
the purpose of lowering assessed values of owner
occupied homes and increasing those on industrial
and commercial properties.
There are many more issues in this campaign
such as land use, social services, and the sales tax.
Watch for Jack Kurzweil's literature. For more
information or to help, stop by Columbae House or
call 998-1119.
