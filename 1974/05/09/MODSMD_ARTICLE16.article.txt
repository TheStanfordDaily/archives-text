# 'Committee Of The Whole'
## Winbigler Explains News Limitations 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Faculty Senate's official
policy limiting news coverage
during "Committee of the Whole"
sessions is "merely a formalization
of previously tacit
understandings," Academic
Secretary H. Donald Winbigler
said Tuesday.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Winbigler explained
that the Senate began to express
limitations on Senate coverage by
the University News Service,
KZSU and the Daily during the
informal debate periods to insure
"free and complete exchange of

ideas" without faculty
representatives "having to worry
about being misquoted."
Under the policy, annunciated
last quarter, reporters are free to
report only the general nature of
the Senate's action during
"Committee of the Whole"
discussions.
They are forbidden to quote
Senate members directly, to
attribute paraphrased quotations
to specific faculty representatives
or to record any "straw votes"
during the period, which the
Senate can invoke at will.
No Official Action
Faculty representatives can not
take official action or votes in the
"Committee of the Whole" under
Senate by-laws.
There has been "no tightening
up of the rules," Winbigler
emphasized.
"When the Senate began six
years ago, no reporters were
allowed into meetings. The
changes that have been made are

in the nature of much freer
quotation."
He added that the "Committee
of the Whole" is a "useful tool"
which allows faculty
representatives to change their
minds, vacillate or to take a
"devil's advocate" position.
Too Much Reporting
"The major criticism in the
Senate has been that there is too
much reporting of what has been
said," Winbigler commented.
The Senate Steering
Committee will not alter the
"Committee of the Whole" policy
this quarter, he said, but could
overturn the limitations in the
future if it is convinced that
informal discussion segments are
no longer valid.
Winbigler also said he
supported the tenets of the
Report on the Professoriate which
would "regularize" procedures for
granting tenure and recognize an
adjunct professoriate.

"It's not such a drastic
change," he remarked.
'Five-Year Plan'
Each department should draw
up a "five-year plan" outlining the
possibilities of promotion and
tenure now that the size of the
faculty has stabilized, Winbigler
said after the broadcast.
'They should announce it and
have it on file so that it's not a
surprise to a young assistant
professor who's already been here
for two or three years that he
can't get tenure," he added.
Winbigler, who has served here
as dean of students, registrar and
professor of speech, drama and
education, has announced his
plans to retirfc at the end of the
school year.
"I expect to be around [in the
future]," he said, adding that he
does not expect to have any
official University responsibility.

up a "five-year plan" outlining the
possibilities of promotion and
tenure now that the size of the
faculty has stabilized, Winbigler
said after the broadcast.
'They should announce it and
have it on file so that it's not a
surprise to a young assistant
professor who's already been here
for two or three years that he
can't get tenure," he added.
Winbigler, who has served here
as dean of students, registrar and
professor of speech, drama and
education, has announced his
plans to retirfc at the end of the
school year.
"I expect to be around [in the
future]," he said, adding that he
does not expect to have any
official University responsibility.


H. DONALD WINBIGLER
The Faculty Senate's official
policy limiting news coverage
during "Committee of the Whole"
sessions is "merely a formalization
of previously tacit
understandings," Academic
Secretary H. Donald Winbigler
said Tuesday.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Winbigler explained
that the Senate began to express
limitations on Senate coverage by
the University News Service,
KZSU and the Daily during the
informal debate periods to insure
"free and complete exchange of

ideas" without faculty
representatives "having to worry
about being misquoted."
Under the policy, annunciated
last quarter, reporters are free to
report only the general nature of
the Senate's action during
"Committee of the Whole"
discussions.
They are forbidden to quote
Senate members directly, to
attribute paraphrased quotations
to specific faculty representatives
or to record any "straw votes"
during the period, which the
Senate can invoke at will.
No Official Action
Faculty representatives can not
take official action or votes in the
"Committee of the Whole" under
Senate by-laws.
There has been "no tightening
up of the rules," Winbigler
emphasized.
"When the Senate began six
years ago, no reporters were
allowed into meetings. The
changes that have been made are

in the nature of much freer
quotation."
He added that the "Committee
of the Whole" is a "useful tool"
which allows faculty
representatives to change their
minds, vacillate or to take a
"devil's advocate" position.
Too Much Reporting
"The major criticism in the
Senate has been that there is too
much reporting of what has been
said," Winbigler commented.
The Senate Steering
Committee will not alter the
"Committee of the Whole" policy
this quarter, he said, but could
overturn the limitations in the
future if it is convinced that
informal discussion segments are
no longer valid.
Winbigler also said he
supported the tenets of the
Report on the Professoriate which
would "regularize" procedures for
granting tenure and recognize an
adjunct professoriate.

"It's not such a drastic
change," he remarked.
'Five-Year Plan'
Each department should draw
up a "five-year plan" outlining the
possibilities of promotion and
tenure now that the size of the
faculty has stabilized, Winbigler
said after the broadcast.
'They should announce it and
have it on file so that it's not a

can't get tenure," he added.
