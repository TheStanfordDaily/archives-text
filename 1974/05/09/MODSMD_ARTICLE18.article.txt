Could you give me some information on the Stanford Bike Club?
Can "normar' people join, or must one be hypertropic in the legs?
S.K.
According to David 8011, president of the Stanford Cycling
Association, the club's activities are "pretty much over" for the year.
However, he did say that club members meet every day at 3:30 by the
Toyon eating clubs for what he called "training rides." ("We go out
there to work hard," he commented, but noted that the rides are also
fun.)
The Cycling Association is "organized around intercollegiate
racing," said 8011, but the group doesn't exclude non-racers who want
to join. 801 l said that some people in the club this year didn't race but
went on rides with the other members and helped to organize
activities.
801 l said that notices will appear in Once Around the Quad next
fall when the club begins meeting formally again.

I recently found that, a container of fruit juice had begun
fermenting, and I encouraged it to completion. Before tasting this
homemade wine, however, I became suspicious as to the nature of the
organism which had initiated the fermentation. Is there any place I can
take or send a sample of the brew to have it analyzed for toxins?
C.L. V.
Send a sample to Systems Management Associates, Inc. at P.O. Box
957, Palo Alto, CA. 94302.
The man there said that their chemist had a backlog of jobs to do,
so he couldn't guarantee when the sample would be analyzed.
He estimated that for the minimum fee of $25 (the hourly rate)
the chemist could determine alchoholic content and whether there
were any obvious adulterants in the brew.
