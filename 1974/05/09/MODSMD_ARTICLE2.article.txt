# Contingency Plans Detailed
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN, VLAE KERSHNER DON COX 
University officials, facing a strike
that appears to be only a weekend
away, have spent the last few days
preparing contingency plans
formulated only weeks ago.
"It's really rough on us," said Plant
Services Director Dan DeYoung, the
strike operations chief. "But it's our
responsibility to keep going," if the
walkout of up to 1400 technical,
maintenance and service employees
materializes Monday.
The employees are members of a
bargaining unit represented by United
Stanford Employees (USE). Only
about 1000 of these workers belong to
USE. It is unclear whether the others
will join in the strike.
The residence hall food service,
Tresidder Food Service. Plant Services,
residence system, Medical Center and
Hospital, University Stores, Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC),
Stanford Center for Information
Processing (SCIP) which includes the
computation center, and Hansen
Laboratories have all formulated
emergency plans.
University officials have been
reluctant to reveal these plans.
However, the Daily learned some of
the details yesterday.
Food Services
All food services but Wilbur and
Stern Hall kitchens will be closed,
University Food Services Manager
Maxine Anderson said.
Food service managers will assume
the cooking chores, she added.
By closing down the smaller
kitchens, food service managers hope
to concentrate management personnel
in two viable working units.
Hashers
However, whether hashers will be
required to cross picket lines and come
to work has not yet been resolved. At
a meeting of residence staff in Roble
last night, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons agreed that the issue is
one of "non-resolution."
He asked students to tolerate "a lot
of ambiguity" and confusion on an
administrative level, but promised to
issue a memo explaining the
University's position as soon as
possible.
The food service plans to serve all
3000 students who have meal tickets,
Anderson said.
The kitchens will probably serve
dinner from 5 to 7 p.m., lunch from
11 a.m. to 2 p.m., but "we will serve
for however long it takes," she said.
The food services also have a special
emergency menu already planned, she
said.
According to food service sources,

Wilbur will be expected to
accommodate 1650 for dinner. Stern
1350. During a normal night, Wilbur
feeds 900 diners in an hour, Wilbur
Food Services Manager Kay Malik said.
Wilbur has made quite a few special
arrangements, she said. "We'll make it
till the end of the quarter. We don't
give up that easy."
Regardless of how it feeds the
students, the University "definitely"
has a contractual obligation to provide
board for those 3000 students with
meal plans, according to Cassius L.
Kirk Jr., staff counsel to the vice
president for business and finance.
"If the food services closed down
entirely, we would be forced to refund
the students' money," he said.
Tresidder Contract
The University is considering
contracting the Tresidder Food
Service, which is contracted to TDS
Inc., to feed all or some of the
students with meal cards.
According to cafeteria manager
Louise Swanson, Director of
University Housing Ed Scoles has
mentioned the possibility of paying
TDS to honor meal cards. However, no
final decision has been made.
(TDS employees are not currently
members of the bargaining unit. They
will vote on whether to join USE next
Thursday.)
Asked whether Tresidder could
handle the increased volume, TDS
food manager John Shaw said, "We
either have the capacity or we'll
stretch the capacity. We're committed
to staying open and serving the
community in whatever way we can."
Stocking Up
Both the University Food Service
and TDS officials say they are stocking
up on paper plates and plastic utensils
because a lack of hot water may make
their dishwashing equipment useless.
The steam plant currently provides
hot water to University buildings
(including dormitories), as well as
kitchens. However, DeYoung isn't
ready to concede that students will be
unable to take hot showers once the
strike begins.
DeYoung outlined Plant Services'
priorities during the strike:
Stanford Hospital and essential
maintenance will receive the highest
priorities, while grounds maintenance,
custodial service and painting will be
curtailed severely.
DeYoung said Plant Services "will
really try to keep operational with the
personnel here and attempt to avoid
hiring outside people. We would only
hire in situations which affect life
support systems," he said, noting that
a prolonged strike would have a
