# Contingency Plans Detailed
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN, VLAE KERSHNER DON COX 
University officials, facing a strike
that appears to be only a weekend
away, have spent the last few days
preparing contingency plans
formulated only weeks ago.
"It's really rough on us," said Plant
Services Director Dan DeYoung, the
strike operations chief. "But it's our
responsibility to keep going," if the
walkout of up to 1400 technical,
maintenance and service employees
materializes Monday.
The employees are members of a
bargaining unit represented by United
Stanford Employees (USE). Only
about 1000 of these workers belong to
USE. It is unclear whether the others
will join in the strike.
The residence hall food service,
Tresidder Food Service. Plant Services,
residence system, Medical Center and
Hospital, University Stores, Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC),
Stanford Center for Information
Processing (SCIP) which includes the
computation center, and Hansen
Laboratories have all formulated
emergency plans.
University officials have been
reluctant to reveal these plans.
However, the Daily learned some of
the details yesterday.
Food Services
All food services but Wilbur and
Stern Hall kitchens will be closed,
University Food Services Manager
Maxine Anderson said.
Food service managers will assume
the cooking chores, she added.
By closing down the smaller
kitchens, food service managers hope
to concentrate management personnel
in two viable working units.
Hashers
However, whether hashers will be
required to cross picket lines and come
to work has not yet been resolved. At
a meeting of residence staff in Roble
last night, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons agreed that the issue is
one of "non-resolution."
He asked students to tolerate "a lot
of ambiguity" and confusion on an
administrative level, but promised to
issue a memo explaining the
University's position as soon as
possible.
The food service plans to serve all
3000 students who have meal tickets,
Anderson said.
The kitchens will probably serve
dinner from 5 to 7 p.m., lunch from
11 a.m. to 2 p.m., but "we will serve
for however long it takes," she said.
The food services also have a special
emergency menu already planned, she
said.
According to food service sources,

Wilbur will be expected to
accommodate 1650 for dinner. Stern
1350. During a normal night, Wilbur
feeds 900 diners in an hour, Wilbur
Food Services Manager Kay Malik said.
Wilbur has made quite a few special
arrangements, she said. "We'll make it
till the end of the quarter. We don't
give up that easy."
Regardless of how it feeds the
students, the University "definitely"
has a contractual obligation to provide
board for those 3000 students with
meal plans, according to Cassius L.
Kirk Jr., staff counsel to the vice
president for business and finance.
"If the food services closed down
entirely, we would be forced to refund
the students' money," he said.
Tresidder Contract
The University is considering
contracting the Tresidder Food
Service, which is contracted to TDS
Inc., to feed all or some of the
students with meal cards.
According to cafeteria manager
Louise Swanson, Director of
University Housing Ed Scoles has
mentioned the possibility of paying
TDS to honor meal cards. However, no
final decision has been made.
(TDS employees are not currently
members of the bargaining unit. They
will vote on whether to join USE next
Thursday.)
Asked whether Tresidder could
handle the increased volume, TDS
food manager John Shaw said, "We
either have the capacity or we'll
stretch the capacity. We're committed
to staying open and serving the
community in whatever way we can."
Stocking Up
Both the University Food Service
and TDS officials say they are stocking
up on paper plates and plastic utensils
because a lack of hot water may make
their dishwashing equipment useless.
The steam plant currently provides
hot water to University buildings
(including dormitories), as well as
kitchens. However, DeYoung isn't
ready to concede that students will be
unable to take hot showers once the
strike begins.
DeYoung outlined Plant Services'
priorities during the strike:
Stanford Hospital and essential
maintenance will receive the highest
priorities, while grounds maintenance,
custodial service and painting will be
curtailed severely.
DeYoung said Plant Services "will
really try to keep operational with the
personnel here and attempt to avoid
hiring outside people. We would only
hire in situations which affect life
support systems," he said, noting that
a prolonged strike would have a
unit. Food Service employees,
currently make $408 per month.
Under the current University proposal
the lowest possible rate for starting
employees who are not trainees would
be $504 per month.
USE is asking for $600 monthly
minimum pay, which means a 2.2
percent increase, about a $280,000
increase of the unit's wage base. USE
asserts that this is the minimum
liveable wage for the Bay Area and
that it compares closely with
government figures.
The University says it is not
opposed to establishing new minimum
pay rates, but insists on negotiating
each classification individually.
Cost-Of-Living
The union's proposed cost of living
escalator would provide workers with
a $6 per month pay increase per point
increase in the consumer price index
retroactive to Sept. 1, 1973.
USE says the clause is necessary to
protect workers from the inflationary
climate and to compensate for price
increases in necessities.
The proposal would increase the
wage base by 5.5 percent or about
$713,000. The University particularly
opposes making the boost retroactive.
Community Standards
Perhaps the largest gulf between the
two sides is created by USE's
community standards concept which
would boost the wage base 8.3 percent
per year, about $1.1 million.
USE says Stanford employees are,
on the average, of a higher caliber than
workers outside of the University and
should be paid appropriately.
USE argues Stanford workers

should make more than comparable
employees at 75 percent of Bay Area
firms.
Decline Comment
University officials decline to
comment extensively on these
economic issues since they have not
been discussed in any great detail on
the bargaining table.
They have resisted discussing them
until other economic-related issues
such as job classifications and the
maintenance of standard clause have
been resolved.
The University has said the general
economic package offer might be
improved, depending on the resolution
of the other issues.
Non-Economic Issues
Non-economic issues have been the
object of most of the negotiating
sessions.

The maintenance of standards
clause is "a real can of worms"
according to University negotiator
Douglas Barton. The clause would
prevent the University from altering
working conditions for the worse â€” as
defined by the union.
University negotiators refuse to give*
the union "a blank check" with regard
to University practices. They say the
clause is designed as "insurance" in
case the union forgets to include
something in the contract.
A union shop is also on USE's list
of demands. The University refuses tOj
grant this since it says there are some
workers who do not want to join.
USE and University negotiators met
yesterday and reported progress on' the
resolution of the grievance procedure
issue. The two parties will meet again
today.
