# Fights Lack Of Coverage, Sexism
## News Service Defends Women's Cause 
### LAURIE LUCAS 
"If you would not say, 'Slim,
attractive Senator Howard Baker
announced today. . .' then do not
say, 'Slim, attractive Gloria
Steinem announced today. . .' "
This rule, which urges
newswriters to eschew "gratuitous
physical description" from news
stories about women, is one of 11
guidelines laid down by
Stanford University's Women's
News Service.
The impetus for the creation of
the Women's News Service (WNS)
sprang from one woman's
indignation at the treatment
accorded women by the media.
Decrying the "low level of
news pertaining to women," such
as recipes, instead of health and

nutrition news, advice columns,
the latest fashions and society
news, Wendy Quinones, an M.A.
candidate in communication,
decided it was her responsibility
to write news "relevant to
women."
Unsuccessful Attempts
Quinones said she had been
toying with the idea of the service
since Fall quarter, but her initial
attempts to organize the women
in the communication program
were unsuccessful.
"There has never been a lack of
interest among the women
students," she said, "just lack of
time."
Another barrier to the
formation of the Women's News
Service was the Daily staff's

indifference to the dissemination
of women's news, Quinones said.
"I tried to work through the
Daily people, but found them
uncooperative," she charged.
Despite her requests to cover
women's news, Quinones claimed
she never received any such
assignments from the Daily.
Instead, all of her articles about
women were self-generated.
Staff Of Six
Frustrated by the Daily's
response to her plea for a
women's page, Quinones went
ahead and launched her own
organization last January — the
Women's News Service.
Operating from headquarters in
an ASSU office in Tresidder, the
WNS has increased its ranks to
include five other staffers: Gladys
Gundrum, Sue Luttner, Terrie
McDonald, Amy Sabrin and Iris
Yang. Dale Snape, assistant to the
dean of student affairs, sponsors
the service.
One of the group's chief
grievances is the "nearly
non-existent coverage of women
on campus."
McDonald pointed out that the
Daily "has committed more sins
of omission of women's news than
sexist writing on campus."
Scanty Coverage Cited
Quinones cited the scanty
coverage given to the Women's
Day Fair (March 6-10) as "a good
example of the Daily's sense of
omission. I don't think the
Daily was reluctant to give
publicity to the Fair," she said.

"But I think that until recently, it
was typical of the Daily's attitude,
refusing to recognize women's
news as important events."
However, the Daily has been
just one concern of the WNS. As
Quinones put it, "We're reacting
to the media in general. We're
trying to correct the sins of the
media that insist upon treating
women in sexist terms."
WNS Presentation
The position of the WNS in
relation to the' media was
underscored in a presentation
delivered to a Mass Media in
Society communication class.
Quinones, Sabrin, Yang and
McDonald offered numerous
examples of magazine and
newspaper headlines, quotations
and "honey shots" in which
women were depicted as "objects
of ridicule — all in the name of
news."
Yang assailed advertisements,
television programs and children's
textbooks as three influential
forms of communication which
perpetuate traditional stereotypes
of women: roles assigned, such as
"housewife, mother, servant, sex
object," or the image of the
"weak and worthless woman."
Quinones and Sabrin focused
their attention on women in the
news. Sabrin said, although some
people advocated treating all news
about women as you would treat
similar news about men, this
approach is unrealistic.
"This way, women are shown
to be fully integrated into

society," Sabrin asserted. "But
this is based on the ideal world.
Women are in a state of transition,
and I personally think they need
to know what other women are
doing; how they broke sex
barriers in certain fields; what
problems they faced in doing it.
They need this kind of
information — not to know that a
woman did it at all and is still
'womanly' — but how she did it."
Lambastes The Press
McDonald lambasted the press
for the different treatment
accorded to men's and women's
sports. Illustrating her point that
the media is unduly concerned
with the "faces, figures and
families" of female athletes, she
held up dozens of stories, with
headlines proclaiming, for
example, "She's All Curves and
Dimples," over pictures of
sportswomen.
But the Women's News Service
does more than blow off steam.
They are distributing their
"Guidelines for Newswomen
about Women" to various media
such as the Examiner, KPFA and
KSFO for a start.
Because all of the members of
the WNS will be leaving in June,
the group hopes to recruit
interested undergraduates of both
sexes to continue the service.
"Even though we want to
continue the Women's Service at
Stanford," Quinones said, "our
real hope is that eventually, there
will be no need for it."
