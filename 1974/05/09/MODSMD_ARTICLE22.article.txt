# Doc, Merle Watson Play Informal Set
## 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO—Besides
playing at Frost Amphitheater
Sunday afternoon and at the
Golden State Bluegrass Festival a
week earlier, Doc and Merle
Watson, two of the best folk
guitarists around, entertained
packed houses at the Boarding
House for five nights, April
30-May 4.
Doc began his set by
announcing, "If you came to see
some flashy show, you're just
going to get disappointed, because
we're as informal as the music we
play." This unpretentious, relaxed
atmosphere and Doc's easy-going
personality are almost as pleasant
as the music itself. The listener
gets the feeling of not being at a
"show," but of sitting on
someone's porch, swapping songs
and stories.
With an endless repertoire
spanning all folk styles, it is
interesting to note that Doc writes
comparatively few songs himself
instead, he interprets traditional
tunes and songs from other
composers.
One of his favorite composers
and guitar pickers is Merle Travis,
for whom he named his son.
Included in Thursday night's show
were Travis' "Three Times Seven"
and "Smoke, Smoke, Smoke That
Cigarette." (Merle Travis, by the
way, is appearing at the Boarding
House through Sunday.)
Another of Doc's favorites is
the late Jimmie Rodgers, the
"Singing Brakeman." On Rodgers'
"T for Texas" and "Mississippi
and You," Merle was featured on
slide guitar.
Versatile Merle
In Doc's words, "Merle's good
to have as a sideman because he's
always coming up with something
new." Slide guitar is one of
Merle's newest additions, adding
another dimension to the Watson
sound. Merle ranged from the
country dobro sound, on the
Rodgers numbers, to delta blues
style, as on "Poor Boy Blues"
(their stirring new single on
Poppy), sounding a bit like Bukka
White.
Merle, now 25, also plays
banjo, but wasn't in the mood
Thursday or Saturday. Of his
banjo picking, Doc once said, "I
can't decide who sounds better,

Merle or Earl Scruggs," the
ultimate compliment.
Since joining his father, Merle's
improvement has been
astounding, and Doc has come to
spotlight him on more and more
songs. Merle displayed with ease
the finger-style blues of the late
Mississippi John Hurt on "Going
Down This Road Feeling Bad,"
and contemporary, single-note
leads on "St. James Infirmary"
and "Summertime."
Kept In Time
On "Salt Creek," an old fiddle
tune, Merle played-note-for-note
flatpick breaks with his father,
who is regarded as the best
flatpicker in the business. Merle
has been flatpicking for only
about a year! Doc showed his
flatpicking on several other
numbers, including "Sweet
Georgia Brown," and "Black
Mountain Rag," taken at an
unbelievable tempo.
Also backing up Doc was
bassist Michael Coleman. All three
are from North Carolina.
Doc, now 51, reminisced about
his years in country swing bands
by playing a very sympathetic,
energetic version of "Blue Suede
Shoes," which proved that you
don't need amplifiers in order to
rock.
Doc said, "When I first got
caught up in the folk revival of
the early 60s, I felt compelled to
try to keep up some sort of ethnic
image, and play only old-time
mountain music, but now I like to
throw in some of the old blues
and other things."
For his second encore
Thursday night, Doc sang Blind
Lemon Jefferson's "Black Snake
Moan." Worth noting here is the
change in title from "Black
Snake" (clearly a sexual image) to
"Lonesome Moan."
The amazing thing about Doc
Watson is that you don't have to
be a country music enthusiast, or
a guitarist, or even a folk music
fan to enjoy his music. Enjoyable
is the closest way of describing
Doc and Merle Watson.
The Watsons' newest LP on
Poppy "Three Days In November,"
will be out shortly, and, like all of
their works, should be a real treat.
Preceeding the Watsons was
Skunk Cabbage, a young sextet of
bluegrass traditionalists.
