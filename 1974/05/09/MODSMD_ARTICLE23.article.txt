# Savoyard's Iolanthe
## All-Around Success 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
lolanthe is scarcely Gilbert and
Sullivan's best-loved operetta.
Many G & S fans, in fact, feel it
lacks the pacing of The Mikado,
the gracious songs of H.M.S.
Pinafore, and the wit of Patience.
Yet the Stanford Savoyards'
production of lolanthe in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
accentuated the show's every
virtue, and can only be called a
success.
Billed as "A Political Comedy
in Two Enthralling Acts,"
lolanthe (or. The Peer and the
Peri) tells a nonsensical tale of
fairies — i.e., woodland spirits —
who invade Parliament amid a
series of romantic entanglements
and their inevitably successful
denouements.
W.S. Gilbert's lyrics and some
fine music by Sir Arthur Sullivan
glitter against this implausible
backdrop as brightly today as
when first produced in the 1880s.
'Fine First Act'
A satisfactory overture under
the able direction of Mr. Daniel
Robinson paved the way for a fine
first act. And the wobbly singing
and hilariously ill-coordinated
dancing of the opening Fairy
Chorus were complemented by

adequate sets and outstanding
costumes, as was the rest of the
show.
Every soloist was at least
competent, even truly
outstanding. Romantic lead
Anthony Antolini's Strephon was
honestly acted and vocally secure.
Judith Malafronte, who portrayed
Strephon's immortal fairy mother,
sang and acted with her usual
understated poise and Ella
Asbury, who filled the role of
Queen of the Fairies to
perfection, proved herself a
theatrical and musical delight.
Only ingenue Elizabeth
Barbour's Phyllis, seemed a bit out
of focus. Barbour was
unquestionably the strongest
singei; in the entire lolanthe cast,
and an actress of considerable
physical and forensic charms, but
she upstaged several other
performers during their numbers
and exaggerated her amorous
attraction to Strephon.
Out Of Character
Gilbert and Sullivan heroines
have only rarely been observed
making love on stage; in doing so
they appear, at least to me, nearly
as out of character as a
science-fiction production of
Hamlet.

With the dramatic entry of the
Chorus of Peers, singing "Bow,
Bow, Ye Lower-Middle Classes,"
the show gained momentum that
it maintained through both acts to
the end. Daniel Allan and George
Ecker, as the Earls of Mountararat
and Tolloller, led their tenors and
baritones through a number of
entertaining musical paces, while
delivering their own brief solos
with distinction.
And Edwin Good, who joined
them later in several numbers as a
Lord Chancellor unusually
susceptible to his girlish wards,
gave perhaps the finest
performance of the evening.
Good's acting was tightly paced,
his pensive solo "Said I to Myself"
charming, and his brisk dancing
brought down the house.
Bit players Carole Klein,
Kathleen Chaikin, and Katie Ryan
rose to their more modest roles as
Celia, Leila, and Fleta, three
Fairies; and Lloyd Loom's sketch
of Private Willis, a second-act
"Grenadier Guard," added
unexpected dramatic and vocal
frosting to an already
unquestionably successful cake.
Capacity audiences rewarded
lobnthe's ensemble conclusions
with cheers and curtian calls, but
the. people behind stage also
deserve a salute: Phyllis
Villeneuve provided dramatic
direction, Joseph Halatky served
as Choral and Artistic Director,
choreography was provided by
Wendy Comstock, and the
Producer was Mason Blacher.
