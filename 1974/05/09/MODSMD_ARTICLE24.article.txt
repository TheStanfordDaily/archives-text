# S.F. Ballet: Improved
## 
### CHRIS SHERRY 
The San Francisco Ballet's
performance in the Opera House
last week was an overall triumph,
a consistent and very enjoyable
evening. The credit, however,
must go to the notable guest
artists who carried the,show, for
the company itself neither
detracted from, nor especially
added to, the performance.
For years the San Francisco
Ballet has had quite a miserable
reputation in the ballet world, but
with the addition of Michael
Smuin as Associated Artistic
Director and several other changes
in personnel, the improvements in
general technical and artistic level
has been remarkable.
Unfortunately, the company is
still hampered by a lack of
freshness, spark, and originality.
The dancing is now polished, but
it fails to register any great impact
or thrill.
Petipa's Don Quixote Pas de
Deux was unquestionably the
highlight of the evening. Guest
artist Natalia Markarova from
American Ballet Theater, whose
greatest strengths lie in light,
classical roles, was as compelling
as ever, and the clarity and
brilliance of her movements is
sheeriy remarkable.
Filipov, also Kirov trained and
a Russian defector, is not only a
brilliant partner, but performs his

solos admirably, with
extraordinary ease in his leaps.
The company's two larger
works of the evening, Balanchine's
Symphony in C and Christensen's
Don Juan were pleasant but
uninspiring. Symphony, a typical
program opener, was marked by
the talents of Victoria Gyorfi, an
up-and-coming company star, and
Lynda Meyer, now the company's
reigning ballerina.
Don Juan was the more
rewarding of the two, remarkably
well costumed and with beautiful
and subtle set designs. Filipov as
the Don was excellent, although it
was a disappointment that the
actual dancing of his role was so
limited. Also notable were Diana
Weber as Ana and Anita Paciotti
as the Bride, who were striking in
their sense of refinement and
understatement.
'1 U;,
The work as a jyhole was done
in a spirit of irtifteccabte taste, a
major achievement for a company
who has had a tendency to run to
rather garish extremes. The corps
too, was energetic and captivating.
Still, Don Juan remains an
amusing story ballet and little
more, lacking depth and drama.
One can only hope for a greater
sense of originality, creativity and
innovation from the company in
the future.
