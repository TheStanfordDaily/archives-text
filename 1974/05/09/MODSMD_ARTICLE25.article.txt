According to KGO radio in San
Francisco, the note said the child,
Marshall Jones Jr., was being taken
away by the babysitter, a member of
the Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA), and that he would be brought
up by the SLA.
The babysitter, who befriended the
infant's parents several weeks ago,
reportedly introduced herself as a
college student named "Pat" and gave
the family several phony references.
Charles Bates, Federal Bureau of
Investigation special agent in charge of
the San Francisco branch, who has

Patricia Hearst, reportedly went to
Santa Rosa to investigate the case.
Santa Rosa Police and the FBI had

August 1 Vote On Nixon
WASHINGTON — House Majority
Leader Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill,
D-Mass., said yesterday that a full
House vote on the impeachment of
President Nixon will take place about
Aug. 1.
"There is going to be a vote,"
O'Neill said. "There's no question
about it."
O'Neill also said that portions of
the edited White House transcripts
which he has read have convinced him
that the President was guilty of
obstructing justice in his attempts to
thwart a 1972 investigation by the
House Banking Committee into
campaign irregularities. However,
O'Neill declined to say whether he
thought the President's action
constituted an impeachable offense.
Mitchell OK'd Break-In?
WASHINGTON - The weight of
evidence tends to establish that former
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell approved
the intelligence-gathering plan that led
to the Watergate break-in, the Senate
Watergate committee staff says in a
draft report.
The report, portions of which were
made available yesterday by a source
close to the Senate committee, also
said evidence tends to show that
money paid by White House officials
to the original Watergate defendants
was intended not as support payments
but to assure their silence.

Hearst Offers Reward
HILLSBOROUGH - Calling his
daughter's abductors "a bunch of
criminals," Randolph A. Hearst posted
a $50,000 reward yesterday and said
he would do anything in his power to
secure her release.
"I think they have pretty well
proven they're not too interested in
the people. They have just turned out
to be a bunch of criminals," the father
of Patricia Hearst said at his home in
this San Francisco suburb.
"And I want my daughter away
from them if I can get her. This is one
way. It is simply that we want to get
our daughter back."
Patricia, 20, was dragged from her
Berkeley apartment on Feb. 4. In her
latest taped message, the newspaper
heiress said she had joined the terrorist
Symbionese Liberation Army and had
willingly joined its members in robbing
a bank on April 15.
The reward for information leading
to her safe release was announced
amid news reports that SLA members
had been seen coming and going for
several weeks in downtown San
Francisco. ,

boy was abducted from his home by
his babysitter Wednesday and a note
was left in his crib, police said.
According to KGO radio in San
Francisco, the note said the child,

away by the babysitter, a member of
the Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA), and that he would be brought
up by the SLA.
The babysitter, who befriended the
infant's parents several weeks ago,
reportedly introduced herself as a
college student named "Pat" and gave
the family several phony references.
Charles Bates, Federal Bureau of

August 1 Vote On Nixon
WASHINGTON — House Majority
Leader Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill,
D-Mass., said yesterday that a full
House vote on the impeachment of
President Nixon will take place about
Aug. 1.
"There is going to be a vote,"
O'Neill said. "There's no question
about it."
O'Neill also said that portions of
the edited White House transcripts
which he has read have convinced him
that the President was guilty of
obstructing justice in his attempts to
thwart a 1972 investigation by the
House Banking Committee into
campaign irregularities. However,
O'Neill declined to say whether he
thought the President's action
constituted an impeachable offense.
Mitchell OK'd Break-In?
WASHINGTON - The weight of
evidence tends to establish that former
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell approved
the intelligence-gathering plan that led
to the Watergate break-in, the Senate
Watergate committee staff says in a
draft report.
The report, portions of which were
made available yesterday by a source
close to the Senate committee, also
said evidence tends to show that
money paid by White House officials
to the original Watergate defendants
was intended not as support payments
but to assure their silence.
