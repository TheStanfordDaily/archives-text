## TAs Stage One-Day Class Walkout 
### DAVID SMITH 
Graduate students in the German
Studies Department stayed away from
their teaching assignments and classes
yesterday in a one-day walkout
protesting what they called "the
distressing financial situation of
graduate students."
A few teaching assistants in other
departments, including sociology, and
Spanish and Portuguese, joined in the
walkout, although the German studies
students made no formal attempt to
organize the protest on a
University-wide scale.
"It wasn't getting people to strike
that was important to us," said
German graduate student Dorothy
Rosenberg. "It was spreading
information about the intolerable
financial position of all graduate
students and gaining support for our
cause."
Moses' Decision
The walkout stemmed largely from
Dean of Graduate Studies Lincoln
Moses' decision in March that graduate
students in German studies be limited
to six quarters of teaching assignments
during their four-year Ph.D. studies.
The students also objected that TAs
have received no cost-of-living raises
since 1968.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Graduate Studies J. Merrill Carlsmith,
the University's position toward the
disgruntled students remains
unchanged after the walkout. "We
don't regard the teaching assistants as

employees, but as students," he noted.
"There has been no decrease in
stipends; in fact they have just gone
up," he pointed out. Carlsmith stated
that the University regarded more than
six quarters of teaching by TAs as
excessive and a possible interference
with studies.
USE Participants
The graduate students picketed for

much of the day in front of the
German studies offices in the Quad.
About 20 members of the United
Stanford Employees (USE) union
participated during the late morning.
Several workers in the University's
interdepartmental mail service also
walked off their jobs in support of the
TAs. Supervisory personnel and
department secretaries took over their

duties.
According to German studies
graduate student Jim Coleman, four or
five professors in the department did
not hold classes in a show of sympathy
with the students, and three others
used class time to explain the
walkout's purpose.
Albrecht's Support
Among the faculty members who
did not hold classes was Acting Asst.
Prof. Gunther Albrecht.
"The walkout is a totally
constructive action; there is absolutely
no malice intended," Albrecht said.
"It is only through this sort of
confrontation that a solution can be
reached. The TAs must not allow
to be intimidated on this
issue."
