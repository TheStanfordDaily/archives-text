# Trudeau Loses Confidence Vote
## 
### 
OTTAWA (AP) — Angered by
inflation and dissatisfied with a
proposed government budget, the
opposition brought down Prime
Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau's
minority Liberal government
yesterday and opened the way for new
elections in July.
The vote of 137-123 was only the
third time a government has been
defeated on the floor of the House of
Commons. It meant the handsome and
progressive-minded Trudeau, who
replaced Lester Pearson as prime
minister in 1968, will face a new
contest for political survival.
Trudeau is expected to dissolve
Parliament and call elections for July
8. He would remain as prime minister
until then.
Trudeau's government had survived
19 no-confidence votes in the one and
a half years preceeding Wednesday's
vote. The latest no-confidence vote
carried because the New Democratic
Party (NDP) — which held the balance
of power in the 29th parliament —
decided to join the main opposition
Conservatives in attacking the
administration's budget.
The NDP decided Tuesday to take a
tough new approach, and introduced a
no confidence motion clearly designed

to attract support from the Progressive
Conservatives.
The critical vote came on the NDP
motion — actually an amendment to a
Conservative measure — that
condemned the government for its
"failure to apply any measures to help
pensioners, or others on fixed
incomes, to deal with the housing
crisis and to remove the glaring
inequalities of the tax system."
Inflation in Canada has reached 10
percent this year.
It was the first time a Canadian

government suffered a Commons
defeat on its budget.
Trudeau had no immediate
comment on the vote, except to say he
will dissolve Parliament and seek a
formal election order today from
Governor-General Jules Leger.
Conservative leader Robert
Stanfield declared promptly after the
vote that after the new elections "I
will return as prime minister."
NDP leader David Lewis appeared
jubilant, and said the party machinery
for a new election is "rolling already,
everything's moving along well."
