# Columnist Kilpatrick Perceives Hope For Conservative Cause
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Conservatism is a growing force in
American politics, James J. Kilpatrick,
syndicated columnist, told a Stanford
audience last night.
"The conservative cause isn't dead
or dying," Kilpatrick declared. "Its
difficulties will probably increase with
the November election, but the long
term prognosis is good."
Speaking to 300 people in Bishop
Auditorium in a talk sponsored by
Stanford's Conservative Forum,
Kilpatrick emphasized that the
conservative cause can survive
Watergate, partly because "Nixon is
not a conservative philosopher.
"If the future of the Republican
Party depends inexorably on Richad
Nixon then we are done for,'
Kilpatrick noted. But he added, "we
of the conservative persuasion are not
tied to Nixon."
Hope
Kilpatrick cited several reasons why
conservatives can be hopeful.
Both liberals and conservatives are
realizing that the powers of the

presidency must be curbed, he noted:
"There are signs of a resurgence of
Congressional power."
This is an encouraging
development, said Kilpatrick, noting
that "the idea is not to cripple the
President but to restrain" him.
Further, the U.S. Supreme Court is
achieving a better balance between
liberty and order after the "excesses of
the Warren years," Kilpatrick stated.
Noting that campus violence has
decreased in recent years, Kilpatrick
said, "this lunacy, this anarchy, if not
behind us, has subsided."
Kilpatrick also said he is
encouraged by the*end of wage and
price controls. "This is great," he
noted, explaining that private
enterprise should be left, alone.
'Hungry'
Kilpatrick observed that the
American people are "hungry for a
few blank pages of history" after the
turmoils of the post-Eisenhower years.
People are "fed up with promises
that aren't kept" and "theories that
can't be translated into reality,"

Kil patrick stated.
Although Kilpatrick said that he
does not favor a political policy of,
benign neglect, he believes that
government should assume a smaller
role in the lives of the American
people.
"My conservatism embraces
diversity and fears concentration of
power," Kilpatrick stated.
Not Perfect
Conservatism teaches that
"mankind is not going to be perfected
by any program of the state,"
Kilpatrick said.
Emphasizing that change is often
not tantamount to progress, Kilpatrick
claimed that the status quo should
always be defended until justification
for any proposed change can be
proven.
In a panel discussion following his
speech, Kilpatrick discussed the
transcripts of Nixon's conversations
with his aides.
Kilpatrick insisted that Nixon had
no knowledge of the Watergate
break-in or cover-up until March 1973.

turmoils of the post-Eisenhower years.
People are "fed up with promises
that aren't kept" and "theories that
can't be translated into reality,"

Kil patrick stated.
Although Kilpatrick said that he
does not favor a political policy of,
benign neglect, he believes that
government should assume a smaller
role in the lives of the American
people.
"My conservatism embraces
diversity and fears concentration of
power," Kilpatrick stated.
Not Perfect
Conservatism teaches that
"mankind is not going to be perfected
by any program of the state,"
Kilpatrick said.
Emphasizing that change is often
not tantamount to progress, Kilpatrick
claimed that the status quo should
always be defended until justification
for any proposed change can be
proven.
In a panel discussion following his
speech, Kilpatrick discussed the
transcripts of Nixon's conversations
with his aides.
Kilpatrick insisted that Nixon had
no knowledge of the Watergate
break-in or cover-up until March 1973.
Conservatism is a growing force in
American politics, James J. Kilpatrick,
syndicated columnist, told a Stanford
audience last night.
"The conservative cause isn't dead
or dying," Kilpatrick declared. "Its
difficulties will probably increase with
the November election, but the long
term prognosis is good."
Speaking to 300 people in Bishop
Auditorium in a talk sponsored by
Stanford's Conservative Forum,
Kilpatrick emphasized that the
conservative cause can survive
Watergate, partly because "Nixon is
not a conservative philosopher.
"If the future of the Republican
Party depends inexorably on Richad
Nixon then we are done for,'
Kilpatrick noted. But he added, "we
of the conservative persuasion are not
tied to Nixon."
Hope
Kilpatrick cited several reasons why
conservatives can be hopeful.
Both liberals and conservatives are
realizing that the powers of the

presidency must be curbed, he noted:
"There are signs of a resurgence of
Congressional power."
This is an encouraging
development, said Kilpatrick, noting
that "the idea is not to cripple the
President but to restrain" him.
Further, the U.S. Supreme Court is
achieving a better balance between
liberty and order after the "excesses of
the Warren years," Kilpatrick stated.
Noting that campus violence has
decreased in recent years, Kilpatrick
said, "this lunacy, this anarchy, if not
behind us, has subsided."
Kilpatrick also said he is
encouraged by the*end of wage and
price controls. "This is great," he
noted, explaining that private
enterprise should be left, alone.
'Hungry'
Kilpatrick observed that the
American people are "hungry for a
few blank pages of history" after the
turmoils of the post-Eisenhower years.
People are "fed up with promises
that aren't kept" and "theories that
can't be translated into reality,"
