# Committee Appointments: Horsetrading?
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL Second of two parts 
The ASSU Nominations Committee, which is
screening hundreds of student applicants for
committee openings this week, has functioned
smoothly so far. but before the selection process
is over "there's going to be some horsetrading,"
predicted committee member 800 Bacon.
"There are going to be some people
[candidates! who I am going to be hard-headed
and stubborn about (getting nominated],"
Bacon said flatly.
There's a good chance he won't see
eye-to-eye with Committee Chairman Mike
Herman. ASSU president, whose slate beat out
Bacon's in the recent ASSU election.
Although Bacon senses possible sources of
contention, the committee's more inexperienced
members seem to be unaware of potential
problems — and of the real problems which
beset last spring's committee.
Naivete
Lise Pfeiffer, a member of the Nominations
Committee last spring, recalls her initial naivete.
"I went in there with the idea of getting the best
applicants. . . but I didn't know the politics
involved — all the favors people would do for
you, if you'd do this for them."
"If anybody had seen the wav we voted last

spring," admitted former committee member
Mike Nilsson, "they would have been appalled."
Apparently, five of the committee's seven
members made a plan for other committee
openings. After bargaining with fellow members
for their votes, most landed comfortable seats
on committees of their choice — as a "kind of
reward," said Nilsson.
The Line-Up
Nilsson recalled last year's line-up: three
members of the committee were supporters of
then-ASSU President-Kevin O'Grady's council;
three others, including Herman, were leftover
supporters of one-time ASSU President Scott
Burke. "1 was sort of the swing vote," Nilsson
said.
He explained he played up to both sides to
help members get the positions they wanted.
But then his strategy backfired, he said, leaving
him with no friends — and worse — no
committee position.
According to, two reports, and by his own
admission, Nilsson then demanded all the votes
be re-taken. "This time I'll vote my conscience,"
Nilsson recalls saying.
Bargaining
Explaining how he felt then, he said, "1
realized after I didn't get on that committee
(Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid J

that I was sick of this kind of shit — of
bargaining back and forth."
"I made a fuss at the end," Nilsson said. He
said he threatened to block the rest of the
committee's nominations by refusing to endorse
the votes.
So then, Nilsson said, the Nominations
Committee "asked me what 1 wanted." Nilsson
singled out a spot on the Trustee Committee on
Budget Adjustments, and his fellow committee
members placated him by removing another
candidate and nominating Nilsson instead.
Competition
Meanwhile, Herman was aiming for both the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (C-US)
and for the Committee of 15 (C-15), a panel
exploring a new campus judicial system. Pfeiffer
had applied for the Committee on Student
Services (COSS) and Committee Chairman Beth
Garfield was competing for the position of
ASSU Faculty Senate representative against
David Garvin, another member of the
Nominations Committee.
In the latter case, Nilsson said, "We dismissed
every other person who applied." Garvin beat
out Garfield and also landed a position on the
Trustee Committee on Academic Affairs.
Herman, who lost his bid for a spot on the
C-15 to O'Grady, did manage to secure a place

on the coveted C-US but at the expense of
incumbent C-US member Doyle McManus,
whom Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs described as "one of the most qualified
students on the committee."
'Most Annoyed'
"I was most annoyed at this vote," O'Grady
said. "Herman was elected over somebody who
by all counts had done an excellent job in the
past."
"Even more outrageous," O'Grady
continued, was Garvin's nomination to two
committees.
"I was qualified for the two committees for
which I ran," Garvin explained. "Vindication is
not really necessary, but I have been, in fact, a
very conscientious committee member."
ASSU Measure
A measure currently under consideration in
ASSU committees would prevent members of
the Nominations Committee from nominating
themselves to other committees and would limit
the number of committee seats a student could
occupy to only one.
Garvin said these restraints would be unwise,
because members of the Nominations
Committee are often best qualified for other
positions.
Qualified or not, Nilsson said that
people nominating themselves "looks
bad."
Reappointment
This year members of the
Nominations Committee Barbara
Glenn and 800 Bacon are applying for
reappointment to the Committee on
Education and Employment of
Women, and to the Committee on
Public Events, respectively. Herman is
applying for a position on the C-15
again this year.
With fewer Nominations
Committee members applying for

positions than last year, the screening
process is likely to be more free from
self-interest.
On the other hand, political
considerations may play as important (
a role as ever.
Bacon Speculates
Herman is likely to be "looking for
people he'll be able to work with next
year," Bacon speculated. Herman,
however, says he evaluates applicants
on their individual merits and
suitability to the committees they
apply for.
O'Grady put it this way, "It's like
democracy. It's the worst system
around, but everything else you come
up with is even worse."

This year members of the
Nominations Committee Barbara
Glenn and 800 Bacon are applying for
reappointment to the Committee on
Education and Employment of
Women, and to the Committee on
Public Events, respectively. Herman is
applying for a position on the C-15
again this year.
With fewer Nominations
Committee members applying for

positions than last year, the screening
process is likely to be more free from
self-interest.
On the other hand, political
considerations may play as important (
a role as ever.
Bacon Speculates
Herman is likely to be "looking for
people he'll be able to work with next
year," Bacon speculated. Herman,
however, says he evaluates applicants
on their individual merits and
suitability to the committees they
apply for.
O'Grady put it this way, "It's like
democracy. It's the worst system
around, but everything else you come
up with is even worse."
The ASSU Nominations Committee, which is
screening hundreds of student applicants for
committee openings this week, has functioned
smoothly so far. but before the selection process
is over "there's going to be some horsetrading,"
predicted committee member 800 Bacon.
"There are going to be some people
[candidates! who I am going to be hard-headed
and stubborn about (getting nominated],"
Bacon said flatly.
There's a good chance he won't see
eye-to-eye with Committee Chairman Mike
Herman. ASSU president, whose slate beat out
Bacon's in the recent ASSU election.
Although Bacon senses possible sources of
contention, the committee's more inexperienced
members seem to be unaware of potential
problems — and of the real problems which
beset last spring's committee.
Naivete
Lise Pfeiffer, a member of the Nominations
Committee last spring, recalls her initial naivete.
"I went in there with the idea of getting the best
applicants. . . but I didn't know the politics
involved — all the favors people would do for
you, if you'd do this for them."
"If anybody had seen the wav we voted last

spring," admitted former committee member
Mike Nilsson, "they would have been appalled."
Apparently, five of the committee's seven
members made a plan for other committee
openings. After bargaining with fellow members
for their votes, most landed comfortable seats
on committees of their choice — as a "kind of
reward," said Nilsson.
The Line-Up
Nilsson recalled last year's line-up: three
members of the committee were supporters of
then-ASSU President-Kevin O'Grady's council;
three others, including Herman, were leftover
supporters of one-time ASSU President Scott
Burke. "1 was sort of the swing vote," Nilsson
said.
He explained he played up to both sides to
help members get the positions they wanted.
But then his strategy backfired, he said, leaving
him with no friends — and worse — no
committee position.
According to, two reports, and by his own
admission, Nilsson then demanded all the votes
be re-taken. "This time I'll vote my conscience,"
Nilsson recalls saying.
Bargaining
Explaining how he felt then, he said, "1
realized after I didn't get on that committee
(Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid J

that I was sick of this kind of shit — of
bargaining back and forth."
"I made a fuss at the end," Nilsson said. He
said he threatened to block the rest of the
committee's nominations by refusing to endorse
the votes.
So then, Nilsson said, the Nominations
Committee "asked me what 1 wanted." Nilsson
singled out a spot on the Trustee Committee on
Budget Adjustments, and his fellow committee
members placated him by removing another
candidate and nominating Nilsson instead.
Competition
Meanwhile, Herman was aiming for both the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (C-US)
and for the Committee of 15 (C-15), a panel
exploring a new campus judicial system. Pfeiffer
had applied for the Committee on Student
Services (COSS) and Committee Chairman Beth
Garfield was competing for the position of
ASSU Faculty Senate representative against
David Garvin, another member of the
Nominations Committee.
In the latter case, Nilsson said, "We dismissed
every other person who applied." Garvin beat
out Garfield and also landed a position on the
Trustee Committee on Academic Affairs.
Herman, who lost his bid for a spot on the
C-15 to O'Grady, did manage to secure a place

on the coveted C-US but at the expense of
incumbent C-US member Doyle McManus,
whom Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs described as "one of the most qualified
students on the committee."
'Most Annoyed'
"I was most annoyed at this vote," O'Grady
said. "Herman was elected over somebody who
by all counts had done an excellent job in the
past."
"Even more outrageous," O'Grady
continued, was Garvin's nomination to two
committees.
"I was qualified for the two committees for
which I ran," Garvin explained. "Vindication is
not really necessary, but I have been, in fact, a
very conscientious committee member."
ASSU Measure
A measure currently under consideration in
ASSU committees would prevent members of
the Nominations Committee from nominating
themselves to other committees and would limit
the number of committee seats a student could
occupy to only one.
Garvin said these restraints would be unwise,
because members of the Nominations
Committee are often best qualified for other
positions.
Qualified or not, Nilsson said that
people nominating themselves "looks
bad."

"I was most annoyed at this vote," O'Grady
said. "Herman was elected over somebody who
by all counts had done an excellent job in the
past."
"Even more outrageous," O'Grady
continued, was Garvin's nomination to two
committees.
"I was qualified for the two committees for
which I ran," Garvin explained. "Vindication is
not really necessary, but I have been, in fact, a
very conscientious committee member."
ASSU Measure
A measure currently under consideration in
ASSU committees would prevent members of
the Nominations Committee from nominating
themselves to other committees and would limit
the number of committee seats a student could
occupy to only one.
Garvin said these restraints would be unwise,
because members of the Nominations
Committee are often best qualified for other
positions.
Qualified or not, Nilsson said that
people nominating themselves "looks
bad."
Reappointment
This year members of the
Nominations Committee Barbara
Glenn and 800 Bacon are applying for
reappointment to the Committee on
Education and Employment of
Women, and to the Committee on
Public Events, respectively. Herman is
applying for a position on the C-15
again this year.
With fewer Nominations
Committee members applying for

positions than last year, the screening
process is likely to be more free from
self-interest.
On the other hand, political
considerations may play as important (
a role as ever.
Bacon Speculates
Herman is likely to be "looking for
people he'll be able to work with next
year," Bacon speculated. Herman,
however, says he evaluates applicants
on their individual merits and
suitability to the committees they
apply for.
O'Grady put it this way, "It's like
democracy. It's the worst system
around, but everything else you come
up with is even worse."
The ASSU Nominations Committee, which is
screening hundreds of student applicants for
committee openings this week, has functioned
smoothly so far. but before the selection process
is over "there's going to be some horsetrading,"
predicted committee member 800 Bacon.
"There are going to be some people
[candidates! who I am going to be hard-headed
and stubborn about (getting nominated],"
Bacon said flatly.
There's a good chance he won't see
eye-to-eye with Committee Chairman Mike
Herman. ASSU president, whose slate beat out
Bacon's in the recent ASSU election.
Although Bacon senses possible sources of
contention, the committee's more inexperienced
members seem to be unaware of potential
problems — and of the real problems which
beset last spring's committee.
Naivete
Lise Pfeiffer, a member of the Nominations
Committee last spring, recalls her initial naivete.
"I went in there with the idea of getting the best
applicants. . . but I didn't know the politics
involved — all the favors people would do for
you, if you'd do this for them."
"If anybody had seen the wav we voted last

spring," admitted former committee member
Mike Nilsson, "they would have been appalled."
Apparently, five of the committee's seven
members made a plan for other committee
openings. After bargaining with fellow members
for their votes, most landed comfortable seats
on committees of their choice — as a "kind of
reward," said Nilsson.
The Line-Up
Nilsson recalled last year's line-up: three
members of the committee were supporters of
then-ASSU President-Kevin O'Grady's council;
three others, including Herman, were leftover
supporters of one-time ASSU President Scott
Burke. "1 was sort of the swing vote," Nilsson
said.
He explained he played up to both sides to
help members get the positions they wanted.
But then his strategy backfired, he said, leaving
him with no friends — and worse — no
committee position.
According to, two reports, and by his own
admission, Nilsson then demanded all the votes
be re-taken. "This time I'll vote my conscience,"
Nilsson recalls saying.
Bargaining
Explaining how he felt then, he said, "1
realized after I didn't get on that committee
(Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid J

that I was sick of this kind of shit — of
bargaining back and forth."
"I made a fuss at the end," Nilsson said. He
said he threatened to block the rest of the
committee's nominations by refusing to endorse
the votes.
So then, Nilsson said, the Nominations
Committee "asked me what 1 wanted." Nilsson
singled out a spot on the Trustee Committee on
Budget Adjustments, and his fellow committee
members placated him by removing another
candidate and nominating Nilsson instead.
Competition
Meanwhile, Herman was aiming for both the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (C-US)
and for the Committee of 15 (C-15), a panel
exploring a new campus judicial system. Pfeiffer
had applied for the Committee on Student
Services (COSS) and Committee Chairman Beth
Garfield was competing for the position of
ASSU Faculty Senate representative against
David Garvin, another member of the
Nominations Committee.
In the latter case, Nilsson said, "We dismissed
every other person who applied." Garvin beat
out Garfield and also landed a position on the
Trustee Committee on Academic Affairs.
Herman, who lost his bid for a spot on the
C-15 to O'Grady, did manage to secure a place

on the coveted C-US but at the expense of
incumbent C-US member Doyle McManus,
whom Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs described as "one of the most qualified
students on the committee."
'Most Annoyed'
"I was most annoyed at this vote," O'Grady
said. "Herman was elected over somebody who
by all counts had done an excellent job in the
past."
