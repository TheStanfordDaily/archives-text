Open Lagunita Spaces
Editor:
For years Lagunita residents
were exempted from the housing
draw. This was done by assigning
extra students to Lagunita
through the LOOP (Lagunita
Overcrowding Option).
Now that this unfair practice
has been abolished, why have
these spaces not been opened up
to everyone in the draw? The
additional capacity of Lagunita
dormitory has been proven and
there is an on-campus housing
shortage. Instead there will
actually be fewer students in
Lagunita next year.
If Manzanita Park is a
"temporary" solution to the
on-campus housing shortage, why
then does it not at least provide
more of a solution? If no new
dorms can be built, why aren't
there at least more trailers? Why
hasn't the one which burned last
year been replaced?
In short, why is nothing being
done about the housing shortage?

Nancy Packer wants more
students in the sciences to take
courses in the humanities; so do
most of us, including professors in
the sciences. I think her
suggestion of a humanities
three-course sequence for
freshmen a promising idea, and I
have no evidence that she is
prejudiced against foreign
language study.
Before any first-year courses
are declared not qualified to fulfill
the goals of the humanities, these
goals must be more clearly
defined than they are now, and
the courses thought not to qualify
examined in detail. At this point
it is still arguable that courses in
studio art, creative writing and
beginning language could fill the
bill.
But there are two points in
Packer's second article that
trouble me. Her reason for
rejecting first year language to
satisfy humanistic goals is that it
emphasizes vocabulary, grammar
and pronunciation. So it does, but
this argument would apply to
second, third, and fourth year,
even graduate courses in language.
However, these essential
elements in all language courses
do not exclude, from the first
year on, many others. Language at
Stanford is not, on any level,
presented as the mere acquisition
of a mechanical skill, nor is it ever
merely utilitarian; in many
respects language is culture, a
symbolic structure of human
reality.
The second point is Packer's
concluding remark that "special
interests" dictated the letter she .
was rebutting. This reminded me ,
that some years ago, when I was ,
arguing in the Academic Council ,
for retention of the language ,
requirement (a motion defeated ,
by a very small majority) a
professor of law charged me with ,
defending "vested interests." ,
Pushed to the limit, this j
sophistry effectively downgrades |
any argument in favor of a subject
put forward by its teachers. I ,
would therefore urge that the (
arguments of language teachers,
who are also humanists, be not ,
simply dismissed as selfish
parochialism when they oppose
measures affecting their discipline,
when they defend it, or when

Support For Horton
Editor:
During the past weeks much
attention has been drawn to the
issue of lack of communication
between Larry Horton, associate
dean of students for residential
education, and the student body.
We, the students on the
Committee on Services to
Students (COSS), have a few
things to say which may give some
insight into the situation. We feel
that Larry Horton's position has
not been fairly represented.
Throughout Winter Quarter,
we met two times a week or more
with Horton for the purpose of
discussing aspects of the Housing
System: the draw, faculty resident
and resident staff selection and
the new housing advisory panel.
Horton actively sought our
opinion and seemed to respect
any recommendations we made.
For example, we felt it was unfair
for a student to be thrown off
campus for two years in a row as a
result of a high draw number and
Horton changed the current
policy (see this year's draw
booklet).
He was also seeking other
students' opinions and seemed
open to students' suggestions and
comments about the housing
system. For students who want to
get in touch with him, we
recommend that they write or set
up an appointment with him,
since he usually has a very busy
schedule.
Before this year on COSS none
of us really took the time to find
out and analyze in depth aspects
of the housing system. We spent
much time and hard work,
working with Horton and his
office. It is a very complex system
which breaks down into different
complex units involving
guidelines, particular problems,
etc.
For the most part, the problem
in communication is not between
Horton and the students, but
between the students on COSS
and the rest of the student body.
COSS is the only University
committee which has a student
majority with six student
members, who were selected by
the ASSU Nominations
Committee. The Nominations
Committee selects students which
are the student input on all
University committees. They
provide intelligent insight and
input into University
policy-making and decisions.
Although we took time and
discussed the various issues with
the students where we live, it now
seems this was not enough.
Perhaps we should have made
ourselves more available.
Moreover, the way the ASSU
and the committee structure is set
up, there is no mechanism for
mass communication between the
various committees and the
student body at large. It would be
very helpful if the current
Nominations Committee or the
Council of Presidents could create
a mechanism, such as a
name-address-phone number
booklet of students on
committees with descriptions of
the committee by-laws, function,
etc., so that more students could
get in touch with committee
members if they chose to do so.

Support For Horton
Editor:
During the past weeks much
attention has been drawn to the
issue of lack of communication
between Larry Horton, associate
dean of students for residential
education, and the student body.
We, the students on the
Committee on Services to
Students (COSS), have a few
things to say which may give some
insight into the situation. We feel
that Larry Horton's position has
not been fairly represented.
Throughout Winter Quarter,
we met two times a week or more
with Horton for the purpose of
discussing aspects of the Housing
System: the draw, faculty resident
and resident staff selection and
the new housing advisory panel.
Horton actively sought our
opinion and seemed to respect
any recommendations we made.
For example, we felt it was unfair
for a student to be thrown off
campus for two years in a row as a
result of a high draw number and
Horton changed the current
policy (see this year's draw
booklet).
He was also seeking other
students' opinions and seemed
open to students' suggestions and
comments about the housing
system. For students who want to
get in touch with him, we
recommend that they write or set
up an appointment with him,
since he usually has a very busy
schedule.
Before this year on COSS none
of us really took the time to find
out and analyze in depth aspects
of the housing system. We spent
much time and hard work,
working with Horton and his
office. It is a very complex system
which breaks down into different
complex units involving
guidelines, particular problems,
etc.
For the most part, the problem
in communication is not between
Horton and the students, but
between the students on COSS
and the rest of the student body.
COSS is the only University
committee which has a student
majority with six student
members, who were selected by
the ASSU Nominations
Committee. The Nominations
Committee selects students which
are the student input on all
University committees. They
provide intelligent insight and
input into University
policy-making and decisions.
Although we took time and
discussed the various issues with
the students where we live, it now
seems this was not enough.
Perhaps we should have made
ourselves more available.
Moreover, the way the ASSU
and the committee structure is set
up, there is no mechanism for
mass communication between the
various committees and the
student body at large. It would be
very helpful if the current
Nominations Committee or the
Council of Presidents could create
a mechanism, such as a
name-address-phone number
booklet of students on
committees with descriptions of
the committee by-laws, function,
etc., so that more students could
get in touch with committee
members if they chose to do so.

Open Lagunita Spaces
Editor:
For years Lagunita residents
were exempted from the housing
draw. This was done by assigning
extra students to Lagunita
through the LOOP (Lagunita
Overcrowding Option).
Now that this unfair practice
has been abolished, why have
these spaces not been opened up
to everyone in the draw? The
additional capacity of Lagunita
dormitory has been proven and
there is an on-campus housing
shortage. Instead there will
actually be fewer students in
Lagunita next year.
If Manzanita Park is a
"temporary" solution to the
on-campus housing shortage, why
then does it not at least provide
more of a solution? If no new
dorms can be built, why aren't
there at least more trailers? Why
hasn't the one which burned last
year been replaced?
In short, why is nothing being
done about the housing shortage?

Before any first-year courses

it is still arguable that courses in

But there are two points in

rejecting first year language to
satisfy humanistic goals is that it
emphasizes vocabulary, grammar
and pronunciation. So it does, but
this argument would apply to
second, third, and fourth year,
even graduate courses in language.

recommend that they write or set
up an appointment with him,
since he usually has a very busy
schedule.
Before this year on COSS none
of us really took the time to find
out and analyze in depth aspects
of the housing system. We spent
much time and hard work,
working with Horton and his
office. It is a very complex system
which breaks down into different
complex units involving
guidelines, particular problems,
etc.
For the most part, the problem
in communication is not between
Horton and the students, but
between the students on COSS
and the rest of the student body.
COSS is the only University
committee which has a student
majority with six student
members, who were selected by
the ASSU Nominations
Committee. The Nominations
Committee selects students which
are the student input on all
University committees. They
provide intelligent insight and
input into University
policy-making and decisions.
Although we took time and
discussed the various issues with
the students where we live, it now
seems this was not enough.
Perhaps we should have made
ourselves more available.
Moreover, the way the ASSU
and the committee structure is set
up, there is no mechanism for
mass communication between the
various committees and the
student body at large. It would be
very helpful if the current
Nominations Committee or the
Council of Presidents could create
a mechanism, such as a
name-address-phone number
booklet of students on
committees with descriptions of
the committee by-laws, function,
etc., so that more students could
get in touch with committee
members if they chose to do so.

Open Lagunita Spaces
Editor:
For years Lagunita residents
were exempted from the housing
draw. This was done by assigning
extra students to Lagunita
through the LOOP (Lagunita
Overcrowding Option).
Now that this unfair practice
has been abolished, why have
these spaces not been opened up
to everyone in the draw? The
additional capacity of Lagunita
dormitory has been proven and
there is an on-campus housing
shortage. Instead there will
actually be fewer students in
Lagunita next year.
If Manzanita Park is a
"temporary" solution to the
on-campus housing shortage, why
then does it not at least provide
more of a solution? If no new
dorms can be built, why aren't
there at least more trailers? Why
hasn't the one which burned last
year been replaced?
In short, why is nothing being
done about the housing shortage?

On Language Courses
Editor:
Nancy Packer wants more
students in the sciences to take
courses in the humanities; so do
most of us, including professors in
the sciences. I think her
suggestion of a humanities
three-course sequence for
freshmen a promising idea, and I
have no evidence that she is
prejudiced against foreign
language study.
Before any first-year courses
are declared not qualified to fulfill
the goals of the humanities, these
goals must be more clearly
defined than they are now, and
the courses thought not to qualify
examined in detail. At this point
it is still arguable that courses in
studio art, creative writing and
beginning language could fill the
bill.
But there are two points in
Packer's second article that
trouble me. Her reason for
rejecting first year language to
satisfy humanistic goals is that it
emphasizes vocabulary, grammar
and pronunciation. So it does, but
this argument would apply to
second, third, and fourth year,
even graduate courses in language.
However, these essential
elements in all language courses
do not exclude, from the first
year on, many others. Language at
Stanford is not, on any level,
presented as the mere acquisition
of a mechanical skill, nor is it ever
merely utilitarian; in many
respects language is culture, a
symbolic structure of human
reality.
The second point is Packer's
concluding remark that "special
interests" dictated the letter she .
was rebutting. This reminded me ,
that some years ago, when I was ,
arguing in the Academic Council ,
for retention of the language ,
requirement (a motion defeated ,
by a very small majority) a
professor of law charged me with ,
defending "vested interests." ,
Pushed to the limit, this j
sophistry effectively downgrades |
any argument in favor of a subject
put forward by its teachers. I ,
would therefore urge that the (
arguments of language teachers,
who are also humanists, be not ,
simply dismissed as selfish
parochialism when they oppose
measures affecting their discipline,
when they defend it, or when
they explain it.

Editor:
During the past weeks much
attention has been drawn to the
issue of lack of communication
between Larry Horton, associate
dean of students for residential
education, and the student body.
We, the students on the
Committee on Services to
Students (COSS), have a few
things to say which may give some
insight into the situation. We feel
that Larry Horton's position has
not been fairly represented.
Throughout Winter Quarter,
we met two times a week or more
with Horton for the purpose of
discussing aspects of the Housing
System: the draw, faculty resident
and resident staff selection and
the new housing advisory panel.
Horton actively sought our
opinion and seemed to respect
any recommendations we made.
For example, we felt it was unfair
for a student to be thrown off
campus for two years in a row as a
result of a high draw number and
Horton changed the current
policy (see this year's draw
booklet).
He was also seeking other
students' opinions and seemed
open to students' suggestions and
comments about the housing
system. For students who want to
get in touch with him, we
recommend that they write or set
