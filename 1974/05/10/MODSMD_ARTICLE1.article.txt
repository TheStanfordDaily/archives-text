# Berk: Union Set To Walk Out Monday
## Optional Rebates Offered; Hashers Won't Lose Jobs 
### WILLIAM ROSS, KEVIN SMITH MARK SIMONIAN 
Optional rebates will be given to
students by the University Food
Service if the United Stanford
F hployees (USE) strike materializes
Sunday as scheduled, Edward Scoles,
director of housing and food services,
announced yesterday.
Scoles also stated that student
hashers who refused to cross picket
lines would not lose their jobs.
The University will almost certainly
nt »t contract with TDS Inc. to provide
meals at Tresidder Union for students,
Scoles said. "That would be an
administrative nightmare," he
declared.
Students must decide by "Tuesday
at the latest" whether they will eat in
Wilbur or Stern Hall food services
- the only ones scheduled to remain
open — or accept a rebate from the
University, Scoles said.
"I think two days is adequate time
to decide wheter you want to be in
or out," he explained.
$3.59 A Day
According to Scoles, students
taking a full board plan will be
refunded $3.59 a day while students
with other board plans will receive
proportionally less money.
For those students who choose to
accept rebates, Scoles said, "We'll
scrape the labels [off the meal cards]
so that [they're] no longer valid in a
dining room." According to Scoles,
students would receive new stickers if
and when they re-enter the food
system.
Scoles added, "We think we'll
probably let people back in [to the
f\>d service plan] at any time." But
hv said that students who come back
v.to the food system must remain
there for the rest of the strike. "Once
out, and once back in," he cautioned.
The University is planning for the
strike on a week-by-week basis, Scoles
said, so that "students who have opted
t. at will have to renew their opting
out" at the end of each week if the
strike continues for more than one
week.
Credit Preferred
Although Scoles emphasized that

he would prefer to have students take
their rebates in credit form, he noted
that it would be possible to receive
cash rebates.
It is still uncertain where students
can go to participate in the rebate
plan, but Scoles said he thought it
might be set up in the Student
Accounting Office in the Old Union so
that students could "walk to the next
window" and receive their rebates or
make credit arrangements.
Scoles noted that the Food Service
has the right to fire any hasher who
fails to report for work three
consecutive times. But a strike "is not
a normal situation," Scoles observed,
and the Food Service would ignore the
general policy.
Food service employees would not
be fired either, Scoles remarked.
At a meeting of 60 Wilbur hashers
in the Rinconada dining room last
night, Wilbur food service manager
Kay Malik said, "If you choose not to
work, you must have your [meal]
label removed." This will apply to all

president, converses with Douglas Barton, University negotiator, prior to a
special ASSU Senate meeting yesterday. Berk confirmed that the union would
go on strike Monday.
the University had offered a $500
minimum pay rate for the first year
and $525 for the second year of the
contract.
Seniority would also be the priority
factor in determining layoffs when the
skill and the ability of two workers is
about the same.
These concessions were far from
adequate in meeting union demands,
Berk said.
Berk vowed last night to shut down
many vital areas in the University by
the strike.
He said that the union would not

interfere with vital patient cart'
services at the hospital and would
allow hospital workers to pass through
the picket lines.
Since the steam plant supplies
steam to the hospital as well as the rest
of the University, Berk said he would
allow steam to continue to be supplied
to the hospital if management shut off
steam from the rest of the University.
Otherwise, USE would shut the steam
plant down.

RELENTLESS NEGOTIATORS — Jim Berk, United Stanford Employees union
president, converses with Douglas Barton, University negotiator, prior to a
special ASSU Senate meeting yesterday. Berk confirmed that the union would
go on strike Monday.
the University had offered a $500
minimum pay rate for the first year
and $525 for the second year of the
contract.
Seniority would also be the priority
factor in determining layoffs when the
skill and the ability of two workers is
about the same.
These concessions were far from
adequate in meeting union demands,
Berk said.
Berk vowed last night to shut down
many vital areas in the University by
the strike.
He said that the union would not

interfere with vital patient cart'
services at the hospital and would
allow hospital workers to pass through
the picket lines.
Since the steam plant supplies
steam to the hospital as well as the rest
of the University, Berk said he would
allow steam to continue to be supplied
to the hospital if management shut off
steam from the rest of the University.
Otherwise, USE would shut the steam
plant down.
University administrators met with
student resident assistants last night in
Storey House and explained the
University's contingency plans.
Optional rebates will be given to
students by the University Food
Service if the United Stanford
F hployees (USE) strike materializes
Sunday as scheduled, Edward Scoles,
director of housing and food services,
announced yesterday.
Scoles also stated that student
hashers who refused to cross picket
lines would not lose their jobs.
The University will almost certainly
nt »t contract with TDS Inc. to provide
meals at Tresidder Union for students,
Scoles said. "That would be an
administrative nightmare," he
declared.
Students must decide by "Tuesday
at the latest" whether they will eat in
Wilbur or Stern Hall food services
- the only ones scheduled to remain
open — or accept a rebate from the
University, Scoles said.
"I think two days is adequate time
to decide wheter you want to be in
or out," he explained.
$3.59 A Day
According to Scoles, students
taking a full board plan will be
refunded $3.59 a day while students
with other board plans will receive
proportionally less money.
For those students who choose to
accept rebates, Scoles said, "We'll
scrape the labels [off the meal cards]
so that [they're] no longer valid in a
dining room." According to Scoles,
students would receive new stickers if
and when they re-enter the food
system.
Scoles added, "We think we'll
probably let people back in [to the
f\>d service plan] at any time." But
hv said that students who come back
v.to the food system must remain
there for the rest of the strike. "Once
out, and once back in," he cautioned.
The University is planning for the
strike on a week-by-week basis, Scoles
said, so that "students who have opted
t. at will have to renew their opting
out" at the end of each week if the
strike continues for more than one
week.
Credit Preferred
Although Scoles emphasized that

he would prefer to have students take
their rebates in credit form, he noted
that it would be possible to receive
cash rebates.
It is still uncertain where students
can go to participate in the rebate
plan, but Scoles said he thought it
might be set up in the Student
Accounting Office in the Old Union so
that students could "walk to the next
window" and receive their rebates or
make credit arrangements.
Scoles noted that the Food Service
has the right to fire any hasher who
fails to report for work three
consecutive times. But a strike "is not
a normal situation," Scoles observed,
and the Food Service would ignore the
general policy.
Food service employees would not
be fired either, Scoles remarked.
