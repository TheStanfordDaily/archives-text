# Languages Should Fulfill Distribution
## 
### 
Pauline Newman-Gordon

The following remarks are intended to
clarify some points raised in an article
entitled "Packer Report II" (Daily, May 3).
Prof. Nancy Packer asks what right I had in
my article of April 29 to characterize as
prejudice her view that first-year language
courses are unworthy of fulfilling the
distribution requirement in the humanities.
As an author of several works on French
literature and a professor of French who has
taught the gamut of courses from third-year
language to graduate seminars on French
literature, it seems to me that there is some
justification for my general concern.
I do not retract my statement that the
Packer Report expresses prejudice against
foreign languages. In a memo of April 15, the
Ad Hoc Committee requests guidelines from
the departments for the selection of courses
that ought and ought not to fulfil the
distribution requirement in the humanities. It
then procedes to program a response by
suggesting courses to be excluded. First-year
foreign language courses head the list.
What right have people in other disciplines
to decide that foreign language study does
not "fill the bill" as a means of satisfying the
area requirement? If teachers of studio art or
creative writing entertain such misgivings
about their own endeavors, they may have
valid reasons to do so. Nothing in my
experience justifies such an assertion in
regard to French Studies.
'Humanistic Value'
The students with whom I have come in
contact, are thoroughly convinced of the
humanistic value of language study. They
regard language proficiency not as a tool, but
a sensitive mode of awareness. Many of them
resent the implication that language study is
inferior to other forms of intellectual
inquiry.
The Packer Report does not question the
humanistic value of second or third year

language courses. But one needs no great
power of deduction to realize that these will
be affected adversely by the priorities the
Packer Report sets forth. Not surprisingly, in
this SES era, many high schools have
dropped the language requirement or diluted
it beyond recognition.
Therefore, at what point is a student
frankly encouraged to study foreign
languages? By using the first year college
course as its target, the Packer Report is
undermining the entire structure of the
college language curriculum. I fail to see
where this is a matter of "narrowly conceived
special interests."
Language Key Issue
The status of language study is and always
has been a key issue of educational policy
and a university-wide concern. The advantage
to be gained by attracting a few hasty and
impatient students to the humanities via the
Packer method, must be weighed against the
danger of discrediting the humanities sector
by depriving it of one of its vital ingredients.
Even the authors of SES were clear on this
point:
"We think it is especially appropriate to
single out language study . . .because . . it
is central to the serious study of the
humanities." (5E5,11,19-20).
In general, the freedom available to
non-humanists outside their discipline, is not
as limited as the Packer Report tends to
suggest. As a case in point, 40 percent of our
graduating French majors have double
majors, and many undergraduates who have
declared a French major are engaged in
pre-professional training in law or medicine.
Another Assertion Qualified
Enrollment figures make it necessary to
qualify another assertion, namely, that
students are continuing to study foreign
literatures in the language in which they were

written. For every 20 students who were
enrolled in such courses at Stanford before
the university-wide language requirement was
dropped in 1969, there are about five now. I
am speaking here of elective courses.
True, opportunities for this type of study
are prevalent in foreign universities. But
should the overseas curriculum become a
substitute for an academically viable one at
home?
Personally, I find the views that have
surfaced in the article entitled "Packer
Report II" disarmingly narrow and
provincial. What right has anyone to assume
that the discoveries of the great minds of our
times will necessarily be imparted in English?
Array Of Scholars
During the 19605, an array of highly
distinguished humanists visited the campus:
scholars like Raymond Picard, critics like
Roland Barthes, novelists like Claude Simon
and Nathalie Sarraute, poets like Francis
Ponge. They lectured in the language in
which they wrote to large student audiences
who were eager to initiate discussions.
If the Ad Hoc Committee has its way, it
will be necessary to restrict this kind of
dialogue to the English-speaking world. This
puts us back in the cultural lag of the early'
19505," when the acquisition of a reading
knowledge was the professed goal of language
study at Stanford.
Ultimately, opinions will differ on matters
of humanistic concern. But in this pluralistic
era, we have no right to confer privileged
status on some courses, while demoting
others. An exception could be made only if
there is total agreement among the people
best qualified to make such judgments.
Obviously, this is not the case in the issue at
hand.

The status of language study is and always
has been a key issue of educational policy
and a university-wide concern. The advantage
to be gained by attracting a few hasty and
impatient students to the humanities via the
Packer method, must be weighed against the
danger of discrediting the humanities sector
by depriving it of one of its vital ingredients.
Even the authors of SES were clear on this
point:
"We think it is especially appropriate to
single out language study . . .because . . it
is central to the serious study of the
humanities." (5E5,11,19-20).
In general, the freedom available to
non-humanists outside their discipline, is not
as limited as the Packer Report tends to
suggest. As a case in point, 40 percent of our
graduating French majors have double
majors, and many undergraduates who have
declared a French major are engaged in
pre-professional training in law or medicine.
Another Assertion Qualified
Enrollment figures make it necessary to
qualify another assertion, namely, that
students are continuing to study foreign
literatures in the language in which they were

written. For every 20 students who were
enrolled in such courses at Stanford before
the university-wide language requirement was
dropped in 1969, there are about five now. I
am speaking here of elective courses.
True, opportunities for this type of study
are prevalent in foreign universities. But
should the overseas curriculum become a
substitute for an academically viable one at
home?
Personally, I find the views that have
surfaced in the article entitled "Packer
Report II" disarmingly narrow and
provincial. What right has anyone to assume
that the discoveries of the great minds of our
times will necessarily be imparted in English?
Array Of Scholars
During the 19605, an array of highly
distinguished humanists visited the campus:
scholars like Raymond Picard, critics like
Roland Barthes, novelists like Claude Simon
and Nathalie Sarraute, poets like Francis
Ponge. They lectured in the language in
which they wrote to large student audiences
who were eager to initiate discussions.
If the Ad Hoc Committee has its way, it
will be necessary to restrict this kind of
dialogue to the English-speaking world. This
puts us back in the cultural lag of the early'
19505," when the acquisition of a reading
knowledge was the professed goal of language
study at Stanford.
Ultimately, opinions will differ on matters
of humanistic concern. But in this pluralistic
era, we have no right to confer privileged
status on some courses, while demoting
others. An exception could be made only if
there is total agreement among the people
best qualified to make such judgments.
Obviously, this is not the case in the issue at
hand.

The following remarks are intended to
clarify some points raised in an article
entitled "Packer Report II" (Daily, May 3).
Prof. Nancy Packer asks what right I had in
my article of April 29 to characterize as
prejudice her view that first-year language
courses are unworthy of fulfilling the
distribution requirement in the humanities.
As an author of several works on French
literature and a professor of French who has
taught the gamut of courses from third-year
language to graduate seminars on French
literature, it seems to me that there is some
justification for my general concern.
I do not retract my statement that the
Packer Report expresses prejudice against
foreign languages. In a memo of April 15, the
Ad Hoc Committee requests guidelines from
the departments for the selection of courses
that ought and ought not to fulfil the
distribution requirement in the humanities. It
then procedes to program a response by
suggesting courses to be excluded. First-year
foreign language courses head the list.
What right have people in other disciplines
to decide that foreign language study does
not "fill the bill" as a means of satisfying the
area requirement? If teachers of studio art or
creative writing entertain such misgivings
about their own endeavors, they may have
valid reasons to do so. Nothing in my
experience justifies such an assertion in
regard to French Studies.
'Humanistic Value'
The students with whom I have come in
contact, are thoroughly convinced of the
humanistic value of language study. They
regard language proficiency not as a tool, but
a sensitive mode of awareness. Many of them
resent the implication that language study is
inferior to other forms of intellectual
inquiry.
The Packer Report does not question the
humanistic value of second or third year

language courses. But one needs no great
power of deduction to realize that these will
be affected adversely by the priorities the
Packer Report sets forth. Not surprisingly, in
this SES era, many high schools have
dropped the language requirement or diluted
it beyond recognition.
Therefore, at what point is a student
frankly encouraged to study foreign
languages? By using the first year college
course as its target, the Packer Report is
undermining the entire structure of the
college language curriculum. I fail to see
where this is a matter of "narrowly conceived
special interests."

knowledge was the professed goal of language
study at Stanford.
Ultimately, opinions will differ on matters
of humanistic concern. But in this pluralistic

Obviously, this is not the case in the issue at

The following remarks are intended to
clarify some points raised in an article
entitled "Packer Report II" (Daily, May 3).
Prof. Nancy Packer asks what right I had in
my article of April 29 to characterize as
prejudice her view that first-year language
courses are unworthy of fulfilling the
distribution requirement in the humanities.
As an author of several works on French
literature and a professor of French who has
taught the gamut of courses from third-year
language to graduate seminars on French
literature, it seems to me that there is some
justification for my general concern.
I do not retract my statement that the
Packer Report expresses prejudice against
foreign languages. In a memo of April 15, the
Ad Hoc Committee requests guidelines from
the departments for the selection of courses
that ought and ought not to fulfil the
distribution requirement in the humanities. It
then procedes to program a response by
suggesting courses to be excluded. First-year
foreign language courses head the list.
What right have people in other disciplines
to decide that foreign language study does
not "fill the bill" as a means of satisfying the
area requirement? If teachers of studio art or
creative writing entertain such misgivings
about their own endeavors, they may have
valid reasons to do so. Nothing in my
experience justifies such an assertion in
regard to French Studies.
'Humanistic Value'
The students with whom I have come in
contact, are thoroughly convinced of the
humanistic value of language study. They
regard language proficiency not as a tool, but
a sensitive mode of awareness. Many of them
resent the implication that language study is
inferior to other forms of intellectual
inquiry.
The Packer Report does not question the
humanistic value of second or third year

language courses. But one needs no great
power of deduction to realize that these will
be affected adversely by the priorities the
Packer Report sets forth. Not surprisingly, in
this SES era, many high schools have
dropped the language requirement or diluted
it beyond recognition.
Therefore, at what point is a student
frankly encouraged to study foreign
languages? By using the first year college
course as its target, the Packer Report is
undermining the entire structure of the
college language curriculum. I fail to see
where this is a matter of "narrowly conceived
special interests."
Language Key Issue
The status of language study is and always
has been a key issue of educational policy
and a university-wide concern. The advantage
to be gained by attracting a few hasty and
impatient students to the humanities via the
Packer method, must be weighed against the
danger of discrediting the humanities sector
by depriving it of one of its vital ingredients.
Even the authors of SES were clear on this
point:
"We think it is especially appropriate to
single out language study . . .because . . it
is central to the serious study of the
humanities." (5E5,11,19-20).
In general, the freedom available to
non-humanists outside their discipline, is not
as limited as the Packer Report tends to
suggest. As a case in point, 40 percent of our
graduating French majors have double
majors, and many undergraduates who have
declared a French major are engaged in
pre-professional training in law or medicine.
Another Assertion Qualified
Enrollment figures make it necessary to
qualify another assertion, namely, that
students are continuing to study foreign
literatures in the language in which they were

written. For every 20 students who were
enrolled in such courses at Stanford before
the university-wide language requirement was
dropped in 1969, there are about five now. I
am speaking here of elective courses.
True, opportunities for this type of study
are prevalent in foreign universities. But
should the overseas curriculum become a
substitute for an academically viable one at
home?
Personally, I find the views that have
surfaced in the article entitled "Packer
Report II" disarmingly narrow and
provincial. What right has anyone to assume
that the discoveries of the great minds of our
times will necessarily be imparted in English?
Array Of Scholars
During the 19605, an array of highly
distinguished humanists visited the campus:
scholars like Raymond Picard, critics like
Roland Barthes, novelists like Claude Simon
and Nathalie Sarraute, poets like Francis
Ponge. They lectured in the language in
which they wrote to large student audiences
who were eager to initiate discussions.
If the Ad Hoc Committee has its way, it
will be necessary to restrict this kind of
dialogue to the English-speaking world. This
puts us back in the cultural lag of the early'
19505," when the acquisition of a reading
knowledge was the professed goal of language
study at Stanford.
Ultimately, opinions will differ on matters
of humanistic concern. But in this pluralistic
era, we have no right to confer privileged
status on some courses, while demoting
others. An exception could be made only if
there is total agreement among the people
best qualified to make such judgments.
Obviously, this is not the case in the issue at
hand.
