# Flournoy--New Republican Liberal
## 
### 
Kathy Batts

Joan Hinman's article (Daily,
May 3) implied that there is a
"danger" of Republicans
"creeping back to the governor's
mansion" in 1974. My question is,
where is the danger?
This year Californians have an
excellent chance to elect one of
the best qualified men to ever run
for the post of governor in this
state — Houston Flournoy.
With the help of a relatively
new liberal wing of the
Republican party, he will be
elected. But it will not be another
four years of Reagan and his
politics. It promises to be an
administration of honesty,
integrity, and solid leadership for
California.
Watergate has produced many
problems for Republicans
everywhere. People seem to lump
everything together, so that all
Republicans are viewed as racist,
bigotted war-hawks who love
Richard Nixon and run corrupt
political campaigns. This is not
necessarily so. Republicans may
have their Nixons and their
Reagans, but they also have Pete
McCloskey, Edward Brooke, and
Elliot Richardson.
Registration in the different
political parties always tends to
get confused. Many people
became Democrats in 1972, so
they could help George
McGovern, just as many are now
registering Republican to help
Pete McCloskey. Neither party is
any more guilty of this than the
other.
But stop just a moment and
think about the basic differences
which exist between the two
parties. Republicans place high

priorities on the freedom and
responsibility of the individual.
Democrats opt for collective
responsibility of society for each
of its members.
Republicans believe in local
control in government wherever
possible. Democrats favor
centralized federal control.
Republicans strive for fiscal
responsibility, retaining more tax
money at community and state
levels, where it can be applied to
local problems. The Democrats

tend to funnel more dollars to the
federal government for their large
federal programs.
I cannot say which party is the
more correct. Both philosophies
can be good, if applied to the
right problems. But party labels
should not be the controlling
factor in any election. Voting the
man and not the party is still the
best means. But party affiliation
can give one an idea of what the
candidates believe in.
I am registered with the

Republican party because I agree
with the ideals set forth by that
party. Pete McCloskey and Hugh
Flournoy are likewise Republicans
because they too believe in basic
Republican ideals. And given the
chance, McCloskey, Flournoy,
and other Republicans like them
can solve the problems
confronting Congress and
California in the years ahead.

can give one an idea of what the
candidates believe in.
I am registered with the

Republican party because I agree
with the ideals set forth by that
party. Pete McCloskey and Hugh
Flournoy are likewise Republicans
because they too believe in basic
Republican ideals. And given the
chance, McCloskey, Flournoy,
and other Republicans like them
can solve the problems
confronting Congress and
California in the years ahead.

Joan Hinman's article (Daily,
May 3) implied that there is a
"danger" of Republicans
"creeping back to the governor's
mansion" in 1974. My question is,
where is the danger?
This year Californians have an
excellent chance to elect one of
the best qualified men to ever run
for the post of governor in this
state — Houston Flournoy.
With the help of a relatively
new liberal wing of the
Republican party, he will be
elected. But it will not be another
four years of Reagan and his
politics. It promises to be an
administration of honesty,
integrity, and solid leadership for
California.
Watergate has produced many
problems for Republicans
everywhere. People seem to lump
everything together, so that all
Republicans are viewed as racist,
bigotted war-hawks who love
Richard Nixon and run corrupt
political campaigns. This is not
necessarily so. Republicans may
have their Nixons and their
Reagans, but they also have Pete
McCloskey, Edward Brooke, and
Elliot Richardson.
Registration in the different
political parties always tends to
get confused. Many people
became Democrats in 1972, so
they could help George
McGovern, just as many are now
registering Republican to help
Pete McCloskey. Neither party is
any more guilty of this than the
other.
But stop just a moment and
think about the basic differences
which exist between the two
parties. Republicans place high

priorities on the freedom and
responsibility of the individual.
Democrats opt for collective
responsibility of society for each
of its members.
Republicans believe in local
control in government wherever
possible. Democrats favor
centralized federal control.
Republicans strive for fiscal
responsibility, retaining more tax
money at community and state
levels, where it can be applied to
local problems. The Democrats

tend to funnel more dollars to the
federal government for their large
federal programs.
I cannot say which party is the
more correct. Both philosophies
can be good, if applied to the
right problems. But party labels
should not be the controlling
factor in any election. Voting the
man and not the party is still the
best means. But party affiliation
can give one an idea of what the
candidates believe in.
