# Gibbs And SCIRE Funding
## 
### 
Friedenthal et 01.

On May 7 the Daily published a front page
article regarding the difficulty of Dean Gibbs in
obtaining funding for SWOPSI and SCIRE. Gibbs
was quoted as saying, "Part of the problem was
that it took the SCIRE Policy Board so long to
decide what they wanted to do."
To the extent this statement is true, it is the
fault of Gibbs and not of the SCIRE Board, since
the Board operated well within the time limits
required for submission of its program for next
year. Indeed, we believe that after deciding in late
October to work with the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies (ODUS) to rebuild SCIRE,
the Board moved very quickly.
On November 29, 1973, a community meeting
was held to discuss future directions for SCIRE. By
January 22, 1974, the Policy Board had set
program priorities and formed subcommittees to
develop a writing proposal.
A draft of this proposal was completed by
February 26, revisions were made, and it was
finalized by March 26. It was approved by the
Board on April 2, and formally submitted to the
Dean on April 9.
The Dean had asked that budget requests be

submitted by April 15. Throughout these
deliberations the Dean was in continual contact
with the Board through his designate Michael
Closson. Closson served as an active and valuable
participant in the planning process.
At no time was the Board made aware of ODUS'
financial problems. On the contrary, we were
encouraged to proceed with the submission of the
proposal. Therefore it was somewhat of a shock
when the Dean announced to the Board on April
30, 1974, that funding was not available from
regular ODUS sources and that we must seek
funding from other sources. He also cited the
energy crisis and the USE negotiations as
contributing factors to his budgetary problems.
Gibbs is also quoted as saying the Board is
"unduly pessimistic" about his ability ultimately to
obtain the necessary funds. Perhaps he is right; but
this pessimism results directly from the fact that
the Board, having worked diligently all year to
design a revitalized program, suddenly learned,
without prior warning, that its work could be in
vain due to lack of sufficient financial support.
