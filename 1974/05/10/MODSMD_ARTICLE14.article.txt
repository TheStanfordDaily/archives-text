# More On Flores

Rosenzweig

Prof. Harold Kahn, in his
column "On the Flores Case""
(Daily, May 8), invites his readers
to review my attitudes toward
Flores and his role as a faculty
member in the political actions of
the recent past. Kahn apparently
thinks he knows, but others may
not, so I will spare them the
trouble of remembering or trying
to find out.
First, a necessary word aboi(|
process. As a member of the
Provost's staff I would ordinarily
read the file that accompanies a
promotion to tenure
recommended by a Dean to the
Provost. Flores was turned down
at the Dean's level, thus his case
has not come to the Provost, andfc
have not read it.
I have no knowledge, and
therefore no opinion, on the
academic merits of Flores'
promotion. I do recall reading
Flores' file in 1971 when he was
recommended and approved fqr
reappointment — a fact that Kahn
neglects to mention, perhaps
because he finds it inconvenient
to his theory.
In any event, three years have
passed since then and I would not
presume to judge an individual'®
performance or promise withou,
having seen the evidence from
that important period.
Flores' Politics
But the question asks my
attitude about Flores' politics and
his role as a faculty member i$
political action. It is interesting
that Kahn should be the one (q
ask the question because I cds
recall grouping Flores and Kahn in
my mind as "movement" figures
of very little consequence.
I did not think of either as a
person whose position made mucf
impact on events one way .»r the
other. They differed only in one
respect that still remains salient at
this distance from events: where
Kahn seems in memory to have
been forpver talking, I have no
memory of Flores as a public
figure. Either he did not talk ver
much or what he said was not
very memorable.
I may be wrong in mjr
judgment of Flores' role, but
whether I am right or wrong is
unimportant. In the first place, it
would be my judgment — corresf.
or incorrect — that would affect
my actions. And in the much
more important second place, my
opinion, were it asked, on
whether Flores should be
promoted, would have nothing to
do with my assessment of his
political views or the effectivenw >
with which he promoted them. |
Actions Need Comment
Flores' actions need speci il
comment, and Kahn is right to
call attention to them, for ore
might argue that they have
particular bearing on the case.
Actually, I think not. My oWn
view is that, if Flores' actioins
were of sufficient gravity to call
into question his fitness to remdsn
a member of the faculty, then tHo
procedures for removing him frtjgi
the faculty should have
invoked at that time. Having
failed to do so, both tfrie
administration and the faculty
have forfeited the right to
consider those actions as ftn
element in the promotiqjn
decision. L
l 1
That principle is clearly
expressed in the Statement oji
Academic Freedom, recently
passed by the Faculty Senate, and
its presence in that Statement lis
no more than an articulation ofi ja
generally accepted principle in tb< i
University. k
I doubt whether this reply tejlls
Kahn anything he doesn't already
know. So perhaps I should end bin
a note that may surprise him:.l
strongly agree with him on tHe
need to describe more clearly a id
more publicly the standards us; \
in the judgment of tenure cas^.
The Committee on tHe
Professoriate has recommended
just that, and I support tjhe
recommendation. The effort df
writing such statements will be
instructive to those in the faculfr"
and administration who make
tenure decisions; the issuance of
such statements should help to
reduce anxiety among junior
faculty who are to be judged; arid
one helpful by-product might be
to make it more difficult ft>r
people like Hal Kahn to invi't
criteria that don't exist, likfe:
Don't publish a book too eajiiy
because failure to publish another
will be held against you. Come tun,
Hal.
