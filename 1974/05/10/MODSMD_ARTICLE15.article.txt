*Questions and answers for employees from the University

Ever since United Stanford Employees pre
sented its initial contract proposals in mid-
November, the University has made a sustained
effort to reach a mutually acceptable contract
through the collective bargaining process.
That effort has continued this week, and
will go on as long as union representatives con
tinue to meet over the bargaining table with the
University.
Since the union advanced its deadline for
negotiations and set a tentative strike date of
Sunday night, May 12, a number of questions
have arisen concerning the status of employees
and others in the event of a strike.
The following series of questions and an
swers has been prepared by several University
offices in an effort to answer some of the most
frequently asked questions concerning employ
ees and to correct some of the misapprehensions
based on rumors of what might happen in the
event of a strike.
Q. If USE were to call a strike would Stan
ford University remain open and continue opera
tions?
A. Yes. Stanford University has a responsi
bility and a commitment to all members of the
community to stay open and to continue to
function as normally as possible.
Q. Would I have a right to work in my
University job during a strike?
A. Yes. Every employee of Stanford Uni
versity whether or not in the bargaining unit and
whether or not a member of USE has a legal
right to work during a strike, and may not
lawfully be prevented from working by those
who do wish to strike.
Q. Are striking employees or union repre
sentatives permitted to prevent me from going
to work?
A. No. Every employee has a right to work
and have free access to his or her place of
employment. Picketing is required by law to be
peaceful and may not be conducted so as to
interfere with an employee's access to work. We
believe that the USE leadership and striking em
ployees would want to conduct themselves in a
peaceful and lawful manner during any strike.
Q. If ! am prevented from getting to work
by pickets, will the University assist me in reach
ing my place of employment?
A. Yes. If you want to work during a
strike, the University will help ensure that you
are able to get to your job.
If you have any trouble in getting to your
place of employment because of pickets, please
telephone the University Operations Center at
497-1024.
Q. What if I am prevented from doing my
work?
A. If there is a disruption, call the campus
police at ext. 7-3444. Tell them what has hap
/

pened, and ask their advice. Try to record what
you saw or heard as quickly and completely as
possible.
Q. As a USE member, would I be subject
to penalty if I crossed a picket line?
A. Every employee has a right to work and
to cross picket lines even if a union member.
However, USE members, because of their mem
bership status, may be fined for crossing a picket
line or refusing to honor a strike which the
union has called. Union members may lawfully
avoid such fines oniy by resigning their member
ship in the union before grossing a picket line or
working during a strike.
Q. What if I am not a USE member?
A. If an employee is not a USE member,
then he or she cannot be fined by the union for
working during a strike.
Q. When USE and the University sign a
contract, can I be forced to join the union?
A. No. The union shop question is current
ly being negotiated. The University has proposed
a modified union shop, so that those now in the
bargaining unit who are not USE members when
a contract is signed could not be forced to join
the union.
USE has proposed an agency shop, which
does not require union membership. The most
an employee in the bargaining unit could legally
be required to do is pay amounts equivalent to
periodic dues and initiation fees. Employees can
not be forced to perform any other membership
requirements.
Q. Do employees have a legal right to
strike?
A. Yes. But under federal law only non
supervisory personnel have rights to strike if
they choose. Supervisory personnel may be re
quired to work during a strike.
Moreover, those employees who currently
are working under collective bargaining agree
ments must honor commitments not to strike.
Q. Can an employee lose his or her job if
he or she goes on strike?
A. A nonsupervisory employee has a right
to reinstatement after a lawful strike unless he
or she has been permanently replaced or engages
in misconduct during the strike. An employer
may hire replacements in order to continue op
erations during a strike. Employees who are per
manently replaced lose any right to reinstate
ment immediately upon conclusion of a strike,
but may apply for any available openings or wait
until their former job becomes open again.
Q. Will those employees who do not work
during a strike be paid their regular Stanford
wages and benefits?
A. No. An employer is not required to pay
employees who are on strike. Therefore, em
ployees who strike or respect i\ picket line will
receive no wages for the time during which they
do not work, and additionally, will not receive

for that period various University benefits such
as vacation accrual and University contributions
to a striking employees' pension or health insur
ance plans.
Q. If I chose to strike, could I continue my
basic health plan and major medical coverage at
my own expense?
A. Yes. When processing the May 22 pay
roll, the University will automatically deduct
, from any striking employee's paycheck the
amount normally deducted plus the University's
usual contribution toward these coverages.
Those striking employees who wish to can
cel this coverage should contact the Benefits
Office in Personnel at the Old Pavilion (ext.
7-1777) or SLAC (ext. 28-2357 or 2358) no
later than May 1 5.
Q. What about long-term disability insur
ance?
A. Individuals who chose to go on strike or
observe a picket line will not receive this cover
age, since it normally is paid by the University.
Q. What about sick leave during a strike?
A. In the event of a strike, University man
agers and supervisors will require sufficient evi
dence of medical disability when approving the
use of sick leave by University employees.
Guide memo 22.6 of the University's ad
ministrative guide specifies that a supervisor
should ascertain the reason for absence and is
authorized to require medical evidence or other
evidence of disability before approving the use
of sick leave.
II no such acceptable evidence is provided
by the employee, the period of absence will be
treated as an unauthorized leave without salary.
Q. What about vacations during a strike?
A. If your vacation scheduled was ap
proved before May 1 and you are not a super
visor, you may proceed as planned without pen
alty.
Vacation schedules approved after May 1
will be automatically cancelled as of the first
day of any strike called by USE. All employees,
including supervisors and managers, on vacations
approved after May 1 will be considered to be
on unauthorized leave without salary as of the
first day of a strike.
If you have other questions concerning a
possible strike, discuss them first with your
supervisor. If further clarification is still needed,
your supervisor can then call the office which
seems most appropriate or the Operations Cen
ter, ext. 7-1024, for more information.
In a period of uncertainty, try to act only
on accurate information. Remember that the
outcome of the negotiations will be a contract
by which all members of the University—super
visors and members of the bargaining unit—will
be bound.
Whether or not a strike occurs, it is impor
tant to keep in mind that the issues which cur
rently divide the union and the University will
be resolved. All of us then will continue working
together.

Q. If USE were to call a strike would Stan
ford University remain open and continue opera
tions?
A. Yes. Stanford University has a responsi
bility and a commitment to all members of the
community to stay open and to continue to
function as normally as possible.
Q. Would I have a right to work in my
University job during a strike?
A. Yes. Every employee of Stanford Uni
versity whether or not in the bargaining unit and
whether or not a member of USE has a legal
right to work during a strike, and may not
lawfully be prevented from working by those
who do wish to strike.
Q. Are striking employees or union repre
sentatives permitted to prevent me from going
to work?
A. No. Every employee has a right to work
and have free access to his or her place of
employment. Picketing is required by law to be
peaceful and may not be conducted so as to
interfere with an employee's access to work. We
believe that the USE leadership and striking em
ployees would want to conduct themselves in a
peaceful and lawful manner during any strike.
Q. If ! am prevented from getting to work
by pickets, will the University assist me in reach
ing my place of employment?
A. Yes. If you want to work during a
strike, the University will help ensure that you
are able to get to your job.
If you have any trouble in getting to your
place of employment because of pickets, please
telephone the University Operations Center at
497-1024.
Q. What if I am prevented from doing my
work?
A. If there is a disruption, call the campus
police at ext. 7-3444. Tell them what has hap
/

pened, and ask their advice. Try to record what
you saw or heard as quickly and completely as
possible.
Q. As a USE member, would I be subject
to penalty if I crossed a picket line?
A. Every employee has a right to work and
to cross picket lines even if a union member.
However, USE members, because of their mem
bership status, may be fined for crossing a picket
line or refusing to honor a strike which the
union has called. Union members may lawfully
avoid such fines oniy by resigning their member
ship in the union before grossing a picket line or
working during a strike.
Q. What if I am not a USE member?
A. If an employee is not a USE member,
then he or she cannot be fined by the union for
working during a strike.
Q. When USE and the University sign a
contract, can I be forced to join the union?
A. No. The union shop question is current
ly being negotiated. The University has proposed
a modified union shop, so that those now in the
bargaining unit who are not USE members when
a contract is signed could not be forced to join
the union.
USE has proposed an agency shop, which
does not require union membership. The most
an employee in the bargaining unit could legally
be required to do is pay amounts equivalent to
periodic dues and initiation fees. Employees can
not be forced to perform any other membership
requirements.
Q. Do employees have a legal right to
strike?
A. Yes. But under federal law only non
supervisory personnel have rights to strike if
they choose. Supervisory personnel may be re
quired to work during a strike.
Moreover, those employees who currently
are working under collective bargaining agree
ments must honor commitments not to strike.
Q. Can an employee lose his or her job if
he or she goes on strike?
A. A nonsupervisory employee has a right
to reinstatement after a lawful strike unless he
or she has been permanently replaced or engages
in misconduct during the strike. An employer
may hire replacements in order to continue op
erations during a strike. Employees who are per
manently replaced lose any right to reinstate
ment immediately upon conclusion of a strike,
but may apply for any available openings or wait
until their former job becomes open again.
Q. Will those employees who do not work
during a strike be paid their regular Stanford
wages and benefits?
A. No. An employer is not required to pay
employees who are on strike. Therefore, em
ployees who strike or respect i\ picket line will
receive no wages for the time during which they
do not work, and additionally, will not receive

for that period various University benefits such
as vacation accrual and University contributions
to a striking employees' pension or health insur
ance plans.
Q. If I chose to strike, could I continue my
basic health plan and major medical coverage at
my own expense?
A. Yes. When processing the May 22 pay
roll, the University will automatically deduct
, from any striking employee's paycheck the
amount normally deducted plus the University's
usual contribution toward these coverages.
Those striking employees who wish to can
cel this coverage should contact the Benefits
Office in Personnel at the Old Pavilion (ext.
7-1777) or SLAC (ext. 28-2357 or 2358) no
later than May 1 5.
Q. What about long-term disability insur
ance?
A. Individuals who chose to go on strike or
observe a picket line will not receive this cover
age, since it normally is paid by the University.
Q. What about sick leave during a strike?
A. In the event of a strike, University man
agers and supervisors will require sufficient evi
dence of medical disability when approving the
use of sick leave by University employees.
Guide memo 22.6 of the University's ad
ministrative guide specifies that a supervisor
should ascertain the reason for absence and is
authorized to require medical evidence or other
evidence of disability before approving the use
of sick leave.
II no such acceptable evidence is provided
by the employee, the period of absence will be
treated as an unauthorized leave without salary.
Q. What about vacations during a strike?
A. If your vacation scheduled was ap
proved before May 1 and you are not a super
visor, you may proceed as planned without pen
alty.
Vacation schedules approved after May 1
will be automatically cancelled as of the first
day of any strike called by USE. All employees,
including supervisors and managers, on vacations
approved after May 1 will be considered to be
on unauthorized leave without salary as of the
first day of a strike.
If you have other questions concerning a
possible strike, discuss them first with your
supervisor. If further clarification is still needed,
your supervisor can then call the office which
seems most appropriate or the Operations Cen
ter, ext. 7-1024, for more information.
In a period of uncertainty, try to act only
on accurate information. Remember that the
outcome of the negotiations will be a contract
by which all members of the University—super
visors and members of the bargaining unit—will
be bound.
Whether or not a strike occurs, it is impor
tant to keep in mind that the issues which cur
rently divide the union and the University will
be resolved. All of us then will continue working
together.

interfere with an employee's access to work. We
believe that the USE leadership and striking em
ployees would want to conduct themselves in a
peaceful and lawful manner during any strike.
Q. If ! am prevented from getting to work
by pickets, will the University assist me in reach
ing my place of employment?
A. Yes. If you want to work during a
strike, the University will help ensure that you
are able to get to your job.
If you have any trouble in getting to your
place of employment because of pickets, please
telephone the University Operations Center at
497-1024.
Q. What if I am prevented from doing my
work?
A. If there is a disruption, call the campus
police at ext. 7-3444. Tell them what has hap
/

pened, and ask their advice. Try to record what
you saw or heard as quickly and completely as
possible.
Q. As a USE member, would I be subject
to penalty if I crossed a picket line?
A. Every employee has a right to work and
to cross picket lines even if a union member.
However, USE members, because of their mem
bership status, may be fined for crossing a picket
line or refusing to honor a strike which the
union has called. Union members may lawfully
avoid such fines oniy by resigning their member
ship in the union before grossing a picket line or
working during a strike.
Q. What if I am not a USE member?
A. If an employee is not a USE member,
then he or she cannot be fined by the union for
working during a strike.
Q. When USE and the University sign a
contract, can I be forced to join the union?
A. No. The union shop question is current
ly being negotiated. The University has proposed
a modified union shop, so that those now in the
bargaining unit who are not USE members when
a contract is signed could not be forced to join
the union.
USE has proposed an agency shop, which
does not require union membership. The most
an employee in the bargaining unit could legally
be required to do is pay amounts equivalent to
periodic dues and initiation fees. Employees can
not be forced to perform any other membership
requirements.
Q. Do employees have a legal right to
strike?
A. Yes. But under federal law only non
supervisory personnel have rights to strike if
they choose. Supervisory personnel may be re
quired to work during a strike.
Moreover, those employees who currently
are working under collective bargaining agree
ments must honor commitments not to strike.
Q. Can an employee lose his or her job if
he or she goes on strike?
A. A nonsupervisory employee has a right
to reinstatement after a lawful strike unless he
or she has been permanently replaced or engages
in misconduct during the strike. An employer
may hire replacements in order to continue op
erations during a strike. Employees who are per
manently replaced lose any right to reinstate
ment immediately upon conclusion of a strike,
but may apply for any available openings or wait
until their former job becomes open again.
Q. Will those employees who do not work
during a strike be paid their regular Stanford
wages and benefits?
A. No. An employer is not required to pay
employees who are on strike. Therefore, em
ployees who strike or respect i\ picket line will
receive no wages for the time during which they
do not work, and additionally, will not receive

for that period various University benefits such
as vacation accrual and University contributions
to a striking employees' pension or health insur
ance plans.
Q. If I chose to strike, could I continue my
basic health plan and major medical coverage at
my own expense?
A. Yes. When processing the May 22 pay
roll, the University will automatically deduct
, from any striking employee's paycheck the
amount normally deducted plus the University's
usual contribution toward these coverages.
Those striking employees who wish to can
cel this coverage should contact the Benefits
Office in Personnel at the Old Pavilion (ext.
7-1777) or SLAC (ext. 28-2357 or 2358) no
later than May 1 5.
Q. What about long-term disability insur
ance?
A. Individuals who chose to go on strike or
observe a picket line will not receive this cover
age, since it normally is paid by the University.
Q. What about sick leave during a strike?
A. In the event of a strike, University man
agers and supervisors will require sufficient evi
dence of medical disability when approving the
use of sick leave by University employees.
Guide memo 22.6 of the University's ad
ministrative guide specifies that a supervisor
should ascertain the reason for absence and is
authorized to require medical evidence or other
evidence of disability before approving the use
of sick leave.
II no such acceptable evidence is provided
by the employee, the period of absence will be
treated as an unauthorized leave without salary.
Q. What about vacations during a strike?
A. If your vacation scheduled was ap
proved before May 1 and you are not a super
visor, you may proceed as planned without pen
alty.
Vacation schedules approved after May 1
will be automatically cancelled as of the first
day of any strike called by USE. All employees,
including supervisors and managers, on vacations
approved after May 1 will be considered to be
on unauthorized leave without salary as of the
first day of a strike.
If you have other questions concerning a
possible strike, discuss them first with your
supervisor. If further clarification is still needed,
your supervisor can then call the office which
seems most appropriate or the Operations Cen
ter, ext. 7-1024, for more information.
In a period of uncertainty, try to act only
on accurate information. Remember that the
outcome of the negotiations will be a contract
by which all members of the University—super
visors and members of the bargaining unit—will
be bound.
Whether or not a strike occurs, it is impor
tant to keep in mind that the issues which cur
rently divide the union and the University will
be resolved. All of us then will continue working
together.

you saw or heard as quickly and completely as
possible.
Q. As a USE member, would I be subject
to penalty if I crossed a picket line?
A. Every employee has a right to work and
to cross picket lines even if a union member.
However, USE members, because of their mem
bership status, may be fined for crossing a picket
line or refusing to honor a strike which the
union has called. Union members may lawfully
avoid such fines oniy by resigning their member
ship in the union before grossing a picket line or
working during a strike.
Q. What if I am not a USE member?
A. If an employee is not a USE member,
then he or she cannot be fined by the union for
working during a strike.
Q. When USE and the University sign a
contract, can I be forced to join the union?
A. No. The union shop question is current
ly being negotiated. The University has proposed
a modified union shop, so that those now in the
bargaining unit who are not USE members when
a contract is signed could not be forced to join
the union.
USE has proposed an agency shop, which
does not require union membership. The most
an employee in the bargaining unit could legally
be required to do is pay amounts equivalent to
periodic dues and initiation fees. Employees can
not be forced to perform any other membership
requirements.
Q. Do employees have a legal right to
strike?
A. Yes. But under federal law only non
supervisory personnel have rights to strike if
they choose. Supervisory personnel may be re
quired to work during a strike.
Moreover, those employees who currently
are working under collective bargaining agree
ments must honor commitments not to strike.
Q. Can an employee lose his or her job if
he or she goes on strike?
A. A nonsupervisory employee has a right
to reinstatement after a lawful strike unless he
or she has been permanently replaced or engages
in misconduct during the strike. An employer
may hire replacements in order to continue op
erations during a strike. Employees who are per
manently replaced lose any right to reinstate
ment immediately upon conclusion of a strike,
but may apply for any available openings or wait
until their former job becomes open again.
Q. Will those employees who do not work
during a strike be paid their regular Stanford
wages and benefits?
A. No. An employer is not required to pay
employees who are on strike. Therefore, em
ployees who strike or respect i\ picket line will
receive no wages for the time during which they
do not work, and additionally, will not receive

for that period various University benefits such
as vacation accrual and University contributions
to a striking employees' pension or health insur
ance plans.
Q. If I chose to strike, could I continue my
basic health plan and major medical coverage at
my own expense?
A. Yes. When processing the May 22 pay
roll, the University will automatically deduct
, from any striking employee's paycheck the
amount normally deducted plus the University's
usual contribution toward these coverages.
Those striking employees who wish to can
cel this coverage should contact the Benefits
Office in Personnel at the Old Pavilion (ext.
7-1777) or SLAC (ext. 28-2357 or 2358) no
later than May 1 5.
Q. What about long-term disability insur
ance?
A. Individuals who chose to go on strike or
observe a picket line will not receive this cover
age, since it normally is paid by the University.
Q. What about sick leave during a strike?
A. In the event of a strike, University man
agers and supervisors will require sufficient evi
dence of medical disability when approving the
use of sick leave by University employees.
Guide memo 22.6 of the University's ad
ministrative guide specifies that a supervisor
should ascertain the reason for absence and is
authorized to require medical evidence or other
evidence of disability before approving the use
of sick leave.
II no such acceptable evidence is provided
by the employee, the period of absence will be
treated as an unauthorized leave without salary.
Q. What about vacations during a strike?
A. If your vacation scheduled was ap
proved before May 1 and you are not a super
visor, you may proceed as planned without pen
alty.
Vacation schedules approved after May 1
will be automatically cancelled as of the first
day of any strike called by USE. All employees,
including supervisors and managers, on vacations
approved after May 1 will be considered to be
on unauthorized leave without salary as of the
first day of a strike.
If you have other questions concerning a
possible strike, discuss them first with your
supervisor. If further clarification is still needed,
your supervisor can then call the office which
seems most appropriate or the Operations Cen
ter, ext. 7-1024, for more information.
In a period of uncertainty, try to act only
on accurate information. Remember that the
outcome of the negotiations will be a contract
by which all members of the University—super
visors and members of the bargaining unit—will
be bound.
Whether or not a strike occurs, it is impor
tant to keep in mind that the issues which cur
rently divide the union and the University will
be resolved. All of us then will continue working
together.

*Questions and answers for employees from the University

Ever since United Stanford Employees pre
sented its initial contract proposals in mid-
November, the University has made a sustained
effort to reach a mutually acceptable contract
through the collective bargaining process.
That effort has continued this week, and
will go on as long as union representatives con
tinue to meet over the bargaining table with the
University.
Since the union advanced its deadline for
negotiations and set a tentative strike date of
Sunday night, May 12, a number of questions
have arisen concerning the status of employees
and others in the event of a strike.
The following series of questions and an
swers has been prepared by several University
offices in an effort to answer some of the most
frequently asked questions concerning employ
ees and to correct some of the misapprehensions
based on rumors of what might happen in the
event of a strike.
Q. If USE were to call a strike would Stan
ford University remain open and continue opera
tions?
A. Yes. Stanford University has a responsi
bility and a commitment to all members of the
community to stay open and to continue to
function as normally as possible.
Q. Would I have a right to work in my
University job during a strike?
A. Yes. Every employee of Stanford Uni
versity whether or not in the bargaining unit and
whether or not a member of USE has a legal
right to work during a strike, and may not
lawfully be prevented from working by those
who do wish to strike.
Q. Are striking employees or union repre
sentatives permitted to prevent me from going
to work?
A. No. Every employee has a right to work
and have free access to his or her place of
employment. Picketing is required by law to be
peaceful and may not be conducted so as to
interfere with an employee's access to work. We
believe that the USE leadership and striking em
ployees would want to conduct themselves in a
peaceful and lawful manner during any strike.
Q. If ! am prevented from getting to work
by pickets, will the University assist me in reach
ing my place of employment?
A. Yes. If you want to work during a
strike, the University will help ensure that you
are able to get to your job.
If you have any trouble in getting to your
place of employment because of pickets, please
telephone the University Operations Center at
497-1024.
Q. What if I am prevented from doing my
work?
A. If there is a disruption, call the campus
police at ext. 7-3444. Tell them what has hap
/

pened, and ask their advice. Try to record what
you saw or heard as quickly and completely as
possible.
