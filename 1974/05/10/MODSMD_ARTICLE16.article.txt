# Secretary Of State Candidate Calls For Consumer Protection
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The office of California
secretary of state should be
strengthened to allow its
incumbent to better protect
consumers, Herman Sillas,
candidate for that office in the
Democratic primary told the
Daily Tuesday.
Campaigning on the Stanford
campus, Sillas noted that it is the
duty of the secretary of state to
charter a corporation but he has
no way to insure that the
corporation fulfills its obligations
in an ethical manner.
If elected, Sillas said he would
try to take some of the duties of
monitoring corporations away
from the office of the attorney
general and place them with the
secretary of state where that
office could spend more time
insuring that frauds were not
perpetrated on consumers.
L.A. Attorney
A Los Angeles attorney, Sillas,
40, has a B.A. in political science
and a law degree from UCLA. He
has worked as a member of the
Democratic National Reform
Committee and serves as chairman
of the California Advisory Board
to the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission.
He will face three other

opponents in the June primary,
i They are Assemblyman Walter
Karabian, Assemblywoman March
K. Fong, and educator Cathy
O'Neill.
Sillas commended current
Secretary of State Jerry Brown,
whom he credited with "restoring
visibility" to the office of
I attorney general. "I would carry
■ on the same tradition of making
> the office viable," Sillas said.
i Brown, a candidate for
■ governor, is not seeking another
i term as secretary of state.

Noting that many people are
unaware of the duties of a
secretary of state, Sillas said that
one of the main thrusts of his
campaign is educating people
about the office's function.
Duties
Sillas explained that a secretary
of state must enforce the election
code, and maintain the state
archives.
He emphasized that as
secretary of state, one of his main
interests would be to draw
minority groups into the political
process.
"We live in a multi-cultural
society," Sillas said. "Our
challenge is to make use of the
vast human resources that exist
among the minority groups."
Claiming that he has the "full
support" of most minority
communities, Sillas stated that he
is not directing his campaign only
to minorities.
An advocate of public
financing of election campaigns,
Sillas stated that he wants to open
the political process "to as many
people as possible." Most plans
for financing are concerned with
general elections, but the minor
candidates who need financial
help usually run only in the
primaries, he said.
