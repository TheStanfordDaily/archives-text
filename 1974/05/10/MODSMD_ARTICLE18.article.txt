# Santee To Resign From School Post
## 
### 
Harold Santee, superintendent
of the Palo Alto Unified School
District (PAUSD) announced his
resignation at a Board of
Education meeting Tuesday night.
After serving the district for 12
years, Santee, 60, will be released
from his contract in June, 1975,
instead of as expected in June of
1976. He will actually leave office
in March to enjoy his accumulated
vacation time.
Board of Education President
Donald Hammon praised Santee
for guiding the district through
years of tense race relations and
pressures of drugs in the schools.
He said Santee led the district
from its stage as a "gangling
youth" through maturation.
With plans for reorganization
underway in the district and a
general three-to-five-year plan in
the making, Santee said "I think it
is a good time for me [to resign]
and for the school district, which
is entering a transition period" to
appoint somebody new.
"It's not possible for me to
carry the district," throughout the
entirity of the plan, he said, "so
the board should find somebody
who can."
Santee predicted the board will
appoint the next superintendent
by January and added that the

new appointee "should have
something to do with how the
|proposed district] reorganization
comes off."
S a nt ee served as
superintendent of the Inglewood
Unified School District before
coming to Palo Alto. He received
his Ph.D. from Stanford in 1959.
