Higher education students
of Stanford's School of
Education will be conducting
a one day conference relating
to new student's in today's
post secondary institutions
tomorrow from 9 a.m. at the
Stanford Center for Research
and Development in teaching.
The conference will
provide an opportunity for
educators in all sectors to
discuss specific problems and
the techniques for coping
with these problems which
have been developed in the
Northern California area.
Conference sessions will

programs, and techniques
that have actually worked,
instead of philosophy and
common rhetoric.
