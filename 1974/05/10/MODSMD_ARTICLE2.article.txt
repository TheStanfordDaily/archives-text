# Famine Carnival Opens
## 
### 
A three-day carnival to raise money
for the African Famine Relief Fund
begins today on the field between
Wilbur and Stern Halls.
The carnival, originally conceived
by Crothers Memorial Senior House
Associate Bob Naon, will continue
through Sunday and will offer a
variety of games, rides and other
carnival fare.
The carnival is being produced by
* bley and Burk shows, a carnival
company based in Redwood City,

which is the second largest operation
of its kind west of the Mississippi
River.
Various campus dormitories and
houses will set up booths at the
carnival featuring such activities as
tie-dyeing and massages.
The Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band will provide
entertainment in the evenings.

carnival's operating hours and for a
