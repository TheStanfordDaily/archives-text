# 'Austrian Student's Life' Vienna Program Organized
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Students at the new Stanford
in Austria program will "live the
life of an Austrian student"
according to Siegfried Korninger,
rector of the University of Vienna
and director of studies for the
new Austrian center.
Korninger, who has directed
the Stanford program in Vienna
since its inception in 1966, is on
campus this week to discuss plans
for the revised program, which
will open in September.
While the former program
involved Stanford faculty as well
as local instructors, and operated
as a self-contained unit, students
enrolled in the new version will
attend classes at the University of
Vienna, live in student dorms and
have relative freedom in choice of
an academic program. The former
facility was vacated last August as
part of a general overhaul of the
German-language overseas
campuses programs.
Program's Aims
The aims of the new program,
according to Korninger, include a
more complete involvement in the
local academic life and more
flexibility in academic
programming. The program will
be smaller than before, with
approximately 30 students
expected.
The new program will run on
an academic-year basis rather than
the old two-quarter schedule,
Korninger said. Beginning in
September, several levels of
instruction in German will
precede the beginning of the
University of Vienna's fall
semester in October.
According to plans, the
program will accommodate

students with any (or no)
background in German. An
intensive program will be offered
for students without previous
experience, with 20 hours of
instruction per week for four
weeks. Language instruction will
continue for most students
throughout their stay.
Location Sought
While there will be no central
housing or eating facilities for the
Stanford students, a location is
being sought for a center for
academic needs, where tutors
appointed from the University
will conduct tutorials and
otherwise help overcome students'
difficulties arising from language
problems. The planned center
would include classroom and
office space as well as a limited
library.
Examinations for the normal
university courses, which are not
taken individually by the Austrian
students, will be arranged by the
tutors "inclose cooperation" with
the faculty there.
Some courses will be designed
especially for the Stanford
student group. Korninger
described an introductory course
in Austrian civilization which will
concentrate on "evidence of
civilization" in Vienna and the
surrounding area.
First-Hand Experience
Another series of courses will
concentrate on the fine arts, but
will not take a "firm academic
approach," said Korninger. He
emphasized first-hand experience
music classes centering around
the concert halls, art courses
around the museums and drama
courses around the theaters.
Korninger said Veinna is an

ideal location for an education in
the arts. He called the modern
city "a paradigm of cultivated
civilization."
Students will have the option
of transfering among the
German-language programs in
Vienna, Beutelsbach, Berlin and
Bonn. However, Associate
Director Hedi Thimig pointed out
that a transfer from Beutelsbach
to Vienna in winter quarter would
be unwise because the first
semester would end two or three
weeks into the quarter and the
second would not begin until
March.
