# School Chief Candidate: Separate School, State
## 
### ED MATHENY 
Hal Jindrich, candidate for
State Superintendent of Public-
Instruction, argued Wednesday for
"the complete separation of
legislation and learning."
Jindrich, 44, is one of six
candidates challenging incumbent
Wilson Riles in the June 4
primary.
Speaking before a small crowd
at Tresidder, Jindrich said, "I
oppose all compulsory attendance
and financing of education, and I
support the complete separation
of schools and the state."
"In order to accomplish this,"
he continued, "I propose a series
of eliminations of all taxation and
laws regarding education,
corresponding tuition or fee
increases, and the eventual sale of
every state and public school,
college or university."
Jindrich opposed governmental
control in education. "I believe
that every person has the
inalienable right to be free from
compulsory control or legislation
in any area whatsoever, including
education. No one has the right to
force you, or me, or any other
group to be exposed to
educational plans and programs
that we don't want, or even like."
With private funding, he
argued, people can support the
programs they prefer. "Parents
can decide which particular
courses or methods they want
their children to be exposed to,
and they'd be free to support or
teach these programs
accordingly," he said.
This "freedom for learning,"
he added, would result in a wide
variety of teaching innovations. "I
believe that there will be a great
surge of creativity and growth in
all types of learning and teaching
programs," he said.
Such innovations, he claimed,

would increase the efficiency of
schooling, and decrease its cost.
Furthermore, he said, taking
education out of the hands of the
government would discourage
unwanted social and political
indoctrination. "Without the
heavy hand of government and
state control, learning would then
be free to become the happy,
rewarding experience it should
be," he stated.
Learning, he said, is a strong
motivating force only if the child
has not been taught to dislike
school and study. Yet, in most
schools today, he claimed, this
"de-motivation" has been the
rule.
"I think we're in a real
educational crisis," he said. "On
the average, the common public
school is doing more harm than
good. Let's take San Francisco:
they're spending more and more
money there every eyar, yet the
tests that they have of the
children are decreasing."
Jindrich's speech was
sponsored by the Stanford
Libertarians. He is endorsed by
the Libertarian Party, but is not
running as a partisan candidate
because the post is not a partisan
office.
Jindrich had planned on
running for governor under the
Libertarian banner, but when he
failed to win the nomination on
the first ballot, the libertarians
chose John Hospers, their 1972
presidential candidate.
The Libertarian party has
candidates for all statewide
offices, but Jindrich will be the
only one on the ballot, because
the party itself has not yet
qualified as an official political
party in California.
