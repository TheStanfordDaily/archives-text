# Stanford's Spring Festival Activities
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
Strawberry shortcake, belly dancers, hot air balloons,
mimes, jugglers, jewelers, painters, pottery makers ... the
third annual Stanford Spring Festival will present all of these
and more this weekend, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
The festival is the major fund-raising event for The Bridge,
a campus community center which offers classes and
programs centering on human growth and interaction and
peer counseling.
The festival is being coordinated by Bridge staffers Jeff
Doty and Chan Wheeler with the help of about 16 other
volunteers, although more than 50 people will be helping
over the weekend to set up and take down the festival
booths.
This year's festival has been enlarged to include
approximately 130 artisans of all types,"ls food concessions,
and will run for three days instead of two.
According to Doty, nearly 300 artists were screened
before those to exhibit at the festival were selected. Artists
were selected in such a way that a balance of price ranges and
artistic forms will be on display.
Unlike the two previous festivals, cashiers will not be used
for art sales and the artisans will be trusted to donate 20
percent of their sales to The Bridge. Doty does not anticipate
much trouble with the new arrangement, saying that the
artists "understand that it's a symbiotic relationship."
Free entertainment will be nearly continuous from 10
a.m. to 6 p.m., and will include belly dancers, sitarists,
bagpipers, hot air balloonists, puppeteers, and various other
musicians and performers. According to Doty, the toelly
dancers last year were the entertainment hit of the festival,
and the Bridge has therefore scheduled eight performances of
this Middle Eastern art form throughout the weekend.
The Bridge has coordinated its plans to hold a dance with
those of the African Famine Relief Carnival being held
between Stern and Wilbur halls, so that the two organizations
will co-sponsor two dances, one Friday night, one Saturday
night.
Madness will play Friday at 8:30 p.m., and The Chasers
will play Saturday at 8:30 p.m., with Marauding appearances
by The Incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band thrown in for good measure. The dances will
be held between Stern and Wilbur.
Last year's festival attracted crowds which were estimated
at anywhere from 10,000 to 30,000 people to White Plaza
and grossed $26,000, a quarter of which funded Bridge
programs during the past year. Although the Bridge will keep
a lower percentage of the money brought in this year, an
increased number of artists should keep the Bridge funds at a
level equal with last year.
