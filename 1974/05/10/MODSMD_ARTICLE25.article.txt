Halls conjure up the image of

having the architectural charisma
J a federal penitentiary.
Well, friends, hold on to your
hamburgers; for this weekend the
intersection of these three
otherwise drab dormitories will
come to life at the stupendous,
colossal, and most of all,
admission-free Stanford Carnival.
The Carnival, which is being
held to raise money for the
African Famine Relief Fund, is
being produced by Foley and
Burk Shows, a Redwood
City-based carnival company, the
largest of its kind west of the
Mississippi. Among the ten
40-cent "thrill" rides featured
include a ferris wheel, bumper
cars, the "Zipper," and the
"Hurricane." There will also be
kiddie rides.
Animal Acts
Along with rides, animal acts
donated by Marine World/Africa
USA will be staged. Raffles the
Chimp, who starred in "The
Barefoot Executive", will
entertain Friday night, and tiger
cubs will be on stage Saturday
night. In addition the Marimba
City Circus from Berkeley, whose
troupe includes "The Flaming
Zuccinni" (a flame swallower),
and"The Human Animal" (talents
unknown), will entertain Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday.
The midway will be filled with
game booths sponsored by living
groups from all over campus.
Crothers Memorial, the graduate
student dorm, is sponsoring a
dunking booth. Story House plans
a cake walk and Lathrop, not to
be outdone, will run a massage
parlor. Larkin will tie-dye shirts,
Twain will sell balloons, and ZAP
House will give away a stuffed
animal to every person who gets a
dime to land on a saucer.
At night the Stanford

Marching Band will entertain
carnival goers.
Crother's Sponsoring
The originator of the carnival is
Crothers' Senior House Associate
Bob Naon, a third-year law school
student, who also served as editor
of the Stanford Journal of
International Studies and on the
editorial board of the Stanford
Law Review.
Naon, who had already earned
something of a Jake Gatsby
reputation for staging Crothers'
Casino Night and Mexican Night,
which attracted nearly 1000
campus partygoers earlier this
year, hopes the carnival will
encourage the participating living
groups to participate in more
public service activities. "It's
important for dorms to do things
among themselves which relate to
beyond the campus," he says.
Crothers will sponsor two
dance bands during the carnival,
"Madness" on Friday night, "The
Chasers", Saturday night.
Naon, and Ed Connors, the
other Crothers' R.A. and
co-impresario of the Carnival,
hope that the rides and booths
will attract patrons of the Spring
Festival, which will also be held
this weekend. The Relief Fund
will receive a cut of the gross from
rides and all profits from the
student-run cotton candy and
snow cone concessions and the
gaming booths. Foley and Burk
Shows have produced similar
charity events, such as the annual
Mardi Gras, which benefits a
summer camp set up by students
of UCLA.
The hours of the carnival are:
Friday, 4 p.m. to midnight;
Saturday, 9 a.m. to midnight; and
Sunday, 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. All
booths will be operating Friday
and Saturday and most of
Sunday. Houses or individuals
wishing to participate should call
Naon at 326-6278 or Connors at
321-5206.

which attracted nearly 1000
campus partygoers earlier this
year, hopes the carnival will
encourage the participating living
groups to participate in more
public service activities. "It's
important for dorms to do things
among themselves which relate to
beyond the campus," he says.
Crothers will sponsor two
dance bands during the carnival,
"Madness" on Friday night, "The
Chasers", Saturday night.
Naon, and Ed Connors, the
other Crothers' R.A. and
co-impresario of the Carnival,
hope that the rides and booths
will attract patrons of the Spring
Festival, which will also be held
this weekend. The Relief Fund
will receive a cut of the gross from
rides and all profits from the
student-run cotton candy and
snow cone concessions and the
gaming booths. Foley and Burk
Shows have produced similar
charity events, such as the annual
Mardi Gras, which benefits a
summer camp set up by students
of UCLA.
The hours of the carnival are:
Friday, 4 p.m. to midnight;
Saturday, 9 a.m. to midnight; and
Sunday, 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. All
booths will be operating Friday
and Saturday and most of
Sunday. Houses or individuals
wishing to participate should call
Naon at 326-6278 or Connors at
321-5206.

CUTE THING—This pretty little ... cub is going to be only one of
the many attractions at the Stanford Carnival this weekend. Other
animal lovers will be pleased to learn that Raffles, the famous chimp,
will also be on hand.
Wilbur, Stern, and Crothers
Halls conjure up the image of
sterile, uniform housing facilities
having the architectural charisma
J a federal penitentiary.
Well, friends, hold on to your
hamburgers; for this weekend the
intersection of these three
otherwise drab dormitories will
come to life at the stupendous,
colossal, and most of all,
admission-free Stanford Carnival.
The Carnival, which is being
held to raise money for the
African Famine Relief Fund, is
being produced by Foley and
Burk Shows, a Redwood
City-based carnival company, the
largest of its kind west of the
Mississippi. Among the ten
40-cent "thrill" rides featured
include a ferris wheel, bumper
cars, the "Zipper," and the
"Hurricane." There will also be
kiddie rides.
Animal Acts
Along with rides, animal acts
donated by Marine World/Africa
USA will be staged. Raffles the
Chimp, who starred in "The
Barefoot Executive", will
entertain Friday night, and tiger
cubs will be on stage Saturday
night. In addition the Marimba
City Circus from Berkeley, whose
troupe includes "The Flaming
Zuccinni" (a flame swallower),
and"The Human Animal" (talents
unknown), will entertain Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday.
The midway will be filled with
game booths sponsored by living
groups from all over campus.
Crothers Memorial, the graduate
student dorm, is sponsoring a
dunking booth. Story House plans
a cake walk and Lathrop, not to
be outdone, will run a massage
parlor. Larkin will tie-dye shirts,
Twain will sell balloons, and ZAP
House will give away a stuffed
animal to every person who gets a
dime to land on a saucer.
At night the Stanford

Marching Band will entertain
carnival goers.
Crother's Sponsoring
The originator of the carnival is
Crothers' Senior House Associate
Bob Naon, a third-year law school
student, who also served as editor
of the Stanford Journal of
International Studies and on the
editorial board of the Stanford
Law Review.
Naon, who had already earned
something of a Jake Gatsby
reputation for staging Crothers'
Casino Night and Mexican Night,
which attracted nearly 1000
campus partygoers earlier this
year, hopes the carnival will
encourage the participating living
groups to participate in more
public service activities. "It's
