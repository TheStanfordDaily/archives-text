# Tournee Gives Grown-Up Cartoons
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
If you've ever had the idea that
"cartoons" are only for children,
the Ninth International Tournee
of Animation being shown
tomorrow night in Memorial
Auditorium may prove you
wrong.
The Tournee is a collection of
16 animated films which quite
aside from occasional comedy
delve into such weighty problems
as overpopulation, greed, and
other excesses of a technological
society.
Best of all, there is pure
escapism in the form of "Cosmic
Cartoon" by Steven Lisberger and
Eric Ladd. Set to Holzt's The
Planets, this short film creates a
unique cosmos and lets the viewer
wander through it for awhile.
"Cosmic Cartoon" switches
from an Elysian Fields setting to a
2001-like landing and finally to a
psychedelic shore, all in a startling
combination of brilliant colors
and spacy music.
Colors are also a major element
of "Pucinella," an Italian film
which was nominated for the
Academy Award in animation.
Resembling a child's crayon
drawings brought to life,
"Pucinella" brings the irreverent
Italian clown to life escaping from
menacing police and an exploding
volcano.
Indeed, the Italians have the
monopoly on irreverence in this
year's Tournee, and their most
hilarious attack is on their own
most respected art form, opera.
Bruno Bozzetto and Guido Manuli
have created "Opera," a film
which takes numerous opera plots
and adds unlikely twist endings.

"Opera" is incredibly amusing,
but describing it is impossible and
in any case would destroy the
comic effect.
"The Legend of John Henry"
was also nominated for an
Academy Award. The vocal track
is sung by Roberta Flack, and the
combination of music and
animation is excellent;
unfortunately, this film is a bit

too long to maintain interest even
though it proceeds at a rapid pace.
One of the more serious films
is "Homo Augens," a Yugoslavian
film which presents a horrible
image of the future of man in an
over-populated environment. This
bizarre film is perhaps not as
technically brilliant as some of the
others, but its idea is so disturbing
and so dramatically carried out

that the film is quite effective.
The National Film Board of
Canada is represented by "The
Family That Dwelt Apart," an
excellent animation of E.B.
White's short story about a family
living on an island off the east
coast of Canada which is rescued
to death. The author narrates the
abstract, Dr. Seuss-type
interpretation by Yvon Mallette.
