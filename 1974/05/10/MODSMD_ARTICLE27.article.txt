# Marshall Tucker At Winterland
## Group Shows Off Talent 
### JAY HARLOW 
SAN FRANCISCOâ€”In the
wake of the phenomenal success
of the Allman Brothers Band,
several rock bands from the South
have become popular nationwide.
Friday Night at Winterland, the
Marshall Tucker Band, one of the
best, and Lynyrd Skynyrd, not
one of the best, brought the
sound of Southern rock and roll
to town.
Like the Allmans, the Marshall
Tucker Band relies on its musical
talents rather than acoustic or
visual gimmickry. With two
guitars, bass, drums, vocals and a
flute/sax man, they play
straightforward, clean-sounding
rock and roll.
Most of Friday night's tunes
were originals from their two
Capricorn albums, The Marshall
Tucker Band and A New Life. All

were uptempo numbers, mostly
featuring Toy Caldwell's tight,
clean lead guitar licks.
They opened with "Hillbilly
Band," with Caldwell doing "a
little chicken pickin'." Next was
"Another True Love's Passin' Me
By," sung by Dave Gray.
Caldwell belted out the vocals
on "Can't You See," which also
featured some of his best guitar
work. Several times, he would
sustain a high note just to the
point of feedback, then back off.
As Caldwell switched to pedal
steel guitar, Gray sang a couple of
country tunes, "Too Stubborn a
Man to Change My Mind" and
"See You Later, I'm Gone."
Caldwell is no Bobby Black, but
his pedal steel licks were not at all
bad.
"24 Hours Into Town"
featured solos by Caldwell, his

brother Tom on bass and Jem
Eubanks on sax. Not slacking off
the pace a bit, they continued
with "Ramblin'," which had the
crowd on the floor bouncing even
more than before.
The set-closer was "Take the
Highway," with Caldwell's guitar
and Eubanks' flute blending
perfectly before both took solos.
This is one of the band's best
tunes, and the lyrics are a
variation on an old theme, about
packing bags and walking away.
As an encore, they played 8.8.
King's "Every Day I Sing the
Blues," featuring Caldwell's
guitar. With Caldwell's long
free-form guitar introduction and
interlude, the band managed to
satisfy even the Winterland
regulars with a single encore.
Unfortunately, along with the
likes of the Allman Brothers and
the Marshall Tucker Band, the
South has produced such acts as
Black Oak Arkansas and Lynyrd
Skynyrd. The latter preceded the
Tucker band Friday night.
This band is not without
talent, but rarely plays with
anything less than maximum
volume and maximum distortion.
With a vocalist, bass, keyboards,
drums and three (count 'em)
guitars, together they made
enough noise to keep the wolves
awake.
In addition to the music, there
was a lot of jumping around and
slightly obscene guitar playing on
stage which was for better or for
worse distracting.
The curious thing about
Lynyrd Skynyrd's set was one
song that really worked, which
they dedicated to Duane Allman.
In contrast to the other numbers,
this one started out relatively
quietly, with a beautiful melody
on slide guitar. The band
somehow had changed, and really
seemed to respect the music they
were playing. The song built up to
the same volume level as the
earlier tunes, but by contrast with
the opening, the increased
intensity was more effective and
emotionally satisfying.
For their encore, however,
they were back to their old tricks.
They played an old blues standby,
"Crossroads," but managed to
muddy it up with three loud,
distorted guitars.
A new local band, Bodacious,
opened the show. Led by former
Jefferson Airplane singer Marty
Balin, Bodacious is a competent
band without a distinctive style.
Just about every recent rock style
except country seems to have had
some influence on their sound.
Aside from Balin's instantly
recognizable voice, it would be
hard to identify this band in a
blind listening test.
