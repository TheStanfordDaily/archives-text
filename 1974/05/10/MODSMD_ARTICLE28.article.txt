# Once Around The Turntable

### 
Sutherland Brothers and Quiver
Dream Kid
Island (Capitol) SW-9341
Despite a top ten single here
(which I confess, I missed), the
British rock 'n' roll group
Sutherland Brothers and Quiver
have yet to show that they belong
among the top groups in rock
music.
Their second album together,
Dream Kid, simply lacks the
energy to make it a memorable
album.
Though the songs themselves
are tuneful and interesting
lyrically, the band is unable to
deliver the solid sound that
characterized their concert, sound
during a tour with Elton John this
summer. In fact, it seems as if the
group has gone to great lengths
to abandon its hard guitar sound,
but they've clearly gone
overboard.

The band is composed of three
guitarists — lead guitarist Tim
Renwick, Gavin Sutherland and
lain Sutherland — yet only on one
song does the band sound like it
has anywhere near three guitars.
Instead, Sutherland Brothers
and Quiver rely heavily on barely
above average keyboard work
(mostly piano) by Peter Wood,
the non descript bass of Bruce
Thomas and the adequate
drumming of Willie Wilson.
Nor are the Sutherland
brothers themselves bluesy, gutty
enough vocalists to carry an
album characterized by only fair
back-up instrumentation.
So it is understandable that the
album's sound is basically, in the
words of a famous kibitzer,
"Weak, weak, weak."
The songs comprise a variety of
rhythms and are suitable to many
tastes in rock music. Particularly
noteworthy are the accented

second beats in "You and Me,"
the straight boogie in "I Hear
Thunder" and the Kinks-ish rock
of "Saved by the Angel."
Yet all three songs wind down
without even a good, short top-40
type solo — lead guitar, piano,
drums, bass, anything — leaving a
nothing impression.
That's the problem with the
entire album. None of the music
jumps out to grab its listener,
including the title track, rumored
to be the group's next single.
"I reckon when we got back
after the 10 weeks in the States
we were like a million times better
band than when we left, although
when we left we thought we were
great," says Gavin Sutherland.
Well Gavin, it's time for a
reevaluation of your sound; it's
not as together as you think.

The Main Ingredient
Euphrates River
RCA APL 1-0335
The Main Ingredient, riding a
crest of continuing popularity
after "Greatest Hits," has released
a new album. Produced by
Silvester, Simmons, Gooding at
RCA in New York Euphrates
River has been rapidly making
itself known amongst rhythm and
blues devotees.
The Main Ingredient, with
slightly different personnel, has
continued the Ingredient tradition
of mellow, danceable melodies,
and fine, sometimes ethereal
harmonies.
Side A of the album features
two works by Seals and Crofts.
The first, the title cut
"Euphrates" is a musical journey
through the lands leading to he
Tigris. The piece, beautifully
arranged with strings and partial
orchestral accompaniment,
emerges as one of the album's
showpieces.
The album has many.
"Summer Breeze" is done
especially well. The vocal is
excellent (in my opinion better
than Seals and Crofts), as is the
softly flowing music with
euphonic bell percussions. Side A
becomes complete with a
rhythmic "California My Way"
and an excellent background
harmonic "Have You Ever Tried
It."
Side B continues successfully,
including two current radio hits,
"Happiness is Just Around the
Bend" and "Just Don't Want To
Be Lonely." Both tunes feature
exceptional vocals and very
danceable rhythms.
The Main Ingredient on this
side also features a cut written by
a man named Wonder. Their
version of "Don't You Worry
'Bout A Thing" is very similar to
Stevies, yet still quite pretty due
to the harmonics of the vocalists.
Mv favorite on this side.

however, is "Looks Like Rain."
"Rain" is a delicate number with
some of the best harmony to be
found anywhere. The melody is
compassionate and catchy. Listen
to it. I guarantee you'll find
yourself humming it!
Euphrates River will be a
welcome addition to any R&B
collection. The album features
some very mellow soulful music
with very creative arrangements,
thanks to Bert De Coteaux, who
arranged and conducted the
effort. The cover work is quite
exquisite, featuring very colorful
artistic work by Walter Rogers.
The total effort has, in my
opinion, been successful.
Successful, if only for the
beautiful harmonies (though I
think the album wins on more
points than that), however, it is
in the essence of harmony that
we find the main ingredient.

Spinners
Mighty Love
Atlantic SD 726
Atlantic, reknowned for
recognizing talent — Donny
Hathaway, Led Zepplin, Yes, Ray
Charles, Roberta Flack, Aretha
Franklin — to mention a few, has
released a new album by the
Spinners. Mighty Love, the groups
latest effort since Spinners proves
slightly disappointing in
comparison to the latter. Side one
is composed of many throw-aways
worthy of no further comment.
The album does, however,
contain many excellent cuts
which are to be found on side
two.
"He'll Never Love You Like I
Do" is a mellow, moderately
paced jam featuring a unique
trumpet parody melody, and
some quality background vocals.
"Love Has Gone Away" features a
funky Temptations reminiscent

beginning that leads into a lighter,
more mellow type of trip.
"Love Don't Love Nobody,"
my favorite, is such because of it's
sensitivity in relaying the
emotions of one who once
deemed himself a fool for being
unable to relate his feelings of
love. Some people will know what
I'm talking about. "Mighty Love,"
the albums Top-of-the-charts title
cut appropriately closes the
album.
Produced by Thom Bell at
Sigma Sound in Philadelphia,
Mighty Ix)ve could have been a
major stepping stone in the
careers of the Spinners.
The musical unit is beyond
reproach, as are the back-up
vocals led by Barbara Ingram,
Carla Benton, and Yvette Benson.
The arrangements are innovative
and creative. With all this going
for the Spinners it is unfortunate
that the material is not always on
par with the rest of the effort.

through the lands leading to he
Tigris. The piece, beautifully
arranged with strings and partial
orchestral accompaniment,
emerges as one of the album's
showpieces.
The album has many.
"Summer Breeze" is done
especially well. The vocal is
excellent (in my opinion better
than Seals and Crofts), as is the
softly flowing music with
euphonic bell percussions. Side A
becomes complete with a
rhythmic "California My Way"
and an excellent background
harmonic "Have You Ever Tried
It."
Side B continues successfully,
including two current radio hits,
"Happiness is Just Around the
Bend" and "Just Don't Want To
Be Lonely." Both tunes feature
exceptional vocals and very
danceable rhythms.
The Main Ingredient on this
side also features a cut written by
a man named Wonder. Their
version of "Don't You Worry
'Bout A Thing" is very similar to
Stevies, yet still quite pretty due
to the harmonics of the vocalists.
Mv favorite on this side.

however, is "Looks Like Rain."
"Rain" is a delicate number with
some of the best harmony to be
found anywhere. The melody is
compassionate and catchy. Listen
to it. I guarantee you'll find
yourself humming it!
Euphrates River will be a
welcome addition to any R&B
collection. The album features
some very mellow soulful music
with very creative arrangements,
thanks to Bert De Coteaux, who
arranged and conducted the
effort. The cover work is quite
exquisite, featuring very colorful
artistic work by Walter Rogers.
The total effort has, in my
opinion, been successful.
Successful, if only for the
beautiful harmonies (though I
think the album wins on more
points than that), however, it is
in the essence of harmony that
we find the main ingredient.

Spinners
Mighty Love
Atlantic SD 726
Atlantic, reknowned for
recognizing talent — Donny
Hathaway, Led Zepplin, Yes, Ray
Charles, Roberta Flack, Aretha
Franklin — to mention a few, has
released a new album by the
Spinners. Mighty Love, the groups
latest effort since Spinners proves
slightly disappointing in
comparison to the latter. Side one
is composed of many throw-aways
worthy of no further comment.
The album does, however,
contain many excellent cuts
which are to be found on side
two.
"He'll Never Love You Like I
Do" is a mellow, moderately
paced jam featuring a unique
trumpet parody melody, and
some quality background vocals.
"Love Has Gone Away" features a
funky Temptations reminiscent

beginning that leads into a lighter,
more mellow type of trip.
"Love Don't Love Nobody,"
my favorite, is such because of it's
sensitivity in relaying the
emotions of one who once
deemed himself a fool for being
unable to relate his feelings of
love. Some people will know what
I'm talking about. "Mighty Love,"
the albums Top-of-the-charts title
cut appropriately closes the
album.
Produced by Thom Bell at
Sigma Sound in Philadelphia,
Mighty Ix)ve could have been a
major stepping stone in the
careers of the Spinners.
The musical unit is beyond
reproach, as are the back-up
vocals led by Barbara Ingram,
Carla Benton, and Yvette Benson.
The arrangements are innovative
and creative. With all this going
for the Spinners it is unfortunate
that the material is not always on
par with the rest of the effort.

DKSTINED TO BE ETERNAL BACKUPS?—The Sutherland Bros, and Quiver, who backed up Elton
John's highly successful U.S. tour last summer, seem to have failed to capitalize on their opportunities for
stardom. Their latest album, 'Dream Kid,' lacks the necessary energy that usually marks a hit album.

PUTTING IN A LITTLE SOUL—The Spinners just released their first album since their very successful
'Spinners' album of last year. 'Mighty Love,' their new release is sure to have at least a couple of songs ride
into fame on the air waves of radio stations.
Sutherland Brothers and Quiver
Dream Kid
Island (Capitol) SW-9341
Despite a top ten single here
(which I confess, I missed), the
British rock 'n' roll group
Sutherland Brothers and Quiver
have yet to show that they belong
among the top groups in rock
music.
Their second album together,
Dream Kid, simply lacks the
energy to make it a memorable
album.
Though the songs themselves
are tuneful and interesting
lyrically, the band is unable to
deliver the solid sound that
characterized their concert, sound
during a tour with Elton John this
summer. In fact, it seems as if the
group has gone to great lengths
to abandon its hard guitar sound,
but they've clearly gone
overboard.

The band is composed of three
guitarists — lead guitarist Tim
Renwick, Gavin Sutherland and
lain Sutherland — yet only on one
song does the band sound like it
has anywhere near three guitars.
Instead, Sutherland Brothers
and Quiver rely heavily on barely
above average keyboard work
(mostly piano) by Peter Wood,
the non descript bass of Bruce
Thomas and the adequate
drumming of Willie Wilson.
Nor are the Sutherland
brothers themselves bluesy, gutty
enough vocalists to carry an
album characterized by only fair
back-up instrumentation.
So it is understandable that the
album's sound is basically, in the
words of a famous kibitzer,
"Weak, weak, weak."
The songs comprise a variety of
rhythms and are suitable to many
tastes in rock music. Particularly
noteworthy are the accented

second beats in "You and Me,"
the straight boogie in "I Hear
Thunder" and the Kinks-ish rock
of "Saved by the Angel."
Yet all three songs wind down
without even a good, short top-40
type solo — lead guitar, piano,
drums, bass, anything — leaving a
nothing impression.
That's the problem with the
entire album. None of the music
jumps out to grab its listener,
including the title track, rumored
to be the group's next single.
"I reckon when we got back
after the 10 weeks in the States
we were like a million times better
band than when we left, although
when we left we thought we were
great," says Gavin Sutherland.
Well Gavin, it's time for a
reevaluation of your sound; it's
not as together as you think.

DKSTINED TO BE ETERNAL BACKUPS?—The Sutherland Bros, and Quiver, who backed up Elton
John's highly successful U.S. tour last summer, seem to have failed to capitalize on their opportunities for
stardom. Their latest album, 'Dream Kid,' lacks the necessary energy that usually marks a hit album.

PUTTING IN A LITTLE SOUL—The Spinners just released their first album since their very successful
'Spinners' album of last year. 'Mighty Love,' their new release is sure to have at least a couple of songs ride
into fame on the air waves of radio stations.
Sutherland Brothers and Quiver
Dream Kid
Island (Capitol) SW-9341
Despite a top ten single here
(which I confess, I missed), the
British rock 'n' roll group
Sutherland Brothers and Quiver
have yet to show that they belong
among the top groups in rock
music.
Their second album together,
Dream Kid, simply lacks the
energy to make it a memorable
album.
Though the songs themselves
are tuneful and interesting
lyrically, the band is unable to
deliver the solid sound that
characterized their concert, sound
during a tour with Elton John this
summer. In fact, it seems as if the
group has gone to great lengths
to abandon its hard guitar sound,
but they've clearly gone
overboard.

The band is composed of three
guitarists — lead guitarist Tim
Renwick, Gavin Sutherland and
lain Sutherland — yet only on one
song does the band sound like it
has anywhere near three guitars.
Instead, Sutherland Brothers
and Quiver rely heavily on barely
above average keyboard work
(mostly piano) by Peter Wood,
the non descript bass of Bruce
Thomas and the adequate
drumming of Willie Wilson.
Nor are the Sutherland
brothers themselves bluesy, gutty
enough vocalists to carry an
album characterized by only fair
back-up instrumentation.
So it is understandable that the
album's sound is basically, in the
words of a famous kibitzer,
"Weak, weak, weak."
The songs comprise a variety of
rhythms and are suitable to many
tastes in rock music. Particularly
noteworthy are the accented

second beats in "You and Me,"
the straight boogie in "I Hear
Thunder" and the Kinks-ish rock
of "Saved by the Angel."
Yet all three songs wind down
without even a good, short top-40
type solo — lead guitar, piano,
drums, bass, anything — leaving a
nothing impression.
That's the problem with the
entire album. None of the music
jumps out to grab its listener,
including the title track, rumored
to be the group's next single.
"I reckon when we got back
after the 10 weeks in the States
we were like a million times better
band than when we left, although
when we left we thought we were
great," says Gavin Sutherland.
Well Gavin, it's time for a
reevaluation of your sound; it's
not as together as you think.

The Main Ingredient
Euphrates River
RCA APL 1-0335
The Main Ingredient, riding a
crest of continuing popularity
after "Greatest Hits," has released
a new album. Produced by
Silvester, Simmons, Gooding at
RCA in New York Euphrates
River has been rapidly making
itself known amongst rhythm and
blues devotees.
The Main Ingredient, with
slightly different personnel, has
continued the Ingredient tradition
of mellow, danceable melodies,
and fine, sometimes ethereal
harmonies.
Side A of the album features
two works by Seals and Crofts.
The first, the title cut
"Euphrates" is a musical journey
through the lands leading to he
Tigris. The piece, beautifully
arranged with strings and partial
orchestral accompaniment,
emerges as one of the album's
showpieces.
The album has many.
"Summer Breeze" is done
especially well. The vocal is
excellent (in my opinion better
than Seals and Crofts), as is the
softly flowing music with
euphonic bell percussions. Side A
becomes complete with a
rhythmic "California My Way"
and an excellent background
harmonic "Have You Ever Tried
It."
Side B continues successfully,
including two current radio hits,
"Happiness is Just Around the
Bend" and "Just Don't Want To
Be Lonely." Both tunes feature
exceptional vocals and very
danceable rhythms.
The Main Ingredient on this
side also features a cut written by
a man named Wonder. Their
version of "Don't You Worry
'Bout A Thing" is very similar to
Stevies, yet still quite pretty due
to the harmonics of the vocalists.
Mv favorite on this side.

however, is "Looks Like Rain."
"Rain" is a delicate number with
some of the best harmony to be
found anywhere. The melody is
compassionate and catchy. Listen
to it. I guarantee you'll find
yourself humming it!
Euphrates River will be a
welcome addition to any R&B
collection. The album features
some very mellow soulful music
with very creative arrangements,
thanks to Bert De Coteaux, who
arranged and conducted the
effort. The cover work is quite
exquisite, featuring very colorful
artistic work by Walter Rogers.
The total effort has, in my
opinion, been successful.
Successful, if only for the
beautiful harmonies (though I
think the album wins on more
points than that), however, it is
in the essence of harmony that
we find the main ingredient.

Spinners
Mighty Love
Atlantic SD 726
Atlantic, reknowned for
recognizing talent — Donny
Hathaway, Led Zepplin, Yes, Ray
Charles, Roberta Flack, Aretha
Franklin — to mention a few, has
released a new album by the
Spinners. Mighty Love, the groups
latest effort since Spinners proves
slightly disappointing in
comparison to the latter. Side one
is composed of many throw-aways
worthy of no further comment.
The album does, however,
contain many excellent cuts
which are to be found on side
two.
"He'll Never Love You Like I
Do" is a mellow, moderately
paced jam featuring a unique
trumpet parody melody, and
some quality background vocals.
"Love Has Gone Away" features a
funky Temptations reminiscent

beginning that leads into a lighter,
more mellow type of trip.
"Love Don't Love Nobody,"
my favorite, is such because of it's
sensitivity in relaying the
emotions of one who once
deemed himself a fool for being
unable to relate his feelings of
love. Some people will know what
I'm talking about. "Mighty Love,"
the albums Top-of-the-charts title
cut appropriately closes the
album.

jumps out to grab its listener,
including the title track, rumored
to be the group's next single.
"I reckon when we got back
after the 10 weeks in the States
we were like a million times better
band than when we left, although
when we left we thought we were
great," says Gavin Sutherland.
Well Gavin, it's time for a
reevaluation of your sound; it's
not as together as you think.

The Main Ingredient
Euphrates River
RCA APL 1-0335
The Main Ingredient, riding a
crest of continuing popularity
after "Greatest Hits," has released
a new album. Produced by
Silvester, Simmons, Gooding at
RCA in New York Euphrates
River has been rapidly making
itself known amongst rhythm and
blues devotees.
The Main Ingredient, with
slightly different personnel, has
continued the Ingredient tradition
of mellow, danceable melodies,
and fine, sometimes ethereal
harmonies.
Side A of the album features
two works by Seals and Crofts.
The first, the title cut
"Euphrates" is a musical journey
through the lands leading to he
Tigris. The piece, beautifully
arranged with strings and partial
orchestral accompaniment,
emerges as one of the album's
showpieces.
The album has many.
"Summer Breeze" is done
especially well. The vocal is
excellent (in my opinion better
than Seals and Crofts), as is the
softly flowing music with
euphonic bell percussions. Side A
becomes complete with a
rhythmic "California My Way"
and an excellent background
harmonic "Have You Ever Tried
It."
Side B continues successfully,
including two current radio hits,
"Happiness is Just Around the
Bend" and "Just Don't Want To
Be Lonely." Both tunes feature
exceptional vocals and very
danceable rhythms.
The Main Ingredient on this
side also features a cut written by
a man named Wonder. Their
version of "Don't You Worry
'Bout A Thing" is very similar to
Stevies, yet still quite pretty due
to the harmonics of the vocalists.
Mv favorite on this side.

however, is "Looks Like Rain."
"Rain" is a delicate number with
some of the best harmony to be
found anywhere. The melody is
compassionate and catchy. Listen
to it. I guarantee you'll find
yourself humming it!
Euphrates River will be a
welcome addition to any R&B
collection. The album features
some very mellow soulful music
with very creative arrangements,
thanks to Bert De Coteaux, who
arranged and conducted the
effort. The cover work is quite
exquisite, featuring very colorful
artistic work by Walter Rogers.
The total effort has, in my
opinion, been successful.
Successful, if only for the
beautiful harmonies (though I
think the album wins on more
points than that), however, it is
in the essence of harmony that
we find the main ingredient.

Spinners
Mighty Love
Atlantic SD 726
Atlantic, reknowned for
recognizing talent — Donny
Hathaway, Led Zepplin, Yes, Ray
Charles, Roberta Flack, Aretha
Franklin — to mention a few, has
released a new album by the
Spinners. Mighty Love, the groups
latest effort since Spinners proves
slightly disappointing in
comparison to the latter. Side one
is composed of many throw-aways
worthy of no further comment.
The album does, however,
contain many excellent cuts
which are to be found on side
two.
"He'll Never Love You Like I
Do" is a mellow, moderately
paced jam featuring a unique
trumpet parody melody, and
some quality background vocals.
"Love Has Gone Away" features a
funky Temptations reminiscent

beginning that leads into a lighter,
more mellow type of trip.
"Love Don't Love Nobody,"
my favorite, is such because of it's
sensitivity in relaying the
emotions of one who once
deemed himself a fool for being
unable to relate his feelings of
love. Some people will know what
I'm talking about. "Mighty Love,"
the albums Top-of-the-charts title
cut appropriately closes the
album.
Produced by Thom Bell at
Sigma Sound in Philadelphia,
Mighty Ix)ve could have been a
major stepping stone in the
careers of the Spinners.
The musical unit is beyond
reproach, as are the back-up
vocals led by Barbara Ingram,
Carla Benton, and Yvette Benson.
The arrangements are innovative
and creative. With all this going
for the Spinners it is unfortunate
that the material is not always on
par with the rest of the effort.

DKSTINED TO BE ETERNAL BACKUPS?—The Sutherland Bros, and Quiver, who backed up Elton
John's highly successful U.S. tour last summer, seem to have failed to capitalize on their opportunities for
stardom. Their latest album, 'Dream Kid,' lacks the necessary energy that usually marks a hit album.

PUTTING IN A LITTLE SOUL—The Spinners just released their first album since their very successful
'Spinners' album of last year. 'Mighty Love,' their new release is sure to have at least a couple of songs ride
into fame on the air waves of radio stations.
