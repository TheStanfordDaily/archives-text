# Laguna Seca Test Sunday
## Civil Engineering Grad Races Cars 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
What would you expect a
Stanford graduate in civil
engineering to do for a living,
work for Lockheed, Kaiser or U.S.
Steel? Those are reasonable
assumtpions, but Walt Maas of
Mountain View is one civil
engineer who would rather make
money elsewhere — driving a race
car.
Maas, who did hold a position
at Lockheed in Sunnyvale for 11
years, will be at the wheel of a
Datsun 240Z this weekend
attempting to win some of the
$55,000 up for grabs at the
Monterey Triple Crown at Laguna
Seca Raceway.
Over 80 of the best drivers in
the nation are vying for 40 spots
in the Camel GT Challenge series,
which is making its inaugural
appearance on the West Coast.
Practice and qualifying is
scheduled for tomorrow in
preparation for Sunday's two
50-lap heats that offer $35,000 in
prize money.
There are also some 50 drivers
entered in the $10,000 Gold Cup
Super Vee Series race and a
similar number of entries for the
$10,000 B.F. Goodrich Radial
Challenge race for mini-stock
sedans.

Maas, of the class of '55, will
be driving against some of the
fastest and most powerful cars
possible in his own classification.
"There are going to be a lot of
more powerful cars," said Maas,
"but my car is set up well for the
course."
Laguna Seca, site of several
events annually, is a treacherous
1.9-mile layout situation on a
tract of land leased from Fort Ord,
a U.S. Army installation.
The competition Maas faces
will be composed mainly of brand
new Porsche Carreras driven by A 1
Holbert of Warrington, Pa., and
Peter Gregg of Jacksonville, Fla.
Holbert managed to win the
opening Camel GT race at Road
Atlanta three weeks ago defeating
Gregg, the current series
champion, and John Greenwood
of Troy, Mich., who drives a
Corvette which reportedly cost
$90,000 to build.
"They [the big cars] should be
two to three seconds faster than
me in lap times," said Maas, who
left Lockheed after winning the
Olympia Sprints, also held at
Laguna Seca, last summer. He
went to work for F.A.R.
Performance of Mountain View as
a full time driver and co-ordinator
of their racing team.

Every time Maas, who has been
racing for 12 years, has raced at
Laguna Seca, he has been involved
in a duel that was not decided by
more than a few seconds. And
each race was against a favored
driver with a national reputation.
"That giant-killer business kind of
caught on with the fans," said
Maas. "It makes it more enjoyable
to drive at Monterey."
Maas has already gotten some
practice in at Laguna Seca this
year. He was down in Monterey
last month to show actor Paul
Newman the "ropes" of the
course. "Paul is a reasonably
decent driver," said Maas, of the
tentative Camel GT entrant.
Another local driver, Jim
Barber of Los Altos, would have
entered his corvette, but had the
misfortune of breaking his arm in
a fall a couple of weeks ago. "Jim
had a real goofy accident," said
Maas, "He tripped over a street

planter or something."
Other local drivers are Jim
Hurlinger and Greg Peterson of
Palo Alto and Rich Stoma of
Cupertino. All three drive
Corvettes.
''Those Corvettes and Carreras
are going to be much faster than
me in the straightaways," said
Maas. "But I think I can win in
the under-2.5 liter class and will
still be in there trying to take it
all."
The first heat for the Camel
GT cars is scheduled for 10:45
a.m. Sunday. The Ist race of the
weekend is the second 50-lap heat
at 3:25 p.m. The purse in the first
race is $10,000 and the second
heat prize money is $25,000.
Student discount tickets for
the International Motor Sports
Association-sponsored event are
available at Tresidder Box Office.
Children under 12 are admitted
free.

Laguna Seca, site of several
events annually, is a treacherous
1.9-mile layout situation on a
tract of land leased from Fort Ord,
a U.S. Army installation.
The competition Maas faces
will be composed mainly of brand
new Porsche Carreras driven by A 1
Holbert of Warrington, Pa., and
Peter Gregg of Jacksonville, Fla.
Holbert managed to win the
opening Camel GT race at Road
Atlanta three weeks ago defeating
Gregg, the current series
champion, and John Greenwood
of Troy, Mich., who drives a
Corvette which reportedly cost
$90,000 to build.
"They [the big cars] should be
two to three seconds faster than
me in lap times," said Maas, who
left Lockheed after winning the
Olympia Sprints, also held at
Laguna Seca, last summer. He
went to work for F.A.R.

Every time Maas, who has been
racing for 12 years, has raced at
Laguna Seca, he has been involved
in a duel that was not decided by
more than a few seconds. And
each race was against a favored
driver with a national reputation.
"That giant-killer business kind of
caught on with the fans," said
Maas. "It makes it more enjoyable
to drive at Monterey."
Maas has already gotten some
practice in at Laguna Seca this
year. He was down in Monterey
last month to show actor Paul
Newman the "ropes" of the
course. "Paul is a reasonably
decent driver," said Maas, of the
tentative Camel GT entrant.
Another local driver, Jim
Barber of Los Altos, would have
entered his corvette, but had the
misfortune of breaking his arm in
a fall a couple of weeks ago. "Jim
had a real goofy accident," said
Maas, "He tripped over a street

planter or something."
Other local drivers are Jim
Hurlinger and Greg Peterson of
Palo Alto and Rich Stoma of
Cupertino. All three drive
Corvettes.
''Those Corvettes and Carreras
are going to be much faster than
me in the straightaways," said
Maas. "But I think I can win in
the under-2.5 liter class and will
still be in there trying to take it
all."
The first heat for the Camel
GT cars is scheduled for 10:45
a.m. Sunday. The Ist race of the
weekend is the second 50-lap heat
at 3:25 p.m. The purse in the first
race is $10,000 and the second
heat prize money is $25,000.

Maas, who did hold a position
at Lockheed in Sunnyvale for 11

Maas, of the class of '55, will
