# Closed-Door Session
## Impeachment Probe Begins 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)- The House
Judiciary Committee met behind
closed doors yesterday for the initial
presentation of evidence in its historic
inquiry into whether there are grounds
for the impeachment of President
Nixon.
At a 2 1 /2-hour session, committee
members received evidence covering
the events leading up to the June 17,
1972, break-in at the Democratic
National Committee headquarters. It
included development early that year
of plans by Nixon campaign officials
to collect political intelligence.
Each of the 38 committee members
received a thick black loose-leaf
notebook containing an index of all
the material collected by the
impeachment inquiry staff.

The members also received another
notebook which included specific
statements bearing on the allegations
against the President and documents
and transcripts dealing with them.
Flurry Of Calls
Presentation of evidence began
amid a new flurry of calls for the
President to reconsider his decision
not to resign and to fight the
impeachment attempt.
Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr.,
D-N.J., in a brief opening statement,
said, "I don't need to stress again the
importance of our undertaking and the
wisdom, decency and principle which
we must bring to it.
"We understand our high
constitutional responsibility. We will
faithfully live up to it."
The senior Republican on the
committee, Rep. Edward Hutchinson
of Michigan, referred to the panel
starting "consideration of the most
awesome power constitutionally
vested in the House of
Representatives."
Closed Session
The two opening statements took
less than eight minutes to read and
then the committee voted 31 to 6 to
begin hearing the evidence in closed
session.
James D. St. Clair, President
Nixon's chief Watergate lawyer, was
allowed to sit in on the hearing and
was the first participant to arrive at
the committee room.
Accompanied by two other White

House lawyers, St. Clair said he
planned no opening statement and
"neither have I been asked to make
one."
Asked if he considered the
Judiciary Committee's role equivalent
to that of a grand jury, St. Clair
replied, "Clearly not."
Packed House
The 150 seats in the committee
room filled early, 90 of them with
reporters and most of the others with
relatives or friends of committee
members.
A long line had formed outside the
hearing room with people hoping to
attend the historic session. Only 10
got in.
Dominated by Democrats the
membership of the committee
numbers 38 and includes two women,
three blacks and a Catholic priest, all
of them lawyers.
The key issue in this first phase of
the presentation of evidence will be
whether the material dealing with
President Nixon's Watergate role is
grounds for his impeachment.
A simple majority is required to
approve impeachment in the House. If
it is approved, the Senate would take
up the issue, where a two-thirds
majority is needed for conviction.
Rodino said the phase dealing with
the Watergate break-in and cover-up
"is one of six areas of our inquiry. We
expect to continue our inquiry until
each area has been thoroughly
examined," he said.

the events leading up to the June 17,
1972, break-in at the Democratic
National Committee headquarters. It
included development early that year
of plans by Nixon campaign officials
to collect political intelligence.
Each of the 38 committee members
received a thick black loose-leaf
notebook containing an index of all
the material collected by the
impeachment inquiry staff.

The members also received another
notebook which included specific
statements bearing on the allegations
against the President and documents
and transcripts dealing with them.
Flurry Of Calls
Presentation of evidence began
amid a new flurry of calls for the
President to reconsider his decision
not to resign and to fight the
impeachment attempt.
Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr.,
D-N.J., in a brief opening statement,
said, "I don't need to stress again the
importance of our undertaking and the
wisdom, decency and principle which
we must bring to it.
"We understand our high
constitutional responsibility. We will
faithfully live up to it."
The senior Republican on the
committee, Rep. Edward Hutchinson
of Michigan, referred to the panel
starting "consideration of the most
awesome power constitutionally
vested in the House of
Representatives."
Closed Session
The two opening statements took
less than eight minutes to read and
then the committee voted 31 to 6 to
begin hearing the evidence in closed
session.
James D. St. Clair, President
Nixon's chief Watergate lawyer, was
allowed to sit in on the hearing and
was the first participant to arrive at
the committee room.
Accompanied by two other White

House lawyers, St. Clair said he
planned no opening statement and
"neither have I been asked to make
one."
Asked if he considered the
Judiciary Committee's role equivalent
to that of a grand jury, St. Clair
replied, "Clearly not."
Packed House
The 150 seats in the committee
room filled early, 90 of them with
reporters and most of the others with
relatives or friends of committee
members.
A long line had formed outside the
hearing room with people hoping to
attend the historic session. Only 10
got in.
Dominated by Democrats the
membership of the committee
numbers 38 and includes two women,
three blacks and a Catholic priest, all
of them lawyers.
The key issue in this first phase of
the presentation of evidence will be
whether the material dealing with
President Nixon's Watergate role is
grounds for his impeachment.
A simple majority is required to
approve impeachment in the House. If
it is approved, the Senate would take
up the issue, where a two-thirds
majority is needed for conviction.
Rodino said the phase dealing with
the Watergate break-in and cover-up
"is one of six areas of our inquiry. We
expect to continue our inquiry until
each area has been thoroughly
examined," he said.

Nixon.
