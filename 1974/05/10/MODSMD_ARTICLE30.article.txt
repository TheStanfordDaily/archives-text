# Revitalized Cards Go For Pennant
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
The afternoon sun was warm and bright
but a brisk chilling wind made the tedious
task of shagging for batting practice more
arduous for the Stanford baseball players
in Sunken Diamond.
At that point, the Cardinals were 14-21
overall and 3-6 in the Pacific Eight
Southern Division. That chilly wind
seemed like it would exhume those
ballplayers and carry them away to
oblivion.
That scene was two weeks ago.
Wednesday, the atmosphere was altogether
different. Of course, the sun was still there.
But the exuberance of Stanford's baseball
team was unmistakable. No longer was that
chilly wind blowing, the players were
dressed only in shorts and jerseys and were
on their way to the divisional
championship. What has transpired in those
two weeks?
When the Cards play their final
scheduled home game in Sunken Diamond
this afternoon against California the goal
will be for a tenth straight victory taking
another step closer to clinching the
divisional championship.
"Two weeks ago nobody ever would
have thought this would happen," said
Stanford head coach Ray Young with a
smile as he surveyed batting practice.

"One of the things in our favor was that
t all the coaches themselves, have not let up
»on anyone physically," he said.
■ "Consequently, when they [the players]
» were down mentally it was easier to come
back. To me, now, our opponents are the
ones who are going to wilt and we're not."
As circumstances stand now the Cards,
23-21 for the season, are tied with USC for
first place, with 9-6 records. Stanford
finishes the conference scheduled
tomorrow with a doubleheader at Cal's
Evans Park in Berkeley.
USC is playing UCLA (6-9) in a
three-game series. If the two teams should
finish in a tie, Stanford would advance to
the Pac-8 playoffs on the basis of five wins
out of six games against USC in
head-to-head competition.
"It's going to be very difficult," said
Young. "I don't think that the attitude is
any different now than it has been all
season. We've worked hard all season. No
matter what it comes out to be, everybody
has put in the hard work."
Northern Division
Should the Cards advance to the Pac-8
playoffs against the Northern Division
champion they would be the hosts next
weekend in a best-of-three series. The
Northern Division championship will also
be decided this weekend.

Oregon currently leads the division with
a 10-5 mark but leads Washington State
(9-6) by only one game. Oregon plays
Oregon State while Washington State is
battling Washington.
To whom would one attribute this
sudden change in stature for the Cards? The
players can't answer the question. It has
been hard to pin down. Young diagnoses
the situation as if it was an epidemic.
"It isn't just one person," he said. "It's
everybody. From the coach's point of view
it's a pleasant atmosphere. We've been very
aggressive and very eager. The competition
is getting good between the guys on the
team."
Friendly Rivalry
One example of the intense friendly
competition on the team is the batting
practice format used. Assistant coach Mark
Marquess ran the pitching machine, "jugs,"
and called the base hits as the team was
divided into two squads.
Each player hit ten rounds, one of
which was bunting. Junior outfielder Kevin
Sullivan was on one team and sophomore
outfielder Bruce Robinson was on the
other.
Sullivan, noted for his power (he has hit
the longest home run by a Card this
season), challenged Robinson to equal him
in power. Sullivan had hit the green fence

on one ot his swings that day. Sullivan was
willing to put up five dollars against
Robinson's ability.
In Robinson's third time to the plate he
ripped a towering drive that seemed
destined to leave the park but dimunitive
second baseman Gary Bei leaped at the
fence and 'robbed' "Robby" of the home
run.
"You'll never do it, Robinson," said
Sullivan. "You'll never hit it out. I'll split
the money with you, Gary." However,
three rounds later Robinson conked one
that slammed against the top of the green
fence. Sullivan just stood there amazed.
A strategic move by Young has also
helped the Cards in the last week. Kim
Hannaford was moved from third base to
centerfield replacing Bob Hampton, who
was hampered by a strained achilles
tendon.
Al Arthur (4-6) is scheduled to pitch
this afternoon with Mike Williamson (5-3)
pitching the first game Saturday. The third
starter is still not named.
California will counter with lefthander
John Hughes, who blanked the Cards 1-0
last month, Juan Eichelberger and Gene
Litle.
All three games will be broadcast on
KZSU (90.1, FM).

players can't answer the question. It has
been hard to pin down. Young diagnoses
the situation as if it was an epidemic.
"It isn't just one person," he said. "It's
everybody. From the coach's point of view
it's a pleasant atmosphere. We've been very
aggressive and very eager. The competition
is getting good between the guys on the
team."
Friendly Rivalry
One example of the intense friendly
competition on the team is the batting
practice format used. Assistant coach Mark
Marquess ran the pitching machine, "jugs,"
and called the base hits as the team was
divided into two squads.
Each player hit ten rounds, one of
which was bunting. Junior outfielder Kevin
Sullivan was on one team and sophomore
outfielder Bruce Robinson was on the
other.
Sullivan, noted for his power (he has hit
the longest home run by a Card this
season), challenged Robinson to equal him
in power. Sullivan had hit the green fence

on one ot his swings that day. Sullivan was
willing to put up five dollars against
Robinson's ability.
In Robinson's third time to the plate he
ripped a towering drive that seemed
destined to leave the park but dimunitive
second baseman Gary Bei leaped at the
fence and 'robbed' "Robby" of the home
run.
"You'll never do it, Robinson," said
Sullivan. "You'll never hit it out. I'll split
the money with you, Gary." However,
three rounds later Robinson conked one
that slammed against the top of the green
fence. Sullivan just stood there amazed.
A strategic move by Young has also
helped the Cards in the last week. Kim
Hannaford was moved from third base to
centerfield replacing Bob Hampton, who
was hampered by a strained achilles
tendon.
Al Arthur (4-6) is scheduled to pitch
this afternoon with Mike Williamson (5-3)
pitching the first game Saturday. The third
starter is still not named.
California will counter with lefthander
John Hughes, who blanked the Cards 1-0
last month, Juan Eichelberger and Gene
Litle.
All three games will be broadcast on
KZSU (90.1, FM).
The afternoon sun was warm and bright
but a brisk chilling wind made the tedious
task of shagging for batting practice more
arduous for the Stanford baseball players
in Sunken Diamond.
At that point, the Cardinals were 14-21
overall and 3-6 in the Pacific Eight
Southern Division. That chilly wind
seemed like it would exhume those
ballplayers and carry them away to
oblivion.
That scene was two weeks ago.
Wednesday, the atmosphere was altogether
different. Of course, the sun was still there.
But the exuberance of Stanford's baseball
team was unmistakable. No longer was that
chilly wind blowing, the players were
dressed only in shorts and jerseys and were
on their way to the divisional
championship. What has transpired in those
two weeks?
When the Cards play their final
scheduled home game in Sunken Diamond
this afternoon against California the goal
will be for a tenth straight victory taking
another step closer to clinching the
divisional championship.
"Two weeks ago nobody ever would
have thought this would happen," said
Stanford head coach Ray Young with a
smile as he surveyed batting practice.

"One of the things in our favor was that
t all the coaches themselves, have not let up
»on anyone physically," he said.
■ "Consequently, when they [the players]
» were down mentally it was easier to come
back. To me, now, our opponents are the
ones who are going to wilt and we're not."
As circumstances stand now the Cards,
23-21 for the season, are tied with USC for
first place, with 9-6 records. Stanford
finishes the conference scheduled
tomorrow with a doubleheader at Cal's
Evans Park in Berkeley.
USC is playing UCLA (6-9) in a
three-game series. If the two teams should
finish in a tie, Stanford would advance to
the Pac-8 playoffs on the basis of five wins
out of six games against USC in
head-to-head competition.
"It's going to be very difficult," said
Young. "I don't think that the attitude is
any different now than it has been all
season. We've worked hard all season. No
matter what it comes out to be, everybody
has put in the hard work."
Northern Division
Should the Cards advance to the Pac-8
playoffs against the Northern Division
champion they would be the hosts next
weekend in a best-of-three series. The
Northern Division championship will also
be decided this weekend.

Oregon currently leads the division with
a 10-5 mark but leads Washington State
(9-6) by only one game. Oregon plays
Oregon State while Washington State is
battling Washington.

team was unmistakable. No longer was that
chilly wind blowing, the players were
dressed only in shorts and jerseys and were
on their way to the divisional
championship. What has transpired in those
two weeks?
When the Cards play their final
scheduled home game in Sunken Diamond
this afternoon against California the goal
will be for a tenth straight victory taking
another step closer to clinching the
divisional championship.
"Two weeks ago nobody ever would
have thought this would happen," said
Stanford head coach Ray Young with a
smile as he surveyed batting practice.

"One of the things in our favor was that
t all the coaches themselves, have not let up
»on anyone physically," he said.
■ "Consequently, when they [the players]
» were down mentally it was easier to come
back. To me, now, our opponents are the
ones who are going to wilt and we're not."
As circumstances stand now the Cards,
23-21 for the season, are tied with USC for
first place, with 9-6 records. Stanford
finishes the conference scheduled
tomorrow with a doubleheader at Cal's
Evans Park in Berkeley.
USC is playing UCLA (6-9) in a
three-game series. If the two teams should
finish in a tie, Stanford would advance to
the Pac-8 playoffs on the basis of five wins
out of six games against USC in
head-to-head competition.
"It's going to be very difficult," said
Young. "I don't think that the attitude is
any different now than it has been all
season. We've worked hard all season. No
matter what it comes out to be, everybody
has put in the hard work."
Northern Division
Should the Cards advance to the Pac-8
playoffs against the Northern Division
champion they would be the hosts next
weekend in a best-of-three series. The
Northern Division championship will also
be decided this weekend.

Oregon currently leads the division with
a 10-5 mark but leads Washington State
(9-6) by only one game. Oregon plays
Oregon State while Washington State is
battling Washington.
To whom would one attribute this
sudden change in stature for the Cards? The
players can't answer the question. It has
been hard to pin down. Young diagnoses
the situation as if it was an epidemic.
"It isn't just one person," he said. "It's
everybody. From the coach's point of view
it's a pleasant atmosphere. We've been very
aggressive and very eager. The competition
is getting good between the guys on the
team."
Friendly Rivalry
One example of the intense friendly
competition on the team is the batting
practice format used. Assistant coach Mark
Marquess ran the pitching machine, "jugs,"
and called the base hits as the team was
divided into two squads.
Each player hit ten rounds, one of
which was bunting. Junior outfielder Kevin
Sullivan was on one team and sophomore
outfielder Bruce Robinson was on the
other.
Sullivan, noted for his power (he has hit
the longest home run by a Card this
season), challenged Robinson to equal him
in power. Sullivan had hit the green fence

on one ot his swings that day. Sullivan was
willing to put up five dollars against
Robinson's ability.
In Robinson's third time to the plate he
ripped a towering drive that seemed
destined to leave the park but dimunitive
second baseman Gary Bei leaped at the
fence and 'robbed' "Robby" of the home
run.
"You'll never do it, Robinson," said
Sullivan. "You'll never hit it out. I'll split
the money with you, Gary." However,
three rounds later Robinson conked one
that slammed against the top of the green
fence. Sullivan just stood there amazed.
A strategic move by Young has also
helped the Cards in the last week. Kim
Hannaford was moved from third base to
centerfield replacing Bob Hampton, who
was hampered by a strained achilles
tendon.
Al Arthur (4-6) is scheduled to pitch
this afternoon with Mike Williamson (5-3)
pitching the first game Saturday. The third
starter is still not named.
California will counter with lefthander
John Hughes, who blanked the Cards 1-0
last month, Juan Eichelberger and Gene
Litle.
All three games will be broadcast on
KZSU (90.1, FM).
