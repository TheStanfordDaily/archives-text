Nad team.

Erich Lee taking second, Dave
Allen tenth, and George Babikian
11th. El Toro was third, led by

In softball this week an
unusual protest saved Sigma Chi,
last year's champion, from its
second loss, and from losing any
chance for a playoff spot.
In a game last Friday against
KA with the score tied 8-all in the
top of the seventh inning, Jim
Montague hit a long fly over the
KA rightfielder's head.
As he rounded first, he was
knocked off balance by the KA's
first baseman. Montague, as a
result of this and his extraordinary
lack of speed, was unable to score.
The umpire ruled he wouldn't
have scored anyway and said the
first baseman's interference was
unintentional.
Montague was unable to score
and KA went on to win 9-8 in 14
innings. However, after protesting
the call to the IM office it was
ruled that the interference is still
interference even if it is
unintentional and Sigma Chi was
awarded the run to lead 9-8.

In softball this week an
unusual protest saved Sigma Chi,
last year's champion, from its
second loss, and from losing any
chance for a playoff spot.
In a game last Friday against
KA with the score tied 8-all in the
top of the seventh inning, Jim
Montague hit a long fly over the
KA rightfielder's head.
As he rounded first, he was
knocked off balance by the KA's
first baseman. Montague, as a
result of this and his extraordinary
lack of speed, was unable to score.
The umpire ruled he wouldn't
have scored anyway and said the
first baseman's interference was
unintentional.
Montague was unable to score
and KA went on to win 9-8 in 14
innings. However, after protesting
the call to the IM office it was
ruled that the interference is still
interference even if it is
unintentional and Sigma Chi was
awarded the run to lead 9-8.
