## Are Slumping A's Still Best? 
### Don Tollefson 
"The way we've been playing is cause for
concern, but not for worry. "
—Reggie Jackson.
Don't look now, but the Oakland A's are
in the midst of their annual attempt to
convince everyone of their impending doom.
The World Champions are currently fielding
like pregnant hippos, hitting like scurvy
victims and if it weren't for the hitting of
Jackson and the pitching of Catfish Hunter,
they might be challenging Pittsburgh for the
worst record in the majors today.
A rundown of individual performances
reads like that of a first year expansion team.
Catcher-first baseman Gene Tenace is hitting
.218; centerfielder Billy North .178; utility
infielder Ted Kubiak .153 and designated
hitter Deron Johnson is stinging the ball at a
.130 clip. With hitting like this, the quality of
your pitching becomes somewhat irrelevant.
But massive hitting improvement will have
to be matched by considerably better
pitching and fielding before the A's begin to
return to their championship form of the
past two seasons.
Pitchers' Problems
Vida Blue finally won his first game
Wednesday night, but up until then he was
pitching like a person who definitely should
abandon baseball in favor of the World
Football League, as he has recently
threatened.
John Odom was a mystery all last season
and if anything, his problems are getting
worse as his earned run average continues to

rise meteorically. Ken Holtzman got bombed
for five runs and 11 hits in three innings
Tuesday and he has won only two games in
six decisions.
To make matters worse, Saturday's
bumbling performance came only one day
after the A's had held an unprecedented
team meeting to discuss discipline and — you
guessed it — fundamentals. Manager Alvin
Dark sat outside and played with his lineup
card while the players discussed their current
problems.
Bando, who called the meeting, described
it this way: "We just threw it open to the
floor and we talked about hustling and
executing the fundamentals. Sure, Dark
hasn't seen us for awhile and doesn't know
what we can do. But that's no excuse not to
hustle."
The session seemed to have been
worthwhile as the A's went out and beat
Cleveland 3-1 Friday night, but it didn't take
long for them to return to their errant ways
and the A's have now lost seven of their last
ten games.
Tight Division
With their 13-15 record, the A's are in
fifth place in the American League West, but
they are only two games behind
division-leading Texas in a division where the
cellar-dwelling Kansas City Royals are only
two-and-a-half games off the pace.
Still, the doomsday prophets are already
confident that this year the A's will join
Rome in the ranks of fallen empires.

Cincinnati, who trails Los Angeles in the
National League West by five-and-a-half
games, has been the subject of similar
speculation and everyone seems to be
forgetting that 28 games do not a season
make.
For anyone who has followed the A's in
recent seasons, there are some clear signs that
all is not lost. Oakland pitchers frequently
belittle some of Dark's pitching moves; team
members often publicly snicker at baseball's
first designated pitch runner, Herb
Washington, who has apparently still not
learned that two players cannot occupy the
same base at once; and the entire team bad
mouths the Oakland Coliseum's
groundskeepers because of the condition of
the grass in the stadium.
The continued dissension is encouraging,
but more importantly, Jackson is playing like
a madman. He is hitting .392 and talk of a
possible .400 season is already making the
rumor rounds. Jackson leads the league in
RBIs with 30 and is tied for the home run
leadership with 11.
Jackson and Hunter are keeping the A's
competitive and it is hard to believe that the
rest of the team won't soon be rounding into
normal form. As long as Charlie Finley doesn't
fire Dark and trade his entire club for a
minor league team, I'm still certain the A's
will be back in the World Series again in
October. But I've long since learned never to
put anything beyond the irrepressible Mr.
Finley.
