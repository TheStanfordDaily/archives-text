# Stanford Spikers Try To Qualify For Pac-8
## 
### MARK WHITE 
For many of the runners
comprising that half of the
Stanford track team participating
in the West Coast Relays in
Fresno tomorrow, it represents
the last chance to meet qualifying
standards for the Pac-8 meet being
held May 17 and 18 in Los
Angeles.
For those who don't equal *he
established cutoff points,
tomorrow may be the last day of
competition for the 1974 season.
But for those who have already
qualified, the West Coast Relays
means something else.
"We have two goals
tomorrow," said Stanford coach
Payton Jordan, "First, to get men
like Ken Curl and Derek Tolliver
into the Pac-8 meet, and second,
to build up the confidence of
those who have already

qualified."
This will be the last chance for
Curl, a 9.3 sprinter last year who
has had conditioning problems
this season. Last year, Curl placed
fourth in the 100 (9.6) and third
in the 220 (21.0) in the Pac-8
finals, but the senior from
Houston will have to run 9.6 and
21.4 tomorrow to be invited back
for the trials next Friday.
"If John Kessel runs well in
relays this Saturday, then he may
get a leg on the team we send to
the league meet. But we may have
to count on [Dave] Bagshaw if
Kessel is still having trouble," said
Jordan.
Bagshaw is one of the athletes
Jordan hopes will become more
confident in running at Fresno.
Bagshaw started the season strong,
but had health problems that led
to relatively slow performances.
"We may have Bagshaw just run
the intermediates in the Pac-8
meet," added Jordan, "depending
on how he looks in the highs this
weekend."
Ken Kring will be preparing for
a stab at the Pac-8 decathlon title
by working on the long jump,
pole vault and 440. UCLA's
temperamental Sam Albanese
(7508) and Craig Brigham (7238)
of Oregon should give Kring the
most trouble next week in Los
Angeles.
Bagshaw and teammate hurdler
Matt Hogsett are currently ranked
third and eighth in the Pac-8 in
the intermediates.
