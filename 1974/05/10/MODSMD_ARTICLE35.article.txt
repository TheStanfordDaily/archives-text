# Hagey, Whitlinger Score State Upsets
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Everyone who saw John
Whitlinger and Chico Hagey play
during the last few weeks knew
that either Stanford star was
capable of pulling off a major
upset.
Yesterday, they both did.
During the round of 16 at the
California State Championships at
the Alpine Hills Tennis Club in
Portola Valley, the fans were
surprised as Hagey beat the U.S.'s
20th ranked player, Tom
Leonard, in two tiebreakers, 7-6,

7-6. Meanwhile, Whitlinger played
well, but surprised less than
Hagey, in topping 28th ranked
Sh?rwood Stewart, 6-4, 6-2.
Leonard anu Stewart were seeded
second and fourth in the tourney
behind absent Sandy Mayer, who
pulled out after his tooth was.
In a third match of interest,
Stanford freshman Gene Mayer,
who beat Cal's top player
Tuesday, downed teammate Nick
Saviano 6-3, 7-6. A fourth
Stanford entrant, Jim Delaney,
also reached the Alpine Hills
quarters by beating Torben Ulrich
6-3, 6-3.
Mark Mitchell was eliminated
yesterday by Jim McManus, 6-4,
6-1.
While Stanford coach Dick
Gould was pleased by Gene
Mayer's win, it presents him with
an unusual problem. Both Saviano
and Mitchell are in the top six in
Gould's lineup, but the seventh
and eighth players, Hagey and
Mayer, have done better in this
tournament. The coach will have
to make a decision before the
Pacific Eight tournament in
Seattle next week.
In today's quarterfinal pairings,
Mayer faces Whitlinger, Delaney
plays high school star Bill Maze,
Hagey plays Roy Barth and Jim
McManus plays Bill Brown.
McManus eliminated Card
sophomore Mark Mitchell 6-4, 6-1
today.
In doubles, as in singles, fully
half the eight quarter-finalists are
Stan ford-related teams.
Mitchell-Saviano beat Hugh
Kamakama-Greg Shepard 6-4, 5-7,
7-5, while Hagey-Maver topped
Hugh Ditzler-Clif Mane 6-3, 6-2.
Delaney playing with Bill Brown,
downed Jim McManus-Don
Jacobs, 6-3, 6-2.
A team of Stanford players
recently turned professional. Rick
Fisher-Paul Sidone, is also in the
quarters after beating
Leonard-Edlefson 3-6, 6-4,
default.
Today, Hagey-Mayer meet
Barth-Ulrich, who yesterday
vanquished yet another Stanford
team, Jake Warde-Tim Noonan,
7-5, 6-3. Meanwhile,
Mitchell-Saviano face a tough test,
playing the nation's eighth-ranked
team, Stewart-Dick Dell.
