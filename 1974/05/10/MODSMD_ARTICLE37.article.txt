GOP Leaders Favor Stepdown
WASHINGTON — One House Republican leader
said yesterday the country would benefit if
President Nixon resigned and a Republican senator
said Nixon should consider resignation "as a
possible option."
Sen. Marlow Cook, a Kentucky Republican, said
Nixon should consider resignation, and informed
sources said that Sen. Richard Schweiker, a
Pennsylvania Republican, would call for Nixon's
resignation at a news conference scheduled here
today.
Rep. John B. Anderson, chairman of the House
Republican conference, said the country would
benefit. Rep. John Rhodes of Arizona, House GOP
leader, said Nixon "ought to consider resignation as
a possible option if erosion of public confidence
bars him from effectively carrying out his duties."
Their comments came on the day the House
Judiciary Committee met behind closed doors for
the initial presentation of evidence in its inquiry
into whether there are grounds for impeachment of
President Nixon.
The Senate Watergate committee also met behind
closed doors with C.G. "Bebe" Rebozo, Nixon's
personal friend, appearing.
The committee has subpoenaed detailed financial
records of Rebozo, including those dealing with
loans to or from Nixon, Patricia Nixon Cox and the
President's two brothers, court papers showed.
New Testimony In Allen Case
OAKLAND — A pathologist testified yesterday
that Samuel Allen Jr. died of "a bullet wound in the
head and brain."
Dr. Paul Herrmann's declaration came during the
murder trial of Andrew D. Lyons, 39, charged with
murdering Allen last Sept. 10.
Allen's heart was later used in a transplant
operation at Stanford Medical Center after doctors
had declared him legally dead.
Famed Stanford heart specialist Norman
Shumway transplanted Allen's heart into the chest

of a Utah construction worker, who later died
despite the surgery. Shumway is scheduled to testify
Monday.
John Cruikshank, Lyons' lawyer, maintains that
Allen was not dead when the doctors removed his
heart two days after the Sept. 10 shooting.
The case is expected to lead to a new definition
of death in California law. The defense maintains
that Lyons could not be charged with murder since
doctors had kept Allen's heart beating up until the
time of the transplant.
Herrmann examined the body two days after the
shooting. He found that a surgical incision made in
the victim's chest had not resulted in bleeding nor
did it show signs of healing. Hermann said that
Allen must have been dead at that point.
Alleged Zebras Plead Innocent
SAN FRANCISCO — Three young black men
pleaded innocent yesterday to charges that they
murdered three of 13 persons killed in a wave of
random Zebra street attacks on whites.
Municipal Court Judge Agnes O'Brien Smith set
bail at $250,000 each for Manuel Moore, 29; Larry
C. Green, 22, and J.C. Simon, 29.
She also tightened a gag order against prejudicial
publicity on the case and included the news media.
Meanwhile, the informer who gave police
information leading to the Zebra arrests was
identified yesterday as Anthony Cornelius Harris, a
convicted burglar.
Canadian Elections Set
OTTAWA — Canadians are going to the polls
July 8, and Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau
said yesterday one of the main campaign weapons of
his Liberal party will be the same budget that
brought down his minority government.
Trudeau lost a vote of confidence on the budget
Monday and was forced to seek new elections. His
economic proposals were billed by the government
as hitting the corporations — "the big guys" — while
helping low income earners and others less able to
defend themselves against inflation.

Hearst Case Baffling FBI
WASHINGTON - FBI Director Clarence M.
Kelley said yesterday the agency is stumped by the
Patricia Hearst case and so far has no proof that she
willingly participated in a bank robbery.
"We are stumped," Kelley told a news
conference three months after the daughter of
newspaper executive Randolph A. Hearst was
carried screaming from her Berkeley apartment.
"They have restricted their activities," Kelley
said, "They're holed up. They've got friends
obviously who are helping them. They have found
the key insofar as eluding the FBI up to this point."
But he promised, "In the event we do determine
where she is, we're going to go in. We're going to
exert every effort to not injure and certainly not kill
anybody. It's going to be well-planned, but we're
going in."
No Progress In Mideast Talks
CAIRO — The chances of an Israeli-Syrian
disengagement on the Golan Heights are less than
50-50 despite nine days of personal diplomacy by
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, American
officials said yesterday.
The officials, speaking as Kissinger shuttled from
Saudi Arabia to Cairo for talks with Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat, said Syria and Israel are
barely "in the starting block" toward a settlement.
The two sides are exchanging "complete
considerations" but have not agreed on a
disengagement boundary, the officials said.
Today's Weather

coast nights and mornings. High temperatures today
and tomorrow 60s to low 70s except upper 50s
along the coast. Lows both nights upper 40s to low
50s. Small craft advisory San Francisco San Pablo
and Suisun Bays and West Delta for southwest
winds 15 to 30 mph. Elsewhere wind westerly 10 to
20 mph.
