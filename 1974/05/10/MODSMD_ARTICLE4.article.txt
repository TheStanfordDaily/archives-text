# Clinical Teaching 'Inadequate'
## Medical Students Voice Complaints 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
• Student complaints of poor clinical teaching
«<! the Stanford Medical School, growing quietly
since last quarter, emerged openly yesterday.
About 110 medical students attended a noon
meeting with Dean Clayton Rich, organized by
the Stanford Medical Students' Association
(SMSA). Their disagreement was low-keyed but
obvious: students in effect claimed that clinical
r ""ograms are in serious, almost critical
Condition; Rich said the school is "quite strong
in clinical teaching, and getting rapidly better."
Students complained that:
— One-third of the medical school's 17
departments, including the two largest —
medicine and surgery — now lack chairmen.
Rich has said that chairmen are "the key leaders
J the School."
— The school has failed to emphasize
teaching quality in decisions on faculty
appointment and promotion.
— The school has not attracted and held top
clinical teachers, because of low salaries and
limited clinical programs.
> — The school may lose its only affiliated
general hospital, the county-operated Valley
Medical Center.
Lack Of Chairmen
The departure of department chairmen is one
of the most serious problems. Two chairmen
from major departments — Dr. Daniel Federman
of medicine and Dr. Robert Chase of surgery —
resigned within the past two months.
Two departments — physiology and anatomy

— have operated without chairmen for the past
nine years, with a year-long break in 1971.
The pharmacology department has lacked a
chairman for two years; the obstetrics and
gynecology department has had no chairman for
a year.
By comparison, the University of California
at San Francisco medical school, with 23
departments, currently has one department
without a permanent chairman.
The reasons for the situation vary. Federman
came to Stanford from Harvard two years ago;
he has decided to return to Boston for "purely
personal reasons." He will become Associate
Chairman of Medicine at Massachusetts General
Hospital, and Professor of Medicine at Harvard.
Prefers Boston
Federman, a recognized teacher, had worked
to move the medicine department and its 12
divisions toward clinical work. He says he is
leaving simply because he and his family prefer
to live in Boston, although he admits that the
thought may offend Californians.
Federman vehemently denies any
disagreement with faculty members or the Dean,
and tries to squelch student rumors that he left
partly because of the limitations of the program
here. 'The school was prompt and generous in
recognizing the need for the department to
grow," he observed.
But he gently suggested weaknesses in
Stanford's medicine program, especially in
facilities and teaching resources. He said the
school needs many additional beds, expanded

clinic facilities (especially for ambulatory
patients), and more money to hire and keep
faculty members.
"Department of medicine salaries are still a
little below where they ought to be. We should
get closer to other outstanding schools. But, to
my knowledge, we haven't lost anyone yet
because of this," he said.
Federman believes the department needs to
grow further, but says that widespread interest
and agreement inside medicine will produce
fairly straightforward development in the
future.
Chase's resignation, to become President of
the National Board of Medical Examiners, is not
quite as apolitical. The surgeon has been an
outspoken advocate of expanded clinical
programs, additional beds and higher salaries.
Leave Of Absence
Chase did not resign from his faculty
position; instead, he asked for a leave of
absence, which Rich yesterday promised to
grant. The leave could run for a maximum of
two years.
Chase was out of town yesterday, unavailable
for comment.
In anatomy and physiology, the quality of
Stanford's physical plant has allowed the
program to atrophy. The departments are
housed in 70-year-old buildings near the
museum and on the outer quad.

and then put them in a museum," Medical

Center spokesman Spiros Andreopoulos
observed.
Rich says the situation will change in the
next few years. With completion of the $7.5
million Fairchild Neurosciences Center, he
expects to attract new chairmen who can hire
their own faculties.
Dr. Maxwell Cowan, chairman of anatomy at
Washington University, earlier this year accepted
and later rejected the anatomy chairmanship
here.
Red Tape
Rich says Cowan probably decided not to
come because of the magnitude of the effort
needed to build a new department, the red tape
involved in selecting faculty members at
Stanford and because of an attractive
counter-offer from the St. Louis university.

In pharmacology, the department is divided
into bitterly opposed factions, without a
permanent chairman. The schism was serious
enough that Rich asked Biology Prof.
Donald Kennedy to investigate and recommend
changes.
Kennedy has reported to Rich, after his
unusual, three-month review, but neither will
say what problems he explored or what he
recommended.
Acting Chairman Oleg Jardetzky said the
disputes focused on research resources, with
faculty members competing for lab space and
funds.
He says no search for a permanent chairman
has begun because the department has no
tenured vacancies. "I don't know what the
school expects us to do," he said.
Facts about teaching quality are harder to

come by than statistics on department heads,
but students insist that the medical school is not
committed to clinical teaching.
"A lot of teachers are feeling insecure or
planning to leave" because they feel Stanford
does not grant tenure to teachers, second-year
student Mike Amylon told Rich yesterday.
The dean disagreed, claiming that current
faculty and search committees have a "strong
emphasis on clinical excellence and clinical
teaching."
New Dean?
Amylon, president of the SMSA, elaborated
on his feelings after the meeting, "Whatever
commitment Dean Rich or the school claims to
have is not being followed through. There hasn't
been any big change. We've heard lip-service to
the concept of clinical teaching, but don't see
many things happening."

Amylon and others avoid explicit comment
on Rich, but they hint that they would prefer to
see someone else in the Dean's office.
"I don't think Dean Rich has shown himself
able to exert the kind of leadership that's
necessary," Amylon commented.
A major problem at Stanford is space for
patient care. The medical center has 620 beds
treated by private physicians, but 370 are
reserved for community patients from Palo
Alto.
Rich says a proposed 200-bed expansion
would cost $30 million, which the university
cannot afford in the forseeable future. A core
services building, which could eventually be
connected to new wards, is now under
construction, but no other new buildings are
planned.
