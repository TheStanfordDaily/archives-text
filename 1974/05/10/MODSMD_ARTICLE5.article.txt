# 'We Are Going To Strike USE President Declares

United Stanford Employees (USE)
will strike midnight Sunday, USE
President Jim Berk announced
yesterday afternoon.
"We did not receive a reasonable
response to our demands. There is no
question, we're going to strike," Berk
said.
"The University doesn't know how
to go about a strike and they are going
to hurt and when they hurt enough,
they will see clear to pay us the
money," he said.
The union represents 1400
technical, service and maintenance
employees as Local 680 of the Service
Employees International Union,
AFL-CIO.
The decision to strike came after
both sides reported no significant
progress in yesterday's negotiating
sessions.
USE also announced that it had
received strike sanction from
Teamsters Local 281 and the Santa
Clara and San Bernardino Building
Trades Council. Berk said that the
Teamsters local made most food and
dairy products deliveries to campus
and that the building trades union was
involved in all on-campus
construction.
Honor Picket Lines
USE has previously received
sanction from the San Mateo and
Santa Clara Central Labor Councils,
AFL-CIO.
All sanction-granting unions will
support the USE strike and honor USE
picket lines.
USE and University negotiating
teams will meet again today and are
tentatively scheduled to meet next
week.
Douglas Barton, University
negotiator, said that it could be "on
the order of weeks" before a
settlement was reached.
"We are very, very far apart. Some
of the issues are fundamental and are
not only economic by any means.
They will take some time to resolve,"
he said.
"It is so unusual to be at the table

so long and not have a single article
signed off. I don't know of many
other situations quite like this,"
Barton said.
USE and the University have been
engaged in contract negotiations since
December. USE won the right to
represent the bargaining unit in a
National Labor Relations Board
election in June 1973.
USE had implied that Barton has a
conflict of interest in the negotiations
since he was a hearing officer for the
NLRB and heard initial petitioners
asking to represent the bargaining unit.
Legal Advisor to the President
James Siena contacted the Daily last
night and said for USE to play up this
association was "a cheap and
ad hominem shot.
"I'm indignant as hell. There are a
lot of serious issues to resolve and to
play on cheap issues like this is a really
low form of behavior," Siena said.
No Relation
"The role Barton played in the past
has no relation to what is currently
going on," he said.
Both Berk and Barton appeared last
night before a special session of the
ASSU Senate and spoke on their
respective bargaining portions.
About 150 people in the physics
tank listened as Barton outlined the
major areas of disagreement between
the two sides.
Among economic issues in
contention were the union demands
for a cost-of-living escalator, a $600
minimum pay rate, and a community
standards wage hike.
USE is seeking economic gains of
nearly 23 percent, about a $3 million
increase of the bargaining unit's
present, wage base.
Other Proposals
The University has responded with
a proposed seven percent average
increase.
Non-economic proposals include a
union shop, maintenance of standards
clause and a revised layoff procedure.
Barton said that the Universit> had
compromised to some extent at
