# 'We Are Going To Strike USE President Declares

### DON COX 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
will strike midnight Sunday, USE
President Jim Berk announced
yesterday afternoon.
"We did not receive a reasonable
response to our demands. There is no
question, we're going to strike," Berk
said.
"The University doesn't know how
to go about a strike and they are going
to hurt and when they hurt enough,
they will see clear to pay us the
money," he said.
The union represents 1400
technical, service and maintenance
employees as Local 680 of the Service
Employees International Union,
AFL-CIO.
The decision to strike came after
both sides reported no significant
progress in yesterday's negotiating
sessions.
USE also announced that it had
received strike sanction from
Teamsters Local 281 and the Santa
Clara and San Bernardino Building
Trades Council. Berk said that the
Teamsters local made most food and
dairy products deliveries to campus
and that the building trades union was
involved in all on-campus
construction.
Honor Picket Lines
USE has previously received
sanction from the San Mateo and
Santa Clara Central Labor Councils,
AFL-CIO.
All sanction-granting unions will
support the USE strike and honor USE
picket lines.
USE and University negotiating
teams will meet again today and are
tentatively scheduled to meet next
week.
Douglas Barton, University
negotiator, said that it could be "on
the order of weeks" before a
settlement was reached.
"We are very, very far apart. Some
of the issues are fundamental and are
not only economic by any means.
They will take some time to resolve,"
he said.
"It is so unusual to be at the table

so long and not have a single article
signed off. I don't know of many
other situations quite like this,"
Barton said.
USE and the University have been
engaged in contract negotiations since
December. USE won the right to
represent the bargaining unit in a
National Labor Relations Board
election in June 1973.
USE had implied that Barton has a
conflict of interest in the negotiations
since he was a hearing officer for the
NLRB and heard initial petitioners
asking to represent the bargaining unit.
Legal Advisor to the President
James Siena contacted the Daily last
night and said for USE to play up this
association was "a cheap and
ad hominem shot.
"I'm indignant as hell. There are a
lot of serious issues to resolve and to
play on cheap issues like this is a really
low form of behavior," Siena said.
No Relation
"The role Barton played in the past
has no relation to what is currently
going on," he said.
Both Berk and Barton appeared last
night before a special session of the
ASSU Senate and spoke on their
respective bargaining portions.
About 150 people in the physics
tank listened as Barton outlined the
major areas of disagreement between
the two sides.
Among economic issues in
contention were the union demands
for a cost-of-living escalator, a $600
minimum pay rate, and a community
standards wage hike.
USE is seeking economic gains of
nearly 23 percent, about a $3 million
increase of the bargaining unit's
present, wage base.
Other Proposals
The University has responded with
a proposed seven percent average
increase.
Non-economic proposals include a
union shop, maintenance of standards
clause and a revised layoff procedure.
Barton said that the Universit> had
compromised to some extent at
hashers who receive board in return
for their work.
Malik warned students who decide
not to work, "You will be billed if you
have the label on and you eat."
One Wilbur hasher predicted that
"about half to two-thirds [of the
hashers] won't come in."
"Sure we have a commitment to
the students," the hasher said, "but we
have to work with the people (USE
members] in there too."
Other hashers said they felt uneasy
about crossing a picket line, and most
still seemed unsure whether or not
they will report for work.
Expressing optimism that Wilbur
and Stern could process all 3000
students who have meal plans, Scoles
said, "All it takes is one complete
turnover in Wilbur and Stern to
accommodate everybody."
"It will be a hard job to get the
food out three meals a day,"he
admitted. "We are not offering
multiple entrees like we normally do,

but there will be hot food at every
meal."
If student hashers honor the
anticipated USE pickets and refuse tt
work, Scoles said, "We could be in
trouble."
However, he noted, "There are
volunteers available â€” other students
who would be willing to fill in."
A strike could force salary raises
that would increase student food
prices, Scoles stated. But ht
emphasized that there is no plan at the
current time to re-examine board
charges. If the strike only lasted a
short time, it would not be worthwhile
to readjust next year's proposed
charges, he said.
The only way the Food Servicr
could be severely harmed by the strike
would be if it were forced to close
down temporarily, Scoles said, noting
that such a closure is unlikely.
