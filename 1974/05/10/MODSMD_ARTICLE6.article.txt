# Coalition Seeks One-Day Strike Of Students, Faculty

The Student-Faculty Strike
Coalition, a loosely knit group of 200
persons, voted yesterday to hold a
one-day "work-stoppage" Tuesday in
support of the apparently upcoming
strike by the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union.
Meeting in Tresidder Union at
noon, the group — mostly graduate
students — also called for a
strike-related teach-in on Monday and
supported a resolution urging all

students to honor USE picket lines.
The Coalition also established a
coordinating committee to implement
their resolutions.
The graduate students who
organized the meeting invited both the
University administration and USE to
send spokesmen, but only USE was
represented. The University's chief
negotiator, Doug Barton, did not
appear but invited all interested
persons to hear his position at last
night's open ASSU Senate meeting.
Roland Finston, a member of
USE's Executive Committee, told the
group, "We would certainly appreciate
your refusing to do the work you
usually do, if only out of respect for
the philosophy of the strike."
Both Finston and USE lawyer Tom
Burk urged the graduate students to
seriously consider striking over their
own grievances, but the Coalition
stopped short of supporting more than
a sympathy strike for graduate student
teaching assistants.
"The University is looking at
graduate students to see where their
heads are at," said Finston. "Until you
act as a unit and decide on your own
pay demands, the administration
won't take you very seriously."
Those present at the meeting
included members of such groups as
the Stanford Union of Research
Physicists, the Union of Radical
Political Economists, and the
Committee of Concerned Asian
Scholars, as well as several of the
German studies graduate students who
organized Wednesday's TA walkout.
Finston promised that USE's
eventual contract settlement would
insure that no University employee,
union member or not, would lose his
job because of participation in the
strike.
"The union's position is that all the
workers who went on strike together
will go back to work together," he
said, "and that includes all students
who work for pay."
Members of the newly formed
coalition supported each of the three
resolutions by overwhelming margins,
although there was less support for the
work-stoppage measure than for the
others.
