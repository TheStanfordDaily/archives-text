## Thomas V. Jones 
### 
We believe that Thomas V. Jones should resign from the
Stanford Board of Trustees.
Jones, chairman and chief executive officer of Northrop
Corp. pleaded guilty last week to criminal charges that he
illegally used corporate funds for contributions to President
Nixon's re-election campaign.
We think that a convicted criminal who offers no valid
moral grounds for breaking the law has no place on the
governing board of this University.
Jones kept his illegal contributions hidden until they
were uncovered by the Watergate Special Prosecutor's office,
and he presented no moral justification for breaking the law.
If one of the purposes of this University is to encourage
integrity and leadership in its students, then Jones' actions
should immediately disqualify him from such an important
position of influence over those students.
Under these circumstances, it seems to us that Jones
would best serve Stanford by resigning as soon as possible,
thereby avoiding protracted discussion of the issue.
However, if he chooses not to resign, we urge the Board
to take whatever steps it can to remove him from the Board.
We realize that this may seem to be a harsh position. But
we feel that anyone in a position of leadership in this
University must display a solid record of honesty and
integrity. Jones has obviously failed this test.
