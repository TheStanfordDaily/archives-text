Don't Support USE
Editor:
I urge students not to support
the imminent USE strike. USE,
being new on campus, is ready to
flex its muscles; that is, to
establish a dominance over the
University. Recognize that $600 a
month minimum wage for
unskilled labor is unreasonable;
$500 a month is a generous
minimum outside Stanford.
Also, USE is asking for
considerable expensive benefits.
USE says that it will be the
University's problem to raise the
three million dollars extra for the
new contract. We should not be
surprised if we students receive
this price increase in our tuition
next year. We would then each
pay about $270 per year extra.
Probably everyone would like to
give USE workers a raise, but can
we afford it?

Brandt Resignation
Editor:
Yesterday, I read about Willy
Brandt's resignation in the wake
of a scandal in which it was
discovered that one of Brandt's
aides was a Communist spy. A
close friend of Brandt's said
concerning the resignation,"He
felt that to ask for the resignation
of one or two ministers to blame
them for the spy affair would
have been cowardly and
dishonest, and he wanted at least
to save the honor of his party and
show there was still one leader of
integrity in the Western world."
The last part of his remark was
an obvious comment on Nixon's
refusal to resign in light of our
Watergate that makes Germany's
spy scandal seem like small
potatoes. Nixon tenaciously holds
on to his office not for the sake of
the country or even, like Brandt,
for the sake of his party, but for
the sake of a vague abstraction
called "the presidency."
As Nixon's obstinate refusals
to obey the judicial laws continue,

that abstraction becomes more
and more of a meaningless void to
the increasingly disillusioned
people of the United States.
If Nixon were a "leader of
integrity" like Brandt, perhaps he
might realize that "the
presidency" has lost its meaning
because the man who occupies
that office is no longer concerned
with carrying through its
definition — to lead the people.
Vm one of the people and I'm sick
of living in a leader-less nation. It
is time that Nixon learns what
"the presidency" really means —
and resign for the sake of his
country.

Campaign And Housing
Editor:
In the Daily of May 2, I read
with great interest the letter from
Mark Zellinger, inquiring about
the current Campaign for
Stanford and its relevance to
additional on-campus housing.
Mark was asking whether any of
the $300 million dollars raised in
the Campaign will be earmarked
for the building of new
dormitories, etc.
In that I am a graduate
student, also concerned with
campus housing, and an intern in
the General Secretary's Office, I
thought it appropriate to openly
respond to this inquiry.
In the original Campaign plan,
set forth by the Board of Trustees
in 1971, three million dollars were
set as the gift objective for
student residences and facilities.
This amount was not restricted
for use in the future. That is, this
money not only can be used for
the construction of new residence
facilities, but also for the
renovation and modification of
existing buildings.
Therefore, I would say in
closing that indeed the current
Campaign is concerned with
student residences. I would like to
thank Mark for asking this most
relevant question.

student residences and facilities.
This amount was not restricted
for use in the future. That is, this
money not only can be used for
the construction of new residence
facilities, but also for the
renovation and modification of
existing buildings.
Therefore, I would say in
closing that indeed the current
Campaign is concerned with
student residences. I would like to
thank Mark for asking this most
relevant question.

Don't Support USE
Editor:
I urge students not to support
the imminent USE strike. USE,
being new on campus, is ready to
flex its muscles; that is, to
establish a dominance over the
University. Recognize that $600 a
month minimum wage for
unskilled labor is unreasonable;
$500 a month is a generous
minimum outside Stanford.
Also, USE is asking for
considerable expensive benefits.
USE says that it will be the
University's problem to raise the
three million dollars extra for the
new contract. We should not be
surprised if we students receive
this price increase in our tuition
next year. We would then each
pay about $270 per year extra.
Probably everyone would like to
give USE workers a raise, but can
we afford it?

Brandt Resignation
Editor:
Yesterday, I read about Willy
Brandt's resignation in the wake
of a scandal in which it was
discovered that one of Brandt's
aides was a Communist spy. A
close friend of Brandt's said
concerning the resignation,"He
felt that to ask for the resignation
of one or two ministers to blame
them for the spy affair would
have been cowardly and
dishonest, and he wanted at least
to save the honor of his party and
show there was still one leader of
integrity in the Western world."
The last part of his remark was
an obvious comment on Nixon's
refusal to resign in light of our
Watergate that makes Germany's
spy scandal seem like small
potatoes. Nixon tenaciously holds
on to his office not for the sake of
the country or even, like Brandt,
for the sake of his party, but for
the sake of a vague abstraction
called "the presidency."
As Nixon's obstinate refusals
to obey the judicial laws continue,

that abstraction becomes more
and more of a meaningless void to
the increasingly disillusioned
people of the United States.
If Nixon were a "leader of
integrity" like Brandt, perhaps he
might realize that "the
presidency" has lost its meaning
because the man who occupies
that office is no longer concerned
with carrying through its
definition — to lead the people.
Vm one of the people and I'm sick
of living in a leader-less nation. It
is time that Nixon learns what
"the presidency" really means —
and resign for the sake of his
country.

Campaign And Housing
Editor:
In the Daily of May 2, I read
with great interest the letter from
Mark Zellinger, inquiring about
the current Campaign for
Stanford and its relevance to
additional on-campus housing.
Mark was asking whether any of
the $300 million dollars raised in
the Campaign will be earmarked
for the building of new
dormitories, etc.
In that I am a graduate
student, also concerned with
campus housing, and an intern in
the General Secretary's Office, I
thought it appropriate to openly
respond to this inquiry.
In the original Campaign plan,
set forth by the Board of Trustees
in 1971, three million dollars were
set as the gift objective for
student residences and facilities.
This amount was not restricted
for use in the future. That is, this
money not only can be used for
the construction of new residence
facilities, but also for the
renovation and modification of
existing buildings.
