# Strike: Workers Walk Off Jobs
## Picket Steam Plant 
### DON COX 
Technical, maintenance, and service
workers walked off their jobs at
midnight plunging Stanford into its
first major labor strike.
The walk-out, climaxed five months
of negotiations which failed to
produce a contract settlement between
the union and the University.
The 1400 members of the
bargaining unit are represented by the
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union. Pickets were posted outside the
steam plant at midnight. Area strike
organizer Ted Samora said that the
picket line at the steam plant would
remain in place all night.
Samora predicted that the
supervisory personnel managing the
steam plant would be unable to keep
the plant operational.
Computer operators walked off
their jobs Friday at midnight.
Supervisory personnel manning the
computation center said yesterday
operations were normal.
More Pickets
A USE spokesman confirmed that
picket lines would probably be posted
at 6 a.m. today at the steam plant, the
Medical Center, SLAC, Plant Services
and other unspecified locations.
The University will maintain strike
operations center in Building M-l,
telephone 497-1024, to answer
questions and monitor the
effectiveness of service operations.
USE will similarly maintain a strike
headquarters at 1010 Doyle St., Menlo
Park, telephone 322-5393.
No Signigifant Progress
Union and University negotiating
teams met Friday and Saturday but
reported no significant progress.
Emerson Street of the Santa Clara
Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO, sat
in on the two sessions and told the
Daily that USE was "demonstrating its

responsibility by bringing in the local
council to help resolve the issues."
"A strike is the absolute step of last
resort and no responsible leadership
leads its membership out on strike
until all avenues have been tried,"
Street said.
Street added that he thought the
USE leadership was very responsible.
Barton
University negotiator Douglas
Barton said Saturday's negotiations
produced some progress on the
grievance procedure to be included in
the contract, but he noted the two
sides were still very far apart.
Barton said last week it could be
weeks before a settlement is reached.
USE is seeking economic gains of
23 percent while the University has
offered a seven percent increase.
USE's demands include a
cost-of-living escalator, $600 minimum
pay, community standards concept,
increased pension plan and added
medical plan coverage.
The union has received strike
sanction from the Santa Clara and San
Mateo Central Labor Councils,
AFL-CIO, Teamsters Locals, and the
local Building Trades Council union.
USE is Local 680 of the Service
Employees International Union.
Union officials met with student
groups over the weekend in an attempt
to win student support for the strike.
ASSU Sunday Flicks
Showings of the ASSU Sunday
Flicks were also preceded by a short
address by union supporters urging
community support for the strike.
Flick's manager Jeff Greenwald
explained that the union had agreed to
show the films and clean up afterwards
at no charge if they could address the
audience for a few minutes before
each showing of the film.
Greenwald explained that it would
have been impossible to show the
Flicks with the union out on strike
since no one would have cleaned up
the auditorium afterwards.
The Food Service has announced all
dining areas except Wilbur and Stern
will be closed by the strike.
Students living in Florence Moore,
Row houses and Stern will take their
meals in Stern.
Those living in Branner, Lagunita,
Roble, and Wilbur will eat in Wilbur.
Hours are: breakfast 7:15-9, lunch
11-1:30, all dinners 5-7, Saturday and
Sunday brunch 9-11:30.
Rebates are available on a weekly
basis for those choosing not to eat at

rebates for meals this week should go
to the Cashier's office on the ground
floor of the Old Union Monday or
Tuesday.

USE leadership was very responsible.
Barton
