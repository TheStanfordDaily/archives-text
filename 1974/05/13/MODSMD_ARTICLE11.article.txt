# USE's Strike: Return Of Unreason
##

Self-defeating tactics of confrontation
make a most unwelcome return to the
University today after four years of blessed
respite. United Stanford Employees (USE) is
on strike.
Students for a Democratic Society
veterans must be genuinely satisfied; their
vain hopes of the 60's for a workers alliance
have come true after all. Now the blue collars
are among those trying to shut down the
University.
Many students will join along, as they did
four years earlier, in an effort whose
underlying theme, if not goal, is the
evisceration of this University. Among these
ranks will be those whose education remains
a gift of an institution whose foundations
they mock and whose leaders they denounce
as swine.
And what are we all going to gain from
this latest attack on what one wall graffito
calls "the millions of dollars raked in by the
giant corporation Stanford"? Likely what we
did from our earlier bout with turmoil: less
education, polarized relationships,
institutionalized cynicism and a spited
face—sans nose.
The unreason of bygone years has
returned: witness USE's demands for a 25%
wage and benefits increase among a host of

grievances whose redress will cost millions of
dollars per year. Much of the money must
come from"the reserves" of rich, powerful
Stanford, USE leaders say. No matter that
Stanford's endowment is perilously low,
among the smallest of universities of its
stature in the nation.
The strike mentality again: we want it—we
demand it; we therefore must get it. No
matter what the cost. Ignore, distort the
effects. Integrate social movements (Third
World, La Huelga) into what is essentially a
selfish cause. Get the money and run—leave
the "robber barons" to initiate the inevitable
tuition increase that must follow. Screw the
students and get them to help you do it.
Stanford as a labor battle
ground . . . students showing solidarity for
"justice" by boycotting the mainspring of
human progress: knowledge. Swept toward
insanity again, the University community
must confront itself with two overriding
questions: What good may lie in refusing to
learn? Why a strike against the mind?
Logical answers are non-existent. Even if
USE's demands were reasonable, refusals to
attend classes would be a secondary boycott
of the most suspect nature. But the fact is
the union has not acted in such a way as to
deserve support.

Denials aside, USE wanted and needed
this strike. The union would accept no major
compromise in the substance nor procedure
of the negotiations, and in the last month has
spent a preponderant amount of time gearing
for a strike. The opportunity is for
power — power long denied those who
organized and run USE—and is one too great
to let moderation interfere.
Pay raises, many of which must be paid by
increases in students' room, board and
tuition rates, are demanded. An agency shop,
forcing all in the bargaining unit to at least
pay union fees as a condition of
employment, is USE's "compromise" target.
Such coercion is not only antithetical to the
freedom of an academic environment but
could be expanded to students' financial aid
jobs under the union's contract proposal.
At Thursday's ASSU Senate meeting, USE
President Jim Berk said, "I really can't
answer" what effect the union's demands, if
met, would have on tuition. "That's really
not our (USE) business." But support of the
USE requests is students' business. Such
backing is a virtual invitation to a rip-off of
students' savings and freedom come the end
of this unfortunate strike.
