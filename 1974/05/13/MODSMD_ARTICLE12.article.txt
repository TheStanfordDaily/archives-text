# Demos Ignorant Of Roth
## 
### 
Brian Aronstam

Undoubtedly, the Stanford
community is well aware of the
California gubernatorial campaign.
And probably most are aware
candidates Jerry Brown, Joe
Alioto, Ed Reinecke and Houston
Flournoy. But ask people about
Bill Roth, a Democratic
candidate, and one is likely to get
a quizzical reply.
Such a response is not '<
surprising, for Roth has not had
the "advantage" of holding a
publicity-laden public office. But
this ignorance need not continue.
For tomorrow at 3 p.m. in Bishop
Auditorium Roth himself will
help the voters get acquainted
with the candidate and his '
policies. And there is a lot to be
learned.
• Talks Of Experience
Bill Roth will talk about his
executive experience, his views on
current political issues, his plans ,
for the future. He'll talk about his
familiarity with the needs of
higher education (as a member of
the University of California Board
of Regents Roth has continually
pushed for equal opportunities in
financial aid).
Affirmed Demo Ties
Roth will describe his affirmed
Democratic ties, having been;
involved in campaigns dating back '
to Helen Gahagan Douglass. Most
especially. Bill Roth will assert his
unbending concern for
California—and his lack of further ,
political ambitions.
But there is a lot more to learn
about Bill Roth. Don't let this
campaign slip by without a full
examination of the candidates.
Don't let Bill Roth go away from
Stanford unanswered.
