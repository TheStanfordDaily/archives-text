USE's Empty Grievance
Editor:
One of the many meaningless
defenses of USE which have
deluged the Stanford community
in recent days is to be found in
the Hofmeister/Brady column
(Daily, May 9). They state:
"[University workers] are lower
paid and have less benefits than
workers with comparable jobs in
the area."
If the above merely asserts that
Stanford does not exceed all other
institutions in employee
munificence, it is as
incontrovertible as it is empty.
Granted, the level of pay here
is not unexcelled in the Bay Area.
According to USE's estimate
Stanford employees are only in
the 25th percentile for San
Francisco and environs. Although
at first this percentile-standing
alone may appear to be
justification for a strike, the
broader picture must be
considered.
If all those beneath the 25th
percentile demand and receive
median wages, those who
formerly were in the 25th-50th
percentiles would then find
themselves in the position where
they too must strike. The result
would be a perpetual walkout by
one-quarter of the work force.
Even presuming such a state to
be less than inherently
undesirable, it would have no use
on the pragmatic level. The
country's current nightmare of
cost-push inflation evaporates all
wage increases by raising prices
concomitantly. The net gain is a
weakened financial position for
the U.S. and an unaffected real
salary for the "victorious"
worker.
Therefore, instead of looking
at the relative benefits of
Stanford, USE should detail their
hardship in surviving in this
society on their present wages.
Stanford working conditions
should be shown to be at least as
evil as Patricia Nash has shown
them to be benign, in her
as-yet-unrebutted column (Daily,
May 2).
If USE members have
grievances less petty than an
inability to keep up with the

Smiths, let them so state. If not,
let them either vie for a higher
living on the open market, or
accept the current conditions of
employment at Stanford.

Help The 'Cause'
Editor:
I've heard comments and read
letters voicing opinions that the
union strike is unnecessary due to
already "good" wages and
benefits.
I work for the Stanford Center
for Information Processing (SCIP)
in the keypunch section. Our crew
works two shifts a day, five days a
week. It seems few people realize
how much work we do. If it
wasn't for us, no one would get
paid, no grades would be
recorded, students couldn't
register, etc. Few people realize
how important our job is — yet
our salary is ridiculously low.
The starting salary for a
keypunch operator, no matter
how much experience, is $494 a
month. This is very low compared
to wages of cities and private
companies. Stanford has a
difficult time getting qualified
people to work in this
department. Is it any wonder
why?
I have been at Stanford for 10
months and have yet to receive a
six-month salary review increase,
or any other increase for that
matter. Other employees in this
department have been here over
ten years and haven't even been
promoted past the first level of
their pay scale. This is unfair to all
of us. We only want what other
employees on campus already
have — a fair salary.
I urge everyone to help union
members in their cause by letting
Stanford know that there is a
cause.

Students 'USEd?
Editor:
We applaud the strike of the
worker/student alliance on behalf
of the oppressed classes of
Stanford University. We've

noticed, though, that in the
negotiating sessions, USE has
failed to demand that the
University not raise tuition to pay
for the new higher-priced
contract. Surely this is an
oversight, and a most unfortunate
one. Some students we've talked
to have the distinct impression
they're being USEd.

Graduate Stipends
Editor:
I enclose for publication a
copy of a letter I have just sent
Dean Lincoln Moses, in response
to his article (Daily, May 6).
"Dear Dean Moses:
I was pleased to see your
explanation of stipends for
graduate students, which appeared
in yesterday's Daily. Specifically,
I found interesting your statement
that we give them | teaching
assistants] $2100 in the years
they do not teach .. .
Due no doubt to some sort of
clerical error, I and several of my
classmates in economics did not
receive this $2100 for the
1973-74 academic year. All of us
will be teaching or research
assistants in upcoming years (I
expect to TA in 1975-76), so are
clearly entitled to the money,
according to your article.
I look forward to receiving
soon Stanford's check for $2100,
less withholding taxes.
Once again, thanks for bringing
this oversight to my attention."

Lagunita Overcrowded
Editor:
I would like to correct two
misconceptions presented by
David Roode in his letter (Daily,
May 9). First, Lagunita Court
residents were never "exempted"
from the housing draw but were
actually only partially shielded
from it by the Lagunita
Overcrowding Option. That this
practice was "unfair" is not at all
clear, but as Mr. Roode stated it

has been discontinued. Second, it
is certainly not true that "the
additional capacity of Lagunita
dormitory has been proven."
There is no additional capacity
that can be made to magically
appear, for Lagunita already has
many more residents than it was
designed for. The number of
residents this year is the largest of
any in recent years, and the
deleterious effects of this

overcrowding have been I
oppressive to both students and
administrators of Lagunita Court.
I agree with Mr. Roode that
action should be taken
immediately to alleviate the
housing shortage, but the proper
action consists of providing
additional facilities, no£
overcrowding present ones.
