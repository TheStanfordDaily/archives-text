# Prop. 9 Reforms

So long as there are venal
people in politics, it will probably
be impossible to eliminate
corruption in government. But we
can eliminate the conditions
which allow corruption to
flourish.
That is the main goal this year
of Common Cause (CC), the
citizen's lobby. Across the
country, CC is sponsoring political
reform initiatives designed to
toughen state laws governing the
two best friends of the
corrupt—secrecy and money.
In California, CC is sponsoring
Proposition 9 on the June primary
ballot. Prop. 9 is an extremely
detailed measure—as loophole-free
as the CC legislative analysts could
make it. To fully enumerate all its
provisions here is impossible. But,
in sum, Prop. 9:
1.) requires full disclosure of
all campaign contributions of at
least $50. These reports will be
audited and published periodically
during campaigns.
2.) puts spending limits on
statewide campaigns. The ceilings,
not-so-incidentally, are 10% lower
for all incumbents. This is one of
many provisions in the measure
which are aimed at giving
challengers a decent chance to
win.
3.) mandates personal
conflict-of-interest disclosure by
candidates as well as by persons in
sensitive appointive policy-making
positions. In addition, the
measure establishes guidelines

telling officials when they ought
to disqualify themselves from
voting on a bill.
4.) severely limits the
influence-peddling of lobbyists,
and provides for complete
disclosure and auditing of their
expenditures.
5.) eliminates two traditional
advantages of incumbency, by
eliminating the franking privilege
during campaigns and by
providing for random ordering of
candidates on ballots. (At present,
incumbents are listed first on the
ballot. This is generally
acknowledged to increase their
vote received by 5%.)
6.) establishes an independent,
bi-partisan commission to oversee
administration of, and conduct
investigations under the law.
7.) provides for stiff penalties,
criminal and civil, to violators.
One might think Prop. 9 would
be unopposed. Not so. The
ALF-ClO labor bosses and the
political public relations firm
Whittaker and Baxter are
determined to see it defeated, and
arc spending enormous sums to
saturate the media with slick "No
on 9" commercials.
The only way this campaign of
deception can be neutralized is
through effective grassroots
organization. If you would like to
be part of the effort to cleanse the
political process in California, call
