# Food Institute Studies World Economy Crisis

### CECILE HEROLD 
For two years, sudden price
boosts on meat, dairy, produce
and cereal products have affected
consumer food bills with a harsh
consistency. In Tokyo, $8 buys a
pound of only an inexpensive
grade of meat. In North Africa,
there is hardly enough food for
mere subsistence no matter what
the price.
Walter P. Falcon, Director of
Stanford's Food Research
Institute, has completed a number
of studies which pinpoint some of
the causes of our present food
dilemma. Formerly with the
Harvard Center for International
Affairs, and a consultant with
numerous development agencies,
Falcon stated, "Many problems
can be traced to the year 1972-73.
In all, it was a disasterous crop
year. Up until that time, food
production had been on the
increase, but that year the grain
crop fell 40 million metric tons.
Monsoon rains in South Asia,
combined with hurricanes in the
Philippines, destroyed rice crops
severely. Then, the anchovy catch
off the coast of Peru failed, due to
water temperature changes."
Falcon explained that anchovy
meal is a prime ingredient of
poultry and livestock feed
although soybean oil and meal can
be used as a substitute. "With the
anchovy shortage," he said,
"supply and demand caused
soybean prices to rise
considerably."
The 1972-1973 year was a hard
hitting one in other
respects, Falcon said,
because while the food supply
decreased, the demand for food
increased. "Foreign economies at
that time were buoyant. With the
devaluation of the U.S. dollar,
exports abroad became relatively

cheaper. Japan and many
European countries made a strong
bid for United States crops. This
resulted in a drop in U.S. food
reserves and our strict control of
exports."
High Fertilizer Prices
"The difficulties stemming
from the unbalanced supply and
demand situation were
compounded by high commodity
prices for nitrogen fertilizer,"
Falcon continued. "The big,
poorer countries were
immediately affected. The price
boost was related in part to the
energy crisis and in part to a
decline of investments in the
fertilizer industry since the mid
60's. At that time, there was a
notable surplus of the product."
Falcon reacts strongly to such
"overstatements" of prophesized
doom like those of the American
Bread Bakers Association whose
president sees dollar-a-loaf prices
by the end of this year. "True,"
he said, "there are grave problems
of food in the world. But, given
that the South Asia monsoon
behaves and we don't have a
drought in the U.S., it is
conceivable America could rebuild
her food surplus by 1976."
Falcon noted, however, that
the rebuilding of a U.S. food
surplus could not possibly remove
the world's food problems.
"There is a necessity for rapid
agricultural development to occur
internationally. Most food will
have to be produced domestically
by each country."

boost was related in part to the
energy crisis and in part to a
decline of investments in the
fertilizer industry since the mid
60's. At that time, there was a
notable surplus of the product."
Falcon reacts strongly to such
"overstatements" of prophesized
doom like those of the American
Bread Bakers Association whose
president sees dollar-a-loaf prices
by the end of this year. "True,"
he said, "there are grave problems
of food in the world. But, given
that the South Asia monsoon
behaves and we don't have a
drought in the U.S., it is
conceivable America could rebuild
her food surplus by 1976."
Falcon noted, however, that
the rebuilding of a U.S. food
surplus could not possibly remove
the world's food problems.
"There is a necessity for rapid
agricultural development to occur
internationally. Most food will
have to be produced domestically
by each country."
For two years, sudden price
boosts on meat, dairy, produce
and cereal products have affected
consumer food bills with a harsh
consistency. In Tokyo, $8 buys a
pound of only an inexpensive
grade of meat. In North Africa,
there is hardly enough food for
mere subsistence no matter what
the price.
Walter P. Falcon, Director of
Stanford's Food Research
Institute, has completed a number
of studies which pinpoint some of
the causes of our present food
dilemma. Formerly with the
Harvard Center for International
Affairs, and a consultant with
numerous development agencies,
Falcon stated, "Many problems
can be traced to the year 1972-73.
In all, it was a disasterous crop
year. Up until that time, food
production had been on the
increase, but that year the grain
crop fell 40 million metric tons.
Monsoon rains in South Asia,
combined with hurricanes in the
Philippines, destroyed rice crops
severely. Then, the anchovy catch
off the coast of Peru failed, due to
water temperature changes."
Falcon explained that anchovy
meal is a prime ingredient of
poultry and livestock feed
although soybean oil and meal can
be used as a substitute. "With the
anchovy shortage," he said,
"supply and demand caused
soybean prices to rise
considerably."
The 1972-1973 year was a hard
hitting one in other
respects, Falcon said,
because while the food supply
decreased, the demand for food
increased. "Foreign economies at
that time were buoyant. With the
devaluation of the U.S. dollar,
exports abroad became relatively

cheaper. Japan and many
European countries made a strong
bid for United States crops. This
resulted in a drop in U.S. food
reserves and our strict control of
exports."
High Fertilizer Prices
"The difficulties stemming
from the unbalanced supply and
demand situation were
compounded by high commodity
prices for nitrogen fertilizer,"
Falcon continued. "The big,
poorer countries were
immediately affected. The price
boost was related in part to the
energy crisis and in part to a
decline of investments in the
fertilizer industry since the mid
60's. At that time, there was a
notable surplus of the product."
