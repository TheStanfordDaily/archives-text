# Rosenhan Discusses Mental Treatment
## 'Ignorance' Plaguing Psychiatric Work 
### DEBBIE MITCHELL 
Psychology Prof. David
Rosenhan said Thursday the
psychiatric profession is marked
by a "deep" ignorance in the
treatment of mental patients, an
ignorance which most
psychiatrists are not willing to
admit.
Speaking to 25 people in one
of the Spring Colloquium series
lectures at the Sociology
Department, Rosenhan said
failure to admit this naivete
"perpetuates a farce and
terminates a search" for a more
precise understanding of
psychiatric problems.
This ignorance is particularly
manifest in the procedures and
practices employed in mental

hospitals, he said.
As an alternative to these
"mortification rituals," Rosenhan
suggested a kind of state
subsidized "hotel" with an open
atmosphere where disturbed
people can come for counseling.
"The state is hot to close down
psychiatric hospitals," he said.
Alternatives are needed and
"that's the best I've come up
with," Rosenhan said.
Experiment
In order to observe the
practices in the mental hospitals,
Rosenhan gained admittance to
unsuspecting mental institutions
as a pseudo-patient.
Drawing on the findings of this
experiment, Rosenhan remarked
that "much of the ruckus is

focused in diagnostic problems."
Nearly all the pseudo-patients in
Rosenhan's test group, including
himelf, were incorrectly diagnosed
as paranoid schizophrenic.
"I maintained schizophrenic
symptoms for 36 hours." Then "I.
began to behave as I ordinarily
behave .. . Nobody noticed" the
change in behavior. "One didn't
need schizophrenic symptoms" to
be diagnosed as schizophrenic.
"If you want to know what
psychiatric patients are like, check
in," Rosenhan said.
Rosenhan, previously
employed as a staff member in

mental hospitals, said the
institution was "entirely different
from the patient's perspective."
The anguish a psychiatric
patient feels "is not mythical; the
anguish is real," Rosenhan said. A
patient's behavior is often
misattributed to his "madness"
when, in fact, it is sometimes
caused by the uncomfortable and
insensitive personnel in the
hospitals themselves, he said.
De-Individuation
The reception room, where
prospective mental patients are
first interviewed, is an example of
the "de-individuation" that goes

on in hospitals, Rosenhan said.
The average "reception room is
a cold, green-tiled place. You
come up to the receptionist as if
you are cashing a check in a bank.
Already you're being led into a
ritual where whatever is hurting
you is being put aside," he said.
"Craziness is a fairly rare
event," Rosenhan concluded. A
schizophrenic individual actually
exibits "crazy" behavior "less
than one percent of the time."
Rosenhan said, however, that
"we need crazy people" because
"without them, how would we
know we were sane?"
