# Student Survey Indicates Half Opposes USE Strike
## 
### BOB LOWE 
More than half of Stanford's
undergraduates oppose today's United
Stanford Employees (USE) strike,
according to a Daily survey conducted
last week. The study also shows that
student support for the strike will
drop if it affects classes.
The survey polled almost 300
students in dormitories, Manzanita
Park and row houses.
Each student received a
questionnaire containing descriptions
of the main USE wage demands and
the financial impact upon the
University. The questionnaire then
asked the students about their support
and knowledge of the strike.
The information in all
questionnaires was identical, but
questions varied. Some students were
asked to imagine a strike affecting
only custodial and maintenance work.
Others were given a situation in
which the University Food Service also
was stopped. A third group imagined
that classes closed, along with the
other effects of a strike. When asked,
"Would you support the strike?"
under the given conditions, students
responded as follows: custodial only:
yes-46 percent, no-54 percent;
custodial and food: yes-49 percent,
no-51 percent; custodial, food, classes:

yes-41 percent, no-59 percent.
In all of the situations described by
the questionnaires, Manzanita Park
residents supported the strike more
than students in dorms. When the
curtailment of food service was added
to the custodial and maintenance cut
backs, Manzanita Park residents'
support increased. This more than
compensated for declining support in
the dorms.
The survey also revealed that most
students were poorly informed about
the strike and USE negotiations. Only
eight percent considered themselves
"well informed" or "very well
informed." 60 percent said they were
"ignorant" or "poorly informed."
Most students indicated that USE
was partially justified in wanting
higher wages for its members.
However, many cited increases in
tuition as an important consideration.
"I find it hard to sympathize with
something that will raise my
expenses," said one student who did
not support the strike. "This is a rat
race, brother, and we're all racing for
the cheese," he added. A student who
supported the strike wrote, "A $3
million increase divided by 10,000
students equals a $300 tuition
increase—l'm sure this is going through
everyone's mind."
