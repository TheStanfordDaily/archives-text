# Daytime-The Festival Livens White Plaza, And... Night--The Carnival Brightens Wilbur-Stern Fields
## 
### 
Craft booths, jugglers and "organic" food in the
afternoons turned into dart booths, hucksters and
corn dogs in the evenings.
The Spring Festival and Carnival both took place
this weekend. The Festival, which benefits the
Bridge, and the Carnival, which benefits the African
Relief Fund, both ended up their stays here as big
succcsses.
From 10-6 during the day, Stanford students
and area citizens walked through White Plaza
looking at all types of handmade goods, or stopping
to take in one of the many acts that entertained
everyone.
For most of the night, the "carny" people were
busy enticing students to throw dimes onto trays,
throw rings over blocks, or just have a good time on
the Zipper, a Ferris Wheel take-off for
sadomasochists.
Both events seemed to please just about
everybody. As at least one Stanford student
commented about the campus, "I wish this place
was like this every weekend."
