# Thai To Teach Urbanisation
## 
### 
The Anthropology Department voted
unanimously last week to authorize Prof. Robert B.
Textor to set up a course to be instructed by
Ngugen Huu Thai and Textor.
Thai, a Vietnamese scholar and journalist, was
long imprisoned by the Thieu regime. He was
released last month after ASSU voted funds to hire
him as a guest professor.
Textor said the course would be entitled
"Urbanization and Culture Change in Vietnam"
although he emphasized that the nature of the
course could be changed.
"Thai has gone as high in the Vietnamese
academic structure as one can go," Textor stated.

"He has a genuine intellectual interest in
urbanization. "He could teach Stanford students
much about how war uproots societies."
Textor said that Stanford should "use this
fellow as a resource." The University should
channel his talents into educational programs on
campus to "expose Stanford students to his
valuable perspectives," Textor commented.
Although Textor noted that Thai is not an
anthropologist, he insisted that his knowledge
would be of use to the department.
Thai is still in South Vietnam, and the
government refuses to grant him a visa, Textor
stated. "The big hurdle is getting him out of the
country."
