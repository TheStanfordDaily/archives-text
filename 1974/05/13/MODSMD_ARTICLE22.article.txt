# Increase Forthcoming
## Hospital Prices Rising 
### 
Prices at Stanford Hospital
have been increased nine percent,
and another price increase may be
forthcoming next month,
according to Hospital director
Paul B. Hofmann. The higher
room rates and prices for ancillary
services such as lab tests, drugs,
and x-rays, became effective May
1.
Another price increase is being
considered, Hofmann said. The
decision depends on the outcome
of the budget review, he said,
which will be finished in four
weeks.
Hofmann said the nine-percent
price increase "is an effort to
recover costs we've already
incurred this year due to inflation
in the prices of food, utilities,
linen, and medical supplies, as
well as merit raises for
employees." The prices were also
raised in anticipation of future

cost increases, Hofmann said. He
estimated that 20 percent of the
price increase is a hedge against
future inflation, while the
remaining 80 percent is based on
costs previously incurred. For
community patients, the daily
room rates are now $87.50 for
medical and surgical wards.
Semi-private rooms are $95.00
and private rooms $107.00.
Hofmann said the prices
"compare favorably" with other
university teaching hospitals. For
example, semi-private rooms at
the University of San Francisco
Medical Center are $107.00, and
private rooms are $109.00.
It is more expensive to stay at
Stanford University Hospital than
a local community hospital,
Hofmann said, Rooms at Sequoia
and El Camino Hospitals are
about $15 less expensive, he said.
