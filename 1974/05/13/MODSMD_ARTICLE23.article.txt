# Students Establish Levine Fund
## 
### THOMAS CREMA 
A memorial fund honoring the
late David S. Levine, 19-year-old
physics major whose death in the
campus stabbing last fall is still
unsolved, has been established by
his fellow students.
Prof. Arthur L. Schawlow,
acting chairman of the Physics
Department, announced the
creation of the fund at a physics
colloquium last week.
John P. Wikswo, graduate
student in physics, and George F.
Schnurle, co-terminal electrical
engineering major, students with
whom Levine was working on a
physics project at the time of his
death, are the principal organizers
of the fund.
A fund-raising committee for
the David Sidney Levine Award
has been formed by faculty and
students of the Physics
Department with Wikswo as
chairman, and Prof. Schawlow
and Schnurle as members.
Other members are Physics
Prof. William M. Fairbank and
physics students Mark C. Leifer
and James M. Lockhart.

Several donations have already
been made to the fund, including
a generous gift from Levine's
parents.
Wikswo said future gifts may
be addressed to the David S.
Levine Memorial Fund in care of
the General Secretary's Office
here.
The financial award will be
granted annually for
"outstanding undergraduate
scholarship in physics," and will
be "consistent with University
policy" concerning financial need,
Wikswo said.
A plaque will be displayed in
the lobby of the Physics
Department in memory of Levine
and in honor of the recipients of
the annual award.
The research project on which
Levine had been working was
directed by Prof. Fairbank and
involved collaboration between
faculty physicists and heart
specialists of the Stanford Medical
Center. In addition to Levine's
outstanding achievements in the
field of physics, he was also an
exceptional history student and a

member of the ASSU Senate,
Wikswo said.
Wikswo explained that the
scholarship is a "small sum, yet
consistent with all that we feel."
In recognition of Levine's
contributions to the research last
. summer, the physics laboratory
containing the heart monitoring
project on which he had been

working has been designated the
David S. Levine Magne
toeardiology Laboratory.
Wikswo, who will be
completing his graduate work
within the next two years,
expressed that, he hopes to "leave
with the faith. that people here
will continue to think about
Dave."
