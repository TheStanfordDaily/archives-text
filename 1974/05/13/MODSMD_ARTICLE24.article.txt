# Cal Defeats Oarsmen
## 
### DAN PYNE 
About 28 crew shirts changed
hands at Belmont Shores
Saturday. Unfortunately, all of
them were red and white, as the
Stanford oarsmen dropped four
races to the University of
California.
In the "big race," the Cardinal
varsity fell behind early, trailed by
two lengths at the 1200 meter
mark, and finished 19 seconds
behind Cal. The Bears, who are
ranked as the best crew on the
West Coast after beating the
University of Washington earlier
this season, won in a fast time of
5:57.
The Stanford junior varsity
also fell back early and stayed
there; Cal won in 6:07 while the
Cards finished in 6:21.
After a shakey start, the Card
freshmen stayed with Cal for the
closest race of the day, trailing by
only a length at the halfway mark.
Like the other Stanford boats,
however, they could not close the
gap, and finished in a respectable
6:19. The winning time was 6:07.
The freshman boat had the best
chance of beating the Bears, but
Rick Tuttle, the frosh stroke,
summed it up well, saying, "we
tensed up."
In the four-man race, both Cal
boats beat Stanford's lone entry.
The winning time was 7:06, and
the Cards were 35 seconds behind
with a 7:41.

Actually, Stanford raced well
under the circumstances. The
Bears, said Cardinal coach Len
Sherr, are "the best crew on the
west coast," and he expects them
not only to beat Washington again
in the Western Sprints at British
Columbia next weekend, but wind
up second or third in the nation.
"We knew what to expect
[from Cal] ... they've got a
much stronger program. I really
expected our JV's to do better and
our varsity worse."
Sherr observed that Stanford
crew is still "paying the price" for
a couple of bad years, but added
that this year's team was better
than last year's, and next year's
team should be better than this
one. "We're still building."
The oarsmen close out their
season at the Western Sprints,
next weekend in Vancouver, B.C.
Sherr said the varsity will have to
race much better than they have
in the past to do well in the
sprints, but the JV and freshman
boats have a pretty good chance
of making it into the finals.

a couple of bad years, but added
that this year's team was better
than last year's, and next year's
team should be better than this
one. "We're still building."
The oarsmen close out their
season at the Western Sprints,
next weekend in Vancouver, B.C.
Sherr said the varsity will have to
race much better than they have
in the past to do well in the
sprints, but the JV and freshman
boats have a pretty good chance
of making it into the finals.
About 28 crew shirts changed
hands at Belmont Shores
Saturday. Unfortunately, all of
them were red and white, as the
Stanford oarsmen dropped four
races to the University of
California.
In the "big race," the Cardinal
varsity fell behind early, trailed by
two lengths at the 1200 meter
mark, and finished 19 seconds
behind Cal. The Bears, who are
ranked as the best crew on the
West Coast after beating the
University of Washington earlier
this season, won in a fast time of
5:57.
The Stanford junior varsity
also fell back early and stayed
there; Cal won in 6:07 while the
Cards finished in 6:21.
After a shakey start, the Card
freshmen stayed with Cal for the
closest race of the day, trailing by
only a length at the halfway mark.
Like the other Stanford boats,
however, they could not close the
gap, and finished in a respectable
6:19. The winning time was 6:07.
The freshman boat had the best
chance of beating the Bears, but
Rick Tuttle, the frosh stroke,
summed it up well, saying, "we
tensed up."
In the four-man race, both Cal
boats beat Stanford's lone entry.
The winning time was 7:06, and
the Cards were 35 seconds behind
with a 7:41.

Actually, Stanford raced well
under the circumstances. The
Bears, said Cardinal coach Len
Sherr, are "the best crew on the
west coast," and he expects them
not only to beat Washington again
in the Western Sprints at British
Columbia next weekend, but wind
up second or third in the nation.
"We knew what to expect
[from Cal] ... they've got a
much stronger program. I really
expected our JV's to do better and
our varsity worse."
Sherr observed that Stanford
crew is still "paying the price" for
a couple of bad years, but added
that this year's team was better
than last year's, and next year's
team should be better than this
one. "We're still building."
