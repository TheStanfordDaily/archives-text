# Three Cards Selected To College All-Stars
## 
### 
Three Stanford football players have been named to the
College All-Star squad that will face the World Champion
Miami Dolphins in the College All-Star game July 26 in
Chicago.
Time Magazine All-American Rod Garcia, the NCAA field
goal record holder, heads the list of Cards. Joining Garcia will
be punter Dave Ottmar, a 16th round pick of the Los Angeles
Rams and defensive back Randy Poltl, a 12th round pick of the
Minnesota Vikings.
Stanford football coach Jack Christiansen said, "I was very
happy that they got selected. We had a real good kicking game
with Rod and he really deserved it."
Ottmar's 41.5 punting average wasn't the best in the nation,
but Chris wasn't surprised at his selection. "John McKay [the
coach of the All-Stars] had something to do with it. He was a
real fine punter for us. He can really place the ball. He came
on strong in the quarterback slot and won a couple of games
for us. He did a real fine job against California in the Big
Game."
"I think John (McKay] made a real good selection in
Ottmar," added Christiansen.
"Although Poltl wasn't drafted very high he'll be a fine pro
prospect," said Christiansen. "A lot of scouts thought he
didn't have the speed, but he'll fool a lot of people."
