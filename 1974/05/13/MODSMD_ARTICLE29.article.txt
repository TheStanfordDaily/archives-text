Basketball
MILWAUKEE - The Boston
Celtics, propelled by Dave
Cowens' outside shooting and a
relentless fast break, beat the
Milwaukee Bucks 102-87
yesterday to win the National
Basketball Association
championship.
Cowens fired in 28 points for
the Celtics, who needed the
maximum seven games in the
series to clinch their 12th NBA
title and their first since 1969.
The Celtics registered three of
their four victories at Milwaukee.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who
scored 26 points, and reserve
Mickey Davis led a Milwaukee
comeback that cut a 17-point
deficit midway in the third
quarter to 71-68 in the first
minute of the fourth period.
But, Cowens broke the Bucks'
momentum with a running hook
shot to touch off a run of eight
straight points as the Celtics
opened a 79-68 lead with 8:50 to
play.
