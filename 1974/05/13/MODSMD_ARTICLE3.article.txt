# Daily Editor On The Move
## Slower Than A Speeding Bullet

motorcycle zone in front of the Storke Publications
Building, the driver riding so low his head is barely visible
above the dashboard. The car stops, the driver reaches for
his briefcase, he opens the car door and saunters into the
office.
A business executive tied to his cruising days?
No, the Stanford Daily editor, Rich Jaroslovsky,

schlepping out of his schlumpmobile.
Although his collared shirt and
rolled up sleeves support his
hard-working businessman image,
.Jaroslobsky's blue jeans reveal his
Santa Rosa origin.
Born in Petaluma, Jaroslaski moved
to Santa Rosa at age two with his two
older brothers; his father, a real estate
broker; and his mother, a secretary for
a local high school principal. Since
then, his parents have added an
additional son to the family.
Even in those days, Jaroslovski
submerged himself in journalism. He
prides himself on being editor of the
Montgomery High School newspaper
his senior year when the paper won
"All-American" acclaim from the
National Scholastic Press Association.
Besides working five years on
school publications, he professes to
covering county government and the
board of supervisors for the Santa
Rosa News Herald and Healdsburg
Tribune.

"I was only a 16-year-old kid watching all those
politicians work," he remarked. "Now I'm a 20-year-old
kid."
Childish Streak
His Manzanita Park trailermates won't deny the childish
streak in his personality. One of them mentioned how he
rushes through the trailer after a shower, his head wrapped
in a pink towel "Ahab the Arab"-turban style.
A Daily typesetter, remarked on his juvenile tendencies;
"He gets excited just like a kindergarten kid" at the idea of

pasting up the paper.
Jarosluski claims to have spent the summer after his
senior year in high school reporting, copy-editing and
pasting up the pages of the Herald as its one man staff. A
Daily staffer, lurking in nearby Calistoga that summer,
reports he had never heard of the paper.
Big Move
In 1971, Jarosloski abandoned Santa Rosa for the big
city; he came to Palo Alto. This summer he will discover

the universe when he interns at the
Wall Street Journal in New York —
Jaworski has never traveled east of
lowa.
Since his first quarter at Stanford,
Jarosluvsky has worked for the Daily.
He rose in the Daily hierarchy from
entertainment editor, to news editor,
to summer editor, to executive news
editor and now he's at the top.
"He's sincere; he plows ahead; he's
not conniving at all," remarks Daily
Sports Editor Viae Kershner.
Jarusluvsky believes in being honest
with his staff. He is conscientious and
hardworking and expects his staff to
be, too. His blunt demands prompted
one disgruntled staffer to comment,
"he has the tact of a bulldozer."
Is Diplomatic
Jairosouskie is diplomatic, however,
with people outside the Daily. Not
only does he have to appease irate
women demanding more news
coverage, but now with the USE

strike, it is Jahoi sky's responsibility to determine a fair
policy in union and University coverage.
Naroslobski enjoys being editor but his happiest
moments are spent "reporting and writing a good news
story. I enjoy what I'm doing — but I don't enjoy what I'm
doing," he commented in his lucid journalistic style,
referring to his editorship.
Jarousluski takes the journalist's role seriously. So
seriously, in fact, that last year, striving for stringer

stardom, he strolled (dashing Jaroslovsky-style) to the San
Francisco Chronicle hot-line to report a story. He had read
in Campus Report that South Vietnamese President Nguyen
Thieu was planning to speak at Stanford.
News that the Stanford Chaparral fabricated the bogus
Report demanded another more demeaning dash to the
hot-line.
10 Hours Per Day
Spending at least 10 hours per weekday at the Daily
detracts from school work and a social life for Jairoslovdky.
"But I didn't come here to get good grades; I came here to
get an education," he proclaimed, staring at the low grade
on his human biology midterm — 40'/2 percent.
Jaroslosky still finds time to slip away from the Daily
hastle by riding in his car. He slumps down (thus, the
derivation of "schlumpmobile") totally oblivious to honks

and bleeps of passing cars.
Rumor has it that he is in a state of nirvana reached by
reiterating in a high-pitched voice the words of a Cheech
and Chong recording: "Push the car. Get your mother to
push the car."
Back To Reality
Singing the high parts of his favorite Temptations' song,
"I Wish It Would Rain," usually brings him back to reality.
Jaroslahouski's secretly desires to oust the Giants'
Bobby Bonds and become his favorite team's star batter. He
has renounced the Daily softball contingency, saying he
wants to be part of a winning team.
On the astrological plane, Jarosloskie is a Pisces like
John Steinbeck, Albert Einstein and Jackie Gleason.
According to Joan Hinman, resident expert, a Pisces male is
the ideal executive type, competent, not too flashy and
very concerned with what kind of job he's doing.
