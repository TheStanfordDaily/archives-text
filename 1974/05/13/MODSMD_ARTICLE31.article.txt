# McManus Wins 7-6, 6-7, 7-6, 7-6
## Hagey Loses Cal State Finals 
### RONALD BECK 
For the first time in three
years, Alex Mayer's name won't
be inscribed on the trophy for the
California State Championships.
And, despite the fact that three of
the four semifinalists were
Stanford tennis players, the Cards
will go unrepresented on'the cup.
Jim McManus, a two-time
winner of the tournament and a
louring WCT pro, downed Chico
Hagey in a remarkably close finale
to the 9 day tourney. The 7-6,
6-7, 7-6, 7-6 score truly indicates
the closeness of the match.
The Championships, held at
the Alpine Hills Tennis Club in
Portola Valley, started on a
strange note. Alex Mayer, winner
for the last two years and top
seed, defaulted because of a
pulled tooth.
Then unseeded Chico Hagey,
who has been a question mark for
the Cards all season, romped
through the field without losing a
set until the finals.
Along the way, Hagey defeated
the highest seeded player left
after Mayer's default, Tom
Leonard. He also smashed Roy
Bartli of San Diego and did
exceptionally well against Jim
,Delaney, who usually plays at the
number two spot for Stanford.
Hagey's semifinal match
against Delaney was the first
meeting of the teammates in three
years. Hagey's 6-2, 6-3 win was a
result of extremely consistent
backcourt fitting and
tremendously effective serving.
Three of the four tiebreakers in
the finals match against McManus
were extremely close. Hagey's
only tiebreaker win was his 5-1

decision in the second set. The
first set went 5-3, with Hagey
losing his will after a terrible line
call. The third set also went 5-3 in
the tiebreaker, while the match in
the fourth set was won by a
McManus overhead for a winner at
4-4 in the tiebreaker.
Coach Dick Gould commented
that this tournament has forced a
change in the Stanford lineup for
this week's Pac 8 Championships.
Hagey, who had trouble cracking
the playing lineup all year long
after last season's injury, is
assured of a spot for the matches,
"it's not a matter of whether or
not he's going to play, it's a
matter of where he's going to
Dlav," said Gould.

"He's earned himself a spot on
the team. He's been playing just
super," said Gould about Hagey's
play in the tournament. Referring
to the final's loss, Gould
commented that, "He was serving
a little off today."
Hagey felt that his own playing
this past week has been "really

good. I feel very confident now.
Earlier in the year, I was having
problems with my confidence, but
I think I've gotten over that."
"I think I've earned myself a
spot in the top four. (Against
McManus] I think I was a little
off, but so does every player when
they lose."
Gould praised the play
of Jim Delaney, Gene Mayer,
John Whitlinger and Mark
Mitchell. Whitlinger beat the
fourth seeded player, Sherwood
Stewart, en route to his semifinal
loss to McManus. Delaney and his
partner Bill Brown of San Luis
Obispo, lost in the finals of the
men's doubles to Dick Dell and
Stewart.

Tennis Talk: Other
Stanford standouts in the
tournament included Marry
O'Keefe who lost in the finals of
the women's singles and Brer.da
Garcia, who made it to the round
of 16. Gene Mayer and Chico
Hagey met in the finals of the
mixed doubles with their partners.

For the first time in three
years, Alex Mayer's name won't
be inscribed on the trophy for the
California State Championships.
And, despite the fact that three of
the four semifinalists were
Stanford tennis players, the Cards
will go unrepresented on'the cup.
Jim McManus, a two-time
winner of the tournament and a
louring WCT pro, downed Chico
Hagey in a remarkably close finale
to the 9 day tourney. The 7-6,
6-7, 7-6, 7-6 score truly indicates
the closeness of the match.
The Championships, held at
the Alpine Hills Tennis Club in
Portola Valley, started on a
strange note. Alex Mayer, winner
for the last two years and top
seed, defaulted because of a
pulled tooth.
Then unseeded Chico Hagey,
who has been a question mark for
the Cards all season, romped
through the field without losing a
set until the finals.
Along the way, Hagey defeated
the highest seeded player left
after Mayer's default, Tom
Leonard. He also smashed Roy
Bartli of San Diego and did
exceptionally well against Jim
,Delaney, who usually plays at the
number two spot for Stanford.
Hagey's semifinal match
against Delaney was the first
meeting of the teammates in three
years. Hagey's 6-2, 6-3 win was a
result of extremely consistent
backcourt fitting and
tremendously effective serving.
Three of the four tiebreakers in
the finals match against McManus
were extremely close. Hagey's
only tiebreaker win was his 5-1

decision in the second set. The
first set went 5-3, with Hagey
losing his will after a terrible line
call. The third set also went 5-3 in
the tiebreaker, while the match in
the fourth set was won by a
McManus overhead for a winner at
4-4 in the tiebreaker.
Coach Dick Gould commented
that this tournament has forced a
change in the Stanford lineup for
this week's Pac 8 Championships.
Hagey, who had trouble cracking
the playing lineup all year long
after last season's injury, is
assured of a spot for the matches,
"it's not a matter of whether or
not he's going to play, it's a
matter of where he's going to
Dlav," said Gould.

"He's earned himself a spot on
the team. He's been playing just
super," said Gould about Hagey's
play in the tournament. Referring
to the final's loss, Gould
commented that, "He was serving
a little off today."
Hagey felt that his own playing
this past week has been "really

good. I feel very confident now.
Earlier in the year, I was having
problems with my confidence, but
I think I've gotten over that."
"I think I've earned myself a
spot in the top four. (Against
McManus] I think I was a little
off, but so does every player when
they lose."
Gould praised the play
of Jim Delaney, Gene Mayer,
John Whitlinger and Mark
Mitchell. Whitlinger beat the
fourth seeded player, Sherwood
Stewart, en route to his semifinal
loss to McManus. Delaney and his
partner Bill Brown of San Luis
Obispo, lost in the finals of the
men's doubles to Dick Dell and
Stewart.
