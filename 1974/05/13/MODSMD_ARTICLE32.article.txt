### CHRIS BAKER 
Negotiations are currently
underway between the University
of Moscow and Stanford for an
exchange of water polo teams.
"There has been an exchange
of letters between the schools,"
said water polo coach Jim
Gaughran. But he added, "There's
no commitment as yet; we're still
in the talking stage."
Dr. Wei don B. Gibson, a
member of the Stanford Athletic
Board and the Stanford Research
Institute staff, is handling the
negotiations.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
emphasized that there was no real
plan yet but added, "They have
indicated that they would like to
come over first and we would
return the visit."
Gaughran indicated that the
Russians would come over in the
spring of 1975 and Stanford
would visit Moscow in the fall of
1976.
"We would hope that they
would be able to stay a week in
the Bay Area. We would play
them once; there might also be a
match between California and
them," said Gaughran.
Gaughran said the trip would
be expensive, in the
$1600-per-athlete range. "We
would have to raise funds for this
trip and we'd like to be able to
take as many as possible." he
added.
Ruetz said the trip would be
one of the few times that two
major intercollegiate teams from
different countries compete
against each other. "In some ways
it's the first real intercollegiate
competition between Russia and
the United States," he added.
Ruetz indicated that many
things still have to be worked out
before the deal is finalized.
"Academic schedules would have
to be worked out and the travel
costs are a problem."
