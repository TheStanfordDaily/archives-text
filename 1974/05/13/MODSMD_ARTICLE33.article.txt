# Card Pennant Dream Ends As Cal Takes Final Series
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
BERKELEY — Stanford's
baseball season came to an abrupt
end Saturday when California
edged the Cardinals 3-2 in the
second game of a doubleheader
Saturday at Clint Evans Field.
The day's events were just part
of a continuing saga that has been
surprising, to say the least, in the
last few weeks. The plot has been
almost as complicated as Charles
Dickens' classic creations, but
Card shortstop Steve Davis aptly
summed it up simply as "the last
chapter in a rotten book."
Here are a few excerpts from
that final chapter:
With three games to be
played Stanford and the
University of Southern California
were tied for the lead in the
Pacific Eight Southern Division
race . . . Stanford only needed a
tie at the end of the regulation
schedule to gain a playoff spot
against the Northern Division
champ on the basis of winning
five of six games from USC .. .
The Cards dropped a 4-2
decision to Cal Friday at Sunken
Diamond while USC trounced
UCLA 10-0 after the dedication
of Rod Dedeaux Field ....
Stanford won the first game of
Saturday's doubleheader 3-2 while
UCLA was coming from behind to
beat USC 6-5 simultaneously
. . . . A Card victory in the final
game of the season would
guarantee the championship, no
matter what happened in Los
Angeles .... University of
Southern California, winners over
UCLA in the nightcap, is the
Pac-8 champion for the fifth
consecutive year and still has a
shot at retaining the NCAA
championship . ... "I have

nothing profound to say," said
Stanford head coach Kay Young
after the deflating
defeat .... There's always next
year for Stanford, which finished
the season with a 24-23 overall
record and a 10-8 conference
mark.
Cal 4, Stanford 2
Cal's Juan Eichelberger
survived some shaky innings when
his teammates turned in three
double plays to defeat the Cards
4-2 in the opening game of the
series at Sunken Diamond Friday.
Eichelberger, who challenged
the Cards with a blazing fast ball,
scattered five Cardinal hits and
finished strong in picking up his
seventh win of the year.
As has been the case all season,
Stanford's Al Arthur pitched well
but was stung by his seventh
defeat against four wins.
Cal tallied three times in the
second inning on a walk, sacrifice
and two consecutive singles before
the Cards turned over a double
play to extinguish the fire. Mike
Hodgins and Steve Bartkowski
drove in a run each for the Bears.
Cal scored again in the fifth to
up the margin to 4-0 but Stanford
came back to score two in the
eighth on a single by Joe
Lamoure, an RBI triple by Bruce
Robinson and a sacrifice fly by
Dave Baker.
Eichelberger had a no-hitter
going for five innings until Card
Kim Hannal'ord singled leading off
the sixth.
Stanford 3, Cal 2
Mike Williamson pitched
another stunning game while Dave
Baker and Mark Lucich tagged
home runs to highlight Stanford's
3-2 victory in the seven-inning

first game of the doubleheader
Saturday at Berkeley's Clint Evans
Field before an estimated 1500
spectators.
Baker opened the scoring by
ripping a line drive that Cal's
leftfielder Steve Derian, vainly
attempting to catch the ball,
tipped over the makeshift fence
for a home run.
Cal tied the score, 1-1, in the
bottom of the first on a walk,
sacrifice, passed ball, and ground
ball.
In the fourth, Lucich led off
with a towering home run off
Gene Litle. Thus Lucich tied the
Stanford season mark for home
runs with his 11th round-tripper.
Also holding the record are Jim
Hibbs (1966) and Rod Boone
(1971).
Again, Cal tied the game in the
bottom of the frame on a single
by Derian, a fly ball and a
run-scoring single by Neil
Cummings.
Freshman Gary' Pitch ford
drove in Lucich, who had reached
second on a walk and sacrifice,
with a two-out single to left field
for the winning run in the sixth
inning.
Cal 3, Stanford 2
After hearing the news that
USC had lost to UCLA 6-5, the
Cards attempted to clinch a
division championship but failed.
Cal's Hank Sauer, Jr., son of
former major league star and San
Francisco Giant scout Hank
Sauer, Sr., was the game's villain
or hero, depending on your point
of view.

Sauer, who would not have
started the game but for the fact
he was a senior playing the final
game of the season, knocked a
Dave Frost fast ball over the left
field fence for a three-run homer.
The first-inning blast was enough
to hold up for Cal's win and
Stanford's demise.
Sauer hadn't been playing for
the Bears. "I haven't been
performing well," said Sauer.
"I've been off and on all year."
He certainly was on Saturday as
he collected two hits in addition
to the home run.
"Just one pitch in the game
hurt us, that three-run homer,"
said Young.
Freshman John Yandle, who
relieved Frost in the second
inning, shut the Bears off but
could not get any scoring support
from his teammates.

Cards attempted to clinch a
division championship but failed.
Cal's Hank Sauer, Jr., son of
former major league star and San
Francisco Giant scout Hank
Sauer, Sr., was the game's villain
or hero, depending on your point
of view.

Sauer, who would not have
started the game but for the fact
he was a senior playing the final
game of the season, knocked a
Dave Frost fast ball over the left
field fence for a three-run homer.
The first-inning blast was enough
to hold up for Cal's win and
Stanford's demise.
Sauer hadn't been playing for
the Bears. "I haven't been
performing well," said Sauer.
"I've been off and on all year."
He certainly was on Saturday as
he collected two hits in addition
to the home run.
"Just one pitch in the game
hurt us, that three-run homer,"
said Young.
Freshman John Yandle, who
relieved Frost in the second
inning, shut the Bears off but
could not get any scoring support
from his teammates.

BERKELEY — Stanford's
baseball season came to an abrupt
end Saturday when California
edged the Cardinals 3-2 in the
second game of a doubleheader
Saturday at Clint Evans Field.
The day's events were just part
of a continuing saga that has been
surprising, to say the least, in the
last few weeks. The plot has been
almost as complicated as Charles
Dickens' classic creations, but
Card shortstop Steve Davis aptly
summed it up simply as "the last
chapter in a rotten book."
Here are a few excerpts from
that final chapter:
With three games to be
played Stanford and the
University of Southern California
were tied for the lead in the
Pacific Eight Southern Division
race . . . Stanford only needed a
tie at the end of the regulation
schedule to gain a playoff spot
against the Northern Division
champ on the basis of winning
five of six games from USC .. .
The Cards dropped a 4-2
decision to Cal Friday at Sunken
Diamond while USC trounced
UCLA 10-0 after the dedication
of Rod Dedeaux Field ....
Stanford won the first game of
Saturday's doubleheader 3-2 while
UCLA was coming from behind to
beat USC 6-5 simultaneously
. . . . A Card victory in the final
game of the season would
guarantee the championship, no
matter what happened in Los
Angeles .... University of
Southern California, winners over
UCLA in the nightcap, is the
Pac-8 champion for the fifth
consecutive year and still has a
shot at retaining the NCAA
championship . ... "I have

nothing profound to say," said
Stanford head coach Kay Young
after the deflating
defeat .... There's always next
year for Stanford, which finished
the season with a 24-23 overall
record and a 10-8 conference
mark.
Cal 4, Stanford 2
Cal's Juan Eichelberger
survived some shaky innings when
his teammates turned in three
double plays to defeat the Cards
4-2 in the opening game of the
series at Sunken Diamond Friday.
Eichelberger, who challenged
the Cards with a blazing fast ball,
scattered five Cardinal hits and
finished strong in picking up his
seventh win of the year.
As has been the case all season,
Stanford's Al Arthur pitched well
but was stung by his seventh
defeat against four wins.
Cal tallied three times in the
second inning on a walk, sacrifice
and two consecutive singles before
the Cards turned over a double
play to extinguish the fire. Mike
Hodgins and Steve Bartkowski
drove in a run each for the Bears.
Cal scored again in the fifth to
up the margin to 4-0 but Stanford
came back to score two in the
eighth on a single by Joe
Lamoure, an RBI triple by Bruce
Robinson and a sacrifice fly by
Dave Baker.
Eichelberger had a no-hitter
going for five innings until Card
Kim Hannal'ord singled leading off
the sixth.
Stanford 3, Cal 2
Mike Williamson pitched
another stunning game while Dave
Baker and Mark Lucich tagged
home runs to highlight Stanford's
3-2 victory in the seven-inning

first game of the doubleheader
Saturday at Berkeley's Clint Evans
Field before an estimated 1500
spectators.
Baker opened the scoring by
ripping a line drive that Cal's
leftfielder Steve Derian, vainly
attempting to catch the ball,
tipped over the makeshift fence
for a home run.
Cal tied the score, 1-1, in the
bottom of the first on a walk,
sacrifice, passed ball, and ground
ball.
In the fourth, Lucich led off
with a towering home run off
Gene Litle. Thus Lucich tied the
Stanford season mark for home
runs with his 11th round-tripper.
Also holding the record are Jim
Hibbs (1966) and Rod Boone
(1971).
Again, Cal tied the game in the
bottom of the frame on a single
by Derian, a fly ball and a
run-scoring single by Neil
Cummings.
Freshman Gary' Pitch ford
drove in Lucich, who had reached
second on a walk and sacrifice,
with a two-out single to left field
for the winning run in the sixth
inning.
Cal 3, Stanford 2
After hearing the news that
USC had lost to UCLA 6-5, the
Cards attempted to clinch a

his teammates turned in three
double plays to defeat the Cards
4-2 in the opening game of the
series at Sunken Diamond Friday.
Eichelberger, who challenged
the Cards with a blazing fast ball,
scattered five Cardinal hits and
finished strong in picking up his
seventh win of the year.
As has been the case all season,
Stanford's Al Arthur pitched well
but was stung by his seventh
defeat against four wins.
Cal tallied three times in the
second inning on a walk, sacrifice
and two consecutive singles before
the Cards turned over a double
play to extinguish the fire. Mike
Hodgins and Steve Bartkowski
drove in a run each for the Bears.
Cal scored again in the fifth to
up the margin to 4-0 but Stanford
came back to score two in the
eighth on a single by Joe
Lamoure, an RBI triple by Bruce
Robinson and a sacrifice fly by
Dave Baker.
Eichelberger had a no-hitter
going for five innings until Card
Kim Hannal'ord singled leading off
the sixth.
Stanford 3, Cal 2
Mike Williamson pitched
another stunning game while Dave
Baker and Mark Lucich tagged
home runs to highlight Stanford's
3-2 victory in the seven-inning

first game of the doubleheader
Saturday at Berkeley's Clint Evans
Field before an estimated 1500
spectators.
Baker opened the scoring by
ripping a line drive that Cal's
leftfielder Steve Derian, vainly
attempting to catch the ball,
tipped over the makeshift fence
for a home run.
Cal tied the score, 1-1, in the
bottom of the first on a walk,
sacrifice, passed ball, and ground
ball.
In the fourth, Lucich led off
with a towering home run off
Gene Litle. Thus Lucich tied the
Stanford season mark for home
runs with his 11th round-tripper.
Also holding the record are Jim
Hibbs (1966) and Rod Boone
(1971).
Again, Cal tied the game in the
bottom of the frame on a single
by Derian, a fly ball and a
run-scoring single by Neil
Cummings.
Freshman Gary' Pitch ford
drove in Lucich, who had reached
second on a walk and sacrifice,
with a two-out single to left field
for the winning run in the sixth
inning.
Cal 3, Stanford 2
After hearing the news that
USC had lost to UCLA 6-5, the
Cards attempted to clinch a
division championship but failed.
Cal's Hank Sauer, Jr., son of
former major league star and San
Francisco Giant scout Hank
Sauer, Sr., was the game's villain
or hero, depending on your point
of view.

Sauer, who would not have
started the game but for the fact
he was a senior playing the final
game of the season, knocked a
Dave Frost fast ball over the left
field fence for a three-run homer.
The first-inning blast was enough
to hold up for Cal's win and
Stanford's demise.
Sauer hadn't been playing for
the Bears. "I haven't been
performing well," said Sauer.
"I've been off and on all year."
He certainly was on Saturday as
he collected two hits in addition
to the home run.
"Just one pitch in the game
hurt us, that three-run homer,"
said Young.
Freshman John Yandle, who
relieved Frost in the second
inning, shut the Bears off but
could not get any scoring support
from his teammates.

BERKELEY — Stanford's
baseball season came to an abrupt
end Saturday when California
edged the Cardinals 3-2 in the
second game of a doubleheader
Saturday at Clint Evans Field.
The day's events were just part
of a continuing saga that has been
surprising, to say the least, in the
last few weeks. The plot has been
almost as complicated as Charles
Dickens' classic creations, but
Card shortstop Steve Davis aptly
summed it up simply as "the last
chapter in a rotten book."
Here are a few excerpts from
that final chapter:
With three games to be
played Stanford and the
University of Southern California
were tied for the lead in the
Pacific Eight Southern Division
race . . . Stanford only needed a
tie at the end of the regulation
schedule to gain a playoff spot
against the Northern Division
champ on the basis of winning
five of six games from USC .. .
The Cards dropped a 4-2
decision to Cal Friday at Sunken
Diamond while USC trounced
UCLA 10-0 after the dedication
of Rod Dedeaux Field ....
Stanford won the first game of
Saturday's doubleheader 3-2 while
UCLA was coming from behind to
beat USC 6-5 simultaneously
. . . . A Card victory in the final
game of the season would
guarantee the championship, no
matter what happened in Los
Angeles .... University of
Southern California, winners over
UCLA in the nightcap, is the
Pac-8 champion for the fifth
consecutive year and still has a
shot at retaining the NCAA
championship . ... "I have

nothing profound to say," said
