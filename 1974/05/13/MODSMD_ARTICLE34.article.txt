# Hopkins Paces Card Tracksters In Relays
## 
### 
Stanford's track team came
away from Saturday's West Coast
Relays in Fresno with nine wrist
watches. But the Fresno police
aren't searching for the Cards,
who received the watches for their
performances in the meet.
The Cards didn't get up at 6
a.m. Saturday just to win wrist
watches, though'. The trek to
Frer.no represented a last chance
for some of them to qualify for
the Pacific Eight track meet this
weekend in Los Angeles.
Ken Curl used the opportunity
well, matching the Pac-8 century
standard of 9.6. Curl, who placed
fourth in the Pac-8 100 last year,
has been plagued with injuries this
year, and had been hard pressed
to meet the qualifying standard.
The Cards had a good day in
the field. Javelin thrower Steve
Hopkins had the best day of his
career, upping his lifetime best to
230-5 to win the event.
Jim Royer had another good
performance in the discus,
finishing second with a throw of
159-0. *

The Card two-mile relay team
of Vernell Jackson, Jim Bordoni,
Bruce Wolfe and Ben Scheible
won their event with a 7:58.8 in
the university-open division.
Stanford's mile relay team
posted its best time of the season
with a 3:13.4 to win the event.
Matt Hogsett's opening leg was his
fastest 440 of the year, a 47.5.
Tne distance medlay team
brought home more wrist watches
for its first place finish in the
event. John Kessel ran the 440,
Ben Scheible the 880, Tom
Pitchford the 1320 and Bruce
Wolfe the mile.
Jordan Pleased
"We accomplished what we
intended to," said Stanford coach
Payton Jordan. "We were all
pleased with the production of
the team. It was a great thrill for
them to win watches for their
races."
There was a sad note to the
day. Hurdler Dave Bagshaw was
unable to compete in the 120
hurdles. Apparently Bagshaw
injured his knee earlier this week
in a water fight at his fraternity.
