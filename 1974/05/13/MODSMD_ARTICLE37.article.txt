# Frosh Track Sensation
## Marvin Holmes: A Dual Personality 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Marvin Holmes has a split
personality. There's the easy-going
Marvin, joking with friends before
track practice. But on the
Stanford Stadium track one sees
an intense Marvin Holmes.
The intense Holmes is the one
who senses something wrong with
his 220-yard dash start and runs
ten 220's to correct it.
But don't go calling the
Stanford Medical Center yet. It is
this split personality which has
enabled him to compete as a
freshman in Pacific Eight track.
Holmes hasn't just occupied a lane
on the track, either; he's been a
rugged three-event man,
competing in the 100-yard dash,
220 and 440 relay.
His duality often confuses
people, among them Stanford
track coach Payton Jordan.
"When I recruited him I thought
he was just a nice quiet kid. I
didn't sense his intensity or desire.
But when I started working with
him it really came through.
Turns Himself On
"He turns himself on. When
he's doing something wrong he
doesn't run to me and say you
coached me wrong, he runs some
220's to correct it," said Jordan.
But sometimes Holmes can
become too intense, relates
Jordan. "He'll work until he gets
cramps and you have to hold him
down."
Holmes came to the Farm after
a very successful high school
career at Monrovia High in
Southern California. He was an
All-League fullback in football
and CIF Southern Section
champion in the 220.

With all the talk that is flying
about track recruiting, one would
assume that every track coach in
the country would have toeen
knocking on his door with a free
car. But his parents didn't have to
build a fence around the house. "I
was good in high school but I
wasn't an Ail-American or
anything like that," said Holmes.
Although track powerhouse
UCLA talked to Holmes, he
decided to attend an "Ivy League
school." The only problem was
that East Coast weather and
Marvin Holmes don't mix. So
Stanford got the call. "Stanford
has the prestige of an Ivy League
school," said Holmes.
But being CIF 220 champ is a
lot different from repeating the
feat in the Pac-8. The conference
is one of the toughest in the
nation.
Yet this transition to the 'Big
Time" didn't bother him, "I was
afraid when I got in the blocks
against those guys in the USC
meet, but I realized that I
wouldn't have been there if I
couldn't compete against them."
Conies To Run
Jordan sensed Holmes' fear in
the USC meet. "Sure he had his
doubts, but he comes to run and
he doesn't back away from
competition. Never count him out
of a race, he'll always be in
there," said Jordan.
The shortage of females has
been offered as a reason more top
athletes don't enroll here, yet this
hasn't bothered Holmes. "I can
relate to Stanford girls in a way
that was not possible in high
school. There they were afraid to
talk to me, but here I can discuss

anything with 'em," said Holmes.
Stanford's social life has been
the subject of a heated debate
which surfaced in a profile of
Sandy Mayer (Daily, April 19-20).
Holmes doesn't agree with Mayer.
Social Life
"Here the girls are more open.
They have long range goals and 1
can associate with that. Some of
'em are out to compete with you,
but I don't find that too much.
Most guys come to college and
they're afraid to lower their
standards. This is a college area
and you shouldn't limit yourself
to staying on campus for your
social life," said Holmes.
Although he was recruited as a
track man, he was a reserve
tailback on this year's junior
varsity football team. Next year
he's expected to fill a gap in the
defensive backfield for the varsity.
"I like football but I felt that I
could have played more. The
coaches want to shift me to
defensive back and I'm open to
the idea. I really think my speed
will help there."
Not Loafing
Holmes didn't participate in
spring football drills since he was
running track. "When the idea of
missing spring football came up I
asked the coaches what my
chances were and they said they
were about equal. I'm not loafing.
I'm running track and this will
help me because I'm developing a
faster start," said Holmes.
He enjoys track practice more
than football practice. "Track
practice , is fun because I love to
run. Football is more
regimented," says Holmes.

Track is a sport of records and
Holmes has a few he would like to;
break, such as the Stanford
century and 220 mark. "I set my.
goals one at a time. Eventually I
would like to win the NCAA's'
though," said Holmes.
He doesn't have any long range
academic goals. "Right now I'm
just a freshman and I'm still
looking for a major."
Goals
At the moment he is
concentrating on winning the
Pae-8 220 this weekend in Los
Angeles. "I've already qualified
for the 220 and I'm working on a
faster start. I've been coming from
behind a lot this year and I want
to run a better race," said Holmes.
The dual meet fortunes of the
Cards haven't been too good this
year but Holmes relates, "Sooner
or later track becomes an
individual thing. We work
together, thus we all know what a
good performance is in another
event and we cheer each other
on."
Although it's a little early to
make a prediction about how
good Marvin Holmes can be,
Jordan said, "He can be a great
track man. He's got the ambition
and the natural talent to go with
it. And he's a real worker. This
will pay off for him. When
something isn't right In- senses it
and looks to himself to correct it.
He's really got great potential.
When it's toughest, never count
him out of there."
Jordan has tried to keep the
pressure off him this season.
"Sometimes a kid can be pushed
too much. We take things one at a
time, one goal at a time."
