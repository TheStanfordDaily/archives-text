Nixon Loses Newspaper Support
Newspaper editorial support for President Nixon
continued to dwindle yesterday in the wake of disclosure of
the partial, edited transcripts of the Watergate tapes.
The Providence Sunday Journal, which has supported
Nixon in all his national campaigns since 1952, said the
President should resign as a last service to the nation.
However, the Nevada State Journal in Reno called for
Nixon's removal through impeachment and added the
President "should not be allowed to resign."
Meanwhile, Presidential Counsel J. Fred Buzhardt said
yesterday that in recent days "we have been literally
besieged" with unsupported rumors that some of the tapes
of Nixon's conversations contain ethnic slurs and "some of
the most outrageous language you've ever heard."
Buzhardt, referring to reports that Nixon had used
ethnic characterizations such as "Jewboy" and "Wop" in
speaking of government officials, said he had listened to
"close to 40" of the tapes and"I don't remember the word
'Jew'; I do remember the word 'Jewish' being
used . . . somebody may have said somebody was Polish."
"It's clear that a concerted campaign has been made to
cause these to be publicized," Buzhardt said. "I can only
characterize this as a malicious and vicious attempt to
poison the public's mind against him."
A source familiar with the tapes, however, told the
Associated Press late yesterday that "no reasonable person
who heard those remarks |on the tapes] could possibly
deny that they were racial slurs."
In a visit to Oklahoma Saturday, Nixon vowed he would
"never give up" despite burgeoning clamor for his
resignation. He was received there with general warmth by
large crowds at both Vance Air Force Base and at
Oklahoma State University.
Kissinger: Peace Talk Progress
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
said he had made some progress in talks yesterday with
Syrian leaders in working toward a disengagement of Syrian
and Israeli forces on the Golan Heights.
He said no agreement has been reached.
After his talks in Damascus yesterday, Kissinger flew to
Tel Aviv. He then drove to Jerusalem for another round of
negotiations with Premier Golda Meir and top cabinet
ministers.
After Kissinger's meeting with Meir, authoritative Israeli
sources said the gaps between the Israeli and Syrian
positions were as wide as before. The sources said Kissinger
during the meeting dwelled on "the alternatives to
disengagement," interpreted to mean another full scale war.
Israeli and American officials had hoped the secretary's
four-and-a-half hours of talks with Syrian President Hafez
Assad earlier yesterday would score a breakthrough for a
disengagement pact. But instead of a final response,
Kissinger brought more questions to discuss with the
Israelis.
Kissinger had departed for Damascus early yesterday

with his spirits buoyed by what American officials
described as a definite and positive change in Syria's
attitude.
Destructive Earthquake Hits China
TOKYO — A powerful earthquake in southern China on
Saturday caused loss of life and considerable destruction to
homes, a broadcast from Peking said yesterday.
The report gave no figures, but maps and other reference
materials indicated that such a quake in that area could
cause many casualties.
It was the first Chinese confirmation of the quake,
which had been reported by foreign seismograph stations
early Saturday.
The U.S. Earthquake Information Center in Boulder,
Colo., said earlier the quake registered seven on the Richter
scale and was large enough to be capable of widespread
heavy damage in populated areas. The 1906 San Francisco
quake registered 8.6 on the Richter scale.
The official Hsinhua news agency, in a broadcast
monitored in Tokyo yesterday, said hardest hit were the
Chaotung area in Yunnan province and the Liangshan
autonomous region in neighboring Szechwan province.
The news agency said that the quake caused "varying
degrees of damage to houses and losses in lives and
livestock."
Chinese maps put the center of the quake about 50 miles
north of the city of Chaotung and about 55 miles south of
Ipin. Although available reference books did not list
population figures for either city, the size of the characters
used for them on Chinese maps would indicate each has
between 100,000 and 500,000 persons.
Dog Finds Hearst Blindfold?
SAN FRANCISCO — The FBI said yesterday it had no
comment on reports that a bloodhound led agents to a
blindfold bearing the scent of newspaper heiress Patricia
Hearst.
"I have no comment on that today," said agent John
Kelly.
On May 2, a bloodhound trained to detect the scent of
Patricia reportedly led agents to a blindfold fashioned from
sponges in an apartment that had been used by the terrorist
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA).
The Chicago Tribune, quoting federal sources, made the
report in its editions yesterday.
If confirmed, the development could indicate that
Patricia still is being held against her will. In her most
recent taped messages, the 20-year-old coed repudiated her
parents, said she had cast her lot with her abductors and
participated in a $10,690 bank robbery with SLA members.
