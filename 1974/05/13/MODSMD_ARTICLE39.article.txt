# Mysteries Unravel, Doubt Ebbs As Campus Adjusts To Centrex

Centrex—marvel, mystery or
mistake?
As the new telephone system,
Centralized Telephone Exchange
Service (Centrex), enters its third week
at Stanford, most people seem pleased
with it.
Yet some University extension
users consider how to use the system a
mystery, while a number of students
find the mystery lies in Centrex's
actual significance. To them, Centrex
means dialing a new central University
number.
There are those, too, who think of
Centrex as detrimental.
However, people are apparently
adjusting to the new system, according
to Bruce Wiggins, Plant Services
operations manager and Centrex
coordinator. Fewer people are calling
the old central number and reaching
the intercept operators.
Fewer Intercept
"On the first day after the cutover
the intercept operators received 5394
calls; by May 3 they had decreased to
3061. That's very good," Wiggins
commented.
President Richard Lyman praised
the April 19 cutover contrasting it to
the transition to Centrex at other
institutions which had "horrendous

experiences."
The University's chief operator,
Edna Barnes remarked, "I think it has
been a very clean and smooth cutover.
A lot of the problems are caused by
people not knowing how to dial. This
comes from not attending the station
users' programs [orientation
sessions]."
About 4000 people
approximately 40 percent of the
faculty and staff — attended the 206
sessions prior to the introduction of
Centrex.

One student, Paul Weintraub,
commented, "It (Centrex) really isn't
that advantegeous for students either
way since we still have to call the
central number if we don't have
directories. It's too late in the quarter
to spend $2.50 on a directory for five
or six calls just to help Centrex."
Directory distribution to students
would be too expensive for the
number of calls students make,
Wiggins said.
A few departments have
encountered technical problems with
Centrex. John Bowers, support
services supervisor of patient
accounting at the Medical Center,
fumed, "It's a mess right now; it's
horrible. We get all kinds of problems.

We put a patient on hold and an
account representative picks up the
line and no one's there."
The Daily has had difficulties
making local calls— a majv.( problem
for a newspaper— according to Editor
Rich Jaroslovsky.
In a study of possible telephone
systems at Stanford, Harry Turner and
Keith Claxton of Management Studies
calculated that an average of 1.6 local
calls are made daily from each
University telephone. According to
Jaroslovsky and Mike Kruger, Daily
business manager, the Daily makes
about an average of 5.3 calls daily on
each of its 15 telephones.
Since each department is billed
directly for local calls under Centrex,
departments which make many local
calls, such as the Daily, could face a
major increase in their telephone bill.
Previously, the charge for local calls
was distributed evenly among the
departments.
"Is Centrex worthwhile for such
departments?" people ask. The only
alternative is a private line with
business rates— the first 6 local calls
free, additional ones 4.5 cents each;
there is no flat rate for business
phones according to Oley
Killingsworth, telecommunications
supervisor.

institutions which had "horrendous

experiences."
The University's chief operator,
Edna Barnes remarked, "I think it has
been a very clean and smooth cutover.
A lot of the problems are caused by
people not knowing how to dial. This
comes from not attending the station
users' programs [orientation
sessions]."
About 4000 people
approximately 40 percent of the
faculty and staff — attended the 206
sessions prior to the introduction of
Centrex.

One student, Paul Weintraub,
commented, "It (Centrex) really isn't
that advantegeous for students either
way since we still have to call the
central number if we don't have
directories. It's too late in the quarter
to spend $2.50 on a directory for five
or six calls just to help Centrex."
Directory distribution to students
would be too expensive for the
number of calls students make,
Wiggins said.
A few departments have
encountered technical problems with
Centrex. John Bowers, support
services supervisor of patient
accounting at the Medical Center,
fumed, "It's a mess right now; it's
horrible. We get all kinds of problems.

We put a patient on hold and an
account representative picks up the
line and no one's there."
The Daily has had difficulties
making local calls— a majv.( problem
for a newspaper— according to Editor
Rich Jaroslovsky.
In a study of possible telephone
systems at Stanford, Harry Turner and
Keith Claxton of Management Studies
calculated that an average of 1.6 local
calls are made daily from each
University telephone. According to
Jaroslovsky and Mike Kruger, Daily
business manager, the Daily makes
about an average of 5.3 calls daily on
each of its 15 telephones.
Since each department is billed
directly for local calls under Centrex,
departments which make many local
calls, such as the Daily, could face a
major increase in their telephone bill.
Previously, the charge for local calls
was distributed evenly among the
departments.
"Is Centrex worthwhile for such
departments?" people ask. The only
alternative is a private line with
business rates— the first 6 local calls
free, additional ones 4.5 cents each;
there is no flat rate for business
phones according to Oley
Killingsworth, telecommunications
supervisor.
Centrex—marvel, mystery or
mistake?
As the new telephone system,
Centralized Telephone Exchange
Service (Centrex), enters its third week
at Stanford, most people seem pleased
with it.
Yet some University extension
users consider how to use the system a
mystery, while a number of students
find the mystery lies in Centrex's
actual significance. To them, Centrex
means dialing a new central University
number.
There are those, too, who think of
Centrex as detrimental.
However, people are apparently
adjusting to the new system, according
to Bruce Wiggins, Plant Services
operations manager and Centrex
coordinator. Fewer people are calling
the old central number and reaching
the intercept operators.
Fewer Intercept
"On the first day after the cutover
the intercept operators received 5394
calls; by May 3 they had decreased to
3061. That's very good," Wiggins
commented.
President Richard Lyman praised
the April 19 cutover contrasting it to
the transition to Centrex at other
institutions which had "horrendous

experiences."
