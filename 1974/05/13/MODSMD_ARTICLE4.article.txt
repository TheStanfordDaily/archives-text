# Weekend Carnival Nets $1500 For Relief Fund
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Thousands of persons crowded the
midway between Wilbur and Stern
Halls during the carnival for the
African Famine Relief Fund this
weekend.
Bob Naon, student organizer of the
three-day fair, guessed that the event
may have netted as much as $1500 for
the fund, which provides assistance to
residents of Africa's many
drought-stricken nations.
"I'd guess we may wind up with
$1500 or so," Naon said. "Before we
started, I really had no idea how much
we'd make."
The carnival featured professional
games and rides run by Foley and
Burk Combined Shows as well as
booths set up by 13 different
dormitories.
Students sponsors of the affair
received 10 percent of proceeds from
the rides, plus $50 per game booth
sponsored by Foley and Burk. At least
two-thirds of the gross from each
dorm booth went to the Relief Fund,
according to Naon.
The concession stands, organized
by law graduate Ed Connor, grossed

more than $1100 alone.
Refreshments were bought on
consignment so the organizers could
return any not used. Thus, Naon was
unsure of the exact overhead involved.
The carnival may become an annual
event. William Miller, a manager of the
carnival, said a yearly fair would
probably be a success.
"This fair has great potential. If
you're . . . making it an annual event,
you'll generally build [attendance] to
a peak in three years and then hold
there," Miller elaborated.
Miller was pleased with the turnout
at this year's festival, even though it
only lasted three days.
"Normally, we open on a
Wednesday. This is the first time this
year we've been playing for less than
five days at a spot... All in all, we've
had three good days here," Miller
concluded.
Representatives of Foley and Burk
told student organizers they grossed
$5688 during the carnival's first two
days.
Connor, who arranged for about 30
persons to man the concession stands,
said that attendance at the event was

highest Friday night, Saturday night,
and Sunday afternoon. Naon was
pleased with the turnout.
"We had 10,000 people on rides
during the first two days alone," he
noted.
Naon added that this was the first
event of the school year in which
many dorms got together on one
project.
"I was glad to see so many dorms
from all over campus working on this
carnival. It's something there should
be more of," Naon asserted.
Crothers Memorial sponsored a
dunking pond, in which persons could
throw a baseball at a target to send a
hapless volunteer plunging into a pond
of water. Among the persons receiving
dunkings were Larry Horton, associate
dean of student affairs; Dale Snape,
assistant dean of student affairs, and
members of the ASSU Council of
Presidents.
Naon said that initial expenses for
the sponsors, including equipment
rental and publicity, were offset by
donations from the Law School
Association and various dormitories.
