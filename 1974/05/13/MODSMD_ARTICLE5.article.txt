# Dissident Exiled For Views
## Russian Scientist To Speak 
### SANDY WHITE 
"I am not a star; I am not
[Alexander] Solzhenitsyn. I prefer to
be known in my capacity as a
scientist." With these words, Russian
geneticist and gerontoiogist Zhores A.
Medvedev refused television coverage
of his press conference at the Medical
Center Friday.
Medvedev, who is making his first
tour of the United States, Friday give
"An Analysis of Longevity and the
Human Lifespan." He will lecture

tonight on "Dissent in the Soviet
Union" in Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 8
p.m.
He is an expert on both subjects —
the first by choice, the second by
conscience. Though he prefers his role
as a scientist, he has been thrown into
the limelight by his belief in free
scientific expression. Medvedev fought
Lysenkoist anti-science thought in
Stalinist Russia. His protests against
the Soviet government have brought
him only trouble over the years.
He was sent to a mental institution
in 1970, refused permission to attend
a scientific conference in London in
1971, reportedly kidnapped from a
Kiev hotel room in 1972 and deprived
of his citizenship in 1973.
Medvedev is one of the leaders in
the search for the different
components which make up the aging
mechanism. He formulated what has
developed into the "error theory of
aging" in the late 1950'5, and is now
researching the molecular aspects of
aging at the Medical Research Council
Laboratories at Mill Hill in London.
Medvedev believes there are many
causes for different rates of aging.
Gerontologists have not been able to
find one primary mechanism which
determines an individual's lifespan, but
they hope to discover the interrelated
factors involved.
Popular theories hold that there are
redundancies in the genetic code, and
that this selective repetition of genes is
related to aging rates. Scientists will
"certainly" be able to intervene in the
aging process in the future, he said,
but it will not be one simple process.
Medvedev discounts recent
discoveries of groups of centenarians
in Ecuador and the Soviet Union,
citing lack of proper birth records and
poor memories on the part of the
elderly.
In some cases, he said, age may
have been exaggerated to gain added
respect for the person in question or
to gain provincial notoriety.
A Colombian postage stamp of a
few years ago saluted Javier Periera,
who was supposedly 167 years old. It
told his key to a long life: "No se
preocupe, tome much cafe, y fume un
buen cigarro. [Don't worry, drink a lot
of coffee, and smoke a good cigar.]"
Medvedev's scientific studies have
been interrupted frequently by
Russian authorities. He lost his job as
head of the Laboratory of Molecular
Radiobiology at the Institute of

Medical Radiology in Obninsk after he
wrote The Medvedev Papers, which
were critical of Soviet policy.
He lost his citizenship when he left
for England to do research. He does
not know what motivates Soviet
authorities. "Those who desperately
want to leave, such as [Andrei]
Sakharov, who was offered a job at
Princeton — are refused permission.
And those who want to stay, such as
Solzhenitsyn, are deported. I can't
find any explanation for this situation.
Medvedev believes that better
relations between the Soviet Union
and all other nations can "influence
the position of Russian authorities,"
and can open the way toward greater
leniency toward intellectuals, writers
and scientists. He will discuss this
view, which differs from those of
fellow dissenters Solzhenitsyn and
Sakharov, in greater detail tonight.
