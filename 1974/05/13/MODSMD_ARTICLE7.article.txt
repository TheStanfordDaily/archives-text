# Goheen Succeeds Hall As Campus Ombudsman
## 
### CECILE HEROLD 
John D. Goheen, emeritus professor
of philosophy, has been appointed
University ombudsman for 1974-75.
Goheen will succeed Harvey Hall,
who will complete two years as
ombudsman this June.
"Goheen is an excellent choice
because he knows the University scene
so well," Hall stated last week. "He
has been very active and is responsible
for a number of educational
innovations."
Hall noted that Goheen helped
reorganize the University's advising
system, initiating freshman seminars in
which a freshman's house fellow serves
both as his advisor and his instructor.
In the 1960'5, Goheen assisted the
University in establishing study centers
in Japan and Taiwan. He won the
Lloyd C. Dinkelspiel Award for
outstanding service to undergraduate
education in 1971.
Hall said that Goheen may find the
office of ombudsman an increasingly
less time-consuming job because
"various academic and administrative
offices are developing their own
internal proceedings to deal with
problems."
Hall noted that the School of
Engineering has already established its
own position of ombudsman has

already established its own position of
ombudsman.
The office of ombudsman has
existed at Stanford since 1971. "In the
late '60's, ideas were sought to deal
with activism and to solve the often
justifiable student grievances," Hall
explained. "The office of ombudsman
was the most popular solution."
During his administration. Hall
found that about 75 percent of the
problems he investigated were
student-related and 25 percent were
faculty-related.
According to University policy, the
ombudsman's task is to "receive,
examine, and channel the complaints"
of members of the Stanford
community. Upon investigation of a
grievance, he may "suggest an
improvement, a specific remedy to
correct individual injustices, and may
suggest an improvement in future
proceedings and routines." The
ombudsman is concerned with all
abuses related to University functions,
whether they deal with involved
students, faculty or staff. He may
refuse to deal with any problems.
Prof. Alberta Siegel of psychology
in psychiatry headed the search
committee which recommended
Goheen to the office.
