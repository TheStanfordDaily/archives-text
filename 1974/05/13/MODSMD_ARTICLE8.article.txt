# Is SLA Leader Agent Of Police?
## 
### 
Si/ton, Gray

The sudden birth and dramatic
exploits of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) have
brought much criticism of the
radical Left in general for its
"revolutionary character." Yet
the radical Left has not benefited
either physically or politically by
the actions of the SLA.
In fact, the SLA has proven to
be counter-revolutionary in nature
and thus cannot plausibly be
linked to the Left in character or
actions.
For the murder of Marcus
Foster and the random shooting
following the bank robbery, the
SLA has been repudiated by The
Guardian, the Young Socialists,
the Black Panthers, La Raza
Unida, the United Farmworkers,
the remnants of Venceremos,
Vietnam Veterans Against the War
and almost all the remaining
elements of the Left. Yet the SLA
is continually portrayed as a
radical organization when almost
all left radicals see them as
counter-productive or indeed
reactionary.
SLA's True Nature
In light of these facts, the great
discrepancy concerning the SLA's
true nature seems difficult to
explain. Recently, though, a
number of radical sources have
cited strong evidence that suggests
that Donald DeFreeze (alias
Cinque) is in actuality a police
agent.
It is an unpleasant reality that
police use of provocateurs (not
just informers) is actually much
greater than is generally believed.
Police agents often serve
leadership roles, often supply
explosives or weapon expertise,
and usually are vocal proponents
of violence.
Proven cases include Tommy
the Traveler (Tommy Tongyai),
an outspoken advocate of violence
as an assumed SDS organizer, who
built bombs for the May X, 1970
fire-bombing of an ROTC
building; Wilbert Thomas, a New
York City police patrolman who
infiltrated the N.Y. Black
Panthers, attempting to discredit
the Panthers by linking them to a
violent robbery planned by
Thomas, Melvin "Cotton" Smith,
who infiltrated the Los Angeles
Black Panthers for the Criminal
Conspiracy Section of the LAPD,
supplying weapons and advocating
violence to entrap 13 Panthers.
Together with that of Jack
Weatherford, who infiltrated the
SDS in Columbia, S.C., supplying
leadership, advocating violence,
entrapping radicals and commiting
a number of overt violent acts,
these few cases give perspective to
the rather startling claim of
DeFreeze's identity as a policy
agent.
Known Informer
DeFreeze himself was known
in his early criminal history as a
police informer. Despite having an
arrest record since age 14, he was
not imprisoned until 1969. Before
that time, he had committed a
number of crimes including
burglary, assault with a deadly
weapon, parole violations,
attempted escape from the police
and theft of 200 weapons from an
army surplus store in Los Angeles.
In the case of the gun thefts,
DeFreeze turned in his partner,
Ronald Coleman, with a
telephone call to the police.
DeFreeze received five years
probation for the theft.
On April 20, 1969, police
picked up DeFreeze with a fully
loaded semi-automatic M-68 rifle,
along with an attached clip
containing 32 bullets. Although
he was on probation, this and two
succeeding arrests did not result in
any jail confinement. Finally he
tried to cash a fake check and was

caught as he tried to shoot his
way out.
DeFreeze ended up at Vacaville
(Medical Facility) Prison, where
he attempted to become head of
the Black Culture Association.
When rejected, he protested to the
authorities who then appointed
him chairman of his own group,
Unisight.
One of the first outside people
to participate in Unisight was
Russell Little, an alleged member
of the SLA and one of the two
white men charged with the
murder of Oakland
Superintendent of Schools Marcus
Foster.
DeFreeze was soon transferred
to Soledad Prison, from which he
escaped on March 5, 1973 when a
guard left him alone to work on a
boiler in a then-unused portion of
the minimum security facility.
Extradition Refused
Since 1965, New Jersey has
been trying to extradite DeFreeze
on kidnapping charges. California
has refused to extradite him
despite the fact that he was on
probation from 1967 to 1969 and
in prison from 1969 to 1972.
Attorney General Younger
refused to explain California's
refusal to extradite DeFreeze to
New Jersey. The LAPD has even
refused to release his police file to
the press — although legally
obligated to do so — and keeps it
instead in the watch commander's
safe of the Criminal Conspiracy
Section (CCS).
The CCS employs policy agents
to infiltrate radical groups and
many times to "cook up criminal
conspiracies against militants,
particularly groups like the
Panthers, Angela Davis, and
people like that," according to
Donald Freed's The Glass House
Tapes. Louis Tackwood, an
ex-CCS agent, claims that
DeFreeze has been an agent for
the CCS since the mid-1960'5.
Not Imagined
It is obvious that these
suspicious coincidences and
proven facts cannot conclusively
prove DeFreeze's true identity
and the SLA's real purpose. Yet it
is also obvious that these are not
merely manifestations of a
radical's paranoiac imagination.
The continual police attempts
to provoke violence through
confrontation tactics and illegal
police raids and the attempts to
instigate violence from within
form a coherent pattern.
Police fear of the radical Left
could explain the SLA's creation
as a police operation. Then again,
DeFreeze and his cohorts might
merely be free-lance idiots
parroting a superficial radical
ideology to disguise basically
anti-social acts.
Discredited Left
In any case, the SLA has
cussessfully discredited much of
the Left's goals and actions and
brought negative publicity to the
radical movement. It also has
successfully supplied the legal
excuse (under the guise of grand
jury investigations) for what may
be described as a radical "witch
hunt" in the Bay Area.
A number of people have
already been called for testimony.
Several who have refused to
testify may be jailed until the
grand jury retires, with neither
crime nor trial.
As Robert Hardy, an FBI
provocateur who infiltrated,
financed, and lead the Camden
28, said in reference to his own
function: "It is a case of
manufacturing crimes to support
repressive policies and the
political futures of persons in
power."

Not Imagined
It is obvious that these
suspicious coincidences and
proven facts cannot conclusively
prove DeFreeze's true identity
and the SLA's real purpose. Yet it
is also obvious that these are not
merely manifestations of a
radical's paranoiac imagination.
The continual police attempts
to provoke violence through
confrontation tactics and illegal
police raids and the attempts to
instigate violence from within
form a coherent pattern.
Police fear of the radical Left
could explain the SLA's creation
as a police operation. Then again,
DeFreeze and his cohorts might
merely be free-lance idiots
parroting a superficial radical
ideology to disguise basically
anti-social acts.
Discredited Left
In any case, the SLA has
cussessfully discredited much of
the Left's goals and actions and
brought negative publicity to the
radical movement. It also has
successfully supplied the legal
excuse (under the guise of grand
jury investigations) for what may
be described as a radical "witch
hunt" in the Bay Area.
A number of people have
already been called for testimony.
Several who have refused to
testify may be jailed until the
grand jury retires, with neither
crime nor trial.
As Robert Hardy, an FBI
provocateur who infiltrated,
financed, and lead the Camden
28, said in reference to his own
function: "It is a case of
manufacturing crimes to support
repressive policies and the
political futures of persons in
power."

Si/ton, Gray

The sudden birth and dramatic
exploits of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) have
brought much criticism of the
radical Left in general for its
"revolutionary character." Yet
the radical Left has not benefited
either physically or politically by
the actions of the SLA.
In fact, the SLA has proven to
be counter-revolutionary in nature
and thus cannot plausibly be
linked to the Left in character or
actions.
For the murder of Marcus
Foster and the random shooting
following the bank robbery, the
SLA has been repudiated by The
Guardian, the Young Socialists,
the Black Panthers, La Raza
Unida, the United Farmworkers,
the remnants of Venceremos,
Vietnam Veterans Against the War
and almost all the remaining
elements of the Left. Yet the SLA
is continually portrayed as a
radical organization when almost
all left radicals see them as
counter-productive or indeed
reactionary.
SLA's True Nature
In light of these facts, the great
discrepancy concerning the SLA's
true nature seems difficult to
explain. Recently, though, a
number of radical sources have
cited strong evidence that suggests
that Donald DeFreeze (alias
Cinque) is in actuality a police
agent.
It is an unpleasant reality that
police use of provocateurs (not
just informers) is actually much
greater than is generally believed.
Police agents often serve
leadership roles, often supply
explosives or weapon expertise,
and usually are vocal proponents
of violence.
Proven cases include Tommy
the Traveler (Tommy Tongyai),
an outspoken advocate of violence
as an assumed SDS organizer, who
built bombs for the May X, 1970
fire-bombing of an ROTC
building; Wilbert Thomas, a New
York City police patrolman who
infiltrated the N.Y. Black
Panthers, attempting to discredit
the Panthers by linking them to a
violent robbery planned by
Thomas, Melvin "Cotton" Smith,
who infiltrated the Los Angeles
Black Panthers for the Criminal
Conspiracy Section of the LAPD,
supplying weapons and advocating
violence to entrap 13 Panthers.
Together with that of Jack
Weatherford, who infiltrated the
SDS in Columbia, S.C., supplying
leadership, advocating violence,
entrapping radicals and commiting
a number of overt violent acts,
these few cases give perspective to
the rather startling claim of
DeFreeze's identity as a policy
agent.
Known Informer
DeFreeze himself was known
in his early criminal history as a
police informer. Despite having an
arrest record since age 14, he was
not imprisoned until 1969. Before
that time, he had committed a
number of crimes including
burglary, assault with a deadly
weapon, parole violations,
attempted escape from the police
and theft of 200 weapons from an
army surplus store in Los Angeles.
In the case of the gun thefts,
DeFreeze turned in his partner,
Ronald Coleman, with a
telephone call to the police.
DeFreeze received five years
probation for the theft.
On April 20, 1969, police
picked up DeFreeze with a fully
loaded semi-automatic M-68 rifle,
along with an attached clip
containing 32 bullets. Although
he was on probation, this and two
succeeding arrests did not result in
any jail confinement. Finally he
tried to cash a fake check and was

caught as he tried to shoot his
way out.
DeFreeze ended up at Vacaville
(Medical Facility) Prison, where
he attempted to become head of
the Black Culture Association.
When rejected, he protested to the
authorities who then appointed
him chairman of his own group,
Unisight.
One of the first outside people
to participate in Unisight was
Russell Little, an alleged member
of the SLA and one of the two
white men charged with the
murder of Oakland
Superintendent of Schools Marcus
Foster.
DeFreeze was soon transferred
to Soledad Prison, from which he
escaped on March 5, 1973 when a
guard left him alone to work on a
boiler in a then-unused portion of
the minimum security facility.
Extradition Refused
Since 1965, New Jersey has
been trying to extradite DeFreeze
on kidnapping charges. California
has refused to extradite him
despite the fact that he was on
probation from 1967 to 1969 and
in prison from 1969 to 1972.
Attorney General Younger
refused to explain California's
refusal to extradite DeFreeze to
New Jersey. The LAPD has even
refused to release his police file to
the press — although legally
obligated to do so — and keeps it
instead in the watch commander's
safe of the Criminal Conspiracy
Section (CCS).
The CCS employs policy agents
to infiltrate radical groups and
many times to "cook up criminal
conspiracies against militants,
particularly groups like the
Panthers, Angela Davis, and
people like that," according to
Donald Freed's The Glass House
Tapes. Louis Tackwood, an
ex-CCS agent, claims that
DeFreeze has been an agent for
the CCS since the mid-1960'5.

suspicious coincidences and
proven facts cannot conclusively

When rejected, he protested to the
authorities who then appointed
him chairman of his own group,
Unisight.
One of the first outside people
to participate in Unisight was
Russell Little, an alleged member
of the SLA and one of the two
white men charged with the
murder of Oakland
Superintendent of Schools Marcus
Foster.
DeFreeze was soon transferred
to Soledad Prison, from which he
escaped on March 5, 1973 when a
guard left him alone to work on a
boiler in a then-unused portion of
the minimum security facility.
Extradition Refused
Since 1965, New Jersey has
been trying to extradite DeFreeze
on kidnapping charges. California
has refused to extradite him
despite the fact that he was on
probation from 1967 to 1969 and
in prison from 1969 to 1972.
Attorney General Younger
refused to explain California's
refusal to extradite DeFreeze to
New Jersey. The LAPD has even
refused to release his police file to
the press — although legally
obligated to do so — and keeps it
instead in the watch commander's
safe of the Criminal Conspiracy
Section (CCS).
The CCS employs policy agents
to infiltrate radical groups and
many times to "cook up criminal
conspiracies against militants,
particularly groups like the
Panthers, Angela Davis, and
people like that," according to
Donald Freed's The Glass House
Tapes. Louis Tackwood, an
ex-CCS agent, claims that
DeFreeze has been an agent for
the CCS since the mid-1960'5.
Not Imagined
It is obvious that these
suspicious coincidences and
proven facts cannot conclusively
prove DeFreeze's true identity
and the SLA's real purpose. Yet it
is also obvious that these are not
merely manifestations of a
radical's paranoiac imagination.
The continual police attempts
to provoke violence through
confrontation tactics and illegal
police raids and the attempts to
instigate violence from within
form a coherent pattern.
Police fear of the radical Left
could explain the SLA's creation
as a police operation. Then again,
DeFreeze and his cohorts might
merely be free-lance idiots
parroting a superficial radical
ideology to disguise basically
anti-social acts.
Discredited Left
In any case, the SLA has
cussessfully discredited much of
the Left's goals and actions and
brought negative publicity to the
radical movement. It also has
successfully supplied the legal
excuse (under the guise of grand
jury investigations) for what may
be described as a radical "witch
hunt" in the Bay Area.
A number of people have
already been called for testimony.
Several who have refused to
testify may be jailed until the
grand jury retires, with neither
crime nor trial.
As Robert Hardy, an FBI
provocateur who infiltrated,
financed, and lead the Camden
28, said in reference to his own
function: "It is a case of
manufacturing crimes to support
repressive policies and the
political futures of persons in
power."

Si/ton, Gray

The sudden birth and dramatic
exploits of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) have
brought much criticism of the
radical Left in general for its
"revolutionary character." Yet
the radical Left has not benefited
either physically or politically by
the actions of the SLA.
In fact, the SLA has proven to
be counter-revolutionary in nature
and thus cannot plausibly be
linked to the Left in character or
actions.
For the murder of Marcus
Foster and the random shooting
following the bank robbery, the
SLA has been repudiated by The
Guardian, the Young Socialists,
the Black Panthers, La Raza
Unida, the United Farmworkers,
the remnants of Venceremos,
Vietnam Veterans Against the War
and almost all the remaining
elements of the Left. Yet the SLA
is continually portrayed as a
radical organization when almost
all left radicals see them as
counter-productive or indeed
reactionary.
SLA's True Nature
In light of these facts, the great
discrepancy concerning the SLA's
true nature seems difficult to
explain. Recently, though, a
number of radical sources have
cited strong evidence that suggests
that Donald DeFreeze (alias
Cinque) is in actuality a police
agent.
It is an unpleasant reality that
police use of provocateurs (not
just informers) is actually much
greater than is generally believed.
Police agents often serve
leadership roles, often supply
explosives or weapon expertise,
and usually are vocal proponents
of violence.
Proven cases include Tommy
the Traveler (Tommy Tongyai),
an outspoken advocate of violence
as an assumed SDS organizer, who
built bombs for the May X, 1970
fire-bombing of an ROTC
building; Wilbert Thomas, a New
York City police patrolman who
infiltrated the N.Y. Black
Panthers, attempting to discredit
the Panthers by linking them to a
violent robbery planned by
Thomas, Melvin "Cotton" Smith,
who infiltrated the Los Angeles
Black Panthers for the Criminal
Conspiracy Section of the LAPD,
supplying weapons and advocating
violence to entrap 13 Panthers.
Together with that of Jack
Weatherford, who infiltrated the
SDS in Columbia, S.C., supplying
leadership, advocating violence,
entrapping radicals and commiting
a number of overt violent acts,
these few cases give perspective to
the rather startling claim of
DeFreeze's identity as a policy
agent.
Known Informer
DeFreeze himself was known
in his early criminal history as a
police informer. Despite having an
arrest record since age 14, he was
not imprisoned until 1969. Before
that time, he had committed a
number of crimes including
burglary, assault with a deadly
weapon, parole violations,
attempted escape from the police
and theft of 200 weapons from an
army surplus store in Los Angeles.
In the case of the gun thefts,
DeFreeze turned in his partner,
Ronald Coleman, with a
telephone call to the police.
DeFreeze received five years
probation for the theft.
On April 20, 1969, police
picked up DeFreeze with a fully
loaded semi-automatic M-68 rifle,
along with an attached clip
containing 32 bullets. Although
he was on probation, this and two
succeeding arrests did not result in
any jail confinement. Finally he
tried to cash a fake check and was

caught as he tried to shoot his
way out.
DeFreeze ended up at Vacaville
(Medical Facility) Prison, where
he attempted to become head of
the Black Culture Association.
When rejected, he protested to the
authorities who then appointed
him chairman of his own group,
Unisight.
One of the first outside people
