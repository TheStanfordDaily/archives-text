# USE Pickets Disrupt Campus Operation
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
United Stanford Employees (USE) picket lines yesterday
stopped virtually all deliveries to the University and halted
$20 million worth of construction at the new law school
and the hospital.
However, USE failed to shut the University down as it
had promised. The union's strike did disrupt normal
campus operations.
About 900 of the 1457 workers in the bargaining unit
struck yesterday: 350 from the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC), 430 from the central campus,
and 115 from the Medical Center.
About 250 union pickets walked lines at major campus
.acilities, including plant services, SLAC, stores and
purchasing, Reprographics, Encina Hall, physics and
electronics research laboratories, the Old Pavilion, the
commissary, the Medical Center, the steam plant and the
computation center.
Berk explained USE's strategy: "We're concentrating
this morning on three things: ail freight vehicles coming in,
jhe construction sites, and all places where our unit is
concentrated.
"The strike will roll out from there in succeeding days.
We're going to run a tough but legal strike."
Berk intimated the union may begin to picket
classrooms and academic buildings later this week.
The picket lines were calm. Supervisors and non-striking
workers crossed easily in almost all cases; policemen
watched, but did not intervene. At most, pickets threw a
few casual insults at people who crossed the lines.
A University official said 1251 students obtained cash
rebates of about $25 each from the University for one week
of meal plans. At times the line of students waiting for
rebates stretched from the Cashier's Office into White

Plaza, but by 4 p.m. everyone who wanted a refund had
received one.
The only two dining halls open, Wilbur and Stern,
operated smoothly, with only normal numbers of students
eating. Simplified menus offered cold meat and cheese
sandwiches for lunch; minute steak, potatoes and beans for
dinner.
Medical Center
At the Medical Center, pickets refused to let trucks
carrying food and linen through the lines.
USE President Jim Berk said yesterday that "we're
allowing the services that are essential for patient care
through the line — that's oxygen and blood. We're not
guaranteeing that patients won't be discomforted."
Peter Carpenter, University assistant vice president for
medical affairs, accused the union of repudiating an
agreement to allow patient care supplies through the line.
"I have yet to meet a human being who can survive on
blood and oxygen," he said.
University officials are negotiating with the union on the
hospital supply situation, but last night Berk said he would
stand firm.
Hospital spokesman Gary Cavalli said surgery schedules
may have to be curtailed in a week or 10 days, if linen
supplies are not allowed through.
At the Medical Center, groups of three or four pickets
lounged around most entrances, trying to dissuade medical
students from entering the buildings. Some medical school
classes were held outside because of the strike; most
remained inside, but none were boycotted.
Lab technicians in the medical school are members of
the bargaining unit USE represents; nurses, orderlies,
clinical lab technicians and other hospital employees are
not.

Last night Berk said he wants to force the hospital to cut
back its operations. "Doctors would be wise and socially
conscious to take their work elsewhere," he said.
He accused hospital administrators of "forcing the union
to shut down the hospital" by refusing to close the medical
school.
"We know we're interfering with patient care. We're not
interfering with vital patient care. We're trying to shut
down the medical school, and we can't shut down the
medical school without affecting the hospital," he said.
Carpenter said, "If you don't work in a hospital, it's
hard to comprehend the importance of linen" in sterile
surgical packs, the nursery, dressings, and bedding.

KZSU (90.1 FM) will broadcast special strike newscasts
at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. in addition to its regular newscasts at
8:30 a.m., 12:45, 5, 6 and 10 p.m.

"Our infection rate would go up very rapidly" if linen
service is curtailed, Carpenter claimed. He said the hospital
can temporarily cut linen consumption by 20 to 30
percent, and use some disposable linen and process some
linen at El Camino Hospital. But he says these stopgap
measures are inadequate and expensive.
Dr. Howard Waitzhen, a hospital medical fellow who
advises the union on patient care, said the hospital has
exaggerated the linen issue, because it can sterilize some of
its linen internally for emergency surgery. He admitted that
the union is willing to force the hospital to limit elective
surgery and cut its surgical schedules.
Carpenter said Berk has acted irresponsibly, and reneged
on a promise to allow patient supplies to enter. "Berk is
evidentally on a pretty big ego trip on the hospital," he
said. The union president in turn called Carpenter a

"snot-nosed kid" who has misrepresented the union
position.
Most of the 115 striking Medical Center employees work
in research labs. The only clinical activity affected was
surgical pathology, where M.D.sand Ph.D.s filled in for
striking technicians to prepare tissue samples for biopsies.
The hospital has also been unable to keep up with
autopsies because of the manpower shortage in surgical
pathology, Carpenter said.
Food Service
The food services at Wilbur and Stern operated with
one-quarter of their normal employees and a little more
than half of the normal complement of hashers.
Food service supervisors had planned to serve 1600
people dinner at Wilbur; 800 showed up, and received
seconds on minute steaks. Some hashers who reported for
work were sent home.
Barbara Bartel, assistant manager of the Wilbur food
service, said meal hours will stay the same today, but will
probably return to normal by the end of the week.
The University distributed more than $20,000 in
rebates, but pro-union sympathies apparently did not
motivate most of the applicants. Many complained about
the distance between Wilbur and Stern dining halls and west
campus residences or the reputation of Wilbur and Stern
food. Others simply welcomed a chance to eat out and to
feel cash in their pockets.
Most of those in line admitted ignorance about the issues
of the strike and USE's goals, although many of the hashers
who sought rebates voiced clear pro-union sentiments.
Some of the hashers who did work were new, hired
when the strike approached for special work.

PIED PIPER? — Cash in the pocket, a chance to eat off campus or simply convenience induced more than 1200 meal
ticket holders to collect rebates at Old Union yesterday. Some students waited over two hours to receive about $25 for a
week's meals.
Wilbur and Stern yesterday, but two of the drivers said they
might honor the picket line later this week.
Construction
Picketing at the law school construction project was
begun by about 15 students, members of the Chicano
Student Workers Support Committee. USE pickets arrived
only after the students had persuaded construction workers
not to enter the project.
At the Medical Center project, workers called their
union for instructions, and left after about two hours of
waiting.
The union apparently has not obtained strike sanction
from the local building trades council. University officials
say the construction pickets are a secondary boycott, in
violation of the law.
University lawyer James Siena said Stanford plans to
negotiate the issue with USE.
Stanford has not yet sought an injunction to bar pickets
at the sites, but attorney Siena last night noted that "if
there is illegal picketing or coercive picketing or obstructive
picketing.. .v/f will use a remedy appropriate to the
occasion."
SLAC
The largest number of pickets was concentrated at
SLAC, where one-third of the bargaining unit works. SLAC

Director Wolfgang Panofsky last night said the accelerator
beam "has been in the process of turn-on for two days. We
are starting on schedule, and we will continue on schedule."
But Panofsky admitted that engineering personnel are
filling in for striking workers. He said two of the scheduled
six experiments will be cut because of the strike.
Other Areas
Professional staff outside the bargaining unit also
maintained operations at the computation center and
advanced laboratories in physics and electrical engineering,
with some cutbacks.
At the steam plant, plant services, and university stores,
supervisory personnel maintained limited service. Plant
Services Director Dan De Young said that the response time
on utility emergencies has increased.
De Young complained of minor sabotage, mostly in the
form of intentionally clogged toilets and sewer lines in the
Quad, Memorial Auditorium, Tresidder Union, and three
houses in Stern Hall.
The sabotage began Monday night, and continued today,
but De Young said it presents no major problem.
