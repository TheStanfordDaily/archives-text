# Traits Of Conservatism III Defined
##

William Ross

Listening to columnist James J. Kilpatrick
deliver his lecture to a Stanford audience last
week, I experienced a sense of deja vu when
he explained the 10 characteristics of a
conservative. These 10 criteria were largely
the same that were outlined by my
conservative political science professor two
years ago in an introductory political science
course. I questioned the validity of
definitions then and I question them now
even more.
First, Kilpatrick stated that a conservative
must rest his political principles ultimately
on a religious creed. While it is true that
classical conservatism has often aligned itself
with established churches, the absence of a
state religion in this country seems to make
religious belief rather irrelevant in politics*
Also, there is a strong strain of religiosity and
morality in many liberal and socialist denying
conservatism a monopoly on religious
principles.
Skeptical of Utopianism
Second, Kilpatrick noted that
conservatism teaches that man cannot
achieve perfectability through any program
of the state. While this is indeed a tenet of
conservatism, I must add that few liberals
profess utopianism.
Third, Kilpatrick argued that conservatives
believe that the role of government should be
limited. This contention raises the problem
of distinguishing modern conservatism and
liberalism from their classical form. Certainly
classical liberalism propounds a stronger
belief in anti-interventionalism than classical
conservatism.
But even though modern conservatism is
often the same as classical liberalism, modern

conservatives share with liberals the belief in
limited government.
Conservatives in recent years have
demonstrated their belief in limited
government through opposition to extensive
governmental social welfare programs that
interfere with normal social and economic
balances, but liberals have often proven their
faithfulness to this concept in their defense
of civil liberties.
Federalist Identification
Fourth, Kilpatrick stated that
conservatism identifies itself with federalism,
fearing the concentration of power. While
modern American conservatives have indeed
followed this principle more than many
reformist liberals, this does not mean that the
latter oppose federalism.
Rather, liberals have used the central
government often only when the local
governments failed to protect their citizens
from social or economic abuses.
Kilpatrick also noted that conservatives
respect tradition. This nebulous argument is
too abstract to consider at length, but there
seems to be no evidence that liberals oppose
tradition or ceremony per se. But liberals do
try to eradicate those traditions that they
believe are harmful to society.
The sixth and seventh characteristics of
conservatism cited by Kilpatrick involve
belief in economic freedom and free
capitalism. Kilpatrick here identifies himself
with classical liberalism. Classical
conservatism, which advocated intervention
by the state in the affairs of the nation,
passed such laws in England as the
Speenhamland Act of 1795, which called for
state intervention in the economic lives of

the people.
But even if modern conservatism is old
liberalism, this does not mean that modern
reform liberals oppose property rights. But
they do advocate a limitation on these rights
in the interests of disadvantaged segments of
society. >
Contradictory Rights
Kilpatrick went on to state that
conservatism emphasizes that absolute
freedom and absolute equality cannot exist
because they are contradictory.. Although
Kilpatrick makes an excellent point; there is
no reason to believe that liberals oppose this
insight. The only argument seems to be the
question of degree.
Likewise, his contention that society
demands orders and ranks is not the exclusive
principle of conservatism. Liberals adhere to
it also, as does virtually every social system in
the world, if not in theory, at least in
practice.
Finally, Kilpatrick insisted that reform
and progress are not identical. Yet he is
wrong to assume that this insight belongs
exclusively to conservatives. Any rational
person opposes change unless he believes that
some benefit will be derived from it.
Kilpatrick is right however to note that
conservatives are more wary of change than
liberals and are more inclined to
incrementalism in the solving of problems.
Hence, while Kilpatrick identified the
traits of conservatives, his generalizations
failed to present a philosophy that is distinct
from the other forms of political thought
prevalent in the United States today.
