# Wages And Administration Policy

(This article was written before
the USE strike began.)
In response to Patricia Nash's
letter (Daily, May 2), I too am a
staff member in a secretarial
position and have been employed
by many institutions including
another university and a national
bank. University administration
and policies are something I've
been acquainted with for at least
five years. While at the bank, I
had joined their Union, too.
Because we have had similar
employment situations, I would
like to pose a few questions to
Nash and point out a few things:
Have you really researched WHAT
your wage could be judged as
"fair by community standards"?
Last September, there was an
"adjustment" to the pay scales.
You may have heard that each
of the six-step increments was
raised to four and a half percent,
but did you know that two and a
half percent was lopped off that
by lowering the end of the
programmed progress zone a half
step?
Again, next September, there's
planned to be another increase for
nonexempt employees, which
includes secretaries. However, the
University has allowed for only a
seven percent increase in salaries
paid to these secretaries, while the
cost of living has risen 10 percent!
This means, we'll be short three
percent by then and undoubtedly
be poorer than we were in
September 1973.
Below-Standard Wages
This is how the University
"skirts" cost-of-living and only
meets "market conditions," which
does not necessarily mean
community standards.
As far as optional time off, it
may interest you to know that
one supervisor in the Jackson
Library was until recently
requiring employees to make up
the time that they took off for
personal business. Collectively,

the staff there confronted the
Personal Department with the
Library's abuse of this University
policy to a point where the
supervisor finally acquiesced to
the demands of the Library staff.
Regarding the medical
insurance plans, only the
employee's premium is paid by
the University. If she/he has three
dependents, there is
approximately $36-38 deducted
from the monthly salary. For
some clerical and those other
low-paying jobs, say, as low as
$426 per month — which, by the
way, is the University's minimum
wage — this is a big chunk out of
one's paycheck.
Community Privileges
You mention the use of the
libraries, discount travel,
recreational facilities and
"aesthetic value" — I have only a
vague idea of what you mean by
that. Keep in mind that Stanford
is also a community, in some ways
considered much the same as the
community of Palo Alto.
Residents can have access to all
of the above because they live in a
certain community, but this has
nothing to do with Stanford
University policies and
procedures.
I don't find it hard to believe
that you haven't seen any
anti-union propaganda because
you can't recognize it when you
see it. It doesn't seem you've
allowed yourself to be exposed to
all the issues at stake.
There is no hostility being
created by the Union; if you've
ever talked to people in those
low-paying positions, you'd
realize the hostility has always
been there — even for people
who've worked here for 10 to 15
years, and it's because they're
being paid PKANUTS!
Dissatisfied With Policy
Our dissatisfactions may not
necessarily be with our individual
immediate supervisors. It's with

the overall policies of the
University administration which
directly or indirectly affect out
lives.
I don't know how long you've
been here or how long you intend
to stay, but one of the demands
to be negotiated separately by
USE on behalf of NON-UNIT
personnel (professional and
clerical) is that the pension plan
for non-exempt people be paid at
the 10 percent level (which
exempt personnel already have)
instead of the present six percent.
If you still think your wage is fair
and life idyllic here at Stanford,
think twice about that!
Reading Union handouts out
of context, I'd feel co erced and
intimidated, too, if I was not
exposed to the issues on both
sides. Compare the two opposing
handouts on "Employees Rights

During a Strike." Remember the
Union is trying to organize for a
strike. USE's handout "tells it like
it is."
The University's handout is
woven around pretty words that
essentially say nothing. Didn't
you notice anything co-ercive
about the spectre of being
"permanently replaced" if you
support the strike?
Basically, it seems to me you're
saying, "I've got my own" and
you feel satisfied that crossing the
picket line is going to insure that
position. But if anything, you'll
only be insuring your staying at
the same wage and benefit level.
And personally, by NOT delving
into the issues at hand, you'll be
insuring your remaining at the
same level of awareness.
