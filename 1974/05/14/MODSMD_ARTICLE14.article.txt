Deficit Spending
Editor:
While Jeffrey Wood was
well-intentioned in asking whether
USE had taken into consideration
the effects of costly demandÂ®,
upon those of us outside of USE,
he did make a factual blunder
which 1 wish to correct. Pay raises
granted to unions are not a
significant, much less a major,
cause of inflation. The unionized
areas of the economy are running
behind, rather than ahead off
inflation.
The only major contributor to
our disastrous inflation rate is the
deficit spending found in each
fiscal budget of the federal
government. The effect of deficit
spending is simply to decrease the
value (in terms of goods and
services) of the cash held by
citizens by an amount
proportional to the size of the
deficit relative to the amount of
cash circulating.
Deficit spending is, through
inflation, a very regressive form oU
taxation. It is the form of
taxation best fitted to destroying
the economic independence of the
citizenry.
It might be borne in mind that
labor unions are unlikely to
benefit from bankruptcies and
unemployment caused by inflation,
but the federal government will be
called upon to assume more and
more power to "cope" with these
deficit induced disasters.

John Newcomb's column
"Solitary Strike" (Daily, May 7)
struck an inner chord with me. Its
intensely personal character
differed significantly from so
much of the rhetoric which
surrounds current employee
relations issues. I accepted
Newcomb's invitation, and he and
I discussed his feelings over lunch
the day his column appeared. It is
not, however, this aspect of his
statement about which I wish to
comment.
The feature that distinguished
his letter from others was that it
spoke to a deepening current in
the University that will continue
to have force long after present
employee issues are resolved. I
share Newcomb's concern
over loss of personalism in the
University. I should add that as
our country and our world have
grown in population and
complexity, rapid
communications have helped
further to reduce the area ir\
which we can maintain our
individuality. In a sense, we all
have greater social limits on our
freedom, and there is more
competition when we try to be
individuals. In short, our world is
crowded. As a result, we are al>
reduced to being more private to
protect our inner selves from
being pushed and shoved by those
around us.
Some of the loss of
personalism at Stanford is
certainly a result of the
University's growth, but it seem;
to me that there is more to the
matter than size alone. I view
Stanford as a community not in
the legal or governmental sense,
but as a collection of people who
share common values and goals,
the most important of which are
the pursuits of excellence ant
truth.
I sometimes feel that we fail to
apply these values to our
relationships with others and that
our failure to do so compounds
the problems of size by obscuring
the uniqueness of individual
members of our community.
University officers alone cannot
restore personalism to Stanford. It
will take the concerted efforts of
all of us to reopen the communal
Stanford heart.
I do not believe that the
situation is hopeless, that Wf
cannot control our own destiny. /
do not believe that we are helpless
to do anything but bemoan our
common fate.
Having come to Stanford just
three years ago from the much
more depersonalized world of
New York City, I have found i
the kind of institution in which
people count for far more than
abstractions. That was what
attracted me here in the first
place, and while it is not a perfect
world, it is far better than most.
We each have different
responsibilities to ourselves and to
others, but in respecting our
common goals and values and in
taking the initiative in serving
ourselves and others, I have faith
that this community can rise to
the challenge.
