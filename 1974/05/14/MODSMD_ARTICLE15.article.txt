# The 						USE Strike: General Overview
## 
### DON COX 
USE is demanding average
economic gains of 22.75 percent
for the bargaining unit it
represents. By USE's own
approximations, this would boost
the wage base for the unit from
$12.9 to almost $16 million per
year.
The University claims the
actual wage and benefit base for
the unit is currently about $15
million and that USE's figure of
Â£12.9 million does not take into
account benefits such as social
security and workman's
compensation.
The University has responded
to the union demands with an
offer to give workers wage
increases averaging about seven
percent, thereby boosting the
unit's wage base by about
$750,000.
Union estimates of the cost of
its economic package are
somewhat conservative, University
negotiators say. Union demands
represent at least a 25 percent
increase in the unit's wage base,
according to University estimates.
USE's demands for a higher
monthly minimum pay, a cost of
living escalator and a community
standards concept make up about
two-thirds of the $2.2 million
differences separating the two parties.
Higher Rates?
Director of University Housing
Ed Scoles commented that
1974-75 room and board rates,
recently released, would have to
be reevaluated if the University is
forced to give the union two
percent more in any settlement.
Barton noted that most of the
bargaining unit is not paid
through funds provided by tuition
but that the "ripple effect" of any
USE settlement on other wages
within the University provides "a
considerable linkup."
Berk said that while he didn't
know what effect wage increases
given to the union would have on
tuition, he did not "want to see
workers and students fighting over
how to divvy up the spoils."
Little Agreement
There have been nearly 50
negotiating sessions since
mid-November when USE

submitted its contract proposal,
yet not a single article in the
contract has been signed off.
Negotiators will probably be
meeting daily this week but both
sides have conceded they are still
very far apart and negotiations
could drag on for a number of
weeks.
Negotiations have been
unusually complicated and
tedious due to the diversified
nature of the bargaining unit.
In addition, both parties are
new to the negotiating business
and new to each other.
Sanctioning
USE has been granted strike
sanction by the San Mateo and
Santa Clara Central Labor
Councils AFL-CIO, Teamsters
locals. USE is also seeking strike
sanction from the Teamsters Joint
Council.
The teamsters make deliveries
to campus.
Sanctioning unions usually
agree not to cross union picket
lines.
Effectiveness
In part, the effectiveness of the
strike will depend on how many
unit members who are not
members of USE cross picket
lines.
At present, of about 1400
members of the technical,
maintenance and service unit,
only about 860 are dues-paying
USE members. Whether unit
members will be allowed to not
belong to the union after a
contract is signed is being
negotiated (see related story on
issues).
While not all unit members
belong to the union, not all union
members belong to the unit,
including USE President Jim Berk,
an electrical engineer at SLAC.
There are about 240 workers in
this category.
Workers who are not in the
official bargaining unit may be
disciplined by the University if
they strike. Unit members' jobs
are protected by law. USE is
demanding general amnesty for all
workers who strike
