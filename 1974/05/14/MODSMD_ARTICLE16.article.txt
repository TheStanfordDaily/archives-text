# History Of USE: 1969-74
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
In less than five years, United Stanford
Employees (USE) has evolved from a leftist splinter
group of another union to a powerful organization
which officially represents 1400 employees.
In the summer of 1969, the Stanford Employees
Association (SEA) sought to affiliate with the
California School Employees Association (CSEA).
Thirteen of the SEA's members opposed this
affiliation with a politically conservative group
which had opposed the antiwar demonstrations of
the spring. The SEA suspended these members,
who then formed their own union — USE.
USE organized in January of 1970. At that time,
and for the next three years, USE concentrated its
activities on opposing layoffs and firings of workers
and trying to ensure that workers with grievances
received what it considered to be fair hearings.
In the fall of 1970, USE participated in NLRB
hearings to determine an appropriate bargaining
unit. USE's position was that all workers, whether
hospital, clerical or blue-collar, should be
considered part of the same bargaining unit. This
was also the stated position of University President
Richard Lyman, though USE at that time publicly
doubted Lyman's sincerity.
Eventually, in January, 1972 the NLRB defined
the bargaining unit about as it is today.
USE, along with Teamsters local 854 and the
CSEA-SEA, participated in a March, 1972 election.
During the campaign, SEA President Mike Fineo
described USE as a basically political organization,
and both rival groups tried to paint USE as
"communist."
USE's platform in this election opposed the
concept of a union shop. Jim Berk, president then
as now (his wife. Glenda Jones, served a one-year
term which ended last November), was one of the

leading advocates of this open-shop proposal, which
the Teamsters ridiculed.

USE finished a bad third in the March election
to the no union choice and the Teamsters. The
Teamsters were bitterly opposed by USE and SEA,
and lost 894 to 372 in the runoff.
Before the next year's election, USE corrected
what was considered a major flaw by advocates of a
hard-line union — its lack of a national affiliation.
After meeting with several groups, USE leadership
chose to affiliate with the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU), a member of the
AFL-CIO. USE membership approved this
affiliation 223 to 15.
The SEIU, which has been active in calling
strikes in California, is noted for allowing its
members locals a maximum of autonomy. USE
became its own local, number 680.
By the time of the June 6, 1972 labor election,
all of USE's rivals had dropped out of the picture.
With only two alternatives to choose from, the
eligible workers chose USE over no union, 660 to
494.
Contract Demands
USE spent the summer and early fall months
formulating a set of contract demands, which it
presented to the University Nov. 9, 1973. The
University presented a counter-offer Dec. 14.
After months of slow progress, USE suspended
negotiations April 1. It then presented the
University's offer to its members in an April 11
meeting. The workers rejected each of 10 planks,
and also chose a new set of prioritiesi
After another two weeks of bargaining, the USE
negotiating committee asked the membership to
sanction a strike. It did so on May 3 by a 613 to
218 vote. The turnout represented 97 percent of
the eligible members. The negotiating committee
immediately set May 13 as the date for a strike.

218 vote. The turnout represented 97 percent of
the eligible members. The negotiating committee
immediately set May 13 as the date for a strike.
In less than five years, United Stanford
Employees (USE) has evolved from a leftist splinter
group of another union to a powerful organization
which officially represents 1400 employees.
In the summer of 1969, the Stanford Employees
Association (SEA) sought to affiliate with the
California School Employees Association (CSEA).
Thirteen of the SEA's members opposed this
affiliation with a politically conservative group
which had opposed the antiwar demonstrations of
the spring. The SEA suspended these members,
who then formed their own union — USE.
USE organized in January of 1970. At that time,
and for the next three years, USE concentrated its
activities on opposing layoffs and firings of workers
and trying to ensure that workers with grievances
received what it considered to be fair hearings.
In the fall of 1970, USE participated in NLRB
hearings to determine an appropriate bargaining
unit. USE's position was that all workers, whether
hospital, clerical or blue-collar, should be
considered part of the same bargaining unit. This
was also the stated position of University President
Richard Lyman, though USE at that time publicly
doubted Lyman's sincerity.
Eventually, in January, 1972 the NLRB defined
the bargaining unit about as it is today.
USE, along with Teamsters local 854 and the
CSEA-SEA, participated in a March, 1972 election.
During the campaign, SEA President Mike Fineo
described USE as a basically political organization,
and both rival groups tried to paint USE as
"communist."
USE's platform in this election opposed the
concept of a union shop. Jim Berk, president then
as now (his wife. Glenda Jones, served a one-year
term which ended last November), was one of the

leading advocates of this open-shop proposal, which
the Teamsters ridiculed.

USE finished a bad third in the March election
to the no union choice and the Teamsters. The
Teamsters were bitterly opposed by USE and SEA,
and lost 894 to 372 in the runoff.
Before the next year's election, USE corrected
what was considered a major flaw by advocates of a
hard-line union — its lack of a national affiliation.
After meeting with several groups, USE leadership
chose to affiliate with the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU), a member of the
AFL-CIO. USE membership approved this
affiliation 223 to 15.
The SEIU, which has been active in calling
strikes in California, is noted for allowing its
members locals a maximum of autonomy. USE
became its own local, number 680.
By the time of the June 6, 1972 labor election,
all of USE's rivals had dropped out of the picture.
With only two alternatives to choose from, the
eligible workers chose USE over no union, 660 to
494.
Contract Demands
USE spent the summer and early fall months
formulating a set of contract demands, which it
presented to the University Nov. 9, 1973. The
University presented a counter-offer Dec. 14.
After months of slow progress, USE suspended
negotiations April 1. It then presented the
University's offer to its members in an April 11
meeting. The workers rejected each of 10 planks,
and also chose a new set of prioritiesi
After another two weeks of bargaining, the USE
negotiating committee asked the membership to
sanction a strike. It did so on May 3 by a 613 to
218 vote. The turnout represented 97 percent of
the eligible members. The negotiating committee
immediately set May 13 as the date for a strike.
