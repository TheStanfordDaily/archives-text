# The 						USE-University Dispute
## 
### DON COX 
The following is a brief
synopsis of the main strike issues
USE has designated.
While the University
negotiators agree that they are
indeed issues of fundamental
importance, there are a number of
related issues that the University
would like to see cleaned up first.
The University says those
issues will have an impact on the
economic package and that the
University's economic offers
might be improved following the
resolution of these cost-related
issues.
They cite hiring practices and
policies, internal transfers and
mobility of unit workers,
scheduling of hours, mobility
between job classifications, and
layoff procedures as all critical in
determining the scope of other
economic offers.
Minimum Pay
The minimum pay section of
USE's proposed contract calls for
a bottom line of $600 per month.
The lowest paid workers in the
unit, food service employees,
currently receive $408 per month.
The University announced last
week that it has offered a $500
per year minimum pay rate with a
$25 raise after the first year.
USE's demand translates into a
2.2 percent, or about a $280,000
increase of the unit's wage base.
The union asserts that this is the
minimum liveable wage for the
Bay Area and that it compares
closely with government figures.
Berk has said that he considers
the present minimum of $408 per
month to be a method of "racist"
exploitation of the third-world
workers who fill many of the jobs.
The University has said that it
does not oppose new minimum
pay rates but insists on
negotiating the minimum rate for
each job classification
individually.
Cost of Living
USE has proposed a cost of
living escalator clause which
would boost worker's pay $6 per
month per point increase in the
consumer price index (CPI),
retroactive to Sept. 1, 1973.
The union says the clause is
necessary to protect the workers

from the inflationary climate in
the country. USE asserts that the
CPI will accurately reflect price
increase necessities for which
workers of all incomes must spend
similar amounts.
The proposal would increase
the unit's wage base by about 5.5
percent or about $713,000.
The University says there is no
question that the workers have
suffered a real decline in income
because of the upsurge in the cost
of living.
However, the University says it
is in the same squeeze and that it
has no cost of living escalators on
its main sources of income —
tuition, investments and
government grants.
Bargaining unit members
would normally have received a
4-5 percent cost of living wage
increase last September but did
not since they were involved in
negotiating a contract. Thus unit
members have not received a cost
of living pay increase for well over
a year said Berk.
Berk estimated that the
escalator sought by the union
would add an average of $75 per
month per employee during
1974-75.
The government is currently
revising the CPI to cover retired
persons, self-employed workers
and the unemployed, in addition
to the workers now constituting
the base of the index.
Berk concedes that USE's
escalator clause might be
weakened by the broader index
since a broadened index would
probably fluctuate much less,
thereby reducing the amount of
extra cost-of-living pay it might
have produced for the workers in
the past.
Community Standards
Perhaps the widest gulf
between the two sides is created
by the union's community
standards concept.
USE wants the University to
raise wages on a job-for-job basis
to the 75th percentile of what
workers outside the University are
making. This would mean that the
union's plumbers', technicaians'
and other workers' salaries would
rank in the top 25 percent of the
market as a whole.
The union's rationale is that
since the University is not a
profit-making corporation which
has to hold wages down, it should
try to pay its workers fairly.
Berk has said the7sthpercentile
was chosen because jobs at the
University generally call for a
wider variety of skills than do
outside jobs and thus Stanford
employees, on the average, are of
a higher caliber and should be
paid appropriately.
Both Palo Alto and San
Francisco city employees are
above the 75th percentile, Berk
said.
The community standards
concept would entail a 33 percent
in the unit's wage base over four
years. The 8.3 percent increase in
the first year would cost the
University about $1.1 million.
The four years together could
mean a $10 million increase in the
wage base the University says.
The University has said it is
willing to look at the market and
assess where University employees
stand with respect to the entire
economic package.
The enormous cost of the
community standards provision
arises from the fact that most of
the workers who would receive
large increases are already in
higher income ranges.
University officials emphasize
that Stanford can't afford such
provisions.
The union, however, does not
want to see its lower income

workers receive substantially
larger wage increases than its more
skilled workers.
Shop
USE reduced its demand for a
union shop late last week and is
now asking for an agency shop as
an alternative.
There is little difference
between the two shops. In an
agency shop, all workers in the
bargaining unit must pay union
dues but do not have to actually
join the union if they do not wish.
A union shop requires that all
unit members be dues-paying
members of the union.
USE says that since law
requires that unit members receive
the same gains whether they are
union members or not, all should
pay dues.
The University has offered a
modified union shop. This
requires all workers hired after the
contract is signed to join the
union. Any unit member who
does not belong to the union
when the contract is signed need
not join or rejoin.
USE objects to this
counter-offer since any worker
could resign from the union just
before the contract is signed to
avoid paying union dues and yet
receive the full benefits of the
negotiated contract.
USE also asserts that since the
University gave the firefighters
union an agency shop in a
contract negotiated last year, the
University should similarly give
one to USE.
University officials say
however, that in unionization
elections the firefighters
were unanimous in their decision
while a significant portion of the
bargaining unit USE represents
voted against unionization.
Because those workers came to
Stanford not anticipating the
objections or burden of paying
union dues, it would not be fair to
impose those dues on them now,
the University argues.
University officials add that it
should be up to the union to
recruit its members and not the
University's duty.
USE's proposed shop could
require that students employed in
jobs within the bargaining unit
become members of USE.
The University's proposed
modified union shop would allow
students working as a part of their
financial aid program to remain
independent of the union.
USE has said it wants students
doing work within the unit to
receive equal pay. It sees no
distinction between students and
regular workers who do the same
work.
The NLRB definition of the
bargaining unit USE represents
did not, for the most part, include
students.
Maintenance of Standards
The maintenance of standards
clause is a major non-economic
issue that has been stalling
negotiations for some time.
The clause would prevent the
University from altering working
conditions for the worse — as
defined by the union.
Specifically, the union
demands that: "The University
agrees that all conditions of
employment relating to wages,
hours of work, and general
working conditions be maintained
at not less than the highest
standards in effect at the time of
the signing of this agreement, and
that conditions of employment
shall be improved whenever
specific provisions for
improvement are made in this
agreement."
The union offered last week to
limit the clause to "all significant
conditions of employment," to

practices current since July 1,
1973, and to protect local
privileges but not extend them to
the unit as a whole.
The University refuses to "give
them a blank check" to guarantee
any particular practice by the
University. Stanford officials see
the clause as insurance for the
union in case union negotiators
forget to include something in the
contract.
University negotiators use the
classic "building in the parking
lot" example to illustrate how
they feel the clause would
unfairly restrict the University.
They say that if the University
wanted to construct a building in
a parking lot that union
employees currently park in, that
the union might claim the extra
distance that employees might be
forced to walk to work
constituted a degradation of
working conditions and would be
therefore prohibited.
USE insists that it would be
reasonable with regard to the
application of this clause.
Job-Related Discipline
The union is seeking a contract
clause prohibiting disciplinary
action against workers for
non-job-related activities.
The University says it must
have the right to discipline
workers but has offered to
substitute a "just cause" clause
and arbitration procedure to cope
with any disagreements that might
arise.
The University would thus be
forced to show just cause why it
had disciplined a worker. The
decision could be appealed by the
worker to an outside arbitrator.
This procedure is common
practice in contracts, the
University says, in order to avoid
"sticky" language in attempting
to lay out workers' rights.
USE insists, however, that
employees' rights should be
spelled out in the contract to
protect them against unfair
disciplinary actions.
Pension Plan
USE's pension plan calls for a
contribution by the University of
10 percent, equal to that which
professional employees of the
University now receive.
Unit members now receive six
percent and the union claims it is
inequitable to pay the
professional workers more.
University officials say that
they are trying to structure the
benefits and then determine the
cost while USE would set the
contribution rate and then see
what it will buy, an annuity type
of plan.
USE also calls for a minimum
pension payment of $250 per
month.
The University claims this
retirement plan is extravagent and
that it would provide income
benefits substantially in excess of
the highest rate earned while

working.
The union's proposed pension
plan would boost the unit's wage
base by 4.7 percent or about
$500,000, according to union
figures.
Layoffs
If lack of work forces a layoff,
USE wants the worker with the
least seniority in the classification
in question to be laid off with
severance pay.
The University insists it must
have the right to reduce the
working staff in the area needed
by the amount necessary and that
seniority shouldn't govern who is
laid off but rather ability.
University officials said last
week that they would be willing
to compromise on this point to
the extent that seniority would
govern policy when the skill and
ability of workers in question
were about equal.
Medical Plan
USE wants a medical plan
covering all workers and their
dependants paid for by the
University.
By USE's estimates the
proposal would boost the unit's
wage base by 2.2 percent or about
$286,000.
The University is opposed to
the plan although it has suggested
it might agree to something more
than the present plan, depending
on the outcome of other
economic and cost-related items.
USE has offered a family
dental plan as an alternative to the
dependants' medical coverage.
Sick Leave
The union is asking for
unlimited sick leave after the first
year of service.
The University contends that
such a plan is next to unheard of.
USE says that those workers
who need extended illness
coverage should be able to get it.
USE notes that the unlimited paid
leave is for serious illnesses only
and that IBM has a similar
unlimited sick leave provision.
Settled Issues
Some issues have been settled,
but not many.
USE and the University agreed
to one additional paid holiday for
unit members—their birthday or
other day designated by the
worker and approved.
The two sides are close to
agreement on the grievance
procedure to be used to settle
disputes between workers and
management.
USE has tentatively agreed to
keep the current vacation plan —
three weeks of vacation per year
for the first ten years of service
and four weeks thereafter,
according to University officials.
Other small parts of the
contract articles have been
tentatively agreed upon, but no
article as a whole has been signed
off yet.
The following is a brief
synopsis of the main strike issues
USE has designated.
While the University
negotiators agree that they are
indeed issues of fundamental
importance, there are a number of
related issues that the University
would like to see cleaned up first.
The University says those
issues will have an impact on the
economic package and that the

policies, internal transfers and
mobility of unit workers,
scheduling of hours, mobility
between job classifications, and
layoff procedures as all critical in

Cost of Living

would add an average of $75 per
month per employee during
1974-75.
The government is currently

said.

years. The 8.3 percent increase in

USE also asserts that since the
University gave the firefighters
union an agency shop in a
contract negotiated last year, the
University should similarly give
one to USE.
University officials say
however, that in unionization
elections the firefighters
were unanimous in their decision
while a significant portion of the
bargaining unit USE represents
voted against unionization.
Because those workers came to
Stanford not anticipating the
objections or burden of paying
union dues, it would not be fair to
impose those dues on them now,
the University argues.
University officials add that it
should be up to the union to
recruit its members and not the
University's duty.
USE's proposed shop could
require that students employed in
jobs within the bargaining unit
become members of USE.
The University's proposed
modified union shop would allow
students working as a part of their
financial aid program to remain
independent of the union.
USE has said it wants students
doing work within the unit to
receive equal pay. It sees no
distinction between students and
regular workers who do the same
work.
The NLRB definition of the
bargaining unit USE represents
did not, for the most part, include
students.
Maintenance of Standards
The maintenance of standards
clause is a major non-economic
issue that has been stalling
negotiations for some time.
The clause would prevent the
University from altering working
conditions for the worse — as
defined by the union.
Specifically, the union
demands that: "The University
agrees that all conditions of
employment relating to wages,
hours of work, and general
working conditions be maintained
at not less than the highest
standards in effect at the time of
the signing of this agreement, and
that conditions of employment
shall be improved whenever
specific provisions for
improvement are made in this
agreement."
The union offered last week to
limit the clause to "all significant
conditions of employment," to

practices current since July 1,
1973, and to protect local
privileges but not extend them to
the unit as a whole.
The University refuses to "give
them a blank check" to guarantee
any particular practice by the
University. Stanford officials see
the clause as insurance for the
union in case union negotiators
forget to include something in the
contract.
University negotiators use the
classic "building in the parking
lot" example to illustrate how
they feel the clause would
unfairly restrict the University.
They say that if the University
wanted to construct a building in
a parking lot that union
employees currently park in, that
the union might claim the extra
distance that employees might be
forced to walk to work
constituted a degradation of
working conditions and would be
therefore prohibited.
USE insists that it would be
reasonable with regard to the
application of this clause.
Job-Related Discipline
The union is seeking a contract
clause prohibiting disciplinary
action against workers for
non-job-related activities.
The University says it must
have the right to discipline
workers but has offered to
substitute a "just cause" clause
and arbitration procedure to cope
with any disagreements that might
arise.
The University would thus be
forced to show just cause why it
had disciplined a worker. The
decision could be appealed by the
worker to an outside arbitrator.
This procedure is common
practice in contracts, the
University says, in order to avoid
"sticky" language in attempting
to lay out workers' rights.
USE insists, however, that
employees' rights should be
spelled out in the contract to
protect them against unfair
disciplinary actions.
Pension Plan
USE's pension plan calls for a
contribution by the University of
10 percent, equal to that which
professional employees of the
University now receive.
Unit members now receive six
percent and the union claims it is
inequitable to pay the
professional workers more.
University officials say that
they are trying to structure the
benefits and then determine the
cost while USE would set the
contribution rate and then see
what it will buy, an annuity type
of plan.
USE also calls for a minimum
pension payment of $250 per
month.
The University claims this
retirement plan is extravagent and
that it would provide income
benefits substantially in excess of
the highest rate earned while

working.
The union's proposed pension
plan would boost the unit's wage
base by 4.7 percent or about
$500,000, according to union
figures.
Layoffs
If lack of work forces a layoff,
USE wants the worker with the
least seniority in the classification
in question to be laid off with
severance pay.
The University insists it must
have the right to reduce the
working staff in the area needed
by the amount necessary and that
seniority shouldn't govern who is
laid off but rather ability.
University officials said last
week that they would be willing
to compromise on this point to
the extent that seniority would
govern policy when the skill and
ability of workers in question
were about equal.
Medical Plan
USE wants a medical plan
covering all workers and their
dependants paid for by the
University.
By USE's estimates the
proposal would boost the unit's
wage base by 2.2 percent or about
$286,000.
The University is opposed to
the plan although it has suggested
it might agree to something more
than the present plan, depending
on the outcome of other
economic and cost-related items.
USE has offered a family
dental plan as an alternative to the
dependants' medical coverage.
Sick Leave
The union is asking for
unlimited sick leave after the first
year of service.
The University contends that
such a plan is next to unheard of.
USE says that those workers
who need extended illness
coverage should be able to get it.
USE notes that the unlimited paid
leave is for serious illnesses only
and that IBM has a similar
unlimited sick leave provision.
Settled Issues
Some issues have been settled,
but not many.
USE and the University agreed
to one additional paid holiday for
unit members—their birthday or
other day designated by the
worker and approved.
The two sides are close to
agreement on the grievance
procedure to be used to settle
disputes between workers and
management.
USE has tentatively agreed to
keep the current vacation plan —
three weeks of vacation per year
for the first ten years of service
and four weeks thereafter,
according to University officials.
Other small parts of the
contract articles have been
tentatively agreed upon, but no
article as a whole has been signed
off yet.
The following is a brief
synopsis of the main strike issues
USE has designated.
While the University
negotiators agree that they are
indeed issues of fundamental
importance, there are a number of
related issues that the University
would like to see cleaned up first.
The University says those
issues will have an impact on the
economic package and that the
University's economic offers
might be improved following the
resolution of these cost-related
issues.
They cite hiring practices and
policies, internal transfers and
mobility of unit workers,
scheduling of hours, mobility
between job classifications, and
layoff procedures as all critical in
determining the scope of other
economic offers.
Minimum Pay
The minimum pay section of
USE's proposed contract calls for
a bottom line of $600 per month.
The lowest paid workers in the
unit, food service employees,
currently receive $408 per month.
The University announced last
week that it has offered a $500
per year minimum pay rate with a
$25 raise after the first year.
USE's demand translates into a
2.2 percent, or about a $280,000
increase of the unit's wage base.
The union asserts that this is the
minimum liveable wage for the
Bay Area and that it compares
closely with government figures.
Berk has said that he considers
the present minimum of $408 per
month to be a method of "racist"
exploitation of the third-world
workers who fill many of the jobs.
The University has said that it
does not oppose new minimum
pay rates but insists on
negotiating the minimum rate for
each job classification
individually.
Cost of Living
USE has proposed a cost of
living escalator clause which
would boost worker's pay $6 per
month per point increase in the
consumer price index (CPI),
retroactive to Sept. 1, 1973.
The union says the clause is
necessary to protect the workers

from the inflationary climate in
the country. USE asserts that the
CPI will accurately reflect price
increase necessities for which
workers of all incomes must spend
similar amounts.
The proposal would increase
the unit's wage base by about 5.5
percent or about $713,000.
The University says there is no
question that the workers have
suffered a real decline in income
because of the upsurge in the cost
of living.
However, the University says it
is in the same squeeze and that it
has no cost of living escalators on
its main sources of income —
tuition, investments and
government grants.
Bargaining unit members
would normally have received a
4-5 percent cost of living wage
increase last September but did
not since they were involved in
negotiating a contract. Thus unit
members have not received a cost
of living pay increase for well over
a year said Berk.
Berk estimated that the
escalator sought by the union
would add an average of $75 per
month per employee during
1974-75.
The government is currently
revising the CPI to cover retired
persons, self-employed workers
and the unemployed, in addition
to the workers now constituting
the base of the index.
Berk concedes that USE's
escalator clause might be
weakened by the broader index
since a broadened index would
probably fluctuate much less,
thereby reducing the amount of
extra cost-of-living pay it might
have produced for the workers in
the past.
Community Standards
Perhaps the widest gulf
between the two sides is created
by the union's community
standards concept.
USE wants the University to
raise wages on a job-for-job basis
to the 75th percentile of what
workers outside the University are
making. This would mean that the
union's plumbers', technicaians'
and other workers' salaries would
rank in the top 25 percent of the
market as a whole.
The union's rationale is that
since the University is not a
profit-making corporation which
has to hold wages down, it should
try to pay its workers fairly.
Berk has said the7sthpercentile
was chosen because jobs at the
University generally call for a
wider variety of skills than do
outside jobs and thus Stanford
employees, on the average, are of
a higher caliber and should be
paid appropriately.
Both Palo Alto and San
Francisco city employees are
above the 75th percentile, Berk
said.
The community standards
concept would entail a 33 percent
in the unit's wage base over four
years. The 8.3 percent increase in
the first year would cost the
University about $1.1 million.
The four years together could
mean a $10 million increase in the
wage base the University says.
The University has said it is
willing to look at the market and
assess where University employees
stand with respect to the entire
economic package.
The enormous cost of the
community standards provision
arises from the fact that most of
the workers who would receive
large increases are already in
higher income ranges.
University officials emphasize
that Stanford can't afford such
provisions.
The union, however, does not
want to see its lower income

workers receive substantially
larger wage increases than its more
skilled workers.
Shop
USE reduced its demand for a
union shop late last week and is
now asking for an agency shop as
an alternative.
There is little difference
between the two shops. In an
agency shop, all workers in the
bargaining unit must pay union
dues but do not have to actually
join the union if they do not wish.
A union shop requires that all
unit members be dues-paying
members of the union.
USE says that since law
requires that unit members receive
the same gains whether they are
union members or not, all should
pay dues.
The University has offered a
modified union shop. This
requires all workers hired after the
contract is signed to join the
union. Any unit member who
does not belong to the union
when the contract is signed need
not join or rejoin.
USE objects to this
counter-offer since any worker
could resign from the union just
before the contract is signed to
avoid paying union dues and yet
receive the full benefits of the
negotiated contract.
USE also asserts that since the
University gave the firefighters
union an agency shop in a
contract negotiated last year, the
University should similarly give
one to USE.
University officials say
however, that in unionization
elections the firefighters
were unanimous in their decision
while a significant portion of the
bargaining unit USE represents
voted against unionization.
Because those workers came to
Stanford not anticipating the
objections or burden of paying
union dues, it would not be fair to
impose those dues on them now,
the University argues.
University officials add that it
should be up to the union to
recruit its members and not the
University's duty.
USE's proposed shop could
require that students employed in
jobs within the bargaining unit
become members of USE.
The University's proposed
modified union shop would allow
students working as a part of their
financial aid program to remain
independent of the union.
USE has said it wants students
doing work within the unit to
receive equal pay. It sees no
distinction between students and
regular workers who do the same
work.
The NLRB definition of the
bargaining unit USE represents
did not, for the most part, include
students.

keep the current vacation plan —
three weeks of vacation per year
for the first ten years of service
and four weeks thereafter,
according to University officials.
Other small parts of the
contract articles have been
tentatively agreed upon, but no
article as a whole has been signed
off yet.
The following is a brief
synopsis of the main strike issues
USE has designated.
While the University
negotiators agree that they are
indeed issues of fundamental
importance, there are a number of
related issues that the University
would like to see cleaned up first.
The University says those
issues will have an impact on the
economic package and that the
University's economic offers
might be improved following the
resolution of these cost-related
issues.
They cite hiring practices and
policies, internal transfers and
mobility of unit workers,
scheduling of hours, mobility
between job classifications, and
layoff procedures as all critical in
determining the scope of other
economic offers.
Minimum Pay
The minimum pay section of
USE's proposed contract calls for
a bottom line of $600 per month.
The lowest paid workers in the
unit, food service employees,
currently receive $408 per month.
The University announced last
week that it has offered a $500
per year minimum pay rate with a
$25 raise after the first year.
USE's demand translates into a
2.2 percent, or about a $280,000
increase of the unit's wage base.
The union asserts that this is the
minimum liveable wage for the
Bay Area and that it compares
closely with government figures.
Berk has said that he considers
the present minimum of $408 per
month to be a method of "racist"
exploitation of the third-world
workers who fill many of the jobs.
The University has said that it
does not oppose new minimum
pay rates but insists on
negotiating the minimum rate for
each job classification
individually.
Cost of Living
USE has proposed a cost of
living escalator clause which
would boost worker's pay $6 per
month per point increase in the
consumer price index (CPI),
retroactive to Sept. 1, 1973.
The union says the clause is
necessary to protect the workers

from the inflationary climate in
the country. USE asserts that the
CPI will accurately reflect price
increase necessities for which
workers of all incomes must spend
similar amounts.
The proposal would increase
the unit's wage base by about 5.5
percent or about $713,000.
The University says there is no
question that the workers have
suffered a real decline in income
because of the upsurge in the cost
of living.
However, the University says it
is in the same squeeze and that it
has no cost of living escalators on
its main sources of income —
tuition, investments and
government grants.
Bargaining unit members
would normally have received a
4-5 percent cost of living wage
increase last September but did
not since they were involved in
negotiating a contract. Thus unit
members have not received a cost
of living pay increase for well over
a year said Berk.
Berk estimated that the
escalator sought by the union
would add an average of $75 per
month per employee during
1974-75.
The government is currently
revising the CPI to cover retired
persons, self-employed workers
and the unemployed, in addition
to the workers now constituting
the base of the index.
Berk concedes that USE's
escalator clause might be
weakened by the broader index
since a broadened index would
probably fluctuate much less,
thereby reducing the amount of
extra cost-of-living pay it might
have produced for the workers in
the past.
Community Standards
Perhaps the widest gulf
between the two sides is created
by the union's community
standards concept.
USE wants the University to
raise wages on a job-for-job basis
to the 75th percentile of what
workers outside the University are
making. This would mean that the
union's plumbers', technicaians'
and other workers' salaries would
rank in the top 25 percent of the
market as a whole.
The union's rationale is that
since the University is not a
profit-making corporation which
has to hold wages down, it should
try to pay its workers fairly.
Berk has said the7sthpercentile
was chosen because jobs at the
University generally call for a
wider variety of skills than do
outside jobs and thus Stanford
employees, on the average, are of
a higher caliber and should be
paid appropriately.
Both Palo Alto and San
Francisco city employees are
above the 75th percentile, Berk
said.
The community standards
concept would entail a 33 percent
in the unit's wage base over four
years. The 8.3 percent increase in
the first year would cost the
University about $1.1 million.
The four years together could
mean a $10 million increase in the
wage base the University says.
The University has said it is
willing to look at the market and
assess where University employees
stand with respect to the entire
economic package.
The enormous cost of the
community standards provision
arises from the fact that most of
the workers who would receive
large increases are already in
higher income ranges.
University officials emphasize
that Stanford can't afford such
provisions.
The union, however, does not
want to see its lower income

workers receive substantially
larger wage increases than its more
skilled workers.
Shop
USE reduced its demand for a
union shop late last week and is
now asking for an agency shop as
an alternative.
There is little difference
between the two shops. In an
agency shop, all workers in the
bargaining unit must pay union
dues but do not have to actually
join the union if they do not wish.
A union shop requires that all
unit members be dues-paying
members of the union.
USE says that since law
requires that unit members receive
the same gains whether they are
union members or not, all should
pay dues.
The University has offered a
modified union shop. This
requires all workers hired after the
contract is signed to join the
union. Any unit member who
does not belong to the union
when the contract is signed need
not join or rejoin.
USE objects to this
counter-offer since any worker
could resign from the union just
before the contract is signed to
avoid paying union dues and yet
receive the full benefits of the
negotiated contract.
USE also asserts that since the
University gave the firefighters
union an agency shop in a
contract negotiated last year, the
University should similarly give
one to USE.
University officials say
however, that in unionization
elections the firefighters
were unanimous in their decision
while a significant portion of the
bargaining unit USE represents
voted against unionization.
Because those workers came to
Stanford not anticipating the
objections or burden of paying
union dues, it would not be fair to
impose those dues on them now,
the University argues.
University officials add that it
should be up to the union to
recruit its members and not the
University's duty.
USE's proposed shop could
require that students employed in
jobs within the bargaining unit
become members of USE.
The University's proposed
modified union shop would allow
students working as a part of their
financial aid program to remain
independent of the union.
USE has said it wants students
doing work within the unit to
receive equal pay. It sees no
distinction between students and
regular workers who do the same
work.
The NLRB definition of the
bargaining unit USE represents
did not, for the most part, include
students.
Maintenance of Standards
The maintenance of standards
clause is a major non-economic
issue that has been stalling
negotiations for some time.
The clause would prevent the
University from altering working
conditions for the worse — as
defined by the union.
Specifically, the union
demands that: "The University
agrees that all conditions of
employment relating to wages,
hours of work, and general
working conditions be maintained
at not less than the highest
standards in effect at the time of
the signing of this agreement, and
that conditions of employment
shall be improved whenever
specific provisions for
improvement are made in this
agreement."
The union offered last week to
limit the clause to "all significant
conditions of employment," to

practices current since July 1,
1973, and to protect local
privileges but not extend them to
the unit as a whole.
The University refuses to "give
them a blank check" to guarantee
any particular practice by the
University. Stanford officials see
the clause as insurance for the
union in case union negotiators
forget to include something in the
contract.
University negotiators use the
classic "building in the parking
lot" example to illustrate how
they feel the clause would
unfairly restrict the University.
They say that if the University
wanted to construct a building in
a parking lot that union
employees currently park in, that
the union might claim the extra
distance that employees might be
forced to walk to work
constituted a degradation of
working conditions and would be
therefore prohibited.
USE insists that it would be
reasonable with regard to the
application of this clause.
Job-Related Discipline
The union is seeking a contract
clause prohibiting disciplinary
action against workers for
non-job-related activities.
The University says it must
have the right to discipline
workers but has offered to
substitute a "just cause" clause
and arbitration procedure to cope
with any disagreements that might
arise.
The University would thus be
forced to show just cause why it
had disciplined a worker. The
decision could be appealed by the
worker to an outside arbitrator.
This procedure is common
practice in contracts, the
University says, in order to avoid
"sticky" language in attempting
to lay out workers' rights.
USE insists, however, that
employees' rights should be
spelled out in the contract to
protect them against unfair
disciplinary actions.
Pension Plan
USE's pension plan calls for a
contribution by the University of
10 percent, equal to that which
professional employees of the
University now receive.
Unit members now receive six
percent and the union claims it is
inequitable to pay the
professional workers more.
University officials say that
they are trying to structure the
benefits and then determine the
cost while USE would set the
contribution rate and then see
what it will buy, an annuity type
of plan.
USE also calls for a minimum
pension payment of $250 per
month.
The University claims this
retirement plan is extravagent and
that it would provide income
benefits substantially in excess of
the highest rate earned while

working.
The union's proposed pension
plan would boost the unit's wage
base by 4.7 percent or about
$500,000, according to union
figures.
Layoffs
If lack of work forces a layoff,
USE wants the worker with the
least seniority in the classification
in question to be laid off with
severance pay.
The University insists it must
have the right to reduce the
working staff in the area needed
by the amount necessary and that
seniority shouldn't govern who is
laid off but rather ability.
University officials said last
week that they would be willing
to compromise on this point to
the extent that seniority would
govern policy when the skill and
ability of workers in question
were about equal.
Medical Plan
USE wants a medical plan
covering all workers and their
dependants paid for by the
University.
By USE's estimates the
proposal would boost the unit's
wage base by 2.2 percent or about
$286,000.
The University is opposed to
the plan although it has suggested
it might agree to something more
than the present plan, depending
on the outcome of other
economic and cost-related items.
USE has offered a family
dental plan as an alternative to the
dependants' medical coverage.
Sick Leave
The union is asking for
unlimited sick leave after the first
year of service.
The University contends that
such a plan is next to unheard of.
USE says that those workers
who need extended illness
coverage should be able to get it.
USE notes that the unlimited paid
leave is for serious illnesses only
and that IBM has a similar
unlimited sick leave provision.
Settled Issues
Some issues have been settled,
but not many.
USE and the University agreed
to one additional paid holiday for
unit members—their birthday or
other day designated by the
worker and approved.
The two sides are close to
agreement on the grievance
procedure to be used to settle
disputes between workers and
management.
USE has tentatively agreed to
keep the current vacation plan —
three weeks of vacation per year
for the first ten years of service
and four weeks thereafter,
according to University officials.
Other small parts of the
contract articles have been
tentatively agreed upon, but no
article as a whole has been signed
off yet.
The following is a brief
synopsis of the main strike issues
USE has designated.
While the University
negotiators agree that they are

1974-75.

when the contract is signed need
not join or rejoin.
USE objects to this
counter-offer since any worker
could resign from the union just
before the contract is signed to
avoid paying union dues and yet
receive the full benefits of the
negotiated contract.
USE also asserts that since the
University gave the firefighters
union an agency shop in a
contract negotiated last year, the
University should similarly give
one to USE.
University officials say
however, that in unionization
elections the firefighters
were unanimous in their decision
while a significant portion of the
bargaining unit USE represents
voted against unionization.
Because those workers came to
Stanford not anticipating the
objections or burden of paying
union dues, it would not be fair to
impose those dues on them now,
the University argues.
University officials add that it
should be up to the union to
recruit its members and not the
University's duty.
USE's proposed shop could
require that students employed in
jobs within the bargaining unit
become members of USE.
The University's proposed
modified union shop would allow
students working as a part of their
financial aid program to remain
independent of the union.
USE has said it wants students
doing work within the unit to
receive equal pay. It sees no
distinction between students and
regular workers who do the same
work.
The NLRB definition of the
bargaining unit USE represents
did not, for the most part, include
students.
Maintenance of Standards
The maintenance of standards
clause is a major non-economic
issue that has been stalling
negotiations for some time.
The clause would prevent the
University from altering working
conditions for the worse — as
defined by the union.
Specifically, the union
demands that: "The University
agrees that all conditions of
employment relating to wages,
hours of work, and general
working conditions be maintained
at not less than the highest
standards in effect at the time of
the signing of this agreement, and
that conditions of employment
shall be improved whenever
specific provisions for
improvement are made in this
agreement."
The union offered last week to
limit the clause to "all significant
conditions of employment," to

practices current since July 1,
1973, and to protect local
privileges but not extend them to
the unit as a whole.
The University refuses to "give
them a blank check" to guarantee
any particular practice by the
University. Stanford officials see
the clause as insurance for the
union in case union negotiators
forget to include something in the
contract.
University negotiators use the
classic "building in the parking
lot" example to illustrate how
they feel the clause would
unfairly restrict the University.
They say that if the University
wanted to construct a building in
a parking lot that union
employees currently park in, that
the union might claim the extra
distance that employees might be
forced to walk to work
constituted a degradation of
working conditions and would be
therefore prohibited.
USE insists that it would be
reasonable with regard to the
application of this clause.
Job-Related Discipline
The union is seeking a contract
clause prohibiting disciplinary
action against workers for
non-job-related activities.
The University says it must
have the right to discipline
workers but has offered to
substitute a "just cause" clause
and arbitration procedure to cope
with any disagreements that might
arise.
The University would thus be
forced to show just cause why it
had disciplined a worker. The
decision could be appealed by the
worker to an outside arbitrator.
This procedure is common
practice in contracts, the
University says, in order to avoid
"sticky" language in attempting
to lay out workers' rights.
USE insists, however, that
employees' rights should be
spelled out in the contract to
protect them against unfair
disciplinary actions.
Pension Plan
USE's pension plan calls for a
contribution by the University of
10 percent, equal to that which
professional employees of the
University now receive.
Unit members now receive six
percent and the union claims it is
inequitable to pay the
professional workers more.
University officials say that
they are trying to structure the
benefits and then determine the
cost while USE would set the
contribution rate and then see
what it will buy, an annuity type
of plan.
USE also calls for a minimum
pension payment of $250 per
month.
The University claims this
retirement plan is extravagent and
that it would provide income
benefits substantially in excess of
the highest rate earned while

working.
The union's proposed pension
plan would boost the unit's wage
base by 4.7 percent or about
$500,000, according to union
figures.
Layoffs
If lack of work forces a layoff,
USE wants the worker with the
least seniority in the classification
in question to be laid off with
severance pay.
The University insists it must
have the right to reduce the
working staff in the area needed
by the amount necessary and that
seniority shouldn't govern who is
laid off but rather ability.
University officials said last
week that they would be willing
to compromise on this point to
the extent that seniority would
govern policy when the skill and
ability of workers in question
were about equal.
Medical Plan
USE wants a medical plan
covering all workers and their
dependants paid for by the
University.
By USE's estimates the
proposal would boost the unit's
wage base by 2.2 percent or about
$286,000.
The University is opposed to
the plan although it has suggested
it might agree to something more
than the present plan, depending
on the outcome of other
economic and cost-related items.
USE has offered a family
dental plan as an alternative to the
dependants' medical coverage.
Sick Leave
The union is asking for
unlimited sick leave after the first
year of service.
The University contends that
such a plan is next to unheard of.
USE says that those workers
who need extended illness
coverage should be able to get it.
USE notes that the unlimited paid
leave is for serious illnesses only
and that IBM has a similar
unlimited sick leave provision.
Settled Issues
Some issues have been settled,
but not many.
USE and the University agreed
to one additional paid holiday for
unit members—their birthday or
other day designated by the
worker and approved.
The two sides are close to
agreement on the grievance
procedure to be used to settle
disputes between workers and
management.
USE has tentatively agreed to
keep the current vacation plan —
three weeks of vacation per year
for the first ten years of service
and four weeks thereafter,
according to University officials.
Other small parts of the
contract articles have been
tentatively agreed upon, but no
article as a whole has been signed
off yet.
The following is a brief
synopsis of the main strike issues
USE has designated.
While the University
negotiators agree that they are
indeed issues of fundamental
importance, there are a number of
related issues that the University
would like to see cleaned up first.
The University says those
issues will have an impact on the
economic package and that the
University's economic offers
might be improved following the
resolution of these cost-related
issues.
They cite hiring practices and
policies, internal transfers and
mobility of unit workers,
scheduling of hours, mobility
between job classifications, and
layoff procedures as all critical in
determining the scope of other
economic offers.
Minimum Pay
The minimum pay section of
USE's proposed contract calls for
a bottom line of $600 per month.
The lowest paid workers in the
unit, food service employees,
currently receive $408 per month.
The University announced last
week that it has offered a $500
per year minimum pay rate with a
$25 raise after the first year.
USE's demand translates into a
2.2 percent, or about a $280,000
increase of the unit's wage base.
The union asserts that this is the
minimum liveable wage for the
Bay Area and that it compares
closely with government figures.
Berk has said that he considers
the present minimum of $408 per
month to be a method of "racist"
exploitation of the third-world
workers who fill many of the jobs.
The University has said that it
does not oppose new minimum
pay rates but insists on
negotiating the minimum rate for
each job classification
individually.
Cost of Living
USE has proposed a cost of
living escalator clause which
would boost worker's pay $6 per
month per point increase in the
consumer price index (CPI),
retroactive to Sept. 1, 1973.
The union says the clause is
necessary to protect the workers

from the inflationary climate in
the country. USE asserts that the
CPI will accurately reflect price
increase necessities for which
workers of all incomes must spend
similar amounts.
The proposal would increase
the unit's wage base by about 5.5
percent or about $713,000.
The University says there is no
question that the workers have
suffered a real decline in income
because of the upsurge in the cost
of living.
However, the University says it
is in the same squeeze and that it
has no cost of living escalators on
its main sources of income —
tuition, investments and
government grants.
Bargaining unit members
would normally have received a
4-5 percent cost of living wage
increase last September but did
not since they were involved in
negotiating a contract. Thus unit
members have not received a cost
of living pay increase for well over
a year said Berk.
Berk estimated that the
escalator sought by the union
would add an average of $75 per
month per employee during
1974-75.
The government is currently
revising the CPI to cover retired
persons, self-employed workers
and the unemployed, in addition
to the workers now constituting
the base of the index.
Berk concedes that USE's
escalator clause might be
weakened by the broader index
since a broadened index would
probably fluctuate much less,
thereby reducing the amount of
extra cost-of-living pay it might
have produced for the workers in
the past.
Community Standards
Perhaps the widest gulf
between the two sides is created
by the union's community
standards concept.
USE wants the University to
raise wages on a job-for-job basis
to the 75th percentile of what
workers outside the University are
making. This would mean that the
union's plumbers', technicaians'
and other workers' salaries would
rank in the top 25 percent of the
market as a whole.
The union's rationale is that
since the University is not a
profit-making corporation which
has to hold wages down, it should
try to pay its workers fairly.
Berk has said the7sthpercentile
was chosen because jobs at the
University generally call for a
wider variety of skills than do
outside jobs and thus Stanford
employees, on the average, are of
a higher caliber and should be
paid appropriately.
Both Palo Alto and San
Francisco city employees are
above the 75th percentile, Berk
said.
The community standards
concept would entail a 33 percent
in the unit's wage base over four
years. The 8.3 percent increase in
the first year would cost the
University about $1.1 million.
The four years together could
mean a $10 million increase in the
wage base the University says.
The University has said it is
willing to look at the market and
assess where University employees
stand with respect to the entire
economic package.
The enormous cost of the
community standards provision
arises from the fact that most of
the workers who would receive
large increases are already in
higher income ranges.
University officials emphasize
that Stanford can't afford such
provisions.
The union, however, does not
want to see its lower income

workers receive substantially
larger wage increases than its more
skilled workers.
Shop
USE reduced its demand for a
union shop late last week and is
now asking for an agency shop as
an alternative.
There is little difference
between the two shops. In an
agency shop, all workers in the
bargaining unit must pay union
dues but do not have to actually
join the union if they do not wish.
A union shop requires that all
unit members be dues-paying
members of the union.
USE says that since law
requires that unit members receive
the same gains whether they are
union members or not, all should
pay dues.
The University has offered a
modified union shop. This
requires all workers hired after the
contract is signed to join the
union. Any unit member who
does not belong to the union
when the contract is signed need
not join or rejoin.
USE objects to this
counter-offer since any worker
could resign from the union just
before the contract is signed to
avoid paying union dues and yet
receive the full benefits of the
negotiated contract.
USE also asserts that since the
University gave the firefighters
union an agency shop in a
contract negotiated last year, the
University should similarly give
one to USE.
University officials say
however, that in unionization
elections the firefighters
were unanimous in their decision
while a significant portion of the

impose those dues on them now,
the University argues.
University officials add that it
should be up to the union to
recruit its members and not the
University's duty.
USE's proposed shop could
require that students employed in
jobs within the bargaining unit
become members of USE.
The University's proposed
modified union shop would allow
students working as a part of their
financial aid program to remain
independent of the union.
USE has said it wants students
doing work within the unit to
receive equal pay. It sees no
distinction between students and
regular workers who do the same
work.
The NLRB definition of the
bargaining unit USE represents
did not, for the most part, include
students.

USE and the University agreed
to one additional paid holiday for
unit members—their birthday or
other day designated by the
worker and approved.
The two sides are close to
agreement on the grievance
procedure to be used to settle
disputes between workers and
management.
USE has tentatively agreed to
keep the current vacation plan —
three weeks of vacation per year
for the first ten years of service
and four weeks thereafter,
according to University officials.
Other small parts of the
contract articles have been
tentatively agreed upon, but no
article as a whole has been signed
off yet.
The following is a brief
synopsis of the main strike issues
USE has designated.
While the University
negotiators agree that they are
indeed issues of fundamental
importance, there are a number of
related issues that the University
would like to see cleaned up first.
The University says those
issues will have an impact on the
economic package and that the
University's economic offers
might be improved following the
resolution of these cost-related
issues.
They cite hiring practices and
policies, internal transfers and
mobility of unit workers,
scheduling of hours, mobility
between job classifications, and
layoff procedures as all critical in
determining the scope of other
economic offers.
Minimum Pay
The minimum pay section of
USE's proposed contract calls for
a bottom line of $600 per month.
The lowest paid workers in the
unit, food service employees,
currently receive $408 per month.
The University announced last
week that it has offered a $500
per year minimum pay rate with a
$25 raise after the first year.
USE's demand translates into a
2.2 percent, or about a $280,000
increase of the unit's wage base.
The union asserts that this is the
minimum liveable wage for the
Bay Area and that it compares
closely with government figures.
Berk has said that he considers
the present minimum of $408 per
month to be a method of "racist"
exploitation of the third-world
workers who fill many of the jobs.
The University has said that it
does not oppose new minimum
pay rates but insists on
negotiating the minimum rate for
each job classification
individually.
Cost of Living
USE has proposed a cost of
living escalator clause which
would boost worker's pay $6 per
month per point increase in the
consumer price index (CPI),
retroactive to Sept. 1, 1973.
The union says the clause is
necessary to protect the workers

from the inflationary climate in
the country. USE asserts that the
CPI will accurately reflect price
increase necessities for which
workers of all incomes must spend
similar amounts.
The proposal would increase
the unit's wage base by about 5.5
percent or about $713,000.
The University says there is no
question that the workers have
suffered a real decline in income
because of the upsurge in the cost
of living.
However, the University says it
is in the same squeeze and that it
has no cost of living escalators on
its main sources of income —
tuition, investments and
government grants.
Bargaining unit members
would normally have received a
4-5 percent cost of living wage
increase last September but did
not since they were involved in
negotiating a contract. Thus unit
members have not received a cost
of living pay increase for well over
a year said Berk.
Berk estimated that the
escalator sought by the union
would add an average of $75 per
month per employee during
1974-75.
The government is currently
revising the CPI to cover retired
persons, self-employed workers
and the unemployed, in addition
to the workers now constituting
the base of the index.
Berk concedes that USE's
escalator clause might be
weakened by the broader index
since a broadened index would
probably fluctuate much less,
thereby reducing the amount of
extra cost-of-living pay it might
have produced for the workers in
the past.
Community Standards
Perhaps the widest gulf
between the two sides is created
by the union's community
standards concept.
USE wants the University to
raise wages on a job-for-job basis
to the 75th percentile of what
workers outside the University are
making. This would mean that the
union's plumbers', technicaians'
and other workers' salaries would
rank in the top 25 percent of the
market as a whole.
The union's rationale is that
since the University is not a
profit-making corporation which
has to hold wages down, it should
try to pay its workers fairly.
Berk has said the7sthpercentile
was chosen because jobs at the
University generally call for a
wider variety of skills than do
outside jobs and thus Stanford
employees, on the average, are of
a higher caliber and should be
paid appropriately.
Both Palo Alto and San
Francisco city employees are
above the 75th percentile, Berk
said.
The community standards
concept would entail a 33 percent
in the unit's wage base over four
years. The 8.3 percent increase in
the first year would cost the
University about $1.1 million.
The four years together could
mean a $10 million increase in the
wage base the University says.
The University has said it is
willing to look at the market and
assess where University employees
stand with respect to the entire
economic package.
The enormous cost of the
community standards provision
arises from the fact that most of
the workers who would receive
large increases are already in
higher income ranges.
University officials emphasize
that Stanford can't afford such
provisions.
The union, however, does not
want to see its lower income

workers receive substantially
larger wage increases than its more
skilled workers.
Shop
USE reduced its demand for a
union shop late last week and is
now asking for an agency shop as
an alternative.
There is little difference
between the two shops. In an
agency shop, all workers in the
bargaining unit must pay union
dues but do not have to actually
join the union if they do not wish.
A union shop requires that all
unit members be dues-paying
members of the union.
USE says that since law
requires that unit members receive
the same gains whether they are
union members or not, all should
pay dues.
The University has offered a
modified union shop. This
requires all workers hired after the
contract is signed to join the
union. Any unit member who
does not belong to the union
when the contract is signed need
not join or rejoin.
USE objects to this
counter-offer since any worker
could resign from the union just
before the contract is signed to
avoid paying union dues and yet
receive the full benefits of the
negotiated contract.
USE also asserts that since the
University gave the firefighters
union an agency shop in a
contract negotiated last year, the
University should similarly give
one to USE.
University officials say
however, that in unionization
elections the firefighters
were unanimous in their decision
while a significant portion of the
bargaining unit USE represents
voted against unionization.
Because those workers came to
Stanford not anticipating the
objections or burden of paying
union dues, it would not be fair to
impose those dues on them now,
the University argues.
University officials add that it
should be up to the union to
recruit its members and not the
University's duty.
USE's proposed shop could
require that students employed in
jobs within the bargaining unit
become members of USE.
The University's proposed
modified union shop would allow
students working as a part of their
financial aid program to remain
independent of the union.
USE has said it wants students
doing work within the unit to
receive equal pay. It sees no
distinction between students and
regular workers who do the same
work.
The NLRB definition of the
bargaining unit USE represents
did not, for the most part, include
students.
Maintenance of Standards
The maintenance of standards
clause is a major non-economic
issue that has been stalling
negotiations for some time.
The clause would prevent the
University from altering working
conditions for the worse — as
defined by the union.
Specifically, the union
demands that: "The University
agrees that all conditions of
employment relating to wages,
hours of work, and general
working conditions be maintained
at not less than the highest
standards in effect at the time of
the signing of this agreement, and
that conditions of employment
shall be improved whenever
specific provisions for
improvement are made in this
agreement."
The union offered last week to
limit the clause to "all significant
conditions of employment," to

practices current since July 1,
1973, and to protect local
privileges but not extend them to
the unit as a whole.
The University refuses to "give
them a blank check" to guarantee
any particular practice by the
University. Stanford officials see
the clause as insurance for the
union in case union negotiators
forget to include something in the
contract.
University negotiators use the
classic "building in the parking
lot" example to illustrate how
they feel the clause would
unfairly restrict the University.
They say that if the University
wanted to construct a building in
a parking lot that union
employees currently park in, that
the union might claim the extra
distance that employees might be
forced to walk to work
constituted a degradation of
working conditions and would be
therefore prohibited.
USE insists that it would be
reasonable with regard to the
application of this clause.
Job-Related Discipline
The union is seeking a contract
clause prohibiting disciplinary
action against workers for
non-job-related activities.
The University says it must
have the right to discipline
workers but has offered to
substitute a "just cause" clause
and arbitration procedure to cope
with any disagreements that might
arise.
The University would thus be
forced to show just cause why it
had disciplined a worker. The
decision could be appealed by the
worker to an outside arbitrator.
This procedure is common
practice in contracts, the
University says, in order to avoid
"sticky" language in attempting
to lay out workers' rights.
USE insists, however, that
employees' rights should be
spelled out in the contract to
protect them against unfair
disciplinary actions.
Pension Plan
USE's pension plan calls for a
contribution by the University of
10 percent, equal to that which
professional employees of the
University now receive.
Unit members now receive six
percent and the union claims it is
inequitable to pay the
professional workers more.
University officials say that
they are trying to structure the
benefits and then determine the
cost while USE would set the
contribution rate and then see
what it will buy, an annuity type
of plan.
USE also calls for a minimum
pension payment of $250 per
month.
The University claims this
retirement plan is extravagent and
that it would provide income
benefits substantially in excess of
the highest rate earned while

working.
The union's proposed pension
plan would boost the unit's wage
base by 4.7 percent or about
$500,000, according to union
figures.
Layoffs
If lack of work forces a layoff,
USE wants the worker with the
least seniority in the classification
in question to be laid off with
severance pay.
The University insists it must
have the right to reduce the
working staff in the area needed
by the amount necessary and that
seniority shouldn't govern who is
laid off but rather ability.
University officials said last
week that they would be willing
to compromise on this point to
the extent that seniority would
govern policy when the skill and
ability of workers in question
were about equal.
Medical Plan
USE wants a medical plan
covering all workers and their
dependants paid for by the
University.
By USE's estimates the
proposal would boost the unit's
wage base by 2.2 percent or about
$286,000.
The University is opposed to
the plan although it has suggested
it might agree to something more
than the present plan, depending
on the outcome of other
economic and cost-related items.
USE has offered a family
dental plan as an alternative to the
dependants' medical coverage.
Sick Leave
The union is asking for
unlimited sick leave after the first
year of service.
The University contends that
such a plan is next to unheard of.
USE says that those workers
who need extended illness
coverage should be able to get it.
USE notes that the unlimited paid
leave is for serious illnesses only
and that IBM has a similar
unlimited sick leave provision.
Settled Issues
Some issues have been settled,
but not many.
USE and the University agreed
to one additional paid holiday for
unit members—their birthday or
other day designated by the
worker and approved.
The two sides are close to
agreement on the grievance
procedure to be used to settle
disputes between workers and
management.
USE has tentatively agreed to
keep the current vacation plan —
three weeks of vacation per year
for the first ten years of service
and four weeks thereafter,
according to University officials.

USE says that since law
requires that unit members receive
the same gains whether they are
union members or not, all should
pay dues.
The University has offered a
modified union shop. This
requires all workers hired after the
contract is signed to join the
union. Any unit member who
does not belong to the union
when the contract is signed need
not join or rejoin.
USE objects to this
counter-offer since any worker
could resign from the union just
before the contract is signed to
avoid paying union dues and yet
receive the full benefits of the
negotiated contract.
USE also asserts that since the
University gave the firefighters
union an agency shop in a
contract negotiated last year, the
University should similarly give
one to USE.
University officials say
however, that in unionization
elections the firefighters
were unanimous in their decision
while a significant portion of the
bargaining unit USE represents
voted against unionization.
Because those workers came to
Stanford not anticipating the
objections or burden of paying
union dues, it would not be fair to
impose those dues on them now,
the University argues.
University officials add that it
should be up to the union to
recruit its members and not the
University's duty.
USE's proposed shop could
require that students employed in
jobs within the bargaining unit
become members of USE.
The University's proposed
modified union shop would allow
students working as a part of their
financial aid program to remain
independent of the union.
USE has said it wants students
doing work within the unit to
receive equal pay. It sees no
distinction between students and
regular workers who do the same
work.
The NLRB definition of the
bargaining unit USE represents
did not, for the most part, include
students.
Maintenance of Standards
The maintenance of standards
clause is a major non-economic
issue that has been stalling
negotiations for some time.
The clause would prevent the
University from altering working
conditions for the worse — as
defined by the union.
Specifically, the union
demands that: "The University
agrees that all conditions of
employment relating to wages,
hours of work, and general
working conditions be maintained
at not less than the highest
standards in effect at the time of
the signing of this agreement, and
that conditions of employment
shall be improved whenever
specific provisions for
improvement are made in this
agreement."
The union offered last week to
limit the clause to "all significant
conditions of employment," to

practices current since July 1,
1973, and to protect local
privileges but not extend them to
the unit as a whole.
The University refuses to "give
them a blank check" to guarantee
any particular practice by the
University. Stanford officials see
the clause as insurance for the
union in case union negotiators
forget to include something in the
contract.
University negotiators use the
classic "building in the parking
lot" example to illustrate how
they feel the clause would
unfairly restrict the University.
They say that if the University
wanted to construct a building in
a parking lot that union
employees currently park in, that
the union might claim the extra
distance that employees might be
forced to walk to work
constituted a degradation of
working conditions and would be
therefore prohibited.
USE insists that it would be
reasonable with regard to the
application of this clause.
Job-Related Discipline
The union is seeking a contract
clause prohibiting disciplinary
action against workers for
non-job-related activities.
The University says it must
have the right to discipline
workers but has offered to
substitute a "just cause" clause
and arbitration procedure to cope
with any disagreements that might
arise.
The University would thus be
forced to show just cause why it
had disciplined a worker. The
decision could be appealed by the
worker to an outside arbitrator.
This procedure is common
practice in contracts, the
University says, in order to avoid
"sticky" language in attempting
to lay out workers' rights.
USE insists, however, that
employees' rights should be
spelled out in the contract to
protect them against unfair
disciplinary actions.
Pension Plan
USE's pension plan calls for a
contribution by the University of
10 percent, equal to that which
professional employees of the
University now receive.
Unit members now receive six
percent and the union claims it is
inequitable to pay the
professional workers more.
University officials say that
they are trying to structure the
benefits and then determine the
cost while USE would set the
contribution rate and then see
what it will buy, an annuity type
of plan.
USE also calls for a minimum
pension payment of $250 per
month.
The University claims this
retirement plan is extravagent and
that it would provide income
benefits substantially in excess of
the highest rate earned while

working.
The union's proposed pension
plan would boost the unit's wage
base by 4.7 percent or about
$500,000, according to union
figures.
Layoffs
If lack of work forces a layoff,
USE wants the worker with the
least seniority in the classification
in question to be laid off with
severance pay.
The University insists it must
have the right to reduce the
working staff in the area needed
by the amount necessary and that
seniority shouldn't govern who is
laid off but rather ability.
University officials said last
week that they would be willing
to compromise on this point to
the extent that seniority would
govern policy when the skill and
ability of workers in question
were about equal.
Medical Plan
USE wants a medical plan
covering all workers and their
dependants paid for by the
University.
By USE's estimates the
proposal would boost the unit's
wage base by 2.2 percent or about
$286,000.
The University is opposed to
the plan although it has suggested
it might agree to something more
than the present plan, depending
on the outcome of other
economic and cost-related items.
USE has offered a family
dental plan as an alternative to the
dependants' medical coverage.
Sick Leave
The union is asking for
unlimited sick leave after the first
year of service.
The University contends that
such a plan is next to unheard of.
USE says that those workers
who need extended illness
coverage should be able to get it.
USE notes that the unlimited paid
leave is for serious illnesses only
and that IBM has a similar
unlimited sick leave provision.
Settled Issues
Some issues have been settled,
but not many.
USE and the University agreed
to one additional paid holiday for
unit members—their birthday or
other day designated by the
worker and approved.
The two sides are close to
agreement on the grievance
procedure to be used to settle
disputes between workers and
management.
USE has tentatively agreed to
keep the current vacation plan —
three weeks of vacation per year
for the first ten years of service
and four weeks thereafter,
according to University officials.
Other small parts of the
contract articles have been
tentatively agreed upon, but no
article as a whole has been signed
off yet.
The following is a brief
synopsis of the main strike issues
USE has designated.
While the University
negotiators agree that they are
indeed issues of fundamental
importance, there are a number of
related issues that the University
would like to see cleaned up first.
The University says those
issues will have an impact on the
economic package and that the
University's economic offers
might be improved following the
resolution of these cost-related
issues.
They cite hiring practices and
policies, internal transfers and
mobility of unit workers,
scheduling of hours, mobility
between job classifications, and
layoff procedures as all critical in
determining the scope of other
economic offers.
Minimum Pay
The minimum pay section of
USE's proposed contract calls for
a bottom line of $600 per month.
The lowest paid workers in the
unit, food service employees,
currently receive $408 per month.
The University announced last
week that it has offered a $500
per year minimum pay rate with a
$25 raise after the first year.
USE's demand translates into a
2.2 percent, or about a $280,000
increase of the unit's wage base.
The union asserts that this is the
minimum liveable wage for the
Bay Area and that it compares
closely with government figures.
Berk has said that he considers
the present minimum of $408 per
month to be a method of "racist"
exploitation of the third-world
workers who fill many of the jobs.
The University has said that it
does not oppose new minimum
pay rates but insists on
negotiating the minimum rate for
each job classification
individually.
Cost of Living
USE has proposed a cost of
living escalator clause which
would boost worker's pay $6 per
month per point increase in the
consumer price index (CPI),
retroactive to Sept. 1, 1973.
The union says the clause is
necessary to protect the workers

from the inflationary climate in
the country. USE asserts that the
CPI will accurately reflect price
increase necessities for which
workers of all incomes must spend
similar amounts.
The proposal would increase
the unit's wage base by about 5.5
percent or about $713,000.
The University says there is no
question that the workers have
suffered a real decline in income
because of the upsurge in the cost
of living.
However, the University says it
is in the same squeeze and that it
has no cost of living escalators on
its main sources of income —
tuition, investments and
government grants.
Bargaining unit members
would normally have received a
4-5 percent cost of living wage
increase last September but did
not since they were involved in
negotiating a contract. Thus unit
members have not received a cost
of living pay increase for well over
a year said Berk.
Berk estimated that the
escalator sought by the union
would add an average of $75 per
month per employee during
1974-75.
The government is currently
revising the CPI to cover retired
persons, self-employed workers
and the unemployed, in addition
to the workers now constituting
the base of the index.
Berk concedes that USE's
escalator clause might be
weakened by the broader index
since a broadened index would
probably fluctuate much less,
thereby reducing the amount of
extra cost-of-living pay it might
have produced for the workers in
the past.
Community Standards
Perhaps the widest gulf
between the two sides is created
by the union's community
standards concept.
USE wants the University to
raise wages on a job-for-job basis
to the 75th percentile of what
workers outside the University are
making. This would mean that the
union's plumbers', technicaians'
and other workers' salaries would
rank in the top 25 percent of the
market as a whole.
The union's rationale is that
since the University is not a
profit-making corporation which
has to hold wages down, it should
try to pay its workers fairly.
Berk has said the7sthpercentile
was chosen because jobs at the
University generally call for a
wider variety of skills than do
outside jobs and thus Stanford
employees, on the average, are of
a higher caliber and should be
paid appropriately.
Both Palo Alto and San
Francisco city employees are
above the 75th percentile, Berk
said.
The community standards
concept would entail a 33 percent
in the unit's wage base over four
years. The 8.3 percent increase in
the first year would cost the
University about $1.1 million.
The four years together could
mean a $10 million increase in the
wage base the University says.
The University has said it is
willing to look at the market and
assess where University employees
stand with respect to the entire
economic package.
The enormous cost of the
community standards provision
arises from the fact that most of
the workers who would receive
large increases are already in
higher income ranges.
University officials emphasize
that Stanford can't afford such
provisions.
The union, however, does not
want to see its lower income

workers receive substantially
larger wage increases than its more
skilled workers.
Shop
USE reduced its demand for a
union shop late last week and is
now asking for an agency shop as
an alternative.
There is little difference
between the two shops. In an
agency shop, all workers in the
bargaining unit must pay union
dues but do not have to actually
join the union if they do not wish.
A union shop requires that all
unit members be dues-paying
members of the union.
USE says that since law
requires that unit members receive
the same gains whether they are
union members or not, all should
pay dues.
The University has offered a
modified union shop. This
requires all workers hired after the
contract is signed to join the
union. Any unit member who
does not belong to the union
when the contract is signed need
not join or rejoin.
USE objects to this
counter-offer since any worker
could resign from the union just
before the contract is signed to
avoid paying union dues and yet
receive the full benefits of the
negotiated contract.
USE also asserts that since the
University gave the firefighters
union an agency shop in a
contract negotiated last year, the
University should similarly give
one to USE.
University officials say
however, that in unionization
elections the firefighters
were unanimous in their decision

the University argues.
University officials add that it
should be up to the union to
recruit its members and not the
University's duty.
USE's proposed shop could
require that students employed in
jobs within the bargaining unit
become members of USE.
The University's proposed
modified union shop would allow
students working as a part of their
financial aid program to remain
independent of the union.
USE has said it wants students
doing work within the unit to
receive equal pay. It sees no
distinction between students and
regular workers who do the same
work.
The NLRB definition of the
bargaining unit USE represents
did not, for the most part, include
students.
