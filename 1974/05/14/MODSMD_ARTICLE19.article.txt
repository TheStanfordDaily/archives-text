# 'Paul And Michelle' Reunites 'Friends'
## 
### DAN FORTE 
"It seems to me a crime that we
should age-;
These fragile times should never
slip us by.
A time you never can or shall
erase.
As friends together watch their
childhoods fly."
At the end of Friends, when
Michelle waved good-bye to Paul
for the last time before he was
apprehended by the police and
taken back to his father, it looked
as though the two young lovers
would never see each other again.
But, thanks to producer-director
screen writer Lewis Gilbert,
despite such an incredibly grim
ending, the two are temporarily
reunited in a sequel entitled Paul
and Michelle.
Friends, for the million or so
who missed it, was a sort of Love
Story for ninth-graders; about a
15-year-old rich English boy, Paul,
and a 14-year-old French orphan
girl, Michelle, who meet, run away
together, fall in love, and have a
baby. Paul and Michelle features
Sean Bury and Anice Alvina still
in the title roles.
Although Friends was criticized
by some (and justly so) as
unrealistic, clicheish, and
amateurish, I for one liked it.
Realism was not one of its
objectives, and the actors,

although very unprofessional, had
certain qualities lacking in
professionals which suited their
innocent, groping characters
nicely.
(One element not present here,
which was one of the major selling
points of Friends, is the
above-quoted music of Elton John
and Bernie Taupin, who have
apparently priced their way out of
the film industry.)
The film begins three years
after their separation, with Paul,
now 18, graduating from high
school and beginning his search
for Michelle.

He finds her, and their
daughter Sylvie, living with a
32-year-old American pilot named
Gary, played by Keir Dullea, of
2001 ... A Space Odyssey.
Still in love, the two struggle
together to keep Paul in school at
the university while still
supporting their daughter.
Finally, they decide it can't
work under the circumstances, so
they part ways once again, vowing
that it is "only for the time
being." '
Alvina, the more natural of the
two young actors, is as beautiful
as she was in Friends, only this

time in high heels; Bury is as
unconvincing as before. Alvina
seems to hold potential for better
parts, while Bury can only hope
for a third sequel.
Dullea comes off as more of a
villain than perhaps he should,
with his overbearing jealousy over
his young competitor. The viewer,
while rooting for Paul to win
"what's rightfully his," forgets on
the one hand that Gary has been
supporting Michelle and Sylvie for
more than six months, but, on the
other hand, also overlooks the
fact that a 32-year-old man is
living with a 17-year-old girl! The
character is grossly
underdeveloped.
The main problem with Paul
and Michelle is that the build-up
(the search for Michelle) and the
resolution (their temporary
separation) are too short, and

everything in between is too long.
At one hour and 40 minutes, the
film begins to drag after the first
hour.
Another major flaw is that the
ending does not make much sense.
Why would it be easier for
Michelle to take care of Sylvie
alone than for the two of them to
go on working while Paul stays in
school? Is that a solution?
No, but it has the makings for
another sequel. Paul and Michelle
and Sylvie? (Let's hope next time
John and Taupin return for an
encore soundtrack.)
"Making friends for the world to
see.
Let the people know you got
what you need.
With a friend at hand, you will see
the light.
If your friends are there, then
everything's all right."
