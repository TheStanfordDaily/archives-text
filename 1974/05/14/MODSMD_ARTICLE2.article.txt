# Court Says Government Taps Illegal

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court held yesterday that the
Nixon administration violated federal
law in a host of wiretaps against
narcotics and organized crime
suspects.
The court's decision washes out
cases against some 600 defendants and
perhaps more, because the evidence
gathered in defective taps may not be
used at trial.
The wiretap decision stemmed from
practices at the Justice Department
when it was run by former Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell.
The taps in question were
authorized in each instance by a
federal judge.
The question in the case was
whether the Justice Department had
complied with provisions of the 1968
Omnibus Crime Control Act in
applying for the taps in the first three
years following the act's adoption.
The court found that the practice
of allowing Mitchell's executive
assistant to approve applications was
contrary to the law's demand that the
requests be approved by the attorney
general himself or a specifically
designated assistant attorney general.
The court was unanimous in
condemning the practice. Justice
Byron R. White delivered the court's
opinion.
White noted that the Nixon
Administration insisted that it should
have wide latitude in delegating the
attorney general's authority to request
wiretaps because the federal law grants
wide latitude grants among state
officials in approving wiretaps
requests.
In a second wiretap case the court
did preserve some challenged taps.
The applications bore the name of
an assistant attorney general but were
actually approved by Mitchell himself.
The court found this no barrier to
use of evidence gathered by the taps.
