# Uri Geller Melts Spoons, Skepticism
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
The crook between the bowl of
the spoon and the handle began to
bend, slowly at first, gradually
turning to a putty-like
consistency.
The handle of the spoon
dangled and broke off.
When Uri Geller, 27 year-old
Israeli super-psychic,
demonstrated his abilities last
Tuesday at an Esalen symposium
at the St. Francis Hotel, there was
little doubt as to the authenticity
of his talents.
Circled by 40 people no farther
away than ten feet, videotaped
and photographed by no fewer

than 10 people, Geller bent and
broke a spoon merely by stroking
the handle gently with his fingers.
Geller held the two pieces of
the spoon before the video
camera, showing that they didn't
fit back together. Some of the
metal from the point of fracture
was evidently missing. Geller
explained that objects which he
has bent or broken show a loss of
mass when weighed.
Only Twice
After several months of testing
at Stanford Research Institute,
Geller gave two public
demonstrations last May in
Memorial Auditorium. While one

of those demonstrations was a
near total failure, one was fairly
successful. Last Tuesday, Geller
failed only twice.
"If this hall was packed with
negative people, unbelievers,
magicians, let's say," explains
Geller, "psychologically I'd close
up."
Geller was far from closed
before the 400 people who paid
$22.50 for tickets to the
symposium. Geller successfully
bent and broke a spoon, bent a
key, fixed a watch and correctly
identified colors, cities and
abstract designs drawn on a
blackboard which Geller could

not see.
Geller failed to identify
Caracas when that city was "sent"
to him by the audience. He also
failed to describe the clothing of a
woman from the audience while
blindfolded. When the city was
changed to Dublin, Geller
identified it; he also succeeded in
describing the clothing of a
second woman.
Different Colors
Although Geller thought his
audience was overall very positive,
some members of the audience
apparently took it upon
themselves to test Geller by
thinking different colors than
those written on the blackboard.
In one experiment, a woman
from the audience wrote the color
yellow on the blackboard. Geller
and a second woman faced toward
the audience, away from the
board. After the audience had
seen the color, it was erased.
Geller then asked the audience
to repeat the color in their minds.
He attempted to identify the
color and then send the color to
the second woman. Geller wrote
the color on a piece of paper.
The woman claimed to have
received a shade of green; Geller
had sent the correct color, yellow,
but had also received green, and
had written both down on the
piece of paper.
"Uri, I sent you green, man,"
announced a voice from the
audience. "I had to test you. I
mean, I paid $22.50."
Geller has faced many tests
since his public debut in 1970.
Magician Charles Reynolds claims
in the current issue of Popular
Photography that Geller
accomplishes his feats by bending
keys against tables or using
pre-bent spoons. Time magazine
has also called Geller a fraud.
"Maybe a magician can
duplicate it if he has 10 bent keys
in his pocket, but this is real,"
Geller argues.
SRI Odds
On the other side of the great
Geller controversy, SRI
researchers Harold E. Puthoff and

Russell Targ have tested Geller at
psychic feats in which the odds
against him accomplishing the
same results by chance were one
in a trillion.
In one SRI experiment, Geller
correctly selected a can containing
a metal ball from among nine
other empty cans. He then
repeated this test with a can filled
with water. Geller also identified
the roll of a die inside a closed
container at odds of one in a
million.
Geller has received numerous
challenges from magicians, but
dismisses all comers by
challenging them to repeat his
results at SRI. So far, there have
been no takers.
"Everyone goes out of here
and says, 'But what if it's real? My
God, but what if it's really real?' "
explains Geller. Geller believes
that by doing public
demonstrations he will gradually
be able to dissolve people's
skepticims.
However, the publication of a
new book, Uri — A Journal of the
Mystery of Uri Geller, written by
Geller's associate Dr. Andrija
Puharich, may start a new rash of
skepticism even among believers
by claiming that Geller's powers
come from extraterrestrial beings.
"Every word that was written
in the book is true," says Geller.
"I am not going to back out from
the truth. I don't care if people
think I am crazy."
'The Nine'
It was Puharich who originally
brought Geller to the United
States from Israel. Puharich claims
that Geller is earth's only contact
with The Nine, beings who are the
overloads of the universe.
"I call them intelligent energies
because I don't know what they
are," says Geller, disagreeing with
Puharich who definitely calls The
Nine "beings."
In support of the
extraterrestrial theory, Geller cites
a New York Times poll: "They
were amazed that 51 percent (of
the population) believe in UFOs —
that's more than (believe in)
Nixon."
Despite his more vehement
claims that what Puharich has
written is true, some of Geller's
other statements seem to indicate
his disagreement with the author.
While Puharich claims that Geller
is an exclusive link with The Nine,
Geller feels that others can learn
to do what he does.
To learn, Geller thinks people
need only sit around and try to
send messages to their friends.
"Unfortunately, people just give it
up if it doesn't work," he says
while urging his audience to keep
practicing.
Allegedly 12 children in
England learned to bend metal
just by watching Geller on
television. Geller sees this as an
encouraging sign that someday his
form of communication will be
"an everyday thing."
Bent Beams
Geller also feels that he himself
is only learning. "I learned at SRI.
I didn't know I could bend laser
beams or wipe video tapes from a
distance."
Like many Geller feats, the
bending of laser beams has not
been tested in a controlled
experiment. Objects have been
reported to disappear and
reappear in Geller's presence;
cameras break, tapes are erased.
"If Nixon was clever, he'd
invite me to the White House just
for five minutes and he'd blame
me," jokes Geller. But on a more
serious level he adds, "When I
erased video tapes at SRI, the
Defense Department was there the
next day."
Geller plans to include his
encounters with various
governments in a proposed
autobiography. If indeed his
powers are genuine, one might
expect him to be a much sought
after item by scientists of various
nations, and Geller does claim
that he has been approached by
the United States and the USSR
as well as by his native Israel.
"I think that if I say everything
I'll protect myself," is about all
the comment Geller will make on
his brushes with the powerful
forces of politics.
He's Human
What if Geller's powers are
real? Asked if he would teach
what he knows, Geller responds,
"I want to stay human. I am
doing what I like doing. I like
appearing on stage. I like
traveling around the world, and I
like meeting people."
Acknowledging the fact that he
could if he so desired become a
guru with millions of disciples,
Geller also refuses to attempt
healing.
"Look, if I start healing,
tomorrow the AMA will write
such a negative article about
me .. .
Above all, Geller's sixth sense
seems to be tempered with horse
sense, whether extraterrestrial or
earthly in origin.

PSYCHIC OR CHARLATAN?—Uri Geller, seen here as he appeared last year in Memorial Auditorium,
demonstrated his powers in San Francisco last Tuesday. Both Time and Popular Photography claim that
his amazing feats are fakes.
The crook between the bowl of
the spoon and the handle began to
bend, slowly at first, gradually
turning to a putty-like
consistency.
The handle of the spoon
dangled and broke off.
When Uri Geller, 27 year-old
Israeli super-psychic,
demonstrated his abilities last
Tuesday at an Esalen symposium
at the St. Francis Hotel, there was
little doubt as to the authenticity
of his talents.
Circled by 40 people no farther
away than ten feet, videotaped
and photographed by no fewer

than 10 people, Geller bent and
broke a spoon merely by stroking
the handle gently with his fingers.
Geller held the two pieces of
the spoon before the video
camera, showing that they didn't
fit back together. Some of the
metal from the point of fracture
was evidently missing. Geller
explained that objects which he
has bent or broken show a loss of
mass when weighed.
Only Twice
After several months of testing
at Stanford Research Institute,
Geller gave two public
demonstrations last May in
Memorial Auditorium. While one

of those demonstrations was a
near total failure, one was fairly
successful. Last Tuesday, Geller
failed only twice.
"If this hall was packed with
negative people, unbelievers,
magicians, let's say," explains
Geller, "psychologically I'd close
up."
Geller was far from closed
before the 400 people who paid
$22.50 for tickets to the
symposium. Geller successfully
bent and broke a spoon, bent a
key, fixed a watch and correctly
identified colors, cities and
abstract designs drawn on a
blackboard which Geller could

not see.
Geller failed to identify
Caracas when that city was "sent"
to him by the audience. He also
failed to describe the clothing of a
woman from the audience while
blindfolded. When the city was
changed to Dublin, Geller
identified it; he also succeeded in
describing the clothing of a
second woman.
Different Colors
Although Geller thought his
audience was overall very positive,
some members of the audience
apparently took it upon
themselves to test Geller by
thinking different colors than
those written on the blackboard.
In one experiment, a woman
from the audience wrote the color
yellow on the blackboard. Geller
and a second woman faced toward
the audience, away from the
board. After the audience had
seen the color, it was erased.
Geller then asked the audience
to repeat the color in their minds.
He attempted to identify the
color and then send the color to
the second woman. Geller wrote
the color on a piece of paper.
The woman claimed to have
received a shade of green; Geller
had sent the correct color, yellow,
but had also received green, and
had written both down on the
piece of paper.
"Uri, I sent you green, man,"
announced a voice from the
audience. "I had to test you. I
mean, I paid $22.50."
Geller has faced many tests
since his public debut in 1970.
Magician Charles Reynolds claims
in the current issue of Popular
Photography that Geller
accomplishes his feats by bending
keys against tables or using
pre-bent spoons. Time magazine
has also called Geller a fraud.
"Maybe a magician can
duplicate it if he has 10 bent keys
in his pocket, but this is real,"
Geller argues.
SRI Odds
On the other side of the great
Geller controversy, SRI
researchers Harold E. Puthoff and

Russell Targ have tested Geller at
psychic feats in which the odds
against him accomplishing the
same results by chance were one
in a trillion.
In one SRI experiment, Geller
correctly selected a can containing
a metal ball from among nine
other empty cans. He then
repeated this test with a can filled
with water. Geller also identified
the roll of a die inside a closed
container at odds of one in a
million.
Geller has received numerous
challenges from magicians, but
dismisses all comers by
challenging them to repeat his
results at SRI. So far, there have
been no takers.
"Everyone goes out of here
and says, 'But what if it's real? My
God, but what if it's really real?' "
explains Geller. Geller believes
that by doing public
demonstrations he will gradually
be able to dissolve people's
skepticims.
However, the publication of a
new book, Uri — A Journal of the
Mystery of Uri Geller, written by
Geller's associate Dr. Andrija
Puharich, may start a new rash of
skepticism even among believers
by claiming that Geller's powers
come from extraterrestrial beings.
"Every word that was written
in the book is true," says Geller.
"I am not going to back out from
the truth. I don't care if people
think I am crazy."
'The Nine'
It was Puharich who originally
brought Geller to the United
States from Israel. Puharich claims
that Geller is earth's only contact
with The Nine, beings who are the
overloads of the universe.
"I call them intelligent energies
because I don't know what they
are," says Geller, disagreeing with
Puharich who definitely calls The
Nine "beings."
In support of the
extraterrestrial theory, Geller cites
a New York Times poll: "They
were amazed that 51 percent (of
the population) believe in UFOs —
that's more than (believe in)
Nixon."
Despite his more vehement
claims that what Puharich has
written is true, some of Geller's
other statements seem to indicate
his disagreement with the author.
While Puharich claims that Geller
is an exclusive link with The Nine,
Geller feels that others can learn
to do what he does.
To learn, Geller thinks people
need only sit around and try to
send messages to their friends.
"Unfortunately, people just give it
up if it doesn't work," he says
while urging his audience to keep
practicing.
Allegedly 12 children in
England learned to bend metal
just by watching Geller on
television. Geller sees this as an
encouraging sign that someday his
form of communication will be
"an everyday thing."
Bent Beams
Geller also feels that he himself
is only learning. "I learned at SRI.
I didn't know I could bend laser
beams or wipe video tapes from a
distance."
Like many Geller feats, the
bending of laser beams has not
been tested in a controlled
experiment. Objects have been
reported to disappear and
reappear in Geller's presence;
cameras break, tapes are erased.
"If Nixon was clever, he'd
invite me to the White House just
for five minutes and he'd blame
me," jokes Geller. But on a more
serious level he adds, "When I
erased video tapes at SRI, the
Defense Department was there the
next day."
Geller plans to include his
encounters with various
governments in a proposed
autobiography. If indeed his
powers are genuine, one might
expect him to be a much sought
after item by scientists of various
nations, and Geller does claim
that he has been approached by

PSYCHIC OR CHARLATAN?—Uri Geller, seen here as he appeared last year in Memorial Auditorium,
demonstrated his powers in San Francisco last Tuesday. Both Time and Popular Photography claim that
his amazing feats are fakes.
The crook between the bowl of
the spoon and the handle began to
bend, slowly at first, gradually
turning to a putty-like
consistency.
The handle of the spoon
dangled and broke off.
When Uri Geller, 27 year-old
Israeli super-psychic,
demonstrated his abilities last
Tuesday at an Esalen symposium
at the St. Francis Hotel, there was
little doubt as to the authenticity
of his talents.
Circled by 40 people no farther
away than ten feet, videotaped
and photographed by no fewer

than 10 people, Geller bent and
broke a spoon merely by stroking
the handle gently with his fingers.
Geller held the two pieces of
the spoon before the video
camera, showing that they didn't
fit back together. Some of the
metal from the point of fracture
was evidently missing. Geller
explained that objects which he
has bent or broken show a loss of
mass when weighed.
Only Twice
After several months of testing
at Stanford Research Institute,
Geller gave two public
demonstrations last May in
Memorial Auditorium. While one

of those demonstrations was a
near total failure, one was fairly
successful. Last Tuesday, Geller
failed only twice.
"If this hall was packed with
negative people, unbelievers,
magicians, let's say," explains
Geller, "psychologically I'd close
up."
Geller was far from closed
before the 400 people who paid
$22.50 for tickets to the
symposium. Geller successfully
bent and broke a spoon, bent a
key, fixed a watch and correctly
identified colors, cities and
abstract designs drawn on a
blackboard which Geller could

not see.
Geller failed to identify
Caracas when that city was "sent"
to him by the audience. He also
failed to describe the clothing of a
woman from the audience while
blindfolded. When the city was
changed to Dublin, Geller
identified it; he also succeeded in
describing the clothing of a
second woman.
Different Colors
Although Geller thought his
audience was overall very positive,
some members of the audience
apparently took it upon
themselves to test Geller by
thinking different colors than
those written on the blackboard.
In one experiment, a woman
from the audience wrote the color
yellow on the blackboard. Geller
and a second woman faced toward
the audience, away from the
board. After the audience had
seen the color, it was erased.
Geller then asked the audience
to repeat the color in their minds.
He attempted to identify the
color and then send the color to
the second woman. Geller wrote
the color on a piece of paper.
The woman claimed to have
received a shade of green; Geller
had sent the correct color, yellow,
but had also received green, and
had written both down on the
piece of paper.
"Uri, I sent you green, man,"
announced a voice from the
audience. "I had to test you. I
mean, I paid $22.50."
Geller has faced many tests
since his public debut in 1970.
Magician Charles Reynolds claims
in the current issue of Popular
Photography that Geller
accomplishes his feats by bending
keys against tables or using
pre-bent spoons. Time magazine
has also called Geller a fraud.
"Maybe a magician can
duplicate it if he has 10 bent keys
in his pocket, but this is real,"
Geller argues.
SRI Odds
On the other side of the great
Geller controversy, SRI
researchers Harold E. Puthoff and

Russell Targ have tested Geller at
psychic feats in which the odds
against him accomplishing the
same results by chance were one
in a trillion.
In one SRI experiment, Geller
correctly selected a can containing
a metal ball from among nine
other empty cans. He then
repeated this test with a can filled
with water. Geller also identified
the roll of a die inside a closed
container at odds of one in a
million.
Geller has received numerous
challenges from magicians, but
dismisses all comers by
challenging them to repeat his
results at SRI. So far, there have
been no takers.
"Everyone goes out of here
and says, 'But what if it's real? My
God, but what if it's really real?' "
explains Geller. Geller believes
that by doing public
demonstrations he will gradually
be able to dissolve people's
skepticims.
However, the publication of a
new book, Uri — A Journal of the
Mystery of Uri Geller, written by
Geller's associate Dr. Andrija
Puharich, may start a new rash of
skepticism even among believers
by claiming that Geller's powers
come from extraterrestrial beings.
"Every word that was written
in the book is true," says Geller.
"I am not going to back out from
the truth. I don't care if people
think I am crazy."
'The Nine'
It was Puharich who originally
brought Geller to the United
States from Israel. Puharich claims
that Geller is earth's only contact
with The Nine, beings who are the
overloads of the universe.
"I call them intelligent energies
because I don't know what they
are," says Geller, disagreeing with
Puharich who definitely calls The
Nine "beings."
In support of the
extraterrestrial theory, Geller cites
a New York Times poll: "They
were amazed that 51 percent (of
the population) believe in UFOs —
that's more than (believe in)
Nixon."
Despite his more vehement
claims that what Puharich has
written is true, some of Geller's
other statements seem to indicate
his disagreement with the author.
While Puharich claims that Geller
is an exclusive link with The Nine,
Geller feels that others can learn

skepticims.
However, the publication of a
new book, Uri — A Journal of the
Mystery of Uri Geller, written by
Geller's associate Dr. Andrija
Puharich, may start a new rash of
skepticism even among believers
by claiming that Geller's powers
come from extraterrestrial beings.
"Every word that was written
in the book is true," says Geller.
"I am not going to back out from
the truth. I don't care if people
think I am crazy."
'The Nine'
It was Puharich who originally
brought Geller to the United
States from Israel. Puharich claims
that Geller is earth's only contact
with The Nine, beings who are the
overloads of the universe.
"I call them intelligent energies
because I don't know what they
are," says Geller, disagreeing with
Puharich who definitely calls The
Nine "beings."
In support of the
extraterrestrial theory, Geller cites
a New York Times poll: "They
were amazed that 51 percent (of
the population) believe in UFOs —
that's more than (believe in)
Nixon."
Despite his more vehement
claims that what Puharich has
written is true, some of Geller's
other statements seem to indicate
his disagreement with the author.
While Puharich claims that Geller
is an exclusive link with The Nine,
Geller feels that others can learn
to do what he does.
To learn, Geller thinks people
need only sit around and try to
send messages to their friends.
"Unfortunately, people just give it
up if it doesn't work," he says
while urging his audience to keep
practicing.
Allegedly 12 children in
England learned to bend metal
just by watching Geller on
television. Geller sees this as an
encouraging sign that someday his
form of communication will be
"an everyday thing."
Bent Beams
Geller also feels that he himself
is only learning. "I learned at SRI.
I didn't know I could bend laser
beams or wipe video tapes from a
distance."
Like many Geller feats, the
bending of laser beams has not
been tested in a controlled
experiment. Objects have been
reported to disappear and
reappear in Geller's presence;
cameras break, tapes are erased.
"If Nixon was clever, he'd
invite me to the White House just
for five minutes and he'd blame
me," jokes Geller. But on a more
serious level he adds, "When I
erased video tapes at SRI, the
Defense Department was there the
next day."
Geller plans to include his
encounters with various
governments in a proposed
autobiography. If indeed his
powers are genuine, one might
expect him to be a much sought
after item by scientists of various
nations, and Geller does claim
that he has been approached by
the United States and the USSR
as well as by his native Israel.
"I think that if I say everything
I'll protect myself," is about all
the comment Geller will make on
his brushes with the powerful
forces of politics.
He's Human
What if Geller's powers are
real? Asked if he would teach
what he knows, Geller responds,
"I want to stay human. I am
doing what I like doing. I like
appearing on stage. I like
traveling around the world, and I
like meeting people."
Acknowledging the fact that he
could if he so desired become a
guru with millions of disciples,
Geller also refuses to attempt
healing.
"Look, if I start healing,
tomorrow the AMA will write
such a negative article about
me .. .
Above all, Geller's sixth sense
seems to be tempered with horse
sense, whether extraterrestrial or
earthly in origin.

PSYCHIC OR CHARLATAN?—Uri Geller, seen here as he appeared last year in Memorial Auditorium,
demonstrated his powers in San Francisco last Tuesday. Both Time and Popular Photography claim that
his amazing feats are fakes.
The crook between the bowl of
the spoon and the handle began to
bend, slowly at first, gradually
turning to a putty-like
consistency.
The handle of the spoon
dangled and broke off.
When Uri Geller, 27 year-old
Israeli super-psychic,
demonstrated his abilities last
Tuesday at an Esalen symposium
at the St. Francis Hotel, there was
little doubt as to the authenticity
of his talents.
Circled by 40 people no farther
away than ten feet, videotaped
and photographed by no fewer

than 10 people, Geller bent and
broke a spoon merely by stroking
the handle gently with his fingers.
Geller held the two pieces of
the spoon before the video
camera, showing that they didn't
fit back together. Some of the
metal from the point of fracture
was evidently missing. Geller
explained that objects which he
has bent or broken show a loss of
mass when weighed.
Only Twice
After several months of testing
at Stanford Research Institute,
Geller gave two public
demonstrations last May in
Memorial Auditorium. While one

of those demonstrations was a
near total failure, one was fairly
successful. Last Tuesday, Geller
failed only twice.
"If this hall was packed with
negative people, unbelievers,
magicians, let's say," explains
Geller, "psychologically I'd close
up."
Geller was far from closed
before the 400 people who paid
$22.50 for tickets to the
symposium. Geller successfully
bent and broke a spoon, bent a
key, fixed a watch and correctly
identified colors, cities and
abstract designs drawn on a
blackboard which Geller could

not see.
Geller failed to identify
Caracas when that city was "sent"
to him by the audience. He also
failed to describe the clothing of a
woman from the audience while
blindfolded. When the city was
changed to Dublin, Geller
identified it; he also succeeded in
describing the clothing of a
second woman.
Different Colors
Although Geller thought his
audience was overall very positive,
some members of the audience
apparently took it upon
themselves to test Geller by
thinking different colors than
those written on the blackboard.
In one experiment, a woman
from the audience wrote the color
yellow on the blackboard. Geller
and a second woman faced toward
the audience, away from the
board. After the audience had
seen the color, it was erased.
Geller then asked the audience
to repeat the color in their minds.
He attempted to identify the
color and then send the color to
the second woman. Geller wrote
the color on a piece of paper.
The woman claimed to have
received a shade of green; Geller
had sent the correct color, yellow,
but had also received green, and
had written both down on the
piece of paper.
"Uri, I sent you green, man,"
announced a voice from the
audience. "I had to test you. I
mean, I paid $22.50."
Geller has faced many tests
since his public debut in 1970.
Magician Charles Reynolds claims
in the current issue of Popular
Photography that Geller
accomplishes his feats by bending
keys against tables or using
pre-bent spoons. Time magazine
has also called Geller a fraud.
"Maybe a magician can
duplicate it if he has 10 bent keys
in his pocket, but this is real,"
Geller argues.
SRI Odds
On the other side of the great
Geller controversy, SRI
researchers Harold E. Puthoff and

Russell Targ have tested Geller at
psychic feats in which the odds
against him accomplishing the
same results by chance were one
in a trillion.
In one SRI experiment, Geller
correctly selected a can containing
a metal ball from among nine
other empty cans. He then
repeated this test with a can filled
with water. Geller also identified
the roll of a die inside a closed
container at odds of one in a
million.
Geller has received numerous
challenges from magicians, but
dismisses all comers by
challenging them to repeat his
results at SRI. So far, there have
been no takers.
"Everyone goes out of here
and says, 'But what if it's real? My
God, but what if it's really real?' "
explains Geller. Geller believes
that by doing public
demonstrations he will gradually
be able to dissolve people's
skepticims.
However, the publication of a
new book, Uri — A Journal of the
Mystery of Uri Geller, written by
