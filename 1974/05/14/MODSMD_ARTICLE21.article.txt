## Blues Class Hears Fine Guitar

Country blues guitarist Robert
Lowery played more than thirty
songs Monday night, May 6, to an
audience of about 60 people in
Stern's Burbank Lounge, as part
of the "History of the Blues."
Being from Arkansas, Lowery's
style alternated between the
Texas and Mississippi blues styles
with an occasional urban-type
number thrown in. On his
steel-bodied guitar, he played
either with or without a
bottleneck slide.
Lowery, 44, has been playing
guitar for over twenty years, and
seems to know every blues tune
ever written.
After playing intense
renditions of three songs by the

late Robert Johnson, Lowery was
asked if he knew "Me and the
Devil." He came up with perhaps
his best performance of the night,
after which one student remarked,
"I think the Devil brought Robert
Johnson back to life." His voice
bears a remarkable resemblance to
Johnson's.
The slide guitar of Muddy
Waters, one of Johnson's disciples,
was illustrated on Lowery's
versions of "Louisiana Blues,"
"Country Boy," and"I Be's
Troubled," one of Muddy's
earliest recordings.
The Lightnin' Hopkins, Texas
style was recalled on "Death Bell
Blues" and "Katie Mae:"
"Some folks say she's built like a

Cadillac; I do believe that she's
a T-Model Ford.
Y'know she's shaped up all right,
she just can't carry no heavy
load."
One of his best selections of the
urban type was Jimmy Reed's
"You Don't Have To Go."
Robert Lowery is not a name
familiar to the average layperson,
or even to the educated blues fan.
He has never been recorded,
which is extremely unfortunate
since there are very few people
carrying on the country blues
tradition. His unique, high-pitched
voice and versatile guitar playing
should definitely be preserved on
record.
