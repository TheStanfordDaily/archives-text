Demo Leaders Oppose Resignation
WASHINGTON — The top Democratic leaders of
Congress pleaded yesterday for an end to calls for President
Nixon's resignation, saying they are fanning a flash fire of
public opinion that could forever char the Republic.
"Resignation is not the answer," said Majority Leader
Mike Mansfield, D-Mont. "This is a time to keep cool — the
expression, I believe, is 'cool it.' "
The President himself, meanwhile, was quoted by a
cabinet member as reaffirming yesterday that "there isn't
any chance. . . whatever," of his stepping down
voluntarily.
Senate Democratic Whip Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia declared that if Nixon were "drummed out of
office" by public opinion, "this would change our system
from one of fixed tenure to one in which a President would
remain in office only by popular approval."
Byrd and Mansfield were joined by House Speaker Carl
Albert, D-Okla., and a number of others at the Capitol in
asking Americans to let the case against the President lay
exclusively in the hands of the courts and the impeachment
process.
Byrd said if Nixon resigned, his guilt or innocence might
never be resolved. "Nothing is more important to the
nation than the exercise of sober judgment," he said.
Reinecke: Implied Immunity
WASHINGTON — California Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke
testified yesterday that federal prosecutors who have
brought a perjury indictment against him implied they
would not do so if he cooperated in their investigation.
One of the prosecutors denied that any threats or deals
were extended to Reinecke.
Reinecke testified at a pre-trial hearing at which U.S.
District Judge Barrington Parker called for final arguments
this morning on motions by the lieutenant governor's
attorneys to dismiss the three-count indictment or, failing
that, shift the trial to San Francisco or Sacramento.
Reinecke is a candidate for the GOP nomination for
governor of California.
Reinecke testified that he first met with Joseph J.
Connolly, an assistant Watergate prosecutor, last July 30
and was told that "if I wanted to preserve my credibility I
ought to stop talking to the press ...
"There was a possibility I could be more helpful to them
as a constructive material witness than as a defendant," he
said.
"Did you get the impression you might not be
prosecuted?" asked one of his attorneys, James E. Cox.
Reinecke: "It was certainly implied by
Connolly ... that I was marginal in the entire arena."
In other related matters, the President's lawyers
appeared before U.S. Judge John J. Sirica, to argue that the
White House should not be required to turn over any more
Watergate tapes to the special prosecutor.
Earlier, Sirica announced he would make public in about
two weeks the final report by an independent panel of
experts on the 18'/2-minute gap in the June 20, 1972
conversation between Nixon and former White House chief
of staff H.R. Haldeman.
He also received a report on the same matter from an
expert working on behalf of the White House.
Truckers Ignore Strike Call
Independent truckers kept their rigs rolling yesterday,
generally ignoring a call for a nationwide strike over fuel
prices and speed limits.
There was scattered violence, but authorities in most
areas said truck traffic was normal.
"We've got zero problems," said Bill Clark, a Maryland
State Police spokesman.
Militants who called for the latest shutdown claimed it

was highly effective in several areas, but their estimates
could not be confirmed.
A spokesman for state police in Pennsylvania, where
earlier shutdowns sparked violence and cut traffic, said,
"Truck traffic is smooth and normal in volume and every
other way. This is just an ordinary day."
He said 11 incidents of violence had been reported, most
minor and most before daybreak.
Other violence was reported in Georgia, Tennessee,
Kentucky and Oklahoma. Most of the incidents involved
windshields smashed by rocks or sniper fire, and no injuries
were reported.
Ford: Transcripts Exonerate Nixon
PENSACOLA, Fla. — Vice President Gerald R. Ford said
last night that "the overwhelming weight of the evidence"
of the Watergate transcripts proves President Nixon
innocent of any wrongdoing in Watergate.
But he said the constitutional processes of impeachment
which are now underway "must proceed."
"I admire and have great affection for our President,"
Ford said. He said after reading the edited White House
transcripts, "the overwhelming weight of the evidence
proves the President is innocent."
Ford spoke for about 30 minutes and left immediately
after the speech for Washington.
Italians Opt For Pro-Divorce Law
ROME — Italians lined up almost 3-2 behind the nation's
divorce law yesterday after a bitter referendum campaign in
this Roman Catholic nation. The voters handed a rebuff to
the government and to the Vatican.
With 26 million ballots counted — about 80 percent of
the vote — the pro-divorce share was about 59.1 percent.
It could mean serious trouble for the center-left
coalition government of Premier Mariano Rumor, whose
Christian Democrats strongly advocated repeal of the law.
The bishops urged church members to do away with the
law and Pope Paul VI said he fully supported the views of
his bishops.
Magee Retracts Guilty Plea
SAN JOSE — Black convict Ruchell Magee, saying he
was intimidated and tricked, requested permission
yesterday to retract his guilty plea to aggravated kidnaping
charges in the 1970 Marin County Courthouse escape
attempt.
"I wish to withdraw my plea of guilty on grounds that it
was unlawful and illegal," a handcuffed Magee told the
court.
"This plea was taken by the force of harassment and
intimidation by court-appointed counsel and the
prosecution."
Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge William A.
Ingram set a hearing tomorrow for Magee to argue the plea
change.
Charges against Magee were reduced to aggravated
kidnaping after his first trial on charges of murder, kidnap
and assault ended in a hung jury.
A judge, two convicts and their accomplice were killed
on Aug. 7, 1970, after hostages were taken at gunpoint
from a San Rafael courtroom. Magee was wounded.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with low clouds along the
coast beginning tonight.
Lows tonight in mid 40s to low 50s. Highs today and
tomorrow in mid 60s to mid 70s except for upper 50s near
the coast tomorrow. West to northwest wind 10 to 20 mph
in afternoons and evenings.
