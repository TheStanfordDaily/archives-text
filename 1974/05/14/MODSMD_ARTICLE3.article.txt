# Colorado Faculty Council Asks Franklin Review
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Faculty Council at the
University of Colorado voted 22-8 last
week to request the Board of Regents
to again consider hiring former
Stanford English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin.
Regent Geraldine Bean told the
Daily yesterday that the matter will
appear on the May 23 agenda of the
regents' meeting, but emphasized that
it is unlikely that the board will
change its decision not to hire
Franklin.
On April 25, the regents voted 8-1
not to accept the English department
recommendation that Franklin —
dismissed from Stanford in 1972 for
allegedly inciting students to violence
— be hired.
Meanwhile, the University of
Colorado student government is
attempting to persuade the board to
change its decision, according to Anita
Sanchez, student government

co-president.
ACLU Suit?
Sanchez said the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) is considering
a suit against the board. Claiming that
the board was prejudiced against
Franklin for political reasons, Sanchez
said if the ACLU fails to sue the
Board, the University of Colorado
student government will probably
initiate a lawsuit.
Sanchez said a large number of
students support the move to force the
board to hire Franklin, although she
lamented that the majority of the
University's 18,000 students are
apathetic.
Sanchez claimed that those
students who have an opinion on the
matter overwhelmingly support
Franklin.
Bean said she had not heard of the
proposed lawsuits, but agreed the
board voted against Franklin, an
avowed Maoist, because he was
considered a threat to the University.
Confusion
Bean, the sole dissenter on the
board in its decision not to hire
Franklin, noted there was originally
much confusion about how she cast
her vote. Some publications including
the Daily, wrongly assumed that she
had voted against Franklin's
appointment.
Franklin told the Daily yesterday
that ths board should reconsider the
question of appointment
because the board was previously
influenced by what he called a
"vicious" slur campaign.
Franklin charged again that the
Stanford administration sent a packet
of damaging and distorting material to
the Colorado board early this spring.

The packet included "carefully
selected clippings" that gave the board
a distorted view of his beliefs and
participation in leftist activities,
Franklin insisted.
The Stanford administration has
repeatedly denied the charges.
Propaganda
Bean said yesterday that the board
was indeed sent a packet of
anti-Franklin propaganda, but she said
she doubted the Stanford
administration sent it.
Franklin said he was particularly
disturbed by a June 1972 article from
Change magazine that he claimed was
sent to the board. The article
contained numerous factual errors and
although a retraction was published in
Oct. 1972, the retraction wasn't sent
to the board, he said.
Franklin said he is also deeply

disturbed by a packet of information
sent last month to Ronald James,
editor of the University of Colorado
alumni newspaper by Robert Beyers,
director of Stanford's University News
Service.
Claiming that the packet was
"really an attempt to do a hatchet
job," Franklin claimed that the
information given contained
"everything bad and nothing good."
Franklin noted that James had
shown him the material during a
recent visit to the University of
Colorado. He complained that the
articles made no mention of the fact
that he has published 10 books and 30
scholarly articles.
James acknowledged that none of
Franklin's scholarly accomplishments
were mentioned in the material, but
added that he had not asked Beyers
for any resume.
Beyers said while his office sent a
packet to James, it was mailed after
the decision of the Board not to hire
Franklin, and was not biased against
Franklin.
