# USE, University Talks Temporarily Recessed

Contract negotiations between the
University and the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union were
temporarily suspended until Thursday
or Friday because of the confusion
generated by the first day of the
union's strike yesterday.
University negotiator Douglas
Barton said yesterday's scheduled
bargaining session was aborted when it
became evident that USE president
and negotiator Jim Berk would be
unable to attend the session because of
his involvement in coordinating the
strike.
'There is always a period at the
beginning of a strike when it doesn't
prove too fruitful to negotiate," said
Barton.
Barton said the bargaining teams
would let negotiations slide for a day
or two.
The University bargaining team met
with federal mediator Clarence
Washington yesterday morning and
discussed their bargaining position.
'The road ahead is still a long one
in terms of the issues to be resolved,"
added Barton.
Pickets in front of the education

building protesting a non-union
projectionist running a film in
Cubberley Auditorium also forced
University negotiators to conclude
yesterday's session held in a nearby
room.
Negotiations are not usually carried
out behind union picket lines.
In a press conference yesterday
morning, Barton said that weekend
negotiating sessions had yielded "very
significant progress" on the grievance
procedure to be included in the
contract.
Barton said the two sides were
"pretty close" to complete agreement
on the contract article and that it
might be signed off soon. The two
parties have yet to sign off any
contract article.
The union's demand for a 23
percent increase in wages and benefits
was "still clearly too high," however.
Barton said.
Berk said yesterday that he thought
the two teams were "light years apart"
on most issues. He agreed the
grievance procedure article was close
to final resolution, but that the union
"had taken a licking" with regard to
its outcome.
