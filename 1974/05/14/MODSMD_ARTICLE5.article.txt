# Patients Support Doctor In Illicit Drug Controversy

Dr. Stewart M. Jones faces
disciplinary procedures including
possible loss of his license for
dispensing the controversial drug
Laetrile.
His patients are angry.
"We are being protected to the
point that we have no freedoms left at
all," said Si Collins of Palo Alto,
seated and holding crutches.
Jackie McCullough of Monterey
added, "We want the law changed so
we can have freedom of choice."
"Dr. Jones has an army behind
him," said Edwin Kelly, a tall thin

man with a cane.
Laetrile, synthesized in 1952 by
Ernest T. Krebs Jr., is a compound in
the nitriloside group of organic
compounds. The nitrilosides are
known collectively as vitamin B-17.
Cure?
Laetrile has a large number of
proponents who claim it often cures or
controls cancer, or at least eases the
pain and increases the well-being and
appetite of the patient. They believe
that cancer is a deficiency disease
aggravated by the lack of an essential
food compound in modern man's diet.
Derived from apricot pits, Laetrile
is considered a drug, not a vitamin, by
government agencies who claim it is
worthless. It is illegal in many states
including California.
Some 40,000 persons recently
signed a letter to President Nixon
demanding that the use of Laetrile be
legalized. Moreover it has been
estimated that 17,000 Americans have
traveled to Tijuana, Mexico to seek
treatment from Dr. Ernesto Contreras,
one of the drug's leading proponents.
Cancer Deaths
Cancer caused one fifth of the
deaths in the United States in 1971.
Collins and McCullough are victims of
the disease. Doctors told Collins two
years ago that he had only a few
months to live. McCullough, who had
an operation last year for cancer,
wants to take Laetrile as a preventive
measure. Keely has muscular
dystrophy. He thinks Laetrile may
help him retain his strength, which is
ebbing daily.
Laetrile is viewed by the
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW) as an unproven new
drug. An HEW report of Sept. 1973
claims that the supporters of Laetrile
have never presented acceptable
scientific evidence that the drug has
any anti-cancer effect.

According to the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), the drug has
been tested by the California Cancer
Commission and the National Cancer
Chemotherapy Research Program with
negative results.
The FDA's position is that unless
and until the claims of its sponsors can
be substantiated by well-controlled,
scientifically conducted preclinical
studies, it should not be administered
to humans under any circumstances.
In 1972 and 1973, Kanematsu
Sugiura of the Sloan-Kettering
Memorial Cancer Center in Manhattan

did preliminary experiments on mice
to test Laetrile and concluded that the
drug is worth further study.
Leak
According to an article in Science
last year these early positive results by
Sugiura were leaked to the media, to
the dismay of the conservative
institute. The article states that much
more was made of the information
than Sloan-Kettering intended.
Spokesmen for the institute said
that the experiments were preliminary
and "they were most certainly not
coming out in favor of Laetrile."

The article also revealed that an
attempt to reproduce Sugiura's
original results was unsuccessful for
unknown reasons.
Dr. Sherwood Lawrence, executive
director of the state Department of
Health's Advisory Council recently
said, "We are concerned because many
cancer victims have been induced to
seek treatment with Laetrile or other
unproven remedies instead of
conventional care.
Jones, a Stanford Medical School
graduate, however, says that Laetrile is
not only a cure, but a preventative of
cancer. In his pamphlet, "The Immoral
Banning of Vitamin B-17: How It
Came About and How It Is
Continuing," he claims that the FDA
has repeatedly ignored sound evidence
of the beneficial aspects of the drug.
Jones suggests that the American
Medical Association and the drug
industry do not want a cure for cancer
which would threaten a
"two-billion-[dollar] -a-year empire."
He administered the drug to
Josephine Bergman in Los Altos, a
terminal cancer patient at Stanford
Hospital in January but was ordered to
halt his treatment by hospital officials.

Both doctor and patient claimed she
was taking the drug as a diet
supplement rather than as a cure for
cancer.
Bergman and her husband took the
hospital to court seeking a temporary
restraining order which would force
the hospital to resume her treatments
with the drug. The suit failed in Santa
Clara County Superior Court last
month.
Her husband said this week, "There
is no doubt in our minds. When she
didn't take Laetrile she felt terrible
and lost weight. She is taking it again
and feels great. She's 99.4 percent
normal. We believe the cancer has been
arrested."
