# Medvedev: Individual Opposition
## Soviet Depicts Russian Dissent 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Dissent in the Soviet Union can be defined only in terms
of individual opposition to the government because
organized opposition is never tolerated, Zhores Medvedev,
Soviet gerontologist, told 750 people last night at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Consequently, forms of opposition to the Soviet regime
are almost as numerous as the dissidents, Medvedev said.
Medvedev, an expert on longevity, was sent to a mental
hospital by Soviet authorities when he criticized the
government and was deprived of citizenship during a 1973
visit to Great Britain.
Noting that workers and farmers seem uninterested in
dissent and that "students are very quiet," Medvedev called
Soviet dissent almost entirely a phenomenon peculiar to
well known intellectuals.
Only Himself
Medvedev stated that Alexander Solzhenitsyn represents
"only himself" in his opposition to the Soviet regime.
"Solzhenitsyn believes the only possibility for
restoration of moral principals is the restoration of the
power of the Orthodox Church," Medvedev said.
Solzhenitsyn believes in a totalitarian and isolationist
Russian state, he added.
In contrast, physicist Andrei Sakarov favors
democratization and westernization, Medvedev explained.

Medvedev's brother Roy who favors democratic
socialism, exemplifies another form of dissent, he said.
Creativity Stifled
Despite their differences, most Soviet dissidents agree
that the current government restrictions stifle the creativity
and development of the arts and sciences, Medvedev
explained.
By criticizing the government, dissidents hope to
eventually be able to organize their protests in order to
make Russia "a more relaxed nation and a more stable
nation for cooperation with other countries," he said.
Dissidents have become more visible in the last 15 to 20
years in Russia because the post-Stalinist regimes have been
more cautious about suppressing critics of the Russian
system, Medvedev commented.
'Slight Easing'
A "slight easing" of restrictions on expression occurred
during the Khrushchev years, Medvedev stated, but anyone
who persisted in criticizing the government was "very
quickly suppressed." He reminded the audience of the
government's silencing of author Boris Pasternak.
"Khrushchev was not a democrat," he said. "He was
intolerant to any real opposition."
But Medvedev credited Khrushchev with introducing
reforms that paved the way for what he called the
"embryonic" stage of Russian dissent today.
