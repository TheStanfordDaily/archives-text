(This article was written before
the USE strike began.)
This article is addressed to a)
Patricia Nash, so she knows she
won't be alone when she crosses
the picket lines and b)
all rational students and fellow
University employees.
There are approximately 1400
employees that are forced, by law,
to be represented by USE,
whether they voted for it or not.
About 600 of these people voted
for a strike against the University
and about 200 voted against a
strike. What about the rest of us
who number nearly 600? I won't
try to speak for them as a group
but only for myself as to why I
will be crossing picket lines on
Monday.
Three years ago, the University
and I made an agreement with
each other: they had a job that
they thought was worth a certain
wage, I had the talents to perform
the job and thought the wage to
be fair recompense for the task.
So they agreed to pay, I agreed to
perform. As my value to them
increased, they indicated
recognition by more pay.
Further, we both recognized
that if either of us ceased to
uphold our respective sides of the
agreement, it would be
terminated. This works both ways
equally: if I ceased to perform, I
would be fired and if they refused
to value my performance
monetarily, I would quit.
This analysis may seem
simplistic, but it is a means by
which I can show the only moral
way in which people can deal with

one another: voluntarily. If you
believe, as I do, that force must be
omitted from all human
intercourse, that freedom to deal
with one another (or not to deal
with one another) in a mutually
agreed-upon manner is the only
rational alternative for Man, then
you must further agree that the
only proper response for the
unhappy employee is voluntary
termination.
If the worth of the employee
to the employer cannot be
rationally agreed upon, he must
sell hte services elsewhere to the
highest bidder. To force the
employer to accept him on his
terms is the same as forcing him
to work for them, if he didn't
want to, and/or at a wage that
was unacceptable. This is the
central issue of this debate: not
who is going to get how much,
but rather whether or not anyone
has the right to demand anything
other than compliance with what
has already been agreed upon. It is
the answer to this question that
each of us gives that will direct all
of our actions.
The proponents of force will
logically be led to its ultimate
conclusion — physical force — and
those of us who try to work will
be the object of attemtped
physical restraint, perhaps even
harm. They will be met on my
part with equal determination
that I will cross their line, not for
the University or fellow "scabs"
or to "break their backs" but
simply in recogition of the
question, "By what right?"
