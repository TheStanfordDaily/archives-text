# Postwar Youth

Robert Cohn

The harsh realities of the Hitler
era and World War II catalyzed in
the minds of some of us who
returned from the nightmare what
we instinctively had known all
along: that for our future sons
and daughters, with or without
such a war, the vast probability
was that life would sooner or later
be comparably harsh, as it had
been again and again throughout
history.
And so when we came to raise
our children we tried to instill in
them the strength we thought
they would need to confront such
challenges, along with the even
stronger sense of being loved.
Accordingly, we were genuinely
worried, I remember well, when
men like Gesell and Spock
appeared on the postwar scene
with the new "permissive"
approach to child-raising.
Even if we maintained a certain
authenticity in our dealings with
our own children, the impact of a
differently nurtured peer-group
was not negligible, and as time
ticked on there gradually
accumulated a progressive
"sinking" feeling of slippage in
vital areas of psychic life.
During this period the
responsible voices focussing our
alarm, such as Bruno Bettelheim's,
were all too lonely; the usual
pattern was to drown the concern
in cocktails and wry laughter on
the part of wrinkling adults.
Challenge Avoided
But just recently, a number of
clinicians have started reporting
results too dire to ignore, in a
large proportion of postwar
youth: lacking an essential
firmness in their upbringing, at
crucial junctures of approaching
adulthood, too many of them
simply lack the resources to face a
steep challenge. Their pretexts
and justifications have, at least to
those clinicians, become
increasingly hollow. Spock
himself, as everybody knows, has
alluded to this problem in an at
least partial act of crow-eating.
If I may be pardoned a
personal reference, a kindred
concern caused me to write, in an

article which I circulated among
the faculty here in 1968, at the
height of the SES folly: "An
alarming number of students find
it harder to accept the challenge
of the 'fathers' ... we must be
aware of their deepest needs. Have
they ever needed our firmness,
our flamma tenax more?"
Naturally, the article met with
the usual snickers and mostly
devastating silence on the part of
the many who find such
utterances in dubious taste ■*-
Angst is unsociable — and there
were only three positive responses:
two were from military educators
here (ha ha) and one from a black
administrator who may just know
something about the meaner
aspects of existence.
Now, I didn't give a tinker's
damn about the snickers or the
silence — anyone who is working
for rewards beyond those of the
intellectual marketplace must get
inured to that sort of reaction —
but there is one thing I do care
about and that is the rising
generation (including my own
children) which that cool many is
helping, at least passively.
For example there are those
who tell us the Judeo-Christian
era is over, along with the
work-ethic that made this country
great (leaving us with a prospect
of endless moral inflation next to
which our economic inflation is
small potatoes). How the hell does
anyone know that? Because some
chic European intellectuals have
said so?
Now, God knows it is sick and
suffering but that can just as well
mean that a radical adjustment is
under way: deep growth always
occurs in this wise. Man goes
down to a near-zero point when
he procreates (cf. Hegel's
Philosophy of Nature), and so
does a culture.
Personally, I happen not to
belong to any sect, but like the
later Camus ("the anti-religious
attitude is vulgar") I have some
suspicions. .. And really all that is
needed here is a healthy sense of
smell.

with the new "permissive"
approach to child-raising.
Even if we maintained a certain
authenticity in our dealings with
our own children, the impact of a
differently nurtured peer-group
was not negligible, and as time
ticked on there gradually
accumulated a progressive
"sinking" feeling of slippage in
vital areas of psychic life.
During this period the
responsible voices focussing our
alarm, such as Bruno Bettelheim's,
were all too lonely; the usual
pattern was to drown the concern
in cocktails and wry laughter on
the part of wrinkling adults.

But just recently, a number of
clinicians have started reporting
results too dire to ignore, in a
large proportion of postwar
youth: lacking an essential
firmness in their upbringing, at
crucial junctures of approaching
adulthood, too many of them
simply lack the resources to face a
steep challenge. Their pretexts
and justifications have, at least to
those clinicians, become
increasingly hollow. Spock
himself, as everybody knows, has
alluded to this problem in an at
least partial act of crow-eating.
If I may be pardoned a
personal reference, a kindred
concern caused me to write, in an

article which I circulated among
the faculty here in 1968, at the
height of the SES folly: "An
alarming number of students find
it harder to accept the challenge
of the 'fathers' ... we must be
aware of their deepest needs. Have
they ever needed our firmness,
our flamma tenax more?"
Naturally, the article met with
the usual snickers and mostly
devastating silence on the part of
the many who find such
utterances in dubious taste ■*-
Angst is unsociable — and there
were only three positive responses:
two were from military educators
here (ha ha) and one from a black
administrator who may just know
something about the meaner
aspects of existence.
Now, I didn't give a tinker's
damn about the snickers or the
silence — anyone who is working
for rewards beyond those of the
intellectual marketplace must get
inured to that sort of reaction —
but there is one thing I do care
about and that is the rising
generation (including my own
children) which that cool many is
helping, at least passively.
For example there are those
who tell us the Judeo-Christian
era is over, along with the
work-ethic that made this country
great (leaving us with a prospect
of endless moral inflation next to
which our economic inflation is
small potatoes). How the hell does
anyone know that? Because some
chic European intellectuals have
said so?
Now, God knows it is sick and
suffering but that can just as well
mean that a radical adjustment is
under way: deep growth always
occurs in this wise. Man goes
down to a near-zero point when
he procreates (cf. Hegel's
Philosophy of Nature), and so
does a culture.
Personally, I happen not to
belong to any sect, but like the
later Camus ("the anti-religious
attitude is vulgar") I have some
suspicions. .. And really all that is
needed here is a healthy sense of
smell.

The harsh realities of the Hitler
era and World War II catalyzed in
the minds of some of us who
returned from the nightmare what
we instinctively had known all
along: that for our future sons
and daughters, with or without
such a war, the vast probability
was that life would sooner or later
be comparably harsh, as it had
been again and again throughout
history.
And so when we came to raise
our children we tried to instill in
them the strength we thought
they would need to confront such
challenges, along with the even
stronger sense of being loved.
Accordingly, we were genuinely
worried, I remember well, when
men like Gesell and Spock
appeared on the postwar scene
