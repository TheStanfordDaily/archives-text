# 50 More Workers Join USE Strike
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
University operations yesterday
continued virtually unchanged from
Monday, while approximately 50 more
University workers joined the day-old
strike by the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union.
According to the University
Operations Center, 950 workers —
excluding hospital employees — were
on strike yesterday, while picketing
v ctivity declined campus-wide.
The Medical Center remained
hardest-hit by the strike, though the
hospital has "solved" its linen
problem, according to Peter Carpenter,
vice president for medical affairs. No
linen deliveries have been made to the
hospital since Monday when linen
\>ruck drivers refused to crose USE
picket lines.
Linen Needs
"Presently Stanford Hospital
performs 60 to 70 operations per day,
including five to six procedures of
open heart surgery," said Hospital
)irector Paul Hofmann. "To support
this operating schedule, as well as
general linen needs, the hospital
requires approximately 17,000 pounds
of clean linen per day to maintain
sterile conditions and provide the
packs used in surgery, delivery rooms
and nurseries."
Carpenter said the hospital will use
more disposable linen, especially
surgical packs, and cut back on linen
use somewhat. Nurses have already
been instructed to use discretion in
changing bed linen.
He added that the hospital will
"ontinue to process some linen at El
Camino Hospital in Mountain View
and has arranged for other deliveries
with private contractors.
Hospital Pickets
Med Center spokesman Gary Cavalli

told the Daily that USE placed pickets
at one of those suppliers, Valley West
Hospital in Los Gatos. Cavalli said this
picketing was "a possible violation of
the law," but the University planned
no legal action.
Meanwhile groups of 12 pickets
detained University and other trucks
at the loading dock and Quarry Road
entrances to the Medical Center,
forcing trucks to push their way
through.
The pickets, who all said they were
Med Center employees, also attempted
to speak with passenger car drivers.
Palo Alto police patrolled the area
throughout the day in response to
citizen complaints.
Construction Halted
Construction on most University
projects, including the hospital
expansion, was halted again yesterday
when construction workers refused to
cross picket lines.
Only construction at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
resumed yesterday. SLAC Director
Wolfgang Panofsky said a separate
reserved gate for construction workers
was reopened and no USE pickets
appeared.
Work began early last night to
extend the cyclone fence marking the
boundary of the hospital construction
project and move the construction
workers' reserved gate clearly away
from picket lines. Carpenter said he
expected construction to resume
tomorrow.
Berk Disagrees
Berk disagreed. He explained that
the construction inspectors are "firmly
in our union" and that construction
workers will not work without the six
inspectors assigned to construction
projects on the University.
Berk also said that all custodians
employed by American Building
Maintenance to clean academic areas
and all printing trade workers will join
the strike Thursday.
These members of Service
Employees International (SEIU) local
810 have been allowed by USE to
cross picket lines to fulfill a
minimum-day clause in their contract
allowing them to collect medical
benefits, he said. USE is SEIU local
680, and SEIU has officially
sanctioned the strike.
An additional 350 students
collected rebates for their meal plans
yesterday, bringing the total to 1600
students, more than half of all who
purchase board plans, according to
Edward Scoles, director of housing
and food services. The total amount
rebated amounted to about $41,000,
he said.
The Wilbur and Stern food services
ran smoothly yesterday, even though
hours were reduced from yesterday.
Fewer students ate there yesterday
than Monday and food service
managers reported a "below normal"
volume overall.
Vice Provost Robert Rosenzweig,
speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, denied reports that the
University will reopen another kitchen
this week to accommodate Lagunita,
Roble and Florence Moore residents
who must now cross campus to eat
University food.
Scoles explained there are no
immediate plans to open another food
service, but added there is "definitely
a possibility that the matter might be
considered, but not before next week.
"It would take a fairly substantial

return of workers," he said, and only
about 24 of the 64 food service
workers reported in yesterday. Food
service managers said about half of the
student hashers were absent yesterday.
Other University operations —
University Stores, Tresidder Union,
Plant Services, the steam plant and the
laboratories continued smoothly. The
only trouble reported occurred
yesterday morning at the Computation
Center, when USE pickets allegedly
blocked an IBM service representative
from entering the building.
Computation Center Operations
Manager Peter Vesanovic said pickets
were blocking the entrance until a
private security guard arrived.
'Verbal Violence'
Vesanovic added there was "no
physical violence, but there was verbal
violence." The pickets "verbally
threatened" customer engineers and
other strike-exempt employees, he
charged.
Pickets at the center and a USE
representative denied that they
obstructed the entrance, saying they
only approached each person and
asked him not to enter.
On the negotiating front, Berk
charged that "management has
delayed the negotiations until
Thursday." He said that Emerson
Street, executive secretary of the
Santa Clara County Labor Council,
called University negotiator Douglas
Barton three times yesterday and
Barton said he couldn't negotiate until
Thursday.

students, more than half of all who
purchase board plans, according to
Edward Scoles, director of housing
and food services. The total amount
rebated amounted to about $41,000,
he said.
The Wilbur and Stern food services
ran smoothly yesterday, even though
hours were reduced from yesterday.
Fewer students ate there yesterday
than Monday and food service
managers reported a "below normal"
volume overall.
Vice Provost Robert Rosenzweig,
speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, denied reports that the
University will reopen another kitchen
this week to accommodate Lagunita,
Roble and Florence Moore residents
who must now cross campus to eat
University food.
Scoles explained there are no
immediate plans to open another food
service, but added there is "definitely
a possibility that the matter might be
considered, but not before next week.
"It would take a fairly substantial

return of workers," he said, and only
about 24 of the 64 food service
workers reported in yesterday. Food
service managers said about half of the
student hashers were absent yesterday.
Other University operations —
University Stores, Tresidder Union,
Plant Services, the steam plant and the
laboratories continued smoothly. The
only trouble reported occurred
yesterday morning at the Computation
Center, when USE pickets allegedly
blocked an IBM service representative
from entering the building.
Computation Center Operations
Manager Peter Vesanovic said pickets
were blocking the entrance until a
private security guard arrived.
'Verbal Violence'
Vesanovic added there was "no
physical violence, but there was verbal
violence." The pickets "verbally
threatened" customer engineers and
other strike-exempt employees, he
charged.
Pickets at the center and a USE
representative denied that they
obstructed the entrance, saying they
only approached each person and
asked him not to enter.
On the negotiating front, Berk
charged that "management has
delayed the negotiations until
Thursday." He said that Emerson
Street, executive secretary of the
Santa Clara County Labor Council,
called University negotiator Douglas
Barton three times yesterday and
Barton said he couldn't negotiate until
Thursday.
Other reporters who contributed to
this story were Nanci Colvert, Don

University operations yesterday
continued virtually unchanged from
Monday, while approximately 50 more
University workers joined the day-old
strike by the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union.
According to the University
Operations Center, 950 workers —
excluding hospital employees — were
on strike yesterday, while picketing
v ctivity declined campus-wide.
The Medical Center remained
hardest-hit by the strike, though the
hospital has "solved" its linen
problem, according to Peter Carpenter,
vice president for medical affairs. No
linen deliveries have been made to the
hospital since Monday when linen
\>ruck drivers refused to crose USE
picket lines.
Linen Needs
"Presently Stanford Hospital
performs 60 to 70 operations per day,
including five to six procedures of
open heart surgery," said Hospital
)irector Paul Hofmann. "To support
this operating schedule, as well as
general linen needs, the hospital
requires approximately 17,000 pounds
of clean linen per day to maintain
sterile conditions and provide the
packs used in surgery, delivery rooms
and nurseries."
Carpenter said the hospital will use
more disposable linen, especially
surgical packs, and cut back on linen
use somewhat. Nurses have already
been instructed to use discretion in
changing bed linen.
He added that the hospital will
"ontinue to process some linen at El
Camino Hospital in Mountain View
and has arranged for other deliveries
with private contractors.
Hospital Pickets
Med Center spokesman Gary Cavalli

told the Daily that USE placed pickets
at one of those suppliers, Valley West
Hospital in Los Gatos. Cavalli said this
picketing was "a possible violation of
the law," but the University planned
no legal action.
Meanwhile groups of 12 pickets
detained University and other trucks
at the loading dock and Quarry Road
entrances to the Medical Center,
forcing trucks to push their way
through.
The pickets, who all said they were
Med Center employees, also attempted
to speak with passenger car drivers.
Palo Alto police patrolled the area
throughout the day in response to
citizen complaints.
Construction Halted
Construction on most University
projects, including the hospital
expansion, was halted again yesterday
when construction workers refused to
cross picket lines.
Only construction at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
resumed yesterday. SLAC Director
Wolfgang Panofsky said a separate
reserved gate for construction workers
was reopened and no USE pickets
appeared.
Work began early last night to
extend the cyclone fence marking the
boundary of the hospital construction
project and move the construction
workers' reserved gate clearly away
from picket lines. Carpenter said he
expected construction to resume
tomorrow.
Berk Disagrees
Berk disagreed. He explained that
the construction inspectors are "firmly
in our union" and that construction
workers will not work without the six
inspectors assigned to construction
projects on the University.
Berk also said that all custodians
employed by American Building
Maintenance to clean academic areas
and all printing trade workers will join
the strike Thursday.
These members of Service
Employees International (SEIU) local
810 have been allowed by USE to
cross picket lines to fulfill a
minimum-day clause in their contract
allowing them to collect medical
benefits, he said. USE is SEIU local
680, and SEIU has officially
sanctioned the strike.
An additional 350 students
collected rebates for their meal plans
yesterday, bringing the total to 1600

use somewhat. Nurses have already
been instructed to use discretion in
changing bed linen.
He added that the hospital will
"ontinue to process some linen at El
Camino Hospital in Mountain View
and has arranged for other deliveries
with private contractors.
Hospital Pickets
Med Center spokesman Gary Cavalli

told the Daily that USE placed pickets
at one of those suppliers, Valley West
Hospital in Los Gatos. Cavalli said this
picketing was "a possible violation of
the law," but the University planned
no legal action.
Meanwhile groups of 12 pickets
detained University and other trucks
at the loading dock and Quarry Road
entrances to the Medical Center,
forcing trucks to push their way
through.
The pickets, who all said they were
Med Center employees, also attempted
to speak with passenger car drivers.
Palo Alto police patrolled the area
throughout the day in response to
citizen complaints.
Construction Halted
Construction on most University
projects, including the hospital
expansion, was halted again yesterday
when construction workers refused to
cross picket lines.
Only construction at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
resumed yesterday. SLAC Director
Wolfgang Panofsky said a separate
reserved gate for construction workers
was reopened and no USE pickets
appeared.
Work began early last night to
extend the cyclone fence marking the
boundary of the hospital construction
project and move the construction
workers' reserved gate clearly away
from picket lines. Carpenter said he
expected construction to resume
tomorrow.
Berk Disagrees
Berk disagreed. He explained that
the construction inspectors are "firmly
in our union" and that construction
workers will not work without the six
inspectors assigned to construction
projects on the University.
Berk also said that all custodians
employed by American Building
Maintenance to clean academic areas
and all printing trade workers will join
the strike Thursday.
These members of Service
Employees International (SEIU) local
810 have been allowed by USE to
cross picket lines to fulfill a
minimum-day clause in their contract
allowing them to collect medical
benefits, he said. USE is SEIU local
680, and SEIU has officially
sanctioned the strike.
An additional 350 students
collected rebates for their meal plans
yesterday, bringing the total to 1600
students, more than half of all who
purchase board plans, according to
Edward Scoles, director of housing
and food services. The total amount
rebated amounted to about $41,000,
he said.
The Wilbur and Stern food services
ran smoothly yesterday, even though
hours were reduced from yesterday.
Fewer students ate there yesterday
than Monday and food service
managers reported a "below normal"
volume overall.
Vice Provost Robert Rosenzweig,
speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, denied reports that the
University will reopen another kitchen
this week to accommodate Lagunita,
Roble and Florence Moore residents
who must now cross campus to eat
University food.
Scoles explained there are no
immediate plans to open another food
service, but added there is "definitely
a possibility that the matter might be
considered, but not before next week.
"It would take a fairly substantial

return of workers," he said, and only
about 24 of the 64 food service
workers reported in yesterday. Food
service managers said about half of the
student hashers were absent yesterday.
Other University operations —
University Stores, Tresidder Union,
Plant Services, the steam plant and the
laboratories continued smoothly. The
only trouble reported occurred
yesterday morning at the Computation
Center, when USE pickets allegedly
blocked an IBM service representative
from entering the building.
Computation Center Operations
Manager Peter Vesanovic said pickets
were blocking the entrance until a
private security guard arrived.
'Verbal Violence'
Vesanovic added there was "no
physical violence, but there was verbal
violence." The pickets "verbally
threatened" customer engineers and
other strike-exempt employees, he
charged.
Pickets at the center and a USE
representative denied that they
obstructed the entrance, saying they
only approached each person and
asked him not to enter.
On the negotiating front, Berk
charged that "management has
delayed the negotiations until
Thursday." He said that Emerson
Street, executive secretary of the
Santa Clara County Labor Council,
called University negotiator Douglas
Barton three times yesterday and
Barton said he couldn't negotiate until
Thursday.
Other reporters who contributed to
this story were Nanci Colvert, Don
Cox, Bruce Kadden, Viae Kershner,

University operations yesterday
continued virtually unchanged from
Monday, while approximately 50 more
University workers joined the day-old
strike by the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union.
According to the University
Operations Center, 950 workers —
excluding hospital employees — were
on strike yesterday, while picketing
v ctivity declined campus-wide.
The Medical Center remained
hardest-hit by the strike, though the
hospital has "solved" its linen
problem, according to Peter Carpenter,
vice president for medical affairs. No
linen deliveries have been made to the
hospital since Monday when linen
\>ruck drivers refused to crose USE
picket lines.
Linen Needs
"Presently Stanford Hospital
performs 60 to 70 operations per day,
including five to six procedures of
open heart surgery," said Hospital
)irector Paul Hofmann. "To support
this operating schedule, as well as
general linen needs, the hospital
requires approximately 17,000 pounds
of clean linen per day to maintain
sterile conditions and provide the
packs used in surgery, delivery rooms
and nurseries."
Carpenter said the hospital will use
more disposable linen, especially
surgical packs, and cut back on linen
use somewhat. Nurses have already
been instructed to use discretion in
changing bed linen.
He added that the hospital will
"ontinue to process some linen at El
Camino Hospital in Mountain View
