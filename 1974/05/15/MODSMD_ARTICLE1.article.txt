# 50 More Workers Join USE Strike
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
University operations yesterday
continued virtually unchanged from
Monday, while approximately 50 more
University workers joined the day-old
strike by the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union.
According to the University
Operations Center, 950 workers —
excluding hospital employees — were
on strike yesterday, while picketing
v ctivity declined campus-wide.
The Medical Center remained
hardest-hit by the strike, though the
hospital has "solved" its linen
problem, according to Peter Carpenter,
vice president for medical affairs. No
linen deliveries have been made to the
hospital since Monday when linen
\>ruck drivers refused to crose USE
picket lines.
Linen Needs
"Presently Stanford Hospital
performs 60 to 70 operations per day,
including five to six procedures of
open heart surgery," said Hospital
)irector Paul Hofmann. "To support
this operating schedule, as well as
general linen needs, the hospital
requires approximately 17,000 pounds
of clean linen per day to maintain
sterile conditions and provide the
packs used in surgery, delivery rooms
and nurseries."
Carpenter said the hospital will use
more disposable linen, especially
surgical packs, and cut back on linen
use somewhat. Nurses have already
been instructed to use discretion in
changing bed linen.
He added that the hospital will
"ontinue to process some linen at El
Camino Hospital in Mountain View
and has arranged for other deliveries
with private contractors.
Hospital Pickets
Med Center spokesman Gary Cavalli

told the Daily that USE placed pickets
at one of those suppliers, Valley West
Hospital in Los Gatos. Cavalli said this
picketing was "a possible violation of
the law," but the University planned
no legal action.
Meanwhile groups of 12 pickets
detained University and other trucks
at the loading dock and Quarry Road
entrances to the Medical Center,
forcing trucks to push their way
through.
The pickets, who all said they were
Med Center employees, also attempted
to speak with passenger car drivers.
Palo Alto police patrolled the area
throughout the day in response to
citizen complaints.
Construction Halted
Construction on most University
projects, including the hospital
expansion, was halted again yesterday
when construction workers refused to
cross picket lines.
Only construction at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
resumed yesterday. SLAC Director
Wolfgang Panofsky said a separate
reserved gate for construction workers
was reopened and no USE pickets
appeared.
Work began early last night to
extend the cyclone fence marking the
boundary of the hospital construction
project and move the construction
workers' reserved gate clearly away
from picket lines. Carpenter said he
expected construction to resume
tomorrow.
Berk Disagrees
Berk disagreed. He explained that
the construction inspectors are "firmly
in our union" and that construction
workers will not work without the six
inspectors assigned to construction
projects on the University.
