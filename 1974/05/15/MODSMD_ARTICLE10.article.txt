# Federal Work On Prolonging Life

Writes a constituent: "I see we have a
Commission on Aging. What we really need is
a Commission on How To Prevent It."
I'm sure those sentiments find a ready
echo in many minds. But, for the
information of those who may not know it,
let me say the federal government is doing
quite a bit of research and subsidizing private
researchers in how to prolong human life and
in how to slow down the aging process.
Nor is the work on prolonging youth and
middle age aimed at mere cosmetic
techniques such as plastic surgery and hair
transplants — important as that may be to
some. What is sought is a better
understanding of why we age.
What biochemical process causes our
regeneration of cells and repair of vital organs
to become less and less effective as time goes
on? We know a lot about what causes the
various fatal diseases, and quite a few that are
nonfatal. But what about the supposed
"wearing out" of the body?
Fast-Paced Life
One theory is that we "live too fast." Our
body temperatures are too high and the
processes of burning up the food intake
produces too many waste products that have
to be carried away from the cells and put
through the kidneys, liver, and skin to get rid

of them. It is thought that slowing down our
metabolism will help us to live longer.
Recently a drug was discovered which
gives experimenters hope that it may be used
on human beings to do just that. From their
animal experiments, they see a possibility of
keeping people alive for as much as 200 years
— an almost Old Testament age.
Another set of experimenters has been
trying to see if there isn't some chemical
"villain" that causes us to age. They think
they may have unmasked just such a villain in
the form of a proten — amyloid — which is
present in aged individuals virtually
throughout the animal kingdom. This
research is carried out under the auspices of
the American Aging Association, a private
scientific group. In Ecuador, Kashmir, and
Russia research by Dr. Alexander Leaf of
Harvard found this protein prevalent among
the very old.
Dr. Edgar Cathcart of Boston University
says it is found in aged horses, dogs, cats and
rodents. Human autopsies and other studies
show it as a large factor in producing senility.
And often in turns relatively mild diseases
into killers.
You may have thought our life
expectancies were already being steadily
extended. This was true for almost 150 years
— then in 1955, when the expectancy

reached 70 years, it seemed "the needle got
stuck." Today the life expectancy remains at
"three score and 10."
Population Predictions
If the researchers are successful, if a large
majority of our people start living to be 100
or 150 years old — what will the effect be on
our life style? First of all, if the birth rate
remains the same, obviously the ills we have
foreseen in the population explosion will be
hastened. Overcrowding will lead to
competition for space and goods, gnd unless
we produce more in a hurry, prices will soar.
Inflation.
This will mean that those on fixed
incomes will suffer most. Social Security now
has a cost-of-living clause, but the working of
this escalator is bound to lag far behind the
actual costs. Worse still, the system was never
devised to pay benefits to a massive
population from age 65 to 150. Eighty-five
years of retirement benefits?
Our entire concept of retirement will have
to be rejiggered if expectancies reach that
point. Instead of earlier and earlier
retirement ages, we will have to think of
delaying benefits to higher and higher ages.
Otherwise, the weight of Social Security
taxes will sink the economy.
