# On Misinformation And The Strike

I never thought I'd take up my
pen again, but Sunday night was
the kick in the ass I needed. I
went to see MASH at the ASSU
Sunday flicks, and found this
school full of children who don't
let much stand in their way of
immediate gratification.
For those who weren't there,
the script is simple. Enter one
USE supporter to give a short
mellow speech on why the Union
is striking and why they have
decided to let the Flicks continue.
Listen to the 60 percent
uninformed students laugh, boo
and hiss and finally cheer when
the movie comes on. At that time
I felt a little sick and wondered
why not take away their movies.
(I suppose he would have been
lynched if he told them that.)
The point is not that in any
labor debate both sides have valid
grievances. The workers at
Stanford are poorly paid, have a
laughable pension plan and

absolutely no job security at the
moment. The University is not a
money making corporation and
like most private institutions in
the country, is hurting for funds.
Individuals Revert
What is frightening is the slimy
reversion of intelligent individuals
to uncaring, unresponsive and
offensive kids. (Viva Lord of The
Flies.)
I was especially offended with
Tim Ferguson's hard, biting
column in the May 13 Daily.
Facts being facts, remember
that little $50 billion a year,
50,000 Americans dead conflict
we had in Southeast Asia. Or a
few college students being shot to
death at Jackson and Kent State.
But of course you were only 14 at
the time and perhaps your
mommy told you those nasty
college students were making
trouble again.
Radicalism Unconnected
And what the hell does SDS or

left wing radicalism have to do
with underpaid workers asking for
more money? Talk to some of the
technicians or dishwashers or lab
assistants and you'll find few
interested in overthrowing the
United States or the "evisceration
of the University."
They work here, most of them
enjoy working here. It seems most
of the power laden rhetoric going
down is strictly students for or
against the strike to gratify their
politically reflexive egos.
One more point, Ferguson.
The majority of unions in this
country have a union shop which
means you don't work unless you
belong to the union. An agency
shop is a compromise and if you
will kindly point out how it is
antithetical to my freedom
because" the lab tech is paying
union dues, I will eat a bucket of
sand.
All of which does not deny
that some students, especially

those in the dorms, are getting a
raw deal. No food, no custodial
service and perhaps no hot water
make a bad combination. The
stopping of deliveries to Stanford
hospital is a questionable decision.
Let us hope the strike is short.
Those of you who have had to
scrape together money to attend
here should understand about
rising costs for food, rent,
clothing, etc., and have sympathy
for the striking workers. I'm just
waiting for some undergraduate to
complain about his beer (or dope)
money being wiped out by a
tuition raise. I'll put sugar in his
tank.
