# Why Area Requirements?

Sfeve Wurzburg

As a Stanford student I question the positions
that some of the recent letters have taken vis a vis
the distribution requirement. So far the discussion
has centered upon what criteria should be
employed to decide which offerings of various
departments should satisfy the requirement.
As such this discussion totally sidesteps the issue
I consider basic: that is the existence of such a
requirement in the first place.
I never understood the reasoning behind such
mandatory structures. All they accomplish is to
place arbitrary limits on the academic freedom that
a student has. It is merely a case of some people
enforcing their views on others. Majority rule.
But remember that the majority does not
necessarily rule by right, only by might. There are
some people for whom such requirements are an
encumbrance. The classes just cover subjects that
these people aren't interested in. These are classes

that they attend, but from which they do not learn.
This can only serve as a waste of time.
If there is the general feeling that entering
freshmen are indeed lost then perhaps the current
advising system ought to be carefully examined.
Perhaps a system similar to that of the School of
Engineering should be instituted.
In any case I feel that the examination of each
individual case by a qualified adviser is far superior
to the current "cattle treatment" students are
presently subjected to. The most extreme position
that I could justify would be the issuing of a few
sets of guidelines setting forth different people's
conceptualizations of a Stanford Education. Such a
booklet, an excellent one at that, entitled A
Stanford Education, has already been issued. What
is the need to go further?
