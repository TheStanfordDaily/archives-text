# Support USE's Strike

I am an undergraduate
pre-medical student deeply
involved in getting good grades;
my parents also dole out over
three grand a year for my
education, and yet I welcome the
strike of the workers at Stanford.
I do not see it as a threat to
me, but as an attempt to fulfill
their basic needs and make their
place of work more liveable. They
are using their only weapon, the
strike, against a University that
has at its disposal millions of
dollars, an entourage of legal help
(lawyers as well as judges) and an
army of police.
Another potential weapon at
Stanford is the student body, and
I say we clearly go onto the side
of the workers. It is not the
University that is being
exploited!
Some people voice concern
that the union (sic) is not
demanding that tuition does not
increase with wages. First, when
was the last time the students
demanded higher pay for
workers? Second, I say right on to
any people that begin to organize
a movement to demand that the
University doesn't raise tuitions
any higher. This would be a good
demand for students to raise while
supporting the strike.
Few Voices
The fact is there have been little
or no vocies ever raised against
tuition hikes and consequently
the cost rises perennially. Where
were these concerned students
when the Unviersity spent
hundreds of thousands of dollars
to prosecute Bruce Franklin, or
when they recently spent over
$50,000 to bust up the TA union
organizing, or when they raised
faculty salaries over $1000 a shot
a few years back?
Most workers haven't had
significant pay increases since
1972 throughout all the inflation.
People can not justly ask the
workers here to accept low wages,
be denied fair grievance
procedures or accept a miniscule
pension and medical plan, in order
that we the students have our lives
run smoothly. It is twisted logiÂ«
that concludes that because wji
have to clean up after ourselvdS
due to the strike, that we oppose
the workers.
Oppose Administration
It is just as easy to conclude
that we should oppose the
administration that is causing the
workers to have to go on strike.
Workers have their well beings to
fight for and the more we support
them, the sooner this strike will
end with justice for all.
The cost-push inflation
argument, also advanced in the
Daily, is just a ruse, concocted by
big business, to get people to
support exploiting working
people. In reality corporations
charge prices they can get away
with and similarly they pay wages
they can get away with.
It is a rare corporation, and
Stanford is not one, that will pay
fair wages to the detriment of
their profit margins unless they
are forced to do so. That is the
way the game in this society is
played.
Check out the workers'
demands, and try to look beyond
the empirical view of how this
immediately affects yourselves.
Finally, support the just case of
USE, help with picketing, inform
others (in classes, too), don't cross
picket lines, and demand that the
University accede to the workers
demands!
