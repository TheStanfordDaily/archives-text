What is the status of the Stanford University Bookstore? Are they
accorded special privileges by the University? 1s it non-profit? Does a
private corporation manage it? Who authorizes them to allow
companies to sell their products on special exhibits? J.H.
A quote from "Over 75 Years of Service to Stanford University," a
pamphlet that briefly describes the history and services of the
Bookstore:
'The Stanford Bookstore is a non-profit association that was
founded on March 18,1897. ...
'Today, there are more than 30 members in the association,
including students and staff as well as faculty. They set the policies of
the store.
"Members of the association give their services as volunteers. They
receive no remuneration nor is there 'profit-sharing' since the store is
a non-profit corporation.
'The Stanford Bookstore is, effectively, as it has been over the
years, a self-supporting independent corporation. It does not have a
formal, legal relationship with Stanford. Its relationship is
professional, and traditionally, close and congenial."
Eldon Speed, general manager of the Bookstore, added some
comments. Although the store does not make a profit, an excess of
income is being generated to pay for expansion of the Bookstore.
(Any expansion or renovation of the Bookstore must be paid out of
store revenues.)
Speed also said that he and the lawyer make decisions about special
exhibits.
And,"I don't know of any special privileges [given to the
Bookstore by the University]," laughed Speed.

What is the exact legal circumstance when a minor is apprehended
drinking in a bar or nightclub in California without a fake ID? With a
fake ID? How about carrying liquor (unopened) in a car? B.H.
It is a misdemeanor for a minor to drink in a bar or nightclub. The
penalty is a minimum fine of $100.
Using a fake ID is also a misdemeanor, with the same penalty.
It is against the law for a minor to be in possession of liquor on any
public street or highway, or in any public place.

Why is the vanishing of the Reimann-Christoffel tensor a necessary
and sufficient condition for the existence of flat space-time? Did I
spell them right? S.B.

Yes.
