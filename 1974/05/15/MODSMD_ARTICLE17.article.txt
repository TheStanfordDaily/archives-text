# June 4 Ballot Discussed
## City Council Endorses Propositions 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Palo Alto City Council Monday night
considered five of nine propositions to run
on the June 4 Primary election ballot and
voted to support all but Proposition 9.
The Council extended consideration of
that controversial proposition, which would
require disclosure and limitation of
expenditures for statewide political
candidates and measures, to its next meeting,
when absent Councilman Byron Sher will be
present to conceivably provide the necessary
fifth vote to endorse the proposition.
Monday night Proposition 9 summoned
four votes — one short of the five needed for
endorsement — with Councilmen Roy Clay,
Stanley Norton and John Berwald abstaining.
Propositions 1, 2, 5 and 6 won the support of
the council with five votes and Berwald and
Clay, again, abstained.
Those abstaining maintained the
propositions — independent of their

individual merits — were none of the
council's business. Clay justified his
abstention after the council briefly discussed
and voted on the propositions.
"If we are going to get involved with
this," Clay said, "we should extend the
debate to treat the matter fairly." And he
emphasized, "Extending the debate is not a
good use of the council's time."
Berwald elaborated, "If non-municipal
matters are before the people of California
and they will be voted upon by the people,
the City Council, in passing on them, goes
beyond its purpose." Clay pointed out,
'These issues have no direct effect upon the
city."
Councilman Alan Henderson, on the other
hand, declared that Proposition 2, the Clean
Water Bond Act, would have a demonstrable
effect upon Palo Alto by reducing one-half of
its share of the total $65 million expenses
facing its parent organization, the South Bay

Dischargers Authority, a group of
Mid-peninsula counties and cities jointly
disposing of waste.
Palo Alto's part of the total bill is roughly
$12 million. The city would benefit by
Proposition 2, which allocates $250 million
state funds to help cities pay about 12
percent of their sewage disposal costs.
Presently the federal government subsidizes
75 percent.
Proposition 1, which the council also
endorsed, allocates $160 million to create
more parks and beaches and would aid Palo
Alto's proposed expansion of its recreational
facilities, Henderson pointed out.
In supporting Proposition 5, to permit the
use of state-imposed highway users tax
revenues for mass transit as well as highway
purposes, the council directed the city staff
to study county Measure A, which allows
funds derived from Proposition 5 to be used
locally.

its share of the total $65 million expenses
facing its parent organization, the South Bay

Dischargers Authority, a group of
Mid-peninsula counties and cities jointly
disposing of waste.
Palo Alto's part of the total bill is roughly
$12 million. The city would benefit by
Proposition 2, which allocates $250 million
state funds to help cities pay about 12
percent of their sewage disposal costs.
Presently the federal government subsidizes
75 percent.
Proposition 1, which the council also
endorsed, allocates $160 million to create
more parks and beaches and would aid Palo
Alto's proposed expansion of its recreational
facilities, Henderson pointed out.
In supporting Proposition 5, to permit the
use of state-imposed highway users tax
revenues for mass transit as well as highway
purposes, the council directed the city staff
to study county Measure A, which allows
funds derived from Proposition 5 to be used
locally.
Palo Alto City Council Monday night
considered five of nine propositions to run
on the June 4 Primary election ballot and
voted to support all but Proposition 9.
The Council extended consideration of
that controversial proposition, which would
require disclosure and limitation of
expenditures for statewide political
candidates and measures, to its next meeting,
when absent Councilman Byron Sher will be
present to conceivably provide the necessary
fifth vote to endorse the proposition.
Monday night Proposition 9 summoned
four votes — one short of the five needed for
endorsement — with Councilmen Roy Clay,
Stanley Norton and John Berwald abstaining.
Propositions 1, 2, 5 and 6 won the support of
the council with five votes and Berwald and
Clay, again, abstained.
Those abstaining maintained the
propositions — independent of their

individual merits — were none of the
council's business. Clay justified his
abstention after the council briefly discussed
and voted on the propositions.
"If we are going to get involved with
this," Clay said, "we should extend the
debate to treat the matter fairly." And he
emphasized, "Extending the debate is not a
good use of the council's time."
Berwald elaborated, "If non-municipal
matters are before the people of California
and they will be voted upon by the people,
the City Council, in passing on them, goes
beyond its purpose." Clay pointed out,
'These issues have no direct effect upon the
city."
Councilman Alan Henderson, on the other
hand, declared that Proposition 2, the Clean
Water Bond Act, would have a demonstrable
effect upon Palo Alto by reducing one-half of
its share of the total $65 million expenses
facing its parent organization, the South Bay

Dischargers Authority, a group of
Mid-peninsula counties and cities jointly
disposing of waste.
