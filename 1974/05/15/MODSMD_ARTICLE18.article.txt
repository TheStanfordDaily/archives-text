# 'Cap And Gown' Lunch Speakers Advise Women To Take Initiative
## 
### 
"Take your cookies when they're passed," was
the advice of both Dr. Rita Campbell and Mary Lou
Zoglin, speakers at the annual Cap and Gown
Luncheon held May 11 at Tresidder Union.
The phrase (i.e. take advantage of an
opportunity when it is there) was borrowed from
Cap and Gown alumnae Jean Coblentz and was
used in connection with the theme "Expectations
of Leadership."
Campbell, currently a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institute, cautioned women leaders to
"take the power that is yours; don't let the male
members of a group take over your authority."
She is not optimistic about women's progress
towards leadership positions in society. "We cannot
through legal means change a social and cultural
pattern implanted in the male (that power belongs
to the male, not female)."
Citing a recent Fortune magazine article,
Campbell noted that there are only 11 women
among the country's 6,000 top level business
leaders — defined as the three top paid officers in
the 1,000 largest firms, or a director earning more

than $35,000.
She amused the actives and alums of the senior
women's honor society when she related a story
involving her and her husband who also received his
doctorate in economics from Harvard. She was the
first one to receive the degree, however, and
Harvard students who sent them telegrams of
congratulations during their honeymoon
humorously addressed them to Dr. and Mr.
Campbell.
Zoglin, recently named to the Board of
Governors of California Community Colleges, has
been a trustee of the Foothill Community College
district since 1961. She cited self confidence and
impatience as two important characteristics of
leaders.
'There are certain things I cannot tolerate —
waste, injustice, stupidity. Therefore, I have to do
something about them. If your ideas are sound, thus
automatically puts you into a leadership position
over those who may believe the same things but
don't care as much and are not so vocal about
them."
