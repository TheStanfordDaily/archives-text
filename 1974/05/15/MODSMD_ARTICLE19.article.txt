# Sandy Mayer Quits Net Team
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Alex "Sandy" Mayer,
Stanford's unpredictable tennis
star, quit the team yesterday.
Mayer, a senior from Wayne,
N.J., is the top-ranked amateur
player in the U.S. and the
defending NCAA singles and
v, oubles champion. He had been
expected to lead the Cardinals to
a second straight NCAA team
championship this June.
Mayer, contacted by the Daily
last night, said "At this point I'm
really down. I have a lot of things
on my mind. I'll talk to you when
v'm ready." He indicated he
would continue to attend school
here until his graduation in June.
Coach Dick Gould said Mayer
explained it wasn't fun anymore.
Gould would say only that "he's
done a lot for me, a lot for the
v eam, a lot for the school. As far
as I'm concerned, we're still good
friends and will continue to be."
Mayer reportedly has been
pondering his future since the Ojai
tournament in April. Mayer
dropped out of Ojai prior to the
semifinals.
The loss of Mayer is
particularly crippling since the
Pacific Eight conference
tournament begins tomorrow in
Seattle, and since Pat DuPre will
not play in the Pac-B's due to an
injured wrist.
"The big question is doubles,"
Gould said. With Stanford's top
two teams, Mayer-Jim Delaney
and John Whitlinger-DuPre out
of action, things have changed.
Delaney-Whitlinger have been
hurriedly paired to play first
doubles, with Mark Mitchell-Nick
Saviano and Chico Hagey-Gene
Mayer at second and third.
The singles lineup is headed by
Delaney, a junior. He will be
followed by Whitlinger, Hagey, G.
Mayer, Saviano and Mitchell in
that order.
Hagey, a junior who was
All-American as a freshman,
received his dramatic promotion
after reaching the finals of the
California State Championships
last weekend. He did not even
play in the top six during the dual
matches here last month.
Adding to Gould's worries is
the fact that Stanford has been
victimized by a change in Pac-8
draw rules. Washington coach
Steve Hopps arranged the matches
so that the winner of the match
between the numbers one and
eight teams (Stanford and
Washington State) would play the
winners of the matches between

the three and six teams (USC and
Oregon State) in the semifinals.
This means, in effect, that
Stanford and USC, after disposing
of their Northern foes
tomorrow, will play each other
in the semifinals Friday.
Second-ranked UCLA will thus
get a comparatively easy route to
the finals, playing the winner of
the Washington-California match
after an easy match against
Oregon tomorrow.
In previous years, the number
one ranked team (determined by
dual match records) faced the
winner of the match between the
four and five teams in the semis.
In a league such as the Pac-8,
where three teams outshine the
rest, this change is a major blow
to numbers one and three,
Stanford and USC.
Last season, Stanford, seeded
second because of dual results,
had to play the third team,
UCLA, in the semifinals. The
Cards lost to UCLA, 5-4. The
Bruins, led by Bob Kreiss, went
on to beat top-seeded USC for the
championship.

Washington State) would play the
winners of the matches between

the three and six teams (USC and
Oregon State) in the semifinals.
This means, in effect, that
Stanford and USC, after disposing
of their Northern foes
tomorrow, will play each other
in the semifinals Friday.
Second-ranked UCLA will thus
get a comparatively easy route to
the finals, playing the winner of
the Washington-California match
after an easy match against
Oregon tomorrow.
In previous years, the number
one ranked team (determined by
dual match records) faced the
winner of the match between the
four and five teams in the semis.
In a league such as the Pac-8,
where three teams outshine the
rest, this change is a major blow
to numbers one and three,
Stanford and USC.
Last season, Stanford, seeded
second because of dual results,
had to play the third team,
UCLA, in the semifinals. The
Cards lost to UCLA, 5-4. The
Bruins, led by Bob Kreiss, went
on to beat top-seeded USC for the
championship.

MAYER QUITS — Alex "Sandy" Mayer, Stanford's top tennis player,
quit the team yesterday. Mayer is the top-ranked amateur in the U.S.,
and defeated one of the world's best players, Ilie Nastase, en route to
reaching the Wimbledon semifinals last year.
Alex "Sandy" Mayer,
Stanford's unpredictable tennis
star, quit the team yesterday.
Mayer, a senior from Wayne,
N.J., is the top-ranked amateur
player in the U.S. and the
defending NCAA singles and
v, oubles champion. He had been
expected to lead the Cardinals to
a second straight NCAA team
championship this June.
Mayer, contacted by the Daily
last night, said "At this point I'm
really down. I have a lot of things
on my mind. I'll talk to you when
v'm ready." He indicated he
would continue to attend school
here until his graduation in June.
Coach Dick Gould said Mayer
explained it wasn't fun anymore.
Gould would say only that "he's
done a lot for me, a lot for the
v eam, a lot for the school. As far
as I'm concerned, we're still good
friends and will continue to be."
Mayer reportedly has been
pondering his future since the Ojai
tournament in April. Mayer
dropped out of Ojai prior to the
semifinals.
The loss of Mayer is
particularly crippling since the
Pacific Eight conference
tournament begins tomorrow in
Seattle, and since Pat DuPre will
not play in the Pac-B's due to an
injured wrist.
"The big question is doubles,"
Gould said. With Stanford's top
two teams, Mayer-Jim Delaney
and John Whitlinger-DuPre out
of action, things have changed.
Delaney-Whitlinger have been
hurriedly paired to play first
doubles, with Mark Mitchell-Nick
Saviano and Chico Hagey-Gene
Mayer at second and third.
The singles lineup is headed by
Delaney, a junior. He will be
followed by Whitlinger, Hagey, G.
Mayer, Saviano and Mitchell in
that order.
Hagey, a junior who was
All-American as a freshman,
received his dramatic promotion
after reaching the finals of the
California State Championships
last weekend. He did not even
play in the top six during the dual
matches here last month.
Adding to Gould's worries is
the fact that Stanford has been
victimized by a change in Pac-8
draw rules. Washington coach
Steve Hopps arranged the matches
so that the winner of the match
between the numbers one and
eight teams (Stanford and
Washington State) would play the
winners of the matches between

the three and six teams (USC and
Oregon State) in the semifinals.
This means, in effect, that
Stanford and USC, after disposing
