# SLA— Pawn In Paramilitary Takeover?
## 
### BILL EVERS GLENN GARVIN News Analysis 
Almost from the first appearance of the
Symbionese Liberation Army last fall, the American
ft has reacted to the militant group with confusion
and repugnance.
Immediately after the SLA claimed credit for the
assassination of Oakland School Superintendent,
Marcus Foster, several leftist journals denounced the
action as counterrevolutionary.
A few — including, in this area, the Real News,
♦he Stanford Black Students Union publication, and
\he Grapevine, an alternative newspaper operating
out of Palo Alto — put forth the theory that the
SLA was a police front, assassinating progressive
leaders and then laying the blame on
revolutionaries.
This police action would open the way for
drastically increased government harassment of
idicals, these journals charged.
For a time these conspiracy theories were shoved
into the background, but now, as leftist criticism of
the SLA pyramids in the wake of the Patty Hearst
kidnaping, some groups are advancing a more fully
developed theory of police involvement in the
militant organization.
Theorists
The two most vociferous proponents of the
police provocateur hypothesis are long-time
conspiracy-theorists Donald Freed and Mae Brussell.
They link a widely divergent series of events ranging
from the Kennedy assassinations to the attempt on
George Wallace's life to the Watergate break-in into
one massive theory of an impending takeover by
vntelligence services, the military and other
elements.
Brussell, who has previously theorized that the

CIA and other government agencies kidnaped
Martha Mitchell after she witnessed political "dirty
tricks," said last month in the Berkeley Barb:
'The killing of John Kennedy marked the
overthrow of a government elected by the majority.
It was also the signal for a domestic 'war' against
minorities, students, and prisoners, and for the
escalation of the war in Southeast Asia. The Hearst
kidnaping is the beginning of the reign of terror on
our streets.
"It will be used to justify larger police forces,
more repression, and larger and more expensive
prisons. There will be increased public distrust of
lesbians, gays, hippies, radicals, communes, and
genuine protesters who will be described as terrorist
guerillas. The most important scare tactic will be to
link this kidnaping to worldwide guerilla
movements."
Author
Freed, who will speak in Cubberley tonight at 8,
is the coauthor of Executive Action, a novel about a
right-wing conspiracy to kill John Kennedy.
He heads the Citizens Research and Investigation
Committee (CRIC), which last week issued a report
claiming Donald DeFreeze, self-proclaimed SLA
"Field Marshal Cinque," has been acting as a police
agent since 1965.
Freed has been closely associated with the Black
Panthers, who several weeks ago claimed that the
SLA was at the least cooperating with the police.
One facet of Freed's theory is that "the
Symbionese Liberation Army is, in part, a creature
of the Central Intelligence Agency."
SRI Involvement
Freed claims that the Stanford Research Institute
in Menlo Park (according to Freed, the ClA's "chief
West Coast base of operation"), funded and directed
a behavior modification unit at the state prison at

Vacaville. The Symbionese Liberation Army and its
forerunner, the Black Cultural Association,
developed within this behavior modification unit,
according to Freed.
Stanford Research Institute spokesman Ronald
Deutsch categorically denied the charges to the
Daily last night, adding "we have done no work
recently at Vacaville."
Central to Freed's thesis is the claim that
DeFreeze, the SLA's avowed leader, was a paid
informer for the Criminal Conspiracy Section of the
Los Angeles Police Department — an allegation that
the San Francisco Chronicle claims to have
independently verified.
Acquaintance
Freed relies for confirmation on the testimony of
Louis Tackwood, a one-time LAPD informer
himself, who claims he knew DeFreeze while both
were working for the intelligence unit.
Freed, like Brussell, agrees that the SLA is but
one more pawn in the overall paramilitary plot to
seize the government. Brussel summed up her
opinion of the Hearst kidnaping in the Berkeley
Barb last month:
"The script from the very beginning was to have
the nice rich white princess [Patty Hearst] kidnaped
by the mean black prison 'escapees'; to drag out the
scenario until the whole nation was involved with
Patty's fate; and then to sacrifice her. Donald
DeFreeze and Thero Wheeler would be the patsies.
DeFreeze would be the main patsy: the first black
Lee Harvey Oswald.
"He would wind up dead, or in jail, silenced, like
Sirhan Sirhan, Jack Ruby, Lee Harvey Oswald,
James Earl Ray, Arthur Bremer, and many other
patsies.... The whole plot for the paramilitary
takeover of the United States might come out in the
open if the truth is revealed about this kidnaping."
