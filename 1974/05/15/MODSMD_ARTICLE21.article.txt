## Soccer Shakes San Jose 
### Don Tollefson 
Last weekend, 15,617 people turned out for a
sports event in San Jose and I can assure you it
wasn't a San Jose State spring football scrimmage.
Guess again, now that college teams make up
baseball's farm system, the minor league San Jose
Bees are lucky to draw 1500 people and although
very popular, cockfighting is still outlawed in Santa
Clara County.
This particular event involved an outdoor field,
participants in shorts and a round ball. The final
clue is a boyish, aspiring minister from Texas named
Kyle Rote Jr. Alright, everyone who guessed soccer
can go to the head of the locker room.
Yes, soccer, that game which kills referees,
begins wars and causes mayhem throughout the
world, has finally invaded the tranquil Santa Clara
Valley. Football purists are probably horrified at
what they see as an "alien" invasion of their
precious stadia. Joe Namath notwithstanding, it
can't be denied that world-wide soccer is infinitely
more popular than the gladiatorial combat which
has replaced baseball (yawn) as our official, White
House approved national pastime.
The North American Soccer League to which
the San Jose Earthquakes belong does not represent
the first effort at popularizing soccer as a
professional sport in the United States. Earlier
efforts failed miserably, but now the sport shows
some indications of reaching a level of viability in
the big business world of professional athletics.
Rate Responsible
Rarely has the possible success of an entire sport
hung so completely on a single athlete as soccer
does on Rote. And it now looks as if the son of
former football star Kyle Rote Sr. may turn the
trick, thanks in large part to what was most likely
an unintended assist from ABC Sports.
In an effort to prove that most Americans have a
sports tapeworm with an insatiable athletic
appetite, the people at ABC decided this winter to
vigorously promote their annual Superstars
competition which had made its debut with little
fanfare a year ago.
Familiar faces including John Havlicek, O.J.
Simpson and Johnny Bench gathered in Florida to
ride bikes, bowl, swim, play tennis and sell
products as participants in an extremely slick
attempt to determine who the "finest athlete" in
the country is. You'll never guess who won.
Rote's Superstars championship was about as
expected as a Harold Stassen election to the White
House. But while many of the other "superstars"
thoroughly embarassed themselves, Rote calmly
won a number of events and suceeded in putting
soccer on the American map and won $54,000 less

taxes in the process.
$54,000 may seem miniscule in an age of million
dollar WFL contracts, but to a pro soccer player in
America, $54,000 is almost a lifetime of earnings.
And what did Rote do with his windfall?
Charitable Gift
Kyle didn't try to deduct his playbooks, so the
tax man chopped off $27,000 leaving the Texan
with an identical sum. But did Kyle take the
remaining money and splurge on wine, women and
song as so many of America's greedy athletes
would've? No, he gave away $12,500 to support
athletics for handicapped children.
And still, yesterday's newspapers carried a
notice about how big-hearted a rookie pro football
star is because he contributed $1000 to his alma
mater. I'm sure that athlete's first-year salary is
considerably larger than Rote's Superstars
paycheck and his current $15,000 salary combined.
Consider for a moment the fact that Rote is ten
times as valuable to soccer as Rick Barry is to
basketball and remember that the average NBA
salary is reportedly somewhere around $90,000 a
year. Greed seems to all too often be the norm
among professional athletes and if NFL players
strike as threatened this season, football fans can
look forward to another full-scale assault on their
wallets as ticket prices continue to rise
astronomically.
Amidst all this selfishness, Rote is a welcome
find. His sanctimonious nature may appear too
overwhelming at times, but I definitely prefer a
little excess in this area than in the usual region of
greed. Hopefully this screenwriter's dream can
propel soccer to at least a breakeven status in the
world of pro sports.
At first, Rote was considered a pinko in his
native state for deserting a game which ranks right
behind God and LBJ in the mind of most Texans.
But recent reports indicate that over 35,000
youngsters are playing junior soccer in North
Texas.
Still the real test lies in attracting paying
customers to the ballpark. Hopefully the San Jose
fans and the 24,000 who showed up at the home
opener for Rote's Dallas Tornadoes weren't
one-timers lured by simple curiosity.
Soccer would be a welcome addition to the
sports scene here and its cross-cultural flavor could
represent a very beneficial change from the blatant
nationalism which has polluted all athletics and the
Olympics in particular in recent years. I wish Rote
and his chosen sport the best of luck. After all, 10
billion non-Americans can't be wrong.

the country is. You'll never guess who won.
Rote's Superstars championship was about as
expected as a Harold Stassen election to the White
House. But while many of the other "superstars"
thoroughly embarassed themselves, Rote calmly
won a number of events and suceeded in putting
soccer on the American map and won $54,000 less

taxes in the process.
$54,000 may seem miniscule in an age of million
dollar WFL contracts, but to a pro soccer player in
America, $54,000 is almost a lifetime of earnings.
And what did Rote do with his windfall?
Charitable Gift
Kyle didn't try to deduct his playbooks, so the
tax man chopped off $27,000 leaving the Texan
with an identical sum. But did Kyle take the
remaining money and splurge on wine, women and
song as so many of America's greedy athletes
would've? No, he gave away $12,500 to support
athletics for handicapped children.
And still, yesterday's newspapers carried a
notice about how big-hearted a rookie pro football
star is because he contributed $1000 to his alma
mater. I'm sure that athlete's first-year salary is
considerably larger than Rote's Superstars
paycheck and his current $15,000 salary combined.
Consider for a moment the fact that Rote is ten
times as valuable to soccer as Rick Barry is to
basketball and remember that the average NBA
salary is reportedly somewhere around $90,000 a
year. Greed seems to all too often be the norm
among professional athletes and if NFL players
strike as threatened this season, football fans can
look forward to another full-scale assault on their
wallets as ticket prices continue to rise
astronomically.
Amidst all this selfishness, Rote is a welcome
find. His sanctimonious nature may appear too
overwhelming at times, but I definitely prefer a
little excess in this area than in the usual region of
greed. Hopefully this screenwriter's dream can
propel soccer to at least a breakeven status in the
world of pro sports.
At first, Rote was considered a pinko in his
native state for deserting a game which ranks right
behind God and LBJ in the mind of most Texans.
But recent reports indicate that over 35,000
youngsters are playing junior soccer in North
Texas.
Still the real test lies in attracting paying
customers to the ballpark. Hopefully the San Jose
fans and the 24,000 who showed up at the home
opener for Rote's Dallas Tornadoes weren't
one-timers lured by simple curiosity.
Soccer would be a welcome addition to the
sports scene here and its cross-cultural flavor could
represent a very beneficial change from the blatant
nationalism which has polluted all athletics and the
Olympics in particular in recent years. I wish Rote
and his chosen sport the best of luck. After all, 10
billion non-Americans can't be wrong.
Last weekend, 15,617 people turned out for a
sports event in San Jose and I can assure you it
wasn't a San Jose State spring football scrimmage.
Guess again, now that college teams make up
baseball's farm system, the minor league San Jose
Bees are lucky to draw 1500 people and although
very popular, cockfighting is still outlawed in Santa
Clara County.
This particular event involved an outdoor field,
participants in shorts and a round ball. The final
clue is a boyish, aspiring minister from Texas named
Kyle Rote Jr. Alright, everyone who guessed soccer
can go to the head of the locker room.
Yes, soccer, that game which kills referees,
begins wars and causes mayhem throughout the
world, has finally invaded the tranquil Santa Clara
Valley. Football purists are probably horrified at
what they see as an "alien" invasion of their
precious stadia. Joe Namath notwithstanding, it
can't be denied that world-wide soccer is infinitely
more popular than the gladiatorial combat which
has replaced baseball (yawn) as our official, White
House approved national pastime.
The North American Soccer League to which
the San Jose Earthquakes belong does not represent
the first effort at popularizing soccer as a
professional sport in the United States. Earlier
efforts failed miserably, but now the sport shows
some indications of reaching a level of viability in
the big business world of professional athletics.
Rate Responsible
Rarely has the possible success of an entire sport
hung so completely on a single athlete as soccer
does on Rote. And it now looks as if the son of
former football star Kyle Rote Sr. may turn the
trick, thanks in large part to what was most likely
an unintended assist from ABC Sports.
In an effort to prove that most Americans have a
sports tapeworm with an insatiable athletic
appetite, the people at ABC decided this winter to
vigorously promote their annual Superstars
competition which had made its debut with little
fanfare a year ago.
Familiar faces including John Havlicek, O.J.
Simpson and Johnny Bench gathered in Florida to
ride bikes, bowl, swim, play tennis and sell
products as participants in an extremely slick
attempt to determine who the "finest athlete" in
the country is. You'll never guess who won.

native state for deserting a game which ranks right
behind God and LBJ in the mind of most Texans.
But recent reports indicate that over 35,000
youngsters are playing junior soccer in North
Texas.
Still the real test lies in attracting paying
customers to the ballpark. Hopefully the San Jose
fans and the 24,000 who showed up at the home
opener for Rote's Dallas Tornadoes weren't
one-timers lured by simple curiosity.
Soccer would be a welcome addition to the
sports scene here and its cross-cultural flavor could
represent a very beneficial change from the blatant
nationalism which has polluted all athletics and the
Olympics in particular in recent years. I wish Rote
and his chosen sport the best of luck. After all, 10
billion non-Americans can't be wrong.
Last weekend, 15,617 people turned out for a
sports event in San Jose and I can assure you it
wasn't a San Jose State spring football scrimmage.
Guess again, now that college teams make up
baseball's farm system, the minor league San Jose
Bees are lucky to draw 1500 people and although
very popular, cockfighting is still outlawed in Santa
Clara County.
This particular event involved an outdoor field,
participants in shorts and a round ball. The final
clue is a boyish, aspiring minister from Texas named
Kyle Rote Jr. Alright, everyone who guessed soccer
can go to the head of the locker room.
Yes, soccer, that game which kills referees,
begins wars and causes mayhem throughout the
world, has finally invaded the tranquil Santa Clara
Valley. Football purists are probably horrified at
what they see as an "alien" invasion of their
precious stadia. Joe Namath notwithstanding, it
can't be denied that world-wide soccer is infinitely
more popular than the gladiatorial combat which
has replaced baseball (yawn) as our official, White
House approved national pastime.
The North American Soccer League to which
the San Jose Earthquakes belong does not represent
the first effort at popularizing soccer as a
professional sport in the United States. Earlier
efforts failed miserably, but now the sport shows
some indications of reaching a level of viability in
the big business world of professional athletics.
Rate Responsible
Rarely has the possible success of an entire sport
hung so completely on a single athlete as soccer
does on Rote. And it now looks as if the son of
former football star Kyle Rote Sr. may turn the
trick, thanks in large part to what was most likely
an unintended assist from ABC Sports.
In an effort to prove that most Americans have a
sports tapeworm with an insatiable athletic
appetite, the people at ABC decided this winter to
vigorously promote their annual Superstars
competition which had made its debut with little
fanfare a year ago.
Familiar faces including John Havlicek, O.J.
Simpson and Johnny Bench gathered in Florida to
ride bikes, bowl, swim, play tennis and sell
products as participants in an extremely slick
attempt to determine who the "finest athlete" in
the country is. You'll never guess who won.
Rote's Superstars championship was about as
expected as a Harold Stassen election to the White
House. But while many of the other "superstars"
thoroughly embarassed themselves, Rote calmly
won a number of events and suceeded in putting
soccer on the American map and won $54,000 less

taxes in the process.
$54,000 may seem miniscule in an age of million
dollar WFL contracts, but to a pro soccer player in
America, $54,000 is almost a lifetime of earnings.
And what did Rote do with his windfall?
Charitable Gift
Kyle didn't try to deduct his playbooks, so the
tax man chopped off $27,000 leaving the Texan
with an identical sum. But did Kyle take the
remaining money and splurge on wine, women and
song as so many of America's greedy athletes
would've? No, he gave away $12,500 to support
athletics for handicapped children.
And still, yesterday's newspapers carried a
notice about how big-hearted a rookie pro football
star is because he contributed $1000 to his alma
mater. I'm sure that athlete's first-year salary is
considerably larger than Rote's Superstars
paycheck and his current $15,000 salary combined.
Consider for a moment the fact that Rote is ten
times as valuable to soccer as Rick Barry is to
basketball and remember that the average NBA
salary is reportedly somewhere around $90,000 a
year. Greed seems to all too often be the norm
among professional athletes and if NFL players
strike as threatened this season, football fans can
look forward to another full-scale assault on their
wallets as ticket prices continue to rise
astronomically.
Amidst all this selfishness, Rote is a welcome
find. His sanctimonious nature may appear too
overwhelming at times, but I definitely prefer a
little excess in this area than in the usual region of
greed. Hopefully this screenwriter's dream can
propel soccer to at least a breakeven status in the
world of pro sports.
