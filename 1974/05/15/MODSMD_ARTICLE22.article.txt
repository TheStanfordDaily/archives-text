# Gary Cavalli Appointed Sports Information Director
## 
### 
Gary Cavalli will succeed Bob
Murphy as Stanford's sports
information director, Athletic
Director Joe Ruetz announced
yesterday.
Cavalli, currently assistant
Information officer of the
Stanford Medical Center, will
assume his new position on June
17. Murphy resigned last month.
"Working at the Medical
Center has really been an
education — I've learned
something every day," Cavalli
said. "But I have to say that my
first love is sports. I'm really
excited about having a job I've
always wanted."
Cavalli, 25, received his A.B. in
communication from Stanford in
1971. During his freshman and
sophomore years he served as
sports editor of the Daily, and
later covered Stanford sports for
the Associated Press and the San
Francisco Chronicle. From
1969-71 he worked part-time as
Murphy's assistant in the sports
information office.
The new sports information
director will be a part of the
Department of Athletics
management team, Ruetz said,
and also will be responsible for
some public information on
women's intercollegiate sports.
Besides these responsibilities,
Cavalli indicated that he plans to
"place more emphasis on features
and profiles," as well as providing
more extensive publicity for

minor sports.
Cavalli said that his chief
concern will be establishing a
foundation of "credibility" for all
information emanating from his
office. He said that current sports
information secretary Jean
Zwicky will be elevated to the
title of administrative assistant.
Murphy will begin his duties as
Executive Director of the
East-West Shrine Football game
when Cavalli takes over the sports
information job on June 17.
Murphy will continue to
broadcast Stanford football games
on KSFO, as well as producing
and narrating Stanford's television
highlights show.
Cavalli will move from his
semi-plush Medical Center office
to the more drab athletic
department surroundings, but will
receive a slight raise in pay.
