Arabs Raid Israeli Settlement
MAALOT, Israel — Arab terrorists seized an Israeli
school near the Lebanese border before dawn today and
took at least 90 Israeli children hostage, officials reported.
The officials said the raiders threatened to kill the
youngsters unless the Israeli government freed 20 to 30
imprisoned Arab guerrillas by 6 p.m. (noon EDT).
Police said the terrorists invaded a nearby home and
killed a sleeping man, his wife and their two children before
taking over the school building and the children sleeping
inside.
Several hours before, a band of Arabs ambushed a
carload of Israeli Arabs near the border, killing a woman
and wounding 10 persons. But officials said they did not
know if they were the same terrorists who seized the school
in Maalot, a farming settlement five miles south of the
Lebanese border and 10 miles inland from the
Mediterranean.
Troops and police sealed off the area and manned
machine guns on rooftops around the school.
In other Mideast developments, Secretary of State Henry
A. Kissinger returned to Israel from Syria yesterday with no
agreement on a truce treaty between the two and with
negotiations for a disengagement pact "essentially in a
holding pattern," a senior U.S. official said.
But Syria and Israel both were "giving a little" and more
progress was made toward an agreement to end the fighting
on the Golan Heights front, the official said as Kissinger
flew back after 90 minutes of talks with Syrian President
Hafez Assad.
Reinecke: Court May Dismiss Case
S/\N FRANCISCO — Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke returned to
California yesterday md said there was "an optimistic
chance" that federa < rrjury charges against him will be
dismissed.
Reinecke also said he was not particularly concerned by
a new California Poll showing him trailing Controller
Houston I. Flournoy for the Republican nomination for
governor.
A survey of 899 persons showed that Reinecke had
fallen behind Flournoy by better than a four to three

margin.
Reinecke, who met newsmen as he returned from a
hearing in Washington on pretrial motions in his case, was
asked if he thought his attorneys' move to dismiss the
charges would succeed.
"I think there is at least an optimistic chance, there's
that hope," he said. 'The judge was very fair. I think the
proceedings went well."
In Washington, U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker
indicated he would rule by week's end on defense motions
including one to move the trial, scheduled July 15, to
Reinecke's home state.
More Gaps Found In Watergate Tapes
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee,
digging deeper into the Watergate cover-up as part of its
impeachment hearings, found more gaps in the evidence
yesterday as a result of the White House refusal to supply
more tapes.
Chief counsel John Doar recommended the committee
consider issuing subpoenas today for as many as 10 of the
76 presidential conversations it has requested.
Chairman Peter Rodino, D-N.J., said the request will be
considered at a 9 a.m. EDT meeting today before the
committee resumes hearing evidence gathered by the
impeachment inquiry staff.
A legal brief opposing Doar's request, prepared by
President Nixon's chief Watergate lawyer, James St. Clair,
was rejected by the committee on the grounds it contained
confidential material.
St. Clair's brief had been distributed when objections
were raised that it dealt with secret grand jury evidence
covered in a closed-door session last week.
The committee is conducting this phase of the inquiry in
secret to protect individuals mentioned in that evidence and
for that reason Rodino ruled St. Clair's memo was
unacceptable.

temperatures today and tomorrow in the 50s along the

Reinecke: Court May Dismiss Case
S/\N FRANCISCO — Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke returned to
California yesterday md said there was "an optimistic
chance" that federa < rrjury charges against him will be
dismissed.
Reinecke also said he was not particularly concerned by
a new California Poll showing him trailing Controller
Houston I. Flournoy for the Republican nomination for
governor.
A survey of 899 persons showed that Reinecke had
fallen behind Flournoy by better than a four to three

margin.
Reinecke, who met newsmen as he returned from a
hearing in Washington on pretrial motions in his case, was
asked if he thought his attorneys' move to dismiss the
charges would succeed.
"I think there is at least an optimistic chance, there's
that hope," he said. 'The judge was very fair. I think the
proceedings went well."
In Washington, U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker
indicated he would rule by week's end on defense motions
including one to move the trial, scheduled July 15, to
Reinecke's home state.
More Gaps Found In Watergate Tapes
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee,
digging deeper into the Watergate cover-up as part of its
impeachment hearings, found more gaps in the evidence
yesterday as a result of the White House refusal to supply
more tapes.
Chief counsel John Doar recommended the committee
consider issuing subpoenas today for as many as 10 of the
76 presidential conversations it has requested.
Chairman Peter Rodino, D-N.J., said the request will be
considered at a 9 a.m. EDT meeting today before the
committee resumes hearing evidence gathered by the
impeachment inquiry staff.
A legal brief opposing Doar's request, prepared by
President Nixon's chief Watergate lawyer, James St. Clair,
was rejected by the committee on the grounds it contained
confidential material.
St. Clair's brief had been distributed when objections
were raised that it dealt with secret grand jury evidence
covered in a closed-door session last week.
The committee is conducting this phase of the inquiry in
secret to protect individuals mentioned in that evidence and
for that reason Rodino ruled St. Clair's memo was
unacceptable.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but patches of low clouds this
morning. Lows tonight in the mid 40s to lower 50s. High
temperatures today and tomorrow in the 50s along the
coast and 60s to lower 70s inland. Small craft advisory for
west to northwest winds 20 to 30 mph decreasing tonight.
Arabs Raid Israeli Settlement
MAALOT, Israel — Arab terrorists seized an Israeli
school near the Lebanese border before dawn today and
took at least 90 Israeli children hostage, officials reported.
The officials said the raiders threatened to kill the
youngsters unless the Israeli government freed 20 to 30
imprisoned Arab guerrillas by 6 p.m. (noon EDT).
Police said the terrorists invaded a nearby home and
killed a sleeping man, his wife and their two children before
taking over the school building and the children sleeping
inside.
Several hours before, a band of Arabs ambushed a
carload of Israeli Arabs near the border, killing a woman
and wounding 10 persons. But officials said they did not
know if they were the same terrorists who seized the school
in Maalot, a farming settlement five miles south of the
Lebanese border and 10 miles inland from the
Mediterranean.
Troops and police sealed off the area and manned
machine guns on rooftops around the school.
In other Mideast developments, Secretary of State Henry
A. Kissinger returned to Israel from Syria yesterday with no
agreement on a truce treaty between the two and with
negotiations for a disengagement pact "essentially in a
