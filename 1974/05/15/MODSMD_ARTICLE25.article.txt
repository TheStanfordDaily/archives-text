# Fred Harris Stresses Economic Issues
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
"I don't think there's any question that working class
white people and working class black people have the same
economic interests," former Sen. Fred Harris, D-Okla., told
the Daily in ? a interview last night.
He blarr d the Democratic Party's defeat in 1972 on
Sen. McGovern's failure "to make these economic
issues the decisive issues." Harris, who was chairman of the
Democratic National Committee in 1969 and 1970,
launched a brief presidential bid himself in 1972 before he
ran short of money.
Harris and his Comanche wife LaDonna will appear
tonight on a panel discussing "The Future of the American
Left" at 8 in Bishop Auditorium.
The Harrises are staying in Wilbur Hall until tomorrow
afternoon as part of the ASSU Guest-in-Residence Program.
"What we normally talk about is coalitions," Harris said,
explaining the subject matter of his appearance tonight.
"Poor whites, minority groups — that is the future of the
Democratic Party."
Favorite Candidate
Explaining that his "favorite" candidate for the 1976
Democratic presidential nomination is Minnesota Sen.
Walter Mondale, Harris said, "He's a close friend and I think
he's best qualified." Harris said he did not think
Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy was a "shoo-in" if

he decided to seek the nomination.
On the subject of Watergate, Harris said President Nixon
should not resign "until he's charged by the House," so that
the case against him can be clearly presented.
"In my view, it is a certainty that the House will vote
impeachment," Harris said. "Then if he wants to resign,
maybe that would be the best course."
Asked if Nixon should resign even if he were not guilty,
Harris said, "If he's not guilty and has nothing to hide, he
ought to turn over the tapes" to the House Judiciary
Committee and to the Special Prosecutor's office.
Gerald Ford
Harris said that if Vice President Gerald Ford were to
become President, "he'd be very poor on economic issues. I
don't think he's very sensitive to people's problems. That's
been his voting record all along."
Mrs. Harris applauded Stanford's decision to discontinue
the use of the American Indian as its mascot, saying "it led
the way for every other college and university" which
abolished it. "We're the only live ethnic group that's used as
a mascot," she said.
The Harrises said they have previously stayed at Mount
Holyoke College in Massachusetts and Augustana College in
South Dakota this year. They said that one reason they
decided to spend a few days at Stanford was that their
daughter Kathy is a second year law student here.

the Daily in ? a interview last night.
He blarr d the Democratic Party's defeat in 1972 on
Sen. McGovern's failure "to make these economic
issues the decisive issues." Harris, who was chairman of the
Democratic National Committee in 1969 and 1970,
launched a brief presidential bid himself in 1972 before he
ran short of money.
Harris and his Comanche wife LaDonna will appear
tonight on a panel discussing "The Future of the American
Left" at 8 in Bishop Auditorium.
The Harrises are staying in Wilbur Hall until tomorrow
afternoon as part of the ASSU Guest-in-Residence Program.
"What we normally talk about is coalitions," Harris said,
explaining the subject matter of his appearance tonight.
"Poor whites, minority groups — that is the future of the
Democratic Party."
Favorite Candidate
Explaining that his "favorite" candidate for the 1976
Democratic presidential nomination is Minnesota Sen.
Walter Mondale, Harris said, "He's a close friend and I think
he's best qualified." Harris said he did not think
Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy was a "shoo-in" if

he decided to seek the nomination.
On the subject of Watergate, Harris said President Nixon
should not resign "until he's charged by the House," so that
the case against him can be clearly presented.
"In my view, it is a certainty that the House will vote
impeachment," Harris said. "Then if he wants to resign,
maybe that would be the best course."
Asked if Nixon should resign even if he were not guilty,
Harris said, "If he's not guilty and has nothing to hide, he
ought to turn over the tapes" to the House Judiciary
Committee and to the Special Prosecutor's office.
Gerald Ford
Harris said that if Vice President Gerald Ford were to
become President, "he'd be very poor on economic issues. I
don't think he's very sensitive to people's problems. That's
been his voting record all along."
Mrs. Harris applauded Stanford's decision to discontinue
the use of the American Indian as its mascot, saying "it led
the way for every other college and university" which
abolished it. "We're the only live ethnic group that's used as
a mascot," she said.
The Harrises said they have previously stayed at Mount
Holyoke College in Massachusetts and Augustana College in
South Dakota this year. They said that one reason they
decided to spend a few days at Stanford was that their
daughter Kathy is a second year law student here.
"I don't think there's any question that working class
white people and working class black people have the same
economic interests," former Sen. Fred Harris, D-Okla., told
the Daily in ? a interview last night.
