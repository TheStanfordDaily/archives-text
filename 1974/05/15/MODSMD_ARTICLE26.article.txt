# Shum way's Testimony Supports Brain Stoppage View Of Death
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
OAKLAND — Famed heart
transplant specialist Norman
Shumway, professor of cardiovascular
surgery at the Stanford Medical
Center, tried to make the medical
definition of death "a part of legal
understanding" when he testified for
the state in a murder trial here
yesterday.
"An individual is dead when his
brain is dead," Shumway said.
Shumway helped remove and
transplant the heart of Samuel M.
Allen Jr., also known as Moore, who
was shot in the head Sept. 10. A.D.
Lyons, 37, is charged with first-degree
murder and is being tried in Alameda
County Superior Court.
Deputy Dist. Atty. Albert Meloling
explained, "We've already proved the
crime was committed with the first six
witnesses. Now we have to prove
proximate cause of death. It's a
question of whether it was the gun or
the removal of the heart which caused
death."
Shumway stated flatly there was no
question in his mind that Allen was
dead when he helped remove Allen's
heart two days after the shooting. He
said he was informed that Allen's brain
was absolutely dead by experts
including Dr. Robert Burns, chief
surgical resident at Highland Hospital
where Allen was a patient.
Potential Donor
Last Wednesday John Cruikshank,
Lyon's defense attorney suggested to
the jury that Burns may have valued
Allen more as a potential heart donor
than as a man whose life was to be
saved.
Shumway countered yesterday that
neurosurgeons follow a "rigid
protocol" in determining brain death
and make this decision "prior to our
particular interest in the donor."
Allen's heart was kept beating by a
respirator and other mechanical
devices but several electroencephalo
grams (EEG) made 24 hours apart
indicated Allen's brain was dead.
Dead Brain — Live Heart
The mild-mannered Shumway
explained that an individual lives as
long as his brain is alive — even if his
heart has stopped. An individual with
a dead brain is dead — despite a
beating heart.
"We stop hearts from beating
several times a day [during
operations]," Shumway pointed out.

"As long as the brain can be
maintained, our patient is very much
diagnosible phenomenon."
In cross-examination, Cruikshank
asked, "Do you have the situation (in
a transplant operation] where two
people might die?"
Shumway corrected him. "One
person is dead."
Cruikshank ventured again, "In the
event of a successful heart transplant
we know one person is going to be
dead?"
"No, Shumway said, "We know one
person is dead."
Death, defined as brain death rather
than heart stoppage, is a relatively new
concept, even in medicine, said
Shumway.
Cruikshank asked, "Would you say
alive .... No one is dead until the

brain is dead."
'This was proved by removing the
heart from a dog and actually putting
it back in place after one-half hour"
while the dog survived, Shumway
pointed out.
The heart "has its own beat, quite
separate from the central nervous
system," Shumway said, and it can be
kept pulsating even after the brain is
dead, because the nervous system is
"not requisite to cardial action."
"It's terribly important to
distinguish brain injury from brain
death," Shumway explained, defining
the latter as "an irreversible,
there's unanimity in the medical
profession?"
Shumway replied, "I don't suppose
there is unanimity on any subject in
the medical profession."
