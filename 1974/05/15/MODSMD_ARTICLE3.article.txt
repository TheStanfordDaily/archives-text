# Trustee Jones Resigns
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
SAN FRANCISCO — Aerospace
executive Thomas V. Jones resigned
from the Stanford Board of Trustees
yesterday, less than two weeks after he
pleaded guilty to making illegal
campaign contributions.
The resignation was announced in a
terse statement issued by Robert
Minge Brown, president of the Board
of Trustees. No reason was given for
the resignation, contained in a
personal letter to Brown.
Jones, chairman and president of
the Northrop Corp., had been under
mounting pressure to quit the board
since his May 1 guilty plea to charges
he used $150,000 in corporate funds
to finance contributions to the

Committee for the Re-election of the
President (CRP).
The Daily, the Palo Alto Times and
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo
Park, had all called publicly for his
resignation. Many University officials,
while maintaining official silence on
the matter, privately said in no
uncertain terms that Jones should
quit.
University President Richard W.
Lyman said last night that he felt
Jones' action was "an appropriate
thing to do" given the circumstances,
but said he hoped and expected that
Jones would remain active in
University affairs.
Jones' Contributions
According to the Watergate Special

Prosecutor's office, Jones "did aid,
abet, counsel and command"
Northrop to engage in a complicated
plan for making illegal contributions
to the CRP and then covering up
evidence of the transactions.
Corporate funds, channeled
through a European consultant
associated with Northrop, were
delivered to the CRP from March 16,
1974 to March 4, 1974. False,
back-dated documents purporting to
show that only personal funds had
been used in the contributions were
shown to investigators.
Les Daly, Northrop vice president
for public affairs, said yesterday that
Jones' resignation from the trustees
was "a private matter" that did not
concern Northrop. He said Jones was
out of the immediate Los Angeles area
and was not available for comment.
Other Resignations
Since he pleaded guilty to the
Special Prosecutor's charges, Jones has
resigned the three directorships he
held outside of Northrop. In the past
two weeks, he has left positions with
U.S. Steel, Wells Fargo Bank and the
Times-Mirror Corp., which publishes
the Los Angeles Times and Newsday.
Daly said Jones had resigned the
outside positions to devote more time
to his Northrop duties.
Jones, 53, had been a Stanford
trustee since February, 1968. His term
was scheduled to expire this
November, but he would have been
eligible for re-election.
Jones was first publicly identified
with the Watergate-related
investigations when Herbert W.
Kalmbach, President Nixon's personal
attorney, told the Senate Watergate
Committee last summer that he had
received $75,000 in cash from Jones in
July, 1972. The money — actually
only $50,000, according to
prosecutors — was eventually used as
support money for the seven original
Watergate conspirators burglars.
After Jones entered his guilty plea,
the prosecutors granted him another
appearance before a federal grand jury
investigating campaign finances to
"recant" previous false testimony he
made. Federal law allows a witness to
recant false testimony without facing
perjury charges if the false testimony
has not substantially affected the
proceedings or if it has not become
obvious that the false testimony will
be exposed.
