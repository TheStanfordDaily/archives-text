# Most Departments Unaffected
## Grad Students Boycott Classes 
### DAVID SMITH 
A walkout of graduate student
teaching assistants (TAs) and research
associates (RAs) in support of the
striking United Stanford Employees
(USE) union gained scattered support
around the University yesterday,
although many academic departments
were largely unaffected by the
boycott.
Picketing for much of the day at
Encina Hall and various Quad
locations was led by members of the
Stanford Teaching and Research
Employees Union (STREU), which
seeks bargaining power for
now-unrepresented TAs and RAs, and
by Chicano Student Strike Support
Committee members.
At the Physics Department, ten
research associates affiliated with the
Stanford Union of Research Physicists

(SURP), the, union which is trying to
gain accreditation from the National
Labor Relations Board, picketed
outside entrances and delivery ramps
all day.
Among academic departments, the
walkout apparently drew its strongest
support from Spanish and Portuguese
departments, where five TAs and four
lecturers stayed away from classes.
Spokesmen from the German studies,
history, physics and sociology
departments also cited TA support for
the walkout in those departments.
Leaders of the walkout emphasized
that the strike was primarily a show of
support for USE. "We're not picketing
for recognition," SURP head Sam
Stein declared. "We're picketing to
show where our heads are at."
Other Support
Members of the English Review
Club, which comprises graduate
students in English, comparative
literature and modern thought and
literature, resolved at a noon meeting
to "symbolically support" the USE
strike by holding classes outside of
University buildings.
The Club also urged instructors to
discuss strike issues during class time.
Review Club president David Langston
said the resolutions would affect at
least 20 classes, ranging from freshman
English to sections of many large
classes.
The STREU-led picketing, which
centered at Encina Hall in the early
morning, reached its peak during the
late morning, when about 40
demonstrators massed outside Dean of
Graduate Studies Lincoln Moses'
office.
Chanting slogans such as "Students
support USE" and "TAs and RAs are
workers too," the pickets marched
around the inner Quad for a few
minutes and then joined SURP
pickets.
Pickets At Cubberley
The same group gathered in front
of Cubberley Auditorium at 11 a.m. to
urge a student boycott of the Biology
1 class there, but they gained no
evident support from undergraduates
or biology TAs.
"We have had very encouraging
verbal support from both graduate

students and faculty," stated Leslie
Daniels of STREU. "I think the
majority of graduate students support
the strike, but undergrads are really
split on the issue," she said.
Daniels said she thought junior
faculty members were being
threatened with loss of pay if they
openly supported the strike.
SURP Walkout
Stein said he was "reasonably
pleased" with the effects of the SURP
walkout. "I was surprised at the
number of Stanford undergraduates
willing to ignore that TAs and RAs
need wage increases, too," he noted.
History Department Chairman
Gordon Craig said of TA strike
support in his department, 'This is
their own dpcision." He said that the
TAs have a right to stay out, "but
their first responsibility is to keep the
place open."
STREU leaders say that future
walkout plans are still uncertain, but
that a repeat of today's strike is
possible tomorrow.

A walkout of graduate student
teaching assistants (TAs) and research
associates (RAs) in support of the
striking United Stanford Employees
(USE) union gained scattered support
around the University yesterday,
although many academic departments
were largely unaffected by the
boycott.
Picketing for much of the day at
Encina Hall and various Quad
locations was led by members of the
Stanford Teaching and Research
Employees Union (STREU), which
seeks bargaining power for
now-unrepresented TAs and RAs, and
by Chicano Student Strike Support
Committee members.
At the Physics Department, ten
research associates affiliated with the
Stanford Union of Research Physicists

(SURP), the, union which is trying to
gain accreditation from the National
Labor Relations Board, picketed
outside entrances and delivery ramps
all day.
Among academic departments, the
walkout apparently drew its strongest
support from Spanish and Portuguese
departments, where five TAs and four
lecturers stayed away from classes.
Spokesmen from the German studies,
history, physics and sociology
departments also cited TA support for
the walkout in those departments.
Leaders of the walkout emphasized
that the strike was primarily a show of
support for USE. "We're not picketing
for recognition," SURP head Sam
Stein declared. "We're picketing to
show where our heads are at."
Other Support
Members of the English Review
Club, which comprises graduate
students in English, comparative
literature and modern thought and
literature, resolved at a noon meeting
to "symbolically support" the USE
strike by holding classes outside of
University buildings.
The Club also urged instructors to
discuss strike issues during class time.
Review Club president David Langston
said the resolutions would affect at
least 20 classes, ranging from freshman
English to sections of many large
classes.
The STREU-led picketing, which
centered at Encina Hall in the early
morning, reached its peak during the
late morning, when about 40
demonstrators massed outside Dean of
Graduate Studies Lincoln Moses'
office.
Chanting slogans such as "Students
support USE" and "TAs and RAs are
workers too," the pickets marched
around the inner Quad for a few
minutes and then joined SURP
pickets.
Pickets At Cubberley
The same group gathered in front
of Cubberley Auditorium at 11 a.m. to
urge a student boycott of the Biology
1 class there, but they gained no
evident support from undergraduates
or biology TAs.
"We have had very encouraging
verbal support from both graduate

students and faculty," stated Leslie
Daniels of STREU. "I think the
majority of graduate students support
the strike, but undergrads are really
split on the issue," she said.
Daniels said she thought junior
faculty members were being
threatened with loss of pay if they
openly supported the strike.
SURP Walkout
Stein said he was "reasonably
pleased" with the effects of the SURP
walkout. "I was surprised at the
number of Stanford undergraduates
willing to ignore that TAs and RAs
need wage increases, too," he noted.
History Department Chairman
Gordon Craig said of TA strike
support in his department, 'This is
their own dpcision." He said that the
TAs have a right to stay out, "but
their first responsibility is to keep the
place open."
STREU leaders say that future
walkout plans are still uncertain, but
that a repeat of today's strike is
possible tomorrow.
