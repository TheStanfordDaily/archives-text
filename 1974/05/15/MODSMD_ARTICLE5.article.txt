# Roth Advocates Reforms Through Coalition Politics
## 
### GEORGE TIBBITS 
Calling for greater involvement by
citizens in the political process and a
return to coalition politics,
gubernatorial hopeful William Matson
Roth explained his platform to an
enthusiastic crowd in Bishop
Auditorium yesterday afternoon.
Roth, who calls himself an
"individual Democrat," advocated a
number of liberal reform measures.
These included a thorough overhaul of
the state prison system,
decriminalization of marijuana,
increased state aid for education, and
the creation of a state planning agency
to deal with energy, transportation,
land use and other environmental
problems.
Besides reform, Roth encouraged
greater participation in politics by
individuals. "We require in this
country a 'revolution of the
imagination,' " he said, quoting Rev.
William Sloane Coffin. "It's essential
that people in college participate in
this revolution. It's one thing to have
the 18-year-old vote, and another
thing to use it."
Along with this increased
participation, Roth advocated a
change within the political system
through coalition politics. To achieve
needed reforms, he said, "You play
the game of coalition politics. You
work with groups who are aiming in
the same direction as you."
Coalition Groups
Among the groups Roth mentioned
as worthy of support were Common
Cause, the People's Lobby and others
working for Proposition 9, the state
election reform initiative; labor groups
such as the United Farm Workers;
environmental organizations; and
minority groups including women's,
ethnic, and homosexual rights groups.
"A coming together of interests
must happen," Roth said, "if we are to
thrust the nation towards social
justice."
Roth, 57, is a former director of
Matson Navigation Co. and Crocker
National Bank and developer of
Ghirardelli Square. Since 1961 he has
served as a regent of the University of
California. During the Kennedy and
Johnson Administrations he served as

the U.S. chief foreign trade negotiator.
Prankster
Roth was introduced by political
prankster Dick Tuck, who described
Roth as "a man who is fiercely
independent," and "not a politician."
An old and avowed enemy of
Richard Nixon, Tuck is mentioned not
endearingly by the President in several
of the Watergate tape transcripts.
Tuck suggested that the Watergate
scandal might be ended by allowing
the President to invite all those
implicated in the affair to a party at
the Western White House. Congress
could then quickly meet, Tuck said,
and officially change the name "San
Clemente" to "San Quentin."
"We spent $17 million on security
[for the San Clemente complex],"
Tuck said. "For 50 cents, we can
reverse the locks."
Roth, calling Tuck an "old friend,"
praised his approach to politics as a
good mixture of fun and seriousness.
He admitted, however, that he doesn't
alwavs take Tuck's advice.
