# SCIRE Funding
##

James Gibbs, Jr.

In a Daily column (May 10),
Prof. Jack Friedenthal and several
members of the SCIRE Policy
Board have stated that the
difficulty in obtaining funding for
SCIRE is not their responsibility
(as an earlier Daily article quotes
me as implying), but mine.
The SCIRE Board is right, they
are not responsible for the
difficulties of securing funds. It is
most accurate to say that the
difficulties in raising funds for
innovative educational activities
are situational, many of them
beyond my control, SCIRE's, or
the University's for that matter.
Both the SCIRE Board's letter
and the earlier Daily article that
led to it grew out of my talk to
the SCIRE Board on April 30,
1974. It is clear to me that my
talk did not convey what I
intended it to convey, and I take
responsibility for not having
communicated clearly.
I told the Board that the plan
for the future of SCIRE on which
it worked for several months is a
good one and that I would
support it. I also indicated that I
would secure the necessary funds
for it, although some of those
funds would have to come from

sources other than the sources we
have used up to now. I did speak
of some of the difficulties that
would be involved. But
overcoming those difficulties I
take as my task, not SCIRE's.
I did not ask the Board to
secure funds; that is my
responsibility. To help me in that
task I did ask them to clarify
some of the statements in their
plan and to develop with me
clear-cut criteria by which the
effectiveness of their planned
SCIRE programs could be
evaluated two or three years from
now.
The timing of the completion
of the SCIRE Board's report is
not a significant factor in the fund
raising situation. I regret having
referred to that timing in an
off-hand manner in talking to the
Daily.
In no way do I wish to detract
from the achievement the SCIRE
Board has made in developing a
plan for the future. That plan
strengthens SCIRE's potential for
serving as a catalyst in
undergraduate education at
Stanford.
