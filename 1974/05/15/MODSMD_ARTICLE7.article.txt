USE And 'Unreason'
Editor:
Tim Ferguson, in his anti-union
diatribe in the Daily (May 13),
attempted to substitute righteous
fervor and passion for reason. It
failed to carry him far.
The strike, Ferguson fumes, is
"an effort whose underlying
theme, if not goal, is the
evisceration of this University."
Now, really. Clearly it is not in
University employees' interest to
destroy their employer; what
Ferguson means by his usage of
"eviscerate" (much less his coy
juggling of "themes" and "goals")
lies beyond the imagination of
this reader.
"The unreason of bygone years
has returned: witness USE's
demand for a 25 percent wage and
benefits increase. ..."
Ferguson, one gathers, does
not live on a maintenance man's
wage, and has had little
experience with what runaway
inflation can do to relatively
meager earnings. University
employees have had no
cost-of-living increases in two
years. If there's "unreason" in this
situation, it's right there.
The specter of increased
tuition to help pay a living wage
to working people has Ferguson
waxing wroth. Nothing, however,
enrages him more than the notion
of students — well-brought-up,
upper-middle-class,
pre-professional students —
deserting their narrowest interests
to support the union's cause. This,
Ferguson declaims, has the
University "swept toward insanity
again."
Insanity, indeed. Unreason,
indeed.

As one who years ago pushed
for the abolition of all language,
history and area requirements, I
find the recent to-do between
Prof. Nancy Packer and the
people in the language

departments rather amusing.
Packer has a good point:
language training by itself will
never introduce students to
humanistic systems of thought.
Only courses with emphasis on
the great questions of humankind
can do that.
Language training, though
central to humanism, is irrelevant
to an introduction to humanism
(which is, after all, what is being
discussed).
But everyone has forgotten
why the old requirements were
abolished in the first place — and
in the "old days" we had both
area and language requirements,
and others besides.
You can require any course
you want but you can't make
anyone learn.
I can (and have) sat through
chemistry classes, mathematics,
English literature, Western
civilization, sociology and so on
ad infinitum — even got passable
grades — but what do I
remember? Only that I "had to
take" the course, was bored, "did
my time" and got out as soon as I
could. (School as jail.)
Required courses only
guarantee that the student will
learn to get around the
requirements with as little pain as
possible. (Come to think about it,
that's a rather useful skill.)
If you really want
"well-rounded" students, the only
solution is a strong adviser system.
If every student knew one or
more mature scholars, sincerely
interested in his or her education,
and who kept up to date on his or
her intellectual progress — who
could say "you know, there's
more to life than that. You ought
to read. ..." — that would do the
trick.
But to institutionalize that
would take several million of Dick
Lyman's precious bucks, more
well-rounded faculty members
than we've got and a lot of
dedicated person-hours — plus a
level of sensitivity and
communication that might just
turn this place into the
"community of scholars" it
wishes it were.
Don't count on it.

deserting their narrowest interests

Insanity, indeed. Unreason,

As one who years ago pushed
for the abolition of all language,
history and area requirements, I
find the recent to-do between
Prof. Nancy Packer and the
people in the language

departments rather amusing.
Packer has a good point:
language training by itself will
never introduce students to
humanistic systems of thought.
Only courses with emphasis on
the great questions of humankind
can do that.
Language training, though
central to humanism, is irrelevant
to an introduction to humanism
(which is, after all, what is being
discussed).
But everyone has forgotten
why the old requirements were
abolished in the first place — and
in the "old days" we had both
area and language requirements,
and others besides.
You can require any course
you want but you can't make
anyone learn.
I can (and have) sat through
chemistry classes, mathematics,
English literature, Western
civilization, sociology and so on
ad infinitum — even got passable
grades — but what do I
remember? Only that I "had to
take" the course, was bored, "did
my time" and got out as soon as I
could. (School as jail.)
Required courses only
guarantee that the student will
learn to get around the
requirements with as little pain as
possible. (Come to think about it,
that's a rather useful skill.)
If you really want
"well-rounded" students, the only
solution is a strong adviser system.
If every student knew one or
more mature scholars, sincerely
interested in his or her education,
and who kept up to date on his or
her intellectual progress — who
could say "you know, there's
more to life than that. You ought
to read. ..." — that would do the
trick.
But to institutionalize that
would take several million of Dick
Lyman's precious bucks, more
well-rounded faculty members
than we've got and a lot of
dedicated person-hours — plus a
level of sensitivity and
communication that might just
turn this place into the
"community of scholars" it
wishes it were.
Don't count on it.

USE And 'Unreason'
Editor:
Tim Ferguson, in his anti-union
diatribe in the Daily (May 13),
attempted to substitute righteous
fervor and passion for reason. It
failed to carry him far.
The strike, Ferguson fumes, is
"an effort whose underlying
theme, if not goal, is the
evisceration of this University."
Now, really. Clearly it is not in
University employees' interest to
destroy their employer; what
Ferguson means by his usage of
"eviscerate" (much less his coy
juggling of "themes" and "goals")
lies beyond the imagination of
this reader.
"The unreason of bygone years
has returned: witness USE's
demand for a 25 percent wage and
benefits increase. ..."
Ferguson, one gathers, does
not live on a maintenance man's
wage, and has had little
experience with what runaway
inflation can do to relatively
meager earnings. University
employees have had no
cost-of-living increases in two
years. If there's "unreason" in this
situation, it's right there.
The specter of increased
tuition to help pay a living wage
to working people has Ferguson
waxing wroth. Nothing, however,
enrages him more than the notion
of students — well-brought-up,
upper-middle-class,
pre-professional students —
deserting their narrowest interests
to support the union's cause. This,
