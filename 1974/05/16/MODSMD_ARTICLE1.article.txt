# Proposed Row Housing
## Architecture Plans Rejected 
### DENIS CUFF 
A University committee cast doubt
on the future of the proposed emeritus
faculty housing project on the Row
yesterday by rejecting architectural
plans for the complex.
In a four hour meeting marked by
strong disagreement between student
and faculty and staff members, the
University Land and Building
Development Committee voted three
to two with one abstention to reject
schematic plans presented by Wong,
Brochini & Assoc. Two of the three
student committee members voted
against the plans; the other abstained.
Shortly before this decision, the
committee's chairman, Sociology Prof.
Richard Scott, cast a tie breaking vote
favoring a recommendation that the
Row site be used for emeritus faculty
housing. All three student members
voted against this proposal in a four to
three decision.
Confused
' The committee's action left
University officials confused as to the
future of the project.
"The committee voted for the site
and against the plans," said Robert
Summers, the director of faculty staff
housing.
Summers and Ed Shaw, executive
assistant to the vice president and
provost, are conducting a review of the
project requested by President Richard
Lyman. Before yesterday's meeting,
Shaw said he expected to give his
report to Lyman by the end of the
week. After the meeting, Shaw said he
wanted to meet with the committee
again before making any
recommendations to Lyman. The
committee meets again next
Wednesday.
"I'm confused and disappointed,"

Shaw said. "I'm trying to fully
understand what happened. What
student and faculty committee
members failed to address was the
question of whether the [Row] site
was suitable for the project. I was
unable to get a definite answer on why
the architectural plan was rejected."
Students Lloyd McCaugherty and
Joellyn Murphy and Prof. of
Engineering-Economic Systems David
Luenberger voted against the plans.
Surroundings
Murphy said she voted against the
plans because she "didn't think the
architectural plans fit into the Row. I
didn't think the architect made
enough effort to ensure the project
would blend in with its surroundings."
She said the model of the building
plans presented at the meeting "made
the project seem like another
Escondido Village." The eight
residence structures would be "box
like," she remarked.
Bad Questionnaire
Murphy said the results of a market
demand survey for the project
presented yesterday didn't convince
her enough people wanted to live in
the project. "I thought the
questionnaire was terrible. It was forty
three pages of unsummarized data,"
she said. "Shaw said he thought there
was a sufficient demand for the
project, but I couldn't see it based on
what he gave us."
Shaw said he didn't realize the data
had confused people, but that he was
sure there was a sufficient demand for
the 100-unit project. He said 78
emeriti, junior and visiting faculty
members responded they would move
in the project if it were built
immediately. Another 63 said they
preferred another site for the project.

Shaw said he thought some of the
63 who preferred another site would
live in the project even if it were built
on the Row. People who didn't
respond to the survey and junior
faculty not yet here might want to live
in the project, Shaw said.
Shaw said he believed the
University would have to build either
faculty or a student housing on the
Row.
Shaw said the only viable
alternatives for the faculty housing
project would be sites on Bowdoin
Street near Escondido Village and on
Santa Teresa Street southwest of
Lagunita Court.
Shaw said many people in
Escondido Village had told him they
didn't want the housing project on
their site. He also said the women's
physical education department might
want to use this site.
Shaw said the Santa Teresa site was
scheduled as the most likely place to
build new student housing.

in the project if it were built
immediately. Another 63 said they
preferred another site for the project.

Shaw said he thought some of the
63 who preferred another site would
live in the project even if it were built
on the Row. People who didn't
respond to the survey and junior
faculty not yet here might want to live
in the project, Shaw said.
Shaw said he believed the
University would have to build either
faculty or a student housing on the
Row.
Shaw said the only viable
alternatives for the faculty housing
project would be sites on Bowdoin
Street near Escondido Village and on
Santa Teresa Street southwest of
Lagunita Court.
Shaw said many people in
Escondido Village had told him they
didn't want the housing project on
their site. He also said the women's
physical education department might
want to use this site.
Shaw said the Santa Teresa site was
scheduled as the most likely place to

A University committee cast doubt
on the future of the proposed emeritus
faculty housing project on the Row
yesterday by rejecting architectural
plans for the complex.
In a four hour meeting marked by
strong disagreement between student
and faculty and staff members, the
University Land and Building
Development Committee voted three
to two with one abstention to reject
schematic plans presented by Wong,
Brochini & Assoc. Two of the three
student committee members voted
against the plans; the other abstained.
Shortly before this decision, the
committee's chairman, Sociology Prof.
Richard Scott, cast a tie breaking vote
favoring a recommendation that the
Row site be used for emeritus faculty
housing. All three student members
voted against this proposal in a four to
three decision.
Confused
' The committee's action left
University officials confused as to the
future of the project.
"The committee voted for the site
and against the plans," said Robert
Summers, the director of faculty staff
housing.
Summers and Ed Shaw, executive
assistant to the vice president and
provost, are conducting a review of the
project requested by President Richard
Lyman. Before yesterday's meeting,
Shaw said he expected to give his
report to Lyman by the end of the
week. After the meeting, Shaw said he
wanted to meet with the committee
again before making any
recommendations to Lyman. The
committee meets again next
Wednesday.
"I'm confused and disappointed,"

Shaw said. "I'm trying to fully
understand what happened. What
student and faculty committee
members failed to address was the
question of whether the [Row] site
was suitable for the project. I was
unable to get a definite answer on why
the architectural plan was rejected."
Students Lloyd McCaugherty and
Joellyn Murphy and Prof. of
Engineering-Economic Systems David
Luenberger voted against the plans.
Surroundings
Murphy said she voted against the
plans because she "didn't think the
architectural plans fit into the Row. I
didn't think the architect made
enough effort to ensure the project
would blend in with its surroundings."
She said the model of the building
plans presented at the meeting "made
the project seem like another
Escondido Village." The eight
residence structures would be "box
like," she remarked.
Bad Questionnaire
Murphy said the results of a market
demand survey for the project
presented yesterday didn't convince
her enough people wanted to live in
the project. "I thought the
questionnaire was terrible. It was forty
three pages of unsummarized data,"
she said. "Shaw said he thought there
was a sufficient demand for the
project, but I couldn't see it based on
what he gave us."
Shaw said he didn't realize the data
had confused people, but that he was
sure there was a sufficient demand for
the 100-unit project. He said 78
emeriti, junior and visiting faculty
members responded they would move
in the project if it were built
immediately. Another 63 said they
preferred another site for the project.

Shaw said he thought some of the
63 who preferred another site would
live in the project even if it were built
on the Row. People who didn't
