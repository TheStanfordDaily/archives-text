# Theories Of Justice And Equality

In his Theory of Justice, John Rawls
makes a case for the political goal of equality
— equality of condition except in instances
where such equality prevents the maximizing
of welfare at its minimum level.
In Rawls' words, "All social values —
liberty and opportunity, income and wealth,
and the bases of self-respect — are to be
distributed equally unless unequal
distribution of any, or all, of these values is
to everyone's disadvantage." This Rawls
terms the "generalized difference principle."
Rawls' case for egalitarianism contains
four principal errors: (1) it divides a person's
talents and willpower from the rest of him;
(2) To be able to recognize when a
condition of equality has been arrived at, it is
necessary to accept an unrealistic
assumption, namely, that persons' private
preference schedules can be discerned by
observers;
Problems Of Institution
(3) If one attempts to institute Rawls'
difference principle, one is led to tie the
condition of all, to those whose work has
been least preferred by consumers; and
(4) All egalitarian stationary states such as
that aimed at by Rawls' theory are unstable
because of their narrow "slice of life" or
"snapshot" time-frame, since any subsequent
gift or trade breaks up the condition of
equality.
Let us consider each of these matters
briefly in turn. First, the division of a person
from his talents and willpower is made on the
grounds that a person's characteristics and
social condition are determined by luck.
'Arbitrary' Distribution
It is true that the distribution of natural
assets can be considered arbitrary in a sense.

But no one has stolen his talents from
anyone, he just has them. This distribution of
talents by Nature in no way taints morally
the use of these talents by those who have
them.
Rawls' is trying to justify the control by the
government of the use and rewards of
everyone's personal attributes. Far better,
simpler, and less dangerous to institute the
libertarian and anti-egalitarian proposition
that individual is entitled to what he
creates.
Secondly, philosophic consideration
showff'that any true equality would have to
be anj equality of satisfaction. Yet economic
science shows that no quantitative measure
can b'fe assigned to an individual's satisfaction
and hence interpersonal comparisons of
satisfaction are impossible. This would seem
to rule out equality as a viable political goal.
Idea Of 'Natural Needs'
The alternative position to which many
egafrtarians turn is some idea of "natural
needs" and claims to goods and services to
fulfill these needs. For example, Harvard
philosopher Michael Walzer argues that
medical care should be distributed to
individuals not because they are wealthy,
intelligent, or righteous, but because they
are sick.
Yet this formulation ignores the (partial)
enslavement of the doctor and the taxpayer
involved.
Thirdly, by severing the natural link
between income and the process of
production and exchange, one is not only
encouraging inefficient production, one is
also rewarding those whose production has

been judged as inefficient in the past by
consumers.
'Current Time-Slice'
Fourthly and finally, egalitarianism is
constructed upon a foundation of "current
time-slice" or "end-result" principles of
justice. These principles, as outlined by
Harvard philosopher Robert Nozick in the
fall 1973 issue of Philosophy and Public
Affairs, hold that "the justice of a
distribution is determined by how things are
distributed (who has what) as judged by
some structural principle(s) of just
distribution."
In contrast, the entitlement theory of
justice held by libertarians is historical and
maintains that "whether a distribution is just
depends on how it came about [whether just
principles of original appropriation and of
exchange of titles were followed]."
A rule of "to each according to his moral
merit, or needs, or marginal product, or how
hard he tries, or the weighted sum of the
foregoing" will produce an overall societal
pattern. But the distribution in a libertarian
society will be unpatterned because it is the
consequence of individuals' free exchange of
property titles.
What Nozick recognizes is that whatever
liberty exists in a society will serve to disrupt
government-imposed patterns. For example,
even a charitable gift by one person to
another breaks up the government
determined pattern of distribution.
At a time like the present when equality is
readily accepted by intellectuals as the
primary political goal, we should be ever alert
to question it.
