# The 						Strike--No Fun For Anyone
##

Last Monday morning I passed
a small group of students
picketing in the Quad. Their chant
echoed loudly in the passageways
— "Strike! Strike! Workers — Yes!
Lyman — No!" There were
pauses.
During one of those moments
of relative silence I overheard one
student say to another, "Man.
This is more fun than the regular
going to college." I chuckled. But
not when I recalled that comment
a few moments later.
The chants of the picket line
were no surprise — at least for one
who has observed and even joined
in such lines before but in
different times and settings. I
must admit that I've never quite
adjusted to such simplistic
rhetoric in a University. But the
"This is more fun than . .. ."
comment was a sad thing to hear.
There are few, if any, at
Stanford who see much "fun" in
our labor dispute. Certainly not
the negotiators who have
experienced the frustrations and
agonies of the bargaining table for
hundreds of hours since last
November. Nor the people who
are striking and sacrificing work
and wages in order to make what
they and their leaders believe to
be legitimate points.
'Coercive Pressures'
Nor those who are not striking
because they can't afford to or
don't want to; a painful decision
either way and made worse by the
sometimes understanding and
sometimes coercive pressures from
some fellow workers.
Nor is it "fun" for faculty who
prize the teaching and research
that is "the regular going to
college," and who view theSe
tensions as an intrusion into that.
Nor for the administrators who
try to keep our educational
priorities and finances in balance.

Nor "fun" for the many students
who have already experienced
inconveniences because of the
dispute.
It is well to remember that this
strike is like others. It will end.
There will be a contract signed.
All of us who are being torn by
the strike will be working together
again.
Want To Work Together
Most of us feel deeply about
wanting to work together with the
kind of humaneness and

sensitivity to each other that
should characterize a university
community. Somehow there
seems to be little space in our
present situation for those who
are itching to warm up old
slogans; who are seeking the
"fun" of barricades excitement;
or to live vicariously at someone
else's expense.
Later that same day I learned
that a housekeeper in one of our
dorms was hassled by some of the
residents she was trying to serve.

"Why aren't you outside
picketing!" they demanded. One
of her co-workers was outside
picketing. She could well have
been asked, "Why aren't you
inside working?"
I wonder why we cannot
recognize how deeply personal
and troubling each worker's
decision was. And I wonder why
it is so difficult for some to
respect each of them for that.
