# Thoughts On The Strike

I would be the first to uphold Alana Guarnieri's
right to cross a picket line in order to work. I am
delighted that her salary is high enough so that the
inexorable rise in the cost of living does not affect
her. I applaud her high sense of morality and her
desire to base her actions on "what is right."
I therefore would expect that when the strike is
settled, she will be moral enough to reject any
increase in salary or any benefits which may have
been negotiated. She must realize that it is not
"right" for her to accept financial manna provided
by someone else's having laid wages and job on the
line.
The 200 who voted against a strike and those of
the "silent 600" who agree with Guarnieri should
make themselves known to the negotiators so that
the potential cost of their salary increases and
benefits can be deducted from the financial
calculations. This would doubtless help decrease
the present polarity.
I understand the students' lack of support for
the strike, as they fear their own pockets would
suffer, and would hope that tuition and board not
be affected. Permit me a cynical smile as I assume
that in other contexts, many of these students
would staunchly protest that they would never
become conservative when having jobs, spouses and
dependents.
I likewise agree that faculty and students are not
directly involved in what is at heart a
staff-administrative dialogue and would oppose the

disruption of classes. However, it must be
recognized that Stanford is an academic
community and that faculty and students could not
exist in isolation, could not pursue their goals of
higher learning without substantial shit-work
support from staff and administration.
The effects of a strike are obvious on mail
service and garbage-collection. To these should be
added a myriad of secretarial and service functions
which are not immediately obvious â€” reproduction,
record-keeping and the all-important (my bias) area
of acquiring and processing the very academic
materials which students and faculty need for
research.
The web of relationships between all the
members of the Stanford community must be
acknowledged, and if Stanford can afford the offers
needed to lure big-name professors (such as Inkeles,
Alegria, etc.) from other universities, then it can
afford to pay its workers the going rate for their
labor.
Stanford salaries are low by community
standards. Lower salaries may be off-set by "the
prestige of being associated with Stanford" in the
case of research assistants of fledgling professors,
but this same magic does not rub off on typists,
janitors or keypunches. I find many of the USE
demands excessive and unreasonable, but the
basic issues are sound.
