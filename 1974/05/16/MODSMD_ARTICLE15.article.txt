# On The ASSU Posts

Mike Herman
et al.

The recent series of articles
published by the Daily concerning
the ASSU Committee on
Nominations was the first publicity
the paper has given perhaps "the
most influential student group on
campus" in over a year.
As such, the articles were a
welcome, if overdue, idea. It is
therefore regrettable that the
and "factual" substance of the
writings were infused with
insinuation and innuendo that are
in the worst tradition of
interpretive journalism.
The articles emphasized the
more sensational aspects of the
Committee's proceedings last
Spring, taken mostly from the
remarks of Mike Nilsson, a
then-Committee member whose
performance was so poor that it
prompted the ASSU Senate to
request his resignation.
While last year's Committee
was indeed beset by blatant
political maneuvering, it is
irresponsible to imply that this
year's group is troubled by similar
pressures. The Committee of last
spring was divided into factions
headed by members of the
opposing Council of Presidents
slates, Beth Garfield and Tom
Flohr.
Harmony On Committee
This year, a similar situation
could have been presented itself,
as. the group included both Mike
Herman and 800 Bacon, the
leading presidential candidates.
The seven signatures following
this article, however, are
indicative of the harmony, rather
than possible rancor, that reigned
within the Committee this Spring.
Several of the accusations
made in the Daily's article were
clearly not manifest in this year's
Committee. In no instance was
any member of the student body
placed on more than one
Committee. At no time was there
the political division of bickering
supposedly inherent in the
Committee's deliberations.
At no time was food or any
other major or inexcusable
distraction allowed in the
interview room. At no time were
there more than seven people in
the room besides the interviewee.
(The only serious threat to that
statement occurred when two
Daily reporters attempted
unsuccessfully to force their way
into the room, an event that
would have destroyed the aura of
confidence surrounding
Committee proceedings.)
Met Four Hours Per Day
We of the Nominations
Committee are students and,
though we are active in campus
affairs, we also have serious
academic and social commitments
as well. Yet, for an average of four
hours a day between April 30 and
May 11, the Committee,
comprising a fine blend of critical
experience and refreshing novelty,
carefully considered all candidates
who presented themselves to us.
Each applicant was given a
10 to 15 minute interview in
which uniform questions were
asked, facilitating the inevitable
and necessary comparisons.
The most reassuring and
gratifying experience of the whole
affair was the final voting sessions.
Where last year, applicants were
often placed on Committees by
virtue of their political
persuasions (a most unfortunates
occurence for which all concerned
must bear responsibility), this
spring's nominations were made
very much on criteria of
application and interview
performance.
Censoral Consensus
Where last year voting was
often split along 4-to-3 lines, a
procedure which frustrated most
and satisfied no one. this year's
Committee, with rare exceptions,
chose students by consensus.
It cannot be said that
method for placing students on
University Committees is above
improvement. Resolutions are
now before the Rules and Bylaws
Committees of the ASSU Senate
that would polish several of the
rougher areas of the Committee's
procedure; the present group wil
seek further corrections over the
next year.
We appreciate the publicity the
Daily has seen fit to give us. We
hope that, in the future, the paper
will not continue the deplorable
techniques used in
compilation of this series, but will
treat those members of the ASSU
Committee on Nominations with
the fairness and equity with which
we attempt to treat committee
applicants.

Mike Herman, chairman, and six
other members of the
Nominations Committee.)
