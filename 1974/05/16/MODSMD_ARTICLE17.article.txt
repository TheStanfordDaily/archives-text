Searching for a brilliant or
influential woman in the pages of
American history books is for the
most part a lonely and
unrewarding task. Women are
largely ignored or, in their
sporadic appearances, the butt of
historians' jokes.
But such will not always be the
case, if the work of Mrs. J.
Littleton Daniel of Tulsa, Okla., is
any indication. Daniel will be
speaking on women in American
history at noon today in Room 87
of the Business School in this
week's CROW lecture. The slide

show on China previously
scheduled has been cancelled.
"For so many years women did
do things of importance and
achievement but since anything
that wasn't motherhood or good
works wasn't considered quite
nice, historians just left it out,"
Daniel says. "When you go
looking for the information in the
original source, it is there."
From her research in original
sources in such archives as the
Library of Congress, the New
York Public Library and others,
Daniel, a former teacher and
member of the Tulsa school

board, has developed a teaching
manual and a 10-cassette taped
series on "Women in United
States History," published this
year by the Educational
Development Corporation.
