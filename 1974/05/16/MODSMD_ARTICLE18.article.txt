# Ed School Professor Says
## Bicultural System Proposed 
### TONY DELLING 
Prof. Alfredo Castaneda of the
School of Education told a
Dinkelspiel Auditorium audience
Tuesday night that American
education must cease placing
value judgments on cultural
differences and must permit
children to have more than one
culture.
Noting that a substantial
number of children in the United
States are bicultural (i.e. come
from families with a
non Anglo-Saxon background),
Castaneda stressed the need for
"cultural democracy in
education." This concept entails
the notion that "all children
should have the right to identify
with things experienced at home,
while at the time they gain
exposure to new customs and
ways of thinking."
Since the turn of the century,
Castaneda noted, American
education has sought to break up
cultural groups and to assimilate
them into the Anglo-Saxon
mainstream. Educators have
spoken disparagingly of "foreign"
habits and customs, and bicultural
Americans have been seen as
"unpatriotic."

"But now," said Castaneda,
"Our thinking must change. We
must try to understand what
racial and cultural differences
mean with regard to education,
and not simply try to eliminate
those differences."
He maintained that the present
system, which ignores or
discredits minority cultures,
forces children into a radical
choice. Either they can accept the
culture and values of their parents
and completely reject
Anglo-American values and
culture, or they can completely
reject their parents' culture and
values and accept Anglo-American
culture and values.
It is much better for the child,
said Castaneda, to "identify with
both sets of heritages." Such an
identification can only be
obtained in a bicultural
educational system.
Valuable Elements
In the bicultural system, the
child combines valuable elements
of both cultures and does not
become hostile to either of them.
Moreover, he claimed that
bicultural education would
benefit Anglo-American children,
as well as those of ethnic and
cultural minorities. "All children
should be exposed to bicultural
education, not just minorities," he
said.
Castaneda then gave an
example of how he felt bicultural
education could benefit children.
He pointed out that most
Mexican-American children and
Anglo-American female children
learn at home by the
"modeling-imitation method"
where the parent shows the child

a means of solving a problem
which the child then copies.
4 Self-Disco very'
On the other hand, most
Anglo-American male children
learn at home by the
"self-discovery method," where
the child himself must find how
to solve problems with little
parental help. This method
predominates in present-day
American education.
Castaneda claims that the
dominance of the self-discovery
method has unfortunate
consequences. "The self-discovery
method in schools inhibits
children accustomed to learning in
the modeling-imitation method,"
he said.
Bicultural education,
Castaneda maintained, would
solve this difficulty by utilizing
both styles of learning. And while
children would be permitted to
continue to learn according to
their accustomed method, they
would gain competence in a new
mode of learning as well.
