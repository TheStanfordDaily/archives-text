# Shultz Offered Post By Business School
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
George Shultz, former secretary of
the Treasury and Labor departments,
has been offered a part-time
professorship in the Graduate School
of Business, according to Dean Arjay
Miller.
Shultz, who retired last month as
treasury secretary after serving more
than five years in the Nixon
Administration, has accepted a post as

executive vice president and member
of the Board of Directors of the
Bechtel Corp. in San Francisco. The
University hopes that he will find time
to serve as professor here, considering
the close proximity of Stanford to San
Francisco, Miller commented.
Unanimous
The department voted unanimously
to offer Shultz a professorship in
management and public policy, Miller
said. The appointment offer was
endorsed by business school and
administration officials and was
approved by the Board of Trustees on
Tuesday, he said.
'This is a firm offer and we expect
to receive Shultz's answer some time
next month," Miller declared. "We are
very excited about this offer. Shultz is
a distinguished scholar and would add
an important dimension to our
programs. His governmental
experience would fit in well with our
studies in public management.
Scholar
"Shultz is a distinguished scholar.
He has considerable experience in the
academic world and has authored
many books and articles. He is an
expert in the field of labor."
Shultz, 53, was the last original
member of the Nixon Cabinet to leave
the service of the Administration.
Serving as secretary of labor from
1969 until 1971, he was later director
of the Office of Management and the
Budget. While serving in the latter
capacity, he became well known as an
opponent of wage and price controls.
Treasury Secretary
In May 1972, Shultz succeeded
John Connally as Treasury Secretary,
serving until last month when he was
succeeded by William Simon.
A Princeton graduate, Shultz
received a Ph.D. in industrial
economics from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) in
1949. After serving on the MIT
faculty, Shultz joined the Eisenhower
Administration as a staff economist on
the President's Council of Economic
Advisers. He later served as an
economic consultant to the Labor
Department.
From 1962 until 1968, Shultz
served as dean of the Graduate School
of Business at the University of
Chicago.
