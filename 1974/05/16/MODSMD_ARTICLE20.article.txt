# Todd Rundgren's 'Utopia' Rocks Winterland
## 
### D. PAUL YEUELL 
SAN FRANCISCO - There's
nothing like "Rundgren" in the
Reader's Guide to Periodical
Literature between "rum" and
"runaway."
This extraordinary musician,
though little known, has written
some of the most outrageous rock
and roll of the past five years.
Unfortunately, he has almost
always been too outrageous.
Todd Rundgren has just
released his fifth album and he has
produced albums for the
Butterfield Blues Band, The James
Cotton Blues Band, and The
Band.
Yet, even serious rock and
rollers say, "Who's Todd
Rundgren?"
Waifish Dude
Todd Rundgren is a skinny
waifish dude with stringy hair in a

white satin jump suit on stage
beneath a huge snowy video of
himself playing a double neck
guitar through a stack of rock and
roll power that ripples faces like a
747.
That's how the first set of
Todd Rundgren's Utopia at
Winterland Friday night ended.
Todd Rundgren. Solo. Rippling
faces.
Then after a short break,
during which the wizards of
Winterland pacified the flock with
a video-taped concert of David
Bowie on the overhead screen and
the taped sound track down
below, Rundgren bounced back
on stage.
This time he wore a satin jump
suit the color of Easter
marshmallow candies and wings
on his shoulders. The wings came

off later when he changed guitars,
but the jump suit didn't need to.
Buck Rogers
The members of the band were
a trip in themselves. Face glitter,
clown make up, knee high boots,
Buck Rogers threads.
But Rundgren's new band is
amazing. Apart from Rundgren,
there are two keyboard players,
each with three different
keyboards including Univox
mini-synthesizers, a bass guitarist,
a drummer and a space man on a
huge blinking synthesizer and
mixer panel.
Rundgren and his band-played
two songs from his new album,
and then played "Black Maria," a
love song about as affectionate as
a rattlesnake but very heavy and
very tight.
After a medley of hot and
relatively new songs, Rundgren

played one that he first
introduced in 1968 at the
Monterey Jazz Festival called
"Open My Eyes."
'Get Closer'
"Maybe we can get a little
closer to Utopia," Rundgren said
as he cranked up the power.
Nobody knew for sure what
Utopia was. They thought it was
the band.
Rundgren's lead guitar work
during this song, which he
recorded when he was 18,
proved that he is one of the best
of the modern musicians to be
weaned on electric Gibsons.
Then, he brought things down
a bit by explaining "Utopia."
"In Utopia," he said, "they're
not into material things, they're
into energy." When they need to
get something done, say like
removing a president, they get

together on a hill side and let the
energy flow, said Rundgren.
'They can kind of store up this
energy," he said, "in a kind of
Utopian savings account."
"And if they put a wire into
it," Rundgren said turning to his
amplifier, "it would sound
something like this..." And they
launched into a solid 40 minute
set.
Boring, Intense
This set, called "Utopia," went
the range of the imagination, from
the mildly boring to the very
intense. But that intended
contrast was what made it work.
One slow break in "Utopia" let
everyone in the audience drift off
for a bit and look around at the
dancing and hugging and check
out the guy over there wearing a
full length mop and the queens
over there in Ann Southern

outfits.
Then Rundgren brought the
music back up again. And when
all the faces were rippling again, it
was apparent that maybe, if only
for a minute, this waifish looking
dude had painted a picture of his
Utopia.

Rock and roll has come a long
way since Rundgren began. The
better its technology becomes, the
more direct the expression of the
extraordinary imagination will be.
By seducing the audience into
the art form without their
noticing, Rundgren extended the
realm of rock and roll once more.
