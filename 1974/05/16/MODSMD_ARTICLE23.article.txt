# Guitarist Michael Lorimer Displays Rare Showmanship

"It's a weird guitar," classical guitarist Michael
Lorimer told friends backstage after his concert
Friday night. 'The strings kept slipping off the
frets." But no one could have guessed his trouble
Sy his fine performance.
Playing to an enthusiastic audience of nearly
800 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Lorimer (27)
showed what six summers of study under guitar
master Andres Segovia can do for a young guitarist.
Dressed in a red turtleneck, black jacket and
black pants, Lorimer opened with his own
arrangement of "Fantasie" by John Dowland.
Next he played four unusual modern pieces by
Frank Martin, exploiting the full range of the guitar
from soft harmonica to loud rasqueados (strums).
However, the strange sounds of this music did not
captivate the squirming audience.
The onlookers finally perked up when Lorimer
broke from his original program to play three
preludes by Reitor-Villa Lobos instead of the one
planned. These pieces were beautifully done as was
the rest of his 90-minute program.
The show featured music by such well-known
composers as Johann Sebastian Bach and Isaac
Albeniz.
Interpretations of two pieces — "Estudio Sin

Luz," and "Remembrance" — by his teacher,
Segovia, highlighted his performance.
After the program, the half-standing audience
brought Lorimer back for four encores. He played
the well-known "Recuerdos De La Alhambra" by
Francisco Tarrega, another Albeniz piece, and two
more Bach pieces.
This makes two good classical guitar concerts at
the University this year. Cristopher Parkening
played a collage of well-known pieces in a sold-out
Memorial Auditorium three months ago.
Lorimer proved himself to be more of a
showman than Parkening, who is a year younger.
Lorimer played the guitar with his whole body;
head bent to the neck of the guitar, body swaying,
and right foot roaming. Although his foot sliding
across the floor was distracting at times, his
movements in general — including his jaw exercises
which seemed to mimic his right hand motions —
added to the tenseness of his music.
Lorimer, who has played in concerts around the
world, is no stranger to Stanford. Last summer he
taught in the Music Department's lute workshop,
and two years ago he gave another concert here. At
a reception in Lagunita after the concert, Lorimer
greeted and spoke with many of his old friends.
