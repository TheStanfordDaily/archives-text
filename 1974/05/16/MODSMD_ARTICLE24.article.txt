Committee Seeks More Tapes
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee
voted 37 to 1 yesterday to subpoena 11 more Watergate
tapes President Nixon has refused to turn over to its
impeachment inquiry.
By top-heavy votes it also subpoenaed scheduling diaries
of Nixon's meetings and conversations during four periods,
and there were indications it would decide soon whether to
subpoena up to 66 more tapes dealing with non-Watergate
matters.
The committee members, meanwhile, got their first
chance yesterday to compare a tape already on hand with
the White House transcripts, and some found the recording
"more damaging" than the edited version.
One of two tapes heard by the panel was of a Sept. 15,
1972, meeting involving the President, H.R. Haldeman and
John W. Dean 111. A transcript of that conversation was
released last week by the President.
Kissinger Blasts Arab Attack
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
strongly condemned the Arab terrorist attack on an Israeli
school which killed 16 persons and wounded 17. Kissinger
vowed to continue his Middle East peace mission.
Kissinger canceled his scheduled flight to Damascus to
give the Israeli government time to respond to the terrorist
attack at Maalot in Northern Israel.
But he said he would resume his peace efforts today
with a flight to the Syrian capital to present Israel's latest
position on disengagement of forces on the Golan Heights
front. Kissinger said he still believed "both sides are moving
toward each other and not moving away."
The Israeli Cabinet was expected to meet before
Kissinger's departure to give him its views to pass on to
Syrian President Hafez Assad.
Kissinger issued a statement on the terrorist raid, saying
the United States condemned "this mindless and irrational
action" and "those who carry them out must be dealt with
severely."
Information Minister Shimon Peres thanked the
secretary for his statement but refused to link the attack
with the Kissinger mission.
Haig Testifies Before Committee
WASHINGTON — President Nixon reversed himself and
allowed his chief of staff to testify Wednesday before
Congress about the handling of a $100,000 contribution
from billionaire Howard Hughes.
Alexander M. Haig Jr.'s three-hour appearance before
the Senate Watergate committee followed warnings that an
earlier claim of executive privilege might be met with
contempt of Congress action by the panel.
The former four-star general told newsmen after the
closed session that "I answered all questions I was capable
of answering on that specific matter."
Chairman Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., and Sen. Lowell P.
Weicker, R-Conn., said Haig discussed the issue in detail,
beginning with accounts of White House conversations in
the spring of 1973, the time that Nixon's friend, C.G.
"Bebe" Rebozo, has said he returned the money intact to a
Hughes representative. Rebozo had received the money
four years ago.
Cranston Accepted $20,000 Loan
WASHINGTON — Sen. Alan Cranston acknowledged
Wednesday that two San Diego bankers arranged and
financed a $20,000 loan to staff and operate for 16 months
an unofficial community service office for him.
Cranston, D-Calif., a member of the Senate Banking
Committee, denied that any conflict of interest was
involved in the arrangement.
'The senator has never allowed this type of political
contribution or honorarium to influence his decision in any

way," said Cranston's administrative assistant, Roy
Greenaway.
'The senator makes up his mind on the merits of the
issue," he said. Cranston is seeking re-election this year.
Greenaway identified the two bankers as long-time
Cranston friends Robert Peterson and Richard Silberman,
two of 10 major stock holders in the Southern California
First National Bank of San Diego.
Greenaway said Cranston has known Peterson since
1963, when Peterson and Silberman were owners in the
California Jack in the Box restaurant chain.
Tutor Asked To Help FBI?
OAKLAND — A former prison tutor says two FBI
agents offered him $250,000 if he would help capture
Donald DeFreeze and other members of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) which kidnaped Patricia Hearst.
John Mayfield, who taught at the California Medical
Facility at Vacaville while DeFreeze was an inmate, said the
agents went to his apartment Tuesday morning with a
briefcase filled with $20 and $50 bills.
DeFreeze, who escaped from Vacaville last year, is
believed by authorities to be General Field Marshall Cinque,
a leader of the terrorist band that abducted Patricia on Feb.
4.
Charles Bates, special agent in charge of the FBI office in
San Francisco, declined to comment on Mayfield's
statements, except to say: 'The FBI handles its own
business. I'm not going into any details."
UJB. Output Moves Upward
WASHINGTON — The nation's industrial output rose in
April for the first time in five months, largely because of a
recovery in auto production, the government reported
yesterday.
The April increase of four-tenths of one percent showed
that the nation's business recovery may be on target with
government forecasts. Industrial output declined
three-tenths of one percent in March and six-tenths of one
percent in February.
The administration has predicted that the steep first
quarter slide in the country's economy would flatten out in
the second quarter and be followed by a resumption of
economic growth after mid-year.
Despite the April increase in production, the Federal
Reserve Board's industrial production index stood at 124.7,
which was still far below the high of 127.5 reached last
November before the impact of the Arab oil embargo.
Spinola Installed As President
LISBON, Portugal — Gen. Antonio de Spinola, head of
Portugal's military junta, was installed as president
yesterday and warned minorities against interfering with
plans for democracy in Africa or at home.
He said the future of Portuguese Africa, beset by revolt
for 13 years, would have to be decided democratically by
those who live there.
"They will have to be left complete freedom of decision,
and in Africa, as here, we will prevent in every way pressure
from minorities whoever they may be that could hinder the
free development of the democratic process," Spinola said.
He did not specify what minorities he meant. In Africa,
the whites are a minority. In the opinion of many
Portuguese, the black rebels are also minorities. In Portugal,
the junta has been trying to prevent left-wing minorities
from taking over important sections of government and
private business.
Today's Weather

Portugal's military junta, was installed as president
yesterday and warned minorities against interfering with
plans for democracy in Africa or at home.
He said the future of Portuguese Africa, beset by revolt
for 13 years, would have to be decided democratically by
those who live there.
"They will have to be left complete freedom of decision,
and in Africa, as here, we will prevent in every way pressure
from minorities whoever they may be that could hinder the
free development of the democratic process," Spinola said.
He did not specify what minorities he meant. In Africa,
the whites are a minority. In the opinion of many
Portuguese, the black rebels are also minorities. In Portugal,
the junta has been trying to prevent left-wing minorities
from taking over important sections of government and
private business.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but with patchy low
clouds nights and mornings. Lows both nights in the upper
40s to low 50s. Highs both days in the 60s except in the
50s along the coast. Small craft advisory for westerly winds
15 to 30 mph decreasing today.
Committee Seeks More Tapes
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee
voted 37 to 1 yesterday to subpoena 11 more Watergate
tapes President Nixon has refused to turn over to its
impeachment inquiry.
By top-heavy votes it also subpoenaed scheduling diaries
of Nixon's meetings and conversations during four periods,
and there were indications it would decide soon whether to
subpoena up to 66 more tapes dealing with non-Watergate
matters.
The committee members, meanwhile, got their first
chance yesterday to compare a tape already on hand with
the White House transcripts, and some found the recording
"more damaging" than the edited version.
One of two tapes heard by the panel was of a Sept. 15,
1972, meeting involving the President, H.R. Haldeman and
John W. Dean 111. A transcript of that conversation was
released last week by the President.
Kissinger Blasts Arab Attack
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
strongly condemned the Arab terrorist attack on an Israeli
school which killed 16 persons and wounded 17. Kissinger
vowed to continue his Middle East peace mission.
Kissinger canceled his scheduled flight to Damascus to
give the Israeli government time to respond to the terrorist
attack at Maalot in Northern Israel.
But he said he would resume his peace efforts today
with a flight to the Syrian capital to present Israel's latest
position on disengagement of forces on the Golan Heights
front. Kissinger said he still believed "both sides are moving
toward each other and not moving away."
The Israeli Cabinet was expected to meet before
Kissinger's departure to give him its views to pass on to
Syrian President Hafez Assad.
Kissinger issued a statement on the terrorist raid, saying
the United States condemned "this mindless and irrational
action" and "those who carry them out must be dealt with
severely."
Information Minister Shimon Peres thanked the
secretary for his statement but refused to link the attack
with the Kissinger mission.
Haig Testifies Before Committee
WASHINGTON — President Nixon reversed himself and
allowed his chief of staff to testify Wednesday before
Congress about the handling of a $100,000 contribution
from billionaire Howard Hughes.
Alexander M. Haig Jr.'s three-hour appearance before
the Senate Watergate committee followed warnings that an
earlier claim of executive privilege might be met with
contempt of Congress action by the panel.
The former four-star general told newsmen after the
closed session that "I answered all questions I was capable
of answering on that specific matter."
Chairman Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., and Sen. Lowell P.
Weicker, R-Conn., said Haig discussed the issue in detail,
beginning with accounts of White House conversations in
the spring of 1973, the time that Nixon's friend, C.G.
"Bebe" Rebozo, has said he returned the money intact to a
Hughes representative. Rebozo had received the money
four years ago.
Cranston Accepted $20,000 Loan
WASHINGTON — Sen. Alan Cranston acknowledged
Wednesday that two San Diego bankers arranged and
financed a $20,000 loan to staff and operate for 16 months
an unofficial community service office for him.
Cranston, D-Calif., a member of the Senate Banking
Committee, denied that any conflict of interest was
involved in the arrangement.
'The senator has never allowed this type of political
contribution or honorarium to influence his decision in any

way," said Cranston's administrative assistant, Roy
Greenaway.
'The senator makes up his mind on the merits of the
issue," he said. Cranston is seeking re-election this year.
Greenaway identified the two bankers as long-time
Cranston friends Robert Peterson and Richard Silberman,
two of 10 major stock holders in the Southern California
First National Bank of San Diego.
Greenaway said Cranston has known Peterson since
1963, when Peterson and Silberman were owners in the
California Jack in the Box restaurant chain.
Tutor Asked To Help FBI?
OAKLAND — A former prison tutor says two FBI
agents offered him $250,000 if he would help capture
Donald DeFreeze and other members of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) which kidnaped Patricia Hearst.
John Mayfield, who taught at the California Medical
Facility at Vacaville while DeFreeze was an inmate, said the
agents went to his apartment Tuesday morning with a
briefcase filled with $20 and $50 bills.
DeFreeze, who escaped from Vacaville last year, is
believed by authorities to be General Field Marshall Cinque,
a leader of the terrorist band that abducted Patricia on Feb.
4.
Charles Bates, special agent in charge of the FBI office in
San Francisco, declined to comment on Mayfield's
statements, except to say: 'The FBI handles its own
business. I'm not going into any details."
UJB. Output Moves Upward
WASHINGTON — The nation's industrial output rose in
April for the first time in five months, largely because of a
recovery in auto production, the government reported
yesterday.
The April increase of four-tenths of one percent showed
that the nation's business recovery may be on target with
government forecasts. Industrial output declined
three-tenths of one percent in March and six-tenths of one
percent in February.
The administration has predicted that the steep first
quarter slide in the country's economy would flatten out in
the second quarter and be followed by a resumption of
economic growth after mid-year.
Despite the April increase in production, the Federal
Reserve Board's industrial production index stood at 124.7,
which was still far below the high of 127.5 reached last
November before the impact of the Arab oil embargo.

UJB. Output Moves Upward
WASHINGTON — The nation's industrial output rose in
April for the first time in five months, largely because of a
recovery in auto production, the government reported
yesterday.
The April increase of four-tenths of one percent showed
that the nation's business recovery may be on target with
government forecasts. Industrial output declined
three-tenths of one percent in March and six-tenths of one
percent in February.
The administration has predicted that the steep first
quarter slide in the country's economy would flatten out in
the second quarter and be followed by a resumption of
economic growth after mid-year.
Despite the April increase in production, the Federal
Reserve Board's industrial production index stood at 124.7,
which was still far below the high of 127.5 reached last
November before the impact of the Arab oil embargo.
Spinola Installed As President
LISBON, Portugal — Gen. Antonio de Spinola, head of
Portugal's military junta, was installed as president
yesterday and warned minorities against interfering with
plans for democracy in Africa or at home.
He said the future of Portuguese Africa, beset by revolt
for 13 years, would have to be decided democratically by
those who live there.
"They will have to be left complete freedom of decision,
and in Africa, as here, we will prevent in every way pressure
from minorities whoever they may be that could hinder the
free development of the democratic process," Spinola said.
He did not specify what minorities he meant. In Africa,
the whites are a minority. In the opinion of many
Portuguese, the black rebels are also minorities. In Portugal,
the junta has been trying to prevent left-wing minorities
from taking over important sections of government and
private business.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but with patchy low
clouds nights and mornings. Lows both nights in the upper
40s to low 50s. Highs both days in the 60s except in the
50s along the coast. Small craft advisory for westerly winds
15 to 30 mph decreasing today.
Committee Seeks More Tapes
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee
voted 37 to 1 yesterday to subpoena 11 more Watergate
tapes President Nixon has refused to turn over to its
impeachment inquiry.
By top-heavy votes it also subpoenaed scheduling diaries
of Nixon's meetings and conversations during four periods,
and there were indications it would decide soon whether to
subpoena up to 66 more tapes dealing with non-Watergate
matters.
The committee members, meanwhile, got their first
chance yesterday to compare a tape already on hand with
the White House transcripts, and some found the recording
"more damaging" than the edited version.
One of two tapes heard by the panel was of a Sept. 15,
1972, meeting involving the President, H.R. Haldeman and
John W. Dean 111. A transcript of that conversation was
released last week by the President.
Kissinger Blasts Arab Attack
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
strongly condemned the Arab terrorist attack on an Israeli
school which killed 16 persons and wounded 17. Kissinger
vowed to continue his Middle East peace mission.
Kissinger canceled his scheduled flight to Damascus to
give the Israeli government time to respond to the terrorist
attack at Maalot in Northern Israel.
But he said he would resume his peace efforts today
with a flight to the Syrian capital to present Israel's latest
position on disengagement of forces on the Golan Heights
front. Kissinger said he still believed "both sides are moving
toward each other and not moving away."
The Israeli Cabinet was expected to meet before
Kissinger's departure to give him its views to pass on to
Syrian President Hafez Assad.
Kissinger issued a statement on the terrorist raid, saying
the United States condemned "this mindless and irrational
action" and "those who carry them out must be dealt with
severely."
Information Minister Shimon Peres thanked the
secretary for his statement but refused to link the attack
with the Kissinger mission.
Haig Testifies Before Committee
WASHINGTON — President Nixon reversed himself and
allowed his chief of staff to testify Wednesday before
Congress about the handling of a $100,000 contribution
from billionaire Howard Hughes.
Alexander M. Haig Jr.'s three-hour appearance before
the Senate Watergate committee followed warnings that an
earlier claim of executive privilege might be met with
contempt of Congress action by the panel.
The former four-star general told newsmen after the
closed session that "I answered all questions I was capable
of answering on that specific matter."
Chairman Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., and Sen. Lowell P.
Weicker, R-Conn., said Haig discussed the issue in detail,
beginning with accounts of White House conversations in
the spring of 1973, the time that Nixon's friend, C.G.
"Bebe" Rebozo, has said he returned the money intact to a
Hughes representative. Rebozo had received the money
four years ago.
Cranston Accepted $20,000 Loan
WASHINGTON — Sen. Alan Cranston acknowledged
Wednesday that two San Diego bankers arranged and
financed a $20,000 loan to staff and operate for 16 months
an unofficial community service office for him.
Cranston, D-Calif., a member of the Senate Banking
Committee, denied that any conflict of interest was
involved in the arrangement.
'The senator has never allowed this type of political
contribution or honorarium to influence his decision in any

way," said Cranston's administrative assistant, Roy
Greenaway.
'The senator makes up his mind on the merits of the
issue," he said. Cranston is seeking re-election this year.
Greenaway identified the two bankers as long-time
Cranston friends Robert Peterson and Richard Silberman,
two of 10 major stock holders in the Southern California
First National Bank of San Diego.
Greenaway said Cranston has known Peterson since
1963, when Peterson and Silberman were owners in the
California Jack in the Box restaurant chain.
Tutor Asked To Help FBI?
OAKLAND — A former prison tutor says two FBI
agents offered him $250,000 if he would help capture
Donald DeFreeze and other members of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) which kidnaped Patricia Hearst.
John Mayfield, who taught at the California Medical
Facility at Vacaville while DeFreeze was an inmate, said the
agents went to his apartment Tuesday morning with a
briefcase filled with $20 and $50 bills.
DeFreeze, who escaped from Vacaville last year, is
believed by authorities to be General Field Marshall Cinque,
a leader of the terrorist band that abducted Patricia on Feb.
4.
Charles Bates, special agent in charge of the FBI office in
San Francisco, declined to comment on Mayfield's
statements, except to say: 'The FBI handles its own
