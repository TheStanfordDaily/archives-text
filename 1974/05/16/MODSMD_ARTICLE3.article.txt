# Concentrated Economic Power
## Harris Outlines Country's Ills 
### KEVIN SMITH 
"I am a Populist," former Sen. Fred Harris, D-Okla.,
described himself last night. "By that, it's meant that there
ought not be that terrible concentration of income and
wealth and power which controls the government."
Harris, who was chairman of the Democratic National
Committee in 1969 and 1970, made his remarks before a
gathering of 75 people in Bishop Auditorium while
appearing at a panel discussion entitled "The Future of the
American Left." His wife LaDonna, former ASSU Vice
President Brent Appel and Stanford graduate Jeff Hansen
rounded out the panel.
The goal of our country, Harris said, should be the "fair
distribution of wealth and income and power."
However, "One of the problems is that it is an implied
goal and not a stated goal," he "Maldistribution of
wealth is far worse now than ever before."

Harris blamed the continuation of poverty on this
country's failure to attack the core of the problem. 'The
notion persists that if we just give the poor advice, they'll
quit" being poor, he said. "What the poor need is money."
Lashing out at the country's major corporations, Harris
said that "economic growth in this country is corporate
growth."
He charged that income in this country was redistributed
"out of the pockets of poor people into the pockets of
those wealthy corporations."
Harris said the "main lesson of Watergate" was the
revelation that corporations had so much "concentrated
economic power." The corporations which contributed to
President Nixon's re-election campaign were so wealthy
"they were carrying it around in grocery bags," Harris said.
Corruption
Such concentrated economic power, he said, breeds the
kind of corruption found in the Nixon Administration. The
corporate leaders "didn't put up that money because their
high school civics lessons told them everybody ought to get
involved in government," he said. 'They wanted something
out of it."
But Harris said optimistically that he thinks "there's a
chance we can put America together again" by stressing
economic issues "across race and class lines."
"Whatever has historically held down the redneck," he
said, "is very close to the same thing that's holding down
the black person."
Renaissance
Mrs. Harris, member of the Comanche Tribe and
chairwoman of Americans for Indian Opportunity, opened
the program by praising the Indian movement. "What's
happening there is the new self-image: I call it the Indian
Renaissance," she said. "Indian people have changed their
attitude about themselves."
Mrs. Harris blamed liberal activists for doing "things to
people rather than with people .... The old do-gooder
concept will no longer be tolerated within the Indian
community," she said.
