# USE's Berk Arrested At Construction Site
## Union President Berk Arrested 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
President Jim Berk was arrested
yesterday morning as the union
intensified its efforts to block
construction at Stanford Hospital.
' Otherwise, the third day of the
strike passed much as did the first two,
with 950 workers staying away from
their jobs, according to University
estimates.
The two sides are scheduled to
negotiate at 9:30 a.m. today at an
undisclosed off-campus location. This
will be the first bargaining session
since the strike began Monday.
Berk was arrested after blocking the
entrance of two mobile cranes which
attempted to enter the reserved gate of
the hospital's construction site. Berk
sat in front of the lead vehicle's wheels
and refused to move.
Berk Arrest
Sgt. Jack Garner of the Palo Alto
Police Department arrested Berk, who
was led away quietly, without
handcuffs. He was taken to the police
station and cited for violating section
647 c of California Penal Code,
blocking a public thoroughfare, which
is a misdemeanor.
Berk was released almost
immediately, and returned to the site
an hour later.
After Berk's arrest, another woman,
who would not identify herself, took
his place in front of the crane's wheels.
She was not arrested.
The crane backed away. Eventually,
both vehicles left the site, which was
picketed by up to 60 people. About
half the picketers were workers, most
of the others were students.
Next Confrontation
The next confrontation occurred
when a flatbed steel truck pulled up to
the site. The picketers used their
placards to obstruct the driver's view
and forced him to turn around,
whereupon he attempted to back into
the site. Several picketers stationed
themselves under the wheels, stopping
the truck.
After some discussion, the truck
left.
Striking workers then held up a
cement truck. USE hardship
committee chairwoman Julia Harvey
and negotiating team member Linda
Crouse lay beneath the wheels of this
truck.

After a phone call, the cement truck
driver determined that his correct
destination was not the med center,
but the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, which is undertaking
construction on Panama Street west of
the women's gymnasium, on Stanford
land.
Some of the picketers immediately
piled into cars, rushing over to block
the entrance to the Carnegie
construction site.
A foreman directed the driver to
enter the site, but was stopped by a
dozen picketers who attempted to
push the truck back into the street.
Berk, rushing over to the scene,
attempted to make a deal with the
foreman; the truck would be allowed
to enter and drop its rapidly-hardening
load of cement if further work was
halted. The foreman refused.
Truck Finally Enters
Eventually, Berk conferred privately
with Stanford Police Chief Marv
Herrington. Berk then allowed the
truck to enter, just minutes before the
$300 load of cement would have
dried.
Berk explained the contractor was

hired by the Carnegie Institution and
that the project's connection with the
University was unclear, so he let the
truck pass.
Berk called the day's efforts "a
major victory," and said that the
union's next target might be the
houses of unnamed University
administrators.
Anderson Vows
Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) organizer Bob Anderson
vowed to keep pickets at the
construction site until forced to stop
by court order. USE is local 680 of
SEIU, and Anderson has assumed
command of the strike from Berk,
who will be in charge of negotiations.
According to Anderson, "whatever
you saw today, you'll see tomorrow."
Picketing at the hospital complex will
continue 24 hours a day, he said.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger issued a
memo saying "It is regrettable that
some members of United Stanford
Employees have chosen to violate the
law by making it very difficult for
construction workers, not involved in
