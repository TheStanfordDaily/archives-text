# USE's Berk Arrested At Construction Site
## Union President Berk Arrested 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
President Jim Berk was arrested
yesterday morning as the union
intensified its efforts to block
construction at Stanford Hospital.
' Otherwise, the third day of the
strike passed much as did the first two,
with 950 workers staying away from
their jobs, according to University
estimates.
The two sides are scheduled to
negotiate at 9:30 a.m. today at an
undisclosed off-campus location. This
will be the first bargaining session
since the strike began Monday.
Berk was arrested after blocking the
entrance of two mobile cranes which
attempted to enter the reserved gate of
the hospital's construction site. Berk
sat in front of the lead vehicle's wheels
and refused to move.
Berk Arrest
Sgt. Jack Garner of the Palo Alto
Police Department arrested Berk, who
was led away quietly, without
handcuffs. He was taken to the police
station and cited for violating section
647 c of California Penal Code,
blocking a public thoroughfare, which
is a misdemeanor.
Berk was released almost
immediately, and returned to the site
an hour later.
After Berk's arrest, another woman,
who would not identify herself, took
his place in front of the crane's wheels.
She was not arrested.
The crane backed away. Eventually,
both vehicles left the site, which was
picketed by up to 60 people. About
half the picketers were workers, most
of the others were students.
Next Confrontation
The next confrontation occurred
when a flatbed steel truck pulled up to
the site. The picketers used their
placards to obstruct the driver's view
and forced him to turn around,
whereupon he attempted to back into
the site. Several picketers stationed
themselves under the wheels, stopping
the truck.
After some discussion, the truck
left.
Striking workers then held up a
cement truck. USE hardship
committee chairwoman Julia Harvey
and negotiating team member Linda
Crouse lay beneath the wheels of this
truck.

After a phone call, the cement truck
driver determined that his correct
destination was not the med center,
but the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, which is undertaking
construction on Panama Street west of
the women's gymnasium, on Stanford
land.
Some of the picketers immediately
piled into cars, rushing over to block
the entrance to the Carnegie
construction site.
A foreman directed the driver to
enter the site, but was stopped by a
dozen picketers who attempted to
push the truck back into the street.
Berk, rushing over to the scene,
attempted to make a deal with the
foreman; the truck would be allowed
to enter and drop its rapidly-hardening
load of cement if further work was
halted. The foreman refused.
Truck Finally Enters
Eventually, Berk conferred privately
with Stanford Police Chief Marv
Herrington. Berk then allowed the
truck to enter, just minutes before the
$300 load of cement would have
dried.
Berk explained the contractor was

hired by the Carnegie Institution and
that the project's connection with the
University was unclear, so he let the
truck pass.
Berk called the day's efforts "a
major victory," and said that the
union's next target might be the
houses of unnamed University
administrators.
Anderson Vows
Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) organizer Bob Anderson
vowed to keep pickets at the
construction site until forced to stop
by court order. USE is local 680 of
SEIU, and Anderson has assumed
command of the strike from Berk,
who will be in charge of negotiations.
According to Anderson, "whatever
you saw today, you'll see tomorrow."
Picketing at the hospital complex will
continue 24 hours a day, he said.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger issued a
memo saying "It is regrettable that
some members of United Stanford
Employees have chosen to violate the
law by making it very difficult for
construction workers, not involved in
the strike, to gain access through the
reserved gate to the hospital
construction site."
The University may seek injunctions
against USE to restrain disorderly
picketing or conducting a secondary
boycott, or both.
'Illegal' Picketing
University chief negotiator Doug
Barton defined illegal picketing as
"amassing individuals in such a way as
to make access to the premises
physically impossible."
The University would seek a
temporary restraining order against
physical blocking, from a Santa Clara
County Superior Court. A restraining
order may not take more than a few
hours to get, Barton said.
The University is also considering
filing charges with the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) in San
Francisco to stop secondary
boycotting.
A secondary boycott is one directed
at stopping picketing of an employer
other than the one being struck (in
this case, the University). Construction
workers, according to the University's
contention, would be considered
employees of the contractor, not the
University.
USE claims its picketing does not
represent a secondary boycott,
because the construction inspectors
who it says must be present at the site
are University employees legally on
strike.
Only the NLRB can file secondary
boycott charges. Barton believes it
would take the NLRB several days
after a University request to decide
whether or not to do so, and it would
take even longer for a U.S. District
Court to decide whether or not to
issue an injunction.
According to Barton "the
University is doing preliminary work"
on the injunctions, and will "take a
look at the situation [today] and
make a decision" whether to take
court action on either charge.
USE's action to stop drivers from
entering construction sites is necessary
because Teamsters Joint Council No. 7
has not sanctioned the USE strike.
According to Rudy Tham,
secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local
856, the council voted 7-0 yesterday
afternoon to table indefinitely a

sanction motion.
Tham said Teamsters sanction was
withheld because "their [USE's]
demands are ridiculous." Teamsters
drivers may use their own judgment
whether or not to cross a USE picket
line, he said.
Berk said most Teamsters drivers
were not crossing the lines. He said,
"Everybody in the whole blasted
[Teamsters] world" except Rudy
Tham is supporting the strike, and that
only Tham's personal "power play"
had blocked the sanction. He added
that all Teamsters locals delivering to
Stanford had sanctioned the strike.
Tham and Berk feuded two years
ago when both unions were trying to
organize the bargaining unit that USE
now represents.
In other strike-related news
yesterday, Peter Carpenter, Med
School vice president for medical
affairs, said the linen shortage caused
by the USE strike had been solved.
'More Linen'
"We have more linen in the med
center than ever before," he said. "We
were smarter than the union. They
challenged us to come up with
alternate supplies and we did."
Assistant Med Center information
officer Gary Cavalli noted that other
Med Center officials were not as
optimistic as Carpenter. He said, "we
are getting [the linen] through, but
it's quite a struggle."
According to Cavalli, nurses are
cutting back in some areas and other
employees are taking their uniforms
home for washing.
USE has refused to tell linen truck
drivers that they may cross the picket
lines, claiming linen is not essential.
(Yesterday, the Daily incorrectly
reported that USE picketed Valley
West Hospital in Los Gatos. The actual
location of picketing, and of some of
the University's linen supplies, was
Valley Medical Center in San Jose.)
While little construction work took
place at the med school (only
ironworkers were at the scene,
according to Anderson), construction
resumed despite USE pickets next to
the steam plant, where a cooling unit

is being built.
At the law school site, construction
work continued on a reduced scale.
About 10 workers were reported
inside the building.
At the steam plant itself, picketers
reported that the University was
having trouble repairing three leaks in
condensate pipes on Campus Drive.
According to the picketers, the leaks
are costing the University a great deal
of money on water to replace that lost
in the leaks, chemicals to treat the
water and man-hours.
Steam Plant
Inside the steam plant, supervisor
Bob McKnight said that all leaks
would be repaired by tomorrow and
that operations were proceeding
smoothly. The picketers scoffed at this
statement.
Strike operations director Dan
DeYoung said "things are going quite
normally at the steam plant," as well
as across campus generally.
He did note that one toilet was
stopped up "obviously maliciously"
yesterday at News and Publications in
Encina Hall.
Sulfur Stench
DeYoung did not know of an
overpowering sulfur smell in Memorial
Auditorium which drove many
students out of Human Sexuality class.
He theorized it might have been
caused by a sewer backup, which he
said occurs periodically.
University Food Service operations
continued as on Tuesday, with Stern
and Wilbur reporting below-normal
counts of students served.
Tresidder Food Service is not being
struck, as its employees are not
University employees. The workers
were scheduled to vote on whether to
join the union today, but TDS, Inc.,
which employs the workers,
challenged the eligibility of persons on
the voting list. The NLRB postponed
the election indefinitely while it
examines the challenge.
Other reporters working on this
story were Don Cox, John Freed, Rich
Jaroslovsky, Bruce Kadden, Glenn
Kramon, Mark Simonian, David
Thiemann and Stan Wilson.

Union (SEIU) organizer Bob Anderson
vowed to keep pickets at the
construction site until forced to stop
by court order. USE is local 680 of
SEIU, and Anderson has assumed
command of the strike from Berk,
who will be in charge of negotiations.
According to Anderson, "whatever
you saw today, you'll see tomorrow."
Picketing at the hospital complex will
continue 24 hours a day, he said.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger issued a
memo saying "It is regrettable that
some members of United Stanford
Employees have chosen to violate the
law by making it very difficult for
construction workers, not involved in
the strike, to gain access through the
reserved gate to the hospital
construction site."
The University may seek injunctions
against USE to restrain disorderly
picketing or conducting a secondary
boycott, or both.
'Illegal' Picketing
University chief negotiator Doug
Barton defined illegal picketing as
"amassing individuals in such a way as
to make access to the premises
physically impossible."
The University would seek a
temporary restraining order against
physical blocking, from a Santa Clara
County Superior Court. A restraining
order may not take more than a few
hours to get, Barton said.
The University is also considering
filing charges with the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) in San
Francisco to stop secondary
boycotting.
A secondary boycott is one directed
at stopping picketing of an employer
other than the one being struck (in
this case, the University). Construction
workers, according to the University's
contention, would be considered
employees of the contractor, not the
University.
USE claims its picketing does not
represent a secondary boycott,
because the construction inspectors
who it says must be present at the site
are University employees legally on
strike.
Only the NLRB can file secondary
boycott charges. Barton believes it
would take the NLRB several days
after a University request to decide
whether or not to do so, and it would
take even longer for a U.S. District
Court to decide whether or not to
issue an injunction.
According to Barton "the
University is doing preliminary work"
on the injunctions, and will "take a
look at the situation [today] and
make a decision" whether to take
court action on either charge.
USE's action to stop drivers from
entering construction sites is necessary
because Teamsters Joint Council No. 7
has not sanctioned the USE strike.
According to Rudy Tham,
secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local
856, the council voted 7-0 yesterday
afternoon to table indefinitely a

sanction motion.
Tham said Teamsters sanction was
withheld because "their [USE's]
demands are ridiculous." Teamsters
drivers may use their own judgment
whether or not to cross a USE picket
line, he said.
Berk said most Teamsters drivers
were not crossing the lines. He said,
"Everybody in the whole blasted
[Teamsters] world" except Rudy
Tham is supporting the strike, and that
only Tham's personal "power play"
had blocked the sanction. He added
that all Teamsters locals delivering to
Stanford had sanctioned the strike.
Tham and Berk feuded two years
ago when both unions were trying to
organize the bargaining unit that USE
now represents.
In other strike-related news
yesterday, Peter Carpenter, Med
School vice president for medical
affairs, said the linen shortage caused
by the USE strike had been solved.
'More Linen'
"We have more linen in the med
center than ever before," he said. "We
were smarter than the union. They
challenged us to come up with
alternate supplies and we did."
Assistant Med Center information
officer Gary Cavalli noted that other
Med Center officials were not as
optimistic as Carpenter. He said, "we
are getting [the linen] through, but
it's quite a struggle."
According to Cavalli, nurses are
cutting back in some areas and other
employees are taking their uniforms
home for washing.
USE has refused to tell linen truck
drivers that they may cross the picket
lines, claiming linen is not essential.
(Yesterday, the Daily incorrectly
reported that USE picketed Valley
West Hospital in Los Gatos. The actual
location of picketing, and of some of
the University's linen supplies, was
Valley Medical Center in San Jose.)
While little construction work took
place at the med school (only
ironworkers were at the scene,
according to Anderson), construction
resumed despite USE pickets next to
the steam plant, where a cooling unit

is being built.
At the law school site, construction
work continued on a reduced scale.
About 10 workers were reported
inside the building.
At the steam plant itself, picketers
reported that the University was
having trouble repairing three leaks in
condensate pipes on Campus Drive.
According to the picketers, the leaks
are costing the University a great deal
of money on water to replace that lost
in the leaks, chemicals to treat the
water and man-hours.
Steam Plant
Inside the steam plant, supervisor
Bob McKnight said that all leaks
would be repaired by tomorrow and
that operations were proceeding
smoothly. The picketers scoffed at this
statement.
Strike operations director Dan
DeYoung said "things are going quite
normally at the steam plant," as well
as across campus generally.
He did note that one toilet was
stopped up "obviously maliciously"
yesterday at News and Publications in
Encina Hall.
Sulfur Stench
DeYoung did not know of an
overpowering sulfur smell in Memorial
Auditorium which drove many
students out of Human Sexuality class.
He theorized it might have been
caused by a sewer backup, which he
said occurs periodically.
University Food Service operations
continued as on Tuesday, with Stern
and Wilbur reporting below-normal
counts of students served.
Tresidder Food Service is not being
struck, as its employees are not
University employees. The workers
were scheduled to vote on whether to
join the union today, but TDS, Inc.,
which employs the workers,
challenged the eligibility of persons on
the voting list. The NLRB postponed
the election indefinitely while it
examines the challenge.
Other reporters working on this
story were Don Cox, John Freed, Rich
Jaroslovsky, Bruce Kadden, Glenn
Kramon, Mark Simonian, David
Thiemann and Stan Wilson.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
President Jim Berk was arrested
yesterday morning as the union
intensified its efforts to block
construction at Stanford Hospital.
' Otherwise, the third day of the
strike passed much as did the first two,
with 950 workers staying away from
their jobs, according to University
estimates.
The two sides are scheduled to
negotiate at 9:30 a.m. today at an
undisclosed off-campus location. This
will be the first bargaining session
since the strike began Monday.
Berk was arrested after blocking the
entrance of two mobile cranes which
attempted to enter the reserved gate of
the hospital's construction site. Berk
sat in front of the lead vehicle's wheels
and refused to move.
Berk Arrest
Sgt. Jack Garner of the Palo Alto
Police Department arrested Berk, who
was led away quietly, without
handcuffs. He was taken to the police
station and cited for violating section
647 c of California Penal Code,
blocking a public thoroughfare, which
is a misdemeanor.
Berk was released almost
immediately, and returned to the site
an hour later.
After Berk's arrest, another woman,
who would not identify herself, took
his place in front of the crane's wheels.
She was not arrested.
The crane backed away. Eventually,
both vehicles left the site, which was
picketed by up to 60 people. About
half the picketers were workers, most
of the others were students.
Next Confrontation
The next confrontation occurred
when a flatbed steel truck pulled up to
the site. The picketers used their
placards to obstruct the driver's view
and forced him to turn around,
whereupon he attempted to back into
the site. Several picketers stationed
themselves under the wheels, stopping
the truck.
After some discussion, the truck
left.
Striking workers then held up a
cement truck. USE hardship
committee chairwoman Julia Harvey
and negotiating team member Linda
Crouse lay beneath the wheels of this
truck.

After a phone call, the cement truck
driver determined that his correct
destination was not the med center,
but the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, which is undertaking
construction on Panama Street west of
the women's gymnasium, on Stanford
land.
Some of the picketers immediately
piled into cars, rushing over to block
the entrance to the Carnegie
construction site.
A foreman directed the driver to
enter the site, but was stopped by a
dozen picketers who attempted to
push the truck back into the street.
Berk, rushing over to the scene,
attempted to make a deal with the
foreman; the truck would be allowed
to enter and drop its rapidly-hardening
load of cement if further work was
halted. The foreman refused.
Truck Finally Enters
Eventually, Berk conferred privately
with Stanford Police Chief Marv
Herrington. Berk then allowed the
truck to enter, just minutes before the
$300 load of cement would have
dried.
Berk explained the contractor was

hired by the Carnegie Institution and
that the project's connection with the
University was unclear, so he let the
truck pass.
Berk called the day's efforts "a
major victory," and said that the
union's next target might be the
houses of unnamed University
administrators.

School vice president for medical
affairs, said the linen shortage caused
by the USE strike had been solved.
'More Linen'
"We have more linen in the med
center than ever before," he said. "We
were smarter than the union. They
challenged us to come up with
alternate supplies and we did."
Assistant Med Center information
officer Gary Cavalli noted that other
Med Center officials were not as
optimistic as Carpenter. He said, "we
are getting [the linen] through, but
it's quite a struggle."
According to Cavalli, nurses are
cutting back in some areas and other
employees are taking their uniforms
home for washing.
USE has refused to tell linen truck
drivers that they may cross the picket
lines, claiming linen is not essential.
(Yesterday, the Daily incorrectly
reported that USE picketed Valley
West Hospital in Los Gatos. The actual
location of picketing, and of some of
the University's linen supplies, was
Valley Medical Center in San Jose.)
While little construction work took
place at the med school (only
ironworkers were at the scene,
according to Anderson), construction
resumed despite USE pickets next to
the steam plant, where a cooling unit

is being built.
At the law school site, construction
work continued on a reduced scale.
About 10 workers were reported
inside the building.
At the steam plant itself, picketers
reported that the University was
having trouble repairing three leaks in
condensate pipes on Campus Drive.
According to the picketers, the leaks
are costing the University a great deal
of money on water to replace that lost
in the leaks, chemicals to treat the
water and man-hours.
Steam Plant
Inside the steam plant, supervisor
Bob McKnight said that all leaks
would be repaired by tomorrow and
that operations were proceeding
smoothly. The picketers scoffed at this
statement.
Strike operations director Dan
DeYoung said "things are going quite
normally at the steam plant," as well
as across campus generally.
He did note that one toilet was
stopped up "obviously maliciously"
yesterday at News and Publications in
Encina Hall.
Sulfur Stench
DeYoung did not know of an
overpowering sulfur smell in Memorial
Auditorium which drove many
students out of Human Sexuality class.
He theorized it might have been
caused by a sewer backup, which he
said occurs periodically.
University Food Service operations
continued as on Tuesday, with Stern
and Wilbur reporting below-normal
counts of students served.
Tresidder Food Service is not being
struck, as its employees are not
University employees. The workers
were scheduled to vote on whether to
join the union today, but TDS, Inc.,
which employs the workers,
challenged the eligibility of persons on
the voting list. The NLRB postponed
the election indefinitely while it
examines the challenge.

story were Don Cox, John Freed, Rich
Jaroslovsky, Bruce Kadden, Glenn

United Stanford Employees (USE)
President Jim Berk was arrested
yesterday morning as the union
intensified its efforts to block
construction at Stanford Hospital.
' Otherwise, the third day of the
strike passed much as did the first two,
with 950 workers staying away from
their jobs, according to University
estimates.
The two sides are scheduled to
negotiate at 9:30 a.m. today at an
undisclosed off-campus location. This
will be the first bargaining session
since the strike began Monday.
Berk was arrested after blocking the
entrance of two mobile cranes which
attempted to enter the reserved gate of
the hospital's construction site. Berk
sat in front of the lead vehicle's wheels
and refused to move.
Berk Arrest
Sgt. Jack Garner of the Palo Alto
Police Department arrested Berk, who
was led away quietly, without
handcuffs. He was taken to the police
station and cited for violating section
647 c of California Penal Code,
blocking a public thoroughfare, which
is a misdemeanor.
Berk was released almost
immediately, and returned to the site
an hour later.
After Berk's arrest, another woman,
who would not identify herself, took
his place in front of the crane's wheels.
She was not arrested.
The crane backed away. Eventually,
both vehicles left the site, which was
picketed by up to 60 people. About
half the picketers were workers, most
of the others were students.
Next Confrontation
The next confrontation occurred
when a flatbed steel truck pulled up to
the site. The picketers used their
placards to obstruct the driver's view
and forced him to turn around,
whereupon he attempted to back into
the site. Several picketers stationed
themselves under the wheels, stopping
the truck.
After some discussion, the truck
left.
Striking workers then held up a
cement truck. USE hardship
committee chairwoman Julia Harvey
and negotiating team member Linda
Crouse lay beneath the wheels of this
truck.

After a phone call, the cement truck
driver determined that his correct
destination was not the med center,
but the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, which is undertaking
construction on Panama Street west of
the women's gymnasium, on Stanford
land.
Some of the picketers immediately
piled into cars, rushing over to block
the entrance to the Carnegie
construction site.
A foreman directed the driver to
enter the site, but was stopped by a
dozen picketers who attempted to
push the truck back into the street.
Berk, rushing over to the scene,
attempted to make a deal with the
foreman; the truck would be allowed
to enter and drop its rapidly-hardening
load of cement if further work was
halted. The foreman refused.
Truck Finally Enters
Eventually, Berk conferred privately
with Stanford Police Chief Marv
Herrington. Berk then allowed the
truck to enter, just minutes before the
$300 load of cement would have
dried.
Berk explained the contractor was

hired by the Carnegie Institution and
that the project's connection with the
University was unclear, so he let the
truck pass.
Berk called the day's efforts "a
major victory," and said that the
union's next target might be the
houses of unnamed University
administrators.
Anderson Vows
Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) organizer Bob Anderson
vowed to keep pickets at the
construction site until forced to stop
by court order. USE is local 680 of
SEIU, and Anderson has assumed
command of the strike from Berk,
who will be in charge of negotiations.
According to Anderson, "whatever
you saw today, you'll see tomorrow."
Picketing at the hospital complex will
continue 24 hours a day, he said.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger issued a
memo saying "It is regrettable that
some members of United Stanford
Employees have chosen to violate the
law by making it very difficult for
construction workers, not involved in
the strike, to gain access through the
reserved gate to the hospital
construction site."
The University may seek injunctions
against USE to restrain disorderly
picketing or conducting a secondary
boycott, or both.
'Illegal' Picketing
University chief negotiator Doug
Barton defined illegal picketing as
"amassing individuals in such a way as
to make access to the premises
physically impossible."
The University would seek a
temporary restraining order against
physical blocking, from a Santa Clara
County Superior Court. A restraining
order may not take more than a few
hours to get, Barton said.
The University is also considering
filing charges with the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) in San
Francisco to stop secondary
boycotting.
A secondary boycott is one directed
at stopping picketing of an employer
other than the one being struck (in
this case, the University). Construction
workers, according to the University's
contention, would be considered
employees of the contractor, not the
University.
USE claims its picketing does not
represent a secondary boycott,
because the construction inspectors
who it says must be present at the site
are University employees legally on
strike.
Only the NLRB can file secondary
boycott charges. Barton believes it
would take the NLRB several days
after a University request to decide
whether or not to do so, and it would
take even longer for a U.S. District
Court to decide whether or not to
issue an injunction.
According to Barton "the
University is doing preliminary work"
on the injunctions, and will "take a
look at the situation [today] and
make a decision" whether to take
court action on either charge.
USE's action to stop drivers from
entering construction sites is necessary
because Teamsters Joint Council No. 7
has not sanctioned the USE strike.
According to Rudy Tham,
secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local
856, the council voted 7-0 yesterday
afternoon to table indefinitely a

sanction motion.
Tham said Teamsters sanction was
withheld because "their [USE's]
demands are ridiculous." Teamsters
drivers may use their own judgment
whether or not to cross a USE picket
line, he said.
Berk said most Teamsters drivers
were not crossing the lines. He said,
"Everybody in the whole blasted
[Teamsters] world" except Rudy
Tham is supporting the strike, and that
only Tham's personal "power play"
had blocked the sanction. He added
that all Teamsters locals delivering to
Stanford had sanctioned the strike.
Tham and Berk feuded two years
ago when both unions were trying to
organize the bargaining unit that USE
now represents.

negotiate at 9:30 a.m. today at an
undisclosed off-campus location. This
will be the first bargaining session
since the strike began Monday.
Berk was arrested after blocking the
entrance of two mobile cranes which
attempted to enter the reserved gate of
the hospital's construction site. Berk
sat in front of the lead vehicle's wheels
and refused to move.
Berk Arrest
Sgt. Jack Garner of the Palo Alto
Police Department arrested Berk, who
was led away quietly, without
handcuffs. He was taken to the police
station and cited for violating section
647 c of California Penal Code,
blocking a public thoroughfare, which
is a misdemeanor.
Berk was released almost
immediately, and returned to the site
an hour later.
After Berk's arrest, another woman,
who would not identify herself, took
his place in front of the crane's wheels.
She was not arrested.
The crane backed away. Eventually,
both vehicles left the site, which was
picketed by up to 60 people. About
half the picketers were workers, most
of the others were students.
Next Confrontation
The next confrontation occurred
when a flatbed steel truck pulled up to
the site. The picketers used their
placards to obstruct the driver's view
and forced him to turn around,
whereupon he attempted to back into
the site. Several picketers stationed
themselves under the wheels, stopping
the truck.
After some discussion, the truck
left.
Striking workers then held up a
cement truck. USE hardship
committee chairwoman Julia Harvey
and negotiating team member Linda
Crouse lay beneath the wheels of this
truck.

After a phone call, the cement truck
driver determined that his correct
destination was not the med center,
but the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, which is undertaking
construction on Panama Street west of
the women's gymnasium, on Stanford
land.
Some of the picketers immediately
piled into cars, rushing over to block
the entrance to the Carnegie
construction site.
A foreman directed the driver to
enter the site, but was stopped by a
dozen picketers who attempted to
push the truck back into the street.
Berk, rushing over to the scene,
attempted to make a deal with the
foreman; the truck would be allowed
to enter and drop its rapidly-hardening
load of cement if further work was
halted. The foreman refused.
Truck Finally Enters
Eventually, Berk conferred privately
with Stanford Police Chief Marv
Herrington. Berk then allowed the
truck to enter, just minutes before the
$300 load of cement would have
dried.
Berk explained the contractor was

hired by the Carnegie Institution and
that the project's connection with the
University was unclear, so he let the
truck pass.
Berk called the day's efforts "a
major victory," and said that the
union's next target might be the
houses of unnamed University
administrators.
Anderson Vows
Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) organizer Bob Anderson
vowed to keep pickets at the
construction site until forced to stop
by court order. USE is local 680 of
SEIU, and Anderson has assumed
command of the strike from Berk,
who will be in charge of negotiations.
According to Anderson, "whatever
you saw today, you'll see tomorrow."
Picketing at the hospital complex will
continue 24 hours a day, he said.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger issued a
memo saying "It is regrettable that
some members of United Stanford
Employees have chosen to violate the
law by making it very difficult for
construction workers, not involved in
the strike, to gain access through the
reserved gate to the hospital
construction site."
The University may seek injunctions
against USE to restrain disorderly
picketing or conducting a secondary
boycott, or both.
'Illegal' Picketing
University chief negotiator Doug
Barton defined illegal picketing as
"amassing individuals in such a way as
to make access to the premises
physically impossible."
The University would seek a
temporary restraining order against
physical blocking, from a Santa Clara
County Superior Court. A restraining
order may not take more than a few
hours to get, Barton said.
The University is also considering
filing charges with the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) in San
Francisco to stop secondary
boycotting.
A secondary boycott is one directed
at stopping picketing of an employer
other than the one being struck (in
this case, the University). Construction
workers, according to the University's
contention, would be considered
employees of the contractor, not the
University.
USE claims its picketing does not
represent a secondary boycott,
because the construction inspectors
who it says must be present at the site
are University employees legally on
strike.
Only the NLRB can file secondary
boycott charges. Barton believes it
would take the NLRB several days
after a University request to decide
whether or not to do so, and it would
take even longer for a U.S. District
Court to decide whether or not to
issue an injunction.
According to Barton "the
University is doing preliminary work"
on the injunctions, and will "take a
look at the situation [today] and
make a decision" whether to take
court action on either charge.
USE's action to stop drivers from
entering construction sites is necessary
because Teamsters Joint Council No. 7
has not sanctioned the USE strike.
According to Rudy Tham,
secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local
856, the council voted 7-0 yesterday
afternoon to table indefinitely a

sanction motion.
Tham said Teamsters sanction was
withheld because "their [USE's]
demands are ridiculous." Teamsters
drivers may use their own judgment
whether or not to cross a USE picket
line, he said.
Berk said most Teamsters drivers
were not crossing the lines. He said,
"Everybody in the whole blasted
[Teamsters] world" except Rudy
Tham is supporting the strike, and that
only Tham's personal "power play"
had blocked the sanction. He added
that all Teamsters locals delivering to
Stanford had sanctioned the strike.
Tham and Berk feuded two years
ago when both unions were trying to
organize the bargaining unit that USE
now represents.
In other strike-related news
yesterday, Peter Carpenter, Med
School vice president for medical
affairs, said the linen shortage caused
by the USE strike had been solved.
'More Linen'
"We have more linen in the med
center than ever before," he said. "We
were smarter than the union. They
challenged us to come up with
alternate supplies and we did."
Assistant Med Center information
officer Gary Cavalli noted that other
Med Center officials were not as
optimistic as Carpenter. He said, "we
are getting [the linen] through, but
it's quite a struggle."
According to Cavalli, nurses are
cutting back in some areas and other
employees are taking their uniforms
home for washing.
USE has refused to tell linen truck
drivers that they may cross the picket
lines, claiming linen is not essential.
(Yesterday, the Daily incorrectly
reported that USE picketed Valley
West Hospital in Los Gatos. The actual
location of picketing, and of some of
the University's linen supplies, was
Valley Medical Center in San Jose.)
While little construction work took
place at the med school (only
ironworkers were at the scene,
according to Anderson), construction
resumed despite USE pickets next to
the steam plant, where a cooling unit

is being built.
At the law school site, construction
work continued on a reduced scale.
About 10 workers were reported
inside the building.
At the steam plant itself, picketers
reported that the University was
having trouble repairing three leaks in
condensate pipes on Campus Drive.
According to the picketers, the leaks
are costing the University a great deal
of money on water to replace that lost
in the leaks, chemicals to treat the
water and man-hours.
Steam Plant
Inside the steam plant, supervisor
Bob McKnight said that all leaks
would be repaired by tomorrow and
that operations were proceeding
smoothly. The picketers scoffed at this
statement.
Strike operations director Dan
DeYoung said "things are going quite
normally at the steam plant," as well
as across campus generally.
He did note that one toilet was
stopped up "obviously maliciously"
yesterday at News and Publications in
Encina Hall.
Sulfur Stench
DeYoung did not know of an
overpowering sulfur smell in Memorial
Auditorium which drove many
students out of Human Sexuality class.
He theorized it might have been
caused by a sewer backup, which he
said occurs periodically.
University Food Service operations
continued as on Tuesday, with Stern
and Wilbur reporting below-normal
counts of students served.
Tresidder Food Service is not being
struck, as its employees are not
University employees. The workers
were scheduled to vote on whether to
join the union today, but TDS, Inc.,
which employs the workers,
challenged the eligibility of persons on
the voting list. The NLRB postponed
the election indefinitely while it
examines the challenge.
Other reporters working on this
story were Don Cox, John Freed, Rich
Jaroslovsky, Bruce Kadden, Glenn
Kramon, Mark Simonian, David
Thiemann and Stan Wilson.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
President Jim Berk was arrested
yesterday morning as the union
intensified its efforts to block
construction at Stanford Hospital.
' Otherwise, the third day of the
strike passed much as did the first two,
with 950 workers staying away from
their jobs, according to University
estimates.

continue 24 hours a day, he said.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger issued a
memo saying "It is regrettable that
some members of United Stanford
Employees have chosen to violate the
law by making it very difficult for
construction workers, not involved in
the strike, to gain access through the
reserved gate to the hospital
construction site."
The University may seek injunctions
against USE to restrain disorderly
picketing or conducting a secondary
boycott, or both.
'Illegal' Picketing
University chief negotiator Doug
Barton defined illegal picketing as
"amassing individuals in such a way as
to make access to the premises
physically impossible."
The University would seek a
temporary restraining order against
physical blocking, from a Santa Clara
County Superior Court. A restraining
order may not take more than a few
hours to get, Barton said.
The University is also considering
filing charges with the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) in San
Francisco to stop secondary
boycotting.
A secondary boycott is one directed
at stopping picketing of an employer
other than the one being struck (in
this case, the University). Construction
workers, according to the University's
contention, would be considered
employees of the contractor, not the
University.
USE claims its picketing does not
represent a secondary boycott,
because the construction inspectors
who it says must be present at the site
are University employees legally on
strike.
Only the NLRB can file secondary
boycott charges. Barton believes it
would take the NLRB several days
after a University request to decide
whether or not to do so, and it would
take even longer for a U.S. District
Court to decide whether or not to
issue an injunction.
According to Barton "the
University is doing preliminary work"
on the injunctions, and will "take a
look at the situation [today] and
make a decision" whether to take
court action on either charge.
USE's action to stop drivers from
entering construction sites is necessary
because Teamsters Joint Council No. 7
has not sanctioned the USE strike.
According to Rudy Tham,
secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local
856, the council voted 7-0 yesterday
afternoon to table indefinitely a

sanction motion.
Tham said Teamsters sanction was
withheld because "their [USE's]
demands are ridiculous." Teamsters
drivers may use their own judgment
whether or not to cross a USE picket
line, he said.
Berk said most Teamsters drivers
were not crossing the lines. He said,
"Everybody in the whole blasted
[Teamsters] world" except Rudy
Tham is supporting the strike, and that
only Tham's personal "power play"
had blocked the sanction. He added
that all Teamsters locals delivering to
Stanford had sanctioned the strike.
Tham and Berk feuded two years
ago when both unions were trying to
organize the bargaining unit that USE
now represents.
In other strike-related news
yesterday, Peter Carpenter, Med
School vice president for medical
affairs, said the linen shortage caused
by the USE strike had been solved.
'More Linen'
"We have more linen in the med
center than ever before," he said. "We
were smarter than the union. They
challenged us to come up with
alternate supplies and we did."
Assistant Med Center information
officer Gary Cavalli noted that other
Med Center officials were not as
optimistic as Carpenter. He said, "we
are getting [the linen] through, but
it's quite a struggle."
According to Cavalli, nurses are
cutting back in some areas and other
employees are taking their uniforms
home for washing.
USE has refused to tell linen truck
drivers that they may cross the picket
lines, claiming linen is not essential.
(Yesterday, the Daily incorrectly
reported that USE picketed Valley
West Hospital in Los Gatos. The actual
location of picketing, and of some of
the University's linen supplies, was
Valley Medical Center in San Jose.)
While little construction work took
place at the med school (only
ironworkers were at the scene,
according to Anderson), construction
resumed despite USE pickets next to
the steam plant, where a cooling unit

is being built.
At the law school site, construction
work continued on a reduced scale.
About 10 workers were reported
inside the building.
At the steam plant itself, picketers
reported that the University was
having trouble repairing three leaks in
condensate pipes on Campus Drive.
According to the picketers, the leaks
are costing the University a great deal
of money on water to replace that lost
in the leaks, chemicals to treat the
water and man-hours.
Steam Plant
Inside the steam plant, supervisor
Bob McKnight said that all leaks
would be repaired by tomorrow and
that operations were proceeding
smoothly. The picketers scoffed at this
statement.
Strike operations director Dan
DeYoung said "things are going quite
normally at the steam plant," as well
as across campus generally.
He did note that one toilet was
stopped up "obviously maliciously"
yesterday at News and Publications in
Encina Hall.
Sulfur Stench
DeYoung did not know of an
overpowering sulfur smell in Memorial
Auditorium which drove many
students out of Human Sexuality class.
He theorized it might have been
caused by a sewer backup, which he
said occurs periodically.
University Food Service operations
continued as on Tuesday, with Stern
and Wilbur reporting below-normal
counts of students served.
Tresidder Food Service is not being
struck, as its employees are not
University employees. The workers
were scheduled to vote on whether to
join the union today, but TDS, Inc.,
which employs the workers,
challenged the eligibility of persons on
the voting list. The NLRB postponed
the election indefinitely while it
examines the challenge.

story were Don Cox, John Freed, Rich
Jaroslovsky, Bruce Kadden, Glenn
Kramon, Mark Simonian, David
Thiemann and Stan Wilson.
