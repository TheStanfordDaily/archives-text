# Gay People's Union Receives State Grant
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The Gay People's Union (GPU)
here received a $30,000 first-year
grant Monday from the California
State Department of Health.
The grant is expected to strengthen
professional mental health services and
research for the Midpeninsula bisexual
and homosexual community, through
a program called the Gay Community
of Concern.
The program, which could receive
$89,000 over the next three years, will
begin July 1.
Charles Graham, associate general
secretary and consultant to the GPU
said it was the first time a grant of this
kind has been made in the country.
He explained that the program will
"work with every kind of social service
organization that deals with people,"
in order to train others to deal better
with members of the gay community.
Graham claimed that many workers
are "not well-trained" and added that
"nobody really knows how bad the
situation is."
Counseling
The program will also provide
access to treatment for members of
the gay community needing mental
health services from existing agencies,
increase the ability and competence of
gay persons to counsel other
homosexuals, and create counseling
center services in a variety of
institutional and organizational
settings.
Dick Lewis, the program's
executive director-designate and
chairperson of the GPU, said "many
homosexuals are reluctant to seek
needed mental health services from

agencies they feel will view them as
criminal or immoral.
Fear Of Disruption
'This reluctance is often
compounded by fear of disclosure and
its potential for social and economic
disruption, combined with guilt,
shame, and doubt, despite the growing
understanding by professionals, such
as the American Psychiatric
Association, and the public that
homosexuality can be a healthy
orientation."
Six professionals and staff members
are working with Lewis and the
foundation to relate the project to the
University.
They are: Graham, Patrick Gandy,
consultant to the hospitals gender
identification program; James Paulsen,
clinical associate professor of
psychiatry and staff psychiatrist at
Cowell; Sava Ranisavljevic, lecturer in
the Spanish and Portuguese Dept.;
Thom Rhue, assistant dean of graduate
studies; and Dan Williams, associate
dean of students.
Departmental Approval
The project has the approval and
support of the San Mateo and Santa
Clara County Mental Health
Departments as well as other public
and private agencies in the area.
The GPU received the grant
through the Whitman-Radclyffe
Foundation, chartered in 1972 as a
non-profit organization. The
tax-exempt foundation assists
individuals and groups in formulating
programs and securing funding for
services to the homosexual community
not provided by existing social service
and civil rights organizations.
