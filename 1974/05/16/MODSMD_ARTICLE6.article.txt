# Conspiracy Theorist Hints SLA, Government Tie
## 
### GLENN GARVIN PATTY FELS 
An invisible "supergovernment"
consisting of "organized crime,
intelligence fronts, and war industry"
controls America, conspiracy theorist
Rusty Rhodes told an audience of 250
last night in Cubberley Auditorium.
And, the control of that
supergovernment, which committed
such wildly diverse acts as the
assassination of President John
Kennedy and the kidnaping of Patty
Hearst, will become total unless
Richard Nixon is impeached, Rhodes
said.
In a free-wheeling presentation
lasting nearly three hours, Rhodes —
who appeared in place of colleague
Donald Freed, the scheduled speaker
— informed the sympathetic audience
that:
— the plane crash that killed
Watergate conspirator E. Howard
Hunt's wife, Dorothy, last year was
the result of sabotage;
— the Civil Air Patrol is a "CIA
[Central Intelligence Agency] front";
— Black Panther leader Huey
Newton may be marked for
assassination by the Symbionese
Liberation Army;
— and government agents attempted
a massive campaign of violence on
behalf of radical groups (both left and
right wing) that was designed to peak
during the summer of 1972, when

Nixon would declare a state of
emergency and take over the country-.
Rhodes is executive director of the
Citizens Research and Investigation
Committee, a group currently
investigating what it claims is
government collusion with the SLA.
Rhodes read a long list of the arrests
of Donald DeFreeze, the
self-proclaimed leader of the SLA, and
said it proved that he must be a police
agent.
"We have a situation where
DeFreeze was arrested 11 times for
walking around with hand grenades,
sawed-off shotguns, automatic
weapons, and is never sent to prison,"
Rhodes explained.
"DeFreeze even requested that
Evelle Younger [California attorney
general] testify at one of his trials in
1969," he continued.
Rhodes claimed that behind these
various activities lurked the
"supergovernment ... under the
banner of anticommunism." He said
John Kennedy's assassination "was the
secret government coming into the
open."
Rhodes said the SLA, which he
claimed was cooperating with the
government, used "behavioral
modification techniques" on Patty
Hearst to make her join them.
"I do believe if we kicked down the
door tonight, she'd be the first to
reach for a gun," Rhodes said.

investigating what it claims is
government collusion with the SLA.
Rhodes read a long list of the arrests
of Donald DeFreeze, the
self-proclaimed leader of the SLA, and
said it proved that he must be a police
agent.
"We have a situation where
DeFreeze was arrested 11 times for
walking around with hand grenades,
sawed-off shotguns, automatic
weapons, and is never sent to prison,"
Rhodes explained.
"DeFreeze even requested that
Evelle Younger [California attorney
general] testify at one of his trials in
1969," he continued.
Rhodes claimed that behind these
various activities lurked the
"supergovernment ... under the
banner of anticommunism." He said
John Kennedy's assassination "was the
secret government coming into the
open."
Rhodes said the SLA, which he
claimed was cooperating with the
government, used "behavioral
modification techniques" on Patty
Hearst to make her join them.
"I do believe if we kicked down the
door tonight, she'd be the first to
reach for a gun," Rhodes said.
