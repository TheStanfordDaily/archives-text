# Funds Don't Exist

One does not like to get
involved in a fight between others.
USE seems to insist that it is in a
fight with the administration
which does not concern the rest
of the University Community.
This would only be true if the
administration could draw on
unlimited economic resources and
if the funds for large wage
increases did not have to come
from other segments of the
community.
USE's Jim Berk insists, "They
[the University] are going to have
to dip into the reserves to pay us.
They have to go back to the
alumni and the Federal
government and get more money"
(Daily, April 12). What reserves is
Berk referring to? The University
has already been going to alumni
and Federal government as hard
and as constantly as possible.
Does anyone reallv think that the
alumni would have suddenly
increased their giving because USE
received the 33 percent wage
increase (now dropped to 23
percent) they demanded in April?
On what basis would Berk have
the University ask the Federal
government for increased funds;
The Federal government has taken
no responsibility to underwrite
Stanford's labor costs. Practically
all Federal funding comes in the
form of grants and contracts in
which a fixed, predetermined,
amount of money is given to do a
certain job.
The largest single contract is
for SLAC. Here, the AEC allots a
given amount of money each year.
In recent years, this support has
been decreasing. This, in turn, has
made it necessary to reduce the
SLAC staff. If USE had succeeded
in obtaining their 33 percent
increase (or the 23 percent
increase now requested), it would
mean termination of a
corresponding number of workers.

For a number of years, the
University has worked hard to
bring the salaries of workers up to
the levels of the surrounding
employers. For the most part it
seems to have succeeded.
The Government regulations
governing unionized workers
prevented the University from
giving workers in the USE work
units raises when the rest of the
University rectivcu ohem last year.
Thus, the salaries of USE workers
feil back relative to tnose of the
surrounding community.
Ironically, this was a result of the
formation of the Union.
Stanford University has no
magic reserves or sources of funds
with which an extreme wage
increase could have been covered.
The only income which Stanford
can change at will is the tuition.
Recognizing the realities of
University financing, would Berk
have the tuition increased? Other
alternatives would be to have
non-Union employees of the
University increasingly underpaid
(in my department, faculty
salaries, including full summer
employment, now run about 20
percent below those in industry),
or large layoffs, or some
combination of the two.
It seems to me that the
University has had no alternative
but to refuse to settle for raises of
more than about 10 to 12
percent. Otherwise, unfair damage
must be done to other sectors of
the University in order to provide
the funds for the Union raises. In
my opinion, Berk and the USE
leadership have done their
membership a disservice by
leading them to think that
Stanford had extra funds readily
available for very large wage
increases.

University has worked hard to
bring the salaries of workers up to
the levels of the surrounding
employers. For the most part it
seems to have succeeded.
The Government regulations
governing unionized workers
prevented the University from
giving workers in the USE work
units raises when the rest of the
University rectivcu ohem last year.
Thus, the salaries of USE workers
feil back relative to tnose of the
surrounding community.
Ironically, this was a result of the
formation of the Union.
Stanford University has no
magic reserves or sources of funds
with which an extreme wage
increase could have been covered.
The only income which Stanford
can change at will is the tuition.
Recognizing the realities of
University financing, would Berk
have the tuition increased? Other
alternatives would be to have
non-Union employees of the
University increasingly underpaid
(in my department, faculty
salaries, including full summer
employment, now run about 20
percent below those in industry),
or large layoffs, or some
combination of the two.
It seems to me that the
University has had no alternative
but to refuse to settle for raises of
more than about 10 to 12
percent. Otherwise, unfair damage
must be done to other sectors of
the University in order to provide
the funds for the Union raises. In
my opinion, Berk and the USE
leadership have done their
membership a disservice by
leading them to think that
Stanford had extra funds readily
available for very large wage
increases.

electrical engineering and
materials science.)
One does not like to get
involved in a fight between others.
USE seems to insist that it is in a
fight with the administration
which does not concern the rest
of the University Community.
This would only be true if the
administration could draw on
unlimited economic resources and
if the funds for large wage
increases did not have to come
from other segments of the
community.
USE's Jim Berk insists, "They
[the University] are going to have
to dip into the reserves to pay us.
They have to go back to the
alumni and the Federal
government and get more money"
(Daily, April 12). What reserves is
Berk referring to? The University
has already been going to alumni
and Federal government as hard
and as constantly as possible.
Does anyone reallv think that the
alumni would have suddenly
increased their giving because USE
received the 33 percent wage
increase (now dropped to 23
percent) they demanded in April?
On what basis would Berk have
the University ask the Federal
government for increased funds;
The Federal government has taken
no responsibility to underwrite
Stanford's labor costs. Practically
all Federal funding comes in the
form of grants and contracts in
which a fixed, predetermined,
amount of money is given to do a
certain job.
The largest single contract is
for SLAC. Here, the AEC allots a
given amount of money each year.
In recent years, this support has
been decreasing. This, in turn, has
made it necessary to reduce the
SLAC staff. If USE had succeeded
in obtaining their 33 percent
increase (or the 23 percent
increase now requested), it would
mean termination of a
corresponding number of workers.
