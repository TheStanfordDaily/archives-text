# Medvedev Erred
## 
### 
After having heard Zhores
Medvedev 's talk two things
seemed to me to be important
enough to share with Daily
readers:
Although Medvedev amply
"'ticized the regimes of Stalin
ui.d Khrushchev there was
absolute no mention of the
present jvernment. He did talk
about dissenters and he did
iticht le lack of freedom in
literature and music, but this
criticism culminated only in the
statements that there are no
detective novels available and that
the Beatles are banned in Russia,
as Medvedev himself said, "not a
great loss to the Soviet Union."
The second thing that struck
me was the fact that not one word
was said during the entire talk
about Soviet Jews, who probably
constitute the largest group, of
dissenters in the USSR.
Even if for no other reason the
amount of publicity that their
plight has received here would
have justified mentioning them.
Maybe Medvedev found it
inopportune to do so because the
Soviet Jews are a counterexample
to a few things that he wants to
make us believe:
Sizeable Group
First, the Soviet Jews are a
very sizeable group of dissenters
and not just a few individuals.
Second, they encompass the
whole social spectrum and not

George Szpiro

just intellectuals.
Third, and most important,
30,000 Jews have been permitted
to emigrate to Israel yearly for the
past few years, not just Valeri
Panov and a random sample of a
few others as Medvedev implied in
answer to a question from the
audience. Would this or, for
instance, the abolition of
head-taxes have been possible
without pressure from outside?
Pressure Needed
Certainly not! This has been
confirmed to me inside and
outside the Soviet Union by
numerous Jewish dissenters.
Moreover, we all know what
happened in Germany 30 years
ago when nobody wanted to get
involved in Hitler's domestic
affairs.
In conclusion, we must ask
ourselves what Medvedev is trying
to do. Does he want to appease
the Soviet authorities so that he
can return to his homeland one
day or, worse still, has he maybe
forgotten the real issues?
In any case, a feeling persists
that Medvedev's talk served to
make the persecutions by the
Soviet authorities seem harmless
in order to increase opposition
against the Jackson amendment
and related matters and increase
support for detente ueber alles.
To whose benefit?

that Medvedev's talk served to
make the persecutions by the

After having heard Zhores
Medvedev 's talk two things
seemed to me to be important
enough to share with Daily
readers:
Although Medvedev amply
"'ticized the regimes of Stalin
ui.d Khrushchev there was
absolute no mention of the
present jvernment. He did talk
about dissenters and he did
iticht le lack of freedom in
literature and music, but this
criticism culminated only in the
statements that there are no
detective novels available and that
the Beatles are banned in Russia,
as Medvedev himself said, "not a
great loss to the Soviet Union."
The second thing that struck
me was the fact that not one word
was said during the entire talk
about Soviet Jews, who probably
constitute the largest group, of
dissenters in the USSR.
Even if for no other reason the
amount of publicity that their
plight has received here would
have justified mentioning them.
Maybe Medvedev found it
inopportune to do so because the
Soviet Jews are a counterexample
to a few things that he wants to
make us believe:
Sizeable Group
First, the Soviet Jews are a
very sizeable group of dissenters
and not just a few individuals.
Second, they encompass the
whole social spectrum and not

just intellectuals.
Third, and most important,
30,000 Jews have been permitted
to emigrate to Israel yearly for the
past few years, not just Valeri
Panov and a random sample of a
few others as Medvedev implied in
answer to a question from the
audience. Would this or, for
instance, the abolition of
head-taxes have been possible
without pressure from outside?
Pressure Needed
Certainly not! This has been
confirmed to me inside and
outside the Soviet Union by
numerous Jewish dissenters.
Moreover, we all know what
happened in Germany 30 years
ago when nobody wanted to get
involved in Hitler's domestic
affairs.
In conclusion, we must ask
ourselves what Medvedev is trying
to do. Does he want to appease
the Soviet authorities so that he
can return to his homeland one
day or, worse still, has he maybe
forgotten the real issues?
In any case, a feeling persists
that Medvedev's talk served to
make the persecutions by the
Soviet authorities seem harmless
in order to increase opposition
against the Jackson amendment
and related matters and increase
support for detente ueber alles.
