# Effect On Campus Pub Unclear
## Liquor Sales Bill Killed 
### KEVIN SMITH 
A California Assembly committee killed a bill Wednesday
which would have apparently eliminated the remaining ban
on liquor sales near the University campus, but it was
unclear what effect this would have on the proposed
on-campus pub.
The defeated legislation, which was reportedly sought by
the cities of Palo Alto and Menlo Park and opposed by
retail liquor dealers, would apparently have permitted
liquor stores to operate within one mile of the campus,
contrary to the University's charter.
Such a move would have increased revenue for the two
cities, but would have taken business away from retail
liquor stores which are currently just outside the one mile
limit.
The San Francisco Chronicle reported yesterday that the
bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Dixon Arnett, R-Redwood
City, "would have paved the way for a liquor license on the
Stanford University campus."
However, this appears to be erroneous. The Faculty Club
was finally granted a liquor license by the Dept. of
Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) several years ago after a
year-and-a-half struggle.
License Granted
Former ASSU Vice President Jim Friend, who first
proposed the pub, said, 'The ABC — the same agency we're
applying to — has already given Stanford a license right on

campus."
Therefore, he said, "the restrictions on liquor on this
campus have long since been waived."
"Because of that," Friend said, "I don't see how
anything that Dixon Arnett or the Assembly does precludes
us from having liquor on campus."
According to Friend, 'The 'dry zone' around the campus
has to do with package stores and has nothing to do with
liquor licenses or with beer and wine licenses."
But Arnett's assistant, Chuck Cavalier, said yesterday
that the defeat was a severe setback for the future of the
pub.
No Changes Anticipated
However, Dr. Stewart Ritchie, president of
Guckenheimer Corp. which will possibly manage the pub,
disputed Cavalier's statement, saying, "As of now, we're
not anticipating that it changes anything."
"Apparently there's an attempt to get a liquor store in
the [Stanford] shopping center," Ritchie said.
He said he thought the legislation "is in response to that
and not the pub," adding, "I don't think this has anything
to do with the pub."
He said that packaged liquor would be the only product
still affected by the ban since Stickney's at Town and
Country Village serves cocktails even though it is within
one mile of the campus.

Such a move would have increased revenue for the two
cities, but would have taken business away from retail
liquor stores which are currently just outside the one mile
limit.
The San Francisco Chronicle reported yesterday that the
bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Dixon Arnett, R-Redwood
City, "would have paved the way for a liquor license on the
Stanford University campus."
However, this appears to be erroneous. The Faculty Club
was finally granted a liquor license by the Dept. of
Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) several years ago after a
year-and-a-half struggle.
License Granted
Former ASSU Vice President Jim Friend, who first
proposed the pub, said, 'The ABC — the same agency we're
applying to — has already given Stanford a license right on

campus."
Therefore, he said, "the restrictions on liquor on this
campus have long since been waived."
"Because of that," Friend said, "I don't see how
anything that Dixon Arnett or the Assembly does precludes
us from having liquor on campus."
According to Friend, 'The 'dry zone' around the campus
has to do with package stores and has nothing to do with
liquor licenses or with beer and wine licenses."
But Arnett's assistant, Chuck Cavalier, said yesterday
that the defeat was a severe setback for the future of the
pub.
No Changes Anticipated
However, Dr. Stewart Ritchie, president of
Guckenheimer Corp. which will possibly manage the pub,
disputed Cavalier's statement, saying, "As of now, we're
not anticipating that it changes anything."
"Apparently there's an attempt to get a liquor store in
the [Stanford] shopping center," Ritchie said.
He said he thought the legislation "is in response to that
and not the pub," adding, "I don't think this has anything
to do with the pub."
He said that packaged liquor would be the only product
still affected by the ban since Stickney's at Town and
Country Village serves cocktails even though it is within
one mile of the campus.

A California Assembly committee killed a bill Wednesday
which would have apparently eliminated the remaining ban
on liquor sales near the University campus, but it was
unclear what effect this would have on the proposed
on-campus pub.
The defeated legislation, which was reportedly sought by
the cities of Palo Alto and Menlo Park and opposed by
retail liquor dealers, would apparently have permitted
liquor stores to operate within one mile of the campus,
contrary to the University's charter.
Such a move would have increased revenue for the two
cities, but would have taken business away from retail
liquor stores which are currently just outside the one mile
limit.
