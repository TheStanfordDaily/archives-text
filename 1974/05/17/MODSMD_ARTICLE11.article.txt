# The 						Moral Obligation To Diagnose

William Shockley

(A response to the syndicated column of
William F. Buckley, Jr., entitled "Shockley's
Yale 'Debate'" in the San Francisco
Examiner of April 25.)
The recent column by William F. Buckley,
Jr., about my disrupted debate at Yale
provides an ideal clinical case for diagnosis of
an anti-objectivity syndrome that causes
thought-blocks in American intellectuals.
Indeed, direct quotations from Buckley's
column provide specific examples of the
symptoms of the syndrome.
The first symptom that I shall diagnose is
the reasoning behind Buckley's conclusion
that if the disruption had not saved me, then
I would have been "slaughtered" by my
opponent at Yale, Will;am Rusher, the
publisher of Buckley's National Review — an
opponent hand-picked by Buckley, who
turned down an invitation tq debate me
himself with the excuse th?t he had been at
Yale already this year.
Rusher would have shown that "only true
conservatives can dispose with confidence of
the Shockle> menace." How? Not, Buckley
explained, by addressing my "scientific
judgments and values." Buckley would have
had Rusher dispose of all diagnostic findings
simply as "irrelevancies" — ones that, in his
words, "are, well, derived from empirical
conclusions."
There, my friend, you sec the true scandal
of education at Yale — a noted Yale alumnus
who would dispose of any value or judgment
distasteful to him on the grounds that it was
based on observation.
Buckley 's Report Inaccurate
But what would have been relevant in the
debate? The subject was specified by the

agreed upon title for the debate. Buckley did
not report this title — an omission in keeping
with his indifference to accurate reporting.
His "never mind if I have some of the
words wrong" attitude shows, for example,
in his assertion that I made the decision to
leave the auditorium after 75 minutes of
disruption.
It was not I but our hosts at Yale who
decided to call it quits. I had sat through
nearly twice as long a disruption at New
York University less than a week before Yale.
At NYU the presentation did finally come
off as a consequence of the leadership of
Dean Robert McKay of the law school. But
where was Yale's law dean? Associated Press
quoted me as saying at the height of the Yale
disruption: "This is the lousiest operation
administratively that I have seen."
Title 'Too Hot'
.The debate title was "Resolved: Society
should diagnose and treat tragic racial IQ
inferiorities." Evidently, Buckley found this
too hot for his column. I had originally urged
a much stronger title — indeed, the same one
used at NYU for the presentation that did
come off. That title is the essence of my
position compressed into thirteen words:
"The moral obligation to diagnose the
American Negro tragedy of statistical IQ
deficit."
The Buckley column explicitly reveals
how to evade "the moral obligation to
diagnose." Indeed, it is an ideal clinical
example of the "Apple-of-God's-Eye
Obsession" as defined in my analysis in The
Humanist for January, 1972.
Like the Buckley column, this obsession
rejects science. The obsession of Galileo's day

that nearly burned him at the stake was that
God must have so favored man that he placed
the Garden of Eden, rather than the sun, at
the center of the universe. Today, the
obsession asserts that God has so legislated
nature's laws that man's well being is
guaranteed by good intentions or even benign
neglect.
'Metaphysical Equality'
Thus, Buckley proclaims the irrelevancy
of my demands for diagnosis of dysgenics by
opining that were my worries to be
scientifically endorsed, then although liberal
"cosmology would fall ... this would not be
the case for those whose values are Christian,
and whose belief is in metaphysical
equality."
Is not Buckley saying that the National
Review is the center of universal true thought
and, furthermore, that even if God gave man
his brain for thinking, Buckley's news sources
reliably inform him that thinking about
dysgenics is not merely irrelevant but in fact
neo-barbaric?
Is my diagnosis of Buckleyism sound? The
issues are vital. Our citizens should have
opportunity to observe combat between
Buckley's ideas and mine. Truth should then
triumph. Accordingly, I am transmitting
these thoughts with a covering letter of
challenge to Buckley and to Rusher. My
challenge defines circumstances intended to
reveal both the logic and also the integrity of
our differences. My intent is to make this
combat as illuminating as possible for the
viewing public.
