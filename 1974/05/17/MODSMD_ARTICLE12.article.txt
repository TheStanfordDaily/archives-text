# On The Strike And Social Justice
## 
### 
Raymond Giroud

The USE strike brings to the
surface problems of social justice
that are only obscured by
denunc atory articles like Tim
Ferguson's in the May 13 Daily.
There is, of course, no question
that student fees at Stanford and
other comparable institutions
have a ready reached levels that
endanger their survival as
demociatic universities. If only
the ric!rÂ» can afford to send their
children to Stanford, it will cease
to be a real university.
Students who already have
difficulty in meeting expenses
here are understandably
concerned about any further
escalation of their fees. Surely,
however, they must see the
injustice of concentrating their
displeasure on the demands of the
most underprivileged and lowest
paid of Stanford's employees.
Whatever the solution to our
financial problems, it should not
be based on our being subsidized
by discriminatory underpayment
of dishwashers, lab technicians
and teaching assistants.
Some Other 'Solutions'
Some college presidents have
sought to deal with the tuition
problem by trying to get the state
universities to raise their fees, so
as to make the private schools
more competitive in the education
market.
I think that is wrong. It doesn't
reduce student expenses here and
it spread discontent elsewhere. We
must find a way of paying
workers fairly without resorting
to more student fee increases
iinywhere.
This is a problem that
confronts the entire community.
All constituencies are concerned.
The students' interests are
obvious.
But faculty also are involved.

Many, like the students, use
services provided by USE workers;
some work with them on research
projects. In any case, the conduct
of academic life is inseparable
from the policy decisions required
for dealing with the issues raised
by the strike.
Faculty Salaries
Also we cannot deny that the
faculty themselves are always
concerned about their own
salaries and about such issues as
the right not to be disciplined for
non-job-related conduct (one of
USE's demands), particularly with
regard to exercise of First
Amendment rights.
I must disagree with Jim Berk's
statement that tuition is none of
USE's business, although I think
he meant that it would not be up
to USE to decide what part, if
any, of an increase in workers'
wages and benefits ought to be
covered by a tuition increase. I
also disagree with Douglas
Barton's statement that the
business of students during the
strike is to go on being students
(whatever that means).
Both these statements,
however, are indirect
commentaries on the absence of
student, worker and faculty
participation in (he formulation
of the University's policies and in
the making of decisions that
eventually affect us all.
Claim Responsibility
We all owe it both to others
amd to ourselves to claim
responsibility for the welfare of
the institution and the individuals
in it, and not to abandon
responsibility to an administration
whose purposes and interests do
not necessarily coincide with our
own.
Our University is not an
industrial corporation. What is

good for General Motors or for
Northrop is not necessarily good
for Stanford. Our values are not
best realized within the kind of
management structure that serves
institutions in the business of
profiting from the manufacture or
sale of a product.
If Universities are to fulfill
their claim to provide some sort
of moral and intellectual
leadership, they must begin by
striving to create a just society on
their own ground. Our wise words

of advice on national issues will
seem hollow if not hypocritical if
we practice exploitation, or at
best, benign neglect, at home.
Workers, students and faculty
must join together in their
concern for the governance and
the economy of Stanford if we are
to live and work with one another
with mutual respect. I believe the
workers' cause is just and that our
response to their appeal must be
understanding and supportive.
