# Med Center Linen

Stanford is making a big deal
about dirty linen at the hospital.
USE's position is that Stanford is
badly exaggerating the problem.
Stanford should clean its own
dirty linen by offering decent
medical benefits and wages to its
employees.
According to Paul Hoffman,
director of Stanford University
Hospital, USE's decision to block
linen shipments "will affect
patient care services seriously."
Doctors and nurses advising USE
disagree — for the following
reasons:
1. Linen is not a perishable
item like blood. A delay of linen
shipments of one to two days in
itself will not interfere with
patient care.
2. The Administration can ship
linen in and out of the Hospital in
its own vehicles. USE does not
interfere wtih Stanford vehicles.
But USE does ask drivers from
outside unions or companies to
honor the picket line.
Not All Necessary
3. Not all "linen" is necessary
for surgery or sterility in hospital
rooms. A large part of each linen
shipment includes towels,
pajamas, bedclothes which don't
need to be changed every day and
other items.
The linen actually needed for
vital patient care comprises a very
small part of each linen shipment.
Stanford has not distinguished
between essential and
non-essential linen.
4. Most of Stanford's 60-70
surgical operations a day are in
the category of elective surgery,
which can be done at convenience
within a reasonable span of time.
Doctors advising USE estimate
that a maximum of 10-15
operations per day are in the
category of surgical emergencies.
Cut Elective Surgery
Stanford would have no
problem getting enough linen for
emergency operations if it cut
back its schedule for elective
surgery ( though doctors and the
hospital would lose a lot of
money if elective surgery were cut
back.)
5. Not all of Stanford's
problems in getting enough linen
come from USE. On Monday,
May 13, Stanford sent a shipment
of dirty linen to Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center (SCVMC)
in San Jose for cleaning. USE's
sister union there, Local 715 of
SEIU, refused to clean it.
This dirty linen — much of it
contaminated with blood from
surgery and other procedures —
was returned to" Stanford
Hospital. The Stanford
administration asked non-striking
workers at the Hospital and
Medical Center to sort this dirty
linen by hand, in addition to their
regular jobs.
USE health advisors believed
that this manual sorting of dirty
linen by workers was not essential
for vital patient care. Also, since it
was unclear if the linen had been
properly screened for hepatitis
and other contagious diseases, a
doctor advising USE contacted
the Santa Clara Department of
Public Health, which immediately
sent an inspector to certify health
standards. (People concerned
about public health hazards may
call 408-277-1620.)
In summary, USE will continue
to permit deliveries to the
Hospital which are essential to
patient care. Stanford can protect
patient care by responding
quickly to workers requests for
decent wages and benefits.

committee.)
