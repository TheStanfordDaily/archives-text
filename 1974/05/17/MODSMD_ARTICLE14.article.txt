# USE Demands And Tuition

Many students are understandably worried that
the financial costs of a University acceptance of
USE wage demands would, necessarily, be passed
on to students in the form of an increase in tution.
The University, in a rather obvious attempt to
deprive the Union of student support by convincing
students that the demands of the Union run
counter to students' interests, has encouraged this
belief.
An examination of Stanford's financial
structure, however, reveals that, in fact, as Vice
President of Finances Augsburger admitted last
quarter, pay increases for the Union can't logically
come from the students and that tuition shouldn't
be affected.
The University has a complicated financial
structure that involves a number of autonomous
budgets, including the Operating Budget, SLAC,
the Hospital, Tresidder, the Stanford Press,
Intercollegiate Athletics, the Service Centers and
the residence and dining halls. Student tuition
makes up half of the Operating Budget.
Few USE Workers
USE has very few workers who are paid from
the Operating Budget. As it says on page 52 of the
Operating Budget Guidelines: %
"No recommendation appears concerning
salaries in the technical maintenance/service

bargaining unit. . . . Only a small portion of the
unit is funded by general funds; most of these
employees are funded by grants, contracts,
auxiliaries, and service units. "
Stanford sets the pay scale for workers in the
various budgets, and accordingly a USE victory
would mean that research contracts and grants
would be increased or redesigned to take the higher
wages into account.
Food Situation Differs
The situation is somewhat different in the case
of Food Service Employees, the worst paid workers
in the University. The University has recognized the
justice of these workers' demands, and it is likely
that students will have to pay a part of the raises
granted to these workers.
Food service is already scheduled to go up five
percent in the dorms next year, and the outcome of
the strike is unlikely to change this figure
significantly.
Students should recognize that their financial
interests are not threatened by this strike, and that
the Stanford Community as a whole stands to lose
if an equitable and humane response to the workers
demands is not forthcoming.
