# Bem Family Shares Responsibilities In Marriage Based On 'Equality'
## 
### SUE LUTTNER 
"A lot of people warned us that
being egalitarian would work until
we had children," said Assistant
Professor of Psychology Sandra
Bern.
But she and her husband Daryl,
an associate professor in the same
department, have found that they
can share responsibility for child
care, contrasting to the traditional
expectation that the mother will
take on most of the work.
The Bems, who have done
extensive research on sex roles,
are known for their advocacy and
practice of sexual equality. Sandra
teaches a class in "The Psychology
of Sex Roles" and has researched
ways of measuring androgyny and
sex role adaptability.
The Bems are now applying
their beliefs as the parents of a
baby girl, Emily, born on March
9.
Because both parents care for
the child, having a baby has not
interfered fatally with either of
their professional lives. Their

previous division of household
responsibility now extends to
child care.
This equality was not a
conscious decision by the couple,
"It's just the way we are," Daryl
explained.
Because caring for a baby takes
so much time, many women quit
their jobs or work only part-time
after they have a baby. Sandra
said it took a lot of planning but
"we arranged our work life so
child care can be handled."
"We have to think about it,"
said Daryl, "Not because we
would be unfair, but because we
have to coordinate babysitting."
This quarter one of the Bems
spends half of the day at home
with Emily, allowing the other to
work at school. Sandra babysits
Monday and Wednesday
mornings; Daryl babysits Tuesday
and Thursday mornings; Fridays
are "up for grabs."
In the afternoon, the Bems
exchange responsibilities.
The added responsibility of a

child emphasizes the difference
between a helpful husband and an
egalitarian marriage, Daryl said.
"A lot of women who think
their marriages are 'egalitarian'
mean that their husbands are
helpful," said Daryl. "What they
don't recognize is that he has
never taken full responsibility for
the work."
One complication is breast
feeding. When the Bems first
considered breast feeding, they
worried that "feeding would be all
the fun," and that Daryl would
have nothing to do. But they
share even this necessarily female
job.
"I happen to function better in
the middle of the night," said
Daryl. So when Emily cries at
night, he gets up, changes her, and
brings her to Sandra to nurse.
Daryl emphasized that few
cultures leave child care entirely
to the mother. He said that
extended families, in which
several relatives share
responsibility for a child, are more
prevalent in other countries and
are probably better for the child.
What traditionally has been
called a maternal instinct, the
Bems prefer to call a "parental
instinct," since both parents can
experience it.
But the Bems do not intend to
experiment with Emily. "Having a
child for us was not a political act.
Nor will raising our child be a
political act," Daryl emphasized.
"We intentionally made the
decision to add another dimension
to our lives," said Sandra. "I don't
want Emily to be a public
person."
They said they don't expect
their child-caring techniques to be
unusual. "I'm sure we're about
the same as other parents who
read Dr. Spock and wonder what
they're doing," Daryl said.
But he did predict, "I suspect
you will not see her in frilly little
dresses." He said that boys'
clothes, or androgynous clothes,
are much more functional.
