# Freshman Year Report Suggests More Structured Course Sequences
## 
### 
A new report on the freshman
year at Stanford suggests faculty
develop more structured course
sequences to help students fulfill
their area distribution
requirements.
Prepared by Assistant Prof.
Nancy Packer, who currently
heads the Creative Writing Center,
the report reflects frequently
expressed faculty concern for
more structured choices within
the curriculum and the central
recommendation of the 1966-69
Study of Education at Stanford,
which called for continual
self-examination and self-renewal
within the University.
The freshman year project
builds on SES, Packer noted in an
interview last month. "SES
cleared away the brush. It broke
down little empires. But it didn't
sterilize the ground. In this report
we're trying to get a little
something growing that isn't a
mass of underbrush and weeds.

"The faculty now must take
new responsibility because the
advising has not functioned as
well as it might have," she said.
In her witty and highly
readable report, Packer describes
the pre-SES system as "rigid and
complex to the point of bizarre
and prescriptive to the point of
dictatorial.
Distribution Requirements
"Fulfilling the general studies
requirements could take over half
a student's time," Packer
commented. "The advice that was
usually given was not good advice,
but how to 'get out of here.'
"SES recommended that the
general education requirements at
Stanford consist of the fulfillment
of a writing proficiency, a major
field of study, three courses from
the two large areas outside the
major, and one course in historical
studies.
"After rejecting the historical
studies requirement, the

Academic Senate accepted this
package, and it exists unchanged
today."
Unhappy With Trend
Packer, a University Fellow,
undertook the Freshman Year
Project because she was unhappy
with the increasing trend toward
preprofessional education and
away from general education.
"In my view, general education
was simply not taken seriously
enough at Stanford. There are no
guidelines, no recommendations.
"What my report did was say,
'Let's build on SES. We need a
little structure.'
"But," she cautioned, "as
between lack of structure now
and the Byzantine fascistic
structure we had before, 111 take
anarchy any time."
Packer feels, however, that the
University doesn't have to settle
for anarchy. She wants to alleviate
certain symptoms of this chaos:
incoherence in student choice,
lack of breadth, of continuity,
lack of a common intellectual
experience for all freshmen, and
lack of historical perspectives.
Establish Advising Group
Her basic suggestion is the
establishment of an advising group
from each department to
"determine what courses should
be taken to fulfill the area
distribution requirement."
It's function, the report states,
would be three-fold: to establish
general goals for the distribution
requirement in that area, to

promote guidelines for courses
that are intended to fulfill the
requirement, and to evaluate
course offerings as to whether the
goals of the requirement are
fulfilled.
The Committee on
Undergraduate Studies has voted
in substance to approve this
recommendation.
Three ad hoc committees have
been established. Prof. Hans
Andersen, chemistry, is head of
the science committee; Prof. Hans
Weiler, political science, of the
social science committee; and
Packer of the humanities
committee. Each will report back
to CUS.
In her report, Packer
specifically recommends the
development of a series of three
quarter sequences, suitable for
freshmen to fulfill their area
distribution requirement in the
humanities.
"I was trying in the report,"
she said, "to find a minimum
structure which balanced out
breadth and depth, order and
freedom.
'These sequences might be
totally within one discipline or
they might be cross-disciplinary.
"There would be no limit on
the number of sequences a
department offered. Each
sequence, however, should have a
historical dimension as well as a
concentration on the subject
matter of the discipline."
