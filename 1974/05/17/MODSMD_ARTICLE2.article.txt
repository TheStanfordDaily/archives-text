# African Drought Teach-In Panel Asserts Priority Of Sahel Region
## 
### JOHN FREED 
The five-year famine affecting 22 to
25 million persons in Africa's Sahel
region was the subject of a discussion
between five black panelists in an
"African drought teach-in" last night
at the Bechtel International Center.
Congressman Charles C. Diggs,
D-Mich., was the featured speaker at
the event. Diggs is national chairman
of Relief for Africans in Need in the
Sahel (RAINS).
On the panel with Diggs were St.
Clair Drake, professor of anthropology
and sociology; David Dußois,
editor-in-chief of the Black Panther
newspaper and a visiting professor at
the University of California-Berkeley;
Tetteh Kofi of Ghana, professor at the
Food Research Institute; and Robert
Allen, associate editor of the Black
Scholar, a black newspaper. About
150 people attended the discussion.
Diggs asserted that all of Africa,
including the Sahel region of
Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Upper
Volta, Niger and Chad, should be
important to United States foreign
policy.
"Africa is important and is growing
in importance," Diggs stated, citing
the 41-nation African bloc in the
United Nations plus the continent's
natural reserves of iron, copper and
"possibly" oil.
Must Take Action
He argued that the United States
must take action, especially through
providing technical assistance to the
Sahel nations.
"We're not engaging in an academic
exercise," Diggs noted. "We are talking
about a disaster that affects 25 million
persons directly .... The greatest
contribution the United States can
make is in technology, developing new
sources of water, new sources for the
maintenance of livestock."
Before he made his remarks, Diggs
received a check for $14,000 for
RAINS from Melissa Lawson,
chairwoman of the African Famine
Relief Committee.
The National Association of Black
Social Workers had collected $10,000
of the amount, with the remainder
coming from on-campus projects such
as sales of dinners prepared by Dave
"Big Daddy" McCulium, head chef at

the Stanford Faculty Club.
Carnival Profits
Lawson also announced at the
teach-in that last weekend's carnival
for the relief fund netted more than
$2800.
Drake sketched the Sahel's
history, noting that the great
kingdoms of the 16th century had
crumbled because of Western
exploitation of the area's resources.
"I think the starving children, the
emaciated herds, the wandering
nomads, represent a breakdown in
what was once ... one of the great
societies," Drake concluded.
Dußois said the government should
authorize $1 billion for Sahelian
nations to show more concern for
starving blacks in Africa.

"What we're talking about is
priorities .... Black lives, threatened
by extinction, are . . . as important as
the space program or an already
bloated defense budget. If this country
can give $2 billion to Israel for
instruments of death and destruction,
certainly it can afford half that
amount for six nations," he said.
Kofi said that colonization,
disruption of trade routes, and war
destroyed order in Sahelian societies.
Ensuing droughts would then
aggravate famine, leading in turn to
agricultural failure which would cause
still more internal disorder.
"I don't believe the present famine
is caused by drought, or a population
explosion, or any ecological changes,
but rather by internal disorder."

United Nations plus the continent's
natural reserves of iron, copper and
"possibly" oil.
Must Take Action
He argued that the United States
must take action, especially through
providing technical assistance to the
Sahel nations.
"We're not engaging in an academic
exercise," Diggs noted. "We are talking
about a disaster that affects 25 million
persons directly .... The greatest
contribution the United States can
make is in technology, developing new
sources of water, new sources for the
maintenance of livestock."
Before he made his remarks, Diggs
received a check for $14,000 for
RAINS from Melissa Lawson,
chairwoman of the African Famine
Relief Committee.
The National Association of Black
Social Workers had collected $10,000
of the amount, with the remainder
coming from on-campus projects such
as sales of dinners prepared by Dave
"Big Daddy" McCulium, head chef at

the Stanford Faculty Club.
Carnival Profits
Lawson also announced at the
teach-in that last weekend's carnival
for the relief fund netted more than
$2800.
Drake sketched the Sahel's
history, noting that the great
kingdoms of the 16th century had
crumbled because of Western
exploitation of the area's resources.
"I think the starving children, the
emaciated herds, the wandering
nomads, represent a breakdown in
what was once ... one of the great
societies," Drake concluded.
Dußois said the government should
authorize $1 billion for Sahelian
nations to show more concern for
starving blacks in Africa.

"What we're talking about is
priorities .... Black lives, threatened
by extinction, are . . . as important as
the space program or an already
bloated defense budget. If this country
can give $2 billion to Israel for
instruments of death and destruction,
certainly it can afford half that
amount for six nations," he said.
Kofi said that colonization,
disruption of trade routes, and war
destroyed order in Sahelian societies.
Ensuing droughts would then
aggravate famine, leading in turn to
agricultural failure which would cause
still more internal disorder.
"I don't believe the present famine
is caused by drought, or a population
explosion, or any ecological changes,
but rather by internal disorder."
The five-year famine affecting 22 to
25 million persons in Africa's Sahel
region was the subject of a discussion
between five black panelists in an
"African drought teach-in" last night
at the Bechtel International Center.
Congressman Charles C. Diggs,
D-Mich., was the featured speaker at
the event. Diggs is national chairman
of Relief for Africans in Need in the
Sahel (RAINS).
On the panel with Diggs were St.
Clair Drake, professor of anthropology
and sociology; David Dußois,
editor-in-chief of the Black Panther
newspaper and a visiting professor at
the University of California-Berkeley;
Tetteh Kofi of Ghana, professor at the
Food Research Institute; and Robert
Allen, associate editor of the Black
Scholar, a black newspaper. About
150 people attended the discussion.
Diggs asserted that all of Africa,
including the Sahel region of
Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Upper
Volta, Niger and Chad, should be
important to United States foreign
policy.
"Africa is important and is growing
in importance," Diggs stated, citing
the 41-nation African bloc in the
United Nations plus the continent's
natural reserves of iron, copper and
"possibly" oil.
