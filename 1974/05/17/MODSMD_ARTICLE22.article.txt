# Conclave To Study Chicana's Role
## 
### 
The Chicana Colectiva, a women's group, will
host a conference on May 18 and 19 here at
Stanford. Entitled "Desarrollo de la Mujer: Teoria
y Practica" (Development of the Woman: Theory
and Practice), the conference will be dealing with
the changing role of the Chicana woman as an
academician and community organizer.
According to Delia Casillas Islas, coordinator,
several workshops will be held, as well as poetry
readings and entertainment. The workshops will be
concerned with such issues as the national and

international women's struggles, community
organization, and the media.
Antonia Castaneda, former instructor at the
University of Washington and co-author of the
book Lituratura Chicana will lead the workshop on
the national women's struggle. Other notables who
will lead workshops are Elizabeth Martinez, editor
of El Grito del Norte a chicano newspaper in New
Mexico, and Patricia Fagan of San Jose, who will
speak on the international women's struggle.
