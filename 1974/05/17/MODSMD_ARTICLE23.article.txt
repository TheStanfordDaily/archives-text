# USE's Second Workless Week Should Be Quieter
## stanford Daily This Week News Analyses 
### 
United Stanford Employees
(USE) workers have been out five
days now.
Those five days have been
marked by considerable tactical
field maneuvering as USE
struggles to decisively disrupt
University operations.
As the week closes, signs
indicate that the two parties will
move their confrontations from
the streets to the bargaining table
and their conversations will begin
to generate more light than heat.
Service Employees
International Union organizer Bob
Anderson has replaced USE
President Jim Berk as field general
in charge of picket lines since he is
more experienced and tactful in
dealing with the delicate and
often painful situations that
constantly arise.

Berk has moved back to the
bargaining table where he will try
to provide direction to the union's
negotiating position.
Disorderly picketing will
subside, injunction or not, though
secondary boycotting will
continue. The union can probably
tie up the secondary boycotting
issue in enough legal knots to stall

for a while.
The University will not dismiss
the construction site picketing
lightly since the buildings are
badly needed and there is a lot of
money tied up in them.
The union suffered a
significant setback when Teamster
leader Rudy Tham refused to
allow Teamster Joint Council

to sanction the strike. This refusal
arose out of days past when Tham
and Berk were fighting to
represent the bargaining unit.
USE's good relations with the
United Farm Workers don't help
any, either.
Berk no doubt thought in the
event of a strike all would be
forgotten and the unions would

band together to fight the
"oppressive" management but
Tham pulled the rug out from
underneath him instead.
Teamsters have honored USE
picket lines this week more out of
sympathy than recognition of any
sanctioned USE strike.
Day to day operations settled
down by mid-week as the

University grew more adept and
tactful at dodging picket lines,
sometimes by bringing in supplies
in the wee hours of the morning.
The feared food service crisis
never materialized. University
officials misjudged the number of
students that would opt for the
rebates, and the huge turnout for
rebates, while averting the crisis,
cost a lot of money.
Students have banded together
to take care of their immediate
maintenance problems and their
classes have been, for the most
part, unaffected.
Student Support Limited
Student support for the strike
has been limited and confined to
familiar campus activists.
The student body is
unsurprisingly apathetic. While it
may grant the union token respect
for fighting the big, awesome
University, students have largely
adopted the role of the irate
consumer who has paid for his
goods and wants them delivered.
The lines for food rebates, and
the demands for similar rebates
for the maintenance and
housekeeping, students must now
do for themselves, bear this
contention out.

To the average student,
isolated and insulated in his
intellectual enclave, a labor strike
is a different animal — and not an
easy one to understand.
Research Stops
Long-range and sophisticated
research operations have all but
stopped. As the strike drags on,
the stoppage in these operations
will become more critical.
SLAC has already cut back its
experiment schedule and will
probably find it difficult to gear
up for any new experiments.
With the technicians absent,
the valuable time of scientists is
tied up in routine operational
details. The computation center is
also finding it difficult to handle
major programs and planned
expansion of computation
facilities is being delayed.
USE workers will soon be
entering their second week
without work and pay. They
won't feel it immediately since
workers will get their last
paychecks Wednesday if they are
processed on schedule.
Crunch Coming
Nevertheless, the economic
crunch will be squeezing them
hard and it will be no surprise
when some workers drift back to
work in the next week or two.
Over two-thirds of the unit is
out, however, and they won't be
coming back in large droves.
Thus action may, as a month
ago, be centered around the
negotiating table.
As times grows short (the
union can not maintain an
effective strike into summer very
easily), both sides will begin to
shift, from their previously
intransigent positions.
Both parties will move together
toward compromises.
These compromises will not
come overnight but will be ground
out in negotiating sessions during
the next few weeks.
The grievance procedure article
will be settled quietly, probably
in the next few sessions. It will be
the first major contract article to
be signed off.
The rest must come with time.

JIM BERK
United Stanford Employees
(USE) workers have been out five
days now.
Those five days have been
marked by considerable tactical
field maneuvering as USE
struggles to decisively disrupt
University operations.
As the week closes, signs
indicate that the two parties will
move their confrontations from
the streets to the bargaining table
and their conversations will begin
to generate more light than heat.
Service Employees
International Union organizer Bob
Anderson has replaced USE
President Jim Berk as field general
in charge of picket lines since he is
more experienced and tactful in
dealing with the delicate and
often painful situations that
constantly arise.

Berk has moved back to the
bargaining table where he will try
to provide direction to the union's
negotiating position.
Disorderly picketing will
subside, injunction or not, though
secondary boycotting will
continue. The union can probably
tie up the secondary boycotting
issue in enough legal knots to stall

for a while.
The University will not dismiss
the construction site picketing
lightly since the buildings are
badly needed and there is a lot of
money tied up in them.
The union suffered a
significant setback when Teamster
leader Rudy Tham refused to
allow Teamster Joint Council

to sanction the strike. This refusal
arose out of days past when Tham
and Berk were fighting to
represent the bargaining unit.
USE's good relations with the
United Farm Workers don't help
any, either.
Berk no doubt thought in the
event of a strike all would be
forgotten and the unions would

band together to fight the
"oppressive" management but
Tham pulled the rug out from
underneath him instead.
Teamsters have honored USE
picket lines this week more out of
sympathy than recognition of any
sanctioned USE strike.
Day to day operations settled
down by mid-week as the

University grew more adept and
tactful at dodging picket lines,
sometimes by bringing in supplies
in the wee hours of the morning.
The feared food service crisis
never materialized. University
officials misjudged the number of
students that would opt for the
rebates, and the huge turnout for
rebates, while averting the crisis,
cost a lot of money.
Students have banded together
to take care of their immediate
maintenance problems and their
classes have been, for the most
part, unaffected.
Student Support Limited
Student support for the strike
has been limited and confined to
familiar campus activists.
The student body is
unsurprisingly apathetic. While it
may grant the union token respect
for fighting the big, awesome
University, students have largely
adopted the role of the irate
consumer who has paid for his
goods and wants them delivered.
The lines for food rebates, and
the demands for similar rebates
for the maintenance and
housekeeping, students must now
do for themselves, bear this
contention out.

To the average student,
isolated and insulated in his
intellectual enclave, a labor strike
is a different animal — and not an
easy one to understand.
Research Stops
Long-range and sophisticated
research operations have all but
stopped. As the strike drags on,
the stoppage in these operations
will become more critical.
SLAC has already cut back its
experiment schedule and will
probably find it difficult to gear
up for any new experiments.
With the technicians absent,
the valuable time of scientists is
tied up in routine operational
details. The computation center is
also finding it difficult to handle
major programs and planned
expansion of computation
facilities is being delayed.
USE workers will soon be
entering their second week
without work and pay. They
won't feel it immediately since
workers will get their last
paychecks Wednesday if they are
processed on schedule.
Crunch Coming
Nevertheless, the economic
crunch will be squeezing them
hard and it will be no surprise
when some workers drift back to
work in the next week or two.
Over two-thirds of the unit is
out, however, and they won't be
coming back in large droves.
Thus action may, as a month
ago, be centered around the
negotiating table.
As times grows short (the
union can not maintain an
effective strike into summer very
easily), both sides will begin to
shift, from their previously
intransigent positions.
Both parties will move together
toward compromises.
These compromises will not
come overnight but will be ground
out in negotiating sessions during
the next few weeks.
The grievance procedure article
will be settled quietly, probably
in the next few sessions. It will be
the first major contract article to
be signed off.

The rest must come with time.
