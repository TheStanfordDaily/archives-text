# Watergate Claims Another This Victim From Stanford
## 
### 
Watergate claimed another
victim this week — this time on
the Stanford Board of Trustees.
Aerospace executive Thomas
V. Jones, who pleaded guilty two
weeks ago to making illegal
contributions to President Nixon's
re-election campaign, resigned
from the board in a personal letter
to Trustees President Robert Minge
Brown.
A terse statement issued under
Brown's name gave no reasons fo>"

Jones' resignation. But it was
anything but unexpected, coming
on the heels of his departure from
the boards of U.S. Steel, Wells
Fargo Bank and the Times-Mirror
Corp.
Jones, head of the Northrop
Corp., had arranged for $150,000
in corporate funds to be
contributed to the Finance
Committee for the Re-election of
the President, in violation of a
1940 law prohibitng campaign
contributions from major
government contractors.
His trustees resignation had
been demanded by the Daily, and
Palo Alto Times and Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R—Menlo Park,
among others.
As more information from the
Watergate Special Prosecutor's
investigation of Jones came to
light, it appeared more and
more likely that Jones was a small
fish caught in a much larger net.
Although he testified before a
federal grand jury, Jones was
never actually indicted. Instead,
he promptly offered a guilty plea
when the Special Prosecutor filed
charges against him in U.S.
District Court — raising

the possibility that he might have
pleaded guilty to a lesser charge in
exchange for co-operating with
the grand jury in another
investigation.
Tn addition, Jones was granted
permission to return before the
grand jury to recant — without
penalty — previous false
testimony he made.
What that seems to indicate is
that Jones cooperated in a grand
jury investigation of someone else,
perhaps an official of the Finance
Committee for the Re-election of
the President or some other Nixon
fundraiser.
Northrop spokesmen flatly
refused to comment on whether
Jones provided information to the
grand jury implicating someone
else, and Jones has been
unavailable for comment.
Similarly, spokesmen for the
prosecutors will not say if any
related matters are under further
investigation.
More information may never
be made public — or, if
indictments result from a further
inquiry, even fuller details may be
laid before the public. But for the
moment, the matter rests.


THOMAS V. JONES
