# Med School Problems Finally Surface
## 
### 
Medical school professors, gentlemen and
scholars all, rarely speak in public about
policy disputes and internal feuds.
Institutional conservatives, they all abhor
publicity; they evade questions or try to kill
news stories, rather than talk candidly about
educational problems. Almost to a man,
professors and administrators dissemble
rather than admit to shortcomings, and cover
dissension with a veneer of professional
courtesy and restraint. They apparently
worry about injuring the school's reputation,
hence lessening its ability to attract quality
faculty members and students.
Medical students quickly absorb the same
ethic; last week they tried to tone down a
Daily story on med school problems, and
persuaded regional media which inquired to
drop the story.
This policy may damage, not protect, the
school. It stifles free debate which could
stimulate constructive change; strengthens an
entrenched, conservative group of
policy-setters; aggravates infighting between
people and departments; and leaves the
school to wander without direction.

Anyway, the fact that problems emerged
openly last week perhaps best illustrates their
extraordinary dimensions. The Watergate
affair is limpid compared to recent
controversies at the medical school, but some
details did seep out at a meeting between 110
protesting medical students and Dean
Clayton Rich.
Publicly, leaders of the Stanford Medical
Students Association and individual students
complain that the school doesn't emphasize
or support clinical teaching. Although
medical reticence conceals much evidence,
students still present a persuasive
circumstantial case to buttress their claims.
They say Stanford has lost department
chairmen because of troubles at the school,
and now "leads the league" with six vacant
chairmanships;
—has failed to emphasize clinical care and
teaching quality in hiring, promotion, and
tenure decisions;
—has not offered high enough salaries to
attract and keep first-rank clinicians and
teachers, who often cannot obtain outside
grants as researchers can;

—has neglected and antagonized the staff
at affiliated hospitals, which provide most
clinical experience for Stanford students;
—does not provide enough support, in
beds and other facilities, for clinical teaching;
—and does not offer an incentive for
professors to see patients, instead of staying
in their offices or laboratories.
Rich admits that "traditionally, in this
school research has been weighted much
more heavily than teaching." But he says
Stanford has dramatically changed direction
in the past two years, and declares a personal
commitment to clinical teaching.
Privately, medical students and some
faculty members describe bleak prospects for
growth in clinical programs, and blame much
of the problem on Rich. Many students
clearly want a new dean; faculty sentiment is
almost impossible to accurately assess.
Rich's detractors claim he lacks
administrative experience, seems unable to
articulate and enforce clear policies, and has
yielded to the counsel of business-minded
subordinates who do not comprehend or care
about problems in clinical care.
