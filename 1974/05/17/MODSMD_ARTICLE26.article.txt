# 27 Months Of Losing
## Franklin: Still Waiting 
### 
It has now been 27 months
since H. Bruce Franklin was
dismissed from his post as a
Stanford English professor for
allegedly inciting students to
violence. He is still unemployed.
Although Franklin has been
offered a one semester fellowship
next year at prestigious Wesleyan
University, he has failed to find
regular employment at the
numerous institutions to which he
has applied. Most recently, the
University of Colorado trustees
voted not to hire him.
Franklin, an avowed Maoist,
believes that a conspiracy of
Stanford administrators and
conservative business interests
have aligned to prevent him from

earning a livelihood.
He insists that the English
departments of the schools of
which he has sought employment
are impressed with his academic
credentials as a noted Melville
scholar. Franklin claims that it is
the administrations and wealthy
alumni of the schools that are
blocking his appointment.
For example, he points out
that the English department at the
University of Colorado voted
overwhelmingly early this year to
hire him. Paul Levitt, chairman of
the Colorado English department,
told the Daily that "Franklin
would be a fine addition to our
department. -No one here
ncessarily agrees with Franklin's
political views but that is no
reason to prevent him from being
hired. We believe that he should
be judged on his academic
credentials alone."
Yet the board of regents at the
University of Colorado voted 8-1
on April 26 not to hire Franklin.
Regent Dale Ampkins stated
publicly that the hiring of
Franklin would be a dangerous

influence at the university. Even
regent Byron Johnson, reputedly
a liberal, reminded the board of
the campus violence of the late
1960s and warned that the hiring
of Franklin might help precipitate
a return of that era.
Meanwhile, Franklin rails
against the Stanford
administration, which he says is
"indulging in character
assassination in a vicious attempt
to keep me from earning a
livelihood."
The regents have acknowledged
receiving a packet of information
from an anonymous source, but
none of them have suggested that
it came from the Stanford
administration.
Both President Richard Lyman
and Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig have denied sending
such a packet.
Privately, one member of the
Stanford administration has noted
it would be to the
administration's advantage to have
Franklin hired by Colorado so he
would leave the area and stop
pestering the University.
But it would seem the case of
Franklin and the University of
Colorado is not closed. The
Academic Council voted 22-8 last
week to force the board to
reconsider voting again on the
Franklin decision.
According to Anita Sanchez,
co-president of the student body
at the University of Colorado,
either the American Civil Liberties
Union or the student government
will sue the board if it fails to hire
Franklin.
Meanwhile, Franklin continues
his litigations against Stanford for
his dismissal and laments the
"slanderous distortions" of his
case disseminated by his reputed
enemies.

against the Stanford
administration, which he says is
"indulging in character
assassination in a vicious attempt
to keep me from earning a
livelihood."
The regents have acknowledged
receiving a packet of information
from an anonymous source, but
none of them have suggested that
it came from the Stanford
administration.
Both President Richard Lyman
and Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig have denied sending
such a packet.
Privately, one member of the
Stanford administration has noted
it would be to the
administration's advantage to have
Franklin hired by Colorado so he
would leave the area and stop
pestering the University.
But it would seem the case of
Franklin and the University of
Colorado is not closed. The
Academic Council voted 22-8 last
week to force the board to
reconsider voting again on the
Franklin decision.
According to Anita Sanchez,
co-president of the student body
at the University of Colorado,
either the American Civil Liberties
Union or the student government
will sue the board if it fails to hire
Franklin.
Meanwhile, Franklin continues
his litigations against Stanford for
his dismissal and laments the
"slanderous distortions" of his
case disseminated by his reputed
enemies.


BRUCE FRANKLIN
It has now been 27 months
since H. Bruce Franklin was
dismissed from his post as a
Stanford English professor for
allegedly inciting students to
violence. He is still unemployed.
Although Franklin has been
offered a one semester fellowship
next year at prestigious Wesleyan
University, he has failed to find
regular employment at the
numerous institutions to which he
has applied. Most recently, the
University of Colorado trustees
voted not to hire him.
Franklin, an avowed Maoist,
believes that a conspiracy of
Stanford administrators and
conservative business interests
have aligned to prevent him from

earning a livelihood.
He insists that the English
departments of the schools of
which he has sought employment
are impressed with his academic
credentials as a noted Melville
scholar. Franklin claims that it is
the administrations and wealthy
alumni of the schools that are
blocking his appointment.
For example, he points out
that the English department at the
University of Colorado voted
overwhelmingly early this year to
hire him. Paul Levitt, chairman of
the Colorado English department,
told the Daily that "Franklin
would be a fine addition to our
department. -No one here
ncessarily agrees with Franklin's
political views but that is no
reason to prevent him from being
hired. We believe that he should
be judged on his academic
credentials alone."
Yet the board of regents at the
University of Colorado voted 8-1
on April 26 not to hire Franklin.
Regent Dale Ampkins stated
publicly that the hiring of
Franklin would be a dangerous

influence at the university. Even
regent Byron Johnson, reputedly
a liberal, reminded the board of
the campus violence of the late
1960s and warned that the hiring
of Franklin might help precipitate
a return of that era.
Meanwhile, Franklin rails
against the Stanford
administration, which he says is
"indulging in character
assassination in a vicious attempt
to keep me from earning a
livelihood."
