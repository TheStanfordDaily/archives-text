# Blues Singer Plays For Class
## Dave Alexander Sings Unique Blues Selection 
### DAN FORTE 
In this house there's a T.V. set showing pictures of dying
crops and hungry children that ain Y got any shoes.
This is the house that was built by the Blues.
Anyone can immediately recognize that pianist Dave
Alexander is not your average blues singer. Instead of
singing only about whiskey, women and money, the three
staples of most blues tunes, Alexander sings about riots,
race relations, and, as in "House Built By The Blues,"
dying crops.
The blues has always been one man's personal
expression of his everyday life; that aspect will never
change. But, the real-life things affecting the blues singer's
life have changed; from trains and Model T Fords to
airplanes and Buick Rivieras.
The title song from Alexander's latest Arhoolie LP, The
Dirt On The Ground, tells the story of a black cowboy in
an all-white town.
He was tall and lean, and he carried his saddle on his back;
And the people of the town looked at him with hate,

Because the man they saw was black.
Dave Alexander performed these and several other
selections Monday, May 13, to an audience of about 70
people as part of the "History of the Blues."
Another element separating Alexander from the
multitude of bluesmen is his varied repertoire. In fact, he
cannot be strictly classified as "blues," although he is
among the best at that style. Monday's set included such
non-blues items as "Bumble Boogie," Jerry Lee Lewis'
"Great Balls of Fire," and a beautiful arrangment of Nat
King Cole's "I Remember You."
Alexander's hands are at times awesome, most notably
on his fast boogie selections like "Pinetop's Boogie" and
"The Rattler," but also on the slow ballads. He is one of
the most versatile pianists on the "jazz-blues" scene today,
having played for years behind countless bluesmen, and in
a wide range of formats from 16-piece bands to solo
cocktail-piano bars.
Before playing "So You Want To Be A Man," his own
composition with a driving beat, Alexander said, "All

blues isn't slow and sad, some blues is jumpy and sad."
"The Day The Ravens Danced In the Street," which he
considers to be his most powerful composition by far, was
inspired by the death of his brother, and is based on
Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata."
Where were you when the ravens rapped and tapped on
my window pane?
Where were you when blood fell in the streets just like
rain?
Where were you when they rolled my brother's body out
to the burying ground?
Where were you when they laid his body six feet down?
A resident of the Bay Area for the past 17 years,
Alexander, now 36, can be heard every
Wednesday-Saturday at Minnie's Can-Do, 1915 Fillmore,
in the City. He and his trio will also be at San Jose State
Wednesday, May 22.
The next blues attraction coming to Stanford will be
harmonica player Charlie Musselwhite, Monday, May 27,
in Tresidder's Large Lounge.
