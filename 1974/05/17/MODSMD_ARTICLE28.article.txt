King Crimson
Starless And Bible Black
Atlantic SD 7298
King Crimson has always been
one of the most progressive rock
bands around, meaning that they
are constantly trying out new
musical forms and styles.
Not only is their music
constantly changing, so is their
personnel; in seven albums, the
group has changed seven times.
They do seem to be reaching some
stability, though.
The personnel on the latest
King Crimson album, Starless and
Bible Black, is very nearly the
same as on the album before,
Lark's Tongue In Aspic. It is
probably their strongest lineup
yet: David Cross on violin,
ex-Family member John Wetton
on bass and vocals, former Yes
drummer Bill Bruford, and the
man who holds it all together,
group founder and lead guitarist
Robert Fripp.
Starless is much in the style of
Lark's Tongue, making great use
of Cross' violin. It opens with
'The Great Deceiver," a harsh
rocker.
Another highlight of the first
side is the highly melodic "Night
Watch," which features some
beautiful guitarwork by Fripp.
Side 2 is entirely instrumental,
with the title cut and "Fracture."
"Starless and Bible Black" is
largely improvisation and sounds
like free-form music. "Fracture"
is especially ftne, and is highly
reminiscent of "Lark's Tongue In
Aspic Part II."
Unlike many progressive bands,

the members of King Crimson
know exactly what they are
doing. Drummer Bruford says,
"You largely go through groups
thinking 'Well, this lot's alright
but it only uses major seventh
chords and I want to be in a group
that uses ninths and you get in
another group and you're thinking
ahead to a group that uses
thirteenths .. . but this group uses
everything that I know about
music."
With regards to their latest
music, he says, "We have no idea
how people are going to react,
everyone might run out of the
concert halls screaming. As far as I
know, they may hate us." While
this reviewer doubts that any fans
will run out screaming, some may
fall asleep.
You see, if there is a problem
with the music of King Crimson,
it is that it almost grows
monotonous at times. In a review
of the Crimson album Islands,
Lester Bangs wrote "... it has a
tendency to put you asleep in the
tenderest, most sanguine
way .. . Islands wins the Award of
the Month, and perhaps of the
year, for Best Record To Be Put
On Before Retiring."
With Lark's Tongue in Aspic,
one of the finest albums to be
released last year, King Crimson
overcame the above-stated
tendency. However, Starless is
another album in contention for
Best Record To Be Put On Before
Retiring. While the album starts
out with a couple steamers, the
second half of it is badly in need
of a song such as "Easy Money"

on Lark's Tongue, a song that will
liven things up a bit.
While Starless is not quite up to
the superb standards set by Lark's
Tongue, it is a fine record and
should please Crimson fans.

Lynyrd Skynyrd
Second Helping
MCA-413
It was said after the Civil War
that "the South will rise again,"
and about 110 years later, it has,
at least musically. Lynyrd
Skynyrd is the latest group to
follow along the path cleared out
of the South to national
recognition by the Allman
Brothers.
Second Helping is the
seven-man group's second album,
and it's a right tasty package
indeed, with eight songs (seven
original), extolling the virtues of
Alabama, hound dogs, elderly
black bluesmen and good
whiskey.
None of the songs are
pretentious or boring, and the
instrumental work and arranging
are first-rate, thanks to proudcer
A 1 Kooper, whose musical
influence dates back to his
performing days in the Blues
Project 10 years ago.
Kooper also helps out a bit on
piano and guitar, but the main
guitar load is carried equally by
Gary Rossington, Allen Collins
and Ed King. The licks of this trio
are tastier than a pan of red-eye
gravy, and as crisp as a fresh
hushpuppy.
Ronnie Van Zant handles all
the lead vocals, and is co-author

on all lyrics. His singing is like his
writing, straight forward no
nonsense and no gimmicks.
That seems to be the spirit in
which the group approached this
second album, and why some
reviewers gave the band such high
marks in its Winterland
performances May 3-4. For those
who missed them then, Lynyrd
Skynyrd will be back at
Winterland Friday and Saturday,
second billed to the Kinks.
At the rate Lynyrd Skynyrd is
progressing, though, it won't be
long until they have top spot on
concert billings. Already, two of
the cuts from Second Helping,
"Sweet Home Alabama," and a
speeded-up, harder-edged version
of J.J. Cale's "Call Me The
Breeze," are receiving extensive
airplay.
The other six songs on the
album are equally interesting,
though, as the group sings about
signing their contract with MCA,
being bothered by fans' questions,
or the dangers of cocaine and
heroin.
These may be trite topics in
that they all have been done
before, but then speculation
about the extent of Nixon's
Watergate involvement is also
trite.
A fresh approach can do
wonders for overworked topics,
provided it's done with openness
and candor, and Second Helping
certainly proves that the state of
modern Southern music is
infinitely healthier than that of
the Nixon Administration.

PROGRESSIVE ROCK—King Crimson just released their seventh album, Starless and Bible Black.
Although at times it seems to grow a little bit unexciting, the album on the whole is quite good. King
Crftnson will be appearing in the Bay Area on June 13 along with Ten Years After and the Strawbs at the
cSv Palace. Although King Crimson has gone through many personnel changes, the present group looks as
if is here to stay. Composed of former Yes drummer Bill Bruford, David Cross, John Wetton and Robert
Frljpp, the group has put together its own unique sound.
