# 'Express': Movie Based On Truth
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
The Sugarland Express, a film
about a pair of rather young and
naive fugitives from American
justice, has been said to have a lot
common with Badlands.
True, both take place in
mid-America, where the car is the
main way to get across endless
stretches of open land, and in
each movie one of the fugitives
plays the dominant role in the
exploit.
But in The Sugarland Express it
is the female, Lou Jean Poplin
(Goldie Hawn) who controls the
escapade as surely as Martin Sheen
did in Badlands.
The escapade which forms the
basis for The Sugarland Express is
the hijacking of a police car. It's
.iijacked by Lou Jean and her
husband Clovis (William

Atherton) in an attempt to get
their child back from the custody
of an adoptive family.
The Texas state welfare agency
had placed the child with a family
in Sugarland, Texas, after
determining that Lou Jean and
Clovis were unfit parents, since
both had jail records and seemed
unable to support the child
properly.
Lou Jean is forced to relinquish
custody of the baby, but after
signing the necessary papers,
decides that was the wrong thing
to do and conceives of a plan to
spring her husband from jail (with
only four months remaining on
his sentence), get the baby in
Sugarland, then flee to Mexico.
Many complications ensue, the
couple panic and are chased by a
young Texas state patrolman. But

Lou Jean turns the tables on him,
and they commandeer Officer
Slide's car and hold Slide (Michael
Sacks) hostage all the way to
Sugarland.
First-time director Steven
Speilberg got the idea for this
strange cops and hijackers plot
from an actual event reported in a
newspaper, as Badlands derived
from the Charles Starkweather
killings of 1958. But where
Badlands is a romantic fantasy —
them against us, The Sugarland
Express takes a more serio-comic,
and eventually more tragic look at
both hunters and hunted.
Audience interest remains
equally divided between police
and fugitives throughout the film
due to the presence of Academy
Award winner {The Last Picture
Show) Ben Johnson, who

portrays Sacks' superior, Captain
Tanner.
Johnson is at his best when
playing men of high principles and
granite-like integrity, tempered
with worldy-wise human
compassion that shows in every
line of his weather-beaten face.
Captain Tanner is such a person,
proud of being able to enforce the
law in his 18 years on the force
without ever killing a person.
When Johnson says those lines,
you really react in a visceral,
sympathetic way.
It's also easy to like Officer
Slide and Lou Jean and Clovis, for
their fresh, willful, even immature
approach to life, and to watch a
bond form between the captive
and the captors, much like the
prisoner-guard relationship that
developed in The Last Detail.
With fine acting in the four
major roles, and some arresting
cameo glimpses of all sorts of
Texas folks — winos, gas station
operators, strait-laced American
Gothic parents — director
Speilberg has crafted a fast-paced,
entertaining movie.
The film does have some minor
flaws, like over-reliance on long
shots of highways filled with
police cars pursuing the hijacked
vehicle at a safe distance, and
overly-arty editing which detracts
from the low-key ending.
Overall, though, The Sugar land
Express is a promising first film
that says a lot about the confusing
circumstances of modern life in a
realistic, thoughtful yet
entertaining way.

and fugitives throughout the film
due to the presence of Academy
Award winner {The Last Picture
Show) Ben Johnson, who

portrays Sacks' superior, Captain
Tanner.
Johnson is at his best when
playing men of high principles and
granite-like integrity, tempered
with worldy-wise human
compassion that shows in every
line of his weather-beaten face.
Captain Tanner is such a person,
proud of being able to enforce the
law in his 18 years on the force
without ever killing a person.
When Johnson says those lines,
you really react in a visceral,
sympathetic way.
It's also easy to like Officer
Slide and Lou Jean and Clovis, for
their fresh, willful, even immature
approach to life, and to watch a
bond form between the captive
and the captors, much like the
prisoner-guard relationship that
developed in The Last Detail.
With fine acting in the four
major roles, and some arresting
cameo glimpses of all sorts of
Texas folks — winos, gas station
operators, strait-laced American
Gothic parents — director
Speilberg has crafted a fast-paced,
entertaining movie.
The film does have some minor
flaws, like over-reliance on long
shots of highways filled with
police cars pursuing the hijacked
vehicle at a safe distance, and
overly-arty editing which detracts
from the low-key ending.
Overall, though, The Sugar land
Express is a promising first film
that says a lot about the confusing
circumstances of modern life in a
realistic, thoughtful yet
entertaining way.

GETTING HlGH—Elton John, in a span of only four years, has risen from virtual obscurity to
superstardom. This phenomena of the recording industry will be examined tonight on'Elton John and
Bernie Taupin Say Goodbye Norma Jean and Other Things. ..at 11:30 on channel 7. The documentary
follows Elton abroad and at home: to America for his hysteria evoking performance at the Hollywood
Bowl; to the Chateau in France where he records his records; and to his home in Surrey. Elton John has
sold more records than the Rolling Stones, and his American tours guarantee him a minimum of $3
million dollars even before they're begun.
The Sugarland Express, a film
about a pair of rather young and
naive fugitives from American
justice, has been said to have a lot
common with Badlands.
True, both take place in
mid-America, where the car is the
main way to get across endless
stretches of open land, and in
each movie one of the fugitives
plays the dominant role in the
exploit.
But in The Sugarland Express it
is the female, Lou Jean Poplin
(Goldie Hawn) who controls the
escapade as surely as Martin Sheen
did in Badlands.
The escapade which forms the
basis for The Sugarland Express is
the hijacking of a police car. It's
.iijacked by Lou Jean and her
husband Clovis (William

Atherton) in an attempt to get
their child back from the custody
of an adoptive family.
The Texas state welfare agency
had placed the child with a family
in Sugarland, Texas, after
determining that Lou Jean and
Clovis were unfit parents, since
both had jail records and seemed
unable to support the child
properly.
Lou Jean is forced to relinquish
custody of the baby, but after
signing the necessary papers,
decides that was the wrong thing
to do and conceives of a plan to
spring her husband from jail (with
only four months remaining on
his sentence), get the baby in
Sugarland, then flee to Mexico.
Many complications ensue, the
couple panic and are chased by a
young Texas state patrolman. But

Lou Jean turns the tables on him,
and they commandeer Officer
Slide's car and hold Slide (Michael
Sacks) hostage all the way to
Sugarland.
First-time director Steven
Speilberg got the idea for this
strange cops and hijackers plot
from an actual event reported in a
newspaper, as Badlands derived
from the Charles Starkweather
killings of 1958. But where
Badlands is a romantic fantasy —
them against us, The Sugarland
Express takes a more serio-comic,
and eventually more tragic look at
both hunters and hunted.
Audience interest remains
equally divided between police
and fugitives throughout the film
due to the presence of Academy
Award winner {The Last Picture
Show) Ben Johnson, who

portrays Sacks' superior, Captain
Tanner.
Johnson is at his best when
