# Democrat Faces Tough Odds
## Skornia Seeks Congressional Seat 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Thomas Skornia has no illusions about his
chances of winning a seat in Congress.
He admits that he is facing tough competition
from three opponents in the Democratic primary
race in the 12th Congressional District, which
includes Stanford.
Seated in his spacious Palo Alto law office
overlooking the Stanford campus, Skornia discussed
his campaign.
Explaining that he entered the race because Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey, R-Menlo Park, may lose the
GOP primary, Skornia predicted he could win easily
against Atherton businessman J. Gordon Knapp,
McCloskey's leading opponent.
"I don't think my prospects would be very bright
if I ran against McCloskey," Skornia conceded. "He
has consistently appealed to liberal Democrats.
There have been crossovers to McCloskey by
Democrats in the past and these crossovers appear
to be repeatable."
Emphasize Economics
Skornia claimed the only way he could win
against McCloskey would be to emphasize economic
issues in a time of recession.
Although Skornia said he is not sure if McCloskey
would lose the primary, he emphasized that if Ford
becomes President he will probably offer McCloskey
a choice administrative post.
Skornia did not hesitate to admit that he is

running partly on the hope that such an event will
occur.
"With McCloskey running I'm a long shot
candidate," he mused. "But a series of long shots
can add up to an intermediate shot."
Skornia said that inflation seems to bo the main
issue among voters to whom he has spoken. As a
response to the problems of inflation and
unemployment, he says he favors a return to the
"Keynesian economics" of the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations.
Price Controls
Unlike most of the six other candidates running
in the 12th Congressional District, Skornia said he
does not favor a balanced budget. He believes in
wage and price controls.
But Skornia said he is opposed to controls as long
as Nixon remains in office. 'This Administration
has proven that it cannot be trusted with controls,"
he said.
Another main focus of Skornia's campaign is the
restoration of power to Congress.
"Congress cannot obtain complete control of the
economy vis a vis the President, but it can have far
more impact than it has had in recent years," he
said.
Skornia claims a unique feature of his campaign is
his emphasis on women's rights. He has repeatedly
told political rallies that any issue ithat affects 53

percent of the voters cannot be ignored.
"Every candidate purports to favor equal rights
for women but I am the only candidate who is
taking the risk of alienating older men by taking a
forthright position on the matter," he said.
Skornia is proud that he is the only candidate in
the district who has received the endorsement of the
National Women's Political Caucus.
Glancing at a large bust of John Kennedy on his
desk, he compared his emphasis on women's rights
to Kennedy's willingness to speak out on civil rights
in 1960.
Skornia noted that he favors the retention of a
volunteer army and is opposed to the draft. But he
stated that if over a long period of time the
volunteer army should prove inefficient or
unrepresentative of the population, Congress might

want to study reinstitution of the draft.
Skornia declared that he is skeptical of reports
that call the volunteer army a failure, suggesting
that they are written by people who favor the draft.
Skornia has refused to limit his campaign
spending to any fixed amount, but claimed that the
$50,000 he intends to spend will be less than
McCloskey or Larry Spitters, one of his Democratic
opponents, will use.
Campaign Reform
He expressed approval of Proposition 9, which
would provide for reform of campaign spending
laws.
Skornia said that most of his campaign tactics are
geared toward establishing better name recognition
among voters.
"I am perplexed that the great voter influence is
name recognition," Skornia remarked. "It is not a

rational basis on which to make an electoral
decision."
Skornia said he would prefer more discussion of
issues and less emphasis upon "purchased visibility"
in the campaign.
Most of his campaign expenses involve newspaper
and radio advertisements and leaflets that are sent
to the 86,000 Democratic households in the district.
"I'm not spending anything for television because
it is frightfully expensive," Skornia commented.
"Besides, I would reach two million in the Bay
Area" rather than just the voters in the district.
A graduate of Grinell College and Harvard Law
School, Skornia is a partner in the Palo Alto firm of
Skornia, Rosenblum and Gyemant. In the 1960s he
served as special attorney in the U.S. Justice
Department and marched in a civil rights
demonstration in Selma in 1965.

desk, he compared his emphasis on women's rights
to Kennedy's willingness to speak out on civil rights
in 1960.
Skornia noted that he favors the retention of a
volunteer army and is opposed to the draft. But he
stated that if over a long period of time the
volunteer army should prove inefficient or
unrepresentative of the population, Congress might

want to study reinstitution of the draft.
Skornia declared that he is skeptical of reports
that call the volunteer army a failure, suggesting
that they are written by people who favor the draft.
Skornia has refused to limit his campaign
spending to any fixed amount, but claimed that the
$50,000 he intends to spend will be less than
McCloskey or Larry Spitters, one of his Democratic
opponents, will use.
Campaign Reform
He expressed approval of Proposition 9, which
would provide for reform of campaign spending
laws.
Skornia said that most of his campaign tactics are
geared toward establishing better name recognition
among voters.
"I am perplexed that the great voter influence is
name recognition," Skornia remarked. "It is not a

rational basis on which to make an electoral
decision."
Skornia said he would prefer more discussion of
issues and less emphasis upon "purchased visibility"
in the campaign.
Most of his campaign expenses involve newspaper
and radio advertisements and leaflets that are sent
to the 86,000 Democratic households in the district.
"I'm not spending anything for television because
it is frightfully expensive," Skornia commented.
"Besides, I would reach two million in the Bay
Area" rather than just the voters in the district.
A graduate of Grinell College and Harvard Law
School, Skornia is a partner in the Palo Alto firm of
Skornia, Rosenblum and Gyemant. In the 1960s he
served as special attorney in the U.S. Justice
Department and marched in a civil rights
demonstration in Selma in 1965.
Thomas Skornia has no illusions about his
chances of winning a seat in Congress.
He admits that he is facing tough competition
from three opponents in the Democratic primary
race in the 12th Congressional District, which
includes Stanford.
Seated in his spacious Palo Alto law office
overlooking the Stanford campus, Skornia discussed
his campaign.
Explaining that he entered the race because Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey, R-Menlo Park, may lose the
GOP primary, Skornia predicted he could win easily
against Atherton businessman J. Gordon Knapp,
McCloskey's leading opponent.
"I don't think my prospects would be very bright
if I ran against McCloskey," Skornia conceded. "He
has consistently appealed to liberal Democrats.
There have been crossovers to McCloskey by
Democrats in the past and these crossovers appear
to be repeatable."
Emphasize Economics
Skornia claimed the only way he could win
against McCloskey would be to emphasize economic
issues in a time of recession.
Although Skornia said he is not sure if McCloskey
would lose the primary, he emphasized that if Ford
becomes President he will probably offer McCloskey
a choice administrative post.
Skornia did not hesitate to admit that he is

running partly on the hope that such an event will
occur.
"With McCloskey running I'm a long shot
candidate," he mused. "But a series of long shots
can add up to an intermediate shot."
Skornia said that inflation seems to bo the main
issue among voters to whom he has spoken. As a
response to the problems of inflation and
unemployment, he says he favors a return to the
"Keynesian economics" of the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations.
Price Controls
Unlike most of the six other candidates running
in the 12th Congressional District, Skornia said he
does not favor a balanced budget. He believes in
wage and price controls.
But Skornia said he is opposed to controls as long
as Nixon remains in office. 'This Administration
has proven that it cannot be trusted with controls,"
he said.
Another main focus of Skornia's campaign is the
restoration of power to Congress.
"Congress cannot obtain complete control of the
economy vis a vis the President, but it can have far
more impact than it has had in recent years," he
said.
Skornia claims a unique feature of his campaign is
his emphasis on women's rights. He has repeatedly
told political rallies that any issue ithat affects 53

percent of the voters cannot be ignored.
"Every candidate purports to favor equal rights
for women but I am the only candidate who is
taking the risk of alienating older men by taking a
forthright position on the matter," he said.
Skornia is proud that he is the only candidate in
the district who has received the endorsement of the
National Women's Political Caucus.

issues in a time of recession.
Although Skornia said he is not sure if McCloskey
would lose the primary, he emphasized that if Ford
becomes President he will probably offer McCloskey
a choice administrative post.
Skornia did not hesitate to admit that he is

running partly on the hope that such an event will
occur.
"With McCloskey running I'm a long shot
candidate," he mused. "But a series of long shots
can add up to an intermediate shot."
Skornia said that inflation seems to bo the main
issue among voters to whom he has spoken. As a
response to the problems of inflation and
unemployment, he says he favors a return to the
"Keynesian economics" of the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations.
Price Controls
Unlike most of the six other candidates running
in the 12th Congressional District, Skornia said he
does not favor a balanced budget. He believes in
wage and price controls.
But Skornia said he is opposed to controls as long
as Nixon remains in office. 'This Administration
has proven that it cannot be trusted with controls,"
he said.
Another main focus of Skornia's campaign is the
restoration of power to Congress.
"Congress cannot obtain complete control of the
economy vis a vis the President, but it can have far
more impact than it has had in recent years," he
said.
Skornia claims a unique feature of his campaign is
his emphasis on women's rights. He has repeatedly
told political rallies that any issue ithat affects 53

percent of the voters cannot be ignored.
"Every candidate purports to favor equal rights
for women but I am the only candidate who is
taking the risk of alienating older men by taking a
forthright position on the matter," he said.
Skornia is proud that he is the only candidate in
the district who has received the endorsement of the
National Women's Political Caucus.
Glancing at a large bust of John Kennedy on his
desk, he compared his emphasis on women's rights
to Kennedy's willingness to speak out on civil rights
in 1960.
Skornia noted that he favors the retention of a
volunteer army and is opposed to the draft. But he
stated that if over a long period of time the
volunteer army should prove inefficient or
unrepresentative of the population, Congress might

want to study reinstitution of the draft.
Skornia declared that he is skeptical of reports
that call the volunteer army a failure, suggesting
that they are written by people who favor the draft.
Skornia has refused to limit his campaign
spending to any fixed amount, but claimed that the
$50,000 he intends to spend will be less than
McCloskey or Larry Spitters, one of his Democratic
opponents, will use.
Campaign Reform
He expressed approval of Proposition 9, which
would provide for reform of campaign spending
laws.
Skornia said that most of his campaign tactics are
geared toward establishing better name recognition
among voters.
"I am perplexed that the great voter influence is
name recognition," Skornia remarked. "It is not a

rational basis on which to make an electoral
decision."
Skornia said he would prefer more discussion of
issues and less emphasis upon "purchased visibility"
in the campaign.
Most of his campaign expenses involve newspaper
and radio advertisements and leaflets that are sent
to the 86,000 Democratic households in the district.
"I'm not spending anything for television because
it is frightfully expensive," Skornia commented.
"Besides, I would reach two million in the Bay
Area" rather than just the voters in the district.
A graduate of Grinell College and Harvard Law
School, Skornia is a partner in the Palo Alto firm of
Skornia, Rosenblum and Gyemant. In the 1960s he
served as special attorney in the U.S. Justice
Department and marched in a civil rights
demonstration in Selma in 1965.
