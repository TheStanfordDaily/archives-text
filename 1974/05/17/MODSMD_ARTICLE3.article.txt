# Democrat Faces Tough Odds
## Skornia Seeks Congressional Seat 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Thomas Skornia has no illusions about his
chances of winning a seat in Congress.
He admits that he is facing tough competition
from three opponents in the Democratic primary
race in the 12th Congressional District, which
includes Stanford.
Seated in his spacious Palo Alto law office
overlooking the Stanford campus, Skornia discussed
his campaign.
Explaining that he entered the race because Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey, R-Menlo Park, may lose the
GOP primary, Skornia predicted he could win easily
against Atherton businessman J. Gordon Knapp,
McCloskey's leading opponent.
"I don't think my prospects would be very bright
if I ran against McCloskey," Skornia conceded. "He
has consistently appealed to liberal Democrats.
There have been crossovers to McCloskey by
Democrats in the past and these crossovers appear
to be repeatable."
Emphasize Economics
Skornia claimed the only way he could win
against McCloskey would be to emphasize economic
issues in a time of recession.
Although Skornia said he is not sure if McCloskey
would lose the primary, he emphasized that if Ford
becomes President he will probably offer McCloskey
a choice administrative post.
Skornia did not hesitate to admit that he is

running partly on the hope that such an event will
occur.
"With McCloskey running I'm a long shot
candidate," he mused. "But a series of long shots
can add up to an intermediate shot."
Skornia said that inflation seems to bo the main
issue among voters to whom he has spoken. As a
response to the problems of inflation and
unemployment, he says he favors a return to the
"Keynesian economics" of the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations.
Price Controls
Unlike most of the six other candidates running
in the 12th Congressional District, Skornia said he
does not favor a balanced budget. He believes in
wage and price controls.
But Skornia said he is opposed to controls as long
as Nixon remains in office. 'This Administration
has proven that it cannot be trusted with controls,"
he said.
Another main focus of Skornia's campaign is the
restoration of power to Congress.
"Congress cannot obtain complete control of the
economy vis a vis the President, but it can have far
more impact than it has had in recent years," he
said.
Skornia claims a unique feature of his campaign is
his emphasis on women's rights. He has repeatedly
told political rallies that any issue ithat affects 53
