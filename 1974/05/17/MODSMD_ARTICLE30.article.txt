# Ahmad Jamal Performs Fine Jazz Despite Tough Scheduling, Long Night
## 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO—WhiIe the
engagements of most big-name
rock groups are usually two or
three nights of a weekend with
one show each night in a large
auditorium or dance hall, the jazz
musician's gig usually (in a city
like San Francisco) begins on
Tuesday and ends on Sunday with
three shows a night.
The clubs range from posh
supper clubs to rundown coffee
houses, but usually seat no more
than 200 people at most, not
always comfortably. As jazz'
resident cynic Mose Allison once
said:
I'm gonna be here through
Sunday evening, be someplace
else on Tuesday night.
If I get home with all my money,
everything will be all right.
The crowd left over by
Sunday's last show consists
usually of hard-core jazz buffs and
straggling drunks — not very many
of either.
The point of all this is that by
Sunday night a musician is
undoubtedly quite tired, but some
jazzmen, like pianist Ahmad
Jamal, after a particularly
successful gig, put on some of
their best shows on such
occasions.
While the first two shows often
consist of standards and recent
hits, the "after hours" sessions are
reserved for unpretentious
jamming and experimenting with
new ideas.
Ahmad Jamal stepped onto the
stage at Keystone Korner Sunday
night. May 12, at 1:00, sat down
at the baby-grand piano, and
wasted no time in getting into
some of the most downright
beautiful music on the scene
today.
Jamal's trio, with bassist Jamil

Nasser and drummer Frank Gant,
has been considered by some to
be the definitive group of modern
jazz since the early 50s.
While the term "modern jazz"
has come to encompass everything
from the classically-oriented
compositions of the Modern Jazz
Quartet to the rock-ish style of
Mahavishnu John McLaughlin to
the Brazilian bossa nova of
Antonio Carlos Jobim to the
screaming and babbling of the Art
Ensemble of Chicago, Ahmad
Jamal seems to combine the two
essentials of jazz, freedom and
rhythm for the optimal results.
His precise piano technique is
comparable to that of a concert
pianist; his ideas never stop. He
and his sidemen have the ability
to freely, but intelligently,
improvise on a theme, without
launching into outer space.
This was especially evident on
their first selection, which lasted
twenty minutes. Throughout the
song, Jamal would repeatedly
return to the original theme as if
to remind the listener, "Yes, we
still know what song we're

playing."
The trio was augmented by
Azzedin Weston on congas, who
was featured in a splendid solo on
this tune.
After a lengthy, powerful solo
on the baby-grand,. Jamal stood
up, with shouts of
encouragement, to add a few
extra touches with the electric
piano. It is a credit to Ahmad
Jamal that he is one of the very
few (including perhaps Bill Evans
and Vince Guaraldi) who can
make an electric piano sound like
a musical instrument, instead of a
toy.

Jamal's second and last number
of the set was a bit shorter, only
fifteen minutes, and featured
solos by Gant and Nasser.
Gant's solo was basically sheer
brute force, while Nasser's was
sheer beauty; he is one of the most
melodic bassists around — he
doesn't play riffs, he composes
melodies.
The Ahmad Jama! Trio will
appear Friday, May 17, at the
Berkeley Jazz Festival in the
Greek Theater.
This week Keystone Korner
features bassist Ron Carter's
all-star quartet.
