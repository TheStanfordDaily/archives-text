# Glee Club Concert
## 
### 
The Stanford Glee Club, under the direction
of Robert MacKinnon, will present both
classical and modern music in its annual Spring
Concert in Dinkelspiel Auditorium tomorrow
night.
The 60 voice Glee Club is backed during the
second half of the concert by a 21 piece
orchestra.
Tomorrow's concert will feature traditional
works by Thomas Morley, Handel, Debussy,
Brahms, Bartok, and Lassus.
The second half of the concert will feature
foot-stomping show tunes from Mame, Man of
La Mancha, and Pippin. Also included will be
Paul Stucky's "Wedding Song," and "Moonlight
Madonna," a 1930s hit.
The concert will also feature the Axidentals,
an all-male singing group chosen from among

the ranks of the Glee Club. The Axidentals
specialize in barbershop and other novelty
songs, and will present "Say, Mister, Have You
Seen Rosie's Sister."
Members of the orchestra will form a jazz
combo and present an innovative version of the
standard, "Autumn Leaves."
Soloists with the Glee Club are Nancy Duffy
in "Corner of the Sky," Valerie Roelfsema in
"Secret Gardens," and Dan Kolkey in "Cheatin'
On Me."
The entire orchestra will be featured
performing "Opening Act II," director
MacKinnon's original composition.
Tickets for the Glee Club concert are
available at Tresidder Ticket Office and at the
door. Admission is $1 for students, and $2
general. The concert begins at 8 p.m.
