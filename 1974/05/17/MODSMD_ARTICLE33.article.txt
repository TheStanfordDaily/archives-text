# Aikido Master On Campus

### CHRIS BAKER 
"What's going on here, a
religious service?" asked an
incredulous physical education
student who wandered into
Encina Gym yesterday at noon.
From the looks of things it
might well have been a Shinto
service, for in the center of the
room was an altar with flowers
surrounding it and a lot of
candles. But no, the strike has not
moved services into the gym.
Instead, the Stanford Aikido Club
had transformed the drab confines
of the mat room into a "Dojo" in
honor of its special instructor,
Michio Hitkitsuchi, from Shingu,
Japan.
Hitkitsuchi, one of the two
living tenth degree black belts in
the world, is visiting the Bay Area
for six weeks to teach the
fundamentals of aikido.
His visit to Stanford was the
first of four weekly sessions. This
weekend he will welcome about
60 Bay Area aikido enthusiasts to
the Farm for a two day
"Gasshuku" — an intensive aikido
training workshop.
"Everyone who practices aikido
should be one who leads the way,
one who purifies the world," said
Hitkitsuchi.
He taught the elementary
techniques of aikido along with a
few basic movements, but still had
to warn the enthusiasts, "careful
or you'll break your partner up."
Mary Heiny, Stanford's aikido
instructor and student at
Hitkitsuchi's Dojo for six years,
said, "The movements were basic,
but he did add a few advanced
moves."
"What he tried to show was the
taking of your partner's strength
"I was impressed with three
things about this group," said
Hitkitsuchi. 'The beautiful
shomen, their hard work and their
qualified teachers," he added.
"This is one of the most
dedicated clubs I've visited," he
said. "Now if they can just put a
little technique into it they'll be
perfect."
Aikido began in 1928 when
O-Sensei invented it. Aikido is
closely tied to the shinto religion
and it draws much of it's custom
from the sect. The art emphasizes
power points of the body. These
points are used to disarm your
opponent.
Hitkitsuchi was the first person
to be commissioned as a teacher
of aikido.

had transformed the drab confines
of the mat room into a "Dojo" in
honor of its special instructor,
Michio Hitkitsuchi, from Shingu,
Japan.
Hitkitsuchi, one of the two
living tenth degree black belts in
the world, is visiting the Bay Area
for six weeks to teach the
fundamentals of aikido.
His visit to Stanford was the
first of four weekly sessions. This
weekend he will welcome about
60 Bay Area aikido enthusiasts to
the Farm for a two day
"Gasshuku" — an intensive aikido
training workshop.
"Everyone who practices aikido
should be one who leads the way,
one who purifies the world," said
Hitkitsuchi.
He taught the elementary
techniques of aikido along with a
few basic movements, but still had
to warn the enthusiasts, "careful
or you'll break your partner up."
Mary Heiny, Stanford's aikido
instructor and student at
Hitkitsuchi's Dojo for six years,
said, "The movements were basic,
but he did add a few advanced
moves."
"What he tried to show was the
taking of your partner's strength
"I was impressed with three
things about this group," said
Hitkitsuchi. 'The beautiful
shomen, their hard work and their
qualified teachers," he added.
"This is one of the most
dedicated clubs I've visited," he
said. "Now if they can just put a
little technique into it they'll be
perfect."
Aikido began in 1928 when
O-Sensei invented it. Aikido is
closely tied to the shinto religion
and it draws much of it's custom
from the sect. The art emphasizes
power points of the body. These
points are used to disarm your
opponent.
Hitkitsuchi was the first person
to be commissioned as a teacher
of aikido.

READY TO FALL — Michio Hitkitsuchi, one of the two living tenth
degree black belts in the world, gave some special instruction to
members of the aikido club yesterday. Hitkitsuchi will also host a
"Gasshuku" — intensive aikido training session — here this weekend.
"What's going on here, a
religious service?" asked an
incredulous physical education
student who wandered into
Encina Gym yesterday at noon.
From the looks of things it
might well have been a Shinto
service, for in the center of the
room was an altar with flowers
surrounding it and a lot of
candles. But no, the strike has not
moved services into the gym.
Instead, the Stanford Aikido Club
had transformed the drab confines
of the mat room into a "Dojo" in

Michio Hitkitsuchi, from Shingu,
