# IM Roundup Track Finals
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
Bill Johnson of the BSU
shattered the meet record in the
70 yd. Intermediate hurdles to
lead qualifiers into the finals of
the IM Track Meet tomorrow.
Johnson was clocked in 7.9
seconds for the distance, a full
half-second below the existing
standard set by Twain's Pat
Crandall last year.
Johnson's record performance
was typical for the BSU which
qualified first into the finals in
every event except the 440 and
the 50-yard dash. Ben Knight of
JRA topped the quarter qualifiers
at 51.2 while Theta Delt's Shaun
Sullivan and Biz I's Reynaud
Moore topped the 50 at 5.7.
Other top BSU runners
included Reggie Sanderson at 10.3
in the 100 and Greg Florant at
23.0 in the 220. Earl Bohn also
clocked 10.3 and 23.1 for BSU.
In finals held last Saturday,
Steve Sidney of the Med School
took the two-mile in a relatively
slow 9:50.6. John Ferguson of the
Debits was second and the only
other finisher under 10:00 at
9:56.0.
In other events, Jim Buser
repeated as the long jump
champion with a leap of 22' 91/2".
Frank Kuljian of Branner was the
day's other winner with a 42'14"
heave in the shot put.
Finals will be held tomorrow in
all other events. The meet,
beginning at 1 p.m. will have a
different order of events from last
week. The 440 relay will begin the
day followed consecutively by the
70 yd. hurdles, 50, mile run, 100,
120 yd. hurdles, 880 relay, 880,
440, 220 and mile relay. The
triple jump and high jump will be
at 1:00 and 2:1(5 respectively.
