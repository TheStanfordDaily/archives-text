# Cards, Trojans Co-Favored
## Pac-8 Golf Opens Today 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Slovenly Craig Stadler, smooth Peter Jacobsen,
',eady Dave Baskins and stoic Mark Pfeil are
expected to battle for the individual title, but USC
and Stanford are emphasizing the team competition
this weekend as the Cards host the 15th annual
Pacific Eight golf championships on the Stanford
course.
Stadler, the reigning U.S. Amateur champion, is
the antithesis of those well-groomed country club
6 olfers you see in Sears Men Store ads. In fact
ABC-TV producer Chuck Howard screamed in
disgust as Stadler waited to putt during a pro tour
event ABC televised last fall. "Get that caddy off
the green," Howard exclaimed, not realizing that
the alleged caddy happened to be the nation's best
amateur golfer.
Others have placed foot similarly in mouth, but
Stadler doesn't seem to mind. He just keeps belting
280-yard tee shots and putting with a soft touch
that belies his 5-11, 220-pound frame. He's even a
nice guy, if you can excuse his tendency to send an
occasional golf club skyrocketing down the
fairway.
While Stadler flails wildly at each shot in search
of maximum distance, his USC teammate Mark
Pfeil (the defending Pac-8 champion) prefers the
same smooth, consistent method favored by
Stanford's U.S. Collegiate Invitational champion
Dave Baskins and Western Intercollegiate winner
Peter Jacobsen of Oregon.
Concentration
All three rarely leave the center of the fairway,
although Jacobsen is likely to be loose and smiling
while Baskins and Pfeil concentrate almost
exclusively on the golfing business at hand.
Still, the battle between those four golfers
figures to be a mere sideshow in this weekend's
tournament. The major question, says USC coach
Stan Wood and Stanford mentor Bud Finger, is
who is best between the Cardinals and the Trojans.
USC, currently ranked third nationally in Golf
World's coaches' poll, would seem to be favored
over Stanford, a team listed in the "receiving votes"
category. In head-to-head competition, however,
the two teams are dead even. Stanford triumphed
at its own U.S. Collegiate Invitational and finished
ahead of USC at the Fresno Classic; the Trojans
captured the Pacific Coast Invitational and last
week's Pac-8 Southern Division tournament.
"We're * co-favorites," says Wood, who
nevertheless maintains that his Trojans are still the
best team in the nation (Florida is currently tops,
with Wake Forest second). "I voted for us number

one, and I voted for Stanford in the top 10. But I
don't think we can be the clear-cut favorite because
of the home course advantage."
16-Shot Edge
' Wood estimates that Stanford's familiarity with
the course is worth one shot per man per round, or
16 shots for the 72-hole distance. He also figures
that USC's traditional Pac-8 dominance (three
straight titles, nine of the last 12) should work to
the Trojans' advantage.
Finger, meanwhile, is less scientific. "It will
probably come down to a psychological break
somewhere along the line," he said.
"Competitive sports travel in a strange fashion,"
Finger explained. "Having defeated SC up here and
been defeated down there, you might think we're
ready to win again. However the mere fact that we
beat them up here may give them a psychological
advantage because of the revenge factor. But then
again I think we have the confidence to challenge
USC at their best."
Up In The Air
Translation: it's up in the air. Anything can
happen, especially because of the grueling
tournament format.
Today, all 48 entrants (six from each Pac-8
school) will play 36 holes, with another double
round scheduled for tomorrow. Golfers will be
required to carry their own bags throughout the
72-hole ordeal.
Stanford's entrants (with competitive averages in
parentheses) are: Baskins (74.11), Aly Trompas
(75.00), George Pettinger (75.20), Brent Murray
(75.75), Conrad Nilmeier (76.07) and Glenn
Goethels (76.91).
Murray and Goethels, both freshmen, earned
their spots in the lineup by surviving a 72-hole
playoff the past week. Senior Bob Harrington was
also shooting for a Pac-8 berth, but finished third in
the closely contested challenge on rounds of
76-72-73-75-296. Murray shot 70-74-77-72-293,
while Goethels fired rounds of 71-72-78-74 for a
295 total.

Chip Shots: Most prominent among the
Northern challengers is Washington. The Huskies
edged Oregon last week in the Pac-8 Northern
Division tourney.
Other individual contenders include Cal's Don
Compton, UCLA's Jim Porter, Oregon State's Dave
Molitor, Washington's Gary Sater and every entrant
wearing a shirt labeled Stanford or USC.
Morning tee-off times range from 8 to 9:56 each
day, with the contestants trudging back to the first
tee from 1:15 to 3:15 in the afternoons.

While Stadler flails wildly at each shot in search
of maximum distance, his USC teammate Mark
Pfeil (the defending Pac-8 champion) prefers the
same smooth, consistent method favored by
Stanford's U.S. Collegiate Invitational champion
Dave Baskins and Western Intercollegiate winner
Peter Jacobsen of Oregon.
Concentration
All three rarely leave the center of the fairway,
although Jacobsen is likely to be loose and smiling
while Baskins and Pfeil concentrate almost
exclusively on the golfing business at hand.
Still, the battle between those four golfers
figures to be a mere sideshow in this weekend's
tournament. The major question, says USC coach
Stan Wood and Stanford mentor Bud Finger, is
who is best between the Cardinals and the Trojans.
USC, currently ranked third nationally in Golf
World's coaches' poll, would seem to be favored
over Stanford, a team listed in the "receiving votes"
category. In head-to-head competition, however,
the two teams are dead even. Stanford triumphed
at its own U.S. Collegiate Invitational and finished
ahead of USC at the Fresno Classic; the Trojans
captured the Pacific Coast Invitational and last
week's Pac-8 Southern Division tournament.
"We're * co-favorites," says Wood, who
nevertheless maintains that his Trojans are still the
best team in the nation (Florida is currently tops,
with Wake Forest second). "I voted for us number

one, and I voted for Stanford in the top 10. But I
don't think we can be the clear-cut favorite because
of the home course advantage."
16-Shot Edge
' Wood estimates that Stanford's familiarity with
the course is worth one shot per man per round, or
16 shots for the 72-hole distance. He also figures
that USC's traditional Pac-8 dominance (three
straight titles, nine of the last 12) should work to
the Trojans' advantage.
Finger, meanwhile, is less scientific. "It will
probably come down to a psychological break
somewhere along the line," he said.
"Competitive sports travel in a strange fashion,"
Finger explained. "Having defeated SC up here and
been defeated down there, you might think we're
ready to win again. However the mere fact that we
beat them up here may give them a psychological
advantage because of the revenge factor. But then
again I think we have the confidence to challenge
USC at their best."
Up In The Air
Translation: it's up in the air. Anything can
happen, especially because of the grueling
tournament format.
Today, all 48 entrants (six from each Pac-8
school) will play 36 holes, with another double
round scheduled for tomorrow. Golfers will be
required to carry their own bags throughout the
72-hole ordeal.
Stanford's entrants (with competitive averages in
parentheses) are: Baskins (74.11), Aly Trompas
(75.00), George Pettinger (75.20), Brent Murray
(75.75), Conrad Nilmeier (76.07) and Glenn
Goethels (76.91).
Murray and Goethels, both freshmen, earned
their spots in the lineup by surviving a 72-hole
playoff the past week. Senior Bob Harrington was
also shooting for a Pac-8 berth, but finished third in
the closely contested challenge on rounds of
76-72-73-75-296. Murray shot 70-74-77-72-293,
while Goethels fired rounds of 71-72-78-74 for a
295 total.

Chip Shots: Most prominent among the
Northern challengers is Washington. The Huskies
edged Oregon last week in the Pac-8 Northern
Division tourney.
Other individual contenders include Cal's Don
Compton, UCLA's Jim Porter, Oregon State's Dave
Molitor, Washington's Gary Sater and every entrant
wearing a shirt labeled Stanford or USC.
Morning tee-off times range from 8 to 9:56 each
day, with the contestants trudging back to the first
tee from 1:15 to 3:15 in the afternoons.
Slovenly Craig Stadler, smooth Peter Jacobsen,
',eady Dave Baskins and stoic Mark Pfeil are
expected to battle for the individual title, but USC
and Stanford are emphasizing the team competition
this weekend as the Cards host the 15th annual
Pacific Eight golf championships on the Stanford
course.
Stadler, the reigning U.S. Amateur champion, is
the antithesis of those well-groomed country club
6 olfers you see in Sears Men Store ads. In fact
ABC-TV producer Chuck Howard screamed in
disgust as Stadler waited to putt during a pro tour
event ABC televised last fall. "Get that caddy off
the green," Howard exclaimed, not realizing that
the alleged caddy happened to be the nation's best
amateur golfer.
Others have placed foot similarly in mouth, but
Stadler doesn't seem to mind. He just keeps belting
280-yard tee shots and putting with a soft touch
that belies his 5-11, 220-pound frame. He's even a
nice guy, if you can excuse his tendency to send an
occasional golf club skyrocketing down the
fairway.

"We're * co-favorites," says Wood, who
nevertheless maintains that his Trojans are still the
best team in the nation (Florida is currently tops,
with Wake Forest second). "I voted for us number

one, and I voted for Stanford in the top 10. But I
don't think we can be the clear-cut favorite because
of the home course advantage."
16-Shot Edge
' Wood estimates that Stanford's familiarity with
the course is worth one shot per man per round, or
16 shots for the 72-hole distance. He also figures
that USC's traditional Pac-8 dominance (three
straight titles, nine of the last 12) should work to
the Trojans' advantage.
Finger, meanwhile, is less scientific. "It will
probably come down to a psychological break
somewhere along the line," he said.
"Competitive sports travel in a strange fashion,"
Finger explained. "Having defeated SC up here and
been defeated down there, you might think we're
ready to win again. However the mere fact that we
beat them up here may give them a psychological
advantage because of the revenge factor. But then
again I think we have the confidence to challenge
USC at their best."
Up In The Air
Translation: it's up in the air. Anything can
happen, especially because of the grueling
tournament format.
Today, all 48 entrants (six from each Pac-8
school) will play 36 holes, with another double
round scheduled for tomorrow. Golfers will be
required to carry their own bags throughout the
72-hole ordeal.
Stanford's entrants (with competitive averages in
parentheses) are: Baskins (74.11), Aly Trompas
(75.00), George Pettinger (75.20), Brent Murray
(75.75), Conrad Nilmeier (76.07) and Glenn
Goethels (76.91).
Murray and Goethels, both freshmen, earned
their spots in the lineup by surviving a 72-hole
playoff the past week. Senior Bob Harrington was
also shooting for a Pac-8 berth, but finished third in
the closely contested challenge on rounds of
76-72-73-75-296. Murray shot 70-74-77-72-293,
while Goethels fired rounds of 71-72-78-74 for a
295 total.

Chip Shots: Most prominent among the
Northern challengers is Washington. The Huskies
edged Oregon last week in the Pac-8 Northern
Division tourney.
Other individual contenders include Cal's Don
Compton, UCLA's Jim Porter, Oregon State's Dave
Molitor, Washington's Gary Sater and every entrant
wearing a shirt labeled Stanford or USC.
Morning tee-off times range from 8 to 9:56 each
day, with the contestants trudging back to the first
tee from 1:15 to 3:15 in the afternoons.
Slovenly Craig Stadler, smooth Peter Jacobsen,
',eady Dave Baskins and stoic Mark Pfeil are
expected to battle for the individual title, but USC
and Stanford are emphasizing the team competition
this weekend as the Cards host the 15th annual
Pacific Eight golf championships on the Stanford
course.
Stadler, the reigning U.S. Amateur champion, is
the antithesis of those well-groomed country club
6 olfers you see in Sears Men Store ads. In fact
ABC-TV producer Chuck Howard screamed in
disgust as Stadler waited to putt during a pro tour
event ABC televised last fall. "Get that caddy off
the green," Howard exclaimed, not realizing that
the alleged caddy happened to be the nation's best
amateur golfer.
Others have placed foot similarly in mouth, but
Stadler doesn't seem to mind. He just keeps belting
280-yard tee shots and putting with a soft touch
that belies his 5-11, 220-pound frame. He's even a
nice guy, if you can excuse his tendency to send an
occasional golf club skyrocketing down the
fairway.
While Stadler flails wildly at each shot in search
of maximum distance, his USC teammate Mark
Pfeil (the defending Pac-8 champion) prefers the
same smooth, consistent method favored by
Stanford's U.S. Collegiate Invitational champion
Dave Baskins and Western Intercollegiate winner
Peter Jacobsen of Oregon.
Concentration
All three rarely leave the center of the fairway,
although Jacobsen is likely to be loose and smiling
while Baskins and Pfeil concentrate almost
exclusively on the golfing business at hand.
Still, the battle between those four golfers
figures to be a mere sideshow in this weekend's
tournament. The major question, says USC coach
Stan Wood and Stanford mentor Bud Finger, is
who is best between the Cardinals and the Trojans.
USC, currently ranked third nationally in Golf
World's coaches' poll, would seem to be favored
over Stanford, a team listed in the "receiving votes"
category. In head-to-head competition, however,
the two teams are dead even. Stanford triumphed
at its own U.S. Collegiate Invitational and finished
ahead of USC at the Fresno Classic; the Trojans
captured the Pacific Coast Invitational and last
week's Pac-8 Southern Division tournament.
"We're * co-favorites," says Wood, who
nevertheless maintains that his Trojans are still the
best team in the nation (Florida is currently tops,
with Wake Forest second). "I voted for us number

one, and I voted for Stanford in the top 10. But I
