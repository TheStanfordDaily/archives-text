# New Baseball League For Stanford?
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
The Pacific Eight Southern
Division baseball championship,
which Stanford narrowly missed
winning last week, may not even
exist next year if a proposal by
Cardinal head coach Ray Young is
accepted by Pac-8 athletic
directors today.
Young and Stanford athletic
director Joe Ruetz have been
attending conference meetings in
Los Angeles all week long. Young
has been pushing a plan to
organize a Northern California
conference and a Southern
California conference.
In other developments at Los
Angeles, four Cards were named
to the Pac-8 southern division
team which was announced
yesterday. They were sophomore
outfielder Bruce Robinson,
sophomore pitcher Mike
Williamson, sophomore shortstop
Steve Davis at utility and senior
first baseman Mark Lucich.
University of Southern
California, which won the divsion
with an 11-7 record compared to
Stanford's 10-8 mark, had three
players selected — third baseman
Rich Dauer, outfielder Creighton
Tevlin and pitcher Russ McQueen.
California also landed three
players on the squad.
USC plays host to the Northern
Division champion Oregon today
in the first game of a best-of-three
series to determine the conference
representative to the District
Eight playoffs beginning next
weekend.
New League
Young's proposal for a new
league would be to dissolve the
Pac-8 Southern Division and
organize an eight or nine team
conference composed of Northern
California schools.
Tentative members are San Jose
State and Fresno State from the
Pacific Coast Athletic Association;
University of Pacific, University
of San Francisco, Santa Clara and
St. Mary's from the West Coast
Athletic Conference and the two
Pac-8 schools, Stanford and
California.
Another WCAC school,
University of Nevada at Reno, is a
possible entrant.
USC and UCLA, presently
members of the Pac-8, would
probably form a similar league in
Southern California.
The strongest argument Young
has going for the new idea is
economy. Many of the Pac-8
schools are feeling the crunch of

rising costs and little revenue to
meet them — especially in
baseball.
Many of the Pac-8 coaches
want to go back to the
interdivisional schedule that would
mean 26 conference games — six
games between each southern
division school and two games
with each northern division

school. However, one drawback is
the expensiveness of travel.
"The athletic directors will hear
the proposal Friday morning,"
said Stanford assistant coach Mark
Marquess, who indicated that the
northern California schools were
in favor of the new league idea.
The Riverside Tournament
certainly was the turning point for

Robinson, who had been hitting
only .143 until that point. He
played well in the tourney and
went on to hit .367 in the Pac-8.
Williamson was very effective in
the late season as he compiled a
4-1 record with a 1.98 earned run
average in the conference. He
pitched back-to-back shutouts
against UCLA and USC. His only
loss was a 7-5 decision to USC.
His overall record was 6-3.
Davis and Lucich were two of
the more consistent Cardinal
hitters all year long.
An indication of Davis'
consistency is the fact that he
batted exactly the same average
he had last year. Davis got up 165
times and collected 51 hits for a
.309 average — the same both
years.
This year for Lucich has been a
tremendous change from a dismal
performance a year ago. He
slugged 11 home runs to tie the
existing Stanford single season
record held by Jim Hibbs (1966)
and Rod Boone (1971). He hit
.335 overall and was second only
to Venoy Garrison, the
all-conference catcher from

UCLA, in conference hitting at
393
'High In Draft'
"I'd be surprised if Lucich isn't
picked high in the professional
draft," said Marquess. "He's got
power, plays good defense and has
good speed. He showed a lot of
power this year, which is what the
pro scouts are looking for."
Two Cards who were
all-conference selections last year
were not selected for this year's
12-man squad, voted by the
coaches. They were sophomore
catcher Dave Baker, who slumped
to .242 in conference play, and
junior outfielder Bob Hampton,
who hit .250 in conference.

power, plays good defense and has
good speed. He showed a lot of
power this year, which is what the
pro scouts are looking for."
Two Cards who were

were not selected for this year's

LUCKY 13 — Sophomore shortstop Steve Davis was named utility
man on the 1974 Pac-8 Southern Division all-star baseball team.
The Pacific Eight Southern
Division baseball championship,
which Stanford narrowly missed
winning last week, may not even
exist next year if a proposal by
Cardinal head coach Ray Young is
accepted by Pac-8 athletic
directors today.
Young and Stanford athletic
director Joe Ruetz have been
attending conference meetings in
Los Angeles all week long. Young
has been pushing a plan to
organize a Northern California
conference and a Southern
California conference.
In other developments at Los
Angeles, four Cards were named
to the Pac-8 southern division
team which was announced
yesterday. They were sophomore
outfielder Bruce Robinson,
sophomore pitcher Mike
Williamson, sophomore shortstop
Steve Davis at utility and senior
first baseman Mark Lucich.
University of Southern
California, which won the divsion
with an 11-7 record compared to
Stanford's 10-8 mark, had three
players selected — third baseman
Rich Dauer, outfielder Creighton
Tevlin and pitcher Russ McQueen.
California also landed three
players on the squad.
USC plays host to the Northern
Division champion Oregon today
in the first game of a best-of-three
series to determine the conference
representative to the District
Eight playoffs beginning next
weekend.
New League
Young's proposal for a new
league would be to dissolve the
Pac-8 Southern Division and
organize an eight or nine team
conference composed of Northern
California schools.
Tentative members are San Jose
State and Fresno State from the
Pacific Coast Athletic Association;
University of Pacific, University
of San Francisco, Santa Clara and
St. Mary's from the West Coast
Athletic Conference and the two
Pac-8 schools, Stanford and
California.
Another WCAC school,
University of Nevada at Reno, is a
possible entrant.
USC and UCLA, presently
members of the Pac-8, would
probably form a similar league in
Southern California.
The strongest argument Young
has going for the new idea is
economy. Many of the Pac-8
schools are feeling the crunch of

rising costs and little revenue to
meet them — especially in
baseball.
Many of the Pac-8 coaches
want to go back to the
interdivisional schedule that would
mean 26 conference games — six
games between each southern
division school and two games
with each northern division

school. However, one drawback is
the expensiveness of travel.
"The athletic directors will hear
the proposal Friday morning,"
said Stanford assistant coach Mark
Marquess, who indicated that the
northern California schools were
in favor of the new league idea.
The Riverside Tournament
certainly was the turning point for

Robinson, who had been hitting
only .143 until that point. He
played well in the tourney and
went on to hit .367 in the Pac-8.
Williamson was very effective in
the late season as he compiled a
4-1 record with a 1.98 earned run
average in the conference. He
pitched back-to-back shutouts
against UCLA and USC. His only
loss was a 7-5 decision to USC.
His overall record was 6-3.
Davis and Lucich were two of
the more consistent Cardinal
hitters all year long.
An indication of Davis'
consistency is the fact that he
batted exactly the same average
he had last year. Davis got up 165
times and collected 51 hits for a
.309 average — the same both
years.
This year for Lucich has been a
tremendous change from a dismal
performance a year ago. He
slugged 11 home runs to tie the
existing Stanford single season
record held by Jim Hibbs (1966)
and Rod Boone (1971). He hit
.335 overall and was second only
to Venoy Garrison, the
all-conference catcher from

UCLA, in conference hitting at
393
'High In Draft'
"I'd be surprised if Lucich isn't
picked high in the professional
draft," said Marquess. "He's got
power, plays good defense and has
good speed. He showed a lot of
power this year, which is what the
pro scouts are looking for."

.309 average — the same both
years.
This year for Lucich has been a
tremendous change from a dismal
performance a year ago. He
slugged 11 home runs to tie the
existing Stanford single season
record held by Jim Hibbs (1966)
and Rod Boone (1971). He hit
.335 overall and was second only
to Venoy Garrison, the
all-conference catcher from

UCLA, in conference hitting at
393
'High In Draft'
"I'd be surprised if Lucich isn't
picked high in the professional
draft," said Marquess. "He's got
power, plays good defense and has
good speed. He showed a lot of
power this year, which is what the
pro scouts are looking for."
Two Cards who were
all-conference selections last year
were not selected for this year's
12-man squad, voted by the
coaches. They were sophomore
catcher Dave Baker, who slumped
to .242 in conference play, and
junior outfielder Bob Hampton,
who hit .250 in conference.
