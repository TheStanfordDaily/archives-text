# University Seeks Order To Restrict Disruptions
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
University attorneys will seek a
temporary restraining order from
Santa Clara County Superior Court
this morning in an attempt to "stop
certain kinds of conduct that have
been disruptive or interfering with the
operation of the vital functions" of
the University, according to University
Legal Counsel James Siena.
Siena declined to specify the scope
of the order, but he affirmed for the
Daily a statement that the University
will attempt to prohibit interference
with campus construction, notably at
the medical center.
The med center construction area
has been the site of several
confrontations between United
Stanford Employees (USE) unicta
pickets and construction workers and
drivers attempting to enter the area.
USE President Jim Berk was
arrested Wednesday after he blocked
the entrance of two cranes into the
area and refused to move.
'Legal Action'
"We are hoping USE will agree to
let the construction go on," Siena told
the Daily earlier this week. "Only
should that break down would we
consider that kind of legal action
[restraining order]."
Siena said last night that the
restraining order would not be limited
solely to campus construction
disruptions, but said he could not
elaborate because "our lawyers are still
working up the papers."
He added that the University has
"no intention of prohibiting peaceful,
lawful, conventional picketing
anywhere on campus."
USE attorney James Wolpman said
the proposed restraining order "tells
people not to do what they're not
supposed to do. It's very broad.
There's not much of a guideline as to
het you're supposed to do."
Wolpman said he gave the
University's working papers a "cursory
reading" and added, "It's perfectly
possible that it isn't worth too much
because it's too broad."
Private Order
He commented that he would
"vehemently contest it when it comes
up for an open hearing, but would
probably not contest the University's
court motions this morning. The
hearing on a temporiiry restraining
order is private, in the judge's
chambers, while the hearing for an
injunction is open," he explained.
President Richard Lyman told the
Faculty Senate yesterday the
University is also considering seeking
relief through the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) to prevent
secondary boycotts of privately
contracted campus construction
workers.
Minor incidents between pickets
and truck drivers attempting to make
deliveries across picket lines yesterday
marked the fourth day of the USE
walkout.
Student Injured
Ralph Robles, a student picketing
at the Stanford Hospital, was struck
by a truck delivering linen yesterday
morning. He was treated at Cowell
Student Health Center for a bruised
elbow and released.
A Daily reporter on the scene said
as the truck approaiched the medical

center delivery entrance, a few pickets,
including Robles, stepped in the
truck's path. The truck slowed, but
continued on and struck Robles, he
said.
In a separate incident at Wilbur
Hall, student picket Manuel Hernandez
was reported hit by an automobile
driven by Asst. Housing Manager
Frank Gallagher. Hernandez was
examined at Cowell and released.
Gallagher vehemently denied that
his car struck any pickets. He said he
was driving some food service workers
across picket lines to their jobs and
was blocked by pickets. He said he
stopped the car and radioed for police
assistance.
'Struck By Nobody'
After two Santa Clara County
deputy sheriffs arrived and informed
the pickets they had to allow
Gallagher access to Wilbur, one of the
pickets lay down in front of the car
"at least six feet in front of me,"
Gallagher said. He added that the
deputies carried the picket to the side
of the road and cleared others away so
he could drive in.
"He was struck by nobody,"
Gallagher said of Hernandez. Both
Hernandez and the police officers
present were unavailable for comment.
Pickets at the med center blocked
deliveries from trucks throughout the
day. Some drivers edged their way
through the picket lines, while others
simply decided to turn around without
making their delivery.
Early yesterday afternoon about 40
USE pickets blocked the loading dock
entrance and delayed for more than an
hour a truck delivering food to
patients at nearby Hoover Pavilion.
Speed Limit
The pickets refused to let the truck
pass until Med Center administrators
agreed to set a speed limit of 10 miles
per hour in the loading area and
instruct drivers not to strike pickets
with their vehicles when crossing
picket lines.
Later in the afternoon, Bob
Anderson, a Service Employees
Internationa] Union (SEIU) official,
read a statement from Medical School
Dean Clayton Rich establishing the 10
mile per hour limit and instructing
drivers to "drive with care and at no
more than a reasonable, prudent and
safe speed."
University Plant Services personnel
spent a good part of the day reopening
several valves on campus steam lines
and repairing two broken water mains.
The valve closings shut off heat to
many parts of the University including
Wilbur Hall for most of the morning.
A large crystal being "grown" for
laser research was damaged and
possibly ruined by the heat shut off,
according to Troy Barbee Jr.,
laboratory director at the Center for
Materials Research. Barbee estimated
the crystal's worth at from $3,000 to
$10,000 and said it was sensitive to
temperature changes of as little as
one-half a degree fahrenheit.
Food Services
The food service operated smoothly
yesterday and University Housing
Director Ed Scoles reported that half
of the food service employees have
returned to work. Only 30 percent
showed up Monday.
With these additional personnel, the

food service will open a consolidated'
dining hall on the west side of campus
early next week, probably Tuesday.
The kitchen will serve Florence Moore,
Lagunita and Roble residents who
must now walk across campus to eat
University food. Food service officials
have not decided which dining hall wil.
be opened, Scoles said.
University Food Service Manager
Maxine Anderson said rebates would
continue next week from Tues., May
21 to Tues., May 28. Scoles said the
rebate eases the load on the food
service since they can buy fewer
perishables and canned goods for the
lighter volume of students.
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(S LAC) operations continued
"smoothly" yesterday even though 79
percent of its employees are out on
strike. Two of SLAC's six scheduled
experiments for the week were
postponed earlier this week.

Director Ed Scoles reported that half
of the food service employees have
returned to work. Only 30 percent

With these additional personnel, the

food service will open a consolidated'

Maxine Anderson said rebates would

rebate eases the load on the food

perishables and canned goods for the
lighter volume of students.
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(S LAC) operations continued
"smoothly" yesterday even though 79
percent of its employees are out on
strike. Two of SLAC's six scheduled

University attorneys will seek a
temporary restraining order from
Santa Clara County Superior Court
this morning in an attempt to "stop
certain kinds of conduct that have
been disruptive or interfering with the
operation of the vital functions" of
the University, according to University
Legal Counsel James Siena.
Siena declined to specify the scope
of the order, but he affirmed for the
Daily a statement that the University
will attempt to prohibit interference
with campus construction, notably at
the medical center.
The med center construction area
has been the site of several
confrontations between United
Stanford Employees (USE) unicta
pickets and construction workers and
drivers attempting to enter the area.
USE President Jim Berk was
arrested Wednesday after he blocked
the entrance of two cranes into the
area and refused to move.
'Legal Action'
"We are hoping USE will agree to
let the construction go on," Siena told
the Daily earlier this week. "Only
should that break down would we
consider that kind of legal action
[restraining order]."
Siena said last night that the
restraining order would not be limited
solely to campus construction
disruptions, but said he could not
elaborate because "our lawyers are still
working up the papers."
He added that the University has
"no intention of prohibiting peaceful,
lawful, conventional picketing
anywhere on campus."
USE attorney James Wolpman said
the proposed restraining order "tells
people not to do what they're not
supposed to do. It's very broad.
There's not much of a guideline as to
het you're supposed to do."
Wolpman said he gave the
University's working papers a "cursory
reading" and added, "It's perfectly
possible that it isn't worth too much
because it's too broad."
Private Order
He commented that he would
"vehemently contest it when it comes
up for an open hearing, but would
probably not contest the University's
court motions this morning. The
hearing on a temporiiry restraining
order is private, in the judge's
chambers, while the hearing for an
injunction is open," he explained.
President Richard Lyman told the
Faculty Senate yesterday the
University is also considering seeking
relief through the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) to prevent
secondary boycotts of privately
contracted campus construction
workers.
Minor incidents between pickets
and truck drivers attempting to make
deliveries across picket lines yesterday
marked the fourth day of the USE
walkout.
Student Injured
Ralph Robles, a student picketing
at the Stanford Hospital, was struck
by a truck delivering linen yesterday
morning. He was treated at Cowell
Student Health Center for a bruised
elbow and released.
A Daily reporter on the scene said
as the truck approaiched the medical

center delivery entrance, a few pickets,
including Robles, stepped in the
truck's path. The truck slowed, but
continued on and struck Robles, he
said.
In a separate incident at Wilbur
Hall, student picket Manuel Hernandez
was reported hit by an automobile
driven by Asst. Housing Manager
Frank Gallagher. Hernandez was
examined at Cowell and released.
Gallagher vehemently denied that
his car struck any pickets. He said he
was driving some food service workers
across picket lines to their jobs and
was blocked by pickets. He said he
stopped the car and radioed for police
assistance.
'Struck By Nobody'
After two Santa Clara County
deputy sheriffs arrived and informed
the pickets they had to allow
Gallagher access to Wilbur, one of the
pickets lay down in front of the car
"at least six feet in front of me,"
Gallagher said. He added that the
deputies carried the picket to the side
of the road and cleared others away so
he could drive in.
"He was struck by nobody,"
Gallagher said of Hernandez. Both
Hernandez and the police officers
present were unavailable for comment.
Pickets at the med center blocked
deliveries from trucks throughout the
day. Some drivers edged their way
through the picket lines, while others
simply decided to turn around without
making their delivery.
Early yesterday afternoon about 40
USE pickets blocked the loading dock
entrance and delayed for more than an
hour a truck delivering food to
patients at nearby Hoover Pavilion.
Speed Limit
The pickets refused to let the truck
pass until Med Center administrators
agreed to set a speed limit of 10 miles
per hour in the loading area and
instruct drivers not to strike pickets
with their vehicles when crossing
picket lines.
Later in the afternoon, Bob
Anderson, a Service Employees
Internationa] Union (SEIU) official,
read a statement from Medical School
Dean Clayton Rich establishing the 10
mile per hour limit and instructing
drivers to "drive with care and at no
more than a reasonable, prudent and
safe speed."
University Plant Services personnel
spent a good part of the day reopening
several valves on campus steam lines
and repairing two broken water mains.
The valve closings shut off heat to
many parts of the University including
Wilbur Hall for most of the morning.
A large crystal being "grown" for
laser research was damaged and
possibly ruined by the heat shut off,
according to Troy Barbee Jr.,
laboratory director at the Center for
Materials Research. Barbee estimated
the crystal's worth at from $3,000 to
$10,000 and said it was sensitive to

Pickets at the med center blocked
deliveries from trucks throughout the
day. Some drivers edged their way
through the picket lines, while others
simply decided to turn around without
making their delivery.
Early yesterday afternoon about 40
USE pickets blocked the loading dock
entrance and delayed for more than an
hour a truck delivering food to
patients at nearby Hoover Pavilion.
Speed Limit
The pickets refused to let the truck
pass until Med Center administrators
agreed to set a speed limit of 10 miles
per hour in the loading area and
instruct drivers not to strike pickets
with their vehicles when crossing
picket lines.
Later in the afternoon, Bob
Anderson, a Service Employees
Internationa] Union (SEIU) official,
read a statement from Medical School
Dean Clayton Rich establishing the 10
mile per hour limit and instructing
drivers to "drive with care and at no
more than a reasonable, prudent and
safe speed."
University Plant Services personnel
spent a good part of the day reopening
several valves on campus steam lines
and repairing two broken water mains.
The valve closings shut off heat to
many parts of the University including
Wilbur Hall for most of the morning.
A large crystal being "grown" for
laser research was damaged and
possibly ruined by the heat shut off,
according to Troy Barbee Jr.,
laboratory director at the Center for
Materials Research. Barbee estimated
the crystal's worth at from $3,000 to
$10,000 and said it was sensitive to
temperature changes of as little as
one-half a degree fahrenheit.
Food Services
The food service operated smoothly
yesterday and University Housing
Director Ed Scoles reported that half
of the food service employees have
returned to work. Only 30 percent
showed up Monday.
With these additional personnel, the

food service will open a consolidated'
dining hall on the west side of campus
early next week, probably Tuesday.
The kitchen will serve Florence Moore,
Lagunita and Roble residents who
must now walk across campus to eat
University food. Food service officials
have not decided which dining hall wil.
be opened, Scoles said.
University Food Service Manager
Maxine Anderson said rebates would
continue next week from Tues., May
21 to Tues., May 28. Scoles said the
rebate eases the load on the food
service since they can buy fewer
perishables and canned goods for the
lighter volume of students.
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(S LAC) operations continued
"smoothly" yesterday even though 79
percent of its employees are out on
strike. Two of SLAC's six scheduled
experiments for the week were
postponed earlier this week.

University attorneys will seek a
temporary restraining order from
Santa Clara County Superior Court
this morning in an attempt to "stop
certain kinds of conduct that have
been disruptive or interfering with the
operation of the vital functions" of
the University, according to University
Legal Counsel James Siena.
Siena declined to specify the scope
of the order, but he affirmed for the
Daily a statement that the University
will attempt to prohibit interference
with campus construction, notably at
the medical center.
The med center construction area
has been the site of several
confrontations between United
Stanford Employees (USE) unicta
pickets and construction workers and
drivers attempting to enter the area.
USE President Jim Berk was
arrested Wednesday after he blocked
the entrance of two cranes into the
area and refused to move.
'Legal Action'
"We are hoping USE will agree to
let the construction go on," Siena told
the Daily earlier this week. "Only
should that break down would we
consider that kind of legal action
[restraining order]."
Siena said last night that the
restraining order would not be limited
solely to campus construction
disruptions, but said he could not
elaborate because "our lawyers are still
working up the papers."
He added that the University has
"no intention of prohibiting peaceful,
lawful, conventional picketing
anywhere on campus."
USE attorney James Wolpman said
the proposed restraining order "tells
people not to do what they're not
supposed to do. It's very broad.
There's not much of a guideline as to
het you're supposed to do."
Wolpman said he gave the
University's working papers a "cursory
reading" and added, "It's perfectly
possible that it isn't worth too much
because it's too broad."
Private Order
He commented that he would
"vehemently contest it when it comes
up for an open hearing, but would
probably not contest the University's
court motions this morning. The
hearing on a temporiiry restraining
order is private, in the judge's
chambers, while the hearing for an
injunction is open," he explained.
President Richard Lyman told the
Faculty Senate yesterday the
University is also considering seeking
relief through the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) to prevent
secondary boycotts of privately
contracted campus construction
workers.
Minor incidents between pickets
and truck drivers attempting to make
deliveries across picket lines yesterday
marked the fourth day of the USE
walkout.
Student Injured
Ralph Robles, a student picketing
at the Stanford Hospital, was struck
by a truck delivering linen yesterday
morning. He was treated at Cowell
Student Health Center for a bruised
elbow and released.
A Daily reporter on the scene said
as the truck approaiched the medical

center delivery entrance, a few pickets,
including Robles, stepped in the
truck's path. The truck slowed, but
continued on and struck Robles, he
said.
In a separate incident at Wilbur
Hall, student picket Manuel Hernandez
was reported hit by an automobile
driven by Asst. Housing Manager
Frank Gallagher. Hernandez was
examined at Cowell and released.
Gallagher vehemently denied that
his car struck any pickets. He said he
was driving some food service workers
across picket lines to their jobs and
was blocked by pickets. He said he
stopped the car and radioed for police
assistance.
'Struck By Nobody'
After two Santa Clara County
deputy sheriffs arrived and informed
the pickets they had to allow
Gallagher access to Wilbur, one of the
pickets lay down in front of the car
"at least six feet in front of me,"
Gallagher said. He added that the
deputies carried the picket to the side
of the road and cleared others away so
he could drive in.
"He was struck by nobody,"
Gallagher said of Hernandez. Both
Hernandez and the police officers
