# Spikers Destined For Pac-8 Cellar
## 
### MARK WHITE 
To be quite frank about it,
Stanford's role in the Pac-8 track
Championships in Los Angeles
this weekend merely involves an
attempt to escape the cellar
position in the final point
standings.
Last year the Cards finished
eighth in the Pac-8 with 25 points,
one behind Cal, but as the Bears
are stronger in 1974 and the Cards
weaker, it appears only
Washington will rival Stanford for
the bottom notch.
All throught the 1974 season,
coach Payton Jordan has praised
the efforts of his men, who were
favored in only two of their six
dual meets.
"Other teams may have more
talent than us, but nobody is
more competitive than we are. ...
We know we don't have the talent
of the other Pac-8 schools, but we
work harder than anyone else. ...
I've never been prouder of a
team," said Jordan.
Although Jordan will not use it
as a crutch, it is obvious that
Stanford's track program receives
far less scholarship support than
the other "major" sports. At the
current level of Pac-8 track
quality, there is no way Stanford
can be a legitimiate contender
given present funding.
As for the Pac-8 meet itself,
UCLA should be favored to win
its fifth title in six years.
Although the Bruins are not as
deep as they have been, they are
strong across the board (except in
the hurdles), and only USC and
Oregon State should threaten the
NCAA champs.
Sprints
USC has the two leading 100
men in Guy Abrahams and Mike
Shavers at 9.5, but there is no
standout sprinter who should be
favored "The sprints are more
open than they've been in years,"
said Jordan. Both Gordon Peppars
of UCLA and Yaw Atuahene of
OSU should place in both short
sprints.
Ken Curl placed fourth in 9.6
last year, and the Card senior may
surprise in the 100. Freshman
Marvin Holmes will be entered in
the 220.
UCLA should go 1-2 in the
440, with either Maxie Parks or
Benny Brown taking the victory.
Atuahene has run under 48.0
three times this season and should
place, along with Trojan Ken
Randle who placed second last
year in 46.6. Either Bruce Henry
or Scott Wingo will represent the
Cards.
Distance Races
Cal's Rick Brown is favored to
become only the second man in
Pac-8 history to win his event (the
880) four years in a row. OSU's
Hailu Ebba is the only person
capable of upsetting Brown, and
he will be running (and probably
winning) the mile. With five of the
nation's top ten 880 men in this
race, it should be one of the best
ever.
In the mile, Stanford freshman
Steve Crowley will maximize his
chances for a place if the pace is
slow. Oregon, led by Ebba, has six
men in the top eight, and
conceivably could sweep.
Paul Geis of Oregon should be
favored to win the three-mile
since his sharpest opponent, John

Ngeno of WSU, will probably run
and win the six-mile. Cards Tony
Sandoval and Mark McConnell
both have a chance to score in the
top six, especially Sandoval, if it is
hot in Los Angeles.
Jack Bellah of Stanford will be
entered in the six-mile, but Ngeno
has more than a 40 second edge
on most of the Pac-8 competition.
Hurdles
Stanford's best hopes for points
come in the intermediate hurdles.
Matt Hogsett ran an early 51.7 this
year and his 47.5 mile relay leg
last Saturday means he is ready to
peak. Dave Bagshaw, recently
injured in a frat-house melee, will
concentrate on the intermediates
also. "I think UCLA's Lynnsey
Guerrero should be favored," said
Jordan.
WSU's Kip Ngeno (13.7) leads
the field in the high hurdles, but
Cal's McKinely Mosley or any one
of three Trojan hurdlers could
surprise.
Relays
UCLA's string of six straight
mile-relay victories will be
threatened if 440 ace Parks is still
slowed by a recent injury. "USC
will really push them, don't be
surprised if they beat UCLA in the
mile relay," said Jordan.
Hogsett, John Kessel, Henry
and Wingo will represent the
Cards.
The 440 relay will be a real
dogfight between the two L.A.
schools as UCLA's 39.8 is but .1
better than USC's. Holmes will lead
off for the Cards, followed by
Kessel, Wingo and Curl.
Jumps
Although USC's Gerald
Hardeman (26-1 Va) and UCLA's
Jerry Herndon (25-11) have better
distances, Jordan thinks Olympic
champion Randy Williams of USC
should be favored in the long
jump.
Card Mike Hall will be going up
against one of the best triple jump
fields in history. Clarence Taylor
(54-11%) should win. OSU's
powerful high-jump tandem of
Mike Fleer and Tom Woods have
jumps of 7-3; either could win.
Although Ed Lipscomb
recently scored 17-2, the OSU
vaulter does not have the
experience of French Olympian
Francoise Tracanelli from UCLA.
USC's Robert Pullard (16-9) could
pressure the Frenchman with his
consistency. £
Weights
The shotput belongs to UCLA,
as three Bruins currently lead the
list by wide margins. One of the
putters, Roger Freberg, should
win the discus at around 188 feet.
Card Mike Royer will attempt to
get into the 170's.
Steve Hopkins showed he may
place in the javelin when the Card
senior went 230-6 in a lifetime
best last Saturday, but he would
have to go 25 feet further to beat
UCLA's Rory Kotinek (253-8) or
Jim Judd of OSU (254-7).
Decathlon
Stanford's hopes ride with Ken
Kring, who took second last year.
Sam Albanese of UCLA has the
top mark of the season, but his
temper may give the victory to
Craig Brigham of Oregon.
"Because he is so consistent, and
because he has improved so
steadily, I think Ken should place
in the top three," said Jordan.

PAC-8 HOPEFULS—AIy Trompas (swinging) and Conrad Nilmeier
will play key roles this weekend in Stanford s quest for the Pac-8 golf
title. USC has won three league championships in a row and nine of
the last 12, but the Cards' home course advantage could be decisive in
1974.
