## Can Sandy-Less Netters Win? 
### Vlae Kershner 
Suddenly, shockingly, next year's feared
recession in Stanford tennis prospects is now.
A few days ago, it looked like the 1974 Pac-8
and NCAA tennis championship trophies already
had Stanford's name etched on them. Maybe next
year, fans thought, UCLA or USC could overtake
the Mayer-less Cardinals.
But as long as there was Sandy, there was
victory.
Then came the subdued voice of coach Dick
Gould over the phone: "Yeah, uh I was kind of
hoping you wouldn't call. Sandy's quit the team."
Why? Personal reasons. Who really cares exactly
why? The unpredictable, irrepressible Alex Mayer
Jr. does what he pleases.
And what he did do in four â€” well,
three-and-a-half-years of Stanford tennis was with
help, of course, turn the Cardinal tennis team from
a good minor sport team to a great major one.
So write Sandy's Stanford epitaph, not by saying
"the SOB let the team down," but "he was the best
thing we ever had."
No Superstar
OK, on to the present. What Stanford still has is
a solid singles lineup of Jim Delaney, John
Whitlinger, Chico Hagey, Gene Mayer, Nick Saviano
and Mark Mitchell. These guys are all good, but
there's no superstar to carry the weight at the Pac-8
today and tomorrow.
Stanford, originally rooked in the seedings, got a
break when the Washington athletic department
gracefully announced that the original pairings had
been printed incorrectly. In all likelihood, the
source of the error was the Husky tennis coach's
mind, but that doesn't matter, either.
At any rate, Stanford will play California today,
while USC and UCLA must face each other. The
Cardinals are clearly better than the Bears in
singles, and probably will wrap it up right there.

Meanwhile, UCLA is slightly better than USC,
which fell apart a few weeks ago and may not have
come back all the way yet, and will be favored to
win.
Stanford Picked
Tomorrow, it's Stanford vs. probably UCLA.
Delaney can't be counted on to beat Brian Teacher
of UCLA (or John Andrews of USC) at first singles.
Whitlinger, Saviano and Mitchell should all be
favored to repeat their wins at the Maples matches.
Gene Mayer will be under a lot of pressure, as he
just entered the lineup. Hagey is also just reentering
the top six (at number three), but at Alpine Hills
last week, he reportedly played better than even
Sandy has this season.
Doubles is a question-mark, but since
Hagey-Gene Mayer ought to overwhelm UCLA's
patchwork third doubles team, and since I think
Stanford will take at least a 4-2 edge into the
doubles, the Cards ought to win the Pac-B's.
Please check Monday's paper to see if I'm right
or still living in an extinct dream world where
Stanford can't possibly lose.

Switching to a far different topic; the value of
spectator sports has been proven this week by the
destructive, but goddamn exhilerating, USE strike.
People involved in the strike on either side, or in
the media, may in their brain know three million
reasons why strikes are terrible things, but in their
hearts are excited by the whole idea. The same
holds true, on an even greater scale, for wars.
Psychology types and athletic apologists have
long said the benefit of spectator sports is that it
serves as a legitimate outlet for emotions, without
the terror associated with going broke or being shot
at.
And maybe now more of us can start to believe
it.
