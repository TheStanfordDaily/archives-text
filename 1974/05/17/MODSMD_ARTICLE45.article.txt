Kleindienst Pleads Guilty
WASHINGTON - Former Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kleindienst pleaded guilty yesterday to refusing to answer
Senate questions about the ITT case. He is the second
cabinet member in history to be convicted.
Kleindienst faces at least a one-month jail sentence and a
minimum $100 fine, although a suspended sentence could
spare his having to go behind bars.
U.S. District Judge George L. Hart Jr. promised to
expedite sentencing. Kleindienst remains free pending
Hart's decision.
Kleindienst is the highest ranking member of the Nixon
administration actually convicted during the post-Watergate
prosecution, although several other administration and
Nixon campaign officials have pleaded guilty or been
convicted by juries.
Kleindienst's plea to a misdemeanor charge followed
bargaining with the Watergate special prosecutor's office
which had been probing his role in the ITT case and his
statements before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the
Watergate grand jury.
Israelis Launch Revenge Strikes
Israeli jets launched revenge strikes at Palestinian centers
inside Lebanon with bombs, rockets and strafing runs
yesterday. Reports indicated a high casualty toll and heavy
damage.
Lebanese television reported 27 dead, 138 wounded and
20 others missing in seven separate attacks throughout
southern Lebanon. An Israeli spokesman in Tel Aviv said
civilian deaths could not be ruled out since the targets were
near refugee camps.
Israeli chief of staff Lt. Gen. Mordechai Gur confirmed
that the raids were in retaliation for the Arab terrorist
attack on Maalot in northern Israel on Wednesday which
left 20 children dead. "You can see it [the attack in
Lebanon] as retaliation," Gur declared at a news
conference.
In Beirut, Palestinian guerrilla leaders threatened "violent
reaction" to the Israeli air raids. They charged schools and
hospitals were targets and "direct hits" caused "heavy
losses" among civilians at six camps.
Thirty-six planes struck in Israel's afternoon raids at four
Palestinian refugee camps and three border villages. Then
eight other planes went out at dusk to hit a refugee camp
and a road near the Israeli border, the Lebanese defense
ministry said.
Venezuela To Nationalize Oil
CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela's President Carlos
Andres Perez said yesterday the country will "immediately
proceed" to nationalize the American-dominated oil
industry.
Perez made the announcement over nationwide television
after appointing a 36-member commission to prepare a
takeover plan within six months.

The move would affect Exxon, Shell, Mobil, Gulf, Sun
Oil, Texaco and the many other foreign oil companies that
produce about 95 percent of Venezuela's 3.1-million-barrel
average daily output. The companies have 40-year
concessions that would have begun running out in 1983.
The president gave no time-table for nationalization, but
said it will become a reality "as soon as possible."
The United States is Venezuela's biggest oil customer
with imports of about 1.7 million barrels a day.
Nixon Asks Open Hearings
WASHINGTON — President Nixon asked yesterday that
the House impeachment hearings be opened to the public
immediately, but Judiciary chairman Peter J. Rodino,
D-N.J., refused.
The White House request followed the disclosure by
committee sources that the President had once discussed
economic retaliation against the Washington Post and a
Democratic Party attorney.
Rodino said the hearings would be opened as soon as
possible, but would remain closed at least through next
week.
The President's threat to cause "damnable, damnable
problems" for the Post was edited out of the transcripts
given to the committee and made public. But news of the
omission broke after panel members heard in a closed
session Wednesday the original tape of a Sept. 15, 1972,
meeting between Nixon, H.R. Haldeman and John W. Dean
111.
Published reports on the matter prompted the President,
according to his chief attorney, to "respectfully request
that all further proceedings... be conducted in open
session so that the American people can be fully informed
with regard to all the evidence presented."
Four Indicted In Zebra Case
SAN FRANCISCO — Four black men, including a
convicted killer, were indicted yesterday by a grand jury on
charges of murdering three white women during a wave of
13 random Zebra slayings here.
The San Francisco County Grand Jury said Manuel
Moore, 29; J.C. Simon, 29; and Larry C. Green, 22,
murdered and conspired to commit murder. The three men
previously pleaded innocent in the case.
The fourth man indicted, Jessie Cooks, 29, is serving a
life term in Folsom State Prison for murdering a woman
here last year.
Superior Court Judge Clayton Horn set bail at $300,000
each, $50,000 higher than prosecutors requested.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through tomorrow. Showers likely
beginning today. Continued cool. Lows tonight in 40s. High
both days in 60s except in 50s near the coast. Chance of
showers 60 percent today and tonight.

The United States is Venezuela's biggest oil customer

Nixon Asks Open Hearings
WASHINGTON — President Nixon asked yesterday that
the House impeachment hearings be opened to the public
immediately, but Judiciary chairman Peter J. Rodino,
D-N.J., refused.
The White House request followed the disclosure by
committee sources that the President had once discussed
economic retaliation against the Washington Post and a
Democratic Party attorney.
Rodino said the hearings would be opened as soon as
possible, but would remain closed at least through next
week.
The President's threat to cause "damnable, damnable
problems" for the Post was edited out of the transcripts
given to the committee and made public. But news of the
omission broke after panel members heard in a closed
session Wednesday the original tape of a Sept. 15, 1972,
meeting between Nixon, H.R. Haldeman and John W. Dean
111.
Published reports on the matter prompted the President,
according to his chief attorney, to "respectfully request
that all further proceedings... be conducted in open
session so that the American people can be fully informed
with regard to all the evidence presented."
Four Indicted In Zebra Case
SAN FRANCISCO — Four black men, including a
convicted killer, were indicted yesterday by a grand jury on
charges of murdering three white women during a wave of
13 random Zebra slayings here.
The San Francisco County Grand Jury said Manuel
Moore, 29; J.C. Simon, 29; and Larry C. Green, 22,
murdered and conspired to commit murder. The three men
previously pleaded innocent in the case.
The fourth man indicted, Jessie Cooks, 29, is serving a
life term in Folsom State Prison for murdering a woman
here last year.
Superior Court Judge Clayton Horn set bail at $300,000
each, $50,000 higher than prosecutors requested.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through tomorrow. Showers likely
beginning today. Continued cool. Lows tonight in 40s. High
both days in 60s except in 50s near the coast. Chance of
showers 60 percent today and tonight.
Kleindienst Pleads Guilty
WASHINGTON - Former Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kleindienst pleaded guilty yesterday to refusing to answer
Senate questions about the ITT case. He is the second
cabinet member in history to be convicted.
Kleindienst faces at least a one-month jail sentence and a
minimum $100 fine, although a suspended sentence could
spare his having to go behind bars.
U.S. District Judge George L. Hart Jr. promised to
expedite sentencing. Kleindienst remains free pending
Hart's decision.
Kleindienst is the highest ranking member of the Nixon
administration actually convicted during the post-Watergate
prosecution, although several other administration and
Nixon campaign officials have pleaded guilty or been
convicted by juries.
Kleindienst's plea to a misdemeanor charge followed
bargaining with the Watergate special prosecutor's office
which had been probing his role in the ITT case and his
statements before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the
Watergate grand jury.
Israelis Launch Revenge Strikes
Israeli jets launched revenge strikes at Palestinian centers
inside Lebanon with bombs, rockets and strafing runs
yesterday. Reports indicated a high casualty toll and heavy
damage.
Lebanese television reported 27 dead, 138 wounded and
20 others missing in seven separate attacks throughout
southern Lebanon. An Israeli spokesman in Tel Aviv said
civilian deaths could not be ruled out since the targets were
near refugee camps.
Israeli chief of staff Lt. Gen. Mordechai Gur confirmed
that the raids were in retaliation for the Arab terrorist
attack on Maalot in northern Israel on Wednesday which
left 20 children dead. "You can see it [the attack in
Lebanon] as retaliation," Gur declared at a news
conference.
In Beirut, Palestinian guerrilla leaders threatened "violent
reaction" to the Israeli air raids. They charged schools and
hospitals were targets and "direct hits" caused "heavy
losses" among civilians at six camps.
Thirty-six planes struck in Israel's afternoon raids at four
Palestinian refugee camps and three border villages. Then
eight other planes went out at dusk to hit a refugee camp
and a road near the Israeli border, the Lebanese defense
ministry said.
Venezuela To Nationalize Oil
CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela's President Carlos
Andres Perez said yesterday the country will "immediately
proceed" to nationalize the American-dominated oil
industry.
Perez made the announcement over nationwide television
after appointing a 36-member commission to prepare a
takeover plan within six months.

The move would affect Exxon, Shell, Mobil, Gulf, Sun
Oil, Texaco and the many other foreign oil companies that
produce about 95 percent of Venezuela's 3.1-million-barrel
average daily output. The companies have 40-year
concessions that would have begun running out in 1983.
The president gave no time-table for nationalization, but
said it will become a reality "as soon as possible."

administration actually convicted during the post-Watergate
prosecution, although several other administration and
Nixon campaign officials have pleaded guilty or been
convicted by juries.
Kleindienst's plea to a misdemeanor charge followed
bargaining with the Watergate special prosecutor's office
which had been probing his role in the ITT case and his
statements before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the
Watergate grand jury.
Israelis Launch Revenge Strikes
Israeli jets launched revenge strikes at Palestinian centers
inside Lebanon with bombs, rockets and strafing runs
yesterday. Reports indicated a high casualty toll and heavy
damage.
Lebanese television reported 27 dead, 138 wounded and
20 others missing in seven separate attacks throughout
southern Lebanon. An Israeli spokesman in Tel Aviv said
civilian deaths could not be ruled out since the targets were
near refugee camps.
Israeli chief of staff Lt. Gen. Mordechai Gur confirmed
that the raids were in retaliation for the Arab terrorist
attack on Maalot in northern Israel on Wednesday which
left 20 children dead. "You can see it [the attack in
Lebanon] as retaliation," Gur declared at a news
conference.
In Beirut, Palestinian guerrilla leaders threatened "violent
reaction" to the Israeli air raids. They charged schools and
hospitals were targets and "direct hits" caused "heavy
losses" among civilians at six camps.
Thirty-six planes struck in Israel's afternoon raids at four
Palestinian refugee camps and three border villages. Then
eight other planes went out at dusk to hit a refugee camp
and a road near the Israeli border, the Lebanese defense
ministry said.
Venezuela To Nationalize Oil
CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela's President Carlos
Andres Perez said yesterday the country will "immediately
proceed" to nationalize the American-dominated oil
industry.
Perez made the announcement over nationwide television
after appointing a 36-member commission to prepare a
takeover plan within six months.

The move would affect Exxon, Shell, Mobil, Gulf, Sun
Oil, Texaco and the many other foreign oil companies that
produce about 95 percent of Venezuela's 3.1-million-barrel
average daily output. The companies have 40-year
concessions that would have begun running out in 1983.
The president gave no time-table for nationalization, but
said it will become a reality "as soon as possible."
The United States is Venezuela's biggest oil customer
with imports of about 1.7 million barrels a day.
Nixon Asks Open Hearings
WASHINGTON — President Nixon asked yesterday that
the House impeachment hearings be opened to the public
immediately, but Judiciary chairman Peter J. Rodino,
D-N.J., refused.
The White House request followed the disclosure by
committee sources that the President had once discussed
economic retaliation against the Washington Post and a
Democratic Party attorney.
Rodino said the hearings would be opened as soon as
possible, but would remain closed at least through next
week.
The President's threat to cause "damnable, damnable
problems" for the Post was edited out of the transcripts
given to the committee and made public. But news of the
omission broke after panel members heard in a closed
session Wednesday the original tape of a Sept. 15, 1972,
meeting between Nixon, H.R. Haldeman and John W. Dean
111.
Published reports on the matter prompted the President,
according to his chief attorney, to "respectfully request
that all further proceedings... be conducted in open
session so that the American people can be fully informed
with regard to all the evidence presented."
Four Indicted In Zebra Case
SAN FRANCISCO — Four black men, including a
convicted killer, were indicted yesterday by a grand jury on
charges of murdering three white women during a wave of
13 random Zebra slayings here.
The San Francisco County Grand Jury said Manuel
Moore, 29; J.C. Simon, 29; and Larry C. Green, 22,
murdered and conspired to commit murder. The three men
previously pleaded innocent in the case.
The fourth man indicted, Jessie Cooks, 29, is serving a
life term in Folsom State Prison for murdering a woman
here last year.
Superior Court Judge Clayton Horn set bail at $300,000
each, $50,000 higher than prosecutors requested.
