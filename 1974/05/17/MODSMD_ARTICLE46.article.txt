# Faculty Senate Nears Approval Of Professoriate Report Articles

### DON COX 
The Faculty Senate inched closer to approval of the first
two articles of legislation recommended in the Professoriate
report.
During informal committee of the whole discussion, the
senate approved the title "Adjunct Professor" for Academic
Council members currently holding titles of senior lecturer
and senior research associate.
Many members of the senate said that these council
members were qualified to hold a professoriate position and
that their ability should be appropriately recognized.
"We're not upgrading them, just recognizing them for
what they are," said Neurology Sr. Scientist Marion Smith.
The establishment of the adjunct professoriate was
approved widely in a non-binding straw vote.
Medical School representatives lost two other major
straw votes in yesterday's session.
They had argued against the title "Clinical Professor of
(Subject)" for the Medical School's new clinical faculty line
because it carried unfavorable historical implications. The
senate voted against them.

Medical School faculty members had also favored two
ranks in the clinical line, full and associate clinicA.
professors.
Senate members had argued in previous sessions that the
establishment of multiple sub-rankings would pose a threat
to the tenure system by providing an escape from the
critical decision of whether to grant tenure or not.
'To establish ladders in non-tenure ranks in tenure
terminology is deceptive," said Humanities Prof. William
Clebsch.
A straw vote on a motion to delete the associate clinical
professor title carried.
An amendment offered by Pharmacology Sr. Scientist
Dora Goldstein would have lent more permanence and
security to adjunct professoriate positions.
Senate members, including President Richard Lyman
suggested that this might have an unknown economic
impact on the University, one that it might not be able to
afford.
The amendment was rejected by the senate.
