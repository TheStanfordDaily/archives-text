# 'Some Progress' In Negotiations
## 
### 
University and United Stanford
Employees (USE) bargaining teams
met throughout yesterday and
reported some progress in the contract
negotiations.
"There wasn't any dramatic
breakthrough by any means, but there
was progress," said University
negotiator Douglas Barton.
The two sides spent most of the day
on hours of work and premium pay
issues, resolving details concerning
work breaks and overtime.
Negotiations were held off campus
in the Cabana Hyatt House with
federal mediator Clarence Washington
and Santa Clara Central Labor Council
Executive Secretary Emerson Street in
attendance.
Barton said the sessions were held
off campus to "avoid problems of
picket lines and union people being
compromised by working behind
picket lines."
'There is also a psychological
benefit in being a little bit removed
from the scene," he said.
The two sides will meet again today.
Sessions over the weekend are being
considered.
USE President Jim Berk agreed
some progress had been made, though
the pace of the discussions was still
slow.
"It's going to explode into a furious
pace sometime soon," Berk predicted.
President Richard Lyman told the
Faculty Senate yesterday that he was
optimistic about the outcome of the
negotiations and the strike.
"I remain hopeful we're going to see
progress [toward an agreement with
USE], but it can't by its very nature
be a very quick process," he said.
Lyman also said he "cannot help
feeling that it's really sad the strike
started before we got to the point
where some of this, at least, would be
behind us — with a considerable
number of contract points having been
resolved."
