# Minority Counselors Attempt 'Outreach'
## 
### K.C. FLYNN 
"Outreach" has become a key word
in Stanford's counseling and
psychological services for minorities.
Professional staff members of two
University services — academic
counseling in the Dean of Students
office and psychological counseling at
Huston House on campus — are
spending more and more time outside
their offices, visiting minority groups
in informal settings and getting
involved in minority activities.
"We're definitely encouraged to get
involved," says Ray Telles, a counselor
in the Dean of Students office who
spends time with chicano students.
"That means going to dorms, eating

with students and making yourself
available."
Telles is one of two chicanos on the
academic counseling staff on the third
floor of the Old Union, a group
headed by Assistant Dean of Students
Harold Boyd.
"The term 'outreach' derives from
our attempt to take the services out of
the office to where the people are
located," Boyd explained.
'Drop-In' Basis
The minority counseling members
of the staff divide their time between
academic advising for all students —
involving grades, leaves of absence and
registration problems — and advising
members of minorities. They're
available to students on a "drop-in"
basis or by appointment.
Outreach activities involve increased
workloads for the counselors, who in
addition to seeing individuals all day,
now spend more time outside the
office.
But Chris Peters, an American
Indian who works in both the
academic counseling office and at
Huston House, feels that outreach
programs are valuable ways to get to
the problems of native Americans at
Stanford.
"For many Indians, counseling is a
luxury that they simply haven't been
able to afford," he says. As a result,
they are unfamiliar with counseling
procedures. Peters and Gwen
Shunatona, another Indian counselor,
try to get to know all students in
informal situations.
Peters was involved in the recent
"Pow Wow" on the campus, a
gathering of Bay Area Indians. He also
conducts informal group sessions and
organizes peer counseling groups.
Difficult Transition
"One major problem for native
Americans is the transition they have
to make to adjust to Stanford," Peters
says. "Not only to the Anglo culture,
but to the other Indians. Stanford has
members of more than 30 different
tribal nations."
For chicanos, the psychological
problems are similar. "Some chicanos
