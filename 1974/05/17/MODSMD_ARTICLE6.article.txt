# Minority Counselors Attempt 'Outreach'
## 
### K.C. FLYNN 
"Outreach" has become a key word
in Stanford's counseling and
psychological services for minorities.
Professional staff members of two
University services — academic
counseling in the Dean of Students
office and psychological counseling at
Huston House on campus — are
spending more and more time outside
their offices, visiting minority groups
in informal settings and getting
involved in minority activities.
"We're definitely encouraged to get
involved," says Ray Telles, a counselor
in the Dean of Students office who
spends time with chicano students.
"That means going to dorms, eating

with students and making yourself
available."
Telles is one of two chicanos on the
academic counseling staff on the third
floor of the Old Union, a group
headed by Assistant Dean of Students
Harold Boyd.
"The term 'outreach' derives from
our attempt to take the services out of
the office to where the people are
located," Boyd explained.
'Drop-In' Basis
The minority counseling members
of the staff divide their time between
academic advising for all students —
involving grades, leaves of absence and
registration problems — and advising
members of minorities. They're
available to students on a "drop-in"
basis or by appointment.
Outreach activities involve increased
workloads for the counselors, who in
addition to seeing individuals all day,
now spend more time outside the
office.
But Chris Peters, an American
Indian who works in both the
academic counseling office and at
Huston House, feels that outreach
programs are valuable ways to get to
the problems of native Americans at
Stanford.
"For many Indians, counseling is a
luxury that they simply haven't been
able to afford," he says. As a result,
they are unfamiliar with counseling
procedures. Peters and Gwen
Shunatona, another Indian counselor,
try to get to know all students in
informal situations.
Peters was involved in the recent
"Pow Wow" on the campus, a
gathering of Bay Area Indians. He also
conducts informal group sessions and
organizes peer counseling groups.
Difficult Transition
"One major problem for native
Americans is the transition they have
to make to adjust to Stanford," Peters
says. "Not only to the Anglo culture,
but to the other Indians. Stanford has
members of more than 30 different
tribal nations."
For chicanos, the psychological
problems are similar. "Some chicanos
aren't used to going to doctors for
regular medical services, much less
psychiatric services," Telles says. Dr.
Noel Morrell, a Spanish-speaking
psychiatrist, is a part-time staff
member at Huston House. "Morrell is
able to penetrate the resistance to
doctors," Telles says. "He's a friend
more than a doctor."
Dr. David Dorosin, director of
Huston House, says there should be
two goals of the minority counseling
program: "The first is diversity. The
second is outreach: we should be
visible." Minority counseling will
expand next year, adding two chicano
members.
As of now, minority counselors are
a widely diverse group, including Dr.
Allan Seid, a Chinese-American
psychiatrist who spends part of his
time at Huston House.
Blurred Distinction
The line between "academic" and
"psychological" counseling is growing
increasingly blurred. Chris Peters

expects that any new members of the
staff will work in both locations.
"Basically, we provide access," says
Dorosin. "Someone to talk to,
whether the problems are academic or
personal. The commonest problems we
deal with are personal competence —
and that often involves academic
matters."
Harold Boyd, the first black
assistant dean in the Dean of Students
office, estimates that he spends 35
percent of his time with ethnic groups,
planning activities and programs. At
present, he is developing a special
orientation for black freshmen that
may run for an entire quarter. Another
project is a possible program to
"record the black experience at

Stanford," perhaps by audiovisual
means.
Sam McDonald, one of the black
counselors at Cowell Health Center
(part of the psychological services
group) is also involved with the
freshman orientation program. "Ont,
of the big problems among incoming
black students," he says, "is sheer
terror. Terror in what they've heard
about Stanford and terror in the
isolation of the campus."
McDonald spends some time each
week at Roble House and the Black
House. Like other minority
counselors, he "floats," talking to
people, finding out what's going on in
the minority community and getting
involved.

"That means going to dorms, eating

with students and making yourself
available."
Telles is one of two chicanos on the
academic counseling staff on the third
floor of the Old Union, a group
headed by Assistant Dean of Students
Harold Boyd.
"The term 'outreach' derives from
our attempt to take the services out of
the office to where the people are
located," Boyd explained.
'Drop-In' Basis
The minority counseling members
of the staff divide their time between
academic advising for all students —
involving grades, leaves of absence and
registration problems — and advising
members of minorities. They're
available to students on a "drop-in"
basis or by appointment.
Outreach activities involve increased
workloads for the counselors, who in
addition to seeing individuals all day,
now spend more time outside the
office.
But Chris Peters, an American
Indian who works in both the
academic counseling office and at
Huston House, feels that outreach
programs are valuable ways to get to
the problems of native Americans at
Stanford.
"For many Indians, counseling is a
luxury that they simply haven't been
able to afford," he says. As a result,
they are unfamiliar with counseling
procedures. Peters and Gwen
Shunatona, another Indian counselor,
try to get to know all students in
informal situations.
Peters was involved in the recent
"Pow Wow" on the campus, a
gathering of Bay Area Indians. He also
conducts informal group sessions and
organizes peer counseling groups.
Difficult Transition
"One major problem for native
Americans is the transition they have
to make to adjust to Stanford," Peters
says. "Not only to the Anglo culture,
but to the other Indians. Stanford has
members of more than 30 different
tribal nations."
For chicanos, the psychological
problems are similar. "Some chicanos
aren't used to going to doctors for
regular medical services, much less
psychiatric services," Telles says. Dr.
Noel Morrell, a Spanish-speaking
psychiatrist, is a part-time staff
member at Huston House. "Morrell is
able to penetrate the resistance to
doctors," Telles says. "He's a friend
more than a doctor."
Dr. David Dorosin, director of
Huston House, says there should be
two goals of the minority counseling
program: "The first is diversity. The
second is outreach: we should be
visible." Minority counseling will
expand next year, adding two chicano
members.
As of now, minority counselors are
a widely diverse group, including Dr.
Allan Seid, a Chinese-American
psychiatrist who spends part of his
time at Huston House.
Blurred Distinction
The line between "academic" and
"psychological" counseling is growing
increasingly blurred. Chris Peters

expects that any new members of the
staff will work in both locations.
"Basically, we provide access," says
Dorosin. "Someone to talk to,
whether the problems are academic or
personal. The commonest problems we
deal with are personal competence —
and that often involves academic
matters."
Harold Boyd, the first black
assistant dean in the Dean of Students
office, estimates that he spends 35
percent of his time with ethnic groups,
planning activities and programs. At
present, he is developing a special
orientation for black freshmen that
may run for an entire quarter. Another
project is a possible program to
"record the black experience at

Stanford," perhaps by audiovisual
means.
Sam McDonald, one of the black
counselors at Cowell Health Center
(part of the psychological services
group) is also involved with the
freshman orientation program. "Ont,
of the big problems among incoming
black students," he says, "is sheer
terror. Terror in what they've heard
about Stanford and terror in the
isolation of the campus."
McDonald spends some time each
week at Roble House and the Black
House. Like other minority
counselors, he "floats," talking to
people, finding out what's going on in
the minority community and getting
involved.
"Outreach" has become a key word
in Stanford's counseling and
psychological services for minorities.
Professional staff members of two
University services — academic
counseling in the Dean of Students
office and psychological counseling at
Huston House on campus — are
spending more and more time outside
their offices, visiting minority groups
in informal settings and getting
involved in minority activities.
"We're definitely encouraged to get
involved," says Ray Telles, a counselor
in the Dean of Students office who
spends time with chicano students.
