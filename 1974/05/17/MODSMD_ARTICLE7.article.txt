# Against Quotas

Martin Brown

As a member of the Medical
School Faculty Senate which
debated the proposal to increase
the male-female ratio of entering
medical students to 50-50, I
would like to respond to the
recent Daily article on this
subject.
The Admissions Committee has
not "always accepted women in
proportion to their percentage in
the applicant pool." Since 1971
the percentage of women
accepted (and enrolled) has been
significantly higher than that in
the applicant pool. For the 1974
entering class, for example, the
figures are 24 percent and 29
percent, respectively, for the
percentage of women in the
applicant pool and in the accepted
class.
Since there is not (nor has
there been) any evidence for the
superiority of female applicants,
this significant and consistent
difference must reflect a
discrimination against males in the
admission process. In fact, simple
division of the figures shows that
a female applicant had in 1973 a
35 percent, and in 1974 a 32
percent, better chance of
acceptance than did a male
applicant.
Whatever the arguments are for
and against this (and there are
many), the fact remains that such
discrimination is not only against
our law, but clearly it is against
the proposed Equal Rights
Constitutional Amendment whose
specific aim is that men and
wdmen should be treated
identically.
Ends And Means
Dr. Gerald Reaven, head of the
Joint Committee on the Status
and Tenure of Women states that
"he cared more about the end
than the means" in relation to
achieving an equal sex ratio.
Surely this is the problem! We
simply must care about the
means, for that determines the
outcome. In other words, we
cannot use discrimination as a
means if our goal is
non-discrimination.
If we do achieve this 50-50
ratio by active discrimination then
we will have set a perfect
precedent for any group which
considers itself under-represented

(or another group
over-represented) to scream
"unfair" and demand a correction
until the political/ethnic/racial/
cultural/national/religious, etc.,
ratio of the student class equals
that of the population. Do we
really want this?
Unfair To Men?
Dr. Helene Rauch offers the
tempting rationalization that the
discrimination is unfair to men,
"only if you conceive of those
places as belonging to men in the
first place." But I would take
precisely the same stand if next
year the faculty demanded a
50-50 sex ratio in the face of an
80 percent female applicant pool
since this would be discriminating
against women.
Of course, her argument goes
deeper: ultimately it presupposes
that men and women are born
with no predispositions towards
any characteristics or roles, and it
is society which stereotypes us
into believing (for example) that
there should be more male than
female doctors and more female
than male nurses.
The evidence that we are,
indeed, literally bombarded by
sexually stereotyping propaganda
is overwhelming, and clearly it has
an effect which we need not only
to be conscious of, but also to
combat.
Same Predispositions?
I am sure, however, that in the
absence of these influences men
and women would not on the
average have the same
predispositions to all possible
roles. Yet this " sameness" is the
basis for the 50-50 argument,
since it states that, in the absence
of social conditioning, equal
numbers of men and women will
(a) be seeking a fulltime career
outside the home, and (b) wish to
make medicine that career.
I cannot agree with this
thinking. Indeed, I could equally
see 25 percent or 75 percent of
doctors as women.
What I am saying is that if we,
as a center of higher learning,
want to set an example to society,
then not only must we refuse to
set quotas of any kind, but we
must practice equality for all and
shout it from the rooftops.

there should be more male than
female doctors and more female

The evidence that we are,
indeed, literally bombarded by
sexually stereotyping propaganda
is overwhelming, and clearly it has
an effect which we need not only
to be conscious of, but also to
combat.
Same Predispositions?
I am sure, however, that in the
absence of these influences men
and women would not on the
average have the same
predispositions to all possible
roles. Yet this " sameness" is the
basis for the 50-50 argument,
since it states that, in the absence
of social conditioning, equal
numbers of men and women will
(a) be seeking a fulltime career
outside the home, and (b) wish to
make medicine that career.
I cannot agree with this
thinking. Indeed, I could equally
see 25 percent or 75 percent of
doctors as women.
What I am saying is that if we,
as a center of higher learning,
want to set an example to society,
then not only must we refuse to
set quotas of any kind, but we
must practice equality for all and
shout it from the rooftops.

As a member of the Medical
School Faculty Senate which
debated the proposal to increase
the male-female ratio of entering
medical students to 50-50, I
would like to respond to the
recent Daily article on this
subject.
The Admissions Committee has
not "always accepted women in
proportion to their percentage in
the applicant pool." Since 1971
the percentage of women
accepted (and enrolled) has been
significantly higher than that in
the applicant pool. For the 1974
entering class, for example, the
figures are 24 percent and 29
percent, respectively, for the
percentage of women in the
applicant pool and in the accepted
class.
Since there is not (nor has
there been) any evidence for the
superiority of female applicants,
this significant and consistent
difference must reflect a
discrimination against males in the
admission process. In fact, simple
division of the figures shows that
a female applicant had in 1973 a
35 percent, and in 1974 a 32
percent, better chance of
acceptance than did a male
applicant.
Whatever the arguments are for
and against this (and there are
many), the fact remains that such
discrimination is not only against
our law, but clearly it is against
the proposed Equal Rights
Constitutional Amendment whose
specific aim is that men and
wdmen should be treated
identically.
Ends And Means
Dr. Gerald Reaven, head of the
Joint Committee on the Status
and Tenure of Women states that
"he cared more about the end
than the means" in relation to
achieving an equal sex ratio.
Surely this is the problem! We
simply must care about the
means, for that determines the
outcome. In other words, we
cannot use discrimination as a
means if our goal is
non-discrimination.
If we do achieve this 50-50
ratio by active discrimination then
we will have set a perfect
precedent for any group which
considers itself under-represented

(or another group
over-represented) to scream
"unfair" and demand a correction
until the political/ethnic/racial/
cultural/national/religious, etc.,
ratio of the student class equals
that of the population. Do we
really want this?
Unfair To Men?
Dr. Helene Rauch offers the
tempting rationalization that the
discrimination is unfair to men,
"only if you conceive of those
places as belonging to men in the
first place." But I would take
precisely the same stand if next
year the faculty demanded a
50-50 sex ratio in the face of an
80 percent female applicant pool
since this would be discriminating
against women.
Of course, her argument goes
deeper: ultimately it presupposes
that men and women are born
with no predispositions towards
any characteristics or roles, and it
is society which stereotypes us
into believing (for example) that
there should be more male than
female doctors and more female
than male nurses.
The evidence that we are,
indeed, literally bombarded by
sexually stereotyping propaganda
is overwhelming, and clearly it has
