Perhaps the most difficult
thing to understand about the
strike is the administration's
refusal to grant certain basic
freedoms to its own workers.
The administration refuses to
allow open grievance hearings.
The administration is demanding
the right to exclude any witness
they want from the hearings. The
Union has agreed to let an outside
arbitrator decide which witnesses
are relevant, but the
administration continues in its old
position.
The administration refuses to
allow anything political on USE
bulletin boards. This isn't
discrimination just against the
Union since the administration
employs a person to tear down all
political notices on kiosks and
notice boards.
Most dangerous of all, the
administration is insisting that it
has the right to discipline (fire)
any employee for an action it
doesn't approve of, whether or
not it has anything at all to do
with her or his job. Employees
(and faculty) have been purged
before for their political actions
and beliefs.
Outside Arbitrator
The Union, on the other hand,
is willing to let an outside
arbitrator decide on whether or
not an offense is job related, and
thus whether the employee should
be disciplined.
The administration is
demanding the right to discipline

any union members that
"collectively, concertedly, or
individually engage in, participate,
directly or indirectly in, any
strike, picketing, slowdown. ..
If a worker is fired for picketing
(even on her or his own time) and
she or he appeals to the grievance
procedure, the administration
wants the firing to be upheld, if
there is "reasonable cause to
believe the employee has violated
the provisions of this article. ..
Apparently a Union member
accused by the administration
must be found innocent beyond a
reasonable doubt or she or he
loses his job.
'Freedom' Issues
Right now the negotiations are
stalled on the "freedom" issues.
The administration refuses to go
on to the money issues until they
have forced the Union into
making concessions on workers'
rights.
As students interested in the
Stanford community, we can
hope that the Union can
successfully preserve the rights of
the workers to open hearings,
relevant witnesses, free speech,
picketing and freedom from
non-job related discipline.
Personal freedom is everyone's
business. Freedom of speech
without the freedom to keep your
job if you speak freely is no
freedom at all.

Personal freedom is everyone's
business. Freedom of speech
without the freedom to keep your
job if you speak freely is no
freedom at all.

Perhaps the most difficult
thing to understand about the
strike is the administration's
refusal to grant certain basic
freedoms to its own workers.
The administration refuses to
allow open grievance hearings.
The administration is demanding
the right to exclude any witness
they want from the hearings. The
Union has agreed to let an outside
arbitrator decide which witnesses
are relevant, but the
administration continues in its old
position.
The administration refuses to
allow anything political on USE
bulletin boards. This isn't
discrimination just against the
Union since the administration
employs a person to tear down all
political notices on kiosks and
notice boards.
Most dangerous of all, the
administration is insisting that it
has the right to discipline (fire)
any employee for an action it
doesn't approve of, whether or
not it has anything at all to do
with her or his job. Employees
(and faculty) have been purged
before for their political actions
and beliefs.
Outside Arbitrator
The Union, on the other hand,
is willing to let an outside
arbitrator decide on whether or
not an offense is job related, and
thus whether the employee should
be disciplined.
The administration is
demanding the right to discipline

any union members that
"collectively, concertedly, or
individually engage in, participate,
directly or indirectly in, any
strike, picketing, slowdown. ..
If a worker is fired for picketing
(even on her or his own time) and
she or he appeals to the grievance
procedure, the administration
wants the firing to be upheld, if
there is "reasonable cause to
believe the employee has violated
the provisions of this article. ..
Apparently a Union member
accused by the administration
must be found innocent beyond a
reasonable doubt or she or he
loses his job.
'Freedom' Issues
Right now the negotiations are
stalled on the "freedom" issues.
The administration refuses to go
on to the money issues until they
have forced the Union into
making concessions on workers'
rights.
As students interested in the
Stanford community, we can
hope that the Union can
successfully preserve the rights of
the workers to open hearings,
relevant witnesses, free speech,
picketing and freedom from
non-job related discipline.
Personal freedom is everyone's
business. Freedom of speech
without the freedom to keep your
job if you speak freely is no
freedom at all.
