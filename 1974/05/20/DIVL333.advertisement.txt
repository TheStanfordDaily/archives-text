REFUNDS - The refund option will be offered to all meal ticket holders for a second
week, if the strike continues. More cashiers and an improved refund system
should cut the waiting time.
If you would like a refund for the coming week, please go to the Cashier's Office,
ground floor, Old Union, from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., on Monday, May 20
or Tuesday, May 21. Your spring quarter meal label will remain on your student
body card, and we will punch a second hole in the card. You will receive a
cash refund through Tuesday, May 28, at the full daily price of your particular
meal plan. For example, the daily price for a 7-A plan is $3.59. If you request
a refund on Monday you will receive $28.75 ($3.59 per day for 8 days). If you
request a refund on Tuesday, you will still be opting out of the system through
Tuesday, May 28, but you will receive a correspondingly smaller refund.
If you opted out the first week but wish to return, to the food service system,
simply present your regular I.D. card to the checker, starting Tuesday, May 21.
Please call me at 497-4751 with your questions or suggestions.
Sincerely,
- Maxine Anderson, Manager
