# FBI Seeks Patricia, Two Others For L.A. Shootout Participation
##

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Patricia Hearst
and two Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA) members were accused last
night of violating federal firearms law,
and the FBI said the newspaper heiress
was being hunted as an "extremely
dangerous" fugitive.
Later last night, police swarmed
to an area near where six SLA
members were killed Friday in a
shootout. Police said they found a
vehicle possibly abandoned by SLA
members. There were few details
except that two black men and one
white woman had reportedly offered
$500 to a woman if she would allow
them to stay in her house.
When she refused, police said, she
was slashed, apparently by a knife.
The assailants fled, police said. Mice
said the incident was possibly linked
to the SLA.
Hearst, who was abducted from her

apartment 3'/2 months ago and later
declared her allegiance to her terrorist
captors, was accused of taking part in
the shootout Thursday night at a Los
Angeles sporting goods store.
The official change of Hearst's
status from victim to suspect climaxed
a day that also saw an abortive police
raid in search of the fugitives and
recovery of a sixth body from the
rubble of an SLA hideout besieged
Friday night by police.
Named in the warrant with the
20-year-old coed were William and
Emily Harris, a husband and wife in
their 20s and alleged members of the
SLA. All were accused of illegal
possession and use of automatic
weapons.
Randolph Hearst Reaction
A spokesman for Randolph A.
'Hearst, Patricia's father, said: "He is
taking it pretty badly. Because of the
gravity of these charges, Mr. Hearst has
decided not to make any statement at
this time." Hearst, president and
editor of the San Francisco Examiner,
already had endured two tense waits
while authorities identified bodies of
four women found in the fire-charred
house.
The FBI said that with recovery
and identification of the sixth body,
the only persons still being sought in
connection with the SLA were Hearst
and the Harrises. Authorities had
believed the guerrilla band to number
around 25.
"Apparently she has joined forces
with the SLA," said William A.
Sullivan, FBI agent in charge of the
Los Angeles office. He said all three
were considered "armed and
extremely dangerous."
Confrontation Discussed
Sullivan also was asked how the
FBI would treat Hearst if she was
found. "She will be given the
opportunity to surrender. If she opens
fire on FBI agents Or police, the fire
will be returned," he said. He also said
it was possible that Hearst could have
been inside the house that was raided

Friday night.
The gunfight at the sporting goods
store sparked the police manhunt that
led to the fierce gun battle in which
the six SLA members died. Sullivan
said Hearst raked the store with
gunfire as the three made their
getaway.
Asked if it was possible that Hearst,
20, could have been forced to
participate in the sporting goods store
incident, Sullivan said: "According to
the reports we have, Patty was a
willing participant."
Tania' Introduced
The FBI official also said that
information on the case came from an
18-year-old youth kidnaped by the
three, who commandeered his van in
their escape. According to the
teenager, Hearst was introduced to
him as "Tania," the name she said she

had adopted as her own when she
renounced her parents in a message
April 3, nearly two months after she
was dragged from her Berkeley
apartment.
"Based on my experience, I have to
believe she is still here," Sullivan said.
He added she was also being sought
throughout the state. "People have
said they have seen her in several
different places and we are working on
that."
Patricia Hearst already was named
in a federal warrant as a material
witness in an April 15 bank robbery
which the SLA claimed responsibility
for. She was filmed holding a rifle
during the robbery in San Francisco,
but her family and fiance said she was
being coerced.

nature of our operation, we can't be in their
pocket. We're obliged to be the conscience of
the University to some extent."
Since the impeachment controversy, Kelly
has criticized the University policy forbidding
the donation of house dues for relief of famine
in Africa. "If it's a law then it's an idiotic law
and it should be changed."
Liberal Theology, Too
While some alumni think his politics are too
liberal, fundamentalist students think his
theology is too liberal.
Kelly is a Methodist, a trinitarian and an
admirer of the Protestant theologian Karl Barth.
He calls his theology "reasonably orthodox,"
saying "I don't feel free to change the religion,
to make it up as I go along."
He received his doctorate in theology in
1966, after studying at Cambridge University
and Union Theological Seminary. Specializing in
the religions of late antiquity, he served on the
faculty of Scripps College and Claremont
Graduate School before going to Chicago.
There he became co-founder and president of

the Philo Institute, which is dedicated to
research on Philo of Alexandria, a first century
Jewish philosopher.
Bible As History
Although he does not have professorial status
here, Kelly teaches in the religious studies and
classics departments. Underlying his scholarship
is the assumption that the Bible can be treated
as a phenomenon in the history of religion.
Many of the students in his fall quarter class
on "Jesus in the Gospels" were fundamentalists
who were accustomed to reading the Bible
literally and disliked his critical methods of
analysis. Some accused Kelly of being an
unbeliever.
"If you want to understand the Bible, you
can't be a fundamentalist." Kelly says. "I'm
happy to say that out of my courses a number
of people have moved to less hard-line
positions."
But when one student applied Kelly's critical
techniques in a Bible study group, a member
quoted darkly from Psalms 1:1, "Blessed is the
man who walks not in the councils of the
wicked."
