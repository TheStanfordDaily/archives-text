# Premedical Syndrome Revisited
## 
### 
G. Robert Hamrdla

At about this time last year, I prepared an
article for The Stanford Daily in which an
attempt was made to place in perspective the
numbers of premedical undergraduates and
the very real plight they face in academic
competition. In a somewhat briefer essay, I
would like to present more current statistics.
In no way do I intend to mask or minimize
or ignore the very real problems encountered
by premedical students. The number of
applicants to medical schools in this country
has virtually zoomed upward in recent years,
while the number of available places has
increased more slowly.
Stanford's premedical undergraduates
must complete their premedical requirements
(70 units on the average) while working on a
regular major unlike students at schools
which offer premedical majors. (In fact,
however, premedical requirements and major
requirements overlap somewhat for many
premeds since most of them choose to major
in chemistry, biology, or human biology.)
In last year's article it was established that
not more than 18 percent of Stanford's
undergraduates were premeds. Let's examine
more current figures and see whether there
was a change in the trend. According to
official figures from the Registrar, there were
6437 undergraduates registered during
Autumn Quarter 1973-74, or about 1600 per
class.
Applications Decrease
Our statistics at the Academic Information
Center show that 242 of this year's senior
class have applied for entrance to medical
schools in September 1974, an actual
decrease from 1973 when there were 276
such applicants.
Freshmen entering Stanford last
September returned cards to indicate their
"preliminary academic interest," and five
choices were offered; about 300 freshmen
checked Premedicine, and since then a few
have added their names: we now have 315
freshmen who have declared themselves to be
premeds. Similar statistics show 340 current
sophomores and 312 juniors, for a grand
total of 1209. Thus we may conclude that
18.8 percent of Stanford's undergraduates
are premedical students.

This result of 18.8 percent is slightly
higher than last year's 17.7 percent. I do not
believe that this rise reflects a trend, but
rather much more thorough records on our
part. There are simply no data anywhere to
support a higher figure.
M.D. Hopefuls Decrease
These statistics are borne out by the
"Senior Surveys" (Survey of Future
Academic Plans of Graduating Students) for
the past three years. As noted last year,
returns from over 60 percent of the Class of
1972 show that 17.4 percent of the
respondents indicated that they planned to
obtain M.D. degrees.
For the Class of 1973,15.2 percent of the
respondents intend to pursue the M.D.
degree, a drop from 1972.
These figures do not provide anything near
an adequate basis for a claim that the number
of premedical students is decreasing; they do
show, on the other hand, that the number of
premedical undergraduates at Stanford is
stable.
There has been some stimulating
discussion this year in the opinion columns
of the Daily on the topic of specialization
versus "liberal education," especially when
the dichotomy is treated in the premedical
context.
I refer specifically to articles by Dennis
Seymour on March 8 and Ted Schlafly and
John Smillie on March 14. I believe it is also
important to put a proper perspective on this
controversy.
Too Much Competition?
Clearly there are some premedical students
who may in the opinion of others place far
too great an emphasis on competition; this
sort of hypertension may well deflect
attention from the benefits of a more
broadly based education.
At the same time, there are large numbers
of premedical students who manage to
achieve a very successful balance between
their premedical courses and other parts of
the curriculum at Stanford. Blanket
assignment of pejorative adjectives to any
group of students is not particularly
constructive.

The figures have thus been established —
not more than 19 percent of Stanford
undergraduates are premeds. That number
may enable us to place the population in
better perspective, but it doesn't help the
premed who is faced, indeed, with high
competition.
The premedical advising program,
established through the cooperation of the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies
and the School of Medicine and coordinated
by Dr. Marvin A. Karasek, Elizabeth Meyer
.(assistant director of the AIC) and Judi
Shinsato ( preprofessional advising assistant),
is attempting to respond to the premeds'
situation by making premed advisors
available to all who need them, by
establishing in the AIC a place where
premeds can come for necessary information
and routine help and where the collection of
recommendations is centralized, by preparing
a special edition of the Senior Survey for
premeds, by offering an extensive handbook
for students' use, and finally by trying to
combat unnecessary hysteria.
Residence Advising
In addition, a new system of premedical
advising was begun in residences this year;
medical students from the Stanford School
of Medicine are available for informal
advising there in the role of advising aides.
That program will be expanded and refined
in 1974-75.
Premeds should make themselves aware of
the resources of the AIC, the premedical
advising program, and the Student
Premedical Society.
Finally, if you're a premedical student and
do not have a premedical advisor or are not
certain whether we have your name, please
come to the AIC on the third floor, Old
Union, and ask to see the preprofessional
advising assistant so that you can be
included in the programs being planned and
your name added to our lists. But remember
— inflated statistics and rumors can only
create more tension and unfounded fears, so
avoid them.

support a higher figure.
M.D. Hopefuls Decrease
These statistics are borne out by the
"Senior Surveys" (Survey of Future
Academic Plans of Graduating Students) for
the past three years. As noted last year,
returns from over 60 percent of the Class of
1972 show that 17.4 percent of the
respondents indicated that they planned to
obtain M.D. degrees.
For the Class of 1973,15.2 percent of the
respondents intend to pursue the M.D.
degree, a drop from 1972.
These figures do not provide anything near
an adequate basis for a claim that the number
of premedical students is decreasing; they do
show, on the other hand, that the number of
premedical undergraduates at Stanford is
stable.
There has been some stimulating
discussion this year in the opinion columns
of the Daily on the topic of specialization
versus "liberal education," especially when
the dichotomy is treated in the premedical
context.
I refer specifically to articles by Dennis
Seymour on March 8 and Ted Schlafly and
John Smillie on March 14. I believe it is also
important to put a proper perspective on this
controversy.
Too Much Competition?
Clearly there are some premedical students
who may in the opinion of others place far
too great an emphasis on competition; this
sort of hypertension may well deflect
attention from the benefits of a more
broadly based education.
At the same time, there are large numbers
of premedical students who manage to
achieve a very successful balance between
their premedical courses and other parts of
the curriculum at Stanford. Blanket
assignment of pejorative adjectives to any
group of students is not particularly
constructive.

The figures have thus been established —
not more than 19 percent of Stanford
undergraduates are premeds. That number
may enable us to place the population in
better perspective, but it doesn't help the
premed who is faced, indeed, with high
competition.
The premedical advising program,
established through the cooperation of the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies
and the School of Medicine and coordinated
by Dr. Marvin A. Karasek, Elizabeth Meyer
.(assistant director of the AIC) and Judi
Shinsato ( preprofessional advising assistant),
is attempting to respond to the premeds'
situation by making premed advisors
available to all who need them, by
establishing in the AIC a place where
premeds can come for necessary information
and routine help and where the collection of
recommendations is centralized, by preparing
a special edition of the Senior Survey for
premeds, by offering an extensive handbook
for students' use, and finally by trying to
combat unnecessary hysteria.
Residence Advising
In addition, a new system of premedical
advising was begun in residences this year;
medical students from the Stanford School
of Medicine are available for informal
advising there in the role of advising aides.
That program will be expanded and refined
in 1974-75.
Premeds should make themselves aware of
the resources of the AIC, the premedical
advising program, and the Student
Premedical Society.
Finally, if you're a premedical student and
do not have a premedical advisor or are not
certain whether we have your name, please
come to the AIC on the third floor, Old
Union, and ask to see the preprofessional
advising assistant so that you can be
included in the programs being planned and
your name added to our lists. But remember
— inflated statistics and rumors can only
create more tension and unfounded fears, so
avoid them.

At about this time last year, I prepared an
article for The Stanford Daily in which an
attempt was made to place in perspective the
numbers of premedical undergraduates and
the very real plight they face in academic
competition. In a somewhat briefer essay, I
would like to present more current statistics.
In no way do I intend to mask or minimize
or ignore the very real problems encountered
by premedical students. The number of
applicants to medical schools in this country
has virtually zoomed upward in recent years,
while the number of available places has
increased more slowly.
Stanford's premedical undergraduates
must complete their premedical requirements
(70 units on the average) while working on a
regular major unlike students at schools
which offer premedical majors. (In fact,
however, premedical requirements and major
requirements overlap somewhat for many
premeds since most of them choose to major
in chemistry, biology, or human biology.)
In last year's article it was established that
not more than 18 percent of Stanford's
undergraduates were premeds. Let's examine
more current figures and see whether there
was a change in the trend. According to
official figures from the Registrar, there were
6437 undergraduates registered during
Autumn Quarter 1973-74, or about 1600 per
class.
Applications Decrease
Our statistics at the Academic Information
Center show that 242 of this year's senior
class have applied for entrance to medical
schools in September 1974, an actual
decrease from 1973 when there were 276
such applicants.
Freshmen entering Stanford last
September returned cards to indicate their
"preliminary academic interest," and five
choices were offered; about 300 freshmen
checked Premedicine, and since then a few
have added their names: we now have 315
freshmen who have declared themselves to be
premeds. Similar statistics show 340 current
sophomores and 312 juniors, for a grand
total of 1209. Thus we may conclude that
18.8 percent of Stanford's undergraduates
are premedical students.

This result of 18.8 percent is slightly
higher than last year's 17.7 percent. I do not
believe that this rise reflects a trend, but
rather much more thorough records on our
part. There are simply no data anywhere to
support a higher figure.

establishing in the AIC a place where
premeds can come for necessary information
and routine help and where the collection of
recommendations is centralized, by preparing
a special edition of the Senior Survey for
premeds, by offering an extensive handbook
for students' use, and finally by trying to
combat unnecessary hysteria.
Residence Advising
In addition, a new system of premedical
advising was begun in residences this year;
medical students from the Stanford School
of Medicine are available for informal
advising there in the role of advising aides.
That program will be expanded and refined
in 1974-75.
Premeds should make themselves aware of
the resources of the AIC, the premedical
advising program, and the Student
Premedical Society.
Finally, if you're a premedical student and
do not have a premedical advisor or are not
certain whether we have your name, please
come to the AIC on the third floor, Old
Union, and ask to see the preprofessional
advising assistant so that you can be
included in the programs being planned and
your name added to our lists. But remember
— inflated statistics and rumors can only
create more tension and unfounded fears, so
avoid them.

At about this time last year, I prepared an
article for The Stanford Daily in which an
attempt was made to place in perspective the
numbers of premedical undergraduates and
the very real plight they face in academic
competition. In a somewhat briefer essay, I
would like to present more current statistics.
In no way do I intend to mask or minimize
or ignore the very real problems encountered
by premedical students. The number of
applicants to medical schools in this country
has virtually zoomed upward in recent years,
while the number of available places has
increased more slowly.
Stanford's premedical undergraduates
must complete their premedical requirements
(70 units on the average) while working on a
regular major unlike students at schools
which offer premedical majors. (In fact,
however, premedical requirements and major
requirements overlap somewhat for many
premeds since most of them choose to major
in chemistry, biology, or human biology.)
In last year's article it was established that
not more than 18 percent of Stanford's
undergraduates were premeds. Let's examine
more current figures and see whether there
was a change in the trend. According to
official figures from the Registrar, there were
6437 undergraduates registered during
Autumn Quarter 1973-74, or about 1600 per
class.
Applications Decrease
Our statistics at the Academic Information
Center show that 242 of this year's senior
class have applied for entrance to medical
schools in September 1974, an actual
decrease from 1973 when there were 276
such applicants.
Freshmen entering Stanford last
September returned cards to indicate their
"preliminary academic interest," and five
choices were offered; about 300 freshmen
checked Premedicine, and since then a few
have added their names: we now have 315
freshmen who have declared themselves to be
premeds. Similar statistics show 340 current
sophomores and 312 juniors, for a grand
total of 1209. Thus we may conclude that
18.8 percent of Stanford's undergraduates
are premedical students.

This result of 18.8 percent is slightly
higher than last year's 17.7 percent. I do not
believe that this rise reflects a trend, but
rather much more thorough records on our
part. There are simply no data anywhere to
support a higher figure.
M.D. Hopefuls Decrease
These statistics are borne out by the
"Senior Surveys" (Survey of Future
Academic Plans of Graduating Students) for
the past three years. As noted last year,
returns from over 60 percent of the Class of
1972 show that 17.4 percent of the
respondents indicated that they planned to
obtain M.D. degrees.
For the Class of 1973,15.2 percent of the
respondents intend to pursue the M.D.
degree, a drop from 1972.
These figures do not provide anything near
an adequate basis for a claim that the number
of premedical students is decreasing; they do
show, on the other hand, that the number of
premedical undergraduates at Stanford is
stable.
There has been some stimulating
discussion this year in the opinion columns
of the Daily on the topic of specialization
versus "liberal education," especially when
the dichotomy is treated in the premedical
context.
I refer specifically to articles by Dennis
Seymour on March 8 and Ted Schlafly and
John Smillie on March 14. I believe it is also
important to put a proper perspective on this
controversy.
Too Much Competition?
Clearly there are some premedical students
who may in the opinion of others place far
too great an emphasis on competition; this
sort of hypertension may well deflect
attention from the benefits of a more
broadly based education.
At the same time, there are large numbers
of premedical students who manage to
achieve a very successful balance between
their premedical courses and other parts of
the curriculum at Stanford. Blanket
assignment of pejorative adjectives to any
group of students is not particularly
constructive.

The figures have thus been established —
not more than 19 percent of Stanford
undergraduates are premeds. That number
may enable us to place the population in
better perspective, but it doesn't help the
premed who is faced, indeed, with high
competition.
The premedical advising program,
established through the cooperation of the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies
and the School of Medicine and coordinated
by Dr. Marvin A. Karasek, Elizabeth Meyer
.(assistant director of the AIC) and Judi
Shinsato ( preprofessional advising assistant),
is attempting to respond to the premeds'
situation by making premed advisors
available to all who need them, by
establishing in the AIC a place where
premeds can come for necessary information
and routine help and where the collection of
recommendations is centralized, by preparing
a special edition of the Senior Survey for
