# A 						Call For Unconditional Amnesty
## 
### 
Anderson, Hallidoy

Lew Simon, a graduate of
Queens College in New York City
and a deserter from the military
who had been living in Sweden,
was recently sentenced to seven
months hard labor in an Army
prison. He had already spent three
months in solitary confinement at
a military detention camp after
giving himself up in New York as
a test case for amnesty.
Hundreds of thousands of
persons are in American prisons,
in exile, or living secretly in the
United States because they
resisted the draft or some other
involuntary aspect of the
American military during the
Indochina war period.
The case of Lew Simon shows
that at present the American
government plans to deal harshly
with any such resisters who fall
into its hands.
The way to prevent the
government from acting in this
way is to build up political
pressure at the grass roots level for
complete and unconditional
amnesty. Such pressure when
applied to political
decision-makers can induce them
to adopt what is morally the only
acceptable solution to this
situation.
Immoral Coercion
Some have argued that cases of
draft resisters should be separated
from those of deserters. We
believe that both the conscription
system and the laws against

desertion are different facets of
the morally unacceptable sort of
coercion that the military tends to
exercise.
A person who repairs shoes and
then decides to leave his place of
work or even that occupation is
not stigmatized or punished as a
deserter. We believe that the
present approach in the shoe
repair business should be applied
universally.
The government has no special
claim on a person's life that
overrides the call of his conscience
or even changes in his occupation
preferences.
Some have argued that special
amnesty boards like those set up
by President Harry S Truman in
December 1946 should be used to
review each individual case. But
the record of the World War II
amnesty boards was
unsatisfactory.
These boards acted with the
intent to preserve the system of
conscription and desertion laws
foremost in their minds. Many
Jehovah's Witnesses, for example,
who had been persecuted for their
neutralism and pacifism were not
freed.
Complete Amnesty Demanded
We see no reason to believe that
similar boards established by
President Nixon would behave
differently. We want a grant of
complete amnesty so that the
injustices that followed World War

II will not be repeated.
Some people have called for
conditional amnesty. This would
require resisters to spend some
period of time in involuntary
service.
The principal difficulty with
this solution is that it reinstitutes
precisely the sort of forced
conscript labor that many of
those who fled from the military
system were trying to avoid.
In addition, involuntary service
punishes persons for acts (resisting
the military system) that were not
aggressions against innocent
persons. No one should be
punished for such victimless
"crimes."
Some people do not see
resisting the military as a
victimless crime. They would
argue that if one person escapes
the draft and a second person is
sent in his place, then that second
person is the first's victim.
But on examination of this
argument, we can readily see that
it was not the draft resisters who
sent unwilling draftees to
Vietnam. On the contrary, it was
those who ran and supported the

Selective Service System.
People in the Stanford
community should be especially
sensitive to the issue of amnesty
for resisters. Stanford's former
student body president David
Harris spent 20 months in jail for
his opposition to the draft.
We think that now is the time
to begin to build in the Stanford
area a group that will raise public
consciousness on the amnesty
issue. We are working to gain a
blanket amnesty for all those who
have deserted the military;
received less-than-honorable
discharges during the Vietnam era;
refused induction into the
military; or are, or have been,
imprisoned in military stockades
or federal prisons for draft or
military resistance.
If you are interested in working
with our group this summer or
next fall, please write P.O. Box
7570 or telephone 324-8769 or
326-7680 during the next two
weeks.

from those of deserters. We
believe that both the conscription
system and the laws against

desertion are different facets of
the morally unacceptable sort of
coercion that the military tends to
exercise.
A person who repairs shoes and
then decides to leave his place of
work or even that occupation is
not stigmatized or punished as a
deserter. We believe that the
present approach in the shoe
repair business should be applied
universally.
The government has no special
claim on a person's life that
overrides the call of his conscience
or even changes in his occupation
preferences.
Some have argued that special
amnesty boards like those set up
by President Harry S Truman in
December 1946 should be used to
review each individual case. But
the record of the World War II
amnesty boards was
unsatisfactory.
These boards acted with the
intent to preserve the system of
conscription and desertion laws
foremost in their minds. Many
Jehovah's Witnesses, for example,
who had been persecuted for their
neutralism and pacifism were not
freed.
Complete Amnesty Demanded
We see no reason to believe that
similar boards established by
President Nixon would behave
differently. We want a grant of
complete amnesty so that the
injustices that followed World War

II will not be repeated.
Some people have called for
conditional amnesty. This would
require resisters to spend some
period of time in involuntary
service.
The principal difficulty with
this solution is that it reinstitutes
precisely the sort of forced
conscript labor that many of
those who fled from the military
system were trying to avoid.
In addition, involuntary service
punishes persons for acts (resisting
the military system) that were not
aggressions against innocent
persons. No one should be
punished for such victimless
"crimes."
Some people do not see
resisting the military as a
victimless crime. They would
argue that if one person escapes
the draft and a second person is
sent in his place, then that second
person is the first's victim.
But on examination of this
argument, we can readily see that
it was not the draft resisters who
sent unwilling draftees to
Vietnam. On the contrary, it was
those who ran and supported the

Selective Service System.
People in the Stanford
community should be especially
sensitive to the issue of amnesty
for resisters. Stanford's former
student body president David
Harris spent 20 months in jail for
his opposition to the draft.
We think that now is the time
to begin to build in the Stanford
area a group that will raise public
consciousness on the amnesty
issue. We are working to gain a
blanket amnesty for all those who
have deserted the military;
received less-than-honorable
discharges during the Vietnam era;
refused induction into the
military; or are, or have been,
imprisoned in military stockades
or federal prisons for draft or
military resistance.
If you are interested in working
with our group this summer or
next fall, please write P.O. Box
7570 or telephone 324-8769 or
326-7680 during the next two
weeks.

Anderson, Hallidoy

Lew Simon, a graduate of
Queens College in New York City
and a deserter from the military
who had been living in Sweden,
was recently sentenced to seven
months hard labor in an Army
prison. He had already spent three
months in solitary confinement at
a military detention camp after
giving himself up in New York as
a test case for amnesty.
Hundreds of thousands of
persons are in American prisons,
in exile, or living secretly in the
United States because they
resisted the draft or some other
involuntary aspect of the
American military during the
Indochina war period.
The case of Lew Simon shows
that at present the American
government plans to deal harshly
with any such resisters who fall
into its hands.
The way to prevent the
government from acting in this
way is to build up political
pressure at the grass roots level for
complete and unconditional
amnesty. Such pressure when
applied to political
decision-makers can induce them
to adopt what is morally the only
acceptable solution to this
situation.
