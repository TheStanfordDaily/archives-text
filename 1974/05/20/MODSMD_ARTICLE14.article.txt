Inaccuracies Clarified

Editor:
Dr. Howard Waitzkin's column
on the Medical Center linen issue
(Daily, May 17) contained a
number of inaccuracies. These
relate specifically to three points
made in the article:
1) It is true that linen is not a
perishable item, but one or two
day's delay in delivery of linen
certainly does affect patient care
at the Hospital. Because such a
large number of Stanford patients
require a high intensity of care,
linen is particularly critical for
maintaining sterile conditions.
2) Contrary to Dr. Waitzkin's
assertion that "USE does not
interfere with Stanford vehicles,"
the pickets at the Medical Center
have, in fact, done so. On
Thursday, for example, the USE
pickets held up delivery of food
to 100 patients at the Hospital's
Hoover Pavilion for nearly an
hour and a half by obstructing a
dietary truck. They have
continually interfered with other
Hospital vehicles.
3) Dr. Waitzkin claims that
"the linen actually needed for
vital patient care comprises a very
small part of each linen
shipment." Actually, Stanford
uses an unusually high percentage
of surgical linen, up to 40 percent
of our total volume of 17,000
pounds per day. In addition, daily
linen volume in the Intensive Care
Unit is approximately 20 pounds
per patient.
Dr. Waitzkin also wrote that
"most of Stanford's 60-70 surgical
operations a day are in the
category of elective surgery,
which can be done at convenience
within a reasonable span of time."
However, if the Hospital is
forced to reduce its elective
surgery, as he suggested, this step
has the effect of placing patients
in the middle of a dispute which
does not involve the Hospital in
the first place.
Finally, I think it is important
to recognize the outstanding
effort which has been made by
the Hospital's employees. The
strike has threatened to
compromise our ability to provide
a consistently high level of patient
care, but the employees' response
and extraordinary dedication has
permitted us to function normally
despite considerable
inconvenience.

Truth About Aikido
Editor:
Chris Baker's reporting of
Aikido Master Michio Hitkitsuchi
Sensei's visit to the Stanford
Aikido Club portrays Aikido as
yet another relatively unheard of
eastern martial art, full of esoteric
ceremony and formalized
methods of physically destroying
an opponent.
Aikido, in contrast to more
expedient forms of self-defense
such as Karate, Kung fu, and the
like, which rely on devastating
punches and kicks to disable (or
kill) an opponent, emphasizes
techniques designed first to
harmonize with then control
aggressive intent using an
attacker's own energy in throws
and spins.
Because of Aikido's respect for
life and critical reliance on timing,
technique, and spiritual discipline,
it takes years of intense and
demanding practice to master.
Baker's article does injustice to
the art and the dedication of the
students who practice Aikido.

Editor:
I wish to lend my support to
the ideals for which USE is
striking. All employees should be
paid what they are worth, a
decent living wage, and the
University has a moral obligation
to do so.
However, I condemn the
union's tactics; they are
deplorable.
By withholding fresh food and
clean linen from the hospital, they
are endangering the care and
safety of the patients. USE is
holding hostage the health of
uninvolved people in its fight for
better working conditions. There
is no human cause that can justify
threatening the sanctity of human
life.

small part of each linen
shipment." Actually, Stanford
uses an unusually high percentage
of surgical linen, up to 40 percent
of our total volume of 17,000
pounds per day. In addition, daily
linen volume in the Intensive Care
Unit is approximately 20 pounds
per patient.
Dr. Waitzkin also wrote that
"most of Stanford's 60-70 surgical
operations a day are in the
category of elective surgery,
which can be done at convenience
within a reasonable span of time."
However, if the Hospital is
forced to reduce its elective
surgery, as he suggested, this step
has the effect of placing patients
in the middle of a dispute which
does not involve the Hospital in
the first place.
Finally, I think it is important
to recognize the outstanding
effort which has been made by
the Hospital's employees. The
strike has threatened to
compromise our ability to provide
a consistently high level of patient
care, but the employees' response
and extraordinary dedication has
permitted us to function normally

Truth About Aikido
Editor:
Chris Baker's reporting of
Aikido Master Michio Hitkitsuchi
Sensei's visit to the Stanford
Aikido Club portrays Aikido as
yet another relatively unheard of
eastern martial art, full of esoteric
ceremony and formalized
methods of physically destroying
an opponent.
Aikido, in contrast to more
expedient forms of self-defense
such as Karate, Kung fu, and the
like, which rely on devastating
punches and kicks to disable (or
kill) an opponent, emphasizes
techniques designed first to
harmonize with then control
aggressive intent using an
attacker's own energy in throws
and spins.
Because of Aikido's respect for
life and critical reliance on timing,
technique, and spiritual discipline,
it takes years of intense and
demanding practice to master.
Baker's article does injustice to
the art and the dedication of the
students who practice Aikido.

I wish to lend my support to
the ideals for which USE is
striking. All employees should be
paid what they are worth, a
decent living wage, and the
University has a moral obligation
to do so.
However, I condemn the
union's tactics; they are
deplorable.
By withholding fresh food and
clean linen from the hospital, they
are endangering the care and
safety of the patients. USE is
holding hostage the health of
uninvolved people in its fight for
better working conditions. There
is no human cause that can justify
threatening the sanctity of human
life.

Editor:
Dr. Howard Waitzkin's column
on the Medical Center linen issue
(Daily, May 17) contained a
number of inaccuracies. These
relate specifically to three points
made in the article:
1) It is true that linen is not a
perishable item, but one or two
day's delay in delivery of linen
certainly does affect patient care
at the Hospital. Because such a
large number of Stanford patients
require a high intensity of care,
linen is particularly critical for
maintaining sterile conditions.
2) Contrary to Dr. Waitzkin's
assertion that "USE does not
interfere with Stanford vehicles,"
the pickets at the Medical Center
have, in fact, done so. On
Thursday, for example, the USE
pickets held up delivery of food
to 100 patients at the Hospital's
Hoover Pavilion for nearly an
hour and a half by obstructing a
dietary truck. They have
continually interfered with other
Hospital vehicles.
3) Dr. Waitzkin claims that
"the linen actually needed for
vital patient care comprises a very
small part of each linen
shipment." Actually, Stanford
uses an unusually high percentage
of surgical linen, up to 40 percent
of our total volume of 17,000
pounds per day. In addition, daily
linen volume in the Intensive Care
