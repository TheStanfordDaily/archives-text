# Indian Minister Defends Nuclear Test, Economy

### SRI KRISHN CHOPRA 
SAN FRANCISCO—"I do not see any
reason why the American government or
people should react adversely to the testing of
a nuclear device in India," Eric Gonsalves,
minister for Political Affairs in the Indian
Embassy in Washington D.C., said in an
interview Saturday.
Gonsalves was responding to questions on
the underground nuclear explosion in
Rajasthan in Northwest India Saturday which
made India the sixth nuclear power in the
world today. The other five are the United
States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and
the People's Republic of China.
"It may be that some people may draw
erroneous conclusions that this nuclear test is
intended to provide India with nuclear power
for aggressive purposes." This however, is not
borne out by any of the facts, Gonsalves said.
Nuclear Know-How
Gonsalves pointed out that India has
sophisticated nuclear know-how which it has
all along been seeking to develop for peaceful
purposes, in mining, agriculture and the like.
"In the course of this development, it was
found necessary to test a nuclear device," he
said. "The reason for the test is based on our
technological growth and does not in any
manner alter our political stand against

nuclear weapons and disarmament."
Gonsalves, who had come from Washington
to attend a seminar on investment
opportunities in the electronics industry in
India, arranged by the Santa Clara Valley
World Trade Club at the Cabana Hyatt House
in Palo Alto last Thursday, gave a talk on
Indian-U.S., relations during this seminar.
Some 100 executives from the Santa Clara
area electronics industry attended.
"We are the two largest democracies in the
world," Gonsalves said in his talk. But it is
natural that we do not see everything the
same way. It is therefore important for us to
build up our relationships not so much on
ideologies but on a common shared purpose
between individuals and institutions."
American Help
The help of the American people during
the Indian independence movement and their
active role in the building of Indian social and
technical services after independence have all
along been recognized by the Indian people,
Gonsalves said.
'Today, the consciousness of American
presence has not changed, it has only become
more diffused." Gonsalves pointed out that
there has been an increasing exchange of
experts and academicians between the two
countries.

Referring to the disagreements between the
U.S. and Indian governments in the past years,
Gonsalves stated that the judgments of the
two governments differed mainly "on the
Cold War straitjacket and action which was
inimical to us in relation to our immediate
neighbors." •
Government Relations
Gonsalves termed 1971, the year of the
Bangladesh war as "a high point in our
personal relations and a low point in our
government relations." However, he added, it
was from 1971 that the qualitative relations
between the two governments began to
change.
Gonsalves, who has served in the Indian
Foreign Service since 1950, pointed out that,
despite differences, there have been
similarities in the U.S. and Indian foreign
policies.
"President Nixon issued the same five
principles in his Shanghai communique which
we used in our Panch Sheela doctrine [five
principles doctrine] with the Chinese nearly
20 years back. We have really been before our
time," Gonsalves said.
Reconstructing Relations
"Now, having discovered that there were
no basic conflicts between us," he said, "the
two governments have set about

reconstructing relations speedily." Tlie
settling of the Rupee debt was a significant
step forward, according to Gonsalves. "We are
now building up our economic, educational
and technological relations. The coming visit
of the Secretary of State [Kissinger] to India
will symbolize the progress in our relations."
The Indian government has created an
export processing zone in Bombay where
American entrepreneurs are being invited to
set up 100 percent export-oriented industries
under full protection and guarantee for all
utilities by the government.
Marshall Cox, president of Intersil, an
electronics company headquartered in
Cupertino with a plant under construction in
the Bombay export zone, said during the
seminars: "Like most Americans I too had
mistaken ideas about India till I saw things for
myself during my recent visit there. There
is a very high degree of professional skills
available in India, the labor pool is enormous
and the productivity of the Indian people is
damn fine."
More Investment
Cox predicted that more and more
American businessman would be investing in
India in the future. "India is a very attractive
package deal for us. Where else would you get
so many people who would love to work for

you? Where else would you get M.S.S in E.E.
[Electrical Engineering] who know the most
sophisticated designing for less than $200 per
month?" he asked.
"India is a vast country with many
problems," Cox said. "But I have never seen a
more dedicated government and a people
determined to fight these problems."
Gonsalves, asked about the recent problems in
India as reported in the American press, said
that it cannot be denied India is facing very
serious problems partly because of the
climatic reasons and partly because of the
astronomical increases in oil prices and
fertilizers due to the oil crisis. "Both these
factors were beyond our control."
"But the picture of India as seen by the
average American newspaper does not place
facts in the proper perspective because it is
customary for newspaperman to dwell
somewhat more than necessary on sensational
news while omitting the constructive and
progressive facts," Gonsalves said.
Gonsalves stated that despite problems,
"our nation's growth has continued
unhampered." He said that India is still the
eighth largest industrial power in the world
with a record of consistent increase in per
capita income and per capita use of food.
