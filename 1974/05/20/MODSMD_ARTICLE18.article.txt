# Electric Companies Declare Summer Shortages Unlikely
## 
### 
The nation's electric companies
say Americans should be able to
get through the summer without
power cutbacks or brownouts, but
they are quick to point out that
there are a number of "ifs"
attached to their prediction.
Utility officials contacted in an
Associated Press survey said a
successful summer depends on:
— Continued conservation
efforts. People who set their
thermostats lower than usual
during the winter to save heating
fuel should push thermostats
above normal during thp summer

to reduce the amount of
electricity used for air
conditioning.
—Normal weather conditions.
A long string of very hot, humid
days could mean demand
exceeding supply.
— Efficiently operating
equipment. Several utilities say
they have more generating
capacity this year than they did
last, but no one can forecast
breakdowns.
The authorities agree that
Americans are not going to have
to swelter through the summer
because of the energy crisis, any
more than they are going to have
to abandon all driving.
But they urge caution and they
warn that costs are going to be
higher.
Charles Luce, chairman of
Consolidated Edison Co., which
was forced to make voltage
cutbacks to New York area
customers last year, said the
utility has two more generating
plants available this year than it
did in 1973.
