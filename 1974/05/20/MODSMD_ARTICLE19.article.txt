### JAVED SHAH 
Traditional folksongs, a rock
and roll contest, and an art
exhibition by young French artist
Margaret Quirici attracted about
300 people for the French Bastille
Day celebrations at the Bechtel
International Center on Saturday.
Jean Michel, a Graduate School
of Business student from France,
exhilirated the audience with
popular folk tunes from George
Brassens, one of the most
celebrated French folksingers.
Brassens' songs are mostly old
revolutionary themes with a taste
of anarchy in them.
The Quirici's art exhibition
dominated the affair. She was
born in France and has traveled
widely, exhibiting her drawings in
Paris and in Fountainebleau.
Recently she has been working on
etchings and calligraphy exploring
themes of child-bearing.
Quirici said she has been
inspired by the French
philosopher Antoine de Saint-
Exupery who said that "to love is
not to look at one another but to

look together in the same
direction."
"My drawings depict love and
tenderness," she said. "Love is not
sex, but a total commitment of
yourself." "My birds are not
purely decorative but a search of
mystical truth."
People danced and drank wine
into the early hours of the
morning. "These French, they
always manage with such grace
and spirit that I, for one, will seize
any opportunity that comes my
way to join them," an American
guest remarked.
Bastille Day is celebrated
throughout France on July 14 —
it was on this day in 1789 that
French revolutionaries captured La
Bastille to free prisoners who had
been held there without a trial by
Louis XVI.
Marie Christine, one of the
organizers, said, "One of the
reasons for celebrating the Bastille
Day on May 18 and not July 14
(was) to have as many people as
possible to come celebrate with
us."
