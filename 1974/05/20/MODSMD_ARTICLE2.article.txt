# SCIRE Gets Full Funds; SWOPSI Fate Uncertain
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Undergraduate Studies Dean James
L. Gibbs Jr. will fund the Student
Center for Innovation and Research in
Education (SCIRE) at the level
requested by the program's policy
board, the board learned last week.
But next year's budget for another
extradepartmental program, the
Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI), remains
uncertain.
Gibbs has proposed that SWOPSI
and the Undergraduate Specials
program be merged under a single
director, but the SWOPSI Policy Board
opposes the plan.
Because of personnel reasons, no
decision on funding can be made until
agreement on the merger plan is
reached. Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies B. Michael Closson said.
SWOPSI director Dan Lewis
announced last month that he will

leave the program after this August.
Closson said he expects a decision
on the budget "in about two weeks,"
but SWOPSI board members are less
confident.
Gibbs, who three weeks ago warned
both SWOPSI and SCIRE policy
boards that his office could no longer
fund the programs without outside
help, told the SCIRE board Tuesday
he will provide the program $24,900
next year. The board had requested
$25,100.
Reserve Funds
Gibbs told the board $2000 of the
promised funds are from the provost's
progress fund, a reserve used for
innovative programs. Much of the rest
will apparently come from Gibbs'
office reserves, which Gibbs earlier
said had "shrunken substantially."
"We're really glad the dean has
decided <o support us," said Car;
Ridder, chairwoman of the SCIRE
Policy Board.
"To get our program started, it was
important for the dean to make a
financial commitment to get behind us
now, at the beginning. Frankly, he
should have given it [the money] to us
three weeks ago," Ridder said.
SWOPSI Policy Board members fear
the merger proposed by Gibbs would
"dilute" the program's character,
require too much paperwork of the
SWOPSI director and delay a decision
on the program's budget until after the
end of the quarter.
'Greater Communication'
Closson said the proposal was
intended "to foster greater
communication" between SWOPSI
and the Undergraduate Specials
program, which is now administered
through Closson's office.
"The merger has certain advantages
for the programs. It also has certain
disadvantages," Closson said.
SWOPSI board member Janice
Stockard said she thought the merger
was a "drastic proposal. There's a very
different spirit involved in those two
programs. To find a new director to
come in and handle both programs is
just unreal.
"You'd be merging the spirits of the
two programs, and SWOPSI would
come out on the losing side. I can't see
how you could maintain separate
identities," Stockard said.
Time Factor 'Scary'
"The time factor is the scary thing,"
she continued. "Time is really not on
our side right now. Our budget isn't
even set, and if it isn't set by the end
of the quarter our problems are going
to be even greater. I think the Dean's
office realizes that."
Stockard added that she had "a
feeling" Gibbs will fund SWOPSI,
"somehow, some way." If he doesn't,
she said, he will face an angry
contingent of students and policy
board members.

decision on funding can be made until
agreement on the merger plan is
reached. Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies B. Michael Closson said.
SWOPSI director Dan Lewis
announced last month that he will

leave the program after this August.
Closson said he expects a decision
on the budget "in about two weeks,"
but SWOPSI board members are less
confident.
Gibbs, who three weeks ago warned
both SWOPSI and SCIRE policy
boards that his office could no longer
fund the programs without outside
help, told the SCIRE board Tuesday
he will provide the program $24,900
next year. The board had requested
$25,100.
Reserve Funds
Gibbs told the board $2000 of the
promised funds are from the provost's
progress fund, a reserve used for
innovative programs. Much of the rest
will apparently come from Gibbs'
office reserves, which Gibbs earlier
said had "shrunken substantially."
"We're really glad the dean has
decided <o support us," said Car;
Ridder, chairwoman of the SCIRE
Policy Board.
"To get our program started, it was
important for the dean to make a
financial commitment to get behind us
now, at the beginning. Frankly, he
should have given it [the money] to us
three weeks ago," Ridder said.
SWOPSI Policy Board members fear
the merger proposed by Gibbs would
"dilute" the program's character,
require too much paperwork of the
SWOPSI director and delay a decision
on the program's budget until after the
end of the quarter.
'Greater Communication'
Closson said the proposal was
intended "to foster greater
communication" between SWOPSI
and the Undergraduate Specials
program, which is now administered
through Closson's office.
"The merger has certain advantages
for the programs. It also has certain
disadvantages," Closson said.
SWOPSI board member Janice
Stockard said she thought the merger
was a "drastic proposal. There's a very
different spirit involved in those two
programs. To find a new director to
come in and handle both programs is
just unreal.
"You'd be merging the spirits of the
two programs, and SWOPSI would
come out on the losing side. I can't see
how you could maintain separate
identities," Stockard said.
Time Factor 'Scary'
"The time factor is the scary thing,"
she continued. "Time is really not on
our side right now. Our budget isn't
even set, and if it isn't set by the end
of the quarter our problems are going
to be even greater. I think the Dean's
office realizes that."
Stockard added that she had "a
feeling" Gibbs will fund SWOPSI,
"somehow, some way." If he doesn't,
she said, he will face an angry
contingent of students and policy
board members.
Undergraduate Studies Dean James
L. Gibbs Jr. will fund the Student
Center for Innovation and Research in
Education (SCIRE) at the level
requested by the program's policy
board, the board learned last week.
But next year's budget for another
extradepartmental program, the
Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI), remains
uncertain.
Gibbs has proposed that SWOPSI
and the Undergraduate Specials
program be merged under a single
director, but the SWOPSI Policy Board
opposes the plan.
Because of personnel reasons, no
decision on funding can be made until
agreement on the merger plan is
reached. Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
