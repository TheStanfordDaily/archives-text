uiun't matter that
* . women's tennis team
held an insurmountable
er rivals San Jose State,
LiL-l>< vis and California. Doubles
players Chris Michel and Dani
Dall'Armi played every point as if
the match depended on it.
A deep service return by
Michel set up DaH'Armi's
wellplaced volley, and Michel
ended the point with an overhead
smash that skipped a foot inside
the baseline and richocheted
untouched off the back fence as
Cal's frustrated number-two team
stood helplessly by.
Michel's face, which had shown
only determination and desire
throughout the match, revealed
traces of a smile now as she and
Dall'Armi rushed to the net to
receive congratulations from their
opponents—the pair's third
victims of the afternoon. And it
really didn't matter that the
crowd was small and the weather
unpredictable. There were no
complaints of toothaches or not
enough free Cokes or any of the

other multitudinous maladies
which seem to plague Stanford
tennis teams.
Three Shutouts
The Cardinals completely
dominated the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference championships
Saturday afternoon, winning
every match en route to 6-0
whitewashes over each of the
other three schools. Stanford had
expected to do well—but not that
well. "Everybody really came
through," explained team captain
Jane Hayes.
Singles players Tracey Macnair
(no. 1), Andrea Barnes (no. 2),
and Nancy Anderson (no. 3)
breezed through their matches in
the all-day, triple dual-competi
tion, which was interrupted
several times by light rains. Each
team in the tournament played
three teams, which means that
every individual had to play three
matches.
Davis finished second in the
tournament, beating Cal and San
Jose State in dual competition,
and winning nine individual

matches. Cal finished third, with
eight individual wins and a dual
victory over San Jose State. The
Spartans, of course, beat no one,
recording only one individual win
in the 18 matches they played.
Doubles Wins
Stanford's doubles teams were
as impressive as the singles
performers. The number-one team
of senior Terry Albert and junior
Whitney Grant, which won the
Pac-8 championships a week
earlier, demolished Davis 6-0, 6-2
in the morning match, and
trounced Cal 8-0 and San Jose
State 8-1 in the afternoon pro
sets.
"Whitney and I are playing
much better this year,"
commented Albert. "The
tournament experience has really
sharpened us up. I hope it lasts."
The number-two team of
Dall'Armi-Michel, and number
three duo Diane Liebenson-Ann
Feeley won all of their matches
against Cal, SJS and Davis
opponents, though their matches
were a little closer.
