# 'Daily' Strikes Again
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily
Thunderturkeys, capitalizing on
typical University ineptitude,
crushed the Administration
Lackeys 20-2 in a Saturday softball
game at Wilbur Field.
The Lackeys lost despite a
temporary restraining order
obtained by the University which,
said University counsel James
Siena, barred Thunderturkeys
from interfering with Lackey hits
or baserunners.
"Jeez, if those guys are running
the University during the strike,
we might as well close it up right
now," one observer noted after
watching the Lackey
performance.
The Daily's attack was so
balanced that it was difficulty to
single out any particular
performance. "Cap'n Alex"
Hulanicki, Stan the Man Wilson
and Jay "Slasher" Harlow all
homered for the Thunderturkeys,
while Streaker Beck picked up the
pitching victory, with relief help
from Bonita B. Rodden—who

yielded the only two Lackey
runs—and Daily manager Rich
"Old Tilt" Jaroslovsky.
The day wasn't a total loss for
the Lackeys; they did execute the
only double play of the game.
With Mark "Scoop" Simonian on
first base, Daily third sacker Bad
Dave Thiemann slashed a vicious
line drive at Lackey pitcher Fred
Hargadon. Hargadon snared the
liner and flipped to first to double
off Simonian.
"Jeez, that was a good 12 to
14 feet off the ground,"
Thiemann said later. "That guy
[Hargadon] must have extensions
on his arms. It was a sure double
to right-center; I wuz robbed."
Lackey shortstop Frank
Newman, playing his last game
before retiring to the presidency
of the University of Rhode Island,
was unanimously named
best-dressed player on the field
for sporting a headband with
several feathers. "Rhode Island
Red, I presume," one spectator
remarked.
