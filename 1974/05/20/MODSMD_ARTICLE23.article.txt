# Cards Win Pac-8 Golf, Tennis Crowns
## Methodical Golfers End USC's Reign 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Gradually stretching an eight-shot opening round lead to a decisive
24-stroke margin, Stanford methodically ended USC's reign as Pacific
Eight golf champions over the weekend at the Stanford course.
The method, however, involved considerable madness.
Take George Pettinger, for instance. After suffering back-to-back
triple bogies and a double bogie en route to an opening round 79,
Hettinger could explain his misfortunes only by offering an apologetic
smile to his coach, teammates and overly expectant fans.
Pettinger's next 54 holes, though, exceeded everyone's
expectations. He fired a three-under-par 68 in the second round, and
came back Saturday with scores of 71-68. He eventually finished third
at 286, offsetting those first round disasters with two eagles and 11
birdies. After his front nine 43, Pettinger cruised the remaining 63
holes in five-under-par figures.

Teammate Aly Trompas was
similarly heroic. Playing "by far
my best college tournament," he
fired rounds of 68-70-73-71 for a
282 total, two strokes behind
individual champion Peter
Jacobsen of Oregon.
Had Chances
Other contributors to USC's
fall from its Pac-8 pedestal
included Cardinal freshman Glenn
Goethals, who tied for fourth at
293, Conrad Nilmeier, who
finished seventh at 294, and the
Trojans themselves. "We had our
.hances, but we blew it this
morning," USC coach Stan Wood
lamented after Saturday's final
round.
"You have to give Stanford
credit, though. They played super
golf — there's no denying that."
Stanford's victory was the
Cards' first Pac-8 triumph since
1970. It was only the fourth time
in the last 13 years that USC has
not won the league crown, and
was "the biggest thing we've done
in a long time," according to
Stanford coach Bud Finger.
"The most difficult thing in the
world is deciding who to take to
the nationals," Finger said,
looking ahead to the June 19-22
event at San Diego, where only
five players compete instead of
the usual six. No matter who
represents Stanford, however,
Finger anticipates a strong
Cardinal showing.
Tough Courses
"I think we hit the ball as well
as any team in collegiate golf,"
the veteran coach explained. "We
haven't been proficient inside 50
yards, but we've always played
well on tough courses that
maximize our other advantages."
Carleton Oaks, the site of this
year's NCAA's, is a long,
demanding layout similar to the
Stanford course the Cards
conquered this weekend.
"Stanford definitely has a shot
at the nationals," asserted Wood.
But back to the weekend's
chaotic occurrences. Individual
champion Jacobsen reached his
nadir on the 13th hole during
Friday's second round, when his
six-foot par putt slid three feet
past the cup. His next attempt
was also too strong, and Jacobsen
had to scrape in a 2'/2-footer to
save his double bogie.
Incensed but not unnerved, the
cool sophomore collected his
thoughts as he walked to the 14th
tee. He then proceeded to birdie
he next four holes in a row
before a fifth birdie attempt
stopped an inch short of the cup
on the 18th green.
Crucial Swing
Jacobsen's miraculous first-day
finish gave him a one-stroke lead
over Trompas, an advantage he

stretched to three shots with a
steady 71 on Saturday morning.
Trompas closed the gap to one
when Jacobsen bogied the eighth
and ninth holes, but a two-stroke
swing on the 10th insured the
Oregonian's victory.
Jacobsen's four-under-par 280
total left everyone awe-struck but
himself. "I thought I could do it,"
shrugged the champion. "I just
felt I could get it close to the hole
every time I hit a short iron."
Stanford's non-counting scores
were recorded by number-one
man Dave Baskins, who slumped
to rounds of 77-78-73-74—302,
and Brent Murray, who shot
72-74-82-77-305.
The big story, though, was the
Cardinal team victory, which
established at least temporary
superiority over USC and left
Stanford's players unsure of
exactly how to react. "Isn't that
amazing," said Pettinger, sipping
champagne from a styrofoam
cup. "Next year we'll be
defending champions."

Chip Shots: Four Stanford
representatives will begin their
quest for spots in the U.S. Open
today at the local qualifying
rounds in Monterey. Varsity
players Trompas, Baskins and
Nilmeier and assistant pro Ron
Toles comprise the Stanford
contingent for the 36-hole event
at Ford Ord golf course.
The field of 89 golfers will be
shooting for 11 spots in the June
4 sectional qualifying. The
sectional survivors will then join
defending champion Johnny
Miller, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player
et al in the real thing at Winged
Foot Country Club in
Mamaroneck, N.Y. June 13-16.
