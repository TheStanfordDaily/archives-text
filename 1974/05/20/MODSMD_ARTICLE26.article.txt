# Spikers Last At Pac-8's
## Hogsett Wins 440 Hurdles 
### MARK WHITE 
In a meet filled with surprises, Matt Hogsett
saved the best for last and in the process helped
USC upset for the Pac-8 championships over
the weekend in Angeles.
Hogsett, a Stanford sophomore, had established
a reputation for finishing strongly in the 440
intermediate hurdles, often coming from 15 yards
back on the backstretch to win.
Similarly, Hogsett saved his best race of the
season for the occasion when it counted most; the
final Pac-8 meet of the year. Hogsett won in 51.3,
fastest this year in the Pac-8 and sixth fastest in the
nation, and gave the last place Cardinals their only
victory of the championships.
And by depriving UCLA's favored Lynnsey
Guererro of the victory, Hogsett took away two
points from the Bruins, who were edged by USC
1341/2-130'/2 for the team title.
"Being a realist I thought I might place, but I
didn't think I would win," said Hogsett. "It was a
normal race for me; a late surge. I remember
coming off the eighth hurdle and thinking 'I know I
can get them.' Normally you downplay a win, but
right now I'm just ticked."
NCAA Hope
"Tom Andrews (of USC) was leading after 330
yards," said assistant coach Marshall Clark, "and
then Matt shut them down over the last two
hurdles. Matt looks as good for the NCAA's as
anyone we've had in years."
"I don't know how well I'll do in the NCAA's; I
really don't follow track that much. But I think I
can get under 51.0. I'm peaking right now, and if I
can hold off for the next three weeks I'll be ready,"
said Hogsett.
Jack Bellah improved his six-mile time by 80
seconds and placed a surprising fifth against a
quality field headed by John Ngeno of WSU, who

also won the three-mile. "We thought Jack might
have gotten third or fourth, but he got a crampon
the tenth lap, and it slowed him down a little,"
Clark said.
Kring Fourth
Stanford also got a fourth place finish from Ken
Kring in the decathlon against "a much improved
field of decathlon men," according to coach Pay ton
Jordan. "He looked real good after the first day,
but he had trouble with the javelin, and that cost
him a couple hundred points," said Clark.
Stanford's scoring was rounded out by Steve
Hopkins, who placed sixth in the javelin with a
throw of 228-0. But for the most part, it was a
bleak affair for the Cards, as their 17 team points
guaranteed only their fourth last place finish in 55
years.
Tony Sandoval and Mark McConnell were
expected to do well in the three-mile, but neither
placed against the field, dominated by Northern
schools. 'They were both under 14:00, but Sandy
just didn't run a good race, and Mark ran out of
gas. I really don't know what went wrong," Clark
explained.
UCLA Problems
UCLA also had its troubles. Injuries to critical
Bruin point-getters in the 440, javelin and relays led
to their upset by USC. USC took advantage by
taking second through fifth in the quarter and
second place in both relays. Randy Williams also
helped the Trojans with his first long jump victory
of the year at 25-6 3 4.
On the strength of its 17 points in the mile and
19 points in the three-mile, Oregon took third.
Cal's Rick Brown came from behind to win his
fourth consecutive 880 crown in 1:48.1. Brown is
only the second man in history to win four Pac-8
crowns.
