# Netters Top UCLA 5-4

### VLAE KERSHNER 
A few days ago, Stanford's
varsity tennis team was welcomed
back to earth by the departure of
Sandy Mayer and the injury of Pat
DuPre.
But the Cardinals, though no
longer rlmost disdainful of the
competition, showed in their first
post-Mayer test that they are not
ready to relinquish their title as
best collegiate tennis team on
Earth, winning the Pacific Eight
championships in Seattle oVer the
weekend.
The Cards won the title with
9-0 blankings of Washington State
and California Thursday and
Friday and a 5-4 edging of UCLA
Saturday. The win over the
defending champion Bruins may
not have been quite as close as it
looked.
Stanford carried a 4-2 edge into
the doubles, with only the top
and bottom men in the order, Jim
Delaney and Mark Mitchell,
losing. The Cards then won third
doubles, and after that, it really
didn't matter, as the first two
doubles teams, both a set up, lost.
"We really wanted to win this
one for Dick," star John
Whitlinger said of his coach, who
hasn't set any world sleep records
since the misfortunes hit the
team.
Mott Mashed
Whit certainly did his best,
avenging his only loss of the
season by crushing Steve Mott,
6-1, 6-3 in the final match.
"Whit's played just super,"
Gould said. "He could be seeded
number one in the NCAA's,
though he probably won't be."
At first singles, Jim Delaney,
playing with a touch of flu, lost
his match against Brian Teacher,
who is one-and-one with Mayer
this season. The day before,
Delaney won his second match in
three tries against Cal's Trey
Waltke.
At third singles, Chico Hagey,
playing poorly, got behind Ferdi
Taygan 3-6, 1-5, but made an
incredible second-set comeback
and eventually won 3-6, 7-6, 6-3.
"Chico didn't really play well,
but he competed well," Gould
said, echoing his feelings of how
Stanford as a team has played all
season.

Gene Mayer, suddenly
promoted to fourth singles,
proved he was well able to handle
that spot. Friday, he became the
first Stanford player to beat Cal's
giant freshman, Chris Sylvan, in
dual play this year. Saturday, he
simply overwhelmed Tom Kreiss,
6-2, 6-2.
At fifth singles, Nick Saviano
scored an easy, and expected win
over Dave Parker 6-2, 6-2.
However, a notch lower, Mark
Mitchell lost to hot-and-cold
Spencer Segura, 6-3, 6-2.
In doubles, as expected,
Hagey-Mayer had little trouble
getting by UCLA's third team,
Parker-Horace Reid, 6-3, 6-4.
With the match clinched,
Delaney-Whitlinger, playing as a
team for the first time since
winning some 18-and-under
tournaments two years ago, lost
to the veteran Teacher-Mott team,

6-7, 6-3, 6-3. At second doubles,
Mitchell-Saviano led 3-0 in both
the second and third sets, but lost
to Taygan-Kreiss, 1-6, 7-6, 6-4.

Tennis Talk: Stanford's team
now takes a post Pac-8 breather,
though many players, on their
own, are playing at Mountain
View.
Gould is extremely worried
about getting poor NCAA doubles
seeds, as he does not yet know
whether DuPre will be able to
play, and if he can't be teamed
with Whitlinger, Stanford will
receive poor doubles seedings
because both its teams will be
untested ones.
Stanford's Pac-8 title was only
the school's second since the
league was formed in 1960. The
Cards also won in 1972. In every
other year, UCLA and USC have
reached the finals.
