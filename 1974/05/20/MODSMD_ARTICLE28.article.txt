Southern California's Ed
Putnam and Marvin Cobb slugged
home runs yesterday and Mark
Barr held Oregon in check as the
Trojans defeated the Ducks 14-1
at USC to win the Pacific-8

baseball championship for the
fifth straight year.
USC jumped on starter Greg
Richards for two runs in the first
inning and three more in the
fourth, two on Putman's ninth
home run of the year.
USC won the first two games in
the best two-of-three series. The
Trojans won 11-6 Saturday. Cobb
homered in that game, too.
Golf
Tough little Rod Curl
responded to growing pressure
with a crucial birdie putt on the
16th hole, turned back Jack
Nicklaus' stretch challenge with a
two-under-par 68 and scored the
first victory of his career
yesterday in the Colonial National
Open Golf Tournament in Fort
Worth.
Curl, a 5-foot-5 Wintu Indian,
collected $50,000 from the total
purse of $250,000 after his 276
total — four under par on the
7,142-yard Colonial Country Club
course — provided him with a
one-stroke triumph.
Horse Racing
Little Current turned in the
most impressive performance by a
three-year-old this season, winning
the Preakness by seven lengths
Saturday.
The horse covered the 1-3/16
mile course in 1:54-3/5, third
fastest Preakness time in history.
Neapolitan Way was second, with
Kentucky Derby winner
Cannonade third.

The tough, young Philadelphia
Flyers, with Rick MacLeish
scoring the only goal of the game
in the first period, beat the
powerful Boston Bruins 1-0
yesterday and became the first
expansion team to win the
National Hockey League's Stanley
Cup.
A sellout crowd of 17,007
rocked the Spectrum with cheers
as the Flyers closed out the Bruins
on national television, winning the
best-of-seven series 4-2 for
hockey's biggest prize.

superb goaltender, who tied for
the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's
top netminder during the regular
season, posted his second playoff
shutout. He won the series' MVP.

Southern California's Ed
Putnam and Marvin Cobb slugged
home runs yesterday and Mark
Barr held Oregon in check as the
Trojans defeated the Ducks 14-1
at USC to win the Pacific-8

baseball championship for the
fifth straight year.
USC jumped on starter Greg
Richards for two runs in the first
inning and three more in the
fourth, two on Putman's ninth
home run of the year.
USC won the first two games in
the best two-of-three series. The
Trojans won 11-6 Saturday. Cobb
homered in that game, too.
Golf
Tough little Rod Curl
responded to growing pressure
with a crucial birdie putt on the
16th hole, turned back Jack
Nicklaus' stretch challenge with a
two-under-par 68 and scored the
first victory of his career
yesterday in the Colonial National
Open Golf Tournament in Fort
Worth.
Curl, a 5-foot-5 Wintu Indian,
collected $50,000 from the total
purse of $250,000 after his 276
total — four under par on the
7,142-yard Colonial Country Club
course — provided him with a
one-stroke triumph.
Horse Racing
Little Current turned in the
most impressive performance by a
three-year-old this season, winning
the Preakness by seven lengths
Saturday.
The horse covered the 1-3/16
mile course in 1:54-3/5, third
fastest Preakness time in history.
Neapolitan Way was second, with
