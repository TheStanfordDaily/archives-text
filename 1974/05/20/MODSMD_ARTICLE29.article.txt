###

freshman crew teams both placed
at the Western Sprints Friday and

impressive, as they overcame
Orange Coast College late in the
race to finish third, just four
seconds behind Cal. Washington
won this race, as well as the JV
and varsity affairs.
The JV's finished fifth, about
as expected. The varsity,
disappointingly, failed to qualify
for the finals, and finished third in
