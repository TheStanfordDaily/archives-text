# Berk, Barton See Progress; Strike Activity May Increase

United Stanford Employees (USE)
President Jim Berk said yesterday he
sees "encouraging" signs in
negotiations between his striking
union and the University.
Although the University has
announced plans to reopen another
residence hall food service tomorrow,
the week-old strike could intensify if
pickets attempt to defy a temporary
restraining order barring them from
obstructing deliveries at the Medical
Center.
"Now that we are on strike the
University is talking and making
sense," Berk told 275 union members
at a meeting at the Carpenter's "Union
Hall in Menlo Park. "They're
beginning to negotiate now the way
they should have last December. But
we had to knock them over the head
first."
Both Berk and University
negotiator Douglas Barton told the
Daily some progress was made in

weekend bargaining sessions. However,
Barton cautioned, "we've got a long,
long way to go."
According to Barton, negotiators
made "some progress" on issues
concerning hours of work and
premium pay, and agreed to eliminate
split shifts for workers. "As long as
we're moving in that way it's
encouraging," he said.
Bargaining sessions were held
Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and
another is scheduled for this
afternoon.
But even while negotiations
continue, strike activity may increase
at the Medical Center if heavy
construction equipment attempts to
return to the Stanford Hospital
construction site.
USE To Defy Order
Union officials have vowed to
prevent the equipment from reaching
the Medical Center, despite the
temporary restraining order issued
Friday by Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Homer D.
Thompson.
The order prohibits pickets from
"physically obstructing or interfering
with" cars, trucks, construction
equipment or pedestrians at the
Medical Center, "whether by standing,
sitting, massing, milling, lying,
blocking or in any other manner."
The order covers the entire Medical
Center to Welch Road, and extends
down Quarry Road to include Hoover
Pavilion.
'We Have Our Plan'
Bob Anderson, an organizer from
USE's parent union, the Service
Employees International Union,
AFL-CIO, said yesterday that "we
have our plan" for keeping cranes and
other equipment from the
construction site.
"The intention of the injunction is
to prevent us from preventing passage
of the crane onto the construction
site," said Anderson, who replaced
Berk last week as strike operations
coordinator.
"We will use every means at our
disposal—l'm not talking about
anything violent—to prevent the entry
of machinery into the site."
Anderson said that while "I can't
tell you what individuals on the picket
lines will do," the pickets "know
what's expected of them and know
they have to stop the entry of the
crane."
Crane Blocked Last Week
A crane was turned back last
Tuesday, before the temporary
restraining order was issued, when
Berk sat in front of the vehicle's
wheels. Berk was arrested and cited for
blocking a public thoroughfare, but
the crane eventually left when other
pickets indicated they would continue
to block the entrance.
On Friday, pickets blocked the
Medical Center's loading dock area
after claiming that delivery drivers
were continuing to drive through the
picket lines at unsafe speeds. Some
pickets have been bumped by delivery
vehicles since the strike began.
After the temporary restraining
order was issued, Anderson met with
Medical Center legal counsel John
Schwartz, Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig and Asst. Vice President
for Medical Affairs Peter Carpenter to
work out an agreement on allowing
trucks to pass through the lines.
Trucks Slowed
Under their agreement, a Palo Alto
police officer halted entering and
departing trucks before they reached

the lines. The pickets then separated
and allowed the trucks to pass through
slowly, at the same time appealing to
the drivers not to cross the lines.
Since the agreement was reached,
said Carpenter, "we have had very
little difficulty in getting in and out"
of the loading dock area. "We've been
able to get most of the supplies we
need into the hospital," he said.
The hospital had been the scene of
an earlier dispute over linen deliveries.
The union had said it would not
interfere with "essential" deliveries,
but on Monday, pickets turned back
deliveries of fresh linen.
Hospital officials accused the union
of reneging, claiming that fresh linen
was necessary to essential surgery.
However, Carpenter said yesterday that the
linen situation had improved significantly.
Hospital spokesmen had said last week that no
essential surgery had been curtailed.
Carpenter praised "the vast majority" of
pickets who, he said, "have conducted
themselves in a very satisfactory manner."
However, he emphasized that no hospital
employees were included in the 1400-member
bargaining unit of service, technical and
maintenance employees, and said that only a
few hospital employees had stayed away from
work during the strike's first week.
Anderson refused to say what specific action
might be taken at the Medical Center today in
the face of the University's temporary
restraining order.
'Come And Watch'
He said there is "a strong desire between
management and us to prevent sitdowns" at the
loading docks, but said there would be such
sitdowns if picketers were injured. He declined
to say how the pickets would turn back the

crane; "come down and watch," he suggested.
Judge Thompson set a show-cause hearing for
9 a.m. Friday on whether the temporary
restraining order should be made into a
permanent injunction. Union representatives
have indicated that they would oppose that
injunction in court.
Meanwhile, the University confirmed rumors
yesterday that a third residence hall food
service—Florence Moore— will reopen Tuesday.
Extra Hours
The Florence Moore operation joins Wilbur
and Stern Halls, where service was concentrated
after the strike began. All three halls will be
open expanded hours.
The University will also again issue board
rebates to those students wanting them The
rebates will be disbursed today and tomorrow at
the Old Union cashier's office.
Students who opted out of the system last
week will automatically be reincluded in the
system unless they receive another week's
rebate.

afternoon.
But even while negotiations
continue, strike activity may increase
at the Medical Center if heavy
construction equipment attempts to
return to the Stanford Hospital
construction site.
USE To Defy Order
Union officials have vowed to
prevent the equipment from reaching
the Medical Center, despite the
temporary restraining order issued
Friday by Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Homer D.
Thompson.
The order prohibits pickets from
"physically obstructing or interfering
with" cars, trucks, construction
equipment or pedestrians at the
Medical Center, "whether by standing,
sitting, massing, milling, lying,
blocking or in any other manner."
The order covers the entire Medical
Center to Welch Road, and extends
down Quarry Road to include Hoover
Pavilion.
'We Have Our Plan'
Bob Anderson, an organizer from
USE's parent union, the Service
Employees International Union,
AFL-CIO, said yesterday that "we
have our plan" for keeping cranes and
other equipment from the
construction site.
"The intention of the injunction is
to prevent us from preventing passage
of the crane onto the construction
site," said Anderson, who replaced
Berk last week as strike operations
coordinator.
"We will use every means at our
disposal—l'm not talking about
anything violent—to prevent the entry
of machinery into the site."
Anderson said that while "I can't
tell you what individuals on the picket
lines will do," the pickets "know
what's expected of them and know
they have to stop the entry of the
crane."
Crane Blocked Last Week
A crane was turned back last
Tuesday, before the temporary
restraining order was issued, when
Berk sat in front of the vehicle's
wheels. Berk was arrested and cited for
blocking a public thoroughfare, but
the crane eventually left when other
pickets indicated they would continue
to block the entrance.
On Friday, pickets blocked the
Medical Center's loading dock area
after claiming that delivery drivers
were continuing to drive through the
picket lines at unsafe speeds. Some
pickets have been bumped by delivery
vehicles since the strike began.
After the temporary restraining
order was issued, Anderson met with
Medical Center legal counsel John
Schwartz, Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig and Asst. Vice President
for Medical Affairs Peter Carpenter to
work out an agreement on allowing
trucks to pass through the lines.
Trucks Slowed
Under their agreement, a Palo Alto
police officer halted entering and
departing trucks before they reached

the lines. The pickets then separated
and allowed the trucks to pass through
slowly, at the same time appealing to
the drivers not to cross the lines.
Since the agreement was reached,
said Carpenter, "we have had very
little difficulty in getting in and out"
of the loading dock area. "We've been
able to get most of the supplies we
need into the hospital," he said.
The hospital had been the scene of
an earlier dispute over linen deliveries.
The union had said it would not
interfere with "essential" deliveries,
but on Monday, pickets turned back
deliveries of fresh linen.
Hospital officials accused the union
of reneging, claiming that fresh linen
was necessary to essential surgery.
However, Carpenter said yesterday that the
linen situation had improved significantly.
Hospital spokesmen had said last week that no
essential surgery had been curtailed.
Carpenter praised "the vast majority" of
pickets who, he said, "have conducted
themselves in a very satisfactory manner."
However, he emphasized that no hospital
employees were included in the 1400-member
bargaining unit of service, technical and
maintenance employees, and said that only a
few hospital employees had stayed away from
work during the strike's first week.
Anderson refused to say what specific action
might be taken at the Medical Center today in
the face of the University's temporary
restraining order.
'Come And Watch'
He said there is "a strong desire between
management and us to prevent sitdowns" at the
loading docks, but said there would be such
sitdowns if picketers were injured. He declined
to say how the pickets would turn back the

crane; "come down and watch," he suggested.
Judge Thompson set a show-cause hearing for
9 a.m. Friday on whether the temporary
restraining order should be made into a
permanent injunction. Union representatives
have indicated that they would oppose that
injunction in court.
Meanwhile, the University confirmed rumors
yesterday that a third residence hall food
service—Florence Moore— will reopen Tuesday.
Extra Hours
The Florence Moore operation joins Wilbur
and Stern Halls, where service was concentrated
after the strike began. All three halls will be
open expanded hours.
The University will also again issue board
rebates to those students wanting them The
rebates will be disbursed today and tomorrow at
the Old Union cashier's office.
Students who opted out of the system last
week will automatically be reincluded in the
system unless they receive another week's
rebate.

United Stanford Employees (USE)
President Jim Berk said yesterday he
sees "encouraging" signs in
negotiations between his striking
union and the University.
Although the University has
announced plans to reopen another
residence hall food service tomorrow,
the week-old strike could intensify if
pickets attempt to defy a temporary
restraining order barring them from
obstructing deliveries at the Medical
Center.
"Now that we are on strike the
University is talking and making
sense," Berk told 275 union members
at a meeting at the Carpenter's "Union
Hall in Menlo Park. "They're
beginning to negotiate now the way
they should have last December. But
we had to knock them over the head

Both Berk and University
negotiator Douglas Barton told the
Daily some progress was made in

weekend bargaining sessions. However,
Barton cautioned, "we've got a long,
long way to go."
According to Barton, negotiators
made "some progress" on issues
concerning hours of work and
premium pay, and agreed to eliminate
split shifts for workers. "As long as
we're moving in that way it's
encouraging," he said.

anything violent—to prevent the entry
of machinery into the site."
Anderson said that while "I can't
tell you what individuals on the picket
lines will do," the pickets "know
what's expected of them and know
they have to stop the entry of the
crane."
Crane Blocked Last Week
A crane was turned back last
Tuesday, before the temporary
restraining order was issued, when
Berk sat in front of the vehicle's
wheels. Berk was arrested and cited for
blocking a public thoroughfare, but
the crane eventually left when other
pickets indicated they would continue
to block the entrance.
On Friday, pickets blocked the
Medical Center's loading dock area
after claiming that delivery drivers
were continuing to drive through the
picket lines at unsafe speeds. Some
pickets have been bumped by delivery
vehicles since the strike began.
After the temporary restraining
order was issued, Anderson met with
Medical Center legal counsel John
Schwartz, Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig and Asst. Vice President
for Medical Affairs Peter Carpenter to
work out an agreement on allowing
trucks to pass through the lines.
Trucks Slowed
Under their agreement, a Palo Alto
police officer halted entering and
departing trucks before they reached

the lines. The pickets then separated
and allowed the trucks to pass through
slowly, at the same time appealing to
the drivers not to cross the lines.
Since the agreement was reached,
said Carpenter, "we have had very
little difficulty in getting in and out"
of the loading dock area. "We've been
able to get most of the supplies we
need into the hospital," he said.
The hospital had been the scene of
an earlier dispute over linen deliveries.
The union had said it would not
interfere with "essential" deliveries,
but on Monday, pickets turned back
deliveries of fresh linen.
Hospital officials accused the union
of reneging, claiming that fresh linen
was necessary to essential surgery.
However, Carpenter said yesterday that the
linen situation had improved significantly.
Hospital spokesmen had said last week that no
essential surgery had been curtailed.
Carpenter praised "the vast majority" of
pickets who, he said, "have conducted
themselves in a very satisfactory manner."
However, he emphasized that no hospital
employees were included in the 1400-member
bargaining unit of service, technical and
maintenance employees, and said that only a
few hospital employees had stayed away from
work during the strike's first week.
Anderson refused to say what specific action
might be taken at the Medical Center today in
the face of the University's temporary
restraining order.
'Come And Watch'
He said there is "a strong desire between
management and us to prevent sitdowns" at the
loading docks, but said there would be such
sitdowns if picketers were injured. He declined
to say how the pickets would turn back the

crane; "come down and watch," he suggested.
Judge Thompson set a show-cause hearing for
9 a.m. Friday on whether the temporary
restraining order should be made into a
permanent injunction. Union representatives
have indicated that they would oppose that
injunction in court.
Meanwhile, the University confirmed rumors
yesterday that a third residence hall food
service—Florence Moore— will reopen Tuesday.
Extra Hours
The Florence Moore operation joins Wilbur
and Stern Halls, where service was concentrated
after the strike began. All three halls will be
open expanded hours.
The University will also again issue board
rebates to those students wanting them The
rebates will be disbursed today and tomorrow at
the Old Union cashier's office.
Students who opted out of the system last
week will automatically be reincluded in the
system unless they receive another week's
rebate.

United Stanford Employees (USE)
President Jim Berk said yesterday he
sees "encouraging" signs in
negotiations between his striking
union and the University.
Although the University has
announced plans to reopen another
residence hall food service tomorrow,
the week-old strike could intensify if
pickets attempt to defy a temporary
restraining order barring them from
obstructing deliveries at the Medical
Center.
"Now that we are on strike the
University is talking and making
sense," Berk told 275 union members
at a meeting at the Carpenter's "Union
Hall in Menlo Park. "They're
beginning to negotiate now the way
they should have last December. But
we had to knock them over the head
first."
Both Berk and University
negotiator Douglas Barton told the
Daily some progress was made in

weekend bargaining sessions. However,
Barton cautioned, "we've got a long,
long way to go."
According to Barton, negotiators
made "some progress" on issues
concerning hours of work and
premium pay, and agreed to eliminate
split shifts for workers. "As long as
we're moving in that way it's
encouraging," he said.
Bargaining sessions were held
Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and
another is scheduled for this
afternoon.
But even while negotiations
continue, strike activity may increase
at the Medical Center if heavy
construction equipment attempts to
return to the Stanford Hospital
construction site.
USE To Defy Order
Union officials have vowed to
prevent the equipment from reaching
the Medical Center, despite the
temporary restraining order issued
Friday by Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Homer D.
Thompson.
The order prohibits pickets from
"physically obstructing or interfering
with" cars, trucks, construction
equipment or pedestrians at the
Medical Center, "whether by standing,
sitting, massing, milling, lying,
blocking or in any other manner."
The order covers the entire Medical
Center to Welch Road, and extends
down Quarry Road to include Hoover
Pavilion.
'We Have Our Plan'
Bob Anderson, an organizer from
USE's parent union, the Service
Employees International Union,
AFL-CIO, said yesterday that "we
have our plan" for keeping cranes and
other equipment from the
construction site.
"The intention of the injunction is
to prevent us from preventing passage
of the crane onto the construction
site," said Anderson, who replaced
Berk last week as strike operations
coordinator.
"We will use every means at our
disposal—l'm not talking about
anything violent—to prevent the entry
of machinery into the site."
