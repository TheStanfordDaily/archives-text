# Berk, Barton See Progress; Strike Activity May Increase

President Jim Berk said yesterday he
sees "encouraging" signs in
negotiations between his striking
union and the University.
Although the University has
announced plans to reopen another
residence hall food service tomorrow,
the week-old strike could intensify if
pickets attempt to defy a temporary
restraining order barring them from
obstructing deliveries at the Medical
Center.
"Now that we are on strike the
University is talking and making
sense," Berk told 275 union members
at a meeting at the Carpenter's "Union
Hall in Menlo Park. "They're
beginning to negotiate now the way
they should have last December. But
we had to knock them over the head
first."
Both Berk and University
negotiator Douglas Barton told the
Daily some progress was made in

weekend bargaining sessions. However,
Barton cautioned, "we've got a long,
long way to go."
According to Barton, negotiators
made "some progress" on issues
concerning hours of work and
premium pay, and agreed to eliminate
split shifts for workers. "As long as
we're moving in that way it's
encouraging," he said.
Bargaining sessions were held
Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and
another is scheduled for this
afternoon.
But even while negotiations
continue, strike activity may increase
at the Medical Center if heavy
construction equipment attempts to
return to the Stanford Hospital
construction site.
USE To Defy Order
Union officials have vowed to
prevent the equipment from reaching
the Medical Center, despite the
temporary restraining order issued
Friday by Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Homer D.
Thompson.
The order prohibits pickets from
"physically obstructing or interfering
with" cars, trucks, construction
equipment or pedestrians at the
Medical Center, "whether by standing,
sitting, massing, milling, lying,
blocking or in any other manner."
The order covers the entire Medical
Center to Welch Road, and extends
down Quarry Road to include Hoover
Pavilion.
'We Have Our Plan'
Bob Anderson, an organizer from
USE's parent union, the Service
Employees International Union,
AFL-CIO, said yesterday that "we
have our plan" for keeping cranes and
other equipment from the
construction site.
"The intention of the injunction is
to prevent us from preventing passage
of the crane onto the construction
site," said Anderson, who replaced
Berk last week as strike operations
coordinator.
"We will use every means at our
disposal—l'm not talking about
anything violent—to prevent the entry
of machinery into the site."
Anderson said that while "I can't
tell you what individuals on the picket
lines will do," the pickets "know
what's expected of them and know
they have to stop the entry of the
crane."
Crane Blocked Last Week
A crane was turned back last
Tuesday, before the temporary
restraining order was issued, when
Berk sat in front of the vehicle's
wheels. Berk was arrested and cited for
blocking a public thoroughfare, but
the crane eventually left when other
pickets indicated they would continue
to block the entrance.
On Friday, pickets blocked the
Medical Center's loading dock area
after claiming that delivery drivers
were continuing to drive through the
picket lines at unsafe speeds. Some
pickets have been bumped by delivery
vehicles since the strike began.
After the temporary restraining
order was issued, Anderson met with
Medical Center legal counsel John
Schwartz, Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig and Asst. Vice President
for Medical Affairs Peter Carpenter to
work out an agreement on allowing
trucks to pass through the lines.
Trucks Slowed
Under their agreement, a Palo Alto
police officer halted entering and
departing trucks before they reached

the lines. The pickets then separated
and allowed the trucks to pass through
slowly, at the same time appealing to
the drivers not to cross the lines.
Since the agreement was reached,
said Carpenter, "we have had very
little difficulty in getting in and out"
of the loading dock area. "We've been
able to get most of the supplies we
need into the hospital," he said.
The hospital had been the scene of
an earlier dispute over linen deliveries.
The union had said it would not
interfere with "essential" deliveries,
but on Monday, pickets turned back
deliveries of fresh linen.
Hospital officials accused the union
of reneging, claiming that fresh linen
