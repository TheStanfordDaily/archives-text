GOP Fund Raising Hurl?
WASHINGTON — Republican leaders
conceded yesterday that Watergate and the
fading popularity of President Nixon is hurting
GOP fund raising. But they insisted that
President Nixon should not resign, even if he is
impeached by the House.
"I'm having a great deal of trouble raising
money," Sen. William Brock, R-Tenn., chairman
of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee,
said on NBC's Meet the Press.
In a separate interview, GOP chairman George
Bush agreed that some Republicans are having
campaign financial woes.
But he said the national committee's fund
drive nonetheless is running ahead of schedule.
Both men, along with Rep. Robert Michel,
R-111., head of the House Republican Campaign
Committee, rejected a suggestion attributed to
Sen. Barry M. Goldwater, R-Ariz., that if
impeached the President should step down
rather than subject the party and the country to
the ordeal of a trial in the Senate.
The country "should leave aside political
expediency and see the process through," Bush
said on ABC's Issues and Answers.
"I'm just unalterably opposed to that route,"
Michel said in a joint appearance with Brock.
The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled
to resume hearing impeachment evidence behind
closed doors tomorrow. Two of its members
said yesterday the White House is trying to
degrade the committee by criticizing leaks from
its secret hearings.
House To Act On Viet Aid Bill
WASHINGTON - A new effort to boost U.S.
military aid for South Vietnam by $274 million
threatens a floor fight early this week as the
House acts on a $22.6 billion weapons
authorization bill.
At the same time, House Democratic Leader
Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. says he'll propose an
amendment to cut U.S. troops abroad by
100,000 men — nearly one-fourth — in action
scheduled late tomorrow.
And Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., who forged a
coalition of economy bloc congressmen and
military spending critics to chop $1 billion off a
similar bill last year, is trying to do the same to
cut $733 million this year.
The military spending action and a final
Senate vote today on a $23 billion education
bill with an anti-busing rider lead off a busy
week in Congress that includes scheduled action
on major energy bills, a new federal antipoverty
program and a boost of the national debt limit.
New bills that would give President Nixon
power to ration gasoline and other fuels are in
both the House and Senate.
The House bill also would roll domestic crude
oil and refined petroleum product prices back to
Nov. 1, 1973, levels — and an effort may be
made to add a price rollback to the Senate bill.
The House also is scheduled tentatively to
take up proposed bills to repeal or phase out the
oil depletion allowance and to impose an
estimated $30 billion in taxes on excess oil
profits over the next six years.
Strike Cripples Northern Ireland
BELFAST — A state of emergency was

declared in Northern Ireland yesterday as a
five-day-old general strike called by militant
Protestants threatened the already crippled
province with a complete power blackout.
Merlyn Rees, Britain's minister for Northern
Ireland, issued the declaration allowing him to
call in troops to man power stations and other
essential services.
"The total breakdown of the supply of
electricity would create a quite unprecedented
situation and would present the gravest possible
threat to the life of the community," Rees said.
The strike has closed factories, shops and
shipyards for days at a cost estimated by the
Confederation of British Industry at $9.6
million a day in lost production.
The only one of the province's five power
stations still operating yesterday was powered
by oil requiring no workers to maintain the
machinery.
The other four closed when the men who
shovel coal for the generators went on strike.
Several hundred British army technicians flew
into Belfast yesterday to stand by for power
station duty. Army engineers were also
reportedly on alert in Britain and West
Germany.
Rees said he would use troops only as a "last
resort."
A spokesman for the Ulster Workers Council,
the Protestant group which organized the strike,
reacted: "We will not be blackmailed with the
threat of troops at the power stations. It's no
use trying to use jackboot tactics."
The Protestant militants are demanding
election of a new provincial assembly and
cancellation of the Sunnydale agreement which
provides for greater cooperation between
Northern Ireland, which has a Protestant
majority, and the predominantly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic.
Poll: Americans Confident
PRINCETON, N.J. — More than two-thirds of
Americans have "quite a lot" of confidence in
the future of the country, the latest Gallup poll
shows.
The survey comes at a time when Americans
have registered sharp disapproval with the way
Congress and the President are doing their jobs.
Sixty-eight percent of the 1537 adults
interviewed March 29 through April 1 said they
had "quite a lot" of confidence in the future of
the nation, 19 percent had "some" confidence,
10 percent had "very little" confidence, two
percent had none and one percent offered no
opinion.
The survey showed that age, sex, race and
level of formal education caused sharp
differences regarding the response given to the
question, "How much confidence do you have
in the future of the United States: Quite a lot,
some, very little or none at all?"
The high confidence figure came despite
another recent Gallup poll in which only 47
percent of those surveyed said they disapproved
of the way Congress was handling its job, 30
percent said they approved and 23 percent were
undecided.
The same survey showed President Nixon's
approval rating to be 25 percent, matching his
previous low point.

No Australian Vote Tab Yet
SYDNEY, Australia - The fate of Prime
Minister Gough Whitlam's Labor government
hung on a knife edge yesterday as Australians
awaited the official results of national elections
which may be as far as two weeks away.
Latest voting figures broadcast yesterday by
the government-owned television network
showed Labor winning at least a one-seat
majority in the House of Representatives: 64
seats to 57 seats for the opposition
Liberal-Country party coalition.
Six seats remained undecided.

But neither Whitlam nor opposition leader
Bill Sneeden claimed victory or conceded defeat
in the Saturday election.
The contest for the House is crucial because
the majority party or coalition forms the
government.

information we have developed here
will be given to the FBI in San

The identification of Hearst as one
of the alleged participants in the
Thursday night shooting came after
speculation that she might have died in
a hail of police bullets that tore
through the SLA hideout Friday
evening.
Five bodies were recovered from
the ruins of the house Friday night,
and it was not until late Saturday that
all were identified. The sixth body was
found yesterday — raising new
speculation that Hearst might have
died in the gunfight — but the
coroner's office later said the victim
was Camilla Hall, another member of
the small terrorist band.
