# Giscard Wins French Election
## 
### 
PARIS (AP) — The French Interior
Ministry declared conservative Valery
Giscard d'Estaing elected president of
France last night by a razor-edge
margin over Francois Mitterrand,
candidate of the Socialist and
Communist parties.
Earlier Mitterrand had conceded
defeat.
Giscard d'Estaing, at the age of 48,
thus becomes France's youngest
president of this century.
The declaration of Giscard
d'Estaing's victory by Interior Minister
Jacques Chirac came with the
conservative candidate leading by a
margin of 50.71 percent of the vote to
Mitterrand's 49.28 after more than 95
percent of the ballots had been
counted.
Giscard Platform
Giscard d'Estaing had campaigned
on a platform that included a
contention that Mitterrand's election
would bring a "Red menace" to
France because of his link with the
Communists in the election.
Most of the changes promised by
Giscard d'Estaing in the campaign are
internal matters. Foreign policy
pursued by the Gaullists under the late
Georges Pompidou was not an issue.
However, the new president, who
has a good working relationship with
several top American officials, has said
he looks forward to increased
cooperation with the United States
while maintaining "national
independence."
Problems
The new president's immediate
problems are soaring inflation and an
economy hit by the effects of higher
oil prices. These may be compounded
by labor unrest if trade union leaders
decide Giscard d'Estaing is slow in
tackling social reforms and welfare
programs.
He will be the republic's 20th
president.
In his concession, Mitterrand said,
"I wish the next president of France
will accomplish his mission while
preserving what is essential in our
national community."
With more than 95 percent of the
ballots counted, the votes given out by
the Interior Ministry were 13,164,886
for Giscard d'Estaing and 12,791,806
for Mitterrand.
