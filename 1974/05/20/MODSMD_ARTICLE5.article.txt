# Syrian-Israeli Pact Prepared

JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger began putting
together final details of a Syrian-Israeli
disengagement agreement yesterday
and announced he would continue
daily contacts in both Damascus and
Jerusalem until next Friday.
U.S. officials said the secretary
planned at least four more trips back
and forth to Damascus, finalizing the
plan to which both sides tentatively
agreed this weekend.
"I am more optimistic than I was
24 hours ago," said Foreign Minister
Abba Eban after the Israeli cabinet
reviewed Kissinger's plan for a
settlement.
However, he added, "We are talking
about significant progress, but not yet
talking about final agreement. There is
still work to be done."
Proposal Accepted
Israeli Information Minister Shimon
Peres said following a two-hour

negotiating session Saturday that the
Israelis "have already accepted the
American proposal, and so have the
Syrians."
But he said the Israeli government
expected that it would be "two or
three days" before an agreement is
"decided finally."
Outside the cabinet room
yesterday, police broke up a disorderly
demonstration and took about 35
Israeli protestors away in police vans.
Police later said they were not under
arrest.
The demonstrators, shouting "give
back the maps" and "break off the
talks," urged the government to reject
any plan that would endanger Jewish
settlements on the Golan Heights.
'New Phase Of War'
Meanwhile, four Israeli gunboats
protected by an umbrella of jet
warplanes bombarded a Palestinian
refugee camp near Lebanon's southern

border yesterday afternoon in what
the Israeli command said was a "new
phase of war" against Palestinian
guerrillas.
Initial reports from the Rashidiye
refugee camp said six civilian refugees
and two guerrillas were killed, four
civilians were wounded and a number
of houses were destroyed.
The camp is the second largest
refugee center in Lebanon, housing
about 12,000 Palestinians. It is located
on Lebanon's Mediterranean coast,
two miles south of Tyre and about
nine miles north of the Israeli border.
The attack followed two days of
Israeli air raids on Lebanon in
retaliation for the guerrilla raid on the
Maalot school in which 20 school
children and sue other Israelis died.
The Israeli air strikes killed more
than 50 Palestinians and Lebanese,
according to the Lebanese
government.
