# Chapel Dean Kelly Explores Religious Quest
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
"It's an odd phenomenon these days to be called
to be a preacher. It's a very hazardous occupation,
dangerous for the state of one's soul. I would never
do it if I didn't feel a genuine vocation."
God and man at Stanford is the province of Rev.
Robert G.H. Kelly, Dean of the Chapel.
Formerly a professor of New Testament studies
at Chicago's McCormick Theological Seminary, he
came to the University a year ago with his family to
devote himself to his vocation, being a preacher and
pastor.
Although he is falling behind now in his scholarly
pursuits, Kelly feels more free to explore the
"religious quest, the quest to make sense out of
things."
Commitment is part of the creative activity of
religion, Kelly says. "Religion dies under the
dissecting knife."
As Dean of the Chapel, Kelly conducts religious
services and prayer meetings, counsels students,
lends his support to social causes and administers
the human and financial resources of Memorial
Church.
'At Home With Students'
"I feel at home with students," Kelly says. At
34, he is the youngest dean in the church's history,
young enough to quote Simon and Garfunkel and
sport sideburns.
He says he wants to make the church a place
where students can feel a sense of community. "I
see a lot of people who are out of touch. It's
impossible for them to communicate with another
person or experience the world in any direct sort of
way."
He criticizes students who use religion or their
studies to make themselves immune to reality.
"There are certain religious people for whom

religion is a series of magic spells to produce an
inner peace or satisfaction with no real relationship
to the state of the world."
He sees the rejection of this world in favor of the
next world as vestiges of gnosticism, a doctrine
which his "Hellenistic Religions" class is focusing on
this quarter. For Kelly, religion and reality are
inseparable.
'Turn Toward World'
Many of his recent sermons have contained
attacks on gnostic tendencies. "Eternal life," he told

his congregation at Easter, "turns us toward this
world, not away from it."
He spoke of "religion as a return to the source of
life, religion as a deliberate and courageous
participation in the flow of life, with all its pain, as
well as all its joy. . . this religion does have
resources even for our critical times."
In turning toward the world, the Christian must
actively involve himself in social issues, Kelly
believes. He sees the church as a center for moral
concern.
'To have a spiritual life without a practical life is
hypocrisy. Spiritual experience should sensitize and
energize one to change things."
And yet, he does not believe that human society
can be perfected. When the real world proves
intractable, "One draws on spiritual resources to
keep the vision alive."
Reaction To Background
Central to his religious and political convictions
is Kelly's rejection of the values he grew up with. A
native South African, he attended an
ultra-traditional boarding school which instilled
"the ethics of Cecil Rhodes" in its students. Later
he came to detest the racism and repression in
South African society.
Activism has brought Kelly into conflict with the
University administration. When Nixon fired
Archibald Cox last October, Kelly felt impeachment
was a moral issue. He spoke at a noon rally in White
Plp.za and gave the church's phone number for use as
a clearinghouse for impeachment information.
After a conversation with administrators on the
University's tax-exempt status, Kelly withdrew the
number.
The church and the administration will always be
in a certain amount of tension, Kelly says. "By the

Reaction To Background
Central to his religious and political convictions
is Kelly's rejection of the values he grew up with. A
native South African, he attended an
ultra-traditional boarding school which instilled
"the ethics of Cecil Rhodes" in its students. Later
he came to detest the racism and repression in
South African society.
Activism has brought Kelly into conflict with the
University administration. When Nixon fired
Archibald Cox last October, Kelly felt impeachment
was a moral issue. He spoke at a noon rally in White
Plp.za and gave the church's phone number for use as
a clearinghouse for impeachment information.
After a conversation with administrators on the
University's tax-exempt status, Kelly withdrew the
number.
The church and the administration will always be
in a certain amount of tension, Kelly says. "By the

"It's an odd phenomenon these days to be called
to be a preacher. It's a very hazardous occupation,
dangerous for the state of one's soul. I would never
do it if I didn't feel a genuine vocation."
God and man at Stanford is the province of Rev.
Robert G.H. Kelly, Dean of the Chapel.
Formerly a professor of New Testament studies
at Chicago's McCormick Theological Seminary, he
came to the University a year ago with his family to
devote himself to his vocation, being a preacher and
pastor.
Although he is falling behind now in his scholarly
pursuits, Kelly feels more free to explore the
"religious quest, the quest to make sense out of
things."
Commitment is part of the creative activity of
religion, Kelly says. "Religion dies under the
dissecting knife."
As Dean of the Chapel, Kelly conducts religious
services and prayer meetings, counsels students,
lends his support to social causes and administers
the human and financial resources of Memorial
Church.
'At Home With Students'
"I feel at home with students," Kelly says. At
34, he is the youngest dean in the church's history,
young enough to quote Simon and Garfunkel and
sport sideburns.
He says he wants to make the church a place
where students can feel a sense of community. "I
see a lot of people who are out of touch. It's
impossible for them to communicate with another
person or experience the world in any direct sort of
way."
He criticizes students who use religion or their
studies to make themselves immune to reality.
"There are certain religious people for whom

religion is a series of magic spells to produce an
inner peace or satisfaction with no real relationship
to the state of the world."
He sees the rejection of this world in favor of the
next world as vestiges of gnosticism, a doctrine
which his "Hellenistic Religions" class is focusing on
this quarter. For Kelly, religion and reality are
inseparable.
'Turn Toward World'
Many of his recent sermons have contained
attacks on gnostic tendencies. "Eternal life," he told

his congregation at Easter, "turns us toward this
world, not away from it."
He spoke of "religion as a return to the source of
life, religion as a deliberate and courageous
participation in the flow of life, with all its pain, as
well as all its joy. . . this religion does have
resources even for our critical times."
In turning toward the world, the Christian must
actively involve himself in social issues, Kelly
believes. He sees the church as a center for moral
concern.
'To have a spiritual life without a practical life is
hypocrisy. Spiritual experience should sensitize and
energize one to change things."
And yet, he does not believe that human society
can be perfected. When the real world proves
intractable, "One draws on spiritual resources to
keep the vision alive."
