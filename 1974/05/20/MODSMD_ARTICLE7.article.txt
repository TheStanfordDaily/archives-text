# On Conservatism

Alphonse Juillond

Thank you for William Ross'
valiant struggle with the difficult
task of defining conservatism.
Since it would take too much of
your space to clear up things
point by point, I shall restrict
myself to a few general
considerations which have a
bearing on most issues raised in
"Traits of Conservatism 111
Defined" (Daily, May 14).
One reason why conservatism
appears puzzling to Ross is that he
fails to make certain fundamental
distinctions: between classic and
modern liberalism, between
European and American
conservatism; and between the
libertarian and traditionalist wings
of American conservatism.
Kilpatrick tried to characterize
American rather than European
conservatism. The distinction is
decisive inasmuch as classic
conservatives stressed tradition
and virtue, order and security, in
contrast to classic liberals who
stressed freedom and liberty.
American conservatism is a
more complex phenomenon,
whose roots are implanted not
only in the conservatism of the
nineteenth century, but in classic
liberalism as well. It therefore
embodies a sometimes precarious
tension between freedom and
order, between liberty and
security.
Two Conservative Wings
This dual heritage is reflected in
the two wings of the American
conservative movement, the
traditionalist and the libertarian.
With Russell Kirk, traditionalists
emphasize order and virtue; with
Frank Meyer, libertarians insist on
freedom.
The difference is mainly in
emphasis, as each wing
acknowledges the legitimacy of
the other and shares its concerns.
This explains why many American
conservatives share the classic
liberals' devotion to freedom, a

predilection quite uncongenial tc
their European ancestors.
The last distinction concerns
liberalism, classic and modern.
Whereas nineteenth century
liberals were committed to
freedom in all areas of private and
public life, contemporary liberals
have renounced their
predecessors' dedication to free
economic enterprise in favor of a
state controlled economy.
This is why modern liberals,
who agree with classic liberals and
libertarian conservatives in
questions of civil liberty and
individual freedom, oppose them
both on economic grounds.
Positions Shift
Relevant things considered, it is
hardly surprising to see
traditionalist conservatives and
modern liberals switch sides
depending on circumstance: a
champion of the free market, the
traditionalist conservative turns
into an advocate of government
controls in matters of manners
and morals; a champion of
individual freedom, the modern
liberal transmutes into a staunch
defender of economic controls.
Thus, the individual finds both
liberals and conservatives on his
side; but so does the state. Their
champions simply switch sides
depending on the nature of the
issues at stake.
If Ross would reconsider
Kilpatrick's decalogue with these
distinctions in mind, he may find
that some of the conservative
traits which disturb him are not so
ill defined after all; just as he may
find as many ambiguous traits in
the definition of liberalism. Which
is to be expected, considering that
"conservative" and "liberal" are
polar, mutually presupposing
terms: if one is ill defined, the
other is likely to be similarly
afflicted.

American conservatism is a
more complex phenomenon,
whose roots are implanted not
only in the conservatism of the
nineteenth century, but in classic
liberalism as well. It therefore
embodies a sometimes precarious
tension between freedom and
order, between liberty and
security.
Two Conservative Wings
This dual heritage is reflected in
the two wings of the American
conservative movement, the
traditionalist and the libertarian.
With Russell Kirk, traditionalists
emphasize order and virtue; with
Frank Meyer, libertarians insist on
freedom.
The difference is mainly in
emphasis, as each wing
acknowledges the legitimacy of
the other and shares its concerns.
This explains why many American
conservatives share the classic
liberals' devotion to freedom, a

predilection quite uncongenial tc
their European ancestors.
The last distinction concerns
liberalism, classic and modern.
Whereas nineteenth century
liberals were committed to
freedom in all areas of private and
public life, contemporary liberals
have renounced their
predecessors' dedication to free
economic enterprise in favor of a
state controlled economy.
This is why modern liberals,
who agree with classic liberals and
libertarian conservatives in
questions of civil liberty and
individual freedom, oppose them
both on economic grounds.
Positions Shift
Relevant things considered, it is
hardly surprising to see
traditionalist conservatives and
modern liberals switch sides
depending on circumstance: a
champion of the free market, the
traditionalist conservative turns
into an advocate of government
controls in matters of manners
and morals; a champion of
individual freedom, the modern
liberal transmutes into a staunch
defender of economic controls.
Thus, the individual finds both
liberals and conservatives on his
side; but so does the state. Their
champions simply switch sides
depending on the nature of the
issues at stake.
If Ross would reconsider
Kilpatrick's decalogue with these
distinctions in mind, he may find
that some of the conservative
traits which disturb him are not so
ill defined after all; just as he may
find as many ambiguous traits in
the definition of liberalism. Which
is to be expected, considering that
"conservative" and "liberal" are
polar, mutually presupposing
terms: if one is ill defined, the
other is likely to be similarly
afflicted.

Thank you for William Ross'
valiant struggle with the difficult
task of defining conservatism.
Since it would take too much of
your space to clear up things
point by point, I shall restrict
myself to a few general
considerations which have a
bearing on most issues raised in
"Traits of Conservatism 111
Defined" (Daily, May 14).
One reason why conservatism
appears puzzling to Ross is that he
fails to make certain fundamental
distinctions: between classic and
modern liberalism, between
European and American
conservatism; and between the
libertarian and traditionalist wings
of American conservatism.
Kilpatrick tried to characterize
American rather than European
conservatism. The distinction is
decisive inasmuch as classic
conservatives stressed tradition
and virtue, order and security, in
contrast to classic liberals who
stressed freedom and liberty.
