# Support USE
## 
### 
Jeri Lee

I must challenge Tim
Ferguson's article (Daily, May 13)
in which he emotes on the USE
strike.
While it is true that there is a
workers' alliance, this strike is not
about "the vain hopes of the 60s"
or SDS, but about real and
present economic need.
The workers need the support
of the students. The workers built
the University, so their goal is not
the "evisceration" of the
University. It is not the goal of
student supporters to "eviscerate"
the University either.
The workers would like to have
the altruistic support of the
students. But it is also in the
students' own interests to help the
workers because the workers
make the University run. Without
the workers, the University could
not provide what the students are
here for: education.
Subsistence Wages Unfair
Of course, the workers expect
the cost items of the contract to
come from"the reserves of rich,
powerful Stanford." Stanford is
supposed to be a non-profit
institution whose business is
education. It is not fair that the
University maintain its reserves at
the expense of the workers by
paying subsistence wages.
It is a part of the strike
mentality to get support from as
many people as we can. The
"social movements" (third world,
La Huelga) and students all have
an interest in how the University
as an employer treats its workers.
No one in the union has asked
that wage increases come from
tuition increases.
Using the politics of fear (of
increase in tuition) to divide the

students and workers is what the
management would like right
now. Even if there were
indications that there is a tuition
increase in the future, that is not a
valid reason why workers should
not earn a living wage.
Thus far, the workers have only
asked for a one-day boycott of
classes as a show of solidarity. The
workers are generally sympathetic
to the plight of students who may
be inconvenienced by the strike.
No one has asked for a "strike
against the mind."
Strikers' Hardship
USE does not want or need a
strike. The strikers are now under
the hardship of having no income
for the duration of the strike.
USE has spent a large amount of
time preparing for the strike
because it would be irresponsible
not to prepare for the case where
nothing happens in negotiations.
It is not fair to expect that the
workers suffer in silence because
nothing is happening
negotiations-wise. The union must
depend on the workers' solidarity
of power at negotiations because
it has been demonstrated that the
altruism and sense of fair play on
the part of the management
cannot be counted on in
negotiations.
An agency shop, for Ferguson's
information, means that workers
can elect to join the union. This
does not interfere with academic
freedom. This means that workers
are not "coerced" into joining the
union. USE hopes that the
workers will see that it is to their
benefit to join the union.

students. But it is also in the
students' own interests to help the
workers because the workers
make the University run. Without
the workers, the University could
not provide what the students are
here for: education.
Subsistence Wages Unfair
Of course, the workers expect
the cost items of the contract to
come from"the reserves of rich,
powerful Stanford." Stanford is
supposed to be a non-profit
institution whose business is
education. It is not fair that the
University maintain its reserves at
the expense of the workers by
paying subsistence wages.
It is a part of the strike
mentality to get support from as
many people as we can. The
"social movements" (third world,
La Huelga) and students all have
an interest in how the University
as an employer treats its workers.
No one in the union has asked
that wage increases come from
tuition increases.
Using the politics of fear (of
increase in tuition) to divide the

students and workers is what the
management would like right
now. Even if there were
indications that there is a tuition
increase in the future, that is not a
valid reason why workers should
not earn a living wage.
Thus far, the workers have only
asked for a one-day boycott of
classes as a show of solidarity. The
workers are generally sympathetic
to the plight of students who may
be inconvenienced by the strike.
No one has asked for a "strike
against the mind."
Strikers' Hardship
USE does not want or need a
strike. The strikers are now under
the hardship of having no income
for the duration of the strike.
USE has spent a large amount of
time preparing for the strike
because it would be irresponsible
not to prepare for the case where
nothing happens in negotiations.
It is not fair to expect that the
workers suffer in silence because
nothing is happening
negotiations-wise. The union must
depend on the workers' solidarity
of power at negotiations because
it has been demonstrated that the
altruism and sense of fair play on
the part of the management
cannot be counted on in
negotiations.
An agency shop, for Ferguson's
information, means that workers
can elect to join the union. This
does not interfere with academic
freedom. This means that workers
are not "coerced" into joining the
union. USE hopes that the
workers will see that it is to their
benefit to join the union.

I must challenge Tim
Ferguson's article (Daily, May 13)
in which he emotes on the USE
strike.
While it is true that there is a
workers' alliance, this strike is not
about "the vain hopes of the 60s"
or SDS, but about real and
present economic need.
The workers need the support
of the students. The workers built
the University, so their goal is not
the "evisceration" of the
University. It is not the goal of
student supporters to "eviscerate"
the University either.
The workers would like to have
the altruistic support of the
students. But it is also in the
