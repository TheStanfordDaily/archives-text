# Lack Of Funds To Close Down Nursing School
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
Lack of funds will cause the nursing
school to close this summer, according
to Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the
Medical School.
At this time, the prospects of the
nursing school reopening are
uncertain and dependent upon funds
materializing in the future, Rich
added.
In accordance with the
recommendation of a Medical School
task force appointed in 1971, the
current nursing baccalaureate program
was to be phased out and replaced
with a two-year master's program. The
task force felt that the graduate
program, by turning out more highly
trained nurses such as practitioners
and clinical specialists, would have a
greater impact on public health
services.
However, because tuition income is
"in practice not enough to carry out
the program," Rich said, "we felt the
need to get outside funding, either
federal or private, to enrich the
program." The funds failed to
materialize and the nursing school will
be closed for an indefinite period,
much to the distress of alumnae,
faculty and students.
Club 'Saddened'
"We are extremely saddened to see
[the nursing program] ending," said
Marlene Handy, president of the
Stanford Nurses Club. "We feel very
strongly that a good medical center
should have a school of nursing," she
added.
Graduating senior Linda Cornell
agreed, noting that most of the large
medical centers she knew of, such as
Yale, the University of San Francisco
and the University of Washington, have
both baccalaureate and master's
programs in nursing. "And now
Stanford has none," she observed.
"It's really sad." Handy said her
sadness is increased by a feeling that
the school "wasn't closed due to a lack

of interest."
In fact, she said, the nursing
program had been "cut off in its
prime" and that it actually had been
getting "more and more popular with
Stanford students."
Cornell and Paula Tognetti, another
graduating senior, agreed with Handy,
saying they knew of students, both at
Stanford and other schools, who had
been planning to attend the Stanford
nursing school.
Repercussions
Closing the school has ever, further
repercussions because the demand for
nursing schools is growing, according
to Tognetti, Cornell and Handy.
"There's no problem with finding a
job [in nursing]," said Handy. "The
hard thing right now is to find a
nursing school."
Said Tognetti, "It's getting as hard
to get into nursing school as it is med
school."
Tognetti, who was on the task
force, also felt that by closing the
nursing school, the Medical School was
"not just shutting a school" but
"affecting the public health program"
as well.
Nursing students play a big role in
public health services in the Stanford
area, with each student volunteering
about 30 hours a week to various
health organizations, Tognetti pointed
out.
"I am very anxious to see the
nursing school open up again .... On
the other hand, I want to see the

program have enough resources so we
can have a strong program," Rich said.
It would cost at least $100,000 a
year to "develop and sustain a
program of reasonable size," according
to Medical School Director of
Development Dudley Kenworthy. But
many sources of financial support
aren't willing to support nursing
programs, said Kenworthy.
Support from the biggest source of
aid, the federal government, has been
decreasing in recent years, he noted.
Moreover, private sources are no
longer interested in supporting basic
level nursing education because it's not
a "unique and special field."
However, the Medical School soon
is planning to approach another
foundation, one that has shown an
interest in nursing education.
Meanwhile, the Stanford Nurses
Club will be pushing strongly for the
reopening of the nursing school. The
Club can't do any fund raising of its
own because it's "too big a project,"
said Handy.
However, Handy said that two of
the members and herself would be
visiting Rich periodically to see
"what's going on" and to remind him
of their concern.

programs in nursing. "And now

of interest."
In fact, she said, the nursing
program had been "cut off in its
prime" and that it actually had been
getting "more and more popular with
Stanford students."
Cornell and Paula Tognetti, another
graduating senior, agreed with Handy,
saying they knew of students, both at
Stanford and other schools, who had
been planning to attend the Stanford
nursing school.
Repercussions
Closing the school has ever, further
repercussions because the demand for
nursing schools is growing, according
to Tognetti, Cornell and Handy.
"There's no problem with finding a
job [in nursing]," said Handy. "The
hard thing right now is to find a
nursing school."
Said Tognetti, "It's getting as hard
to get into nursing school as it is med
school."
Tognetti, who was on the task
force, also felt that by closing the
nursing school, the Medical School was
"not just shutting a school" but
"affecting the public health program"
as well.
Nursing students play a big role in
public health services in the Stanford
area, with each student volunteering
about 30 hours a week to various
health organizations, Tognetti pointed
out.
"I am very anxious to see the
nursing school open up again .... On
the other hand, I want to see the

program have enough resources so we
can have a strong program," Rich said.
It would cost at least $100,000 a
year to "develop and sustain a
program of reasonable size," according
to Medical School Director of
Development Dudley Kenworthy. But
many sources of financial support
aren't willing to support nursing
programs, said Kenworthy.
Support from the biggest source of
aid, the federal government, has been
decreasing in recent years, he noted.
Moreover, private sources are no
longer interested in supporting basic
level nursing education because it's not
a "unique and special field."
However, the Medical School soon
is planning to approach another
foundation, one that has shown an
interest in nursing education.
Meanwhile, the Stanford Nurses
Club will be pushing strongly for the
reopening of the nursing school. The
Club can't do any fund raising of its
own because it's "too big a project,"
said Handy.
However, Handy said that two of
the members and herself would be
visiting Rich periodically to see
"what's going on" and to remind him
of their concern.
Lack of funds will cause the nursing
school to close this summer, according
to Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the
Medical School.
At this time, the prospects of the
nursing school reopening are
uncertain and dependent upon funds
materializing in the future, Rich
added.
In accordance with the
recommendation of a Medical School
task force appointed in 1971, the
current nursing baccalaureate program
was to be phased out and replaced
with a two-year master's program. The
task force felt that the graduate
program, by turning out more highly
trained nurses such as practitioners
and clinical specialists, would have a
greater impact on public health
services.
However, because tuition income is
"in practice not enough to carry out
the program," Rich said, "we felt the
need to get outside funding, either
federal or private, to enrich the
program." The funds failed to
materialize and the nursing school will
be closed for an indefinite period,
much to the distress of alumnae,
faculty and students.

"We are extremely saddened to see
[the nursing program] ending," said
Marlene Handy, president of the
Stanford Nurses Club. "We feel very
