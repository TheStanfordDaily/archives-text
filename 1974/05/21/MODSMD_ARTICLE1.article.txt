# Lack Of Funds To Close Down Nursing School

### ANN AMIOKA 
Lack of funds will cause the nursing
school to close this summer, according
to Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the
Medical School.
At this time, the prospects of the
nursing school reopening are
uncertain and dependent upon funds
materializing in the future, Rich
added.
In accordance with the
recommendation of a Medical School
task force appointed in 1971, the
current nursing baccalaureate program
was to be phased out and replaced
with a two-year master's program. The
task force felt that the graduate
program, by turning out more highly
trained nurses such as practitioners
and clinical specialists, would have a
greater impact on public health
services.
However, because tuition income is
"in practice not enough to carry out
the program," Rich said, "we felt the
need to get outside funding, either
federal or private, to enrich the
program." The funds failed to
materialize and the nursing school will
be closed for an indefinite period,
much to the distress of alumnae,
faculty and students.
Club 'Saddened'
"We are extremely saddened to see
[the nursing program] ending," said
Marlene Handy, president of the
Stanford Nurses Club. "We feel very
strongly that a good medical center
should have a school of nursing," she
added.
Graduating senior Linda Cornell
agreed, noting that most of the large
medical centers she knew of, such as
Yale, the University of San Francisco
and the University of Washington, have
both baccalaureate and master's
programs in nursing. "And now
Stanford has none," she observed.
"It's really sad." Handy said her
sadness is increased by a feeling that
the school "wasn't closed due to a lack
