# A 						Case Against Nixon's Resignation
## 
### 
William Ross

President Nixon seems determined to
remain in office despite the growing surge of
almost palpable hostility toward him by
perhaps a majority of his countrymen.
Nevertheless one must not place excessive
faith in his frequent declarations that he
won't resign. These almost frenzied denials
that he will not resign could be the best
indications that he plans to resign. He seems
to be a man who protests too much.
It is useful to recall that only eight months
ago, Spiro Agnew was also adamant in his
refusal to resign. As his predicament grew
worse, his insistance that he would remain in
office became increasingly intense.
But if Nixon truly plans not to resign, this
is an encouraging decision. It is my
contention that Nixon's resignation could be
harmful to the nation. But impeachment —
and even conviction — might be salubrious
for American politics.
If Nixon resigned, he would do so for one
of two possible reasons.
Public Pressure
First, he might resign because of the
pressure of public opinion. Although it is
generally a tenet of American political theory
that the president should command popular
support if he is to serve as the legitimate head
of state, in practice another theory has
always prevailed.
That theory states that tha president has a
right to serve out the term to which he has
been elected unless he is removed by
constitutional means — conviction of crimes
by the Senate.
No president has ever resigned, and the

theory that he should not arbitrarily leave
office is reinforced by his inability to dissolve
Congress and/or to call a special presidential
election.
Although it is possible to criticize the fact
that tradition has discouraged the resignation
of a president who has obviously lost the
support of the people, precedent reinforces
the theory that public opinion should not
force a president from office.
Wilson Refusal
Hence, after the Republican landslide of
1920, Woodrow Wilson refused to appoint
Warren Harding secretary of state and then
resign with his vice president, Thomas
Marshall, thus making Harding president.
In 1932, Herbert Hoover fought off the
suggestion that he use similar means to make
Franklin Roosevelt president five months
early after the latter was elected to the
office.
In 1946, when the Democrats lost control
of the House of Representatives, Harry
Truman was urged to resign, but refused.
Although only one-fourth of the American
people say that they support Nixon's
performance in office, this is no lower than
the 23 percent in 1951 who said that they
supported Truman.
Unprecedented Situation
Some people argue that the likelihood of
criminal behavior by the president makes the
current situation unprecedented in American
history, thus Nixon should resign because
public opinion is not motivated by partisan
considerations.
But if Nixon is truly guilty of crimes, the

House has the duty to impeach him and the
Senate should be given the opportunity to
conduct a trial.
The second reason why the president
might resign is that he would see
impeachment and conviction as inevitable
and would want to save himself from the
disgrace. He would claim no doubt that he
was innocent and wanted to save the country
the agony of a trial, playing the role of a
martyr.
But if he left office voluntarily, the House
and Senate would not have a chance to pass
judgment on him.
Consequences of Guilt
If he is guilty of "high crimes and
misdemeanors" he ought to be subjected to
the full humiliation that conviction would
entail.
But more important, either conviction or
acquittal would allow the entire issue of the
Watergate scandals to be aired in the ultimate
forum — the trial of a president in the
Senate.
While it is true that these hearings would
subject the nation to a great psychological
ordeal, they would be of considerable benefit
to the nation in the long run.
They would prove that the American
constitutional process is strong enough to
determine the guilt or innocence of its
president in an orderly fashion without
allowing the personal fears of the president
or public opinion to force him from office.
