# On Recent ASSU Accomplishments

For many students the
principal function of the ASSU is
the services it provides for the
Stanford community. Most of
these are carried out by ASSU
projects each under the control of
a student manager, who in turn
reports to the ASSU financial
manager.
Success for a project is not
measured in terms of the number
of dollars made but in terms of the
number of students served and the
dollars they saved. What follows is
a report to the student body on
the operations and
accomplishments of three of the
ASSU projects for this past year.
ASSU Sunday Flicks
The ASSU Sunday Flicks, in
existence since 1937, provides low
cost film entertainment of wide
appeal to the Stanford
community. The Flicks, managed
by Bob Sisson, have maintained
their price at 50 cents, the lowest
of all film series on campus.
Several innovations have been
tried this year. These include a
new summer series, giving a
discount to season ticket holders,
and improved methods of crowd
control.
The summer series was
attended by over 20,000 and will
become a permanent part of the
Flicks program. Attendance also
increased substantially and should
total over 115,000 for the year,
up 55 percent.
The Flicks average net income
for 1973-1974 was less than $100
per show. These funds will be
used to maintain admission of 50
cents despite rising prices for
films, security, advertising, and
labor. Some funds are also being
used for improvements to Mem
Aud. No revenues from the Flicks
are being spent on other projects.
ASSU Travel Service
Due to rising prices, strikes, and
reduced schedules, the demand
for charter flights by the Stanford
community has increased

dramatically. Capacities were
increased on most existing routes
and new flights were added. Total
seats sold have risen over 85
percent from last year, as shown
in the chart below:
This Yr. Last Yr.
Christmas
New York 607 476
Boston 149 —
Wash. D.C. 149 149
Chicago 355 206
Spring
New York 223 165
Hawaii 388 274

Chicago (one way) 149 —
Fall (return to Campus)
New York 298 (est.) —
Chicago 149 (est.) —
TOTAL 2910 1560
Because of an overcharge by
the airlines, the Travel Service is
presently refunding $19.25 to
every customer of our Christmas
charters. This rebate will mean
that the New York flights cost
$139.75, the lowest price in over
five years and a tremendous
savings considering the regularly
scheduled youth fare was
$310.00.
Terry Hess, Manager of the
Travel Service, estimates that
through the summer flights the
Travel Service will have saved its
customers over $350,000.
Although charter flights are the
principal function of the Travel
Service, they have been trying to
add other services. These include a
European Car Plan, international
student ID's, a travel booklet, and
a possible trip to Tahoe in June.
Revenues from operations are
being retained to build up a small
reserve. This will enable the Travel
Service to take certain risks in
instituting new flights and
services. The Travel Service is
non-profit and any excess income
will be used to maintain fares at a
low level.
This past year was
characterized by the improved
financial condition of the Special

Events Program. It will finish in
the black this year, a major
accomplishment considering the
loss of close to $30,000 last year.
Co-directors Danny Scher and
Doug Baldwin presented a varied
program of folk, rock, jazz,
comedy, drama, and dance. Of the
major concerts, three were
particularly successful — Joan
Baez, Jesse Colin Young, and
Gordon Lightfoot.
Unfortunately, the Sacred
Concert marking Duke Ellington's
seventy-fifth birthday had to be
canceled. Much effort had been
put into arranging an entire
weekend around the event and
had it been held as scheduled, it
would have been the major
success of the program, receiving
national news coverage.
Substantial efforts have been
made to control costs. Lower

rental of facilities, and different
methods of advertising and
ticketing have reduced overhead
by as much as $2000 per concert.
Valuable experience has been
gained in dealing with agents and
this coupled with a change in the
program's organizational structure
and the reduction of costs should
lead to more and better concerts
next year.
I would like to take the
opportunity to thank project
directors — Bob Sisson, Terry
Hess, Danny Scher, and Doug
Baldwin — for the outstanding job
they have done throughout the
year. The improvements in
operations were obtianed only by
their skill and hard work and I
think they deserve the thanks of
the student body.

projects each under the control of
a student manager, who in turn
reports to the ASSU financial
manager.
Success for a project is not
measured in terms of the number
of dollars made but in terms of the
number of students served and the
dollars they saved. What follows is
a report to the student body on
the operations and
accomplishments of three of the
ASSU projects for this past year.
ASSU Sunday Flicks
The ASSU Sunday Flicks, in
existence since 1937, provides low
cost film entertainment of wide
appeal to the Stanford
community. The Flicks, managed
by Bob Sisson, have maintained
their price at 50 cents, the lowest
of all film series on campus.
Several innovations have been
tried this year. These include a
new summer series, giving a
discount to season ticket holders,
and improved methods of crowd
control.
The summer series was
attended by over 20,000 and will
become a permanent part of the
Flicks program. Attendance also
increased substantially and should
total over 115,000 for the year,
up 55 percent.
The Flicks average net income
for 1973-1974 was less than $100
per show. These funds will be
used to maintain admission of 50
cents despite rising prices for
films, security, advertising, and
labor. Some funds are also being
used for improvements to Mem
Aud. No revenues from the Flicks
are being spent on other projects.
ASSU Travel Service
Due to rising prices, strikes, and
reduced schedules, the demand
for charter flights by the Stanford
community has increased

dramatically. Capacities were
increased on most existing routes
and new flights were added. Total
seats sold have risen over 85
percent from last year, as shown
in the chart below:
This Yr. Last Yr.
Christmas
New York 607 476
Boston 149 —
Wash. D.C. 149 149
Chicago 355 206

Chicago (one way) 149 —
Fall (return to Campus)
New York 298 (est.) —
Chicago 149 (est.) —
TOTAL 2910 1560
Because of an overcharge by
the airlines, the Travel Service is
presently refunding $19.25 to
every customer of our Christmas
charters. This rebate will mean
that the New York flights cost
$139.75, the lowest price in over
five years and a tremendous
savings considering the regularly
scheduled youth fare was
$310.00.
Terry Hess, Manager of the
Travel Service, estimates that
through the summer flights the
Travel Service will have saved its
customers over $350,000.
Although charter flights are the
principal function of the Travel
Service, they have been trying to
add other services. These include a
European Car Plan, international
student ID's, a travel booklet, and
a possible trip to Tahoe in June.
Revenues from operations are
being retained to build up a small
reserve. This will enable the Travel
Service to take certain risks in
instituting new flights and
services. The Travel Service is
non-profit and any excess income
will be used to maintain fares at a
low level.
This past year was
characterized by the improved
financial condition of the Special

Events Program. It will finish in
the black this year, a major
accomplishment considering the
loss of close to $30,000 last year.
Co-directors Danny Scher and
Doug Baldwin presented a varied
program of folk, rock, jazz,
comedy, drama, and dance. Of the
major concerts, three were
particularly successful — Joan
Baez, Jesse Colin Young, and
Gordon Lightfoot.
Unfortunately, the Sacred
Concert marking Duke Ellington's
seventy-fifth birthday had to be
canceled. Much effort had been
put into arranging an entire
weekend around the event and
had it been held as scheduled, it
would have been the major
success of the program, receiving
national news coverage.
Substantial efforts have been
made to control costs. Lower

rental of facilities, and different
methods of advertising and
ticketing have reduced overhead
by as much as $2000 per concert.
Valuable experience has been
gained in dealing with agents and
this coupled with a change in the
program's organizational structure
and the reduction of costs should
lead to more and better concerts
next year.
I would like to take the
opportunity to thank project
directors — Bob Sisson, Terry
Hess, Danny Scher, and Doug
Baldwin — for the outstanding job
they have done throughout the
year. The improvements in
operations were obtianed only by
their skill and hard work and I
think they deserve the thanks of
the student body.

of dollars made but in terms of the
number of students served and the
dollars they saved. What follows is
a report to the student body on
the operations and
accomplishments of three of the
ASSU projects for this past year.
ASSU Sunday Flicks
The ASSU Sunday Flicks, in
existence since 1937, provides low
cost film entertainment of wide
appeal to the Stanford
community. The Flicks, managed
by Bob Sisson, have maintained
their price at 50 cents, the lowest
of all film series on campus.
Several innovations have been
tried this year. These include a
new summer series, giving a
discount to season ticket holders,
and improved methods of crowd
control.
The summer series was
attended by over 20,000 and will
become a permanent part of the
Flicks program. Attendance also
increased substantially and should
total over 115,000 for the year,
up 55 percent.
The Flicks average net income
for 1973-1974 was less than $100
per show. These funds will be
used to maintain admission of 50
cents despite rising prices for
films, security, advertising, and
labor. Some funds are also being
used for improvements to Mem
Aud. No revenues from the Flicks
are being spent on other projects.
ASSU Travel Service
Due to rising prices, strikes, and
reduced schedules, the demand
for charter flights by the Stanford
community has increased

dramatically. Capacities were
increased on most existing routes
and new flights were added. Total
seats sold have risen over 85
percent from last year, as shown
in the chart below:
This Yr. Last Yr.
Christmas
New York 607 476
Boston 149 —
Wash. D.C. 149 149
Chicago 355 206
Spring
New York 223 165
Hawaii 388 274
Summer
Europe 220 230
New York (one way) 223 96
Chicago (one way) 149 —
Fall (return to Campus)
New York 298 (est.) —
Chicago 149 (est.) —
TOTAL 2910 1560
Because of an overcharge by
the airlines, the Travel Service is
presently refunding $19.25 to
every customer of our Christmas
charters. This rebate will mean
that the New York flights cost
$139.75, the lowest price in over
five years and a tremendous
savings considering the regularly
scheduled youth fare was
$310.00.
Terry Hess, Manager of the
Travel Service, estimates that
through the summer flights the
Travel Service will have saved its
customers over $350,000.
Although charter flights are the
principal function of the Travel
Service, they have been trying to
add other services. These include a
European Car Plan, international
student ID's, a travel booklet, and
a possible trip to Tahoe in June.
Revenues from operations are
being retained to build up a small
reserve. This will enable the Travel
Service to take certain risks in
instituting new flights and
services. The Travel Service is
non-profit and any excess income
will be used to maintain fares at a
low level.
This past year was
characterized by the improved
financial condition of the Special

Events Program. It will finish in
the black this year, a major
accomplishment considering the
loss of close to $30,000 last year.
Co-directors Danny Scher and
Doug Baldwin presented a varied
program of folk, rock, jazz,
comedy, drama, and dance. Of the
major concerts, three were
particularly successful — Joan
Baez, Jesse Colin Young, and
Gordon Lightfoot.
Unfortunately, the Sacred
Concert marking Duke Ellington's
seventy-fifth birthday had to be
canceled. Much effort had been
put into arranging an entire
weekend around the event and
had it been held as scheduled, it
would have been the major
success of the program, receiving
national news coverage.
Substantial efforts have been
made to control costs. Lower

rental of facilities, and different
methods of advertising and
ticketing have reduced overhead
by as much as $2000 per concert.
Valuable experience has been
gained in dealing with agents and
this coupled with a change in the
program's organizational structure
and the reduction of costs should
lead to more and better concerts
next year.
I would like to take the
opportunity to thank project
directors — Bob Sisson, Terry
Hess, Danny Scher, and Doug
Baldwin — for the outstanding job
they have done throughout the
year. The improvements in
operations were obtianed only by
their skill and hard work and I
think they deserve the thanks of
the student body.

For many students the
principal function of the ASSU is
the services it provides for the
Stanford community. Most of
these are carried out by ASSU
projects each under the control of
a student manager, who in turn
reports to the ASSU financial
manager.
