# Learn About Vietnam

Meat and potatoes, bombs and
casualty count were standard
American dinner fare less than
two years ago. The Vietnam war
was channelled into our living
rooms through the box in the
corner, and a news analyst would
explain all the developments and
report the statements of officials
in Washington, Saigon, and
Moscow.
But the people of that tiny
country which dominated our
attention didn't have the benefit
of world-wide media to help them
comprehend the events they were
experiencing. They only knew the
war when it dropped on them
from out of a blue sky or rolled
through their village one day or
ripped them away from their
sacred land and deposited them
in the alien world of a i refugee
camp.
The war confronted the
Vietnamese people with personal
events rather than historical
developments or political
concepts; and the events were
bewildering.
Nor did we, who saw more
battles during the war and heard
more official explanations than
did any Vietnamese, ever fully
grasp the meaning of those events.
Frances Fitzgerald, author of Fire
in the Lake, has written that the
tragedy of American involvement
in Vietnam was exacerbated by
the failure of Americans to grasp
the nature of Vietnamese
problems in Vietnamese rather
than American terms.
Alien Cultures
"By intervening in the
Vietnamese struggle," she writes,
the United States was attempting
to fit its global strategies into a
world of hillocks and hamlets....
The United States was not only
transposing itself into a different
epoch of history; it was entering a
world qualitatively different from
its own."
The problem of translation
between the two cultures was so
great, Fitzgerald writes, that it
was very difficult for Americans
in Vietnam "to make this leap in
perspective. .., to understand
that while they themselves saw
themselves as building world
order, many Vietnamese saw them
merely as the producers of
garbage from which they could
build houses."
The misconceptions which
drew the United States into the
Vietnamese conflict in' the first
place have not yet loosened their
hold on the minds of the men
who determine American policy.
The Nixon Administration this
year wants to once again increase
the financial and material
involvement of the United States
in Vietnam and Cambodia.
This situation has inspired a
group of students to organize "A
Week of Concern for Indochina"
for the week of May 22-29, to
provide the Stanford Community
with an opportunity to learn
about the peoples and cultures of
Indochina, and to understand the
nature of continued American
involvement there.
Indochinese Exhibit
The central feature of the
week's activities will be the
Indochina Mobile Education
Program, an exhibit depicting the
history and culture of the
Indochinese people, and the effect
that the war has had upon them.
The exhibit will be in the lobby
on the second floor of Tresidder
Memorial Union, Wednesday, May
22, through Friday, May 24.
Accompanying the Program
and giving several public talks will
be David Bailey and Caroline
Eliot, both of whom worked at
the Quang Ngai Medical
Rehabilitation Center and came to
know the Vietnamese closely.
Everyone is encouraged to
participate in the activities
scheduled for the Week of
Concern For Indochina. A
statement by David Bailey
described the objective of the
program:
"We would like the people of
the United States to know the
Vietnamese as we did — as people
with hopes and desires, strengths
and weaknesses, as people who
can feel joy and sorrow. Then the
American people might stop
supporting groups in this country
and in South Vietnam to keep the
conflict going today, even after
the Paris agreements."

world of hillocks and hamlets....
The United States was not only
transposing itself into a different
epoch of history; it was entering a
world qualitatively different from
its own."
The problem of translation
between the two cultures was so
great, Fitzgerald writes, that it
was very difficult for Americans
in Vietnam "to make this leap in
perspective. .., to understand
that while they themselves saw
themselves as building world
order, many Vietnamese saw them
merely as the producers of
garbage from which they could
build houses."
The misconceptions which
drew the United States into the
Vietnamese conflict in' the first
place have not yet loosened their
hold on the minds of the men
who determine American policy.
The Nixon Administration this
year wants to once again increase
the financial and material
involvement of the United States
in Vietnam and Cambodia.
This situation has inspired a
group of students to organize "A
Week of Concern for Indochina"
for the week of May 22-29, to
provide the Stanford Community
with an opportunity to learn
about the peoples and cultures of
Indochina, and to understand the
nature of continued American
involvement there.
Indochinese Exhibit
The central feature of the
week's activities will be the
Indochina Mobile Education
Program, an exhibit depicting the
history and culture of the
Indochinese people, and the effect
that the war has had upon them.
The exhibit will be in the lobby
on the second floor of Tresidder
Memorial Union, Wednesday, May
22, through Friday, May 24.
Accompanying the Program
and giving several public talks will
be David Bailey and Caroline
Eliot, both of whom worked at
the Quang Ngai Medical
Rehabilitation Center and came to
know the Vietnamese closely.
Everyone is encouraged to
participate in the activities
scheduled for the Week of
Concern For Indochina. A
statement by David Bailey
described the objective of the
program:
"We would like the people of
the United States to know the
Vietnamese as we did — as people
with hopes and desires, strengths
and weaknesses, as people who
can feel joy and sorrow. Then the
American people might stop
supporting groups in this country
and in South Vietnam to keep the
conflict going today, even after
the Paris agreements."

Meat and potatoes, bombs and
casualty count were standard
American dinner fare less than
two years ago. The Vietnam war
was channelled into our living
rooms through the box in the
corner, and a news analyst would
explain all the developments and
report the statements of officials
in Washington, Saigon, and
Moscow.
But the people of that tiny
country which dominated our
attention didn't have the benefit
of world-wide media to help them
comprehend the events they were
experiencing. They only knew the
war when it dropped on them
from out of a blue sky or rolled
through their village one day or
ripped them away from their
sacred land and deposited them
in the alien world of a i refugee
camp.
The war confronted the
Vietnamese people with personal
events rather than historical
developments or political
concepts; and the events were
bewildering.
Nor did we, who saw more
battles during the war and heard
more official explanations than
did any Vietnamese, ever fully
grasp the meaning of those events.
Frances Fitzgerald, author of Fire
in the Lake, has written that the
tragedy of American involvement
in Vietnam was exacerbated by
the failure of Americans to grasp
the nature of Vietnamese
problems in Vietnamese rather
than American terms.
