# Leah Kaplan: Dean For Women
## 
### SANDY WHITE 
The title "dean of women"
may evoke memories of a large,
gray-haired woman with
black-rimmed glasses enforcing
high school dress codes with a
yardstick, a woman who bellowed
as she lectured girls on morality
and good manners. But Leah
Kaplan sees herself "not as a dean
of women, but a dean for women.
As the newly-appointed
assistant to the dean of student
affairs for women students,
Kaplan is the leading advocate for
women students in the University.
The wife of Radiology Prof.
Henry Kaplan and the mother of
two, she's a tall, dark-haired,
sophisticated woman who keeps
chocolate marshmallow cookies in
her desk drawer for her afternoon
coffee break.
Kaplan has been a clinical
counselor since 1946. When she
joined Cowell Student Health
Center's psychiatric services 10
years ago, she was the only
woman on the staff. Now there
are six.
Counsels Students
In those 10 years she has
counseled students with personal
and sexual problems, helped set
up peer counseling groups for
contraception and supervised
University of California graduate
students who gain clinical
experience here.
In her counseling she soon
found that women felt more
comfortable with her than they
did with male psychiatrists. By
counseling pregnant women, for
example, she began to empathize
with the special problems of
women students. She herself
married while a student at Yale,
and experienced first hand the
trials of being a working mother.
When the Committee on
Education and Employment of
Women in the University
(CEEWU) recommended the
appointment of a "consultant" to
the University for the concerns of
women students, Kaplan's
familiarity with Stanford and
specifically its women students,
made her a likely candidate. She
accepted the post last February.
Women Represented
Before Kaplan's appointment,
other minority groups had official
representatives in the University,
but women did not, the CEEWU
report noted. The job is a big one,
Kaplan says, but she adds that her
main concern is simply "to satisfy
my constituency."
A matchmaker at heart, she
would rather be an
"ombudsperson" than an
authoritarian. "I'm trying to link
people and institutional needs
together," she explains.
She organized a sherry
reception at President and Mrs.
Lyman's home recently, which
brought together many women
faculty, administrators and
students. Kaplan feels it is
important for women students to
meet successful women who can
serve as role models.
Professional Women Visit
Many different types of
women visit the "dean for
women." Several professionally
trained women come to her
looking for career guidance, and
Kaplan suspects that many
talented women do not know the

techniques for success in the
business world.
She encourages the University
to establish courses in
assertiveness training, career
choices and decision-rribking,
specifically oriented toward
women.
"Socialization shouldn't make
women students feel inhibited
about pursuing a career. But I
don't want all women to become
women's libbers. They shouldn't
be made to feel like second-class
citizens if they want to marry and
settle down. I just want to protect
the options," she said.
Job Lasts Two Years
Kaplan's job in the office of
the Dean of Student Affairs will
last only two years, with an
evaluation at the end of the first
year.
She says she hopes to be a
catalyst, sparking ideas and
cooperation between people, so
that when she returns to Cowell
full-time, the machinery of the
University will keep things going.
Her main goals now are
increasing child care on campus,
finding more women advisers,
aiding the recruitment of women
in such male-dominated fields as
engineering, increasing sensitivity
to the needs of single parents who
are students and arousing greater
concern for lonely students of
both sexes, she says.
Although she has no legal
jurisdiction over faculty selection,
Kaplan enjoys "going around
making people feel guilty for not
appointing women faculty.
"I don't think that channels
are so rigidified at Stanford that
one can ask questions and raise
problems and not see change as a
result," she says.
