# Swami Lauds Spiritual Technology
## 
### TIM FERGUSON JACK HOMER 
Swami Muktananda enthralled a
Dinkelspiel Auditorium crowd of 400
Sunday night by claiming that all the
world's energy emanates from the soul.
'The soul's own energy," the Swami
said, is what Hindus call shakti. 'The
Universe is nothing but shakti — wave and
wave of shakti," he said.
Muktananda hammered repeatedly at
modern science's obsession with material
technology. Through spiritual technology,
such as meditation, "we can perceive
reality just as it is," he said.
He called for "internal research, as well
as external research" so that society might
realize that all persons have the same
components in their souls. "What is outside
is inside, and what is inside is outside," the
Swami said.
Endorses Yoga
Muktananda gave a strong endorsement
of yoga, which he called "the science of
this energy inside [shakti]. [Conventional]
science is research into the shakti pervading
outside."
Though many do not practice yoga, the
Swami said, "our daily life is full of yoga."
He told the audience that merely sitting in
a seat constituted a form of yoga.
Muktananda said yoga in its advanced
stages "leads to higher consciousness" and
results in clear vision of objects from a
great distance. Through yoga, he said,
"one can travel from one world to another,
not in an aircraft but in another plane."
On another interplanetary matter,
Muktananda said that by reaching the

transcendental state of consciousness "one
can reach the perfection of the beings on
the planet Jupiter. Great masters reside on
Jupiter. Scientists going there would be
able to tell you about them."
Frank Voice
The Swami spoke in a frank, matter of
fact tone of voice; his words were
translated by a slight, elderly interpreter
referred to as "Professor Jayne."
Muktananda sat atop a burgundy
velvet throne, attired in a flaming red
pajama-like outfit which prompted one
student to comment, "He looked like an
ember glowing purity."
The Swami appeared 35 minutes late for
the festivities. Followers prefaced his
arrival with a 45-minute chant, which Dr.
James Fadiman, a Stanford lecturer in
mechanical engineering and the evening's
master of ceremonies, called "elementary
calisthentics" designed "to warm you up
and get you high."
In cautioning the audience not to
approach the Swami skeptically, Fadiman
urged, "Open your ear by your stomach,
where your intellect won't interfere."
Beautiful Bottle
"It doesn't matter what kind of bottle
the blessing comes in," Fadiman
continued. "Swami Muktananda happens
to be a very beautiful bottle."
Muktananda opened his talk with an
anecdote about a visit he paid upon an
atomic energy plant in Bombay, India. A
physicist friend explained to the guru how
solid mass was turned into fluid and later
electrical rays. At one point, when asked to
wear an anti-radiation suit, Muktananda

replied, "Why put on this strange suit?"
He told the physicist that "whatever
you see is nothing but self-energy. The
same energy dwells in man."
This shakti is vital to humans,
Muktananda said. 'The sages have said that
for those without spiritual energy there is
no hope for accomplishment. That is our
greatest need — spiritual energy."
Totally Cleansed'
When shakti is awakened in a person, he
is transformed, the Swami said. "He
expands, realizes a whole universe within
his grasp." In addition, "one's organism is
totally cleansed" through such energy,
Muktananda said.
"Inner energy forms a new body inside
— one becomes young again. Though one's
hair turns gray, his heart never turns gray."
Muktananda revealed a distrust for
modern scientific equipment, which he said
relies on individual interpretations. He
recounted the tale of a reporter from a
Hindu newspaper who told him, "We
would like to have your head examined.
Won't you come to our laboratory?" The
Swami said, "Fine, but who will examine
what your instruments say? Why don't you
examine my head directly?"
Muktananda spent the second half of his
talk describing the "four bodies" to be
seen through meditation. Each is signalled
by a light, he said.
Red Light Stage
The first stage of meditation brings a
red light, which stands for the "physical
body." In this light's glow, the Swami said,
"you can see all the body's fluids being
circulated through the body, very

distinctly — it's easy to see."
If one goes deeper, the "subtle body" is
seen as a thumb-sized white light. One
dreams in this body, Muktananda said.
Deeper still one finds the "causal
body," signalled by a black dot the size of
half a finger tip. In this "total blackness"
one achieves dreamless sleep, he said.
Finally, the meditator reaches the
"supracausal body," represented by a
"blue pearl" the size of a lentil seed. "Your
eyes are focused on the blue, sparkling in
the center of the cerebrum — it is your
soul," said Muktananda.
Blue Pearl Vibrations
The vibrations of the blue pearl
determine the flow of blood, digestion of
food and all body functions, he said.
The pearl also brings "celestial
harmonies," Muktananda revealed. "All
music is an attempt to recreate these inner
harmonies. It is impossible to actually copy
them. The divine music from the pearl
makes you so high, you never come
down."
One's ocular centers become so purified
that one can see without light, the Swami
said. For this reason, the Swami wears sun
glasses during his talks. The pearl allows
one to "hear conversations going on in
your neighbor's house," Muktanada
claimed, and has an effect on other senses
as well.
The Swami closed his presentation with
a synopsis of his mission: "In the center of
your body dwells shakti. In an unawakened
state, it is dormant. A guru's role is to
awaken it. It is most efficient, successful
and blissful to have an awakened state."
