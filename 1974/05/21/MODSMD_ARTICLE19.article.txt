# Cold Blood At Keystone Berkeley
## Lydia Pense: Queen Of Any Night 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
BERKELEY — She sings lower,
wails higher, whispers softer and
shouts louder than any other lady
who ever sang the blues. Lydia
Pense is the queen of this or any
other night.
She doesn't wear feathers or
gold pants or spiked heels or
sorceress makeup. She hasn't
burnt out on smack, attracted
cults of dubious sexuality or
extolled the virtues of acid.
The little lady just sings.

Blonde and beautiful, exuding
a confidence and stage presence
seen in all too few pop musicians,
Lydia Pense delivers a personal
earthquake to every member of
her audience — she does what
batteries of synthesizers in
quadrophonic fail to do.
Backed by her ever changing
yet always competent crew of
musicians, Lydia danced all over
the stage at Keystone Berkeley
Saturday. While the band began
the set with "Valdez In The

Country," a heady instrumental
from Cold Blood's third album,
First Taste Of Sin, Lydia bounced
around the back of the stage.
Stepping up to belt out the
first lines of "Too Many People,"
Lydia's giant voice belied the fact
that she is all of five foot two
when she's wearing three inches of
platform sole and heel.
The voice — it packs Janis
Joplin power, but Lydia's voice is
sensuous sherry-smooth. With
equal ease she scrapes the bottom
of her register and glides up to
whine out notes above guitarist
Michael Sasaki's highest riffs.
When Lydia doesn't sing, she
dances; when she's not dancing,
she giggles and winks at her
musicians. Every ounce of her
tiny body rippling with tension,
she shakes her lioness heap of
golden hair, smiling from beneath
it as it falls in her face.
Saturday's show at Berkeley
presented a small eight man group
behind Lydia, but the tight Cold
Blood horns were only damaged
slightly by the missing sax of Skip

Mesquite, former Tower of Power
member who appeared on Cold
Blood's last album, Thriller.
Perhaps the group's stage
personality was damaged more
than its music was, since
Mesquite's jovial "big daddy"
style always warms an audience.
The horns were tight and
powerful despite new personnel
and new music which will appear
on the band's forthcoming fifth
album. Actually, Cold Blood was
more stable on the new numbers
such as "Just Like Sunshine" than
they were on some of the oldies
like "Down To The Bone."
The horns were most
outstanding on "Feel So Bad,"
but the usually strange tempo of
the piece had been altered in such
a way that it sounded strange even
to those familiar with it. Even so,
the song provided the perfect
blend of overpowering horns and
Lydia's amazing ' upper register,
forming the climax of the night.
Although keyboardman
arranger Raul Matute vetoed an

encore, seeing as how it was five
to two in the morning, Cold
Blood finished with their
traditional show closer, "I Wish 1
Knew How It Would Feel To Be
Free."
Lydia blended her voice with
trumpeter Max Haskett's in a new
harmony ending, adding another
version to the endless number of
ways this song has been sung since
Lydia recorded it six years ago.
But it's funny to hear the most
lively lady ever to hit the Bay
Area scream out for freedom.
Lydia Pense has endured the
strain of reaching the top,
unshackled by gimmicks or drugs,
spreading her own sense of
freedom with the most honest and
gripping voice this reviewer has
ever heard.
When listening to most
vocalists you are conscious of the
singer-song dichotomy. When
Lydia sings, you hear not a song,
but a little lady singing her
tremendous free soul.

Joplin power, but Lydia's voice is
sensuous sherry-smooth. With
equal ease she scrapes the bottom
of her register and glides up to
whine out notes above guitarist
Michael Sasaki's highest riffs.
When Lydia doesn't sing, she
dances; when she's not dancing,
she giggles and winks at her
musicians. Every ounce of her
tiny body rippling with tension,
she shakes her lioness heap of
golden hair, smiling from beneath
it as it falls in her face.
Saturday's show at Berkeley
presented a small eight man group
behind Lydia, but the tight Cold
Blood horns were only damaged
slightly by the missing sax of Skip

Mesquite, former Tower of Power
member who appeared on Cold
Blood's last album, Thriller.
Perhaps the group's stage
personality was damaged more
than its music was, since
Mesquite's jovial "big daddy"
style always warms an audience.
The horns were tight and
powerful despite new personnel
and new music which will appear
on the band's forthcoming fifth
album. Actually, Cold Blood was
more stable on the new numbers
such as "Just Like Sunshine" than
they were on some of the oldies
like "Down To The Bone."
The horns were most
outstanding on "Feel So Bad,"
but the usually strange tempo of
the piece had been altered in such
a way that it sounded strange even
to those familiar with it. Even so,
the song provided the perfect
blend of overpowering horns and
Lydia's amazing ' upper register,
forming the climax of the night.
Although keyboardman
arranger Raul Matute vetoed an

encore, seeing as how it was five
to two in the morning, Cold
Blood finished with their
traditional show closer, "I Wish 1
Knew How It Would Feel To Be
Free."
Lydia blended her voice with
trumpeter Max Haskett's in a new
harmony ending, adding another
version to the endless number of
ways this song has been sung since
Lydia recorded it six years ago.
But it's funny to hear the most
lively lady ever to hit the Bay
Area scream out for freedom.
Lydia Pense has endured the
strain of reaching the top,
unshackled by gimmicks or drugs,
spreading her own sense of
freedom with the most honest and
gripping voice this reviewer has
ever heard.
When listening to most
vocalists you are conscious of the
singer-song dichotomy. When
Lydia sings, you hear not a song,
but a little lady singing her
tremendous free soul.

LYDIA PENSE
BERKELEY — She sings lower,
wails higher, whispers softer and
shouts louder than any other lady
who ever sang the blues. Lydia
Pense is the queen of this or any
other night.
She doesn't wear feathers or
gold pants or spiked heels or
sorceress makeup. She hasn't
burnt out on smack, attracted
cults of dubious sexuality or
extolled the virtues of acid.
The little lady just sings.

Blonde and beautiful, exuding
a confidence and stage presence
seen in all too few pop musicians,
Lydia Pense delivers a personal
earthquake to every member of
her audience — she does what
batteries of synthesizers in
quadrophonic fail to do.
Backed by her ever changing
yet always competent crew of
musicians, Lydia danced all over
the stage at Keystone Berkeley
Saturday. While the band began
the set with "Valdez In The

Country," a heady instrumental
from Cold Blood's third album,
First Taste Of Sin, Lydia bounced
around the back of the stage.
Stepping up to belt out the
first lines of "Too Many People,"
Lydia's giant voice belied the fact
that she is all of five foot two
when she's wearing three inches of
platform sole and heel.
The voice — it packs Janis
Joplin power, but Lydia's voice is
sensuous sherry-smooth. With
equal ease she scrapes the bottom
of her register and glides up to
whine out notes above guitarist
Michael Sasaki's highest riffs.
