# Medical School Dean Says Clinical Teaching 'Uneven'
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich
admitted yesterday that the school's
clinical teaching program is "uneven,"
— good overall, but weak in some areas
— but he stressed that the school has a
"strong commitment" to providing a
top-notch clinical education for its
students.
Speaking on a taping of KZSU's
Campus Conference, Rich
characterized the Medical School's
teaching program as "very good," but
"it is not as good as it could be or
should be considering the exceptional
quality of our students."
Rich said the Medical School has
changed its emphasis "very
substantially" since he has become
dean and pointed to budget changes'-
designed to increase the emphasis on
teaching.
The school has selected department
chairmen with a "strong emphasis" on
the individual's "personal commitment
to teaching," he said.
Department Chairmen
One-third of the school's 17
departments — including the two
largest, medicine and surgery — now
lack chairmen.
Rich blamed these vacancies on the
resignations of chairmen who have
served over a decade and who felt a
need to move on.
Rich said recruitment for filling
Medical School chairmanships has
continued "outstandingly well" and
that the school has been able to fill
posts with his first choices.
He attributed difficulty in
attracting a chairman for both the
anatomy and the physiology
departments entirely to "space
limitations," but added that the
planned construction of a new
building closer to the Medical Center
to house these departments should
make the search for chairmen easier.
"The construction will take a
couple of years, but it's a long step in
the right direction," Rich said. The
anatomy and physiology departments
are currently housed in 70-year-old
buildings near the Stanford museum
and on the outer quad.
Denies Complaints
Rich denied student complaints
that the school has failed to emphasize
teaching quality in decisions on
faculty appointment and tenure.
"It is more difficult to evaluate
teaching than research, and we are
anxious to develop more objective and
more certain methods of evaluating
teaching," he said.
The possibility of losing the

school's only affiliated general
hospital, the county-operated Valley
Medical Center in San Jose, is "fairly
remote," according to the dean.
The uncertainty which surrounds
the hospital affiliation stems from the
county's financial considerations, not
from any lack of participation by Stan
ford staff, Rich said.
Campus Conference will be
broadcast tonight at 7.
