# Series Continues With 'A Sleep Of Prisoners'
## 
### 
A Sleep of Prisoners by
Christopher Fry opens May 22
and runs through May 25 in
Stanford Memorial Church at 8
p.m. Admission is free to all.
The second play in the
Memorial Church drama series,
A Sleep of Prisoners depicts
four common soldiers
imprisoned in a church. There,
in a state of trance-like sleep,
the man's subconscious
relationships to each other and
their world are played out in
terms of Biblical archtypes.
Moving on several levels at
once, the work is spiced with
Fry's special wit and verbal
wizardry that bind philosophy
and emotion into a human
drama.
Creating the play's four
demanding roles are freshmen
Mark Mueller and Ed Griffin
who recently participated in

the Memorial Church
presentation of The Easter Play
of Trier, senior Cliff Paepke
making his Stanford debut, and
Bill Moreing who was last seen
at Stanford in the Summer
Comedy Workshop.
Set and lighting are designed
by Ralph Garrow, a senior in
the Drama Department. Don
Bowman, a Drama Ph.D.
student, directs the
production.
Avoiding, even mocking,
any sermonizing tone, A Sleep
of Prisoners examines and
questions man's place in his
world and his possible future
with honesty, dramatic vitality
and considerable humor.
Acknowledged as Fry's
masterpiece, the play brings to
its audience lively ideas,
pointed questions, and a fine
evening of theatre.
