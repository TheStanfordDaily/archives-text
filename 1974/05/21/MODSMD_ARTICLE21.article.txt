# Book Chronicles 'Odd Bodkins' History
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Hugh Daniel O'Neill's "Odd
Bodkins," which was syndicated
by the San Francisco Chronicle
from 1963 to 1970, belongs in a
small class with "Doonesbury"
and "Pogo" and a few other
comic strips.
Each of them has caused grey
(or torn) hair among editorial
types for their frequent habit of
ridiculing that which is ridiculous.
O'Neill has now gathered a
"collective" of his strips from
1967 to 1970 into a book, The
Collective Unconscience of Odd
Bodkins.
The familiar characters from
the strip are all there: Fred, the
fearless Scorpio bird; Hugh, a
humanoid of sorts; Norton, the
motorcycle; Bruce, the highway
patrolman; the Bat-Winged
Hamburger Snatcher;
Vere-chicken; General Injuns; $5
Bill O'Brady; the pilgrim; and
Bucky Bug, the history bee.
As Richard Milner's "Forward"
tells, O'Neill was told when he
was hired to avoid religion,
politics and sex in the strip. He
managed to keep sex out.
A latter-day Cyrano armed
with a felt-tipped pen, O'Neill
does not hesitate to expose
hypocrisy or idiocy on any side of
him, politically or otherwise.
Revolutionaries and
Establishment politicians are both
pilloried for their excesses. Drug
use and users are presented both
humorously and satirically.
But Public Enemy Number
One in O'Neill's world is hostility,
a theme which runs throughout
the book. In his own words, "It
starts when you respond and
grows large enough to carry you

away. Hostility is a locomotive —
don't step in front of it."
Not all of the book is heavy or
political or metaphysical,
however. At times it is just plain
funny. In one section, he analyzes
and illustrates several astrological
signs; in another he gathers several
strips involving Hugh and Norton,
his motorcycle, including "The
Norton Through History."
The longest continuous
segment of the book gathers all
the strips from January through
July, 1970. During this time,
Hugh and Fred learn that the
Martian atmosphere is half
gasoline; they then deduce that
the gasoline engine and the
resultant smog is a Martian plot to
prepare the country for an
invasion.
After speaking blasphemy
before General Injuns ("Buy a
used car!"), they flee, and wind
up meeting $5 Bill O'Brady in a
ghost town. After discussing the
Martian problem over a bottle
with Bill, Fred proposes a
counter-invasion of Mars, and the
three fly to Mars by putting a
Magic Cookie in Norton's gas
tank.
On Mars, they learn from the
history bee that the Martian
takeover began with the Industrial
Revolution, and that "politics is
poopadoodle!" But they
mysteriously die on Mars, and the
scene shifts to Hell, where they
are punished for 10,000 years or
so by having to eat a sea of
tapioca pudding. They are finally
rescued on the astral plain by
Norton and the Bat-Winged
Hamburger snatcher, but
disappear from the strip for the
rest of its life.

The remainder of the book is
mostly made up of the ramblings
and musings of the Pilgrim, and of
Bucky Bug. Bucky Bug who asks
such difficult questions as "What
did the chicken do after he got to
the other side?"
Bucky Bug discovers that "one
of the next 50 drivers coming
your way is drunk. 49 of the next
50 drivers coming your way are
cynics."

The Collective Unconscience of
Odd Bodkins gathers several
hundred examples of the work of
a man who sees and talks about
the world in slightly different
ways than most — certainly
stranger than most cartoonists.
The world of Odd Bodkins is a
world seen through the eyes of
one "who is in favor of a violent
revolution only if no one gets
hurt."

Hugh Daniel O'Neill's "Odd
Bodkins," which was syndicated
by the San Francisco Chronicle
from 1963 to 1970, belongs in a
small class with "Doonesbury"
and "Pogo" and a few other
comic strips.
Each of them has caused grey
(or torn) hair among editorial
types for their frequent habit of
ridiculing that which is ridiculous.
O'Neill has now gathered a
"collective" of his strips from
1967 to 1970 into a book, The
Collective Unconscience of Odd
Bodkins.
The familiar characters from
the strip are all there: Fred, the
fearless Scorpio bird; Hugh, a
humanoid of sorts; Norton, the
motorcycle; Bruce, the highway
patrolman; the Bat-Winged
Hamburger Snatcher;
Vere-chicken; General Injuns; $5
Bill O'Brady; the pilgrim; and
Bucky Bug, the history bee.
As Richard Milner's "Forward"
tells, O'Neill was told when he
was hired to avoid religion,
politics and sex in the strip. He
managed to keep sex out.
A latter-day Cyrano armed
with a felt-tipped pen, O'Neill
does not hesitate to expose
hypocrisy or idiocy on any side of
him, politically or otherwise.
Revolutionaries and
Establishment politicians are both
pilloried for their excesses. Drug
use and users are presented both
humorously and satirically.
But Public Enemy Number
One in O'Neill's world is hostility,
a theme which runs throughout
the book. In his own words, "It
starts when you respond and
grows large enough to carry you

away. Hostility is a locomotive —
don't step in front of it."
Not all of the book is heavy or
political or metaphysical,
however. At times it is just plain
funny. In one section, he analyzes
and illustrates several astrological
signs; in another he gathers several
strips involving Hugh and Norton,
his motorcycle, including "The
Norton Through History."
The longest continuous
segment of the book gathers all
the strips from January through
July, 1970. During this time,
Hugh and Fred learn that the
Martian atmosphere is half
gasoline; they then deduce that
the gasoline engine and the
resultant smog is a Martian plot to
prepare the country for an
invasion.
After speaking blasphemy
before General Injuns ("Buy a
used car!"), they flee, and wind
up meeting $5 Bill O'Brady in a
ghost town. After discussing the
Martian problem over a bottle
with Bill, Fred proposes a
counter-invasion of Mars, and the
three fly to Mars by putting a
Magic Cookie in Norton's gas
tank.
On Mars, they learn from the
history bee that the Martian
takeover began with the Industrial
Revolution, and that "politics is
poopadoodle!" But they
mysteriously die on Mars, and the
scene shifts to Hell, where they
are punished for 10,000 years or
so by having to eat a sea of
tapioca pudding. They are finally
rescued on the astral plain by
Norton and the Bat-Winged
Hamburger snatcher, but
disappear from the strip for the
rest of its life.

The remainder of the book is
mostly made up of the ramblings
and musings of the Pilgrim, and of
Bucky Bug. Bucky Bug who asks
such difficult questions as "What
did the chicken do after he got to
the other side?"
Bucky Bug discovers that "one
of the next 50 drivers coming
your way is drunk. 49 of the next
50 drivers coming your way are
cynics."
