# Gerry Mulligan At El Matador
## Perfection Shows 
### VICKI LaBRIE 
SAN FRANCISCO—Gerry
Mulligan, best known for his work
with Dave Brubeck, is a
perfectionist who doesn't stand
for any nonsense, either from the
audience or his own group, and he
is just as demanding of himself.
He will stop his group if he hasn't
heard a specific chord in the
sequence that the tune dictates
and won't continue till it's been
played.
At the beginning of "Polka
Dots and Moonbeams," pianist
Larry Vuckovich played the
introduction too sweetly and was
given a lecture on the mock
seriousness of "a pug-nosed
dream." Mulligan's outspokenness
pleased the audience of two dozen
which grew as the evening passed.
The group Mulligan engaged,
which included Bob Maize on bass
and Benny Barth on drums, at El
Matador Thursday night, May 16,
had been together barely a week;
yet the only trace of rushed
preparation was the presence of
sheet music.
The first set opened with "For
an Unfinished Woman," the beat
gentle as a wave. The bacs solo by

Maize was rhythmic and crisp and
a riff he played inspired Mulligan
to incorporate it into the final
measures of the song. The dry,
warm tone of his baritone sax
emanates from his whole
instrument, not just from the
reed, and sounds right with fluid,
lyrical numbers like this one.
Vuckovich managed to keep up
with the swinging tempo of "Line
for Lyons" as Mulligan accented
the piano and bass solos, the latter
evolving into a baritone sax and
bass conversation which was given
too fleeting a life.
"K4 Pacific" (dedicated to a
locomotive) began with some
fierce blowing on Mulligan's part
and then shifted gears to a
swaying bluesy tempo, picking up
again. Vuckovich's solo contained
one-note passages consisting of
three to four notes and short
breaks.
Mulligan composes most of the
songs he performs, so it is to the
credit of his group that they
worked so well together in so
little time.
"The Five Brothers," which he
wrote with A 1 Cohn, Allen Eager,
Zoot Sims, Stan Getz and Bru
Moore (all saxophonists) in mind,
had a pleasing melody and easy
beat. Vuckovich played a solid
solo, Maize performed some
interesting riffs and phrases, while
Barth demonstrated some splashy
drum breaks in between choruses.
On vacation, Gerry Mulligan
was generous enough to push it
aside for an engagement at El
Matador. I hope he enjoyed his
vacation as much as we did.

yet the only trace of rushed
preparation was the presence of
sheet music.
The first set opened with "For
an Unfinished Woman," the beat
gentle as a wave. The bacs solo by

Maize was rhythmic and crisp and
a riff he played inspired Mulligan
to incorporate it into the final
measures of the song. The dry,
warm tone of his baritone sax
emanates from his whole
instrument, not just from the
reed, and sounds right with fluid,
lyrical numbers like this one.
Vuckovich managed to keep up
with the swinging tempo of "Line
for Lyons" as Mulligan accented
the piano and bass solos, the latter
evolving into a baritone sax and
bass conversation which was given
too fleeting a life.
"K4 Pacific" (dedicated to a
locomotive) began with some
fierce blowing on Mulligan's part
and then shifted gears to a
swaying bluesy tempo, picking up
again. Vuckovich's solo contained
one-note passages consisting of
three to four notes and short
breaks.
Mulligan composes most of the
songs he performs, so it is to the
credit of his group that they
worked so well together in so
little time.
"The Five Brothers," which he
wrote with A 1 Cohn, Allen Eager,
Zoot Sims, Stan Getz and Bru
Moore (all saxophonists) in mind,
had a pleasing melody and easy
beat. Vuckovich played a solid
solo, Maize performed some
interesting riffs and phrases, while
Barth demonstrated some splashy
drum breaks in between choruses.
On vacation, Gerry Mulligan
was generous enough to push it
aside for an engagement at El
Matador. I hope he enjoyed his
vacation as much as we did.
SAN FRANCISCO—Gerry
Mulligan, best known for his work
with Dave Brubeck, is a
perfectionist who doesn't stand
for any nonsense, either from the
audience or his own group, and he
is just as demanding of himself.
He will stop his group if he hasn't
heard a specific chord in the
sequence that the tune dictates
and won't continue till it's been
played.
At the beginning of "Polka
Dots and Moonbeams," pianist
Larry Vuckovich played the
introduction too sweetly and was
given a lecture on the mock
seriousness of "a pug-nosed
dream." Mulligan's outspokenness
pleased the audience of two dozen
which grew as the evening passed.
The group Mulligan engaged,
which included Bob Maize on bass
and Benny Barth on drums, at El
Matador Thursday night, May 16,
had been together barely a week;
yet the only trace of rushed
preparation was the presence of
sheet music.
The first set opened with "For
an Unfinished Woman," the beat
gentle as a wave. The bacs solo by

Maize was rhythmic and crisp and
