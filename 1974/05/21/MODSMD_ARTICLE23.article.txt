Patricia Hearst To Be Indicted?
SAN FRANCISCO — A U.S. attorney said yesterday it is
"entirely possible" that Patricia Hearst now will be indicted
for bank robbery in a Symbionese Liberation Army holdup
here last month.
"It would be entirely possible that a federal grand jury
would return an indictment of Patricia Hearst in the bank
robbery" this week, U.S. Attorney James L. Browning Jr.
told newsmen.
He said the grand jury probing the $10,690 SLA robbery
April 15 of a Hibernia Bank branch and the Hearst
kidnaping will reconvene Thursday.
Sources close to the investigation said Thomas Mathews,
18, of Los Angeles, may be called to testify. Mathews told
authorities he was kidnaped Friday and one captor, a
woman he identified as Patricia Hearst, told him she
willingly took part in the bank robbery. Another
prospective witness was identified as Christine Johnson, 35,
who ran from the Los Angeles house during the Friday
gunbattle in which six SLA figures died.
The grand jury was called "to hear evidence which was
not available last week," Browning said.
He also said that a warrant for Patricia's arrest as a
material witness will not be dismissed since she is wanted
not only as a witness to the bank robbery but also as a
witness to her Feb. 4 kidnaping in Berkeley.
Meanwhile, Los Angeles police and FBI agents pressed
their search for Patricia and two Symbionese Liberation
Army members apparently now her comrades, but officials
acknowledged a growing feeling the fugitives may have fled
the city.
In Hillsborough, Patricia's father said she may have been
brainwashed or the victim of mind control. Both her
parents begged their daughter, described by authorities as
"armed and extremely dangerous," to abandon the SLA
and give herself up.
But Randolph Hearst added: "At this point in time I
don't believe that she will give herself up to come home."
Hearst, editor and president of the San Francisco
Examiner, said he thinks his daughter "honestly believes
now that she's a member of the group. This sort of
brainwashing is not an unheard of thing."
Many persons, including the Hearst family cook, claimed
to have seen the newspaper heiress in locations from Los
Angeles to San Francisco, and authorities were receiving
many crank calls.
"If they've got any sense, they'd have left," said Police
Cmdr. Peter Hagan. "Things are getting hot here."
"Your idea is as good as ours," FBI spokesman John
Morrison said when asked where Patricia might be hiding.
But he added that the focus of the search was still in Los
Angeles.
Police officers in California have the descriptions of
Patricia, 20, and Emily and William Harris, both in their
late 20s, Hagan said. He said more than 100 police officers
and FBI agents were assigned to the case.
Reinecke Blasts Prosecution
SACRAMENTO — California Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke
angrily claimed yesterday he is the victim of a "political
witchhunt" by Watergate prosecutors and would fight on
for the governorship.
"Quitting is not a consideration," Reinecke said after a
federal judge in Washington refused to dismiss the
three-count perjury indictment against him. "I am not
pulling out of the race."
And for the first time, Reinecke launched a personal
attack on his opponent in the June 4 Republican primary,
state Controller Houston I. Flournoy.
Reinecke said he would fight to the wire with his
low-budget campaign while "my opponent bombards the
people of California with his million-dollar advertising
campaign, financed by the special interests of California."
He told a news conference in the Capitol he didn't think
Flournoy, now the frontrunner in the polls, could defeat
either Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr. or
Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti, running first and second in
polls in the Democratic primary to succeed Ronald Reagan.
Reinecke had counted heavily on dismissal of the
charges to get his beleaguered campaign moving again. The
trial now is scheduled to start in Washington July 15. He
also lost a motion to have it moved to California.
Reinecke reiterated that he is "absolutely not guilty"
and said he would prove it this summer.
Reinecke accused the office of Special Watergate
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski of postponing the indictment
against him until it was too late to clear himself before the
primary.
Israel, Syria Near Agreement
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
has completed agreement "for all practical purposes" with
Syrian President Hafez Assad on a disengagement line in the

Golan Heights, a senior American official said last night.
Shuttling back to Israel from Damascus for a late session
with the Israeli negotiating team, Kissinger was said to have
made good progress as well on the delineation of a buffer
zone to be manned by a United Nations force between the
separate armies.
He will return to Damascus today and continue the daily
round trips through the week. He plans to return to
Washington this weekend regardless of whether all points in
the settlement package are resolved, newsmen were told
aboard his plane.
Looking tired before his departure for Israel, Kissinger
said at the Damascus airport he and the Syrians continued
"extensive conversations which as usual were conducted in
a very constructive spirit."
Kissinger's talks with Assad concentrated on thinning
out the opposing armies on the Golan Heights.
The process is expected to occupy several of Kissinger's
daily round of trips from Israel now that he has gained the
tentative acceptance of both sides of a U.S.-proposed
disengagement line.
The secretary of state also worked with Assad and
Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam on getting the line
itself "buttoned up," U.S. officials said.
As the agreement began to take shape, newsmen were
told that the battle zone separating the armies will vary in
depth from less than a half-mile to a little over one mile and
that Kissinger did not anticipate difficulty in arranging an
exchange of prisoners.
Israel has agreed to allow Syrian policemen to re-enter
the towns and villages within the demilitarized zones that
will be yielded to Syrian civilians, these officials said.
Extremists Paralyze Belfast
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Protestant extremists
paralyzed Belfast yesterday by barricading every major road
into the city and vowed they were "ready to die" unless
their demands were met.
Armed paramilitary groups threw up blockades of
hijacked cars, trucks and buses in an effort to increase
pressure on the British government, already burdened by a
six-day strike, to abandon proposals to give the Roman
Catholic minority a share in running the province.
The British Defense Ministry announced it was sending
about 500 British infantrymen into Northern Ireland to
help keep the peace.
A ministry spokesman said the troops "will be in
support of the civilian powers" along with the other 15,500
troops Britain normally keeps in Northern Ireland.
The only traffic allowed into Belfast yesterday was food
and milk trucks. British army patrols were stopped. Fist
fights broke out around several barricades.
Protestant extremists declared South Belfast, with a
population of more than 60,000, off limits to British
troops.
The strike appeared almost 100 percent effective. Most
shops, offices and factories were closed and Belfast's
shipyard, it's biggest employer, was at a standstill.
Attempts by labor union leaders to mediate appeared
doomed. The Protestant militants said they would not talk
with Len Murray, secretary general of Britain's powerful
Trades Union Congress, who flew to Belfast yesterday.
Nixon Backs Health Insurance Bill
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. — President Nixon appealed
yesterday for swift passage of a national health insurance
plan to make quality care within reach of every American
while maintaining the private medical system.
Nixon said in a radio address the issue has grown more
urgent because of projections that doctor bills may climb
22 percent this year due to the end of price controls.
The President, winding up a four-day weekend in Florida
and the Bahamas, indicated a willingness to compromise
with alternative plans now before Congress so long as it
would not "violate the basic principles of our proposals."
He complained, however, that two competing
Democratic proposals would rely too heavily on
government management. He insisted that any compromise
include a patient's freedom to choose his own physician,
and that it be founded on the existing private health care
system.
He said 1974 can and should be the year for legislation
to insure that "every American has financial access to high
quality health care."
He warned that the end of wage-price controls has raised
the possibility "of an unbridled increase" in medical costs.
Nixon urged the private health industry to do everything
it can voluntarily "to keep the brake on rising health care
costs."
"But voluntary restraints will not be enough," he said.
"We must have legislation."
Senate Passes Education Bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate passed yesterday a

$24-billion education bill to extend the government's
school aid programs another four years while retaining the
authority of the federal courts to pursue desegregation
through busing.
The measure, which now goes to a conference with the
House, modifies many of the programs, including a cutback
of the amounts which schools may ask from the
government for programs aimed at underprivileged children.
The Senate's vote was 81 to five.
The bill exceeds the amounts sought by President Nixon,
who also objects on grounds that much of the money is not
left to local discretion as to spending purposes. He has
threatened a veto unless the bill is changed more to his
liking in conference.
Earlier, the Senate passed a belt-tightening $980 million
authorization for the State Department's operations for the
fiscal year beginning July 1.
The measure requires a two percent personnel cut and
includes a requirement that the secretary of state submit a
plan for phased reduction of U.S. aid to South Vietnam.
The House, meanwhile, opened debate on a $22.6 billion
military procurement authorization, with the biggest fight
expected to come on a move to cut military aid to South
Vietnam to $900 million. It's now set at $1.4 billion.
Voting is scheduled for today.
Cronkite Defends Reporter
LOS ANGELES — TV newsman Walter Cronkite,
testifying in a small Los Angeles courtroom on behalf of

reporter William Farr, told a judge yesterday that a
reporter's right to keep sources secret "is so fundamental to
our system that I cannot see how our system can function
without it."
Cronkite said he believes that if Farr were forced to
reveal his sources of a controversial Manson trial story "it
would be another nail in the coffin of freedom of speech
and press. It's that serious."
Under biting cross-examination by Deputy County
Counsel William Stewart, Cronkite declared that he believes
a reporter's right is so important that a journalist faced with
jail for refusing to name a source should take the jail
sentence even if it seems like martyrdom to some.
"I should think that any journalist worth his salt would
hold to his confidence," Cronkite said.
The CBS-TV anchorman was one of several top
journalists called by Farr's attorney Mark Hurwitz, in a
crucial hearing which could determine if Farr must return
to jail. Farr, 36, now a reporter for the Los Angeles Times,
has served 46 days in jail in a dispute with the Manson trial
judge, Charles Older, over a story Farr wrote while working
for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner.
Today's Weather

plan for phased reduction of U.S. aid to South Vietnam.
The House, meanwhile, opened debate on a $22.6 billion
military procurement authorization, with the biggest fight
expected to come on a move to cut military aid to South
Vietnam to $900 million. It's now set at $1.4 billion.
Voting is scheduled for today.
Cronkite Defends Reporter
LOS ANGELES — TV newsman Walter Cronkite,
testifying in a small Los Angeles courtroom on behalf of

reporter William Farr, told a judge yesterday that a
reporter's right to keep sources secret "is so fundamental to
our system that I cannot see how our system can function
without it."
Cronkite said he believes that if Farr were forced to
reveal his sources of a controversial Manson trial story "it
would be another nail in the coffin of freedom of speech
and press. It's that serious."
Under biting cross-examination by Deputy County
Counsel William Stewart, Cronkite declared that he believes
a reporter's right is so important that a journalist faced with
jail for refusing to name a source should take the jail
sentence even if it seems like martyrdom to some.
"I should think that any journalist worth his salt would
hold to his confidence," Cronkite said.
The CBS-TV anchorman was one of several top
journalists called by Farr's attorney Mark Hurwitz, in a
crucial hearing which could determine if Farr must return
to jail. Farr, 36, now a reporter for the Los Angeles Times,
has served 46 days in jail in a dispute with the Manson trial
judge, Charles Older, over a story Farr wrote while working
for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except night and morning low
clouds. Little temperature change. Lows tonight in mid 40s

Patricia Hearst To Be Indicted?
SAN FRANCISCO — A U.S. attorney said yesterday it is
"entirely possible" that Patricia Hearst now will be indicted
for bank robbery in a Symbionese Liberation Army holdup
here last month.
"It would be entirely possible that a federal grand jury
would return an indictment of Patricia Hearst in the bank
robbery" this week, U.S. Attorney James L. Browning Jr.
told newsmen.
He said the grand jury probing the $10,690 SLA robbery
April 15 of a Hibernia Bank branch and the Hearst
kidnaping will reconvene Thursday.
Sources close to the investigation said Thomas Mathews,
18, of Los Angeles, may be called to testify. Mathews told
authorities he was kidnaped Friday and one captor, a
woman he identified as Patricia Hearst, told him she
willingly took part in the bank robbery. Another
prospective witness was identified as Christine Johnson, 35,
who ran from the Los Angeles house during the Friday
gunbattle in which six SLA figures died.
The grand jury was called "to hear evidence which was
not available last week," Browning said.
He also said that a warrant for Patricia's arrest as a
material witness will not be dismissed since she is wanted
not only as a witness to the bank robbery but also as a
witness to her Feb. 4 kidnaping in Berkeley.
Meanwhile, Los Angeles police and FBI agents pressed
their search for Patricia and two Symbionese Liberation
Army members apparently now her comrades, but officials
acknowledged a growing feeling the fugitives may have fled
the city.
In Hillsborough, Patricia's father said she may have been
brainwashed or the victim of mind control. Both her
parents begged their daughter, described by authorities as
"armed and extremely dangerous," to abandon the SLA
and give herself up.
But Randolph Hearst added: "At this point in time I
don't believe that she will give herself up to come home."
Hearst, editor and president of the San Francisco
Examiner, said he thinks his daughter "honestly believes
now that she's a member of the group. This sort of
brainwashing is not an unheard of thing."
Many persons, including the Hearst family cook, claimed
to have seen the newspaper heiress in locations from Los
Angeles to San Francisco, and authorities were receiving
many crank calls.
"If they've got any sense, they'd have left," said Police
Cmdr. Peter Hagan. "Things are getting hot here."
"Your idea is as good as ours," FBI spokesman John
Morrison said when asked where Patricia might be hiding.
But he added that the focus of the search was still in Los
Angeles.
Police officers in California have the descriptions of
Patricia, 20, and Emily and William Harris, both in their
late 20s, Hagan said. He said more than 100 police officers
and FBI agents were assigned to the case.
Reinecke Blasts Prosecution
SACRAMENTO — California Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke
angrily claimed yesterday he is the victim of a "political
witchhunt" by Watergate prosecutors and would fight on
for the governorship.
"Quitting is not a consideration," Reinecke said after a
federal judge in Washington refused to dismiss the
three-count perjury indictment against him. "I am not
pulling out of the race."
And for the first time, Reinecke launched a personal
attack on his opponent in the June 4 Republican primary,
state Controller Houston I. Flournoy.
Reinecke said he would fight to the wire with his
low-budget campaign while "my opponent bombards the
people of California with his million-dollar advertising
campaign, financed by the special interests of California."
He told a news conference in the Capitol he didn't think
Flournoy, now the frontrunner in the polls, could defeat
either Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr. or
Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti, running first and second in
polls in the Democratic primary to succeed Ronald Reagan.
Reinecke had counted heavily on dismissal of the
charges to get his beleaguered campaign moving again. The
trial now is scheduled to start in Washington July 15. He
also lost a motion to have it moved to California.
Reinecke reiterated that he is "absolutely not guilty"
and said he would prove it this summer.
Reinecke accused the office of Special Watergate
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski of postponing the indictment
against him until it was too late to clear himself before the
primary.
Israel, Syria Near Agreement
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
has completed agreement "for all practical purposes" with
Syrian President Hafez Assad on a disengagement line in the

Golan Heights, a senior American official said last night.
Shuttling back to Israel from Damascus for a late session
with the Israeli negotiating team, Kissinger was said to have
made good progress as well on the delineation of a buffer
zone to be manned by a United Nations force between the
separate armies.
He will return to Damascus today and continue the daily
round trips through the week. He plans to return to
Washington this weekend regardless of whether all points in
the settlement package are resolved, newsmen were told
aboard his plane.
Looking tired before his departure for Israel, Kissinger
said at the Damascus airport he and the Syrians continued
"extensive conversations which as usual were conducted in
a very constructive spirit."
Kissinger's talks with Assad concentrated on thinning
out the opposing armies on the Golan Heights.
The process is expected to occupy several of Kissinger's
daily round of trips from Israel now that he has gained the
tentative acceptance of both sides of a U.S.-proposed
disengagement line.
The secretary of state also worked with Assad and
Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam on getting the line
itself "buttoned up," U.S. officials said.
As the agreement began to take shape, newsmen were
told that the battle zone separating the armies will vary in
depth from less than a half-mile to a little over one mile and
that Kissinger did not anticipate difficulty in arranging an
exchange of prisoners.
Israel has agreed to allow Syrian policemen to re-enter
the towns and villages within the demilitarized zones that
will be yielded to Syrian civilians, these officials said.
Extremists Paralyze Belfast
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Protestant extremists
paralyzed Belfast yesterday by barricading every major road
into the city and vowed they were "ready to die" unless
their demands were met.
Armed paramilitary groups threw up blockades of
hijacked cars, trucks and buses in an effort to increase
pressure on the British government, already burdened by a
six-day strike, to abandon proposals to give the Roman
Catholic minority a share in running the province.
The British Defense Ministry announced it was sending
about 500 British infantrymen into Northern Ireland to
help keep the peace.
A ministry spokesman said the troops "will be in
support of the civilian powers" along with the other 15,500
troops Britain normally keeps in Northern Ireland.
The only traffic allowed into Belfast yesterday was food
and milk trucks. British army patrols were stopped. Fist
fights broke out around several barricades.
Protestant extremists declared South Belfast, with a
population of more than 60,000, off limits to British
troops.
The strike appeared almost 100 percent effective. Most
shops, offices and factories were closed and Belfast's
shipyard, it's biggest employer, was at a standstill.
Attempts by labor union leaders to mediate appeared
doomed. The Protestant militants said they would not talk
with Len Murray, secretary general of Britain's powerful
Trades Union Congress, who flew to Belfast yesterday.
Nixon Backs Health Insurance Bill
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. — President Nixon appealed
yesterday for swift passage of a national health insurance
plan to make quality care within reach of every American
while maintaining the private medical system.
Nixon said in a radio address the issue has grown more
urgent because of projections that doctor bills may climb
22 percent this year due to the end of price controls.
The President, winding up a four-day weekend in Florida
and the Bahamas, indicated a willingness to compromise
with alternative plans now before Congress so long as it
would not "violate the basic principles of our proposals."
He complained, however, that two competing
Democratic proposals would rely too heavily on
government management. He insisted that any compromise
include a patient's freedom to choose his own physician,
and that it be founded on the existing private health care
system.
He said 1974 can and should be the year for legislation
to insure that "every American has financial access to high
quality health care."
He warned that the end of wage-price controls has raised
the possibility "of an unbridled increase" in medical costs.
Nixon urged the private health industry to do everything
it can voluntarily "to keep the brake on rising health care
costs."
"But voluntary restraints will not be enough," he said.
"We must have legislation."
Senate Passes Education Bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate passed yesterday a

$24-billion education bill to extend the government's
school aid programs another four years while retaining the
authority of the federal courts to pursue desegregation
through busing.
The measure, which now goes to a conference with the
House, modifies many of the programs, including a cutback
of the amounts which schools may ask from the
government for programs aimed at underprivileged children.
The Senate's vote was 81 to five.
The bill exceeds the amounts sought by President Nixon,
who also objects on grounds that much of the money is not
left to local discretion as to spending purposes. He has
threatened a veto unless the bill is changed more to his
liking in conference.
Earlier, the Senate passed a belt-tightening $980 million
authorization for the State Department's operations for the
fiscal year beginning July 1.
The measure requires a two percent personnel cut and
includes a requirement that the secretary of state submit a
plan for phased reduction of U.S. aid to South Vietnam.
The House, meanwhile, opened debate on a $22.6 billion
military procurement authorization, with the biggest fight
expected to come on a move to cut military aid to South

22 percent this year due to the end of price controls.
The President, winding up a four-day weekend in Florida
and the Bahamas, indicated a willingness to compromise
with alternative plans now before Congress so long as it
would not "violate the basic principles of our proposals."
He complained, however, that two competing
Democratic proposals would rely too heavily on
government management. He insisted that any compromise
include a patient's freedom to choose his own physician,
and that it be founded on the existing private health care
system.
He said 1974 can and should be the year for legislation
to insure that "every American has financial access to high
quality health care."
He warned that the end of wage-price controls has raised
the possibility "of an unbridled increase" in medical costs.
Nixon urged the private health industry to do everything
it can voluntarily "to keep the brake on rising health care
costs."
"But voluntary restraints will not be enough," he said.
"We must have legislation."
Senate Passes Education Bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate passed yesterday a

$24-billion education bill to extend the government's
school aid programs another four years while retaining the
authority of the federal courts to pursue desegregation
through busing.
The measure, which now goes to a conference with the
House, modifies many of the programs, including a cutback
of the amounts which schools may ask from the
government for programs aimed at underprivileged children.
The Senate's vote was 81 to five.
The bill exceeds the amounts sought by President Nixon,
who also objects on grounds that much of the money is not
left to local discretion as to spending purposes. He has
threatened a veto unless the bill is changed more to his
liking in conference.
Earlier, the Senate passed a belt-tightening $980 million
authorization for the State Department's operations for the
fiscal year beginning July 1.
The measure requires a two percent personnel cut and
includes a requirement that the secretary of state submit a
plan for phased reduction of U.S. aid to South Vietnam.
The House, meanwhile, opened debate on a $22.6 billion
military procurement authorization, with the biggest fight
expected to come on a move to cut military aid to South
Vietnam to $900 million. It's now set at $1.4 billion.
Voting is scheduled for today.
Cronkite Defends Reporter
LOS ANGELES — TV newsman Walter Cronkite,
testifying in a small Los Angeles courtroom on behalf of

reporter William Farr, told a judge yesterday that a
reporter's right to keep sources secret "is so fundamental to
our system that I cannot see how our system can function
without it."
Cronkite said he believes that if Farr were forced to
reveal his sources of a controversial Manson trial story "it
would be another nail in the coffin of freedom of speech
and press. It's that serious."
Under biting cross-examination by Deputy County
Counsel William Stewart, Cronkite declared that he believes
a reporter's right is so important that a journalist faced with
jail for refusing to name a source should take the jail
sentence even if it seems like martyrdom to some.
"I should think that any journalist worth his salt would
hold to his confidence," Cronkite said.
The CBS-TV anchorman was one of several top
journalists called by Farr's attorney Mark Hurwitz, in a
crucial hearing which could determine if Farr must return
to jail. Farr, 36, now a reporter for the Los Angeles Times,
has served 46 days in jail in a dispute with the Manson trial
judge, Charles Older, over a story Farr wrote while working
for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except night and morning low
clouds. Little temperature change. Lows tonight in mid 40s

Patricia Hearst To Be Indicted?
SAN FRANCISCO — A U.S. attorney said yesterday it is
"entirely possible" that Patricia Hearst now will be indicted
for bank robbery in a Symbionese Liberation Army holdup
here last month.
"It would be entirely possible that a federal grand jury
would return an indictment of Patricia Hearst in the bank
robbery" this week, U.S. Attorney James L. Browning Jr.
told newsmen.
He said the grand jury probing the $10,690 SLA robbery
April 15 of a Hibernia Bank branch and the Hearst
kidnaping will reconvene Thursday.
Sources close to the investigation said Thomas Mathews,
18, of Los Angeles, may be called to testify. Mathews told
authorities he was kidnaped Friday and one captor, a
woman he identified as Patricia Hearst, told him she
willingly took part in the bank robbery. Another
prospective witness was identified as Christine Johnson, 35,
who ran from the Los Angeles house during the Friday
gunbattle in which six SLA figures died.
The grand jury was called "to hear evidence which was
not available last week," Browning said.
He also said that a warrant for Patricia's arrest as a
material witness will not be dismissed since she is wanted
not only as a witness to the bank robbery but also as a
witness to her Feb. 4 kidnaping in Berkeley.
Meanwhile, Los Angeles police and FBI agents pressed
their search for Patricia and two Symbionese Liberation
Army members apparently now her comrades, but officials
acknowledged a growing feeling the fugitives may have fled
the city.
In Hillsborough, Patricia's father said she may have been
brainwashed or the victim of mind control. Both her
parents begged their daughter, described by authorities as
"armed and extremely dangerous," to abandon the SLA
and give herself up.
But Randolph Hearst added: "At this point in time I
don't believe that she will give herself up to come home."
Hearst, editor and president of the San Francisco
Examiner, said he thinks his daughter "honestly believes
now that she's a member of the group. This sort of
brainwashing is not an unheard of thing."
Many persons, including the Hearst family cook, claimed
to have seen the newspaper heiress in locations from Los
Angeles to San Francisco, and authorities were receiving
many crank calls.
"If they've got any sense, they'd have left," said Police
Cmdr. Peter Hagan. "Things are getting hot here."
"Your idea is as good as ours," FBI spokesman John
Morrison said when asked where Patricia might be hiding.
But he added that the focus of the search was still in Los
Angeles.
Police officers in California have the descriptions of
Patricia, 20, and Emily and William Harris, both in their
late 20s, Hagan said. He said more than 100 police officers
and FBI agents were assigned to the case.
Reinecke Blasts Prosecution
SACRAMENTO — California Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke
angrily claimed yesterday he is the victim of a "political
witchhunt" by Watergate prosecutors and would fight on
for the governorship.
"Quitting is not a consideration," Reinecke said after a
federal judge in Washington refused to dismiss the
three-count perjury indictment against him. "I am not
pulling out of the race."
And for the first time, Reinecke launched a personal
attack on his opponent in the June 4 Republican primary,
state Controller Houston I. Flournoy.
Reinecke said he would fight to the wire with his
low-budget campaign while "my opponent bombards the
people of California with his million-dollar advertising
campaign, financed by the special interests of California."
He told a news conference in the Capitol he didn't think
Flournoy, now the frontrunner in the polls, could defeat
either Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr. or
Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti, running first and second in
polls in the Democratic primary to succeed Ronald Reagan.
Reinecke had counted heavily on dismissal of the
charges to get his beleaguered campaign moving again. The
trial now is scheduled to start in Washington July 15. He
also lost a motion to have it moved to California.
Reinecke reiterated that he is "absolutely not guilty"
and said he would prove it this summer.
Reinecke accused the office of Special Watergate
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski of postponing the indictment
against him until it was too late to clear himself before the
primary.
Israel, Syria Near Agreement
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
has completed agreement "for all practical purposes" with
Syrian President Hafez Assad on a disengagement line in the

Golan Heights, a senior American official said last night.
Shuttling back to Israel from Damascus for a late session
with the Israeli negotiating team, Kissinger was said to have
made good progress as well on the delineation of a buffer
zone to be manned by a United Nations force between the
separate armies.
He will return to Damascus today and continue the daily
round trips through the week. He plans to return to
Washington this weekend regardless of whether all points in
the settlement package are resolved, newsmen were told
aboard his plane.
Looking tired before his departure for Israel, Kissinger
said at the Damascus airport he and the Syrians continued
"extensive conversations which as usual were conducted in
a very constructive spirit."
Kissinger's talks with Assad concentrated on thinning
out the opposing armies on the Golan Heights.
The process is expected to occupy several of Kissinger's
daily round of trips from Israel now that he has gained the
tentative acceptance of both sides of a U.S.-proposed
disengagement line.
The secretary of state also worked with Assad and
Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam on getting the line
itself "buttoned up," U.S. officials said.
As the agreement began to take shape, newsmen were
told that the battle zone separating the armies will vary in
depth from less than a half-mile to a little over one mile and
that Kissinger did not anticipate difficulty in arranging an
exchange of prisoners.
Israel has agreed to allow Syrian policemen to re-enter
the towns and villages within the demilitarized zones that
will be yielded to Syrian civilians, these officials said.
Extremists Paralyze Belfast
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Protestant extremists
paralyzed Belfast yesterday by barricading every major road
into the city and vowed they were "ready to die" unless
their demands were met.
Armed paramilitary groups threw up blockades of
hijacked cars, trucks and buses in an effort to increase
pressure on the British government, already burdened by a
six-day strike, to abandon proposals to give the Roman
Catholic minority a share in running the province.
The British Defense Ministry announced it was sending
about 500 British infantrymen into Northern Ireland to
help keep the peace.
A ministry spokesman said the troops "will be in
support of the civilian powers" along with the other 15,500
troops Britain normally keeps in Northern Ireland.
The only traffic allowed into Belfast yesterday was food
and milk trucks. British army patrols were stopped. Fist
fights broke out around several barricades.
Protestant extremists declared South Belfast, with a
population of more than 60,000, off limits to British
troops.
The strike appeared almost 100 percent effective. Most
shops, offices and factories were closed and Belfast's
shipyard, it's biggest employer, was at a standstill.
Attempts by labor union leaders to mediate appeared
doomed. The Protestant militants said they would not talk
with Len Murray, secretary general of Britain's powerful
Trades Union Congress, who flew to Belfast yesterday.
Nixon Backs Health Insurance Bill
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. — President Nixon appealed
yesterday for swift passage of a national health insurance
plan to make quality care within reach of every American
while maintaining the private medical system.
Nixon said in a radio address the issue has grown more
urgent because of projections that doctor bills may climb
22 percent this year due to the end of price controls.
The President, winding up a four-day weekend in Florida
and the Bahamas, indicated a willingness to compromise

depth from less than a half-mile to a little over one mile and
that Kissinger did not anticipate difficulty in arranging an
exchange of prisoners.
Israel has agreed to allow Syrian policemen to re-enter
the towns and villages within the demilitarized zones that
will be yielded to Syrian civilians, these officials said.
Extremists Paralyze Belfast
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Protestant extremists
paralyzed Belfast yesterday by barricading every major road
into the city and vowed they were "ready to die" unless
their demands were met.
Armed paramilitary groups threw up blockades of
hijacked cars, trucks and buses in an effort to increase
pressure on the British government, already burdened by a
six-day strike, to abandon proposals to give the Roman
Catholic minority a share in running the province.
The British Defense Ministry announced it was sending
about 500 British infantrymen into Northern Ireland to
help keep the peace.
A ministry spokesman said the troops "will be in
support of the civilian powers" along with the other 15,500
troops Britain normally keeps in Northern Ireland.
The only traffic allowed into Belfast yesterday was food
and milk trucks. British army patrols were stopped. Fist
fights broke out around several barricades.
Protestant extremists declared South Belfast, with a
population of more than 60,000, off limits to British
troops.
The strike appeared almost 100 percent effective. Most
shops, offices and factories were closed and Belfast's
shipyard, it's biggest employer, was at a standstill.
Attempts by labor union leaders to mediate appeared
doomed. The Protestant militants said they would not talk
with Len Murray, secretary general of Britain's powerful
Trades Union Congress, who flew to Belfast yesterday.
Nixon Backs Health Insurance Bill
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. — President Nixon appealed
yesterday for swift passage of a national health insurance
plan to make quality care within reach of every American
while maintaining the private medical system.
Nixon said in a radio address the issue has grown more
urgent because of projections that doctor bills may climb
22 percent this year due to the end of price controls.
The President, winding up a four-day weekend in Florida
and the Bahamas, indicated a willingness to compromise
with alternative plans now before Congress so long as it
would not "violate the basic principles of our proposals."
He complained, however, that two competing
Democratic proposals would rely too heavily on
government management. He insisted that any compromise
include a patient's freedom to choose his own physician,
and that it be founded on the existing private health care
system.
He said 1974 can and should be the year for legislation
to insure that "every American has financial access to high
quality health care."
He warned that the end of wage-price controls has raised
the possibility "of an unbridled increase" in medical costs.
Nixon urged the private health industry to do everything
it can voluntarily "to keep the brake on rising health care
costs."
"But voluntary restraints will not be enough," he said.
"We must have legislation."
Senate Passes Education Bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate passed yesterday a

$24-billion education bill to extend the government's
school aid programs another four years while retaining the
authority of the federal courts to pursue desegregation
through busing.
The measure, which now goes to a conference with the
House, modifies many of the programs, including a cutback
of the amounts which schools may ask from the
government for programs aimed at underprivileged children.
The Senate's vote was 81 to five.
The bill exceeds the amounts sought by President Nixon,
who also objects on grounds that much of the money is not
left to local discretion as to spending purposes. He has
threatened a veto unless the bill is changed more to his
liking in conference.
Earlier, the Senate passed a belt-tightening $980 million
authorization for the State Department's operations for the
fiscal year beginning July 1.
The measure requires a two percent personnel cut and
includes a requirement that the secretary of state submit a
plan for phased reduction of U.S. aid to South Vietnam.
The House, meanwhile, opened debate on a $22.6 billion
military procurement authorization, with the biggest fight
expected to come on a move to cut military aid to South
Vietnam to $900 million. It's now set at $1.4 billion.
Voting is scheduled for today.
Cronkite Defends Reporter
LOS ANGELES — TV newsman Walter Cronkite,
testifying in a small Los Angeles courtroom on behalf of

reporter William Farr, told a judge yesterday that a
reporter's right to keep sources secret "is so fundamental to
our system that I cannot see how our system can function
without it."
Cronkite said he believes that if Farr were forced to
reveal his sources of a controversial Manson trial story "it
would be another nail in the coffin of freedom of speech
and press. It's that serious."
Under biting cross-examination by Deputy County
Counsel William Stewart, Cronkite declared that he believes
a reporter's right is so important that a journalist faced with
jail for refusing to name a source should take the jail
sentence even if it seems like martyrdom to some.
"I should think that any journalist worth his salt would
hold to his confidence," Cronkite said.
The CBS-TV anchorman was one of several top
journalists called by Farr's attorney Mark Hurwitz, in a
crucial hearing which could determine if Farr must return
to jail. Farr, 36, now a reporter for the Los Angeles Times,
has served 46 days in jail in a dispute with the Manson trial
judge, Charles Older, over a story Farr wrote while working
for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except night and morning low
clouds. Little temperature change. Lows tonight in mid 40s
to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in the 60s to low
70s except upper 50s near the coast. Westerly wind 10 to
25 mph.
Patricia Hearst To Be Indicted?
SAN FRANCISCO — A U.S. attorney said yesterday it is
"entirely possible" that Patricia Hearst now will be indicted
for bank robbery in a Symbionese Liberation Army holdup
here last month.
"It would be entirely possible that a federal grand jury
would return an indictment of Patricia Hearst in the bank
robbery" this week, U.S. Attorney James L. Browning Jr.
told newsmen.
He said the grand jury probing the $10,690 SLA robbery
April 15 of a Hibernia Bank branch and the Hearst
kidnaping will reconvene Thursday.
Sources close to the investigation said Thomas Mathews,
18, of Los Angeles, may be called to testify. Mathews told
authorities he was kidnaped Friday and one captor, a
woman he identified as Patricia Hearst, told him she
willingly took part in the bank robbery. Another
prospective witness was identified as Christine Johnson, 35,
who ran from the Los Angeles house during the Friday
gunbattle in which six SLA figures died.
The grand jury was called "to hear evidence which was
not available last week," Browning said.
He also said that a warrant for Patricia's arrest as a
material witness will not be dismissed since she is wanted
not only as a witness to the bank robbery but also as a
witness to her Feb. 4 kidnaping in Berkeley.
Meanwhile, Los Angeles police and FBI agents pressed
their search for Patricia and two Symbionese Liberation
Army members apparently now her comrades, but officials
acknowledged a growing feeling the fugitives may have fled
the city.
In Hillsborough, Patricia's father said she may have been
brainwashed or the victim of mind control. Both her
parents begged their daughter, described by authorities as
"armed and extremely dangerous," to abandon the SLA
and give herself up.
But Randolph Hearst added: "At this point in time I
don't believe that she will give herself up to come home."
Hearst, editor and president of the San Francisco
Examiner, said he thinks his daughter "honestly believes
now that she's a member of the group. This sort of
brainwashing is not an unheard of thing."
Many persons, including the Hearst family cook, claimed
to have seen the newspaper heiress in locations from Los
Angeles to San Francisco, and authorities were receiving
many crank calls.
"If they've got any sense, they'd have left," said Police
Cmdr. Peter Hagan. "Things are getting hot here."
"Your idea is as good as ours," FBI spokesman John
Morrison said when asked where Patricia might be hiding.
But he added that the focus of the search was still in Los
Angeles.
Police officers in California have the descriptions of
Patricia, 20, and Emily and William Harris, both in their
late 20s, Hagan said. He said more than 100 police officers
and FBI agents were assigned to the case.
Reinecke Blasts Prosecution
SACRAMENTO — California Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke
angrily claimed yesterday he is the victim of a "political
witchhunt" by Watergate prosecutors and would fight on
for the governorship.
"Quitting is not a consideration," Reinecke said after a
federal judge in Washington refused to dismiss the
three-count perjury indictment against him. "I am not
pulling out of the race."
And for the first time, Reinecke launched a personal
attack on his opponent in the June 4 Republican primary,
state Controller Houston I. Flournoy.
Reinecke said he would fight to the wire with his
low-budget campaign while "my opponent bombards the
people of California with his million-dollar advertising
campaign, financed by the special interests of California."
He told a news conference in the Capitol he didn't think
Flournoy, now the frontrunner in the polls, could defeat
either Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr. or
Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti, running first and second in
polls in the Democratic primary to succeed Ronald Reagan.
Reinecke had counted heavily on dismissal of the
charges to get his beleaguered campaign moving again. The
trial now is scheduled to start in Washington July 15. He
also lost a motion to have it moved to California.
Reinecke reiterated that he is "absolutely not guilty"
and said he would prove it this summer.
Reinecke accused the office of Special Watergate
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski of postponing the indictment
against him until it was too late to clear himself before the
primary.
Israel, Syria Near Agreement
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
has completed agreement "for all practical purposes" with
Syrian President Hafez Assad on a disengagement line in the

Golan Heights, a senior American official said last night.
Shuttling back to Israel from Damascus for a late session
with the Israeli negotiating team, Kissinger was said to have
made good progress as well on the delineation of a buffer
zone to be manned by a United Nations force between the
separate armies.
He will return to Damascus today and continue the daily
round trips through the week. He plans to return to
Washington this weekend regardless of whether all points in
the settlement package are resolved, newsmen were told
aboard his plane.
Looking tired before his departure for Israel, Kissinger
said at the Damascus airport he and the Syrians continued
"extensive conversations which as usual were conducted in
a very constructive spirit."
Kissinger's talks with Assad concentrated on thinning
out the opposing armies on the Golan Heights.
The process is expected to occupy several of Kissinger's
daily round of trips from Israel now that he has gained the
tentative acceptance of both sides of a U.S.-proposed
disengagement line.
The secretary of state also worked with Assad and
Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam on getting the line
itself "buttoned up," U.S. officials said.
As the agreement began to take shape, newsmen were
told that the battle zone separating the armies will vary in
depth from less than a half-mile to a little over one mile and
that Kissinger did not anticipate difficulty in arranging an
exchange of prisoners.
Israel has agreed to allow Syrian policemen to re-enter

Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti, running first and second in
polls in the Democratic primary to succeed Ronald Reagan.
Reinecke had counted heavily on dismissal of the
charges to get his beleaguered campaign moving again. The
trial now is scheduled to start in Washington July 15. He
also lost a motion to have it moved to California.
Reinecke reiterated that he is "absolutely not guilty"
and said he would prove it this summer.
Reinecke accused the office of Special Watergate
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski of postponing the indictment
against him until it was too late to clear himself before the
primary.
Israel, Syria Near Agreement
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
has completed agreement "for all practical purposes" with
Syrian President Hafez Assad on a disengagement line in the

Golan Heights, a senior American official said last night.
Shuttling back to Israel from Damascus for a late session
with the Israeli negotiating team, Kissinger was said to have
made good progress as well on the delineation of a buffer
zone to be manned by a United Nations force between the
separate armies.
He will return to Damascus today and continue the daily
round trips through the week. He plans to return to
Washington this weekend regardless of whether all points in
the settlement package are resolved, newsmen were told
aboard his plane.
Looking tired before his departure for Israel, Kissinger
said at the Damascus airport he and the Syrians continued
"extensive conversations which as usual were conducted in
a very constructive spirit."
Kissinger's talks with Assad concentrated on thinning
out the opposing armies on the Golan Heights.
The process is expected to occupy several of Kissinger's
daily round of trips from Israel now that he has gained the
tentative acceptance of both sides of a U.S.-proposed
disengagement line.
The secretary of state also worked with Assad and
Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam on getting the line
itself "buttoned up," U.S. officials said.
As the agreement began to take shape, newsmen were
told that the battle zone separating the armies will vary in
depth from less than a half-mile to a little over one mile and
that Kissinger did not anticipate difficulty in arranging an
exchange of prisoners.
Israel has agreed to allow Syrian policemen to re-enter
the towns and villages within the demilitarized zones that
will be yielded to Syrian civilians, these officials said.
Extremists Paralyze Belfast
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Protestant extremists
paralyzed Belfast yesterday by barricading every major road
into the city and vowed they were "ready to die" unless
their demands were met.
Armed paramilitary groups threw up blockades of
hijacked cars, trucks and buses in an effort to increase
pressure on the British government, already burdened by a
six-day strike, to abandon proposals to give the Roman
Catholic minority a share in running the province.
The British Defense Ministry announced it was sending
about 500 British infantrymen into Northern Ireland to
help keep the peace.
A ministry spokesman said the troops "will be in
support of the civilian powers" along with the other 15,500
troops Britain normally keeps in Northern Ireland.
The only traffic allowed into Belfast yesterday was food
and milk trucks. British army patrols were stopped. Fist
fights broke out around several barricades.
Protestant extremists declared South Belfast, with a
population of more than 60,000, off limits to British
troops.
The strike appeared almost 100 percent effective. Most
shops, offices and factories were closed and Belfast's
shipyard, it's biggest employer, was at a standstill.
Attempts by labor union leaders to mediate appeared
doomed. The Protestant militants said they would not talk
with Len Murray, secretary general of Britain's powerful
Trades Union Congress, who flew to Belfast yesterday.
Nixon Backs Health Insurance Bill
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. — President Nixon appealed
yesterday for swift passage of a national health insurance
plan to make quality care within reach of every American
while maintaining the private medical system.
Nixon said in a radio address the issue has grown more
urgent because of projections that doctor bills may climb
22 percent this year due to the end of price controls.
The President, winding up a four-day weekend in Florida
and the Bahamas, indicated a willingness to compromise
with alternative plans now before Congress so long as it
would not "violate the basic principles of our proposals."
He complained, however, that two competing
Democratic proposals would rely too heavily on
government management. He insisted that any compromise
include a patient's freedom to choose his own physician,
and that it be founded on the existing private health care
system.
He said 1974 can and should be the year for legislation
to insure that "every American has financial access to high
quality health care."
He warned that the end of wage-price controls has raised
the possibility "of an unbridled increase" in medical costs.
Nixon urged the private health industry to do everything
it can voluntarily "to keep the brake on rising health care
costs."
"But voluntary restraints will not be enough," he said.
"We must have legislation."
Senate Passes Education Bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate passed yesterday a

$24-billion education bill to extend the government's
school aid programs another four years while retaining the
authority of the federal courts to pursue desegregation
through busing.
The measure, which now goes to a conference with the
House, modifies many of the programs, including a cutback
of the amounts which schools may ask from the
government for programs aimed at underprivileged children.
The Senate's vote was 81 to five.
The bill exceeds the amounts sought by President Nixon,
who also objects on grounds that much of the money is not
left to local discretion as to spending purposes. He has
threatened a veto unless the bill is changed more to his
liking in conference.
Earlier, the Senate passed a belt-tightening $980 million
authorization for the State Department's operations for the
fiscal year beginning July 1.
The measure requires a two percent personnel cut and
includes a requirement that the secretary of state submit a
plan for phased reduction of U.S. aid to South Vietnam.
The House, meanwhile, opened debate on a $22.6 billion
military procurement authorization, with the biggest fight
expected to come on a move to cut military aid to South
Vietnam to $900 million. It's now set at $1.4 billion.
Voting is scheduled for today.
Cronkite Defends Reporter
LOS ANGELES — TV newsman Walter Cronkite,
testifying in a small Los Angeles courtroom on behalf of

reporter William Farr, told a judge yesterday that a
reporter's right to keep sources secret "is so fundamental to
our system that I cannot see how our system can function
without it."
Cronkite said he believes that if Farr were forced to
reveal his sources of a controversial Manson trial story "it
would be another nail in the coffin of freedom of speech
and press. It's that serious."
Under biting cross-examination by Deputy County
Counsel William Stewart, Cronkite declared that he believes
a reporter's right is so important that a journalist faced with
jail for refusing to name a source should take the jail
sentence even if it seems like martyrdom to some.
"I should think that any journalist worth his salt would
hold to his confidence," Cronkite said.
The CBS-TV anchorman was one of several top
journalists called by Farr's attorney Mark Hurwitz, in a
crucial hearing which could determine if Farr must return
to jail. Farr, 36, now a reporter for the Los Angeles Times,
has served 46 days in jail in a dispute with the Manson trial
judge, Charles Older, over a story Farr wrote while working
for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except night and morning low
clouds. Little temperature change. Lows tonight in mid 40s
to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in the 60s to low

25 mph.
Patricia Hearst To Be Indicted?
SAN FRANCISCO — A U.S. attorney said yesterday it is
"entirely possible" that Patricia Hearst now will be indicted
for bank robbery in a Symbionese Liberation Army holdup
here last month.
"It would be entirely possible that a federal grand jury
would return an indictment of Patricia Hearst in the bank
robbery" this week, U.S. Attorney James L. Browning Jr.
told newsmen.
He said the grand jury probing the $10,690 SLA robbery
April 15 of a Hibernia Bank branch and the Hearst
kidnaping will reconvene Thursday.
Sources close to the investigation said Thomas Mathews,
18, of Los Angeles, may be called to testify. Mathews told
authorities he was kidnaped Friday and one captor, a
woman he identified as Patricia Hearst, told him she
willingly took part in the bank robbery. Another
prospective witness was identified as Christine Johnson, 35,
who ran from the Los Angeles house during the Friday
gunbattle in which six SLA figures died.
The grand jury was called "to hear evidence which was
not available last week," Browning said.
He also said that a warrant for Patricia's arrest as a
material witness will not be dismissed since she is wanted
not only as a witness to the bank robbery but also as a
witness to her Feb. 4 kidnaping in Berkeley.
Meanwhile, Los Angeles police and FBI agents pressed
their search for Patricia and two Symbionese Liberation
Army members apparently now her comrades, but officials
acknowledged a growing feeling the fugitives may have fled
the city.
In Hillsborough, Patricia's father said she may have been
brainwashed or the victim of mind control. Both her
parents begged their daughter, described by authorities as
"armed and extremely dangerous," to abandon the SLA
and give herself up.
But Randolph Hearst added: "At this point in time I
don't believe that she will give herself up to come home."
Hearst, editor and president of the San Francisco
Examiner, said he thinks his daughter "honestly believes
now that she's a member of the group. This sort of
brainwashing is not an unheard of thing."
Many persons, including the Hearst family cook, claimed
to have seen the newspaper heiress in locations from Los
Angeles to San Francisco, and authorities were receiving
many crank calls.
"If they've got any sense, they'd have left," said Police
Cmdr. Peter Hagan. "Things are getting hot here."
"Your idea is as good as ours," FBI spokesman John
Morrison said when asked where Patricia might be hiding.
But he added that the focus of the search was still in Los
Angeles.
Police officers in California have the descriptions of
Patricia, 20, and Emily and William Harris, both in their
late 20s, Hagan said. He said more than 100 police officers
and FBI agents were assigned to the case.
Reinecke Blasts Prosecution
SACRAMENTO — California Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke
angrily claimed yesterday he is the victim of a "political
witchhunt" by Watergate prosecutors and would fight on
for the governorship.
"Quitting is not a consideration," Reinecke said after a
federal judge in Washington refused to dismiss the
three-count perjury indictment against him. "I am not
pulling out of the race."
And for the first time, Reinecke launched a personal
attack on his opponent in the June 4 Republican primary,
state Controller Houston I. Flournoy.
Reinecke said he would fight to the wire with his
low-budget campaign while "my opponent bombards the
people of California with his million-dollar advertising
campaign, financed by the special interests of California."
He told a news conference in the Capitol he didn't think
Flournoy, now the frontrunner in the polls, could defeat
either Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr. or
Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti, running first and second in
polls in the Democratic primary to succeed Ronald Reagan.
