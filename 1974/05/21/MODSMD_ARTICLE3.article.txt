# 64 Conversations Sought By May 31
## More Nixon Tapes Ordered 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon was ordered by a federal judge
yesterday to surrender tape recordings
of 64 conversations for use in the
Watergate coverup trial of former top
associates.
After the decision, Special
Watergate Prosecutor Leon Jaworski
revealed that the White House argued
in the course of the proceedings the
prosecutor cannot take the President
to court.
Acceptance of such a claim,
Jaworski told the Senate Judiciary
Committee in a letter, "would make a
farce of the Special Prosecutor's
charter."
In ordering the White House to
produce the tapes by the end of the

month, U.S. District Judge John J.
Sirica declared Jaworski's
"independence has been affirmed and
reaffirmed by the President and his
representatives."
'Intra-Executive Dispute'
When the two sides met privately
with the judge a week ago, Jaworski
said, "White House counsel for the
first time urged the court to quash the
subpoena on the additional ground
that the special prosecutor had no
standing in court because the matter
of his obtaining the tapes in question
involved an intra-executive dispute."
Sirica said he would delay his order
to turn over the tapes upon an appeal.
Presidential counsel James D. St. Clair
confirmed an appeal would be made.
The newly-revealed dispute recahed
a similar situation last October when
Jaworski's predecessor, Archibald Cox,
was fired for refusing to refrain from
further actions against the President in
court. Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson
and Deputy Atty. Gen. William
Ruckelshaus resigned over the matter.
Committee Subpoena?
At the Capitol, House Judiciary
Chairman Peter W. Rodino, D-N.J.,
said his committee would consider
another subpoena of its own if the
White House fails to turn over tapes
involving the ITT and milk price cases.
St. Clair had promised the
impeachment panel an answer by
yesterday, but there was no word of
any such response by the close of the
normal business day.
Rodino said the committee also will
discuss what steps to take if the White
House continues to withhold 11
Watergate-related tapes it already has
subpoenaed.
Sirica Review
As he did last year, in the
celebrated court battle over nine tapes,
Sirica ordered that the 64 recordings
be submitted for his review and
decision on what portions the
President may withhold.
Sirica ordered that the originals of
the tapes be turned over on or before
May 31, and that the White House
then supply an index and analysis
detailing individual claims of

presidential privilege.
Jaworski, in obtaining a court
subpoena for the tapes last month,
said the tapes are needed for the trial
of John N. Mitchell, H.R. Haldeman,
John D. Ehrlichman and four others
charged with conspiracy to block the
Watergate investigation.
Proof Beyond Doubt
"The need for evidence presented
here, is, if anything, more compelling"
than the nine-tapes case last year,
Sirica said. 'The matter has developed
into a criminal trial where the standard
of proof is not simply probable cause
but proof beyond a reasonable
doubt..."
St. Clair, the President's chief
Watergate lawyer, had moved to quash
the subpoena and told newsmen on
May 7 that the President would not
give up any more Watergate tapes
either to Jaworski or to the House
impeachment inquiry.
St. Clair indicated then that the
case would be appealed all the way to
the Supreme Court if necessary.
Some 20 of the conversations
sought by Jaworski were included in
the transcript of presidential
conversations released to the Judiciary
Committee and the public on April 30.
Sirica noted that in those 20
instances Jaworski's claims that
Watergate was discussed "have been
shown accurate without exception."
