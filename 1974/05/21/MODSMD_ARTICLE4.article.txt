# University Seeks Order To Restrain 'Obstruction'
## 
### DON COX 
University attorneys will seek an
expanded temporary restraining order
this morning against "obstructive
picketing," which continued yesterday
despite a court order issued last week.
The new restraining order seeks to
broaden the temporary restraining
order obtained Friday from the Santa
Clara County Superior Court to cover
the entire campus and restrict the
number of pickets at any point of exit
or entry on campus to two persons.
Friday's order was restricted to the
Medical Center and adjoining
construction site.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union pickets yesterday prevented the
entry of a truck into the Medical
Center construction site.
Injunction 'Not Effective'
Legal Adviser to the President
James Siena said last night that the

University had sought the new
injunction "because it would appear
that the one we got Friday was not
effective."
Siena said the first order might have
been interpreted as too vague.
"Perhaps the meaning [of the new
order] will be more plain to the
union," he said.
The University sought the original
order to halt disruptions at the
Medical Center construction site so
that work might continue.
Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) representative Bob
Anderson declined to comment on the
new order. Anderson has been working
with USE, helping to coordinate the
strike. USE is Local 680 of the SEIU.
Everything Possible
Anderson said that current plans
call for doing everything legally
possible to prevent entry of trucks
into the site. He noted that these plans
might be subject to change depending
on the new order.
Vice Provost and Assistant to the
President Robert Rosenzweig said,
"the hope is that people would obey a
lawful order.... I don't think we
should base our actions on an
assumption of what's going to happen
the day after tomorrow."
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said last
night the University "is prepared to
seek enforcement of the order .... I
think primarily it may mean citing the
people for contempt of court."
Rosenzweig said limiting the
number of pickets was "obviously
more readily enforceable" than the
"mass picketing" prohibition
contained in the first order.
Siena said the University has not
yet decided whether to seek contempt
of court action against yesterday
morning's pickets.
Entry Prevented
About 40 pickets gathered in front
of an A Ita Roofing Co. truck
yesterday morning and prevented the
truck's entry into the site.

The driver left after 20 minutes,
saying he did not want anyone to get
hurt as a result of his truck moving
through the pieket line and because he
did not want to be used as a "pawn"
in the dispute.
Siena said that the incident was "a
question of people testing our resolve,
and our resolve is not getting people
cited for contempt or put in jail," but
rather to "restrict picketing in a
manner and fashion which can serve
their needs without interfering" with
vital University functions.
The new injunction sought is
campus-wide in coverage, Siena said,
because "you can't keep running in
and out of the judges' chambers."
"We tried a modest
response .. . and the reaction we got,
at least to our reading, is that some of
the people in the union wanted to
push the situation," he said.
Rosenzweig said the University's
interest was to get a contract with
which both sides can agree.
Jailings Not Wanted
"We don't have any desire to see
anyone go to jail, we don't want to see
anyone get hurt, we don't want to
break the union," he said.
USE and University negotiating
teams met until 10 p.m. last night.
University negotiator Douglas
Barton said that talks centered around
issues of sick leave, vacation and
holidays, and pay for time not
worked.
Barton said the two sides were
"fairly close" on vacation policy, and
in "virtual agreement" on holidays.
Still Far Apart
"We made some progress," Barton
said, but he emphasized the two sides
were still far from final agreement on a
contract.
The two teams are scheduled to
meet again today. USE and the
University have been engaged in
contract negotiations since December.
USE represents 1400 technical,
maintenance and service employees.
The University estimated that
support for the USE strike had
dropped slightly yesterday, as the
strike moved into its second week.
University estimates placed 900
workers off their jobs, down about 50
from the level of last week.
In other developments, Kenneth
Down, manager of Stanford's
instructional TV (ITV) network,
reported an estimated $500 to $1000
in fuses and fuse holders was
systematically stolen from the ITV
equipment, forcing the closing of the
classroom network for the day.
"They took 400-500 fuses from
cameras, control units, classroom TV
monitors and other equipment, but we
could have replaced those fairly easily.
The fuse holders are harder to find,
and we've got people combing the area
for them. We hope to get back on the
air Tuesday [today]," Down said.
Plant Services director Dan
DeYoung said last night that nails had
been thrown in the path of trucks on
Bonair Siding and one truck had four
nails in one of its tires.
DeYoung said plumbing across the
University was continuing to be
sabotaged. He said personnel had been
forced to cut a hole in a wall in
Cubberley and cut a pipe in three
pieces in order to remove the plug in
the pipe.
"We're pretty tired of it,"he said.
"It's affecting a large part of the
community and it's a health hazard."
"I don't see any immediate relief in
sight" from the sabotage, DeYoung
said.
About 1400 students received
rebates averaging $20-$25 yesterday —
some 1275 students had asked for
rebates last Monday. Yesterday's

rebates were valued at about $30,000.
Some 3065 students have meal
plans of some type.
The University Food Service
announced plans to open a third
dining center for students at Florence
Moore Hall today.
A teach-in scheduled for tonight
and sponsored by the Faculty Political
Action Group (FPAG) was postponed
until next week.
The Teach-in, featuring William
Massy and USE President Jim Berk,
was delayed due to a "question of
miscommunication" about the topics
to be discussed, according to Massy.

University attorneys will seek an
expanded temporary restraining order
this morning against "obstructive
picketing," which continued yesterday
despite a court order issued last week.
The new restraining order seeks to
broaden the temporary restraining
order obtained Friday from the Santa
Clara County Superior Court to cover
the entire campus and restrict the
number of pickets at any point of exit
or entry on campus to two persons.
Friday's order was restricted to the
Medical Center and adjoining
construction site.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union pickets yesterday prevented the
entry of a truck into the Medical
Center construction site.
Injunction 'Not Effective'
Legal Adviser to the President
James Siena said last night that the

University had sought the new
injunction "because it would appear
that the one we got Friday was not
effective."
Siena said the first order might have
been interpreted as too vague.
"Perhaps the meaning [of the new
order] will be more plain to the
union," he said.
The University sought the original
order to halt disruptions at the
Medical Center construction site so
that work might continue.
Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) representative Bob
Anderson declined to comment on the
new order. Anderson has been working
with USE, helping to coordinate the
strike. USE is Local 680 of the SEIU.
Everything Possible
Anderson said that current plans
call for doing everything legally
possible to prevent entry of trucks
into the site. He noted that these plans
might be subject to change depending
on the new order.
Vice Provost and Assistant to the
President Robert Rosenzweig said,
"the hope is that people would obey a
lawful order.... I don't think we
should base our actions on an
assumption of what's going to happen
the day after tomorrow."
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said last
night the University "is prepared to
seek enforcement of the order .... I
think primarily it may mean citing the
people for contempt of court."
Rosenzweig said limiting the
number of pickets was "obviously
more readily enforceable" than the
"mass picketing" prohibition
contained in the first order.
Siena said the University has not
yet decided whether to seek contempt
of court action against yesterday
morning's pickets.
Entry Prevented
About 40 pickets gathered in front
of an A Ita Roofing Co. truck
yesterday morning and prevented the
truck's entry into the site.

The driver left after 20 minutes,
saying he did not want anyone to get
hurt as a result of his truck moving
through the pieket line and because he
did not want to be used as a "pawn"
in the dispute.
Siena said that the incident was "a
question of people testing our resolve,
and our resolve is not getting people
cited for contempt or put in jail," but
rather to "restrict picketing in a
manner and fashion which can serve
their needs without interfering" with
vital University functions.
The new injunction sought is
campus-wide in coverage, Siena said,
because "you can't keep running in
and out of the judges' chambers."
"We tried a modest
response .. . and the reaction we got,
at least to our reading, is that some of
the people in the union wanted to
push the situation," he said.
Rosenzweig said the University's
interest was to get a contract with
which both sides can agree.
Jailings Not Wanted
"We don't have any desire to see
anyone go to jail, we don't want to see
anyone get hurt, we don't want to
break the union," he said.
USE and University negotiating
teams met until 10 p.m. last night.
University negotiator Douglas
Barton said that talks centered around
issues of sick leave, vacation and
holidays, and pay for time not
worked.
Barton said the two sides were
"fairly close" on vacation policy, and
in "virtual agreement" on holidays.
Still Far Apart
"We made some progress," Barton
said, but he emphasized the two sides
were still far from final agreement on a
contract.
The two teams are scheduled to
meet again today. USE and the
University have been engaged in
contract negotiations since December.
USE represents 1400 technical,
maintenance and service employees.
The University estimated that
support for the USE strike had
dropped slightly yesterday, as the
strike moved into its second week.
University estimates placed 900
workers off their jobs, down about 50
from the level of last week.
In other developments, Kenneth
Down, manager of Stanford's
instructional TV (ITV) network,
reported an estimated $500 to $1000
in fuses and fuse holders was
systematically stolen from the ITV
equipment, forcing the closing of the
classroom network for the day.
"They took 400-500 fuses from
cameras, control units, classroom TV
monitors and other equipment, but we
could have replaced those fairly easily.
The fuse holders are harder to find,
and we've got people combing the area
for them. We hope to get back on the
air Tuesday [today]," Down said.
Plant Services director Dan
DeYoung said last night that nails had
been thrown in the path of trucks on
Bonair Siding and one truck had four
nails in one of its tires.
DeYoung said plumbing across the
University was continuing to be
sabotaged. He said personnel had been
forced to cut a hole in a wall in
Cubberley and cut a pipe in three
pieces in order to remove the plug in
the pipe.
"We're pretty tired of it,"he said.
"It's affecting a large part of the
community and it's a health hazard."
"I don't see any immediate relief in
sight" from the sabotage, DeYoung
said.
About 1400 students received
rebates averaging $20-$25 yesterday —

About 1400 students received
rebates averaging $20-$25 yesterday —
some 1275 students had asked for
rebates last Monday. Yesterday's

rebates were valued at about $30,000.
Some 3065 students have meal
plans of some type.
The University Food Service
announced plans to open a third
dining center for students at Florence
Moore Hall today.
A teach-in scheduled for tonight
and sponsored by the Faculty Political

to be discussed, according to Massy.
University attorneys will seek an
expanded temporary restraining order
this morning against "obstructive
picketing," which continued yesterday
despite a court order issued last week.
The new restraining order seeks to
broaden the temporary restraining
order obtained Friday from the Santa
Clara County Superior Court to cover
the entire campus and restrict the
number of pickets at any point of exit
or entry on campus to two persons.
Friday's order was restricted to the
Medical Center and adjoining
construction site.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union pickets yesterday prevented the
entry of a truck into the Medical
Center construction site.
Injunction 'Not Effective'
Legal Adviser to the President
James Siena said last night that the

University had sought the new
injunction "because it would appear
that the one we got Friday was not
effective."
Siena said the first order might have
been interpreted as too vague.
"Perhaps the meaning [of the new
order] will be more plain to the
union," he said.
The University sought the original
order to halt disruptions at the
Medical Center construction site so
that work might continue.
Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) representative Bob
Anderson declined to comment on the
new order. Anderson has been working
with USE, helping to coordinate the
strike. USE is Local 680 of the SEIU.
Everything Possible
Anderson said that current plans
call for doing everything legally
possible to prevent entry of trucks
into the site. He noted that these plans
might be subject to change depending
on the new order.
Vice Provost and Assistant to the
President Robert Rosenzweig said,
"the hope is that people would obey a
lawful order.... I don't think we
should base our actions on an
assumption of what's going to happen
the day after tomorrow."
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said last
night the University "is prepared to
seek enforcement of the order .... I
think primarily it may mean citing the
people for contempt of court."
Rosenzweig said limiting the
number of pickets was "obviously
more readily enforceable" than the
"mass picketing" prohibition
contained in the first order.
Siena said the University has not
yet decided whether to seek contempt
of court action against yesterday
morning's pickets.
Entry Prevented
About 40 pickets gathered in front
of an A Ita Roofing Co. truck
yesterday morning and prevented the
truck's entry into the site.

The driver left after 20 minutes,
saying he did not want anyone to get
hurt as a result of his truck moving
through the pieket line and because he
did not want to be used as a "pawn"
in the dispute.
Siena said that the incident was "a
question of people testing our resolve,
and our resolve is not getting people
cited for contempt or put in jail," but
rather to "restrict picketing in a
manner and fashion which can serve
their needs without interfering" with
vital University functions.
The new injunction sought is
campus-wide in coverage, Siena said,
because "you can't keep running in
and out of the judges' chambers."
"We tried a modest
response .. . and the reaction we got,
at least to our reading, is that some of
the people in the union wanted to
push the situation," he said.
Rosenzweig said the University's
interest was to get a contract with
which both sides can agree.
Jailings Not Wanted
"We don't have any desire to see
anyone go to jail, we don't want to see
anyone get hurt, we don't want to
break the union," he said.
USE and University negotiating
teams met until 10 p.m. last night.
University negotiator Douglas
Barton said that talks centered around
issues of sick leave, vacation and
holidays, and pay for time not
worked.
Barton said the two sides were
"fairly close" on vacation policy, and
in "virtual agreement" on holidays.
Still Far Apart
"We made some progress," Barton
said, but he emphasized the two sides
were still far from final agreement on a
contract.
The two teams are scheduled to
meet again today. USE and the
University have been engaged in
contract negotiations since December.
USE represents 1400 technical,
maintenance and service employees.
The University estimated that
support for the USE strike had
dropped slightly yesterday, as the
strike moved into its second week.
University estimates placed 900
workers off their jobs, down about 50
from the level of last week.
In other developments, Kenneth
Down, manager of Stanford's
instructional TV (ITV) network,
reported an estimated $500 to $1000
in fuses and fuse holders was
systematically stolen from the ITV
equipment, forcing the closing of the
classroom network for the day.
"They took 400-500 fuses from
cameras, control units, classroom TV
monitors and other equipment, but we
could have replaced those fairly easily.
The fuse holders are harder to find,
and we've got people combing the area
for them. We hope to get back on the
air Tuesday [today]," Down said.
Plant Services director Dan
DeYoung said last night that nails had
been thrown in the path of trucks on
Bonair Siding and one truck had four
nails in one of its tires.
DeYoung said plumbing across the
University was continuing to be
sabotaged. He said personnel had been
forced to cut a hole in a wall in
Cubberley and cut a pipe in three
pieces in order to remove the plug in
the pipe.
"We're pretty tired of it,"he said.
"It's affecting a large part of the
community and it's a health hazard."
"I don't see any immediate relief in
sight" from the sabotage, DeYoung
said.
