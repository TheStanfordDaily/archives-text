# Arnett: Bill Doesn't Affect Pub
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
A California Assembly committee's
bill tabled last week, which would
have eliminated the ban on package
liquor sales near the University, would
have had no effect on the proposed
on-campus pub if passed, according to
the bill's sponsor, Assemblyman Dixon
Arnett, R-Redwood City.
(Arnett's statement contradicts a
report by the San Francisco Chronicle
last Thursday that the bill "would
have paved the way for a liquor license
on the Stanford University campus.")
The "dry zone" law prohibits
packaged liquor sales, but has no
effect on the sale of liquor to be
consumed inside the place of purchase.
Arnett said, "There's no prohibition in
the law to stop the pub."
At Arnett's request, a member of
the Government Organization
Committee proposed eliminating the
liquor ban immediately, but received
no second. "A bill that doesn't even
get seconded is as dead as a bill can
get," Arnett said.
Package Liquor Ban
The ban on package liquor sales will

thus cease to exist Jan. 1, 1979, in
accordance with the Dymally Act
passed last year by the Legislature.
The 1979 date allows nearby retail
liquor stores to reinvest in closer stores
or phase themselves out, Arnett said.
Arnett said he thinks the ban
should be removed now by means of
his bill, noting that there is no reason
why academic communities should be
excluded from liquor zones.
He called the Dymally Act
hypocritical because the one campus
exempt from its jurisdiction was
UCLA, which is in the district of the
bill's author, State Sen. Mervyn
Dymally, D-Los Angeles.
Arnett also criticized Fred Conti,
deputy division chief of the Northern
California Alcoholic Beverage Control
Commission (ABC), who told the
Stanford Observer in April, "A
university is a place created for
studying, not a place to have drinks."
Arnett said Conti's remarks "were
more attuned to the 17th century than
the present."
Application Next Step
The next step in the campaign to

open a pub here is an application for a
liquor license with the ABC. The
University has not decided whether it
or Guckenheimer Food Services,
holding company for the TDS, Inc.
franchise which may run the pub, will
apply for the license.
Gordon Starr, Tresidder Union
manager, told the Daily both on April
16 and 22 that the application for the
liquor license would come within a
week. Yesterday he said the
application will come in one or two
weeks.
Starr said the University has made
no progress in negotiations with
Guckenheimer over costs and profit
sharing. He declined to give specific
details.
"Frankly, we've been damn busy
with other things," said Dan Williams,
associate dean of student affairs.
Williams said he was still confident the
pub could open Sept. 15.
Once the liquor license request is
submitted, a 45-day waiting period
follows. During this period the
applicant must post a notice of intent
to sell alcoholic beverages.

passed last year by the Legislature.
The 1979 date allows nearby retail
liquor stores to reinvest in closer stores
or phase themselves out, Arnett said.
Arnett said he thinks the ban
should be removed now by means of
his bill, noting that there is no reason
why academic communities should be
excluded from liquor zones.
He called the Dymally Act
hypocritical because the one campus
exempt from its jurisdiction was
UCLA, which is in the district of the
bill's author, State Sen. Mervyn
Dymally, D-Los Angeles.
Arnett also criticized Fred Conti,
deputy division chief of the Northern
California Alcoholic Beverage Control
Commission (ABC), who told the
Stanford Observer in April, "A
university is a place created for
studying, not a place to have drinks."
Arnett said Conti's remarks "were
more attuned to the 17th century than
the present."
Application Next Step
The next step in the campaign to

open a pub here is an application for a
liquor license with the ABC. The
University has not decided whether it
or Guckenheimer Food Services,
holding company for the TDS, Inc.
franchise which may run the pub, will
apply for the license.
Gordon Starr, Tresidder Union
manager, told the Daily both on April
16 and 22 that the application for the
liquor license would come within a
week. Yesterday he said the
application will come in one or two
weeks.
Starr said the University has made
no progress in negotiations with
Guckenheimer over costs and profit
sharing. He declined to give specific
details.
"Frankly, we've been damn busy
with other things," said Dan Williams,
associate dean of student affairs.
Williams said he was still confident the
pub could open Sept. 15.
Once the liquor license request is
submitted, a 45-day waiting period
follows. During this period the
applicant must post a notice of intent
to sell alcoholic beverages.
A California Assembly committee's
bill tabled last week, which would
have eliminated the ban on package
liquor sales near the University, would
have had no effect on the proposed
on-campus pub if passed, according to
the bill's sponsor, Assemblyman Dixon
Arnett, R-Redwood City.
(Arnett's statement contradicts a
report by the San Francisco Chronicle
last Thursday that the bill "would
have paved the way for a liquor license
on the Stanford University campus.")
The "dry zone" law prohibits
packaged liquor sales, but has no
effect on the sale of liquor to be
consumed inside the place of purchase.
Arnett said, "There's no prohibition in
the law to stop the pub."
At Arnett's request, a member of
the Government Organization
Committee proposed eliminating the
liquor ban immediately, but received
no second. "A bill that doesn't even
get seconded is as dead as a bill can
get," Arnett said.
Package Liquor Ban
The ban on package liquor sales will

thus cease to exist Jan. 1, 1979, in
accordance with the Dymally Act
passed last year by the Legislature.
The 1979 date allows nearby retail
liquor stores to reinvest in closer stores
or phase themselves out, Arnett said.
