# Rhodes Stresses 'Independent' Campaign
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Herbert Rhodes claims that Congress needs
to represent all of the American people rather
than special interest groups.
Rhodes says he is running in the Democratic
primary in the 12th Congressional District,
which includes Stanford, because he believes he
is the most "independent" of the four
candidates in the race.
Rhodes, 44, a University employment
representative and East Palo Alto Municipal
Council member, told the Daily last week that
"the best Congresses have been diversified,
including everyone from pea pickers to
attorneys."
Rhodes insists that his lack of political
experience will not hinder him in his campaign.
"1 don't know what makes attorneys better
qualified to serve in public office," he stated.
"The Watergate indictments certainly don't
prove it."
Campus Support
Although Rhodes says he will attract
substantial support on the Stanford campus
because he is well known here, he is not sure
how well he will do against his three opponents
in the June 4 primary.
Charging that all three are representatives of
certain economic interest groups, Rhodes insists
that he is free of commitments to any particular
group.
In his effort to identify "with all the

people," Rhodes emphasized that he will make
no special attempt to appeal to any particular
minority group or special interest such as
women's rights.
Preference An Insult
It would be an insult to give preference to
any one group, Rhodes declared. "Although we
[campaign staff] want to be elected, we will try
to be ourselves.
Nevertheless, Rhodes, who reported an
income last year of $31,200, claims that his
campaign is especially geared to people who
earn less than $15,000 a year.
Political Model
Noting that his political model is former Sen.
Fred Harris, D-Okla., Rhodes said he favors a
wide-reaching series of reforms that would make
the nation more democratic.
As part of this program, he favors abolition
of the oil depletion allowance, rollback of
gasoline prices by the federal government, large
scale reduction in defense spending and
continuation of the volunteer army.
"I am also stressing that local government
can assess the needs of the people better than
anyone else," Rhodes said. "We need more
initiative at the local level. Although some local
authorities may not be responsive to the needs
of the people, most of them are. Overall,
counties, city and local authorities in general
should be given more control over their own
affairs."

Rhodes claims he is emphasizing the need for
revenue sharing more than any of his opponents.
He said that transportation revenue sharing
programs are especially important. Praising the
transit systems of Santa Clara and San Mateo
counties, he noted that more federal funds
should be available to maintain and improve
those systems.
Rhodes said that he probably will not spend
more than $25,000 in his campaign for the
Democratic nomination. He noted that this
would be less than either Larry Spitters or
Thomas Skornia, two of his opponents, will
spend.
Backs Prop. 9
A supporter of Proposition 9, which would
impose limits on campaign spending, Rhodes
conceded that the measure is "a step in the right
direction" but "not a panacea."
Rhodes expressed confidence that he could
defeat J. Gordon Knapp if Knapp won the
Republican primary and said he even could
defeat incumbent Paul N. McCloskey Jr. "Of
course, my chances would be better against
Knapp," he admitted.
Rhodes, a resident of the Palo Alto area for
18 years, ran unsuccessfully for the San Mateo
County Board of Supervisors last year. In his
only other previous try for elective office,
Rhodes finished second in a race for a seat on
the San Mateo County Board of Education.
