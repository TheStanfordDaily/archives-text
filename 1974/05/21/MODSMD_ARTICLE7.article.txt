## On USE Strike 
### 
It's time for the University and the United Stanford
Employees (USE) to get down to business.
As the USE strike enters its ninth day, there are still
major, substantive issues separating the two sides at the
bargaining table. Quite frankly, it seems to us that both sides
are a little too interested in flexing their muscles and not
interested enough in bringing the strike to a speedy
conclusion.
Although negotiations have continued sporadically for
months, we must agree that, given the circumstances, the
strike is not only justified but perhaps inevitable. For years,
the University has slighted many of its workers in its pursuit
of other interests.Today, Stanford is paying the price for its
previous lack of concern; even some University officials have
privately conceded their embarrassment at the low wages
being paid to some workers before the contract talks began.
So far, we have been treated to a scenario familiar from
thousands of other disputes. Labor has put forward out
rageously inflated demands — including a request that the
University boost its payroll nearly 23 percent — and
management has countered with ridiculously low offers — an
average increase of about eight percent for workers who
have not had a raise in nearly two years. Frankly, we — and,
we think, the vast majority of the campus community — are
tired of the posturings on both sides. The union knows, the
University knows, and we all know that this dispute will
only be settled when both sides move towards the middle.
As far as we're concerned, the sooner the better.
Apart from the issues themselves, we think neither side
has conducted itself very admirably during the actual strike.
It took a couple of pickets being bumped by trucks barreling
through the picket lines before the University took steps to
limit the speed of delivery vehicles; similarly, the University
was remiss in not warning its outside suppliers before the
strike to exercise caution.
Neither is the union spotless. It has seemed at times that
President Jim Berk has been more interested in showing off
for his supporters and the media than in conducting a
reasonable strike: we recall particularly his attempt to block
construction at the Carnegie Institute, which is not
connected with Stanford. And we can't escape the suspicion
that some of the union's less responsible sympathizers are
behind the acts of vandalism that seem to have cropped up
in the last nine days.
In any event, we think it's high time that both sides got
serious in arriving at a settlement for the strike. All the
points have been made, all the arguments aired and all the
insults exchanged. Now let's get the damn thing solved.
