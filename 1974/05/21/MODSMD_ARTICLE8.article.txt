On USE Strike
Editor:
First, I would like to make two
points concerning USE's strike:
1) If the workers are underpaid
and are not getting what they're
worth, then why don't they quit
their jobs here and get jobs at
places where they will get the
wages they deserve? The answer
is, either they can't get higher
wages anywhere else, or they can
get higher wages elsewhere, but
prefer to work in this
environment because it has an
aesthetic value (climate,
tranquility, etc.) for them which
exceeds the extra income that
they could be receiving elsewhere.
2) USE has endlessly
maintained that our tuitions
wouldn't be raised in order to
finance higher wages. The fact is,
either our tuitions go up or
programs will have to be cut. So
far, USE has preferred to remain
strangely vague as to which
programs should be cut. The most
specific claim they have made was
that Stanford wastes money on
computer time that is used for
"administration."
Since USE wants to prove that
our tuition doesn't have to be
raised, why don't they prepare a
list of all the programs they
believe are wasting money (in
which they might specify, for
example, what "administration"
stands for) and how much each
program costs? I think they'll find
that there's very little waste.
And finally, many jobs that are
covered by USE require little or

no more training than such jobs as
hashing and work in libraries â€”
which the University fills with
students. Some examples are
cashiers and maintenance, such as
dorm maids.
Why aren't these kinds of jobs
filled by students as well?
Through its scholarships and
work-study programs, the
University has tried to prevent a
student's education from suffering
because of his wealth (or lack of
it). Yet here, the University is
bypassing an opportunity to do
that very thing!

Lagunita Housing
Editor:
It would appear from his letter
(Daily, May 13) that Rory
Mac Lean has completely missed
my point. Perhaps I was just a
step ahead of him in my
reasoning. I had assumed that no
new dormitories could this
summer "be made to magically
appear."
From this premise it seems to
follow that to assign fewer
students to existing residences
than are currently housed in these
residences is a practice deleterious
to the student residence
population as a whole.
Certainly it would be
unfortunate if some Lagunita
residents were deprived of singles,
but is this worse than forcing
others to live off campus?
