# 117 Frosh Show Interest In ROTC
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
The Stanford Committee on ROTC,
a group of students and faculty
members supporting reinstatement of
military training here, last week gave
President Lyman a list of 117
freshmen who indicated they "might
be interested in taking ROTC courses
if they are made available on campus."
In a postal survey of 1500
freshmen, 200 students responded. Of
the 117 who indicated possible
interest in enrolling in ROTC, 34 were
women. "ROTC should be available to
students who want it," 160
respondents indicated, while 40 others
disagreed.
Applied physics graduate student
Robert Barker, who organized the
committee, said the response was
"very much higher than expected. We
thought there might be only about 20
students who would be interested."
The committee asked Lyman to
"immediately reopen negotiations
with the armed services for the
purpose of formulating mutually
acceptable ROTC programs for the
Stanford campus." Committee
members hope a program can be
negotiated and submitted to the
Faculty Senate next fall.
Officials in the President's office
said the committee's request has not
yet been considered.
"Nobody's had a chance to think
about it," Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig said. "We've been sort of
preoccupied with the strike."
"It won't even be discussed until all
the dust settles from the strike and
commencement," presidential assistant
William E. Stone said. "It should come
up from the ooze some time this
summer."
Barker said Lyman's reaction to the
letter was "extremely noncommital."
"We think Lyman has a
responsibility to those 117 students,"
Barker added. "Our next step is to get
him to take a public stand on the
matter."
"I think he has to act," Barker
continued. "The Senate is not going to
deal with the problem unless it's
presented with some concrete
proposal. It's not about to tackle the
whole issue of ROTC starting from
scratch."

In January the Faculty Senate
voted 29 to 12 to postpone
indefinitely consideration of a request
from Barker that it consider initiation
of new ROTC programs.
ROTC was phased out here
beginning in 1970, when the Faculty
Senate closed the program "as
presently constituted" to new
enrollments and barred it from future
academic credit.
Later that year, an advisory
committee supported the Senate's
action, but noted that "universities
and the Defense Department ought to
be able to devise a form of officer
training that a university student
might receive concurrent with his
education .. . but that would not
produce the incompatibilities between
university education and military
training inherent in the present ROTC
concept."
