# More On The Medical Center Linen

Waitzkin, Hankins

Paul Hoffman's letter (Daily, May 20) about
the strike's impact on patient care deserves a
response.
1) Food and safety. USE has interfered
with Stanford vehicles at the Medical Center
— but only after people were hit and injured
by Stanford trucks during peaceful picketing.
Hoffman complains that on Thursday, May
16, USE pickets held up delivery of food to
patients at Hoover Pavilion.
This USE sit-down at the loading dock
was a protest against the injuries of two
people by Stanford trucks driving through
picket lines. A similar sit-down took place on
Friday, May 17, after two more people had
been hurt by trucks.
These sit-downs led to a Stanford policy
that all trucks must stop and proceed slowly
through picket lines to avoid injuries.
Hoffman's complaint about delayed food is
hypocritical. Is Stanford really concerned
about "patient care" when its trucks hit
people who are picketing peacefully and who

have not been ordered to disperse?
Fortunately, no one has been injured
seriously yet. Doctors advising USE have
examined and talked with people who have
been injured. USE will try not to let
patients' food get cold (though in Stanford
University Hospital the food is usually cold
anyway). But USE will not passively permit
its members to be injured by Stanford
vehicles driving through picket lines.
2) Linen. Three days after the strike
began, Peter Carpenter (Assistant Vice
President for Medical Affairs and former
Vietnam pacification expert for the Defense
Department) stated that the linen problem
had been solved: "We have more linen in the
med center than ever before.... We were
smarter than the union" (Daily, May 16).
Since then. Hospital officials have confirmed
that the linen problem has not seriously
affected patient care.
How did Stanford solve its linen problem
so fast? On Monday, May 13, hospital

workers were ordered to sort dirty linen by
hand on the hospital lawn. A doctor advising
USE, concerned about possible health
hazards in linen processing at the Hospital,
notified the Santa Clara Department of Public
Health, which immediately sent an insepctor
to certify health standards.
Two days later Carpenter announced that
the linen problem was solved.
The Medical Center's response to
the public health inspection supports USE's
original position that Stanford has
exaggerated the linen problem from the
beginning.
In conclusion, USE repeats its earlier
position that Stanford can protect patient
care most effectively by responding quickly
to workers' requests for decent wages and
benefits.

Friday, May 17, after two more people had
been hurt by trucks.
These sit-downs led to a Stanford policy
that all trucks must stop and proceed slowly
through picket lines to avoid injuries.
Hoffman's complaint about delayed food is
hypocritical. Is Stanford really concerned
about "patient care" when its trucks hit
people who are picketing peacefully and who

have not been ordered to disperse?
Fortunately, no one has been injured
seriously yet. Doctors advising USE have
examined and talked with people who have
been injured. USE will try not to let
patients' food get cold (though in Stanford
University Hospital the food is usually cold
anyway). But USE will not passively permit
its members to be injured by Stanford
vehicles driving through picket lines.
2) Linen. Three days after the strike
began, Peter Carpenter (Assistant Vice
President for Medical Affairs and former
Vietnam pacification expert for the Defense
Department) stated that the linen problem
had been solved: "We have more linen in the
med center than ever before.... We were
smarter than the union" (Daily, May 16).
Since then. Hospital officials have confirmed
that the linen problem has not seriously
affected patient care.
How did Stanford solve its linen problem
so fast? On Monday, May 13, hospital

workers were ordered to sort dirty linen by
hand on the hospital lawn. A doctor advising
USE, concerned about possible health
hazards in linen processing at the Hospital,
notified the Santa Clara Department of Public
Health, which immediately sent an insepctor
to certify health standards.
Two days later Carpenter announced that
the linen problem was solved.
The Medical Center's response to
the public health inspection supports USE's
original position that Stanford has
exaggerated the linen problem from the
beginning.
In conclusion, USE repeats its earlier
position that Stanford can protect patient
care most effectively by responding quickly
to workers' requests for decent wages and
benefits.

Paul Hoffman's letter (Daily, May 20) about
the strike's impact on patient care deserves a
response.
1) Food and safety. USE has interfered
with Stanford vehicles at the Medical Center
— but only after people were hit and injured
by Stanford trucks during peaceful picketing.
Hoffman complains that on Thursday, May
16, USE pickets held up delivery of food to
patients at Hoover Pavilion.
This USE sit-down at the loading dock
was a protest against the injuries of two
people by Stanford trucks driving through
picket lines. A similar sit-down took place on
Friday, May 17, after two more people had
been hurt by trucks.
These sit-downs led to a Stanford policy
that all trucks must stop and proceed slowly
through picket lines to avoid injuries.
