# Letters: Stipends, Strike And SLA
## 
### 
Graduate Stipends
Editor:
Ann Mueller of the department
of music and R. T. Olszowski of
the department of economics have
both written to me (and the
Daily) indicating that your
support for this year falls short of
$2100 stipend plus tuition, and
that you therefore resent my
recent column in the Daily.
It is true that in 400 words one
cannot accurately describe the full
details of support of all students
in 35 Ph.D. programs in Humanities
and Sciences. So it is good to
amplify by responding to the
questions you raise.
Neither Music nor Economics is
on a Department Fellow's Plan (or
your complaints would not be
occurring). Each has traditionally
demanded a large measure of
autonomy (as well as considerable
quantities of University fellowship
money) in managing support of its
students.
The consequences have been
mainly (1) to have more
variability among stipends in the
department; (2) to have lower
average stipends; and (3) to enable
more students to study for the
Ph.D. in those departments at
Stanford than would be able to
were the stipends uniform.
I should add that some
departments, in consultation with
this office, admit some individual
students with less than standard
support where it is clear that the
student can command other
significant resources toward part
or all of his necessary expenses.
The overriding facts seem to
me to be (1) in Humanities and
Sciences Ph.D. programs we have
a nearly comprehensive program
of four year support, calling for a
very significant input of outright
gift aid; (2) many — perhaps all —
students would be better off with
larger stipends; and (3) the
University will continue to
increase its financial aid to
graduate students — but probably
not by increasing the TA stipend.

I wonder how the students
would feel about closing the
medical school and stopping
research if they had children with
leukemia.
I wonder how the strikers
would feel about stopping linen
deliveries if they, personally, were
to need an emergency operation.

LAPD vs. SLA
Editor:
As I watched the LAPD vs. the
SLA live and in color Friday
night, an uneasy feeling crept over
me. Strangely enough, I almost
hoped the six people in the
burning house would survive,
perhaps even escape.
They can justifiably, I suppose,
be branded murderers and
common criminals. Certainly
there is nothing romantic about
their style of revolutionaryism.
You cannot help, though, but
put yourself in Patty Hearst's
place and wonder whether you
could have been sold on their
views, and would also have joined
them. Was she particularly
vulnerable? Or would it be that
difficult, under those
circumstances, to convince
anyone of liberal sympathies that
the only way to cure social ills is
with a gun?
One wonders whether the SLA,
or that black sect allegedly
responsible for the Zebra killings,
are aberrations of our society, or
merely its natural products.
Certainly, except for Cinque, this
collection of former debutantes,
college graduates and social
workers who came to believe they
were a people's liberation army
did not come from outside the
mainstream of American life —
contrary to what the press would
have you think.
Was it a unique and rare set of
circumstances which led these
individuals to such desperate acts.

or is there more than the most
minute possibility that the
frustrations and hopelessness any
one of us might experience
working for change from within
might point us down a similarly
violent path?
Half of the SLA's membership
may well have been consumed in
that burning Los Angeles house,
to the smug satisfaction of
millions of television viewers, but
whether the SLA was an
improbable collection of nuts, or
something our social system will
continue to spawn regularly,
remains to be seen. If the latter is
true, change is needed if we are to
continue as anything other than a
country at war with itself.

Imagine A City
Editor:
Imagine a city of 12,000
residents. It has another 12,000
commuters who work in its
industries. There's a police
department, a fire department,
public services such as a water
system and a municipal heating
system.
It has its own Post Office and a
number of restaurants. There is a
president who is appointed by a
board of outsiders who are
appointed by themselves and their
predecessors.
This city has a number of
nationally important products. It
has a large administration that
determines all sorts of policy
ranging from land use, through
the treatment of municipal
workers, to the amount of
freedom to be permitted to
community members.
This city is an oligarchy that is
self-perpetuating. Decision making
power is not given to elected
officials. Nor is it given to those
with deep roots in the
community. People are hired to
rule the city by other people who
were once hired to rule the city by

other people who were once hired
to. ...
This city is Stanford.
When will it ever be free?

Meet USE Demands
Editor:
As a graduate student who
takes great pride in the high
academic quality of Stanford
University, I strongly urge that
the University's negotiators most
seriously strive to find ways of
meeting the demands of
the striking USE workers.
I am distressed to learn that
some Stanford workers are being
paid poverty level salaries. A fair
salary, at a level commensurate
with community standards should
be the minimum expectation of
University employees, as should
satisfactory plans for medical care
and retirement pensions.
Although not an issue of the
present strike, the lack of low cost
housing for employees is a
flagrant injustice given the
excellent terms available for both
student and faculty housing on
campus.
Although finding additional
sources of revenue or reallocating
existing funds is a difficult matter
for the University, it cannot be
denied that the University's
resources in land, investments,
and generous contributors are far
superior to those of an individual
employee.
The University's dedication to
excellence in teaching and
research must not be gained
through exploitation of the
workers who carry on the day to
day tasks of maintaining the
physical environment. I urge that
the special talents of. intelligence
and creativity for which this
University is famous be turned
toward finding an immediate
favorable settlement of the
workers' demands for living wages
and benefits.

Meet USE Demands
Editor:
As a graduate student who
takes great pride in the high
academic quality of Stanford
University, I strongly urge that
the University's negotiators most
seriously strive to find ways of
meeting the demands of
the striking USE workers.
I am distressed to learn that
some Stanford workers are being
paid poverty level salaries. A fair
salary, at a level commensurate
with community standards should
be the minimum expectation of
University employees, as should
satisfactory plans for medical care
and retirement pensions.
Although not an issue of the
present strike, the lack of low cost
housing for employees is a
flagrant injustice given the
excellent terms available for both
student and faculty housing on
campus.
Although finding additional
sources of revenue or reallocating
existing funds is a difficult matter
for the University, it cannot be
denied that the University's
resources in land, investments,
and generous contributors are far
superior to those of an individual
employee.
The University's dedication to
excellence in teaching and
research must not be gained
through exploitation of the
workers who carry on the day to
day tasks of maintaining the
physical environment. I urge that
the special talents of. intelligence
and creativity for which this
University is famous be turned
toward finding an immediate
favorable settlement of the
workers' demands for living wages
and benefits.

Graduate Stipends
Editor:
Ann Mueller of the department
of music and R. T. Olszowski of
the department of economics have
both written to me (and the
Daily) indicating that your
support for this year falls short of
$2100 stipend plus tuition, and
that you therefore resent my
recent column in the Daily.
It is true that in 400 words one
cannot accurately describe the full
details of support of all students
in 35 Ph.D. programs in Humanities
and Sciences. So it is good to
amplify by responding to the
questions you raise.
Neither Music nor Economics is
on a Department Fellow's Plan (or
your complaints would not be
occurring). Each has traditionally
demanded a large measure of
autonomy (as well as considerable
quantities of University fellowship
money) in managing support of its
students.
The consequences have been
mainly (1) to have more
variability among stipends in the
department; (2) to have lower
average stipends; and (3) to enable
more students to study for the
Ph.D. in those departments at
Stanford than would be able to
were the stipends uniform.
I should add that some
departments, in consultation with
this office, admit some individual
students with less than standard
support where it is clear that the
student can command other
significant resources toward part
or all of his necessary expenses.
The overriding facts seem to
me to be (1) in Humanities and
Sciences Ph.D. programs we have
a nearly comprehensive program
of four year support, calling for a
very significant input of outright
gift aid; (2) many — perhaps all —
students would be better off with
larger stipends; and (3) the
University will continue to
increase its financial aid to
graduate students — but probably
not by increasing the TA stipend.

LAPD vs. SLA
Editor:
As I watched the LAPD vs. the
SLA live and in color Friday
night, an uneasy feeling crept over
me. Strangely enough, I almost
hoped the six people in the
burning house would survive,
perhaps even escape.
They can justifiably, I suppose,
be branded murderers and
common criminals. Certainly
there is nothing romantic about
their style of revolutionaryism.
You cannot help, though, but
put yourself in Patty Hearst's
place and wonder whether you
could have been sold on their
views, and would also have joined
them. Was she particularly
vulnerable? Or would it be that
difficult, under those
circumstances, to convince
anyone of liberal sympathies that
the only way to cure social ills is
with a gun?
One wonders whether the SLA,
or that black sect allegedly
responsible for the Zebra killings,
are aberrations of our society, or
merely its natural products.
Certainly, except for Cinque, this
collection of former debutantes,
college graduates and social
workers who came to believe they
were a people's liberation army
did not come from outside the
mainstream of American life —
contrary to what the press would
have you think.
Was it a unique and rare set of
circumstances which led these
individuals to such desperate acts.

or is there more than the most
minute possibility that the
frustrations and hopelessness any
one of us might experience
working for change from within
might point us down a similarly
violent path?
Half of the SLA's membership
may well have been consumed in
that burning Los Angeles house,
to the smug satisfaction of
millions of television viewers, but
whether the SLA was an
improbable collection of nuts, or
something our social system will
continue to spawn regularly,
remains to be seen. If the latter is
true, change is needed if we are to
continue as anything other than a
country at war with itself.

Imagine A City
Editor:
Imagine a city of 12,000
residents. It has another 12,000
commuters who work in its
industries. There's a police
department, a fire department,
public services such as a water
system and a municipal heating
system.
It has its own Post Office and a
number of restaurants. There is a
president who is appointed by a
board of outsiders who are
appointed by themselves and their
predecessors.
This city has a number of
nationally important products. It
has a large administration that
determines all sorts of policy
ranging from land use, through
the treatment of municipal
workers, to the amount of
freedom to be permitted to
community members.
This city is an oligarchy that is
self-perpetuating. Decision making
power is not given to elected
officials. Nor is it given to those
with deep roots in the
community. People are hired to
rule the city by other people who
were once hired to rule the city by

other people who were once hired
to. ...

Imagine A City
Editor:
Imagine a city of 12,000
residents. It has another 12,000
commuters who work in its
industries. There's a police
department, a fire department,
public services such as a water
system and a municipal heating
system.
It has its own Post Office and a
number of restaurants. There is a
president who is appointed by a
board of outsiders who are
appointed by themselves and their
predecessors.
This city has a number of
nationally important products. It
has a large administration that
determines all sorts of policy
ranging from land use, through
the treatment of municipal
workers, to the amount of
freedom to be permitted to
community members.
This city is an oligarchy that is
self-perpetuating. Decision making
power is not given to elected
officials. Nor is it given to those
with deep roots in the
community. People are hired to
rule the city by other people who
were once hired to rule the city by

other people who were once hired
to. ...
This city is Stanford.
When will it ever be free?

Meet USE Demands
Editor:
As a graduate student who
takes great pride in the high
academic quality of Stanford
University, I strongly urge that
the University's negotiators most
seriously strive to find ways of
meeting the demands of
the striking USE workers.
I am distressed to learn that
some Stanford workers are being
paid poverty level salaries. A fair
salary, at a level commensurate
with community standards should
be the minimum expectation of
University employees, as should
satisfactory plans for medical care
and retirement pensions.
Although not an issue of the
present strike, the lack of low cost
housing for employees is a
flagrant injustice given the
excellent terms available for both
student and faculty housing on
campus.
Although finding additional
sources of revenue or reallocating
existing funds is a difficult matter
for the University, it cannot be
denied that the University's
resources in land, investments,
and generous contributors are far
superior to those of an individual
employee.
The University's dedication to
excellence in teaching and
research must not be gained
through exploitation of the
workers who carry on the day to
day tasks of maintaining the
physical environment. I urge that
the special talents of. intelligence
and creativity for which this
University is famous be turned
toward finding an immediate
favorable settlement of the
workers' demands for living wages
and benefits.

Graduate Stipends
Editor:
Ann Mueller of the department
of music and R. T. Olszowski of
the department of economics have
both written to me (and the
Daily) indicating that your
support for this year falls short of
$2100 stipend plus tuition, and
that you therefore resent my
recent column in the Daily.
It is true that in 400 words one
cannot accurately describe the full
details of support of all students
in 35 Ph.D. programs in Humanities
and Sciences. So it is good to
amplify by responding to the
questions you raise.
Neither Music nor Economics is
on a Department Fellow's Plan (or
your complaints would not be
occurring). Each has traditionally
demanded a large measure of
autonomy (as well as considerable
quantities of University fellowship
money) in managing support of its
students.
The consequences have been
mainly (1) to have more
variability among stipends in the
department; (2) to have lower
average stipends; and (3) to enable
more students to study for the
Ph.D. in those departments at
Stanford than would be able to
were the stipends uniform.
I should add that some
departments, in consultation with
this office, admit some individual
students with less than standard
support where it is clear that the
student can command other
significant resources toward part
or all of his necessary expenses.
The overriding facts seem to
me to be (1) in Humanities and
Sciences Ph.D. programs we have
a nearly comprehensive program
of four year support, calling for a
very significant input of outright
gift aid; (2) many — perhaps all —
students would be better off with
larger stipends; and (3) the
University will continue to
increase its financial aid to
graduate students — but probably
not by increasing the TA stipend.

LAPD vs. SLA
Editor:
As I watched the LAPD vs. the
SLA live and in color Friday
night, an uneasy feeling crept over
me. Strangely enough, I almost
hoped the six people in the
burning house would survive,
perhaps even escape.
They can justifiably, I suppose,
be branded murderers and
common criminals. Certainly
there is nothing romantic about
their style of revolutionaryism.
You cannot help, though, but
put yourself in Patty Hearst's
place and wonder whether you
could have been sold on their
views, and would also have joined
them. Was she particularly
vulnerable? Or would it be that
difficult, under those
circumstances, to convince
anyone of liberal sympathies that
the only way to cure social ills is
with a gun?
One wonders whether the SLA,
or that black sect allegedly
responsible for the Zebra killings,
are aberrations of our society, or
merely its natural products.
Certainly, except for Cinque, this
collection of former debutantes,
college graduates and social
workers who came to believe they
were a people's liberation army
did not come from outside the
mainstream of American life —
contrary to what the press would
have you think.
Was it a unique and rare set of
circumstances which led these
individuals to such desperate acts.

or is there more than the most
minute possibility that the
frustrations and hopelessness any
one of us might experience
working for change from within
might point us down a similarly
violent path?
Half of the SLA's membership
may well have been consumed in
that burning Los Angeles house,
to the smug satisfaction of
millions of television viewers, but
whether the SLA was an
improbable collection of nuts, or
something our social system will
continue to spawn regularly,
remains to be seen. If the latter is
true, change is needed if we are to
continue as anything other than a
country at war with itself.
