# Strike And Stupidity
## 
### 
Barry Brinker

Bringing about needed change
often engenders a host of
rhetorical absurdities, misled
idealism, and petrifyingly stupid
excesses. In the wake of the strike
by the United Stanford
Employees, instances of these
unfortunate byproducts have
abounded.
This fact was never so
incandescent as when a group of
some thirty students at Stern Hall
last Saturday night committed, in
their missionary zeal, a series of
imbecilities the like of which one
rarely encounters (stopping
individual student cars, as they
were, by means of such novel and
off-beat methods as throwing
picnic benches under tires). All
this under the pretense of halting
"scabs" and the delivery of
material.
What a scab would be doing
entering a Stern residence hall in
the midnight hours and what
insidious contraband could he be
carrying in sufficient quantities as
to break the back of the USE
strike (in a Volkswagon, no less)
were issues never treated by the
(apparently) self-appointed and
(unquestionably) drunk-on-his-ass
spokesman for "La Huelga," who
could mouth only invective,
parroted rhetoric, and absurdities.
Actions Misdirected
Then, when confronted with
the fact that his monumentally
engaged actions for the strike were
pitifully misdirected — and while
the rest of his group stood well to
the side (embarrassed, one hopes)
holding placards — he could only
summon from what one must
posit as a midget mind and the
behavioral repertoire of an
indulged four-year-old a
counterpoint of cursing and
pounding the fender with his fists.
That this incident concerned,
mainly, the vicious pettiness and
arrant cretinism of an adolescent
in the skin of a Concerned
Student is indisputable, but the
whole group was scarcely less
ludicrous, or disgusting, in their
choices of effort, manner, time
and place.
Many Truths Involved
There are likely many truths in
the issue of the USE strike: I do
not doubt in any way that
Stanford employees have
eminently legitimate complaints,
just as it is probably true that
Stanford does not have sufficient
money to grant quantum leaps
in wages and benefits while
maintaining Stanford students
(and their education) in The
Manner In Which They Have
Become Accustomed. I have,
however, neither the right nor the
temerity to try to impose my
judgment of who is right or wrong
on another, nor should anyone
else.
Ultimately, of course, the
justice of either side's position is
not the point at issue here; rather,
it is a matter of pontification,
gross self-righteousness, and a
boundless and oceanic stupidity.
While fully acknowledging, again,
that this incident was largely a
matter of one mentally
weaponless person rendered,
lamentably, for the moment even
more intellectually-crippled by
Devil Rum, the fact remains that
he came out of a group — perhaps
with good, if deplorably pursued,
intentions — which provided the
needed environment for such
stupidity and, moreover,
condoned this stupidity by its
silence.
Individual Responsibility
Modern history, at least,
should teach that not only must
an individual take complete
responsibility for himself but that
he must also take ultimate
responsibility for any member of
a group to which he belongs (cf.
Germany).
Each individual must realize
for himself that there are no
vacanciesinthe Trinity, nor should
he allow a few crazies in any
group to which he belongs, and
for which he really cares, to labor
under that impression: even the
most sacrosanct of causes in noway
justifies intimidation, gratiutious
hatefulness, or, please God,
self-righteousness.

mainly, the vicious pettiness and
arrant cretinism of an adolescent
in the skin of a Concerned
Student is indisputable, but the
whole group was scarcely less
ludicrous, or disgusting, in their
choices of effort, manner, time
and place.
Many Truths Involved
There are likely many truths in
the issue of the USE strike: I do
not doubt in any way that
Stanford employees have
eminently legitimate complaints,
just as it is probably true that
Stanford does not have sufficient
money to grant quantum leaps
in wages and benefits while
maintaining Stanford students
(and their education) in The
Manner In Which They Have
Become Accustomed. I have,
however, neither the right nor the
temerity to try to impose my
judgment of who is right or wrong
on another, nor should anyone
else.
Ultimately, of course, the
justice of either side's position is
not the point at issue here; rather,
it is a matter of pontification,
gross self-righteousness, and a
boundless and oceanic stupidity.
While fully acknowledging, again,
that this incident was largely a
matter of one mentally
weaponless person rendered,
lamentably, for the moment even
more intellectually-crippled by
Devil Rum, the fact remains that
he came out of a group — perhaps
with good, if deplorably pursued,
intentions — which provided the
needed environment for such
stupidity and, moreover,
condoned this stupidity by its
silence.
Individual Responsibility
Modern history, at least,
should teach that not only must
an individual take complete
responsibility for himself but that
he must also take ultimate
responsibility for any member of
a group to which he belongs (cf.
Germany).
Each individual must realize
for himself that there are no
vacanciesinthe Trinity, nor should
he allow a few crazies in any
group to which he belongs, and
for which he really cares, to labor
under that impression: even the
most sacrosanct of causes in noway
justifies intimidation, gratiutious
hatefulness, or, please God,
self-righteousness.

Bringing about needed change
often engenders a host of
rhetorical absurdities, misled
idealism, and petrifyingly stupid
excesses. In the wake of the strike
by the United Stanford
Employees, instances of these
unfortunate byproducts have
abounded.
This fact was never so
incandescent as when a group of
some thirty students at Stern Hall
last Saturday night committed, in
their missionary zeal, a series of
imbecilities the like of which one
rarely encounters (stopping
individual student cars, as they
were, by means of such novel and
off-beat methods as throwing
picnic benches under tires). All
this under the pretense of halting
"scabs" and the delivery of
material.
What a scab would be doing
entering a Stern residence hall in
the midnight hours and what
insidious contraband could he be
carrying in sufficient quantities as
to break the back of the USE
strike (in a Volkswagon, no less)
were issues never treated by the
(apparently) self-appointed and
(unquestionably) drunk-on-his-ass
spokesman for "La Huelga," who
could mouth only invective,
parroted rhetoric, and absurdities.
Actions Misdirected
Then, when confronted with
the fact that his monumentally
engaged actions for the strike were
pitifully misdirected — and while
the rest of his group stood well to
the side (embarrassed, one hopes)
holding placards — he could only
summon from what one must
posit as a midget mind and the
behavioral repertoire of an
indulged four-year-old a
counterpoint of cursing and
pounding the fender with his fists.
That this incident concerned,
mainly, the vicious pettiness and
arrant cretinism of an adolescent
in the skin of a Concerned

whole group was scarcely less
ludicrous, or disgusting, in their
