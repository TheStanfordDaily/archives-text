# Stanford Saunas Soothe Students
## 
### RAY SQUITIERI 
Finland has five million people
and one million saunas. Stanford
has 11,000 students and two
saunas. But things could be worse.
A year and a half ago it didn't
have any.
When in March last year
residents of ATO discovered three
thousand dollars in left over house
funds, they used some of it to
build Stanford's first sauna. With
less money and more ingenuity,
Lambda Nu was not far behind
with one of its own.
In a sauna, dry heat and bursts
of steam combine to t produce
temperatures usually found only
at the open hearths of steel mills.
Top Billing
Finnish saunas have been
around for at least a thousand
years. They are given top billing in
the Finnish national epic, and
over the years have been used for
a variety of things unrelated to
bathing — drying nets, smoking
meat and worshipping the dead,
to name three. In this country,
sauna (pronounced sow-na) didn't
even get into the dictionaries until
Webster's Third in 1963.
The Finns have attributed to
the sauna power to cure disease
and settle unhappy love affairs.
Easier to verify are their powers
to relax tight muscles and improve
general circulation. "After a sauna
you're mellowed out physically,
but mentally alert," says one ATO
convert" — for about an hour.
Then you sleep like a rock."
Finland's athletes and soldiers
have long credited their heroic
efforts to the healing effects of
the sauna. Paavo Nurmi, Finland's
Babe Ruth of distance running,
finished his workouts with a
sauna. Front-line Finnish troops
in World War II dug saunas out of
the ground between machine gun

placements.
Built In A Day
Stanford's sauna builders had
no such problems. ATO built its
unit for $1200 and one long day
of work. House member Mike
Mensik obtained the lumber and
heater from his father, a
professional sauna builder. A
dozen house members donated
their labor, and ATO had its
sauna.
The finished product measures
six feet wide, eight and a half feet
long, and six and a half feet high.
According to Mensik, the ceiling
should have been seven feet high,
but could not be raised. Since the
builders were also unable to put in
a window, "It's not for
claustrophobics," he says.
Seven or eight bodies is its
normal capacity, though
according to former ATO member
John Alden, the sauna can hold
"nine or 10 if you're friendly."
180 Degrees
ATO's electrically heated rocks
take about an hour to bring the
temperature to the required 180
degrees. Bathers alternate 15
minutes in the heat inside with 15
minutes in the cold outside —
usually in the above ground
swimming pool.
Sauna bathing at ATO has not
been without its trying moments,
as Mensik recalls. At 2 a.m. one
night last week, and after 15
minutes in the heat, he and a
non-ATO friend were ready for a
swim. Mensik went out, leaving
his keys behind in the sauna. His
friend followed, inadvertently
locking the door behind him.
After four minutes in the pool,
Mensik remembers they were
getting cold. When they
discovered they'd been locked
out, "I started cussing him out,"

says Mensik, "telling him to go get
a key. We had no clothes, no
towels — nothing. We werebare
assed naked." Since the friend
wasn't an ATO resident, no one
would have even known who he
was. "That was the funny part,"
Mensik recalls, laughing. "He got
as far as the door of the lounge
and said, 'No way.' Finally
someone upstairs threw us down a
key."
Lambda Nu's Sauna
Lambda Nu's sauna takes three
hours to get hot, lasts only 15
minutes, and exposes its naked
occupants to the stares of curious
passers by. On the other hand, it
cost only $50.
Also built in March of last
year it uses four two-by-fours,
one four-by-four, rope, eye hooks,
a plastic covering called Visqueen,
and real rocks.
Lambda Nu resident Reed
Rubey places the house effort
squarely "in the sauna tradition."
It takes some effort to get it
going, he says, noting that the fire
to heat the rocks must be started
right after dinner to have the
sauna ready by 10 p.m.
'Record is 26'
Into the plastic tent then go
the hot rocks, and 15 to 20
bathers. "The record is 26," notes
Rubey. Because the rocks are only
hot once, sauna seekers can't
come and go, as they can at ATO.
"It gets to be a community
affair," says one house member.
Swimming in Lake Lagunita
usually finishes the evening.
There are disadvantages to this
arrangement, however,
particularly during the dry season,
as one scornful ATO resident
points out: "Some Lambda Nu
guys came into our sauna last fall
and kept telling us how nice their

steam tent by the lake was. 'Then
why aren't you there?' we asked.
'Because first, there's no steam
tent, and second, there's no
lake.' "
Both Lambda Nu and ATO
report occasional security
problems, as their saunas are
nominally restricted to house
members. One former ATO
resident reports entering the sauna
in her bikini to find two "stark
naked dudes'Nvhomshe had never
seen before. One bore a faint
resemblance to Jesus, "at least in
the facial hair." She recalls her
dilemma: "Should I play the part
of the prude and gasp, then exit?
Or should I play cool like the rest
of ATO and stay? I stayed."
A Social Event
While some bathers go it alone,
most capitalize on the
opportunity to socialize. "I
usually go down to the sauna with
a friend or two," reports one ATO
resident. Another says, "It's really
a nice break with people you
don't know very well." All this
makes Stanford's saunas noisier
than their Nordic counterparts,
where the saying is, "Two places
are sacred, the church and the
sauna."
Finnish businessmen
reportedly take their adversaries
to the sauna for, as one tract
reminds them, "Hostility melts in
the steam as stubborn minds begin
to accept compromise. It's hard to
maintain pompous dignity in a
birthday suit." Former ATO
resident John Alden agrees,
remembering that, "It was really
interesting last spring how people
got together spiritually."
Sauna tradition says not to
drink before or during a sauna,

since water loss from sweating
increases alcohol concentration in
the blood. But one ATO member
is not alone when he reports, "I'm
usually pretty wiped out when I
come down here."
Clothes Issue
The ATO sauna touched off a
heated debate last spring over the
issue of clothes. Temperatures
rose with the accompanying
debate over coed bathrooms, but
cooler heads prevailed and a
compromise was reached: those
who wanted to wear clothes in the
sauna did and those who didn't
want to didn't. "The house got to
be a lot friendlier," reports Alden.
Mensik notes that some of the
girls and most of the boys who
use the sauna now do so naked,
adding, "It doesn't seem to be an
issue any more."
With the Lagunita walking path
10 feet from its sauna, Lambda
Nu has had problems, too.
"People sometimes get alarmed,"
notes former resident Carlton
Sexton.
According to Mensik,
hotels in Europe often resolve the
nudity problem with one big
sauna having hours for men,
women, and mixed bathing. In the
Bay Area, he says, the trend for a
while was to one large unit, but
has now swung back to two
smaller ones. This doesn't
necessarily indicate a shift toward
Puritanism, he cautions. "Last
year," says Mensik, "one guy in
San Francisco wanted 50 small
saunas, for a massage parlor. The
deal fell through because he never
got a loan. I guess the banks
realized the business was a little
risky."
