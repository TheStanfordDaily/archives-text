Why can't faculty children use the Stanford tennis courts without
being kicked off? D.M.
Actually, faculty children can use some of the Stanford courts.
The courts across from Encina Gym are open to everyone. The
men's varsity courts next to Maples are open to faculty children if
they play with a faculty card holder, and the courts by the Women's
Gym are not open to faculty children at all.
The receptionist for the PE department explained that there were
restrictions on faculty children's use of the courts because "there is
such tight demand" for the courts and the rules are designed to "give
students and faculty and staff card holders priority."

Where are the on-campus recycling centers for newsprint and
aluminum cans? D.B.
I ve been trying to find out (and have failed) where on campus we
could take bottles and cans to be recycled. P.J.
Escondido Elementary School takes newspapers every third
weekend of the month, and aluminum cans can be recycled right
outside of the bookkeeper's office in the Storke Building.
That doesn't solve the problem of recycling the bottles, but it
seems no one knows if there is an on-campus recucling center for that
sort of thing. (If you do know of an on-campus center that will take
things other than newspaper or aluminum cans, please let Bug know.)
If you can get transportation, you might try the recycling center
run by the Palo Alto Sanitation Co. at the entrance to the city dump.
They will take cardboard, glass, newspaper, magazines, cans, and
anything else that the inspector there approves for recycling.
The center is open from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. Wed.-Sun.
