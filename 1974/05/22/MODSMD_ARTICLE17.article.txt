"Spurts is the toy department of life" - Red Smith, New York Times
Rain or shine, last Sunday I had planned to stay home, drink beer
and thoroughly enjoy watching my beloved Philadelphia Flyers
become the first 1967 NHL expansion team to ever win a Stanley
Cup. Heavenly bliss was to be the order of the day.
We all remember that cliche about the best laid plans etc. But for
journalists in particular, life is about a* predictable ac the weather a
year from today. The unexpected is the expected.
As it turned out Sunday, the Flyers were abcut as far from my
mind as is humanly possible. For the second day in a row Sunday, 50
other newspeople and myself joined in an agonizing vigil with the
Randolph Hearst family in Hillsborough as the incredible weekend of
tragedy involving their daughter and others was unfolding.
It was almost impossible to have any feelings other than those of
deep and overwhelming compassion for the Hearsts and the families of
those six SLA members who died such excruciating deaths Friday
night. Little else could penetrate a person's consciousness.
Insignificance of Sports
But after the situation had returned to some degree of relative
normalcy Monday,it was possible to reflect on the weekend.One thing
in particular stuck out in my mind Monday — how unthinkable it
would have been to have been very concerned about something as
ultimately insignificant as a sporting event amidst all that tragedy.
Yet I am unfortunately aware of the fact that many people are
much too often almost singlehandedly concerned with something that
is relatively inconsequential, especially in times of tragedy. 1
remember vividly the callous cries of outrage when the issue of
cancelling NFL games arose following President Kennedy's
assassination.
1 can remember all the times that auto races have been resumed the
day after a driver was killed because, "he would've wanted it that
way." I can remember the soccer referees who have been killed or
seriously injured by sports fans who held them responsible for a
team's defeat.
These are sad comments about a world where victories and defeats
on athletic fields seem to often be considered more important than
the poverty and violence and injustice we should all be so much more
concerned about.
Proper Perspective
I am not dismissing lightly the role of sports in this society. I
strongly support most athletic programs and feel that the good points
of sports far outweigh the bad. But we must keep sports in its proper
perspective.
Athletics has benefits which go far beyond the obvious physical
fitness ones. Cooperation, endurance of stress, acceptance of defeat,
rapid decision-making and leadership ability are just a few of the
valuable things which can be learned from sports. Competition also has
value, although in many sports, the competitive imperative now seems
to have reached the point of diminishing returns.
But we must never forget that we are dealing with games. Games
are enjoyable for both participants and observers. Games are exciting.
Games are healthy outlets for emotions. But they are, after all, only
games. Some may claim that life itself is a game, but only a fool
would consider sports to be the most important thing in life. True
sports fans should never forget that.

become the first 1967 NHL expansion team to ever win a Stanley
Cup. Heavenly bliss was to be the order of the day.
We all remember that cliche about the best laid plans etc. But for
journalists in particular, life is about a* predictable ac the weather a
year from today. The unexpected is the expected.
As it turned out Sunday, the Flyers were abcut as far from my
mind as is humanly possible. For the second day in a row Sunday, 50
other newspeople and myself joined in an agonizing vigil with the
Randolph Hearst family in Hillsborough as the incredible weekend of
tragedy involving their daughter and others was unfolding.
It was almost impossible to have any feelings other than those of
deep and overwhelming compassion for the Hearsts and the families of
those six SLA members who died such excruciating deaths Friday
night. Little else could penetrate a person's consciousness.
Insignificance of Sports
But after the situation had returned to some degree of relative
normalcy Monday,it was possible to reflect on the weekend.One thing
in particular stuck out in my mind Monday — how unthinkable it
would have been to have been very concerned about something as
ultimately insignificant as a sporting event amidst all that tragedy.
Yet I am unfortunately aware of the fact that many people are
much too often almost singlehandedly concerned with something that
is relatively inconsequential, especially in times of tragedy. 1
remember vividly the callous cries of outrage when the issue of
cancelling NFL games arose following President Kennedy's
assassination.
1 can remember all the times that auto races have been resumed the
day after a driver was killed because, "he would've wanted it that
way." I can remember the soccer referees who have been killed or
seriously injured by sports fans who held them responsible for a
team's defeat.
These are sad comments about a world where victories and defeats
on athletic fields seem to often be considered more important than
the poverty and violence and injustice we should all be so much more
concerned about.
Proper Perspective
I am not dismissing lightly the role of sports in this society. I
strongly support most athletic programs and feel that the good points
of sports far outweigh the bad. But we must keep sports in its proper
perspective.
Athletics has benefits which go far beyond the obvious physical
fitness ones. Cooperation, endurance of stress, acceptance of defeat,
rapid decision-making and leadership ability are just a few of the
valuable things which can be learned from sports. Competition also has
value, although in many sports, the competitive imperative now seems
to have reached the point of diminishing returns.
But we must never forget that we are dealing with games. Games
are enjoyable for both participants and observers. Games are exciting.
Games are healthy outlets for emotions. But they are, after all, only
games. Some may claim that life itself is a game, but only a fool
would consider sports to be the most important thing in life. True
sports fans should never forget that.
