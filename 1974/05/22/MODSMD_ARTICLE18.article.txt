# New League Plan Defeated

### ALEX HULANICKI 
A new baseball conference in
Northern California, proposed by
Stanford head baseball coach Ray
Young, was voted down by the
Pacific Eight athletic directors in
Los Angeles, Young said
yesterday.
Instead, the Pac-8 will continue
to play an 18-game schedule with
playoffs between divisional
champions next year, the same
format used this season. The
conference will be split into two
divisions, the North and the
South. USC, UCLA, California
and Stanford comprise the South
while Oregon, Oregon State,
Washington and Washington State
make up the North.
Young had advocated returning
to a 26-game schedule which
would include interdivisional play.
"I asked the athletic directors for
direction [Friday] for setting up
next year's schedule," said Young.
Young was pushing a new
conference that would dissolve the
Pac-8 Southern Division and align
Stanford and Cal with other
schools in Northern California.
USC and UCLA would probably
form a similar conference in
Southern California. The winners

of the two conferences would
meet to determine the state's
representative to the District
Eight playoffs.
The athletic directors did not
want to break up the Pac-8," said
Young. 'They didn't want to
elevate the other schools to our
status. It was a question of
eligibility, academic requirements
and some other things."
"1 don't like it [the 18-game
format]," he said. "I don't think
it is realistic. It's not a true Pac-8.
We've fought it for four years. It
has become a dead issue."
As a result, Young said that
there was a possibility that
Stanford may eventually pull out
of the Pac-8 in baseball.
Stanford Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz, although he voted in favor
of Young's proposals, said "I
would not support this idea
[pulling out] at the present time.
I would rather keep the integrity
of the Pac-8 intact."
Ruetz did say that he would
support Stanford's exodus from
the conference only when the
other Pac-8 schools agreed to the
move.
Among other matters discussed

at the conference meetings held
from last Wednesday to Monday
the athletic directors:
—discussed technical rules
about eligibility, specifically
transfers from junior colleges;
—set the sites of championship
games for the next two years;
—reviewed next year's
television schedule for basketball,
—changed the Saturday-
Monday scheduling of games at
Washington and Washington State
in basketball to Thursday-Friday;
—assigned tasks to each school
for reports at the conference
meetings in Oregon in August;
—analyzed a proposal to drop
spring football practice and the
possibility of sending the
conference football champion to a
bowl other than the Rose Bowl.
