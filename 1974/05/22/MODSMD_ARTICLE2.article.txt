# Heart Transplant Judge: Victim Was Already Dead

From The Associated Press
OAKLAND — A judge sent the
heart transplant murder trial to a jury
yesterday with instructions that the
victim already was legally dead when
his beating heart was removed for
implanting in another man's chest.
Alameda County Superior Court
•Judge William J. Hayes told the
eight-man, four-woman panel that
Samuel Mitchell Allen Jr., 29, died of
brain damage caused by a gunshot
wound. He said doctors were correct
in pronouncing him dead when his
brain ceased to function.
Andrew D. Lyons, 37, an
automobile polisher, has pleaded
innocent to a charge of murder in
Allen's death. Allen was shot in the
head Sept. 10, 1973, during a struggle
in Lyons' home.
During the trial, Lyons testified he
picked up a loaded gun when Allen
burst into his home and began
fighting. He said the gun discharged
accidentally.
Definition Of Life
Defense attorney John Cruikshank
had claimed a beating heart was the
criterion for life. He based much of his
defense on the argument that Alien
didn't die from the shooting because
his heart was kept beating until it was
removed for the transplant.
After Hayes' instructions,
Cruikshank objected that the judge
was setting a legal precedent by ruling
on the question of brain death versus
heart death which is not covered by
California statute.
"Cause of death of the victim is not
an issue of fact, but is a matter of
law," Hayes told jurors.
"Death is cessation of life," he said.
"A person may be pronounced dead if
based on usual and customary
standards of medical practice it is
determined that the person has
suffered an irreversible cessation of
brain function."
Checked Brain
Doctors at Highland Hospital, where
Allen was taken, checked his brain
activity several times and pronounced
him dead after a third
electroencephalogram at 8 a.m. on
Sept. 12 showed no signs of life.
One of the doctors was Stanford
heart surgeon Norman Shumway, who

assisted in removing Allen's heart. It
was flown by helicopter to Stanford
Medical Center, where it was
implanted into a heart patient.
Shumway testified last Tuesday
that "an individual is dead when his
brain is dead." He said that there was
no question in his mind that Allen was
dead when he helped remove Allen's
heart.
The transplant recipient, Blaine
Wixom, 52, of Salt Lake City,
developed complications and died Oct.
18.
