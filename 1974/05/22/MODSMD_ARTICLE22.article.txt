## Paper Ryun 
### Stan Wilson 
I've always had a suspicion that distance runners
were, well, er, a little different as athletes go. It
takes a certain kind of psyche to force oneself to
run 15 or 20 miles every day. Its the sort of
masochistic mind that would enjoy dong the atusi
on a bed of red hot-coals or streaking through a
blizzard in the Yukon, I imagine.
I'm not a great believer in the old 'don't knock
it 'til you've tried it' axion, but the annual San
Francisco Examiner "Bay-to-Breakers" race
provided an excellent opportunity to gain insight
into the "jogging mentality" which affects large
segments of the American population.
A misguided mass of nearly 6,000 showed up for
last Sunday's grueling race, and like lemmings to
the sea they swarmed 7.8 miles across the San
Francisco peninsula to the icy waters of the Pacific
Ocean.
The eventual winner was 26 year-old Humboldt
State graduate Gary Tuttle of the Beverly Hills
Striders, who finished in 37:07. Put in perspective,
Tuttle suffered some 20 minutes less than 1.
The Stanford community was well represented
in this madness, headed by cross country star Tony
Sandoval, who finished an unofficial fifth in just
under 38 minutes. Football coach George Seifert
finished a respectable 649 th in about 50 minutes,
shaving five minutes off of his time last year.
But most of us were just thankful to finish.
Spartan Program
My Spartan-like training program began nearly a
month before the race, and included a rigorous
schedule of seven or eight miles of roadwork a
week (Jim Ityun runs 15-20 miles a day in the off
season). Observing that distance runners were as a
rule a rather skinny lot, 1 cut my beer and pizza
consumption almost in half, threatening the
economic viability of the Amber Lantern.
By 9 a.m. Sunday several thousand people had
already begun to crowd the starting line, while
hundreds more jammed the restrooms in the YMCA,
or stood nervously in long lines at three
hastily-erected outhouses near the registration
tables.
Arined with my new AAU card and a carefully
forged certificate of health, I strolled towards the
W's table to receive my official race number. I was
relieved to learn that the no. 5,347 carefully
safety-pinned to my chest was issued alphabetically
and not according to predicted order of finish.
Doctors administered last-minute physicals to
those who were looking for an excuse to withdraw
from the competition, and the presence of
ambulances and oxygen masks made me consider
this possibility.
On the streetcorners vendors hawked 'Bay to
Breakers' T-shirts, but I figured I'd look a little
ridiculous being buried with a gaudy likeness of the
Golden Gate Bridge plastered across my chest.
Cardiac Hill
For the uninformed, the race begins on a gradual
ascent up Howard to Ninth Street.The course winds

around to Hayes Street, and there, a short distance
ahead, looms Cardiac Hill, a half-mile cliff which
leaves the uninitiated feeling utterly defeated.
Man> walk this stretch, but Stanford junior
Lynn Mumby utilized a much more novel approach
— she coaxed an unsuspecting bicyclist to tow her
up this stairway to the gods.
It is on this mountain where the crowd finally
begins to thin out. Up to this point people are
continually colliding like billiard balls, and for the
first three hundred yards of the race participants
can go no faster than a brisk walk — a pace which is
quite acceptable to most of the pseudo-joggers like
myself.
This year there was actually a false start, but the
logistics of getting 6.000 people back to their
starting blocks precluded beginning the race again.
Teasing Spectators
For those who survive Cardiac Hill the rest of
the course is relatively easy. It runs along the edge
of the Panhandle through the cool relief of Golden
Gate Park, where picnickers tease semi-conscious
joggers with ice-cold beers and slices of ripe
watermelon.
Perhaps the favorite trick of the sadistic
spectator is the old "pick it up a little — only a half
mile to the finish line." In reality the finish line is
still a painfully long mile and a half away, but being
a naive soul with a diminishing trust in human
nature 1 of course picked up my pace, only to
discover that the checkered flag was nowhere to be
found.
When the realization that I had been duped
finally hit me, 1 nearly lost my meager breakfast.
Some actually did, while others had to be revived
with oxygen.
Senior's Bet
Dan Broderick, Sandoval's former roommate,
was carried across the finish line by three fraternity
brothers. Sandoval had bet Broderick that he
wouldn't finish under 80 minutes, but the 6-6,
230-pound senior made it with two minutes to
spare, with a little help from his friends.
"I followed my race strategy perfectly,"
Broderick said after the race. "My goal was to
finish before the Monday Examiner came out so 1
could see my name in print."
Why do people do this to their bodies? "The
challenge," answered some. 'To keep in shape,"
explained others. "It's a sort of initiation," said
Seifert. "There are so many people running the
race, all suffering together. After the race people
open up and becme friends. You get hooked on it."
Maybe. But I've got a year to kick the habit, and
1 think next year I'll experience the race vicariously
from some vantage point in Golden Gate Park, with
a beer in one hand, and a stopwatch in the other. If
you decide to run next year and some has-been
jogger shouts "A half mile to go — pick it up" — as
you struggle through the park, don't you believe it.
It'll probably be me.

up this stairway to the gods.
It is on this mountain where the crowd finally
begins to thin out. Up to this point people are
continually colliding like billiard balls, and for the
first three hundred yards of the race participants
can go no faster than a brisk walk — a pace which is
quite acceptable to most of the pseudo-joggers like
myself.
This year there was actually a false start, but the
logistics of getting 6.000 people back to their
starting blocks precluded beginning the race again.
Teasing Spectators
For those who survive Cardiac Hill the rest of
the course is relatively easy. It runs along the edge
of the Panhandle through the cool relief of Golden
Gate Park, where picnickers tease semi-conscious
joggers with ice-cold beers and slices of ripe
watermelon.
Perhaps the favorite trick of the sadistic
spectator is the old "pick it up a little — only a half
mile to the finish line." In reality the finish line is
still a painfully long mile and a half away, but being
a naive soul with a diminishing trust in human
nature 1 of course picked up my pace, only to
discover that the checkered flag was nowhere to be
found.
When the realization that I had been duped
finally hit me, 1 nearly lost my meager breakfast.
Some actually did, while others had to be revived
with oxygen.
Senior's Bet
Dan Broderick, Sandoval's former roommate,
was carried across the finish line by three fraternity
brothers. Sandoval had bet Broderick that he
wouldn't finish under 80 minutes, but the 6-6,
230-pound senior made it with two minutes to
spare, with a little help from his friends.
"I followed my race strategy perfectly,"
Broderick said after the race. "My goal was to
finish before the Monday Examiner came out so 1
could see my name in print."
Why do people do this to their bodies? "The
challenge," answered some. 'To keep in shape,"
explained others. "It's a sort of initiation," said
Seifert. "There are so many people running the
race, all suffering together. After the race people
open up and becme friends. You get hooked on it."
Maybe. But I've got a year to kick the habit, and
1 think next year I'll experience the race vicariously
from some vantage point in Golden Gate Park, with
a beer in one hand, and a stopwatch in the other. If
you decide to run next year and some has-been
jogger shouts "A half mile to go — pick it up" — as
you struggle through the park, don't you believe it.
It'll probably be me.
I've always had a suspicion that distance runners
were, well, er, a little different as athletes go. It
takes a certain kind of psyche to force oneself to
run 15 or 20 miles every day. Its the sort of
masochistic mind that would enjoy dong the atusi
on a bed of red hot-coals or streaking through a
blizzard in the Yukon, I imagine.
I'm not a great believer in the old 'don't knock
it 'til you've tried it' axion, but the annual San
Francisco Examiner "Bay-to-Breakers" race
provided an excellent opportunity to gain insight
into the "jogging mentality" which affects large
segments of the American population.
A misguided mass of nearly 6,000 showed up for
last Sunday's grueling race, and like lemmings to
the sea they swarmed 7.8 miles across the San
Francisco peninsula to the icy waters of the Pacific
Ocean.
The eventual winner was 26 year-old Humboldt
State graduate Gary Tuttle of the Beverly Hills
Striders, who finished in 37:07. Put in perspective,
Tuttle suffered some 20 minutes less than 1.
The Stanford community was well represented
in this madness, headed by cross country star Tony
Sandoval, who finished an unofficial fifth in just
under 38 minutes. Football coach George Seifert
finished a respectable 649 th in about 50 minutes,
shaving five minutes off of his time last year.
But most of us were just thankful to finish.
Spartan Program
My Spartan-like training program began nearly a
month before the race, and included a rigorous
schedule of seven or eight miles of roadwork a
week (Jim Ityun runs 15-20 miles a day in the off
season). Observing that distance runners were as a
rule a rather skinny lot, 1 cut my beer and pizza
consumption almost in half, threatening the
economic viability of the Amber Lantern.
By 9 a.m. Sunday several thousand people had
already begun to crowd the starting line, while
hundreds more jammed the restrooms in the YMCA,
or stood nervously in long lines at three
hastily-erected outhouses near the registration
tables.
Arined with my new AAU card and a carefully
forged certificate of health, I strolled towards the
W's table to receive my official race number. I was
relieved to learn that the no. 5,347 carefully
safety-pinned to my chest was issued alphabetically
and not according to predicted order of finish.
Doctors administered last-minute physicals to
those who were looking for an excuse to withdraw
from the competition, and the presence of
ambulances and oxygen masks made me consider
this possibility.
On the streetcorners vendors hawked 'Bay to
Breakers' T-shirts, but I figured I'd look a little
ridiculous being buried with a gaudy likeness of the
Golden Gate Bridge plastered across my chest.
Cardiac Hill
For the uninformed, the race begins on a gradual
ascent up Howard to Ninth Street.The course winds

around to Hayes Street, and there, a short distance
ahead, looms Cardiac Hill, a half-mile cliff which
leaves the uninitiated feeling utterly defeated.

into the "jogging mentality" which affects large
segments of the American population.
A misguided mass of nearly 6,000 showed up for
last Sunday's grueling race, and like lemmings to
the sea they swarmed 7.8 miles across the San
Francisco peninsula to the icy waters of the Pacific
Ocean.
The eventual winner was 26 year-old Humboldt
State graduate Gary Tuttle of the Beverly Hills
Striders, who finished in 37:07. Put in perspective,
Tuttle suffered some 20 minutes less than 1.
The Stanford community was well represented
in this madness, headed by cross country star Tony
Sandoval, who finished an unofficial fifth in just
under 38 minutes. Football coach George Seifert
finished a respectable 649 th in about 50 minutes,
shaving five minutes off of his time last year.
But most of us were just thankful to finish.
Spartan Program
My Spartan-like training program began nearly a
month before the race, and included a rigorous
schedule of seven or eight miles of roadwork a
week (Jim Ityun runs 15-20 miles a day in the off
season). Observing that distance runners were as a
rule a rather skinny lot, 1 cut my beer and pizza
consumption almost in half, threatening the
economic viability of the Amber Lantern.
By 9 a.m. Sunday several thousand people had
already begun to crowd the starting line, while
hundreds more jammed the restrooms in the YMCA,
or stood nervously in long lines at three
hastily-erected outhouses near the registration
tables.
Arined with my new AAU card and a carefully
forged certificate of health, I strolled towards the
W's table to receive my official race number. I was
relieved to learn that the no. 5,347 carefully
safety-pinned to my chest was issued alphabetically
and not according to predicted order of finish.
Doctors administered last-minute physicals to
those who were looking for an excuse to withdraw
from the competition, and the presence of
ambulances and oxygen masks made me consider
this possibility.
On the streetcorners vendors hawked 'Bay to
Breakers' T-shirts, but I figured I'd look a little
ridiculous being buried with a gaudy likeness of the
Golden Gate Bridge plastered across my chest.
Cardiac Hill
For the uninformed, the race begins on a gradual
ascent up Howard to Ninth Street.The course winds

around to Hayes Street, and there, a short distance
ahead, looms Cardiac Hill, a half-mile cliff which
leaves the uninitiated feeling utterly defeated.
Man> walk this stretch, but Stanford junior
Lynn Mumby utilized a much more novel approach
— she coaxed an unsuspecting bicyclist to tow her
up this stairway to the gods.
It is on this mountain where the crowd finally
begins to thin out. Up to this point people are
continually colliding like billiard balls, and for the
first three hundred yards of the race participants
can go no faster than a brisk walk — a pace which is
quite acceptable to most of the pseudo-joggers like
myself.
This year there was actually a false start, but the
logistics of getting 6.000 people back to their
starting blocks precluded beginning the race again.
Teasing Spectators
For those who survive Cardiac Hill the rest of
the course is relatively easy. It runs along the edge
of the Panhandle through the cool relief of Golden
Gate Park, where picnickers tease semi-conscious
joggers with ice-cold beers and slices of ripe
watermelon.
Perhaps the favorite trick of the sadistic
spectator is the old "pick it up a little — only a half
mile to the finish line." In reality the finish line is
still a painfully long mile and a half away, but being
a naive soul with a diminishing trust in human
nature 1 of course picked up my pace, only to
discover that the checkered flag was nowhere to be
found.
When the realization that I had been duped
finally hit me, 1 nearly lost my meager breakfast.
Some actually did, while others had to be revived
with oxygen.
Senior's Bet
Dan Broderick, Sandoval's former roommate,
was carried across the finish line by three fraternity
brothers. Sandoval had bet Broderick that he
wouldn't finish under 80 minutes, but the 6-6,
230-pound senior made it with two minutes to
spare, with a little help from his friends.
"I followed my race strategy perfectly,"
Broderick said after the race. "My goal was to
finish before the Monday Examiner came out so 1
could see my name in print."
Why do people do this to their bodies? "The
challenge," answered some. 'To keep in shape,"
explained others. "It's a sort of initiation," said
Seifert. "There are so many people running the
race, all suffering together. After the race people
open up and becme friends. You get hooked on it."
Maybe. But I've got a year to kick the habit, and
1 think next year I'll experience the race vicariously
from some vantage point in Golden Gate Park, with
a beer in one hand, and a stopwatch in the other. If
you decide to run next year and some has-been
jogger shouts "A half mile to go — pick it up" — as
you struggle through the park, don't you believe it.
It'll probably be me.
I've always had a suspicion that distance runners
were, well, er, a little different as athletes go. It
takes a certain kind of psyche to force oneself to
run 15 or 20 miles every day. Its the sort of
masochistic mind that would enjoy dong the atusi
on a bed of red hot-coals or streaking through a
blizzard in the Yukon, I imagine.
I'm not a great believer in the old 'don't knock
it 'til you've tried it' axion, but the annual San
Francisco Examiner "Bay-to-Breakers" race
provided an excellent opportunity to gain insight
into the "jogging mentality" which affects large
