# Trompas Passes First Test
## 
### 
Aly Trompas passed the first
test in a two-step examination for
the U.S. Open Monday, earning a
sectional qualifying spot in the
local trials at Ford Ord golf course
in Monterey.
Trompas, who shot 80-74—154
on the windswept Fort Ord
layout, finished five shots off the
pace set by mini-tour pro George
Kelley. Trompas, Kelley and nine
other qualifiers advance to the
sectional trials June 4 at San
Francisco Club, where they will
shoot for spots in the Open itself
at Winged Foot Country Club in

Mamaroneck, N.Y. June 13-16.
Several other Stanford
representatives were less fortunate
Monday. Dave Baskins fired
rounds of 77-78 and was involved
in a six-way playoff for five
remaining qualifying spots. He
lost a ball on the first extra hole,
however, and was forced to settle
for a double bogie and the
dubious distinction of first
alternate.
Conrad Nilmeier failed to
qualify on rounds of 78-80—158,
while Stanford assistant pro Ron
Toles carded 86-81—167.
