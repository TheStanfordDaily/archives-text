Magruder Sentenced To Prison
WASHINGTON — Jeb Stuart Magruder,
conceding that "I lost my ethical compass," was
sentenced yesterday to serve at least 10 months in
prison for his major role in the Watergate break-in
and coverup.
Magruder, once the number two man in President
Nixon's re-election campaign and a key figure in
breaking open the Watergate affair, told the
sentencing judge: "My ambition obscured my
judgment."
U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica imposed
a 10 months to four years term on Magruder to be
served at a minimum security institution. Sirica said
he will recommend that Magruder be sent to the
federal facility at Allenwood, Pa., a five-hour drive
from the Washington area for Magruder's wife and
four children.
Magruder, assistant to the President for 1V& years
before taking on the re-election committee job in
May 1971, had pleaded guilty last Aug. 16 to a
single count of conspiracy to intercept
communications, obstruct justice and defraud the
United States.

The charge carried a maximum sentence of five
years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine.
House Committee Hears Tapes
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary
Committee heard two key Watergate tapes
yesterday as President Nixon's attorney indicated
the chief executive will reject a subpoena for more
of them.
Prodded about the impeachment panel's dead
line today for delivery of 11 additional Watergate
recordings, presidential counsel James D. St. Clair
told reporters he knew of "no change" in Nixon's
decision to withhold all such remaining tapes both
from the committee and the special prosecutor's
office.
Apprehension of a new White House
confrontation with the panel was fueled even more
by St. Clair's delay in replying to the committee's
separate request for dozens of tapes relating to the
milk price and ITT cases.
St. Clair had promised some word by Monday.
But Chairman Peter J. Rodino, D-N.J., said St. Clair
had told the committee late yesterday that he still
"has not received instructions from the President"
on the milk and ITT matters.
Committee members spent most of the day
listening to two conversations between Nixon and
former counsel John W. Dean 111, one on March 13,
1973, and the other a week later.
Meanwhile, the Senate Judiciary Committee
announced a special vote of confidence in Special
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski and declared he is within
his authority to pursue the White House tapes
through the courts.
Protestants Shoot At Police
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Militant
Protestants fired on police who attempted to clear
away their street barricades yesterday. They also
punched Britain's top union leader as he led a march
to break the week-old strike that has given the
militants a stranglehold on Northern Ireland.
"We'll shoot you in the back when you come
home tonight," a woman screamed at the marchers.
Most Roman Catholic workers kept to the safety
of their homes.
Gangs of Protestant toughs, swinging cudgels,
roamed the streets. Others cut down trees and
utility poles to strengthen roadblocks paralyzing
traffic into the city.

Food Prices Down
WASHINGTON — Cheaper food slowed the
increase in the cost of living for April to half the
rate of increase recorded in each of the previous
three months, the government announced
yesterday.
The Labor Department said all prices rose
six-tenths of one percent, leaving the cost of living
10.2 percent ahead of where it was a year earlier.
The annual bulge remained the biggest since the
Korean War. The monthly figure compared to 1.1
percent in March, 1.2 percent in February and 1.1
percent in January.
The four-tenths of one percent drop for grocery
store and restaurant prices combined was the largest
in seven years. The decline for grocery store prices
alone was seven-tenths of one percent, meaning a
bag of groceries which cost $16 in March cost
$15.89 in April. Restaurant prices edged upward.
Hearst Faces More Charges
LOS ANGELES — More charges will be filed
today against Patricia Hearst and two comrades,
Dist. Atty. Joseph Busch said yesterday.
Busch would not say what the state charges
would be, but earlier a spokesman said they would
be related to an attempted shoplifting at a suburban
sporting goods store and the trio's alleged
comandeering of four vehicles and kidnaping of two
persons as they made their getaway.
Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Times said a smiling
Patricia claimed she had nothing to do with her own
kidnaping but later joined the Symbionese
Liberation Army because of dissatisfaction with her
father's $2 million food program to free her.
Patricia said she and other SLA members felt
that he had not done everything in his power to get
her back, the Times said.
The newspaper said she made the statements to
Tom Dean Matthews, who identified her as one of
three persons who kidnaped him after the shootout
at a sporting goods store last Thursday.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through Thursday but patches of low
clouds night and morning. Little temperature
change. Low both nights in the mid 40s to low 50s.
High Wednesday and Thursday mostly in the mid
60s to mid 70s except about 60 near the ocean.
Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph in afternoons.
