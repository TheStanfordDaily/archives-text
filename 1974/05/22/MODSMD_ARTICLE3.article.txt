# Restraint Order Revised: USE Picketing Curtailed
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
University attorneys obtained a
revised temporary restraining order
against the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union yesterday
which covers the entire campus, limits
the number of pickets at any point of
exit or entry on campus to two
persons and bars any other pickets
within 50 yards of exits and entrances.
The new restraining order, which
was issued by Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Homer B.
Thompson, went into effect at 3 p.m.
yesterday.
Late in the afternoon only two
pickets marched in front of the
Medical Center construction entrance.
No construction equipment attempted
to enter the building site.
About six pickets remained at the
Medical Center's loading dock, walking

in front of trucks attempting to make
deliveries. However, all drivers
proceeded through the picket lines,
with little delay.
The original restraining order,
obtained last Friday, only covered the
Medical Center, including Hoover
Pavilion, and did not place a limit on
the number of pickets.
Yesterday's Order
Yesterday's order directs
"appropriate law enforcement
officials ... to take such action as may
appear necessary, including but not
limited to arresting violators, in order
to secure full and complete
compliance" with the order. The
original order gave no such direction
to law officers.
Martin Eichner, attorney for USE,
said he didn't think the revised
restraining order was justified. Calling

the order "drastic" he said he didn t
think the University demonstrated the
necessity for such an order.
However, Eichner noted that the
issue will be decided at the preliminary
hearing in which the University must
"show cause" for such an order. The
hearing is scheduled for June 3, but
Eichner said the union is trying to
have it moved up to next Wednesday.
Legal Adviser to the President
James Siena said last night that he
hopes the enforcement of the order
"doesn't come to a matter of police
enforcement." He added that
situations will be dealt with on a "case
by case basis as they arise."
Continue Legal Picketing
Bob Anderson, an organizer from
USE's affiliate, the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU), AFL-CIO,
said yesterday in an interview with
KZSU that the union would "continue
legal picketing."
Anderson vowed that the pickets
would "prevent access of construction
machines" to the hospital location and
would attempt to prevent the
University from conducting business as
usual.
Vice Provost and Assistant to the
President Robert Rosenzweig said the
University feels it is "bound to
enforce" the order. He noted that
since the order directs police
authorities to take action they deem
appropriate, "different jurisdictions
may do it differently."
Pickets Arrested
At the Linear Accelerator (SLAC),
two pickets were arrested in the past
two days. An unidentified USE picket
was arrested Monday night for
blocking a driveway during delivery of
liquid nitrogen.
Michael Camuccio, 25, was arrested
yesterday morning for resisting an
officer.
In another incident at SLAC, a
sheriff's deputy confiscated a powerful
light after a picket allegedly shined it
on a sheriff's helicopter.
Technician's Claim
Arim Wolff, a SLAC electronics
technician, claimed the lamp was being
used to take pictures of a
tractor-trailer loaded with
nitroglycerin, being escorted through
the picket lines by the deputies.
About 330 of the 900 striking
employees normally work at SLAC.
Two of six experiments at SLAC have
been dropped because of the strike.
Negotiations
Negotiations lasted for 12 hours
yesterday with both sides reporting
some progress. Four of nine agenda
items were completed. Yesterday's
negotiations centered upon leaves of
absence for reasons of maternity, jury

duty, voting and bereavement.
University negotiator Douglas
Barton said a resolution on a number
of details was reached, but noted that
the sides were "not at a point where
we're in complete agreement."
Two agreements were reached in
Monday's eight-hour session. One
floating holiday, either an employee's
birthday or another acceptable day,
will be added to the University's
current nine holidays, both sides
agreed.
The University agreed to accept the
union's proposal that an employee
who quits without notice will not be
required to forfeit any accrued
vacation.
Negotiations will continue again
today at 10:30 a.m.
In other incidents, a stink bomb
was reported in the Wilbur Hall Food
Service ventilating system. It was also
reported that someone dumped
manure in Stern Hall dining rooms. In
both cases, many students ate outside,
because of the resulting odors.
In another development, in
response to a request from SEIU
President George Hardy, Kenneth
Moffett, Executive Secretary of the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's
labor-management relations panel, said
his group will investigate the strike and
inform both parties whether it would
intervene in the negotiations.
Tomorrow, a student support strike
rally and march will be held at noon in
White Plaza.

hearing is scheduled for June 3, but
Eichner said the union is trying to
have it moved up to next Wednesday.
Legal Adviser to the President
James Siena said last night that he
hopes the enforcement of the order
"doesn't come to a matter of police
enforcement." He added that
situations will be dealt with on a "case
by case basis as they arise."
Continue Legal Picketing
Bob Anderson, an organizer from
USE's affiliate, the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU), AFL-CIO,
said yesterday in an interview with
KZSU that the union would "continue
legal picketing."
Anderson vowed that the pickets
would "prevent access of construction
machines" to the hospital location and
would attempt to prevent the
University from conducting business as
usual.
Vice Provost and Assistant to the
President Robert Rosenzweig said the
University feels it is "bound to
enforce" the order. He noted that
since the order directs police
authorities to take action they deem
appropriate, "different jurisdictions
may do it differently."
Pickets Arrested
At the Linear Accelerator (SLAC),
two pickets were arrested in the past
two days. An unidentified USE picket
was arrested Monday night for
blocking a driveway during delivery of
liquid nitrogen.
Michael Camuccio, 25, was arrested
yesterday morning for resisting an
officer.
In another incident at SLAC, a
sheriff's deputy confiscated a powerful
light after a picket allegedly shined it
on a sheriff's helicopter.
Technician's Claim
Arim Wolff, a SLAC electronics
technician, claimed the lamp was being
used to take pictures of a
tractor-trailer loaded with
nitroglycerin, being escorted through
the picket lines by the deputies.
About 330 of the 900 striking
employees normally work at SLAC.
Two of six experiments at SLAC have
been dropped because of the strike.
Negotiations
Negotiations lasted for 12 hours
yesterday with both sides reporting
some progress. Four of nine agenda
items were completed. Yesterday's
negotiations centered upon leaves of
absence for reasons of maternity, jury

duty, voting and bereavement.
University negotiator Douglas
Barton said a resolution on a number
of details was reached, but noted that
the sides were "not at a point where
we're in complete agreement."
Two agreements were reached in
Monday's eight-hour session. One
floating holiday, either an employee's
birthday or another acceptable day,
will be added to the University's
current nine holidays, both sides
agreed.
The University agreed to accept the
union's proposal that an employee
who quits without notice will not be
required to forfeit any accrued
vacation.
Negotiations will continue again
today at 10:30 a.m.
In other incidents, a stink bomb
was reported in the Wilbur Hall Food
Service ventilating system. It was also
reported that someone dumped
manure in Stern Hall dining rooms. In
both cases, many students ate outside,
because of the resulting odors.
In another development, in
response to a request from SEIU
President George Hardy, Kenneth
Moffett, Executive Secretary of the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's
labor-management relations panel, said
his group will investigate the strike and
inform both parties whether it would
intervene in the negotiations.
Tomorrow, a student support strike
rally and march will be held at noon in
White Plaza.
University attorneys obtained a
revised temporary restraining order
against the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union yesterday
which covers the entire campus, limits
the number of pickets at any point of
exit or entry on campus to two
persons and bars any other pickets
within 50 yards of exits and entrances.
The new restraining order, which
was issued by Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Homer B.
Thompson, went into effect at 3 p.m.
yesterday.
Late in the afternoon only two
pickets marched in front of the
Medical Center construction entrance.
No construction equipment attempted
to enter the building site.
About six pickets remained at the
Medical Center's loading dock, walking

in front of trucks attempting to make
deliveries. However, all drivers
proceeded through the picket lines,
with little delay.
The original restraining order,
obtained last Friday, only covered the
Medical Center, including Hoover
Pavilion, and did not place a limit on
the number of pickets.
Yesterday's Order
Yesterday's order directs
"appropriate law enforcement
officials ... to take such action as may
appear necessary, including but not
limited to arresting violators, in order
to secure full and complete
compliance" with the order. The
original order gave no such direction
to law officers.
Martin Eichner, attorney for USE,
said he didn't think the revised
restraining order was justified. Calling

the order "drastic" he said he didn t
think the University demonstrated the
necessity for such an order.
However, Eichner noted that the
issue will be decided at the preliminary
hearing in which the University must
"show cause" for such an order. The
hearing is scheduled for June 3, but
Eichner said the union is trying to
have it moved up to next Wednesday.

duty, voting and bereavement.
University negotiator Douglas
Barton said a resolution on a number
of details was reached, but noted that
the sides were "not at a point where
we're in complete agreement."
Two agreements were reached in
Monday's eight-hour session. One
floating holiday, either an employee's
birthday or another acceptable day,
will be added to the University's
current nine holidays, both sides
agreed.
The University agreed to accept the
union's proposal that an employee
who quits without notice will not be
required to forfeit any accrued
vacation.
Negotiations will continue again
today at 10:30 a.m.
In other incidents, a stink bomb
was reported in the Wilbur Hall Food
Service ventilating system. It was also
reported that someone dumped
manure in Stern Hall dining rooms. In
both cases, many students ate outside,
because of the resulting odors.
In another development, in
response to a request from SEIU
President George Hardy, Kenneth
Moffett, Executive Secretary of the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's
labor-management relations panel, said
his group will investigate the strike and
inform both parties whether it would
intervene in the negotiations.
Tomorrow, a student support strike
rally and march will be held at noon in
White Plaza.
University attorneys obtained a
revised temporary restraining order
against the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union yesterday
which covers the entire campus, limits
the number of pickets at any point of
exit or entry on campus to two
persons and bars any other pickets
within 50 yards of exits and entrances.
The new restraining order, which
was issued by Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Homer B.
Thompson, went into effect at 3 p.m.
yesterday.
Late in the afternoon only two
pickets marched in front of the
Medical Center construction entrance.
No construction equipment attempted
to enter the building site.
About six pickets remained at the
Medical Center's loading dock, walking

in front of trucks attempting to make
deliveries. However, all drivers
proceeded through the picket lines,
with little delay.
The original restraining order,
obtained last Friday, only covered the
Medical Center, including Hoover
Pavilion, and did not place a limit on
the number of pickets.
Yesterday's Order
Yesterday's order directs
"appropriate law enforcement
officials ... to take such action as may
appear necessary, including but not
limited to arresting violators, in order
to secure full and complete
compliance" with the order. The
original order gave no such direction
to law officers.
Martin Eichner, attorney for USE,
said he didn't think the revised
restraining order was justified. Calling

the order "drastic" he said he didn t
think the University demonstrated the
necessity for such an order.
However, Eichner noted that the
issue will be decided at the preliminary
hearing in which the University must
"show cause" for such an order. The
hearing is scheduled for June 3, but
Eichner said the union is trying to
have it moved up to next Wednesday.
Legal Adviser to the President
James Siena said last night that he
hopes the enforcement of the order
"doesn't come to a matter of police
enforcement." He added that
situations will be dealt with on a "case
by case basis as they arise."
Continue Legal Picketing
Bob Anderson, an organizer from
USE's affiliate, the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU), AFL-CIO,
said yesterday in an interview with
KZSU that the union would "continue
legal picketing."
Anderson vowed that the pickets
would "prevent access of construction
machines" to the hospital location and
would attempt to prevent the
University from conducting business as
usual.
Vice Provost and Assistant to the
President Robert Rosenzweig said the
University feels it is "bound to
enforce" the order. He noted that
since the order directs police
authorities to take action they deem
appropriate, "different jurisdictions
may do it differently."
Pickets Arrested
At the Linear Accelerator (SLAC),
two pickets were arrested in the past
two days. An unidentified USE picket
was arrested Monday night for
blocking a driveway during delivery of
liquid nitrogen.
Michael Camuccio, 25, was arrested
yesterday morning for resisting an
officer.
In another incident at SLAC, a
sheriff's deputy confiscated a powerful
light after a picket allegedly shined it
on a sheriff's helicopter.
Technician's Claim
Arim Wolff, a SLAC electronics
technician, claimed the lamp was being
used to take pictures of a
tractor-trailer loaded with
nitroglycerin, being escorted through
the picket lines by the deputies.
About 330 of the 900 striking
employees normally work at SLAC.
Two of six experiments at SLAC have
been dropped because of the strike.
