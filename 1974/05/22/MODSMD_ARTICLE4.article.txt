# Shockley Arranging Further Debates
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Electrical Engineering Prof. William
B. Shockley, the Nobel laureate whose
views on genetics created controversy
at several eastern universities recently,
says he is currently trying to
reorganize a series of debates in the
East.
Shockley, who was denied the
opportunity to debate at Yale and was
booed at Princeton, told the Daily in
an interview Monday that he would
welcome the chance to discuss his
views in the East, despite his
unpleasant experiences there.
'The First Amendment sponsors an
arena for the combat of conflicting
ideas," Shockley stated. "This is one
of the best ways of unearthing the
truth or revealing the truth. I take it as
an article of faith that the truth is a
good thing."
Shockley, who claims that blacks
are on the whole genetically inferior to
whites, insists that the government
should encourage people of all races
with low IQ's to be sterilized. He says
the government should consider

paying these people $1000 for every
IQ point below 100 if they consent to
sterilization.
On sabbatical until September,
Shockley said that he is speaking at
colleges regularly and is getting calmer
receptions than he was given at some
of the Ivy League schools.
Other Appearances
He said that he discussed his views
recently at the University of Georgia
and noted he is going to New York
this week "to exchange ideas with"
Prof. Robert Goldby of the University

of Maryland.
Shockley said he is not sure if
public opinion is growing more
amenable to the theories he expounds.
"I know I've been getting more
invitations to speak," he stated.
Shockley said the press is also
becoming more accurate in reporting
his theories, although he noted that
the press has always varied widely in
the degree of objectivity it has
accorded him.
'The personnel of the press is no
more stereotyped than Nobel laureates

are Negroes," he commented.
'Color Coding'
Shockley explained the reason he
believes his views create controversy,
commenting that "the thought of
color coding is so repulsive because it
strikes a blow at man's self esteem as
being the apple of God's eye."
Comparing the reaction of people
to his views with the opposition of
people in other centuries to the views
of Darwin and Galileo, Shockley
stated that "the truth" often offends
people.
Shockley dismissed the views of his
most recent opponent — conservative
editor William F. Buckley — by
claiming his views represent
"humanism gone berserk.
"What he fails to recognize is that
we are now doing things that are
crueler than what nature would do,"
Shockley said. He explained that
improved living conditions for certain
classes of people result in the breeding
of inferior people.
Reports Incorrect
Claiming that most reports of his
theories fail to mention that "the
people who are hurt most" by social
welfare programs and refusal of the
government to encourage sterilization
are infants who are born with "a bad
set of genes," Shockley insisted his
theories are both moral and humane.
Shockley noted his views on black
IQ's have also been distorted. He
explained that many accounts of his
work incorrectly state he has
concluded that 80 percent of the IQ
differences between blacks and whites

reorganize another eastern speaking tour.
is the result of hereditary factors,
while only 20 percent involves
environmental factors.
Shockley said that while it is true
he has concluded IQ differences are
largely the result of heredity, he has
not been able to determine any exact
percentages.
All Not Inferior
He also emphasized that he does
not believe that all blacks are
intellectually inferior to whites. He
acknowledged that many blacks have
high intelligence.
Noting that he respects the
intelligence and integrity of many of
his opponents, Shockley explained
that "one must find a higher principle
[religious scruple] that would make
them so obtuse."
But Shockley noted that atheistic
communists and Marxists also oppose
his theories because of what he called
a misguided egalitarianism.
Genetics Expert
Although Shockley is an electronics
expert and won his Nobel Prize in
phy ics for inventing the junction
transistor, he insisted that he is an
acknowledged expert in genetics
because he has conducted extensive
scientific research in the area.
Shockley said he does not plan to
attempt to persuade the University
administration to allow him to teach a
course in his theories. Last year
Shockley was denied a request to offer
such a course.
Noting that he will turn 65 next
year, Shockley explained that after he
reaches that age, his contract to teach
will be renewed on an annual basis. He
expressed fear that any controversy
regarding the teaching of a course on
his theories might keep him from
being allowed to teach here at all.
Shockley will offer one course next
year in "Topics and Methods In Solid
State Research" for one or two units
by arrangement.
He said he has not noticed that the
size of his classes have changed

because of student opposition to his
theories. "I have no particular theory"
on that subject, he said. "I assiduously
avoid speculation."
Shockley said that any hostility
that may exist toward him in the black
community "certainly hasn't been
apparent lately."
