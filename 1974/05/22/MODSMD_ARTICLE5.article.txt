# P.A. City Council May Be Sued
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Fair Rent Committee in Palo Alto is considering
suing the City Council after the council voted Monday to
oppose a June 4 ballot measure to control rents.
"The council did an outrageous thing," declared Brad
Dowden, committee treasurer. "The idea of an initiative is
to let the people decide what to do. The council should
have not taken any sort of position at all."
Dowden stated that representatives of the Committee —
which is sponsoring the rent control initiative — will meet
today with attorneys from the American Civil Liberties
Union in San Francisco to decide what sort of action
should be taken against the council.
But Dowden speculated that the action of the council
would not significantly change the outcome of the voting
on Measure B, the rent control board initiative.
According to Dowden, the council had no legitimate
reason for publicly opposing the proposed board.
Slow Inflation
"The purpose of the board is to slow rent inflation and
stop the rent gouging of people in Palo Alto, including
many Stanford students who are forced to live off
campus," Dowden explained. "This is in the best interests
of the community."
According to Dowden, the council based its decision to
oppose the rent control board on the "falsehood" that the
board would lead to deterioration of housing and would
drive landlords out of business.
Dowden said that by forcing landlords to make
improvements on their property, the quality of housing in
Palo Alto would rise rather than decline.
He added that the board would allow landlords to make
reasonable profits and would only drive "speculators" from
Palo Alto. Dowden explained that the latter group is
comprised of few people. Hence their absence would not
adversely affect the economy of the city.
Committee's Perogative
Mayor Kirke Comstock told the Daily yesterday that "it
is clearly the perogative" of the committee to sue the

council. But he noted, "I don't think they'll win."
Comstock was one of seven councilmen who voted to
oppose the proposed board. Two members voted against
discussing the issue.
Although Comstock acknowledged that high rents are a
problem for many people in the city, he explained that the
proposed board would not ameliorate the problem.
Comstock attributed high rents partly to inflation,
noting that a rent control board would drive landlords out
of business. He observed that "most Palo Alto landlords are
not profiteers."
"Low and middle income housing would be the first to
go if landlords were forced out of business," Comstock
said.
"Much of the reason why rents may be high in the city is
that there is a high demand and a low supply." Comstock
said this problem could be solved if the federal government
were willing to subsidize more housing projects.
Too Weak
Although Comstock said he is opposed to rent control,
he noted that the particular plan of the committee would
be too weak to be effective.
He noted that the board would be composed of a cross
section of the Palo Alto population and hence "would not
be likely to take a hard line."
Dowden stated that the campaign to establish the board
will be a "tough battle," but he expressed confidence that
the committee would persuade a majority of Palo Altoans
to vote for the board.
Organized Attempts
Dowden said that the action of the council is only the
latest in a series of organized attempts to defeat Measure B.
He accused organized groups of landlords of attempting
to spread lies about the nature of the board in an effort to
defeat it.
"Our stumbling block is money," Dowden concluded.
"These organized interests are sending out a lot of
publicity."

is clearly the perogative" of the committee to sue the

council. But he noted, "I don't think they'll win."
Comstock was one of seven councilmen who voted to
oppose the proposed board. Two members voted against
discussing the issue.
Although Comstock acknowledged that high rents are a
problem for many people in the city, he explained that the
proposed board would not ameliorate the problem.
Comstock attributed high rents partly to inflation,
noting that a rent control board would drive landlords out
of business. He observed that "most Palo Alto landlords are
not profiteers."
"Low and middle income housing would be the first to
go if landlords were forced out of business," Comstock
said.
"Much of the reason why rents may be high in the city is
that there is a high demand and a low supply." Comstock
said this problem could be solved if the federal government
were willing to subsidize more housing projects.
Too Weak
Although Comstock said he is opposed to rent control,
he noted that the particular plan of the committee would
be too weak to be effective.
He noted that the board would be composed of a cross
section of the Palo Alto population and hence "would not
be likely to take a hard line."
Dowden stated that the campaign to establish the board
will be a "tough battle," but he expressed confidence that
the committee would persuade a majority of Palo Altoans
to vote for the board.
Organized Attempts
Dowden said that the action of the council is only the
latest in a series of organized attempts to defeat Measure B.
He accused organized groups of landlords of attempting
to spread lies about the nature of the board in an effort to
defeat it.
"Our stumbling block is money," Dowden concluded.
"These organized interests are sending out a lot of
publicity."
The Fair Rent Committee in Palo Alto is considering
suing the City Council after the council voted Monday to
oppose a June 4 ballot measure to control rents.
"The council did an outrageous thing," declared Brad
Dowden, committee treasurer. "The idea of an initiative is
to let the people decide what to do. The council should
have not taken any sort of position at all."
Dowden stated that representatives of the Committee —
which is sponsoring the rent control initiative — will meet
today with attorneys from the American Civil Liberties
Union in San Francisco to decide what sort of action
should be taken against the council.
But Dowden speculated that the action of the council
would not significantly change the outcome of the voting
on Measure B, the rent control board initiative.
According to Dowden, the council had no legitimate
reason for publicly opposing the proposed board.
Slow Inflation
"The purpose of the board is to slow rent inflation and
stop the rent gouging of people in Palo Alto, including
many Stanford students who are forced to live off
campus," Dowden explained. "This is in the best interests
of the community."
According to Dowden, the council based its decision to
oppose the rent control board on the "falsehood" that the
board would lead to deterioration of housing and would
drive landlords out of business.
Dowden said that by forcing landlords to make
improvements on their property, the quality of housing in
Palo Alto would rise rather than decline.
He added that the board would allow landlords to make
reasonable profits and would only drive "speculators" from
Palo Alto. Dowden explained that the latter group is
comprised of few people. Hence their absence would not
adversely affect the economy of the city.
