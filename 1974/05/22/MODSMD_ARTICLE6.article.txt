# Campaign Head Reviews McGovern's 1972 Effort

"Any Democrat lost the
[presidential] election when George
Wallace was shot," Gary Hart,
National Campaign Director for
George McGovern in 1972, told a
group of students in Trancos lounge
last night.
Hart's appearance was sponsored by
SWOPSI 193.
Hart, now running for the Senate in
Colorado, discussed some of the
shortcomings of the McGovern
candidacy, but stressed that there were
many positive aspects of the campaign.
The legacy of the campaign, he said,
was that "you can be a relatively
'unknown'. .. and still receive the
nomination of the party, in this case
the Democratic party."
One of the problems in
understanding the 1972 campaign,
Hart added, is that people tend to
think of it in terms of the general
election, from August to November,
while the McGovern ticket faced two
campaigns, the nomination race, and
the campaign race. The nomination
campaign lasted from 2 to 2V2 years,
most of which, according to Hart, was
run on minimal funds.
Hart said that many of the
problems incurred by the McGovern
candidacy rested in McGovern's
tendency to answer every question put
to him. "With an extremely candid
man you have to keep him from
making statements not entirely based
on facts... but it didn't always
work," noted Hart.
Criticize Press
Hart critictzed the national
coverage of the McGovern campaign
by the press, who, he pointed out,
were more concerned with how the

members of the McGovern campaign
committee were getting along with one
another than with the major questions,
including Watergate.
Much of Hart's talk centered
around the "Eagleton Affair," which
he said was marked by confusion and
lack of communication within the
McGovern campaign committee. One
question, however, that Hart thinks
should be asked now is "why Nixon
didn't check Agnew out."
In his own campaign, Hart is
running ahead of the six other
Democratic candidates in Colorado,
and expects to win the party primary
in September.
