Congressional primary elections are a scant two weeks
away. This year's lists in the twelfth district, which includes
Stanford and Palo Alto, offer sufficient variety to entice
even Watergate-jaded citizens to the polls.
For the Republican congressional nomination, the Daily
strongly endorses Congressman Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey
Jr., the incumbent. McCloskey is a man of fiercely
demonstrated integrity, independence, and courage. Those
are rare words in this sorry time; they apply to Pete
McCloskey as to few others in Congress.
McCloskey publicly proposed that Congress consider
impeaching Ricnard Nixon before it was popular to do so.
McCloskey was deeply concerned about protection of the
natural environment before it was popular to be so
concerned. McCloskey opposed the war in Vietnam before it
was popular to do so, and we believe him more likely than
his opponent to oppose the next such war.
Pete McCloskey is an asset to his party and to the
Congress. He is fighting for his seat against an opponent of
considerably less stature. We believe he deserves a
resounding victory.
The Democratic field provides a less clear choice.
The Daily endorses Palo Alto attorney Thomas Skornia.
Skornia's campaign has emphasized the need for a
coherent attack on inflation and unemployment, public
financing of campaigns, the restoration of Congress' proper
power, and a greater commitment to women's rights. We
share his concerns, and we recommend him as the best
choice in an undistinguished Democratic field.
