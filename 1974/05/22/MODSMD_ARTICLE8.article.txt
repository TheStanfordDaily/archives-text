Rep. Paul McCloskey, R—Menlo Park, has been very outspoken
about Watergate and the excesses of executive power, the actions
done to protect the Presidency, alleged pay-offs, campaign
contributions by trustees and other actions. He has been held up by
supporters as an example of what type of person should be in
Congress or in the Presidency. Possibly so.
However, Pete also has supporters who believe that illegal actions
or acts that are a bit outside of the spirit of the law in the support of
something "good and true" are acceptable.
You can do anything that you wish as long as "everybody else is
doing the same thing" or "I'm really dedicated to this ideal and this
action is OK because of the good that will occur."
The University has a rule that signs should not be placed on walls,
columns, doors, etc. Some expense has been incurred to put up kiosks
and bulletin boards. These areas are apparently not prominent enough
for McCloskey supporters so we were greeted with McCloskey signs on
the Mem Claw wall and the planters at Engineering Corner and TMU.
'Very Important'
When asked to take the signs down, excuses were given that it's
very important that people see this and sign-up to register Republican.
"We know that the signs don't belong here — either aesthetically or
legally — but it's important."
It's also true that Hunt and Liddy are now serving jail terms for
doing what someone thought had to be done because "it's important
and when people see the results of these actions it will be readily
accepted. Besides we're not the only ones doing it."
Both actions are essentially the same, both are wrong, both were
done with the best of intentions by dedicated people, and both really
have little impact on any of our everyday lives. The U.S. would be a
better place if there were no Watergate-type actions and Stanford
would be a better place without all of the "very important" signs
taped all over the campus — most announcing something that was held
three weeks ago.
Which More Serious
It may be stated that one action is much more serious than the
other. However, the great Albanian philosopher, Haggard the
Munificent in his widely acclaimed treatise "Reconciling
Marxist-Leninist Revisionist Theory with the Revelations of Ralph
Williams Used Car Salesmanship" tells of Franklin B. Howard, Chief
Horticulturist of the University of Tirana being offered the position of
the university presidency by Morris C. Dung, Chairman of the yak
Cooperative, in return for providing information regarding Tiranan
horticultursts' streaking habits.
Howard readily accepted as he saw the good that he could do by
being president. All students would be meaningful and socially
relevant. Tuition would be lowered. There would be no pollution on
the campus. All of the faculty would be tenured and assured of
parking spaces next to their offices and classrooms.
The staff would be assured of good working conditions and all
salaries would be above the campus staff salary median. And the
alumni would be assured of a winning Frisbee team that would go to
the Rose Bowl at least every other year, and their seats would be on
the 50 meter line.
Chairman Dung then offered Howard one quatloo for the
information. Howard was indignant, ranted and raved and stated,
"One quatloo! What do you think I am, a common fink?" Dung
replied, "Comrade Howard, that we have already established. All we
are doing now is haggling over price."
At the moment, I think that all that can be said about the
McCloskey campaign supporters, on this campus anyway, is that we're
just haggling about the level of wrong-doings. Honesty in politics
should be like pregnancy — you can't be just a little honest.
