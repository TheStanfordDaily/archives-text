# Nixon Denies House Order For Tapes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon flatly rejected yesterday the
House Judiciary Committee's latest
subpoena for tapes and documents,
and said he would do the same on any
such future demands.
Nixon wrote Chairman Peter W.
Rodino, D-N.J., that he must
"respectfully decline" the
impeachment panel's subpoenas for 11
more tapes of Watergate discussion
and the President's daily scheduling
diaries.
That decision applies to "such
further subpoenas as may hereafter be
issued," Nixon said.
"It's a mistake," declared Illinois
Rep. Robert McClory, one of the
committee's Republican members.
"We're all disappointed in the lack of
cooperation."
'Impeachable Offense'
"He's telling us in flat terms the
coverup continues," said Rep. George
E. Danielson, D-Calif. "We'll just file it
away and consider it another
impeachable offense," said Rep.
William L. Hungate, D-Mo.
Nixon's balk at the subpoenas —
whose deadline expired at 10 a.m.
yesterday — was his second rebuke to
the committee within hours.
The panel was informed late
Tuesday night that the President
would hand over a partial transcript of
one discussion in response to a
separate request for dozens of tapes
relating to the ITT antitrust settlement
and milk price cases.
The President's chief lawyer, James
D. St. Clair, then delivered the chief
executive's answer to the Watergate
subpoena at 11 a.m. yesterday.
'Never Ending Process'
Nixon wrote that "It is clear that
the continued succession of demands
for additional presidential
conversation has become a
never-ending process, and that to
continue providing these conversations
in response to the constantly
escalating request would constitute
such a massive invasion into the
confidentiality of presidential
conversations that the institution of the presidency itself
would be fatally compromised."
The President also repeated an earlier offer "to answer,
under oath, pertinent written interrogatories, and to be
interviewed under oath by you and the ranking minority
member at the White House."
St. Clair generally declined comment on the decision,
telling reporters that he "simply delivered a letter from the
President to the chairman."
Nixon asserted again in the letter that he had given the
committee the full story of Watergate when he released the
edited transcripts of a number of conversations April 30.
The tapes of most of those talks also had been subpoenaed,
and the panel notified Nixon that the edited versions were
not sufficient to comply with that order.
The President also is fighting District Judge John J.
Sirica's order Monday for him to turn over 64 tapes sought
by Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski.
Jaworski revealed the White House had claimed in that
dispute that the special prosecutor could not take the
President to court, a disclosure which prompted the Senate
Judiciary Committee to declare Tuesday its support for
Jaworski and his independence.
In another Senate development, the Watergate
Committee voted 5-0 to grant immunity from prosecution
to Texas lawyer Jake Jacobsen in an attempt to get him to
testify about an alleged $10,000 dairy industry bribe to
former Treasury Secretary John B. Connally. Connally has
denied taking the money.
