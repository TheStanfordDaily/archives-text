# Nixon Denies House Order For Tapes

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon flatly rejected yesterday the
House Judiciary Committee's latest
subpoena for tapes and documents,
and said he would do the same on any
such future demands.
Nixon wrote Chairman Peter W.
Rodino, D-N.J., that he must
"respectfully decline" the
impeachment panel's subpoenas for 11
more tapes of Watergate discussion
and the President's daily scheduling
diaries.
That decision applies to "such
further subpoenas as may hereafter be
issued," Nixon said.
"It's a mistake," declared Illinois
Rep. Robert McClory, one of the
committee's Republican members.
"We're all disappointed in the lack of
cooperation."
'Impeachable Offense'
"He's telling us in flat terms the
coverup continues," said Rep. George
E. Danielson, D-Calif. "We'll just file it
away and consider it another
impeachable offense," said Rep.
William L. Hungate, D-Mo.
Nixon's balk at the subpoenas —
whose deadline expired at 10 a.m.
yesterday — was his second rebuke to
the committee within hours.
The panel was informed late
Tuesday night that the President
would hand over a partial transcript of
one discussion in response to a
separate request for dozens of tapes
relating to the ITT antitrust settlement
and milk price cases.
The President's chief lawyer, James
D. St. Clair, then delivered the chief
executive's answer to the Watergate
subpoena at 11 a.m. yesterday.
'Never Ending Process'
Nixon wrote that "It is clear that
the continued succession of demands
for additional presidential
conversation has become a
never-ending process, and that to
continue providing these conversations
in response to the constantly
escalating request would constitute
such a massive invasion into the
confidentiality of presidential
