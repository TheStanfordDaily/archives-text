# Biblical Jesus Morally Indefensible

The brand new summer-autumn 1974
issue of the Stanford Review contains an
article by Prof. Michael Tooley which
examines some of the beliefs of Jesus as
described in the New Testament and finds
those beliefs morally indefensible.
The subject matter of the article is
important because many of the Protestant
fundamentalists in American high schools
and colleges today are attracted to the beliefs
and character of the Biblical Jesus.
Tooley finds that Jesus was "neither
particularly wise nor morally admirable." But
a prior question, it seems to me, is whether
we have historically meaningful knowledge
about Jesus.
As historian High Trevor-Roper argued in
the Jan. 23 and Feb. 27, 1971, issues of the
The Spectator, if we apply the basic rules of
evidence to the historical sources we have for
the life of Jesus, it is clear that as evidence
they do not stand up under examination. The
claim that the Biblical Jesus is the historical
Jesus is unwafranted.
Cannot Suspend Laws
In Trevor-Roper's words, "In history there
are no reserved areas in which the ordinary
laws of evidence may be suspended, no
documents which are exempt from the
ordinary rules of source-criticism."
Yet even if we do not know the historical
Jesus or even if there was no Jesus, it is still
worthwhile to look at the New Testament
and consider the question, as Bertrand
Russell put it, "whether Christ was the best
and the wisest of men."

Most importantly, the Biblical Jesus
accepted the concept of hell and the idea
that some people deserve everlasting
punishment. Surely this is a disproportionate
penalty, violating the maxim that the
punishment should fit the crime. In Tooley's
words, "No one deserves to suffer eternal
torment for wrong deeds done during the
short time that he or she has lived on earth."
'Petty Cruelty'
In addition, taking the Gospel narrative as
it stands, it appears to me that Jesus believed
in and practiced petty cruelty. Take the case
of the Gadarene swine. Sending the devils
into the pigs and then making the pigs rush
down the hill into the sea was morally
unjustified.
Jesus' treatment of the Gadarene swine
was not unlike someone torturing a kitten: it
showed lack of sensitivity to the struggle of
all living things to survive and develop, and it
was done capriciously (it was not done to
foster legitimate ends of human existence,
whereas harvesting plants or medical
experimentation on animals have such
legitimate ends in mind).
As Bertrand Russell emphasizes, "You
must remember that he was omnipotent, and
he could have made the devils simply go
away; but he chose to send them into the
pigs."
Similar Capriciousness
Similar capriciousness is to be found in
the story in which Jesus permanently withers
the fig tree because it has no fruit on it for
him to eat. Since fig trees do not have free

will and produce fruit only in season (it was
not the right time of the year for figs), Jesus
seems to be acting contrary to all moral sense
in this Biblical incident.
A final example of Jesus' morally
indefensible views is his belief in the idea of
an atoning sacrifice. Tooley describes this as
"the sacrifice of an innocent person to
appease an angry deity."
A Christian who knows the views of the
Biblical Jesus and yet accepts them on faith
as morally sound has refused to use his
critical judgment. Tooley points out that
"the Christian emphasis upon the importance
of firmly committing oneself to religious
beliefs which one accepts on faith"
discourages an individual from subjecting his
beliefs to sustained and impartial scrutiny.
"The desirable intellectual attitude, in
contrast, is surely this: One should ask
oneself what the main alternatives are. One
should try to determine what the relevant
evidence is, what arguments can be advanced
for and against each. Then one should not
accept any belief unless the evidence makes it
more likely that it is true than that it is false,
and firmness of one's belief should be
proportioned to the strength of the evidence.
"One's beliefs should always be tentative
and subject to revision in the light of new
evidence. These are emphatically not the
attitudes encouraged either by the Christian
churches or by the New Testament."

Similar Capriciousness
Similar capriciousness is to be found in
the story in which Jesus permanently withers
the fig tree because it has no fruit on it for
him to eat. Since fig trees do not have free

will and produce fruit only in season (it was
not the right time of the year for figs), Jesus
seems to be acting contrary to all moral sense
in this Biblical incident.
A final example of Jesus' morally
indefensible views is his belief in the idea of
an atoning sacrifice. Tooley describes this as
"the sacrifice of an innocent person to
appease an angry deity."
A Christian who knows the views of the
Biblical Jesus and yet accepts them on faith
as morally sound has refused to use his
critical judgment. Tooley points out that
"the Christian emphasis upon the importance
of firmly committing oneself to religious
beliefs which one accepts on faith"
discourages an individual from subjecting his
beliefs to sustained and impartial scrutiny.
"The desirable intellectual attitude, in
contrast, is surely this: One should ask
oneself what the main alternatives are. One
should try to determine what the relevant
evidence is, what arguments can be advanced
for and against each. Then one should not
accept any belief unless the evidence makes it
more likely that it is true than that it is false,
and firmness of one's belief should be
proportioned to the strength of the evidence.
"One's beliefs should always be tentative
and subject to revision in the light of new
evidence. These are emphatically not the
attitudes encouraged either by the Christian
churches or by the New Testament."

The brand new summer-autumn 1974
issue of the Stanford Review contains an
article by Prof. Michael Tooley which
examines some of the beliefs of Jesus as
described in the New Testament and finds
those beliefs morally indefensible.
The subject matter of the article is
important because many of the Protestant
fundamentalists in American high schools
and colleges today are attracted to the beliefs
and character of the Biblical Jesus.
Tooley finds that Jesus was "neither
particularly wise nor morally admirable." But
a prior question, it seems to me, is whether
we have historically meaningful knowledge
about Jesus.
As historian High Trevor-Roper argued in
the Jan. 23 and Feb. 27, 1971, issues of the
The Spectator, if we apply the basic rules of
evidence to the historical sources we have for
the life of Jesus, it is clear that as evidence
they do not stand up under examination. The
claim that the Biblical Jesus is the historical
Jesus is unwafranted.
Cannot Suspend Laws
In Trevor-Roper's words, "In history there
are no reserved areas in which the ordinary
laws of evidence may be suspended, no
documents which are exempt from the
ordinary rules of source-criticism."
Yet even if we do not know the historical
Jesus or even if there was no Jesus, it is still
worthwhile to look at the New Testament
and consider the question, as Bertrand
Russell put it, "whether Christ was the best
and the wisest of men."

Most importantly, the Biblical Jesus
accepted the concept of hell and the idea
that some people deserve everlasting
punishment. Surely this is a disproportionate
penalty, violating the maxim that the
punishment should fit the crime. In Tooley's
words, "No one deserves to suffer eternal
torment for wrong deeds done during the
short time that he or she has lived on earth."
'Petty Cruelty'
In addition, taking the Gospel narrative as
it stands, it appears to me that Jesus believed
in and practiced petty cruelty. Take the case
of the Gadarene swine. Sending the devils
into the pigs and then making the pigs rush
down the hill into the sea was morally
unjustified.
Jesus' treatment of the Gadarene swine
was not unlike someone torturing a kitten: it
showed lack of sensitivity to the struggle of
all living things to survive and develop, and it
was done capriciously (it was not done to
foster legitimate ends of human existence,
whereas harvesting plants or medical
experimentation on animals have such
legitimate ends in mind).
As Bertrand Russell emphasizes, "You
must remember that he was omnipotent, and
he could have made the devils simply go
away; but he chose to send them into the
pigs."

Similar capriciousness is to be found in
the story in which Jesus permanently withers

him to eat. Since fig trees do not have free
