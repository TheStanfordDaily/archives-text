# Equal Recognition For Equal Work
## 
### 
Samarf Srijumnonk

It is quite painful to get
through Alana Guarnieri's article
(Daily, May 14). It is not because
she is blasting me or any affiliate
of mine, but because what she is
expressing reflects her deeply
negative attitude toward the
liberation of all mankind.
She seems to argue that
everyone should respect the
agreement he made before getting
the job. On this point, I would
argue that non-professional labor
is oversupplied. The capitalist
employers, like opportunists, take
this chance to select carefully
simply because they have choices.
The pay, surely, must be
devalued.
How could one like Guarnieri
or whoever else is hunting for a
job carefully consider the job
conditions? What always happens
is that he or she will either jump
to accept unsatisfactory
conditions or lose the hard-to-find
job. She or he can not be blamed,
anyway.
Moreover, it is impossible for
someone outside of Stanford's
staff to stand a picket line for the
improvement of job conditions. In
other words, there is nothing
wrong at all if one will struggle for
what he really deserves.
Conditioned Acceptance
It is painful because Guarnieri
does not realize that she has been
conditioned to believe that she
deserves the payment and work
conditions offered by the
University.
This is the basic idea
underlying the maintenance of the
pyramidal social structure. While
everyone in society is made to
believe that he can move upward,
he is also conditioned to believe,
if the mobilization is unsuccessful,
that it is his fault.
It is no wonder that the

oppressors can maintain the status
quo. I would say that Guarnieri
herself is dehumanized by being
a tool of the oppressors.
Equal Recognition
In a working situation, I think
everyone should be recognized in
the sense that he equally
contributes to the whole work. Is
the Hospital operated normally
without the so-called unskilled
labors? Has any Stanford research
project been carried out
successfully without the hands of
the non-professional workers?
The doctors at the Hospital
who have just experienced the
manual job of carrying linen
would not, I am quite sure, if
offered the same salary as
workers, quit their own job to do
one which they thought required
less effort. They gain higher

income and occupational status
while the lower workers become
inferior in both. Why don't we
recognize the significance of each
function equally?
One other thing: I would
assume that the highly educated
people, such as the professionals,
are working for their social senses
of belonging rather than for
themselves. If any lower educated
worker strives for higher income,
he should be blamed less than
those professional workers who
gain high income by setting their
own salary schedules.
'Key Position'
It is not far from truth to say
that, in fact, people gain high
wages not because they are more
productive, but because they are
maintaining the key positions.
The only way to shift, or at least
to share, this power is by

unionization.
How could one like Guarnieri
isolate herself from the struggle? I
would predict that as long as she
is apathetic she would be oppressed.
Every drop of her sweat increases
the oppressors' profits, then.
I would ask, finally, all the
employees to get together. To the
University, since you are not a
profit making corporation, why
are you trying to minimize the
labor cost? To the professors, why
do you ignore the suffering of
other fellow employees when you
are also employees? To the
students, why don't we join the
workers to destroy the power
heirarchy and restructure the
society? To get rid of a few fat
worms might mean the future of
the whole world!

someone outside of Stanford's
staff to stand a picket line for the
improvement of job conditions. In
other words, there is nothing
wrong at all if one will struggle for
what he really deserves.
Conditioned Acceptance
It is painful because Guarnieri
does not realize that she has been
conditioned to believe that she
deserves the payment and work
conditions offered by the
University.
This is the basic idea
underlying the maintenance of the
pyramidal social structure. While
everyone in society is made to
believe that he can move upward,
he is also conditioned to believe,
if the mobilization is unsuccessful,
that it is his fault.
It is no wonder that the

oppressors can maintain the status
quo. I would say that Guarnieri
herself is dehumanized by being
a tool of the oppressors.
Equal Recognition
In a working situation, I think
everyone should be recognized in
the sense that he equally
contributes to the whole work. Is
the Hospital operated normally
without the so-called unskilled
labors? Has any Stanford research
project been carried out
successfully without the hands of
the non-professional workers?
The doctors at the Hospital
who have just experienced the
manual job of carrying linen
would not, I am quite sure, if
offered the same salary as
workers, quit their own job to do
one which they thought required
less effort. They gain higher

income and occupational status
while the lower workers become
inferior in both. Why don't we
recognize the significance of each
function equally?
One other thing: I would
assume that the highly educated
people, such as the professionals,
are working for their social senses
of belonging rather than for
themselves. If any lower educated
worker strives for higher income,
he should be blamed less than
those professional workers who
gain high income by setting their
own salary schedules.
'Key Position'
It is not far from truth to say
that, in fact, people gain high
wages not because they are more
productive, but because they are
maintaining the key positions.
The only way to shift, or at least
to share, this power is by

unionization.
How could one like Guarnieri
isolate herself from the struggle? I
would predict that as long as she
is apathetic she would be oppressed.
Every drop of her sweat increases
the oppressors' profits, then.
I would ask, finally, all the
employees to get together. To the
University, since you are not a
profit making corporation, why
are you trying to minimize the
labor cost? To the professors, why
do you ignore the suffering of
other fellow employees when you
are also employees? To the
students, why don't we join the
workers to destroy the power
heirarchy and restructure the
society? To get rid of a few fat
worms might mean the future of
the whole world!

It is quite painful to get
through Alana Guarnieri's article
(Daily, May 14). It is not because
she is blasting me or any affiliate
of mine, but because what she is
expressing reflects her deeply
negative attitude toward the
liberation of all mankind.
She seems to argue that
everyone should respect the
agreement he made before getting
the job. On this point, I would
argue that non-professional labor
is oversupplied. The capitalist
employers, like opportunists, take
this chance to select carefully
simply because they have choices.
The pay, surely, must be
devalued.
How could one like Guarnieri
or whoever else is hunting for a
job carefully consider the job
conditions? What always happens
is that he or she will either jump
to accept unsatisfactory
conditions or lose the hard-to-find
job. She or he can not be blamed,
anyway.
Moreover, it is impossible for
someone outside of Stanford's
staff to stand a picket line for the
improvement of job conditions. In
other words, there is nothing
wrong at all if one will struggle for
what he really deserves.
