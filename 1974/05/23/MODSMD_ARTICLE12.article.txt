# Vote For Norris In June
## 
### 
Ken Scott et al.

As usual, the spotlight in this June's primaries is
centered on the Governor's race, but that should
not lead us to overlook the fact that the office of
Attorney General is the second most powerful and
important post on the ballot.
There is an extremely able and attractive
candidate for the Democratic nomination for
Attorney General — William Norris - whom we
want to bring to the attention of everyone at
Stanford.
Bill Norris graduated here at Stanford Law
School in 1954 at the top of his class, and went on
to clerk for Justice William O. Douglas on the
Supreme Court. Since then, he has compiled a
varied and distinguished legal record.
He successfully argued against nuclear power
plant construction at Malibu, represented Indians in
San Diego County in protecting their rights, and
argued, before the U.S. Supreme Court, one of the

famous Miranda cases, which established the right
to counsel during police interrogation.
Served The Public
Bill has served the public as a member of the
California Board of Education and of the State
College Board of Trustees, where he was locked in
battle against Governor Reagan's educational plans
and policies.
Politically, Bill has played leadership roles in the
California campaigns of Tom Bradley, Wilson Riles,
Robert Kennedy and George McGovern.
California needs an Attorney General like Bill
Norris. We, as Law School faculty who have known
Bill both personally and professionally over the
years, hope all the Stanford community will join us
in supporting his candidacy.
