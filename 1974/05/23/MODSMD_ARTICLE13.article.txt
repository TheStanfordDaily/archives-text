# Emeriti Vs. Children
## 
### 
Denny Petrosian

The Children's Center of the
Stanford Community, tenants of
the University on the Mayfield
Ave. Emeritus Housing site, chose
to nurture children — not stand in
front of bulldozers; to engage in
quiet dialogue with the University
on relocation; to trust official
assurances of an offer of suitable,
permanent campus quarters and
of consideration of our needs.
With no financial assets, we are
entirely dependent on this good
faith. In return for our trust in
due process, we are now told that,
in one month, 114 children and
equipment must be off the site.
Our lease runs through Aug. 31;
site clearance is to begin June 17;
and we have no place to go.
Our one-or-nothing housing
"alternative" is Ryan Lab, once
used for radioactive research.
Decontamination, our own safety
re-check, parent inspection and
approval cannot be completed by
June 17. Interim housing distant
from campus will likely be our
"offer."
After six years, CCSC is an
established member of Stanford,
providing badly needed childcare
and innovation in raising healthy
human beings. At the eleventh
hour, official support for this
service is the privilege, once again,
of starting from nothing; of
pouring love and labor into a site
destined to be left behind; of
starting a third time in Ryan Lab
with the strong possibility of
losing much of our membership to
delay, chaotic conditions,
upheaval in our children's lives
and the unsettled issue of
radioactivity.
Survival And Faith
Our survival depends on the
spirit, stamina and faith of our
parents; large drafts are now being
made on these assets in our
demoralizing situation. ..
... Bewildering situation. We
had no reason in our talks to
believe that we would be left, at
the last, in hardship. Like children
puzzling over arbitrary discipline,
it seems we are being punished for
just "being there."
Never in all the furor over
emeritus housing were mentioned
the needs of CCSC. If such had
been included in polling
procedures and site vote, might
another site have been chosen? Is
not CCSC and emeritus housing
equal in the planner's sight?
Cool Priority
Why is Stanford research in
psychology, sociology,
anthropology, psychiatry or
education when human beings
shown by this research to be in
their most critical period of
development are given last
priority in Stanford planning?
CCSC has neither "clout" nor the
prestige or notable persons
promoting housing. But then has
prestige ever been required of
infants and those entrusted with
their care?
What can be managed at this
late hour is hard to know. There
are contracts, presumably;
construction costs skyrocket two
percent a month; the rains
mandate summer starts;
employees are on strike; and the
brunt of it falls on CCSC.
Emeriti must have housing as
soon as possible, but not urgently.
CCSC must have it immediately.
Student parties on or near
Mayfield will offend Emeritus
ears. For CCSC, no problem. By
happy chance, an enriching
symbiosis has developed with the
music department next door.
Good Neighborhood
The neighborhood, except for
week-end noise, would be lovely
for Emeritus faculty, but it is a
rich source of nourishment for
children also, with hidden parks,
grassy fields, easy access to the
beloved Lake Lagunita and to
festivities at White Plaza. Never
again will CCSC have such an
environment, nor will field trips
twice a month replace it.
Emeriti vs. children. It's a
shame. May the human concerns
of the Emeriti fare better in the
outcome than ours have.
Construction costs, in all
seriousness, can't be ignored. As
for blame, there is probably only
life to blame. As for message,
implicit and explicit, the children
of Stanford just aren't important
enough.
It is glaringly obvious that the
children should remain where
they are — come see, one and all!
We need, we welcome support and
advice. Having the remaining three
months of our lease on site would
certainly ease our dilemma.

Cool Priority
Why is Stanford research in
psychology, sociology,
anthropology, psychiatry or
education when human beings
shown by this research to be in
their most critical period of
development are given last
priority in Stanford planning?
CCSC has neither "clout" nor the
prestige or notable persons
promoting housing. But then has
prestige ever been required of
infants and those entrusted with
their care?
What can be managed at this
late hour is hard to know. There
are contracts, presumably;
construction costs skyrocket two
percent a month; the rains
mandate summer starts;
employees are on strike; and the
brunt of it falls on CCSC.
Emeriti must have housing as
soon as possible, but not urgently.
CCSC must have it immediately.
Student parties on or near
Mayfield will offend Emeritus
ears. For CCSC, no problem. By
happy chance, an enriching
symbiosis has developed with the
music department next door.
Good Neighborhood
The neighborhood, except for
week-end noise, would be lovely
for Emeritus faculty, but it is a
rich source of nourishment for
children also, with hidden parks,
grassy fields, easy access to the
beloved Lake Lagunita and to
festivities at White Plaza. Never
again will CCSC have such an
environment, nor will field trips
twice a month replace it.
Emeriti vs. children. It's a
shame. May the human concerns
of the Emeriti fare better in the
outcome than ours have.
Construction costs, in all
seriousness, can't be ignored. As
for blame, there is probably only
life to blame. As for message,
implicit and explicit, the children
of Stanford just aren't important
enough.
It is glaringly obvious that the
children should remain where
they are — come see, one and all!
We need, we welcome support and
advice. Having the remaining three
months of our lease on site would
certainly ease our dilemma.

Denny Petrosian

The Children's Center of the
Stanford Community, tenants of
the University on the Mayfield
Ave. Emeritus Housing site, chose
to nurture children — not stand in
front of bulldozers; to engage in
quiet dialogue with the University
on relocation; to trust official
assurances of an offer of suitable,
permanent campus quarters and
of consideration of our needs.
With no financial assets, we are
entirely dependent on this good
faith. In return for our trust in
due process, we are now told that,
in one month, 114 children and
equipment must be off the site.
Our lease runs through Aug. 31;
site clearance is to begin June 17;
and we have no place to go.
Our one-or-nothing housing
"alternative" is Ryan Lab, once
used for radioactive research.
Decontamination, our own safety
re-check, parent inspection and
approval cannot be completed by
June 17. Interim housing distant
from campus will likely be our
"offer."
After six years, CCSC is an
established member of Stanford,
providing badly needed childcare
and innovation in raising healthy
human beings. At the eleventh
hour, official support for this
service is the privilege, once again,
of starting from nothing; of
pouring love and labor into a site
destined to be left behind; of
starting a third time in Ryan Lab
with the strong possibility of
losing much of our membership to
delay, chaotic conditions,
upheaval in our children's lives
and the unsettled issue of
radioactivity.
Survival And Faith
Our survival depends on the
spirit, stamina and faith of our
parents; large drafts are now being
made on these assets in our
demoralizing situation. ..
... Bewildering situation. We
had no reason in our talks to
believe that we would be left, at
the last, in hardship. Like children
puzzling over arbitrary discipline,
it seems we are being punished for
just "being there."
Never in all the furor over
emeritus housing were mentioned
the needs of CCSC. If such had
been included in polling
procedures and site vote, might
another site have been chosen? Is
not CCSC and emeritus housing
equal in the planner's sight?
