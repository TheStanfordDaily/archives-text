# Martyna To Discuss History Of Women

Women's ignorance of feminist
movements in the past has
prevented the continuous
development of feminist thought,
according to Wendy Martyna, a
psychology graduate student. This
ignorance has also denied the
current women's movement its
proper perspective, she says.
Martyna will speak at noon
today in Room 87 of the Business
School as part of the CROW noon
lecture series. Her talk, "Beyond
the History of Women: A
Feminist Look at Herstory," will
include a brief but little-known
history of women, and a
discussion of the political
implications of women's place in
history.
Martyna is particularly
interested in why women have
been left out of history. "Most
people assume it's because women
have never done anything, but
women have done a lot," she says.

The idea of women's inactivity,
she adds, becomes "laughable"
when one looks at their social and
scientific contributions.
Prior to entering Stanford last
fall, Martyna worked for three
years in the Los Angeles Women's
Center, where she organized a
speaker's seminar, taught a
women's writing workshop, and
wrote for several feminist
journals.
