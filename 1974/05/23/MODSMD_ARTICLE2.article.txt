# Kidnap Victim Hearst Now Kidnap Suspect
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Kidnap
victim Patricia Hearst became kidnap
suspect Patricia Hearst yesterday, as
authorities charged the newspaper
heiress with joining her new-found
comrades in abduction, assault with a
deadly weapon and robbery.
"In our opinion, Miss Hearst was
acting on her own free will," said Los
Angeles Dist. Atty. Joseph Busch, who
filed the state felony charges against
Patricia and two Symbionese
Liberation Army members. "She is a
suspect in a kidnaping, not a victim."
The 20-year-old coed was dragged
from her home Feb. 4, and later said
she was joining the SLA terrorists who
claimed to have kidnaped her.
Yesterday, she was accused in a
multi-count indictment along with
William and Emily Harris. Federal
firearms charges had been filed against
the three earlier by the FBI.
Father's Comment
Patricia's father, newspaper
executive Randolph A. Hearst,
remained at the family home in
Hillsborough. "There's nothing to say,
really," he responded when told of the
latest charges against his daughter.
According to authorities, the
Harrises and Patricia were involved in a
shooting and bungled shoplifting
attempt last Thursday that touched
off a citywide search for SLA
members in the Los Angeles area. A
police raid on Friday left the
terrorists' chief, Donald David
"Cinque" DeFreeze and five other
SLA members dead. Authorities said
they were the nucleus of the group.
Police said Patricia sprayed the area
of a suburban sporting goods store
with bullets in the aftermath of the
shoplift attempt, then joined the
Harrises in commandeering several
vehicles and kidnaping a teenager and
a Hollywood man, later released
unharmed.
19 Counts
Patricia reportedly told the
teenager, Tom Dean Matthews, 18,
that she emptied a clip of bullets from
a semi-automatic rifle to cover the
Harrises as they fled after the
shoplifting attempt. Patricia is charged
with 19 counts in the indictment and
the Harrises with 18.
Maximum sentence for conviction
on the robbery and kidnap charges is

life imprisonment.
In San Diego, Steven Weed, 26,
whom Patricia had been planning to
marry, said, "I believe it would be
incredibly painful for Patty to come
back, at least in a psychological way."
In San Francisco, meanwhile, U.S.
Atty. James L. Browning Jr. said that
Matthews, Weed and Catherine Hearst,
Patricia's mother, are expected to
testify today before a federal
grand jury investigating Patricia's
kidnaping and the SLA robbery of a
San Francisco bank on April 15.

she was joining the SLA terrorists who
claimed to have kidnaped her.
Yesterday, she was accused in a
multi-count indictment along with
William and Emily Harris. Federal
firearms charges had been filed against
the three earlier by the FBI.
Father's Comment
Patricia's father, newspaper
executive Randolph A. Hearst,
remained at the family home in
Hillsborough. "There's nothing to say,
really," he responded when told of the
latest charges against his daughter.
According to authorities, the
Harrises and Patricia were involved in a
shooting and bungled shoplifting
attempt last Thursday that touched
off a citywide search for SLA
members in the Los Angeles area. A
police raid on Friday left the
terrorists' chief, Donald David
"Cinque" DeFreeze and five other
SLA members dead. Authorities said
they were the nucleus of the group.
Police said Patricia sprayed the area
of a suburban sporting goods store
with bullets in the aftermath of the
shoplift attempt, then joined the
Harrises in commandeering several
vehicles and kidnaping a teenager and
a Hollywood man, later released
unharmed.
19 Counts
Patricia reportedly told the
teenager, Tom Dean Matthews, 18,
that she emptied a clip of bullets from
a semi-automatic rifle to cover the
Harrises as they fled after the
shoplifting attempt. Patricia is charged
with 19 counts in the indictment and
the Harrises with 18.
Maximum sentence for conviction
on the robbery and kidnap charges is

life imprisonment.
In San Diego, Steven Weed, 26,
whom Patricia had been planning to
marry, said, "I believe it would be
incredibly painful for Patty to come
back, at least in a psychological way."
In San Francisco, meanwhile, U.S.
Atty. James L. Browning Jr. said that
Matthews, Weed and Catherine Hearst,
Patricia's mother, are expected to
testify today before a federal
grand jury investigating Patricia's
kidnaping and the SLA robbery of a
San Francisco bank on April 15.
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Kidnap
victim Patricia Hearst became kidnap
suspect Patricia Hearst yesterday, as
authorities charged the newspaper
heiress with joining her new-found
comrades in abduction, assault with a
deadly weapon and robbery.
"In our opinion, Miss Hearst was
acting on her own free will," said Los
Angeles Dist. Atty. Joseph Busch, who
filed the state felony charges against
Patricia and two Symbionese
Liberation Army members. "She is a
suspect in a kidnaping, not a victim."
The 20-year-old coed was dragged
from her home Feb. 4, and later said
she was joining the SLA terrorists who
claimed to have kidnaped her.
Yesterday, she was accused in a
multi-count indictment along with
William and Emily Harris. Federal
firearms charges had been filed against
the three earlier by the FBI.
