# Black Country, Black Blues
## Shines, Brown Give Varied Sets 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN F R ANCISCO—BIues
guitarist Johnny Shines and Oscar
Brown, Jr. appeared at the
Boarding House Tuesday through
Sunday making for a fine double
bill covering a wide spectrum of
black music.
Although he spent many years
in Chicago as the leader of blues
bands, Shines is among the best
solo country blues artists working
today.
Shines left music for nearly
eight years during the late 50s and
mid-60s because he was fed up
with the musicians' union.
Fortunately, he was persuaded to
return to the business by two
English blues enthusiasts.
While a teenager in Arkansas,
Shines was a good friend of the
legenday Robert Johnson.
Wednesday night's opening set
began with three of Johnson's
compositions, "Kindhearted
Woman," "Sweet Home Chicago,"
and "They're Red Hot." At times
Shines can sound so much like
Johnson it's haunting, especially
on "Kindhearted Woman," with
its falsetto jumps. But, Shines
always adds his own touches to
the compositions of others,
making them fresh and distinctly
his.
Another bluesman Shines met

in Arkansas was Howlin' Wolf,
whose material Shines sometimes
includes in his sets. Shines is well
acquainted with nearly every
major blues figure both rural and
urban, past and present.
His guitar playing Wednesday
night, May 15, was flawless, both
with or without a slide. He sings
in a clear, powerful voice about
his own experiences. "I've lived it
— it's not an idea, it's a fact ...
it's not a creation, it's already
created."
On "Just A Little Tenderness,"
an R&B, gospel-type selection,
Shines gave a "sermon" on why
you shouldn't do yourself in when
times get hard: "Whatever you do,
don't take those doggone 22
sleeping pills; I want you to stay
right here and suffer like I am."
Shines' superb set was followed
by an equally fine, but very
different, sample from Oscar
Brown, Jr.
Unique Talent
Brown is a singer, actor, song
writer, storyteller, comedian,
dancer, and poet. His style
encompasses jazz, soul, rock,
gospel, and folk. Amazingly
enough, this one-man potpourri
comes across not as sloppy "pop,"
as would be the case with most,
but as Oscar Brown, Jr., a truly
unique talent.

The audiences, although
disappointingly small (less than 50
on some nights), thoroughly
enjoyed his every song, joke, and
gesture.
Opening with the title song
from the production No Place To
Be Somebody, Brown may have
seemed too "stagey" for some
(showmanship of Brown's type is
a rarity for Boarding House
audiences), but before the end of
the song, the entire audience was
definitely feeling the man's
energy. His performance is similar
in many respects to Sammy Davis,
Jr., but without the
commercialism.
Brown doesn't just sing a song,
he acts it out, with different
voices, gestures, dance steps, and
expressions. Backing up Brown
were pianist Sam Peoples, bassist
Raphael Grinage, and Babatunde
on drums and flute.
'Thousand Chumps'
Like nearly 50 percent of his
songs, "The Snake" (one of his
most famous) deals with sex in a
humorous way. This was possibly
Brown's best number of the set,
after which he quoted the
"ancient philosopher" by saying,
"For every true snake there are a
thousand chumps."
This was followed by a
psuedo-macho Latin tune entitled

"Wham, Bam, Thank You,
Ma'am."
Brown's most famous song
format is the narrative. Combine
this with his double-intendre
lyrics, and you have "The Lady's
Man:"
"/ look back on the life I've led.
What mighty powers I might have
led.
If I'd not shot so much in bed . . .
A lady's man."
Brown's funniest song of the
set was "But I Was Cool:"
"/ breezed home to her with all
my pay;
There was a note on the door, this
is what she had to say:
'So long, Sappy, I have run away.'
So, I fell down across her empty
bed.
These are the words I said:
'SHEEEITTH!'
But I was cool."
The most dramatic number of
the set was "Rags and Old Iron,"
in which Brown reminisces about
the various street cries he heard
during his childhood in Chicago.
Brown closed with the title
tune from his latest Atlantic LP,
Brother Where Are You, and
returned for an encore. To say
that Oscar Brown, Jr. has "stage
presence" would be a gross
understatement.

writer, storyteller, comedian,
dancer, and poet. His style
encompasses jazz, soul, rock,
gospel, and folk. Amazingly
enough, this one-man potpourri
comes across not as sloppy "pop,"
as would be the case with most,
but as Oscar Brown, Jr., a truly
unique talent.

The audiences, although
disappointingly small (less than 50
on some nights), thoroughly
enjoyed his every song, joke, and
gesture.
Opening with the title song
from the production No Place To
Be Somebody, Brown may have
seemed too "stagey" for some
(showmanship of Brown's type is
a rarity for Boarding House
audiences), but before the end of
the song, the entire audience was
definitely feeling the man's
energy. His performance is similar
in many respects to Sammy Davis,
Jr., but without the
commercialism.
Brown doesn't just sing a song,
he acts it out, with different
voices, gestures, dance steps, and
expressions. Backing up Brown
were pianist Sam Peoples, bassist
Raphael Grinage, and Babatunde
on drums and flute.
'Thousand Chumps'
Like nearly 50 percent of his
songs, "The Snake" (one of his
most famous) deals with sex in a
humorous way. This was possibly
Brown's best number of the set,
after which he quoted the
"ancient philosopher" by saying,
"For every true snake there are a
thousand chumps."
This was followed by a
psuedo-macho Latin tune entitled

"Wham, Bam, Thank You,
Ma'am."
Brown's most famous song
format is the narrative. Combine
this with his double-intendre
lyrics, and you have "The Lady's
Man:"
"/ look back on the life I've led.
What mighty powers I might have
led.
If I'd not shot so much in bed . . .
A lady's man."
Brown's funniest song of the
set was "But I Was Cool:"
"/ breezed home to her with all
my pay;
There was a note on the door, this
is what she had to say:
'So long, Sappy, I have run away.'
So, I fell down across her empty
bed.
These are the words I said:
'SHEEEITTH!'
But I was cool."
The most dramatic number of
the set was "Rags and Old Iron,"
in which Brown reminisces about
the various street cries he heard
during his childhood in Chicago.
Brown closed with the title
tune from his latest Atlantic LP,
Brother Where Are You, and
returned for an encore. To say
that Oscar Brown, Jr. has "stage
presence" would be a gross
understatement.
SAN F R ANCISCO—BIues
guitarist Johnny Shines and Oscar
Brown, Jr. appeared at the
Boarding House Tuesday through
Sunday making for a fine double
bill covering a wide spectrum of
black music.
Although he spent many years
in Chicago as the leader of blues
bands, Shines is among the best
solo country blues artists working
today.
Shines left music for nearly
eight years during the late 50s and
mid-60s because he was fed up
with the musicians' union.
Fortunately, he was persuaded to
return to the business by two
English blues enthusiasts.
While a teenager in Arkansas,
Shines was a good friend of the
legenday Robert Johnson.
Wednesday night's opening set
began with three of Johnson's
compositions, "Kindhearted
Woman," "Sweet Home Chicago,"
and "They're Red Hot." At times
Shines can sound so much like
Johnson it's haunting, especially
on "Kindhearted Woman," with
its falsetto jumps. But, Shines
always adds his own touches to
the compositions of others,
making them fresh and distinctly
his.
Another bluesman Shines met

in Arkansas was Howlin' Wolf,
whose material Shines sometimes
includes in his sets. Shines is well
acquainted with nearly every
major blues figure both rural and
urban, past and present.
His guitar playing Wednesday
night, May 15, was flawless, both
with or without a slide. He sings
in a clear, powerful voice about
his own experiences. "I've lived it
— it's not an idea, it's a fact ...
it's not a creation, it's already
created."
On "Just A Little Tenderness,"
an R&B, gospel-type selection,
Shines gave a "sermon" on why
you shouldn't do yourself in when
times get hard: "Whatever you do,
don't take those doggone 22
sleeping pills; I want you to stay
right here and suffer like I am."
Shines' superb set was followed
by an equally fine, but very
different, sample from Oscar
Brown, Jr.

So, I fell down across her empty
bed.
These are the words I said:
'SHEEEITTH!'
But I was cool."
The most dramatic number of
the set was "Rags and Old Iron,"
in which Brown reminisces about
the various street cries he heard
during his childhood in Chicago.
Brown closed with the title
tune from his latest Atlantic LP,
Brother Where Are You, and
returned for an encore. To say
that Oscar Brown, Jr. has "stage
presence" would be a gross
understatement.
SAN F R ANCISCO—BIues
guitarist Johnny Shines and Oscar
Brown, Jr. appeared at the
Boarding House Tuesday through
Sunday making for a fine double
bill covering a wide spectrum of
black music.
Although he spent many years
in Chicago as the leader of blues
bands, Shines is among the best
solo country blues artists working
today.
Shines left music for nearly
eight years during the late 50s and
mid-60s because he was fed up
with the musicians' union.
Fortunately, he was persuaded to
return to the business by two
English blues enthusiasts.
While a teenager in Arkansas,
Shines was a good friend of the
legenday Robert Johnson.
Wednesday night's opening set
began with three of Johnson's
compositions, "Kindhearted
Woman," "Sweet Home Chicago,"
and "They're Red Hot." At times
Shines can sound so much like
Johnson it's haunting, especially
on "Kindhearted Woman," with
its falsetto jumps. But, Shines
always adds his own touches to
the compositions of others,
making them fresh and distinctly
his.
Another bluesman Shines met

in Arkansas was Howlin' Wolf,
whose material Shines sometimes
includes in his sets. Shines is well
acquainted with nearly every
major blues figure both rural and
urban, past and present.
His guitar playing Wednesday
night, May 15, was flawless, both
with or without a slide. He sings
in a clear, powerful voice about
his own experiences. "I've lived it
— it's not an idea, it's a fact ...
it's not a creation, it's already
created."
On "Just A Little Tenderness,"
an R&B, gospel-type selection,
Shines gave a "sermon" on why
you shouldn't do yourself in when
times get hard: "Whatever you do,
don't take those doggone 22
sleeping pills; I want you to stay
right here and suffer like I am."
Shines' superb set was followed
by an equally fine, but very
different, sample from Oscar
Brown, Jr.
Unique Talent
Brown is a singer, actor, song
writer, storyteller, comedian,
dancer, and poet. His style
encompasses jazz, soul, rock,
gospel, and folk. Amazingly
enough, this one-man potpourri
comes across not as sloppy "pop,"
as would be the case with most,
but as Oscar Brown, Jr., a truly
unique talent.

The audiences, although
disappointingly small (less than 50
on some nights), thoroughly
enjoyed his every song, joke, and
gesture.
Opening with the title song
from the production No Place To
Be Somebody, Brown may have
seemed too "stagey" for some
(showmanship of Brown's type is
a rarity for Boarding House
audiences), but before the end of
the song, the entire audience was
definitely feeling the man's
energy. His performance is similar
in many respects to Sammy Davis,
Jr., but without the
commercialism.
Brown doesn't just sing a song,
he acts it out, with different
voices, gestures, dance steps, and
expressions. Backing up Brown
were pianist Sam Peoples, bassist
Raphael Grinage, and Babatunde
on drums and flute.
'Thousand Chumps'
Like nearly 50 percent of his
songs, "The Snake" (one of his
most famous) deals with sex in a
humorous way. This was possibly
Brown's best number of the set,
after which he quoted the
"ancient philosopher" by saying,
"For every true snake there are a
thousand chumps."
This was followed by a
psuedo-macho Latin tune entitled

"Wham, Bam, Thank You,
Ma'am."
Brown's most famous song
format is the narrative. Combine
this with his double-intendre
lyrics, and you have "The Lady's
Man:"
"/ look back on the life I've led.
What mighty powers I might have
led.
If I'd not shot so much in bed . . .
A lady's man."
Brown's funniest song of the
set was "But I Was Cool:"
"/ breezed home to her with all
my pay;
There was a note on the door, this
is what she had to say:
'So long, Sappy, I have run away.'
So, I fell down across her empty
bed.
These are the words I said:
'SHEEEITTH!'
But I was cool."
The most dramatic number of
the set was "Rags and Old Iron,"
in which Brown reminisces about
the various street cries he heard
