Two Points Block Syria-Israel Pact'
JERUSALEM, Israel — A senior U.S. official said
yesterday two major obstacles remain to a Syrian-Israeli
disengagement pact — Syria's resistance to thinning out its
forces defending Damascus, and the size of a United
Nations force to man the buffer zone.
Although substantial progress has been made toward an
agreement, he said, the gap on the two main issues still is
"pretty wide."
The official added that Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger has gained substantial agreement on where the
Golan Heights line would be drawn, an exchange of
prisoners from the October war and the status of the U.N.
group.
Kissinger returned here last night after meeting for 3'/2
hours in Damascus with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
He plans to return to Washington this weekend — with
or without final settlement — and if total agreement is not
reached, will "let everybody take a breather for a week or
two," the official said.
More British Troops Fly To Ireland
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Another 500 British
ttoops flew to strike-bound Northern Ireland yesterday as
Protestant extremists quickly rebuilt many of the
barricades the army tore down.
It was the second reinforcement dispatched to the
province in three days and brought the garrison here to
16,500 men.
Meanwhile, Britain and the Northern Ireland Executive
announced that implementation of much of a pact giving
Dublin a say in northern affairs would be delayed at least
until 1977.
Gasoline supplies have all but given out in Northern
Ireland and authorities said the province's entire power
system would close down within four days.
Gunfire erupted around a Protestant stronghold and
troops in armored cars rushed in and pulled out a police
patrol under attack by a mob of young toughs. No injuries
were reported.
The strike in Northern Ireland was in its eighth day.
Nearly all industry was paralyzed, trains and buses weren't
running and power supplies were down to 30 percent of
normal.
The strike was called to protest British government
measures seen by the extremists as leading to eventual
union with the mainly Roman Catholic Irish republic.
Transplant Trial Verdict: Guilty
OAKLAND — A jury convicted Andrew D. Lyons, 37,
yesterday of voluntary manslaughter after a judge had
thrown out defense arguments the victim died when his
heart was removed for a transplant instead of from the

gunshot wounds.
The jury of eight men and four women deliberated two
full days before finding Lyons guilty in the shooting of
Samuel Mitchell Allen Jr.. 29, last Sept. 20. Lyons testified
the gun fired accidentally during a struggle at Lyons' home.
Alameda Superior Court Judge William J. Hayes set June
12 for sentencing. Lyons, who had been free on $15,000
bail, was remanded to custody. The penalty for voluntary
manslaughter, plus an additional five years for use of a gun
in a crime, is 6-15 years.
At the trial doctors testified they pronounced Allen
dead two days after the shooting because his brain activity
had ceased. The slain man's heart was used in a transplant
operation by Stanford Medical Center's Dr. Norman E.
Shumway, who was a trial witness.
Judge Hayes told the jury when they got the case
Tuesday morning, "A person may be pronounced dead if,
based on usual and customary standards of medical
practice, it is determined that the person has suffered an
irreversible cessation of brain function.
Defense attorney John Cruikshank said he would move
for a new trial and, failing in that, would appeal "primarily
on the basis of the brain-death instruction to the jury by
Judge Hayes."
House Rejects Overseas Military Cuts
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday refused to raise
or lower U.S. military aid to South Vietnam and rejected an
effort to phase out 100,000 U.S. troops overseas.
It rejected, 211 to 190, an amendment by Rep. Robert
L. Leggett, D-Calif., to cut the present $1,126 billion
ceiling on Vietnam aid to $1 billion.
Chairman F. Edward Hebert, D-La., of the House Armed
Services Committee abandoned the committee's
recommendation that the aid be increased to $1.4 billion in
the face of House opposition and moved instead that it be
kept at the present level. That was approved by voice vote.
Leggett had said his amendment to cut the aid was
meant to impose restraints on the South Vietnamese and
told the House, "I don't advocate pulling the plug on
Vietnam."
The troop reduction amendment by House Democratic-
Leader Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., D-Mass., was rejected 240 to
163.
Judge May Lift Zebra Gag Order
SAN FRANCISCO — Unless attorneys object, the
controversial Zebra case gag order will be lifted next week,
a Superior Court judge says.
Judge Morton R. Colvin also said Tuesday he would
open transcripts of the grand jury which indicted four
young black men for murder. They were accused of three
of the random and unprovoked Zebra killings of whites
here.
Colvin set next Wednesday to hear pleas and to set a trial
date. The four indicted were Manuel Moore, 29; J.C.
Simon, 29; Larry Craig Green, 22, and Jessie Cooks, 29.
Cooks now is serving a prison term for another murder.
The three others were arrested May 1 in a police raid on an
apartment building.
The gag order was imposed two weeks ago by Municipal
Court Judge Agnes O'Brien Smith.
Liddy Sentence Adjusted
WASHINGTON — G. Gordon Liddy, serving heavy
prison terms for the Watergate break-in, yesterday
succeeded in getting a judge to lift a portion of a sentence
that Liddy considered illegal and felt he could not fulfill.
U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt had added to Liddy's
term with two six-month sentences for Liddy's refusal to be
sworn in to testify before a House subcommittee. In the
sentencing on May 10, Pratt placed Liddy on probation,
which carries a provision that he not associate with known
criminals.
Liddy, who is in the District of Columbia jail, pointed
out in a letter to the judge, "At the present time I live in
close association with more than 700 such persons."
Liddy also said he has no control over where he was
taken by U.S. marshals and could not meet the requirement
that he could not travel outside the District of Columbia
without approval of a probation officer.
The judge reimposed the same sentence but ordered it
suspended without any probation.
The former lawyer for President Nixon's re-election
committee and its finance arm now is under a six- to
20-year sentence for the Watergate burglary and a contempt
sentence for refusing to testify before the grand jury.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy low clouds
along the coast night and morning. Lows tonight in upper
40s to mid 50s. Highs both days in mid 60s to mid 70s.
Light winds except westerly 10 to 20 mph afternoons and

young black men for murder. They were accused of three
of the random and unprovoked Zebra killings of whites
here.
Colvin set next Wednesday to hear pleas and to set a trial
date. The four indicted were Manuel Moore, 29; J.C.
Simon, 29; Larry Craig Green, 22, and Jessie Cooks, 29.
Cooks now is serving a prison term for another murder.
The three others were arrested May 1 in a police raid on an
apartment building.
The gag order was imposed two weeks ago by Municipal
Court Judge Agnes O'Brien Smith.
Liddy Sentence Adjusted
WASHINGTON — G. Gordon Liddy, serving heavy
prison terms for the Watergate break-in, yesterday
succeeded in getting a judge to lift a portion of a sentence
that Liddy considered illegal and felt he could not fulfill.
U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt had added to Liddy's
term with two six-month sentences for Liddy's refusal to be
sworn in to testify before a House subcommittee. In the
sentencing on May 10, Pratt placed Liddy on probation,
which carries a provision that he not associate with known
criminals.
Liddy, who is in the District of Columbia jail, pointed
out in a letter to the judge, "At the present time I live in
close association with more than 700 such persons."
Liddy also said he has no control over where he was
taken by U.S. marshals and could not meet the requirement
that he could not travel outside the District of Columbia
without approval of a probation officer.
The judge reimposed the same sentence but ordered it
suspended without any probation.
The former lawyer for President Nixon's re-election
committee and its finance arm now is under a six- to
20-year sentence for the Watergate burglary and a contempt
sentence for refusing to testify before the grand jury.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy low clouds
along the coast night and morning. Lows tonight in upper
40s to mid 50s. Highs both days in mid 60s to mid 70s.
Light winds except westerly 10 to 20 mph afternoons and
evenings.
Two Points Block Syria-Israel Pact'
JERUSALEM, Israel — A senior U.S. official said
yesterday two major obstacles remain to a Syrian-Israeli
disengagement pact — Syria's resistance to thinning out its
forces defending Damascus, and the size of a United
Nations force to man the buffer zone.
Although substantial progress has been made toward an
agreement, he said, the gap on the two main issues still is
"pretty wide."
The official added that Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger has gained substantial agreement on where the
Golan Heights line would be drawn, an exchange of
prisoners from the October war and the status of the U.N.
group.
Kissinger returned here last night after meeting for 3'/2
hours in Damascus with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
He plans to return to Washington this weekend — with
or without final settlement — and if total agreement is not
reached, will "let everybody take a breather for a week or
two," the official said.
More British Troops Fly To Ireland
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Another 500 British
ttoops flew to strike-bound Northern Ireland yesterday as
Protestant extremists quickly rebuilt many of the
barricades the army tore down.
It was the second reinforcement dispatched to the
province in three days and brought the garrison here to
16,500 men.
Meanwhile, Britain and the Northern Ireland Executive
announced that implementation of much of a pact giving
Dublin a say in northern affairs would be delayed at least
until 1977.
Gasoline supplies have all but given out in Northern
Ireland and authorities said the province's entire power
system would close down within four days.
Gunfire erupted around a Protestant stronghold and
troops in armored cars rushed in and pulled out a police
patrol under attack by a mob of young toughs. No injuries
were reported.
The strike in Northern Ireland was in its eighth day.
Nearly all industry was paralyzed, trains and buses weren't
running and power supplies were down to 30 percent of
normal.
The strike was called to protest British government
measures seen by the extremists as leading to eventual
union with the mainly Roman Catholic Irish republic.
Transplant Trial Verdict: Guilty
OAKLAND — A jury convicted Andrew D. Lyons, 37,
yesterday of voluntary manslaughter after a judge had
thrown out defense arguments the victim died when his
heart was removed for a transplant instead of from the

gunshot wounds.
The jury of eight men and four women deliberated two
full days before finding Lyons guilty in the shooting of
Samuel Mitchell Allen Jr.. 29, last Sept. 20. Lyons testified
the gun fired accidentally during a struggle at Lyons' home.
Alameda Superior Court Judge William J. Hayes set June
12 for sentencing. Lyons, who had been free on $15,000
bail, was remanded to custody. The penalty for voluntary
manslaughter, plus an additional five years for use of a gun
in a crime, is 6-15 years.
At the trial doctors testified they pronounced Allen
dead two days after the shooting because his brain activity
had ceased. The slain man's heart was used in a transplant
operation by Stanford Medical Center's Dr. Norman E.
Shumway, who was a trial witness.
Judge Hayes told the jury when they got the case
Tuesday morning, "A person may be pronounced dead if,
based on usual and customary standards of medical
practice, it is determined that the person has suffered an
irreversible cessation of brain function.
Defense attorney John Cruikshank said he would move
for a new trial and, failing in that, would appeal "primarily
on the basis of the brain-death instruction to the jury by
Judge Hayes."
House Rejects Overseas Military Cuts
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday refused to raise
or lower U.S. military aid to South Vietnam and rejected an
effort to phase out 100,000 U.S. troops overseas.
It rejected, 211 to 190, an amendment by Rep. Robert
L. Leggett, D-Calif., to cut the present $1,126 billion
ceiling on Vietnam aid to $1 billion.
Chairman F. Edward Hebert, D-La., of the House Armed
Services Committee abandoned the committee's
recommendation that the aid be increased to $1.4 billion in
the face of House opposition and moved instead that it be
kept at the present level. That was approved by voice vote.
Leggett had said his amendment to cut the aid was
meant to impose restraints on the South Vietnamese and
told the House, "I don't advocate pulling the plug on
Vietnam."
The troop reduction amendment by House Democratic-
Leader Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., D-Mass., was rejected 240 to
163.

12 for sentencing. Lyons, who had been free on $15,000
bail, was remanded to custody. The penalty for voluntary
manslaughter, plus an additional five years for use of a gun
in a crime, is 6-15 years.
At the trial doctors testified they pronounced Allen
dead two days after the shooting because his brain activity
had ceased. The slain man's heart was used in a transplant
operation by Stanford Medical Center's Dr. Norman E.
Shumway, who was a trial witness.
Judge Hayes told the jury when they got the case
Tuesday morning, "A person may be pronounced dead if,
based on usual and customary standards of medical
practice, it is determined that the person has suffered an
irreversible cessation of brain function.
Defense attorney John Cruikshank said he would move
for a new trial and, failing in that, would appeal "primarily
on the basis of the brain-death instruction to the jury by
Judge Hayes."
House Rejects Overseas Military Cuts
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday refused to raise
or lower U.S. military aid to South Vietnam and rejected an
effort to phase out 100,000 U.S. troops overseas.
It rejected, 211 to 190, an amendment by Rep. Robert
L. Leggett, D-Calif., to cut the present $1,126 billion
ceiling on Vietnam aid to $1 billion.
Chairman F. Edward Hebert, D-La., of the House Armed
Services Committee abandoned the committee's
recommendation that the aid be increased to $1.4 billion in
the face of House opposition and moved instead that it be
kept at the present level. That was approved by voice vote.
Leggett had said his amendment to cut the aid was
meant to impose restraints on the South Vietnamese and
told the House, "I don't advocate pulling the plug on
Vietnam."
The troop reduction amendment by House Democratic-
Leader Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., D-Mass., was rejected 240 to
163.
Judge May Lift Zebra Gag Order
SAN FRANCISCO — Unless attorneys object, the
controversial Zebra case gag order will be lifted next week,
a Superior Court judge says.
Judge Morton R. Colvin also said Tuesday he would
open transcripts of the grand jury which indicted four
young black men for murder. They were accused of three
of the random and unprovoked Zebra killings of whites
here.
Colvin set next Wednesday to hear pleas and to set a trial
date. The four indicted were Manuel Moore, 29; J.C.
Simon, 29; Larry Craig Green, 22, and Jessie Cooks, 29.
Cooks now is serving a prison term for another murder.
The three others were arrested May 1 in a police raid on an
apartment building.
The gag order was imposed two weeks ago by Municipal
Court Judge Agnes O'Brien Smith.
Liddy Sentence Adjusted
WASHINGTON — G. Gordon Liddy, serving heavy
prison terms for the Watergate break-in, yesterday
succeeded in getting a judge to lift a portion of a sentence
that Liddy considered illegal and felt he could not fulfill.
U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt had added to Liddy's
term with two six-month sentences for Liddy's refusal to be
sworn in to testify before a House subcommittee. In the
sentencing on May 10, Pratt placed Liddy on probation,
which carries a provision that he not associate with known
criminals.
Liddy, who is in the District of Columbia jail, pointed
out in a letter to the judge, "At the present time I live in
close association with more than 700 such persons."
Liddy also said he has no control over where he was
taken by U.S. marshals and could not meet the requirement
that he could not travel outside the District of Columbia
without approval of a probation officer.
The judge reimposed the same sentence but ordered it
suspended without any probation.
The former lawyer for President Nixon's re-election
committee and its finance arm now is under a six- to
20-year sentence for the Watergate burglary and a contempt
sentence for refusing to testify before the grand jury.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy low clouds
along the coast night and morning. Lows tonight in upper
40s to mid 50s. Highs both days in mid 60s to mid 70s.
Light winds except westerly 10 to 20 mph afternoons and
evenings.
Two Points Block Syria-Israel Pact'
JERUSALEM, Israel — A senior U.S. official said
yesterday two major obstacles remain to a Syrian-Israeli
disengagement pact — Syria's resistance to thinning out its
forces defending Damascus, and the size of a United
Nations force to man the buffer zone.
Although substantial progress has been made toward an
agreement, he said, the gap on the two main issues still is
"pretty wide."
The official added that Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger has gained substantial agreement on where the
Golan Heights line would be drawn, an exchange of
prisoners from the October war and the status of the U.N.
group.
Kissinger returned here last night after meeting for 3'/2
hours in Damascus with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
He plans to return to Washington this weekend — with
or without final settlement — and if total agreement is not
reached, will "let everybody take a breather for a week or
two," the official said.
More British Troops Fly To Ireland
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Another 500 British
ttoops flew to strike-bound Northern Ireland yesterday as
Protestant extremists quickly rebuilt many of the
barricades the army tore down.
It was the second reinforcement dispatched to the
province in three days and brought the garrison here to
16,500 men.
Meanwhile, Britain and the Northern Ireland Executive
announced that implementation of much of a pact giving
Dublin a say in northern affairs would be delayed at least
until 1977.
Gasoline supplies have all but given out in Northern
Ireland and authorities said the province's entire power
system would close down within four days.
Gunfire erupted around a Protestant stronghold and
troops in armored cars rushed in and pulled out a police
patrol under attack by a mob of young toughs. No injuries
were reported.
The strike in Northern Ireland was in its eighth day.
Nearly all industry was paralyzed, trains and buses weren't
running and power supplies were down to 30 percent of
normal.
The strike was called to protest British government
measures seen by the extremists as leading to eventual
union with the mainly Roman Catholic Irish republic.
Transplant Trial Verdict: Guilty
OAKLAND — A jury convicted Andrew D. Lyons, 37,
yesterday of voluntary manslaughter after a judge had
thrown out defense arguments the victim died when his
heart was removed for a transplant instead of from the

gunshot wounds.
The jury of eight men and four women deliberated two
full days before finding Lyons guilty in the shooting of
Samuel Mitchell Allen Jr.. 29, last Sept. 20. Lyons testified
the gun fired accidentally during a struggle at Lyons' home.
