# Medieval Studies Courses Will Dispel Myths About Middle Ages
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
For most people, the Middle Ages represents 1000 years
of praying in a dark cathedral or 1000 years without a bath.
The new department of Medieval Studies, to begin next
year, will try to dispel that myth.
"The Middle Ages is a time that is lost," explains
department chairman George H. Brown. "The culture and
the environment were very different from any other period.
"However, a lot of our Western and modern traditions
developed in the Middle Ages. It's a bridge between ancient
and modern times."
One of several special programs in humanities, the major
is an interdisciplinary program concentrating upon the
European Middle Ages as a civilization, culture, or period in
its own right. Courses will be drawn from such departments
as literature, history, drama, music, art history, philosophy,
religious studies and humanities.
"Actually," says Brown, "You could have a medieval
course for just about every department, except maybe
science, and we're working on that one."
Informal Beginnings
Interest in the program began informally four years ago,
when Brown came to Stanford's English department from
Harvard.
'There is a Medieval Institute at Harvard, and also one at
the University of Toronto, where many of my friends
teach. So I knew this could be a very good program."
He found a very active medieval circle among Stanford's

faculty. Getting together for lunch on Fridays, they soon
began to develop an idea for a new department, combining
many different areas.
'This way," explained Brown, "we get all the experts on
the medieval period of various subjects.
"It's also a means of keeping together, in one section of
Courses and Degrees, everything connected with the Middle
Ages."
Interested students will be invited to attend a meeting in
the Fall, to receive information about an introductory
course in Medieval Studies to be offered Winter Quarter.
Seminar Format
"It will be a get-to-know-your-local-medievalist type
course," says Brown. (The course, taught last year as
History 65, was very successful.)
Designed for an upper division enrollment, all courses
will be taught in a seminar format, with small classes of less
than 22 students and two professors.
Brown stresses that there will be a strong commitment
to an active advising system. Before declaring the major, all
students must confer with History Prof. Gavin Langmuir,
who will then direct the student to an advisor in his
particular area of interest.
Brown praises his faculty as "young and energetic.
There's still some blood flowing in our veins."
He is optimistic about the interest generated also by
students in other fields who might take one or two courses
in Medieval Studies "just for fun."

'There is a Medieval Institute at Harvard, and also one at
the University of Toronto, where many of my friends
teach. So I knew this could be a very good program."
He found a very active medieval circle among Stanford's

faculty. Getting together for lunch on Fridays, they soon
began to develop an idea for a new department, combining
many different areas.
'This way," explained Brown, "we get all the experts on
the medieval period of various subjects.
"It's also a means of keeping together, in one section of
Courses and Degrees, everything connected with the Middle
Ages."
Interested students will be invited to attend a meeting in
the Fall, to receive information about an introductory
course in Medieval Studies to be offered Winter Quarter.
Seminar Format
"It will be a get-to-know-your-local-medievalist type
course," says Brown. (The course, taught last year as
History 65, was very successful.)
Designed for an upper division enrollment, all courses
will be taught in a seminar format, with small classes of less
than 22 students and two professors.
Brown stresses that there will be a strong commitment
to an active advising system. Before declaring the major, all
students must confer with History Prof. Gavin Langmuir,
who will then direct the student to an advisor in his
particular area of interest.
Brown praises his faculty as "young and energetic.
There's still some blood flowing in our veins."
He is optimistic about the interest generated also by
students in other fields who might take one or two courses
in Medieval Studies "just for fun."
For most people, the Middle Ages represents 1000 years
of praying in a dark cathedral or 1000 years without a bath.
The new department of Medieval Studies, to begin next
year, will try to dispel that myth.
"The Middle Ages is a time that is lost," explains
department chairman George H. Brown. "The culture and
the environment were very different from any other period.
"However, a lot of our Western and modern traditions
developed in the Middle Ages. It's a bridge between ancient
and modern times."
One of several special programs in humanities, the major
is an interdisciplinary program concentrating upon the
European Middle Ages as a civilization, culture, or period in
its own right. Courses will be drawn from such departments
as literature, history, drama, music, art history, philosophy,
religious studies and humanities.
"Actually," says Brown, "You could have a medieval
course for just about every department, except maybe
science, and we're working on that one."
Informal Beginnings
Interest in the program began informally four years ago,
when Brown came to Stanford's English department from
Harvard.
