# Charges 'Political Bias'
## Flores Appeals Tenure Denial 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Asst. German Prof. John (Juan)
Flores has appealed to Provost William
Miller the decision of Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Halsey
Royden to deny the German
Department's recommendation for his
promotion to a tenured position.
In a seven-page letter to Miller
dated May 17, Flores claimed that
Royden's decision was influenced by
political bias and clouded by
ambiguous criteria for promotion.
According to Flores, the one book
and one scholarly article he has
published are enough to warrant a
tenured position. Although Royden
claims this work is not enough to grant
Flores tenure, Flores insisted that the
high quality of the publications
compensate for any lack of quantity.
Calling the reaction to his book
Poetry In East Germany

"overwhelmingly positive," Flores said
it received favorable reviews in many
scholarly publications.
"From all that I have been able to
gather, there are many acknowledged
precedents of promotion to tenure in
Humanities and Sciences on the basis
of significantly less scholarly output
than one major book and a substantial
article," Flores said.
Quality, Not Quantity
"Clearly the issue is not volume,
whether in weights and measures or in
its distribution over the years, but
quality," Flores wrote.
Flores noted that the article was
not an extension of the book, but
rather contained "a great deal of
scholarly intensity."
Flores also claimed that Associate
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Lewis Spitz "was at least partially
instrumental in the decision-making in
my case," and was biased against him
for political reasons.
Political Ramifications
According to Flores, Spitz has long
objected to his left-wing political views
and once wrote a letter to German
Department Chairman Walter Lounes
calling for punitive action against him
for his participation in a
demonstration.
"I am convinced that the political
ramifications of this case are more
far-reaching than my reference to the
influence exerted by Prof. Spitz would
indicate," Flores said.
Flores noted that Royden had
dismissed the book as a mere
extension of a doctoral dissertation,
but Flores insisted that in the past the
department has not looked down on
such publications.
Calling the decision of Royden
"unjust" and "untenable" Flores

asked that Miller allow the entire case
to be reviewed.
Ambiguous Decision
Flores said that the ambiguity of
Royden's decision and alleged bias of
Spitz "amount to more than adequate
grounds on which to expect a serious,
considered review of the entire
decision."
After Flores released the letter to
the Daily, Miller told the Daily he was
not certain if he had received the letter
yet. After checking his mail, he said
that he had received it but would not
comment upon it. Miller has said it
would take him a few weeks to render
a decision in the matter.
