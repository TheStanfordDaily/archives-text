# Peaceful Pickets Obey Restraints
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
The first full day of a temporary
restraining order barring more than
two pickets from campus entrances
and exits passed peacefully, with no
apparent violations by striking United
Stanford Employees (USE) union
members.
Two hundred demonstrators, most
of them students, provided the day's
most vocal support for the strike as
they marched through the Quad to the
Medical Center after a noon rally in
White Plaza.
Urged on by striking laboratory
assistant Tim Gadus, about 50 of the
demonstrators then massed in front of
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich to
demand that striking medical workers
be given their paychecks before the 3
p.m. time set by Rich.
While the demonstrators clapped
and shouted, "Pay now!" outside the
office, Asst. Dean Richard Balch
agreed inside to speed up the paycheck
delivery by about an hour. The
strikers' checks were distributed from
tables set up in front of the Medical
Center.
Balch said the paycheck delay,
which affected some 115 workers
participating in the walkout, was
caused mainly by the curtailment of
interdepartmental mail service. Gadus
had claimed that since banks close at 3
p.m., withholding the checks until
then might cause financial hardship for
some workers.
No Incidents
Before they reached the Medical
Center, the marchers passed without
incident by University President
Richard Lyman's office, and then on
to the physics tank and the
Computation Center.
The demonstrators were greeted
enthusiastically by USE pickets whom
they passed, but all the pickets
appeared to be observing the court
order by pairing off in front of all

entrances.
At Bonair Siding yesterday
morning, USE President Jim Berk
overturned a table during an argument
with Plant Services director Dan
DeYoung over paycheck distribution.
The table had been used in the
handing out of paychecks to striking
Plant Services employees.
The controversy erupted after
DeYoung authorized paycheck
distribution behind USE picket lines
during the morning. "I made a
commitment to the people in Plant
Services" to hand out the paychecks in
the morning, DeYoung said.
'Neutral Territory'
Berk claimed that DeYoung had
acted contrary to an agreement by the
University to distribute paychecks in
"neutral territory." He said he "blew
up" after DeYoung worked out a
compromise check distribution
agreement with individual striking
workers rather than with the union.
He said his table-overturning
gesture was "like Christ clearing the
table." The paychecks had been
removed from the table before Berk
dumped it.
A spokesman at the University's
Operations Center described the day as
"quite peaceful" and declared that
"nothing significant" had occurred. He
cited "isolated reports of nails in the
road" or around the tires of University
vehicles as the only strike-related
complaints of the day.
DeYoung reported that the air had
been let out of the tires of 15 Plant
Services vehicles.
(The Daily yesterday reported
incorrectly that a tractor-trailer
containing nitroglycerin was escorted
through picket lines at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center by deputies.
The truck contained liquid nitrogen,
not nitroglycerin.)
