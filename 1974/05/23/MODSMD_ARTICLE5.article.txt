# Senate Approves Nominations
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The ASSU Senate voted
unanimously to approve the
recommendations of the ASSU
Nominations Committee after several
hours of discussion Monday night.
Much of the discussion centered on
the role of the Nominations
Committee and its relationship to the
Senate. Some senators reportedly did
not want to "rubber stamp" the
Committee's nominees. "It took some
senators some time to adjust to the
idea [that by having a Nominations
Committee] they were appointing
someone to take their place," said
Rocky Barber, now in his fifth year as
senator.
Barber pointed out that the Senate
"goes through this hassle every year"
and ends up approving the
Nominations Committee's report
anyway. He attributed this to the high
turnover in the Senate, which results

in many new senators every year.
The Senate did pass a
recommendation advising future
members of the Nominations
Committee against putting themselves
on committees "without substantial
reason," Barber said. In addition, a
recommendation was made that a
grievance procedure be devised so that
those who felt they had justified
complaints would have someplace to
go.
Mike Herman, Nominations
Committee chairman and ASSU
president, said a grievance committee
would be "unfeasible, considering the
number of applicants [for
committees], and inappropriate,
considering the responsibility of the
Nominations Committee."
The formation of a grievance
committee, said Herman, would
indicate that the Senate was not
putting much trust in the Nominations

Committee. If that were the case,
Herman asked, "What's the purpose of
having a Nominations Committee at
all?"
Senate Chairman Reggie Turner
said he thought the Nominations
Committee had done a "superb job"
overall, but suspected that there had
been "some oversights and possibly
some political dealing" in the
Nominations Committee procedures.
He noted there were no graduate
students appointed to the Committee
on Services to Students, one of the
graduate students' means of
expression.
He wondered why there were so
many committee members without
experience and thought that some
candidates with experience had been
overlooked.
Turner predicted that some of the
nominations would eventually come
under question by President Lyman.
