## Spitters Stresses Diverse Qualifications 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Laurence Spitters claims that the nation's
economic problems are so acute that a
congressman must be both a businessman and a
lawyer if he is to grapple with them.
Spitters, the former owner of Memorex Corp.
and holder of degrees in law and business, insists
that he is the only candidate in the 12th
Congressional District who has the expertise
needed for the job.
Spitters told the Daily yesterday he believes
he will win the June 4 Democratic primary
because he has addressed himself more to the
issues than his three opponents.
Spitters noted that his own poll shows Santa
Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor winning 22 percent
of the vote, himself taking 12 percent, Palo Alto
attorney Thomas Skornia garnering three
percent and Stanford employment
representative Herbert Rhodes with negligible
support.
The high percentage of uncommitted voters
indicates that the race is still wide open, Spitters
noted. "Gillmor is clearly the front runner but I
believe I can catch up."
Supported District-Wide
Spitters claimed he is the only candidate with
support throughout the district. Gillmor's
strength is centered almost entirely in Santa
Clara, he explained.
Noting that he has appeared on the Stanford
campus several times, he said he would return
whenever he is invited.
Spitters claimed he could win in the general
election against either Atherton businessman J.
Gordon Knapp or Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,

R-Menlo Park, the leading contenders in the
GOP primary.
"McCloskey has strong support but the peace
issue can no longer serve to attract votes,"
Spitters said. "He must now predicate his
campaign on social concerns, and he has shown
an absence of clear positions on everything from
national health to migratory labor.
"McCloskey has never enunciated liberal
principles. If the Democrats were given a
reasonable alternative to him in the general
election, I don't believe that the Democrats
would leave the vote for McCloskey as many
have done in the past."
Economic Issues
Spitters said he was basing his campaign on
economic issues, especially the need to stop
inflation while expanding social welfare
measures.
"There is an extraordinary misallocation of
federal funds," Spitters stated. "We have an
egregious situation where there is a widening gap
between the privileged and the underprivileged
in this nation."
Spitters said the first step toward restoring a
healthier economy would be to return power to
Congress in the formulation of the budget.
"Congress has been happily irresponsible in
allowing the executive branch of the
government the power to formulate the federal
budget," Spitters said. "We can no longer
tolerate this situation."
Spitters said he favors a balanced budget, but
does not oppose deficit spending in certain
years. He emphasized that the defense budget
could be cut considerably without injuring the

nation's security.
The government could spend the money it
saved on defense spending for education, health,
housing and revenue sharing, Spitters explained.
Stop Inflation
Noting that wage and price controls as a
temporary solution for curbing inflation "are
very much in order," he said that Congress
should investigate ways of stopping inflation in
the long run.
He also advocated congressional investigation
of alternate energy sources.
Spitters said he favors the oil depletion
allowance, but opposes the way it has been
implemented.
"I fear an oil depletion allowance that
doesn't allow the oil producers to avail
themselves of its benefits unless they replace the
oil they use with reserves."
Lamenting the "unfortunate preoccupation
of the campaign with impeachment of Nixon,
Spitters said he nevertheless considers the issue
important.
He said he favors impeaching the President
for having breached the public trust, noting that
historical precedent does not require that
impeachment be based on criminal acts. But he
emphasized that he believes Nixon is guilty of
criminal activities.
Calling himself a strong advocate of women's
rights, Spitters said if he were elected to
Congress he would promote equal hiring
practices in the federal government.
Spitters said he would spend $25,000 of his
own money in the campaign — the legal limit
under 1971 federal reform legislation.

LAURENCE SPITTERS
Laurence Spitters claims that the nation's
economic problems are so acute that a
congressman must be both a businessman and a
lawyer if he is to grapple with them.
Spitters, the former owner of Memorex Corp.
and holder of degrees in law and business, insists
that he is the only candidate in the 12th
Congressional District who has the expertise
needed for the job.
Spitters told the Daily yesterday he believes
he will win the June 4 Democratic primary
because he has addressed himself more to the
issues than his three opponents.
Spitters noted that his own poll shows Santa
Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor winning 22 percent
of the vote, himself taking 12 percent, Palo Alto
attorney Thomas Skornia garnering three
percent and Stanford employment
representative Herbert Rhodes with negligible
support.
The high percentage of uncommitted voters
indicates that the race is still wide open, Spitters
noted. "Gillmor is clearly the front runner but I
believe I can catch up."
Supported District-Wide
Spitters claimed he is the only candidate with
support throughout the district. Gillmor's
strength is centered almost entirely in Santa
Clara, he explained.
Noting that he has appeared on the Stanford
campus several times, he said he would return
whenever he is invited.
Spitters claimed he could win in the general
election against either Atherton businessman J.
Gordon Knapp or Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,

R-Menlo Park, the leading contenders in the
GOP primary.
"McCloskey has strong support but the peace
issue can no longer serve to attract votes,"
Spitters said. "He must now predicate his
campaign on social concerns, and he has shown
an absence of clear positions on everything from
national health to migratory labor.
"McCloskey has never enunciated liberal
principles. If the Democrats were given a
reasonable alternative to him in the general
election, I don't believe that the Democrats
would leave the vote for McCloskey as many
have done in the past."
Economic Issues
Spitters said he was basing his campaign on
economic issues, especially the need to stop
inflation while expanding social welfare
measures.
"There is an extraordinary misallocation of
federal funds," Spitters stated. "We have an
egregious situation where there is a widening gap
between the privileged and the underprivileged
in this nation."
Spitters said the first step toward restoring a
healthier economy would be to return power to
Congress in the formulation of the budget.
"Congress has been happily irresponsible in
allowing the executive branch of the
government the power to formulate the federal
budget," Spitters said. "We can no longer
tolerate this situation."
Spitters said he favors a balanced budget, but
does not oppose deficit spending in certain
years. He emphasized that the defense budget
could be cut considerably without injuring the

nation's security.
The government could spend the money it
saved on defense spending for education, health,
housing and revenue sharing, Spitters explained.
Stop Inflation
Noting that wage and price controls as a
temporary solution for curbing inflation "are
very much in order," he said that Congress
should investigate ways of stopping inflation in
the long run.
He also advocated congressional investigation
of alternate energy sources.
Spitters said he favors the oil depletion
allowance, but opposes the way it has been
implemented.
"I fear an oil depletion allowance that
doesn't allow the oil producers to avail
themselves of its benefits unless they replace the
oil they use with reserves."
Lamenting the "unfortunate preoccupation

Spitters said he nevertheless considers the issue
