Restore Community Spirit
Editor:
As the strike continues, we
watch with great concern the
growing hostility between the
workers and the administration.
The negotiations move slowly or
not at all as the rest of the
Stanford community suffers
irritation and tries to figure out
what position to take.
We believe the strike is
damaging to whatever sense of
community can be found at
Stanford. We feel that in the past
the sense of community has been
hampered by the inferior status of
the workers.
To alleviate this friction we call
upon the administration to
substantially improve its offer
because we believe it is in the
interest of Stanford to establish a
real sense of community that
includes its workers.
Without a satisfactory
agreement, a decrease in the
quality of work might well
accompany the alienation that the
workers would naturally feel.

There is something faintly
reminiscent of the good old
confrontation days in the current
strike.
First a manufactured grievance
or two. Then a list of
non-negotiable demands. Then
indignation when an intransigent
administration fails to give in.
Then the declaration that "we
have no choice but to strike
[sit-in]."
Then recruitment campaigns in
the dorms, angry rhetoric,
simplistic slogans, pledges of
support from miniscule groups,
the impugning of the integrity and
morality of those who disagree or
refuse to "join the struggle" and
dishonest or distorted statements.
Now we have the harassment
of those who freely choose to
continue working, and the
inevitable sabotage. Inevitable
because USE is a spin-off of the
radical movement, with leaders
who think in terms of
intimidation and coercion rather
than reason.
That leadership appears to be
motivated far more by a desire to
damage the University than by a
desire to improve the conditions
for employees. The workers are
being used as tools in that process,
just as students were several years
ago.

Editor:
Several students have written
to the Daily recently regarding the
USE strike, expressing their
concern that increased wages will
result in increased tuition. A
number of these students have
suggested that the workers who
are dissatisifed should seek jobs
elsewhere. Have any of these
students considered the full
implication of their comments?
We employees are, as
taxpayers, already supporting a
first class public university and
college system. Students who ask
us to keep their tuition down by
accepting lower wages are asking
us to subsidize their education at
a private university, which they
have presumably selected over a
state school because it offers
certain "aesthetic values."
Do not we, as workers, have as
legitimate a right to ask the
students who cannot afford to
pay a higher tuition at Stanford to
seek admission to a less expensive
school? I feel that many students
have not considered that there is
another side to the issue.
A second consideration which
many students have failed to
appreciate is this: despite the
media's repeated use of the term

"maintenance workers" a great
many members of the bargaining
unit, and of the non-unit
personnel who are out in support
of the strike, are highly qualified
technical personnel. Further,
there are clerical and technical
non-unit persons who are
reporting to work but are
supporting the strike financially.
These people are well qualified
and highly employable.
Many of us feel that the
"aesthetic" values of working at
Stanford no longer offset the
negative features. Unless there is
an improvement in conditions we
can and will find other jobs. The
students should be aware that if
the best qualified personnel go
elsewhere, leaving the least
employable to staff the
University, it will ultimately be
the students and the quality of
their environment which suffer.

Defensive Hostility
Editor:
We would like to recount an
incident which occurred in the
Zeta Psi fraternity house last
Wednesday night.
Every night last week,
Columbae House, headquarters
for students in support of the
USE strike, has put out
informational leaflets for
distribution in dormitories. On
Wednesday night we were
leafletting the fraternity clusters,
and we entered the Zete house.
Here, we were first politely
asked to post the leaflets only on
the house bulletin board, because
otherwise the papers would "end
up all over the floor." We began
to do so, when another house
member demanded to know what
we were putting up.
Upon hearing that it was strike
literature, he ordered us not to
post it, and said that if we did he
would "rip it down." He said,
"Neither of you is welcome here,"
because the house was "on the
side of the University." He added
that "35 scabbers" lived in the
house.
Does this hostile member
represent the fraternity? If so, and
if the Zetes are so sure of their
position, why are they so
frightened of information from
the other side? We would like to
hear from the Zetes as a whole.
Hostility implies defensiveness.

I am a member of the Class of
'71. My earnings have only
recently become great enough for
me to consider donations to
institutions I believe in. For the
fine education and fond memories
I acquired at Stanford University,
I am eager to assist my alma mater
in continuing its educational
tradition.
With great consternation I am
reading of the Stanford
administration's stand on the USE
demands. I thoroughly agree with
the workers, in their request for
wages and benefits that will allow
them to meet rising living costs.
Stanford's hard line response
seems both pathetic and vicious:
pathetic, considering how
progressive and sensitive Stanford
represents itself to be in areas of
social evolution; vicious, in
keeping its workers from a decent
living standard.
For this reason, I regret that I
cannot consider becoming a donor
to alumni funds, and I shall urge
my former classmates to refrain
likewise, until the University
meets its responsibility to the
workers who maintain it.
It is with eagerness that I await

strike.
First a manufactured grievance
or two. Then a list of
non-negotiable demands. Then
indignation when an intransigent
administration fails to give in.
Then the declaration that "we

[sit-in]."
Then recruitment campaigns in
the dorms, angry rhetoric,
simplistic slogans, pledges of
support from miniscule groups,
the impugning of the integrity and
morality of those who disagree or
refuse to "join the struggle" and
dishonest or distorted statements.
Now we have the harassment
of those who freely choose to
continue working, and the
inevitable sabotage. Inevitable
because USE is a spin-off of the
radical movement, with leaders
who think in terms of
intimidation and coercion rather
than reason.
That leadership appears to be
motivated far more by a desire to
damage the University than by a
desire to improve the conditions
for employees. The workers are
being used as tools in that process,
just as students were several years

Several students have written
to the Daily recently regarding the
USE strike, expressing their
concern that increased wages will
result in increased tuition. A
number of these students have
suggested that the workers who
are dissatisifed should seek jobs
elsewhere. Have any of these
students considered the full
implication of their comments?
We employees are, as
taxpayers, already supporting a
first class public university and
college system. Students who ask
us to keep their tuition down by
accepting lower wages are asking
us to subsidize their education at
a private university, which they
have presumably selected over a
state school because it offers
certain "aesthetic values."
Do not we, as workers, have as
legitimate a right to ask the
students who cannot afford to
pay a higher tuition at Stanford to
seek admission to a less expensive
school? I feel that many students
have not considered that there is
another side to the issue.
A second consideration which
many students have failed to
appreciate is this: despite the
media's repeated use of the term

"maintenance workers" a great
many members of the bargaining
unit, and of the non-unit
personnel who are out in support
of the strike, are highly qualified
technical personnel. Further,
there are clerical and technical
non-unit persons who are
reporting to work but are
supporting the strike financially.
These people are well qualified
and highly employable.
Many of us feel that the
"aesthetic" values of working at
Stanford no longer offset the
negative features. Unless there is
an improvement in conditions we
can and will find other jobs. The
students should be aware that if
the best qualified personnel go
elsewhere, leaving the least
employable to staff the
University, it will ultimately be
the students and the quality of
their environment which suffer.

Defensive Hostility
Editor:
We would like to recount an
incident which occurred in the
Zeta Psi fraternity house last
Wednesday night.
Every night last week,
Columbae House, headquarters
for students in support of the
USE strike, has put out
informational leaflets for
distribution in dormitories. On
Wednesday night we were
leafletting the fraternity clusters,
and we entered the Zete house.
Here, we were first politely
asked to post the leaflets only on
the house bulletin board, because
otherwise the papers would "end
up all over the floor." We began
to do so, when another house
member demanded to know what
we were putting up.
Upon hearing that it was strike
literature, he ordered us not to
post it, and said that if we did he
would "rip it down." He said,
"Neither of you is welcome here,"
because the house was "on the
side of the University." He added
that "35 scabbers" lived in the
house.
Does this hostile member
represent the fraternity? If so, and
if the Zetes are so sure of their
position, why are they so
frightened of information from
the other side? We would like to
hear from the Zetes as a whole.
Hostility implies defensiveness.

irritation and tries to figure out
what position to take.
We believe the strike is
damaging to whatever sense of
community can be found at
Stanford. We feel that in the past
the sense of community has been
hampered by the inferior status of
the workers.
To alleviate this friction we call
upon the administration to
substantially improve its offer

Strike And Confrontation
Editor: ,
There is something faintly
reminiscent of the good old
confrontation days in the current
strike.
First a manufactured grievance
or two. Then a list of
non-negotiable demands. Then
indignation when an intransigent
administration fails to give in.
Then the declaration that "we
have no choice but to strike
[sit-in]."
Then recruitment campaigns in
the dorms, angry rhetoric,
simplistic slogans, pledges of
support from miniscule groups,
the impugning of the integrity and
morality of those who disagree or
refuse to "join the struggle" and
dishonest or distorted statements.
Now we have the harassment
of those who freely choose to
continue working, and the
inevitable sabotage. Inevitable
because USE is a spin-off of the
radical movement, with leaders
who think in terms of
intimidation and coercion rather
than reason.
That leadership appears to be
motivated far more by a desire to
damage the University than by a
desire to improve the conditions
for employees. The workers are
being used as tools in that process,
just as students were several years
ago.

If Employees Leave
Editor:
Several students have written
to the Daily recently regarding the
USE strike, expressing their
concern that increased wages will
result in increased tuition. A
number of these students have
suggested that the workers who
are dissatisifed should seek jobs
elsewhere. Have any of these
students considered the full
implication of their comments?
We employees are, as
taxpayers, already supporting a
first class public university and
college system. Students who ask
us to keep their tuition down by
accepting lower wages are asking
us to subsidize their education at
a private university, which they
have presumably selected over a
state school because it offers
certain "aesthetic values."
Do not we, as workers, have as
legitimate a right to ask the
students who cannot afford to
pay a higher tuition at Stanford to
seek admission to a less expensive
school? I feel that many students
have not considered that there is
another side to the issue.
A second consideration which
many students have failed to
appreciate is this: despite the
media's repeated use of the term

"maintenance workers" a great
many members of the bargaining
unit, and of the non-unit
personnel who are out in support
of the strike, are highly qualified
technical personnel. Further,
there are clerical and technical
non-unit persons who are
reporting to work but are
supporting the strike financially.
These people are well qualified
and highly employable.
Many of us feel that the
"aesthetic" values of working at
Stanford no longer offset the
negative features. Unless there is
an improvement in conditions we
can and will find other jobs. The
students should be aware that if
the best qualified personnel go
elsewhere, leaving the least
employable to staff the
University, it will ultimately be
the students and the quality of
their environment which suffer.

Defensive Hostility
Editor:
We would like to recount an
incident which occurred in the
Zeta Psi fraternity house last
Wednesday night.
Every night last week,
Columbae House, headquarters
for students in support of the
USE strike, has put out
informational leaflets for
distribution in dormitories. On
Wednesday night we were
leafletting the fraternity clusters,
and we entered the Zete house.
Here, we were first politely
asked to post the leaflets only on
the house bulletin board, because
otherwise the papers would "end
up all over the floor." We began
to do so, when another house
member demanded to know what
we were putting up.
Upon hearing that it was strike
literature, he ordered us not to
post it, and said that if we did he
would "rip it down." He said,
"Neither of you is welcome here,"
because the house was "on the
side of the University." He added
that "35 scabbers" lived in the
house.
Does this hostile member
represent the fraternity? If so, and
if the Zetes are so sure of their
position, why are they so
frightened of information from
the other side? We would like to
hear from the Zetes as a whole.
Hostility implies defensiveness.

I am a member of the Class of

recently become great enough for
me to consider donations to
institutions I believe in. For the
fine education and fond memories
I acquired at Stanford University,
I am eager to assist my alma mater

tradition.
With great consternation I am
reading of the Stanford
administration's stand on the USE
demands. I thoroughly agree with
the workers, in their request for
wages and benefits that will allow
them to meet rising living costs.
Stanford's hard line response
seems both pathetic and vicious:
pathetic, considering how
progressive and sensitive Stanford
represents itself to be in areas of
social evolution; vicious, in
keeping its workers from a decent
living standard.
For this reason, I regret that I
cannot consider becoming a donor
to alumni funds, and I shall urge
my former classmates to refrain
likewise, until the University
meets its responsibility to the
workers who maintain it.
It is with eagerness that I await
