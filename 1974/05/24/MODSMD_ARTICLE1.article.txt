# Senate Votes To Approve Report Items

### DON COX 
The Faculty Senate approved two
major items in the Report on the
Professoriate which will help to
formalize the structure of the faculty
body.
The Senate passed without dissent a
provision to create an Adjunct
Professoriate consisting of all current
members of the Academic Council
designated senior lecturers and senior
resesrch associates. The new rank will
also include the clinical line of the
Medical School.
Faculty representatives also passed
a Senate charter revision providing for
mail balloting in Academic Council
decisions where Senate ruling might be
overturned.
Prior to the Senate's vote, there was
committee of the whole discussion
concerning provisions which limited
the size of the adjunct professoriate.
Arbitrary Limit?
Engineering Dean William Kays
expressed concern about setting an
arbitrary number limit on the adjunct
professoriate since "engineering
research is changing fast. . . and the
senior research associate position is an
effective way to promote research."
After the Senate came out of the
Committee of the Committee of the
Whole, Provost William Miller noted
that there "was a conflict between the
need for protection and flexibility"
but he said that the language of the
items had built in both in appropriate
degrees.
The Senate then dissolved again
into the Committee of the Whole and
members became engaged in a very
lively debate over the fourth, fifth and
sixth items in the Professoriate report.
Committee Rules
Committee of the Whole rules
prohibit the attribution of remarks to
Senate members without their
permission of the recording of the
exact tally in straw votes.
Debate centered around the fourth
item which provides that each
department develop a five-year plan
indicating the number of faculty
positions that should open in the five
years.
The plan would be approved by the
dean of the appropriate school and the
provost and reviewed annually. It
would be made known to the
department faculty.
Human Biology Prof. Colin
Pittendrigh said that the item would
eliminate much of the uncertainty in
the minds of the junior faculty with
regard to tenure decisions. He added

that the University should have a
greater degree of planning in its tenure
system as Harvard does.
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch
led the opposition against the item. "It
is a mechanism which has enormous
implications and as many problems as
advantages," said Dornbusch.
He said there would be major
competition among departments to get
the maximum number of positions.
Dornbusch concluded that it would be
best to leave the power with the deans
and the administration.
Religious Studies Chairman William
Clebsch said there was nothing new
about the item and tha he already
practiced such a procedure in his
department. The only difference
would be that the departmental
faculty would know about it.
Pittendrigh warned that at the
present rate of tenure conferation, 100
percent of the faculty would soon be
tenured. "There has to be at some
level an allocation of resources. It is a
problem of billet control," he said.
He said there was a myth that
"every member who is good enough to
get tenure will. This is not the fact."
