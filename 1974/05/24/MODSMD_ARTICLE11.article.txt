# Meet Demands, But Limit Tuition
##

Steven Sotos' letter of May 21 is
appalling. But I think an analysis of what he
writes could be instructive.
Sotos begins by suggesting that if the
workers aren't happy here they can just go
somewhere else and work. Leaving the
realities of life behind, it is certainly true that
a worker is always free to quit one job and
find another.
But immediate financial need, the
threatened loss of seniority and benefits and
the very real uncertainties of the job market,
all can trap a worker in an inadequate job.
Sotos gives implicit, if perverse,
recognition to this fact when he remarks that
the only reason that Stanford workers don't
leave is that they are either too enamored
with lovely Stanford or can't find high wages
elsewhere.
Workers 'Stupidly Content'?
The thought here if I am not mistaken is
that the workers are either stupidly content
with an exploitative situation or are too
stupid to qualify for a better job elsewhere.
In either case they get what they deserve.
Sotos' second complaint is that USE has
yet to come up with satisfactory proof that
increased wages for workers will not entail
higher tuition for students. Let us begin by
recalling that it is the University
administration that sets tuition costs and not
the union leadership.
Furthermore, workers' wages and
students' tuition are not linked by any
natural law. It is the conscious decisions of
University administrators that determines
both values.

This is not to say that the University does
not have a more or less limited budget within
which to work. Nor is this to deny that the
administrators would be perfectly delighted
to see Stanford undergraduates discover a
new law of economics: the inverse
proportionality of workers' wages and
students' tuition.
The temptation will be strong to drive this
lesson in the new economics home with a
whopping increase in tution that will be sure
to drive a wedge into worker-student
solidarity for the next half-decade.
How are we to address ourselves, though,
to the situation in which the University has
admittedly limited resources, the workers are
demanding higher wages and benefits and
students are suffering from the ridiculously
high tuition?
Stanford Highly Endowed
Stanford is one of the most highly
endowed universities in the country. But of
course, what it has, it spends. So it is always
poor. What we are dealing with, then, is the
allottment of money.
I happen to believe that good wages,
working conditions and benefits for Stanford
workers is of higher priority than the exotic
research and elaborate construction projects
in which the University indulges. To look at
some of the architecture on campus and then
reflect on the niggardliness of the
admistraion vis a vis the workers is frankly
sickening.
Don't Divert Funds
Am I suggesting then that funds be
diverted from construction and research

projects to pay workers' wages? Not quite.
Many grants and endowments which enter
into the University's total financial resources
are earmarked for use in particular projects.
That money simply cannot be diverted. One
can well imagine that a typical benefactor of
the University is not disposed to earmark his
money for payment of workers' wages. The
University's priorities are, then, only a
reflection of the priorities of the monied
classes which support it.
This is why pressure must be brought to
bear, why the workers must unionize and
strike to make the University take account of
them. Only when the workers simultaneously
demand higher wages and benefits and the
students, united, refuse to pay higher tuition
will University fund-raisers be forced to seek
out money, a percentage of which is
earmarked for people, rather than for things
to which plaques can be attached.
Sotos concludes his letter with a remark
that we really don't need the workers
anyway. If they are going to be nasty and
unpleasant they can just go home. We can get
along without them.
You speak, Steven, like a true son of the
ruling class. You and people like you have
had everthing served to you on a silver
platter. You have never had a notion of
where what you have comes from. You might
consider that what you have consumed in
your days represents more hours of labor
than you have been alive.
