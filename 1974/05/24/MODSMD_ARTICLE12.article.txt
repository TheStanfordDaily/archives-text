# Return Post Office To Government

Maybe you saw it in the paper.
A Roy Baker in Guthrie, Okla.
received a Christmas card recently
in April, 1974. It had only eight
cents postage on it, so the Post
Office demanded two cents more,
inasmuch as letter postage is now
10 cents.
But get this: The card wasn't
mailed last Christmas — it was
mailed more than two years ago
on Dec. 20, 1971. Under the
circumstances, a person would
have thought the Post Office
would recognize that it owed
Baker an apology, if nothing
more. But no, it exacted its two
cents extra postage.
Do you know something? I
don't think I'd have paid it. I
think I'd have told them a thing
or two.
This is just the latest of a
growing collection of "horror
stories" about our postal system
since it was taken over by a
private corporation. My files are
bulging with stories of late mail,
misdirected mail, returned letters
when the address was perfectly
correct, and other foul-ups by the
new "business-managed" postal
service.
American Public Bugged
The idea in putting the Post
Office under private business was
to introduce efficient business
methods, new equipment to sort
and bundle mail by machine,
sophisticated computers — all the
things, indeed, that have begun to
bug the American public in its
dealings with computerized
businesses.
Another thing in that little
story about the late Christmas
card reflects a growing trend.
Baker was asked why he didn't
make an issue of paying the two
cents, when obviously the Post
Office was at fault. He said he was
afraid to make too big an issue of

it:"I may never get any more
mail."
People, it seems, have come to
expect retaliation when they
complain of an injustice. A sad
commentary on our times!
Wants PO Return
You may know that I have
introduced a bill, HR 11449, to
return the Post Office to the
United States government. I
decided we had given the postal
corporation a fair chance, and it
was showing no signs of ever
doing better.
Its sophisticated equipment, its
new-style post offices, its
complicated routing schemes had
all failed to deliver. And the
morale in the Post Office was at a
new low.
Apparently a lot of other
people felt the same way about it.

I have hardly ever introduced a
piece of legislation that received a
warmer, more enthusiastic
response. Many wrote to me from
our own district, but letters also
came from all over the country
thanking me and wanting to know
how to help get the bill passed.
Enactment Doubted
The bill was referred to the
House Committee on Post Office
and Civil Service under the
chairmanship of Rep. Thaddeus J.
Dulski, D-N.Y. I have been
assured by the chairman of the
appropriate subcommittees that
they do plan to act upon some
postal reform legislation this
session.
In all candor, I doubt that my
bill will be enacted. The
introduction of that measure,
however, has helped convince

other congressmen postal reform
legislation is needed.
As for what you might do to
help, you may wish to write to
"Hon. Thaddeus J. Dulski,
Chairman, House Committee on
Post Office and Civil Service."
You can address him merely at
the House Office Building,
Washington, D.C. 20515. If
enough people write — and the
letters get delivered — perhaps the
Committee will realize that the
American people are fed up with
slow mail service, lost letters,
letters returned for no reason,
damaged parcels — and the gall of
a corporation that charges two
cents extra for a Christmas card
that is delivered more than two
years late!

received a Christmas card recently
in April, 1974. It had only eight
cents postage on it, so the Post
Office demanded two cents more,
inasmuch as letter postage is now
10 cents.
But get this: The card wasn't
mailed last Christmas — it was
mailed more than two years ago
on Dec. 20, 1971. Under the
circumstances, a person would
have thought the Post Office
would recognize that it owed
Baker an apology, if nothing
more. But no, it exacted its two
cents extra postage.
Do you know something? I
don't think I'd have paid it. I
think I'd have told them a thing
or two.
This is just the latest of a
growing collection of "horror
stories" about our postal system
since it was taken over by a
private corporation. My files are
bulging with stories of late mail,
misdirected mail, returned letters
when the address was perfectly
correct, and other foul-ups by the
new "business-managed" postal
service.
American Public Bugged
The idea in putting the Post
Office under private business was
to introduce efficient business
methods, new equipment to sort
and bundle mail by machine,
sophisticated computers — all the
things, indeed, that have begun to
bug the American public in its
dealings with computerized
businesses.
Another thing in that little
story about the late Christmas
card reflects a growing trend.
Baker was asked why he didn't
make an issue of paying the two
cents, when obviously the Post
Office was at fault. He said he was
afraid to make too big an issue of

it:"I may never get any more
mail."
People, it seems, have come to
expect retaliation when they
complain of an injustice. A sad
commentary on our times!
Wants PO Return
You may know that I have
introduced a bill, HR 11449, to
return the Post Office to the
United States government. I
decided we had given the postal
corporation a fair chance, and it
was showing no signs of ever
doing better.
Its sophisticated equipment, its
new-style post offices, its
complicated routing schemes had
all failed to deliver. And the
morale in the Post Office was at a
new low.
Apparently a lot of other
people felt the same way about it.

I have hardly ever introduced a
piece of legislation that received a
warmer, more enthusiastic
response. Many wrote to me from
our own district, but letters also
came from all over the country
thanking me and wanting to know
how to help get the bill passed.
Enactment Doubted
The bill was referred to the
House Committee on Post Office
and Civil Service under the
chairmanship of Rep. Thaddeus J.
Dulski, D-N.Y. I have been
assured by the chairman of the
appropriate subcommittees that
they do plan to act upon some
postal reform legislation this
session.
In all candor, I doubt that my
bill will be enacted. The
introduction of that measure,
however, has helped convince

other congressmen postal reform
legislation is needed.
As for what you might do to
help, you may wish to write to
"Hon. Thaddeus J. Dulski,
Chairman, House Committee on
Post Office and Civil Service."
You can address him merely at
the House Office Building,
Washington, D.C. 20515. If
enough people write — and the
letters get delivered — perhaps the
Committee will realize that the
American people are fed up with
slow mail service, lost letters,
letters returned for no reason,
damaged parcels — and the gall of
a corporation that charges two
cents extra for a Christmas card
that is delivered more than two
years late!
