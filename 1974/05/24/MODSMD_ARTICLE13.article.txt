# Vote Roth For Governor

Michael Intrilligator, Bella Berg

Shortly after the present California State
Administration took office, citizens of this state,
together with students and faculty members of the
state colleges and universities, formed a statewide
organization called Citizens for California Higher
Education (CCHE). Their goal was to educate the
public, the state legislature, and the administration
to support the following:
1. Adequate financing for quality higher
education.
2. Maintain the tradition of tuition-free higher
education.
3. Responsible participation by faculty and
students in the government of the state universities
and colleges.
4. Higher education system free of political
influence.
During the period this organization was active,
one Regent, William Matson Roth, strongly and

actively supported the organization and its goals.
At the time of this upheaval in our higher
education system, the San Francisco Chronicle
described William Roth as "a voice of reason in a
time of great crisis."
Seven years have passed. We now have a chance
to nominate a candidate for governor on June 4
who is not a "Johnny come lately" to a position
regarding higher education. We know where he
stands. We have a chance.
There is one man whose integrity, independence
and experience can help bring back to California
the educational standards we have lost. That man is
William Matson Roth.
We, the undersigned, as some of the original
organizers of the Citizens group, strongly support
William Roth's candidacy and urge that you join
with us now!
(Michael Intrilligator and liclla licrg are members of
CCHE.)
