Stop Pet Slaughter
Editor:
Pet owners can move now to
stop mass slaughter of dogs and
cats. Thousands of healthy,
appealing surplus dogs and cats
are being killed each week at
pounds and animal shelters. This
killing goes on all year, and each
spring it is stepped up to keep
pace with the spring births of
puppies and kittens.
How can this killing be
prevented? Spaying and neutering
is the answer! A visit to the local
animal shelter where one sees the
desperate, eager faces of the many
pets waiting on death row should
convince anyone of the need to
spay and neuter pets.
There is no excuse for allowing
one's pet to breed a litter when
there are beautiful dogs and cats,
puppies and kittens already
waiting in vain for homes that do
not exist. It's not cute anymore to
let mama cat or dog have a litter
for the children to see.
All pet owners can now afford
spaying and neutering at one of
the fine low cost spay and neuter
clinics. The City of Palo Alto and
the County of Santa Clara both
offer low cost spaying and
neutering, and the City of Palo
Alto's Spay and Neuter Clinic is
open to all pet owners no matter
where they live.
The solution to our animal
control problems rests squarely in
the hands of pet owners.

My name is Willis L.
Higginbotham. I am a 27-year-old
"Leo" male, and I am presently in
carcerated at the London
Correctional Institution, at
London, Ohio. I am writing this
letter to you as an agent of appeal
for correspondence and
friendship; and I ask that you will
be so kind as to publish this
appeal in your newspaper.
Loneliness in a place like this is
very much like that of a quiet
drama, which keeps building and
building seemingly without an
end.
The experience of such a
feeling is almost unbearable. I
have no wish to continue to be
swallowed by that which appears
to be a vacuum of emptiness; nor
do I wish to remain just the faint
echo of a hidden shadow.
In a desperate effort to emerge
from the internal prison of lost
despair, I have written you this
letter in an attempt to re-acquaint
myself with the outside world,
and to become associated in a
more honest and valid relationship
of others as well as in myself.
My interests are many, my
pleasures are few, and my hopes
are that someone will respond to
my request for moral, spiritual
and intellectual communication.
In closing, I would like to say
that I believe, I really do believe
that whenever you can share a
smile, a tear or a thought with a
stranger, then you are strangers no
longe*.
I wish to thank you in advance.
Thank you.

A brief comment to Diane
Spicer (Daily, May 22) who
wonders how pickets would feel if
they had relatives dying of
leukemia, or needed an emergency
operation.
Over and over, the union, in
consultation with its medical
advisory panel has declared that
there was NO emergency linen
problem. This was later confirmed
by Peter Carpenter himself:
"We've never been in better
shape."
And regarding the leukemia: I
can only respond that my mother
was in such a state in St. Louis in
1970 and there was a hospital
workers strike in progress. A very
peculiar thing happened — the
professional staff became
noticeably more concerned with
the patients' emotional needs, and
the relatives were far more upset
than the patients. It was my
mother, who was so keenly aware
of the service that the
"non-professionals" had given to
her, that made the rest of us see
that if striking was the only way
they could get "food and rent"
then, so be it.
I guess it's all in how you look
at it. I would also like to conclude
with a question for Spicer,
considering how often this whole
hospital brouhaha has been aired
in print — are you not hearing
what we are saying, because we
are not saying what you want to
hear?

My name is Willis L.
Higginbotham. I am a 27-year-old
"Leo" male, and I am presently in
carcerated at the London
Correctional Institution, at
London, Ohio. I am writing this
letter to you as an agent of appeal
for correspondence and
friendship; and I ask that you will
be so kind as to publish this
appeal in your newspaper.
Loneliness in a place like this is
very much like that of a quiet
drama, which keeps building and
building seemingly without an
end.
The experience of such a
feeling is almost unbearable. I
have no wish to continue to be
swallowed by that which appears
to be a vacuum of emptiness; nor
do I wish to remain just the faint
echo of a hidden shadow.
In a desperate effort to emerge
from the internal prison of lost
despair, I have written you this
letter in an attempt to re-acquaint
myself with the outside world,
and to become associated in a
more honest and valid relationship
of others as well as in myself.
My interests are many, my
pleasures are few, and my hopes
are that someone will respond to
my request for moral, spiritual
and intellectual communication.
In closing, I would like to say
that I believe, I really do believe
that whenever you can share a
smile, a tear or a thought with a
stranger, then you are strangers no
longe*.
I wish to thank you in advance.
Thank you.

A brief comment to Diane
Spicer (Daily, May 22) who
wonders how pickets would feel if
they had relatives dying of
leukemia, or needed an emergency
operation.
Over and over, the union, in
consultation with its medical
advisory panel has declared that
there was NO emergency linen
problem. This was later confirmed
by Peter Carpenter himself:
"We've never been in better
shape."
And regarding the leukemia: I
can only respond that my mother
was in such a state in St. Louis in
1970 and there was a hospital
workers strike in progress. A very
peculiar thing happened — the
professional staff became
noticeably more concerned with
the patients' emotional needs, and
the relatives were far more upset
than the patients. It was my
mother, who was so keenly aware
of the service that the
"non-professionals" had given to
her, that made the rest of us see
that if striking was the only way
they could get "food and rent"
then, so be it.
I guess it's all in how you look
at it. I would also like to conclude
with a question for Spicer,
considering how often this whole
hospital brouhaha has been aired
in print — are you not hearing
what we are saying, because we
are not saying what you want to
hear?

Pet owners can move now to
stop mass slaughter of dogs and
cats. Thousands of healthy,
appealing surplus dogs and cats
are being killed each week at
pounds and animal shelters. This
killing goes on all year, and each
spring it is stepped up to keep
pace with the spring births of
puppies and kittens.
How can this killing be
prevented? Spaying and neutering
is the answer! A visit to the local
animal shelter where one sees the
desperate, eager faces of the many
pets waiting on death row should
convince anyone of the need to
spay and neuter pets.
There is no excuse for allowing
one's pet to breed a litter when
there are beautiful dogs and cats,
puppies and kittens already
waiting in vain for homes that do
not exist. It's not cute anymore to
let mama cat or dog have a litter
for the children to see.
All pet owners can now afford
spaying and neutering at one of
