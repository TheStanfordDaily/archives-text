# Outer Spacemen Watching?
## 
### 
University News Service
If there really is anyone out
there in space watching us there's
no need to be afraid of them,
according to Stanford radio
astronomer and Electrical
Engineering Prof. Ronald N.
Bracewell.
Replying to those who have
expressed fear that spacemen
might use the earth and its
inhabitants as a kind of protein
farm, Bracewell pointed out the
economic disadvantages of such
an idea.
"When you take into account
their transportation costs of
getting here," he said, "it would
be cheaper for them to synthesize
protein out of the elements they
have near at hand."
"So I'm not afraid to answer
them if they send in a message. I'll
be very happy to write the reply."
Bracewell, director of the
Stanford Radio Astronomy
Institute, and hydrologist Irwin
Remson, professor of
environmental earth sciences,
spoke at a campus press briefing
for their appearances June 1 at

the annual Stanford Campus
Conference for alumni and
residents of the surrounding
communities.
Elaborating on his ideas about
other beings in space, Bracewell
said that much depends upon how
numerous the other space
communities, if any, may be. For
instance, if the nearest one is a
hundred light years away, it
would take 200 years to get a
reply.
"We couldn't have
conversations like those on a
telephone if we have to wait 200
years for a reply to our "hello.' If
it is 1000 light years away, it
would take 2000 years to get a
reply."
Bracewell also scoffed at some
of the modern best-sellers of
science, particularly Chariots of
the Gods? by Erich von Daniken,
whom he described as a
"demonstrable fraud." He was
much kinder to the controversial
Immanuel Velikovsky and his
Worlds in Collision, whom he
defended against such "unfair"
detractors as Carl Sagan while still

not accepting the author's
theories.
Stanford President Richard W.
Lyman also will address the
campus conference at a luncheon
outside Bowman Alumni House
on June 1. The public also is
invited to attend by contacting
the Stanford Alunni Association.
Other conference speakers will
be biologist Colin Pittendrigh,
psychiatrist William C. Dement,
food economist Walter Falcon,
English Profs. Ronald Rebholz,
Lucio Ruotolo, and William
Chace, economist John Gurley
and Soviet specialists Wayne
Vucinich, Paul Cocks, and
Alexander Dalin.

If there really is anyone out
there in space watching us there's
no need to be afraid of them,
according to Stanford radio
astronomer and Electrical
Engineering Prof. Ronald N.
Bracewell.
Replying to those who have
expressed fear that spacemen
might use the earth and its
inhabitants as a kind of protein
farm, Bracewell pointed out the
economic disadvantages of such
an idea.
"When you take into account
their transportation costs of
getting here," he said, "it would
be cheaper for them to synthesize
protein out of the elements they
have near at hand."
"So I'm not afraid to answer
them if they send in a message. I'll
be very happy to write the reply."
Bracewell, director of the
Stanford Radio Astronomy
Institute, and hydrologist Irwin
Remson, professor of
environmental earth sciences,
spoke at a campus press briefing
for their appearances June 1 at

the annual Stanford Campus
Conference for alumni and
residents of the surrounding
communities.
Elaborating on his ideas about
other beings in space, Bracewell
said that much depends upon how
numerous the other space
communities, if any, may be. For
instance, if the nearest one is a
hundred light years away, it
would take 200 years to get a
reply.
