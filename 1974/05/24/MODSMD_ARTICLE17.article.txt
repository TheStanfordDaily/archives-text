Students who need the services
of a notary public for absentee
voting ballots now have a
champion here on campus. Yvette
Sanchez, a secretary in the Dean
of Students office, is offering
notarization services free of
charge in the Old Union, Room
311. Outside notaries typically
charge from one to two dollars for
their services.
Sanchez volunteered to
become a notary public in
response to past student inquiries
about such a service,. After
passing the exam and submitting
references, she received her
authorization from the state last
month. The University aided her
by paying her fees and filing the
required $500 bond. She is
limiting her notarization services
to election ballots due to the time
involved.

Because she is considering a
future career in business and law,
Sanchez decided the notary
experience was a good way to
explore her interest. "For me, it's
an easy way to be introduced into
the different aspects of law," she
says. "It's more practical than
reading a book."
Although California absentee
ballots do not require
notarization, many other states
request a notary's signature on the
application for the ballot and on
the ballot itself.
Sanchez urges students to read
their ballots carefully because
each state has its own
requirements. Some states require
the ballot to be filled out in the
presence of the notary, while
others allow it to be filled out
beforehand. In any case, students
must present some form of
identification such as student ID.
