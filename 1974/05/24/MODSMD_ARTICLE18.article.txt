# Rent Control Initiative Debated At Forum
## 
### WENDY QUINONES 
Calling Proposition B, the Palo
Alto rent control initiative, "an
efficient machine" for reducing
the supply of rental housing,
Howard W. Lewis, Jr., coordinator
of Palo Alto Citizens Against
Proposition B, charged at
Wednesday's Rent Control
Forum, that the measure "will
directly hurt most the very people
it's designed to help — low and
moderate income families."
The effect of rent control on
the supply of rental housing in
Palo Alto emerged as the major
issue of the debate, sponsored by
the Palo Alto Human Relations
Commission (HRC) and the
League of Women Voters. Voters
will decide on the measure in the
June 4 balloting.
Lewis, real estate consultant
and member of the advisory board
of Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing (MCFH), and Dr. John
Zenger, vice-president of Syntex

Corp. and former member and
chairman of the HRC, argued
against rent control.
Supporters of the proposition
James Stewart, attorney and 1972
Democratic candidate for
Congress, and Agnes Robinson,
MCFH member and former school
board member, argued that rent
control would increase and
upgrade rental units in Palo Alto.
It would also, Robinson said,
"prevent Palo Alto from
becoming an economically
homogenized area."
According to Stewart, rent
control would provide landlords
with a "reasonable profit," while
preventing speculators from
exploiting the city's housing
shortage. He added that the
proposed Rent Control Board
must consider a landlord's costs in
setting rental rates, and insisted
that the Board would grant
"reasonable rent increases."
History of Rent Control
The history of rent control in

other cities, Stewart said,
supported his view. In five cities
in Massachusetts, he noted,
construction of new rental
housing has increased 55 percent
during the three years rent control
has been in effect there.
Lewis disagreed, however,
citing conflicting figures which
showed a sharp decline in new
construction in one of the cities
Stewart mentioned.
Lewis charged that Prop. B
would cause rent rollbacks of as
much as 30 percent in Palo Alto.
This, he said, would speed the
conversion of apartments to
condominiums. In addition, Lewis
predicted that many smaller
iandlords, particularly those with
single family homes, would sell
them because these lower rents
would not cover their costs. The
measure would "drastically
reduce" the city's rental housing,
Lewis said.
Other major disagreements
were:

Constitutionality Of Ordinance
—Constitutionality. Berkeley's
similar rent control ordinance was
struck down by the Alameda
County Superior Court and is now
on appeal. Stewart argued that an
anti-eviction clause, not contained
in Prop. B, was the basis for the
court decision.
He added that the Alameda
decision is not binding in Santa
Clara County, and should not
prevent Palo Alto from trying its
own approach to rent control. A
final decision in the Berkeley case
isn't expected for another two
years, he said.
According to Lewis, however,
the court's decision indicates that
rent control measures are not
appropriate to the initiative
process, which was also used to
place Prop. B on the ballot.
Composition of Board
—Composition of the Board.
Robinson pointed out that Palo

Alto citizens could be expected to
elect a "moderate" board. She
added that the $30 per meeting
fee to be paid each member would
guarantee that the Board members
would come from a cross-section of
the city. "Nobody will need to be
out of pocket for a babysitter,"
she explained.
Zenger, however, predicted a
"deluge" of rent increase
petitions, creating such an
extreme workload that "anybody
who has to earn a living couldn't
serve on the Board."
Vagueness Of Proposal
—Vagueness. Zenger charged
that the proposition calls only for
"fair and equitable" rents, with
no indication of what standards
are to be used in the
determination. Stewart countered
that New York's experience with
rent control showed that setting up
formulas by law in advance
deprived the Board of necessary
flexibility.
