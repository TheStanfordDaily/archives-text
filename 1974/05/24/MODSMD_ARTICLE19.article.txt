# SLA Played To Media--Right To The Bloody End
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
It was chillingly ironic that the
Symbionese Liberation Army,
media-conscious to the end,
should die on live television.
From the first the SLA drew
its life from spectacular,
media-directed ploys, and if the
vicious gun battle in Los Angeles
last Friday was anything, it was
spectacular.
Exactly what else it was has
become a matter of hot debate in
recent days. A number of groups,
ranging from some families of the
six victims to the American Civil
Liberties Union, claim that the
350 police and FBI agents who
shot it out with the SLA at best
used excessive force and at worst
deliberately provoked the
confrontation.
Reading news reports from Los
Angeles, though, it is difficult to
escape the feeling that a violent
conclusion to this rather bizarre
chapter in American history was
inevitable. Indeed, it seems if
anyone forced a confrontation, it
was the SLA.
The tiny terrorist band made
no apparent attempt to conceal its
presence in the house on 54th
Street. Security was so loose, in
fact, that television reporter
Christine Lund, who passed the
house by chance on her way to
another building she believed the
police were going to raid, learned
the SLA was inside from a small
girl she passed on the street.
Earlier Mary Carr, mother ot
the woman who lived in the
house, came to see her daughter.
Her greeting was hardly a subtle
one: a pistol-packing stranger met
her at the door. "She slapped her

side and smiled up at me," Carr
recounted later. But she was
allowed to leave, and it was her
tip that sent police to surround
the house.
The SLA momentarily took
several hostages, but eventually
set them all loose, although the
group must surely have expected
at least one of them to talk. And
though the shooting didn't start
until around 5:30 p.m. one
hostage, Brenda Daniels, told
police the SLA was setting up
automatic weapons in the house
as early as 10 a.m.
Most witnesses have confirmed
the police claim that they twice
used bullhorns to call for the SLA
to surrender before beginning to
advance on the house. Likewise,
most of them agree that the SLA
fired the first shots of the
confrontation. To expect police
to remain silent in the face of .50
caliber machine gun fire seems
highly unrealistic at best.
And finally, when firemen
finally finished sifting the charred
remains of the house, they found
all six bodies were still wearing gas
masks.
All of this evidence strongly
suggests that the SLA members
weren't interested in either
peacefully surrendering or even
escaping. They apparently wanted
to live out revolutionary fantasies
of a cataclysmic last stand against
overwhelming odds, heroic
martyrs taking out a passel of pigs
in a final showdown with the
forces of fascism. They got the
former—a suicidal gun battle—but
apparently all those hours of
target practice earlier SLA
communiques mentioned were for

naught: not a single policeman
was even wounded.
Why would the SLA give up a
life of fame and fortune for
bloody death in a Los Angeles
ghetto? The answer is not hard to
find. The SLA was on the run;
San Francisco had already gotten
too hot for the group's members,
and now they had been spotted in
Los Angeles after only a few days'
operation there.
The end of the trail was clearly

drawing near. While they might
have been able to slip out of the
police noose at 54th and
Compton, it was apparent that
soon the handful of SLA members
would be cornered—and when the
final scene came, it might not be
on their terms.
As the SLA successfully evaded
police and the FBI for weeks in
San Francisco, this small "army"
had rapidly become a creature of
myth; Nancy Ling Perry and

Donald DeFreeze were almost folk
heroes. "We love you Tania"
posters sprouted all over Berkeley.
If SLA members were murderers
and terrorists, well, they were also
classic outlaws, defying the law
with all the classic romanticism of
the guerrilla.
But what would be the
romanticism in capture and
prison? A Cinque in handcuffs,
seen up close on the television
cameras, would show all the

normal blemishes of a human
being. Nancy Ling Perry in court
might look like just another
gun-crazed neurotic.
The SLA's earlier actions were
clearly designed to capture the
public's imagination. No sensible
revolutionary would argue that
Oakland school superintendant
Marcus Foster deserved the death
penalty for advocating student ID
cards—but killing him gave the
SLA an immediate presence. And

when the group robbed a San
Francisco bank, it didn't even
bother to take all the cash on
hand. Instead, members spent
most of their time posing for the
bank's hidden cameras.
Now captivity threatened to
destroy everything that was the
SLA. Instead the six members in
the white stucco house opted for
a final blaze of glory, and they
achieved it before a television
audience numbering in the
millions. It was the ultimate
media freakery.
Their decision has a dismaying
significance for the fate of
one-time kidnap victim Patty
Hearst, still at large and now
credited as a full-fledged member
of the group. If her friends chose
to die for the reputation of the
revolution, can she now do less?
Will we watch another round of
carnage on television next week,
as Patty and her companions are
finally run to the ground?
Don't bet against it.
