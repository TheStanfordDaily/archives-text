# French Campus Fate Uncertain
## Tours Enrollment Drops Sharply 
### TERRY ANZUR Special to the Daily 
TOURS, France — Due to a
substantial drop in student enrollment,
the overseas study center in Tours will
operate at less than one-fourth its
capacity next fall and winter quarters,
administrators here learned late
Tuesday afternoon.
Paul LeMoal, director of the French
studies center, telephoned Overseas
Studies Director Mark Mancall
Wednesday to express his "personal
anxiety" about the future of the
program.
Mancall said that "if it was
necessary to close the center, the staff
will be told in due time," LeMoal told
the Daily.
(Mancall told the Daily Wednesday
night there were "no plans" to close
the Tours center.)
Overseas Memo
A memo from the Overseas Studies
Office containing the names of
students who will attend
Stanford-in-France next fall and
winter quarters arrived here Tuesday
afternoon. The center, designed to
accommodate a maximum of 80
students, will house only 20 in the fall
and 16 students during the winter,
according to the list.
One-fourth of the applicants in
each group are non-Stanford students,
mostly from Mills College in Oakland.
There are currently 57 students at the
Tours campus and 47 are expected
during summer quarter.
During their phone conversation,
Mancall did not comment on the
financial problems of operating the
center for a small group, LeMoal said.
Mancall told him not to worry about
the declining enrollment, adding that
the overseas studies office would take
care of the problem, he said.
LeMoal commented that he may
have little choice but to "tell the extra
staff members that this is the end." He
added that he did not know how many
of his staff would be affected.
Economy Moves
Despite economy moves such as
abolishing the residence assistant (RA)
position and allowing only one
Stanford professor to fly over each
quarter, LeMoal said he will have to
fire staff members if fall and winter
enrollment does not increase.
The news of the sudden drop in
enrollment for next fall came as a
surprise to administrators here. "We
were not warned," LeMoal said.
"Mancall never said we had a

problem."
Jean Marie Deßemusson, social
director of the Tours center,
attributed the "abrupt decline" to "a
reaction to Mancall's new overseas
studies program. He asked us to
reorganize the whole system because
enrollments were going down and
down until there were 45 in the last
fall-winter group," she said.
The courses offered at
Stanford-in-France concentrate on
French art, language, literature and
history. Classes meet only four days
per week allowing students three-day
weekends for travel. Language classes
stress classical vocabulary and
conversation.
Intensive French
Beginning in September, the
overseas academic quarter will begin
with one month of intensive French,
with classes meeting five days per
week. In addition to general studies
course offerings in French civilization,
students may opt for the 1974-75
Focus Program in Politics, Art and
Literature.
English Prof. Alfred Guerard,
currently teaching at
Stanford-in-France for the fourth
time, was a member of the committee
which helped devise the new
curriculum for the Tours center.
Mancall asked the group to formulate
the ideal program without considering
what professors were available to teach
in France at the time, Guerard
remembered.
Because of arrangements made
when Political Science Prof. Robert
Walker was overseas campuses
director, Electrical Engineering Prof.
David Tuttle will teach math courses
at Stanford-in-France during 1974-75,
Guerard said.
"Mancall's idea was to get science
people over here as well as literary
people," Deßemusson explained.
Pre-Med Problem
"The pre-med problem was
foreseen," added LeMoal who had just
finished arranging for access to a
computer in Tours for 30 students.
"A drop from 80 to 60 students
could reflect a change in students'
career attitudes," Guerard suggested.
"But a drop from 60 to 20 could
reflect a problem in the way the
program is presented and Mancall's
style of talking to students. As
presented in the catalogue, the new
program looks quite attractive," he
said.
The 140-page 1974 Overseas

Studies catalogue represents a
"marked departure" from the travel
brochure-like booklet issued in
previous years, he added.
"And the only publicity in the
Daily talks about classes," remarked a
sophomore comparative literature
major. "They should have shown
pictures of wine, cheese and travel."
Guerard said, "We all welcome the
added intellectual emphasis, but
students should also realize that the
other benefits of travel in Europe will
still be here."
Students here lamented that the
new program's month-long elimination
of the three-day weekend will
drastically cut the continuity between
classes and the community. They
praised the Tours location as a travel
base and blasted various elements of
the new program as "too radical."

LeMoal commented that he may
have little choice but to "tell the extra
staff members that this is the end." He
added that he did not know how many
of his staff would be affected.
Economy Moves
Despite economy moves such as
abolishing the residence assistant (RA)
position and allowing only one
Stanford professor to fly over each
quarter, LeMoal said he will have to
fire staff members if fall and winter
enrollment does not increase.
The news of the sudden drop in
enrollment for next fall came as a
surprise to administrators here. "We
were not warned," LeMoal said.
"Mancall never said we had a

problem."
Jean Marie Deßemusson, social
director of the Tours center,
attributed the "abrupt decline" to "a
reaction to Mancall's new overseas
studies program. He asked us to
reorganize the whole system because
enrollments were going down and
down until there were 45 in the last
fall-winter group," she said.
The courses offered at
Stanford-in-France concentrate on
French art, language, literature and
history. Classes meet only four days
per week allowing students three-day
weekends for travel. Language classes
stress classical vocabulary and
conversation.
Intensive French
Beginning in September, the
overseas academic quarter will begin
with one month of intensive French,
with classes meeting five days per
week. In addition to general studies
course offerings in French civilization,
students may opt for the 1974-75
Focus Program in Politics, Art and
Literature.
English Prof. Alfred Guerard,
currently teaching at
Stanford-in-France for the fourth
time, was a member of the committee
which helped devise the new
curriculum for the Tours center.
Mancall asked the group to formulate
the ideal program without considering
what professors were available to teach
in France at the time, Guerard
remembered.
Because of arrangements made
when Political Science Prof. Robert
Walker was overseas campuses
director, Electrical Engineering Prof.
David Tuttle will teach math courses
at Stanford-in-France during 1974-75,
Guerard said.
"Mancall's idea was to get science
people over here as well as literary
people," Deßemusson explained.
Pre-Med Problem
"The pre-med problem was
foreseen," added LeMoal who had just
finished arranging for access to a
computer in Tours for 30 students.
"A drop from 80 to 60 students
could reflect a change in students'
career attitudes," Guerard suggested.
"But a drop from 60 to 20 could
reflect a problem in the way the
program is presented and Mancall's
style of talking to students. As
presented in the catalogue, the new
program looks quite attractive," he
said.
The 140-page 1974 Overseas

Studies catalogue represents a
"marked departure" from the travel
brochure-like booklet issued in
previous years, he added.
"And the only publicity in the
Daily talks about classes," remarked a
sophomore comparative literature
major. "They should have shown
pictures of wine, cheese and travel."
Guerard said, "We all welcome the
added intellectual emphasis, but
students should also realize that the
other benefits of travel in Europe will
still be here."
Students here lamented that the
new program's month-long elimination
of the three-day weekend will
drastically cut the continuity between
classes and the community. They
praised the Tours location as a travel
base and blasted various elements of
the new program as "too radical."
TOURS, France — Due to a
substantial drop in student enrollment,
the overseas study center in Tours will
operate at less than one-fourth its
capacity next fall and winter quarters,
administrators here learned late
Tuesday afternoon.
Paul LeMoal, director of the French
studies center, telephoned Overseas
Studies Director Mark Mancall
Wednesday to express his "personal
anxiety" about the future of the
program.
Mancall said that "if it was
necessary to close the center, the staff
will be told in due time," LeMoal told
the Daily.
(Mancall told the Daily Wednesday
night there were "no plans" to close
the Tours center.)
Overseas Memo
A memo from the Overseas Studies
Office containing the names of
students who will attend
Stanford-in-France next fall and
winter quarters arrived here Tuesday
afternoon. The center, designed to
accommodate a maximum of 80
students, will house only 20 in the fall
and 16 students during the winter,
according to the list.
One-fourth of the applicants in
each group are non-Stanford students,
mostly from Mills College in Oakland.
There are currently 57 students at the
Tours campus and 47 are expected
during summer quarter.
During their phone conversation,
Mancall did not comment on the
financial problems of operating the
center for a small group, LeMoal said.
Mancall told him not to worry about
the declining enrollment, adding that
the overseas studies office would take
care of the problem, he said.

currently teaching at
Stanford-in-France for the fourth
time, was a member of the committee
which helped devise the new
curriculum for the Tours center.
Mancall asked the group to formulate
the ideal program without considering
what professors were available to teach
in France at the time, Guerard
remembered.
Because of arrangements made
when Political Science Prof. Robert
Walker was overseas campuses
director, Electrical Engineering Prof.
David Tuttle will teach math courses
at Stanford-in-France during 1974-75,
Guerard said.
"Mancall's idea was to get science
people over here as well as literary
people," Deßemusson explained.
Pre-Med Problem
"The pre-med problem was
foreseen," added LeMoal who had just
finished arranging for access to a
computer in Tours for 30 students.
"A drop from 80 to 60 students
could reflect a change in students'
career attitudes," Guerard suggested.
"But a drop from 60 to 20 could
reflect a problem in the way the
program is presented and Mancall's
style of talking to students. As
presented in the catalogue, the new
program looks quite attractive," he
said.
The 140-page 1974 Overseas

Studies catalogue represents a
"marked departure" from the travel
brochure-like booklet issued in
previous years, he added.
"And the only publicity in the
Daily talks about classes," remarked a
sophomore comparative literature
major. "They should have shown
pictures of wine, cheese and travel."
Guerard said, "We all welcome the
added intellectual emphasis, but
students should also realize that the
other benefits of travel in Europe will
still be here."
Students here lamented that the
new program's month-long elimination
of the three-day weekend will
drastically cut the continuity between
classes and the community. They
praised the Tours location as a travel
base and blasted various elements of
the new program as "too radical."
TOURS, France — Due to a
substantial drop in student enrollment,
the overseas study center in Tours will
operate at less than one-fourth its
capacity next fall and winter quarters,
administrators here learned late
Tuesday afternoon.
Paul LeMoal, director of the French
studies center, telephoned Overseas
Studies Director Mark Mancall
Wednesday to express his "personal
anxiety" about the future of the
program.
Mancall said that "if it was
necessary to close the center, the staff
will be told in due time," LeMoal told
the Daily.
(Mancall told the Daily Wednesday
night there were "no plans" to close
the Tours center.)
Overseas Memo
A memo from the Overseas Studies
Office containing the names of
students who will attend
Stanford-in-France next fall and
winter quarters arrived here Tuesday
afternoon. The center, designed to
accommodate a maximum of 80
students, will house only 20 in the fall
and 16 students during the winter,
according to the list.
One-fourth of the applicants in
each group are non-Stanford students,
mostly from Mills College in Oakland.
There are currently 57 students at the
Tours campus and 47 are expected
during summer quarter.
During their phone conversation,
Mancall did not comment on the
financial problems of operating the
center for a small group, LeMoal said.
Mancall told him not to worry about
the declining enrollment, adding that
the overseas studies office would take
care of the problem, he said.
LeMoal commented that he may
have little choice but to "tell the extra
staff members that this is the end." He
added that he did not know how many
of his staff would be affected.
Economy Moves
Despite economy moves such as
abolishing the residence assistant (RA)
position and allowing only one
Stanford professor to fly over each
quarter, LeMoal said he will have to
fire staff members if fall and winter
enrollment does not increase.
The news of the sudden drop in
enrollment for next fall came as a
surprise to administrators here. "We
were not warned," LeMoal said.
"Mancall never said we had a

problem."
Jean Marie Deßemusson, social
director of the Tours center,
attributed the "abrupt decline" to "a
reaction to Mancall's new overseas
studies program. He asked us to
reorganize the whole system because
enrollments were going down and
down until there were 45 in the last
fall-winter group," she said.
The courses offered at
Stanford-in-France concentrate on
French art, language, literature and
history. Classes meet only four days
per week allowing students three-day
weekends for travel. Language classes
stress classical vocabulary and
conversation.
Intensive French
Beginning in September, the
overseas academic quarter will begin
with one month of intensive French,
with classes meeting five days per
week. In addition to general studies
course offerings in French civilization,
students may opt for the 1974-75
Focus Program in Politics, Art and
Literature.
