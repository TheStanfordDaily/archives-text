# Negotiations Move Quicker As USE Strike Grinds On
## 
### DON COX 
As the United Stanford
Employees (USE) strike ground
into the end of its second week,
contract negotiations seemed to
be proceeding with a new vitality.
Entrances to buildings and
construction sites were, for the
most part, free of the hordes of
picketers visible in days past.
Responsible for the placid
scenario was the amended
temporary restraining order issued
Tuesday which cut the heart out
of one of the union's most
effective weapons—the picket line.
It remained to be seen whether
union lawyers would find some
legal means to circumvent the new
order which limited the number
of pickets at any entrance to two
in number.
Some observers were surprised
at the overwhelming scope of the
order. While it is not uncommon
to limit the number of pickets, to
limit the number to two was seen
as unusual.
The amended version was
obtained by University lawyers
after the first TRO they obtained
proved to be too general and
impotent. In fact, observers said
the judge expressed some surprise
when the University attorneys
asked for so little in the first
TRO.
Palo Alto police were none too

pleased at the new TRO which
directed them to take appropriate
action if the order was violated.
Police officials said that the
whole strike would be settled in a
month or so at which time the
University and the workers would
be buddies again. But hostility
towards the police, who might be
forced to arrest someone, would
not abate for some time.
The police just can't win in a
labor-management dispute.
Meanwhile, somewhere out in
the hills behind campus, the two
negotiating teams were making
good progress towards cleaning up
a lot of the conceptual details that
the University wanted out of the
way before they got done to the
hard money issues.
Progress was made on
definitions of shifts and hours
worked, premium pay and leaves.
As the week was ending, the two
sides were getting into the touchy
layoff issue which USE has
designated as a strike issue.
Following issuance of the new
TRO, disruptions more or less
disappeared though sabotage
persisted. Plant Services Director
Dan DeYoung said the sabotage
only added to his problems and
was becoming serious.
USE president Jim Berk,
admonished by his negotiating
team to stay out of jail, did so and

was largely preoccupied with the
negotiations.
He did appear at Plant Services
Wednesday to overturn the
paycheck dispersal table planted
behind union picket lines. Seeing
the electrical engineer overturning
the paycheck table behind the
holy picket lines naturally (as it
was supposed to) summoned forth
visions in the minds of most
observers of a certain humble
carpenter in a temple a few years
back. Times certainly have
changed.

USE president Jim Berk,
admonished by his negotiating
team to stay out of jail, did so and

negotiations.

Wednesday to overturn the

observers of a certain humble

As the United Stanford
Employees (USE) strike ground
into the end of its second week,
contract negotiations seemed to
be proceeding with a new vitality.
Entrances to buildings and
construction sites were, for the
most part, free of the hordes of
picketers visible in days past.
Responsible for the placid
scenario was the amended
temporary restraining order issued
Tuesday which cut the heart out
of one of the union's most
effective weapons—the picket line.
It remained to be seen whether
union lawyers would find some
legal means to circumvent the new
order which limited the number
of pickets at any entrance to two
in number.
Some observers were surprised
at the overwhelming scope of the
order. While it is not uncommon
to limit the number of pickets, to
limit the number to two was seen
as unusual.
The amended version was
obtained by University lawyers
after the first TRO they obtained
proved to be too general and
impotent. In fact, observers said
the judge expressed some surprise
when the University attorneys
asked for so little in the first
TRO.
Palo Alto police were none too

pleased at the new TRO which
directed them to take appropriate
action if the order was violated.
Police officials said that the
whole strike would be settled in a
month or so at which time the
University and the workers would
be buddies again. But hostility
towards the police, who might be
forced to arrest someone, would
not abate for some time.
The police just can't win in a
labor-management dispute.
Meanwhile, somewhere out in
the hills behind campus, the two
negotiating teams were making
good progress towards cleaning up
a lot of the conceptual details that
the University wanted out of the
way before they got done to the
hard money issues.
Progress was made on
definitions of shifts and hours
worked, premium pay and leaves.
As the week was ending, the two
sides were getting into the touchy
layoff issue which USE has
designated as a strike issue.
Following issuance of the new
TRO, disruptions more or less
disappeared though sabotage
persisted. Plant Services Director
Dan DeYoung said the sabotage
only added to his problems and
was becoming serious.
