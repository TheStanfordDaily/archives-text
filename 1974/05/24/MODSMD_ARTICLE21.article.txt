## This Week Everything's Rosy—For 12 Months Gibbs, Policy Boards End Yearly Fight

Members of the SWOPSI and
SCIRE Policy Boards still aren't
sure why Undergraduate Studies
Dean James L. Gibbs Jr. told
them three weeks ago his office
could no longer fund their
programs at current levels.
Gibbs last week apparently
reversed himself on the SCIRE
budget, promising the center as

much as $24,900 — only $200 less
than the board's request. Some of
that money will almost surely
come from Gibbs' office reserves,
the fund he said could no longer
support the two programs.
And, although SWOPSI
remains officially without a
budget for next year, Gibbs has
promised the Policy Board one by
next Tuesday. It is expected that
that budget, too, will be just
about what the board originally
requested.
Gibbs has also withdrawn his
proposal that SWOPSI be merged
with the Undergraduate Specials
program. The proposal met heavy
criticism from members of the
SWOPSI Policy Board, who
charged it would "dilute
SWOPSI's identity."
Instead, the Undergraduate
Specials coordinator, a half-time
position on the Dean's staff, will
move into the Old Union
basement offices now shared only
by SWOPSI, SCIRE, and the
Program in Urban Studies: a move
to foster more communication
among the various
extradepartmental programs.
This year's tilt between Gibbs
and the policy boards closely
resembles past conflicts. SWOPSI
and SCIRE were established in the
late '60s in response to student
demands for educational
innovation.
But since 1970, when the
programs were placed largely
under the jurisdiction of the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies' office,
their independence has been
considerably eroded.
Some kind of conflict between
the dean and the policy boards
has, moreover, become almost a
yearly affair. The dean either
attempts to persuade the
programs to bring their often
haphazard operation into closer
conformity with a more
bureaucratic "streamlined"
model, or finds himself in a
financial crunch, or both.
The policy boards fiercely
resent any actions they perceive as
threatening their autonomy or

identity, are unsure that their
innovative purposes are entirely
compatible with integration into
the University's bureaucratic
structure, and are frankly
skeptical of pleas of financial
difficulty.
This year, it is a little different
because of the slightly precarious
position of the programs. Neither
has a director for next year.
SCIRE, after a one-year hiatus
following the University's failure
to rehire former Director Ron
Jones — an action which touched
off the resignation, en bloc, of the
entire policy board — has
not yet found a new director.
And although SWOPSI
Director Dan Lewis decided to
leave his job some time ago, the

uncertainty of next year's budget
has prevented the program from
even seeking a new director until
now.
Policy board members, in their
darker moments, had worried that
the programs might not survive
the summer at all. Their fears
should have been allayed by now.
From that standpoint, this
year's "conflict" had has come up
with a happy ending all around.
But it has done little to improve
the always shaky relations
between the programs and their
Dean; and it has raised, once
again, the question of whether
freewheeling educational
innovation and large-scale
educational bureaucracy are
fundamentally incompatible.
