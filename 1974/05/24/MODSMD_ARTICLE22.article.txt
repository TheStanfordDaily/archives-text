# One More Primary Death Struggle (Ho Hum) Looms For McCloskey
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
J. Gordon Knapp's contention that he can
defeat Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park,
in the June 4 primary in the 12th Congressional
District would seem exaggerated if McCloskey did
not tend to agree with him.
Although McCloskey may be emphasizing his
own vulnerability in an effort to avoid staff
overconfidence, there is much evidence that
McCloskey is facing a tough race in the district,
which includes Stanford.
McCloskey and Knapp both point out that
McCloskey won only 43 percent of the vote in the
1972 against two conservative candidates. This
year, there is only one avowed
conservative—Knapp—in the race, arid both
candidates agree that the conservatives will unite
behind Knapp.
McCloskey's problems are compounded because
a reapportionment plan masterminded by Knapp
and adopted last year by the state legislature
brought a large number of conservative voters into
the district.
A poll taken by McCloskey early this year
claimed that 38 percent of the voters will vote for
anyone but him, and 38 percent will support him
no matter who runs against him. McCloskey says he
is aiming his campaign at the 24 percent in between.

Knapp is depending heavily on the anti-
McCloskey sentiment in the district.
He has accused McCloskey of being an
ineffective congressman whose bills seldom become
law and who fails to represent the political
philosophy of his Republican constituents.
Knapp has also accused McCloskey of spending
too much time attacking President Nixon and not
enough time responding to the needs of his
constituents.
Perhaps more than any other issue, Knapp, a
millionaire Atherton businessman, is emphasizing
his experience in economics, insisting that he could
better respond to, understand and grapple with the
problems of the national economy.
McCloskey claims, however, that Knapp
exemplifies an anti-reform attitude that is harming
the Republican party. He has accused Knapp of
being insensitive to the need for a higher minimum
wage, expanded conservation programs and limits
on campaign spending.
Although McCloskey seems to be fighting for his
political life in the primary, local political observers
recall that in each of McCloskey's six primary battles,
his views have seemed too radical to be accepted by
Republican voters. Many believe that on June 4, he
will again demonstrate his remarkable capacity for
political survival.
