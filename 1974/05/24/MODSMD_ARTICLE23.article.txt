# Drama, Music Depts. Combine For 'Don Giovanni'
## 
### 
The Stanford Departments of
Music & Drama are joining forces
in a massive interdepartmental
and interdisciplinary effort to
mount Mozart's sparkling opera
Don Giovanni on a lavish scale.
Four gala performances will be
presented in Memorial
Auditorium May 29, 30, 31 and
June 1 at 7:30 p.m.
Maestro Sandor Salgo, in
whose honor these performances
are being given, will be conducting
more than 70 members of the
Stanford Symphony-Orchestra
which he founded 24 years ago.
Don Giovanni has been
specially selected by Salgo for his
fa ewell performance at Stanford.
H will conduct the orchestra,
wnich was recently voted one of
the best college orchestras in the
country by music educators.
Music Instructors
Music Department vocal
instructors, Robert Bernard and
Marie Gibson, both veteran
professional singers, will be joined
in the cast by past and present
students and exciting young Bay
Area professionals with opera
credits throughout the U.S. and
Europe. Gibson is also responsible
for the vocal preparation.
Ultimate artistic decisions for
the entire production are in the
hands of Stage Director John
Olon-Scrymgeour, a Drama
faculty member and former
Artistic Director of the Center
Opera Company of Minneapolis.
Prof. Harold Schmidt is
preparing a chorus of thirty
talented student-singers, drawn
from departments across the
campus.
Costumes, Setting, Lights
The Drama Department has
undertaken the enormous task of
designing and constructing the
huge number of costumes, settings
and lights required for the
large-scale production.
Asked how many costumes she
has designed for Don Giovanni,
Costume Designer Juliellen Weiss
answered enigmatically,
"somewhere between 70 and
500".
Weiss is concerned about
relating her costumes organically
to the music. She believes that for
opera, "The costumes must
transcend reality, just as the music
transcends reality. The character
must exude spiritual strength, not
tell a little story about his

personal past."
A crew of 20 has also been at
work for weeks constructing the
eight separate set units created by
Prof. William Eddelman, and
installing a battery of lighting
instruments for Lighting Designer
Thomas Arntsen.
The stories of many grand
operas are silly to the point of
being ludicrous. This is definitely
not the case with Mozart's Don
Giovanni, which is based on the
classic myth of the arch-seducer
Don Juan.
The story and music are so
intimately wedded together in
Mozart's masterpiece that the
company will be singing the text
in the sensitive English version by
poet W.H. Auden and Chester
Kallman.
Ultimate Male Chauvinist
Modern audiences recognize in
Don Giovanni the symbol of the
ultimate male chauvinist, but they
relate to something deeper in the
hero as well. Don Giovanni is also
the arch-rebel, hurling defiance in
the face of a repressive moral and
social order, even defying the
heavens.
Mozart, whose Don Giovanni
was first performed in 1787, two
years before the outbreak of the
French Revolution, was no doubt
conscious of the revolutionary
tendencies of his hero.
The tension between the
individual and the group is
reflected in the composition of
Mozart's orchestra, which is a very
large one for the period, but the
instruments are reared almost as
soloists, in chamber music
fashion. Prof. Salgo points out
that this makes Mozart's music
very difficult. 'There is no place
to hide. The instruments stand
alone."
Salgo, who has performed Don
Giovanni as an instrumentalist
under such eminent conductors as
Furtwangler, Kleiber and Bruno
Walter, was particularly impressed
when he played the opera under
Toscanini in Salzburg in his
youth. "Toscanini captured both
the fire and the control which are
the essence of the work."
Advanced ticket sales for Don
Giovanni have been very heavy.
Tickets are still available for all
performances at Tresidder Box
Office (497-4317) and major Bay
Area ticket agencies.

responsible for the vocal preparation of the performance; John Olon-Scrymgeour, the
stage director; and Prof. Harold Schmidt, who is preparing the chorus. 'Don Giovanni'
will be performed on May 29, 30, 31 and June 1 in Memorial Auditorium at 7:30 p.m.
The Stanford Departments of
Music & Drama are joining forces
in a massive interdepartmental
and interdisciplinary effort to
mount Mozart's sparkling opera
Don Giovanni on a lavish scale.
Four gala performances will be
presented in Memorial
Auditorium May 29, 30, 31 and
June 1 at 7:30 p.m.
Maestro Sandor Salgo, in
whose honor these performances
are being given, will be conducting
more than 70 members of the
Stanford Symphony-Orchestra
which he founded 24 years ago.
Don Giovanni has been
specially selected by Salgo for his
fa ewell performance at Stanford.
H will conduct the orchestra,
wnich was recently voted one of
the best college orchestras in the
country by music educators.
Music Instructors
Music Department vocal
instructors, Robert Bernard and
Marie Gibson, both veteran
professional singers, will be joined
in the cast by past and present
students and exciting young Bay
Area professionals with opera
credits throughout the U.S. and
Europe. Gibson is also responsible
for the vocal preparation.
Ultimate artistic decisions for
the entire production are in the
hands of Stage Director John
Olon-Scrymgeour, a Drama
faculty member and former
Artistic Director of the Center
Opera Company of Minneapolis.
Prof. Harold Schmidt is
preparing a chorus of thirty
talented student-singers, drawn
from departments across the
campus.
Costumes, Setting, Lights
The Drama Department has
undertaken the enormous task of
designing and constructing the
huge number of costumes, settings
and lights required for the
large-scale production.
Asked how many costumes she
has designed for Don Giovanni,
Costume Designer Juliellen Weiss
answered enigmatically,
"somewhere between 70 and
500".
Weiss is concerned about
relating her costumes organically
to the music. She believes that for
opera, "The costumes must
transcend reality, just as the music
transcends reality. The character
must exude spiritual strength, not
tell a little story about his

personal past."
A crew of 20 has also been at
work for weeks constructing the
eight separate set units created by
Prof. William Eddelman, and
installing a battery of lighting
instruments for Lighting Designer
Thomas Arntsen.
The stories of many grand
operas are silly to the point of
being ludicrous. This is definitely
not the case with Mozart's Don
Giovanni, which is based on the
classic myth of the arch-seducer
Don Juan.
The story and music are so
intimately wedded together in
Mozart's masterpiece that the
company will be singing the text
in the sensitive English version by
poet W.H. Auden and Chester
Kallman.
Ultimate Male Chauvinist
Modern audiences recognize in
Don Giovanni the symbol of the
ultimate male chauvinist, but they
relate to something deeper in the
hero as well. Don Giovanni is also
the arch-rebel, hurling defiance in
the face of a repressive moral and
social order, even defying the
heavens.
Mozart, whose Don Giovanni
was first performed in 1787, two
years before the outbreak of the
French Revolution, was no doubt
conscious of the revolutionary
tendencies of his hero.
The tension between the
individual and the group is
reflected in the composition of
Mozart's orchestra, which is a very
large one for the period, but the
instruments are reared almost as
soloists, in chamber music
fashion. Prof. Salgo points out
that this makes Mozart's music
very difficult. 'There is no place
to hide. The instruments stand
alone."
Salgo, who has performed Don
Giovanni as an instrumentalist
under such eminent conductors as
Furtwangler, Kleiber and Bruno
Walter, was particularly impressed
when he played the opera under
Toscanini in Salzburg in his
youth. "Toscanini captured both

Don Giovanni the symbol of the
ultimate male chauvinist, but they
relate to something deeper in the
hero as well. Don Giovanni is also
the arch-rebel, hurling defiance in
the face of a repressive moral and
social order, even defying the
heavens.
Mozart, whose Don Giovanni
was first performed in 1787, two
years before the outbreak of the
French Revolution, was no doubt
conscious of the revolutionary
tendencies of his hero.
The tension between the
individual and the group is
reflected in the composition of
Mozart's orchestra, which is a very
large one for the period, but the
instruments are reared almost as
soloists, in chamber music
fashion. Prof. Salgo points out
that this makes Mozart's music
very difficult. 'There is no place
to hide. The instruments stand
alone."
Salgo, who has performed Don
Giovanni as an instrumentalist
under such eminent conductors as
Furtwangler, Kleiber and Bruno
Walter, was particularly impressed
when he played the opera under
Toscanini in Salzburg in his
youth. "Toscanini captured both
the fire and the control which are
the essence of the work."
Advanced ticket sales for Don
Giovanni have been very heavy.
Tickets are still available for all
performances at Tresidder Box
Office (497-4317) and major Bay
Area ticket agencies.
