# Bluesman Musselwhite Appearing On Campus
## 
### DAN FORTE 
"When I was living in the
south, and when I was living in
Chicago, all the black musicians
who were true blues players, who
I knew and lived with in their
homes and travelled with, they
never treated me no other way
than if I was just another black
cat. I mean we were just friends
and that was it. There was never
even any thought about it — the
fact that I was white. Like they
knew I was white, and if we went
to a place that was real rough, and
there was some kind of bullshit
that went down, you know, they
might help me get away from
there or something, or I might say
'Man, I better not go down there
with you, because it's too rough
over there.' But, there was never
any kind of a — I know there's a
way to say it much better than
this — but there was never no

uptightness about it. I was always
considered a partner, or a friend,
or an equal.
"I don't know why; maybe
because I'm from the south. And
maybe they could sense that I was
really sincere.
"But, I didn't TRY to be
black, I didn't TRY to be
anything; I just tried to be ME,
goddamnit. You know, I felt
comfortable with that kind of
music, it was just like second
nature to me, I could play it.
Fuck it, I could PLAY it, you
know, I didn't sit down and study
it and go into details, because it
wasn't something I had to pick
out of no book to try to get all
figured out; how the notes run,
what're the intervals, and all this
shit. It was just a sound, just a
feelin', just a thing that I had no
trouble with.
"I'm just me, man, all the

way."
From the time he was a
teenager in Memphis learning slide
guitar and harmonica from Furry
Lewis and Will Shade, to his
migration to Chicago at 18,
hanging out with the likes of Otis
Spann, Magic Sam, and Muddy
Waters, the fact that Charlie
Musselwhite was a white man
playing black music never seems

to have entered his mind or those
of the bluesmen he knew.
Charlie Musselwhite, now 30, is
recognized as one of the greatest
Chicago style blues harp players
left, along with James Cotton,
Shakey Walter Horton, and a few
others.
Memphis Charlie, as he is
sometimes known, will return to

Tresidder's Large Lounge Monday
night, May 27, at 7:00, as part of
the "History of the Blues," for
the second quarter in a row.
Backing Charlie will be
guitarist Tim Kaihatsu who is
featured on three of Charlie's six
LPs. Musselwhite, besides playing
harmonica, will also demonstrate
his slide guitar. Admission is 50
cents.
