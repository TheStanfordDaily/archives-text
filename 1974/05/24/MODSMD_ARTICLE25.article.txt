### SRI KRISHN CHOPRA 
Satyajit Ray, one of the
greatest movie directors of our
time, will be in Stanford this
weekend.
Not in person, no: a sensitive
artist like Ray would much rather
be met through his creations. You
can meet him through his famous
movie: DAYS AND NIGHTS IN
THE FOREST, screened by the
Stanford India Association, at
Bishop Auditorium, on Saturday,
May 25th, 8 p.m.
DAYS AND NIGHTS is about
four footloose, young men who
drive off from Calcutta to the
Chota Nagpur Hills for a few days'
runaway holiday in a forest
bungalow. Each has a distinctive
personality; each goes through a
different experience.
One of them finds the love of
his life. Another gets his kicks by
seducing a peasant girl. One gets
into an emotional muddle.
They get drunk, tangle with
two women from a big city, get
the forest bungalow caretaker into
trouble, quarrel, play silly tricks.
None of them will ever make
headlines; they are simple
everyday men.
But from this simple story of
four young men on a holiday,
Ray's genius has created what
movie critic Ivan Butler calls, "a
witty, ironic and moving study of
human relationships... a story
which holds attention throughout
as relationships are developed
with humor, insight and
compassion."
