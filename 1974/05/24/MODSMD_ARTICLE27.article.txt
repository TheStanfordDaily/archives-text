# Albritton Won't Return To School
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Terry Albritton, last year's
outstanding freshman shotputter,
has decided not to return to
Stanford next year, the Daily
learned Wednesday.
Albritton, who had taken this
year off to train for the 1976
Olympic Games, said "the
decision was nothing personal. I
still have many friends up here."
"I'm just in the process of
finding myself," said the Stanford
record-holder (61-6). My
priorities changed. Stanford tends
to expand you, rather than let
you concentrate on one thing
[shotputting ]," he added.
Albritton's original plan was to
take this year off and return to
the Farm next year, but
apparently he enjoys his present
routine more than schoolwork.
"I'm just working for the
Olympics right now. Training is so
much different from academics
and I enjoy this life. I feel that I
have found something in training
and yoga."
Albritton's decision didn't

stem from a dislike of track coach
Payton Jordan, "He understands
me completely. He knows that it
was my decision. I think that he
was the same when he was
younger but he pursued a
different course," said Albritton.
Jordan had been discussing the
matter with Albritton since April.
"He's a fine guy and an
outstanding athlete. We're really
going to miss him next year," said
Jordan. "It's our loss," he added.
In an interview in the Stanford
Observer last year, Albritton said
that he enjoyed Stanford's social
life. He still likes it and said his
decision wasn't based on this.
Although it's rumored that
Albritton will attend UCLA next
year, Albritton said it was still up
in the air. "I really don't know
what I'm going to be doing," he
said.
Albritton has not competed for
any club this season and it's
unlikely that he'll do so in the
future. "Track clubs use you.
They tell you where you're going
to participate and how to run
your life," said Albritton.
