# Strike Teach-In
## Professor Defends Walk-Out 
### CHESS ERWIN 
'There is a real contradiction
between the principles and practices of
this University," Assoc. History Prof.
Barton Bernstein told 60 people
attending a teach-in on United
Stanford Employees (USE) union
strike issues.
Sponsored by the Student Strike
Support Committee and the Faculty
Political Action Group, the teach-in
held in Bishop Auditorium was
presented as a "substitute" for a
discussion that had been scheduled for
last week. According to Medicine Prof.
Halsted Holman, administration
representatives withdrew from that
meeting at the last minute forcing its
cancellation.
Alleging that the University helps
to perpetuate large-scale corporate
capitalism, Bernstein expressed
disappointment that there was "no

sense of outrage [felt] for the
workers," by members of the
University community. He attributed
this to the "sense of loyalty of the
administration and the faculty" to the
University.
Loyalty
This loyalty exists only so long as
"[worker] demands don't intrude in
their [respective] arenas," Bernstein
continued. He stated that he did not
mean to imply that universities don't
change. Rather, he emphasized that
over the long-run that "power,
purpose, and practice don't change."
Bernstein explained that the
University is now facing new issues
involving a "large, economically
marginal segment of the University —
the workers." He characterized the
attitude of the University to the
conditions of the workers as "evasive
and suspicious."

"What disturbs me the most is how
the faculty has acquiesced in all this.
The faculty has abrogated its
intellectual function by not only not
supporting the strike but not even
talking about it," added Bernstein.
'The University has failed to
reconsider the definitions of what a
university really is," concluded
Bernstein.
Marxian Perspective
Three students from Economics
Prof. John Gurley's Marxian
economics class analyzed the
operation of the University from a
Marxian perspective. Their purpose,
according to East Asian studies
graduate student Helen Chauncey was
to emphasize that "Stanford is a
profit-making institution that is
closely linked to corporate
capitalism."
"Stanford is linked with corporate
interests and as a result is in the service
of class-interests. Hence, universities
are class-based as well," she noted.
Another of the students, Helen Siu,
declared that "the University is not
isolated because it's tied to a complex
network of corporate connections who
control University operations."
'Dependence'
This "dependence," she said, can be
seen in the large amount of funds in
grants and monies from the Federal
Government that are used here.
Siu pointed out that tuition
represents only 16 percent of the
University's income. However, grants
and government monies amounted to
40 percent, she noted. This
dependence shapes academic
operations, research and many of the
other operations of the University, she
concluded.
San Jose St. Economics Prof. Yale
Braunstein, a former economics
graduate student here, stated that
Stanford was the sixth largest recipient
of federal funds last year receiving
$55-60 million in total funds and $6
million from the Department of
Defense.

PROFITS UP? — Richard Doner and Helen Siu, students of Economics Prof.
John Gurley's class on Marxian economics spoke in Bishop Auditorium last
evening on the "intimate relationship" between the University and corporate
business and interests. They charged that Stanford is "a profit-making
institution" that helps to perpetuate the "class-based" ordering of society.
