# Wilt's Dippers Here Tonight
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
Some of America's finest
volleyball comes to Stanford
tonight at 7:30 in Maples Pavilion
when Wilt's Big Dippers make
their second appearance at
Stanford.
The Dippers, led by former
NBA star and current coach of the
ABA San Diego Conquistadors,
Wilt Chamberlain, travel all over
the nation promoting volleyball.
Last year they toppled Stanford
in four games before a crowd of
2,000.
Wilt this year brings four
outstanding players including
National Champion UCLA's Mike
Norman. Norman, a Vietnam
veteran and quite possibly the

cockiest person alive today, is
only 5'11". But says Stanford's
Willie Mannon, "He hits the
[expletive deleted] out of the
ball."
Norman can jump and he
knows it. In a recent Sports
Illustrated article he compared
himself to North Carolina State
basketball star David Thompson.
"Thompson can jump," he said,
"but I sky."
Stanford will counter Wilt's
four-man barrage with a
formidable team. Aside from
Stanford regulars Mannon, Bill
Rix, Mike Schmidt, George
McPheeters and Tom Duralde, the
Cards have imported alumni Steve
Hoch and Alan Christiansen.

In addition, Stanford has
added former UCLA star Mike
Ollio as player-coach.
Stanford is confident they can
upset the Dippers, who have lost
only once in their last 80 games.
Both Mannon and Ollio expressed
confidence in their squad's ability
and McPheeters said "I feel this
year we have a great chance. Last
year we were unorganized, but
this time we're ready to take
them."
Tickets are still available for
the match, and will be on sale
today at the Athletic Department
and tonight at the door.
Admission is $1 for students and
$2 for adults.
