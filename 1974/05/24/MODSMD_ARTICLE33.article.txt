# Basketball Coach Jones Leaves
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Billy Jones, two-year Stanford
basketball assistant and junior
varsity coach, has been named
head coach at the University of
Maryland's Baltimore campus.
Jones will head a program
which has been dormant since the
school's opening five years ago.
He is assured that officials of the
5000-student campus are "going
to put money into [the
program]," and was already
contacting scholarship prospects
by phone last night.
"This is a once-in-a-lifetime
chance," remarked the
26-year-old Jones. "Not too many
coaches get a chance to shape a
program."
"It's a great opportunity for
him," said Cardinal varsity mentor
Howie Dallmar. "It's a real loss
from my standpoint, losing a great

coach and a great person."
"He's a super guy," Dallmar
continued. "It's a great position at
a new school. They want to build
up their program and he'll do it."
Jones was an award-winning
three-year letterman for Maryland
(at College Park) and co-captain
of the Terrapins' 1967-68 team.
He stayed on at Maryland as
assistant freshman coach the next
season before moving to assistant
posts at American University in
Washington D.C. and UC Santa
Barbara.
He joined the Stanford staff in
1972, coaching the junior varsity
team to a 13-7 mark. This season,
while also assisting Dallmar with
the Cardinal varsity, he brought a
group of JV walk-ons back from a
slow start to an 11-6 campaign
highlighted by a six-game winning
streak.

Only one of Jones' players
during those two seasons, Ed
Schweitzer of the 1972-73 JV,
was on a Stanford basketball
scholarship.
Jones plans <.o continue the
winning ways that have become
the trademark of his short
coaching career. "I don't see going
back there and losing," he said,
adding that his young Maryland
players would "work their asses
off. My JV's tell you a little about
what I'm going to do."
Jones and his wife are both
from the Baltimore area, and the
opportunity to return home was a
factor in his decision.
Dallmar anticipates a large
number of applications for the
vacated Stanford post and has no
idea when a successor to Jones
will be named.
