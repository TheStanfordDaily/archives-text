### 
WASHINGTON - The chief counsel of the
House impeachment panel declared yesterday the
White House Watergate transcripts are "inadequate
and unsatisfactory."
John Doar said he told the Judiciary Committee
he is concerned both about the accuracy of the
documents "and the judgments of the President and
his counsel in deleting material on the grounds of
relevance."
President Nixon's chief Watergate lawyer, James
D. St. Clair, took affront at Doar's remarks and
wrote Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., that
they were "gratuitous in the extreme."
Despite Doar's assessment, neither he nor Rodino
would immediately support proposals aimed at
pressuring Nixon further to turn over remaining
tapes of the conversations.
In the face of a second presidential rebuke
Wednesday of committee subpoenas demanding
those tapes and other data, Rodino said the panel
should continue to subpoena evidence it deems
necessary — and consider any rejections as possibly
impeachable offenses in themselves.
The committee met in a closed, abbreviated
session during which it heard evidence focusing on
the first half of April 1973, when the Watergate
cover-up began to unravel.
Felony Charges Outrage Hearsts
HILLSBOROUGH — Patricia Hearst's parents are
outraged at statements by authorities who have filed
felony charges against her, an attorney said
yesterday.
"I tend to agree with their outrage," former U.S.
Atty. Cecil Poole said after meeting with Randolph
and Catherine Hearst. Poole, an Oakland attorney,
said he offered his services as counsel for Patricia
Hearst.
'They expressed outrage at the excessive
statements of law enforcement personnel,
particularly statements by the Los Angeles district

attorney who said he has a veritable flood of charges
against Miss Hearst," Poole told newsmen.
He said statements were "counterproductive"
and "unfair" and are probably "prejudicing the case
of the defendants."
Dist. atty. Joseph P. Busch of Los Angeles has
filed 19 charges against Patricia, including counts of
kidnaping, robbery and assault with a deadly
weapon. "In our opinion, Miss Hearst was acting on
her own free will," Busch said after filing the
charges.
Along with Patricia, authorities also are seeking
William and Emily Harris. The three were allegedly
involved in a shoplifting attempt at a sporting goods
store in a Los Angeles suburb on May 17. Patricia
allegedly sprayed the front of the store with
machine-gun fire, allowing the Harrises to escape.
A federal grand jury probing a violent bank
robbery heard testimony yesterday from a Los
Angeles teenager who says Patricia told him she
willingly took part in the holdup. The FBI and
police, meanwhile, continued the search for her.
Israel-Syria 'Move Closer 9
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger has moved Israel and Syria "considerably
closer" to agreement on thinning out their forces on
the Golan Heights, a senior U.S. official said last
night.
He said the breakthrough resulted from
Kissinger's introduction of undisclosed American
ideas, first in a meeting with Premier Golda Meir
and Israeli negotiators and later in a 4'/2-hour talk
with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus.
In a long day of shuttle diplomacy, the official
said, Kissinger also made progress on determining
the size of the U.N. force that will patrol the
thinned-out regions as well as the demilitarized
buffer zone between the Israeli and Syrian armies.
Kissinger will report to Israeli leaders this
morning and return to Damascus later in the day or
early tomorrow, hoping to wrap up the over all
disengagement settlement.

In any event, the official said, Kissinger will head
back to Washington by Sunday.
Irish Move To Avoid Strike
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Militant
Protestant strike leaders in Northern Ireland
announced moves yesterday to avoid a complete
power blackout and a confrontation with British
troops.
They said they would permit essential supplies of
gas, oil and electricity to reach power plants as long
as output was limited to 60 percent of normal.
Since the strike began more than a week ago,
electricity has been generated at less than a third of
the normal level.
Bellfast's public health and social services were
severely crippled.
Garbage was piled high because sanitation
workers were off the job for the ninth straight day,
and electricity shortages turned off sewage
'•"-atment plants.
Protestant workers called the strike to protest
British government plans for a council of Ireland
which would give the predominantly Roman
Catholic Irish republic a say in Northern Ireland's
affairs.
Authorities agreed Wednesday to postpone plans
for the council, but the strikers scoffed at the offer
as a "confidence trick."
Motorists waited for four hours and more to get
gas. Supplies were expected to run out by nightfall.
Emergency plans were made to try to secure
gasoline supplies for ambulances, fire trucks and
police cars.
Today's Weather
Patchy low clouds near the coast spreading
inland locally late nights and mornings through
tomorrow. Lows today and tomorrow morning in
the upper 40s and low 50s. Highs both days mid 60s
to mid 70s.

allegedly sprayed the front of the store with
machine-gun fire, allowing the Harrises to escape.
A federal grand jury probing a violent bank
robbery heard testimony yesterday from a Los
Angeles teenager who says Patricia told him she
willingly took part in the holdup. The FBI and
police, meanwhile, continued the search for her.
Israel-Syria 'Move Closer 9
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger has moved Israel and Syria "considerably
closer" to agreement on thinning out their forces on
the Golan Heights, a senior U.S. official said last
night.
He said the breakthrough resulted from
Kissinger's introduction of undisclosed American
ideas, first in a meeting with Premier Golda Meir
and Israeli negotiators and later in a 4'/2-hour talk
with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus.
In a long day of shuttle diplomacy, the official
said, Kissinger also made progress on determining
the size of the U.N. force that will patrol the
thinned-out regions as well as the demilitarized
buffer zone between the Israeli and Syrian armies.
Kissinger will report to Israeli leaders this
morning and return to Damascus later in the day or
early tomorrow, hoping to wrap up the over all
disengagement settlement.

In any event, the official said, Kissinger will head
back to Washington by Sunday.
Irish Move To Avoid Strike
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Militant
Protestant strike leaders in Northern Ireland
announced moves yesterday to avoid a complete
power blackout and a confrontation with British
troops.
They said they would permit essential supplies of
gas, oil and electricity to reach power plants as long
as output was limited to 60 percent of normal.
Since the strike began more than a week ago,
electricity has been generated at less than a third of
the normal level.
Bellfast's public health and social services were
severely crippled.
Garbage was piled high because sanitation
workers were off the job for the ninth straight day,
and electricity shortages turned off sewage
'•"-atment plants.
Protestant workers called the strike to protest
British government plans for a council of Ireland
which would give the predominantly Roman
Catholic Irish republic a say in Northern Ireland's
affairs.
Authorities agreed Wednesday to postpone plans
for the council, but the strikers scoffed at the offer
as a "confidence trick."
Motorists waited for four hours and more to get
gas. Supplies were expected to run out by nightfall.
Emergency plans were made to try to secure
gasoline supplies for ambulances, fire trucks and
police cars.
Today's Weather
Patchy low clouds near the coast spreading
inland locally late nights and mornings through
tomorrow. Lows today and tomorrow morning in
the upper 40s and low 50s. Highs both days mid 60s
to mid 70s.
WASHINGTON - The chief counsel of the
House impeachment panel declared yesterday the
White House Watergate transcripts are "inadequate
and unsatisfactory."
John Doar said he told the Judiciary Committee
he is concerned both about the accuracy of the
documents "and the judgments of the President and
his counsel in deleting material on the grounds of
relevance."
President Nixon's chief Watergate lawyer, James
D. St. Clair, took affront at Doar's remarks and
wrote Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., that
they were "gratuitous in the extreme."
Despite Doar's assessment, neither he nor Rodino
would immediately support proposals aimed at
pressuring Nixon further to turn over remaining
tapes of the conversations.
In the face of a second presidential rebuke
Wednesday of committee subpoenas demanding
those tapes and other data, Rodino said the panel
should continue to subpoena evidence it deems
necessary — and consider any rejections as possibly
impeachable offenses in themselves.
The committee met in a closed, abbreviated
session during which it heard evidence focusing on
the first half of April 1973, when the Watergate
cover-up began to unravel.
Felony Charges Outrage Hearsts
HILLSBOROUGH — Patricia Hearst's parents are
outraged at statements by authorities who have filed
felony charges against her, an attorney said
yesterday.
"I tend to agree with their outrage," former U.S.
Atty. Cecil Poole said after meeting with Randolph
and Catherine Hearst. Poole, an Oakland attorney,
said he offered his services as counsel for Patricia
Hearst.
'They expressed outrage at the excessive
statements of law enforcement personnel,
particularly statements by the Los Angeles district

attorney who said he has a veritable flood of charges
against Miss Hearst," Poole told newsmen.
He said statements were "counterproductive"
and "unfair" and are probably "prejudicing the case
of the defendants."
Dist. atty. Joseph P. Busch of Los Angeles has
filed 19 charges against Patricia, including counts of
kidnaping, robbery and assault with a deadly
weapon. "In our opinion, Miss Hearst was acting on
her own free will," Busch said after filing the
charges.
Along with Patricia, authorities also are seeking
William and Emily Harris. The three were allegedly
involved in a shoplifting attempt at a sporting goods
store in a Los Angeles suburb on May 17. Patricia
allegedly sprayed the front of the store with
machine-gun fire, allowing the Harrises to escape.

Emergency plans were made to try to secure

WASHINGTON - The chief counsel of the
House impeachment panel declared yesterday the
White House Watergate transcripts are "inadequate
and unsatisfactory."
John Doar said he told the Judiciary Committee
he is concerned both about the accuracy of the
documents "and the judgments of the President and
his counsel in deleting material on the grounds of
relevance."
President Nixon's chief Watergate lawyer, James
D. St. Clair, took affront at Doar's remarks and
wrote Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., that
they were "gratuitous in the extreme."
Despite Doar's assessment, neither he nor Rodino
would immediately support proposals aimed at
pressuring Nixon further to turn over remaining
tapes of the conversations.
In the face of a second presidential rebuke
Wednesday of committee subpoenas demanding
those tapes and other data, Rodino said the panel
should continue to subpoena evidence it deems
necessary — and consider any rejections as possibly
impeachable offenses in themselves.
The committee met in a closed, abbreviated
session during which it heard evidence focusing on
the first half of April 1973, when the Watergate
cover-up began to unravel.
Felony Charges Outrage Hearsts
HILLSBOROUGH — Patricia Hearst's parents are
outraged at statements by authorities who have filed
felony charges against her, an attorney said
yesterday.
"I tend to agree with their outrage," former U.S.
Atty. Cecil Poole said after meeting with Randolph
and Catherine Hearst. Poole, an Oakland attorney,
said he offered his services as counsel for Patricia
Hearst.
'They expressed outrage at the excessive
statements of law enforcement personnel,
particularly statements by the Los Angeles district

attorney who said he has a veritable flood of charges
against Miss Hearst," Poole told newsmen.
He said statements were "counterproductive"
and "unfair" and are probably "prejudicing the case
of the defendants."
Dist. atty. Joseph P. Busch of Los Angeles has
filed 19 charges against Patricia, including counts of
kidnaping, robbery and assault with a deadly
weapon. "In our opinion, Miss Hearst was acting on
her own free will," Busch said after filing the
charges.
Along with Patricia, authorities also are seeking
William and Emily Harris. The three were allegedly
involved in a shoplifting attempt at a sporting goods
store in a Los Angeles suburb on May 17. Patricia
allegedly sprayed the front of the store with
machine-gun fire, allowing the Harrises to escape.
A federal grand jury probing a violent bank
robbery heard testimony yesterday from a Los
Angeles teenager who says Patricia told him she
willingly took part in the holdup. The FBI and
police, meanwhile, continued the search for her.
Israel-Syria 'Move Closer 9
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger has moved Israel and Syria "considerably
closer" to agreement on thinning out their forces on
the Golan Heights, a senior U.S. official said last
night.
He said the breakthrough resulted from
Kissinger's introduction of undisclosed American
ideas, first in a meeting with Premier Golda Meir
and Israeli negotiators and later in a 4'/2-hour talk
with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus.
In a long day of shuttle diplomacy, the official
said, Kissinger also made progress on determining
the size of the U.N. force that will patrol the
thinned-out regions as well as the demilitarized
buffer zone between the Israeli and Syrian armies.
Kissinger will report to Israeli leaders this
morning and return to Damascus later in the day or
early tomorrow, hoping to wrap up the over all
disengagement settlement.

In any event, the official said, Kissinger will head
back to Washington by Sunday.
Irish Move To Avoid Strike
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Militant
Protestant strike leaders in Northern Ireland
announced moves yesterday to avoid a complete
power blackout and a confrontation with British
troops.
They said they would permit essential supplies of
gas, oil and electricity to reach power plants as long
as output was limited to 60 percent of normal.
Since the strike began more than a week ago,
electricity has been generated at less than a third of
the normal level.
Bellfast's public health and social services were
severely crippled.
Garbage was piled high because sanitation
workers were off the job for the ninth straight day,
and electricity shortages turned off sewage
'•"-atment plants.
Protestant workers called the strike to protest
British government plans for a council of Ireland
which would give the predominantly Roman
Catholic Irish republic a say in Northern Ireland's
affairs.
Authorities agreed Wednesday to postpone plans
for the council, but the strikers scoffed at the offer
as a "confidence trick."
Motorists waited for four hours and more to get
gas. Supplies were expected to run out by nightfall.
Emergency plans were made to try to secure
gasoline supplies for ambulances, fire trucks and
police cars.
