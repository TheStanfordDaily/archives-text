# USE Pickets Prevent Warehouse Deliveries

### BRUCE KADDEN 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union pickets yesterday marched in
front of a Menlo Park warehouse used
to store supplies that could not be
delivered to campus because of the
strike, and turned back all eight trucks
which attempted to make deliveries
there, according to Tim Knaak, a USE
spokesman.
About 25 pickets managed to stop
the trucks that tried to make deliveries
to the building, convincing the drivers
not to cross picket lines, Knaak said.
The union learned about the
warehouse from a Teamster's Union
driver, he added.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said last
night the University had rented the
warehouse, located at 138 Jefferson
Street, as part of its strike contingency
plan.
Augsburger said the warehouse was

a "receiving area for any supplies that
were coming, that might not be able to
reach campus."
Uncertain Jurisdiction
It is uncertain whether the
temporary restraining order issued
Tuesday, which limits the number of
pickets at entrances to two, applies to
the warehouse site.
Augsburger said he thought the
restraining order applied. "The
temporary restraining order was
intended to apply to situations like
that which prevented people or
vehicular passage."
However, Knaak claimed that the
order "only applies on campus within
the area shown on the map." The
warehouse site is not located within
that area.
Augsburger said, "There were other
clauses which pertained to movement
outside the delineated area" affecting
"actions that were obstructions of
vehicular movement or people."
One part of the order states that
"physically obstructing or interfering
with" any pickups or deliveries to the
University "at any place, whether on
the delineated Stanford land or not"
must be stopped.
No Order Enforcement
No attempt was made to enforce
the order, if it applied. Augsburger
added that whether the University will
seek a new order or not, assuming the
current one does not apply, "depends
upon the impact upon University
operations."
In a minor incident at the Medical
Center loading dock, Tim Gadus, a

striking lab assistant, claimed a
University van rolled over his foot
yesterday morning. Two security
policemen at the dock verified the
report.
Not Limping
Gadus said he was walking in front
of the van when it ran over his foot.
He said he does not plan to press
charges against the driver. Gadus did
not appear to be limping.
Acts of apparent sabotage
continued as two trucks of the
Stanford Press were found yesterday
morning "with hydraulic lines to
brakes cut," according to Plant
Services Director Dan De Young. One
truck also had a flat tire.
One of the trucks was driven before
the sabotage was noticed. The driver
reportedly came close to hitting a
pedestrian when he could not stop at
an intersection because of the brake
failure."
Not Union Members
Bindery Supervisor Frank Luiz said
that none of the Press employees are
in the USE bargaining unit and that his
union had not been asked by USE to
observe picket lines. USE pickets have
marched in front of the Press
consistently during the last week.
De Young also said that 10 other
vehicles received punctured tires from
tacks, but said that there was no
reported trouble with any plumbing.
Both sides reported very little
progress at the negotiating table
yesterday, although the issue of pay
was brought up for the first time.
