# Israeli Geophysicist Denied Russian Visa
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Stanford geophysicist and Israeli
citizen Amos M. Nur will not receive a
visa to attend an international
scientific conference in Russia, Soviet
authorities have decided.
That government's Intourist
bureau, after ignoring two earlier visa
requests, cabled here Tuesday that Nur
would not be allowed to present a
paper on groundwater movements
preceding earthquakes. Nur, famed in
his field for works on earthquake
prediction, said the visa was denied
because he is a citizen of Israel.
"I think the most likely reason is
that I have an Israeli passport. In fact,
that is the reason," Nur commented
last night.
Geophysics Prof. Robert L.
Kovach, co-author of the paper Nur
planned to present, received a visa
more than one month ago. He will
attend the conference without Nur.
"It's always a big question as to
whether you should boycott a
conference, telling your friends and
associates not to go," Nur stated.
"You embarrass the Russian
government, but you . . . also can
cause trouble for other scientists [in
Russia] as well."
Nur explained that the Soviet
Union might have taken action against

the scientist-hosts in the event of a
boycott. Kovach, saying he was "not
surprised" that Nur was denied a visa,
commented that similar Soviet
decisions had occurred before.
"The Russians pulled this ... [in] a
similar meeting in 1971. They
wouldn't let the people from
Formosa-China in," Kovach pointed
out.
Nur is president-elect of the
tectonophysics section of the
American Geophysical Union (AGU),
which will protest the Russians' action
to its parent International Union of
Geodesy and Geophysics (lUGG).
"The lUGG ... [has] decided that
no internationally sponsored
conference will take place in a country
which excludes . . . qualified
scientists," Nur said. "Scientists feel
it's important to keep politics
separated from science."
The AGU will announce today
what action it plans to take, according
to Nur. Apparently, the University
does not plan to make a separate
protest. Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig said he knows of no
planned University response.
"I haven't heard a word [about
it]," Rosenzweig remarked. "I've been
so preoccupied with other matters that
I haven't had a chance to think about
it."

Nur explained that the Soviet
Union might have taken action against

the scientist-hosts in the event of a
boycott. Kovach, saying he was "not
surprised" that Nur was denied a visa,
commented that similar Soviet
decisions had occurred before.
"The Russians pulled this ... [in] a
similar meeting in 1971. They
wouldn't let the people from
Formosa-China in," Kovach pointed
out.
Nur is president-elect of the
tectonophysics section of the
American Geophysical Union (AGU),
which will protest the Russians' action
to its parent International Union of
Geodesy and Geophysics (lUGG).
"The lUGG ... [has] decided that
no internationally sponsored
conference will take place in a country
which excludes . . . qualified
scientists," Nur said. "Scientists feel
it's important to keep politics
separated from science."
The AGU will announce today
what action it plans to take, according
to Nur. Apparently, the University
does not plan to make a separate
protest. Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig said he knows of no
planned University response.
"I haven't heard a word [about
it]," Rosenzweig remarked. "I've been
so preoccupied with other matters that
I haven't had a chance to think about
it."
