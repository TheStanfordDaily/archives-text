# Berlin Center To Open In January
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
The Overseas Studies Office yesterday
announced the formation of a new study center in
Berlin to open in January, 1975.
The center will accommodate about 30 students
and will provide courses in German language and
culture, as well as more advanced courses in areas
such as international relations, economics and
modern German history. It will join three other
German-language centers, in Bonn, Beutelsbach and
Vienna.
In addition to the courses at the center taught in
English, students with sufficient competence in
German will have the opportunity to study at the
nearby Free University of Berlin.
Center's First Director
G. Robert Hamrdla, director of the Academic
Information Center and former administrative
director of Stanford-in-Germany in Beutelsbach,
will serve as the center's first director.
History Prof. Gordon A. Craig, who has served in
an advisory capacity in the planning of the center,
was also present at the press conference in the
Overseas Studies Office. Craig will teach a special
introductory course on "Germany since 1945" next
fall quarter for students intending to enroll in the
Eerlin program.
A University representative is currently
negotiating with the city of Berlin for the rental of a
large house near the Free University which would
provide student housing, offices and study areas.
Other housing arrangements have not been
worked out, but Assoc. Overseas Studies Director
Don Price said "we have no bias for or against"
housing students together.
Hamrdla and Overseas Studies Director Mark
Mancall stressed the academic flexibility of the

Berlin center, which will allow students to study
either at the Free University or any of several other
institutions in the city.
Unlike the study centers in Bonn and Vienna,
Stanford students in Berlin would not receive credit
from the local university, but would take courses
"by invitation" with credit through the Stanford
center.
Language Requirement Dropped
There is no requirement that students study
German before attending the center, but such
background is strongly urged. All students at the
center will be required to take an intensive course in
German and a seminar on Berlin during their stay.
"It would be foolish to live and study in a
foreign city and not study the language," Mancall
added.
Dropping the previous language requirement
allows a foreign study opportunity for students with
academic interests which could be profitably
pursued there, he said.
Transfer Opportunities
A further degree of flexibility is the opportunity
to transfer among the various German-language
study centers. According to Mancall, students could
go to Vienna or Beutelsbach in the fall and transfer
to Berlin in January.
While the center will be somewhat more oriented
toward modern history and international relations
than the arts, there are ample cultural and artistic
opportunities in Berlin. Hamrdla and Craig cited the
city's many museums, theaters and "a lively literary
scene."
No deadline has been set for application to the
new center, but Mancall said admission will
generally be first come, first served.

The Overseas Studies Office yesterday
announced the formation of a new study center in
Berlin to open in January, 1975.
The center will accommodate about 30 students
and will provide courses in German language and
culture, as well as more advanced courses in areas
such as international relations, economics and
modern German history. It will join three other
German-language centers, in Bonn, Beutelsbach and
Vienna.
In addition to the courses at the center taught in
English, students with sufficient competence in
German will have the opportunity to study at the
nearby Free University of Berlin.
Center's First Director
G. Robert Hamrdla, director of the Academic
Information Center and former administrative
director of Stanford-in-Germany in Beutelsbach,
will serve as the center's first director.
History Prof. Gordon A. Craig, who has served in
an advisory capacity in the planning of the center,
was also present at the press conference in the
Overseas Studies Office. Craig will teach a special
introductory course on "Germany since 1945" next
fall quarter for students intending to enroll in the
Eerlin program.
A University representative is currently
negotiating with the city of Berlin for the rental of a
large house near the Free University which would
provide student housing, offices and study areas.
Other housing arrangements have not been
worked out, but Assoc. Overseas Studies Director
Don Price said "we have no bias for or against"
housing students together.
Hamrdla and Overseas Studies Director Mark
Mancall stressed the academic flexibility of the

Berlin center, which will allow students to study
either at the Free University or any of several other
institutions in the city.
Unlike the study centers in Bonn and Vienna,
Stanford students in Berlin would not receive credit
from the local university, but would take courses
"by invitation" with credit through the Stanford
center.
Language Requirement Dropped
There is no requirement that students study
German before attending the center, but such
background is strongly urged. All students at the
center will be required to take an intensive course in
German and a seminar on Berlin during their stay.
"It would be foolish to live and study in a
foreign city and not study the language," Mancall
added.
Dropping the previous language requirement
allows a foreign study opportunity for students with
academic interests which could be profitably
pursued there, he said.
Transfer Opportunities
A further degree of flexibility is the opportunity
to transfer among the various German-language
study centers. According to Mancall, students could
go to Vienna or Beutelsbach in the fall and transfer
to Berlin in January.
While the center will be somewhat more oriented
toward modern history and international relations
than the arts, there are ample cultural and artistic
opportunities in Berlin. Hamrdla and Craig cited the
city's many museums, theaters and "a lively literary
scene."
No deadline has been set for application to the
new center, but Mancall said admission will
