Within a matter of days
California Democrats will be
nominating their candidate to
seek the state's gubernatorial
position. Tha nominee, in the
presence of a post-Watergate
morality, will be on the road to
victory in November.
A number of well intentioned
candidates are among the 19
seeking the nomination, but only
one stands out above all others.
That is candidate Jerome Waldie,
a U.S. congressman from Contra
Costa County.
Waldie is a direct, plain
speaking man, capable of
alleviating the ills of our state. He
is well experienced, having spent
eight years as State Assemblyman
— the last six as Majority Leader,
and having served eight years on
Capitol Hill.
Waldie presented the initial
impeachment resolution to the
House of Representatives, and
now serves on the famed House
.Judiciary Committee. Waldie is an
effective, liberal legislator — who
has great potential for California.
He advocates improved health
care, and revitalization of the
State's mental institutions.
Supports UFW
He supports the struggle of the
United Farm Workers to receive
adequate incomes from their
employers. He supports and voted
for the Equal Rights Amendment.
He is a co-author of the
Waldie-Cranston amendment to
protect the confidential sources of
the press.
Waldie has earned a 100
percent rating from the Consumer
Federation of America in the area
of consumer protection. This is
the kind of candidate that I would
like to see the party nominate

June 4.
Waldie, according to various
public opinion polls, ranks among
the top three or four contending
for the nomination. He faces some
strong well-financed opposition
on June 4, but if his voice is heard
throughout this state, and if his
platform is considered by the
democratic voter, then he will
receive the nomination.
Most Democrats Undecided
The opinion polls also indicate
that the vast majority of
California Democrats have not
selected their choice for the
gubernatorial nomination. With
the dominant, people-orientated
campaign that Waldie has going for
him, with the massive and
dedicated support of thousands of
people — Jerry Waldie will
trample his wealthy opposition.
Throughout the country
Americans are searching for a new
type of politician. Not necessarily
a liberal or conservative politician,
not necessarily a Democrat or
Republican, but an honest and
uncorruptable politician. One that
has struggled for his conscience
from the beginning, and not for
his special interest constituents.
Jerome Waldie has proven
himself in the State Legislature
and in the United States Congress,
with a record of organization and
success. He has the skill and
motiviation to serve California.
Nothing could be better for the
State of California than to elect
Jerry Waldie governor, and send
Ronald Reagan back to
Hollywood.
