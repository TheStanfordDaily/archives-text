# What Is Time?

Javed Shah

What is time? The shadow on
the dial, the striking of the clock,
the running of the sand day and
night, summer and winter, years,
centuries — these are but arbitrary
and outward signs, the measure of
Time, not Time itself.
Time is the life of the soul. The
unlimitable silence, the never
resting thing called time, rolling,
rushing on, swift, silent, like an
all-embracing ocean-tide on which
we and the whole Universe swim
like exhalations, like apparitions
which are, and then are not: this
is forever very literally a miracle, a
thing to strike us dumb .. . for we
have no world to speak about it.
Wherever anything lives, there
is, open somewhere, a register in
which time is being inscribed. It is
our most precious, most limited
resource. We cannot rent, buy,
borrow or steal more of it.
Yet few use it efficiently and
no one ever reaches perfection.
We can always make better use of
time, and the more we strive to do
so, the more we shall enrich our
student and practical life. G.B.
Shaw says most of us can do three
or four times the work that we
ordinarily do without lengthening
working hours or even driving
ourselves to exhaustion by day's
end. Even if we have apparently
reached our highest level of
efficiency, it is usually possible to
improve by a little extra effort.
Check On Time
Making a time table and
keeping a time-sheet is a check on
our spending time. It should
enable you to compare what you
ought to do with what you
actually do; you would most
likely find that a high proportion

of your time is wasted on
non-essential working, day
dreaming and unnecessary
meeting with friends.
Now we come to some tips of
time saving: first change your
personal attitudes and habits.
Value your time. Become
time-conscious without having
anxiety, because that's the route
to an ulcer. Shakespeare says,
"For holy offices I have a time; a
time to think upon the part of
business which I hear, I, the state;
and nature does require her time
of preservation."
Be a first timer. Aim to
complete each necessary task
before it is too late. "He that hath
time and looketh for a better time
loseth time. Time comes that he
repents himself of time."
Learn When To Speak
Learn when to speak, and
when to shut up. You will get a
reputation for wisdom and it will
also save you time. Remember we
only begin to learn when our
mouth closes and our eyes open.
Read and work efficiently. By
all means try a quicker reading
course. Focus your thought and
don't race through the script. Be a
time saver, not a time server. You
may delay, but time will not. If
you keep at it, you will steadily
increase your capacity to bear
time as time goes by, and it will
provide the incentive to do even
better tomorrow.
Whether we wake or we sleep,
Whether we carol or weep,
The sun with his planets in chime,
Marketh the going of time.

time as time goes by, and it will
provide the incentive to do even
better tomorrow.
Whether we wake or we sleep,
Whether we carol or weep,
The sun with his planets in chime,
Marketh the going of time.

What is time? The shadow on
the dial, the striking of the clock,
the running of the sand day and
night, summer and winter, years,
centuries — these are but arbitrary
and outward signs, the measure of
Time, not Time itself.
Time is the life of the soul. The
unlimitable silence, the never
resting thing called time, rolling,
rushing on, swift, silent, like an
all-embracing ocean-tide on which
we and the whole Universe swim
like exhalations, like apparitions
which are, and then are not: this
is forever very literally a miracle, a
thing to strike us dumb .. . for we
have no world to speak about it.
Wherever anything lives, there
is, open somewhere, a register in
which time is being inscribed. It is
our most precious, most limited
resource. We cannot rent, buy,
borrow or steal more of it.
Yet few use it efficiently and
no one ever reaches perfection.
We can always make better use of
time, and the more we strive to do
so, the more we shall enrich our
student and practical life. G.B.
Shaw says most of us can do three
or four times the work that we
ordinarily do without lengthening
working hours or even driving
ourselves to exhaustion by day's
end. Even if we have apparently
reached our highest level of
efficiency, it is usually possible to
improve by a little extra effort.
Check On Time
Making a time table and
keeping a time-sheet is a check on
our spending time. It should
enable you to compare what you
ought to do with what you
actually do; you would most
likely find that a high proportion

of your time is wasted on
non-essential working, day
dreaming and unnecessary
meeting with friends.
Now we come to some tips of
time saving: first change your
personal attitudes and habits.
Value your time. Become
time-conscious without having
anxiety, because that's the route
to an ulcer. Shakespeare says,
"For holy offices I have a time; a
time to think upon the part of
business which I hear, I, the state;
and nature does require her time
of preservation."
Be a first timer. Aim to
complete each necessary task
before it is too late. "He that hath
time and looketh for a better time
loseth time. Time comes that he
repents himself of time."
Learn When To Speak
Learn when to speak, and
when to shut up. You will get a
reputation for wisdom and it will
also save you time. Remember we
only begin to learn when our
mouth closes and our eyes open.
Read and work efficiently. By
all means try a quicker reading
course. Focus your thought and
don't race through the script. Be a
time saver, not a time server. You
may delay, but time will not. If
you keep at it, you will steadily
increase your capacity to bear
time as time goes by, and it will
provide the incentive to do even
better tomorrow.
Whether we wake or we sleep,
Whether we carol or weep,
The sun with his planets in chime,
Marketh the going of time.
