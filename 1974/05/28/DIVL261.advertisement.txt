TO OBTAIN REFUNDS - Refunds will be offered for the six-day period begin
ning Wednesday, May 29, through Monday, June 3. Whether further refunds
will be offered beyond June 3 will depend upon the strike situation and
whether Food Service can open additional units.
If you choose to take a refund, please go to the Cashier's Office, ground
floor, Old Union, from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday, May 28, or
Wednesday, May 29. A third hole will be punched in your student body
card. You will receive a refund through Monday, June 3, at the full daily
price of your particular plan. For example, the daily price for a 7-B
plan is $3.33. If you request a refund on Tuesday, May 28, you will re
ceive $20.00 ($3.33/day for 6 days). If you request a refund on Wednesday,
May 29, you will still be opting out of the system through Monday, June 3,
but you will receive a correspondingly smaller refund.
TO RETURN TO THE SYSTEM - If you opted out the first and/or second week
but wish to return to the Food Service system, simply present your student
body I.D. card to the checker starting Wednesday, May 29.
Please call me at 497-4751 with your questions or suggestions.
Sincerely,
