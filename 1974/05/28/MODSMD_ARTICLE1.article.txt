# USE Strike Enters Third Week; Bargaining, Vandalism Continue
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
Eight major incidents of
sewer-system vandalism in University
dorms yesterday and Sunday marked
an otherwise peaceful second weekend
of the United Stanford Employees
(USE) union strike, according to
Student Housing Manager Alan
Cummings.
Cummings said the sewer damage,
caused by balloons filled with
chemicals that expand to block pipes,
occurred in Lagunita, Roble, Toyon
and Wilbur houses. He said that each
incident of plumbing damage would
cost the University between $150 and
$300 to repair.
"We had people working from 3:30
to midnight on Sunday to fix these
backups," said Cummings. "I think it's
time people realized how much these
things are beginning to cost."
Incidents of suspected sabotage to
sewer systems and tires of University
vehicles have been reported on almost
every day of the USE strike. To date
no University officials have publicly
suggested that the union is responsible
for the vandalism.

Food Service Manager Maxine
Anderson announced yesterday that
meal plan rebates will be available
starting at 9 this morning for the
six-day period starting tomorrow and
ending Monday, June 3.
She also announced that the same
dining halls — in Florence Moore,
Stern and Wilbur Halls — that were
open last week will be the only Food
Service eating places open this week.
"With Dead Week coming up, we
don't quite know what to expect,"
Anderson stated. "We've generally had
lower-than-usual attendance in the
dorm food services this week, so it's
not likely that we'll open any other
dining halls next week."
Anderson said strike provisions last
week were "considerably smoother
than the week before" when 1605
students, about half of those on meal
plans, got rebates.
Only Joint Statements
Intensive negotiations between USE
and University officials continued
throughout the weekend and
yesterday. The chief negotiators for
both sides, USE President Jim Berk
and University legal counsel Douglas
Barton, agreed that the two sides
should not comment individually on
the negotiations.
A statement signed by Barton and
Berk read, "In view of improved
developments in negotiations towards
the settlement of the strike at
Stanford, both parties agree that daily
progress will not be reported in print
or reported to the press except in the
form of joint statements."
'This statement is to show that
we're more concerned with the
progress of negotiations than we are
with public posture," said union
spokesman Jan Sutter. "This wil, 1 ,?ul
out a lot of the public-affa, J, "s
the strike."
Sutter noted that the union would
discontinue issuing its daily strike
reports. "It takes an awful lot of
energy to issue the reports; the new
policy gets us off the hook," he said.
Crane Controversy
A large crane was successfully
moved back into the Medical Center
construction site on Friday morning,
but accounts of the incident by
University Vice President for Business
and Finance Robert Augsburger and
union members Sutter and Bobßritton
differ considerably.
Augsburger said he understood that
no police or University officials were
on hand when the crane arrived.

"There may have been some attempt
to block the crane, but our reports
were that it got in pretty much under
its own steam," Augsburger noted.
He said that the University had
received no complaints on the bringing
of the crane into the construction site,
which is staffed by non-union
sub-contracted workers.
'Broke Through Gate'
Sutter and Britton, who both
claimed they were picketing at the site
when the crane came in, said the crane
speeded past them and broke through
a temporary gate before stopping.
"The crane just came right in
maybe doing 25 miles per hour," said

Britton. "It didn't slow down and it
didn't stop. When it came in it hit me
on the left side and flung me down."
Sutter said the union pickets were
obeying the court order restricting the
number of pickets in front of any
entrance to two. "There was no major
effort to stop the crane, not like last
week," he said. "We did expect him to
slow down, though, as our agreement
with the University specifies," he
added.
He also claimed that there were
several local policemen and University
lawyers on hand when the crane came
through.

GATECRASHER? — This crane entered the Medical Center construction site
Friday with little trouble despite earlier indications that USE members might try
to prevent its entry. Two USE members claim the crane struck one as it
entered the site, but University officials said they were aware of no such
incident.
