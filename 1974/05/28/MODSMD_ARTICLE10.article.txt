# Rent Control--Solution Or Problem?
## 
### 
William Ross

It is generally agreed that the housing
shortage in Palo Alto is severe, enabling many
landlords to charge tenants unfair rents. In an
effort to improve the situation, a group of
concerned Palo Alto citizens have formed the
Fair Rent Committee. This organization is
sponsoring a June 4 ballot initiative —
Proposition B — that would create a rent
control board.
The board would force landlords to
maintain rents at a reasonable level and
would induce them to make improvements
on their property. According to Bradley
Dowden, committee treasurer, the board
would drive speculators out of the Palo Alto
market while insuring property landlords
reasonable profits.
These are admirable goals, but
unfortunately the board as conceived by the
committee is a device that is more likely to
•aggravate tb r an to ameliorate the housing
shortage ifn tPaJo Alio.
A At the risk of appearing to commit the ad
hominem fallacy, it must be pointed out that
the board is being opposed by many persons
and groups that have hardly been inimical to
so called progressive housing measures in the
past.
Liberal Opposition
For example, the Stanford-Palo Alto
branch of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)
has announced its opposition to the proposed
board. Mayor Kirke Comstock and
Councilman Byron Sher, both long known
for their interest in fair housing and
consumer protection, are also opposing the
initiative.
Although many landlords are no doubt
opposing the board for selfish economic
reasons, the quality of much of the
opposition makes it worthwhile to examine
the proposed board in order to understand its

flaws.
As designed, the board would require all
rents to be rolled back three years to the
prices that existed in January 1973. Since
that is the month that wage-price controls
were abandoned by the Nixon
administration, the rents would really be
rolled back to August 1971, the month
Nixon announced the freeze.
Considering the severe inflation that has
occurred during this period, many landlords
would no doubt be forced out of business,
thus creating a much more severe housing
shortage.
As Mayor Comstock observed last week,
low and middle income units (including those
rented by Stanford students who received
lousy numbers in the spring housing draw)
would be the first to disappear from the
market.
Bureaucratic Structure
Second, the board would be structured in
such a bureaucratic manner that it would
discourage many landlords from staying in
the market. The board would require an
adjustment hearing on each individual unit,
and this would create immense administrative
problems.
Two Palo Alto homeowners I spoke to
during research for a Daily story told me last
week that they would stop renting to
Stanford students in order to avoid the red
tape.
As currently constituted, the proposed
board would drive landlords out of the Palo
Alto housing market.
As for maintenance, there is no evidence
that rent control would cause landlords to
improve the quality of property. A report
issued by the Rand Institute shows that in
New York during the 1960s the quality of
housing under rent control did not improve.
Furthermore, 114,000 units were abandoned

by landlords or sold to private owners.
As currently constituted, the proposed
board would drive landlords out of the
housing market in Palo Alto.
Tenants Unprotected
Furthermore, the board would make no
provision to protect tenants who would be
evicted. In a Daily interview in March,
Dowden told me this provision has been
omitted becuase the committee did not want
to make the issue any more controversial
than it already is.
Meanwhile, there seems to be some
question regarding the constitutionality of an
eviction clause in Berkeley's rent control
provision. But without any provision for
eviction, it is possible that many members in
Palo Alto would be thrown out of their
residences without any legal remedy if rent
control went into effect because of the
withdrawal of landlords from the market.
Finally, the rent control board would be
composed of a cross-section of Palo Alto
residents who would not be likely to set
stringent enough regulations to help renters
but whose board would create enough
bureaucratic restrictions to drive landlords
out of the housing market.
I believe that the government has the duty
to intervene in private enterprise if blatant
injustice is being perpetrated upon large
numbers of people; I do not oppose the
proposed board because of any ideological
scruples.
Rather, I am convinced that it will not
serve the purpose for which its well-meaning
architects intended it. The board would
create more problems than it would solve.
The housing situation in Palo Alto would
be no better under the board than it is now —
and it probably would be much worse.
