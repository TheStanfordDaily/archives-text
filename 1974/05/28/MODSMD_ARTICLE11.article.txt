Christ As Light
Editor:
Bill Evers thinks that the
Biblical Jesus is morally
indefensible (Daily May 23). Jesus
Christ requires no defense: He did
not defend Himself at the trial
before Pontius Pilate and the mob
of accusers. Those who shouted,
"Crucify Him" also thought that
He was morally indefensible.
What the basic message of
Christ is about is that He came as
light into this world to show up
all human darkness and to save
each man and woman from the
consequences of darkness.
His challenge to Bill and me
and all others is to admit that
such darkness is in each of us and
to accept Him, the light. It does
not help us a bit by refraining to
look into our own darkness and
saying that light is darkness.
If anyone here on campus
wishes to inquire further into this
matter and to find out the
relationship between light and
life, I am sure that such
organizations as the Campus
Crusade and the Chinese Christian
Fellowship would be only too
willing to help at their meetings.

Bible Critically Examined
Editor:
As I read Bill Evers' recent
column (Daily, May 23) I couldn't
help but wonder where he found
his opinion that "a Christian who
knows the views of the Biblical
Jesus and yet accepts them on
faith as morally sound has refused
to use his critical judgment."
Evers claims that the

punishment of hell does not fit
the crime of sin. Sin is basically an
attitude, a rejection of God. Since
we all, every Christian included,
haved sinned (Romans 3:23), we
have no way to save ourselves.
In view of this and His great
love for us, Jesus came to earth to
die so that we might be saved. He
also had to rise from the dead to
show his power over death.
The resurrection, being the
event on which Christianity hangs
together or falls apart, must be
critically examined. Bible scholars
have determined that the written
accounts of six main witnesses —
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul
and Peter — were all written
within 10 to 20 years after the
resurrection.
This evidence disputes the
claim that these accounts were
written over a hundred years after
the resurrection, and were
therefore filled with myths and
legends, instead of hard facts.
In short, Christian beliefs have
been, and are being critically
examined. This only reveals the
truth of these beliefs and
strengthens the faith of those who
believe them.

1 share with Congressman Sisk
(Daily, May 24) a desire to see
postal reform, but I don't agree
that the way to accomplish it is
by returning the current postal
service to direct government
control.
Government propaganda aside,
the U.S. Postal Service is not a
private enterprise. It is a state
controlled monopoloy, a glowing

example of corporate capitalism.
Its abuses are those to be
expected in any monopoly
situation where there is a free
hand to set prices so as to cover
costs without the competition
which would normally serve as
motivation to reduce those costs.
What the postal service needs is
what every industry needs — free
competition, in other words
private mails.
The Constitution of the United
States empowers Congress to
"establish" post offices and post
roads, such functions being
essential to conducting the
business of the Congress. In
pronounced contrast to wording
used elsewhere, it does not grant
"sole privilege" of establishing the
mails.
Indeed, there is ample evidence
in the Federalist Papers and other
contemporary documents that it
was never the intention of the
founding fathers to grant Congress
exclusive control of the mails.
For a more extensive
discussion of .this topic the reader
is referred to an essay by
Lysander Spooner, early victim of
the government mail monopoly,
entitled 'The Unconstitutionality
of the Laws of Congress
Prohibiting Private Mails."

Editor:
We would like to point out a
small but significant error in the
information given in Sandy
White's article "Leah Kaplan:
Dean for Women" (Daily, May
21).
Not all minority groups have
official representatives in the
University, as stated in the article.
The Asian-American and Asian
students number about 500,
represent the largest ethnic
minority population at Stanford,
and are the only group without an
advocate in the administration.
Fortunately, from January to
June 1974, Dr. Allan Seid was
appointed a counselor at Cowell
on a temporary substitution basis
and is directing much of his effort
to the needs of the Asian and
Asian-American students on
campus.
However, it remains that
before January and after June,
there was and is no administrative
spokesperson who can address
him/herself to the special
concerns and issues faced by the
Asian-American minority.

Bible Critically Examined
Editor:
As I read Bill Evers' recent
column (Daily, May 23) I couldn't
help but wonder where he found
his opinion that "a Christian who
knows the views of the Biblical
Jesus and yet accepts them on
faith as morally sound has refused
to use his critical judgment."
Evers claims that the

punishment of hell does not fit
the crime of sin. Sin is basically an
attitude, a rejection of God. Since
we all, every Christian included,
haved sinned (Romans 3:23), we
have no way to save ourselves.
In view of this and His great
love for us, Jesus came to earth to
die so that we might be saved. He
also had to rise from the dead to
show his power over death.
The resurrection, being the
event on which Christianity hangs
together or falls apart, must be
critically examined. Bible scholars
have determined that the written
accounts of six main witnesses —
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul
and Peter — were all written
within 10 to 20 years after the
resurrection.
This evidence disputes the
claim that these accounts were
written over a hundred years after
the resurrection, and were
therefore filled with myths and
legends, instead of hard facts.
In short, Christian beliefs have
been, and are being critically
examined. This only reveals the
truth of these beliefs and
strengthens the faith of those who
believe them.

1 share with Congressman Sisk
(Daily, May 24) a desire to see
postal reform, but I don't agree
that the way to accomplish it is
by returning the current postal
service to direct government
control.
Government propaganda aside,
the U.S. Postal Service is not a
private enterprise. It is a state
controlled monopoloy, a glowing

example of corporate capitalism.
Its abuses are those to be
expected in any monopoly
situation where there is a free
hand to set prices so as to cover
costs without the competition
which would normally serve as
motivation to reduce those costs.
What the postal service needs is
what every industry needs — free
competition, in other words
private mails.
The Constitution of the United
States empowers Congress to
"establish" post offices and post
roads, such functions being
essential to conducting the
business of the Congress. In
pronounced contrast to wording
used elsewhere, it does not grant
"sole privilege" of establishing the
mails.
Indeed, there is ample evidence
in the Federalist Papers and other
contemporary documents that it
was never the intention of the
founding fathers to grant Congress
exclusive control of the mails.
For a more extensive
discussion of .this topic the reader
is referred to an essay by
Lysander Spooner, early victim of
the government mail monopoly,
entitled 'The Unconstitutionality
of the Laws of Congress
Prohibiting Private Mails."

We would like to point out a
small but significant error in the
information given in Sandy
White's article "Leah Kaplan:
Dean for Women" (Daily, May
21).
Not all minority groups have
official representatives in the
University, as stated in the article.
The Asian-American and Asian
students number about 500,
represent the largest ethnic
minority population at Stanford,
and are the only group without an
advocate in the administration.
Fortunately, from January to
June 1974, Dr. Allan Seid was
appointed a counselor at Cowell
on a temporary substitution basis
and is directing much of his effort
to the needs of the Asian and
Asian-American students on
campus.
However, it remains that
before January and after June,
there was and is no administrative
spokesperson who can address
him/herself to the special
concerns and issues faced by the
Asian-American minority.

Bill Evers thinks that the
Biblical Jesus is morally
indefensible (Daily May 23). Jesus
Christ requires no defense: He did
not defend Himself at the trial
before Pontius Pilate and the mob
of accusers. Those who shouted,
"Crucify Him" also thought that
He was morally indefensible.
What the basic message of
Christ is about is that He came as
light into this world to show up
all human darkness and to save
each man and woman from the
consequences of darkness.
His challenge to Bill and me
and all others is to admit that
such darkness is in each of us and
to accept Him, the light. It does
not help us a bit by refraining to
look into our own darkness and
saying that light is darkness.
If anyone here on campus
wishes to inquire further into this
matter and to find out the
relationship between light and
life, I am sure that such
organizations as the Campus
Crusade and the Chinese Christian
Fellowship would be only too
willing to help at their meetings.

event on which Christianity hangs
together or falls apart, must be
critically examined. Bible scholars
have determined that the written
accounts of six main witnesses —
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul
and Peter — were all written
within 10 to 20 years after the
resurrection.
This evidence disputes the
claim that these accounts were
written over a hundred years after
the resurrection, and were
therefore filled with myths and
legends, instead of hard facts.
In short, Christian beliefs have
been, and are being critically
examined. This only reveals the
truth of these beliefs and
strengthens the faith of those who
believe them.

Against Government Control
Editor:
1 share with Congressman Sisk
(Daily, May 24) a desire to see
postal reform, but I don't agree
that the way to accomplish it is
by returning the current postal
service to direct government
control.
Government propaganda aside,
the U.S. Postal Service is not a
private enterprise. It is a state
controlled monopoloy, a glowing

example of corporate capitalism.
Its abuses are those to be
expected in any monopoly
situation where there is a free
hand to set prices so as to cover
costs without the competition
which would normally serve as
motivation to reduce those costs.
What the postal service needs is
what every industry needs — free
competition, in other words
private mails.
The Constitution of the United
States empowers Congress to
"establish" post offices and post
roads, such functions being
essential to conducting the
business of the Congress. In
pronounced contrast to wording
used elsewhere, it does not grant
"sole privilege" of establishing the
mails.
Indeed, there is ample evidence
in the Federalist Papers and other
contemporary documents that it
was never the intention of the
founding fathers to grant Congress
exclusive control of the mails.
For a more extensive
discussion of .this topic the reader
is referred to an essay by
Lysander Spooner, early victim of
the government mail monopoly,
entitled 'The Unconstitutionality
of the Laws of Congress
Prohibiting Private Mails."

Need For Spokesperson
Editor:
We would like to point out a
small but significant error in the
information given in Sandy
White's article "Leah Kaplan:
Dean for Women" (Daily, May
21).
Not all minority groups have
official representatives in the
University, as stated in the article.
The Asian-American and Asian
students number about 500,
represent the largest ethnic
minority population at Stanford,
and are the only group without an
advocate in the administration.
Fortunately, from January to
June 1974, Dr. Allan Seid was
appointed a counselor at Cowell
on a temporary substitution basis
and is directing much of his effort
to the needs of the Asian and
Asian-American students on
campus.
However, it remains that
before January and after June,
there was and is no administrative
spokesperson who can address
him/herself to the special
concerns and issues faced by the
Asian-American minority.

Christ As Light
Editor:
Bill Evers thinks that the
Biblical Jesus is morally
indefensible (Daily May 23). Jesus
Christ requires no defense: He did
not defend Himself at the trial
before Pontius Pilate and the mob
of accusers. Those who shouted,
"Crucify Him" also thought that
He was morally indefensible.
What the basic message of
Christ is about is that He came as
light into this world to show up
all human darkness and to save
each man and woman from the
consequences of darkness.
His challenge to Bill and me
and all others is to admit that
such darkness is in each of us and
to accept Him, the light. It does
not help us a bit by refraining to
look into our own darkness and
saying that light is darkness.
If anyone here on campus
wishes to inquire further into this
matter and to find out the
relationship between light and
life, I am sure that such
organizations as the Campus
Crusade and the Chinese Christian
Fellowship would be only too
willing to help at their meetings.

Bible Critically Examined
Editor:
As I read Bill Evers' recent
column (Daily, May 23) I couldn't
help but wonder where he found
his opinion that "a Christian who
knows the views of the Biblical
Jesus and yet accepts them on
faith as morally sound has refused
to use his critical judgment."
Evers claims that the

punishment of hell does not fit
the crime of sin. Sin is basically an
attitude, a rejection of God. Since
we all, every Christian included,
haved sinned (Romans 3:23), we
have no way to save ourselves.
In view of this and His great
love for us, Jesus came to earth to
die so that we might be saved. He
also had to rise from the dead to
show his power over death.
The resurrection, being the
event on which Christianity hangs
together or falls apart, must be
critically examined. Bible scholars
have determined that the written
accounts of six main witnesses —
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul
and Peter — were all written
within 10 to 20 years after the
resurrection.
This evidence disputes the
claim that these accounts were
written over a hundred years after
the resurrection, and were
therefore filled with myths and
legends, instead of hard facts.
