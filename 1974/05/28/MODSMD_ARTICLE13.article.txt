# On GOP Primary

On June 4 the voters of
California will nominate
candidates for the upcoming
general election. Only in the
primary will the voters be able tp
choose candidates from the broad
range of political beliefs within
each party.
The Stanford chapter of the
California Republican League
(CRL) is committed to the
concept of a progressive
Republican Party. We believe that
the Republican party will
continue to be a viable political
force only if it nominates
forward-looking, progressive
candidates.
To this end the Stanford
chapter of the California
Republican League along with the
State CRL and other local
chapters endorse the following
candidates for Republican
nomination:
PAUL N. McCLOSKEY, JR.
for Congress (12th dist.) —
Congressman McCloskey has
provided forceful leadership on
such important issues as
environmental protection,
reduced defense spending, and
impeachment. McCloskey also has
led bipartisan support for reform
of the seniority system in
Congress. Few men have the
courage to speak out on issues as
McCloskey has repeatedly done.
HOUSTON I. FLOURNOY for
governor — Houston Flournoy,
currently controller of the State
of California, is the only
candidate from either party with
experience in California's
executive and legislative branches
of government. With a Ph.D. from
Princeton in political science, and
experience as an associate
professor of government at
Pomona College, California state
assemblyman, and state
controller, Flournoy has shown
himself exceptionally capable of
handling the task that will face
California's next governor.
As state controller, Flournoy
cleaned up the abuses of the
Inheritance Tax Appraiser
System. Flournoy will fight to
make education the number one
priority for scarce tax dollars.
Flournoy will work for clean
statewide mass transit,
development of geothermal
energy sources, and a state land
use policy which will permanently
preserve land for open,
recreational and agricultural use.
JOHN G. VENEMAN for It.
governor — Jack Veneman has by
far the best credentials of any
candidate for It. governor. As
undersecretary of Health,
Education and Welfare under Bob
Finch and Elliot Richardson,
Veneman played a major role in
shaping legislation for welfare
reform, health care and special
revenue sharing.
Named "Most Outstanding
Assemblyman" in 1968 by the
California Capital Press Corps, he
fought for numerous social reform
measures. Along with Flournoy
and a group of assemblymen
known as the "Young Turks,"
Veneman helped bring the
assembly minority leadership
under the control of the
Republican progressives. Jack
Veneman is a graduate of
Stanford and a veteran of 26 years
of public service.
WILLIAM T. BAG LEY for
state controller — Another
"Young Turk" assemblyman, Bill
Bagley has been a key mediator in
the frequent battles between the
Reagan administration and the
Democratic legislature. As one of
the Assembly's leading tax
experts, Bagley nursed the
property tax relief measure into
law.
Bagley's bills have included
measures to protect individuals
from abuse of computerized
information. The Bagley Open
Meetings and Open Records Acts
have helped increase public access
to government proceedings.
Bagley's skill on the floor of the
Assembly helped to save open
housing in California after it was
threatened by the passage of
Proposition 14 in 1964.
Bagley, who graduated Phi
Beta Kappa, was valedictorian of
the Class of 1949 at U.C.
Berkeley.
BRIAN VAN CAMP for
secretary of state (former
California corporations
commissioner)
EARL BRIAN for U.S. Senator
(former California secretary for
Health and Welfare)
JOHN T. KEHOE for state
treasurer (former Dept. of
Consumer Affairs director)
TALLY P. MASTRANGELO
for State Board of Equalization*
(CRL founding member and
director)
