# Noted Congressmen Facing Tests On Primary Ballots Today
## 
### Associated Press 
Two men who were early and outspoken foes of
the Vietnam war are featured performers in today's
primaries. For Sen. J.W. Fulbright, it could mean
the end of a 30-year Senate career; for Wayne
Morse, it could mean a new political life.
Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, is seeking his sixth term
against the most formidable foe he has faced to
date — Gov. Dale Bumpers. Most polls show
Bumpers leading, although Fulbright claims he has
a poll that shows the race too close to call.
Morse, 73, is running in a four-way Democratic
senatorial primary in Oregon. If he wins, he will
face Republican Sen. Robert Pack wood, who
defeated him in 1968 and who is unopposed for the
Republican nomination. Voters will also choose
Democratic and Republican nominees in the race to
succeed retiring Gov. Tom McCall.
The third primary of the day is in Kentucky,
where Republican Sen. Marlow Cook, who won a
court fight to stay on the ballot after two
Democratic state officials disqualified him on a
technicality, is expected to win renomination. Gov.
Wendell Ford is the favorite to win the Democratic.

Arkansas also has a Democratic primary for
governor, a three-way race among former Gov.
Orval Faubus, former Rep. David H. Pryor, and Lt.
Gov. Bob Riley.
Most of the attention is focused on the race
between Bumpers and Fulbright, who has become a
Washington institution by challenging the foreign
policies of a succession of presidents.
Bumpers, 48, was elected governor in 1970 by
defeating Faubus in the primary and the late Gov.
Winthrop Rockefeller in the general election, and
was re-elected easily in 1972.
Fulbright, 69, has cited his 30 years of national
and international experience in a campaign where
the candidates differ little-on issues. He also claims
he has used his seniority to aid Arkansas and says
Bumpers would be at a disadvantage because he?
would enter the Senate at the bottom of th('
seniority scale.
In Oregon, Morse, who has emphasized
environmental issues, faces state Senate President
Jason Boe and two political unknowns. In the
governor's race, there are three major Democratic
candidates, two major Republicans and a flock of
unknowns seeking to replace McCall, a Republican.
