# Students Display Ingenuity Filling Weekend Time
## 
### ANN HOFFMAN 
It was a clear and starlit night.
In Toyon Hall Heinz Kimmich
and His Swiss Boys struck up a
polka. The desk clerk at Meyer
Library yawned. On another side
of the campus the young stripper
at the Alpha Delt Casino party
began her second show. The desk
clexk at Meyer Library yawned.
As Charles Schultz' Snoopy
would tell us now, the "next"
chapter will tie those seemingly
unpqpnected episodes together.
As with Snoopy's novel, any
attempt to define the "Great
Stanford Weekend" may never
materialize, for an obvious lack of
continuity.
However, investigation has
revealed that weekends here do
exist in most cases and that they
are not an anachronism left over
from high school or last summer.
Furthermore, there is an ironic
general concensus even among
avid polka dancers, Friday night
studiers and fraternity rushees
that the best kind of weekend is
on? spent as far away from
campus as possible. In line with
thijs trend, the next best
alternative to complete escape, as
th<i* ever-present rash of theme
parties would seem to indicate, is
to create an atmosphere
distinctively uncollegiate. Thus
the success of both the polka
party and the fraternity casino
party.
Asking people for an example
of a good weekend induces similar
responses — a long drive to
Carmel, a camping trip to the
Sierras, a bicycle ride to Monterey
— such answers usually being
accompanied by a longing sigh. As
junior Gary Wolens succinctly put
it, an "exciting weekend" is
simply "going somewhere away
besides here."
California Sights
Toyon Senior House Associate
Andy Siegel offered his
explanation for the popularity of
camping and weekend trips. "A
lot of people from out of state
want to see the sights of
California, and California people
just have it in their blood," he
said.
While most students
interviewed extolled the virtues of
a weekend spent away from
campus, the mention of that
mundane representation of an

on-campus weekend — the
Stanford party — barely elicited
response. Is there a typical
Stanford party?
Yes, there is most said, but
couldn't quite agree on its most
outstanding characteristics.
"Stanford parties are all alike,"
said Junior Ken Coleman,
"medicore band and warm beer."
Junior Alan Ibara saw them in a
different light, "Cold beer and
warm cokes."
The typical campus party is
probably not as common as it is
dreaded and planners of most
dorm and house parties
self-consciously attempt to avoid
that particular image of hedonism,
warm or cold. Cal Dalton, one of
the co-planners of the El Toro
polka party last month, felt that
bringing in Heinz Kimmich and
His Swiss Boys from Zinzinnati
Oom Pah Pah to play at Toyon
Lounge would provide a welcome
change from the "run-of-the-mill
parties."
Dalton had been afraid that the
party might suffer from a lack of
female partners and general
inhibitions on the part of those
unacquainted with the polka. But
the women came and the
beginners learned quickly.
Several collisions and three-couple
pileups throughout the evening
affirmed the overall success of the
dance.
Successful Party
No one was more surprised at
the party's success than Kimmich
himself. Though he was "scared"
at first to play at a college party,
Kimmich said he thought people
"really enjoyed it." He stated that
right now younger people are
getting interested [in his music].
For the last three or four years
they just weren't interested in this
kind of music."
The more plush April weekend
alternative to the dreaded typical
party was undoubtedly to be
found at the second annual Alpha
Delt Casino party, the climax to
this year's rush. One frat member
estimated that additional touch of
class cost at least $1200 in rented
equipment, hard liquor and
entertainment. Kerbavaz denied
suggestions that the party was too
extravagant, saying that the
fraternity could afford such things
because it didn't have to pay
University expenses, such as maid

service.
For the less glamorous at heart,
the Stanford weekend offers still
another social alternative,
underplayed but somehow always
in style. According to Guy Deßall,
Head of Circulation and Reserve
Services at Meyer Library,
"UGLY is where the action is on
Friday and Saturday nights," in
comparison to the other libraries
on campus, that is. On a given
weekend there are usually at least
90 people in Meyer at one time,
with the number rising to
approximately 375 on Saturday
and Sunday afternoons, according
to John Heyek, library finance
and planning officer. Sunday
nights, however, are "very busy,"
he said, as an average of 390
people attempt, no doubt, to
make amends for the previous two
nights.
Meyer is thus the domain of a
sizable weekend elite and any
notions that the lights emanating
from the library windows are
somehow dimmer on Friday and
Saturday nights, are surely the
imaginings of a guilty conscience.
For the highly motivated student
Friday is obviously just another
day. The fourth week into the
quarter Ken Coleman justified
his presence in the library on a
Friday night. "This is the first

time I've studied on Friday
night," he said dutifully, "but I'm
leaving in half an hour."
Sunday Flicks
Though making no claims to be
the high point of any weekend,
the Sunday Flicks are an
institution that fulfills a vital last
fling need and prevents
post-weekend depression from
dissolving into any kind of
constructive action.
Approximately 2640 students
attend the Flicks on a Sunday
night, according to Sunday Flicks
Manager Bob Sisson.
The Sunday Flicks have been
capping off weekends almost
continuously since 1937, when
they showed in the History
Corner of the Quad for 10 cents.
Part of the institution's success is
apparently attributable simply to
its end-of-the-weekend time slot.
Students go off campus on Friday
and Saturday nights, and study on
Sunday, said Sisson. By Sunday
evening "they're ready for a
break."
Social Evolution
The Sunday Flicks have proven
to be a weekend constant, which
gives rise to the question whether
weekends show indications of any
social evolution.
On Monday, May 3, 1954 the
front page of the Daily displayed

a picture of the "Battle of Lake
Lagunita" in the "Annual Junior
Water Carnival." The picture
showed various boats of
destruction, disguised as rafts,
which from a historical
perspective, could be seen as a
more violent version of the recent
Aqua Follies.
Ten years later in May, 1964,
plans were underway for the
Senior Ball, featuring Freddy
Martin in the Grand Ballroom of
the Sheraton Palace, with the
grand door prize being two
round-trip tickets to Hawaii.
The nature of weekends seems

to undergo a considerable change
in the late 19605.
On the weekend of April 12,
1969 a sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Lab was going into its
fifth and sixth days, as students
protested against certain types of
Stanford research. It is doubtful
whether the Senior Ball or a cool
dip in Lake Lag were the main
weekend concerns.
But according to Toyon's
resident fellow, who has been a
fellow for seven years, there is a
"myth" about what kinds of
things students actually did during
the late '60s. He maintained that
they did basically just what they

do now, that is, leave campus for
the weekend to go hiking and
camping.

revealed that weekends here do
exist in most cases and that they
are not an anachronism left over
from high school or last summer.
Furthermore, there is an ironic
general concensus even among
avid polka dancers, Friday night
studiers and fraternity rushees
that the best kind of weekend is
on? spent as far away from
campus as possible. In line with
thijs trend, the next best
alternative to complete escape, as
th<i* ever-present rash of theme
parties would seem to indicate, is
to create an atmosphere
distinctively uncollegiate. Thus
the success of both the polka
party and the fraternity casino
party.
Asking people for an example
of a good weekend induces similar
responses — a long drive to
Carmel, a camping trip to the
Sierras, a bicycle ride to Monterey
— such answers usually being
accompanied by a longing sigh. As
junior Gary Wolens succinctly put
it, an "exciting weekend" is
simply "going somewhere away
besides here."
California Sights
Toyon Senior House Associate
Andy Siegel offered his
explanation for the popularity of
camping and weekend trips. "A
lot of people from out of state
want to see the sights of
California, and California people
just have it in their blood," he
said.
While most students
interviewed extolled the virtues of
a weekend spent away from
campus, the mention of that
mundane representation of an

on-campus weekend — the
Stanford party — barely elicited
response. Is there a typical
Stanford party?
Yes, there is most said, but
couldn't quite agree on its most
outstanding characteristics.
"Stanford parties are all alike,"
said Junior Ken Coleman,
"medicore band and warm beer."
Junior Alan Ibara saw them in a
different light, "Cold beer and
warm cokes."
The typical campus party is
probably not as common as it is
dreaded and planners of most
dorm and house parties
self-consciously attempt to avoid
that particular image of hedonism,
warm or cold. Cal Dalton, one of
the co-planners of the El Toro
polka party last month, felt that
bringing in Heinz Kimmich and
His Swiss Boys from Zinzinnati
Oom Pah Pah to play at Toyon
Lounge would provide a welcome
change from the "run-of-the-mill
parties."
Dalton had been afraid that the
party might suffer from a lack of
female partners and general
inhibitions on the part of those
unacquainted with the polka. But
the women came and the
beginners learned quickly.
Several collisions and three-couple
pileups throughout the evening
affirmed the overall success of the
dance.
Successful Party
No one was more surprised at
the party's success than Kimmich
himself. Though he was "scared"
at first to play at a college party,
Kimmich said he thought people
"really enjoyed it." He stated that
right now younger people are
getting interested [in his music].
For the last three or four years
they just weren't interested in this
kind of music."
The more plush April weekend
alternative to the dreaded typical
party was undoubtedly to be
found at the second annual Alpha
Delt Casino party, the climax to
this year's rush. One frat member
estimated that additional touch of
class cost at least $1200 in rented
equipment, hard liquor and
entertainment. Kerbavaz denied
suggestions that the party was too
extravagant, saying that the
fraternity could afford such things
because it didn't have to pay
University expenses, such as maid

service.
For the less glamorous at heart,
the Stanford weekend offers still
another social alternative,
underplayed but somehow always
in style. According to Guy Deßall,
Head of Circulation and Reserve
Services at Meyer Library,
"UGLY is where the action is on
Friday and Saturday nights," in
comparison to the other libraries
on campus, that is. On a given
weekend there are usually at least
90 people in Meyer at one time,
with the number rising to
approximately 375 on Saturday
and Sunday afternoons, according
to John Heyek, library finance
and planning officer. Sunday
nights, however, are "very busy,"
he said, as an average of 390
people attempt, no doubt, to
make amends for the previous two
nights.
Meyer is thus the domain of a
sizable weekend elite and any
notions that the lights emanating
from the library windows are
somehow dimmer on Friday and
Saturday nights, are surely the
imaginings of a guilty conscience.
For the highly motivated student
Friday is obviously just another
day. The fourth week into the
quarter Ken Coleman justified
his presence in the library on a
Friday night. "This is the first

time I've studied on Friday
night," he said dutifully, "but I'm
leaving in half an hour."
Sunday Flicks
Though making no claims to be
the high point of any weekend,
the Sunday Flicks are an
institution that fulfills a vital last
fling need and prevents
post-weekend depression from
dissolving into any kind of
constructive action.
Approximately 2640 students
attend the Flicks on a Sunday
night, according to Sunday Flicks
Manager Bob Sisson.
The Sunday Flicks have been
capping off weekends almost
continuously since 1937, when
they showed in the History
Corner of the Quad for 10 cents.
Part of the institution's success is
apparently attributable simply to
its end-of-the-weekend time slot.
Students go off campus on Friday
and Saturday nights, and study on
Sunday, said Sisson. By Sunday
evening "they're ready for a
break."
Social Evolution
The Sunday Flicks have proven
to be a weekend constant, which
gives rise to the question whether
weekends show indications of any
social evolution.
On Monday, May 3, 1954 the
front page of the Daily displayed

a picture of the "Battle of Lake
Lagunita" in the "Annual Junior
Water Carnival." The picture
showed various boats of
destruction, disguised as rafts,
which from a historical
perspective, could be seen as a
more violent version of the recent
Aqua Follies.
Ten years later in May, 1964,
plans were underway for the
Senior Ball, featuring Freddy
Martin in the Grand Ballroom of
the Sheraton Palace, with the
grand door prize being two
round-trip tickets to Hawaii.
The nature of weekends seems

to undergo a considerable change
in the late 19605.
On the weekend of April 12,
1969 a sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Lab was going into its
fifth and sixth days, as students
protested against certain types of
Stanford research. It is doubtful
whether the Senior Ball or a cool
dip in Lake Lag were the main
weekend concerns.
But according to Toyon's
resident fellow, who has been a
fellow for seven years, there is a
"myth" about what kinds of
things students actually did during
the late '60s. He maintained that
they did basically just what they

do now, that is, leave campus for
the weekend to go hiking and
camping.
It was a clear and starlit night.
In Toyon Hall Heinz Kimmich
and His Swiss Boys struck up a
polka. The desk clerk at Meyer
Library yawned. On another side
of the campus the young stripper
at the Alpha Delt Casino party
began her second show. The desk
clexk at Meyer Library yawned.
As Charles Schultz' Snoopy
would tell us now, the "next"
chapter will tie those seemingly
unpqpnected episodes together.
As with Snoopy's novel, any
attempt to define the "Great
Stanford Weekend" may never
materialize, for an obvious lack of
continuity.
However, investigation has
revealed that weekends here do
exist in most cases and that they
are not an anachronism left over

responses — a long drive to
Carmel, a camping trip to the
Sierras, a bicycle ride to Monterey
— such answers usually being
accompanied by a longing sigh. As
junior Gary Wolens succinctly put
it, an "exciting weekend" is
simply "going somewhere away
besides here."
California Sights
Toyon Senior House Associate
Andy Siegel offered his
explanation for the popularity of
camping and weekend trips. "A
lot of people from out of state
want to see the sights of
California, and California people
just have it in their blood," he
said.
While most students
interviewed extolled the virtues of
a weekend spent away from
campus, the mention of that
mundane representation of an

on-campus weekend — the
Stanford party — barely elicited
response. Is there a typical
Stanford party?
Yes, there is most said, but
couldn't quite agree on its most
outstanding characteristics.
"Stanford parties are all alike,"
said Junior Ken Coleman,
"medicore band and warm beer."
Junior Alan Ibara saw them in a
different light, "Cold beer and
warm cokes."
The typical campus party is
probably not as common as it is
dreaded and planners of most
dorm and house parties
self-consciously attempt to avoid
that particular image of hedonism,
warm or cold. Cal Dalton, one of
the co-planners of the El Toro
polka party last month, felt that
bringing in Heinz Kimmich and
His Swiss Boys from Zinzinnati
Oom Pah Pah to play at Toyon
Lounge would provide a welcome
change from the "run-of-the-mill
parties."
Dalton had been afraid that the
party might suffer from a lack of
female partners and general
inhibitions on the part of those
unacquainted with the polka. But
the women came and the
beginners learned quickly.
Several collisions and three-couple
pileups throughout the evening
affirmed the overall success of the
dance.
Successful Party
No one was more surprised at
the party's success than Kimmich
himself. Though he was "scared"
at first to play at a college party,
Kimmich said he thought people
"really enjoyed it." He stated that
right now younger people are
getting interested [in his music].
For the last three or four years
they just weren't interested in this
kind of music."
The more plush April weekend
alternative to the dreaded typical
party was undoubtedly to be
found at the second annual Alpha
Delt Casino party, the climax to
this year's rush. One frat member
estimated that additional touch of
class cost at least $1200 in rented
equipment, hard liquor and
entertainment. Kerbavaz denied
suggestions that the party was too
extravagant, saying that the
fraternity could afford such things
because it didn't have to pay
University expenses, such as maid

service.
For the less glamorous at heart,
the Stanford weekend offers still
another social alternative,
underplayed but somehow always
in style. According to Guy Deßall,
Head of Circulation and Reserve
Services at Meyer Library,
"UGLY is where the action is on
Friday and Saturday nights," in
comparison to the other libraries
on campus, that is. On a given
weekend there are usually at least
90 people in Meyer at one time,
with the number rising to
approximately 375 on Saturday
and Sunday afternoons, according
to John Heyek, library finance
and planning officer. Sunday
nights, however, are "very busy,"
he said, as an average of 390
people attempt, no doubt, to
make amends for the previous two
nights.
Meyer is thus the domain of a
sizable weekend elite and any
notions that the lights emanating
from the library windows are
somehow dimmer on Friday and
Saturday nights, are surely the
imaginings of a guilty conscience.
For the highly motivated student
Friday is obviously just another
day. The fourth week into the
quarter Ken Coleman justified
his presence in the library on a
Friday night. "This is the first

time I've studied on Friday
night," he said dutifully, "but I'm
leaving in half an hour."
Sunday Flicks
Though making no claims to be
the high point of any weekend,
the Sunday Flicks are an
institution that fulfills a vital last
fling need and prevents
post-weekend depression from
dissolving into any kind of
constructive action.
Approximately 2640 students
attend the Flicks on a Sunday
night, according to Sunday Flicks
Manager Bob Sisson.
The Sunday Flicks have been
capping off weekends almost
continuously since 1937, when
they showed in the History
Corner of the Quad for 10 cents.
Part of the institution's success is
apparently attributable simply to
its end-of-the-weekend time slot.
Students go off campus on Friday
and Saturday nights, and study on
Sunday, said Sisson. By Sunday
evening "they're ready for a
break."
Social Evolution
The Sunday Flicks have proven
to be a weekend constant, which
gives rise to the question whether
weekends show indications of any
social evolution.
On Monday, May 3, 1954 the
front page of the Daily displayed

a picture of the "Battle of Lake
Lagunita" in the "Annual Junior
Water Carnival." The picture
showed various boats of
destruction, disguised as rafts,
which from a historical
perspective, could be seen as a
more violent version of the recent
Aqua Follies.
Ten years later in May, 1964,
plans were underway for the
Senior Ball, featuring Freddy
Martin in the Grand Ballroom of
the Sheraton Palace, with the
grand door prize being two
round-trip tickets to Hawaii.
The nature of weekends seems

to undergo a considerable change
in the late 19605.
On the weekend of April 12,
1969 a sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Lab was going into its
fifth and sixth days, as students
protested against certain types of
Stanford research. It is doubtful
whether the Senior Ball or a cool
dip in Lake Lag were the main
weekend concerns.
But according to Toyon's
resident fellow, who has been a
fellow for seven years, there is a
"myth" about what kinds of
things students actually did during
the late '60s. He maintained that
they did basically just what they

do now, that is, leave campus for
the weekend to go hiking and
camping.
It was a clear and starlit night.
In Toyon Hall Heinz Kimmich
and His Swiss Boys struck up a
polka. The desk clerk at Meyer
Library yawned. On another side
of the campus the young stripper
at the Alpha Delt Casino party
began her second show. The desk
clexk at Meyer Library yawned.
As Charles Schultz' Snoopy
would tell us now, the "next"
chapter will tie those seemingly
unpqpnected episodes together.
As with Snoopy's novel, any
attempt to define the "Great
Stanford Weekend" may never
materialize, for an obvious lack of
continuity.
However, investigation has
revealed that weekends here do
exist in most cases and that they
are not an anachronism left over
from high school or last summer.
Furthermore, there is an ironic
general concensus even among
avid polka dancers, Friday night
studiers and fraternity rushees
that the best kind of weekend is
on? spent as far away from
campus as possible. In line with
thijs trend, the next best
alternative to complete escape, as
th<i* ever-present rash of theme
parties would seem to indicate, is
to create an atmosphere
distinctively uncollegiate. Thus
the success of both the polka
party and the fraternity casino
party.

mundane representation of an

on-campus weekend — the
Stanford party — barely elicited
response. Is there a typical
Stanford party?
Yes, there is most said, but
couldn't quite agree on its most
outstanding characteristics.
"Stanford parties are all alike,"
said Junior Ken Coleman,
"medicore band and warm beer."
Junior Alan Ibara saw them in a
different light, "Cold beer and
warm cokes."
The typical campus party is
probably not as common as it is
dreaded and planners of most
dorm and house parties
self-consciously attempt to avoid
that particular image of hedonism,
warm or cold. Cal Dalton, one of
the co-planners of the El Toro
polka party last month, felt that
bringing in Heinz Kimmich and
His Swiss Boys from Zinzinnati
Oom Pah Pah to play at Toyon
Lounge would provide a welcome
change from the "run-of-the-mill
parties."
Dalton had been afraid that the
party might suffer from a lack of
female partners and general
inhibitions on the part of those
unacquainted with the polka. But
the women came and the
beginners learned quickly.
Several collisions and three-couple
pileups throughout the evening
affirmed the overall success of the
dance.
Successful Party
No one was more surprised at
the party's success than Kimmich
himself. Though he was "scared"
at first to play at a college party,
Kimmich said he thought people
"really enjoyed it." He stated that
right now younger people are
getting interested [in his music].
For the last three or four years
they just weren't interested in this
kind of music."
The more plush April weekend
alternative to the dreaded typical
party was undoubtedly to be
found at the second annual Alpha
Delt Casino party, the climax to
this year's rush. One frat member
estimated that additional touch of
class cost at least $1200 in rented
equipment, hard liquor and
entertainment. Kerbavaz denied
suggestions that the party was too
extravagant, saying that the
fraternity could afford such things
because it didn't have to pay
University expenses, such as maid

service.
For the less glamorous at heart,
the Stanford weekend offers still
another social alternative,
underplayed but somehow always
in style. According to Guy Deßall,
Head of Circulation and Reserve
Services at Meyer Library,
"UGLY is where the action is on
Friday and Saturday nights," in
comparison to the other libraries
on campus, that is. On a given
weekend there are usually at least
90 people in Meyer at one time,
with the number rising to
approximately 375 on Saturday
and Sunday afternoons, according
to John Heyek, library finance
and planning officer. Sunday
nights, however, are "very busy,"
he said, as an average of 390
people attempt, no doubt, to
make amends for the previous two
nights.
Meyer is thus the domain of a
sizable weekend elite and any
notions that the lights emanating
from the library windows are
somehow dimmer on Friday and
Saturday nights, are surely the
imaginings of a guilty conscience.
For the highly motivated student
Friday is obviously just another
day. The fourth week into the
quarter Ken Coleman justified
his presence in the library on a
Friday night. "This is the first

time I've studied on Friday
night," he said dutifully, "but I'm
leaving in half an hour."
Sunday Flicks
Though making no claims to be
the high point of any weekend,
the Sunday Flicks are an
institution that fulfills a vital last
fling need and prevents
post-weekend depression from
dissolving into any kind of
constructive action.
Approximately 2640 students
attend the Flicks on a Sunday
night, according to Sunday Flicks
Manager Bob Sisson.
The Sunday Flicks have been
capping off weekends almost
continuously since 1937, when
they showed in the History
Corner of the Quad for 10 cents.
Part of the institution's success is
apparently attributable simply to
its end-of-the-weekend time slot.
Students go off campus on Friday
and Saturday nights, and study on
Sunday, said Sisson. By Sunday
evening "they're ready for a
break."
Social Evolution
The Sunday Flicks have proven
to be a weekend constant, which
gives rise to the question whether
weekends show indications of any
social evolution.
On Monday, May 3, 1954 the
front page of the Daily displayed

a picture of the "Battle of Lake
Lagunita" in the "Annual Junior
Water Carnival." The picture
showed various boats of
destruction, disguised as rafts,
which from a historical
perspective, could be seen as a
more violent version of the recent
Aqua Follies.
Ten years later in May, 1964,
plans were underway for the
Senior Ball, featuring Freddy
Martin in the Grand Ballroom of
the Sheraton Palace, with the
grand door prize being two
round-trip tickets to Hawaii.
The nature of weekends seems

to undergo a considerable change
in the late 19605.
On the weekend of April 12,
1969 a sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Lab was going into its
fifth and sixth days, as students
protested against certain types of
Stanford research. It is doubtful
whether the Senior Ball or a cool
dip in Lake Lag were the main
weekend concerns.
But according to Toyon's
resident fellow, who has been a
fellow for seven years, there is a
"myth" about what kinds of
things students actually did during
the late '60s. He maintained that
they did basically just what they

do now, that is, leave campus for
the weekend to go hiking and
camping.
It was a clear and starlit night.
In Toyon Hall Heinz Kimmich
and His Swiss Boys struck up a
polka. The desk clerk at Meyer
Library yawned. On another side
of the campus the young stripper
at the Alpha Delt Casino party
began her second show. The desk
clexk at Meyer Library yawned.
As Charles Schultz' Snoopy
would tell us now, the "next"
chapter will tie those seemingly
unpqpnected episodes together.
As with Snoopy's novel, any
attempt to define the "Great
Stanford Weekend" may never
materialize, for an obvious lack of
continuity.
However, investigation has
revealed that weekends here do
exist in most cases and that they
are not an anachronism left over
from high school or last summer.
Furthermore, there is an ironic
general concensus even among
avid polka dancers, Friday night
studiers and fraternity rushees
that the best kind of weekend is
on? spent as far away from
campus as possible. In line with
thijs trend, the next best
alternative to complete escape, as
th<i* ever-present rash of theme
parties would seem to indicate, is
to create an atmosphere
distinctively uncollegiate. Thus
the success of both the polka
party and the fraternity casino
party.
Asking people for an example
of a good weekend induces similar
responses — a long drive to
Carmel, a camping trip to the
Sierras, a bicycle ride to Monterey
— such answers usually being
accompanied by a longing sigh. As
junior Gary Wolens succinctly put
it, an "exciting weekend" is
simply "going somewhere away
besides here."
California Sights
Toyon Senior House Associate
Andy Siegel offered his
explanation for the popularity of
camping and weekend trips. "A
lot of people from out of state
want to see the sights of
California, and California people
just have it in their blood," he
said.

interviewed extolled the virtues of
a weekend spent away from
campus, the mention of that
mundane representation of an

on-campus weekend — the
Stanford party — barely elicited
