# Maynard Ferguson: Flashy Brass
## 
### BOB HENRY 
SAN FRANCISCO â€” Last Wednesday night Maynard
Ferguson and his band concluded a two night stay at The
Great American Music Hall.
Ferguson solidifies the trumpeter stereotype already
firmly established by "El Gato" Cat Anderson, Doc
Severensen, and Dizzy Gillespie by giving an extremely
showy, flamboyant, and cocky performance.
Ferguson stands in front of his twelve piece band (bass,
drums, piano, two bones, three saxes, and four trumpets),
and at times leads them, at times steps back and watches
them solo, and at least once a song, puts his horn to the
microphone and demonstrates his ability.
After finishing a solo, Ferguson will throw his fist in
the air, let out a shriek, and sway his head around. The
noisy SRO crowd at the Music Hall reacted by standing
and applauding, whistling, and generally whooping support
for their hero.
Their vocal enthusiasm is all fine and nice, but in too
many instances Ferguson and his band do not warrant it.
The band attempts to blend a rocking, jazzy, brassy big
band sound with stimulating solos. To do this, their
articulation must be perfect. It is easy enough to solo in a
quartet; there are no opposing forces. But with a backdrop
of seven or eight wailing musicians, it can be difficult.
In a few instances, especially on their rendition of
"Living For The City" and "Mac Arthur Park," they
achieved the desired sound and it was very impressive.
These numbers succeeded because in the ensemble sections
the band was very tight, and for the soloists they lowered
their volume and still maintained their supportive together
sound, letting the soloist dominate.
On other numbers, especially "Gospel Spirit," a tune
which Ferguson termed "a jazz-rock-soul-blues-gospel

spiritual song," the rest of the band obstructed rather than
aided the soloist. "Gospel Spirit" featured bari sax man
Bruce "Batman" Johnston alone for the better part of the
song, and he performed a very original and inspired solo.
Ferguson then had the rhythm section accompany
"Batman," which improved things nicely. For the
supposed climax of the song, the horn section strode to
the front of the stage, surrounded Bruce Wayne, and blew
"together" into the audience. Orgasm never arrived.
This instance was alarming enough itself, but
unfortunately, it was not alone. On their first number of
the night, as an example, Ferguson's
ex-pianist-arranger-composer Pete Jackson's tune "Left
Back," they gave an ominous warning. Brian Smith's
soprano solo, if it ever had a chance, was ruined by the
band.
The amazing thing about Maynard Ferguson and his
band is that despite these faults, they still manage to put
on a good show. Some of their tunes, especially "Living
For The City," "Mac Arthur Park," Herbie Hancock's
sensuous rocker "Chamelion," and their tune from the
M.F. Horn 4+5 album, "Fox Hunt," were outstanding
displays of musicianship. At times the entire horn section
sounded like one axe, the mark of an excellent band.
Ferguson also gets the audience on his side because he
can combine great professionalism acquired by over
twenty years of trumpet playing with a powerful, yet very
friendly stage presence.
He constantly jokes with his band and the audience,
and at one point said that "Bruce Summers is featured on
this next tune ("Fox Hunt"). Oh, I think his parents are in
the audience. Yes, there they are. Mr. and Mrs. Summers,
really, ho doesn't do the things he used to any more. He's
straightened out and become a real good kid."

The finest solo of the night was given by bassist Rick
Petrone on their playing of Chick Corea's "La Fiesta."
Petrone began the piece alone and played his bass fiddle as
few can. He began with a rather slow, melodious riff,
progressed to pleasing double stop chords, and then to
actually strumming all four strings of the over-grown cello
at once.
All this was done with a Spanish flavor, making Petrone
a "flamenco" bassist. He also plucked the strings with his
left hand for a while, and then reverted to more standard
technique. He gave a dazzling display of phenomenal
fingering and plucking; rapidly, precisely, and musically
running the gamut of the bass. It was a solo difficult to
match.
Ferguson ended the lengthy three-set show with his
famous version of "Hey Jude." It merely condensed the
entire evening into one song. Parts of it were outstanding,
all of it gaudy to the hilt, and in some parts the solos were
sabotaged by the band. Maynard termed it "pure
insanity."
As the horn players walked to various positions in the
audience and played their high Es and Gs, the lights
flashed, and The Great American rocked, one understood
his meaning.
Maynard Ferguson and his band work hard and yet
greatly enjoy themselves. Some of their music is superb,
some shaky. Leaving the nightclub one sensed that on the
whole they weren't quite as spectacular as their histrionics
implied.
In the near future the Great American Music Hail will
present Taj Mahal. Big band buffs should note that Count
Basie will bring his orchestra to the hall in late June. The
club is at 859 O'Farrell, near Polk. Most starting times are
Nine PM.
