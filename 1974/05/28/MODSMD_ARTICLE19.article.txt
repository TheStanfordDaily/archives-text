## Black Performing Arts Presents Rock Course 
### 
The Committee on Black Performing Arts will present a non-credit
course entitled "Social History of Youth Culture Through Music,"

Isralow has taught and lectured on racism, sexism, alienation and
drugs and their interrelation with rock music at Arizona State
University, University of Wisconsin, University of Massachusetts, State
University of New York, and San Francisco State.
Isralow not only believes that rock music is affected by political
and social events, but also believes that rock music may have
influences on socio-political culture.
While exploring the music of the 50s, 60s, and 70s, Isralow
illustrates his lectures by playing the guitar, selecting oldies from a
stack of 455, or becoming "Eric the I," a greaser disc jockey.
The course will be given Mondays and Wednesdays at Harmony
