# Nixon Emphasizes Military Strength

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon, back from a four-day holiday
weekend in Florida, scheduled a
Cabinet meeting for this morning and
plans to call a bipartisan leadership
session when Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger returns from the Middle East
today.
Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
said there is "an open agenda" for the
Cabinet, but that legislation, the
economy and other matters will be
discussed.
Nixon is sending a report to
Congress today from his Council of
Economic Advisers on developments
and policies in the Mideast.
Z'yrgler declined to say exactly
wher K'ssinger will return.
4 L reporters on the
presidential plane flying back from
Florida, Ziegler said the President has
not ended his campaign to take his
Watergate case to the people. But
Nixon's only announced appearance in
the near future is a June 5
commencement speech at Anapolis,
Md.
Relations With Ford
Ziegler put down growing reports
of differences between Nixon and Vice
President Gerald R. Ford, particularly
on the turnover of Watergate tapes.
He said present relations between
the President and Ford were "very
good." He said "The vice president has
no difficulties with the President at

all" and that Nixon does not object to
Ford's public speaking because the
vice president "has been so supportive
of the President."
Newsweek magazine, however, said
there have been indications that Ford
is falling out of favor with Nixon. It
said in the current issue that Nixon
told former New York Gov. Nelson A.
Rockefeller at a recent White House
meeting: "Can you see Gerald Ford
sitting in this chair?"
No Action
Informed of the Newsweek article,
Ford instructed an aide to obtain the
comments of the President the night
he nominated Ford as vice president.
Ford's office has so far taken no
action with that materia', however.
Ford had been scheduled to leave
Washington early today, but delayed
his departure several hours saying he
was remaining in town for the Cabinet
meeting.
Earlier in the day Nixon had urged
members of Congress to be "patriots
first and partisans second." He
appealed in a Memorial Day speech for
approval of his $85.8-billion defense
budget as vital for world peace.
".. . Our hopes for a lasting peace
are brighter than at any time in living
memory because we now have a
structure of peace and we are working
carefully to strengthen it," Nixon said
in the nationwide radio address
yesterday.
'Means Military Strength'
But he added: ". .. No matter how
talented our diplomats are, the policies
they pursue must be backed by
credible strength ... and, in the last
analysis, this means military strength."
The 13-minute speech was his
second radio address in three days.
During his second successive
weekend in Florida, Nixon made no
public appearances.
In his radio speech from the study
of his bayside home, Nixon said, "We
may seek to ignore the world, but the
world will not ignore us."
"And, in a day when atomic
weapons are spreading, when famine
stalks large parts of the earth, and
when the tinder that could ignite
another conflagration exists in many
parts of the world, to turn our back on
our responsibilities for world
leadership would ... be disastrous not
only for us ... but also for all people
in the world who seek peace."
