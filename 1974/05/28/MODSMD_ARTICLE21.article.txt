# Saviano-Mitchell Win M.V. Doubles
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Normally, Stanford players
decimate any tournament, no
. natter how prestigious, they
deign to enter on the Peninsula.
It didn't quite happen that way
at the Mountain View Open,
which concluded at Cuesta Park
yesterday. In fact, the only title
that went back to the campus was
the men's doubles, where Nick
.Saviano-Mark Mitchell beat a
couple of old-timers you might
remember named Sandy Mayer
and Paul Sidone, 6-4, 7-5 in the
finals.
Otherwise, it was bleak. For
example, Chico Hagey and
Saviano, two players who can beat
just about anyone in California,
lost to a San Francisco junior high
school teacher, Bob Siska.
Siska, the City's open singles
champion but not considered in
the class of his younger foes, beat
Hagey 6-4, 6-4 in the semis and
Saviano 0-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the finals.
•I/i the women's singles
competition, things were just as
bleak, as top-seeded Stanford

freshman Marcy O'Keefe lost to a
peanut in the semis.
Thirteen-year-old Mareen
"Peanut" Louie of San Francisco,
that is.
Louie used a brilliant
two-handed backhand to beat
O'Keefe 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, but was
herself beaten by Susan
Mehmedbasich 6-1, 6-3 in the
finals.

Tennis Talk: Men's coach Dick
Gould thinks he's got a lineup
that can win the NCAA's next
month at Los Angeles. Gould
believes Pat DuPre's injured wrist
will have healed, and thus will
enter the rangy sophomore along
with John Whitlinger, Jim
Delaney and Hagey.
This means Gould can play
Whitlinger-DuPre, which should
be among the top seeds, at one
doubles spot. At the other
position, Hagey-Delaney, who
were the 16th ranked doubles
team in the nation two years ago
but haven't played together since,
will be entered.
