# Murray, Goethals Vie For NCAA Golf Spot
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
For 10 members of Stanford's
varsity and JV golf teams,
Saturday's match at San Francisco
Golf Club was just a leisurely
stroll along one of the nation's
most captivating courses.
But for Glenn Goethals and
Brent Murray, the match was
considerably more significant.
Goethals and Murray, both
freshmen on the 10th ranked Card
varsity, spent Saturday afternoon
battling for a berth in the NCAA
championships June 19-22 at San
Diego.
"I wish I could take them
both," said coach Bud Finger,
upset by the fact that each team is
allowed only five entrants in the
nationals after competing with six
men all season. "They don't make
you cut your team in baseball or
basketball," Finger argued. "Why
should golf be any different?"
Since golf apparently is
different — at least by NCAA
standards — Finger was forced to
choose between five of his six
starters. He decided that juniors

Dave Baskins, Aly Trompas,
George Pettinger and Conrad
Nilmeier would definitely play in
the NCAA's, with Goethals and
Murray vying for the final spot in
a 36-hole playoff — 18 holes
Saturday at San Francisco Club
and 18 today at either Cypress
Point or Pebble Beach.
Goethals, who shot 76
Saturday while Murray carded a
78, holds a two-stroke edge going
into today's final round. So while
the Cardinals are ostensibly
competing against the Pebble
Beach All-Stars this afternoon, the
two freshmen will certainly be
more concerned with each others'
score than their opponents.
Not that they need to worry
about losing. The Cards, now 7-1
for the season, probably won't
have any more trouble against the
Pebble Beach All-Stars than they
did Saturday against a similar
middle-aged group representing
the San Francisco Club.
Stanford triumphed IBV2-BV2 in
that match, despite the fact that
the Cardinal scores were far from
impressive. Goethals and Murray
each shot 76, while Nilmeier
carded a 77, Murray 68, Trompas
79 and Pettinger 80.
