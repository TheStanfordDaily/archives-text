# Pac-8 Sites Announced
## 
### 
The Pacific Eight conference
last week announced the sites for
its 1975 and 1976 championships.
The Pac-8 Council, which
consists of the league's Athletic
Directors and Faculty
Representatives, voted to abandon
the old conference championship
rotation system and instead
determine sites by calibre of
facilities and potential revenue
earned.
Thus, Stanford will host the
Pac-8 cross-country meet both of
;he next two years, presumably
because of the excellence of the
golf course site.
Stanford will also host the
1975 tennis meet, with UCLA
getting the nod in 1976.
In other sports, wrestling will
be held at Oregon State both
years; gymnastics, Cal (1975) and
Oregon (1976); swimming, USC
and Washington; track,
Washington State and California;
and golf, Oregon and USC.
In other news, the Council
approved petitions from 13
athletes for waiver of transfer rule
or waiver of a season of
competition because of injury or
illness.
The good news for Card fans is
that Chris Horpel and Ken Krebs,
stars of the wrestling team, will be
allowed to compete again.
The bad news is that USC
football kicker Chris Limahelu,
who beat the Cards with a
last-second field goal last season,
will also be around next year.
