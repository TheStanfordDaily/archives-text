# Tough Five-Game Match
## Dippers Edge Stanford 
### PETE BHATIA 
The Stanford volleyball team
came as close as one possibly can
Friday before falling to Wilt's Big
Dippers 12-15, 15-11, 12-15,
15-11, 13-15.
The exciting match, played
before about 2500 in Maples
Pavilion, was extremely even from
start to finish, with a good hit or a
mental mistake making the
difference.
Dippers Mike Norman and
Dodge Parker were impressive
throughout. Parker put up
repeated perfect sets from every
angle and the amazing Norman,
who just may jump as high as
David Thompson, pounded them
down.
The deciding game was
paradoxical for Stanford and very
typical of the evening. Bad passes,
missed hits and some good hits by
Wilt Chamberlain put the Cards
down quickly at 7-2.
Stanford's two points came on
a bad pass by Wilt and on a nice
hit by the Cards' Alan
Christiansen.
Card Comeback
As you might imagine,
Stanford came back. Player-Coach
Mike Allio started the regrouping
with a good hit off a one-handed
Tom Duralde set.
The Dippers rallied to lead

12-6 but Willie Mannon's hits and
Wilt's incompetence brought the
Cards three straight points to
9-12.
George McPheeters and
Duralde then took command for
Stanford. McPheeters put two sets
down for points and Duralde
twice blocked Dipper hits to guide
Stanford to a 13-13 tie.
Defeat Snatched
However, Stanford, not to be
denied, snatched defeat from the
jaws of victory.
A free ball which went
untouched and a wild hit by Steve
Hoch, which was last reported
over Mountain View, cost the
Cards the win and the distinction
of ending the Dips' 90-game win
streak.
Despite Hoch's ending mistake
he was tough for Stanford all
evening. He hit and blocked well
and was particularly instrumental
in Stanford's two winning games
where he had the winning hits.
Wilt Impressed
Wilt was impressed with
Stanford's improvement from last
year, when the Dippers won easily
in four games. He said, "Yea, you
guys have improved a 10t... that
one little kid [Duralde] is pretty
good."
Norman said, "It was a good

match. We certainly didn't play
well, but its always fun when you
win."
Stanford's Mannon said, "the
Dips weren't as good as they were
before, although Norman and
Parker made up a lot. We should
have beat them."
As one famous American put
it, "There's always next year,"
when the Dippers return to
Stanford again.

Stanford's two points came on
a bad pass by Wilt and on a nice
hit by the Cards' Alan
Christiansen.
Card Comeback
As you might imagine,
Stanford came back. Player-Coach
Mike Allio started the regrouping
with a good hit off a one-handed
Tom Duralde set.
The Dippers rallied to lead

12-6 but Willie Mannon's hits and
Wilt's incompetence brought the
Cards three straight points to
9-12.
George McPheeters and
Duralde then took command for
Stanford. McPheeters put two sets
down for points and Duralde
twice blocked Dipper hits to guide
Stanford to a 13-13 tie.
Defeat Snatched
However, Stanford, not to be
denied, snatched defeat from the
jaws of victory.
A free ball which went
untouched and a wild hit by Steve
Hoch, which was last reported
over Mountain View, cost the
Cards the win and the distinction
of ending the Dips' 90-game win
streak.
Despite Hoch's ending mistake
he was tough for Stanford all
evening. He hit and blocked well
and was particularly instrumental
in Stanford's two winning games
where he had the winning hits.
Wilt Impressed
Wilt was impressed with
Stanford's improvement from last
year, when the Dippers won easily
in four games. He said, "Yea, you
guys have improved a 10t... that
one little kid [Duralde] is pretty
good."
Norman said, "It was a good

match. We certainly didn't play
well, but its always fun when you
win."
Stanford's Mannon said, "the
Dips weren't as good as they were
before, although Norman and
Parker made up a lot. We should
have beat them."
As one famous American put
it, "There's always next year,"
when the Dippers return to
Stanford again.
The Stanford volleyball team
came as close as one possibly can
Friday before falling to Wilt's Big
Dippers 12-15, 15-11, 12-15,
15-11, 13-15.
The exciting match, played
before about 2500 in Maples
Pavilion, was extremely even from
start to finish, with a good hit or a
mental mistake making the
difference.
Dippers Mike Norman and
Dodge Parker were impressive
throughout. Parker put up
repeated perfect sets from every
angle and the amazing Norman,
who just may jump as high as
David Thompson, pounded them
down.
The deciding game was
paradoxical for Stanford and very
typical of the evening. Bad passes,
missed hits and some good hits by
Wilt Chamberlain put the Cards
down quickly at 7-2.
