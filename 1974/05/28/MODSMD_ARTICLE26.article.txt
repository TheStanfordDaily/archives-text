# Lane Wins 'Decathlon'
## 
### 
Mac Arthur Lane, star running
back for the Green Bay Packers,
finished first at the second annual
Professional Athletes Decathlon at
Foothill College Saturday.
Lane trailed Golden State
Warriors guard Jim Barnett, most
of the day but eventually caught
up, according to the confusing
scoring system.
Fewer than 1000 spectators
attended the event. They grew
restive at times, jeering officials
who huddled trying to straighten
out disputed point totals. But
otherwise, the fans had a good
time at the March of Dimes
charity event, as a dozen pro
athletes keenly contested the
events in picturesque surroundings
and brilliant sunshine.
Lane won the 100 yard dash in
10.6 and heaved a football 66
yards to surprise two
quarterbacks, Bob Lee of Atlanta
and former Stanford star Jim
Plunkett, who finished second and
third.

Barnett won the bowling
competition with a 591 series, and
tied Cazzie Russell for the
basketball free throw crown.
Russell also "starred" in
swimming (he can't swim) by
holding onto the side of the pool
and edging forward.
The cycling event was
cancelled when four bikes broke
down under the weight of such
250-pounders as Caz Banaszek of
the 49ers and Tom Mack of the
Rams.
Plunkett did get his revenge
when he whomped a softball 340
feet to win. Lane sewed up his
overall win when he finished
second with a hit measured at 300
feet.
When it was all over, Lane had
664 points and a $1000 check,
Barnett, 662 and $500 and Craig
Patrick of the California Seals
hockey team 655 and $300,
which he donated to the March of
Dimes, which made $206,000
from the event.
