One Tape Implicates Nixon?
WASHINGTON — Three Republicans on the
House Judiciary Committee say President
Nixon's hush money conversation of March 21,
1973, is the only evidence they have heard that
could tend to implicate the chief executive in
the Watergate coverup.
But Vice President Gerald R. Ford said in a
separate interview that what he earlier termed as
Nixon's stonewall attitude toward the
impeachment panel could in itself have an
adverse effect on the committee's final
judgment.
In Charlottesville, Va., former Special
Prosecutor Archibald Cox said Nixon's refusal
to comply with the committee's evidence
demands is one of three possible grounds for
removing him from office.
Potentially even more serious, said Cox,
would be Nixon's disobedience of a Supreme
Court decree to turn over tapes and documents.
Cox's successor, Leon Jaworski, is now seeking
such an order from the high court.
Cox named as the third and broadest ground
for impeachment the failure of Nixon to restrain
his White House aides and campaigners who
were involved in the scandal.
The three GOP committee members,
interviewed over the Memorial Day recess, said
the March 21 discussion between Nixon and
then-counsel John Dean is not definitive as to
whether the President directly ordered a hush
payment to a Watergate burglar.
But "In all honesty there is information on
that tape that might tend to incriminate the
President," said Rep. Charles Wiggins, R-Calif.
Wiggins and Reps. David Dennis, R-Ind., and
Henry Smith, R-N.Y., all had insisted before
listening to the tape last week that the inquiry
had yet to hear any evidence implicating Nixon.
Now they say the March 21 talk, particularly
Nixon's directive to Dean to "get it" during the
payment exchange, could be a turnaround
point—provided it is clarified with further
investigation.
Ford: Nixon Gains Support
WASHINGTON — Vice President Gerald R.
Ford says he sees some gain in President Nixon's
public support and an increased determination

among the President's strong backers.
'The strong Nixon supporters have gotten
stronger, and I think he has gained some with
the public," Ford said in an interview.
"Certainly, his supporters are more dedicated,
more vigorous."
The vice president said, however, that he
didn't tell Nixon of his findings at their meeting
last Thursday. 'That never came up," he said.
Though he prefers it otherwise, the vice
president said, "Subjectively, I suspect public
opinion may have an impact" on the
congressional decision on whether Nixon should
be impeached and removed from office.
"I hope the decision would be predicated on
the facts as they relate to a definition of an
impeachable offense in the Constitution," Ford
said. 'That's the way the decision ought to be
made."
He also said he fears Nixon's refusal to
cooperate further with the House Judiciary
Committee could be a factor. "I hope it isn't,
but it could be," he said.
Ford has made clear he plans to continue
stating his public disapproval of what he has
called Nixon's stonewall attitude in dealing with
the impeachment inquiry. At his request,
however the interview did not include that
subject.
No Syria-Israel Peace Pact Yet
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger came up short of a Syrian-Israeli
disengagement accord yesterday despite
round-the-clock negotiations with Syrian
President Hafez Assad.
But the secretary of state told newsmen he
was determined to have one last shot at it before
leaving the Middle East.
Kissinger scheduled a late-night meeting with
Israeli leaders after arriving here from his 12th
and last shuttle to Damascus. He said the final
result would not be known until he sent
Undersecretary of State Joseph Sisco to Syria
today for a meeting with Assad.
Kissinger met Sunday night and three times
yesterday with Assad — the last time with
drafting specialists at hand — leaving Damascus
as his Soviet counterpart Andrei Gromyko
arrived to "continue the exchange of opinions"
with the Syrians about a Middle East accord.

A senior American official said most of the
settlement documents are already prepared, but
with brackets for the unresolved issues. The
main obstacle is known to be Syrian insistence
on a scaled-down buffer zone between the
separated armies on the Golan Heights.
There are "other problems" as well, including
Israel's quest for safeguards from Palestinian
terrorist incursions, officials said.
Meanwhile, Israel and Syria exchanged
artillery fire for the 77th consecutive day
yesterday, the military command said.
No casualties were reported.
Belfast Strike Worsens
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Electrical
workers walked off the job at midnight
yesterday as part of a plan by militant
Protestants to shut down all essential services in
this troubled British province.
The electricity supply, already at a minimal
25 percent as the Protestant general strike
entered its 14th day, was being slowly run
down. A spokesman in the office of Merlyn
Rees, Britain's minister for Northern Ireland,
said it was not known whether British troops
would move in to maintain the electricity
supply.
The Ulster Workers Council, organizers of the
crippling strike, threatened a total shutdown of
essential services after 500 British troops moved
at dawn yesterday to take over control of two
Ulster oil depots and 21 service stations.
The British government now faces the
prospect of directing its more than 16,500
troops in the province to maintain electricity,
gas, water, and sewage services in addition to
keeping bread, milk and other food supplies
moving to Ulster's one-and-a-half million
inhabitants.
India Strike Ends
NEW DELHI, India — India's striking rail
unions unconditionally abandoned their
nationwide walkout yesterday after a bitter
20-day standoff with Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi.
Their collapse marked a major political victory
for Gandhi, who in the face of vociferous
opposition firmly refused to resume
negotiations until the workers returned to their

posts.
Officials of the action committee
representing the unions behind the strike
acknowledged they had no guarantee that any
of their demands would be met.
But citing the economic consequences of
further prolonging the action, they called on
workers to go back to work at 6 a.m. today and
"do everything within their power to bring
normalcy into the movement of trains."
The rail network normally carries 7.3 million
passengers and 550,000 tons of freight a day.
The government says two-thirds of the rail
traffic was maintained during the strike.
Giscard dlSstaing Takes Office
PARIS — Valery Giscard d'Estaing formally
took office yesterday as the 20th president of
France and appointed Jacques Chirac, a young
dissident Gaullist, as his prime minister.
In a four-minute inaugural speech, the
48-year-old president promised to open a new
era in French politics by governing in
consultation with all shades of political opinion.
He symbolized the new style by spurning the
traditional dress suit with tails and walking
briskly through cheering crowds to the
inauguration ceremony in the Elysee Palace.
His election on May 19 brought to an end 16
years of uninterrupted Gaullist rule. The
Gaullist party remains the largest single group in
the National Assembly and could block Giscard
d'Estaing's policies — thought not his
appointments.
The appointment of Chirac — at 41 one of
the youngest premiers in the 103-year history of
the republic — had been widely predicted. He
led a movement within the Gaullist party to
oppose the official party nominee for president,
Jacques Chaban-Delmas, and was thus
instrumental in Giscard d'Estaing's election.

1973, is the only evidence they have heard that
could tend to implicate the chief executive in
the Watergate coverup.
But Vice President Gerald R. Ford said in a
separate interview that what he earlier termed as
Nixon's stonewall attitude toward the
impeachment panel could in itself have an
adverse effect on the committee's final
judgment.
In Charlottesville, Va., former Special
Prosecutor Archibald Cox said Nixon's refusal
to comply with the committee's evidence
demands is one of three possible grounds for
removing him from office.
Potentially even more serious, said Cox,
would be Nixon's disobedience of a Supreme
Court decree to turn over tapes and documents.
Cox's successor, Leon Jaworski, is now seeking
such an order from the high court.
Cox named as the third and broadest ground
for impeachment the failure of Nixon to restrain
his White House aides and campaigners who
were involved in the scandal.
The three GOP committee members,
interviewed over the Memorial Day recess, said
the March 21 discussion between Nixon and
then-counsel John Dean is not definitive as to
whether the President directly ordered a hush
payment to a Watergate burglar.
But "In all honesty there is information on
that tape that might tend to incriminate the
President," said Rep. Charles Wiggins, R-Calif.
Wiggins and Reps. David Dennis, R-Ind., and
Henry Smith, R-N.Y., all had insisted before
listening to the tape last week that the inquiry
had yet to hear any evidence implicating Nixon.
Now they say the March 21 talk, particularly
Nixon's directive to Dean to "get it" during the
payment exchange, could be a turnaround
point—provided it is clarified with further
investigation.
Ford: Nixon Gains Support
WASHINGTON — Vice President Gerald R.
Ford says he sees some gain in President Nixon's
public support and an increased determination

among the President's strong backers.
'The strong Nixon supporters have gotten
stronger, and I think he has gained some with
the public," Ford said in an interview.
"Certainly, his supporters are more dedicated,
more vigorous."
The vice president said, however, that he
didn't tell Nixon of his findings at their meeting
last Thursday. 'That never came up," he said.
Though he prefers it otherwise, the vice
president said, "Subjectively, I suspect public
opinion may have an impact" on the
congressional decision on whether Nixon should
be impeached and removed from office.
"I hope the decision would be predicated on
the facts as they relate to a definition of an
impeachable offense in the Constitution," Ford
said. 'That's the way the decision ought to be
made."
He also said he fears Nixon's refusal to
cooperate further with the House Judiciary
Committee could be a factor. "I hope it isn't,
but it could be," he said.
Ford has made clear he plans to continue
stating his public disapproval of what he has
called Nixon's stonewall attitude in dealing with
the impeachment inquiry. At his request,
however the interview did not include that
subject.
No Syria-Israel Peace Pact Yet
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger came up short of a Syrian-Israeli
disengagement accord yesterday despite
round-the-clock negotiations with Syrian
President Hafez Assad.
But the secretary of state told newsmen he
was determined to have one last shot at it before
leaving the Middle East.
Kissinger scheduled a late-night meeting with
Israeli leaders after arriving here from his 12th
and last shuttle to Damascus. He said the final
result would not be known until he sent
Undersecretary of State Joseph Sisco to Syria
today for a meeting with Assad.
Kissinger met Sunday night and three times
yesterday with Assad — the last time with
drafting specialists at hand — leaving Damascus
as his Soviet counterpart Andrei Gromyko
arrived to "continue the exchange of opinions"
with the Syrians about a Middle East accord.

A senior American official said most of the
settlement documents are already prepared, but
with brackets for the unresolved issues. The
main obstacle is known to be Syrian insistence
on a scaled-down buffer zone between the
separated armies on the Golan Heights.
There are "other problems" as well, including
Israel's quest for safeguards from Palestinian
terrorist incursions, officials said.
Meanwhile, Israel and Syria exchanged
artillery fire for the 77th consecutive day
yesterday, the military command said.
No casualties were reported.
Belfast Strike Worsens
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Electrical
workers walked off the job at midnight
yesterday as part of a plan by militant
Protestants to shut down all essential services in
this troubled British province.
The electricity supply, already at a minimal
25 percent as the Protestant general strike
entered its 14th day, was being slowly run
down. A spokesman in the office of Merlyn
Rees, Britain's minister for Northern Ireland,
said it was not known whether British troops
would move in to maintain the electricity
supply.
The Ulster Workers Council, organizers of the
crippling strike, threatened a total shutdown of
essential services after 500 British troops moved
at dawn yesterday to take over control of two
Ulster oil depots and 21 service stations.
The British government now faces the
prospect of directing its more than 16,500
troops in the province to maintain electricity,
gas, water, and sewage services in addition to
keeping bread, milk and other food supplies
moving to Ulster's one-and-a-half million
inhabitants.
India Strike Ends
NEW DELHI, India — India's striking rail
unions unconditionally abandoned their
nationwide walkout yesterday after a bitter
20-day standoff with Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi.
Their collapse marked a major political victory
for Gandhi, who in the face of vociferous
opposition firmly refused to resume
negotiations until the workers returned to their

posts.
Officials of the action committee
representing the unions behind the strike
acknowledged they had no guarantee that any
of their demands would be met.
But citing the economic consequences of
further prolonging the action, they called on
workers to go back to work at 6 a.m. today and
"do everything within their power to bring
normalcy into the movement of trains."
The rail network normally carries 7.3 million
passengers and 550,000 tons of freight a day.
The government says two-thirds of the rail
traffic was maintained during the strike.
Giscard dlSstaing Takes Office
PARIS — Valery Giscard d'Estaing formally
took office yesterday as the 20th president of
France and appointed Jacques Chirac, a young
dissident Gaullist, as his prime minister.
In a four-minute inaugural speech, the
48-year-old president promised to open a new
era in French politics by governing in
consultation with all shades of political opinion.
He symbolized the new style by spurning the
traditional dress suit with tails and walking
briskly through cheering crowds to the
inauguration ceremony in the Elysee Palace.
His election on May 19 brought to an end 16
years of uninterrupted Gaullist rule. The
Gaullist party remains the largest single group in
the National Assembly and could block Giscard
d'Estaing's policies — thought not his
appointments.
The appointment of Chirac — at 41 one of
the youngest premiers in the 103-year history of
the republic — had been widely predicted. He
led a movement within the Gaullist party to
oppose the official party nominee for president,
Jacques Chaban-Delmas, and was thus
instrumental in Giscard d'Estaing's election.

But Vice President Gerald R. Ford said in a
separate interview that what he earlier termed as
Nixon's stonewall attitude toward the
impeachment panel could in itself have an
adverse effect on the committee's final
judgment.
In Charlottesville, Va., former Special
Prosecutor Archibald Cox said Nixon's refusal
to comply with the committee's evidence
demands is one of three possible grounds for
removing him from office.
Potentially even more serious, said Cox,
would be Nixon's disobedience of a Supreme
Court decree to turn over tapes and documents.
Cox's successor, Leon Jaworski, is now seeking
such an order from the high court.
Cox named as the third and broadest ground
for impeachment the failure of Nixon to restrain
his White House aides and campaigners who
were involved in the scandal.
The three GOP committee members,
interviewed over the Memorial Day recess, said
the March 21 discussion between Nixon and
then-counsel John Dean is not definitive as to
whether the President directly ordered a hush
payment to a Watergate burglar.
But "In all honesty there is information on
that tape that might tend to incriminate the
President," said Rep. Charles Wiggins, R-Calif.
Wiggins and Reps. David Dennis, R-Ind., and
Henry Smith, R-N.Y., all had insisted before
listening to the tape last week that the inquiry
had yet to hear any evidence implicating Nixon.
Now they say the March 21 talk, particularly
Nixon's directive to Dean to "get it" during the
payment exchange, could be a turnaround
point—provided it is clarified with further
investigation.
Ford: Nixon Gains Support
WASHINGTON — Vice President Gerald R.
Ford says he sees some gain in President Nixon's
public support and an increased determination

among the President's strong backers.
'The strong Nixon supporters have gotten
stronger, and I think he has gained some with
the public," Ford said in an interview.
"Certainly, his supporters are more dedicated,
more vigorous."
The vice president said, however, that he
didn't tell Nixon of his findings at their meeting
last Thursday. 'That never came up," he said.
Though he prefers it otherwise, the vice
president said, "Subjectively, I suspect public
opinion may have an impact" on the
congressional decision on whether Nixon should
be impeached and removed from office.
"I hope the decision would be predicated on
the facts as they relate to a definition of an
impeachable offense in the Constitution," Ford
said. 'That's the way the decision ought to be
made."
He also said he fears Nixon's refusal to
cooperate further with the House Judiciary
Committee could be a factor. "I hope it isn't,
but it could be," he said.
Ford has made clear he plans to continue
stating his public disapproval of what he has
called Nixon's stonewall attitude in dealing with
the impeachment inquiry. At his request,
however the interview did not include that
subject.
No Syria-Israel Peace Pact Yet
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger came up short of a Syrian-Israeli
disengagement accord yesterday despite
round-the-clock negotiations with Syrian
President Hafez Assad.
But the secretary of state told newsmen he
was determined to have one last shot at it before
leaving the Middle East.
Kissinger scheduled a late-night meeting with
Israeli leaders after arriving here from his 12th
and last shuttle to Damascus. He said the final
result would not be known until he sent
Undersecretary of State Joseph Sisco to Syria
today for a meeting with Assad.
Kissinger met Sunday night and three times
yesterday with Assad — the last time with
drafting specialists at hand — leaving Damascus
as his Soviet counterpart Andrei Gromyko
arrived to "continue the exchange of opinions"
with the Syrians about a Middle East accord.

A senior American official said most of the
settlement documents are already prepared, but
with brackets for the unresolved issues. The
main obstacle is known to be Syrian insistence
on a scaled-down buffer zone between the
separated armies on the Golan Heights.
There are "other problems" as well, including
Israel's quest for safeguards from Palestinian
terrorist incursions, officials said.
Meanwhile, Israel and Syria exchanged
artillery fire for the 77th consecutive day
yesterday, the military command said.
No casualties were reported.
Belfast Strike Worsens
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Electrical
workers walked off the job at midnight
yesterday as part of a plan by militant
Protestants to shut down all essential services in
this troubled British province.
The electricity supply, already at a minimal
25 percent as the Protestant general strike
entered its 14th day, was being slowly run
down. A spokesman in the office of Merlyn
Rees, Britain's minister for Northern Ireland,
said it was not known whether British troops
would move in to maintain the electricity
supply.
The Ulster Workers Council, organizers of the
crippling strike, threatened a total shutdown of
essential services after 500 British troops moved
at dawn yesterday to take over control of two
Ulster oil depots and 21 service stations.
The British government now faces the
prospect of directing its more than 16,500
troops in the province to maintain electricity,
gas, water, and sewage services in addition to
keeping bread, milk and other food supplies
moving to Ulster's one-and-a-half million
inhabitants.
India Strike Ends
NEW DELHI, India — India's striking rail
unions unconditionally abandoned their
nationwide walkout yesterday after a bitter
20-day standoff with Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi.
Their collapse marked a major political victory
for Gandhi, who in the face of vociferous
opposition firmly refused to resume
negotiations until the workers returned to their

posts.
Officials of the action committee
representing the unions behind the strike
acknowledged they had no guarantee that any
of their demands would be met.
But citing the economic consequences of
further prolonging the action, they called on
workers to go back to work at 6 a.m. today and
"do everything within their power to bring
normalcy into the movement of trains."
The rail network normally carries 7.3 million
passengers and 550,000 tons of freight a day.
The government says two-thirds of the rail
traffic was maintained during the strike.
Giscard dlSstaing Takes Office
PARIS — Valery Giscard d'Estaing formally
took office yesterday as the 20th president of
France and appointed Jacques Chirac, a young
dissident Gaullist, as his prime minister.
In a four-minute inaugural speech, the
48-year-old president promised to open a new
era in French politics by governing in
consultation with all shades of political opinion.
He symbolized the new style by spurning the
traditional dress suit with tails and walking
briskly through cheering crowds to the
inauguration ceremony in the Elysee Palace.
His election on May 19 brought to an end 16
years of uninterrupted Gaullist rule. The
Gaullist party remains the largest single group in
the National Assembly and could block Giscard
d'Estaing's policies — thought not his
appointments.
The appointment of Chirac — at 41 one of
the youngest premiers in the 103-year history of
the republic — had been widely predicted. He
led a movement within the Gaullist party to
oppose the official party nominee for president,
Jacques Chaban-Delmas, and was thus
instrumental in Giscard d'Estaing's election.

adverse effect on the committee's final
judgment.
In Charlottesville, Va., former Special
Prosecutor Archibald Cox said Nixon's refusal
to comply with the committee's evidence
demands is one of three possible grounds for
removing him from office.
Potentially even more serious, said Cox,
would be Nixon's disobedience of a Supreme
Court decree to turn over tapes and documents.
Cox's successor, Leon Jaworski, is now seeking
such an order from the high court.
Cox named as the third and broadest ground
for impeachment the failure of Nixon to restrain
his White House aides and campaigners who
were involved in the scandal.
The three GOP committee members,
interviewed over the Memorial Day recess, said
the March 21 discussion between Nixon and
then-counsel John Dean is not definitive as to
whether the President directly ordered a hush
payment to a Watergate burglar.
But "In all honesty there is information on
that tape that might tend to incriminate the
President," said Rep. Charles Wiggins, R-Calif.
Wiggins and Reps. David Dennis, R-Ind., and
Henry Smith, R-N.Y., all had insisted before
listening to the tape last week that the inquiry
had yet to hear any evidence implicating Nixon.
Now they say the March 21 talk, particularly
Nixon's directive to Dean to "get it" during the
payment exchange, could be a turnaround
point—provided it is clarified with further
investigation.
Ford: Nixon Gains Support
WASHINGTON — Vice President Gerald R.
Ford says he sees some gain in President Nixon's
public support and an increased determination

among the President's strong backers.
'The strong Nixon supporters have gotten
stronger, and I think he has gained some with
the public," Ford said in an interview.
"Certainly, his supporters are more dedicated,
more vigorous."
The vice president said, however, that he
didn't tell Nixon of his findings at their meeting
last Thursday. 'That never came up," he said.
Though he prefers it otherwise, the vice
president said, "Subjectively, I suspect public
opinion may have an impact" on the
congressional decision on whether Nixon should
be impeached and removed from office.
"I hope the decision would be predicated on
the facts as they relate to a definition of an
impeachable offense in the Constitution," Ford
said. 'That's the way the decision ought to be
made."
He also said he fears Nixon's refusal to
cooperate further with the House Judiciary
Committee could be a factor. "I hope it isn't,
but it could be," he said.
Ford has made clear he plans to continue
stating his public disapproval of what he has
called Nixon's stonewall attitude in dealing with
the impeachment inquiry. At his request,
however the interview did not include that
subject.
No Syria-Israel Peace Pact Yet
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger came up short of a Syrian-Israeli
disengagement accord yesterday despite
round-the-clock negotiations with Syrian
President Hafez Assad.
But the secretary of state told newsmen he
was determined to have one last shot at it before
leaving the Middle East.
Kissinger scheduled a late-night meeting with
Israeli leaders after arriving here from his 12th
and last shuttle to Damascus. He said the final
result would not be known until he sent
Undersecretary of State Joseph Sisco to Syria
today for a meeting with Assad.
Kissinger met Sunday night and three times
yesterday with Assad — the last time with
drafting specialists at hand — leaving Damascus
as his Soviet counterpart Andrei Gromyko
arrived to "continue the exchange of opinions"
with the Syrians about a Middle East accord.

A senior American official said most of the
settlement documents are already prepared, but
with brackets for the unresolved issues. The
main obstacle is known to be Syrian insistence
on a scaled-down buffer zone between the
separated armies on the Golan Heights.
There are "other problems" as well, including
Israel's quest for safeguards from Palestinian
terrorist incursions, officials said.
Meanwhile, Israel and Syria exchanged
artillery fire for the 77th consecutive day
yesterday, the military command said.
No casualties were reported.
Belfast Strike Worsens
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Electrical
workers walked off the job at midnight
yesterday as part of a plan by militant
Protestants to shut down all essential services in
this troubled British province.
The electricity supply, already at a minimal
25 percent as the Protestant general strike
entered its 14th day, was being slowly run
down. A spokesman in the office of Merlyn
Rees, Britain's minister for Northern Ireland,
said it was not known whether British troops
would move in to maintain the electricity
supply.
The Ulster Workers Council, organizers of the
crippling strike, threatened a total shutdown of
essential services after 500 British troops moved
at dawn yesterday to take over control of two
Ulster oil depots and 21 service stations.
The British government now faces the
prospect of directing its more than 16,500
troops in the province to maintain electricity,
gas, water, and sewage services in addition to
keeping bread, milk and other food supplies
moving to Ulster's one-and-a-half million
inhabitants.
India Strike Ends
NEW DELHI, India — India's striking rail
unions unconditionally abandoned their
nationwide walkout yesterday after a bitter
20-day standoff with Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi.
Their collapse marked a major political victory
for Gandhi, who in the face of vociferous
opposition firmly refused to resume
negotiations until the workers returned to their

posts.
Officials of the action committee
representing the unions behind the strike
acknowledged they had no guarantee that any
of their demands would be met.
But citing the economic consequences of
further prolonging the action, they called on
workers to go back to work at 6 a.m. today and
"do everything within their power to bring
normalcy into the movement of trains."
The rail network normally carries 7.3 million
passengers and 550,000 tons of freight a day.
The government says two-thirds of the rail
traffic was maintained during the strike.
Giscard dlSstaing Takes Office
PARIS — Valery Giscard d'Estaing formally
took office yesterday as the 20th president of
France and appointed Jacques Chirac, a young
dissident Gaullist, as his prime minister.
In a four-minute inaugural speech, the
48-year-old president promised to open a new
era in French politics by governing in
consultation with all shades of political opinion.
He symbolized the new style by spurning the
traditional dress suit with tails and walking
briskly through cheering crowds to the
inauguration ceremony in the Elysee Palace.
His election on May 19 brought to an end 16
years of uninterrupted Gaullist rule. The
Gaullist party remains the largest single group in
the National Assembly and could block Giscard
d'Estaing's policies — thought not his
appointments.
The appointment of Chirac — at 41 one of
the youngest premiers in the 103-year history of
the republic — had been widely predicted. He
led a movement within the Gaullist party to
oppose the official party nominee for president,
Jacques Chaban-Delmas, and was thus
instrumental in Giscard d'Estaing's election.
Today's Weather

coast, mid 60s to mid 70s inland. Small craft
advisory for westerly wind 15 to 30 mph
afternoons and evenings.
One Tape Implicates Nixon?
WASHINGTON — Three Republicans on the
House Judiciary Committee say President
Nixon's hush money conversation of March 21,
1973, is the only evidence they have heard that
could tend to implicate the chief executive in
the Watergate coverup.
But Vice President Gerald R. Ford said in a
separate interview that what he earlier termed as
Nixon's stonewall attitude toward the
impeachment panel could in itself have an
adverse effect on the committee's final
judgment.
