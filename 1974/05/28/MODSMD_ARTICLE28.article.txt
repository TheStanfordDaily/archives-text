## 
### 
The Stanford African Famine
Relief Committee should collect
almost $1370 from its Fast For
Mankind held last week, according to
fast coordinator Laurie Coplen.
'This will bring the total funds
collected by the group on campus this
year to almost $9000," Coplen, an
economics major, said.
The fast which lasted from 7 p.m.
Thursday until 7 p.m. Friday involved
25 students. Each student solicited
pledges from other students to cover
the 24-hour fasting period.
"No student was allowed to fast
longer than 24 hours because we
didn't want anybody to get sick,"
Coplen said.
Ato Mensah, a sophomore from
Ghana, received the largest total
pledge ($200) for his fast.
"This was the most efficient event
we've had so far," Coplen said,
"because I didn't have to do much
work. Each individual was responsible
for getting pledges. The student
response was really good."
The students who fasted must now
collect the money for the committee.
