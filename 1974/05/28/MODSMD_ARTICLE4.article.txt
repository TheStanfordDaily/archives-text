# Falsified Skin Cancer Research
## Summerlin's Colleagues Surprised 
### GEORGE TIBBITS 
Several Medical Center researchers
and faculty members who knew Dr.
William T. Summerlin while he worked
here from 1967 to 1971 expressed
shock at learning of charges that
Summerlin, a dermatologist, faked
research results while at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer
Research in New York City.
According to the New York Times,
a five-man peer review committee at
the institute concluded Friday that
Summerlin, 35, "deliberately falsified
and misrepresented research results"
and recommended terminating him as
a researcher.
The Times reported that Dr. Lewis
Thomas, president of the cancer
center, said "the fraud in this work is a
result of mental illness."
Summerlin, the Times reported,
told the committee that he had
colored the skin of two white mice
with a pen to make them appear to
have accepted skin grafts from
genetically different animals. He also
admitted misrepresenting the results of
experiments in transplanting human
corneas into rabbits' eyes, the
newspaper said.
Began Here
Summerlin was a resident at the
Stanford Medical Center for three
years beginning in 1967 and then
worked at the Stanford VA hospital
for a year and a half. As a
teacher-in-training here in 1969, he
worked with Assoc. Prof, of
Dermatology Marvin A. Karasek. A
recent issue of Science magazine
described their work as a
demonstration that whole human skin
could be kept "for extended periods
of time" in a culture and then

transplanted back to the person from
whom it was taken.
Karasek declined to comment on
the findings against Summerlin, saying
that he had not yet seen the
committee's report.
Dr. Eugene Farber, chairman of the
Dermatology Department, described
the work Summerlin did here as "some
very valuable contributions on skin
tissues living in cultures." He also
characterized Summerlin as being
"four cuts above an average resident,"
a man who did "excellent and reliable
work" while at Stanford.
'Complete Surprise'
"What took place subsequently to
his departure was a complete
surprise," Farber said. "I wouldn't
have predicted he would have done
something like this."
Farber also stressed that he was
reluctant to make any final
conclusions on the matter since he had
not read the committee's report. "Not
knowing what happened at
Sloan-Kettering, it's hard to have an
opinion," he said.
In work after his research with
Karasek, Summerlin reportedly found
in clinical studies that human skin
becomes transplantable even among
genetically unrelated beings after being
maintained in an organ culture for
four to six weeks. In March 1973, he
told a meeting of the American Cancer
Society that experimental studies with
mice confirmed this.
This experimental work was
conducted at the University of
Minnesota, where Summerlin had
moved in August of 1971 at the
invitation of immunologist Dr. Robert
A. Good. When Good was named
director of the Sloan-Kettering

Institute in January 1973, Summerlin
went with him to continue his
research.
Not Duplicated
Other experimenters, however,
including tissue expert and Nobel
Laureate Sir Peter Medawar, found
they were unable to duplicate
Summerlin's findings. A research
fellow at Sloan-Kettering, Dr. John
Ninnemann, was also unable to
produce Summerlin's results.
According to the Times,
Ninnemann submitted a paper for
publication in the journal
Transplantation describing these
negative findings. The coloring of the
mouse skin allegedly occurred in
March of this year as an attempt by
Summerlin to head off the report's
publication, the Times said.
Thomas said that a year of paid
absence from the institute has been
given to Summerlin while he
undergoes psychiatric care and that
Summerlin would not return to the
institute. The Times also reported that
Good was criticized for not overseeing
Summerlin's work more closely.
