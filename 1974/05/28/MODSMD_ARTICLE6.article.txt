# Gillmor Stresses Local Political Experience
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor insists that only a
candidate who has deeply involved himself in the affairs of
the 12th Congressional District should win the June 4
Democratic primary.
Gillmor claims he has done more for the people in the
district, which includes Stanford, than any of his three
opponents.
Generally acknowledged as the front runner in the
contest for the Democratic nomination, Gillmor explained
to the Daily last week that he is ahead of the other
contenders because his name is well recognized throughout
the district.
"Name recognition is not an unfair advantage," Gillmor
said. "One's name becomes well known when one does
something, and I have been doing things for the people of
this district for many years."
Experience
Gillmor cited his nine years on the Santa Clara City
Council as evidence of his service to the people in the
district. In addition to his six years as Santa Clara mayor,
Gillmor has also served as chairman of the Northern
California Power Agency, which has explored the energy
problems of an area which includes both Santa Clara and
Palo Alto.
Gillmor said that as mayor, he has been instrumental in
reducing property taxes for five consecutive years, and has
succeeded in establishing a drug abuse program, a senior

citizens' facility, a senior citizens' nutrition program, and a
recreation center for youth.
"I have never been attacked for my accomplishments as
mayor," Gillmor noted. "All attacks on me have been
personal because people can't attack my record."
Emphasizes Economic Issues
Gillmor declared he is emphasizing economic issues in
the campaign, especially inflation.
"Congress needs to exert more force in dealing with
inflation," Gillmor said. "It should start curing abuses in
the tax system and curb the powers of special interests such
as banks."
Gillmor is also advocating a national health program,
especially one for the middle class.
'The less fortunate people have welfare and programs
such as Medicare," Gillmor stated. "The wealthy people
have plenty of money and don't need help. But people in
between are often ruined by high medical bills."
There should definitely be a program similar to the one
sponsored by Edward Kennedy, said Gillmor, who noted
that he does not agree with all of the provisions of that
program.
Gillmor also said that as a congressman he would
encourage extensive government research in the prevention
of heart and cancer diseases.
Commitment To Education
Calling himself "totally devoted to education," Gillmor
cited his experience as a government teacher at West Valley

Community College as evidence of his commitment to
education.
Gillmor also said that the government needs to do more
to dissolve monopolies. He said he has studied the problem
of monopolies so extensively that he was called several
times as an expert witness to committee hearings on
monopolies directed by former Sen. Fred Harris, D-Okla.
Gillmor said he also supports a reduction in defense
spending. "We already have enough munitions," he noted.
He also expressed support for the volunteer army,
explaining that he opposes the draft. "The army must make
certain changes," he said. "It must do away with some of
its traditions and start giving soldiers proper pay."
Environmental Stances
Although Gillmor said he basically favors the Alaska
pipeline, he noted that he supports it "only with strict
controls."
Noting that the Environmental Protection Agency
should be strengthened, Gillmor stated that the government
should also look for a sponsor to research and develop
alternate forms of energy and encourage the utilization of
such sources.
Gillmor said that he is the only Democrat in the race
who could defeat J. Gordon Knapp, an Atherton
businessman who is seeking the Republican nomination.
He also predicted that he would have a good chance of
upsetting Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park,
although he admitted, "I'd be the underdog."

of monopolies so extensively that he was called several
times as an expert witness to committee hearings on
monopolies directed by former Sen. Fred Harris, D-Okla.
Gillmor said he also supports a reduction in defense
spending. "We already have enough munitions," he noted.
He also expressed support for the volunteer army,
explaining that he opposes the draft. "The army must make
certain changes," he said. "It must do away with some of
its traditions and start giving soldiers proper pay."
Environmental Stances
Although Gillmor said he basically favors the Alaska
pipeline, he noted that he supports it "only with strict
controls."
Noting that the Environmental Protection Agency
should be strengthened, Gillmor stated that the government
should also look for a sponsor to research and develop
alternate forms of energy and encourage the utilization of
such sources.
Gillmor said that he is the only Democrat in the race
who could defeat J. Gordon Knapp, an Atherton
businessman who is seeking the Republican nomination.
He also predicted that he would have a good chance of
upsetting Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park,
although he admitted, "I'd be the underdog."

Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor insists that only a
candidate who has deeply involved himself in the affairs of
the 12th Congressional District should win the June 4
Democratic primary.
Gillmor claims he has done more for the people in the
district, which includes Stanford, than any of his three
opponents.
Generally acknowledged as the front runner in the
contest for the Democratic nomination, Gillmor explained
to the Daily last week that he is ahead of the other
contenders because his name is well recognized throughout
the district.
"Name recognition is not an unfair advantage," Gillmor
said. "One's name becomes well known when one does
something, and I have been doing things for the people of
this district for many years."
Experience
Gillmor cited his nine years on the Santa Clara City
Council as evidence of his service to the people in the
district. In addition to his six years as Santa Clara mayor,
Gillmor has also served as chairman of the Northern
California Power Agency, which has explored the energy
problems of an area which includes both Santa Clara and
Palo Alto.
Gillmor said that as mayor, he has been instrumental in
reducing property taxes for five consecutive years, and has
succeeded in establishing a drug abuse program, a senior

citizens' facility, a senior citizens' nutrition program, and a
recreation center for youth.
"I have never been attacked for my accomplishments as
mayor," Gillmor noted. "All attacks on me have been
personal because people can't attack my record."
Emphasizes Economic Issues
Gillmor declared he is emphasizing economic issues in
the campaign, especially inflation.
"Congress needs to exert more force in dealing with
inflation," Gillmor said. "It should start curing abuses in
the tax system and curb the powers of special interests such
as banks."
Gillmor is also advocating a national health program,
especially one for the middle class.
'The less fortunate people have welfare and programs
such as Medicare," Gillmor stated. "The wealthy people
have plenty of money and don't need help. But people in
between are often ruined by high medical bills."
There should definitely be a program similar to the one
sponsored by Edward Kennedy, said Gillmor, who noted
that he does not agree with all of the provisions of that
program.
Gillmor also said that as a congressman he would
encourage extensive government research in the prevention
of heart and cancer diseases.
Commitment To Education
Calling himself "totally devoted to education," Gillmor
cited his experience as a government teacher at West Valley

Community College as evidence of his commitment to
education.
Gillmor also said that the government needs to do more
to dissolve monopolies. He said he has studied the problem
of monopolies so extensively that he was called several
times as an expert witness to committee hearings on
monopolies directed by former Sen. Fred Harris, D-Okla.
Gillmor said he also supports a reduction in defense
spending. "We already have enough munitions," he noted.
