## Endorsements 
### 
Here are our endorsements in the upcoming june 4
elections: '
FOR GOVERNOR — We endorse Congressman jerome
Waldie in the Democratic primary and state Controller
Houston Floumoy for the Republicans.
Waldie, from Contra Costa County, has been an able and
concerned representative who has spoken out forthrightly
against Big Business domination of the state and against
those who would use positions of public trust for personal
accumulation of power. While we also find that Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti stands for many of the same things, we
find Waldie the most desirable Democratic candidate.
For the Republicans, there is little choice. Flournoy's
opponent is Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke, currently under
indictment for perjury in the ITT case. It would be
disastrous for Republicans to choose a Watergate-stained
candidate in this of all years. Floumoy, on the other hand,
helped found the moderate California Republican League,
and has attracted support from such diverse figures as Rep.
Paul McCloskey and industrialist and former Deputy
Defense Secretary David Packard. He is by far the better
candidate.
FOR U.S. SENATOR — We back incumbent Sen. Alan
Cranston in the Democratic primary and make no
endorsement in the Republican primary. Sen. Cranston has
done an able job in his first term, and should be returned to
office; we find both major Republican candidates equally
distasteful.
ON PALO ALTO CITY MEASURE B - We recommend a
NO vote on the measure to establish a Rent Control Board
for Palo Alto. We don't argue that there is a serious housing
crunch in the area, and we don't argue the need for action to
combat it. But Measure B is not the answer. It would roll
back rents to their January, 1973 level, without taking into
account rising taxes and inflation since then; it would allow
rent increases only on a case-by-case hearing basis, thus
creating a near-chaotic situation, since thousands of cases
must be heard; it would require a new level of bureaucracy
to deal with all those cases; and there is even some evidence
that it would exacerbate the situation it was designed to
solve by forcing rates so low that they would attract
outsiders to the area to compete with current residents for
already-scarce housing. In addition, there is some doubt as
to the plan's legality: a similar board was ruled illegal by an
Alameda County Superior Court in a decision currently
under appeal.
ON STATE MEASURE 1 — We recommend a YES vote
on the bond issue for acquisition of recreational lands.
ON STATE MEASURE 2 - We recommend a YES vote
on the bond issue to provide funds for water pollution
control.
ON STATE MEASURE 3 — We recommend a YES vote
on the bond issue to continue the Cal-Vet program of
low-interest loans to California veterans.
ON STATE MEASURE 4 - We urge a YES vote to allow
property tax reassessment of damaged property.
ON STATE MEASURE 5 - We urge a YES vote on the/
proposition to allow vehicle fees and gas tax revenues to be
used to fund public mass transit systems. As we learned to
our collective dismay during the recent gas shortage, the
time for exclusive dependence on the private automobile has
passed. The condition of the world energy supply and the
condition of the environment demand more and better mass
public transit; Proposition 5 provides the funding for such
programs, while at the same time not eliminating use of
funds for necessary highway maintenance and construction.
ON STATE MEASURE 6 - We support a YES vote to
ensure that legislative and committee meetings are open to
the public whenever possible.
ON STATE MEASURE 7 - We back a YES vote to
exempt staff members of the California Commission on
Postsecondary Education from state civil service
requirements. This will ensure that the best possible
personnel can be obtained to fill these posts.
ON STATE MEASURE 8 - We back a YES vote on the
measure to allow Sacramento City and County to
consolidate its governmental structure, while allowing other
communities in the county to join in the reorganized system
if they so desire.
ON STATE MEASURE 9 - We support a YES vote on
the Political Reform Initiative. This measure would set
spending limits for statewide campaigns, require full
disclosure for all campaign contributions above $50;
prohibit public officials from voting on matters in which
they have a financial stake; limit lobbyists' activities;
prohibit cash contributions above $50; and establish an
independent commission on campaign practices.
If Watergate has shown anything, it is the need to
continually monitor the electoral system to prevent the
flagrant and consistent abuses of the system that have
become so common. This measure is tough — but to keep
the system from collapsing under the weight of its own
corruption, that's precisely what's needed.

FOR U.S. SENATOR — We back incumbent Sen. Alan
Cranston in the Democratic primary and make no
endorsement in the Republican primary. Sen. Cranston has
done an able job in his first term, and should be returned to
office; we find both major Republican candidates equally
distasteful.
ON PALO ALTO CITY MEASURE B - We recommend a
NO vote on the measure to establish a Rent Control Board
for Palo Alto. We don't argue that there is a serious housing
crunch in the area, and we don't argue the need for action to
combat it. But Measure B is not the answer. It would roll
back rents to their January, 1973 level, without taking into
account rising taxes and inflation since then; it would allow
rent increases only on a case-by-case hearing basis, thus
creating a near-chaotic situation, since thousands of cases
must be heard; it would require a new level of bureaucracy
to deal with all those cases; and there is even some evidence
that it would exacerbate the situation it was designed to
solve by forcing rates so low that they would attract
outsiders to the area to compete with current residents for
already-scarce housing. In addition, there is some doubt as
to the plan's legality: a similar board was ruled illegal by an
Alameda County Superior Court in a decision currently
under appeal.
ON STATE MEASURE 1 — We recommend a YES vote
on the bond issue for acquisition of recreational lands.
ON STATE MEASURE 2 - We recommend a YES vote
on the bond issue to provide funds for water pollution
control.
ON STATE MEASURE 3 — We recommend a YES vote
on the bond issue to continue the Cal-Vet program of
low-interest loans to California veterans.
ON STATE MEASURE 4 - We urge a YES vote to allow
property tax reassessment of damaged property.
ON STATE MEASURE 5 - We urge a YES vote on the/
proposition to allow vehicle fees and gas tax revenues to be
used to fund public mass transit systems. As we learned to
our collective dismay during the recent gas shortage, the
time for exclusive dependence on the private automobile has
passed. The condition of the world energy supply and the
condition of the environment demand more and better mass
public transit; Proposition 5 provides the funding for such
programs, while at the same time not eliminating use of
funds for necessary highway maintenance and construction.
ON STATE MEASURE 6 - We support a YES vote to
ensure that legislative and committee meetings are open to
the public whenever possible.
ON STATE MEASURE 7 - We back a YES vote to
exempt staff members of the California Commission on
Postsecondary Education from state civil service
requirements. This will ensure that the best possible
personnel can be obtained to fill these posts.
ON STATE MEASURE 8 - We back a YES vote on the
measure to allow Sacramento City and County to
consolidate its governmental structure, while allowing other
communities in the county to join in the reorganized system
if they so desire.
ON STATE MEASURE 9 - We support a YES vote on
the Political Reform Initiative. This measure would set
spending limits for statewide campaigns, require full
disclosure for all campaign contributions above $50;
prohibit public officials from voting on matters in which
they have a financial stake; limit lobbyists' activities;
prohibit cash contributions above $50; and establish an
independent commission on campaign practices.
If Watergate has shown anything, it is the need to
continually monitor the electoral system to prevent the
flagrant and consistent abuses of the system that have
become so common. This measure is tough — but to keep
the system from collapsing under the weight of its own
corruption, that's precisely what's needed.
Here are our endorsements in the upcoming june 4
elections: '
FOR GOVERNOR — We endorse Congressman jerome
Waldie in the Democratic primary and state Controller
Houston Floumoy for the Republicans.
Waldie, from Contra Costa County, has been an able and
concerned representative who has spoken out forthrightly
against Big Business domination of the state and against
those who would use positions of public trust for personal
accumulation of power. While we also find that Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti stands for many of the same things, we
find Waldie the most desirable Democratic candidate.
For the Republicans, there is little choice. Flournoy's
opponent is Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke, currently under
indictment for perjury in the ITT case. It would be
disastrous for Republicans to choose a Watergate-stained
candidate in this of all years. Floumoy, on the other hand,
helped found the moderate California Republican League,
and has attracted support from such diverse figures as Rep.
Paul McCloskey and industrialist and former Deputy
Defense Secretary David Packard. He is by far the better
candidate.
FOR U.S. SENATOR — We back incumbent Sen. Alan
Cranston in the Democratic primary and make no
endorsement in the Republican primary. Sen. Cranston has
