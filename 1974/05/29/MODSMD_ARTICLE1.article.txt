# University Won't Try To Bust USE—Lyman
## 
### DON CCX 
"I want to emphasize it is not our
intention and we do not see it in our
interests to try to break the
strike ... or the union," President
Richard Lyman said on KZSU's
Campus Conference last night.
He said the workers in the
bargaining unit represented by the
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union were "valuable" and are needed
to operate the University.
"Every effort should be made not
to destroy the sense of community"
among everyone at Stanford, Lyman
said.
"We're going to be working
together again when this strike is
resolved," he said.
Lyman added that "certainly the
strike is not about to be settled,"
though he expressed hope that an
agreement could be reached soon.
New Procedure
Commenting on a new procedure
instituted by both sides in which
comments on negotiations are to be
given only in joint releases, Lyman
said the arrangement "ought to be
seen as a positive sign."
"Bargaining should be done in
negotiations and not in the press or on
radio," he said.
Lyman noted that the procedure
was necessary for a free exchange of
ideas at the bargaining table since "our
interests are in successfully bargaining
and arriving at a contract which is
mutually acceptable."
Affects Quality
The strike is affecting the quality
and the function of the University,
Lyman said.
It is only through the "Herculean
efforts of the personnel" still on the
job that the University can remain
functional, he said.
"The cost in human and economic
terms is very great indeed," Lyman
stated.
Lyman also expressed concern over
the increasing incidents of sabotage on
campus. Some of the acts "have
inherent in them threats to human

safety," Lyman said.
Lyman said he didn't know who
was responsible and to assign any
responsibility would be "leaping to
conclusions without adequate"
evidence.
He said security had been increased
but there was no "complete
guarantee" of absolute security.
Other Issues
Shifting to other issues, Lyman said
proponents of a new ROTC program
on campus exaggerated their claims of
substantial interest among the
freshman class in such a program.
The Stanford Committee on ROTC
recently released a poll that showed
117 of the freshman class of 1500 had
expressed interest in a ROTC program.
The poll "really doesn't represent
any kind of committment," said
Lyman. "I remain open to argument
but I don't consider the expression of
the possibility of involvement
overwhelming," he said.
In any event, "ROTC as constituted
at Stanford [in earlier years] will
never come back," he said.
Reviewing the last year, Lyman
explained that there was in evidence
"very desirable change towards
concern for a more liberal education"
for undergraduates. Lyman said he
hoped this movement would continue.

intention and we do not see it in our
interests to try to break the
strike ... or the union," President
Richard Lyman said on KZSU's
Campus Conference last night.
He said the workers in the
bargaining unit represented by the
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union were "valuable" and are needed
to operate the University.
"Every effort should be made not
to destroy the sense of community"
among everyone at Stanford, Lyman
said.
"We're going to be working
together again when this strike is
resolved," he said.
Lyman added that "certainly the
strike is not about to be settled,"
though he expressed hope that an
agreement could be reached soon.
New Procedure
Commenting on a new procedure
instituted by both sides in which
comments on negotiations are to be
given only in joint releases, Lyman
said the arrangement "ought to be
seen as a positive sign."
"Bargaining should be done in
negotiations and not in the press or on
radio," he said.
Lyman noted that the procedure
was necessary for a free exchange of
ideas at the bargaining table since "our
interests are in successfully bargaining
and arriving at a contract which is
mutually acceptable."
Affects Quality
The strike is affecting the quality
and the function of the University,
Lyman said.
It is only through the "Herculean
efforts of the personnel" still on the
job that the University can remain
functional, he said.
"The cost in human and economic
terms is very great indeed," Lyman
stated.
Lyman also expressed concern over
the increasing incidents of sabotage on
campus. Some of the acts "have
inherent in them threats to human

safety," Lyman said.
Lyman said he didn't know who
was responsible and to assign any
responsibility would be "leaping to
conclusions without adequate"
evidence.
He said security had been increased
but there was no "complete
guarantee" of absolute security.
Other Issues
Shifting to other issues, Lyman said
proponents of a new ROTC program
on campus exaggerated their claims of
substantial interest among the
freshman class in such a program.
The Stanford Committee on ROTC
recently released a poll that showed
117 of the freshman class of 1500 had
expressed interest in a ROTC program.
The poll "really doesn't represent
any kind of committment," said
Lyman. "I remain open to argument
but I don't consider the expression of
the possibility of involvement
overwhelming," he said.
In any event, "ROTC as constituted
at Stanford [in earlier years] will
never come back," he said.
Reviewing the last year, Lyman
explained that there was in evidence
"very desirable change towards
concern for a more liberal education"
for undergraduates. Lyman said he
hoped this movement would continue.
