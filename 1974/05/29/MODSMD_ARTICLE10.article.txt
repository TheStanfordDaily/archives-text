# Memories Of Professor Juan Flores

Juan Flores was one of the few good
teachers that I found in four years at
Stanford. Drifting through Berkeley the
other day I ran across a Stanford Daily with
articles on his non-renewal of contract. I was
angered and disillusioned when I discovered
them.
Juan taught that to educate means to
grow aware and to grow aware means to
change the only force that we can change —
our every day Hues. He showed me that the
more personal aspects of an individual's
behavior, the way he or she intimately affects
(oppresses or liberates) others around him or
her, are realities at the university and
important areas of study.
He not only cared about the material he
taught, and knew it well, but cared about
how it related to our daily lives. Often our
freshman seminar back in fall 1969,
"Literature and Politics," would run late into
the evening as we all pushed further and
further into, perhaps, the effects of the
Russian milieu on Dostoevsky's Crime and
Punishment or the illumination of Balzac's
bourgeois background in the political
purposes of Pere Goriot.
Awareness Grows
That there was a political purpose to Pere
Goriot, or to Goethe's The Sorrows of Young
Werthere, or to Tolstoi's The Death of Ivan
Ilyich, shocked me as a young freshman at
Stanford. My awareness that politics is an

every-day experience grew as Juan patiently
listened to our recollections of our own
personal experiences and to our earnest
questionings and challenges.
Self-awareness and introspection were just
becoming tools for my use rather than
overwhelming irrational feelings of
powerlessness. Juan's sensitivity and personal
openness were crucial factors in my ability to
open up to the ideas in the seminar and take
responsibility for my participation in them.
Anyone who has not felt the enormity of
the processes that I am describing, or feels
that I am misrepresenting the meaning of the
word "politics" or "literature," should read
Jean-Paul Sartre's What is Literature? as we
did at the beginning of the seminar.
Then think about your own creative
process and consider how it is not only
shaped but grown from your own personal
history — from your own self-doubts,
self-knowledge and self-confidence.
: Process of Reflection
Then, consider the comfort and time it
takes to really work out a project, revising it,
honing it and presenting it for others to deal
with. Remember that this ability to recall,
refine and reflect are quite dependent upon
your leisure time, and upon the quality of
your ability to work freely and honestly.
Then, note how often this well-developed
ability to perform all of the above functions
is dependent upon a caring and supportive
educator.

Winter a year ago I decided to register for
another course with Juan. As a veteran senior
at Stanford I felt confident in my own
methods of study and looked forward to
inspecting, again, Juan as a teacher.
That the course, "Marx and Freud," was
considered a freaky area of study at Stanford
was clear by the randomness that these two
thinkers' writings had appeared on course
syllabi.
Ideas Not Understood
That they were not well understood in the
university community was clear by the
cavalier-manner in which their ideas were
referred to by every hack commentator on
the psychological or revolutionary "scene."
I found a tremendous quality in Juan's
presentations, both on Marx and on Freud.
He worked hard to maintain a rigor in our
study and walked the very difficult line
between practice and theory within the
confines of a university structure.
Stanford had a good Marxist scholar in
Juan, and a fine educator. His firing (which is
what a non-renewal of contract really is)
clearly indicates how far the administration is
willing to go to protect itself from any
transforming notions of education.
I hope that everyone will rethink their
own notions of education and learn from this
action.

in Anthropology.)
