# A 						Call For Student Support Of USE
## 
### 
Scott Singer, et al.

Stanford, like other private
universities, is having its financial
troubles. But when compared to
the rest of our society, it remains
an essentially wealthy institution,
and most of its students,
professors, and administrators live
quite comfortably.
This year's graduation
ceremony will demonstrate that
reality once more: to give the
ritual its necessary dignity, each
graduate is being asked to rent a
cap and gown. At five, 10, and 12
dollars — for a bachelors, masters,
and doctoral cap and gown,
respectively — that will amount to
a lot of money.
As we stroll into Frost
Amphitheatre, however, another
segment of the Stanford
community, not included in our
ceremony, will be in near
desperate straits.
Unless the strike has been
settled by June 16, striking USE
members will not have seen a
paycheck for close to a month.
Even if a settlement is reached
before June 16, the returning
workers will go over two weeks on
the job before getting paid.
No Strike Fund
The union, because it is new,
has no strike fund with which to
weather the storm. Its Hardship
Committee is sending people to
the county welfare offices, but
realizes that will solve only part
of their problems.
If they're lucky, they will be
able to raise enough money to
give these strikers who cannot
otherwise make ends meet $13
per week for food, $30 if he or
she has a family to feed.
University medical coverage will
continue through June, but at the
cost of an extra $21 already
deducted from every striker's May
paycheck.
Other bills, sent as rent,
utilities, car payments, and phone
bills, will simply go unpaid in
many cases, and the strikers will
hope for the best.

Its going to be very difficult
for Stanford workers who earn
$408 a month (and take home
less) to pay off their debts once
the strike has been settled.
Strike Debts
The union itself is going to be
in the hole from debts incurred in
running the strike — manning an
office, phones, providing food for
its staff and picketers, and the
like.
Student support, or lack
thereof, will make a difference in
the final outcome of the
bargaining. Financial support is
extremely important if the union
is to last out the strike.
Graduating seniors and
graduate students, unless they

value academic decorum more
than the economic security of
Stanford workers and their union,
have an opportunity to help. We
graduating seniors (listed below)
have decided the least we can do
is donate our cap and gown
money to the union, and we urge
others to do the same.
We will be manning a table and
collecting money outside the
bookstore, where cap and gown
rentals take place, during the
rental hours: 8:30 a.m. to 5:30
p.m., June 10-15.
Even if you are not attending
the ceremony or planning to wear
a cap and gown, we urge you to
demonstrate your support of USE
with a contribution.

This graduating class entered
Stanford the year of the Laos
invasion (some of us the year
before, when the student body
struck in response to the invasion
of Cambodia).
We lived through the end of
the antiwar movement, including
the May 1972 bombing of Hanoi
and Haiphong and the December
1972 terror bombing.
Now the struggle has come
home, and some people at
Stanford need our help. Let us go
out with one last gesture. We hope
to see you between June 10 and
June 15.
(Scott Singer, David Osborne, Ray
Riggle, David Corkery and John
Junkerman are graduating
seniors.)
