# Philosophy Against Faith
## 
### 
Nick Smith

I am somewhat disappointed in Bill Evers'
discussion of the religious debate in the recent
Stanford Review. He sides with Prof. Tooley to the
complete exclusion of the claims made by Robert
Hamerton-Kelley, in the same issue.
Now, a detailed evaluation of the latter's views
would require considerably more space than you
are likely to want to give this article in your
newspaper, but I would like to give my reaction,
and the reaction I think it is reasonable (even
responsible) to expect from those of us who
opened our hearts to Hamerton-Kelley.
Before I do, however, I think it may serve to
better chastise Evers for his oversight, if I can
briefly characterize where this chastisement is
coming from.
Most of my intelligent life has been spent
wallowing in the mire of "impertinent and
inhuman" sentiment about religious questions. Woe
is me, # I have long been a "recently-hatched
philosopher" (although I am something of an
expert on Plato — a quality I had not realized I
shared with Hamerton-Kelley .. . until now, of
course), using "flashy logic" (lets face it, is there
really any other kind?) rather than the deep
thought of blind faith.
All these things — "flashy," "brittle," "posing"

— I have been. And the worst of my woes, I now
realize, has been that not once have I ever been the
slightest bit emotionally, rationally, or in any other
way, inclined to the position Hamerton-Kelley
suggests "lies on the sea bed of the spirit" — that's
my spirit, too, you know, I do have one (I think).
And now, after years of thought, and
considerable study of the issue, I find that "religion
is ... self-authenticating"! It is, we are to suppose,
like the glasses we looked everywhere to find, only
to suddenly realize that they were perched, all
along, right smack on the old schnozzola.
My reaction, in short, was one of complete
rapture. It gave me sheer delight to discover that all
my dim views about religion, along with the
correlative views about its advocates, were, after all,
completely and unequivocally correct.
Shame on you, Bill Evers, for failing to notice
that the best evidence against religion was to be
found not in Prof. Tooley's "flashy logic," but in
the grim reminder Hamerton-Kelley's discussion
gives us — to believe in religion is to place oneself in
a position where one's only replies to one's critics
are cheap-shots and sophistical clap-trap, dressed up
in mystical mumbo-jumbo (note the hyphens).
Now, God, turn me into a turnip, if you dare!

Shame on you, Bill Evers, for failing to notice
that the best evidence against religion was to be
found not in Prof. Tooley's "flashy logic," but in
the grim reminder Hamerton-Kelley's discussion
gives us — to believe in religion is to place oneself in
a position where one's only replies to one's critics
are cheap-shots and sophistical clap-trap, dressed up
in mystical mumbo-jumbo (note the hyphens).
Now, God, turn me into a turnip, if you dare!

I am somewhat disappointed in Bill Evers'
discussion of the religious debate in the recent
Stanford Review. He sides with Prof. Tooley to the
complete exclusion of the claims made by Robert
Hamerton-Kelley, in the same issue.
Now, a detailed evaluation of the latter's views
would require considerably more space than you
are likely to want to give this article in your
newspaper, but I would like to give my reaction,
and the reaction I think it is reasonable (even
responsible) to expect from those of us who
opened our hearts to Hamerton-Kelley.
Before I do, however, I think it may serve to
better chastise Evers for his oversight, if I can
briefly characterize where this chastisement is
coming from.
Most of my intelligent life has been spent
wallowing in the mire of "impertinent and
inhuman" sentiment about religious questions. Woe
is me, # I have long been a "recently-hatched
philosopher" (although I am something of an
expert on Plato — a quality I had not realized I
shared with Hamerton-Kelley .. . until now, of
course), using "flashy logic" (lets face it, is there
really any other kind?) rather than the deep
thought of blind faith.
All these things — "flashy," "brittle," "posing"

— I have been. And the worst of my woes, I now
realize, has been that not once have I ever been the
slightest bit emotionally, rationally, or in any other
way, inclined to the position Hamerton-Kelley
suggests "lies on the sea bed of the spirit" — that's
my spirit, too, you know, I do have one (I think).
And now, after years of thought, and
considerable study of the issue, I find that "religion
is ... self-authenticating"! It is, we are to suppose,
like the glasses we looked everywhere to find, only
to suddenly realize that they were perched, all
along, right smack on the old schnozzola.
My reaction, in short, was one of complete
rapture. It gave me sheer delight to discover that all
my dim views about religion, along with the
correlative views about its advocates, were, after all,
completely and unequivocally correct.
