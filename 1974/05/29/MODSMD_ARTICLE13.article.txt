Press Workers Strike
Editor:
Contrary to statements in
Friday's Daily attributed to Frank
Luiz, there are eight employees of
the Stanford University Press in 1
the bargaining unit represented by
USE; all are union members; all
are on strike.
The other four Press craft
unions have, in fact, been asked to
support the strike. To understand
their response, three things should
be clear:
1) Many Press employees are
"company" men and women —
they'd probably cross the picket
lines if their own unions were on
strike.
2) Some have been intimidated
— they have expressed fear of
losing their jobs if they support
the strike openly.
3) The craft unions of the Press
are all under the thumb of the
Press Director, Leon Seltzer. Each
of them has been compelled to
include a "no-strike" clause in its
contract with Stanford.
Under threat of voiding their
contracts, members of these
unions are forbidden to engage in
work stoppages, slowdowns,
picketing, or any other form of
organized action in support of
themselves or of any other union.
Surely this is an outrageous
infringement of the right of free
speech. Predictably, these
emasculated unions have declined
to support the strike; whether
because of intimidation or from
habits of subservience, all but a
handful of their members have
been crossing our picket lines.
Lest any conclude from this
that loyalty on the inside is
unbroken, monetary support from
Press employees has been
impressive, amounting so far to
several hundred dollars.

Editor:
Almost every active student
supporter of USE has been
photographed again and again by
Stanford police and University
administrators. There is a video
tape camera overlooking the
medical school picket line.
No one has broken the law or
done anything to warrant this
kind of harassment. Assistant
Vice-President for Medical Affairs
(former Air Force Officer and
Pentagon Vietnam consultant)
Peter Carpenter has tried to
intimidate picketers by thrusting a
camera in their faces and
demanding "Are you the picket
captain?"
Is this the way to react to
legitimate, legal protest? There is
only one way to justify the
present expense and effort being
used to photograph strikers and
supporters; That is if the pictures
are going to be filed away for
future reference.
Most people of the Stanford
community would be shocked if
they knew how deeply political
activists fear the administration.
Radical faculty members rely on
tenured professors for many
public stands because tenured
professors have more job security.
Some students active in
impeachment and the Nguyen
Huu Thai campaign are now
wondering if they shouldn't have
a lower profile — they fear being
singled out by the administration
or the police at some future time
Meanwhile, the workers are
invoved in a terrible struggle. To
lose the strike would mean a large
number of activist workers would
be purged. If you think this is
para n oia, read the
administration's contract
proposals to USE on freedoms
and hearings. Why is the
administration refusing to write
first amendment freedoms into
the contract?
The faculty has recently been
cowed and restricted by the
recently approved faculty
discipline guidelines. The workers
are being faced with an out-right
purge.
And just recently, Lyman has
started making demands on the
ASSU for more information on
prospective committee members.
These are not coincidences
Repression and administration
control will only grow worse if we
do nothing to stop it.

activists fear the administration.
Radical faculty members rely on
tenured professors for many
public stands because tenured
professors have more job security.
Some students active in
impeachment and the Nguyen
Huu Thai campaign are now
wondering if they shouldn't have
a lower profile — they fear being
singled out by the administration
or the police at some future time
Meanwhile, the workers are
invoved in a terrible struggle. To
lose the strike would mean a large
number of activist workers would
be purged. If you think this is
para n oia, read the
administration's contract
proposals to USE on freedoms
and hearings. Why is the
administration refusing to write
first amendment freedoms into
the contract?
The faculty has recently been
cowed and restricted by the
recently approved faculty
discipline guidelines. The workers
are being faced with an out-right
purge.
And just recently, Lyman has
started making demands on the
ASSU for more information on
prospective committee members.
These are not coincidences
Repression and administration
control will only grow worse if we
do nothing to stop it.

Press Workers Strike
Editor:
Contrary to statements in
Friday's Daily attributed to Frank
Luiz, there are eight employees of
the Stanford University Press in 1
the bargaining unit represented by
USE; all are union members; all
are on strike.
The other four Press craft
unions have, in fact, been asked to
support the strike. To understand
their response, three things should
be clear:
1) Many Press employees are
"company" men and women —
they'd probably cross the picket
lines if their own unions were on
strike.
2) Some have been intimidated
— they have expressed fear of
losing their jobs if they support
the strike openly.
3) The craft unions of the Press
are all under the thumb of the
Press Director, Leon Seltzer. Each
of them has been compelled to
include a "no-strike" clause in its
contract with Stanford.
Under threat of voiding their
contracts, members of these
unions are forbidden to engage in
work stoppages, slowdowns,
picketing, or any other form of
organized action in support of
themselves or of any other union.
Surely this is an outrageous
infringement of the right of free
speech. Predictably, these
emasculated unions have declined
to support the strike; whether
because of intimidation or from
habits of subservience, all but a
handful of their members have
been crossing our picket lines.
Lest any conclude from this
that loyalty on the inside is
unbroken, monetary support from
Press employees has been
impressive, amounting so far to
several hundred dollars.

Editor:
Almost every active student
supporter of USE has been
photographed again and again by
Stanford police and University
administrators. There is a video
tape camera overlooking the
medical school picket line.
No one has broken the law or
done anything to warrant this
kind of harassment. Assistant
Vice-President for Medical Affairs
(former Air Force Officer and
Pentagon Vietnam consultant)
Peter Carpenter has tried to
intimidate picketers by thrusting a
camera in their faces and
demanding "Are you the picket
captain?"
Is this the way to react to
legitimate, legal protest? There is
only one way to justify the
present expense and effort being
used to photograph strikers and
supporters; That is if the pictures
are going to be filed away for
future reference.
Most people of the Stanford
community would be shocked if
they knew how deeply political
activists fear the administration.
