# Symposium Scheduled To Assist Advising
## 
### MARTHA ADAMS 
Students are needed to advise
advisors.
The purpose is a symposium,
being held Sept. 16 and 17, "to
try to do a little bit more — giving
formal sessions — to help advisors
do their job better," says Mason
Yearian, Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
Primarily new advisors and
those who don't have much
contact with undergraduate
students will be meeting with
administration officials, seasoned
advisors, and selected students to
discuss the problems advisors and
students encounter, says Yearian.
Case Studies
Case studies of students will be
presented at the symposium as
examples of problems that have
occurred, how they've been
solved, and possibly how they
could have been handled more
effectively.
Case studies are needed, says
Rich Beleson, student member of
the ASSU Subcommittee on
Advising, "Unless we get students
coming to me with their problems
and case studies, all the work and
all the interpretations will be
handled through the formal
advising system instead of through
primary student sources."
The subcommittee on advising
came up with the idea for an
advising symposium.
Case Studies
'To get something out of these
case studies, we want the students
to put time and thought into what
they're going to say. We don't
want people to rant and rave off
the top of their heads," Beleson
says.

The main thrust of the
symposium will be at the
problems of freshmen and transfer
students, according to Yearian.
Kathy Hays, chairperson of the
Subcommittee on Advising,
doesn't entirely agree. "I think
that one of the main problems
with advising is to get the advisors
enthusiastic about advising."
'Person To Person Basis'
She would like the symposium
to help make professors more
aware of the possibilities of
getting to know the student on a
person to person basis. "It's not
necessary to become chummy
buddies or anything ... but a
professor has a lot to give. A lot
of people really wish they knew a
professor better," she says.
"There is a set of expectations
on the part of the advisor.
Unfortunately they don't always
jibe," says Bob Hamrdla, Assistant
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
and head of the Academic
Information Center (AIC).
Students interested in
participating can contact Beleson
by leaving their phone number
with Bob Hamrdla at the
Academic Information Center, or
writing during the summer.

buddies or anything ... but a
professor has a lot to give. A lot
of people really wish they knew a
professor better," she says.
"There is a set of expectations
on the part of the advisor.
Unfortunately they don't always
jibe," says Bob Hamrdla, Assistant
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
and head of the Academic
Information Center (AIC).
Students interested in
participating can contact Beleson
by leaving their phone number
with Bob Hamrdla at the
Academic Information Center, or
writing during the summer.
Students don't have to attend the
symposium.
Students are needed to advise
advisors.
The purpose is a symposium,
being held Sept. 16 and 17, "to
try to do a little bit more — giving
formal sessions — to help advisors
do their job better," says Mason
Yearian, Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
Primarily new advisors and
those who don't have much
contact with undergraduate
students will be meeting with
administration officials, seasoned
advisors, and selected students to
discuss the problems advisors and
students encounter, says Yearian.
Case Studies
Case studies of students will be
presented at the symposium as
examples of problems that have
occurred, how they've been
solved, and possibly how they
could have been handled more
effectively.
Case studies are needed, says
Rich Beleson, student member of
the ASSU Subcommittee on
Advising, "Unless we get students
coming to me with their problems
and case studies, all the work and
all the interpretations will be
handled through the formal
advising system instead of through
primary student sources."
The subcommittee on advising
came up with the idea for an
advising symposium.
Case Studies
'To get something out of these
case studies, we want the students
to put time and thought into what
they're going to say. We don't
want people to rant and rave off
the top of their heads," Beleson
says.

The main thrust of the
symposium will be at the
problems of freshmen and transfer
students, according to Yearian.
Kathy Hays, chairperson of the
Subcommittee on Advising,
doesn't entirely agree. "I think
that one of the main problems
with advising is to get the advisors
enthusiastic about advising."
'Person To Person Basis'
She would like the symposium
to help make professors more
aware of the possibilities of
getting to know the student on a
person to person basis. "It's not
necessary to become chummy
buddies or anything ... but a
professor has a lot to give. A lot
of people really wish they knew a
professor better," she says.
"There is a set of expectations
on the part of the advisor.
Unfortunately they don't always
jibe," says Bob Hamrdla, Assistant
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
and head of the Academic
Information Center (AIC).
