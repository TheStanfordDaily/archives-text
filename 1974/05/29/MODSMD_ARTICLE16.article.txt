Memorial services will be held
today for Richard Ziebelman, an
anthropology graduate student,
who was killed in an automobile
accident while doing field research
for his dissertation in Boliva.
Rabbi Charles Familant of
Hillel will conduct the service at
3:15 p.m. in Memorial Church.
Ziebelman ran into the back of
a truck, 40 miles outside of
Lapaz, Bolivia, May 20 and was
taken to a Lapaz hospital. He
passed away last Wednesday,
following a brain operation.
Ziebelman, in his third year as
a graduate student, earned his
bachelor's degree in economics at
M.I.T. The topic of his
dissertation was "Structural
Transformation: Urbanization in
Santa Cruz, Bolivia."
The paper dealt with the way
"urban industrial process changes
the social structure of a city and
surrounding area," according to
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Ezra
Zubrow.
