# Women's Athletics: Problems And Solutions
## Publicity: Improvement Needed 
### 
Historically, I think the disparity in
coverage given to men's and women's
sports has related primarilly to the
traditional male chauvinism in society.
Until recently, of course, athletic
prowess was not valued at all in
women. This is changing now, mostly
on the professional scene as a result of
the emergence of tennis stars like
King, Evert, etc. . . and also in the
Olympic sphere.
But in intercollegiate sports, and
here Stanford is no exception,
women's sports still receives little
coverage. On the college level, at least
on campus, the chauvinism is less
pronounced, but men's sports are still
tremendously more popular and much
better attended.
The newspapers cater to what they
think the people want to read. The
Daily with a more liberal audience,
includes more coverage of women's
sports. The Palo Alto Times, catering
to the entire Peninsula Area, gives its
readers what they want—coverage of
men's sports.
The kicker, of course, is that more
coverage and attention to women's
sports could influence the values and
tastes of an area. The two, to some
extent, are interrelated. More coverage
could very well result in more
popularity, more interest, and better
attendance.
—Gary Cavalli, incoming sports
information director
It is not unusual for articles about
men to fill a newspaper's entire sports
section. Stories about female athletes
appear from time to time, but they
tend to report only big names and a
few top scores.
People who deal with sports
information or select what gets into print
were asked why the ratio of coverage
allotted Stanford's men and women
athletes persists as it does in campus
publications and local media.
Director of men's physical
education and athletics (MPE), Joseph
Ruetz cited the vigorous publicizing of
men's income-producing athletics by
the sports information director (SID),
whose salary is paid by MPE, as one
reason for the more extensive men's
coverage.
Chairman of the women's physical
education department (WPE), Pamela
Strathairn: "WPE does not have a 'pro'
in this area of journalism to provide
the needed information on a
consistent basis. Also, publicity
probably has the lowest priority
among the many concerns with which
the administration, coaches and
managers must deal on a daily basis."
Former Daily sports editor, Dave
Robinson: There are "not as many
women's events as men's and no
publicity is offered by the women's
department."
Palo Alto Times sports editor, Dave
Wik: "With space and time limitations,
we concentrate our efforts on
professional, college, junior college
and high school sports where spectator
and readership interest has been
gauged as very high."
I'd rate the coverage of Stanford
women's athletics in local media as
average, which is to say, very poor.
The two are synonymous, since the
average coverage, very definitely, is
very poor. The Daily's, in my opinion,
is good, because it is far superior to
the "average" coverage given women's
sports.
—Gary Cavalli
Varsity team members rated Daily
coverage of their activities as generally
poor, 21 categorizing it as either
"poor" or "very poor." Three
suggested it was improving from
"poor" to "average" and 11 placed it
solidly in the "average" category. Four
rated coverage "good" and one
woman, a swimmer, felt it was
"excellent."
The tennis players were most
uniform in their rating, with five team
members as well as the coach labeling
coverage "very poor."
Non-competing female athletes
were somewhat less critical, placing
four of their votes for "average," two
for 'good' and the remaining six from
just below 'average' to an emphatic
'very poor.'
Female coaches for swimming, field
hockey and basketball felt Daily
coverage of women's sports was
"good," while the women's physical
education department chairman agreed
with the golf and fencing coaches that
reporting was 'average.'
There were fewer but more uniform
ratings for Palo Alto Times coverage of
Stanford women's athletics. None of
the respondents gave the Times better
than an 'average' score. Twenty-eight
team members, four coaches and
Strathairn categorized the Times as
either 'poor' or 'very poor.' Two
players and a coach felt reporting was
'average.'
Non-competing athletes cast six of
seven votes in the 'poor' and 'very
poor' categories.
I don't think some people
understand why we crave Daily
publicity. We spend many hours
practicing, recuperating from matches,
getting sick from playing and spending
large amounts of time away from here.
Seeing the time we spend, the pride
we've given to the university, and the
time and grades we sacrificed, the
Daily has rewarded us with short
articles with incorrect scores and

incorrect spelling of our names. To say
the least, it's disappointing.
—Tracy Macnair, no. 1 singles
player for Stanford tennis team
All four Daily writers surveyed said
Daily coverage is improving but is, in
many respects, still inadequate. Two
cited female sportwriters as essential
for the paper's reporting of women's
events. Robinson insists there are "not
enough people interested in covering
women's sports despite fairly strong
efforts by sports editors to find
them."
Daily representatives also
complained that WPE does not supply
the paper with timely information.
WPE student managers and coaches
convey information to the media
personally. No one in WPE is
specifically charged with handling
publicity. The sports information

director (SID) does not report
women's activities or have formal ties
with WPE.
When Cavalli officially assumes the
SID post on June 17, the sports
information office will begin providing
the media with information about
Stanford's women's intercollegiates.
Then, according to Cavalli and Ruetz,
the main issue will become funding for
personnel to cover women's sports.
Ruetz cautions that "one cannot
assume that mere coverage of many
men's sports, as well as women's sports
by an SID or stringer will
automatically result in publicity. The
sports editor of local media still
decides what goes in his paper ..."
Wik reaffirms this statement:
"Women sports on the college level
appear to be in pioneer stage. But in
years to come, I see no notable change
in our coverage."
