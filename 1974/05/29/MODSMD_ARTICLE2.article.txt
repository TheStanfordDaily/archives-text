# Campaign Reform, Bond Issues Confront Voters On June Ballot
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Nine propositions will appear on
the June 4 primary ballot, including
provisions for bond issues amounting
to $850 million and a controversial
measure designed to regulate spending
in political campaigns.
Proposition 9, the most widely
discussed measure, would require
financial reporting and disclosure of
assets by public officials, limit
campaign expenditures and regulate
lobbyists. All contributions of more
than $50 would have to be reported.
The proposed law would be
administered by a five-member Fair
Political Practices Commission with
strong enforcement powers and an
annual budget of more than $1
million.
Sponsored by Common Cause, the
initiative would limit gifts by lobbyists
to $10 per month to any state
candidates or officials and require
lobbyists to register with the Secretary
of State, rather than the Joint
Committee of the Legislature.
The measure would also limit
spending in gubernatorial primary
campaigns to $980,000, the equivalent
of seven cents a vote. For the general
election, the limit would be raised to
$1.2 million.
Opposition
Strong opposition has developed
toward Prop. 9 among many groups in
the state, notablv organized labor.

According to John Henning,
secretary-treasurer of the 1.6
million-member California Labor
Federation, the proposition would
destroy the power of organized labor
in the state legislature by prohibiting
anyone who makes political
contributions from lobbying.
Some foes of the measure suggest
that it is unworkable, needlessly
complex and probably
unconstitutional.
But proponents of the proposition
insist that it would encourage honesty
in government and reduce the power
of special interest groups by
correspondingly increasing the clout
enjoyed by so-called good government
groups with low budgets.
Another controversial ballot
initiative is Proposition 5, which
would extend present use of revenues
from motor vehicle fuel taxes and
license fees for highway construction
to permit use for research, planning
and construction of mass transit
guideways.
Public Transportation
Proponents claim that Prop. 5
would help eliminate air pollution and
the energy crisis by improving public
transportation. They point out that
local voters would be consulted before
funds would be used for mass transit
projects and that this provision would
expand the control of local areas over
public spending.

Opponents of the measure insist
that it is unfair to motorists because
mass transit would not be financed by
those who would benefit from it.
Other propositions on the ballot
are:
— Proposition 1, which would
allocate $250 million for recreational
lands, allowing the State Park System
to acquire new parks and historical
units. It wo\ild also permit the system
to develop historical resources and
allocate funds to the Wildlife
Conservation Board for fish and
wildlife projects.
— Proposition 2, which would
allocate $250 million for water
pollution control.
— Proposition 3, which would
authorize the sale of state bonds
amounting to $350 million to be used
for farm and home purchase aid under
the Veteran's Home Purchase Act.
— Proposition 4, designed to allow
property tax reassessment of damaged
property.
— Proposition 6, forcing the
legislature and its committees to meet
in public.
— Proposition 7, exempting staff
members of the California Commission
on Postsecondary Education from
state civil service requirements.
— Proposition 8, allowing
Sacramento City and County to
consolidate their government
structures.

But proponents of the proposition
insist that it would encourage honesty
in government and reduce the power
of special interest groups by
correspondingly increasing the clout
enjoyed by so-called good government
groups with low budgets.
Another controversial ballot
initiative is Proposition 5, which
would extend present use of revenues
from motor vehicle fuel taxes and
license fees for highway construction
to permit use for research, planning
and construction of mass transit
guideways.
Public Transportation
Proponents claim that Prop. 5
would help eliminate air pollution and
the energy crisis by improving public
transportation. They point out that
local voters would be consulted before
funds would be used for mass transit
projects and that this provision would
expand the control of local areas over
public spending.

Opponents of the measure insist
that it is unfair to motorists because
mass transit would not be financed by
those who would benefit from it.
Other propositions on the ballot
are:
— Proposition 1, which would
allocate $250 million for recreational
lands, allowing the State Park System
to acquire new parks and historical
units. It wo\ild also permit the system
to develop historical resources and
allocate funds to the Wildlife
Conservation Board for fish and
wildlife projects.
— Proposition 2, which would
allocate $250 million for water
pollution control.
— Proposition 3, which would
authorize the sale of state bonds
amounting to $350 million to be used
for farm and home purchase aid under
the Veteran's Home Purchase Act.
— Proposition 4, designed to allow
property tax reassessment of damaged
property.
— Proposition 6, forcing the
legislature and its committees to meet
in public.
— Proposition 7, exempting staff
members of the California Commission
on Postsecondary Education from
state civil service requirements.
— Proposition 8, allowing
Sacramento City and County to
consolidate their government
structures.
Nine propositions will appear on
the June 4 primary ballot, including
provisions for bond issues amounting
to $850 million and a controversial
measure designed to regulate spending
in political campaigns.
Proposition 9, the most widely
discussed measure, would require
financial reporting and disclosure of
assets by public officials, limit
campaign expenditures and regulate
lobbyists. All contributions of more
than $50 would have to be reported.
The proposed law would be
administered by a five-member Fair
Political Practices Commission with
strong enforcement powers and an
annual budget of more than $1
million.
Sponsored by Common Cause, the
initiative would limit gifts by lobbyists
to $10 per month to any state
candidates or officials and require
lobbyists to register with the Secretary
of State, rather than the Joint
Committee of the Legislature.
The measure would also limit
spending in gubernatorial primary
campaigns to $980,000, the equivalent
of seven cents a vote. For the general
election, the limit would be raised to
$1.2 million.
Opposition
Strong opposition has developed
toward Prop. 9 among many groups in
the state, notablv organized labor.

According to John Henning,
secretary-treasurer of the 1.6
million-member California Labor
Federation, the proposition would
destroy the power of organized labor
in the state legislature by prohibiting
anyone who makes political
contributions from lobbying.
Some foes of the measure suggest
that it is unworkable, needlessly
complex and probably
unconstitutional.
