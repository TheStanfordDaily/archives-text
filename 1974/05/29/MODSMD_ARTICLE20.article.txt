# Players See Need For Change
## 
### 
Basketball
Members of the women's varsity basketball team,
unable to win more than one game last season,
unanimously listed a new coach as a desirable
program improvement.
Shirley Schoof's background, they point out, is
in tennis, badminton and bowling, not five-person
basketball. They contend Schoof, who has coached
the last three basketball seasons at Stanford, simply
does not know the strategies and techniques of the
game.
Schoof, who is familiar with the team's
disgruntlement, says "If we were winning there
wouldn't be all this dissatisfaction." She attributes
the varsity's poor record to the players' inability "to
put away individual ambitions and act like a team."
Schoof contrasts the varsity group, her "problem
children," with the undefeated junior varsity. The
JV's, she said, were "every bit as good" as the
varsity players, only younger and less experienced.
"There were times," said Schoof, "when I felt the
JV team should have been varsity."
She admits she hadn't played five-person
basketball before being appointed to coach the
game, but she feels qualified after the three year
experience. She enjoys coaching, she said, and
would like to continue.
"According to some players, I'm not qualified
... but neither is Howie Dallmar according to some
of his players."
One player, who says she agrees with the WPE
philosophy of teaching the educational and
recreational benefits of athletics, argues that they
need not be "mutually exclusive" with coaching.
Another woman summed up her impression of
the program, saying, "I think that the WPE
administration still doesn't like the idea of
strenuous competition in women's athletics."
Fencing
Jean Helliwell lupges and retreats across the
women's gym floor, pacing her coed varsity fencing
group. She coaches women's and men's foil teams
and men's epee and saber fencers. The teams placed
fourth, fifth, second and seventh,respectively, at the
Northern California Intercollegiate Fencing
championships earlier this year.
Helliwell is a specialist; she teaches and coaches
only fencing.
The female team members gave her top ratings.
Marie Fiatarone described Helliwell as "an excellent
coach dedicated to providing many options for her
fencers." The training, said Fiatarone, "is not
dominated with regulations and requirements but is
rather consciously left open ended to provide
flexibility. . .."
Fencers listed team spirit and encouragement as
program strengths, with only one woman hinting
that Helliwell's low-key coaching style was "good
for morale, [though] not always good for meets."
The few requests for program improvements ask
for more dual meets outside scheduled
intercollegiate ones, expansion of facilities and
increased publicity.
Field Hockey
Rained out part way through the conference
play-off, the varsity field hockey team still managed
to beat the only school it had tied during the regular
season to become the unofficial NCIAC champion.
This fall the team completed its second
consecutive undefeated season in five years under
coach Shirley Schoof.
The combination of good coaching and skilled
teammates has made Stanford "the strongest team
in NCIAC," said veteran hockey player and varsity
team member Diane Gates.
Two other varsity team members rated the
competitive program as 'good,' but they and the five
players who found the program 'average' or below,
were less enthusiastic about their training.
Marne Rath credited her teammates with
coaching each other. And, another player stated,
"The hockey successes over the past two years have
been due to an influx of good and excellent players
who would have accomplished the same with or

without Schoof."
Cora Presley, who has studied hockey for seven
years, taught the game and obtained her officiator's
license, characterized the coaching as "less intense"
than her previous training. But, she said, the team
seemed to benefit from the more relaxed
atmosphere.
Barbara Tyler, who played varsity basketball as
well as field hockey, said, "The coaching is
adequate, but does not help much if you want to
improve."
Golf
Without a league, conference or even much
competition, women's varsity golf coach Carroll Diaz
and her team are trying to build up the sport in
Northern California and at Stanford. They take
surveys, arrange meets and travel around to
invitationals.
Last week varsity golfers Libby Docker and Pat
Cornett placed second, one stroke behind the
leaders at a four-school match at California State
Hayward. Stanford's entire six-woman varsity golf
contingent will compete against teams from the
Santa Clara, Cal-State Sacramento, Cal-State
Hayward and San Francisco State next week at
Stanford.
Players were generally pleased with being able to
travel to invitationals and the opportunities to play
other courses.
They felt so strongly about poor media coverage
of their sport that two golfers listed it with
scholarships as among the improvements they would
like to see in their program.
Swimming
Winning the 50 yard breaststroke, freshman
Vicki Hays led varsity swimmers to an 11th place
finish in a field of 91 teams at the Association for
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW)
championships last March.
Kathi Heinze placed 12th in the 100 butterfly,
the 200 and 400 medley teams finished fifth and
eighth, respectively, and Hays came in second in
two other events, adding up to a strong showing for
Stanford.
Four of the swimmers surveyed rated their WPE
competitive program as below average. The same

number objected to signing up instead of trying out
for the varsity squad and other manifestations of
what one termed "enrollment red-tape."
Several of the swimmers, coached by Betsy
Weeks in WPE, also worked with MPE swimming
coach Jim Gaughran for more intensive training.
Gaughran noted that "the women's department is
not staffed or funded to respond to the increased
interest in women's intercollegiate activities."
Differing with six of their teammates, Marge
Meek and and Becky Burchell stated that WPE
coaching has met their needs as athletes in training.
"I'm not out for swimming to become a national
champion," said Burchell, "I just like to compete,
like the good exercise, meeting people and having a
good time together."
Meek said her Stanford [WPE] coaching has been
adequate "because it hasn't pushed me further than
my desires to train. In fact, it has been quite lax —
leaving the training amount up to the individual."
Tennis
The Stanford women's varsity tennis team,
boasting a selection of national, state, regional and
city champions, has won six consecutive Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
(NCIAC) titles under the coaching of Curly Neal.
Players have had little difficulty in trouncing
their conference opponents and one remarked that
"a lot of our problem is that our league is extremely
weak and we don't get good competition."
Another team member rated the program "good"
with the qualification that the six year old
conference "needs land is getting] reorganizing."
Appraisals of the Stanford program varied with
the players' backgrounds. Those with histories of
intensive, private coaching stated they could use
more rigorous help on strokes and strategy. Others
praised the overall "team" orientation of the
instruction.
Number one singles player Tracy Macnair and
four of her teammates mentioned increased funding
for travel and expenses as important program
strengths. "Stanford has, in the last three years,
changed its attitude a great deal. Three years ago we
had to pay to play Ojai, and this year the school
paid for everything, including plane fare," said
Macnair.
