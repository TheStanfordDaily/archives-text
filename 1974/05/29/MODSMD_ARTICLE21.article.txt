# Scholarship Program Confronts Obstacles
## 
### 
Both men and women receive
scholarships for academic pursuits and
men receive scholarships for athletics.
That leaves one category
unrepresented: women athletes. They
bring fans and attention and prestige
to Stanford so they deserve
scholarships.
—Kathy Levison,
varsity field hockey
I would rather see attention
focused on improving facilities and
coaching before worrying about
athletic scholarships for women.
Money is scarce these days and one has
to be sure that they focus on the
important things first. Women's
athletics are important, but there are a
lack of a lot of things that are more
important.

/ mainly turned pro because of the
large prize money available at Forest
Hills — money which could help [pay]
the cost of Stanford tuition. A
scholarship would have fulfilled the
same purpose and allowed me to be on
the team.

One woman wrote "all athletic
scholarships ought to be abolished,"
but 42 of 44 women on Stanford
varsity sports teams cast their votes in
favor of sports scholarships for
women. Only one athlete couldn't
decide — anguishing over recruiting
abuses — if the advantages outweighed
the hassle.
Thirteen non-competing athletes
were unanimous in their support of
awarding athletic scholarships to
women.
Title IX of the 1972 federal
education amendments, which

prohibits educational institutions
receiving federal aid from distributing
student benefits or opportunities on
the basis of sex and recent rulings by
the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare are compelling many
schools, Stanford among them, to
award athletic scholarships to women.
Seven months ago, women's
physical education department
chairman, Pamela Strathairn,
estimated that as many as eight or nine
such scholarships would be awarded
for the 1974-75 school year. This
prediction has been abandoned and no
new number has been determined. It is
doubtful that there will be any awards
for Stanford's freshman women in
1974.
Awarding scholarships merely on
the basis of talent would turn women's
athletics into the same sort of 'meat
market* that exists in men's
competition. Athletic scholarships
should be used to bring women with
special athletic talent (who are
academically qualified) to Stanford
who might not otherwise be able to
afford the school.
—a varsity basketball player
In order to build a good team you
need talent like Shirley Babashoff,
Vicki Hays, etc. Scholarships are
available for financial need through
other sources. It seems only right that
the best members receive the
scholarships.
There's a stereotype of women
athletes, especially swimmers, that
they peak young — the fact is there is
nothing to prompt them to continue
swimming past high school.
—Nan Leuschel, varsity swimming
An athletic scholarship, says WPE
chairman Strathairn, "is a monetary
grant or the equivalent for a maximum
of tuition, room and board and fees
awarded a student on the basis of
athletic talent."
Dean of admissions, Fred
Hargadon, defines it as "An award
based on athletic ability, as
determined by the appropriate
coaches. The award may be
coincidental with financial need, but is
not a need-based award. It is an
ability-based award, regardless of
whether the recipient has financial
need."
Does this mean women's athletic
scholarships will be awarded on the
basis of talent alone? No, not
necessarily. Eligibility requirements
for the women's athletic scholarships
are "still being determined by a
committee comprised of the chief
administrators of MPE, WPE,
admissions, financial aids and
representatives of the president and
provost," according to Strathairn.
Need Required
The Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AIAW), which
will establish the external guidelines
for Stanford's athletic scholarships for
women, currently requires female
scholarship recipients to show
financial need. The National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA),
governing men's scholarship policies,
has no such stipulation. Title IX will
probably force some rule continuities
between the organizations, establishing
'need' as a criteria for neither or both.
Team members and athletes not
currently competing were almost
unanimous in their desire for women's
athletic scholarships. Both groups
divided exactly two to one in favor of
awarding scholarships on the basis of
need as well as talent.
Twenty-six players and eight
non-competing respondents felt
financial need was essential. Half those
numbers believed athletic prowess
ought to be rewarded outright.
One athlete stipulated that the
women's scholarships be awarded by
the same criteria used by the men,
whatever they may be.
Financing
Regardless of the number,
nature and date of award, the women's
scholarships will have to be financed.
The Buck Club, a group of alumni
and friends of the University, supplies
MPE with money for its athletic
scholarships.
Founded in 1934, the Club
contributed $483,000 in 1971-72. The
same year, the MPE scholarship fund
received a $75,000 income from
endowed and expendable awards given
in memory of the deceased.
Ruetz, Hargadon and Strathairn
believe there is support for a women's
equivalent of the Buck Club among
alumni and friends of the University.
Second Buck Club?
Strathairn admits the women's
scholarships will probably be funded
through gift money, but she has
reservations about developing a WPE
counterpart to the Buck Club.
"Without additional staff time and
know-how in fund-raising by a special
interest group, the endeavor would
pull current personnel from their
current tasks which cover the total
athletic, instruction, recreation
programs," she said.
A small amount of money has
already been donated and set aside for
women's athletic scholarships, but no
satisfactory, long-range mechanism for
tapping fund sources has been found.
Women's athletic scholarships remain
in financial need.
