Bumpers Bumps Out Fulbright
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Arkansas Gov. Dale
Bumpers, a rising star in Democratic politics, won
nomination to the U.S. Senate last night, ending the
30-year career of Sen. J.W. Fulbright, one of the
nation's powers in the formulation of foreign
policy.
Fulbright had been chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee since 1959 and was a
leading critic of U.S. involvement and policy in the
Vietnam war.
Bumpers had campaigned on a call for new
leadership to deal with problems in Washington.
Banker John Harris Jones of Pine Bluff was
slated to oppose Bumpers as the GOP candidate in
November, but traditionally the Democratic
nomination has been tantamount to election.
With 1,038 of Arkansas' 2,688 precincts
reporting. Bumpers had 108,428 votes, or 63
percent, and Fulbright 62,468 or 37 percent.
In other elections, Kentucky Gov. Wendell Ford,
another emerging national Democratic personality,
easily won the party's nomination to challenge Sen.
Marlow Cook, who took the GOP nomination with
no difficulty.
In Oregon, former U.S. Sen. Wayne Morse won a
four-way primary race for the Democratic senatorial
nomination. Morse's chief opponent was State
Senate President Jason Boe.
Israel, Syria "Reach Agreement 9
JERUSALEM — Henry A. Kissinger flew here
from his latest round of talks with Syrian President
Hafez Assad early today, and after meeting with
government leaders, an Israeli official indicated that
a disengagement agreement in principle had been
reached.
When Information Minister Shimon Peres was
asked by newsmen if a settlement separating Syrian
and Israeli armies in the Golan Heights would be
announced later in the day, he replied: "In very
general terms, yes."
Just after Kissinger concluded his talks with
Assad, a senior American official said chances for a
settlement were good and that now "it depends on
the Israelis."
The American secretary of state was in a buoyant
mood as he shuttled back to Israel after midnight
for talks with Premier Golda Meir and the Israeli
negotiating team. The Israeli Cabinet is to meet this
morning.
American officials advised newsmen on the flight
back to Israel not to "go all the way on the positive
side." But the atmosphere aboard the plane
indicated Kissinger might be on the verge of
accomplishing the long-sought accord to end the
war of attrition between Israel and Syria.
Coalition Collapses In Ulster
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Northern
Ireland's coalition government of moderate
Protestants and Roman Catholics collapsed
yesterday, toppled by a two-week-old strike of

Protestant militants who vowed to press on with
their walkout.
Power supplies were due to be cut off completely
by the strike and virtually all other essential services
halted. British army and navy technicians were
ready to move in to take over power stations to
avert a blackout.
British officials called it Northern Ireland's worst
crisis in its 50-year history.
Within hours of bringing down Brian Faulkner's
provincial administration, the strikers announced
they wanted Prime Minister Harold Wilson's British
government to negotiate with them and call new
elections.
They also sought to force London into scrapping
an agreement signed with the Irish republic last
December to improve formal links between the
mainly Protestant province and the predominantly
Catholic republic. The militants believe the accord is
the first step toward an eventual union in which
their religion would be swallowed up.
The Belfast coalition's six-month rule ended
when chief executive Faulkner and his moderate
Protestant faction resigned because the British
government refused last-minute pleas to negotiate
with the strikers before the shutdown ruined the
province, insiders said.
Catholic ministers did not resign but were unable
to continue without the Protestants.
It was a major victory for the hardliners and their
paramilitary forces who claimed the coalition of
Protestants and Catholics did not represent the
majority of Northern Ireland's IIAl l A million people.
SLA Letters Examined
LOS ANGELES — Investigators examined two
letters bearing the seven-headed cobra symbol of the
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) yesterday as
the search for Patricia Hearst and two SLA members
continued in Southern California.
The identical letters, which expressed support for
the "revolution" in somewhat lyrical prose, were
received by the Pasadena Star-News and radio
station KROQ-FM.
The message on the pages was signed "Pablo
Neruda, SLA support unit number three," police
said. Neruda, a Nobel Prize-winning Chilean poet
who supported the leftist government of the late
Salvadore Allende, died last year.
The letters, written in red ink, read:
"Footsteps shuffling a thousand years in this
square will not rub off the trace of your blood from
these stones. Oh fallen brothers and sisters, out of
the silence your voices will rise in the mighty shout
of freedom when the hope of the people flames into
pangs of joy."
Six SLA members were killed 11 days ago here
when police attacked a house they were using as a
hideout.
A police spokesman did not say that the
messages definitely had been authenticated as being
from the SLA.
Meanwhile, the FBI said its search for Patricia,
the 20-year-old newspaper heiress who has claimed

allegiance to her SLA captors, and William and
Emily Harris was still concentrated in Southern
California. The three are wanted on state felony
charges, including robbery, assault and kidnaping.
Rodino: May Release Evidence
WASHINGTON — Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr.
of the House Judiciary Committee said yesterday
the panel will consider tomorrow whether to release
some of the evidence received in its impeachment
inquiry.
The New Jersey Democrat said release of the
evidence, presented by the impeachment staff in
closed sessions, will be one of four items on
tomorrow's agenda. The others will be President
Nixon's refusal to obey committee subpoenas,
issuance of additional subpoenas and opening future
evidentiary sessions to the public.
Rodino released the agenda after committee
Democrats caucused behind closed doors.
The Democrats met shortly after a Republican
caucus at which members voiced support for
additional subpoenas and opposition to releasing
evidence received so far.
Rodino indicated that at least some of the
evidence will be released, probably excluding
materia] received from a federal grand jury.
Asked whether the release might prejudice
Watergate cases now pending Rodino replied, "I
believe we have a deep concern for matters that are
going to be tried .. . but we have to consider the
overriding public interest in making this material
public."

Mary Tyler Moore Show and Barbra Streisand And
Other Musical Instruments.

Israel, Syria "Reach Agreement 9
JERUSALEM — Henry A. Kissinger flew here
from his latest round of talks with Syrian President
Hafez Assad early today, and after meeting with
government leaders, an Israeli official indicated that
a disengagement agreement in principle had been
reached.
When Information Minister Shimon Peres was
asked by newsmen if a settlement separating Syrian
and Israeli armies in the Golan Heights would be
announced later in the day, he replied: "In very
general terms, yes."
Just after Kissinger concluded his talks with
Assad, a senior American official said chances for a
settlement were good and that now "it depends on
the Israelis."
The American secretary of state was in a buoyant
mood as he shuttled back to Israel after midnight
for talks with Premier Golda Meir and the Israeli
negotiating team. The Israeli Cabinet is to meet this
morning.
American officials advised newsmen on the flight
back to Israel not to "go all the way on the positive
side." But the atmosphere aboard the plane
indicated Kissinger might be on the verge of
accomplishing the long-sought accord to end the
war of attrition between Israel and Syria.
Coalition Collapses In Ulster
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Northern
Ireland's coalition government of moderate
Protestants and Roman Catholics collapsed
yesterday, toppled by a two-week-old strike of

Protestant militants who vowed to press on with
their walkout.
Power supplies were due to be cut off completely
by the strike and virtually all other essential services
halted. British army and navy technicians were
ready to move in to take over power stations to
avert a blackout.
British officials called it Northern Ireland's worst
crisis in its 50-year history.
Within hours of bringing down Brian Faulkner's
provincial administration, the strikers announced
they wanted Prime Minister Harold Wilson's British
government to negotiate with them and call new
elections.
They also sought to force London into scrapping
an agreement signed with the Irish republic last
December to improve formal links between the
mainly Protestant province and the predominantly
Catholic republic. The militants believe the accord is
the first step toward an eventual union in which
their religion would be swallowed up.
The Belfast coalition's six-month rule ended
when chief executive Faulkner and his moderate
Protestant faction resigned because the British
government refused last-minute pleas to negotiate
with the strikers before the shutdown ruined the
province, insiders said.
Catholic ministers did not resign but were unable
to continue without the Protestants.
It was a major victory for the hardliners and their
paramilitary forces who claimed the coalition of
Protestants and Catholics did not represent the
majority of Northern Ireland's IIAl l A million people.
SLA Letters Examined
LOS ANGELES — Investigators examined two
letters bearing the seven-headed cobra symbol of the
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) yesterday as
the search for Patricia Hearst and two SLA members
continued in Southern California.
The identical letters, which expressed support for
the "revolution" in somewhat lyrical prose, were
received by the Pasadena Star-News and radio
station KROQ-FM.
The message on the pages was signed "Pablo
Neruda, SLA support unit number three," police
said. Neruda, a Nobel Prize-winning Chilean poet
who supported the leftist government of the late
Salvadore Allende, died last year.
The letters, written in red ink, read:
"Footsteps shuffling a thousand years in this
square will not rub off the trace of your blood from
these stones. Oh fallen brothers and sisters, out of
the silence your voices will rise in the mighty shout
of freedom when the hope of the people flames into
pangs of joy."
Six SLA members were killed 11 days ago here
when police attacked a house they were using as a
hideout.
A police spokesman did not say that the
messages definitely had been authenticated as being
from the SLA.
Meanwhile, the FBI said its search for Patricia,
the 20-year-old newspaper heiress who has claimed

allegiance to her SLA captors, and William and
Emily Harris was still concentrated in Southern
California. The three are wanted on state felony
charges, including robbery, assault and kidnaping.
Rodino: May Release Evidence
WASHINGTON — Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr.
of the House Judiciary Committee said yesterday
the panel will consider tomorrow whether to release
some of the evidence received in its impeachment
inquiry.
The New Jersey Democrat said release of the
evidence, presented by the impeachment staff in
closed sessions, will be one of four items on
tomorrow's agenda. The others will be President
Nixon's refusal to obey committee subpoenas,
issuance of additional subpoenas and opening future
evidentiary sessions to the public.
Rodino released the agenda after committee
Democrats caucused behind closed doors.
The Democrats met shortly after a Republican
caucus at which members voiced support for
additional subpoenas and opposition to releasing
evidence received so far.
Rodino indicated that at least some of the
evidence will be released, probably excluding
materia] received from a federal grand jury.
Asked whether the release might prejudice
Watergate cases now pending Rodino replied, "I
believe we have a deep concern for matters that are
going to be tried .. . but we have to consider the
overriding public interest in making this material
public."

Coalition Collapses In Ulster
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Northern
Ireland's coalition government of moderate
Protestants and Roman Catholics collapsed
yesterday, toppled by a two-week-old strike of

Protestant militants who vowed to press on with
their walkout.
Power supplies were due to be cut off completely
by the strike and virtually all other essential services
halted. British army and navy technicians were
ready to move in to take over power stations to
avert a blackout.
British officials called it Northern Ireland's worst
crisis in its 50-year history.
Within hours of bringing down Brian Faulkner's
provincial administration, the strikers announced
they wanted Prime Minister Harold Wilson's British
government to negotiate with them and call new
elections.
They also sought to force London into scrapping
an agreement signed with the Irish republic last
December to improve formal links between the
mainly Protestant province and the predominantly
Catholic republic. The militants believe the accord is
the first step toward an eventual union in which
their religion would be swallowed up.
The Belfast coalition's six-month rule ended
when chief executive Faulkner and his moderate
Protestant faction resigned because the British
government refused last-minute pleas to negotiate
with the strikers before the shutdown ruined the
province, insiders said.
Catholic ministers did not resign but were unable
to continue without the Protestants.
It was a major victory for the hardliners and their
paramilitary forces who claimed the coalition of
Protestants and Catholics did not represent the
majority of Northern Ireland's IIAl l A million people.
SLA Letters Examined
LOS ANGELES — Investigators examined two
letters bearing the seven-headed cobra symbol of the
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) yesterday as
the search for Patricia Hearst and two SLA members
continued in Southern California.
The identical letters, which expressed support for
the "revolution" in somewhat lyrical prose, were
received by the Pasadena Star-News and radio
station KROQ-FM.
The message on the pages was signed "Pablo
Neruda, SLA support unit number three," police
said. Neruda, a Nobel Prize-winning Chilean poet
who supported the leftist government of the late
Salvadore Allende, died last year.
The letters, written in red ink, read:
"Footsteps shuffling a thousand years in this
square will not rub off the trace of your blood from
these stones. Oh fallen brothers and sisters, out of
the silence your voices will rise in the mighty shout
of freedom when the hope of the people flames into
pangs of joy."
Six SLA members were killed 11 days ago here
when police attacked a house they were using as a
hideout.
A police spokesman did not say that the
messages definitely had been authenticated as being
from the SLA.
Meanwhile, the FBI said its search for Patricia,
the 20-year-old newspaper heiress who has claimed

allegiance to her SLA captors, and William and
Emily Harris was still concentrated in Southern
California. The three are wanted on state felony
charges, including robbery, assault and kidnaping.
Rodino: May Release Evidence
WASHINGTON — Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr.
of the House Judiciary Committee said yesterday
the panel will consider tomorrow whether to release
some of the evidence received in its impeachment
inquiry.
The New Jersey Democrat said release of the
evidence, presented by the impeachment staff in
closed sessions, will be one of four items on
tomorrow's agenda. The others will be President
Nixon's refusal to obey committee subpoenas,
issuance of additional subpoenas and opening future
evidentiary sessions to the public.
Rodino released the agenda after committee
Democrats caucused behind closed doors.
The Democrats met shortly after a Republican
caucus at which members voiced support for
additional subpoenas and opposition to releasing
evidence received so far.
Rodino indicated that at least some of the
evidence will be released, probably excluding
materia] received from a federal grand jury.
Asked whether the release might prejudice
Watergate cases now pending Rodino replied, "I
believe we have a deep concern for matters that are
going to be tried .. . but we have to consider the
overriding public interest in making this material
public."

Bumpers Bumps Out Fulbright
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Arkansas Gov. Dale
Bumpers, a rising star in Democratic politics, won
nomination to the U.S. Senate last night, ending the
30-year career of Sen. J.W. Fulbright, one of the
nation's powers in the formulation of foreign
policy.
Fulbright had been chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee since 1959 and was a
leading critic of U.S. involvement and policy in the
Vietnam war.
Bumpers had campaigned on a call for new
leadership to deal with problems in Washington.
Banker John Harris Jones of Pine Bluff was
slated to oppose Bumpers as the GOP candidate in
November, but traditionally the Democratic
nomination has been tantamount to election.
With 1,038 of Arkansas' 2,688 precincts
reporting. Bumpers had 108,428 votes, or 63
percent, and Fulbright 62,468 or 37 percent.
In other elections, Kentucky Gov. Wendell Ford,
another emerging national Democratic personality,
easily won the party's nomination to challenge Sen.
Marlow Cook, who took the GOP nomination with
no difficulty.
In Oregon, former U.S. Sen. Wayne Morse won a
four-way primary race for the Democratic senatorial
nomination. Morse's chief opponent was State
Senate President Jason Boe.
Israel, Syria "Reach Agreement 9
JERUSALEM — Henry A. Kissinger flew here
from his latest round of talks with Syrian President
Hafez Assad early today, and after meeting with
government leaders, an Israeli official indicated that
a disengagement agreement in principle had been
reached.
When Information Minister Shimon Peres was
asked by newsmen if a settlement separating Syrian
and Israeli armies in the Golan Heights would be
announced later in the day, he replied: "In very
general terms, yes."
Just after Kissinger concluded his talks with
Assad, a senior American official said chances for a
settlement were good and that now "it depends on
the Israelis."
The American secretary of state was in a buoyant
mood as he shuttled back to Israel after midnight
for talks with Premier Golda Meir and the Israeli
negotiating team. The Israeli Cabinet is to meet this
morning.
American officials advised newsmen on the flight
back to Israel not to "go all the way on the positive
side." But the atmosphere aboard the plane
indicated Kissinger might be on the verge of
accomplishing the long-sought accord to end the
war of attrition between Israel and Syria.

SLA Letters Examined
LOS ANGELES — Investigators examined two
letters bearing the seven-headed cobra symbol of the
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) yesterday as
the search for Patricia Hearst and two SLA members
continued in Southern California.
The identical letters, which expressed support for
the "revolution" in somewhat lyrical prose, were
received by the Pasadena Star-News and radio
station KROQ-FM.
The message on the pages was signed "Pablo
Neruda, SLA support unit number three," police
said. Neruda, a Nobel Prize-winning Chilean poet
who supported the leftist government of the late
Salvadore Allende, died last year.
The letters, written in red ink, read:
"Footsteps shuffling a thousand years in this
square will not rub off the trace of your blood from
these stones. Oh fallen brothers and sisters, out of
the silence your voices will rise in the mighty shout
of freedom when the hope of the people flames into
pangs of joy."
Six SLA members were killed 11 days ago here
when police attacked a house they were using as a
hideout.
A police spokesman did not say that the
messages definitely had been authenticated as being
from the SLA.
Meanwhile, the FBI said its search for Patricia,
the 20-year-old newspaper heiress who has claimed

allegiance to her SLA captors, and William and
Emily Harris was still concentrated in Southern
California. The three are wanted on state felony
charges, including robbery, assault and kidnaping.
Rodino: May Release Evidence
WASHINGTON — Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr.
of the House Judiciary Committee said yesterday
the panel will consider tomorrow whether to release
some of the evidence received in its impeachment
inquiry.
The New Jersey Democrat said release of the
evidence, presented by the impeachment staff in
closed sessions, will be one of four items on
tomorrow's agenda. The others will be President
Nixon's refusal to obey committee subpoenas,
issuance of additional subpoenas and opening future
evidentiary sessions to the public.
Rodino released the agenda after committee
Democrats caucused behind closed doors.
The Democrats met shortly after a Republican
caucus at which members voiced support for
additional subpoenas and opposition to releasing
evidence received so far.
Rodino indicated that at least some of the
evidence will be released, probably excluding
materia] received from a federal grand jury.
Asked whether the release might prejudice
Watergate cases now pending Rodino replied, "I
believe we have a deep concern for matters that are
going to be tried .. . but we have to consider the
overriding public interest in making this material
public."

Bumpers Bumps Out Fulbright
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Arkansas Gov. Dale
Bumpers, a rising star in Democratic politics, won
nomination to the U.S. Senate last night, ending the
30-year career of Sen. J.W. Fulbright, one of the
nation's powers in the formulation of foreign
policy.
Fulbright had been chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee since 1959 and was a
leading critic of U.S. involvement and policy in the
Vietnam war.
Bumpers had campaigned on a call for new
leadership to deal with problems in Washington.
Banker John Harris Jones of Pine Bluff was
slated to oppose Bumpers as the GOP candidate in
November, but traditionally the Democratic
nomination has been tantamount to election.
With 1,038 of Arkansas' 2,688 precincts
reporting. Bumpers had 108,428 votes, or 63
percent, and Fulbright 62,468 or 37 percent.
In other elections, Kentucky Gov. Wendell Ford,
another emerging national Democratic personality,
easily won the party's nomination to challenge Sen.
Marlow Cook, who took the GOP nomination with
no difficulty.
In Oregon, former U.S. Sen. Wayne Morse won a
four-way primary race for the Democratic senatorial
nomination. Morse's chief opponent was State
Senate President Jason Boe.
Israel, Syria "Reach Agreement 9
JERUSALEM — Henry A. Kissinger flew here
from his latest round of talks with Syrian President
Hafez Assad early today, and after meeting with
government leaders, an Israeli official indicated that
a disengagement agreement in principle had been
reached.
When Information Minister Shimon Peres was
asked by newsmen if a settlement separating Syrian
and Israeli armies in the Golan Heights would be
announced later in the day, he replied: "In very
general terms, yes."
Just after Kissinger concluded his talks with
Assad, a senior American official said chances for a
settlement were good and that now "it depends on
the Israelis."
The American secretary of state was in a buoyant
mood as he shuttled back to Israel after midnight
for talks with Premier Golda Meir and the Israeli
negotiating team. The Israeli Cabinet is to meet this
morning.
American officials advised newsmen on the flight
back to Israel not to "go all the way on the positive
side." But the atmosphere aboard the plane
indicated Kissinger might be on the verge of
accomplishing the long-sought accord to end the
war of attrition between Israel and Syria.
Coalition Collapses In Ulster
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Northern
Ireland's coalition government of moderate
Protestants and Roman Catholics collapsed
yesterday, toppled by a two-week-old strike of

Protestant militants who vowed to press on with
their walkout.
Power supplies were due to be cut off completely
by the strike and virtually all other essential services
halted. British army and navy technicians were
ready to move in to take over power stations to
avert a blackout.
British officials called it Northern Ireland's worst
crisis in its 50-year history.
Within hours of bringing down Brian Faulkner's
provincial administration, the strikers announced
they wanted Prime Minister Harold Wilson's British
government to negotiate with them and call new
elections.
They also sought to force London into scrapping
an agreement signed with the Irish republic last
December to improve formal links between the
mainly Protestant province and the predominantly
Catholic republic. The militants believe the accord is
the first step toward an eventual union in which
their religion would be swallowed up.
The Belfast coalition's six-month rule ended
when chief executive Faulkner and his moderate
Protestant faction resigned because the British
government refused last-minute pleas to negotiate
with the strikers before the shutdown ruined the
province, insiders said.
Catholic ministers did not resign but were unable
to continue without the Protestants.
It was a major victory for the hardliners and their
paramilitary forces who claimed the coalition of
Protestants and Catholics did not represent the
majority of Northern Ireland's IIAl l A million people.
