# Robinson-New Daily Ace
## 
### 
Dave Robinson, 21, a junior
Communication major, was elected
editor of Volume 166 of the Daily
yesterday.
Robinson, from University Mo., is a
veteran staffer on the paper. He served
as sports editor from February, 1973,
to March, 1974, and has been a night
editor and copy editor for the last two
months.
Robinson said last night, "I hope
the Daily can not only inform its
readers but entertain its readers better
than it has in the past." He said he
hoped to introduce a new page that
would increase features in the paper,
and that he wants to see other
departments in the paper "more
efficiently run."
The Daily, he said, hould be "as
professional as possible," while
retaining a capacity to experiment and
innovate. He also said he would
encourage the addition of more regular
columnists.
Robinson will assume the dual
posts of editor and president of the
Stanford Daily Publishing Corp. — the
independent non profit company that
publishes the paper — starting in
September. News Editor Bruce
Kadden, 19, a Religious Studies major
from Oakland, has been appointed
editor of the Summer Daily.
