# Strike Supporter Scales Crane; 25 Protest At President's House
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
A man carrying a United Stanford
Employees (USE) union picket sign
perched on the tip of the large crane
parked at the Medical Center
construction site for almost 2Vi hours
early yesterday.
The man, later identified as Paul A.
Galle, 43, a solid state engineer at
Hansen Laboratories, lashed himself to
the crane's boom — more than 160
feet in the sky.
Palo Alto police lowered the boom
and arrested Galle for trespassing and
violating a Santa Clara Superior Court
injunction restraining picketing
activity. Galle was held in custody
briefly, then released.
Student Demonstration
About 25 student members of the
Chicano Workers Support Committee
demonstrated peacefully in front and
in back of President Richard Lyman's
house last night. They left after police
arrived.
In another strike development, USE
President Jim Berk and University
negotiator Douglas Barton issued a
joint statement announcing that
further daily progress reports on the
negotiations will be issued only as
joint statements.
Berk and Barton announced, "In
view of improved developments in
negotiations towards settlement of the
strike at Stanford, both parties agree
that daily progress will not be reported
in print or released to the press, except
in the form of a joint statement."
Both sides met in a secret
negotiating session again yesterday,
but issued no release and refused
comment.
Contempt Charges
Galle, who will face criminal
contempt charges in court June 11 for
his crane climb, charged the University
administration with harrassment and
intimidation of USE pickets.
Quoted in a USE press release, he
said, "The administration has still not
issued strong enough 'nstructioT- to
the scab drivers that they must come
to a full stop when approaching our
pickets."
He told the Daily that he climbed
the crane of his own accord, carrying
napkins and toilet tissue to wipe off
grease on his route along the boom.
"It could have been a matter of life or
death," he said.
Protest Center
The crane has been the center of
protests at the Medical Center since
last week. It was successfully moved
back into the construction site last
Friday.
Two USE members claimed they
were hit by the crane as it was driven
into the site.
Chicano student demonstrators
chanted and yelled at Lyman's house
for about 15 minutes last night. The
25 left when two Stanford police and
one Santa Clara County sheriff's cars
arrived.
Lyman did not address the
demonstrators, some of whom were
chanting "huelga," "workers si,

Lyman no" and "impeach Lyman."
'No Problem'
Lyman came out only as the
students were leaving, reassuring
police, "There's no problem — just
some people yelling at me. It's nothing
to worry about."
Minor incidents of vandalism again
plagued University vehicles, an
Operations Center spokesman said.
A number of trucks suffered flat
tires and paint had been thrown at a

few delivery vehicles, he said. A
tractor which pulls University lawn
mowers was also reported stolen, but
was later found.
Sewer Problems
Sewer problems lessened yesterday,
but "the Roto-Rooter man is still on
campus," according to the spokesman.
A group of faculty, concerned with
strike issues, has organized a teach-in
panel discussion for Thursday at 8
p.m. in Bishop Auditorium. Berk and

Vice Provost William Massy will be
the featured speakers.
Other panelists include French
Prof. Raymond Giraud, Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Spicer and
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall, who will serve as moderator.

Lyman did not address the
demonstrators, some of whom were
chanting "huelga," "workers si,

Lyman no" and "impeach Lyman."
'No Problem'
Lyman came out only as the
students were leaving, reassuring
police, "There's no problem — just
some people yelling at me. It's nothing
to worry about."
Minor incidents of vandalism again
plagued University vehicles, an
Operations Center spokesman said.
A number of trucks suffered flat
tires and paint had been thrown at a

few delivery vehicles, he said. A
tractor which pulls University lawn
mowers was also reported stolen, but
was later found.
Sewer Problems
Sewer problems lessened yesterday,
but "the Roto-Rooter man is still on
campus," according to the spokesman.
A group of faculty, concerned with
strike issues, has organized a teach-in
panel discussion for Thursday at 8
p.m. in Bishop Auditorium. Berk and

Vice Provost William Massy will be
the featured speakers.
Other panelists include French
Prof. Raymond Giraud, Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Spicer and
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall, who will serve as moderator.
Other reporters who contributed to
this story were Don Cox, Viae
Kershner, Bonita B. Rodden and David
Thiemann.
A man carrying a United Stanford
Employees (USE) union picket sign
perched on the tip of the large crane
parked at the Medical Center
construction site for almost 2Vi hours
early yesterday.
The man, later identified as Paul A.
Galle, 43, a solid state engineer at
Hansen Laboratories, lashed himself to
the crane's boom — more than 160
feet in the sky.
Palo Alto police lowered the boom
and arrested Galle for trespassing and
violating a Santa Clara Superior Court
injunction restraining picketing
activity. Galle was held in custody
briefly, then released.
Student Demonstration
About 25 student members of the
Chicano Workers Support Committee
demonstrated peacefully in front and
in back of President Richard Lyman's
house last night. They left after police
arrived.
In another strike development, USE
President Jim Berk and University
negotiator Douglas Barton issued a
joint statement announcing that
further daily progress reports on the
negotiations will be issued only as
joint statements.
Berk and Barton announced, "In
view of improved developments in
negotiations towards settlement of the
strike at Stanford, both parties agree
that daily progress will not be reported
in print or released to the press, except
in the form of a joint statement."
Both sides met in a secret
negotiating session again yesterday,
but issued no release and refused
comment.
Contempt Charges
Galle, who will face criminal
contempt charges in court June 11 for
his crane climb, charged the University
administration with harrassment and
intimidation of USE pickets.
Quoted in a USE press release, he
said, "The administration has still not
issued strong enough 'nstructioT- to
the scab drivers that they must come
to a full stop when approaching our
pickets."
He told the Daily that he climbed
the crane of his own accord, carrying
napkins and toilet tissue to wipe off
grease on his route along the boom.
"It could have been a matter of life or
death," he said.
Protest Center
The crane has been the center of
protests at the Medical Center since
last week. It was successfully moved
back into the construction site last
Friday.
Two USE members claimed they
were hit by the crane as it was driven
into the site.
Chicano student demonstrators
chanted and yelled at Lyman's house
for about 15 minutes last night. The
25 left when two Stanford police and
one Santa Clara County sheriff's cars
arrived.
Lyman did not address the
demonstrators, some of whom were
chanting "huelga," "workers si,

Lyman no" and "impeach Lyman."
