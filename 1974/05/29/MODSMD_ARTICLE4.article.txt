# Life On The Picket Line: Varied
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) union pickets posted in various
locations around the campus have one
thing in common: they are striking for
more pay and benefits. However, there
are as many different ways of passing
the time while picketing as there are
pickets.
Some pickets spend much of their
time talking to students and other
passers-by. Others see only a few
students each day, and primarily
watch cars and trucks drive by.
A biology life sciences technician
picketing the Stanford Press and
Reprographics building on Panama St.
told the Daily she speaks to students
frequently. "Some are in favor [of the
strike], some are not," she said.
"Some come up and talk, and I try to
tell them my own point of view."
One of the pickets at the
McCullough Building said his contact
with students was mostly with friends
who were sympathetic to the strike
demands, although a few others have
stopped to talk about the strike.
Asked if he had changed anyone's
mind on the issue, he replied "not
really."
The picket captain at the Medical
Center construction site told of some
contact with medical personnel and
tludents, with reactions varying from
support to indifference to outright
hostility.
Deliver Food
Another union member, who was
delivering sandwiches and coffee to
the pickets, said that on his picketing

shifts "everybody that I talk to
sympathizes with the strikers." But he
added that "people who are against
the strike don't come out to talk to
us."
Other contacts come with truck
drivers making deliveries, supervisors
doing strikers' jobs and private
security guards or "rent-a-cops," he
said.
Pickets involved with delivery
trucks said that most Teamster drivers
have been honoring the picket lines. A
computer technician told of an
exception whom he encountered at
the Medical Center: "I never actually
saw it, but [the driver] said he had a
.38 and he was going to kill anyone
who tried to get on his truck."
Not Stopped
According to the Medical Center
picket captain, trucks driven by small
independent firms and non-union
University employees are not stopped,
but are "slowed" by pickets walking
slowly in front of them. He said the
situation at the Medical Center loading
dock, which had been tense during the
first week or so of the strike, had
"stabilized."
Pickets at the entrance to Plant
Services and University Stores talked
about seeing their supervisors driving
trucks and doing other jobs. One
supervisor, they said, got a flat tire,
told them it would be easy to fix, and
spent 45 minutes changing it.
Relations with the police and
security guards have been friendly, all
of the pickets agreed. "The police have
been really mellow," said one picket at

the Stores, "and the rent-a-cops —
they're getting paid less than we are,
so they sympathize."
In some cases, a single picket has a
night shift, and the picket and the
local "rent-a-cop" keep each other
company, according to the USE
member who delivered sandwiches to
the Medical Center pickets. He added
that the union sometimes feeds both.
Other pickets reported having long
discussions with the police on the
strike and other topics.
Reactions Vary
The pickets have widely varying
feelings about the financial aspects of
the strike and about their fellow
workers who are not striking.
Many of the pickets said that the
loss of pay was a real inconvenience,
and that without a settlement fairly
soon they would be forced to look for
another job. Some are working on
temporary part-time or full-time jobs.
One striking keypunch operator is
working full-time and picketing four
hours a day.
Other strikers are living on savings
or on their spouse's income. One
picket said he and his wife were
"getting by" on her salary, "but not
eating anything fancy." He said he has
been "optimistic from the beginning,"
and recognizes that "there are others
out here a whole lot worse off than
me.
Solidarity
The question of fellow workers and
the strike brings out talk of solidarity
of the union, self-respect and respect
