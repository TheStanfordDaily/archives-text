## Waldie Sees Public 'Anger' 
### DAVID SMITH 
"Campaigning in the state this year
has shown me more anger and
disillusionment with politicians than
I've ever seen before," Rep. Jerome
Waldie, D-Antioch and candidate for
governor, told a crowd of 350 in White
Plaza yesterday noon.
"The reason for this disillusionment
is that traditional politicians won't
speak out for those who require their
help," Waldie stated. He said campaign
contributions from powerful
special-interest groups helped make
politicians tools of those groups.
"Of the hundreds of people I talked
to about the oil crisis, there wasn't one
who didn't believe it was purely a
contrived crisis by the oil companies.
Yet the federal government refused to
act," he said.
"This is surprising until you realize
that the oil companies gave $5.3
million to elect the president, and that
this is a tiny figure compared to the
companies' contributions to the total
political system," he continued. 'The
oil corporations' grasp on the
economy is dependent on their grasp
on the political structure."

Waldie spoke out strongly in favor
of Proposition 9, the election-reform
measure on the June ballot. "Passage
of this proposal is probably more
important than my being elected
governor," he said.
'No Cure-All'
"Prop. 9 is by no means a cure-all,"
he stated, "but in a year when four
Democratic candidates for governor
are each spending over a million
dollars on the primary, I think the
need to limit campaign spending has
never been clearer."
Waldie, who has represented his
Contra Costa district in Congress for
the past eight years, said he had
introduced a bill in the House calling
for a five-year moratorium on the
construction of nuclear power plants.
"I don't think we have answered
the question of safety, and I won't be
satisfied until it's evaluated by
someone other than the Atomic
Energy Commission," he stated.
Noting that he voted against the
measure allowing construction of the
Alaska pipeline, Waldie said, "I don't
think that an energy crisis in which I
don't even believe should cause us to

suddenly relax our environmental
standards."
The congressman said the power of
the governor to fight unemployment
in the state was relatively small.
"Unemployment is almost totally a
factor of a failing national economy,"
he noted.
"The government ought to be the
employer of last resort when the
private sector can't provide the jobs,"
he said. "The state can provide some
support, mostly in the form of
welfare, but the federal government
controls most of the funding."
Land Development
Waldie said he was reasonably
satisfied with the regulation of land
development along the California
coastline, where he said popular
decisions and not private plans have
set the pace.
"I think we should implement the
same type of rules in the deserts,
mountains and valleys of California, so
that they are not spoiled by the
decisions of a few profit-seekers," he
added.
Waldie, who has been listed in
fourth place among Democratic
candidates in recent polls, assessed his
election chances as "uphill, but
definitely there." He said he thought a
low voter turnout would provide him
the best chances of winning the
primary battle.
"If there's a small turnout, there
will be a greater percentage of activists
and liberals," the candidate noted.
"It's from those groups that my
greatest support comes."
25 To 30 Percent
He said he hopes to "squeak
through" with 25 to 30 percent of the
primary vote.
A member of the House Judiciary
Committee, Waldie said he was "quite
certain" that the committee would
vote on impeachment by the first
week in July, and that the House
would send the Articles of
Impeachment to the Senate in early
August.
"I think the committee now
realizes that the will of the President
to withhold evidence is total, and that
they had better be equally firm in
their desire to get the evidence," he
noted.
