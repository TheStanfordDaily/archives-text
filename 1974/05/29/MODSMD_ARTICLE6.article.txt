# On 'Brain Death'
##

Bruce Kadden

The trial that many observers
had predicted would define legal
death has ended without the
expectation being fulfilled.
Andrew Lyons was convicted
last Wednesday of voluntary
manslaughter charges stemming
from the shooting of Samuel
Mitchell Allen Jr., last Sept. 10.
Allen had been pronounced
dead at the Highland Hospital in
Oakland before physicians,
including Norman Shumway of
the Stanford Medical Center, had
removed his heart for a transplant.
Defense attorney John
Cruikshank had argued during the
trial that Allen died because the
doctors removed his heart, rather
than because of being shot.
Alameda County Deputy
District Attorney Albert W.
Meloling countered by calling
numerous witnesses to the stand,
including Shumway, who testified
that Allen was dead before his
heart was removed.
Brain Damage
But all the testimony about the
cause of death meant very little
when Alameda County Superior
Court Judge William J. Hayes
surprisingly told the eight-man,
four-woman jury that Allen died
of brain damage caused by a
gunshot wound.
In his instructions to the panel
before it decided the fate of
Lyons, Hayes said doctors were
correct in pronouncing Allen dead
when his brain ceased to function.
Doctors at Highland Hospital,
where Allen was taken, checked
his brain activity several times and
pronounced him dead after a third
electroencephalogram at 8 a.m. on
Sept. 12 showed no signs of life.
Controversial Issue
But no matter how certain
doctors were as to when Allen
died, the issue was assumed to be
quite controversial.
California has no specific legal
definition of death. Under the
California state code concerning
transplants, a physician must
declare a potential donor dead,
but the code doesn't establish the
criteria to be used. It seems, in
this light, that Hayes' instructions
to the jury were out of line.
"Cause of death of the victim

is not an issue of fact, but is a
matter of law," Hayes told the
jurors. If this was the case, why
did both attorneys spend most of
their time questioning witnesses
regarding Allen's apparent cause
of death?
Hayes further stated that "a
person may be pronounced dead
if based on usual and customary
standards of medical practice it is
determined that the person has
suffered an irreversible cessation
of brain function." Although this
may be the generally accepted
conception of death, there
appears to be no legal support for
such an argument.
Legal Precedent Set
After Hayes' instructions,
Cruikshank objected that the
judge was setting a legal precedent
by ruling on the question of brain
death versus heart death which is
not covered by California statute.
He said after the jury's verdict
that he would move for a new
trial and, failing that, would
appeal "primarily on the basis of
the brain-death instruction to the
jury by Judge Hayes."
One can only speculate as to
why Hayes chose to define death
for the jury, rather than let the
panel decide on the basis of
testimony. There is a good chance
this would have resulted in the
jury agreeing with Hayes in
finding that Allen was dead before
his heart was removed.
Conclusive Testimony
Certainly the testimony
delivered is quite conclusive that
the doctors had made every effort
to save Allen's life before
pronouncing him dead.
It seems that until California
law contains a specific passage
defining death, no judge can rule
on such a controversial situation.
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett,
R—Redwood City, has proposed a
bill that would define death in
such a way. His bill would
establish a legal concept known as
"brain death." This type of
legislation is sorely needed, but
until it is enacted, the jury, not
the judge should be allowed to
rule on such an issue.

electroencephalogram at 8 a.m. on
Sept. 12 showed no signs of life.
Controversial Issue
But no matter how certain
doctors were as to when Allen
died, the issue was assumed to be
quite controversial.
California has no specific legal
definition of death. Under the
California state code concerning
transplants, a physician must
declare a potential donor dead,
but the code doesn't establish the
criteria to be used. It seems, in
this light, that Hayes' instructions
to the jury were out of line.
"Cause of death of the victim

is not an issue of fact, but is a
matter of law," Hayes told the
jurors. If this was the case, why
did both attorneys spend most of
their time questioning witnesses
regarding Allen's apparent cause
of death?
Hayes further stated that "a
person may be pronounced dead
if based on usual and customary
standards of medical practice it is
determined that the person has
suffered an irreversible cessation
of brain function." Although this
may be the generally accepted
conception of death, there
appears to be no legal support for
such an argument.
Legal Precedent Set
After Hayes' instructions,
Cruikshank objected that the
judge was setting a legal precedent
by ruling on the question of brain
death versus heart death which is
not covered by California statute.
He said after the jury's verdict
that he would move for a new
trial and, failing that, would
appeal "primarily on the basis of
the brain-death instruction to the
jury by Judge Hayes."
One can only speculate as to
why Hayes chose to define death
for the jury, rather than let the
panel decide on the basis of
testimony. There is a good chance
this would have resulted in the
jury agreeing with Hayes in
finding that Allen was dead before
his heart was removed.
Conclusive Testimony
Certainly the testimony
delivered is quite conclusive that
the doctors had made every effort
to save Allen's life before
pronouncing him dead.
It seems that until California
law contains a specific passage
defining death, no judge can rule
on such a controversial situation.
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett,
R—Redwood City, has proposed a
bill that would define death in
such a way. His bill would
establish a legal concept known as
"brain death." This type of
legislation is sorely needed, but
until it is enacted, the jury, not
the judge should be allowed to
rule on such an issue.

The trial that many observers
had predicted would define legal
death has ended without the
expectation being fulfilled.
Andrew Lyons was convicted
last Wednesday of voluntary
manslaughter charges stemming
from the shooting of Samuel
Mitchell Allen Jr., last Sept. 10.
Allen had been pronounced
dead at the Highland Hospital in
Oakland before physicians,
including Norman Shumway of
the Stanford Medical Center, had
removed his heart for a transplant.
Defense attorney John
Cruikshank had argued during the
trial that Allen died because the
doctors removed his heart, rather
than because of being shot.
Alameda County Deputy
District Attorney Albert W.
Meloling countered by calling
numerous witnesses to the stand,
including Shumway, who testified
that Allen was dead before his
heart was removed.
Brain Damage
But all the testimony about the
cause of death meant very little
when Alameda County Superior
Court Judge William J. Hayes
surprisingly told the eight-man,
four-woman jury that Allen died
of brain damage caused by a
gunshot wound.
In his instructions to the panel
before it decided the fate of
Lyons, Hayes said doctors were
correct in pronouncing Allen dead
when his brain ceased to function.
Doctors at Highland Hospital,
where Allen was taken, checked
his brain activity several times and
pronounced him dead after a third
electroencephalogram at 8 a.m. on
Sept. 12 showed no signs of life.
