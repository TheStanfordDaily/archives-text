# Ethics In Science

Can a legal decision be
scientifically sound and morally
repugnant? This question arises as
a result of a recent court decision
which re-defines death in such a
way so as to facilitate the
transplanting of human hearts
(Daily, May 22).
Stanford's Norman Shumway
argued that a person is (or should
be) considered "dead" when his
brain ceases to function, even
though his heart is still operating.
This definition may make sense
scientifically, but it raises certain
moral and ethical issues which
have not been dealt with either by
the courts or the scientific
community.
These issues are complicated
by the fact that the victim
concerned in the court case was
black, while the people
responsible for the removal of his
heart were white. So, once again,
racial issues are introduced into
what are seemingly "objective"
scientific questions.
Regardless of whether one is
talking about the genetic basis of
human intelligence, the prevalence
of genetic "diseases," population
control, drug addiction, or heart
transplants, one cannot avoid
consideration of the racial
implications of contemporary
scientific research. This is because
non-whites are often the victims,
rather than the benefactors, of

such research.
The racial issue becomes much
easier to deal with, however, when
we stop to consider the fact that
non-whites are, after all, human
beings and thus any issue which
concerns them can be, and
perhaps should be, discussed at
the level of ethics and morality,
rather than skin color.
This being the case, it seems
incumbent upon the Stanford
academic community to reflect on
where its science is taking them,
how much the trip is likely to cost
(both in terms of dollars and
destruction of human spirit) and
whether — all things considered —
the trip is desired and worth the
expense.
No one can argue against
medical advances which prolong
human life; nor can we argue
against the need for improved
quality in human life.
What can and must be argued
against, however, is whether those
who have abrogated to themselves
the right to make critical decisions
in these areas are, in the final
analysis, those who have enough
wisdom to insure that the
ultimate consequences of their
decisions are in accord with the
values of civilized society.

The racial issue becomes much
easier to deal with, however, when
we stop to consider the fact that
non-whites are, after all, human
beings and thus any issue which
concerns them can be, and
perhaps should be, discussed at
the level of ethics and morality,
rather than skin color.
This being the case, it seems
incumbent upon the Stanford
academic community to reflect on
where its science is taking them,
how much the trip is likely to cost
(both in terms of dollars and
destruction of human spirit) and
whether — all things considered —
the trip is desired and worth the
expense.
No one can argue against
medical advances which prolong
human life; nor can we argue
against the need for improved
quality in human life.
What can and must be argued
against, however, is whether those
who have abrogated to themselves
the right to make critical decisions
in these areas are, in the final
analysis, those who have enough
wisdom to insure that the
ultimate consequences of their
decisions are in accord with the
values of civilized society.
