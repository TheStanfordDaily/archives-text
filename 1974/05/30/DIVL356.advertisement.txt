RESOLUTION OF Till; COUNCIL OF Till; CITY OF PALO ALTO
URGING DEFEAT OF MEASURE R ON THE JUNE 4, 1974,
BALLOT AMENDING THE CHARTER OF THE CITY OF PALO ALTO
TO PROVIDE FOR RENT CONTROL
WHEREAS, Measure B on the June 4, 1974 ballot would amend the
Charter of the City of Palo Alto and establish residential rent
control within the City limits; and,
WHEREAS, whenever local rent control has been tested, in such
cities as Cambridge, Massachusetts, it has failed to produce the
desired results and has. instead reduced the rental housing supply;
and,
WHEREAS, federal rent control was in effect between August
1971 and January 10, 1973 and this proposition would reduce
rentals to the level of January 1, 1973; therefore this
proposition would force most rentals in the City back to the level
of three years ago; and,
WHEREAS, this proposition would require thousands of individual
hearings before the Rent Control Board before rents adjusted for the
recent inflation could be established throughout the City, and would
discourage, if not make impossible, future fair and timely rent
adjustments; and,
WHEREAS, these effects of Measure B would put severe economic
pressure on owners (including many elderly owners with low and
moderate incomes), encouraging many of them to:
1. sell their homes to home buyers, and evict the
tenants,
2. sell their older structures for demolition,
3. stop renting extra rooms to students,
4. favor commercial development over rental housing
development, and,
5. convert apartment rental units to condominiums; and,
WHEREAS, increased demand, for fewer and fewer housing units,
would make it harder and harder for people of moderate means to find
housing in Palo Alto; and,
WHEREAS, economic pressure on owners would also result in
undermaintenance and eventual deterioration of many homes and other
rental properties throughout Palo Alto; and,
WHEREAS, a similar proposition in Berkeley has been ruled
unconstitutional; and,
WHEREAS, this proposition would cause substantial increase in
City expenses to operate a complex rent control system at an estimated
minimum cost of $150,000 per year, and also to defend it in the courts,
with no assurance of success;
NOW, THEREFORE, the Council of the City of Palo Alto does
resolve that it urges all citizens of the City of Palo Alto to vote
AGAINST Measure B on the June 4, 1974 election ballot.

would make it harder and harder for people of moderate means to find
housing in Palo Alto; and,
WHEREAS, economic pressure on owners would also result in
undermaintenance and eventual deterioration of many homes and other
rental properties throughout Palo Alto; and,
WHEREAS, a similar proposition in Berkeley has been ruled
unconstitutional; and,
WHEREAS, this proposition would cause substantial increase in
City expenses to operate a complex rent control system at an estimated
minimum cost of $150,000 per year, and also to defend it in the courts,
with no assurance of success;
NOW, THEREFORE, the Council of the City of Palo Alto does
resolve that it urges all citizens of the City of Palo Alto to vote
AGAINST Measure B on the June 4, 1974 election ballot.

RESOLUTION OF Till; COUNCIL OF Till; CITY OF PALO ALTO
URGING DEFEAT OF MEASURE R ON THE JUNE 4, 1974,
BALLOT AMENDING THE CHARTER OF THE CITY OF PALO ALTO
TO PROVIDE FOR RENT CONTROL
WHEREAS, Measure B on the June 4, 1974 ballot would amend the
Charter of the City of Palo Alto and establish residential rent
control within the City limits; and,
WHEREAS, whenever local rent control has been tested, in such
cities as Cambridge, Massachusetts, it has failed to produce the
desired results and has. instead reduced the rental housing supply;
and,
WHEREAS, federal rent control was in effect between August
1971 and January 10, 1973 and this proposition would reduce
rentals to the level of January 1, 1973; therefore this
proposition would force most rentals in the City back to the level
of three years ago; and,
WHEREAS, this proposition would require thousands of individual
hearings before the Rent Control Board before rents adjusted for the
recent inflation could be established throughout the City, and would
discourage, if not make impossible, future fair and timely rent
adjustments; and,
WHEREAS, these effects of Measure B would put severe economic
pressure on owners (including many elderly owners with low and
moderate incomes), encouraging many of them to:
1. sell their homes to home buyers, and evict the
tenants,
2. sell their older structures for demolition,
3. stop renting extra rooms to students,
4. favor commercial development over rental housing
development, and,
5. convert apartment rental units to condominiums; and,
WHEREAS, increased demand, for fewer and fewer housing units,
would make it harder and harder for people of moderate means to find
housing in Palo Alto; and,
WHEREAS, economic pressure on owners would also result in
undermaintenance and eventual deterioration of many homes and other
rental properties throughout Palo Alto; and,
WHEREAS, a similar proposition in Berkeley has been ruled
unconstitutional; and,
WHEREAS, this proposition would cause substantial increase in
