# Strikers, Sabotage Diminish
## 
### DON COX 
The number of striking Universi
workers dropped to 819 yesterday,
according to University figures, down
about 150 from the beginning of the
strike.
As the strike by the United
Stanford Employees (USE) union
ground into its 17th day, incidents of
apparent sabotage also diminished in
number.
"It was a very quiet day, especially
compared to yesterday [Tuesday],"
said Plant Services director Dan
DeYoung.
USE spokesman Tim Knaak said
last night that "it looks like a
settlement will be possible in the near
future, though exactly when I can't
say."
A joint USE—University press
release issued early this morning
reported that negotiations had "moved
to the consideration of major issues,
including economic issues" and that
both sides were "hopeful."
Negotiations will continue on a daily
basis it said.
Talks More Serious
"Negotiations are becoming more
serious and more fruitful," he said.
Knaak said the new procedure
whereby neither the University nor the
union will make individual comments
on the progress of the negotiations was
indicative of the more serious nature
of the negotiations and was thus a
"hopeful sign."
"We feel that of the strike
demands, we have had maybe half of
these come to a reasonable state where
we can come to a settlement," he said.
The progress of the negotiations
was discussed at a meeting of the
union membership last night in
Carpenter's Hall in Palo Alto.
Newsmen were barred from the
meeting.
Declined Comment
Knaak said the progress of
negotiations "is something to be
discussed by the membership and not
publicly." For this reason, Knaak
declined to comment on any of the
contract issues under negotiation.
