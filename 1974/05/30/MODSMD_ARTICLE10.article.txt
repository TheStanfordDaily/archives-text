# For Private P. O.

Representative B. F. Sisk, in
his column "Return Post Office
To Government" (Daily, May 24),
has shown himself to be yet
another victim of the temptation
among legislators to assume that
any ill of society would be cured
if only lawmakers were permitted
a stranglehold over the virus.
What is additionally disturbing
about Sisk's call for control of the
new Postal Corporation by
Congress is his apparent
retrograde amnesia. The
.bureaucratic morass of the old
U.S. Post Office was the very
reason for Congress' half-hearted
attempt at postal reform three
years ago.
Sisk, in fact, is guilty of
stupidity or outright deception
when he speaks of " 'horror
stories' about our postal system
since it was taken over by a
private corporation (emphasis
added)." In truth, a public
corporation, administered by the
U.S. government, has mismanaged
the mails in the years subsequent
.to postal "reform."
So when Sisk says he has
introduced a bill "to return the
Post Office to the United States
government" he either forgets or
ignores the fact that first class
mail was never let loose from
government monopoly in the first
place. Therein lies the real hope
for postal reform.
Independents Wait
A plethora of independent
postal firms await the opportunity
to challenge the government's first
class mail service. They look
forward to the chance to eradicate
two-year-old Christmas card
deliveries, forever escalating

postage rates, callous service and
damaged parcels—the very faults
of the present service of which
Sisk complains. He fails to
mention, however, that these
drawbacks were also inherent in
the old Post Office he now seeks
to return.
Sisk makes a strange defense of
the congressionally run Post
Office's horse-and-buggy era
practices when he says the Postal
Corporation's "efficient business
methods" resemble those which
"have begun to bug the American
public in its dealings with
computerized businesses."
What Sisk and some other
congressmen may actually seek is
the return of political patronage
in the selection of postmasters,
which marred the precursor to our
present government mail
corporation.
The current set-up has
apparently failed in its mission to
provide better mail service at a
cheaper cost. It is an evil—but its
predecessor was certainly no
better. We needn't continue to
suffer from the malfunctions of
either one, were Sisk and his
fellow representatives not afraid,
for some reason, to let
competitive enterprise have a shot
at the problem.
The only apparent recourse is
to write lawmakers on the House
Committee on Post Office and
Civil Service and tell them to
defeat Sisk's HR 11449, and
instead to repeal the government's
monopoly on first class mail. But
don't hold your breath.
