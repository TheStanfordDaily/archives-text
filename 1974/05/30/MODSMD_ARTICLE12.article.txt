# Rent Control Would Violate Rights
## 
### 
Bill Evers

On June 4, the voters of Palo Alto will
decide on Measure B which, if passed, would
impose rent control on housing in the city.
Rent control is a government-imposed
price maximum. Instead of allowing freely
negotiated market exchanges, the
government restricts the options and violates
the rights of those who wish to rent out
living quarters.
Economic science clearly explains the
consequences of imposing price maximums
like rent control, and there is considerable
illustrative historical experience as well.
The economics textbook Exchange and
Production, written by Armen A. Alchian
and William R. Allen, says: 'To analyze what
happens when price controls restrict
exchange negotiations, suppose that demand
for ... housing space increases and that
rents or house prices are not allowed to rise.
The total amount demanded exceeds the
supply available at the old, continuing,
legal-limit price. A shortage, or what is the
same thing, an 'excessive demand' develops."
? -RAND Study
The RAND Institute was commissioned
by New York City's Housing and
Development Administration to do a lengthy
and in-depth study of the city's experience
with rent control since World War 11.
This 1970 RAND study found that rent
control had caused a massive reduction in the
housing stock via abandonment, caused
deterioration of the remaining housing stock,
induced landlords and tenants to harass each
other, and essentially halted new investment

in housing.
The RAND study described the
atmosphere of landlord-tenant relations
under rent control: "On the one hand, there
is evidence that tenants often create
violations for the specific purpose of
obtaining rent reductions. On the other hand,
there is evidence that landlords frequently
resort to harassment of statutory tenants in
order to force them to vacate an
apartment... or to agree to support the
landlord's petition for rent increases ..."
Like 'Wrecking Crew'
Rent control acted like an institutional
wrecking crew on New York City housing.
The study found that housing units subject
to rent control were "much more likely to
show evidence of deterioration." The
evidence assembled by the RAND study
project indicated that ''disinvestment by
undermaintenance is widespread in the
rent-controlled inventory, and that alarming
numbers of both sound and deteriorating
structures are being withdrawn from the
market."
The abandonment of New York
apartment buildings by owners was so
massive that, according to the study, no
other city could even approach it in scale.
"Older rent-controlled buildings and
nearly all rental housing in ghetto
neighborhoods have ceased to be attractive to
investors and mortgage lenders. Present
owners, unable to sell on plausible terms, can
partially disinvest by undermaintenance, or
cut their losses by abandonment."

Since market-clearing prices were
prohibited. New York residents had a large,
unmet demand for housing and a shrinking,
deteriorating stock of housing.
Other case studies have been done on the
effects of rent control. The universality of
the findings of economic theory can be seen
in the book Verdict on Rent Control
published by the Institute of Economic
Affairs in London. It examines rent controls
in five countries (the U.S., Great Britain,
Austria, Sweden and France) across 50
years.
One interesting example cited in this book
is the contrast between San Francisco in
1906 and in 1946. After the great fire and
earthquake of 1906, much of the city's
housing was destroyed. Yet there was no
public outcry about a housing shortage. The
surviving stock and temporary shelters
absorbed those displaced, while rapid
construction of new housing proceeded
apace.
In contrast, in 1946, after World War II
price controls, the governor of California
called the housing shortage the "most critical
problem" facing the state.
Economic theory makes it evident that
rent control is counterproductive. Voters
should reject Measure B to prevent Palo Alto
from having a housing situation like New
York's.

? -RAND Study
The RAND Institute was commissioned
by New York City's Housing and
Development Administration to do a lengthy
and in-depth study of the city's experience
with rent control since World War 11.
This 1970 RAND study found that rent
control had caused a massive reduction in the
housing stock via abandonment, caused
deterioration of the remaining housing stock,
induced landlords and tenants to harass each
other, and essentially halted new investment

in housing.
The RAND study described the
atmosphere of landlord-tenant relations
under rent control: "On the one hand, there
is evidence that tenants often create
violations for the specific purpose of
obtaining rent reductions. On the other hand,
there is evidence that landlords frequently
resort to harassment of statutory tenants in
order to force them to vacate an
apartment... or to agree to support the
landlord's petition for rent increases ..."
Like 'Wrecking Crew'
Rent control acted like an institutional
wrecking crew on New York City housing.
The study found that housing units subject
to rent control were "much more likely to
show evidence of deterioration." The
evidence assembled by the RAND study
project indicated that ''disinvestment by
undermaintenance is widespread in the
rent-controlled inventory, and that alarming
numbers of both sound and deteriorating
structures are being withdrawn from the
market."
The abandonment of New York
apartment buildings by owners was so
massive that, according to the study, no
other city could even approach it in scale.
"Older rent-controlled buildings and
nearly all rental housing in ghetto
neighborhoods have ceased to be attractive to
investors and mortgage lenders. Present
owners, unable to sell on plausible terms, can
partially disinvest by undermaintenance, or
cut their losses by abandonment."

Since market-clearing prices were
prohibited. New York residents had a large,
unmet demand for housing and a shrinking,
deteriorating stock of housing.
Other case studies have been done on the
effects of rent control. The universality of
the findings of economic theory can be seen
in the book Verdict on Rent Control
published by the Institute of Economic
Affairs in London. It examines rent controls
in five countries (the U.S., Great Britain,
Austria, Sweden and France) across 50
years.
One interesting example cited in this book
is the contrast between San Francisco in
1906 and in 1946. After the great fire and
earthquake of 1906, much of the city's
housing was destroyed. Yet there was no
public outcry about a housing shortage. The
surviving stock and temporary shelters
absorbed those displaced, while rapid
construction of new housing proceeded
apace.
In contrast, in 1946, after World War II
price controls, the governor of California
called the housing shortage the "most critical
problem" facing the state.
Economic theory makes it evident that
rent control is counterproductive. Voters
should reject Measure B to prevent Palo Alto
from having a housing situation like New
York's.

On June 4, the voters of Palo Alto will
decide on Measure B which, if passed, would
impose rent control on housing in the city.
Rent control is a government-imposed
price maximum. Instead of allowing freely
negotiated market exchanges, the
government restricts the options and violates
the rights of those who wish to rent out
living quarters.
Economic science clearly explains the
consequences of imposing price maximums
like rent control, and there is considerable
illustrative historical experience as well.
The economics textbook Exchange and
Production, written by Armen A. Alchian
and William R. Allen, says: 'To analyze what
happens when price controls restrict
exchange negotiations, suppose that demand
for ... housing space increases and that
rents or house prices are not allowed to rise.
The total amount demanded exceeds the
supply available at the old, continuing,
legal-limit price. A shortage, or what is the
same thing, an 'excessive demand' develops."
