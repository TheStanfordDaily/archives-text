Candidate Speaks
Editor:
I am a candidate for United
States Congress because I feel that
the time has come for the
generation born after World War
II to have a say in national policy
making. Having been given the
bounty of our great nation as an
inheritance, I personally feel the
greatest need is to secure these
blessings of peace and well-being
for our children and the world.
We must be more modest in our
wants and more thoughtful for
the future.
I am a Republican because I
would like to see us reduce the
federal budget, reduce defense
spending, revise the tax and social
security systems, improve the
nation's railroads, and come to
terms with our national debt.
The initiative for these changes
should come from the United
States House of Representatives.
As your representative in
Washington, D.C., I would
recommend action on t,l!ese
specific issues:
(1). Inflation - We should take
in less money (as taxes), print less
money, and spend less money.
(2). Amnesty - We should
forgive and forget the legal
complications caused by the
Vietnam War.
(3). Women's Rights We
should by Constitutional
Amendment guarantee equality
regardless of sex.
(4). Conservation - We should
better manage federal resources
and encourage agricultural
production.
(5). Marijuana - We should
endorse local management of this
problem with initial emphasis on
legalization of limited cultivation
as the first step in progressive
decriminalization.

Moretti Can Win
Editor:
It was with great
dissappointment that I read of
your decision to endorse Rep.
Jerome Waldie for governor in the
upcoming June 4 primary
election.
Although Waldie is an energetic
and honest man who would make
an effective governor, it is a sad
truth of American politics that
the best candidate is not always
on an equal footing with the other
candidates. A glance at the polls
shows us that Waldie does not
have a chance of winning. In
effect a vote for him is a vote for
the frontrunner, Jerry Brown.
In your editorial you also
pointed out that one other
candidate, Assembly Speaker Bob
Moretti, stands for many of the
same things that Waldie does. Bob
Moretti is currently given second
spot in the polls, and is the only
viable alternative to the
unimaginative and secretive
Brown.
Bob Moretti is in favor of
decriminalization of victimless
crimes, collective bargaining for
public employees, and public
financing of political campaigns.
He would make a progressive and
effective governor and affords the
best chance of beating the strong
but conservative candidacy of
Republican Hugh Flournoy this
coming November. It is hoped
that progressive minded people
will realize this and vote for Bob
Moretti for Governor of
California.

On Thai Invitation
Editor:
I understand that the
Associated Students of Stanford
University voted to invite Nguyen
Huu Thai to Stanford as a special
guest lecturer. I commend the

students for this.
It is important for two reasons.
First, I believe that this action will
highlight the case of one person
who is still imprisoned despite the
Paris agreements. As you may
know, Ngo Ba Thanh, another
neutralist political leader, was
released because of a similar
action by Columbia University.
Secondly, I believe that
Stanford students will greatly
benefit from the ideas of this
young Vietnamese leader. I
remember visiting with Thai while
I was in Vietnam in 1970. I was
especially impressed with his
interest in exploring ways to bring
about reconciliation among
Vietnamese and ways to promote
the reconstruction of his country
once the war is over.
While I was in Vietnam I
visited one South Vietnamese
prison. I saw several hundred men
and women crowded into tiny
cells that were called Tiger Cages.
Their bodies showed evidence of
lack of food and water as well as
the effects of mistreatment.
So I know from my own
observations what being in a
Saigon prison can be like. I'm
personally very glad of the work
the students are doing to help one
person, Hguyen Huu Thai, be
freed from this inhumanity.

The Stanford Goose
Editor:
Imagine a goose. A pretty
remarkable goose. She provided
enough eggs to feed the cook who
cooked the eggs and the people
who both ate the eggs and kept up
the farm which supported the
goose. She was, after all, the
cousin of the goose of golden egg
fame.
Imagine the cook and the

eaters getting together to
determine that: (a) the farm
should be free, that is, it should
provide everything they wanted so
long as they presented themselves
at the farmhouse door every day,
(b) that the goose wasn't laying
enough eggs, and that therefore
(c) with only a little
manipulation, the goose could be
brought around to laying as many
eggs as the cook and the eaters
desired. It had, after all, up to
that point, been a pretty
remarkable goose.
Imagine the result.

wants and more thoughtful for
the future.
I am a Republican because I
would like to see us reduce the
federal budget, reduce defense
spending, revise the tax and social
security systems, improve the
nation's railroads, and come to
terms with our national debt.
The initiative for these changes
should come from the United
States House of Representatives.
As your representative in
Washington, D.C., I would
recommend action on t,l!ese
specific issues:
(1). Inflation - We should take
in less money (as taxes), print less
money, and spend less money.
(2). Amnesty - We should
forgive and forget the legal
complications caused by the
Vietnam War.
(3). Women's Rights We
should by Constitutional
Amendment guarantee equality
regardless of sex.
(4). Conservation - We should
better manage federal resources
and encourage agricultural
production.
(5). Marijuana - We should
endorse local management of this
problem with initial emphasis on
legalization of limited cultivation
as the first step in progressive
decriminalization.

Editor:
It was with great
dissappointment that I read of
your decision to endorse Rep.
Jerome Waldie for governor in the
upcoming June 4 primary
election.
Although Waldie is an energetic
and honest man who would make
an effective governor, it is a sad
truth of American politics that
the best candidate is not always
on an equal footing with the other
candidates. A glance at the polls
shows us that Waldie does not
have a chance of winning. In
effect a vote for him is a vote for
the frontrunner, Jerry Brown.
In your editorial you also
pointed out that one other
candidate, Assembly Speaker Bob
Moretti, stands for many of the
same things that Waldie does. Bob
Moretti is currently given second
spot in the polls, and is the only
viable alternative to the
unimaginative and secretive
Brown.
Bob Moretti is in favor of
decriminalization of victimless
crimes, collective bargaining for
public employees, and public
financing of political campaigns.
He would make a progressive and
effective governor and affords the
best chance of beating the strong
but conservative candidacy of
Republican Hugh Flournoy this
coming November. It is hoped
that progressive minded people
will realize this and vote for Bob
Moretti for Governor of
California.

On Thai Invitation
Editor:
I understand that the
Associated Students of Stanford
University voted to invite Nguyen
Huu Thai to Stanford as a special
guest lecturer. I commend the

students for this.
It is important for two reasons.
First, I believe that this action will
highlight the case of one person
who is still imprisoned despite the
Paris agreements. As you may
know, Ngo Ba Thanh, another
neutralist political leader, was
released because of a similar
action by Columbia University.
Secondly, I believe that
Stanford students will greatly
benefit from the ideas of this
young Vietnamese leader. I
remember visiting with Thai while
I was in Vietnam in 1970. I was
especially impressed with his
interest in exploring ways to bring
about reconciliation among
Vietnamese and ways to promote
the reconstruction of his country
once the war is over.
While I was in Vietnam I
visited one South Vietnamese
prison. I saw several hundred men
and women crowded into tiny
cells that were called Tiger Cages.
Their bodies showed evidence of
lack of food and water as well as
the effects of mistreatment.
So I know from my own
observations what being in a
Saigon prison can be like. I'm
personally very glad of the work
the students are doing to help one
person, Hguyen Huu Thai, be
freed from this inhumanity.

Imagine a goose. A pretty
remarkable goose. She provided
enough eggs to feed the cook who
cooked the eggs and the people
who both ate the eggs and kept up
the farm which supported the
goose. She was, after all, the
cousin of the goose of golden egg
fame.
Imagine the cook and the

eaters getting together to
determine that: (a) the farm
should be free, that is, it should
provide everything they wanted so
long as they presented themselves
at the farmhouse door every day,
(b) that the goose wasn't laying
enough eggs, and that therefore
(c) with only a little
manipulation, the goose could be
brought around to laying as many
eggs as the cook and the eaters
desired. It had, after all, up to
that point, been a pretty
remarkable goose.

recommend action on t,l!ese
specific issues:
(1). Inflation - We should take
in less money (as taxes), print less
money, and spend less money.
(2). Amnesty - We should
forgive and forget the legal
complications caused by the
Vietnam War.
(3). Women's Rights We
should by Constitutional
Amendment guarantee equality
regardless of sex.
(4). Conservation - We should
better manage federal resources
and encourage agricultural
production.
(5). Marijuana - We should
endorse local management of this
problem with initial emphasis on
legalization of limited cultivation
as the first step in progressive
decriminalization.

Moretti Can Win
Editor:
It was with great
dissappointment that I read of
your decision to endorse Rep.
Jerome Waldie for governor in the
upcoming June 4 primary
election.
Although Waldie is an energetic
and honest man who would make
an effective governor, it is a sad
truth of American politics that
the best candidate is not always
on an equal footing with the other
candidates. A glance at the polls
shows us that Waldie does not
have a chance of winning. In
effect a vote for him is a vote for
the frontrunner, Jerry Brown.
In your editorial you also
pointed out that one other
candidate, Assembly Speaker Bob
Moretti, stands for many of the
same things that Waldie does. Bob
Moretti is currently given second
spot in the polls, and is the only
viable alternative to the
unimaginative and secretive
Brown.
Bob Moretti is in favor of
decriminalization of victimless
crimes, collective bargaining for
public employees, and public
financing of political campaigns.
He would make a progressive and
effective governor and affords the
best chance of beating the strong
but conservative candidacy of
Republican Hugh Flournoy this
coming November. It is hoped
that progressive minded people
will realize this and vote for Bob
Moretti for Governor of
California.

On Thai Invitation
Editor:
I understand that the
Associated Students of Stanford
University voted to invite Nguyen
Huu Thai to Stanford as a special
guest lecturer. I commend the

students for this.
It is important for two reasons.
First, I believe that this action will
highlight the case of one person
who is still imprisoned despite the
Paris agreements. As you may
know, Ngo Ba Thanh, another
neutralist political leader, was
released because of a similar
action by Columbia University.
Secondly, I believe that
Stanford students will greatly
benefit from the ideas of this
young Vietnamese leader. I
remember visiting with Thai while
I was in Vietnam in 1970. I was
especially impressed with his
interest in exploring ways to bring
about reconciliation among
Vietnamese and ways to promote
the reconstruction of his country
once the war is over.
While I was in Vietnam I
visited one South Vietnamese
prison. I saw several hundred men
and women crowded into tiny
cells that were called Tiger Cages.
Their bodies showed evidence of
lack of food and water as well as
the effects of mistreatment.
So I know from my own
observations what being in a
Saigon prison can be like. I'm
personally very glad of the work
the students are doing to help one
person, Hguyen Huu Thai, be
freed from this inhumanity.

The Stanford Goose
Editor:
Imagine a goose. A pretty
remarkable goose. She provided
enough eggs to feed the cook who
cooked the eggs and the people
who both ate the eggs and kept up
the farm which supported the
goose. She was, after all, the
cousin of the goose of golden egg
fame.
Imagine the cook and the

eaters getting together to
determine that: (a) the farm
should be free, that is, it should
provide everything they wanted so
long as they presented themselves
at the farmhouse door every day,
(b) that the goose wasn't laying
enough eggs, and that therefore
(c) with only a little
manipulation, the goose could be
brought around to laying as many
eggs as the cook and the eaters
desired. It had, after all, up to
that point, been a pretty
remarkable goose.
Imagine the result.

Candidate Speaks
Editor:
I am a candidate for United
States Congress because I feel that
the time has come for the
generation born after World War
II to have a say in national policy
making. Having been given the
bounty of our great nation as an
inheritance, I personally feel the
greatest need is to secure these
blessings of peace and well-being
for our children and the world.
We must be more modest in our
wants and more thoughtful for
the future.
I am a Republican because I
would like to see us reduce the
federal budget, reduce defense
spending, revise the tax and social
security systems, improve the
nation's railroads, and come to
terms with our national debt.
The initiative for these changes
should come from the United
States House of Representatives.
As your representative in
Washington, D.C., I would
recommend action on t,l!ese
specific issues:
(1). Inflation - We should take
in less money (as taxes), print less

(2). Amnesty - We should
