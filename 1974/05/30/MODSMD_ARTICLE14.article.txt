Throughout the Spring, as time
and legislative duties permitted.
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos
and I have been telling students
and faculty members why we
believe Bob Moretti should be the
Democratic nominee for governor
of California.
Bob Moretti and 1 were elected
to the California Legislature in the
same year, 1964. it was evident
from the start that we shared
many of the same legislative goals,
that we were determined to wrest
control of California government
from those who were interested in
using government for personal
advantage or on behalf of special
interests.
In 1970, Bob Moretti's
leadership ability was recognized
by his colleagues in the Assembly.
That year, he was elected Speaker,
and began, at once, to
demonstrate his determination to
carry out some of the programs
we had talked about. He put the
strength and prestige of his office
solidly behind significant
consumer-protection legislation.
He went to Washington to
testify against cutbacks in
Medicare. When the federal
government announced
curtailment of support for
children's centers and pre-school
programs. Bob Moretti authored
legislation to continue those
programs with state funds. As a
member of the state's higher
education governing boards, he
has consistently opposed fee
increases, and even urged their
elimination.
Challenged
He challenged the oil
monopoly, when it appeared the
country had been maneuvered
into an energy crisis. Bob Moretti
authored the "Public Campaign
Financing Act of 1974." He has
repeatedly called for
decriminalization of victimless
crimes and for reform of police
procedures dealing with rape.
Women and ethnic minorities,
thanks to Bob Moretti's interest,
have assumed more positions of
responsibility on state
commissions and boards. In the
State Assembly, representatives of
ethnic minorities have been
appointed to leadership positions.
In fact, it's now conceivable that a
black man could become the next
Speaker.
Last November, Bob Moretti
led the forces that joined up to
defeat an attempt by Governor
Reagan and some of his friends to
shift more of the tax burden from
the rich to the poor. For the past
seven years, some of the most
progressive legislation ever drafted
in Sacramento has been vetoed by
a reactionary governor.
A new, progressive, courageous
and compassionate governor, can
remedy this. We can have major
tax reform; we can revise the laws
governing victimless crimes; there
can be significant changes in the
State's education programs, from
pre school to the university, if we
nominate the right man in the
June 4 Democratic gubernatorial
primary.
It is my belief that Bob Moretti
is best qualified to be that kind of
Governor. Least wealthy of all the
candidates, he has been and will
remain closest to the concerns of
the great majority of Californians.
The university community,
especially, would find him to be a
governor it could rely on.

curtailment of support for
children's centers and pre-school
programs. Bob Moretti authored
legislation to continue those
programs with state funds. As a
member of the state's higher
education governing boards, he
has consistently opposed fee
increases, and even urged their
elimination.
Challenged
He challenged the oil
monopoly, when it appeared the
country had been maneuvered
into an energy crisis. Bob Moretti
authored the "Public Campaign
Financing Act of 1974." He has
repeatedly called for
decriminalization of victimless
crimes and for reform of police
procedures dealing with rape.
Women and ethnic minorities,
thanks to Bob Moretti's interest,
have assumed more positions of
responsibility on state
commissions and boards. In the
State Assembly, representatives of
ethnic minorities have been
appointed to leadership positions.
In fact, it's now conceivable that a
black man could become the next
Speaker.
Last November, Bob Moretti
led the forces that joined up to
defeat an attempt by Governor
Reagan and some of his friends to
shift more of the tax burden from
the rich to the poor. For the past
seven years, some of the most
progressive legislation ever drafted
in Sacramento has been vetoed by
a reactionary governor.
A new, progressive, courageous
and compassionate governor, can
remedy this. We can have major
tax reform; we can revise the laws
governing victimless crimes; there
can be significant changes in the
State's education programs, from
pre school to the university, if we
nominate the right man in the
June 4 Democratic gubernatorial
primary.
It is my belief that Bob Moretti
is best qualified to be that kind of
Governor. Least wealthy of all the
candidates, he has been and will
remain closest to the concerns of
the great majority of Californians.
The university community,
especially, would find him to be a
governor it could rely on.

Assemblyman John Vasconcellos
and I have been telling students
and faculty members why we
believe Bob Moretti should be the
Democratic nominee for governor
of California.
Bob Moretti and 1 were elected
to the California Legislature in the
same year, 1964. it was evident
from the start that we shared
many of the same legislative goals,
that we were determined to wrest
control of California government
from those who were interested in
using government for personal
advantage or on behalf of special
interests.
In 1970, Bob Moretti's
leadership ability was recognized
by his colleagues in the Assembly.
That year, he was elected Speaker,
and began, at once, to
demonstrate his determination to
carry out some of the programs
we had talked about. He put the
strength and prestige of his office
solidly behind significant
consumer-protection legislation.
He went to Washington to
testify against cutbacks in
Medicare. When the federal
government announced
curtailment of support for
children's centers and pre-school
programs. Bob Moretti authored
legislation to continue those
programs with state funds. As a
member of the state's higher
education governing boards, he
has consistently opposed fee
