# Tough Battles
## Tuesday's Election Faceoffs 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
In 1966, only two incumbenl
statewide officeholders wor
re-election. In 1974, another such
massive change is in the offing
but for different reasons.
Eight years ago saw the defeat
of all incumbent Democrats save
one. This year, though, most of
the incumbents are leaving office
voluntarily: Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke, state Controllei
Houston Flournoy and Secretary
of State Edmund G. Brown Jr. are
all running for governor, and
Treasurer Ivy Baker Priest is
retiring.
Virtually all the primary races
have turned into tough battles for
the participants:
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
The Republicans are waging
the hottest battle for the
nomination for lieutenant
governor, with state Sen. John
Harmer, an outspoken
conservative from Glendale, facing
former Nixon administration
official John Veneman.
Although the more
conservative of the two, it was
Harmer who called for incumbent
Lt. Gov. Reinecke, a fellow
conservative, to withdraw from
the race for governor. Otherwise,
Harmer has generally been an
orthodox conservative, and boasts
backing from two of the state's
three major GOP volunteer
organizations — the conservative
California Republican Assembly
and the more conservative United
Republicans of California.
Veneman, former
undersecretary of Health,
Education and Welfare, was a
state assemblyman for several
years before taking the federal
post. He is backed by
moderate-liberal California
Republican League, and differs
from Harmer on several issues,
including:
—using highway funds for mass
transit (Veneman for, Harmer
against);
— decriminalization of
marijuana (Veneman for, Harmer
against);
—the Equal Rights Amendment
(Veneman for, Harmer against).
The Democrats have eight
contenders, but only three with a
serious chance at victory: state
Sens. Mervyn Dymally and
Lawrence Walsh, and University
of Southern California Law Prof.
Howard Miller.
Dymally, if nominated and
elected, would be only the second
black man ever elected to
statewide office, and the first
elected to a partisan post. A
leader in Sen. Hubert Humphrey's
1972 California presidential
campaign, he has campaigned
vigorously in this area, including
several appearances at Stanford,
and seems to be the frontrunner.
Miller, best known from his
role on PBS's The Advocates, has
criticized Dymally for his
opposition to Proposition 9, the
political reform initiative, and has
accused him of bowing to pressure
from the AFL-CIO and state
special interest groups.
Walsh, a Downey businessman,
has run third in most polls. His
campaigning has been limited in
this area, but he has been pushing
for support in the
heavily-populated southern
portion of the state on a moderate
platform.
ATTORNEY GENERAL
Although incumbent Atty.
Gen. Evelle Younger is unopposed
for the Republican nomination,
the Democrats are faced with a
rough battle to choose his
opponent. William Norris, a

Stanford graduate who favors
t decriminalization of marijuana
i and opposes the death penalty, is
l locked in a stiff battle with
, former Los Angeles Deputy Dist.
Atty. Vincent Bugliosi, who's
t banking on name recognition
? from his prosecution of the
' Manson case to bring him the
> nomination. Bugliosi has the
I backing of the state peace
r officers' association; in his
r unsuccessful 1972 bid for Los
> Angeles district attorney he was
I backed by consumer advocate
i Ralph Nader as well. However,
this race has degenerated into an
; ugly name-calling battle, revolving
around allegations about
Bugliosi's personal life.
TREASURER
The race for state treasurer to
succeed the retiring Republican
Ivy Baker Priest has turned into
one of the more interesting battles
this year, chiefly because of a
dogfight between Democrats Jess
Unruh, the 1970 gubernatorial
nominee, and Los Angeles
attorney Gray Davis.
Unruh, the one-time "Big
Daddy" of state politics, served as
speaker of the assembly longer
than anyone else. In 1968, he
headed the California delegation
to the Democratic National
Convention — which had been
pledged to the late Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy — and in 1970 lost the
governorship to incumbent
Ronald Reagan by 500,000 votes.
After a humiliating defeat last
year for mayor of Los Angeles (he
received just 17 percent of the
vote), Unruh seemed politically
finished. But he now appears to
lead the pack for treasurer, where
he would control the state's
investments and bond issues.
Davis, a former aide to Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley,
Unruh's 1973 opponent, has run a
well-financed race so far. He says
Unruh is a tired old campaigner
looking for an opportunity to
"water at the public trough."
Unruh counters with the claim
that his reputation for toughness
"is just what's needed" in a
treasurer. Despite the tough talk
from both sides, though, few
issues separate the two.
The Republican frontrunner is
a former Reagan aide, former
consumer affairs chief John T.
Kehoe, who says he will continue
Priest's fiscal policies. His chief
foe is conservative Irvine City
Councilman Henry Quigley.
CONTROLLER
Most of the real fiscal

authority in the state rests with
the controller, and both parties
have vigorous contests. Moderate
Republican Assemblyman William
Bagley, who has long coveted a
state office, is facing conservative
opposition from Los Angeles
Community College Board
member Marian LaFollette and
black Pasadena attorney James
Flournoy — who may benefit
from voter confusion, since he
shares the same name as the
incumbent controller,
gubernatorial hopeful Houston
Flournoy. Bagley, from San
Rafael in Marin County, has
managed to work closely with
Gov. Reagan without tarnishing
his moderate-liberal image.
The Democrats have a
four-way battle between San
Francisco Supervisor Robert
Mendelsohn, Assemblyman
Kenneth Cory, former state
Treasurer Bert Betts and former
U.S. Rep. Ronald Brooks
Cameron. Mendelsohn and
Cory both emphasize their
opposition to oil corporate
domination of the state; Betts
emphasizes his previous
experiences in the capitol.
SECRETARY OF STATE
This office, dominated for
decades by one family — the

Republican Jordans — has
undergone substantial change
since Edmund G. Brown Jr. took
over four years ago. Now, with
Brown running for governor, both
parties see a chance for victory.
Former state Corporations
Commissioner Brian Van Camp is
the odds-on favorite to receive the
Republican nomination. With
backing from both the
moderate-liberal California
Republican League and the
conservative California
Republican Assembly, the former
Reagan aide faces his strongest
competition from conservative
lawyer Mike Montgomery, who
also has CRA backing as well as
support from the even-more
conservative United Republicans
of California.
The Democrats have another
four-way battle between Oakland
Assemblywoman March Fong,
Monterey Park Assemblyman
Walter Karabian, University of
Southern California lecturer
Cathy O'Neill and Los Angeles
attorney Herman Sillas. All
basically agree, to varying degrees,
on the need for electoral reform,
campaign spending limitations and
public financing of campaigns.
Both leading Republicans oppose
public financing.

statewide officeholders wor

1972 California presidential
campaign, he has campaigned
vigorously in this area, including
several appearances at Stanford,
and seems to be the frontrunner.
Miller, best known from his
role on PBS's The Advocates, has
criticized Dymally for his
opposition to Proposition 9, the
political reform initiative, and has
accused him of bowing to pressure
from the AFL-CIO and state
special interest groups.
Walsh, a Downey businessman,
has run third in most polls. His
campaigning has been limited in
this area, but he has been pushing
for support in the
heavily-populated southern
portion of the state on a moderate
platform.
ATTORNEY GENERAL
Although incumbent Atty.
Gen. Evelle Younger is unopposed
for the Republican nomination,
the Democrats are faced with a
rough battle to choose his
opponent. William Norris, a

Stanford graduate who favors
t decriminalization of marijuana
i and opposes the death penalty, is
l locked in a stiff battle with
, former Los Angeles Deputy Dist.
Atty. Vincent Bugliosi, who's
t banking on name recognition
? from his prosecution of the
' Manson case to bring him the
> nomination. Bugliosi has the
I backing of the state peace
r officers' association; in his
r unsuccessful 1972 bid for Los
> Angeles district attorney he was
I backed by consumer advocate
i Ralph Nader as well. However,
this race has degenerated into an
; ugly name-calling battle, revolving
around allegations about
Bugliosi's personal life.
TREASURER
The race for state treasurer to
succeed the retiring Republican
Ivy Baker Priest has turned into
one of the more interesting battles
this year, chiefly because of a
dogfight between Democrats Jess
Unruh, the 1970 gubernatorial
nominee, and Los Angeles
attorney Gray Davis.
Unruh, the one-time "Big
Daddy" of state politics, served as
speaker of the assembly longer
than anyone else. In 1968, he
headed the California delegation
to the Democratic National
Convention — which had been
pledged to the late Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy — and in 1970 lost the
governorship to incumbent
Ronald Reagan by 500,000 votes.
After a humiliating defeat last
year for mayor of Los Angeles (he
received just 17 percent of the
vote), Unruh seemed politically
finished. But he now appears to
lead the pack for treasurer, where
he would control the state's
investments and bond issues.
Davis, a former aide to Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley,
Unruh's 1973 opponent, has run a
well-financed race so far. He says
Unruh is a tired old campaigner
looking for an opportunity to
"water at the public trough."
Unruh counters with the claim
that his reputation for toughness
"is just what's needed" in a
treasurer. Despite the tough talk
from both sides, though, few
issues separate the two.
The Republican frontrunner is
a former Reagan aide, former
consumer affairs chief John T.
Kehoe, who says he will continue
Priest's fiscal policies. His chief
foe is conservative Irvine City
Councilman Henry Quigley.
CONTROLLER
Most of the real fiscal

authority in the state rests with
the controller, and both parties
have vigorous contests. Moderate
Republican Assemblyman William
Bagley, who has long coveted a
state office, is facing conservative
opposition from Los Angeles
Community College Board
member Marian LaFollette and
black Pasadena attorney James
Flournoy — who may benefit
from voter confusion, since he
shares the same name as the
incumbent controller,
gubernatorial hopeful Houston
Flournoy. Bagley, from San
Rafael in Marin County, has
managed to work closely with
Gov. Reagan without tarnishing
his moderate-liberal image.
The Democrats have a
four-way battle between San
Francisco Supervisor Robert
Mendelsohn, Assemblyman
Kenneth Cory, former state
Treasurer Bert Betts and former
U.S. Rep. Ronald Brooks
Cameron. Mendelsohn and
Cory both emphasize their
opposition to oil corporate
domination of the state; Betts
emphasizes his previous
experiences in the capitol.
SECRETARY OF STATE
This office, dominated for
decades by one family — the

Republican Jordans — has
undergone substantial change
since Edmund G. Brown Jr. took
over four years ago. Now, with
Brown running for governor, both
parties see a chance for victory.
Former state Corporations
Commissioner Brian Van Camp is
the odds-on favorite to receive the
Republican nomination. With
backing from both the
moderate-liberal California
Republican League and the
conservative California
Republican Assembly, the former
Reagan aide faces his strongest
competition from conservative
lawyer Mike Montgomery, who
also has CRA backing as well as
support from the even-more
conservative United Republicans
of California.
The Democrats have another
four-way battle between Oakland
Assemblywoman March Fong,
Monterey Park Assemblyman
Walter Karabian, University of
Southern California lecturer
Cathy O'Neill and Los Angeles
attorney Herman Sillas. All
basically agree, to varying degrees,
on the need for electoral reform,
campaign spending limitations and
public financing of campaigns.
Both leading Republicans oppose
public financing.
In 1966, only two incumbenl
statewide officeholders wor
re-election. In 1974, another such
massive change is in the offing
but for different reasons.
Eight years ago saw the defeat
of all incumbent Democrats save
one. This year, though, most of
the incumbents are leaving office
voluntarily: Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke, state Controllei
Houston Flournoy and Secretary
of State Edmund G. Brown Jr. are
all running for governor, and
Treasurer Ivy Baker Priest is
retiring.
Virtually all the primary races
have turned into tough battles for
the participants:
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
The Republicans are waging
the hottest battle for the
nomination for lieutenant
governor, with state Sen. John
Harmer, an outspoken
conservative from Glendale, facing
former Nixon administration
official John Veneman.
Although the more
conservative of the two, it was
Harmer who called for incumbent
Lt. Gov. Reinecke, a fellow
conservative, to withdraw from
the race for governor. Otherwise,
Harmer has generally been an
orthodox conservative, and boasts
backing from two of the state's
three major GOP volunteer
organizations — the conservative
California Republican Assembly
and the more conservative United
Republicans of California.
Veneman, former
undersecretary of Health,
Education and Welfare, was a
state assemblyman for several
years before taking the federal
post. He is backed by
moderate-liberal California
Republican League, and differs
from Harmer on several issues,
including:
—using highway funds for mass
transit (Veneman for, Harmer
against);
— decriminalization of
marijuana (Veneman for, Harmer
against);
—the Equal Rights Amendment
(Veneman for, Harmer against).
The Democrats have eight
contenders, but only three with a
serious chance at victory: state
Sens. Mervyn Dymally and
Lawrence Walsh, and University
of Southern California Law Prof.
Howard Miller.
Dymally, if nominated and
elected, would be only the second
black man ever elected to
statewide office, and the first
elected to a partisan post. A
leader in Sen. Hubert Humphrey's
1972 California presidential
campaign, he has campaigned
vigorously in this area, including
several appearances at Stanford,

Ronald Reagan by 500,000 votes.
After a humiliating defeat last
year for mayor of Los Angeles (he
received just 17 percent of the
vote), Unruh seemed politically
finished. But he now appears to
lead the pack for treasurer, where
he would control the state's
investments and bond issues.
Davis, a former aide to Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley,
Unruh's 1973 opponent, has run a
well-financed race so far. He says
Unruh is a tired old campaigner
looking for an opportunity to
"water at the public trough."
Unruh counters with the claim
that his reputation for toughness
"is just what's needed" in a
treasurer. Despite the tough talk
from both sides, though, few
issues separate the two.
The Republican frontrunner is
a former Reagan aide, former
consumer affairs chief John T.
Kehoe, who says he will continue
Priest's fiscal policies. His chief
foe is conservative Irvine City
Councilman Henry Quigley.
CONTROLLER
Most of the real fiscal

authority in the state rests with
the controller, and both parties
have vigorous contests. Moderate
Republican Assemblyman William
Bagley, who has long coveted a
state office, is facing conservative
opposition from Los Angeles
Community College Board
member Marian LaFollette and
black Pasadena attorney James
Flournoy — who may benefit
from voter confusion, since he
shares the same name as the
incumbent controller,
gubernatorial hopeful Houston
Flournoy. Bagley, from San
Rafael in Marin County, has
managed to work closely with
Gov. Reagan without tarnishing
his moderate-liberal image.
The Democrats have a
four-way battle between San
Francisco Supervisor Robert
Mendelsohn, Assemblyman
Kenneth Cory, former state
Treasurer Bert Betts and former
U.S. Rep. Ronald Brooks
Cameron. Mendelsohn and
Cory both emphasize their
opposition to oil corporate
domination of the state; Betts
emphasizes his previous
experiences in the capitol.
SECRETARY OF STATE
This office, dominated for
decades by one family — the

Republican Jordans — has
undergone substantial change
since Edmund G. Brown Jr. took
over four years ago. Now, with
Brown running for governor, both
parties see a chance for victory.
Former state Corporations
Commissioner Brian Van Camp is
the odds-on favorite to receive the
Republican nomination. With
backing from both the
moderate-liberal California
Republican League and the
conservative California
Republican Assembly, the former
Reagan aide faces his strongest
competition from conservative
lawyer Mike Montgomery, who
also has CRA backing as well as
support from the even-more
conservative United Republicans
of California.
The Democrats have another
four-way battle between Oakland
Assemblywoman March Fong,
Monterey Park Assemblyman
Walter Karabian, University of
Southern California lecturer
Cathy O'Neill and Los Angeles
attorney Herman Sillas. All
basically agree, to varying degrees,
on the need for electoral reform,
campaign spending limitations and
public financing of campaigns.
Both leading Republicans oppose
public financing.
In 1966, only two incumbenl
statewide officeholders wor
re-election. In 1974, another such
massive change is in the offing
but for different reasons.
Eight years ago saw the defeat
of all incumbent Democrats save
one. This year, though, most of
the incumbents are leaving office
voluntarily: Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke, state Controllei
Houston Flournoy and Secretary
of State Edmund G. Brown Jr. are
all running for governor, and
Treasurer Ivy Baker Priest is
retiring.
Virtually all the primary races
have turned into tough battles for
the participants:
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
The Republicans are waging
the hottest battle for the
nomination for lieutenant
governor, with state Sen. John
Harmer, an outspoken
conservative from Glendale, facing
former Nixon administration
official John Veneman.
Although the more
conservative of the two, it was
Harmer who called for incumbent
Lt. Gov. Reinecke, a fellow
conservative, to withdraw from
the race for governor. Otherwise,
Harmer has generally been an
orthodox conservative, and boasts
backing from two of the state's
three major GOP volunteer
organizations — the conservative
California Republican Assembly
and the more conservative United
Republicans of California.
Veneman, former
undersecretary of Health,
Education and Welfare, was a
state assemblyman for several
years before taking the federal
post. He is backed by
moderate-liberal California
Republican League, and differs
from Harmer on several issues,
including:
—using highway funds for mass
transit (Veneman for, Harmer
against);
— decriminalization of
marijuana (Veneman for, Harmer
against);
—the Equal Rights Amendment
(Veneman for, Harmer against).
The Democrats have eight
contenders, but only three with a
serious chance at victory: state
Sens. Mervyn Dymally and
Lawrence Walsh, and University
of Southern California Law Prof.
Howard Miller.
Dymally, if nominated and
elected, would be only the second
black man ever elected to
statewide office, and the first
elected to a partisan post. A
leader in Sen. Hubert Humphrey's
1972 California presidential
campaign, he has campaigned
vigorously in this area, including
several appearances at Stanford,
and seems to be the frontrunner.
Miller, best known from his
role on PBS's The Advocates, has
criticized Dymally for his
opposition to Proposition 9, the
political reform initiative, and has
accused him of bowing to pressure
from the AFL-CIO and state
special interest groups.
Walsh, a Downey businessman,
has run third in most polls. His
campaigning has been limited in
this area, but he has been pushing
for support in the
heavily-populated southern
portion of the state on a moderate
platform.
ATTORNEY GENERAL
Although incumbent Atty.
Gen. Evelle Younger is unopposed
for the Republican nomination,
the Democrats are faced with a
rough battle to choose his
opponent. William Norris, a

Stanford graduate who favors
t decriminalization of marijuana
i and opposes the death penalty, is
l locked in a stiff battle with
, former Los Angeles Deputy Dist.
Atty. Vincent Bugliosi, who's
t banking on name recognition
? from his prosecution of the
' Manson case to bring him the
> nomination. Bugliosi has the
I backing of the state peace
r officers' association; in his
r unsuccessful 1972 bid for Los
> Angeles district attorney he was
I backed by consumer advocate
i Ralph Nader as well. However,
this race has degenerated into an
; ugly name-calling battle, revolving
around allegations about
Bugliosi's personal life.
TREASURER
The race for state treasurer to
succeed the retiring Republican
Ivy Baker Priest has turned into
one of the more interesting battles
this year, chiefly because of a
dogfight between Democrats Jess
Unruh, the 1970 gubernatorial
nominee, and Los Angeles
attorney Gray Davis.
Unruh, the one-time "Big
Daddy" of state politics, served as
speaker of the assembly longer
than anyone else. In 1968, he
headed the California delegation
to the Democratic National
Convention — which had been
pledged to the late Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy — and in 1970 lost the
governorship to incumbent
Ronald Reagan by 500,000 votes.
After a humiliating defeat last
year for mayor of Los Angeles (he
received just 17 percent of the

parties see a chance for victory.
Former state Corporations
Commissioner Brian Van Camp is
the odds-on favorite to receive the
Republican nomination. With
backing from both the
moderate-liberal California
Republican League and the
conservative California
Republican Assembly, the former
Reagan aide faces his strongest
competition from conservative
lawyer Mike Montgomery, who
also has CRA backing as well as
support from the even-more
conservative United Republicans
of California.
The Democrats have another
four-way battle between Oakland
Assemblywoman March Fong,
Monterey Park Assemblyman
Walter Karabian, University of
Southern California lecturer
Cathy O'Neill and Los Angeles
attorney Herman Sillas. All
basically agree, to varying degrees,
on the need for electoral reform,
campaign spending limitations and
public financing of campaigns.
Both leading Republicans oppose
public financing.
In 1966, only two incumbenl
statewide officeholders wor
re-election. In 1974, another such
massive change is in the offing
but for different reasons.
Eight years ago saw the defeat
of all incumbent Democrats save
one. This year, though, most of
the incumbents are leaving office
voluntarily: Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke, state Controllei
Houston Flournoy and Secretary
of State Edmund G. Brown Jr. are
all running for governor, and
Treasurer Ivy Baker Priest is
retiring.
Virtually all the primary races
have turned into tough battles for
the participants:
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
The Republicans are waging
the hottest battle for the
nomination for lieutenant
governor, with state Sen. John
Harmer, an outspoken
conservative from Glendale, facing
former Nixon administration
official John Veneman.
Although the more
conservative of the two, it was
Harmer who called for incumbent
Lt. Gov. Reinecke, a fellow
conservative, to withdraw from
the race for governor. Otherwise,
Harmer has generally been an
orthodox conservative, and boasts
backing from two of the state's
three major GOP volunteer
organizations — the conservative
California Republican Assembly
and the more conservative United
Republicans of California.
Veneman, former
undersecretary of Health,
Education and Welfare, was a
state assemblyman for several
years before taking the federal
post. He is backed by
moderate-liberal California
Republican League, and differs
from Harmer on several issues,
including:
—using highway funds for mass
transit (Veneman for, Harmer
against);
— decriminalization of
marijuana (Veneman for, Harmer
against);
—the Equal Rights Amendment
(Veneman for, Harmer against).
The Democrats have eight
contenders, but only three with a
serious chance at victory: state
Sens. Mervyn Dymally and
Lawrence Walsh, and University
of Southern California Law Prof.
Howard Miller.
Dymally, if nominated and
elected, would be only the second
black man ever elected to
statewide office, and the first
elected to a partisan post. A
leader in Sen. Hubert Humphrey's
1972 California presidential
campaign, he has campaigned
vigorously in this area, including
several appearances at Stanford,
and seems to be the frontrunner.
Miller, best known from his
role on PBS's The Advocates, has
criticized Dymally for his
opposition to Proposition 9, the
political reform initiative, and has
accused him of bowing to pressure
from the AFL-CIO and state
special interest groups.
Walsh, a Downey businessman,
has run third in most polls. His
campaigning has been limited in
this area, but he has been pushing
for support in the
heavily-populated southern
portion of the state on a moderate
platform.
ATTORNEY GENERAL
Although incumbent Atty.
Gen. Evelle Younger is unopposed
for the Republican nomination,
the Democrats are faced with a
rough battle to choose his
opponent. William Norris, a

Stanford graduate who favors
t decriminalization of marijuana
i and opposes the death penalty, is
l locked in a stiff battle with
, former Los Angeles Deputy Dist.
Atty. Vincent Bugliosi, who's
t banking on name recognition
? from his prosecution of the
' Manson case to bring him the
> nomination. Bugliosi has the
I backing of the state peace
r officers' association; in his
r unsuccessful 1972 bid for Los
> Angeles district attorney he was
I backed by consumer advocate
i Ralph Nader as well. However,
this race has degenerated into an
; ugly name-calling battle, revolving
around allegations about
Bugliosi's personal life.
TREASURER
The race for state treasurer to
succeed the retiring Republican
Ivy Baker Priest has turned into
one of the more interesting battles
this year, chiefly because of a
dogfight between Democrats Jess
Unruh, the 1970 gubernatorial
nominee, and Los Angeles
attorney Gray Davis.
Unruh, the one-time "Big
Daddy" of state politics, served as
speaker of the assembly longer
than anyone else. In 1968, he
headed the California delegation
to the Democratic National
Convention — which had been
pledged to the late Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy — and in 1970 lost the
governorship to incumbent
Ronald Reagan by 500,000 votes.
After a humiliating defeat last
year for mayor of Los Angeles (he
received just 17 percent of the
vote), Unruh seemed politically
finished. But he now appears to
lead the pack for treasurer, where
he would control the state's
investments and bond issues.
Davis, a former aide to Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley,
Unruh's 1973 opponent, has run a
well-financed race so far. He says
Unruh is a tired old campaigner
looking for an opportunity to
"water at the public trough."
Unruh counters with the claim
that his reputation for toughness
"is just what's needed" in a
treasurer. Despite the tough talk
from both sides, though, few
issues separate the two.
The Republican frontrunner is
a former Reagan aide, former
consumer affairs chief John T.
Kehoe, who says he will continue
Priest's fiscal policies. His chief
foe is conservative Irvine City
Councilman Henry Quigley.
CONTROLLER
Most of the real fiscal

authority in the state rests with
the controller, and both parties
have vigorous contests. Moderate
Republican Assemblyman William
Bagley, who has long coveted a
state office, is facing conservative
opposition from Los Angeles
Community College Board
member Marian LaFollette and
black Pasadena attorney James
Flournoy — who may benefit
from voter confusion, since he
shares the same name as the
incumbent controller,
gubernatorial hopeful Houston
Flournoy. Bagley, from San
Rafael in Marin County, has
managed to work closely with
Gov. Reagan without tarnishing
his moderate-liberal image.
The Democrats have a
four-way battle between San
Francisco Supervisor Robert
Mendelsohn, Assemblyman
Kenneth Cory, former state
Treasurer Bert Betts and former
U.S. Rep. Ronald Brooks
Cameron. Mendelsohn and
Cory both emphasize their
opposition to oil corporate
domination of the state; Betts
emphasizes his previous
experiences in the capitol.
SECRETARY OF STATE
This office, dominated for
decades by one family — the

Republican Jordans — has
undergone substantial change
since Edmund G. Brown Jr. took
over four years ago. Now, with
Brown running for governor, both
parties see a chance for victory.
