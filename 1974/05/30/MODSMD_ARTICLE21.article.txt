The Speech and Language
Clinic at Stanford will offer
several group programs this
summer for preschoolers,
school-age children and adults
with communications problems.
Preschool and school age
programs will deal with
articulation, language enrichment,
visual-motor training,
language-perceptual-motor
training, and voice therapy. There
will also be a summer program for
deaf children, to improve their
lipreading, oral language and sign
language.
Ongoing parent observations
are a part of these programs.
Adult programs include a
stuttering group and voice
therapy. Each of the programs
runs for six or eight weeks,
meeting two to four times weekly.
Further information may be
obtained from the Speech and
Language Clinic at Stanford, 600
Willow Road, Palo Alto.
Interested persons may call
497-6751.
