# Prop. B Sparks Controversy
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
An initiative on the June 4
ballot providing for the creation
of a Palo Alto rent control board
has sparked controversy between
the Fair Rent Committee, which
favors the measure, and Citizens
Against Proposition B, which
opposes it.
The initiative would create a
rent control board that would
regulate rents and try to
encourage landlords to promote
high levels of maintenance.
According to Bradley Dowden,
committee president, the rent
control board would end rent
gouging by Palo Alto landlords
and encourage high standards of
maintenance while allowing
landlords to collect "reasonable
profits."
Dowden said that the board
would protect Stanford students
who live in the city from rents
that are becoming "increasingly
prohibitive."
According to Dowden, the
board would be elected directly
by the voters and would be
composed of a broad spectrum of
interests, insuring fairness to both
landlords and tenants.

Although opponents of the
proposition claim that a similar
measure in Berkeley was ruled
unconstitutional by a superior
court, Dowden claims that only
the provision for evictions was
declared invalid. He pointed out
that the Palo Alto measure
doesn't provide for protection
against evictions.
Dowden insisted that landlords
would not be driven out of
business by the measure because
the board would not set
unreasonable regulations.
He accused wealthy landlords
and real estate investors of
spending large sums of money to
launch a smear campaign against
the initiative.
Dowden said the board would
not be particularly difficult to
administer. He noted that it
would involve a considerable
amount of work, but he insisted
that the protection it would offer
the people would be worth the
task of administering it.
According to Dowden, the
board would drive speculators out
of the market in Palo Alto, but he
noted that they are few in
number. Claiming that the large

' majority of landlords in the city
r are not speculators, he said the
1 measure would not harm the
• economy of Palo Alto.
But Howard Lewis, president
; of Citizens Against Proposition B,
disagreed with Dowden, claiming
that the measure would have an
adverse affect on both landlords
and tenants in the city.
According to Lewis, the
measure is "well intended but
would inadvertently create a
machine for removing low income
housing from the market."
He explained that it would have
a "drastic effect on the Palo Alto
housing shortage" because it
would lower rents to a level that
would be intolerable to landlords,
and would create a huge and
unwieldy bureaucracy.
Lewis said that while the
initiative requires that rents be
rolled back to Jan. 1, 1973, it
would in effect lower them to the
level of Aug. 1971 because the
Nixon's Administration's
wage-price freeze of Aug. 1971
was in effect until early 1973.
'This has been a time of fierce
inflation," Lewis said. "It is
unrealistic to roll back rents to
the level they were at in 1971.
This cannot help but to put many
landlords in a severe crunch."
Lewis claimed also that the
board would require rent
adjustment hearings regarding
each of the 10,000 rental units in
Palo Alto.
Lewis said that many Palo Alto
families who rent rooms in their
homes to Stanford students would
be discouraged from staying in the
rental market, due to the
administrative problems that he
claimed the board would create.
Lewis added that many rental
units would be converted into
commercial property or
condominiums.

An initiative on the June 4
ballot providing for the creation
of a Palo Alto rent control board
has sparked controversy between
the Fair Rent Committee, which
favors the measure, and Citizens
Against Proposition B, which
opposes it.
The initiative would create a
rent control board that would
regulate rents and try to
encourage landlords to promote
high levels of maintenance.
According to Bradley Dowden,
committee president, the rent
control board would end rent
gouging by Palo Alto landlords
and encourage high standards of
maintenance while allowing
landlords to collect "reasonable
profits."
Dowden said that the board
would protect Stanford students
who live in the city from rents
that are becoming "increasingly
prohibitive."
According to Dowden, the
board would be elected directly
by the voters and would be
composed of a broad spectrum of
interests, insuring fairness to both
landlords and tenants.

Although opponents of the
proposition claim that a similar
measure in Berkeley was ruled
unconstitutional by a superior
court, Dowden claims that only
the provision for evictions was
declared invalid. He pointed out
that the Palo Alto measure
doesn't provide for protection
against evictions.
Dowden insisted that landlords
would not be driven out of
business by the measure because
the board would not set
unreasonable regulations.
He accused wealthy landlords
and real estate investors of
spending large sums of money to
launch a smear campaign against
the initiative.
Dowden said the board would
not be particularly difficult to
administer. He noted that it
would involve a considerable
amount of work, but he insisted
that the protection it would offer
the people would be worth the
task of administering it.
According to Dowden, the
board would drive speculators out
of the market in Palo Alto, but he
noted that they are few in
number. Claiming that the large

' majority of landlords in the city
r are not speculators, he said the
1 measure would not harm the
• economy of Palo Alto.
But Howard Lewis, president
; of Citizens Against Proposition B,
disagreed with Dowden, claiming
that the measure would have an
adverse affect on both landlords
and tenants in the city.
According to Lewis, the
measure is "well intended but
would inadvertently create a
machine for removing low income
housing from the market."
He explained that it would have
a "drastic effect on the Palo Alto
housing shortage" because it
would lower rents to a level that
would be intolerable to landlords,
and would create a huge and
unwieldy bureaucracy.
Lewis said that while the
initiative requires that rents be
rolled back to Jan. 1, 1973, it
would in effect lower them to the
level of Aug. 1971 because the
Nixon's Administration's
wage-price freeze of Aug. 1971
was in effect until early 1973.
'This has been a time of fierce
inflation," Lewis said. "It is
unrealistic to roll back rents to
the level they were at in 1971.
This cannot help but to put many
landlords in a severe crunch."
Lewis claimed also that the
board would require rent
adjustment hearings regarding
each of the 10,000 rental units in
Palo Alto.
Lewis said that many Palo Alto
families who rent rooms in their
homes to Stanford students would
be discouraged from staying in the
rental market, due to the
administrative problems that he
claimed the board would create.
Lewis added that many rental
units would be converted into
