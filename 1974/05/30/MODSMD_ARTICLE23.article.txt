Where can you store stuff for a brother or sister if he/she is going
to be a freshman next year and you are leaving Stanford this year?
M.A.
Bernadette Benjamin, administrative assistant for Lagunita and
coordinator of dorm storage room hours said that your best bet was
to "find a friend in Palo Alto" who could store your things.
She said that it was a general University policy not to store things
for incoming freshmen because of the lack of storage space.
Storage space is at such a premium that there are strict rules
governing who can and who cannot store things in University storage
spaces. Benjamin said that only students presently living in
University housing and assigned to University housing in the fall can
store things. Exceptions to this rule are students who are going
overseas and students presently in the University residence system
who were assigned off-campus in the Draw, and who are on housing
wait lists. These students may store things in Lagunita.
