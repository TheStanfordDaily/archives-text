UNDER INSPECTION? — These two young lovers, Klestakov and
Marya, played by Tom Glushko and Bonny Rodden, appear in a
production* of Gogol's The Inspector General, to be presented
Thursday through Saturday in the Arroyo lounge. Also appearing are
Duncan Proudt'oot as the mayor, and Tricia Crooke as the mayor's
wife. Admission is free. The plot centers around a man who bluffs the
bourgeoisie into thinking he is an inspector general.
