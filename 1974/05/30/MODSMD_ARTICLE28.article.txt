# Count Basie's Band Packs Paramount
## 
### DAN FORTE 
OAKLAND—It seems appropriate that on the date of Duke
Ellington's death, Friday, May 24, 1974, the great Count Basie would
play to a sell-out crowd at the Paramount Theater of the Arts.
After hearing the news of the Duke's death early that morning,
hundreds of jazz fans turned up at the Paramount trying to get tickets
to hear the Count, as a reminder of an era, and an art form, which has
just lost its leader.
Perhaps some were expecting to hear some sort of tribute or
dedication, but that was not to be the case. Backstage, it was
reported, Basie was so broken up that he had at first considered
cancelling his appearance.
When asked if thete would be any speeches or dedications, his
answer was simply "What can you say?" But, he added that he and his
band would be playing for only one man that night; "he was the
master of us all."
No words needed to be said when the Basie band played the Duke's
"Satin Doll" which, although it has been a standard in the Basie
repertoire for some time, held a very special significance on this
occasion, and received a tremendous ovation from the crowd.
The concert got off to a late start (because of the long lines), with
the Basie band in typically fine form; simple arrangements, sax solos,
brass accents.
As always, Basie was the understated leader, continually smiling,
making invisible signals to the band members, and only occasionally
soloing himself.
Among the band's superb selections were "Pretty Gal," "Body and
Soul," Frank Foster's "Shiny Stockings," "Poor Butterfly" (with a
fantastic trumpet solo by Paul Cohn), and "J) peak Low," featuring
tenor saxophonist Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis.
The Basic rhythm section, which has always beer the band's strong
point, still includes rhythm guitarist Freddie Green, who has been
with Basie almost from the beginning, and flashy drummer Sonny
Payne, twirling and juggling his sticks while never missing a beat.
Basie's set was followed by songstress Carmen Mcßae, backed by
her own trio, along with the Basie horns.
Her set was a big letdown after such a fine performance by the
Count, and consisted mostly of pop tunes ("The Summer knows,"
"You Are The Sunshine of My Life") with only one or two jazz
standards thrown in, like "Green Dolphin Street."
The high spirits Basie left with the audience were lost during her
numbers and didn't return until she was joined by the Count to close
the show with "Bye Bye Blackbird," the two shuffling off arm-in-arm
at the finale.

with Basie almost from the beginning, and flashy drummer Sonny

Her set was a big letdown after such a fine performance by the
Count, and consisted mostly of pop tunes ("The Summer knows,"

standards thrown in, like "Green Dolphin Street."

OAKLAND—It seems appropriate that on the date of Duke
Ellington's death, Friday, May 24, 1974, the great Count Basie would
play to a sell-out crowd at the Paramount Theater of the Arts.
After hearing the news of the Duke's death early that morning,
hundreds of jazz fans turned up at the Paramount trying to get tickets
to hear the Count, as a reminder of an era, and an art form, which has
just lost its leader.
Perhaps some were expecting to hear some sort of tribute or
dedication, but that was not to be the case. Backstage, it was
reported, Basie was so broken up that he had at first considered
cancelling his appearance.
When asked if thete would be any speeches or dedications, his
answer was simply "What can you say?" But, he added that he and his
band would be playing for only one man that night; "he was the
master of us all."
No words needed to be said when the Basie band played the Duke's
"Satin Doll" which, although it has been a standard in the Basie
repertoire for some time, held a very special significance on this
occasion, and received a tremendous ovation from the crowd.
The concert got off to a late start (because of the long lines), with
the Basie band in typically fine form; simple arrangements, sax solos,
brass accents.
As always, Basie was the understated leader, continually smiling,
making invisible signals to the band members, and only occasionally
soloing himself.
Among the band's superb selections were "Pretty Gal," "Body and
Soul," Frank Foster's "Shiny Stockings," "Poor Butterfly" (with a
fantastic trumpet solo by Paul Cohn), and "J) peak Low," featuring
tenor saxophonist Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis.
