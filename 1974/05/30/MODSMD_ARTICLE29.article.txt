# McLaughlin Plays 'Splendid Set'
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
SAN FRANCISCO—A string
quartet playing from printed
scores, two trumpet players, an
electric pianist with a voice like
Judy Collins, an electric bass
player, a crew-cut drummer
before a mountainous set of
equipment, a famed jazz musician
playing an electric baritone violin,
and the world's fastest and most
brilliant guitarist might not seem
to have much in common.
All were on stage together
Sunday night at Winterland when
the lightning-fingered John
McLaughlin led his Mahavishnu
Orchestra through a splendid set
of the most exciting music being
made anywhere today.
The ensemble's piece de
resistance, an hour-long "Hymn
to Him," employed every facet of
the diverse group in a piece that
can only be called incomparable.
The number began with a quiet
figure by the string quartet.
McLaughlin's electric guitar
accompaniment, at first barely

audible, grew gradually but
persistently into a blazing solo
that no other man could come
close to matching.
Worthwhile Solo
The intensity was broken for a
minute by a trumpet fugue, but
suddenly the band jumped into a
bluesy rhythm. Ralph Armstrong
gave one of the few really
worthwhile bass solos I have ever
heard: it was not only
worthwhile, it was superb.
Electric violinist Jean-Luc
Ponty, a veteran of Frank Zappa's
band and many years of jazz
performances, then tqok over
with a fine fifteen-minute solo
that was gradually joined by the
other musicians. Then the entire
group hit one exhilarating chord.
If Winterland had come
crashing down during the chord —
as it seemed likely to do, given the
incredible loudness of the 11
instruments — then the thousands
in the audience would certainly
have died in bliss.
"We believe there are no

barriers in music, there are only
barriers in peoples' minds,"
McLaughlin had told the crowd as
he introduced his new Orchestra.
By the time the string quartet
faded away with the last strains of
"Hymn to Him," plenty of mind
barriers had been cleared aside.
The all-new personnel (except,
of course, for McLaughlin) at first
may disappoint fans of the old
Orchestra: the group is now very
much McLaughlin's own. The
new group is not quite as tight as
the old, and pianist-synthesizer
player Jan Hammer is missed.
The new music is as thrilling as
any McLaughlin has made,
though, and the fine orchestration
of the 11-piece group adds
something new to the music.
No one can fault the ability of
the new musicians, either.
Drummer Michael Morgan, like
McLaughlin a disciple of India's
Sri Chinmoy, will not make
people forget the old drummer,
Billy Cobbam, but he gave a
strong solo and accompanied
McLaughlin's difficult rhythms
well.
Excellent Bass
Armstrong, an excellent find
for McLaughlin, is surely one of
the best electric bassists
performing, and Ponty's slashing
style fits well into the group's.
The rest of the musicians perform
capably, never interfering with
their leader's incredible solos.
The music has the same base as
the old Mahavishnu group's, but it
has been expanded to include
many styles of music. "Smile of
the Beyond," for instance,
featured a delicate vocal by
pianist Carol Moran that suddenly
became a crashing drum solo.
"Vision is a Naked Word"
included lush chromatic runs by
the strings, then a Ponty solo
featuring loud reverberation.
Just as the audience seemed
emotionally drained, McLaughlin
brought on "spiritual brother"
Carlos Santana for an encore
performance of John Coltrane's
"A Love Supreme." The two great

guitarists joined in incauitations of
"Om" and then added a pair of
intense solos.
Journey 'Driving'
It took a great performance by
the Mahavishnu Orchestra to
overshadow the efforts of
second-billed Journey, a five-man
band that seems destined to
become a star attraction in its
own right. Led by former Santana
guitarist Neal Schon and Zappa's
old drummer Aynsley Dunbar, the
group provided a solid hour and a
half of driving rock.
Schon's playing was brilliant
throughout and Dunbar gave a
great solo that was greeted by
loud roars of approva.l. Former
Santana member Greg Rollie on

keyboards and vocals was hardly
excellent, but he gives the band a
solid backbone.
One of the reasons the concert
lasted until 2 a.m. is that a third
group, the Tubes, were also on the
bill. They featured a lead singer
who first appeared with only his
head protruding from a salad on a
table. To the tune of "Look what
we're having for lunch," he
proceeded to devour huge pieces
of salad as he sang.
Another song featured his
flinging loaves of Wonder Bread
into the crowd. Perhaps the best
reflection on the Tubes' musical
quality is the fact that he recieved
most of the bread back — in his
face.

he introduced his new Orchestra.
By the time the string quartet
faded away with the last strains of
"Hymn to Him," plenty of mind
barriers had been cleared aside.
The all-new personnel (except,
of course, for McLaughlin) at first
may disappoint fans of the old
Orchestra: the group is now very
much McLaughlin's own. The
new group is not quite as tight as
the old, and pianist-synthesizer
player Jan Hammer is missed.
The new music is as thrilling as
any McLaughlin has made,
though, and the fine orchestration
of the 11-piece group adds
something new to the music.
No one can fault the ability of
the new musicians, either.
Drummer Michael Morgan, like
McLaughlin a disciple of India's
Sri Chinmoy, will not make
people forget the old drummer,
Billy Cobbam, but he gave a
strong solo and accompanied
McLaughlin's difficult rhythms
well.
Excellent Bass
Armstrong, an excellent find
for McLaughlin, is surely one of
the best electric bassists
performing, and Ponty's slashing
style fits well into the group's.
The rest of the musicians perform
capably, never interfering with
their leader's incredible solos.
The music has the same base as
the old Mahavishnu group's, but it
has been expanded to include
many styles of music. "Smile of
the Beyond," for instance,
featured a delicate vocal by
pianist Carol Moran that suddenly
became a crashing drum solo.
"Vision is a Naked Word"
included lush chromatic runs by
the strings, then a Ponty solo
featuring loud reverberation.
Just as the audience seemed
emotionally drained, McLaughlin
brought on "spiritual brother"
Carlos Santana for an encore
performance of John Coltrane's
"A Love Supreme." The two great

guitarists joined in incauitations of
"Om" and then added a pair of
intense solos.
Journey 'Driving'
It took a great performance by
the Mahavishnu Orchestra to
overshadow the efforts of
second-billed Journey, a five-man
band that seems destined to
become a star attraction in its
own right. Led by former Santana
guitarist Neal Schon and Zappa's
old drummer Aynsley Dunbar, the
group provided a solid hour and a
half of driving rock.
Schon's playing was brilliant
throughout and Dunbar gave a
great solo that was greeted by
loud roars of approva.l. Former
Santana member Greg Rollie on

keyboards and vocals was hardly
excellent, but he gives the band a
solid backbone.
One of the reasons the concert
lasted until 2 a.m. is that a third
group, the Tubes, were also on the
bill. They featured a lead singer
who first appeared with only his
head protruding from a salad on a
table. To the tune of "Look what
we're having for lunch," he
proceeded to devour huge pieces
of salad as he sang.
Another song featured his
flinging loaves of Wonder Bread
into the crowd. Perhaps the best
reflection on the Tubes' musical
quality is the fact that he recieved
most of the bread back — in his
face.
SAN FRANCISCO—A string
quartet playing from printed
scores, two trumpet players, an
electric pianist with a voice like
Judy Collins, an electric bass
player, a crew-cut drummer
before a mountainous set of
equipment, a famed jazz musician
playing an electric baritone violin,
and the world's fastest and most
brilliant guitarist might not seem
to have much in common.
All were on stage together
Sunday night at Winterland when
the lightning-fingered John
McLaughlin led his Mahavishnu
Orchestra through a splendid set
of the most exciting music being
made anywhere today.
The ensemble's piece de
resistance, an hour-long "Hymn
to Him," employed every facet of
the diverse group in a piece that
can only be called incomparable.
The number began with a quiet
figure by the string quartet.
McLaughlin's electric guitar
accompaniment, at first barely

audible, grew gradually but
persistently into a blazing solo
that no other man could come
close to matching.
Worthwhile Solo
The intensity was broken for a
minute by a trumpet fugue, but
suddenly the band jumped into a
bluesy rhythm. Ralph Armstrong
gave one of the few really
worthwhile bass solos I have ever
heard: it was not only
worthwhile, it was superb.
Electric violinist Jean-Luc
Ponty, a veteran of Frank Zappa's
band and many years of jazz
performances, then tqok over
with a fine fifteen-minute solo
that was gradually joined by the
other musicians. Then the entire
group hit one exhilarating chord.
If Winterland had come
crashing down during the chord —
as it seemed likely to do, given the
incredible loudness of the 11
instruments — then the thousands
in the audience would certainly
have died in bliss.

barriers in music, there are only
barriers in peoples' minds,"

intense solos.
Journey 'Driving'
It took a great performance by
the Mahavishnu Orchestra to
overshadow the efforts of
second-billed Journey, a five-man
band that seems destined to
become a star attraction in its
own right. Led by former Santana
guitarist Neal Schon and Zappa's
old drummer Aynsley Dunbar, the
group provided a solid hour and a
half of driving rock.
Schon's playing was brilliant
throughout and Dunbar gave a
great solo that was greeted by
loud roars of approva.l. Former
Santana member Greg Rollie on

keyboards and vocals was hardly
excellent, but he gives the band a
solid backbone.
One of the reasons the concert
lasted until 2 a.m. is that a third
group, the Tubes, were also on the
bill. They featured a lead singer
who first appeared with only his
head protruding from a salad on a
table. To the tune of "Look what
we're having for lunch," he
proceeded to devour huge pieces
of salad as he sang.
Another song featured his
flinging loaves of Wonder Bread
into the crowd. Perhaps the best
reflection on the Tubes' musical
quality is the fact that he recieved
most of the bread back — in his
face.
SAN FRANCISCO—A string
quartet playing from printed
scores, two trumpet players, an
electric pianist with a voice like
Judy Collins, an electric bass
player, a crew-cut drummer
before a mountainous set of
equipment, a famed jazz musician
playing an electric baritone violin,
and the world's fastest and most
brilliant guitarist might not seem
to have much in common.
All were on stage together
Sunday night at Winterland when
the lightning-fingered John
McLaughlin led his Mahavishnu
Orchestra through a splendid set
of the most exciting music being
made anywhere today.
The ensemble's piece de
resistance, an hour-long "Hymn
to Him," employed every facet of
the diverse group in a piece that
can only be called incomparable.
The number began with a quiet
figure by the string quartet.
McLaughlin's electric guitar
accompaniment, at first barely

audible, grew gradually but
persistently into a blazing solo
that no other man could come
close to matching.
Worthwhile Solo
The intensity was broken for a
minute by a trumpet fugue, but
suddenly the band jumped into a
bluesy rhythm. Ralph Armstrong
gave one of the few really
worthwhile bass solos I have ever
heard: it was not only
worthwhile, it was superb.
Electric violinist Jean-Luc
Ponty, a veteran of Frank Zappa's
band and many years of jazz
performances, then tqok over
with a fine fifteen-minute solo
that was gradually joined by the
other musicians. Then the entire
group hit one exhilarating chord.
If Winterland had come
crashing down during the chord —
as it seemed likely to do, given the
incredible loudness of the 11
instruments — then the thousands
in the audience would certainly
have died in bliss.
"We believe there are no

barriers in music, there are only
barriers in peoples' minds,"
McLaughlin had told the crowd as
he introduced his new Orchestra.
By the time the string quartet
faded away with the last strains of
"Hymn to Him," plenty of mind
barriers had been cleared aside.
The all-new personnel (except,
of course, for McLaughlin) at first
may disappoint fans of the old
Orchestra: the group is now very
much McLaughlin's own. The
new group is not quite as tight as
the old, and pianist-synthesizer
player Jan Hammer is missed.
The new music is as thrilling as
any McLaughlin has made,
though, and the fine orchestration
of the 11-piece group adds
something new to the music.
No one can fault the ability of
the new musicians, either.
Drummer Michael Morgan, like
McLaughlin a disciple of India's
Sri Chinmoy, will not make
people forget the old drummer,
Billy Cobbam, but he gave a
strong solo and accompanied
McLaughlin's difficult rhythms
well.
Excellent Bass
Armstrong, an excellent find
for McLaughlin, is surely one of
the best electric bassists
performing, and Ponty's slashing
style fits well into the group's.
The rest of the musicians perform
capably, never interfering with
their leader's incredible solos.
The music has the same base as
the old Mahavishnu group's, but it
has been expanded to include
many styles of music. "Smile of
the Beyond," for instance,
featured a delicate vocal by
pianist Carol Moran that suddenly
became a crashing drum solo.
"Vision is a Naked Word"
included lush chromatic runs by
the strings, then a Ponty solo
featuring loud reverberation.
Just as the audience seemed
emotionally drained, McLaughlin
brought on "spiritual brother"
Carlos Santana for an encore
performance of John Coltrane's
"A Love Supreme." The two great

guitarists joined in incauitations of
"Om" and then added a pair of
intense solos.
