# Hayden Claims War Isn't Over
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
Anti-war activist Tom Hayden,
speaking before a crowd of 400 at
Memorial Church last evening, said
that "the war is continuing in
Indochina despite what the
government has been telling you."
The address was sponsored by the
Committee to Bring Nguyen Huu Thai
to Stanford in conjunction with the
Week of Concern for Indochina.
Noting the "remarkable"
propaganda campaign underway telling
the American people that the war in
Indochina is over, Hayden explained
that the government "can't manipulate
the existence of that war." He
attributed this campaign to what he
termed "Kissinger's doctrine of the
avertive gaze."
Hayden said that this doctrine
endeavored to "take the minds of the
American people off of what is really
going on." In spite of that, he
continued, "the substance (of the war)
is still there."
South Vietnam and Cambodia are
just "other examples of the use of
technological breakthroughs to try to
get around insurgents and guerrillas,"
declared Hayden. He cited the
Computer Science Corp. of Los
Angeles as a case in point.

This company, Hayden said, is
responsible for the "creation of a
computerized intelligence system that
enables the police to keep records on
huge numbers of people." In South
Vietnam alone, "11.5 million people
or nearly the entire adult population
of the country are recorded by this
system."
Hayden added that this system is
now being implemented for use by the
FBI and by authorities in California.
"South Vietnam is a showcase for
the attempts at control of
revolutionaries in the third world,"
emphasized Hayden.
'There has never been a minute of
peace in South Vietnam. In fact, we
can't even ask whether a third war has
started in Indochina because the
second war hasn't stopped yet," added
Hayden.
The commitment of the U.S. to
Indochina is continuing, said Hayden.
He compared South Vietnam "to a
small island that has been battered by
[American] intervention 011 a inasoivi'
scale."
The reasons behind the U.S.
involvement are diverse. Hayden
commented that behind the economic,
political, and military rationales that
"U.S. involvement in Indochina said
something about the character of
American society."
The U.S. is still heavily committed
to Indochina because "it has become
the focal point of a major conflict
between the colonial powers of the
West and the new national movements
of the third world," intoned Hayden.
The war in Indochina will "be a
long struggle," Hayden declared. The
perspective in which the war was
fought is important not just for the
combatants but "for the people who
struggled against it. These are the

people who must write its history," he
continued.
Documents such as the Pentagon
Papers and the Oval Office transcripts
attest to "the effectiveness of the
peace movement in those years [the
late 19605]," commented Hayden. He
cited the end of the draft, the
dramatic change in the tenor of the
Democratic party, and the conversion
of Daniel Ellsberg as examples of the
changes wrought by the movement.
The stakes involved in the war are
high said Hayden. "Our interpretation
of the war after the war may be as
important as stopping the war itself,"
he continued. In the final analysis,
"the struggle for peace is a struggle for
independence in America,"he
concluded.

The stakes involved in the war are
high said Hayden. "Our interpretation
of the war after the war may be as
important as stopping the war itself,"

"the struggle for peace is a struggle for

ANTI-WAR ACTIVIST — Movement veteran Tom Hayden told a Stanford
audience last night that the war in Indochina is not yet over, and that U.S.
presence still remains.
Anti-war activist Tom Hayden,
speaking before a crowd of 400 at
Memorial Church last evening, said
that "the war is continuing in
Indochina despite what the
government has been telling you."
The address was sponsored by the
Committee to Bring Nguyen Huu Thai
to Stanford in conjunction with the
Week of Concern for Indochina.
Noting the "remarkable"
propaganda campaign underway telling
the American people that the war in
Indochina is over, Hayden explained
that the government "can't manipulate
the existence of that war." He
attributed this campaign to what he
termed "Kissinger's doctrine of the
avertive gaze."
Hayden said that this doctrine
endeavored to "take the minds of the
American people off of what is really
going on." In spite of that, he
continued, "the substance (of the war)
is still there."
South Vietnam and Cambodia are
just "other examples of the use of
technological breakthroughs to try to
get around insurgents and guerrillas,"
declared Hayden. He cited the
Computer Science Corp. of Los
Angeles as a case in point.

This company, Hayden said, is
responsible for the "creation of a
computerized intelligence system that
enables the police to keep records on
huge numbers of people." In South
Vietnam alone, "11.5 million people
or nearly the entire adult population
of the country are recorded by this
system."
Hayden added that this system is
now being implemented for use by the
FBI and by authorities in California.
"South Vietnam is a showcase for
the attempts at control of
revolutionaries in the third world,"
emphasized Hayden.
'There has never been a minute of
peace in South Vietnam. In fact, we
can't even ask whether a third war has
started in Indochina because the
second war hasn't stopped yet," added
Hayden.
The commitment of the U.S. to
Indochina is continuing, said Hayden.
He compared South Vietnam "to a
small island that has been battered by
[American] intervention 011 a inasoivi'
scale."
The reasons behind the U.S.
involvement are diverse. Hayden
commented that behind the economic,
political, and military rationales that
"U.S. involvement in Indochina said
something about the character of
American society."
The U.S. is still heavily committed
to Indochina because "it has become
the focal point of a major conflict
between the colonial powers of the
West and the new national movements
of the third world," intoned Hayden.
The war in Indochina will "be a
long struggle," Hayden declared. The
perspective in which the war was
fought is important not just for the
combatants but "for the people who
struggled against it. These are the

people who must write its history," he
continued.
Documents such as the Pentagon
Papers and the Oval Office transcripts
attest to "the effectiveness of the
peace movement in those years [the
late 19605]," commented Hayden. He
cited the end of the draft, the
dramatic change in the tenor of the
Democratic party, and the conversion
of Daniel Ellsberg as examples of the
changes wrought by the movement.
The stakes involved in the war are
high said Hayden. "Our interpretation
of the war after the war may be as
