THE FRANCESCO TRIO -
Stanford's ensemble-in-residence
captured the Naumburg Award
for ensemble chamber music last
week in New York. The trio
shares the award with the
American String Quartet from the
Juilliard School of Music. The
members of the trio are David
Abel, violin; Bonnie Hampton,
cello; and Nathan Schwartz,
piano. The trio will be granted a
recital in New York next April
and will receive $3000 toward
commissioning a new work.
