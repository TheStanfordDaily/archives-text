# Players Attempt To Revive Women's Volleyball Program
## 
### SUZANNE SAUNDERS 
"There is an incredible demand
for women's volleyball and
Stanford is failing to see it,"says
Barbara Finn, vice president of
Stanford's Women's Recreation
Association. "If a good program
were developed, more women
would play."
But it's been five years since a
women's volleyball class was
offered at Stanford. According to
Pamela Strathairn, chairman of
the women's physical education
department, (WPE), volleyball was
dumped in the competition for
staff, funds, and facilities when
class enrollments diminished. The
sport has since acquired the lower
priority distinction of "recreation
volleyball."
The men's physical education
department now offers five coed
volleyball classes on the Encina
courts. Speaking for women who
want a program of their own,
Finn calls the coed system
"totally irrelevant to our needs."
Bad habits develop, Finn says,
when she and her teammates play
outdoors where they can't hit the
ground and fall properly. Another
problem she noted is that the
Encina court nets are eight feet
high, six inches above women's
regulation nets.
Two years ago, Finn, now a
junior at Stanford, and her
colleagues formed their own team
and joined the U.S. Volleyball
Association (USVBA). This began
what they remember as a series of
thwarted attempts to acquire
Stanford sponsorship and
intercollegiate team status.
Many Problems
"Everything was going against
us," recalls Marianne Hallisey, a
sophomore who quit the team
after a year. Their coach was not a
Stanford staff member, several
team members were not Stanford
students and there was nobody in
WPE to champion their cause.
Despite hardships, Finn's group
has held together, calling itself the
Stanford team. Earlier this month,
seven members played in the
USVBA national competition in
Tennessee, where they placed
17th in a field of 34 women's
teams.
Because of their non-affiliated,
independent status, team

members must provide their own
funds. However, the cost of
association dues, uniforms,
tournament fees, transportation,
room and board has put the team
$900 in debt.
In addition to the lack of
money, team members get no
academic credit and their
practices are frequently disrupted
by basketball players competing
with the team for recreation time
in the women's gym.
For Hallisey, the inconvenient
practice hours were the last straw.
"You missed dinner," she said.
"You got home at 7:30 and ate a
sack dinner, You were exhausted,
and then you had to study. It was
terrible."
Unsatisfactory
Now playing with a coed
intramural team, Hallisey still
finds the situation unsatisfactory.
"I really miss playing with women
and playing on women's nets. On
the men's net, we always have to
compensate and go to setting or
doing a different task. I'm a spiker
and I can never spike now. It's so
frustrating."
Dr. Wesley Ruff, who teaches
coed volleyball, says that the
women in his classes seem happy
with the present set-up. However,
only 17 of the 144 students
enrolled in the coed classes are
female. Finn says this small
number of women playing coed
volleyball doesn't indicate lack of
demand for all-women classes and
an intercollegiate team.
Nonetheless, Strathairn insists
that before WPE allocates the
$7000 necessary for a complete
women's volleyball program, "we
need a full demonstration that

women will commit themselves."
So far, she says, "There has not
been sufficient enrollment
demands through signups for
[coed | classes to warrant both
departments offering class
instruction."
Strathairn said she would like
to see 25 to 30 women enroll in
the coed volleyball system before
implementing an all-women
program. Though she does not see
sufficient demand now, she stated,
"I'm certain that we will have an
intercollegiate women's volleyball
team before five years pass."
Take-Over Class
In the interim, Strathairn
deemed it "absolutely crucial"
that women take it upon
themselves to advance register and
effectively convert a coed class
into an all-female one. This, she
implied, would prove their
commitment.
She also advises women to
organize and apply for club sport
status. Club sports receive some
financial support and are eligible
for better practice hours.
But, according to William
(Dutch) Fehring, director of
intramurals and club sports, the
requirement that a club sport have
at least 20 members, all affiliated
with Stanford, makes Finn's team
ineligible.
'No Problem'
Ruff, said, "It should be no
problem for women to achieve
club sport status" in volleyball.
He also said he would have
offered an all-women volleyball
class this quarter if only he had
known that there was a demand.
"If women want a volleyball
program, I don't see why they
can't have one."
Ruff says he hopes to change
the nets in Maples Pavillion this
summer so they can easily be
adjusted to different heights. The
Maples courts then would be
available he said, for women's
regulation volleyball practice.
Ruff asks that all women
interested in volleyball instruction
contact him so he can better
respond to their needs. Strathairn
supported this approach. She said,
"It would be tremendous" if the
switch could be made within the
men's department, in order to
"avoid unnecessary duplication."

For Hallisey, the inconvenient
practice hours were the last straw.
"You missed dinner," she said.
"You got home at 7:30 and ate a
sack dinner, You were exhausted,
and then you had to study. It was
terrible."
Unsatisfactory
Now playing with a coed
intramural team, Hallisey still
finds the situation unsatisfactory.
"I really miss playing with women
and playing on women's nets. On
the men's net, we always have to
compensate and go to setting or
doing a different task. I'm a spiker
and I can never spike now. It's so
frustrating."
Dr. Wesley Ruff, who teaches
coed volleyball, says that the
women in his classes seem happy
with the present set-up. However,
only 17 of the 144 students
enrolled in the coed classes are
female. Finn says this small
number of women playing coed
volleyball doesn't indicate lack of
demand for all-women classes and
an intercollegiate team.
Nonetheless, Strathairn insists
that before WPE allocates the
$7000 necessary for a complete
women's volleyball program, "we
need a full demonstration that

women will commit themselves."
So far, she says, "There has not
been sufficient enrollment
demands through signups for
[coed | classes to warrant both
departments offering class
instruction."
Strathairn said she would like
to see 25 to 30 women enroll in
the coed volleyball system before
implementing an all-women
program. Though she does not see
sufficient demand now, she stated,
"I'm certain that we will have an
intercollegiate women's volleyball
team before five years pass."
Take-Over Class
In the interim, Strathairn
deemed it "absolutely crucial"
that women take it upon
themselves to advance register and
effectively convert a coed class
into an all-female one. This, she
implied, would prove their
commitment.
She also advises women to
organize and apply for club sport
status. Club sports receive some
financial support and are eligible
for better practice hours.
But, according to William
(Dutch) Fehring, director of
intramurals and club sports, the
requirement that a club sport have
at least 20 members, all affiliated
with Stanford, makes Finn's team
ineligible.
'No Problem'
Ruff, said, "It should be no
problem for women to achieve
club sport status" in volleyball.
He also said he would have
offered an all-women volleyball
class this quarter if only he had
known that there was a demand.
"If women want a volleyball
program, I don't see why they
can't have one."
Ruff says he hopes to change
the nets in Maples Pavillion this
summer so they can easily be
adjusted to different heights. The
Maples courts then would be
available he said, for women's
regulation volleyball practice.
Ruff asks that all women
interested in volleyball instruction
contact him so he can better
respond to their needs. Strathairn
supported this approach. She said,
"It would be tremendous" if the
switch could be made within the
men's department, in order to
"avoid unnecessary duplication."

ON THEIR OWN — Members of Stanford's women's volleyball team
await play during its loss to Oakland YMCA last month at Maples. The
players here receive neither academic credit nor expense money from
the University.
"There is an incredible demand
for women's volleyball and
Stanford is failing to see it,"says
Barbara Finn, vice president of
Stanford's Women's Recreation
Association. "If a good program
were developed, more women
would play."
But it's been five years since a
women's volleyball class was
offered at Stanford. According to
Pamela Strathairn, chairman of
the women's physical education
department, (WPE), volleyball was
dumped in the competition for
staff, funds, and facilities when
class enrollments diminished. The
sport has since acquired the lower
priority distinction of "recreation
volleyball."
The men's physical education
department now offers five coed
volleyball classes on the Encina
courts. Speaking for women who
want a program of their own,
Finn calls the coed system
"totally irrelevant to our needs."
Bad habits develop, Finn says,
when she and her teammates play
outdoors where they can't hit the
ground and fall properly. Another
problem she noted is that the
Encina court nets are eight feet
high, six inches above women's
regulation nets.
Two years ago, Finn, now a
junior at Stanford, and her
colleagues formed their own team
and joined the U.S. Volleyball
Association (USVBA). This began
what they remember as a series of
thwarted attempts to acquire
Stanford sponsorship and
intercollegiate team status.
Many Problems
"Everything was going against
us," recalls Marianne Hallisey, a
sophomore who quit the team
after a year. Their coach was not a
Stanford staff member, several
team members were not Stanford
students and there was nobody in
WPE to champion their cause.
Despite hardships, Finn's group
has held together, calling itself the
Stanford team. Earlier this month,
seven members played in the
USVBA national competition in
Tennessee, where they placed
17th in a field of 34 women's
teams.
Because of their non-affiliated,
independent status, team

members must provide their own
funds. However, the cost of
association dues, uniforms,
tournament fees, transportation,
room and board has put the team
$900 in debt.
In addition to the lack of
money, team members get no
academic credit and their
practices are frequently disrupted
by basketball players competing
with the team for recreation time
in the women's gym.
For Hallisey, the inconvenient
practice hours were the last straw.
"You missed dinner," she said.
"You got home at 7:30 and ate a

problem for women to achieve
club sport status" in volleyball.
He also said he would have
offered an all-women volleyball
class this quarter if only he had
known that there was a demand.
"If women want a volleyball
program, I don't see why they
can't have one."
Ruff says he hopes to change
the nets in Maples Pavillion this
summer so they can easily be
adjusted to different heights. The
Maples courts then would be
available he said, for women's
regulation volleyball practice.
Ruff asks that all women
interested in volleyball instruction
contact him so he can better
respond to their needs. Strathairn
supported this approach. She said,
"It would be tremendous" if the
switch could be made within the
men's department, in order to
"avoid unnecessary duplication."

ON THEIR OWN — Members of Stanford's women's volleyball team
await play during its loss to Oakland YMCA last month at Maples. The
players here receive neither academic credit nor expense money from
the University.
"There is an incredible demand
for women's volleyball and
Stanford is failing to see it,"says
Barbara Finn, vice president of
Stanford's Women's Recreation
Association. "If a good program
were developed, more women
would play."
But it's been five years since a
women's volleyball class was
offered at Stanford. According to
Pamela Strathairn, chairman of
the women's physical education
department, (WPE), volleyball was
dumped in the competition for
staff, funds, and facilities when
class enrollments diminished. The
sport has since acquired the lower
priority distinction of "recreation
volleyball."
The men's physical education
department now offers five coed
volleyball classes on the Encina
courts. Speaking for women who
want a program of their own,
Finn calls the coed system
"totally irrelevant to our needs."
Bad habits develop, Finn says,
when she and her teammates play
outdoors where they can't hit the
ground and fall properly. Another
problem she noted is that the
Encina court nets are eight feet
high, six inches above women's
regulation nets.
Two years ago, Finn, now a
junior at Stanford, and her
colleagues formed their own team
and joined the U.S. Volleyball
Association (USVBA). This began
what they remember as a series of
thwarted attempts to acquire
Stanford sponsorship and
intercollegiate team status.
Many Problems
"Everything was going against
us," recalls Marianne Hallisey, a
sophomore who quit the team
after a year. Their coach was not a
Stanford staff member, several
team members were not Stanford
students and there was nobody in
WPE to champion their cause.
Despite hardships, Finn's group
has held together, calling itself the
Stanford team. Earlier this month,
seven members played in the
USVBA national competition in
Tennessee, where they placed
17th in a field of 34 women's
teams.
Because of their non-affiliated,
independent status, team

members must provide their own
funds. However, the cost of
association dues, uniforms,
tournament fees, transportation,
room and board has put the team
$900 in debt.
In addition to the lack of
money, team members get no
academic credit and their
practices are frequently disrupted
by basketball players competing
with the team for recreation time
in the women's gym.
For Hallisey, the inconvenient
practice hours were the last straw.
"You missed dinner," she said.
"You got home at 7:30 and ate a
sack dinner, You were exhausted,
and then you had to study. It was
terrible."
Unsatisfactory
Now playing with a coed
intramural team, Hallisey still
finds the situation unsatisfactory.
"I really miss playing with women
and playing on women's nets. On
the men's net, we always have to
compensate and go to setting or
doing a different task. I'm a spiker
and I can never spike now. It's so
frustrating."
Dr. Wesley Ruff, who teaches
coed volleyball, says that the
women in his classes seem happy
with the present set-up. However,
only 17 of the 144 students
enrolled in the coed classes are
female. Finn says this small
number of women playing coed
volleyball doesn't indicate lack of
demand for all-women classes and
an intercollegiate team.
Nonetheless, Strathairn insists
that before WPE allocates the
$7000 necessary for a complete
women's volleyball program, "we
need a full demonstration that

women will commit themselves."
So far, she says, "There has not
been sufficient enrollment
demands through signups for
[coed | classes to warrant both
departments offering class
instruction."
Strathairn said she would like
to see 25 to 30 women enroll in
the coed volleyball system before
implementing an all-women
program. Though she does not see
sufficient demand now, she stated,
"I'm certain that we will have an
intercollegiate women's volleyball
team before five years pass."
Take-Over Class
In the interim, Strathairn
deemed it "absolutely crucial"
that women take it upon
themselves to advance register and
effectively convert a coed class
into an all-female one. This, she
implied, would prove their
commitment.
She also advises women to
organize and apply for club sport
status. Club sports receive some
financial support and are eligible
for better practice hours.
But, according to William
(Dutch) Fehring, director of
intramurals and club sports, the
requirement that a club sport have
at least 20 members, all affiliated
with Stanford, makes Finn's team
ineligible.
'No Problem'
Ruff, said, "It should be no
problem for women to achieve
club sport status" in volleyball.
He also said he would have
offered an all-women volleyball
