# NCAA Spot To Goethals

### 
Freshman Glenn Goethals
earned a spot in the NCAA golf
championships Tuesday as
Stanford concluded an 8-1 season
at Cypress Point Country Club in
Monterey.
Goethals fired a six-over par 78
while classmate Brent Murray
carded an 80. The two players
were involved in a 36-hole playoff
for the fifth spot in Stanford's
NCAA lineup. In the opening 18
at San Francisco Club, Goethals
shot 76 to Murray's 78.
Tuesday, George Pettinger's 73

All-Stars.
Stanford, currently the 10th
ranked team in Golf World's
collegiate poll, will take a
three-week break before
competing in the NCAA's at San
Diego June 19-22.
