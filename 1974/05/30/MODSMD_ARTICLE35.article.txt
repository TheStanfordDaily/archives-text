# Three Solid Cagers To Enroll At Stanford
## 
### 
Three solid high school players
and possibly a junior college
standout will enroll at Stanford
this fall following a somewhat
disappointing basketball recruiting
campaign.
Dick Dohrmann, a 6-8 forward
from Menlo School, 6-7 forward
Mark Fitzner from San Diego and
Jay Carter, a 6-4 guard from
Dayton, Ohio, "will all be leading
players in the seasons ahead,"
according to head coach Howie
Dallmar.
However, two genuine "blue
chip" stars, guard Ray Townsend
and forward Marvin Thomas, both
decided to forego the Farm for
the more ostentatious
surroundings of UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion.
A third "blue chipper" is still
considering Stanford, while a solid
junior college performer will
enroll here pending a decision by
the admissions office in July.
Of the three high school stars

who have already signed letters of
intent, Fitzner seems most likely
to fit in immediately in Stanford's
varsity plans. He averaged better
than 23 points a game at Patrick
Henry High School in San Diego
and was named San Diego area
player of the year. "A pure
shooter," according to assistant
coach Bub Bowling, Fitzner may
see spot duty at forward next
winter.
At the basketball banquet held
last night at Ming's restaurant,
Rich Kelley was unanimously
named most valuable player for
the 1973-74 season, while Melvin
Arterberrv was voted most
inspirational player.
