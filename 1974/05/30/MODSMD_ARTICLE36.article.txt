An open letter to Lowell Berry and the New Founders League:
Dear Mr. Bern',
I looked with some interest on your satirical cartoon in your
newspaper Stanford's Direction, urging the reinstatement of the
Stanford Indian mascot.
Your accompanying letter, sent to 20 members of the Daily staff,
noted that publishing the cartoon "just might be the means of getting
back the Stanford Indian."
To some extent, 1 sympathize with your cause. But your group's
methods are far from the way.
The cartoon is an interesting satire of President Richard Lyman,
swatting away the Indian with a stroke of his broomstick.
The rest of the cartoon portrays white short-haired Stanford men
with cap, gown and feather, and Stanford women in the old
feather-headed Dolly uniforms. They are asking "Dr. Lyman, please
give us back our Stanford Indian."
The caricatures are almost painfully out-of-date stereotypes, but
still, I can tolerate them as symbols of your era. The accompanying
article notes "why not let good humor and tradition prevail?"
Indeed, why not? I agree that is disruptive to deny alumni their
mascot, just as many of today's students years from now, would be
disturbed if the University proclaimed by edict that, due to
complaints, the Band would no longer be able to assemble in any
formation not approved by a strict board of censors.
And then, just as I was becoming sympathetic, if not agreeable, my
eyes caught an article on the same page.
"Is it appropriate that Stanford continue to allow an organization
of homosexuals, such as the Gay Students Union, on our campus?,"
it asked.
'The New Founders League thinks not. Shouldn't Stanford
promote the dignity of its students, rather than permitting the
organization of a group which promotes sexual deviancy?"
I won't even begin to say what is wrong with your "innocent"
rhetorical questions.
But Mr. Berry, you ask us, who are directly involved with Stanford
today, not only to tolerate you, but to accept your stereotypes.
And then you and your group, not on the campus today, refuse
even to tolerate a group of students who you will never even see.
