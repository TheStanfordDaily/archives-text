British Resume Ulster Rule
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — The British
government resumed direct rule of Northern Ireland
yesterday following a 15-day general strike that
toppled the moderate provincial government.
The government's action came hours after the
Ulster Workers' Council, a hardline Protestant
group, ended the strike that brought the province to
the brink of economic collapse. Thousands of
strikers content with bringing down the government
returned to work before the walkout was called off.
The British government took over responsibility
for running the province by suspending for four
months the Northern Ireland Assembly, the
provincial parliament that retained the last vestige
of home rule powers in the province.
The province's executive, a coalition of moderate
Protestant and Roman Catholic politicians under
Chief Executive Brian Faulkner, resigned Tuesday as
the strike brought life in Northern Ireland to a
standstill.
By suspending the assembly and taking over the
administration of the province the British hoped to
give Merlyn Rees, the Cabinet minister responsible
for the province, time to try and work out another
attempt at power sharing between the Protestant
majority and the Roman Catholics. At the outset,
his prospects appeared poor.
The Ulster Workers' Council, which organized
the strike in opposition to the power-sharing
agreement, threatened to resume the shutdown
unless the British government acceeded to its
demands.
Initial Watergate Inquiry Ends
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary
Committee yesterday completed the initial phase of
its investigation of President Nixon's role in
Watergate and its chief impeachment counsel
described the case as "of extreme seriousness."
But John Doar cautioned against making any
judgments "until we have considered all the
evidence."
His assessment of the case presented so far was
concurred in by Albert Jenner, minority counsel for
the impeachment inquiry, who said, "I think what
has been presented to the committee up to this
moment is of extreme seriousness for the
Constitution and institutions of the country."
The committee completed this phase after its
eighth day of listening to evidence in closed session.
Chairman Peter W. Rodino emphasized at a
briefing after the closed session that the panel's
investigation of the Watergate cover-up is not
complete. He said additional evidence including
testimony from witnesses will be received later.
Earlier, James D. St. Clair, the President's chief
Watergate lawyer, suggested that the committee
ought to hear the entire Watergate case before
moving on to other areas such as the ITT antitrust
settlement and political contributions from dairy
cooperatives.

Italians Protest Bombing
ROME — Left-wing extremists stormed rightist
targets across Italy with bombs, bricks and iron
bolts yesterday in retaliation for a terrorist bombing
in Brescia.
Millions of Italians took part in strikes and
peaceful rallies in a massive display of mourning for
the Brescia victims, listed by police as six dead and
100 injured. As the day wore on the protests turned
ugly.
Chief targets of the attacks, reported by the
police in at least 20 cities, were the offices and
workers of Italy's Neo-Fascist party, the Italian
Social Movement.
But the Christian Democrats, Italy's dominant
party which along with the Social Movement fought
against divorce in the recent national referendum,
also came under assault.
Police kept up their hunt for those responsible
for the Brescia bombing, which occurred Tuesday
during an anti-Fascist rally in the northern industrial
city.
ITT Prosecutors Resign
WASHINGTON — Two lawyers on the Watergate
prosecution team investigating the ITT case resigned
yesterday. Their impending departure, following the
resignation of their task force chief, will leave the
team without a lawyer who has worked on the case
full time.
A spokesman for Special Watergate Prosecutor
Leon Jaworski announced that Lawrence Austin
Hammond, 28, will leave the task force sometime in
August. He said Paul R. Hober, 31, quit effective
sometime next week.
Earlier in the day, Jaworski named Richard J.
Davis as the successor to Joseph J. Connolly, who
resigned Friday as head of the team in protest of a
decision to allow former Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kelindienst to plead guilty to a misdemeanor in the
case.
A source in the prosecutor's office said Connolly
wanted Kleindienst charged with perjury.
The testimony in question related to the effort
to locate the 1972 Republican national convention
in San Diego, »a pledge by ITT to underwrite the
affair and possible links with the settlement of
antitrust suits involving the giant conglomerate.
Unrest Troubles Portuguese Head
LISBON, Portugal — President Antonio de
Spinola warned yesterday that
"counterrevolutionary forces" were trying to ruin
the new Portuguese government with a campaign of
labor unrest leading to anarchy.
"It is time for every Portuguese to conclude by
himself that any form of anarchy ends fatally and
opens the door to new dictatorships, to regimes like
the one overthrown April 25," Spinola said in a
speech during a brief visit to the northern industrial
city of Oporto.
Aiming his warning mainly at extreme leftists
who have fomented an epidemic of wildcat strikes
in the first days of the new government, Spinola

said the armed forces that overthrew the old rightist
regime would reply to violence with force "without
hesitation."
The 64-year-old general, who took over the
presidency four weeks ago, said
counterrevolutionaries were active in several parts of
the nation.
Sources close to the government said he was not
referring to any particular area and not to the
possibility of a countercoup by ultrarightists. They
said the warning was directed at elements of the
extreme left who have agitated and brought on a
series of labor disputes and demonstrations.
Business Index Slips
WASHINGTON — The government reported
yesterday that its composite of business indicators
slipped in April after three months of solid advance.
The Commerce Department said its index of
leading indicators declined seven-tenths of one
percent, mainly because workers were putting in
shorter weeks.
The decline was the first since December and the
third in a year. The index had climbed 4.3 percent
this year before faltering.
The Commerce Department report, which is
designed to offer clues on the future of the
economy, came a day after President Nixon's
economists forecast that business activity will
quicken and inflation will ease in the second half of
the year.
The faltering index was not necessarily
inconsistent with the predictions, since the Council
of Economic Advisers had said the economy would
probably remain in essentially its current state
through June.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through today but coastal low clouds
spreading inland locally night and morning. Slightly
warmer today. High temperatures today in the low
60s near the coast and in the upper 60s and 70s
inland.

British Resume Ulster Rule
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — The British
government resumed direct rule of Northern Ireland
yesterday following a 15-day general strike that
toppled the moderate provincial government.
The government's action came hours after the
Ulster Workers' Council, a hardline Protestant
group, ended the strike that brought the province to
the brink of economic collapse. Thousands of
strikers content with bringing down the government
returned to work before the walkout was called off.
The British government took over responsibility
for running the province by suspending for four
months the Northern Ireland Assembly, the
provincial parliament that retained the last vestige
of home rule powers in the province.
The province's executive, a coalition of moderate
Protestant and Roman Catholic politicians under
Chief Executive Brian Faulkner, resigned Tuesday as
the strike brought life in Northern Ireland to a
standstill.
By suspending the assembly and taking over the
administration of the province the British hoped to
give Merlyn Rees, the Cabinet minister responsible
for the province, time to try and work out another
attempt at power sharing between the Protestant
majority and the Roman Catholics. At the outset,
his prospects appeared poor.
The Ulster Workers' Council, which organized
the strike in opposition to the power-sharing
agreement, threatened to resume the shutdown
unless the British government acceeded to its
demands.
Initial Watergate Inquiry Ends
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary
Committee yesterday completed the initial phase of
its investigation of President Nixon's role in
Watergate and its chief impeachment counsel
described the case as "of extreme seriousness."
But John Doar cautioned against making any
judgments "until we have considered all the
evidence."
His assessment of the case presented so far was
concurred in by Albert Jenner, minority counsel for
the impeachment inquiry, who said, "I think what
has been presented to the committee up to this
moment is of extreme seriousness for the
Constitution and institutions of the country."
The committee completed this phase after its
eighth day of listening to evidence in closed session.
Chairman Peter W. Rodino emphasized at a
briefing after the closed session that the panel's
investigation of the Watergate cover-up is not
complete. He said additional evidence including
testimony from witnesses will be received later.
Earlier, James D. St. Clair, the President's chief
Watergate lawyer, suggested that the committee
ought to hear the entire Watergate case before
moving on to other areas such as the ITT antitrust
settlement and political contributions from dairy
cooperatives.

Italians Protest Bombing
ROME — Left-wing extremists stormed rightist
targets across Italy with bombs, bricks and iron
bolts yesterday in retaliation for a terrorist bombing
in Brescia.
Millions of Italians took part in strikes and
peaceful rallies in a massive display of mourning for
the Brescia victims, listed by police as six dead and
100 injured. As the day wore on the protests turned
ugly.
Chief targets of the attacks, reported by the
police in at least 20 cities, were the offices and
workers of Italy's Neo-Fascist party, the Italian
Social Movement.
But the Christian Democrats, Italy's dominant
party which along with the Social Movement fought
against divorce in the recent national referendum,
also came under assault.
Police kept up their hunt for those responsible
for the Brescia bombing, which occurred Tuesday
during an anti-Fascist rally in the northern industrial
city.
ITT Prosecutors Resign
WASHINGTON — Two lawyers on the Watergate
prosecution team investigating the ITT case resigned
yesterday. Their impending departure, following the
resignation of their task force chief, will leave the
team without a lawyer who has worked on the case
full time.
A spokesman for Special Watergate Prosecutor
Leon Jaworski announced that Lawrence Austin
Hammond, 28, will leave the task force sometime in
August. He said Paul R. Hober, 31, quit effective
sometime next week.
Earlier in the day, Jaworski named Richard J.
Davis as the successor to Joseph J. Connolly, who
resigned Friday as head of the team in protest of a
decision to allow former Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kelindienst to plead guilty to a misdemeanor in the
case.
A source in the prosecutor's office said Connolly
wanted Kleindienst charged with perjury.
The testimony in question related to the effort
to locate the 1972 Republican national convention
in San Diego, »a pledge by ITT to underwrite the
affair and possible links with the settlement of
antitrust suits involving the giant conglomerate.
Unrest Troubles Portuguese Head
LISBON, Portugal — President Antonio de
Spinola warned yesterday that
"counterrevolutionary forces" were trying to ruin
the new Portuguese government with a campaign of
labor unrest leading to anarchy.
"It is time for every Portuguese to conclude by
himself that any form of anarchy ends fatally and
opens the door to new dictatorships, to regimes like
the one overthrown April 25," Spinola said in a
speech during a brief visit to the northern industrial
city of Oporto.
Aiming his warning mainly at extreme leftists
who have fomented an epidemic of wildcat strikes
in the first days of the new government, Spinola

said the armed forces that overthrew the old rightist
regime would reply to violence with force "without
hesitation."
The 64-year-old general, who took over the
presidency four weeks ago, said
counterrevolutionaries were active in several parts of
the nation.
Sources close to the government said he was not
referring to any particular area and not to the
possibility of a countercoup by ultrarightists. They
said the warning was directed at elements of the
extreme left who have agitated and brought on a
series of labor disputes and demonstrations.
Business Index Slips
WASHINGTON — The government reported
yesterday that its composite of business indicators
slipped in April after three months of solid advance.
The Commerce Department said its index of
leading indicators declined seven-tenths of one
percent, mainly because workers were putting in
shorter weeks.
The decline was the first since December and the
third in a year. The index had climbed 4.3 percent
this year before faltering.
The Commerce Department report, which is
designed to offer clues on the future of the
economy, came a day after President Nixon's
economists forecast that business activity will
quicken and inflation will ease in the second half of
the year.
The faltering index was not necessarily
inconsistent with the predictions, since the Council
of Economic Advisers had said the economy would
probably remain in essentially its current state
through June.

designed to offer clues on the future of the
economy, came a day after President Nixon's
economists forecast that business activity will
quicken and inflation will ease in the second half of
the year.
The faltering index was not necessarily
inconsistent with the predictions, since the Council
of Economic Advisers had said the economy would
probably remain in essentially its current state
through June.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through today but coastal low clouds
spreading inland locally night and morning. Slightly
warmer today. High temperatures today in the low
60s near the coast and in the upper 60s and 70s
inland.
British Resume Ulster Rule
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — The British
government resumed direct rule of Northern Ireland
yesterday following a 15-day general strike that
toppled the moderate provincial government.
The government's action came hours after the
Ulster Workers' Council, a hardline Protestant
group, ended the strike that brought the province to
the brink of economic collapse. Thousands of
strikers content with bringing down the government
returned to work before the walkout was called off.
The British government took over responsibility
for running the province by suspending for four
months the Northern Ireland Assembly, the
provincial parliament that retained the last vestige
of home rule powers in the province.
The province's executive, a coalition of moderate
Protestant and Roman Catholic politicians under
Chief Executive Brian Faulkner, resigned Tuesday as
the strike brought life in Northern Ireland to a
standstill.
By suspending the assembly and taking over the
administration of the province the British hoped to
give Merlyn Rees, the Cabinet minister responsible
for the province, time to try and work out another
attempt at power sharing between the Protestant
majority and the Roman Catholics. At the outset,
his prospects appeared poor.
The Ulster Workers' Council, which organized
the strike in opposition to the power-sharing
agreement, threatened to resume the shutdown
unless the British government acceeded to its
demands.
Initial Watergate Inquiry Ends
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary
Committee yesterday completed the initial phase of
its investigation of President Nixon's role in
Watergate and its chief impeachment counsel
described the case as "of extreme seriousness."
But John Doar cautioned against making any
judgments "until we have considered all the
evidence."
His assessment of the case presented so far was
concurred in by Albert Jenner, minority counsel for
the impeachment inquiry, who said, "I think what
has been presented to the committee up to this
moment is of extreme seriousness for the
Constitution and institutions of the country."
The committee completed this phase after its
eighth day of listening to evidence in closed session.
Chairman Peter W. Rodino emphasized at a
briefing after the closed session that the panel's
investigation of the Watergate cover-up is not
complete. He said additional evidence including
testimony from witnesses will be received later.
Earlier, James D. St. Clair, the President's chief
Watergate lawyer, suggested that the committee
ought to hear the entire Watergate case before
moving on to other areas such as the ITT antitrust
settlement and political contributions from dairy
cooperatives.

Italians Protest Bombing
ROME — Left-wing extremists stormed rightist
targets across Italy with bombs, bricks and iron
bolts yesterday in retaliation for a terrorist bombing
in Brescia.
Millions of Italians took part in strikes and
peaceful rallies in a massive display of mourning for
the Brescia victims, listed by police as six dead and
100 injured. As the day wore on the protests turned
ugly.
Chief targets of the attacks, reported by the
police in at least 20 cities, were the offices and
workers of Italy's Neo-Fascist party, the Italian
Social Movement.
But the Christian Democrats, Italy's dominant
party which along with the Social Movement fought
against divorce in the recent national referendum,
also came under assault.
Police kept up their hunt for those responsible
for the Brescia bombing, which occurred Tuesday
during an anti-Fascist rally in the northern industrial
city.
ITT Prosecutors Resign
WASHINGTON — Two lawyers on the Watergate
prosecution team investigating the ITT case resigned
yesterday. Their impending departure, following the
resignation of their task force chief, will leave the
team without a lawyer who has worked on the case
full time.
A spokesman for Special Watergate Prosecutor
Leon Jaworski announced that Lawrence Austin
Hammond, 28, will leave the task force sometime in
August. He said Paul R. Hober, 31, quit effective
sometime next week.
Earlier in the day, Jaworski named Richard J.
Davis as the successor to Joseph J. Connolly, who
resigned Friday as head of the team in protest of a
decision to allow former Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kelindienst to plead guilty to a misdemeanor in the
case.
A source in the prosecutor's office said Connolly
wanted Kleindienst charged with perjury.
The testimony in question related to the effort
to locate the 1972 Republican national convention
in San Diego, »a pledge by ITT to underwrite the
affair and possible links with the settlement of
antitrust suits involving the giant conglomerate.
Unrest Troubles Portuguese Head
LISBON, Portugal — President Antonio de
Spinola warned yesterday that
"counterrevolutionary forces" were trying to ruin
the new Portuguese government with a campaign of
labor unrest leading to anarchy.
"It is time for every Portuguese to conclude by
himself that any form of anarchy ends fatally and
opens the door to new dictatorships, to regimes like
the one overthrown April 25," Spinola said in a
speech during a brief visit to the northern industrial
city of Oporto.
Aiming his warning mainly at extreme leftists
who have fomented an epidemic of wildcat strikes
in the first days of the new government, Spinola

said the armed forces that overthrew the old rightist
regime would reply to violence with force "without
hesitation."
The 64-year-old general, who took over the
presidency four weeks ago, said
counterrevolutionaries were active in several parts of
the nation.
Sources close to the government said he was not
referring to any particular area and not to the
possibility of a countercoup by ultrarightists. They
said the warning was directed at elements of the
extreme left who have agitated and brought on a
series of labor disputes and demonstrations.
Business Index Slips
WASHINGTON — The government reported
yesterday that its composite of business indicators
slipped in April after three months of solid advance.
The Commerce Department said its index of
leading indicators declined seven-tenths of one
percent, mainly because workers were putting in
shorter weeks.
The decline was the first since December and the
third in a year. The index had climbed 4.3 percent
this year before faltering.
The Commerce Department report, which is
designed to offer clues on the future of the
economy, came a day after President Nixon's
