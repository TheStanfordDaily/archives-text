# Actress Moore Speaks About Television Career
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Double Emmy-award winning
actress Mary Tyler Moore and her
husband Grant Tinker gave an insider's
look at modern television last night to
a standing-room-only crowd.
More than 430 persons crammed
into the 227-seat Geology auditorium
to hear Moore, television's actress of
the year and top comedy actress, and
Tinker reminisce on their early careers,
discuss the current network scene and
opine on the futures of persons
entering the field today.
Moore took a "not terrifically
satisfying" job as a chorus-girl after
graduating from high school, deciding
quickly that she'd rather do television.
After numerous bit and off-screen
parts, she finally got a break. Her role
of the pleasant, talented, harried
housewife on The Dick Van Dyke
Show catapulted her to stardom.
A special she did with Van Dyke
four years after that show was
canceled gave her the chance to get her
own show with CBS. It became a hit
with audiences almost immediately.
Acceptance
"The audience, after all, has the last
word. Dick Van Dyke took a year to
get accepted," Tinker related. "Ours,
fortunately, was a hit almost from the
beginning."
Moore is chairwoman of the board
of Mary Tyler Moore Enterprises,
which will have six network television
shows next season. Tinker is president
of the company, which currently
produces the Moore and Bob Newhart
shows for CBS.
Tinker worked for Universal
Studios television production division
after years of bouncing around the
country with NBC. The couple
decided to use the Moore show as a
basis for their own company.
Employment
Tinker added that the employment
picture for persons now breaking into
television is not as bright.
"The younger you start, the
better . .. This is true not only in the
writing of shows, but also in the
executive areas," Tinker stated. "At
Universal, I think everyone in the
mailroom has a Master's — they have a
very well educated mailroom."
Moore commented on her Emmy
award as best actress, saying she
disagreed with the concept behind the
award.
Disagrees
"I don't agree with the award
'actress of the year.' It's like

comparing apples to oranges.... I
don't see how you can compare a
dancer with a singer,. . . but I'm not
going to give it [the Emmy] back!"
she said.
Moore and Tinker seemed to play
to the over-capacity crowd throughout
much of their presentation. Moore, for
example, made a show of crossing her
legs after jumping up to sit on a table
in front of the audience. She said her
shows are filmed live before a crowd
because she feels a certain excitement
performing to groups.
"Playing to an audience gets your
adrenalin going. It's a 'do or die'
situation.... It's really the most
satisfying for type of acting —"
"— for television," interrupted
Tinker.
"For television," agreed Moore.
"It's the best of two worlds — the
best of theater and the best of
filmmaking," she concluded.

word. Dick Van Dyke took a year to
get accepted," Tinker related. "Ours,
fortunately, was a hit almost from the
beginning."
Moore is chairwoman of the board
of Mary Tyler Moore Enterprises,
which will have six network television
shows next season. Tinker is president
of the company, which currently
produces the Moore and Bob Newhart
shows for CBS.
Tinker worked for Universal
Studios television production division
after years of bouncing around the
country with NBC. The couple
decided to use the Moore show as a
basis for their own company.
Employment
Tinker added that the employment
picture for persons now breaking into
television is not as bright.
"The younger you start, the
better . .. This is true not only in the
writing of shows, but also in the
executive areas," Tinker stated. "At
Universal, I think everyone in the
mailroom has a Master's — they have a
very well educated mailroom."
Moore commented on her Emmy
award as best actress, saying she
disagreed with the concept behind the
award.
Disagrees
"I don't agree with the award
'actress of the year.' It's like

comparing apples to oranges.... I
don't see how you can compare a
dancer with a singer,. . . but I'm not
going to give it [the Emmy] back!"
she said.
Moore and Tinker seemed to play
to the over-capacity crowd throughout
much of their presentation. Moore, for
example, made a show of crossing her
legs after jumping up to sit on a table
in front of the audience. She said her
shows are filmed live before a crowd
because she feels a certain excitement
performing to groups.
"Playing to an audience gets your
adrenalin going. It's a 'do or die'
situation.... It's really the most
satisfying for type of acting —"
"— for television," interrupted
Tinker.
"For television," agreed Moore.
"It's the best of two worlds — the
best of theater and the best of
filmmaking," she concluded.
Double Emmy-award winning
actress Mary Tyler Moore and her
husband Grant Tinker gave an insider's
look at modern television last night to
a standing-room-only crowd.
More than 430 persons crammed
into the 227-seat Geology auditorium
to hear Moore, television's actress of
the year and top comedy actress, and
Tinker reminisce on their early careers,
discuss the current network scene and
opine on the futures of persons
entering the field today.
Moore took a "not terrifically
satisfying" job as a chorus-girl after
graduating from high school, deciding
quickly that she'd rather do television.
After numerous bit and off-screen
parts, she finally got a break. Her role
of the pleasant, talented, harried
housewife on The Dick Van Dyke
Show catapulted her to stardom.
A special she did with Van Dyke
four years after that show was
canceled gave her the chance to get her
own show with CBS. It became a hit
with audiences almost immediately.
Acceptance

word. Dick Van Dyke took a year to
get accepted," Tinker related. "Ours,
fortunately, was a hit almost from the
