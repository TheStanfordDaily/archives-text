# Israel, Syria Approve Disengagement Accord
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — In a dramatic
diplomatic triumph for Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger, Israel and
Syria agreed yesterday to separate
their hostile armies on the Golan
Heights front. The accord raised hopes
for a more durable peace in the Middle
East.
The announcement was made
simultaneously in Washington and
Jerusalem, but Syrian television
merely reported President Nixon's
announcement without comment.
Informed sources in Damascus said
Syria was delaying announcement of
its acceptance, possibly until the
signing ceremony scheduled for
tomorrow. There was speculation that
Kissinger or a top aide might return to
the Syrian capital again to clarify a

few points.
A senior American official said in
Jerusalem that Kissinger believed the
pact could lead to a revolution in
Arab-Israeli relations and give impetus
to more moderate Arab elements.
Fighting Slackens
A Syrian communique said the
fighting that has raged in the Golan
Heights for 79 days died down last
night following announcement of the
agreement.
Earlier yesterday, Damascus said
Syrian artillery shelled Israeli positions
on Mount Hermon and an Israeli
communique said its planes bombed
and strafed "terrorist targets" on the
western slopes of Mount Hermon and
engaged Syrian tanks and artillery.
The disengagement pact, negotiated
in 32 days of intense diplomatic
effort, will be signed in Geneva. It
followed by five months a similar
accord Kissinger worked out between
Israel and Egypt on the Suez front.
Nixon Remarks
President Nixon said "a major
roadblock to any permanent
settlement has now been removed,"
adding that prospects for a Middle
East peace now are "better than they
have been at any time over the past 25
years."
A senior official in Jerusalem said
the Geneva Middle East peace
conference, which met briefly in
December, would reconvene in July.
The parley had adjourned while
Kissinger arranged the Israeli-Egyptian
agreement on the Suez front.
The Syrian-Israeli pact was much
more difficult to achieve, and a senior
U.S. official said the negotiations that
led up to it were the toughest the
secretary ever faced. He said every
issue was contested with unparalleled

tenacity.
The Israeli government expressed
"its hope this agreement will be
another step toward pacifying the
Middle East and diverting the national
energies of all the nations in the area to
the benefit of their peoples, and their
economic, social and political
advancement.
"The government of Israel
expresses its deep appreciation to the
U.S. Secretary of State, Dr. Henry
Kissinger, for the great work he
invested in securing this agreement and
thanks the U.S. President, Mr. Nixon,
for his sympathetic and positive
stand."
Israeli Concessions
The agreement came after Kissinger
gained a major Israeli concession on
Palestinian guerrilla attacks, and two
days after it appeared he had fallen
short of completing the pact despite
marathon talks with Syrian President
Hafez Assad.
The breakthrough came with
Israel's agreement not to press for a
written Syrian commitment to restrict
its border against Palestinian
infiltrators, whose incursions have left
scores of Israelis dead.
Israeli sources said the government
would accept a letter from the United
States saying that any Israeli
retaliation for terrorist attacks would
be "understood" in Washington. This
was interpreted to mean the United
States would veto condemnations of
Israel in the U.N. Security Council for
such reprisals.
In the Israeli-Egyptian
disengagement agreement signed last
January, there was an unpublished
understanding by both sides that
paramilitary operations would be
curbed, Israeli sources said.

Informed sources in Damascus said
Syria was delaying announcement of
its acceptance, possibly until the
signing ceremony scheduled for
tomorrow. There was speculation that
Kissinger or a top aide might return to
the Syrian capital again to clarify a

few points.
A senior American official said in
Jerusalem that Kissinger believed the
pact could lead to a revolution in
Arab-Israeli relations and give impetus
to more moderate Arab elements.
Fighting Slackens
A Syrian communique said the
fighting that has raged in the Golan
Heights for 79 days died down last
night following announcement of the
agreement.
Earlier yesterday, Damascus said
Syrian artillery shelled Israeli positions
on Mount Hermon and an Israeli
communique said its planes bombed
and strafed "terrorist targets" on the
western slopes of Mount Hermon and
engaged Syrian tanks and artillery.
The disengagement pact, negotiated
in 32 days of intense diplomatic
effort, will be signed in Geneva. It
followed by five months a similar
accord Kissinger worked out between
Israel and Egypt on the Suez front.
Nixon Remarks
President Nixon said "a major
roadblock to any permanent
settlement has now been removed,"
adding that prospects for a Middle
East peace now are "better than they
have been at any time over the past 25
years."
A senior official in Jerusalem said
the Geneva Middle East peace
conference, which met briefly in
December, would reconvene in July.
The parley had adjourned while
Kissinger arranged the Israeli-Egyptian
agreement on the Suez front.
The Syrian-Israeli pact was much
more difficult to achieve, and a senior
U.S. official said the negotiations that
led up to it were the toughest the
secretary ever faced. He said every
issue was contested with unparalleled

tenacity.
The Israeli government expressed
"its hope this agreement will be
another step toward pacifying the
Middle East and diverting the national
energies of all the nations in the area to
the benefit of their peoples, and their
economic, social and political
advancement.
"The government of Israel
expresses its deep appreciation to the
U.S. Secretary of State, Dr. Henry
Kissinger, for the great work he
invested in securing this agreement and
thanks the U.S. President, Mr. Nixon,
for his sympathetic and positive
stand."
Israeli Concessions
The agreement came after Kissinger
gained a major Israeli concession on
Palestinian guerrilla attacks, and two
days after it appeared he had fallen
short of completing the pact despite
marathon talks with Syrian President
Hafez Assad.
The breakthrough came with
Israel's agreement not to press for a
written Syrian commitment to restrict
its border against Palestinian
infiltrators, whose incursions have left
scores of Israelis dead.
Israeli sources said the government
would accept a letter from the United
States saying that any Israeli
retaliation for terrorist attacks would
be "understood" in Washington. This
was interpreted to mean the United
States would veto condemnations of
Israel in the U.N. Security Council for
such reprisals.
In the Israeli-Egyptian
disengagement agreement signed last
January, there was an unpublished
understanding by both sides that
paramilitary operations would be
curbed, Israeli sources said.
JERUSALEM (AP) — In a dramatic
diplomatic triumph for Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger, Israel and
Syria agreed yesterday to separate
their hostile armies on the Golan
Heights front. The accord raised hopes
for a more durable peace in the Middle
East.
The announcement was made
simultaneously in Washington and
Jerusalem, but Syrian television
merely reported President Nixon's
announcement without comment.
