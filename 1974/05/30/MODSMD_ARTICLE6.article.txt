# Low-Key Campaign
## Primary Peaks Tuesday 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Californians will go to the polls
Tuesday to nominate candidates for
governor and U.S. Senator in what has
thus far been a relatively low-key
campaign.
Despite a huge Democratic field
and a battle between two of the state's
best-known Republican officeholders
for the gubernatorial nominations,
neither party has yet suffered from the
massive bloodlettings that marked the
1966 and 1970 primaries.
Although 18 Democrats appear on
the gubernatorial ballot, most of the
attention has been focused on seven
candidates: Secretary of State
Edmund G. Brown Jr., the
frontrunner, according to all polls;
Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti; San
Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto; U.S.
Rep. Jerome Waldie; financier William
Matson Roth; Los Angeles County
Supervisor Baxter Ward; and
Claremont attorney Herbert Hafif.
Brown, son of the two-term
governor defeated by Ronald Reagan
in 1966, has remained atop the polls
for the entire campaign. An early
opponent of the Vietnam War and a
supporter of Sen. Eugene McCarthy's
1968 Presidential bid, Brown was the
only Democrat elected to state office
in the 1970 Republican sweep, and

since then has remained in the public
eye through his strengthened
enforcement of the state's election
laws.
His two closest competitors are
Moretti, a Van Nuys legislator who has
been assembly speaker since 1970, and
Alioto, two-term San Francisco
mayor.
Moretti has portrayed himself as
the foe of big business, accusing
Brown of saying one thing and doing
another. Although he has cooperated
with Gov. Reagan in some areas —
notably tax and welfare reform — he
spearheaded opposition to last year's
Proposition 1, the Reagan-sponsored
tax limitation initiative that was
defeated.
Alioto has attempted to consolidate
the conservative and moderate wings
of the party. Once considered as a
possible vice presidential candidate by
Hubert Humphrey in 1968, Alioto was
poised to enter the 1970 gubernatorial
race until a myriad of legal problems —
including a criminal indictment for
alleged fee splitting with a Washington
state official — knocked him out. Now
cleared of charges, he is counting on
the strong support of the state
AFL-CIO and Teamsters organizations,
and is promoting a "law-and-order"

image through his public statements
on the Zebra and SLA cases.
Waldie, an outspoken critic of
President Nixon and a member of the
House panel probing impeachment,
announced his candidacy over two
year?; ago, but has been unable to
challenge the top three in the polls.
Roth is a University of California
regent trying to turn his lack of
previous political experience into an
asset. And Ward, a former television
newscaster, remains virtually unknown
in Northern California despite his wide
recognition in the southland.
The Republican campaign is less
explosive — but perhaps as costly.
Conservative Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke,
the early frontrunner, has run out of
friends and money, a result of his
indictment for perjury in the ITT case.
Latest polls show state Controller
Houston Flournoy ahead of Reinecke
and widening the gap between them.
Reinecke, appointed to his current
post six years ago by Gov. Reagan
when Lt. Gov. Robert Finch left to
join President Nixon's cabinet, won
re-election in his own right in 1970
and had counted on support from
both Reagan and his wealthy backers.
But the ITT indictment cast a grave
shadow over the campaign, and even
such normally conservative figures as
