# McCloskey Uncertain Of Renomination Chances
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
With the election less than a week away, Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park, says he is
still not certain he can win renomination in the
June 4 primary in the 12th Congressional
District, which includes Stanford.
"It's going to be close," McCloskey said
yesterday. "I'm reconciled to whatever happens.
I'm perfectly prepared to lose."
In an interview with the Daily in his crowded
Palo Alto campaign headquarters, McCloskey
predicted that if he loses the primary to
Atherton businessman J. Gordon Knapp, the
Democrats will win his seat in November.
According to McCloskey, his most recent poll
shows him leading Knapp 42 to 38, with 20
percent of the electorate undecided. But he said
that in past primaries, "undecided voters"have
voted 2-1 against him.
Estimating that two-thirds of the voters older
than 50 oppose him while two-thirds below that
age support him, McCloskey cited his support
for amnesty, impeachment of President Nixon,
and decriminalization of marijuana as reasons
why he has trouble winning votes among
Republicans.
Change Party
"Some Republicans have held me up to

derision and scorn as not being a real
Republican," McCloskey said, in an apparent
allusion to charges made by Knapp during the
campaign. "I don't expect in my lifetime my
views will ever be those of a majority of
Republicans, but I still want to work to change
this party."
When asked if he was pleased with the results
of a campaign to re-register Stanford students as
Republicans so they could vote for him in the
primary, McCloskey replied that "pleased isn't
the word. I'm touched and flattered."
McCloskey said that more than a thousand
Stanford students changed their registration to
Republican. He added that 60 percent of the
new registrations in the district are Republican
— the highest percentage in the nation.
Responding to Knapp's charge that it is
unethical for people to register in a party they
don't support, McCloskey stated, "You
[should] register where your vote can do the
most good for the party."
"I have hope these young people will stay in
the party. But I can't ask them to stay as long as
Nixon is President."
McCloskey said that if Vice President Ford
becomes President, the GOP has the chance to

return to "decency" and serve as a vehicle for
reform.
'Gerrymandered'
Noting that a reapportionment plan
supposedly masterminded by Knapp brought
many conservative voters . into his district,
McCloskey lamented that "those of us who
buck the system get gerrymandered out of our
district." He cited Rep. Bella Abzug, D-N.Y.,
and former Rep. Allard Lowenstein, D-N.Y., as
examples.
"I represent a threat to many people in the
district," McCloskey said. He declared that his
opposition to government support for the
Lockheed Corp. cost him much support among
the 6000 Lockheed workers in the district.
McCloskey acknowledged that Knapp has
fought a vigorous campaign, but expressed
doubt about Knapp's claim to have visited
25,000 homes in the district. McCloskey
explained that his experience walking precincts
has taught him that such a feat would be almost
impossible.
McCloskey said he was disappointed in
Knapp's refusal to engage in the 100 debates to
which he challenged him, and accused Knapp of
trying to win votes among anti-abortion "Right
to Life" groups in the "old Catholic areas of

Santa Clara."
Businessmen
Insisting that Knapp's "hard-nosed business
approach is what is destroying the Republican
Party," McCloskey admitted that Knapp's
conservative views are attractive to the business
interests of the district, and will win him strong
support.
McCloskey claimed that his campaign for
President against Nixon in the 1972 Republican
primaries is still held against him by many voters
in the district, despite the Watergate revelations.
"No one is honored as, a prophet in his
hometown," McCloskey quipped. "I think I
could win the New Hampshire primary today,
but in this district, only a half dozen people
have told me that they disagreed with me in
1972, but now believe that I am right."
But McCloskey noted that he has no plans to
run for President again.
Not Presidential Material
"I learned in 1972 that I'm not qualified to
be President," McCloskey stated. "I prefer to
legislate."
Calling his race with Knapp a "great contest"
because it "focuses the old and the new in the
Republican Party," McCloskey noted that the
competition offers voters a real choice.

doubt about Knapp's claim to have visited
25,000 homes in the district. McCloskey
explained that his experience walking precincts
has taught him that such a feat would be almost
impossible.
McCloskey said he was disappointed in
Knapp's refusal to engage in the 100 debates to
which he challenged him, and accused Knapp of
trying to win votes among anti-abortion "Right
to Life" groups in the "old Catholic areas of

Santa Clara."
Businessmen
Insisting that Knapp's "hard-nosed business
approach is what is destroying the Republican
Party," McCloskey admitted that Knapp's
conservative views are attractive to the business
interests of the district, and will win him strong
support.
McCloskey claimed that his campaign for
President against Nixon in the 1972 Republican
primaries is still held against him by many voters
in the district, despite the Watergate revelations.
"No one is honored as, a prophet in his
hometown," McCloskey quipped. "I think I
could win the New Hampshire primary today,
but in this district, only a half dozen people
have told me that they disagreed with me in
1972, but now believe that I am right."
But McCloskey noted that he has no plans to
run for President again.
Not Presidential Material
"I learned in 1972 that I'm not qualified to
be President," McCloskey stated. "I prefer to
legislate."
Calling his race with Knapp a "great contest"
because it "focuses the old and the new in the
Republican Party," McCloskey noted that the
competition offers voters a real choice.

PAUL N. McCLOSKEY JR.
With the election less than a week away, Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park, says he is
still not certain he can win renomination in the
June 4 primary in the 12th Congressional
District, which includes Stanford.
"It's going to be close," McCloskey said
yesterday. "I'm reconciled to whatever happens.
I'm perfectly prepared to lose."
In an interview with the Daily in his crowded
Palo Alto campaign headquarters, McCloskey
predicted that if he loses the primary to
Atherton businessman J. Gordon Knapp, the
Democrats will win his seat in November.
According to McCloskey, his most recent poll
shows him leading Knapp 42 to 38, with 20
percent of the electorate undecided. But he said
that in past primaries, "undecided voters"have
voted 2-1 against him.
Estimating that two-thirds of the voters older
than 50 oppose him while two-thirds below that
age support him, McCloskey cited his support
for amnesty, impeachment of President Nixon,
and decriminalization of marijuana as reasons
why he has trouble winning votes among
Republicans.
Change Party
"Some Republicans have held me up to

derision and scorn as not being a real
Republican," McCloskey said, in an apparent
allusion to charges made by Knapp during the
campaign. "I don't expect in my lifetime my
views will ever be those of a majority of
Republicans, but I still want to work to change
this party."
When asked if he was pleased with the results
of a campaign to re-register Stanford students as
Republicans so they could vote for him in the
primary, McCloskey replied that "pleased isn't
the word. I'm touched and flattered."
McCloskey said that more than a thousand
Stanford students changed their registration to
Republican. He added that 60 percent of the
new registrations in the district are Republican
— the highest percentage in the nation.
Responding to Knapp's charge that it is
unethical for people to register in a party they
don't support, McCloskey stated, "You
[should] register where your vote can do the
most good for the party."
"I have hope these young people will stay in
the party. But I can't ask them to stay as long as
Nixon is President."
McCloskey said that if Vice President Ford
becomes President, the GOP has the chance to

return to "decency" and serve as a vehicle for
reform.
'Gerrymandered'
Noting that a reapportionment plan
supposedly masterminded by Knapp brought
many conservative voters . into his district,
McCloskey lamented that "those of us who
buck the system get gerrymandered out of our
district." He cited Rep. Bella Abzug, D-N.Y.,
and former Rep. Allard Lowenstein, D-N.Y., as
examples.
"I represent a threat to many people in the
district," McCloskey said. He declared that his
opposition to government support for the
Lockheed Corp. cost him much support among
the 6000 Lockheed workers in the district.

this party."
When asked if he was pleased with the results
of a campaign to re-register Stanford students as
Republicans so they could vote for him in the
primary, McCloskey replied that "pleased isn't
the word. I'm touched and flattered."
McCloskey said that more than a thousand
Stanford students changed their registration to
Republican. He added that 60 percent of the
new registrations in the district are Republican
— the highest percentage in the nation.
Responding to Knapp's charge that it is
unethical for people to register in a party they
don't support, McCloskey stated, "You
[should] register where your vote can do the
most good for the party."
"I have hope these young people will stay in
the party. But I can't ask them to stay as long as
Nixon is President."
McCloskey said that if Vice President Ford
becomes President, the GOP has the chance to

return to "decency" and serve as a vehicle for
reform.
'Gerrymandered'
Noting that a reapportionment plan
supposedly masterminded by Knapp brought
many conservative voters . into his district,
McCloskey lamented that "those of us who
buck the system get gerrymandered out of our
district." He cited Rep. Bella Abzug, D-N.Y.,
and former Rep. Allard Lowenstein, D-N.Y., as
examples.
"I represent a threat to many people in the
district," McCloskey said. He declared that his
opposition to government support for the
Lockheed Corp. cost him much support among
the 6000 Lockheed workers in the district.
McCloskey acknowledged that Knapp has
fought a vigorous campaign, but expressed
doubt about Knapp's claim to have visited
25,000 homes in the district. McCloskey
explained that his experience walking precincts
has taught him that such a feat would be almost
impossible.
McCloskey said he was disappointed in
Knapp's refusal to engage in the 100 debates to
which he challenged him, and accused Knapp of
trying to win votes among anti-abortion "Right
to Life" groups in the "old Catholic areas of

Santa Clara."
Businessmen
Insisting that Knapp's "hard-nosed business
approach is what is destroying the Republican
Party," McCloskey admitted that Knapp's
conservative views are attractive to the business
interests of the district, and will win him strong
support.
McCloskey claimed that his campaign for
President against Nixon in the 1972 Republican
primaries is still held against him by many voters
in the district, despite the Watergate revelations.
"No one is honored as, a prophet in his
hometown," McCloskey quipped. "I think I
could win the New Hampshire primary today,
but in this district, only a half dozen people
have told me that they disagreed with me in
1972, but now believe that I am right."
But McCloskey noted that he has no plans to
run for President again.
Not Presidential Material
"I learned in 1972 that I'm not qualified to
be President," McCloskey stated. "I prefer to
legislate."
Calling his race with Knapp a "great contest"
because it "focuses the old and the new in the
Republican Party," McCloskey noted that the
competition offers voters a real choice.
