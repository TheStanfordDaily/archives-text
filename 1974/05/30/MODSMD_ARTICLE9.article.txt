# On Rent Control

■ The Daily came out against
rent control in Palo Alto, at least
partly on the belief that it would
be illegal. This impression was
■based on the fate of Berkeley's
rent control law, which was struck
down last year by Alameda
County Superior Court Judge
Bostick.
The Daily is wrong on this
matter, for two reasons. First, the
situation of Berkeley is quite
different from that of Palo Alto.
Second, Judge Bostick's decision
rests on shaky legal ground.
Berkeley's rent control law
differs from Palo Alto's in an
'important way: Palo Alto's
measure does not include eviction
controls, as did Berkeley's. One
reason that Judge Bostick gave for
striking down Berkeley's law was
his belief that local eviction
control was preempted by state
eviction law.
Also, the housing shortage in
'Palo Alto is far more severe than
is Berkeley's. This is important
because the factual need for rent
control is what legally justifies it.
(This is explained in more detail
below.)
Acute Housing Problem
Judge Bostick held that
Berkeley's housing problem was
not acute enough to justify rent
control, since its vacancy rate was
rising and had reached a level of
'3.1 percent. Palo Alto's vacancy
rate is steady at 1.18 percent. Not
•only that, rents have gone up 32
percent in Palo Alto since 1970,
while operating costs (including
taxes) have risen only 11.6
percent.
Judge Bostick has not had the
final word on rent control in
Berkeley. Both the Berkeley City
Attorney's Office and the
Berkeley Fair Rent Committee
have found serious flaws in his
decision and have appealed to a
higher court.
The judge said that the Due
Process clause of the constitution
prohibits citizens from affecting
property rights through the
initiative process. But this process
was instituted to allow California
citizens to make needed changes

when their public officials failed
to do so.
Basic Tool
By denying citizens the right to
use the initiative to regulate rent
inflation, Judge Bostick would
remove from their hands one of
the most basic tools of
California's democratic system.
An appeals court is unlikely to
uphold him in this.
(Judge Bostick's reasoning
would also result in striking down
the California Coastal Initiative,
which will have far more
profound effects on property
rights than rent control. The
Coastal Initiative has already been
upheld in a test case in Orange
County.)
Judge Bostick also held that,
since only some groups were hurt
badly by high rents and poor
housing conditions — the aged,
the disabled, minorities and the
young — no general housing
emergency existed. He held that
an "emergency" was necessary to
justify rent control.
Landmark Decision
These aspects of his decision
will also be questioned by a higher
court. When the U.S. Supreme
Court reviewed a rent control law
in the landmark case of Block v.
Hirsh, 256 U.S. 135 (1921),
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes
indicated that a public need — not
a public emergency — was enough
to justify rent control:
" .... [A] public exigency will
justify the legislature in restricting
property rights in land to a certain
extent without compensation. But
if to answer one need the
legislature may limit [the] height
[of buildings), to answer another
it may limit rent."
Finally, it must be remembered
that Judge Bostick is only one
man. As an Alameda County
judge, he has no power to set
precedent for Santa Clara County.
Palo Alto should not be
discouraged from making needed
changes through the initiative
process simply because a single
man challenged the first attempt
to institute rent control.
