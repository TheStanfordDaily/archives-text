## Three-Week USE Strike Ends

Following a series of concessions by
both sides, the University and the
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union have reached tentative
agreement on the main items in the
settlement of the recent strike.
The two bargaining teams
compromised at a 26.4 percent or
about $4 million increase in the wage
and benefit base over the next three
years. This includes a 10 percent
increase the first year, retroactive to
Sept. 1, 1973. The union's original
demands called for a 23 percent
increase this year.
"We weren't powerful enough to
get 23 percent out of them," USE
President Jim Berk told the Daily
Monday.
"There is no doubt that we settled

for less, but we were trying to get as
much shoehorned into the contract as
possible and get it established. Then
the fight in succeeding contracts is to
change the size and scope of the
items," he said.
Both sides predict it will take
another week to finalize language in
the contract. The two teams have been
negotiating since December. USE went
on strike May 13 and returned to work
Monday.
New Benefits
The first year 10 percent figure
includes "one additional holiday, shift
premium increases for designated
departments, and 9'/2 percent in wage
adjustments to be allocated between
across the board adjustments and
special market adjustments for various
classifications," said a joint

University-USE release yesterday.
No classification will receive less
than a seven percent increase for the
first year, effective September, 1973.
"The exact way the 10 percent is
going to be divied up has not been
settled," said Berk. The teams are
working to determine how rmich of
the 10 percent will be in the form of a
minimum pay, community standards,
and cost of living clause.
Other Gains
Economic package increases for the
second year total 7.8 percent,
including 1.1 percent for increased
medical coverage for dependants.
The third year includes economic
package increases of 5.6 percent plus
up to three percent more as
determined by a cost of living
escalator feature.
Berk said the union bargaining team
abandoned its demand for an increased
pension plan because "members were
more interested in increased medical
coverage."
The escalator clause in the third
year calls for an annual increase of 0.3
percent per point increase of the
Consumer Price Index with a ceiling of
three percent.
Agency Shop
Berk said that the two sides had
reached conceptual agreement on a
modified-union-agency shop. While the
details remained to be finalized, the
agreement tentatively calls for all
present members of the union to
remain in the union. All present
non-members would be required to
pay union dues though they would not
have to join the union. All new
employees would be required to join
the union.
While the contract will include no
formal maintenance of standards
clause, Berk said the University will be
"required" by the contract to
negotiate with the union on
maintenance of standards issues that
arise.

Workers laid off with more than
four years service can claim severance
pay based upon their length of service.
'Just Cause'
The tentative settlement also
includes a "just cause" clause
moderated by other language to deal
with job-related discipline issues. The
University would thus have to show
just cause if it took disciplinary action
against a worker, Berk said.
Berk said the major breakthrough
in the negotiations came in a
negotiating session lasting from
Saturday morning until Sunday noon.
Reflecting on the strike and the
settlement, Berk said "I think you'll
find ours is an amazing first strike
against an amazingly tough target. It
was a very successful strike â€” in some
ways, exhilarating, in others
disappointing."
