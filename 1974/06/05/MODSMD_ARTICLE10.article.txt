# Services Rebate
## 
### 
Dave Poneman et al.

We, residents of Twain House,
write this letter to inquire into the
possibility of receiving a rebate
for labor services not rendered
because of the strike.
First, let us state our principal
argument for such a rebate.
Stanford Residences, General
Information and Regulations â€”
1973-74, official University
housing policy according to the
Residence Agreement, states that
"The University will provide
normal cleaning service to public
areas, including bathrooms."
Since the strike began, the
University has been unable or
unwilling to provide this service
they had contracted to provide.
Therefore, that portion of the
original rent that was to pay for
cleaning ought to be refunded, as
the services contracted and paid
for were not provided.
This contractual obligation of
the University to the students in
the Housing System looms
especially important in light of
the often observed University
policy of holding students to the
details of their contractual
obligations to the University.
Also Political Issue
In addition to the economic
issue, some students see a political
issue. In their view, if students
exempt the University from its
contractual obligation to the
students during the strike, then
they give the University unfair aid
in its negotiations with the Union.
Finally, this letter is motivated

out of the desire to protect the
interests of students to have input
into decisions that directly affect
the student community.
Arriving at a determination of
the exact amount of an equitable
rebate is a complex task.
Nevertheless, estimates taken
from University cleaning
expenditures on services that have
not been or are not being
provided indicate the sum for the
housing system may be several
thousand dollars.
'Equitable Rebate'
Thus we request that the
University provide a position on
the issue of whether it will
provide an equitable rebate, and
what it considers an equitable
rebate to be.
We want this letter to be
constructive, not inflexible or
antagonistic. We feel strongly the
need to make University officials
aware of our discontent, and we
wish to open communication with
the decision-makers so the staff
will not duplicate student cleaning
efforts.
The complicated issue of what
is an equitable solution to the
problem of services disrupted by
the strike is obviously too detailed
to be fully treated here. Thus, we
hope that we can meet with the
appropriate University officials to
discuss the issues.
