# Public Financing: Not The Answer
##

With ever increasing exposes of scandal in
the Nixon Administration, there has been a
growing awareness of secret and illegal
campaign financing. Part of the reaction to
this is the serious contemplation of public
financing for federal elections which would
supposedly lessen corruption and illegitimate
campaign practices.
A bill precisely of this nature passed the
Senate on April 11 (53044) and is now going
through the legislative process in the House
of Representatives. Unfortunately, the
electorate seems to know nothing of the bill,
let alone realize its possible implications.
The first and most basic objection to
public financing of elections is that it would
violate the freedom of expression guaranteed
under the first amendment. The individual
would be coerced into paying for the
campaigns of those candidates to whom he
was opposed, and if campaigns were entirely
financed, individual contributions would
necessarily be outlawed, thus destroying the
right to use one's money to propagate his
political views.
A partial subsidy of a campaign would
only make a rich party richer because the
party would still get substantial
contributions. Total subsidization, however,
so as to be fair, would have to include
outlawing the donation of private services.
No Donated Labor
One would not be able to work for the
candidate of his choice unless he was hired.
Such an absurdity would obviously make
politics even more professional than it is
now, as well as limit widespread interest in
the political process merely by curtailing
participation.
In any public financing scheme the

question as to how money is to be
apportioned would be bitterly contested.
Some proposals inlcude the tying of funds
to the number of votes a party received in
the last election.
Such a law would seriously hurt the
prospects of a third party ticket or an
independent candidate and thereby aid
entrenched and reactionary interests. If
independent parties are included in any
subsidizing, who would wish to support those
fringe candidates not able to raise any funds
themselves?
Third Party Still Hurt
Other proposals put the amount received
proportionate to the amount of money raised
privately during the primary election. This
would again preclude the success of a third
party, and even perhaps of those influential
candidates who are not forced to pay great
sums to win a primary election.
Taxpayer financing of elections would
undoubtedly aid incumbents in a re-election
bid. They already possess access to the
media, name recognition and the franking
privilege. Many times the only way a
challenger can become effectively recognized
is by spending a sum of money given by
supporters that exceeds that of the
incumbent.
With a public subsidy, he would be limited
to that amount which the federal government
decrees is equitable â€” that same government
that the incumbents are able to manipulate.
Could Raise Campaign Costs
Ironically, public financing may cause
campaigns to cost more than they do
now. Even when not considering the
notor. s overspending of the federal
government, one must realize that in the

upcoming elections perhaps only 50
congressional seats are in question.
Those congressmen not requiring great
sums of money for campaigning would
assuredly take government subsidies and
spend them if they were offered. It would be
ridiculous to characterize such waste as a
method to reduce campaign costs.
In addition to all this, one is overwhelmed
at the prospect of putting more money in the
hands of those from whom we are
supposedly going to be protected. With more
politicians and citizens looking directly to
the federal government for aid, the federal
system and local politics will indubitably
suffer. More people will lose interest in
involving themselves in the support of various
candidates and instead simply wait for
election day, as so many do now.
Must Enforce Laws
Assuredly, there is no consensus in this
country holding the egalitarian view that
parties must have the same resources, yet
different levels of support. In any event,
corruption will not be checked unless
election laws are vigorously enforced.
This was illustrated magnificently in the
1972 campaign when numerous corporations
gave illegal contributions to President
Nixon's re-election effort. The enacted
statutes neither stopped them from giving
nor him from accepting.
So, hardly anyone would denigrate the
need for election reform or more rigorous
enforcement of existing laws; however, the
radical socialization of the election process
entailed in public financing is impractical and
contradictory to the spirit of true election
reform.
