Stephen Baird

Charles McCabe recently
leaked a report that the President
is a lousy poker player. Evidence
bearing on that report has become
available in the form of an edited
transcript of a White House tape.
It covers a poker game played in
the Oval office in September,
1973. The players were the
President (P), Judge Sirica (S),
Leon Jaworski (J), John Dean (D)
and Sam Ervin (E).
P (Dealing) The game is five
card draw, jacks or better to open,
quarter limit before the draw, half
after. Ante a dime.
S — Shuffle the cards before
you deal if you don't mind.
P (Shuffles and deals)
S — Check.
J — Check.
D — Check.
E — I'll open for a quarter.
P — Raise you, you (deleted).
S — And I'll raise you.
J — I'll stay.

can.
