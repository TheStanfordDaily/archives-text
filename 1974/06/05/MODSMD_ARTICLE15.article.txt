# Our Mediocre Era's Tone
## 
### 
Robert Cohn

"Right on," we say. But there are levels of this.
A dish of ice cream "hits the spot," yes indeed, but
excellent pop music or, a fortiori, Brahms, does it
in a more completely human way which we also
call "higher" as in Hegel's "higher synthesis."
Somewhere along the line the ice-cream-lover
got leavened and complicated, and his sense of
"righton" then had to include that new complexity
in the balance, the "spot," which has shifted
upward, aufgehoben or sublimated.
It is in this sense that our era is appallingly
mediocre. We still have the ice cream, thank god,
and the pop music (and even some slightly more
elevated forms such as musicals) which are
occasionally both innovative and "on," but what of
the Brahms level?
No Threat
Cage is no more a threat to him than Mailer is
to Tolstoy or Proust. Mailer is a loud-mouthed

pretender, as Hemingway had been before him
(with rather more talent), but in the end he is too
tacky and glib and merely illustrates the extent of
our rout. He is, along with the whole period, sadly
lacking in class or high tone.
As for the new critics, don't ask. Tone is
something they seem never to have heard of.
Compared, for example, to Baudelaire, who was
both a sophisticate and naive enough to be
beautifully clear in his critical prose, try reading
one of the structuralist or semiotics bunch.
Not only are they intellectually second rate
(creatively tenth rate), they obviously write only
for each other, in fantastic jargon which piles up
along with recondite references to
other tenth-raters, without a trace of the impulse
that would make for balance, style and friendly
concern for the reader, enlightened pleasure: tone.
