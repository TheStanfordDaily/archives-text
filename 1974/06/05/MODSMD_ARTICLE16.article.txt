The harmony between the love
of God and the actions of Jesus as
recorded in the New Testament
was questioned in a recent Daily
article by Bill Evers. The
adequacy of our historical
knowledge of Jesus was also
questioned, along with the
intellectual honesty of faith in
God when all the evidence is not
in.
What we know about Jesus is
just what we would expect to
know assuming that he was and
that he was who he said he was.
How else could the teachings of a
poor carpenter who opposed the
learning and religion of his day
come down to us, than through
the writings of a devoted band of
followers who would risk death
rather than deny their Lord?
It is hardly rational to rule out
the existence of Jesus because of a
priori assumptions that exclude
the miraculous. Indeed, some
skeptics such as Littleton and
West have been converted after a
close study of New Testament
times and the Biblical accounts.
Tooley's view of the
atonement is a gross caricature.
The Bible teaches that "God so
loved the world that he gave his
only Son, that whoever believes in
him should not perish but have
eternal life."
Mystery of Atonement
The Atonement is the greatest
of all mysteries. Human wisdom
cannot completely comprehend it.
But we are unable to explain
even the simplest facts of nature,
and so it is not surprising that the
greatest battle between good and
evil should not be entirely
understood by us. The Christian
knows that "Christ redeemed us
from the curse of the law, having
become a curse for us."
At least two of the three
Biblical accounts say that Jesus
permitted the demons to enter the
swine, rather than ordering them
to go. This is an important
distinction. But for Jesus, the
demons would have remained in
the man.
Fig Tree Withering
As for the fig tree that Jesus
caused to wither, it could be that
others had also seen it at a
distance and had been
disappointed at finding no fruit
on it. Some commentators say
that fig trees generally have fruit
when they have leaves, even out
of season, I recall.
Let us ask ourselves the more
important question: are we able
to walk in the footsteps of Jesus,
to return love for hate and to
forgive as Jesus did? His healing
power was not limited to his life
on earth. Those who accept him
today know that he comforts
them and binds up their wounds.
We do not need to be
compelled by evidence in order to
have faith. In how many of life's
decisions do we wait until
compelled by evidence? So why
must we require incontrovertible
proof before we open our hearts
to Jesus?
Use Intellect
I believe that those who have
faith should exercise their
intellect and examine the basis of
their beliefs. But this does not
require them to give up their
faith, their trust in God. True
faith is not afraid to confront the
evidence.
The omnipotence of God may
be misunderstood. The
omnipotence of God is never used
to remove our freedom of choice.
Solomon did not lose his wisdom
when he forsook the Lord.
The fact that God has given us
free choice implies that our
choices must have effects on
others, and that these effects
cannot arbitrarily be annulled by
God. Even the choices of Satan
are permitted by the Lord to have
their consequences.
Disobedience Is Cause
Suffering results from
disobedience to God. The Lord
has chosen to reveal himself
through his creation, and it is
through the creation, with its
particular laws of cause and
effect, that the results of
obedience and disobedience to
God will be revealed.
In the parable Jesus said, "Let
both grow together until the
harvest," and at the harvest the
nature of good and evil will be
fully developed for all to see.
Even in this life, we all receive
sufficient evidence to make the
right decision.
I do not believe that the Bible
teaches that there is an eternal
place of torment, but rather that
the unsaved are destroyed after a
short period of suffering.
However, I cannot speak for the
majority of Christians in this.

compelled by evidence in order to
have faith. In how many of life's
decisions do we wait until
compelled by evidence? So why
must we require incontrovertible
proof before we open our hearts
to Jesus?
Use Intellect
I believe that those who have
faith should exercise their
intellect and examine the basis of
their beliefs. But this does not
require them to give up their
faith, their trust in God. True
faith is not afraid to confront the
evidence.
The omnipotence of God may
be misunderstood. The
omnipotence of God is never used
to remove our freedom of choice.
Solomon did not lose his wisdom
when he forsook the Lord.
The fact that God has given us
free choice implies that our
choices must have effects on
others, and that these effects
cannot arbitrarily be annulled by
God. Even the choices of Satan
are permitted by the Lord to have
their consequences.
Disobedience Is Cause
Suffering results from
disobedience to God. The Lord
has chosen to reveal himself
through his creation, and it is
through the creation, with its
particular laws of cause and
effect, that the results of
obedience and disobedience to
God will be revealed.
In the parable Jesus said, "Let
both grow together until the
harvest," and at the harvest the
nature of good and evil will be
fully developed for all to see.
Even in this life, we all receive
sufficient evidence to make the
right decision.
I do not believe that the Bible
teaches that there is an eternal
place of torment, but rather that
the unsaved are destroyed after a
short period of suffering.
However, I cannot speak for the
majority of Christians in this.

The harmony between the love
of God and the actions of Jesus as
recorded in the New Testament
was questioned in a recent Daily
article by Bill Evers. The
adequacy of our historical
knowledge of Jesus was also
questioned, along with the
intellectual honesty of faith in
God when all the evidence is not
in.
What we know about Jesus is
just what we would expect to
know assuming that he was and
that he was who he said he was.
How else could the teachings of a
poor carpenter who opposed the
learning and religion of his day
come down to us, than through
the writings of a devoted band of
followers who would risk death
rather than deny their Lord?
It is hardly rational to rule out
the existence of Jesus because of a
priori assumptions that exclude
the miraculous. Indeed, some
skeptics such as Littleton and
West have been converted after a
close study of New Testament
times and the Biblical accounts.
Tooley's view of the
atonement is a gross caricature.
The Bible teaches that "God so
loved the world that he gave his
only Son, that whoever believes in
him should not perish but have
eternal life."
Mystery of Atonement
The Atonement is the greatest
of all mysteries. Human wisdom
cannot completely comprehend it.
But we are unable to explain
even the simplest facts of nature,
and so it is not surprising that the
greatest battle between good and
evil should not be entirely
understood by us. The Christian
knows that "Christ redeemed us
from the curse of the law, having
become a curse for us."
At least two of the three
Biblical accounts say that Jesus
permitted the demons to enter the
swine, rather than ordering them
to go. This is an important
distinction. But for Jesus, the
demons would have remained in
the man.
Fig Tree Withering
As for the fig tree that Jesus
caused to wither, it could be that
others had also seen it at a
distance and had been
disappointed at finding no fruit
on it. Some commentators say
that fig trees generally have fruit
when they have leaves, even out
of season, I recall.
Let us ask ourselves the more
important question: are we able
to walk in the footsteps of Jesus,
to return love for hate and to
forgive as Jesus did? His healing
power was not limited to his life
on earth. Those who accept him
today know that he comforts
them and binds up their wounds.
We do not need to be
compelled by evidence in order to
have faith. In how many of life's
