# On Tours Campus

News of a possible radical drop
in enrollment at Stanford-in-
France prompts me to write about
the program. I do so, nearing the
end of my fourth Tours
assignment in 10 years, partly
because I have found teaching
here all in all the most satisfying
of my Stanford experiences.
I assume there is some
apprehension that announced
changes in the French program
will make the Tours campus a
radically different one. It is true
the interdisciplinary (and wholly
optional) "focus" theme of
Politics, Art and Literature will
differ from anything offered in
the past, and will bring American
and French faculty into closer
association. And the language
study of the first weeks will be
intensive.
But this will mean, for most
students, less language study
during the rest of their stay. It
will also mean that full exposure
to French culture, and the
capacity to carry on real
conversations, will come nearer
the beginning of the time in
France. More students than before
will be qualified to take or audit
courses at the University of Tours,
located just a block away.
These are real changes. They
will leave unaffected the various
elective courses in French
civilization — history, art,
literature, politics — that for
many students constitute the
heart of the Tours program.
My guess is that Director Paul
Le Moal — one of the most
humane and most flexible
administrators I have known in
some 40 years around two
universities —can be counted on to
respond to any student signals
that this or that feature of the
new curriculum should be
modified.
Why, all in all, my most
satisfying Stanford experience?
Most of all because of the close
association with students — eating
with them twice a day, traveling
with them on field trips, teaching
smaller classes, knowing all your
students as persons. This, rarely
mentioned in discussions of the

foreign campuses, makes teaching
more exciting.
Also seldom mentioned is the
experience of shared
disorientation through exposure
to new atmospheres, new
manners, new voices, new foods. I
have noticed this particularly in
my seminar based on student
writing about the ongoing
European experience.
Every period of transition
involves doubts, every new
academic program elicits
prophecies of doom. What is
sometimes forgotten is the
exciting "Hawthorne effect" of
living through and perhaps helping
to modify an experiment.

association with students — eating
with them twice a day, traveling
with them on field trips, teaching
smaller classes, knowing all your
students as persons. This, rarely
mentioned in discussions of the

foreign campuses, makes teaching
more exciting.
Also seldom mentioned is the
experience of shared
disorientation through exposure
to new atmospheres, new
manners, new voices, new foods. I
have noticed this particularly in
my seminar based on student
writing about the ongoing
European experience.
Every period of transition
involves doubts, every new
academic program elicits
prophecies of doom. What is
sometimes forgotten is the
exciting "Hawthorne effect" of
living through and perhaps helping
to modify an experiment.

News of a possible radical drop
in enrollment at Stanford-in-
France prompts me to write about
the program. I do so, nearing the
end of my fourth Tours
assignment in 10 years, partly
because I have found teaching
here all in all the most satisfying
of my Stanford experiences.
I assume there is some
apprehension that announced
changes in the French program
will make the Tours campus a
radically different one. It is true
the interdisciplinary (and wholly
optional) "focus" theme of
Politics, Art and Literature will
differ from anything offered in
the past, and will bring American
and French faculty into closer
association. And the language
study of the first weeks will be
intensive.
But this will mean, for most
students, less language study
during the rest of their stay. It
will also mean that full exposure
to French culture, and the
capacity to carry on real
conversations, will come nearer
the beginning of the time in
France. More students than before
will be qualified to take or audit
courses at the University of Tours,
located just a block away.
These are real changes. They
will leave unaffected the various
elective courses in French
civilization — history, art,
literature, politics — that for
many students constitute the
heart of the Tours program.
My guess is that Director Paul
Le Moal — one of the most
humane and most flexible
administrators I have known in
some 40 years around two
universities —can be counted on to
respond to any student signals
that this or that feature of the
new curriculum should be
modified.
Why, all in all, my most
satisfying Stanford experience?
Most of all because of the close
association with students — eating
with them twice a day, traveling
with them on field trips, teaching
smaller classes, knowing all your
students as persons. This, rarely
mentioned in discussions of the

foreign campuses, makes teaching
more exciting.
Also seldom mentioned is the
experience of shared
disorientation through exposure
to new atmospheres, new
manners, new voices, new foods. I
have noticed this particularly in
my seminar based on student
writing about the ongoing
European experience.
Every period of transition
involves doubts, every new
academic program elicits
