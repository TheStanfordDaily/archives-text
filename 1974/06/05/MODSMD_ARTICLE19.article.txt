# India, Nuclear Power And Morality
##

Syed Mohammad Tariq

The recent explosion of a nuclear device
by India marks the beginning of
another period of tension and arms race in the
sub-continent. It is likely to have a
destabilizing effect in both the sub-continent
and the world. It has already scuttled the
process of normalization between Pakistan
and India.
Pakistan, which has fought three wars
against India in the past 25 years, has taken
strong exception to India's move and is
compelled to do what it can to restore the
balance of power in the sub-continent.
Indian leaders claim that they have no
intention of developing nuclear weapons. But
the technology for producing a nuclear
explosion is precisely the same regardless of
intent.
Nor have Indian pretensions to a morality
purer than that of other nations been
convincing to those who live beyond her
borders.
Large Amount Of Money
Even if we accept their claim, the amount
of money being spent by Indian government
on nuclear program raises serious questions
about priorities in under-developed nations.
The peaceful uses of nuclear explosions

such as in mining, civil works and for release
of trapped oil and gas, are in the rudimentary
stage and their application is limited even in
advanced countries like the United States and
USSR. A developing nation cannot afford a
substantial expenditure on nuclear programs
without sacrificing development in other
economic sectors.
The Indian move has started a
chain-reaction as other nations that feel
themselves threatened by their neighbors will
try to develop their own nuclear capabilities.
This is precisely the chain-reaction that the
United States and USSR sought to prevent
by co-sponsoring the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty of 1968.
Can't See End
But India, being the first under-developed
nation to detonate a nuclear device, has
opened the flood-gates of nuclear weapons
and no one can say where it all may end.
Between 1950 and 1971, American aid to
India amounted to 10 billion dollars, the
largest amount of assistance given to a single
country in the history of the world.
In the five years from 1969 to 1974, when
80 percent of her children were suffering
from malnutrition, India spent $173 million

on her nuclear program, which is an
interesting exercise in morality.
Many People, Many Problems
With her population of 580 million
increasing at the rate of 13 million annually,
her economy on the verge of collapse because
of food shortage, inflation and increase in the
cost of oil and petroleum by-products, India
plans to spend another $315 million on
nuclear development over the next five years.
At the same time the United States is
planning to resume aid to India this summer
at a level of about $75 million annually.
Going nuclear may give Indian rulers a
tool with which to blackmail her neighbors,
but it will not improve the conditions of the
masses in India. It will not help the 70
percent of the population that is illiterate. It
will not provide shelter for India's homeless
millions.
It will not feed those who will starve this
summer if monsoons fail. It will not provide
jobs for those millions who cannot find
them. India has joined the nuclear club at the
expense of her masses. Unlike incumbents,
the new member is bare-footed and hungry
and as such is more dangerous.
