# University Deficit Grows As Stock Prices Tumble
## 
### DON COX 
Stanford faces a $1.5 million
operating budget deficit as a result of
plunging stock market prices.
In an attempt to minimize the
deficit, principal academic and
administrative officials have been
asked to curtail further hiring and
reduce travel and equipment
expenditures.
This new financial crunch stems
from an anticipated lack of income
normally derived through capital
appreciation on a portion of the
University's endowment.
"While the economic news is not
especially bright, it should not
undermine our determination to
continue providing educational and
scholarly programs of exceptional
merit," President Lyman told the
Faculty Senate last Thursday.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said "it
will require a University-wide effort to
modify our standard of living. If we do
that, we won't need to make cuts in
what this University is all about."
Use Operating Revenues
The deficit will be met from
operating reserves set aside during
Stanford's rapid expansion of the late
1950s and early 19605.
Augsburger said other institutions
have the same problem "whether
they've found out or not. The
indication to us is that others will take
the funds (to pay off the deficit) out
of their endowment principle. The
principle to us is inviolable. Spending
part of the principle just increases
problems down the road."
After adjustment for the
anticipated deficit, operating reserves
will be down to $1.6 million. The
University had anticipated only a
$300,000 deficit for 1973-74 and a
balanced budget in 1974-75.
v Two Parts
Stanford's $350 million
endowment is split into two main
pools — $100 million in a "yield and
gain" pool, and $158 million in a
"merge" pool. The rest of the
endowment is in land and other stock
holdings.
Since 1968, the University has used
approximately $2 million annually
from capita] appreciation of the yield
and gain pool funds to help meet
operating expenses.
While Stanford's performance in
this pool ranked in the top 29 percent
of all professionally managed funds
during 1973, the market value of these
securities dropped below their
recorded value for the first time in
April. Stanford experienced a $3.9
million loss in this pool in April alone.

As a result, there will be little or no
gain in this pool in 1973-74.
The merge pool is invested under
provisions where only dividends and
interest are distributed. Stanford's
merge pool ranks in the top two
percent nationally, Augsburger said.
The $1.2 million decline in the
yield and gain pool breaks down into a
$940,000 drop in unrestricted
endowment income, and a $260,000
drop in restricted endowment income.
Other Problems
Adding to the University's financial
problems this year is a $400,000
decline in unrestricted gifts and a
$200,000 drop in tuition and fees
income, the latter a result of a
decreased spring quarter enrollment.
The University did experience gains in
restricted gifts and other compensating
funds.
Augsburger said that the
economizing moves announced would
not significantly reduce the size of the
deficit and would amount to, at the
very most, $500,000.
He was confident that the standard
of living could be reduced without
affecting University programs. "We
have shown that we can," he said in
reference to the cutbacks which
occurred as a result of the energy
crisis.
Strike Effects
The recent labor strike on campus
also showed that "we don't need quite
the level of service response we've
grown accustomed to."
Augsburger, a former Wall Street
financial analyst, said that University
financial managers probably should
have recognized the danger a few
months back, but even then it would
have been too late to prevent the
current deficit.
He said the performance of
Stanford's investments was "well
above average" and that the present
situation was not at all the fault of
financial managers.
Most of the endowment is managed
by the American Express Asset Co. in
San Francisco.
A committee of the Board of
Trustees oversees investments and is
"concerned with general policy and
surveillance of portfolio management"
said Augsburger. Augsburger said he
and his staff "function as a bridge
between financial and investment
policy."
Interest Income
"Up to the mid-sixties, income was
interest and dividends" and not
appreciation of holdings, Augsburger
said.
Augsburger explained that in the
bull market that followed, dividends
decreased in value and businesses
wanted more income to finance their
activities and programs. Businesses and
institutions complained that they were

missing out on investment
opportunities and were limited in their
overall financial flexibility.
From this attitude evolved the
"total return" concept whereby it was
considered sound financial policy to
spend appreciation on the capital.
Stanford, like everyone else
Augsburger said, adopted the concept
which had "come to be considered as
conventional wisdom."
Augsburger said "the discipline at
Stanford when the yield and gain pool
was established was to never pay out
more in the yield pool than is earned
in the merge pool."

Augsburger outlined his theory on
how the present crisis evolved:
"From the investment point of
view, 1 think we have split off the two
funds, each with different restrictions
and goals. As a result, we have created
an imbalance in each fund," he said.
"In the yield and gain pool there is
more emphasis on investments
designed to produce growth of
principle. Funds there are almost
entirely invested in common stocks,"
he said. More than 83 percent of those
funds have always been invested in
common stocks, Augsburger said.
"The emphasis in the merge pool
has been on income with about 35
percent of those funds in common
stock, 45-55 percent in bonds and
fixed income investments.
Pool Funds
"There is thus the desirability of
pooling the merge and yield and gain
funds back together so that we can
have some investment balance. The
nature of the [financial] game is
hedging. There are too many
variables ... and with each fund
independent, we are in an extreme
position with regard to each.
"If we can move over a three yeai
period to get to a point where we are
dependent on cash income only, that
would be desirable," he said.
"If left to my druthers and if I
didn't have to worry about the
budgeting needs of the University, I'd
get on an income-only basis and not
rely on appreciation for program
commitments," Augsburger
continued.
Augsburger recognized that this was
a conservative financial policy, but in
dealing with a large trust like the
endowment and a long-term
institution, "arguments are in favor of
it."
"We will probably find some
middle ground" between the pooling
of the funds together and the
income-only concept, like "only
distributing a certain percentage of the
unrealized appreciation."

very most, $500,000.
He was confident that the standard
of living could be reduced without
affecting University programs. "We
have shown that we can," he said in
reference to the cutbacks which
occurred as a result of the energy
crisis.
Strike Effects
The recent labor strike on campus
also showed that "we don't need quite
the level of service response we've
grown accustomed to."
Augsburger, a former Wall Street
financial analyst, said that University
financial managers probably should
have recognized the danger a few
months back, but even then it would
have been too late to prevent the
current deficit.
He said the performance of
Stanford's investments was "well
above average" and that the present
situation was not at all the fault of
financial managers.
Most of the endowment is managed
by the American Express Asset Co. in
San Francisco.
A committee of the Board of
Trustees oversees investments and is
"concerned with general policy and
surveillance of portfolio management"
said Augsburger. Augsburger said he
and his staff "function as a bridge
between financial and investment
policy."
Interest Income
"Up to the mid-sixties, income was
interest and dividends" and not
appreciation of holdings, Augsburger
said.
Augsburger explained that in the
bull market that followed, dividends
decreased in value and businesses
wanted more income to finance their
activities and programs. Businesses and
institutions complained that they were

missing out on investment
opportunities and were limited in their
overall financial flexibility.
From this attitude evolved the
"total return" concept whereby it was
considered sound financial policy to
spend appreciation on the capital.
Stanford, like everyone else
Augsburger said, adopted the concept
which had "come to be considered as
conventional wisdom."
Augsburger said "the discipline at
Stanford when the yield and gain pool
was established was to never pay out
more in the yield pool than is earned
in the merge pool."

Augsburger outlined his theory on
how the present crisis evolved:
"From the investment point of
view, 1 think we have split off the two
funds, each with different restrictions
and goals. As a result, we have created
an imbalance in each fund," he said.
"In the yield and gain pool there is
more emphasis on investments
designed to produce growth of
principle. Funds there are almost
entirely invested in common stocks,"
he said. More than 83 percent of those
funds have always been invested in
common stocks, Augsburger said.
"The emphasis in the merge pool
has been on income with about 35
percent of those funds in common
stock, 45-55 percent in bonds and
fixed income investments.
Pool Funds
"There is thus the desirability of
pooling the merge and yield and gain
funds back together so that we can
have some investment balance. The
nature of the [financial] game is
hedging. There are too many
variables ... and with each fund
independent, we are in an extreme
position with regard to each.
"If we can move over a three yeai
period to get to a point where we are
dependent on cash income only, that
would be desirable," he said.
"If left to my druthers and if I
didn't have to worry about the
budgeting needs of the University, I'd
get on an income-only basis and not
rely on appreciation for program
commitments," Augsburger
continued.
Augsburger recognized that this was
a conservative financial policy, but in
dealing with a large trust like the
endowment and a long-term
institution, "arguments are in favor of
it."
"We will probably find some
middle ground" between the pooling
of the funds together and the
income-only concept, like "only
distributing a certain percentage of the
unrealized appreciation."
Stanford faces a $1.5 million
operating budget deficit as a result of
plunging stock market prices.
In an attempt to minimize the
deficit, principal academic and
administrative officials have been
asked to curtail further hiring and
reduce travel and equipment
expenditures.
This new financial crunch stems
from an anticipated lack of income
normally derived through capital
appreciation on a portion of the
University's endowment.
"While the economic news is not
especially bright, it should not
undermine our determination to
continue providing educational and
scholarly programs of exceptional
merit," President Lyman told the
Faculty Senate last Thursday.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said "it
will require a University-wide effort to
modify our standard of living. If we do
that, we won't need to make cuts in
what this University is all about."
Use Operating Revenues
The deficit will be met from
operating reserves set aside during
Stanford's rapid expansion of the late
1950s and early 19605.
Augsburger said other institutions
have the same problem "whether
they've found out or not. The
indication to us is that others will take
the funds (to pay off the deficit) out
of their endowment principle. The
principle to us is inviolable. Spending
part of the principle just increases
problems down the road."
After adjustment for the
anticipated deficit, operating reserves
will be down to $1.6 million. The
University had anticipated only a
$300,000 deficit for 1973-74 and a
balanced budget in 1974-75.
v Two Parts
Stanford's $350 million
endowment is split into two main
pools — $100 million in a "yield and
gain" pool, and $158 million in a
"merge" pool. The rest of the
endowment is in land and other stock
holdings.
Since 1968, the University has used
approximately $2 million annually
from capita] appreciation of the yield
and gain pool funds to help meet
operating expenses.
While Stanford's performance in
this pool ranked in the top 29 percent
of all professionally managed funds
during 1973, the market value of these
securities dropped below their
recorded value for the first time in
April. Stanford experienced a $3.9
million loss in this pool in April alone.

As a result, there will be little or no
gain in this pool in 1973-74.
The merge pool is invested under
provisions where only dividends and
interest are distributed. Stanford's
merge pool ranks in the top two
percent nationally, Augsburger said.
The $1.2 million decline in the
yield and gain pool breaks down into a
$940,000 drop in unrestricted
endowment income, and a $260,000
drop in restricted endowment income.
Other Problems
Adding to the University's financial
problems this year is a $400,000
decline in unrestricted gifts and a
$200,000 drop in tuition and fees
income, the latter a result of a
decreased spring quarter enrollment.
The University did experience gains in
restricted gifts and other compensating
funds.
Augsburger said that the
economizing moves announced would
not significantly reduce the size of the
deficit and would amount to, at the
very most, $500,000.
He was confident that the standard
of living could be reduced without

get on an income-only basis and not
rely on appreciation for program
commitments," Augsburger
continued.
Augsburger recognized that this was
a conservative financial policy, but in
dealing with a large trust like the
endowment and a long-term
institution, "arguments are in favor of
it."
"We will probably find some
middle ground" between the pooling
of the funds together and the
income-only concept, like "only
distributing a certain percentage of the
unrealized appreciation."
Stanford faces a $1.5 million
operating budget deficit as a result of
plunging stock market prices.
In an attempt to minimize the
deficit, principal academic and
administrative officials have been
asked to curtail further hiring and
reduce travel and equipment
expenditures.
This new financial crunch stems
from an anticipated lack of income
normally derived through capital
appreciation on a portion of the
University's endowment.
"While the economic news is not
especially bright, it should not
undermine our determination to
continue providing educational and
scholarly programs of exceptional
merit," President Lyman told the
Faculty Senate last Thursday.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said "it
will require a University-wide effort to
modify our standard of living. If we do
that, we won't need to make cuts in
what this University is all about."
Use Operating Revenues
The deficit will be met from
operating reserves set aside during
Stanford's rapid expansion of the late
1950s and early 19605.
Augsburger said other institutions
have the same problem "whether
they've found out or not. The
indication to us is that others will take
the funds (to pay off the deficit) out
of their endowment principle. The
principle to us is inviolable. Spending
part of the principle just increases
problems down the road."
After adjustment for the
anticipated deficit, operating reserves
will be down to $1.6 million. The
University had anticipated only a
$300,000 deficit for 1973-74 and a
balanced budget in 1974-75.
v Two Parts
Stanford's $350 million
endowment is split into two main
pools — $100 million in a "yield and
gain" pool, and $158 million in a
"merge" pool. The rest of the
endowment is in land and other stock
holdings.
Since 1968, the University has used
approximately $2 million annually
from capita] appreciation of the yield
and gain pool funds to help meet
operating expenses.
While Stanford's performance in
this pool ranked in the top 29 percent
of all professionally managed funds
during 1973, the market value of these
securities dropped below their
recorded value for the first time in
April. Stanford experienced a $3.9
million loss in this pool in April alone.

As a result, there will be little or no
gain in this pool in 1973-74.
The merge pool is invested under
provisions where only dividends and
interest are distributed. Stanford's
merge pool ranks in the top two
percent nationally, Augsburger said.
The $1.2 million decline in the
yield and gain pool breaks down into a
$940,000 drop in unrestricted
endowment income, and a $260,000
drop in restricted endowment income.
Other Problems
Adding to the University's financial
problems this year is a $400,000
decline in unrestricted gifts and a
$200,000 drop in tuition and fees
income, the latter a result of a
decreased spring quarter enrollment.
The University did experience gains in
restricted gifts and other compensating
funds.
Augsburger said that the
economizing moves announced would
not significantly reduce the size of the
deficit and would amount to, at the
very most, $500,000.
He was confident that the standard
of living could be reduced without
affecting University programs. "We
have shown that we can," he said in
reference to the cutbacks which
occurred as a result of the energy
crisis.
Strike Effects
The recent labor strike on campus
also showed that "we don't need quite
the level of service response we've
grown accustomed to."
Augsburger, a former Wall Street
financial analyst, said that University
financial managers probably should
have recognized the danger a few
months back, but even then it would
have been too late to prevent the
current deficit.
He said the performance of
Stanford's investments was "well
above average" and that the present
situation was not at all the fault of
financial managers.
Most of the endowment is managed
by the American Express Asset Co. in
San Francisco.
A committee of the Board of
Trustees oversees investments and is
"concerned with general policy and
surveillance of portfolio management"
said Augsburger. Augsburger said he
and his staff "function as a bridge
between financial and investment
policy."
Interest Income
"Up to the mid-sixties, income was
interest and dividends" and not
appreciation of holdings, Augsburger
said.
Augsburger explained that in the
bull market that followed, dividends
decreased in value and businesses
wanted more income to finance their
activities and programs. Businesses and
institutions complained that they were

missing out on investment
opportunities and were limited in their
overall financial flexibility.
From this attitude evolved the
"total return" concept whereby it was
considered sound financial policy to
spend appreciation on the capital.
Stanford, like everyone else
Augsburger said, adopted the concept
which had "come to be considered as
conventional wisdom."
Augsburger said "the discipline at
Stanford when the yield and gain pool
was established was to never pay out
more in the yield pool than is earned
in the merge pool."

Augsburger outlined his theory on
how the present crisis evolved:
"From the investment point of
view, 1 think we have split off the two
funds, each with different restrictions
and goals. As a result, we have created
an imbalance in each fund," he said.
"In the yield and gain pool there is
more emphasis on investments
designed to produce growth of
principle. Funds there are almost
entirely invested in common stocks,"
he said. More than 83 percent of those
funds have always been invested in
common stocks, Augsburger said.
"The emphasis in the merge pool
has been on income with about 35
percent of those funds in common
stock, 45-55 percent in bonds and
fixed income investments.
Pool Funds
"There is thus the desirability of
pooling the merge and yield and gain
funds back together so that we can
have some investment balance. The
nature of the [financial] game is
hedging. There are too many
variables ... and with each fund
independent, we are in an extreme
position with regard to each.
"If we can move over a three yeai
period to get to a point where we are
dependent on cash income only, that
would be desirable," he said.
"If left to my druthers and if I
didn't have to worry about the
budgeting needs of the University, I'd
get on an income-only basis and not
rely on appreciation for program
commitments," Augsburger
continued.

drop in restricted endowment income.
Other Problems
Adding to the University's financial
problems this year is a $400,000
decline in unrestricted gifts and a
$200,000 drop in tuition and fees
income, the latter a result of a
decreased spring quarter enrollment.
The University did experience gains in
restricted gifts and other compensating
funds.
Augsburger said that the
economizing moves announced would
not significantly reduce the size of the
deficit and would amount to, at the
very most, $500,000.
He was confident that the standard
of living could be reduced without
affecting University programs. "We
have shown that we can," he said in
reference to the cutbacks which
occurred as a result of the energy
crisis.
Strike Effects
The recent labor strike on campus
also showed that "we don't need quite
the level of service response we've
grown accustomed to."
Augsburger, a former Wall Street
financial analyst, said that University
financial managers probably should
have recognized the danger a few
months back, but even then it would
have been too late to prevent the
current deficit.
He said the performance of
Stanford's investments was "well
above average" and that the present
situation was not at all the fault of
financial managers.
Most of the endowment is managed
by the American Express Asset Co. in
San Francisco.
A committee of the Board of
Trustees oversees investments and is
"concerned with general policy and
surveillance of portfolio management"
said Augsburger. Augsburger said he
and his staff "function as a bridge
between financial and investment
policy."
Interest Income
"Up to the mid-sixties, income was
interest and dividends" and not
appreciation of holdings, Augsburger
said.
Augsburger explained that in the
bull market that followed, dividends
decreased in value and businesses
wanted more income to finance their
activities and programs. Businesses and
institutions complained that they were

missing out on investment
opportunities and were limited in their
overall financial flexibility.
From this attitude evolved the
"total return" concept whereby it was
considered sound financial policy to
spend appreciation on the capital.
Stanford, like everyone else
Augsburger said, adopted the concept
which had "come to be considered as
conventional wisdom."
Augsburger said "the discipline at
Stanford when the yield and gain pool
was established was to never pay out
more in the yield pool than is earned
in the merge pool."

Augsburger outlined his theory on
how the present crisis evolved:
"From the investment point of
view, 1 think we have split off the two
funds, each with different restrictions
and goals. As a result, we have created
an imbalance in each fund," he said.
"In the yield and gain pool there is
more emphasis on investments
designed to produce growth of
principle. Funds there are almost
entirely invested in common stocks,"
he said. More than 83 percent of those
funds have always been invested in
common stocks, Augsburger said.
"The emphasis in the merge pool
has been on income with about 35
percent of those funds in common
stock, 45-55 percent in bonds and
fixed income investments.
Pool Funds
"There is thus the desirability of
pooling the merge and yield and gain
funds back together so that we can
have some investment balance. The
nature of the [financial] game is
hedging. There are too many
variables ... and with each fund
independent, we are in an extreme
position with regard to each.
"If we can move over a three yeai
period to get to a point where we are
dependent on cash income only, that
would be desirable," he said.
"If left to my druthers and if I
didn't have to worry about the
budgeting needs of the University, I'd
get on an income-only basis and not
rely on appreciation for program
commitments," Augsburger
continued.
Augsburger recognized that this was
a conservative financial policy, but in
dealing with a large trust like the
endowment and a long-term
institution, "arguments are in favor of
it."
"We will probably find some
middle ground" between the pooling
of the funds together and the
income-only concept, like "only
distributing a certain percentage of the
unrealized appreciation."
