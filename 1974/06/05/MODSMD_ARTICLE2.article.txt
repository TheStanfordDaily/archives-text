# University Deficit Grows As Stock Prices Tumble

### DON COX 
Stanford faces a $1.5 million
operating budget deficit as a result of
plunging stock market prices.
In an attempt to minimize the
deficit, principal academic and
administrative officials have been
asked to curtail further hiring and
reduce travel and equipment
expenditures.
This new financial crunch stems
from an anticipated lack of income
normally derived through capital
appreciation on a portion of the
University's endowment.
"While the economic news is not
especially bright, it should not
undermine our determination to
continue providing educational and
scholarly programs of exceptional
merit," President Lyman told the
Faculty Senate last Thursday.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said "it
will require a University-wide effort to
modify our standard of living. If we do
that, we won't need to make cuts in
what this University is all about."
Use Operating Revenues
The deficit will be met from
operating reserves set aside during
Stanford's rapid expansion of the late
1950s and early 19605.
Augsburger said other institutions
have the same problem "whether
they've found out or not. The
indication to us is that others will take
the funds (to pay off the deficit) out
of their endowment principle. The
principle to us is inviolable. Spending
part of the principle just increases
problems down the road."
After adjustment for the
anticipated deficit, operating reserves
will be down to $1.6 million. The
University had anticipated only a
$300,000 deficit for 1973-74 and a
balanced budget in 1974-75.
v Two Parts
Stanford's $350 million
endowment is split into two main
pools — $100 million in a "yield and
gain" pool, and $158 million in a
"merge" pool. The rest of the
endowment is in land and other stock
holdings.
Since 1968, the University has used
approximately $2 million annually
from capita] appreciation of the yield
and gain pool funds to help meet
operating expenses.
While Stanford's performance in
this pool ranked in the top 29 percent
of all professionally managed funds
during 1973, the market value of these
securities dropped below their
recorded value for the first time in
April. Stanford experienced a $3.9
million loss in this pool in April alone.

As a result, there will be little or no
gain in this pool in 1973-74.
The merge pool is invested under
provisions where only dividends and
interest are distributed. Stanford's
merge pool ranks in the top two
percent nationally, Augsburger said.
The $1.2 million decline in the
yield and gain pool breaks down into a
$940,000 drop in unrestricted
endowment income, and a $260,000
drop in restricted endowment income.
Other Problems
Adding to the University's financial
problems this year is a $400,000
decline in unrestricted gifts and a
$200,000 drop in tuition and fees
income, the latter a result of a
decreased spring quarter enrollment.
The University did experience gains in
restricted gifts and other compensating
