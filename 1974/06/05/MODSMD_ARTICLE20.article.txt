On ROTC 'Support'
Editor:
In regard to che article on the
117 frosh interested in ROTC, I
hope when the administration
views this "show of support" they
remember that student support
for Bruce Franklin was greater
than 50 percent in the referendum
in 1972. That was over 1000
students and perhaps over 2000.
Also remember the recent
petitions of interest in a Marxian
economist.
It would be more than
hypocritical, in fact it would seem
to be politically motivated, if this
puny show of support was even
considered in view of past
administration consideration of
student support in other areas.
Another blatant example is the
referendums of 1971 and 1972
supporting removal of recruiters
from the armed forces or
"war-corporations" from the
placement center.

Against Flick Forum
Editor:
This letter is written as a
complaint against Bob Sisson's
policy of using the Sunday Flicks
as a forum for local social and
political causes. Regardless of the
merit of the particular causes he
chooses to give time to, or of his
willingness to allow equal time for
rebuttal, I feel that it is
presumptuous of him to assume
that the majority of Flicks
patrons desire political or social
enlightenment of any sort on
Sunday nights.
If Bob Sisson or any manager
would like to use the Flicks as a
soap box, he is entitled to

establish that policy. However, I
feel that he owes it to the
community members who attend
the Sunday night movies to
inform them of such intentions.
Up until recently I had assumed
that the Flicks were purely for
entertainment, and was irritated
when people began to appear on
stage and plead for my support.
Clearly, such unannounced
presentations amount to little
more than the exploitation of a
virtually captive audience. I
suggest that Bob Sisson either
inform patrons in advance that
there will be (for instance) a USE
sermon or a Columbae
presentation or that he schedule
such orations after the movie,when
those who paid to see the show
have more of an opportunity to
stand up and cheer — or go home.
In short, there are those of us
who wish to remain ignorant, and
they should be allowed, I feel, the
opportunity to pursue that
happiness.

Get USE Out!
Editor:
A call to get USE out!
USE is a disaster. It is harming
the University and the workers.
The premature strike is doing
nothing but inflicting hardship on
the striking workers and also
causing unnecessary expense for
added police protection and for
repairs to sabotaged facilities.
A few of us at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center have
formed 'The Committee to Get
USE Out," and have been
soliciting signatures on a
petition to the NLRB, calling for a
decertification election. To date

we have about one-fourth of the
SLAC bargaining unit's signatures.
In order to call an election, we
need signatures from one-third of
the total bargaining unit.
Therefore, we are asking those of
you on campus who feel that the
University would be a better place
without USE to join us in
collecting signatures.
To get copies of the petition,
please call extension 2448 or
2625 at SLAC.

Mem Loo?
Editor:
About the time of the
installation of the new traffic
signals at the intersection of
Foothill Boulevard and Mayfield
Avenue, there appeared a peculiar
structure of undetermined
function and with a porcelain-like
exterior resembling objects
designed by American Standard.
Since it is unlikely that this
sort of thing is its function, just
why is it there and what does it
do? Shall it be named Mem Loo
or Mem Lav?

Morally Indefensible?
Editor:
According to the Bible — the
accuracy of which Bill Evers says
he accepted for the purpose of his
article (Daily, May 23) — Jesus
spent his life healing the diseased
and crippled, raising the dead, and
teaching that love and humility
are better than hate and
aggression. Subjected to a rigged
trial, ridiculed, tortured, and

nailed to a cfoss to die of thirst
and his last prayer was
"Father, forgive them; for they
know not what they do" (Luke
23:34).
Against all this, Evers says that
Jesus was "morally indefensible"
because (1) he ruined a fig tree,
(2) he ruined a herd of pigs, (3) he
believed in hell (from which,
Evers neglects to mention, he
tried to save people — a highly
moral thing to do, I would have
thought).
It is evident that Evers' article
was either a dishonest attempt to
be controversial, or else written
with complete disregard for
common sense. Either way, the
article was, excuse the expression,
morally indefensible.

Not Packeted Wine!
Editor:
I'm not complaining about
Doug Archerd's piece on tours
through the winery-country. Yet
imagining a "Shangri-La where the
sun shines warmly on fields of

vines surrounded by bright
flowers, where shady lanes and
leisurely highways wind relaxedly
between stately oaks and small,
friendly towns" becomes
far-fetched when introduced with
the pleasant print of the old
Beringer Winery.
At a wine-tasting next door
two weekends ago, the Charles
Krug people complained about
the new mechanized plant the
Beringer people now plan to
construct 50 feet from the lawned
wine-tasting grounds used by the
Krug people.
Beringer's, now a part of the
giant Nestle's Tea complex, will
soon manufacture wine in greater
quantity with its new facility.
One's imagination instead darts
from Archerd's pleasant fantasy
to the frightening nightmare of
instant wine powder made
available in tinfoil packets
produced by Nestle's.
Protest! Write the St. Helena
City Council! Write some wine
council! Write your Congressman!
Write the President! Do
something! It's only 1974.
