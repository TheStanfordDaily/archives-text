That day will come. It will be very hot and very
still.
We will sit a moment, tired, and wipe our fore
heads on our
shirt-sleeves, and lean on our carbines, and draw
designs in
the dust with the tips of our boots.
We will look back down the road and remember
the endless,
slow, heavy steps.

We will wonder how far we have to go.
Suddenly, something will flutter, something
remembered.
The dust will billow as if beaten by unseen wings
and for a second the sweat will feel cool on our
foreheads.
Then it will pass.
Mizmoon, Camilla, Angela, sisters.
You were like birds
and revolution is a turtle.
