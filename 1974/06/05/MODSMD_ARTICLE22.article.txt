# Christians And God's Plan

I read the Daily's recent article
on Dean Robert Hamerton-Kelly
with mixed emotion. Although
some of Hamerton-Kelley's views
make good sense and are
theologically sound, others left
me with a feeling that he, like so
many people, has completely
missed the real purpose of God's
plan for this age.
Many religious leaders would
like us to believe that His plan is
the creation of a single world
religious organization, a great
ecumenical church. Such an
organization would unite all
people under a common belief,
but would reduce Christianity to a
mere religion and the Bible to a
"sacred book."
So many compromises would
have to be made as to ultimately

deny the deity of Jesus Christ.
This plan is actually under the
influence of Satan, to divert the
work of God's people to worthless
projects.
Many people believe that God's
plan is the correction of social
injustices and that the church is a
kind of clearinghouse for
programs for social reform. As
well meaning as these may be,
they are merely another diversion
by Satan to tie up the lives of
otherwise effective servants of
God.
Plan Much Simpler
God's plan is much simpler and
has farther reaching consequences
than those dreamed up by man:
to establish His people. "Simeon
has related how God first visited
the Gentiles, to take out of them
a people for his name (Acts
15:14)." This is His plan,and has
been since the death and
resurrection of Christ; and it is the
only plan that is really to be
considered by Christians as worth
doing. Now I'm not saying that
we shouldn't help others around
us, but our first concern should be
in spreading God's word.
The problems of society are
the result of the basic sinful
nature of man. Until this
condition is remedied, there is no
point in trying to correct society's
wrongs. This is the main purpose
of Christianity.
What most people overlook is
that Christianity is not a mere
religion — it is a way of life.
Webster defines religion as a
system of faith and worship, the
service to and adoration of God
expressed in forms of worship.
Most Religions
In most religions, man reaches,
out to God, and then keeps him at
arm's length, or puts him into a
little box labeled "what I want
God to be." In Christianity, God
is reaching down to man, offering

him the peace and love that
cannot be found on earth.
There are those who contend
that man is not basically sinful,
that there was no "original sin,"
and that therefore there does not
need to be any forgiveness. Such
an attitude is at best a poor
rationalization, especially when all
one needs to do is to pick up and
look through the daily newspaper
and read about man's basic
inhumanity to man — robbery,
rape, murder, war.. .. The list is
endless.
The truly wonderful part of
Christian faith is its simplicity. No
religion in the world offers
freedom and salvation at such a
price.
Admit Imperfection
Whereas most religions preach
the need to do good works, to
search continually, to "know
thyself" or to depend on oneself,
Christianity asks you only to
admit that you are imperfect, that
you are a sinner, and believe that
Jesus Christ died for you to
overcome the power of sin. That's
easy.
So why the problem? Well,
many people won't admit that
they are less than perfect. Others
think that this is too easy, that
they have to prove themselves by
being "good," by trying to please
God. The result is frustration.
The simplicity of the Christian
faith has been lost. Men now seek
to align themselves with programs
for correcting social injustice
without -ever seeking to eliminate
the real problem — man's sinful
nature.
This is the duty of the Church
and of all Christians in this world.
This is God's plan — to call out a
people for his name; to bring all
men to Him in peace and in love.

There are those who contend
that man is not basically sinful,
that there was no "original sin,"
and that therefore there does not
need to be any forgiveness. Such
an attitude is at best a poor
rationalization, especially when all
one needs to do is to pick up and
look through the daily newspaper
and read about man's basic
inhumanity to man — robbery,
rape, murder, war.. .. The list is
endless.
The truly wonderful part of
Christian faith is its simplicity. No
religion in the world offers
freedom and salvation at such a
price.
Admit Imperfection
Whereas most religions preach
the need to do good works, to
search continually, to "know
thyself" or to depend on oneself,
Christianity asks you only to
admit that you are imperfect, that
you are a sinner, and believe that
Jesus Christ died for you to
overcome the power of sin. That's
easy.
So why the problem? Well,
many people won't admit that
they are less than perfect. Others
think that this is too easy, that
they have to prove themselves by
being "good," by trying to please
God. The result is frustration.
The simplicity of the Christian
faith has been lost. Men now seek
to align themselves with programs
for correcting social injustice
without -ever seeking to eliminate
the real problem — man's sinful
nature.
This is the duty of the Church
and of all Christians in this world.
This is God's plan — to call out a
people for his name; to bring all
men to Him in peace and in love.

I read the Daily's recent article
on Dean Robert Hamerton-Kelly
with mixed emotion. Although
some of Hamerton-Kelley's views
make good sense and are
theologically sound, others left
me with a feeling that he, like so
many people, has completely
missed the real purpose of God's
plan for this age.
Many religious leaders would
like us to believe that His plan is
the creation of a single world
religious organization, a great
ecumenical church. Such an
organization would unite all
people under a common belief,
but would reduce Christianity to a
mere religion and the Bible to a
"sacred book."
So many compromises would
have to be made as to ultimately

deny the deity of Jesus Christ.
This plan is actually under the
influence of Satan, to divert the
work of God's people to worthless
projects.
Many people believe that God's
plan is the correction of social
injustices and that the church is a
kind of clearinghouse for
programs for social reform. As
well meaning as these may be,
they are merely another diversion
by Satan to tie up the lives of
otherwise effective servants of
God.
Plan Much Simpler
God's plan is much simpler and
has farther reaching consequences
than those dreamed up by man:
to establish His people. "Simeon
has related how God first visited
the Gentiles, to take out of them
a people for his name (Acts
15:14)." This is His plan,and has
been since the death and
resurrection of Christ; and it is the
only plan that is really to be
considered by Christians as worth
doing. Now I'm not saying that
we shouldn't help others around
us, but our first concern should be
in spreading God's word.
The problems of society are
the result of the basic sinful
nature of man. Until this
condition is remedied, there is no
point in trying to correct society's
wrongs. This is the main purpose
of Christianity.
What most people overlook is
that Christianity is not a mere
religion — it is a way of life.
Webster defines religion as a
system of faith and worship, the
service to and adoration of God
expressed in forms of worship.
Most Religions
In most religions, man reaches,
out to God, and then keeps him at
arm's length, or puts him into a
little box labeled "what I want
God to be." In Christianity, God
is reaching down to man, offering

him the peace and love that
cannot be found on earth.
There are those who contend
that man is not basically sinful,
that there was no "original sin,"
and that therefore there does not
need to be any forgiveness. Such
