## Time And Life 
### 
Joseph Ng

Time "is our most precious,
most limited resource. We cannot
rent, buy, borrow or steal more of
it." We should do what we
"ought" to, and not waste time in
"non-essential" work, "day
dreaming" and "unnecessary"
meeting with friends.
Thus Javed Shah enjoins us to
use time efficiently. All this is
very true. But is that all there is â€”
time? What about life?
This is not to negate the
importance of the efficient use of
time but to add dimensions to it.
There are many aspects of
human experience that merit our
spending time on it. There are
"non-essential" things that are
worth doing and very often they
are rewarding.
We should find time to pause
and look at a flower when we
walk past it. We should be able to
spend a few hours on weekends

doing some "unnecessary"
meeting with friends, having some
cheese and wine. These might
be glimpses that we will relish
when we stand and look back
later in our life.
I believe we are all too
goal-oriented; the Puritan work
ethic and its attendant acquisitive
spirit make work a value, an end
in itself. Our life becomes a race
with time, sometimes a blind
pursuit.
There are some who cannot
enjoy anything else but work and
that probably accounts for the
difficulties in adjustment for
65-ers who, upon retirement, find
all that they have is time, and
hopefully money, but nothing
else. Instead of reaping the fruits
of a lifetime, they only find they
cannot live life.
