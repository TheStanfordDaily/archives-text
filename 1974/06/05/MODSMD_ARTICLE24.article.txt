# On Women's Basketball Coaching

I would like to respond to some
comments attributed to Shirley Schoof,
women's varsity basketball "coach," in the
article "Players See Need for Change (Daily,
May 29)." In her comments, Schoof
misrepresented some facts about the varsity
basketball situation.
In the survey for the article, the entire
women's varsity basketball team, as well as a
majority of the hockey team, also "coached"
by Schoof, responded that her "coaching"
was inadequate and in fact, very poor.
It seems strange that knowing these facts,
and having admitted as much to the whole
basketball team at several points during the
season, Schoof should feel that she is
"qualified [to coachj after the three year
experience." She's tried hard, it's true, but
her lack of knowledge is pitifully obvious in
practices when she is unable to tell the
difference between a 1-2-1 zone (which
doesn't exist) and a 2-1-2 zone.
That Howie Dallmar is also criticized for
his coaching is irrelevant to an evaluation of
Schoof. At least Dallmar, for all his faults,
has played the game and has 20-plus years of
coaching experience. Schoof, too, may be a
barely adequate coach after 25 years
experience, but we can't wait that long.
'Total Lack Of Knowledge'
It is not made clear in the article that the
reason that the varsity had difficulty
"put( ting J away individual ambitions and
act[ingj like a team,was because Schoof

solicited comments and coaching assistance
from all members of the team to buttress her
total lack of knowledge, and never had the
strength to choose between these competing
suggestions and to make her decision stick.
In short, the varsity lacked a leader.
Pleasant as it may appear to have inputs from
all sides, an athletic team cannot function as
a democracy.
No matter how skillful the players, some
one individual must be able to say, "This is
what we're going to do," and be obeyed
without question. This position is generally
filled by a coach, but we didn't have one.
JV's 'As Good'?
That the JV's were "every bit as good" as
the varsity is debatable, but accepting this,
arguendo, it may merely reflect the high
caliber of athletes on the basketball teams.
Since the varsity lost only two of their games
by more than three points, even with no
"coaching," a high caliber of athletes seems
reasonably plausible.
The JV's excellent record is easily
explained by the fact that they played other
JV teams while the varsity played varsity
teams. In fact, the JV's only loss of the
season came when Schoof allowed the JV's
to play the University of Santa Clara's
varsity, a game which the Stanford JV's lost
convincingly. One week later, the Stanford
varsity played the University of Santa Clara,
only to lose by one point.
Though Schoof may enjoy coaching, a

fact which she denied often during the season
to the detriment of the team's morale, she
was eager to act as figurehead while a man,
who had volunteered his services, coached
the team.
Male Coach Vetoed
The team was enthusiastic about this
prospect and Schoof was acquiescent, but the
department chair"man," Pamela Strathairn,
vetoed this possibility without explanation to
the team.
It seems strange that when dissatisfaction
with the coaching is so high and the
assistance offered is free, such an offer
should be rejected, but Pam Strathairn, has
for years resisted the incursion of men into
her holy female sanctum, though other teams
in the league have male assistant coaches.
Finally, Schoof's defensive attitude is
easily seen in her statement, "if we were
winning there wouldn't be all this
dissatisfaction." This seems unlikely
particularly because the hockey team, which
is league champion, is largely dissatisfied with
Schoof's coaching also.
Things are critically wrong in the
Women's Physical Education Department,
especially in the team sports of hockey and
basketball. Even a coach's self-defense won't
hide the dissatisfaction that is rapidly rising
to outrage.
