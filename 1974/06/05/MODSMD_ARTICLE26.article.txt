Is there a University publication which lists privileges of being a
Stanford student? Such thing as rental horses at the Red Barn boats
on Lagunita, hiking privileges, etc. are frequently hard to uncover
especially for graduate students who don't live on campus. L.L.
There are a couple of different publications that might be able to
provide the information that you want.
The International Center puts out an information packet for all
foreign students but the receptionist said that the information would
be useful to American undergraduates as well. She said that in
addition to information about the University, the booklet gives
helpful hints about living in the Stanford area - things like where to
buy furniture, cars, etc.
The ASSU puts out a booklet entitled "Student Activities" which
lists groups, clubs and organizations on campus, along with a short
description of their activities. You might want to get information on
the activity that you are interested in from the appropriate group.
The Dean of Student Affairs' office puts out two publications - a
pamphlet on student dependent services and the Student Yellow
Pages, a fantastic directory for the student who can only throw up his
hands and say, "Who can I call to find information on that??"
According to associate dean Dan Williams, this publication might
be distributed to all students next year. He said that the Committee
on Services to Students recommended that this be done, but that a
tight budget might prevent University-wide distribution.
Check with the Campus Affairs division of the Dean of Student
Affairs' office next fall to find out who has received copies of the
Student Yellow Pages. Copies may have been distributed to places
easily accessible to students.
