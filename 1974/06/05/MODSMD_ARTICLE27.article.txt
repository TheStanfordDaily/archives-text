# Unmarried Couples: Problems Of Living Together
## 
### PATTY FELS 
"My parents don't know that
Mike and I are living together,"
says Mary Lou, a University
employee living with a Stanford
graduate student. "My mother
wrote me and said, 'Never tell me
if you're going to live with
anyone,' so I took her at her
word.
"They don't even know that I
have a phone so I just call them
and say I'm at a pay phone."
Thinking a second, she adds,
"They're a bit dense since I'm not
putting any money in it or
anything."
Mary Lou and Mike live
together in Escondido Village — a
University apartment complex for
married students only. "At first
we were worried that the
University would find out," Mary
Lou remembers. "But they don't
check you, really."
Problems like this are
commonplace for most unmarried

students living together. Finding a
place to live, maintaining separate
phones — in general, just keeping
up appearances for family, friends
and, above all, the University —
can become very difficult.
University Policy
"Official University policy is to
prohibit co-habitation," states
Larry Horton, assistant dean of
student affairs.
But, in almost the same breath,
he adds, "Of course, this is 1974.
I wouldn't be surprised to hear
that students are living together in
all sorts of places all over the
campus."
However, "official University
policy" can often make things
pretty sticky. Janet and Randy
have been living together in
Mirrielees for two years. Last year
Randy, a philosophy grad student,
drew into his apartment with a
male friend who planned to live
off campus. Janet lived in the
apartment and paid rent to the

friend, who then paid it to the
University.
This year, Randy planned to
graduate after winter quarter and
would not be permitted to stay in
University housing during the
spring. So his off-campus male
friend persuaded his roommate to
draw with him. They drew back
into Mirrielees and turned the
apartment over to Randy and
Janet for another year.
Technicalities
"It's really getting technical
now," Janet, a junior in political
science, says. "Two people who
aren't us supposedly live in this
room."
But the problems they've had
with the University are nothing
compared to their problems with
parents. "My parents know and
his don't," says Janet. "His
parents live a lot farther away so
it's easier to hide. They're solid
Protestants and he decided that
they might threaten to cut off

money if they found out."
So Randy decided to tell his
parents that he didn't have a
phone. "But they started insisting
that he get one," Janet recalls. "It
was getting down to a showdown
where they said 'get a phone' and
he wouldn't."
Now the couple has two
phones — both on the same table.
One is for Randy's parents — who
call about once a month — and
the other is for everyone else.
Dormitory Problems
Dormitories pose different
problems. Although the days of
bed checks and curfews are long
gone, some residence assistants
still object to open co-habitation.
"My R.A. didn't approve of
it,"says Jayne, who lives in a
freshman dorm. "He didn't allow
roommate switching all year and
he told us we shouldn't do it." In
spite of this, she and her
boyfriend Rick have moved in
together — and so have their old

roommates.
When the two of them would
spend the night, his roommate
would always leave the room.
"My boyfriend's roommate
needed a place to sleep so he
usually slept up in my room," she
remembers. "He and my
roommate were just friends
though — they didn't have sex."
'Still Just Friends'
Before spring quarter, their
dorm voted to make the corridors
coed — before there had been one
floor for boys and one for girls.
At that time Jayne and Rick
moved in together permanently —
and so did their roommates.
"They sleep together now but
they're still just friends," Jayne
says."I guess it's a pretty unusual
way for things to work out."
How do the other freshmen in
her dorm react to the situation?
"I'm in a really conservative
dorm, I think," Jayne says. "A lot
of people really frown upon this.
They don't come up and tell you
though — they just whisper.
For gay couples living together,
problems like phones and
roommates don't exist. "It's a lot
easier at this point in life being
gay," says Craig, a first year

medical student. "At this point
it's very natural I living with
someone of the same sex], but
once I assume a position of
financial responsibility, that's
when the time comes. Then it
becomes a little bit unusual or
questionable."
Many Problems
While students living together
have most of the problems of
married students — for example,
budgeting and division of
housework — they have few of the
advantages.
"My girlfriend can't get student
football tickets or student
basketball tickets whereas the
wife of a Stanford student could,"
says John, a junior in political
science. "We go to a football game
and I can buy a ticket and sit in
the student seats whereas Kim has
to sit in the reserved section.
"During spring break, she and I
went on the charter flight to
Hawaii. I was forced to lie and say
she was my wife and sign her
name as my name. Then we got
hassled at the airport," he
recounts.
He and Kim, a non-student,
also tried to apply for a joint
checking account but were turned

down because they weren't
married.
Advantages Outweigh Problems
However, the advantages of
living together far outweigh the
problems for most couples.
Most couples cite "more
freedom" as a reason for not
getting married. "Society tends to
define what a married relationship
should be, and we like the idea of
defining our own relationship,"
says John. "It's a lot easier for us
to have friends of the opposite sex
if we're not married."
For these couples, living
together seems to be the best of
all possible worlds, and they're
not anxious to change anything.
As Gwen says,"I kind of think
getting married would spoil the
relationship."
"My parents don't know that
Mike and I are living together,"
says Mary Lou, a University
employee living with a Stanford
graduate student. "My mother
wrote me and said, 'Never tell me
if you're going to live with
anyone,' so I took her at her
word.
"They don't even know that I
have a phone so I just call them
and say I'm at a pay phone."

However, the advantages of
living together far outweigh the
problems for most couples.
Most couples cite "more
freedom" as a reason for not
getting married. "Society tends to
define what a married relationship
should be, and we like the idea of
defining our own relationship,"
says John. "It's a lot easier for us
to have friends of the opposite sex
if we're not married."
For these couples, living
together seems to be the best of
all possible worlds, and they're
not anxious to change anything.
As Gwen says,"I kind of think
getting married would spoil the
relationship."
"My parents don't know that
Mike and I are living together,"
says Mary Lou, a University
employee living with a Stanford
graduate student. "My mother
wrote me and said, 'Never tell me
if you're going to live with
anyone,' so I took her at her
word.
"They don't even know that I
have a phone so I just call them
and say I'm at a pay phone."
Thinking a second, she adds,
"They're a bit dense since I'm not
putting any money in it or
anything."
Mary Lou and Mike live
together in Escondido Village — a
University apartment complex for
married students only. "At first
we were worried that the
University would find out," Mary
Lou remembers. "But they don't
check you, really."
Problems like this are
commonplace for most unmarried

students living together. Finding a
place to live, maintaining separate
phones — in general, just keeping
up appearances for family, friends
and, above all, the University —
can become very difficult.
University Policy
"Official University policy is to
prohibit co-habitation," states
Larry Horton, assistant dean of
student affairs.
But, in almost the same breath,
he adds, "Of course, this is 1974.
I wouldn't be surprised to hear
that students are living together in
all sorts of places all over the
campus."
However, "official University
policy" can often make things
pretty sticky. Janet and Randy
have been living together in
Mirrielees for two years. Last year
Randy, a philosophy grad student,
drew into his apartment with a
male friend who planned to live
off campus. Janet lived in the
apartment and paid rent to the

friend, who then paid it to the
University.
This year, Randy planned to
graduate after winter quarter and
would not be permitted to stay in
University housing during the
spring. So his off-campus male
friend persuaded his roommate to
draw with him. They drew back
into Mirrielees and turned the
apartment over to Randy and
Janet for another year.
Technicalities
"It's really getting technical
now," Janet, a junior in political
science, says. "Two people who
aren't us supposedly live in this
room."
But the problems they've had
with the University are nothing
compared to their problems with
parents. "My parents know and
his don't," says Janet. "His
parents live a lot farther away so
it's easier to hide. They're solid
Protestants and he decided that
they might threaten to cut off

money if they found out."
So Randy decided to tell his
parents that he didn't have a
phone. "But they started insisting
that he get one," Janet recalls. "It
was getting down to a showdown
where they said 'get a phone' and
he wouldn't."
Now the couple has two
phones — both on the same table.
One is for Randy's parents — who
call about once a month — and
the other is for everyone else.
Dormitory Problems
Dormitories pose different
problems. Although the days of
bed checks and curfews are long
gone, some residence assistants
still object to open co-habitation.
"My R.A. didn't approve of
it,"says Jayne, who lives in a
freshman dorm. "He didn't allow
roommate switching all year and
he told us we shouldn't do it." In
spite of this, she and her
boyfriend Rick have moved in
together — and so have their old

roommates.
When the two of them would
spend the night, his roommate
would always leave the room.
"My boyfriend's roommate
needed a place to sleep so he
usually slept up in my room," she
remembers. "He and my
roommate were just friends
though — they didn't have sex."
'Still Just Friends'
Before spring quarter, their
dorm voted to make the corridors
coed — before there had been one
floor for boys and one for girls.
At that time Jayne and Rick
moved in together permanently —
and so did their roommates.
"They sleep together now but
they're still just friends," Jayne
says."I guess it's a pretty unusual
way for things to work out."
How do the other freshmen in
her dorm react to the situation?
"I'm in a really conservative
dorm, I think," Jayne says. "A lot
of people really frown upon this.
They don't come up and tell you
though — they just whisper.
For gay couples living together,
problems like phones and
roommates don't exist. "It's a lot
easier at this point in life being
gay," says Craig, a first year

medical student. "At this point
it's very natural I living with
someone of the same sex], but
once I assume a position of
financial responsibility, that's
when the time comes. Then it
becomes a little bit unusual or
questionable."
Many Problems
While students living together
have most of the problems of
married students — for example,
budgeting and division of
housework — they have few of the
advantages.
"My girlfriend can't get student
football tickets or student
basketball tickets whereas the
wife of a Stanford student could,"
says John, a junior in political
science. "We go to a football game
and I can buy a ticket and sit in
the student seats whereas Kim has
to sit in the reserved section.
"During spring break, she and I
went on the charter flight to
Hawaii. I was forced to lie and say
she was my wife and sign her
name as my name. Then we got
hassled at the airport," he
recounts.
He and Kim, a non-student,
also tried to apply for a joint
checking account but were turned

down because they weren't
married.

However, the advantages of
living together far outweigh the
problems for most couples.
Most couples cite "more

science. "We go to a football game
and I can buy a ticket and sit in
the student seats whereas Kim has
to sit in the reserved section.
"During spring break, she and I
went on the charter flight to
Hawaii. I was forced to lie and say
she was my wife and sign her
name as my name. Then we got
hassled at the airport," he
recounts.
He and Kim, a non-student,
also tried to apply for a joint
checking account but were turned

down because they weren't
married.
Advantages Outweigh Problems
However, the advantages of
living together far outweigh the
problems for most couples.
Most couples cite "more
freedom" as a reason for not
getting married. "Society tends to
define what a married relationship
should be, and we like the idea of
defining our own relationship,"
says John. "It's a lot easier for us
to have friends of the opposite sex
if we're not married."
For these couples, living
together seems to be the best of
all possible worlds, and they're
not anxious to change anything.
As Gwen says,"I kind of think
getting married would spoil the
relationship."
"My parents don't know that
Mike and I are living together,"
says Mary Lou, a University
employee living with a Stanford
graduate student. "My mother
wrote me and said, 'Never tell me
if you're going to live with
anyone,' so I took her at her
word.
"They don't even know that I
have a phone so I just call them
and say I'm at a pay phone."
Thinking a second, she adds,
"They're a bit dense since I'm not
putting any money in it or
anything."
Mary Lou and Mike live
together in Escondido Village — a
University apartment complex for
married students only. "At first
we were worried that the
University would find out," Mary
Lou remembers. "But they don't
check you, really."
Problems like this are
commonplace for most unmarried

students living together. Finding a
place to live, maintaining separate
phones — in general, just keeping
up appearances for family, friends
and, above all, the University —
can become very difficult.
University Policy
"Official University policy is to
prohibit co-habitation," states
Larry Horton, assistant dean of
student affairs.
But, in almost the same breath,
he adds, "Of course, this is 1974.
I wouldn't be surprised to hear
that students are living together in
all sorts of places all over the
campus."
However, "official University
policy" can often make things
pretty sticky. Janet and Randy
have been living together in
Mirrielees for two years. Last year
Randy, a philosophy grad student,
drew into his apartment with a
male friend who planned to live
off campus. Janet lived in the
apartment and paid rent to the

friend, who then paid it to the
University.
This year, Randy planned to
graduate after winter quarter and
would not be permitted to stay in
University housing during the
spring. So his off-campus male
friend persuaded his roommate to
draw with him. They drew back
into Mirrielees and turned the
apartment over to Randy and
Janet for another year.
Technicalities
"It's really getting technical
now," Janet, a junior in political
science, says. "Two people who
aren't us supposedly live in this
room."
But the problems they've had
with the University are nothing
compared to their problems with
parents. "My parents know and
his don't," says Janet. "His
parents live a lot farther away so
it's easier to hide. They're solid
Protestants and he decided that
they might threaten to cut off

money if they found out."
So Randy decided to tell his
parents that he didn't have a
phone. "But they started insisting
that he get one," Janet recalls. "It
was getting down to a showdown
where they said 'get a phone' and
he wouldn't."
Now the couple has two
phones — both on the same table.
One is for Randy's parents — who
call about once a month — and
the other is for everyone else.
Dormitory Problems
Dormitories pose different
problems. Although the days of
bed checks and curfews are long
gone, some residence assistants
still object to open co-habitation.
"My R.A. didn't approve of
it,"says Jayne, who lives in a
freshman dorm. "He didn't allow
roommate switching all year and
he told us we shouldn't do it." In
spite of this, she and her
boyfriend Rick have moved in
together — and so have their old

roommates.
When the two of them would
spend the night, his roommate
would always leave the room.
"My boyfriend's roommate
needed a place to sleep so he
usually slept up in my room," she
remembers. "He and my
roommate were just friends
though — they didn't have sex."
'Still Just Friends'
Before spring quarter, their
dorm voted to make the corridors
coed — before there had been one
floor for boys and one for girls.
At that time Jayne and Rick
moved in together permanently —
and so did their roommates.
"They sleep together now but
they're still just friends," Jayne
says."I guess it's a pretty unusual
way for things to work out."
How do the other freshmen in
her dorm react to the situation?
"I'm in a really conservative
dorm, I think," Jayne says. "A lot
of people really frown upon this.
They don't come up and tell you
though — they just whisper.
For gay couples living together,
problems like phones and
roommates don't exist. "It's a lot
easier at this point in life being
gay," says Craig, a first year

medical student. "At this point
it's very natural I living with
someone of the same sex], but
once I assume a position of
financial responsibility, that's
when the time comes. Then it
becomes a little bit unusual or
questionable."
Many Problems
While students living together
have most of the problems of
married students — for example,
budgeting and division of
housework — they have few of the
advantages.
"My girlfriend can't get student
football tickets or student
basketball tickets whereas the
wife of a Stanford student could,"
says John, a junior in political
science. "We go to a football game
and I can buy a ticket and sit in
the student seats whereas Kim has
to sit in the reserved section.
"During spring break, she and I
went on the charter flight to
Hawaii. I was forced to lie and say
