# University Committees: Power, Failings
## 
### TIM FERGUSON A Daily Investigative Team 
"You can't hold a committee responsible
for a decision," says Assoc. Dean of Student
. iffairs Dan Williams.
But the Stanford administration, faculty
and Board of Trustees hold these groups
responsible for something, and usually it's
called "input." Together they've set up 48
different committees that contain student
members, and such groups are virtually the
only means a student has of "inputting" into
vhe decisions that shape his university.
Three major types of committees exist
here: those impaneled by the University
president, usually under the eye of an
ex-officio member who is a part of the
administration; those of the Academic
Council, governing body of the faculty (these
contain a minority of student members
and a majority from the Council); and those
of the trustees, whose minutes and
deliberations are confidential.
Just what are these committees
accomplishing, and how effective are the
students who serve on them? To find out, the
Daily has conducted an in-depth investigation
of seven committees it believes representative
of the system. No trustee committee is
included; their records are not open to the
press.
Points explored in this investigation
include the amount — and quality — of
student and faculty input; student and faculty
interest, as reflected in attendance records;
the question of possible dominance of a
committee by the official it is intended to
advise; committee harmony and conflicts;
and, finally, the accountability of committee
members to those they represent.
The investigation has revealed that
although participation on committees has
often been inadequate, some committees
stand as monuments to how change in the
University can be achieved by "going through
channels."
C-UAFA: Power Unused
Though most University committees are
admittedly only advisory bodies to an
administrator in their area, the charge of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (C-UAFA) empowers this group
to make certain "determinations."
Among these are the content of application
forms, the number of students to be admitted,
requirements for admission (and exceptions to
these), standards for establishing priority for
financial aid and the types of aid available.
Despite being blessed with such unusual
power, committee members apparently are
not taking advantage of their position. The
reason, in the words of student member
Michael Jennings, is that "[Dean of
Admissions Fred] Hargadon seems to run
things." Committee chairman Paul Green,
professor of biological sciences, said,
"Hargadon influences the committee most.
He's more informed."
Assoc. Physics Prof. Alexander Fetter
agreed that Hargadon "is generally persuasive.
The commiuoe seems to agree with
Hargadon."
Quinn Mayer, student member and now
ASSU vice president, stated, "The committee
is an advisory panel to Dean Hargadon."
Praise for both Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff was nearly
unanimous among C-UAFA members. Some
didn't feel Hargadon's domination of meetings
was detrimental.
"Dean Hargadon will accept a student's
opinion if it is intelligent enough," said
student member Carmen Logan.
Huff said although C-UAFA members "are
not, in effect, running the office . . . they
determine what type of students should be at
Stanford and make sure they can come here
once accepted. We have to follow their
recommendations."
In Mayer's words, Hargadon "is the one
who has access to all the materials and
relevant data."
"I'm expected to know more about
admissions," said Hargadon, pointing out that
committees are only extra-curricular duties
for their members. "Should something go
wrong at an operational level, it's my
responsibility. You don't fire teachers or
expel students for a mistake they make on a
committee."
Some C-UAFA members are unable to
contribute significantly because they lack
expertise. "Those with tenure seem to know a
lot more," said Logan. "There's a definite
disadvantage of students having only
one-year terms." (Mayer is the only
two-termer.)
Meetings often plod along on a fixed
course. "The committee could be more
effective if . . . it didn't stick to such a rigid
agenda," said Logan.
"There is some frustration when things
move slowly and things don't get discussed,"
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel said.
In trying to counter this, Mayer has
found that "we [students J got much more
done when we met with Hargadon
separately."
Official meetings are infrequent. C-UAFA's
charge requires six meetings per year, and the
committee met only that many times.
Huff and Mayer both called for more
meetings. Fetter said, however, that he would
be "much less willing to serve on the
committee if it met too often. 1 have other
obligations within my department."
According to Siegel, "the chairman
[Green j is reluctant to overwork people."
SWOPSI: United Battle
While C-UAFA tends to rely on Hargadon
in deference to his position, the members of
the SWOPSI Policy Board are supportive of
program director Dan Lewis for a d.ifferent
reason: SWOPSI's continuing fight ? for
autonomy.
Student member Chris Elms called Lewis
"clearly the dominant force on the Board."
Faculty members respect Lewis, Elms said,
because he knows a lot about the program's
courses, and students respect him because
they know he has fought for the program for
years. (Lewis has been director since
SWOPSI's inception in 1969, but is resigning
this August.)

Although faculty members contribute far
more than the students, Elms attributed that
to agreement, not intimidation.
Elms, student chairperson Chris Baron and
another student complimented the faculty
members 011 their assistance to students, and
recognized the need for it. Said Elms, "If this
were I only] a student committee, it wouldn't
mean a thing. Students in this university don't
have a clout."
Baron noted that faculty members are
helpful in contributing a realistic view of how
much can be taught in one quarter when the
Board is discussing courses.
Academic standards for courses are the
only significant area of disagreement on this
otherwise united committee. A few members,
such as Elms, feel the Board "worries
sometimes too much whether something has
'sufficient academic rigor,' " thus discouraging
students from teaching courses. But pressure
from the administration has led to tightened
criteria.

Although the Board's main job is approving
courses, it has spent much of its time haggling
with Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs over funds and policies.
Elms expressed concern over what he saw
as the dean's apparent tendency to regard
SWOPSI- as a "proving-ground" for
departmental courses. English Prof. William
Chace, another Board member, said the
program is just "too anarchistic, too sloppy,
too unruly" for Gibbs.
Gibbs has proposed merging SWOPSI with
the Undergraduate Specials program, a
proposal the Board has fought vehemently.
In addition, the dean informed the Board
April 30 that SWOPSI funding for next year
was in question because his reserve funds,
traditionally used for the program, had dried
up. As an economy move, Gibbs also
proposed that full-time staffer Merlyn Payne's
job be reduced to four hours per day; the
Board has opposed this move as well.
Some members have begun to doubt the
Board's effectiveness in the long run and
many have viewed their role in accordance
with Lewis' motto — "Dare to struggle, dare
to stalemate."
Public Events: Yes Men?
The Committee on Public Events appears
to suffer, too, from a dependency on the
administrator whom it oversees. Of 11
committee members the four students and
four faculty do appear to contribute equally
and substantially, but the whole committee's
role in bringing public events to campus is
limited.
According to the 1971 public events policy
manual, the committee "govern[sj all
non-academic, non-athletic programs which
are held ... on University property and which
are open to the public or to all students. . ."
Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti said
the specifics of these performances are carried
out mainly by his office. The primary duty 0/
the committee, he said, is "policy setting not
programming."
Student member 800 Bacon said of the
committee, "It does fulfill public events that a
lot of students are concerned about, but
authority is vested in Tom Bacchetti. He is
capable but his taste can't possibly reflect the
whole Stanford community."
"The committee is just a rubber stamp
committee — it doesn't do much," said
student member Mary Lou Johnson.
A review of the committee minutes shows
that recent business consisted mostly of
reports by Bacchetti.
"We run this institution on an advocacy
system," said Bacchetti. "If somebody can
make a case I'm more than receptive and if
I'm persuaded I'll do it, but we're not going to
overreact to some ideas which aren't fully
realized yet."
"We only appeal to one segment of the
community," said Bacon. "Bacchetti is open
but he's going to go ahead and do what he'll
do unless you can make it [a proposal] seem
solid."
Bacchetti admits that most of the
programming done by his office "tends to be
somewhat conservative ... they are usually
things which complement academic
programming."
Student member Mason Blacher said, "I've
lobbied for University support for
student-initiated theater and drama for one
and a half >ears."
Education Prof. Robert Textor said he too
pushed for mixed offerings.
Blacher blames financial hangups rather
than Bacchetti for the Public Events failings.
"The University recognizes him when he
brings quartets and outside talents rather than
when he helps ... University groups."
Bacon points out that it is the
responsibility of students on the committee
"to have some commitment." He said
students on the committee should frequently
poll the student body, "something we haven't
done."
One student member who did consider
himself effective was ASSU Special Events
Director Dan Scher.
Scher said he was "instrumental" in
scheduling several jazz concerts on campus
next year.

Bacon said he tried to establish a Black
Cultural program next year but Bacchetti said
Bacon's proposals were not all accepted
"because of our financial responsibility to the
University."
C-15: A Virtual Standoff
An unusual milieu of intra-committee
non-cooperation has developed in the
Committee of 15 (C-15), the
faculty-student-administration panel to revise
the student judicial system.
According to two student members,
backlash among faculty members against the
defeat of the C-15 proposal last October has
resulted in a standoff between two sides of
the group.
"They [faculty] felt generous over the
October proposal," said student member
Philip Whistler. The faculty didn't want to
drag along work on a proposal for the entire
year, Whistler said.
The October proposal was overwhelmingly

defeated by students after some key student
members of the C-15 opposed it, claiming that
student judicial rights were not guaranteed.
Whistler said, "There was a standoff in last
year's [October] scheme." He said both sides
had made significant compromises in order to
reach an agreement, and submitted the
proposal because they "thought it was the
best we could get" under the prevailing
circumstances.
The major problem with the C-15 this year
was "too little time to formulate new
proposals" after the October defeat, according
to student member David Herst. Only two
C-15 meetings were held this year.
Student members of the C-15 recently have
proposed a new judicial plan which would
establish a faculty "buffer zone" in judicial
proceedings between students and the
administration.
Under the plan, an all-student panel would
make judicial recommendations to the dean of
students. If he disagreed with them, a separate
faculty board would take up the matter. Its
decision would have to be approved by the
University president.
Herst noted some urgency in the proposal.
He said the present Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) is not a big issue anymore, and"the
ionger you wait [in proposing a new system]
the more legitimate the CJP becomes."
"The judicial system as it now stands is fair
and very efficient and I see no pressure for
change," Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a former
C-15 member, told the Daily April 9.
Business Prof. Harold Leavitt, however,
said in the same issue that "what is really
needed is for students to put forward new
proposals because the faculty and
administration probably won't put forward
anything new." Leavitt is returning to the
C-15 next year.
Whistler felt that extended terms for
student members of C-15 were not necessary.
"It is a good idea to get new people involved
because the older members can get into
terrible ruts," he said.
Faculty Quiet On COSS
A similar schism, though well below the
surface and not manifesting itself publicly,
may affect the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS).
COSS is charged by the University
president to look into areas of student life,

including residences and campus
organizations.
Most agree that faculty input on COSS has
been limited, primarily because the issues the
committee confronts are of little interest to
faculty members. One of three on the
eight-person committee, Asst. Chemistry Prof.
Hans C. Andersen, says, "For the kinds of
things we talked about this year, I can't see
how it [faculty input] was useful."
Other ills afflict COSS, the only University
committee with a student chairman and
student majority. Chairman Bill Rifkin says of
the committee's charge, which requires at
least two meetings per quarter, "We haven't
been living up to it at all."
Now meeting more regularly, COSS has
been involved in revision of the housing draw,
formulation of a report on the need for new

undergraduate housing and establishment of
provisions for selection of residence staffs,
according to Rifkin.
Dealings between the housing office and
COSS bring to light another major drawback
of the committee: adequate representation of
students. Rifkin says "blame was put in the
wrong place" when some students voiced
objections to the transfer of the black theme
house from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia in April.
Rifkin and Andersen agree that the reputed
lack of student input prior to the decision was
the fault of the committee, not Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton. "The
problem isn't between the housing office and
the committee," Rifkin says, "but between
the committee and the student body."
"Five students aren't representative of the
entire student body," Rifkin says. "We have
been blinded to certain issues." Among them
are those involving minorities: COSS' students
are all white.
The main problem with COSS, however,
remains its faculty input. "I haven't been
entirely happy with it,"says chairman Rifkin.
He hastens to add that faculty members on
COSS haven't been uncooperative, but that
schedule conflicts allow them "limited
availability."
These conflicts include simultaneous
P'aculty Senate meetings for two members and
frequent out-of-town trips by the third,
Electrical Engineering Prof. O.G. Villard, who
attended his first meeting May 1.
Another hindrance is the alienation some
faculty members feel toward the business of
COSS. "I found myself not saying too much,"
says Andersen. "Most of the topics seemed
primarily of concern to students."
Andersen is not sure more faculty input is
desirable. Given the nature of COSS, "it's not
obvious you'd want to" increase such input,
he says. "There's no reason to solicit more
faculty input for the issues we had this year."
CEEW: A Woman's Year
"This was the year of the woman student
here," according to senior Barbara Brown,
student member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
The committee's charter states that its
duties include the "improvement of
educational and occupational opportunities"
here and the development of "avenues for
increasing [the number of) women faculty
members."
CEEW succeeded in getting the student
affairs office to establish a "women's
advocate" and persuading the provost's office
to fund a study on the education of women at
Stanford, to be completed next year.
Still, said Brown, "we could have done a
lot more." Problems with the committee
chairmanship marred CEEW's year.
The committee did show several strengths,
according to its members. "We were a
cohesive group this year," said Brown. Most
members of CEEW are women activists, and
disputes concerning goals were rare.
CEEW avoids a problem of other
committees: disinterested members. Graduate
student Barbara Glenn noted this problem,
saying many faculty members "are often
reluctant to serve on a committee." But, she
added, "we had a bunch this year who were
intensely interested in the issues."
Student members, however, have been"the
guiding force of the committee," according to
Amy Metcalfe, assistant to the provost. Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams agreed:
"The women students played as great, or an
even greater role, than the other members."
CEEW lacked a strong leader for much of
the year. "We would often meet and throw
out ideas, but you really need someone to
sum things up, narrow the focus so you can
begin to act on an issue," said Brown.
Metcalfe, who served as acting chairwoman
for the first two quarters, said, "We fell apart
after winter quarter this year." She blamed
the demise on "poor planning in changing the
chairmanship in the middle of the year."
Asst. English Prof. Diane Middlebrook was
appointed to a two-year term as chairwoman in
the fall of last year. She was on leave,
however, until this April, and has not yet
become active in CEEW. The committee met
only once this quarter.
Middlebrook said she was appointed to
CEEW "against my better judgment. I accept
working on committees as part of my job at
Stanford." She thought the committee ran

smoothly this year because "the personalities
were harmonious and cooperative," but sees a
"complete turnover in membership next year"
when she will begin her first year as an active
chairwoman.
Former ASSU Vice President and member
Beth Garfield disagreed with the concept of
committees most widely held in the
University, that of an adviser. She saw the
committee's proper role as "putting pressure
on the appropriate decision-maker."
Garfield wants to change the committee's
focus next year. "Probably too much
emphasis was placed on the students' position
this year," she said. "We really need to take
up staff issues next year."
Metcalfe, however, didn't share Garfield's
concern.
Thus CEEW may be faced with its first

intra-committee dispute which would disturb
the present homogeneity of membership.
CUS: Inhibited Students
Charged by the Academic Council to
formulate "policies governing the structure of
the undergraduate curriculum," changes in
degree programs and the academic advising
system, the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has been quite active, according
to many of its members. Some student
delegates to CUS, however, apparently have
remained dormant.
CUS' accomplishments for 1973-74 are
apparently many, though few are tangible. Its
central problem rests with student
involvement: only three of its 10 members,
CUS' charge dictates, may be undergraduate
students. The remainder are from the
Academic Council, and the resulting
dominance prompted one of the student
members, Betty Muth, to comment, "I always
had the feeling I wasn't being taken seriously
by some faculty on the committee."
An inspection of the minutes of CUS' first
14 meetings this year indicates a dominance
of contributions by faculty members. It
reveals a startling fact: except for an exchange
on the policies of the ASSU Nominations
Committee at CUS' first meeting, student
member and now-ASSU President Mike
Herman had not made a single recorded
contribution to CUS meetings until the one of
May 8.
"[Herman| is not a frequent contributor,"
says Dean of Undergra'duate Studies James
Gibbs, an ex-officio member of CUS. But,
Gibbs says, "when Herman does
[contribute], it's something valuable."
CUS Chairman Richard A. Brody, assistant
professor of political science, agreed with
Gibbs. "Herman is a solid guy. He doesn't say
much but when he does it's something good."
"Word for jvord, I myself don't contribute
as much as some members," Herman admits.
But, he says, "my contribution has been as
great as the other students' [Betty Muth and
Tom Wattles]
Muth disagrees, "I don't think either one
of the guys contributes very much. There's
many meetings where he [Herman] doesn't
say anything."
Herman attributes his lack of mention in
CUS minutes to a subconscious bias in favor
of faculty members on the part of committee
secretary Alice Supton. He said he found
"most upsetting" the dearth of student
comments in the minutes.
Supton admits, "It might be that
unconsciously I didn't pay attention to
students." However, she insists her minutes
"pretty much do" reflect the relative
contributions. "I just found that Mike didn't
say as much."
Imagined or not, Herman's
non-contribution reflects a major concern of
CUS: the amount and worth of student input.
"It's variable," Gibbs says of student input.
"There are some issues students are not
interested in."
"The students are pretty general
contributors ... an important part of the
system," says chairman Brody.
Muth paints a less rosy picture. "The
problem is that faculty are reluctant to
change. They use the committee as an
instrument to define what we already have."
"The main problem [for students] is
continuity," says Gibbs. It takes one quarter
for them to learn how it [committee]
operates."
Muth strongly agrees: "Student
appointments [now one year] should be
longer," she says. "This year I've just gotten a
taste."
Investigation Summary
These seven committees can be taken to
represent the committee system in
microcosm. From their cases, a number of
problems stand out:
—Some faculty serve on committees only
as part of what they consider an "unwritten
obligation." Others serve by their own
request, and seem to become more involved
(as on CEEW) rather than disinterested (as on
COSS).
—Faculty attendance is often spotty. When
Faculty Senate members serve on committees
as well, schedule conflicts often arise. And
faculty members often find it difficult to
attach the same importance to committee
memberships that they do to their classes.
—Student views are sometimes given short
shrift. On CUS, for example, student members
perceive that their contributions are valued
less than those of faculty members. On
CEEW, on the other hand, faculty members'
active interest in student views — and greater
initiative and effort on the part of student
members — have proved effective.
—Committees intended as policy-setting
groups often defer to the "superior
knowledge" of the administrators they are
supposed to oversee. As a result, committees
often act solely on administrators'
recommendations — instead of undertaking
more independent deliberations.
—Faculty are currently given three-year
terms, while students are generally limited to
one year. In committees of a continuing
nature, such as C-US and C-UAFA, this
limitation hampers student input.
—While the ASSU currently requires
student committee members to file reports of
their performance, the Academic Council does
not request such reports. The
"accountability" of all committee members is
unclear.
—Committee meetings are not open to
effective press coverage. Confidentiality is
important to some committees (such as C-15),
but student and faculty skepticism of secret
deliberations may hamper input. Greater
monitoring and publicity might help both
student and faculty members to be more
effective.
Next year, the ASSU Council of Presidents
plans to assign a student staff assistant to each
committee's student members. ASSU
President Mike Herman says "better liaison
between student government and students on
committees" will result from the posts.

Public Events: Yes Men?
The Committee on Public Events appears
to suffer, too, from a dependency on the
administrator whom it oversees. Of 11
committee members the four students and
four faculty do appear to contribute equally
and substantially, but the whole committee's
role in bringing public events to campus is
limited.
According to the 1971 public events policy
manual, the committee "govern[sj all
non-academic, non-athletic programs which
are held ... on University property and which
are open to the public or to all students. . ."
Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti said
the specifics of these performances are carried
out mainly by his office. The primary duty 0/
the committee, he said, is "policy setting not
programming."
Student member 800 Bacon said of the
committee, "It does fulfill public events that a
lot of students are concerned about, but
authority is vested in Tom Bacchetti. He is
capable but his taste can't possibly reflect the
whole Stanford community."
"The committee is just a rubber stamp
committee — it doesn't do much," said
student member Mary Lou Johnson.
A review of the committee minutes shows
that recent business consisted mostly of
reports by Bacchetti.
"We run this institution on an advocacy
system," said Bacchetti. "If somebody can
make a case I'm more than receptive and if
I'm persuaded I'll do it, but we're not going to
overreact to some ideas which aren't fully
realized yet."
"We only appeal to one segment of the
community," said Bacon. "Bacchetti is open
but he's going to go ahead and do what he'll
do unless you can make it [a proposal] seem
solid."
Bacchetti admits that most of the
programming done by his office "tends to be
somewhat conservative ... they are usually
things which complement academic
programming."
Student member Mason Blacher said, "I've
lobbied for University support for
student-initiated theater and drama for one
and a half >ears."
Education Prof. Robert Textor said he too
pushed for mixed offerings.
Blacher blames financial hangups rather
than Bacchetti for the Public Events failings.
"The University recognizes him when he
brings quartets and outside talents rather than
when he helps ... University groups."
Bacon points out that it is the
responsibility of students on the committee
"to have some commitment." He said
students on the committee should frequently
poll the student body, "something we haven't
done."
One student member who did consider
himself effective was ASSU Special Events
Director Dan Scher.
Scher said he was "instrumental" in
scheduling several jazz concerts on campus
next year.

Bacon said he tried to establish a Black
Cultural program next year but Bacchetti said
Bacon's proposals were not all accepted
"because of our financial responsibility to the
University."
C-15: A Virtual Standoff
An unusual milieu of intra-committee
non-cooperation has developed in the
Committee of 15 (C-15), the
faculty-student-administration panel to revise
the student judicial system.
According to two student members,
backlash among faculty members against the
defeat of the C-15 proposal last October has
resulted in a standoff between two sides of
the group.
"They [faculty] felt generous over the
October proposal," said student member
Philip Whistler. The faculty didn't want to
drag along work on a proposal for the entire
year, Whistler said.
The October proposal was overwhelmingly

defeated by students after some key student
members of the C-15 opposed it, claiming that
student judicial rights were not guaranteed.
Whistler said, "There was a standoff in last
year's [October] scheme." He said both sides
had made significant compromises in order to
reach an agreement, and submitted the
proposal because they "thought it was the
best we could get" under the prevailing
circumstances.
The major problem with the C-15 this year
was "too little time to formulate new
proposals" after the October defeat, according
to student member David Herst. Only two
C-15 meetings were held this year.
Student members of the C-15 recently have
proposed a new judicial plan which would
establish a faculty "buffer zone" in judicial
proceedings between students and the
administration.
Under the plan, an all-student panel would
make judicial recommendations to the dean of
students. If he disagreed with them, a separate
faculty board would take up the matter. Its
decision would have to be approved by the
University president.
Herst noted some urgency in the proposal.
He said the present Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) is not a big issue anymore, and"the
ionger you wait [in proposing a new system]
the more legitimate the CJP becomes."
"The judicial system as it now stands is fair
and very efficient and I see no pressure for
change," Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a former
C-15 member, told the Daily April 9.
Business Prof. Harold Leavitt, however,
said in the same issue that "what is really
needed is for students to put forward new
proposals because the faculty and
administration probably won't put forward
anything new." Leavitt is returning to the
C-15 next year.
Whistler felt that extended terms for
student members of C-15 were not necessary.
"It is a good idea to get new people involved
because the older members can get into
terrible ruts," he said.
Faculty Quiet On COSS
A similar schism, though well below the
surface and not manifesting itself publicly,
may affect the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS).
COSS is charged by the University
president to look into areas of student life,

including residences and campus
organizations.
Most agree that faculty input on COSS has
been limited, primarily because the issues the
committee confronts are of little interest to
faculty members. One of three on the
eight-person committee, Asst. Chemistry Prof.
Hans C. Andersen, says, "For the kinds of
things we talked about this year, I can't see
how it [faculty input] was useful."
Other ills afflict COSS, the only University
committee with a student chairman and
student majority. Chairman Bill Rifkin says of
the committee's charge, which requires at
least two meetings per quarter, "We haven't
been living up to it at all."
Now meeting more regularly, COSS has
been involved in revision of the housing draw,
formulation of a report on the need for new

undergraduate housing and establishment of
provisions for selection of residence staffs,
according to Rifkin.
Dealings between the housing office and
COSS bring to light another major drawback
of the committee: adequate representation of
students. Rifkin says "blame was put in the
wrong place" when some students voiced
objections to the transfer of the black theme
house from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia in April.
Rifkin and Andersen agree that the reputed
lack of student input prior to the decision was
the fault of the committee, not Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton. "The
problem isn't between the housing office and
the committee," Rifkin says, "but between
the committee and the student body."
"Five students aren't representative of the
entire student body," Rifkin says. "We have
been blinded to certain issues." Among them
are those involving minorities: COSS' students
are all white.
The main problem with COSS, however,
remains its faculty input. "I haven't been
entirely happy with it,"says chairman Rifkin.
He hastens to add that faculty members on
COSS haven't been uncooperative, but that
schedule conflicts allow them "limited
availability."
These conflicts include simultaneous
P'aculty Senate meetings for two members and
frequent out-of-town trips by the third,
Electrical Engineering Prof. O.G. Villard, who
attended his first meeting May 1.
Another hindrance is the alienation some
faculty members feel toward the business of
COSS. "I found myself not saying too much,"
says Andersen. "Most of the topics seemed
primarily of concern to students."
Andersen is not sure more faculty input is
desirable. Given the nature of COSS, "it's not
obvious you'd want to" increase such input,
he says. "There's no reason to solicit more
faculty input for the issues we had this year."
CEEW: A Woman's Year
"This was the year of the woman student
here," according to senior Barbara Brown,
student member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
The committee's charter states that its
duties include the "improvement of
educational and occupational opportunities"
here and the development of "avenues for
increasing [the number of) women faculty
members."
CEEW succeeded in getting the student
affairs office to establish a "women's
advocate" and persuading the provost's office
to fund a study on the education of women at
Stanford, to be completed next year.
Still, said Brown, "we could have done a
lot more." Problems with the committee
chairmanship marred CEEW's year.
The committee did show several strengths,
according to its members. "We were a
cohesive group this year," said Brown. Most
members of CEEW are women activists, and
disputes concerning goals were rare.
CEEW avoids a problem of other
committees: disinterested members. Graduate
student Barbara Glenn noted this problem,
saying many faculty members "are often
reluctant to serve on a committee." But, she
added, "we had a bunch this year who were
intensely interested in the issues."
Student members, however, have been"the
guiding force of the committee," according to
Amy Metcalfe, assistant to the provost. Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams agreed:
"The women students played as great, or an
even greater role, than the other members."
CEEW lacked a strong leader for much of
the year. "We would often meet and throw
out ideas, but you really need someone to
sum things up, narrow the focus so you can
begin to act on an issue," said Brown.
Metcalfe, who served as acting chairwoman
for the first two quarters, said, "We fell apart
after winter quarter this year." She blamed
the demise on "poor planning in changing the
chairmanship in the middle of the year."
Asst. English Prof. Diane Middlebrook was
appointed to a two-year term as chairwoman in
the fall of last year. She was on leave,
however, until this April, and has not yet
become active in CEEW. The committee met
only once this quarter.
Middlebrook said she was appointed to
CEEW "against my better judgment. I accept
working on committees as part of my job at
Stanford." She thought the committee ran

smoothly this year because "the personalities
were harmonious and cooperative," but sees a
"complete turnover in membership next year"
when she will begin her first year as an active
chairwoman.
Former ASSU Vice President and member
Beth Garfield disagreed with the concept of
committees most widely held in the
University, that of an adviser. She saw the
committee's proper role as "putting pressure
on the appropriate decision-maker."
Garfield wants to change the committee's
focus next year. "Probably too much
emphasis was placed on the students' position
this year," she said. "We really need to take
up staff issues next year."
Metcalfe, however, didn't share Garfield's
concern.
Thus CEEW may be faced with its first

intra-committee dispute which would disturb
the present homogeneity of membership.
CUS: Inhibited Students
Charged by the Academic Council to
formulate "policies governing the structure of
the undergraduate curriculum," changes in
degree programs and the academic advising
system, the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has been quite active, according
to many of its members. Some student
delegates to CUS, however, apparently have
remained dormant.
CUS' accomplishments for 1973-74 are
apparently many, though few are tangible. Its
central problem rests with student
involvement: only three of its 10 members,
CUS' charge dictates, may be undergraduate
students. The remainder are from the
Academic Council, and the resulting
dominance prompted one of the student
members, Betty Muth, to comment, "I always
had the feeling I wasn't being taken seriously
by some faculty on the committee."
An inspection of the minutes of CUS' first
14 meetings this year indicates a dominance
of contributions by faculty members. It
reveals a startling fact: except for an exchange
on the policies of the ASSU Nominations
Committee at CUS' first meeting, student
member and now-ASSU President Mike
Herman had not made a single recorded
contribution to CUS meetings until the one of
May 8.
"[Herman| is not a frequent contributor,"
says Dean of Undergra'duate Studies James
Gibbs, an ex-officio member of CUS. But,
Gibbs says, "when Herman does
[contribute], it's something valuable."
CUS Chairman Richard A. Brody, assistant
professor of political science, agreed with
Gibbs. "Herman is a solid guy. He doesn't say
much but when he does it's something good."
"Word for jvord, I myself don't contribute
as much as some members," Herman admits.
But, he says, "my contribution has been as
great as the other students' [Betty Muth and
Tom Wattles]
Muth disagrees, "I don't think either one
of the guys contributes very much. There's
many meetings where he [Herman] doesn't
say anything."
Herman attributes his lack of mention in
CUS minutes to a subconscious bias in favor
of faculty members on the part of committee
secretary Alice Supton. He said he found
"most upsetting" the dearth of student
comments in the minutes.
Supton admits, "It might be that
unconsciously I didn't pay attention to
students." However, she insists her minutes
"pretty much do" reflect the relative
contributions. "I just found that Mike didn't
say as much."
Imagined or not, Herman's
non-contribution reflects a major concern of
CUS: the amount and worth of student input.
"It's variable," Gibbs says of student input.
"There are some issues students are not
interested in."
"The students are pretty general
contributors ... an important part of the
system," says chairman Brody.
Muth paints a less rosy picture. "The
problem is that faculty are reluctant to
change. They use the committee as an
instrument to define what we already have."
"The main problem [for students] is
continuity," says Gibbs. It takes one quarter
for them to learn how it [committee]
operates."
Muth strongly agrees: "Student
appointments [now one year] should be
longer," she says. "This year I've just gotten a
taste."
Investigation Summary
These seven committees can be taken to
represent the committee system in
microcosm. From their cases, a number of
problems stand out:
—Some faculty serve on committees only
as part of what they consider an "unwritten
obligation." Others serve by their own
request, and seem to become more involved
(as on CEEW) rather than disinterested (as on
COSS).
—Faculty attendance is often spotty. When
Faculty Senate members serve on committees
as well, schedule conflicts often arise. And
faculty members often find it difficult to
attach the same importance to committee
memberships that they do to their classes.
—Student views are sometimes given short
shrift. On CUS, for example, student members
perceive that their contributions are valued
less than those of faculty members. On
CEEW, on the other hand, faculty members'
active interest in student views — and greater
initiative and effort on the part of student
members — have proved effective.
—Committees intended as policy-setting
groups often defer to the "superior
knowledge" of the administrators they are
supposed to oversee. As a result, committees
often act solely on administrators'
recommendations — instead of undertaking
more independent deliberations.
—Faculty are currently given three-year
terms, while students are generally limited to
one year. In committees of a continuing
nature, such as C-US and C-UAFA, this
limitation hampers student input.
—While the ASSU currently requires
student committee members to file reports of
their performance, the Academic Council does
not request such reports. The
"accountability" of all committee members is
unclear.
—Committee meetings are not open to
effective press coverage. Confidentiality is
important to some committees (such as C-15),
but student and faculty skepticism of secret
deliberations may hamper input. Greater
monitoring and publicity might help both
student and faculty members to be more
effective.
Next year, the ASSU Council of Presidents
plans to assign a student staff assistant to each
committee's student members. ASSU
President Mike Herman says "better liaison
between student government and students on
committees" will result from the posts.

MASON BLACHER BARBARA BROWN MIKE HERMAN
A year for financial hangups, a women's advocate and "upsetting" minutes.
"You can't hold a committee responsible
for a decision," says Assoc. Dean of Student
. iffairs Dan Williams.
But the Stanford administration, faculty
and Board of Trustees hold these groups
responsible for something, and usually it's
called "input." Together they've set up 48
different committees that contain student
members, and such groups are virtually the
only means a student has of "inputting" into
vhe decisions that shape his university.
Three major types of committees exist
here: those impaneled by the University
president, usually under the eye of an
ex-officio member who is a part of the
administration; those of the Academic
Council, governing body of the faculty (these
contain a minority of student members
and a majority from the Council); and those
of the trustees, whose minutes and
deliberations are confidential.
Just what are these committees
accomplishing, and how effective are the
students who serve on them? To find out, the
Daily has conducted an in-depth investigation
of seven committees it believes representative
of the system. No trustee committee is
included; their records are not open to the
press.
Points explored in this investigation
include the amount — and quality — of
student and faculty input; student and faculty
interest, as reflected in attendance records;
the question of possible dominance of a
committee by the official it is intended to
advise; committee harmony and conflicts;
and, finally, the accountability of committee
members to those they represent.
The investigation has revealed that
although participation on committees has
often been inadequate, some committees
stand as monuments to how change in the
University can be achieved by "going through
channels."
C-UAFA: Power Unused
Though most University committees are
admittedly only advisory bodies to an
administrator in their area, the charge of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (C-UAFA) empowers this group
to make certain "determinations."
Among these are the content of application
forms, the number of students to be admitted,
requirements for admission (and exceptions to
these), standards for establishing priority for
financial aid and the types of aid available.
Despite being blessed with such unusual
power, committee members apparently are
not taking advantage of their position. The
reason, in the words of student member
Michael Jennings, is that "[Dean of
Admissions Fred] Hargadon seems to run
things." Committee chairman Paul Green,
professor of biological sciences, said,
"Hargadon influences the committee most.
He's more informed."
Assoc. Physics Prof. Alexander Fetter
agreed that Hargadon "is generally persuasive.
The commiuoe seems to agree with
Hargadon."
Quinn Mayer, student member and now
ASSU vice president, stated, "The committee
is an advisory panel to Dean Hargadon."
Praise for both Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff was nearly
unanimous among C-UAFA members. Some
didn't feel Hargadon's domination of meetings
was detrimental.
"Dean Hargadon will accept a student's
opinion if it is intelligent enough," said
student member Carmen Logan.
Huff said although C-UAFA members "are
not, in effect, running the office . . . they
determine what type of students should be at
Stanford and make sure they can come here
once accepted. We have to follow their
recommendations."
In Mayer's words, Hargadon "is the one
who has access to all the materials and
relevant data."
"I'm expected to know more about
admissions," said Hargadon, pointing out that
committees are only extra-curricular duties
for their members. "Should something go
wrong at an operational level, it's my
responsibility. You don't fire teachers or
expel students for a mistake they make on a
committee."
Some C-UAFA members are unable to
contribute significantly because they lack
expertise. "Those with tenure seem to know a
lot more," said Logan. "There's a definite
disadvantage of students having only
one-year terms." (Mayer is the only
two-termer.)
Meetings often plod along on a fixed
course. "The committee could be more
effective if . . . it didn't stick to such a rigid
agenda," said Logan.
"There is some frustration when things
move slowly and things don't get discussed,"
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel said.
In trying to counter this, Mayer has
found that "we [students J got much more
done when we met with Hargadon
separately."
Official meetings are infrequent. C-UAFA's
charge requires six meetings per year, and the
committee met only that many times.
Huff and Mayer both called for more
meetings. Fetter said, however, that he would
be "much less willing to serve on the
committee if it met too often. 1 have other
obligations within my department."
According to Siegel, "the chairman
[Green j is reluctant to overwork people."
SWOPSI: United Battle
While C-UAFA tends to rely on Hargadon
in deference to his position, the members of
the SWOPSI Policy Board are supportive of
program director Dan Lewis for a d.ifferent
reason: SWOPSI's continuing fight ? for
autonomy.
Student member Chris Elms called Lewis
"clearly the dominant force on the Board."
Faculty members respect Lewis, Elms said,
because he knows a lot about the program's
courses, and students respect him because
they know he has fought for the program for
years. (Lewis has been director since
SWOPSI's inception in 1969, but is resigning
this August.)

Although faculty members contribute far
more than the students, Elms attributed that
to agreement, not intimidation.
Elms, student chairperson Chris Baron and
another student complimented the faculty
members 011 their assistance to students, and
recognized the need for it. Said Elms, "If this
were I only] a student committee, it wouldn't
mean a thing. Students in this university don't
have a clout."
Baron noted that faculty members are
helpful in contributing a realistic view of how
much can be taught in one quarter when the
Board is discussing courses.
Academic standards for courses are the
only significant area of disagreement on this
otherwise united committee. A few members,
such as Elms, feel the Board "worries
sometimes too much whether something has
'sufficient academic rigor,' " thus discouraging
students from teaching courses. But pressure
from the administration has led to tightened
criteria.

Although the Board's main job is approving
courses, it has spent much of its time haggling
with Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs over funds and policies.
Elms expressed concern over what he saw
as the dean's apparent tendency to regard
SWOPSI- as a "proving-ground" for
departmental courses. English Prof. William
Chace, another Board member, said the
program is just "too anarchistic, too sloppy,
too unruly" for Gibbs.
Gibbs has proposed merging SWOPSI with
the Undergraduate Specials program, a
proposal the Board has fought vehemently.
In addition, the dean informed the Board
April 30 that SWOPSI funding for next year
was in question because his reserve funds,
traditionally used for the program, had dried
up. As an economy move, Gibbs also
proposed that full-time staffer Merlyn Payne's
job be reduced to four hours per day; the
Board has opposed this move as well.
Some members have begun to doubt the
Board's effectiveness in the long run and
many have viewed their role in accordance
with Lewis' motto — "Dare to struggle, dare
to stalemate."
Public Events: Yes Men?
The Committee on Public Events appears
to suffer, too, from a dependency on the
administrator whom it oversees. Of 11
committee members the four students and
four faculty do appear to contribute equally
and substantially, but the whole committee's
role in bringing public events to campus is
limited.

student member Mary Lou Johnson.
A review of the committee minutes shows
that recent business consisted mostly of
reports by Bacchetti.
"We run this institution on an advocacy
system," said Bacchetti. "If somebody can
make a case I'm more than receptive and if
I'm persuaded I'll do it, but we're not going to

C-15: A Virtual Standoff

non-cooperation has developed in the

He hastens to add that faculty members on
COSS haven't been uncooperative, but that
schedule conflicts allow them "limited
availability."
These conflicts include simultaneous
P'aculty Senate meetings for two members and
frequent out-of-town trips by the third,
Electrical Engineering Prof. O.G. Villard, who
attended his first meeting May 1.
Another hindrance is the alienation some
faculty members feel toward the business of
COSS. "I found myself not saying too much,"
says Andersen. "Most of the topics seemed
primarily of concern to students."
Andersen is not sure more faculty input is
desirable. Given the nature of COSS, "it's not
obvious you'd want to" increase such input,
he says. "There's no reason to solicit more
faculty input for the issues we had this year."
CEEW: A Woman's Year
"This was the year of the woman student
here," according to senior Barbara Brown,
student member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
The committee's charter states that its
duties include the "improvement of
educational and occupational opportunities"
here and the development of "avenues for
increasing [the number of) women faculty
members."
CEEW succeeded in getting the student
affairs office to establish a "women's
advocate" and persuading the provost's office
to fund a study on the education of women at
Stanford, to be completed next year.
Still, said Brown, "we could have done a
lot more." Problems with the committee
chairmanship marred CEEW's year.
The committee did show several strengths,
according to its members. "We were a
cohesive group this year," said Brown. Most
members of CEEW are women activists, and
disputes concerning goals were rare.
CEEW avoids a problem of other
committees: disinterested members. Graduate
student Barbara Glenn noted this problem,
saying many faculty members "are often
reluctant to serve on a committee." But, she
added, "we had a bunch this year who were
intensely interested in the issues."
Student members, however, have been"the
guiding force of the committee," according to
Amy Metcalfe, assistant to the provost. Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams agreed:
"The women students played as great, or an
even greater role, than the other members."
CEEW lacked a strong leader for much of
the year. "We would often meet and throw
out ideas, but you really need someone to
sum things up, narrow the focus so you can
begin to act on an issue," said Brown.
Metcalfe, who served as acting chairwoman
for the first two quarters, said, "We fell apart
after winter quarter this year." She blamed
the demise on "poor planning in changing the
chairmanship in the middle of the year."
Asst. English Prof. Diane Middlebrook was
appointed to a two-year term as chairwoman in
the fall of last year. She was on leave,
however, until this April, and has not yet
become active in CEEW. The committee met
only once this quarter.
Middlebrook said she was appointed to
CEEW "against my better judgment. I accept
working on committees as part of my job at
Stanford." She thought the committee ran

smoothly this year because "the personalities
were harmonious and cooperative," but sees a
"complete turnover in membership next year"
when she will begin her first year as an active
chairwoman.
Former ASSU Vice President and member
Beth Garfield disagreed with the concept of
committees most widely held in the
University, that of an adviser. She saw the
committee's proper role as "putting pressure
on the appropriate decision-maker."
Garfield wants to change the committee's
focus next year. "Probably too much
emphasis was placed on the students' position
this year," she said. "We really need to take
up staff issues next year."
Metcalfe, however, didn't share Garfield's
concern.
Thus CEEW may be faced with its first

intra-committee dispute which would disturb
the present homogeneity of membership.
CUS: Inhibited Students
Charged by the Academic Council to
formulate "policies governing the structure of
the undergraduate curriculum," changes in
degree programs and the academic advising
system, the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has been quite active, according
to many of its members. Some student
delegates to CUS, however, apparently have
remained dormant.
CUS' accomplishments for 1973-74 are
apparently many, though few are tangible. Its
central problem rests with student
involvement: only three of its 10 members,
CUS' charge dictates, may be undergraduate
students. The remainder are from the
Academic Council, and the resulting
dominance prompted one of the student
members, Betty Muth, to comment, "I always
had the feeling I wasn't being taken seriously
by some faculty on the committee."
An inspection of the minutes of CUS' first
14 meetings this year indicates a dominance
of contributions by faculty members. It
reveals a startling fact: except for an exchange
on the policies of the ASSU Nominations
Committee at CUS' first meeting, student
member and now-ASSU President Mike
Herman had not made a single recorded
contribution to CUS meetings until the one of
May 8.
"[Herman| is not a frequent contributor,"
says Dean of Undergra'duate Studies James
Gibbs, an ex-officio member of CUS. But,
Gibbs says, "when Herman does
[contribute], it's something valuable."
CUS Chairman Richard A. Brody, assistant
professor of political science, agreed with
Gibbs. "Herman is a solid guy. He doesn't say
much but when he does it's something good."
"Word for jvord, I myself don't contribute
as much as some members," Herman admits.
But, he says, "my contribution has been as
great as the other students' [Betty Muth and
Tom Wattles]
Muth disagrees, "I don't think either one
of the guys contributes very much. There's
many meetings where he [Herman] doesn't
say anything."
Herman attributes his lack of mention in
CUS minutes to a subconscious bias in favor
of faculty members on the part of committee
secretary Alice Supton. He said he found
"most upsetting" the dearth of student
comments in the minutes.
Supton admits, "It might be that
unconsciously I didn't pay attention to
students." However, she insists her minutes
"pretty much do" reflect the relative
contributions. "I just found that Mike didn't
say as much."
Imagined or not, Herman's
non-contribution reflects a major concern of
CUS: the amount and worth of student input.
"It's variable," Gibbs says of student input.
"There are some issues students are not
interested in."
"The students are pretty general
contributors ... an important part of the
system," says chairman Brody.
Muth paints a less rosy picture. "The
problem is that faculty are reluctant to
change. They use the committee as an
instrument to define what we already have."
"The main problem [for students] is
continuity," says Gibbs. It takes one quarter
for them to learn how it [committee]
operates."
Muth strongly agrees: "Student
appointments [now one year] should be
longer," she says. "This year I've just gotten a
taste."
Investigation Summary
These seven committees can be taken to
represent the committee system in
microcosm. From their cases, a number of
problems stand out:
—Some faculty serve on committees only
as part of what they consider an "unwritten
obligation." Others serve by their own
request, and seem to become more involved
(as on CEEW) rather than disinterested (as on
COSS).
—Faculty attendance is often spotty. When
Faculty Senate members serve on committees
as well, schedule conflicts often arise. And
faculty members often find it difficult to
attach the same importance to committee
memberships that they do to their classes.
—Student views are sometimes given short
shrift. On CUS, for example, student members
perceive that their contributions are valued
less than those of faculty members. On
CEEW, on the other hand, faculty members'
active interest in student views — and greater
initiative and effort on the part of student
members — have proved effective.
—Committees intended as policy-setting
groups often defer to the "superior
knowledge" of the administrators they are
supposed to oversee. As a result, committees
often act solely on administrators'
recommendations — instead of undertaking
more independent deliberations.
—Faculty are currently given three-year
terms, while students are generally limited to
one year. In committees of a continuing
nature, such as C-US and C-UAFA, this
limitation hampers student input.
—While the ASSU currently requires
student committee members to file reports of
their performance, the Academic Council does
not request such reports. The
"accountability" of all committee members is
unclear.
—Committee meetings are not open to
effective press coverage. Confidentiality is
important to some committees (such as C-15),
but student and faculty skepticism of secret
deliberations may hamper input. Greater
monitoring and publicity might help both
student and faculty members to be more
effective.
Next year, the ASSU Council of Presidents
plans to assign a student staff assistant to each
committee's student members. ASSU
President Mike Herman says "better liaison
between student government and students on
committees" will result from the posts.

A lack of "relevant data," faculty cooperation and help from Gibbs.

MASON BLACHER BARBARA BROWN MIKE HERMAN
A year for financial hangups, a women's advocate and "upsetting" minutes.
"You can't hold a committee responsible
for a decision," says Assoc. Dean of Student
. iffairs Dan Williams.
But the Stanford administration, faculty
and Board of Trustees hold these groups
responsible for something, and usually it's
called "input." Together they've set up 48
different committees that contain student
members, and such groups are virtually the
only means a student has of "inputting" into
vhe decisions that shape his university.
Three major types of committees exist
here: those impaneled by the University
president, usually under the eye of an
ex-officio member who is a part of the
administration; those of the Academic
Council, governing body of the faculty (these
contain a minority of student members
and a majority from the Council); and those
of the trustees, whose minutes and
deliberations are confidential.
Just what are these committees
accomplishing, and how effective are the
students who serve on them? To find out, the
Daily has conducted an in-depth investigation
of seven committees it believes representative
of the system. No trustee committee is
included; their records are not open to the
press.
Points explored in this investigation
include the amount — and quality — of
student and faculty input; student and faculty
interest, as reflected in attendance records;
the question of possible dominance of a
committee by the official it is intended to
advise; committee harmony and conflicts;
and, finally, the accountability of committee
members to those they represent.
The investigation has revealed that
although participation on committees has
often been inadequate, some committees
stand as monuments to how change in the
University can be achieved by "going through
channels."
C-UAFA: Power Unused
Though most University committees are
admittedly only advisory bodies to an
administrator in their area, the charge of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (C-UAFA) empowers this group
to make certain "determinations."
Among these are the content of application
forms, the number of students to be admitted,
requirements for admission (and exceptions to
these), standards for establishing priority for
financial aid and the types of aid available.
Despite being blessed with such unusual
power, committee members apparently are
not taking advantage of their position. The
reason, in the words of student member
Michael Jennings, is that "[Dean of
Admissions Fred] Hargadon seems to run
things." Committee chairman Paul Green,
professor of biological sciences, said,
"Hargadon influences the committee most.
He's more informed."
Assoc. Physics Prof. Alexander Fetter
agreed that Hargadon "is generally persuasive.
The commiuoe seems to agree with
Hargadon."
Quinn Mayer, student member and now
ASSU vice president, stated, "The committee
is an advisory panel to Dean Hargadon."
Praise for both Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff was nearly
unanimous among C-UAFA members. Some
didn't feel Hargadon's domination of meetings
was detrimental.
"Dean Hargadon will accept a student's
opinion if it is intelligent enough," said
student member Carmen Logan.
Huff said although C-UAFA members "are
not, in effect, running the office . . . they
determine what type of students should be at
Stanford and make sure they can come here
once accepted. We have to follow their
recommendations."
In Mayer's words, Hargadon "is the one
who has access to all the materials and
relevant data."
"I'm expected to know more about
admissions," said Hargadon, pointing out that
committees are only extra-curricular duties
for their members. "Should something go
wrong at an operational level, it's my
responsibility. You don't fire teachers or
expel students for a mistake they make on a
committee."
Some C-UAFA members are unable to
contribute significantly because they lack
expertise. "Those with tenure seem to know a
lot more," said Logan. "There's a definite
disadvantage of students having only
one-year terms." (Mayer is the only
two-termer.)
Meetings often plod along on a fixed
course. "The committee could be more
effective if . . . it didn't stick to such a rigid
agenda," said Logan.
"There is some frustration when things
move slowly and things don't get discussed,"
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel said.
In trying to counter this, Mayer has
found that "we [students J got much more
done when we met with Hargadon
separately."
Official meetings are infrequent. C-UAFA's
charge requires six meetings per year, and the
committee met only that many times.
Huff and Mayer both called for more
meetings. Fetter said, however, that he would
be "much less willing to serve on the
committee if it met too often. 1 have other
obligations within my department."
According to Siegel, "the chairman
[Green j is reluctant to overwork people."
SWOPSI: United Battle
While C-UAFA tends to rely on Hargadon
in deference to his position, the members of
the SWOPSI Policy Board are supportive of
program director Dan Lewis for a d.ifferent
reason: SWOPSI's continuing fight ? for
autonomy.
Student member Chris Elms called Lewis
"clearly the dominant force on the Board."
Faculty members respect Lewis, Elms said,
because he knows a lot about the program's
courses, and students respect him because
they know he has fought for the program for
years. (Lewis has been director since
SWOPSI's inception in 1969, but is resigning
this August.)

Although faculty members contribute far
more than the students, Elms attributed that
to agreement, not intimidation.
Elms, student chairperson Chris Baron and
another student complimented the faculty
members 011 their assistance to students, and
recognized the need for it. Said Elms, "If this
were I only] a student committee, it wouldn't
mean a thing. Students in this university don't
have a clout."
Baron noted that faculty members are
helpful in contributing a realistic view of how
much can be taught in one quarter when the
Board is discussing courses.
Academic standards for courses are the
only significant area of disagreement on this
otherwise united committee. A few members,
such as Elms, feel the Board "worries
sometimes too much whether something has
'sufficient academic rigor,' " thus discouraging
students from teaching courses. But pressure
from the administration has led to tightened
criteria.

Although the Board's main job is approving
courses, it has spent much of its time haggling
with Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs over funds and policies.
Elms expressed concern over what he saw
as the dean's apparent tendency to regard
SWOPSI- as a "proving-ground" for
departmental courses. English Prof. William
Chace, another Board member, said the
program is just "too anarchistic, too sloppy,
too unruly" for Gibbs.
Gibbs has proposed merging SWOPSI with
the Undergraduate Specials program, a
proposal the Board has fought vehemently.
In addition, the dean informed the Board
April 30 that SWOPSI funding for next year
was in question because his reserve funds,
traditionally used for the program, had dried
up. As an economy move, Gibbs also
proposed that full-time staffer Merlyn Payne's
job be reduced to four hours per day; the
Board has opposed this move as well.
Some members have begun to doubt the
Board's effectiveness in the long run and
many have viewed their role in accordance
with Lewis' motto — "Dare to struggle, dare
to stalemate."
Public Events: Yes Men?
The Committee on Public Events appears
to suffer, too, from a dependency on the
administrator whom it oversees. Of 11
committee members the four students and
four faculty do appear to contribute equally
and substantially, but the whole committee's
role in bringing public events to campus is
limited.
According to the 1971 public events policy
manual, the committee "govern[sj all
non-academic, non-athletic programs which
are held ... on University property and which
are open to the public or to all students. . ."
Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti said
the specifics of these performances are carried
out mainly by his office. The primary duty 0/
the committee, he said, is "policy setting not
programming."
Student member 800 Bacon said of the
committee, "It does fulfill public events that a
lot of students are concerned about, but
authority is vested in Tom Bacchetti. He is
capable but his taste can't possibly reflect the
whole Stanford community."
"The committee is just a rubber stamp
committee — it doesn't do much," said
student member Mary Lou Johnson.
A review of the committee minutes shows
that recent business consisted mostly of
reports by Bacchetti.
"We run this institution on an advocacy
system," said Bacchetti. "If somebody can
make a case I'm more than receptive and if
I'm persuaded I'll do it, but we're not going to
overreact to some ideas which aren't fully
realized yet."
"We only appeal to one segment of the
community," said Bacon. "Bacchetti is open
but he's going to go ahead and do what he'll
do unless you can make it [a proposal] seem
solid."
Bacchetti admits that most of the
programming done by his office "tends to be
somewhat conservative ... they are usually
things which complement academic
programming."
Student member Mason Blacher said, "I've
lobbied for University support for
student-initiated theater and drama for one
and a half >ears."
Education Prof. Robert Textor said he too
pushed for mixed offerings.
Blacher blames financial hangups rather
than Bacchetti for the Public Events failings.
"The University recognizes him when he
brings quartets and outside talents rather than
when he helps ... University groups."
Bacon points out that it is the
responsibility of students on the committee
"to have some commitment." He said
students on the committee should frequently
poll the student body, "something we haven't
done."
One student member who did consider
himself effective was ASSU Special Events
Director Dan Scher.
Scher said he was "instrumental" in
scheduling several jazz concerts on campus
next year.

Bacon said he tried to establish a Black
Cultural program next year but Bacchetti said
Bacon's proposals were not all accepted
"because of our financial responsibility to the
University."
C-15: A Virtual Standoff
An unusual milieu of intra-committee
non-cooperation has developed in the
Committee of 15 (C-15), the
faculty-student-administration panel to revise
the student judicial system.
According to two student members,
backlash among faculty members against the
defeat of the C-15 proposal last October has
resulted in a standoff between two sides of
the group.
"They [faculty] felt generous over the
October proposal," said student member
Philip Whistler. The faculty didn't want to
drag along work on a proposal for the entire
year, Whistler said.
The October proposal was overwhelmingly

defeated by students after some key student
members of the C-15 opposed it, claiming that
student judicial rights were not guaranteed.
Whistler said, "There was a standoff in last
year's [October] scheme." He said both sides
had made significant compromises in order to
reach an agreement, and submitted the
proposal because they "thought it was the
best we could get" under the prevailing
circumstances.
The major problem with the C-15 this year
was "too little time to formulate new
proposals" after the October defeat, according
to student member David Herst. Only two
C-15 meetings were held this year.
Student members of the C-15 recently have
proposed a new judicial plan which would
establish a faculty "buffer zone" in judicial
proceedings between students and the
administration.
Under the plan, an all-student panel would
make judicial recommendations to the dean of
students. If he disagreed with them, a separate
faculty board would take up the matter. Its
decision would have to be approved by the
University president.
Herst noted some urgency in the proposal.
He said the present Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) is not a big issue anymore, and"the
ionger you wait [in proposing a new system]
the more legitimate the CJP becomes."
"The judicial system as it now stands is fair
and very efficient and I see no pressure for
change," Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a former
C-15 member, told the Daily April 9.
Business Prof. Harold Leavitt, however,
said in the same issue that "what is really
needed is for students to put forward new
proposals because the faculty and
administration probably won't put forward
anything new." Leavitt is returning to the
C-15 next year.
Whistler felt that extended terms for
student members of C-15 were not necessary.
"It is a good idea to get new people involved
because the older members can get into
terrible ruts," he said.
Faculty Quiet On COSS
A similar schism, though well below the
surface and not manifesting itself publicly,
may affect the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS).
COSS is charged by the University
president to look into areas of student life,

including residences and campus
organizations.
Most agree that faculty input on COSS has
been limited, primarily because the issues the
committee confronts are of little interest to
faculty members. One of three on the
eight-person committee, Asst. Chemistry Prof.
Hans C. Andersen, says, "For the kinds of
things we talked about this year, I can't see
how it [faculty input] was useful."
Other ills afflict COSS, the only University
committee with a student chairman and
student majority. Chairman Bill Rifkin says of
the committee's charge, which requires at
least two meetings per quarter, "We haven't
been living up to it at all."
Now meeting more regularly, COSS has
been involved in revision of the housing draw,
formulation of a report on the need for new

undergraduate housing and establishment of
provisions for selection of residence staffs,
according to Rifkin.
Dealings between the housing office and
COSS bring to light another major drawback
of the committee: adequate representation of
students. Rifkin says "blame was put in the
wrong place" when some students voiced
objections to the transfer of the black theme
house from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia in April.
Rifkin and Andersen agree that the reputed
lack of student input prior to the decision was
the fault of the committee, not Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton. "The
problem isn't between the housing office and
the committee," Rifkin says, "but between
the committee and the student body."
"Five students aren't representative of the
entire student body," Rifkin says. "We have
been blinded to certain issues." Among them
are those involving minorities: COSS' students
are all white.
The main problem with COSS, however,
remains its faculty input. "I haven't been
entirely happy with it,"says chairman Rifkin.
He hastens to add that faculty members on
COSS haven't been uncooperative, but that
schedule conflicts allow them "limited
availability."
These conflicts include simultaneous
P'aculty Senate meetings for two members and
frequent out-of-town trips by the third,
Electrical Engineering Prof. O.G. Villard, who
attended his first meeting May 1.
Another hindrance is the alienation some
faculty members feel toward the business of
COSS. "I found myself not saying too much,"
says Andersen. "Most of the topics seemed
primarily of concern to students."
Andersen is not sure more faculty input is
desirable. Given the nature of COSS, "it's not
obvious you'd want to" increase such input,
he says. "There's no reason to solicit more
faculty input for the issues we had this year."
CEEW: A Woman's Year
"This was the year of the woman student
here," according to senior Barbara Brown,
student member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
The committee's charter states that its
duties include the "improvement of

as part of what they consider an "unwritten
obligation." Others serve by their own
request, and seem to become more involved
(as on CEEW) rather than disinterested (as on
COSS).
—Faculty attendance is often spotty. When
Faculty Senate members serve on committees
as well, schedule conflicts often arise. And
faculty members often find it difficult to
attach the same importance to committee
memberships that they do to their classes.
—Student views are sometimes given short
shrift. On CUS, for example, student members
perceive that their contributions are valued
less than those of faculty members. On
CEEW, on the other hand, faculty members'
active interest in student views — and greater
initiative and effort on the part of student
members — have proved effective.
—Committees intended as policy-setting
groups often defer to the "superior
knowledge" of the administrators they are
supposed to oversee. As a result, committees
often act solely on administrators'
recommendations — instead of undertaking
more independent deliberations.
—Faculty are currently given three-year
terms, while students are generally limited to
one year. In committees of a continuing
nature, such as C-US and C-UAFA, this
limitation hampers student input.
—While the ASSU currently requires
student committee members to file reports of
their performance, the Academic Council does
not request such reports. The
"accountability" of all committee members is
unclear.
—Committee meetings are not open to
effective press coverage. Confidentiality is
important to some committees (such as C-15),
but student and faculty skepticism of secret
deliberations may hamper input. Greater
monitoring and publicity might help both
student and faculty members to be more
effective.
Next year, the ASSU Council of Presidents
plans to assign a student staff assistant to each
committee's student members. ASSU
President Mike Herman says "better liaison
between student government and students on
committees" will result from the posts.

A year for financial hangups, a women's advocate and "upsetting" minutes.
"You can't hold a committee responsible
for a decision," says Assoc. Dean of Student
. iffairs Dan Williams.
But the Stanford administration, faculty
and Board of Trustees hold these groups
responsible for something, and usually it's
called "input." Together they've set up 48
different committees that contain student
members, and such groups are virtually the
only means a student has of "inputting" into
vhe decisions that shape his university.
Three major types of committees exist
here: those impaneled by the University
president, usually under the eye of an
ex-officio member who is a part of the
administration; those of the Academic
Council, governing body of the faculty (these
contain a minority of student members
and a majority from the Council); and those
of the trustees, whose minutes and
deliberations are confidential.
Just what are these committees
accomplishing, and how effective are the
students who serve on them? To find out, the
Daily has conducted an in-depth investigation
of seven committees it believes representative
of the system. No trustee committee is
included; their records are not open to the
press.
Points explored in this investigation
include the amount — and quality — of
student and faculty input; student and faculty
interest, as reflected in attendance records;
the question of possible dominance of a
committee by the official it is intended to
advise; committee harmony and conflicts;
and, finally, the accountability of committee
members to those they represent.
The investigation has revealed that
although participation on committees has
often been inadequate, some committees
stand as monuments to how change in the
University can be achieved by "going through
channels."
C-UAFA: Power Unused
Though most University committees are
admittedly only advisory bodies to an
administrator in their area, the charge of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (C-UAFA) empowers this group
to make certain "determinations."
Among these are the content of application
forms, the number of students to be admitted,
requirements for admission (and exceptions to
these), standards for establishing priority for
financial aid and the types of aid available.
Despite being blessed with such unusual
power, committee members apparently are
not taking advantage of their position. The
reason, in the words of student member
Michael Jennings, is that "[Dean of
Admissions Fred] Hargadon seems to run
things." Committee chairman Paul Green,
professor of biological sciences, said,
"Hargadon influences the committee most.
He's more informed."
Assoc. Physics Prof. Alexander Fetter
agreed that Hargadon "is generally persuasive.
The commiuoe seems to agree with
Hargadon."
Quinn Mayer, student member and now
ASSU vice president, stated, "The committee
is an advisory panel to Dean Hargadon."
Praise for both Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff was nearly
unanimous among C-UAFA members. Some
didn't feel Hargadon's domination of meetings
was detrimental.
"Dean Hargadon will accept a student's
opinion if it is intelligent enough," said
student member Carmen Logan.
Huff said although C-UAFA members "are
not, in effect, running the office . . . they
determine what type of students should be at
Stanford and make sure they can come here
once accepted. We have to follow their
recommendations."
In Mayer's words, Hargadon "is the one
who has access to all the materials and
relevant data."
"I'm expected to know more about
admissions," said Hargadon, pointing out that
committees are only extra-curricular duties
for their members. "Should something go
wrong at an operational level, it's my
responsibility. You don't fire teachers or
expel students for a mistake they make on a
committee."
Some C-UAFA members are unable to
contribute significantly because they lack
expertise. "Those with tenure seem to know a
lot more," said Logan. "There's a definite
disadvantage of students having only
one-year terms." (Mayer is the only
two-termer.)
Meetings often plod along on a fixed
course. "The committee could be more
effective if . . . it didn't stick to such a rigid
agenda," said Logan.
"There is some frustration when things
move slowly and things don't get discussed,"
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel said.
In trying to counter this, Mayer has
found that "we [students J got much more
done when we met with Hargadon
separately."
Official meetings are infrequent. C-UAFA's
charge requires six meetings per year, and the
committee met only that many times.
Huff and Mayer both called for more
meetings. Fetter said, however, that he would
be "much less willing to serve on the
committee if it met too often. 1 have other
obligations within my department."
According to Siegel, "the chairman
[Green j is reluctant to overwork people."
SWOPSI: United Battle
While C-UAFA tends to rely on Hargadon
in deference to his position, the members of
the SWOPSI Policy Board are supportive of
program director Dan Lewis for a d.ifferent
reason: SWOPSI's continuing fight ? for
autonomy.
Student member Chris Elms called Lewis
"clearly the dominant force on the Board."
Faculty members respect Lewis, Elms said,
because he knows a lot about the program's
courses, and students respect him because
they know he has fought for the program for
years. (Lewis has been director since
SWOPSI's inception in 1969, but is resigning
this August.)

Although faculty members contribute far
more than the students, Elms attributed that
to agreement, not intimidation.
Elms, student chairperson Chris Baron and
another student complimented the faculty
members 011 their assistance to students, and
recognized the need for it. Said Elms, "If this
were I only] a student committee, it wouldn't
mean a thing. Students in this university don't
have a clout."
Baron noted that faculty members are
helpful in contributing a realistic view of how
much can be taught in one quarter when the
Board is discussing courses.
Academic standards for courses are the
only significant area of disagreement on this
otherwise united committee. A few members,
such as Elms, feel the Board "worries
sometimes too much whether something has
'sufficient academic rigor,' " thus discouraging
students from teaching courses. But pressure
from the administration has led to tightened
criteria.

Although the Board's main job is approving
courses, it has spent much of its time haggling
with Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs over funds and policies.
Elms expressed concern over what he saw
as the dean's apparent tendency to regard
SWOPSI- as a "proving-ground" for
departmental courses. English Prof. William
Chace, another Board member, said the
program is just "too anarchistic, too sloppy,
too unruly" for Gibbs.
Gibbs has proposed merging SWOPSI with
the Undergraduate Specials program, a
proposal the Board has fought vehemently.
In addition, the dean informed the Board
April 30 that SWOPSI funding for next year
was in question because his reserve funds,
traditionally used for the program, had dried
up. As an economy move, Gibbs also
proposed that full-time staffer Merlyn Payne's
job be reduced to four hours per day; the
Board has opposed this move as well.
Some members have begun to doubt the
Board's effectiveness in the long run and
many have viewed their role in accordance
with Lewis' motto — "Dare to struggle, dare
to stalemate."
Public Events: Yes Men?
The Committee on Public Events appears
to suffer, too, from a dependency on the
administrator whom it oversees. Of 11
committee members the four students and
four faculty do appear to contribute equally
and substantially, but the whole committee's
role in bringing public events to campus is
limited.
According to the 1971 public events policy
manual, the committee "govern[sj all
non-academic, non-athletic programs which
are held ... on University property and which
are open to the public or to all students. . ."
Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti said
the specifics of these performances are carried
out mainly by his office. The primary duty 0/
the committee, he said, is "policy setting not
programming."
Student member 800 Bacon said of the
committee, "It does fulfill public events that a
lot of students are concerned about, but
authority is vested in Tom Bacchetti. He is
capable but his taste can't possibly reflect the
whole Stanford community."
"The committee is just a rubber stamp
committee — it doesn't do much," said
student member Mary Lou Johnson.
A review of the committee minutes shows
that recent business consisted mostly of
reports by Bacchetti.
"We run this institution on an advocacy
system," said Bacchetti. "If somebody can
make a case I'm more than receptive and if
I'm persuaded I'll do it, but we're not going to
overreact to some ideas which aren't fully
realized yet."
"We only appeal to one segment of the
community," said Bacon. "Bacchetti is open
but he's going to go ahead and do what he'll
do unless you can make it [a proposal] seem
solid."
Bacchetti admits that most of the
programming done by his office "tends to be
somewhat conservative ... they are usually
things which complement academic
programming."
Student member Mason Blacher said, "I've
lobbied for University support for
student-initiated theater and drama for one
and a half >ears."
Education Prof. Robert Textor said he too
pushed for mixed offerings.
Blacher blames financial hangups rather
than Bacchetti for the Public Events failings.
"The University recognizes him when he
brings quartets and outside talents rather than
when he helps ... University groups."
Bacon points out that it is the
responsibility of students on the committee
"to have some commitment." He said
students on the committee should frequently
poll the student body, "something we haven't
done."
One student member who did consider
himself effective was ASSU Special Events
Director Dan Scher.
Scher said he was "instrumental" in
scheduling several jazz concerts on campus
next year.

Bacon said he tried to establish a Black
Cultural program next year but Bacchetti said
Bacon's proposals were not all accepted
"because of our financial responsibility to the
University."
C-15: A Virtual Standoff
An unusual milieu of intra-committee
non-cooperation has developed in the
Committee of 15 (C-15), the
faculty-student-administration panel to revise
the student judicial system.
According to two student members,
backlash among faculty members against the
defeat of the C-15 proposal last October has
resulted in a standoff between two sides of
the group.
"They [faculty] felt generous over the
October proposal," said student member
Philip Whistler. The faculty didn't want to
drag along work on a proposal for the entire
year, Whistler said.
The October proposal was overwhelmingly

defeated by students after some key student
members of the C-15 opposed it, claiming that
student judicial rights were not guaranteed.
Whistler said, "There was a standoff in last
year's [October] scheme." He said both sides
had made significant compromises in order to
reach an agreement, and submitted the
proposal because they "thought it was the
best we could get" under the prevailing
circumstances.
The major problem with the C-15 this year
was "too little time to formulate new
proposals" after the October defeat, according
to student member David Herst. Only two
C-15 meetings were held this year.
Student members of the C-15 recently have
proposed a new judicial plan which would
establish a faculty "buffer zone" in judicial
proceedings between students and the
administration.
Under the plan, an all-student panel would
make judicial recommendations to the dean of
students. If he disagreed with them, a separate
faculty board would take up the matter. Its
decision would have to be approved by the
University president.
Herst noted some urgency in the proposal.
He said the present Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) is not a big issue anymore, and"the
ionger you wait [in proposing a new system]
the more legitimate the CJP becomes."
"The judicial system as it now stands is fair
and very efficient and I see no pressure for
change," Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a former
C-15 member, told the Daily April 9.
Business Prof. Harold Leavitt, however,
said in the same issue that "what is really
needed is for students to put forward new
proposals because the faculty and
administration probably won't put forward
anything new." Leavitt is returning to the
C-15 next year.
Whistler felt that extended terms for
student members of C-15 were not necessary.
"It is a good idea to get new people involved
because the older members can get into
terrible ruts," he said.
Faculty Quiet On COSS
A similar schism, though well below the
surface and not manifesting itself publicly,
may affect the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS).
COSS is charged by the University
president to look into areas of student life,

including residences and campus
organizations.
Most agree that faculty input on COSS has
been limited, primarily because the issues the
committee confronts are of little interest to
faculty members. One of three on the
eight-person committee, Asst. Chemistry Prof.
Hans C. Andersen, says, "For the kinds of
things we talked about this year, I can't see
how it [faculty input] was useful."
Other ills afflict COSS, the only University
committee with a student chairman and
student majority. Chairman Bill Rifkin says of
the committee's charge, which requires at
least two meetings per quarter, "We haven't
been living up to it at all."
Now meeting more regularly, COSS has
been involved in revision of the housing draw,
formulation of a report on the need for new

undergraduate housing and establishment of
provisions for selection of residence staffs,
according to Rifkin.
Dealings between the housing office and
COSS bring to light another major drawback
of the committee: adequate representation of
students. Rifkin says "blame was put in the
wrong place" when some students voiced
objections to the transfer of the black theme
house from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia in April.
Rifkin and Andersen agree that the reputed
lack of student input prior to the decision was
the fault of the committee, not Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton. "The
problem isn't between the housing office and
the committee," Rifkin says, "but between
the committee and the student body."
"Five students aren't representative of the
entire student body," Rifkin says. "We have
been blinded to certain issues." Among them
are those involving minorities: COSS' students
are all white.
The main problem with COSS, however,
remains its faculty input. "I haven't been
entirely happy with it,"says chairman Rifkin.
He hastens to add that faculty members on
COSS haven't been uncooperative, but that
schedule conflicts allow them "limited
availability."
These conflicts include simultaneous
P'aculty Senate meetings for two members and
frequent out-of-town trips by the third,
Electrical Engineering Prof. O.G. Villard, who
attended his first meeting May 1.
Another hindrance is the alienation some
faculty members feel toward the business of
COSS. "I found myself not saying too much,"
says Andersen. "Most of the topics seemed
primarily of concern to students."
Andersen is not sure more faculty input is
desirable. Given the nature of COSS, "it's not
obvious you'd want to" increase such input,
he says. "There's no reason to solicit more
faculty input for the issues we had this year."
CEEW: A Woman's Year
"This was the year of the woman student
here," according to senior Barbara Brown,
student member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
The committee's charter states that its
duties include the "improvement of
educational and occupational opportunities"
here and the development of "avenues for
increasing [the number of) women faculty
members."
CEEW succeeded in getting the student
affairs office to establish a "women's
advocate" and persuading the provost's office
to fund a study on the education of women at
Stanford, to be completed next year.
Still, said Brown, "we could have done a
lot more." Problems with the committee
chairmanship marred CEEW's year.
The committee did show several strengths,
according to its members. "We were a
cohesive group this year," said Brown. Most
members of CEEW are women activists, and
disputes concerning goals were rare.
CEEW avoids a problem of other
committees: disinterested members. Graduate
student Barbara Glenn noted this problem,
saying many faculty members "are often
reluctant to serve on a committee." But, she
added, "we had a bunch this year who were
intensely interested in the issues."
Student members, however, have been"the
guiding force of the committee," according to
Amy Metcalfe, assistant to the provost. Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams agreed:
"The women students played as great, or an
even greater role, than the other members."
CEEW lacked a strong leader for much of
the year. "We would often meet and throw
out ideas, but you really need someone to
sum things up, narrow the focus so you can
begin to act on an issue," said Brown.
Metcalfe, who served as acting chairwoman
for the first two quarters, said, "We fell apart
after winter quarter this year." She blamed
the demise on "poor planning in changing the
chairmanship in the middle of the year."
Asst. English Prof. Diane Middlebrook was
appointed to a two-year term as chairwoman in
the fall of last year. She was on leave,
however, until this April, and has not yet
become active in CEEW. The committee met
only once this quarter.
Middlebrook said she was appointed to
CEEW "against my better judgment. I accept
working on committees as part of my job at
Stanford." She thought the committee ran

smoothly this year because "the personalities
were harmonious and cooperative," but sees a
"complete turnover in membership next year"
when she will begin her first year as an active
chairwoman.
Former ASSU Vice President and member
Beth Garfield disagreed with the concept of
committees most widely held in the
University, that of an adviser. She saw the
committee's proper role as "putting pressure
on the appropriate decision-maker."
Garfield wants to change the committee's
focus next year. "Probably too much
emphasis was placed on the students' position
this year," she said. "We really need to take
up staff issues next year."
Metcalfe, however, didn't share Garfield's
concern.
Thus CEEW may be faced with its first

intra-committee dispute which would disturb
the present homogeneity of membership.
CUS: Inhibited Students
Charged by the Academic Council to
formulate "policies governing the structure of
the undergraduate curriculum," changes in
degree programs and the academic advising
system, the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has been quite active, according
to many of its members. Some student
delegates to CUS, however, apparently have
remained dormant.
CUS' accomplishments for 1973-74 are
apparently many, though few are tangible. Its
central problem rests with student
involvement: only three of its 10 members,
CUS' charge dictates, may be undergraduate
students. The remainder are from the
Academic Council, and the resulting
dominance prompted one of the student
members, Betty Muth, to comment, "I always
had the feeling I wasn't being taken seriously
by some faculty on the committee."
An inspection of the minutes of CUS' first
14 meetings this year indicates a dominance
of contributions by faculty members. It
reveals a startling fact: except for an exchange
on the policies of the ASSU Nominations
Committee at CUS' first meeting, student
member and now-ASSU President Mike
Herman had not made a single recorded
contribution to CUS meetings until the one of
May 8.
"[Herman| is not a frequent contributor,"
says Dean of Undergra'duate Studies James
Gibbs, an ex-officio member of CUS. But,
Gibbs says, "when Herman does
[contribute], it's something valuable."
CUS Chairman Richard A. Brody, assistant
professor of political science, agreed with
Gibbs. "Herman is a solid guy. He doesn't say
much but when he does it's something good."
"Word for jvord, I myself don't contribute
as much as some members," Herman admits.
But, he says, "my contribution has been as
great as the other students' [Betty Muth and
Tom Wattles]
Muth disagrees, "I don't think either one
of the guys contributes very much. There's
many meetings where he [Herman] doesn't
say anything."
Herman attributes his lack of mention in
CUS minutes to a subconscious bias in favor
of faculty members on the part of committee
secretary Alice Supton. He said he found
"most upsetting" the dearth of student
comments in the minutes.
Supton admits, "It might be that
unconsciously I didn't pay attention to
students." However, she insists her minutes
"pretty much do" reflect the relative
contributions. "I just found that Mike didn't
say as much."
Imagined or not, Herman's
non-contribution reflects a major concern of
CUS: the amount and worth of student input.
"It's variable," Gibbs says of student input.
"There are some issues students are not
interested in."
"The students are pretty general
contributors ... an important part of the
system," says chairman Brody.
Muth paints a less rosy picture. "The
problem is that faculty are reluctant to
change. They use the committee as an
instrument to define what we already have."
"The main problem [for students] is
continuity," says Gibbs. It takes one quarter
for them to learn how it [committee]
operates."
Muth strongly agrees: "Student
appointments [now one year] should be
longer," she says. "This year I've just gotten a
taste."
Investigation Summary
These seven committees can be taken to
represent the committee system in
microcosm. From their cases, a number of
problems stand out:
—Some faculty serve on committees only
as part of what they consider an "unwritten
obligation." Others serve by their own
request, and seem to become more involved
(as on CEEW) rather than disinterested (as on
COSS).
—Faculty attendance is often spotty. When
Faculty Senate members serve on committees
as well, schedule conflicts often arise. And
faculty members often find it difficult to
attach the same importance to committee
memberships that they do to their classes.
—Student views are sometimes given short
shrift. On CUS, for example, student members
perceive that their contributions are valued
less than those of faculty members. On
CEEW, on the other hand, faculty members'
active interest in student views — and greater
initiative and effort on the part of student
members — have proved effective.
—Committees intended as policy-setting
groups often defer to the "superior
knowledge" of the administrators they are
supposed to oversee. As a result, committees
often act solely on administrators'
recommendations — instead of undertaking
more independent deliberations.
—Faculty are currently given three-year
terms, while students are generally limited to
one year. In committees of a continuing

limitation hampers student input.
—While the ASSU currently requires
student committee members to file reports of

not request such reports. The
"accountability" of all committee members is
unclear.
—Committee meetings are not open to
effective press coverage. Confidentiality is

but student and faculty skepticism of secret

monitoring and publicity might help both
student and faculty members to be more

President Mike Herman says "better liaison
between student government and students on
committees" will result from the posts.

Student member Chris Elms called Lewis
"clearly the dominant force on the Board."
Faculty members respect Lewis, Elms said,
because he knows a lot about the program's
courses, and students respect him because
they know he has fought for the program for
years. (Lewis has been director since
SWOPSI's inception in 1969, but is resigning
this August.)

Although faculty members contribute far
more than the students, Elms attributed that
to agreement, not intimidation.
Elms, student chairperson Chris Baron and
another student complimented the faculty
members 011 their assistance to students, and
recognized the need for it. Said Elms, "If this
were I only] a student committee, it wouldn't
mean a thing. Students in this university don't
have a clout."
Baron noted that faculty members are
helpful in contributing a realistic view of how
much can be taught in one quarter when the
Board is discussing courses.
Academic standards for courses are the
only significant area of disagreement on this
otherwise united committee. A few members,
such as Elms, feel the Board "worries
sometimes too much whether something has
'sufficient academic rigor,' " thus discouraging
students from teaching courses. But pressure
from the administration has led to tightened
criteria.

Although the Board's main job is approving
courses, it has spent much of its time haggling
with Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs over funds and policies.
Elms expressed concern over what he saw
as the dean's apparent tendency to regard
SWOPSI- as a "proving-ground" for
departmental courses. English Prof. William
Chace, another Board member, said the
program is just "too anarchistic, too sloppy,
too unruly" for Gibbs.
Gibbs has proposed merging SWOPSI with
the Undergraduate Specials program, a
proposal the Board has fought vehemently.
In addition, the dean informed the Board
April 30 that SWOPSI funding for next year
was in question because his reserve funds,
traditionally used for the program, had dried
up. As an economy move, Gibbs also
proposed that full-time staffer Merlyn Payne's
job be reduced to four hours per day; the
Board has opposed this move as well.
Some members have begun to doubt the
Board's effectiveness in the long run and
many have viewed their role in accordance
with Lewis' motto — "Dare to struggle, dare
to stalemate."
Public Events: Yes Men?
The Committee on Public Events appears
to suffer, too, from a dependency on the
administrator whom it oversees. Of 11
committee members the four students and
four faculty do appear to contribute equally
and substantially, but the whole committee's
role in bringing public events to campus is
limited.
According to the 1971 public events policy
manual, the committee "govern[sj all
non-academic, non-athletic programs which
are held ... on University property and which
are open to the public or to all students. . ."
Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti said
the specifics of these performances are carried
out mainly by his office. The primary duty 0/
the committee, he said, is "policy setting not
programming."
Student member 800 Bacon said of the
committee, "It does fulfill public events that a
lot of students are concerned about, but
authority is vested in Tom Bacchetti. He is
capable but his taste can't possibly reflect the
whole Stanford community."
"The committee is just a rubber stamp
committee — it doesn't do much," said
student member Mary Lou Johnson.
A review of the committee minutes shows
that recent business consisted mostly of
reports by Bacchetti.
"We run this institution on an advocacy
system," said Bacchetti. "If somebody can
make a case I'm more than receptive and if
I'm persuaded I'll do it, but we're not going to
overreact to some ideas which aren't fully
realized yet."
"We only appeal to one segment of the
community," said Bacon. "Bacchetti is open
but he's going to go ahead and do what he'll
do unless you can make it [a proposal] seem
solid."
Bacchetti admits that most of the
programming done by his office "tends to be
somewhat conservative ... they are usually
things which complement academic
programming."
Student member Mason Blacher said, "I've
lobbied for University support for
student-initiated theater and drama for one
and a half >ears."
Education Prof. Robert Textor said he too
pushed for mixed offerings.
Blacher blames financial hangups rather
than Bacchetti for the Public Events failings.
"The University recognizes him when he
brings quartets and outside talents rather than
when he helps ... University groups."
Bacon points out that it is the
responsibility of students on the committee
"to have some commitment." He said
students on the committee should frequently
poll the student body, "something we haven't
done."
One student member who did consider
himself effective was ASSU Special Events
Director Dan Scher.
Scher said he was "instrumental" in
scheduling several jazz concerts on campus
next year.

Bacon said he tried to establish a Black
Cultural program next year but Bacchetti said
Bacon's proposals were not all accepted
"because of our financial responsibility to the
University."
C-15: A Virtual Standoff
An unusual milieu of intra-committee
non-cooperation has developed in the
Committee of 15 (C-15), the
faculty-student-administration panel to revise
the student judicial system.
According to two student members,
backlash among faculty members against the
defeat of the C-15 proposal last October has
resulted in a standoff between two sides of
the group.
"They [faculty] felt generous over the
October proposal," said student member
Philip Whistler. The faculty didn't want to
drag along work on a proposal for the entire
year, Whistler said.
The October proposal was overwhelmingly

defeated by students after some key student
members of the C-15 opposed it, claiming that
student judicial rights were not guaranteed.
Whistler said, "There was a standoff in last
year's [October] scheme." He said both sides
had made significant compromises in order to
reach an agreement, and submitted the
proposal because they "thought it was the
best we could get" under the prevailing
circumstances.
The major problem with the C-15 this year
was "too little time to formulate new
proposals" after the October defeat, according
to student member David Herst. Only two
C-15 meetings were held this year.
Student members of the C-15 recently have
proposed a new judicial plan which would
establish a faculty "buffer zone" in judicial
proceedings between students and the
administration.
Under the plan, an all-student panel would
make judicial recommendations to the dean of
students. If he disagreed with them, a separate
faculty board would take up the matter. Its
decision would have to be approved by the
University president.
Herst noted some urgency in the proposal.
He said the present Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) is not a big issue anymore, and"the
ionger you wait [in proposing a new system]
the more legitimate the CJP becomes."
"The judicial system as it now stands is fair
and very efficient and I see no pressure for
change," Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a former
C-15 member, told the Daily April 9.
Business Prof. Harold Leavitt, however,
said in the same issue that "what is really
needed is for students to put forward new
proposals because the faculty and
administration probably won't put forward
anything new." Leavitt is returning to the
C-15 next year.
Whistler felt that extended terms for
student members of C-15 were not necessary.
"It is a good idea to get new people involved
because the older members can get into
terrible ruts," he said.
Faculty Quiet On COSS
A similar schism, though well below the
surface and not manifesting itself publicly,
may affect the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS).
COSS is charged by the University
president to look into areas of student life,

including residences and campus
organizations.
Most agree that faculty input on COSS has
been limited, primarily because the issues the
committee confronts are of little interest to
faculty members. One of three on the
eight-person committee, Asst. Chemistry Prof.
Hans C. Andersen, says, "For the kinds of
things we talked about this year, I can't see
how it [faculty input] was useful."
Other ills afflict COSS, the only University
committee with a student chairman and
student majority. Chairman Bill Rifkin says of
the committee's charge, which requires at
least two meetings per quarter, "We haven't
been living up to it at all."
Now meeting more regularly, COSS has
been involved in revision of the housing draw,
formulation of a report on the need for new

undergraduate housing and establishment of
provisions for selection of residence staffs,
according to Rifkin.
Dealings between the housing office and
COSS bring to light another major drawback
of the committee: adequate representation of
students. Rifkin says "blame was put in the
wrong place" when some students voiced
objections to the transfer of the black theme
house from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia in April.
Rifkin and Andersen agree that the reputed
lack of student input prior to the decision was
the fault of the committee, not Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton. "The
problem isn't between the housing office and
the committee," Rifkin says, "but between
the committee and the student body."
"Five students aren't representative of the
entire student body," Rifkin says. "We have
been blinded to certain issues." Among them
are those involving minorities: COSS' students
are all white.
The main problem with COSS, however,
remains its faculty input. "I haven't been
entirely happy with it,"says chairman Rifkin.
He hastens to add that faculty members on
COSS haven't been uncooperative, but that
schedule conflicts allow them "limited
availability."
These conflicts include simultaneous
P'aculty Senate meetings for two members and
frequent out-of-town trips by the third,
Electrical Engineering Prof. O.G. Villard, who
attended his first meeting May 1.
Another hindrance is the alienation some
faculty members feel toward the business of
COSS. "I found myself not saying too much,"
says Andersen. "Most of the topics seemed
primarily of concern to students."
Andersen is not sure more faculty input is
desirable. Given the nature of COSS, "it's not
obvious you'd want to" increase such input,
he says. "There's no reason to solicit more
faculty input for the issues we had this year."
CEEW: A Woman's Year
"This was the year of the woman student
here," according to senior Barbara Brown,
student member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
The committee's charter states that its
duties include the "improvement of
educational and occupational opportunities"
here and the development of "avenues for
increasing [the number of) women faculty
members."
CEEW succeeded in getting the student
affairs office to establish a "women's
advocate" and persuading the provost's office
to fund a study on the education of women at
Stanford, to be completed next year.
Still, said Brown, "we could have done a
lot more." Problems with the committee
chairmanship marred CEEW's year.
The committee did show several strengths,
according to its members. "We were a
cohesive group this year," said Brown. Most
members of CEEW are women activists, and
disputes concerning goals were rare.
CEEW avoids a problem of other
committees: disinterested members. Graduate
student Barbara Glenn noted this problem,
saying many faculty members "are often
reluctant to serve on a committee." But, she
added, "we had a bunch this year who were
intensely interested in the issues."
Student members, however, have been"the
guiding force of the committee," according to
Amy Metcalfe, assistant to the provost. Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams agreed:
"The women students played as great, or an
even greater role, than the other members."
CEEW lacked a strong leader for much of
the year. "We would often meet and throw
out ideas, but you really need someone to
sum things up, narrow the focus so you can
begin to act on an issue," said Brown.
Metcalfe, who served as acting chairwoman
for the first two quarters, said, "We fell apart
after winter quarter this year." She blamed
the demise on "poor planning in changing the
chairmanship in the middle of the year."
Asst. English Prof. Diane Middlebrook was
appointed to a two-year term as chairwoman in
the fall of last year. She was on leave,
however, until this April, and has not yet
become active in CEEW. The committee met
only once this quarter.
Middlebrook said she was appointed to
CEEW "against my better judgment. I accept
working on committees as part of my job at
Stanford." She thought the committee ran

smoothly this year because "the personalities
were harmonious and cooperative," but sees a
"complete turnover in membership next year"
when she will begin her first year as an active
chairwoman.
Former ASSU Vice President and member
Beth Garfield disagreed with the concept of
committees most widely held in the
University, that of an adviser. She saw the
committee's proper role as "putting pressure
on the appropriate decision-maker."
Garfield wants to change the committee's
focus next year. "Probably too much
emphasis was placed on the students' position
this year," she said. "We really need to take
up staff issues next year."
Metcalfe, however, didn't share Garfield's
concern.
Thus CEEW may be faced with its first

intra-committee dispute which would disturb
the present homogeneity of membership.
CUS: Inhibited Students
Charged by the Academic Council to
formulate "policies governing the structure of
the undergraduate curriculum," changes in
degree programs and the academic advising
system, the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has been quite active, according
to many of its members. Some student
delegates to CUS, however, apparently have
remained dormant.
CUS' accomplishments for 1973-74 are
apparently many, though few are tangible. Its
central problem rests with student
involvement: only three of its 10 members,
CUS' charge dictates, may be undergraduate
students. The remainder are from the
Academic Council, and the resulting
dominance prompted one of the student
members, Betty Muth, to comment, "I always
had the feeling I wasn't being taken seriously
by some faculty on the committee."
An inspection of the minutes of CUS' first
14 meetings this year indicates a dominance
of contributions by faculty members. It
reveals a startling fact: except for an exchange
on the policies of the ASSU Nominations
Committee at CUS' first meeting, student
member and now-ASSU President Mike
Herman had not made a single recorded
contribution to CUS meetings until the one of
May 8.
"[Herman| is not a frequent contributor,"
says Dean of Undergra'duate Studies James
Gibbs, an ex-officio member of CUS. But,
Gibbs says, "when Herman does
[contribute], it's something valuable."
CUS Chairman Richard A. Brody, assistant
professor of political science, agreed with
Gibbs. "Herman is a solid guy. He doesn't say
much but when he does it's something good."
"Word for jvord, I myself don't contribute
as much as some members," Herman admits.
But, he says, "my contribution has been as
great as the other students' [Betty Muth and
Tom Wattles]
Muth disagrees, "I don't think either one
of the guys contributes very much. There's
many meetings where he [Herman] doesn't
say anything."
Herman attributes his lack of mention in
CUS minutes to a subconscious bias in favor
of faculty members on the part of committee
secretary Alice Supton. He said he found
"most upsetting" the dearth of student
comments in the minutes.
Supton admits, "It might be that
unconsciously I didn't pay attention to
students." However, she insists her minutes
"pretty much do" reflect the relative
contributions. "I just found that Mike didn't
say as much."
Imagined or not, Herman's
non-contribution reflects a major concern of
CUS: the amount and worth of student input.
"It's variable," Gibbs says of student input.
"There are some issues students are not
interested in."
"The students are pretty general
contributors ... an important part of the
system," says chairman Brody.
Muth paints a less rosy picture. "The
problem is that faculty are reluctant to
change. They use the committee as an
instrument to define what we already have."
"The main problem [for students] is
continuity," says Gibbs. It takes one quarter
for them to learn how it [committee]
operates."
Muth strongly agrees: "Student
appointments [now one year] should be
longer," she says. "This year I've just gotten a
taste."
Investigation Summary
These seven committees can be taken to
represent the committee system in
microcosm. From their cases, a number of
problems stand out:
—Some faculty serve on committees only
as part of what they consider an "unwritten
obligation." Others serve by their own
request, and seem to become more involved
(as on CEEW) rather than disinterested (as on
COSS).
—Faculty attendance is often spotty. When
Faculty Senate members serve on committees
as well, schedule conflicts often arise. And
faculty members often find it difficult to
attach the same importance to committee
memberships that they do to their classes.
—Student views are sometimes given short
shrift. On CUS, for example, student members
perceive that their contributions are valued
less than those of faculty members. On
CEEW, on the other hand, faculty members'
active interest in student views — and greater
initiative and effort on the part of student
members — have proved effective.
—Committees intended as policy-setting
groups often defer to the "superior
knowledge" of the administrators they are
supposed to oversee. As a result, committees
often act solely on administrators'
recommendations — instead of undertaking
more independent deliberations.
—Faculty are currently given three-year
terms, while students are generally limited to
one year. In committees of a continuing
nature, such as C-US and C-UAFA, this
limitation hampers student input.
—While the ASSU currently requires
student committee members to file reports of
their performance, the Academic Council does
not request such reports. The
"accountability" of all committee members is
unclear.
—Committee meetings are not open to
effective press coverage. Confidentiality is
important to some committees (such as C-15),
but student and faculty skepticism of secret
deliberations may hamper input. Greater
monitoring and publicity might help both
student and faculty members to be more
effective.
Next year, the ASSU Council of Presidents
plans to assign a student staff assistant to each
committee's student members. ASSU
President Mike Herman says "better liaison
between student government and students on
committees" will result from the posts.

MASON BLACHER BARBARA BROWN MIKE HERMAN
A year for financial hangups, a women's advocate and "upsetting" minutes.
"You can't hold a committee responsible
for a decision," says Assoc. Dean of Student
. iffairs Dan Williams.
But the Stanford administration, faculty
and Board of Trustees hold these groups
responsible for something, and usually it's
called "input." Together they've set up 48
different committees that contain student
members, and such groups are virtually the
only means a student has of "inputting" into
vhe decisions that shape his university.
Three major types of committees exist
here: those impaneled by the University
president, usually under the eye of an
ex-officio member who is a part of the
administration; those of the Academic
Council, governing body of the faculty (these
contain a minority of student members
and a majority from the Council); and those
of the trustees, whose minutes and
deliberations are confidential.
Just what are these committees
accomplishing, and how effective are the
students who serve on them? To find out, the
Daily has conducted an in-depth investigation
of seven committees it believes representative
of the system. No trustee committee is
included; their records are not open to the
press.
Points explored in this investigation
include the amount — and quality — of
student and faculty input; student and faculty
interest, as reflected in attendance records;
the question of possible dominance of a
committee by the official it is intended to
advise; committee harmony and conflicts;
and, finally, the accountability of committee
members to those they represent.
The investigation has revealed that
although participation on committees has
often been inadequate, some committees
stand as monuments to how change in the
University can be achieved by "going through
channels."
C-UAFA: Power Unused
Though most University committees are
admittedly only advisory bodies to an
administrator in their area, the charge of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (C-UAFA) empowers this group
to make certain "determinations."
Among these are the content of application
forms, the number of students to be admitted,
requirements for admission (and exceptions to
these), standards for establishing priority for
financial aid and the types of aid available.
Despite being blessed with such unusual
power, committee members apparently are
not taking advantage of their position. The
reason, in the words of student member
Michael Jennings, is that "[Dean of
Admissions Fred] Hargadon seems to run
things." Committee chairman Paul Green,
professor of biological sciences, said,
"Hargadon influences the committee most.
He's more informed."
Assoc. Physics Prof. Alexander Fetter
agreed that Hargadon "is generally persuasive.
The commiuoe seems to agree with
Hargadon."
Quinn Mayer, student member and now
ASSU vice president, stated, "The committee
is an advisory panel to Dean Hargadon."
Praise for both Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff was nearly
unanimous among C-UAFA members. Some
didn't feel Hargadon's domination of meetings
was detrimental.
"Dean Hargadon will accept a student's
opinion if it is intelligent enough," said
student member Carmen Logan.
Huff said although C-UAFA members "are
not, in effect, running the office . . . they
determine what type of students should be at
Stanford and make sure they can come here
once accepted. We have to follow their
recommendations."
In Mayer's words, Hargadon "is the one
who has access to all the materials and
relevant data."
"I'm expected to know more about
admissions," said Hargadon, pointing out that
committees are only extra-curricular duties
for their members. "Should something go
wrong at an operational level, it's my
responsibility. You don't fire teachers or
expel students for a mistake they make on a
committee."
Some C-UAFA members are unable to
contribute significantly because they lack
expertise. "Those with tenure seem to know a
lot more," said Logan. "There's a definite
disadvantage of students having only
one-year terms." (Mayer is the only
two-termer.)
Meetings often plod along on a fixed
course. "The committee could be more
effective if . . . it didn't stick to such a rigid
agenda," said Logan.
"There is some frustration when things
move slowly and things don't get discussed,"
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel said.
In trying to counter this, Mayer has
found that "we [students J got much more
done when we met with Hargadon
separately."
Official meetings are infrequent. C-UAFA's
charge requires six meetings per year, and the
committee met only that many times.
Huff and Mayer both called for more
meetings. Fetter said, however, that he would
be "much less willing to serve on the
committee if it met too often. 1 have other
obligations within my department."
According to Siegel, "the chairman
[Green j is reluctant to overwork people."
SWOPSI: United Battle
While C-UAFA tends to rely on Hargadon
in deference to his position, the members of
the SWOPSI Policy Board are supportive of
program director Dan Lewis for a d.ifferent
reason: SWOPSI's continuing fight ? for
autonomy.
Student member Chris Elms called Lewis
"clearly the dominant force on the Board."
Faculty members respect Lewis, Elms said,
because he knows a lot about the program's
courses, and students respect him because
they know he has fought for the program for
years. (Lewis has been director since
SWOPSI's inception in 1969, but is resigning
this August.)

Although faculty members contribute far
more than the students, Elms attributed that
to agreement, not intimidation.
Elms, student chairperson Chris Baron and
another student complimented the faculty
members 011 their assistance to students, and
recognized the need for it. Said Elms, "If this
were I only] a student committee, it wouldn't
mean a thing. Students in this university don't
have a clout."
Baron noted that faculty members are
helpful in contributing a realistic view of how
much can be taught in one quarter when the
Board is discussing courses.
Academic standards for courses are the
only significant area of disagreement on this
otherwise united committee. A few members,
such as Elms, feel the Board "worries
sometimes too much whether something has
'sufficient academic rigor,' " thus discouraging
students from teaching courses. But pressure
from the administration has led to tightened
criteria.

Although the Board's main job is approving
courses, it has spent much of its time haggling

traditionally used for the program, had dried

C-15: A Virtual Standoff
An unusual milieu of intra-committee
non-cooperation has developed in the

anything new." Leavitt is returning to the
C-15 next year.
Whistler felt that extended terms for
student members of C-15 were not necessary.
"It is a good idea to get new people involved
because the older members can get into
terrible ruts," he said.
Faculty Quiet On COSS
A similar schism, though well below the
surface and not manifesting itself publicly,
may affect the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS).
COSS is charged by the University
president to look into areas of student life,

including residences and campus
organizations.
Most agree that faculty input on COSS has
been limited, primarily because the issues the
committee confronts are of little interest to
faculty members. One of three on the
eight-person committee, Asst. Chemistry Prof.
Hans C. Andersen, says, "For the kinds of
things we talked about this year, I can't see
how it [faculty input] was useful."
Other ills afflict COSS, the only University
committee with a student chairman and
student majority. Chairman Bill Rifkin says of
the committee's charge, which requires at
least two meetings per quarter, "We haven't
been living up to it at all."
Now meeting more regularly, COSS has
been involved in revision of the housing draw,
formulation of a report on the need for new

undergraduate housing and establishment of
provisions for selection of residence staffs,
according to Rifkin.
Dealings between the housing office and
COSS bring to light another major drawback
of the committee: adequate representation of
students. Rifkin says "blame was put in the
wrong place" when some students voiced
objections to the transfer of the black theme
house from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia in April.
Rifkin and Andersen agree that the reputed
lack of student input prior to the decision was
the fault of the committee, not Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton. "The
problem isn't between the housing office and
the committee," Rifkin says, "but between
the committee and the student body."
"Five students aren't representative of the
entire student body," Rifkin says. "We have
been blinded to certain issues." Among them
are those involving minorities: COSS' students
are all white.
The main problem with COSS, however,
remains its faculty input. "I haven't been
entirely happy with it,"says chairman Rifkin.
He hastens to add that faculty members on
COSS haven't been uncooperative, but that
schedule conflicts allow them "limited
availability."
These conflicts include simultaneous
P'aculty Senate meetings for two members and
frequent out-of-town trips by the third,
Electrical Engineering Prof. O.G. Villard, who
attended his first meeting May 1.
Another hindrance is the alienation some
faculty members feel toward the business of
COSS. "I found myself not saying too much,"
says Andersen. "Most of the topics seemed
primarily of concern to students."
Andersen is not sure more faculty input is
desirable. Given the nature of COSS, "it's not
obvious you'd want to" increase such input,
he says. "There's no reason to solicit more
faculty input for the issues we had this year."
CEEW: A Woman's Year
"This was the year of the woman student
here," according to senior Barbara Brown,
student member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
The committee's charter states that its
duties include the "improvement of
educational and occupational opportunities"
here and the development of "avenues for
increasing [the number of) women faculty
members."
CEEW succeeded in getting the student
affairs office to establish a "women's
advocate" and persuading the provost's office
to fund a study on the education of women at
Stanford, to be completed next year.
Still, said Brown, "we could have done a
lot more." Problems with the committee
chairmanship marred CEEW's year.
The committee did show several strengths,
according to its members. "We were a
cohesive group this year," said Brown. Most
members of CEEW are women activists, and
disputes concerning goals were rare.
CEEW avoids a problem of other
committees: disinterested members. Graduate
student Barbara Glenn noted this problem,
saying many faculty members "are often
reluctant to serve on a committee." But, she
added, "we had a bunch this year who were
intensely interested in the issues."
Student members, however, have been"the
guiding force of the committee," according to
Amy Metcalfe, assistant to the provost. Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams agreed:
"The women students played as great, or an
even greater role, than the other members."
CEEW lacked a strong leader for much of
the year. "We would often meet and throw
out ideas, but you really need someone to
sum things up, narrow the focus so you can
begin to act on an issue," said Brown.
Metcalfe, who served as acting chairwoman
for the first two quarters, said, "We fell apart
after winter quarter this year." She blamed
the demise on "poor planning in changing the
chairmanship in the middle of the year."
Asst. English Prof. Diane Middlebrook was
appointed to a two-year term as chairwoman in
the fall of last year. She was on leave,
however, until this April, and has not yet
become active in CEEW. The committee met
only once this quarter.
Middlebrook said she was appointed to
CEEW "against my better judgment. I accept
working on committees as part of my job at
Stanford." She thought the committee ran

smoothly this year because "the personalities
were harmonious and cooperative," but sees a
"complete turnover in membership next year"
when she will begin her first year as an active
chairwoman.
Former ASSU Vice President and member
Beth Garfield disagreed with the concept of
committees most widely held in the
University, that of an adviser. She saw the
committee's proper role as "putting pressure
on the appropriate decision-maker."
Garfield wants to change the committee's
focus next year. "Probably too much
emphasis was placed on the students' position
this year," she said. "We really need to take
up staff issues next year."
Metcalfe, however, didn't share Garfield's
concern.
Thus CEEW may be faced with its first

intra-committee dispute which would disturb
the present homogeneity of membership.
CUS: Inhibited Students
Charged by the Academic Council to
formulate "policies governing the structure of
the undergraduate curriculum," changes in
degree programs and the academic advising
system, the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has been quite active, according
to many of its members. Some student
delegates to CUS, however, apparently have
remained dormant.
CUS' accomplishments for 1973-74 are
apparently many, though few are tangible. Its
central problem rests with student
involvement: only three of its 10 members,
CUS' charge dictates, may be undergraduate
students. The remainder are from the
Academic Council, and the resulting
dominance prompted one of the student
members, Betty Muth, to comment, "I always
had the feeling I wasn't being taken seriously
by some faculty on the committee."
An inspection of the minutes of CUS' first
14 meetings this year indicates a dominance
of contributions by faculty members. It
reveals a startling fact: except for an exchange
on the policies of the ASSU Nominations
Committee at CUS' first meeting, student
member and now-ASSU President Mike
Herman had not made a single recorded
contribution to CUS meetings until the one of
May 8.
"[Herman| is not a frequent contributor,"
says Dean of Undergra'duate Studies James
Gibbs, an ex-officio member of CUS. But,
Gibbs says, "when Herman does
[contribute], it's something valuable."
CUS Chairman Richard A. Brody, assistant
professor of political science, agreed with
Gibbs. "Herman is a solid guy. He doesn't say
much but when he does it's something good."
"Word for jvord, I myself don't contribute
as much as some members," Herman admits.
But, he says, "my contribution has been as
great as the other students' [Betty Muth and
Tom Wattles]
Muth disagrees, "I don't think either one
of the guys contributes very much. There's
many meetings where he [Herman] doesn't
say anything."
Herman attributes his lack of mention in
CUS minutes to a subconscious bias in favor
of faculty members on the part of committee
secretary Alice Supton. He said he found
"most upsetting" the dearth of student
comments in the minutes.
Supton admits, "It might be that
unconsciously I didn't pay attention to
students." However, she insists her minutes
"pretty much do" reflect the relative
contributions. "I just found that Mike didn't
say as much."
Imagined or not, Herman's
non-contribution reflects a major concern of
CUS: the amount and worth of student input.
"It's variable," Gibbs says of student input.
"There are some issues students are not
interested in."
"The students are pretty general
contributors ... an important part of the
system," says chairman Brody.
Muth paints a less rosy picture. "The
problem is that faculty are reluctant to
change. They use the committee as an
instrument to define what we already have."
"The main problem [for students] is
continuity," says Gibbs. It takes one quarter
for them to learn how it [committee]
operates."
Muth strongly agrees: "Student
appointments [now one year] should be
longer," she says. "This year I've just gotten a
taste."
Investigation Summary
These seven committees can be taken to
represent the committee system in
microcosm. From their cases, a number of
problems stand out:
—Some faculty serve on committees only
as part of what they consider an "unwritten
obligation." Others serve by their own
request, and seem to become more involved
(as on CEEW) rather than disinterested (as on
COSS).
—Faculty attendance is often spotty. When
Faculty Senate members serve on committees
as well, schedule conflicts often arise. And
faculty members often find it difficult to
attach the same importance to committee
memberships that they do to their classes.
—Student views are sometimes given short
shrift. On CUS, for example, student members
perceive that their contributions are valued
less than those of faculty members. On
CEEW, on the other hand, faculty members'
active interest in student views — and greater
initiative and effort on the part of student
members — have proved effective.
—Committees intended as policy-setting
groups often defer to the "superior
knowledge" of the administrators they are
supposed to oversee. As a result, committees
often act solely on administrators'
recommendations — instead of undertaking
more independent deliberations.
—Faculty are currently given three-year
terms, while students are generally limited to
one year. In committees of a continuing
nature, such as C-US and C-UAFA, this
limitation hampers student input.
—While the ASSU currently requires
student committee members to file reports of
their performance, the Academic Council does
not request such reports. The
"accountability" of all committee members is
unclear.
—Committee meetings are not open to
effective press coverage. Confidentiality is
important to some committees (such as C-15),
but student and faculty skepticism of secret
deliberations may hamper input. Greater
monitoring and publicity might help both
student and faculty members to be more
effective.
Next year, the ASSU Council of Presidents
plans to assign a student staff assistant to each
committee's student members. ASSU
President Mike Herman says "better liaison
between student government and students on
committees" will result from the posts.

MASON BLACHER BARBARA BROWN MIKE HERMAN
A year for financial hangups, a women's advocate and "upsetting" minutes.
"You can't hold a committee responsible
for a decision," says Assoc. Dean of Student
. iffairs Dan Williams.
But the Stanford administration, faculty
and Board of Trustees hold these groups
responsible for something, and usually it's
called "input." Together they've set up 48
different committees that contain student
members, and such groups are virtually the
only means a student has of "inputting" into
vhe decisions that shape his university.
Three major types of committees exist
here: those impaneled by the University
president, usually under the eye of an
ex-officio member who is a part of the
administration; those of the Academic
Council, governing body of the faculty (these
contain a minority of student members
and a majority from the Council); and those
of the trustees, whose minutes and
deliberations are confidential.
Just what are these committees
accomplishing, and how effective are the
students who serve on them? To find out, the
Daily has conducted an in-depth investigation
of seven committees it believes representative
of the system. No trustee committee is
included; their records are not open to the
press.
Points explored in this investigation
include the amount — and quality — of
student and faculty input; student and faculty
interest, as reflected in attendance records;
the question of possible dominance of a
committee by the official it is intended to
advise; committee harmony and conflicts;
and, finally, the accountability of committee
members to those they represent.
The investigation has revealed that
although participation on committees has
often been inadequate, some committees
stand as monuments to how change in the
University can be achieved by "going through
channels."
C-UAFA: Power Unused
Though most University committees are
admittedly only advisory bodies to an
administrator in their area, the charge of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (C-UAFA) empowers this group
to make certain "determinations."
Among these are the content of application
forms, the number of students to be admitted,
requirements for admission (and exceptions to
these), standards for establishing priority for
financial aid and the types of aid available.
Despite being blessed with such unusual
power, committee members apparently are
not taking advantage of their position. The
reason, in the words of student member
Michael Jennings, is that "[Dean of
Admissions Fred] Hargadon seems to run
things." Committee chairman Paul Green,
professor of biological sciences, said,
"Hargadon influences the committee most.
He's more informed."
Assoc. Physics Prof. Alexander Fetter
agreed that Hargadon "is generally persuasive.
The commiuoe seems to agree with
Hargadon."
Quinn Mayer, student member and now
ASSU vice president, stated, "The committee
is an advisory panel to Dean Hargadon."
Praise for both Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff was nearly
unanimous among C-UAFA members. Some
didn't feel Hargadon's domination of meetings
was detrimental.
"Dean Hargadon will accept a student's
opinion if it is intelligent enough," said
student member Carmen Logan.
Huff said although C-UAFA members "are
not, in effect, running the office . . . they
determine what type of students should be at
Stanford and make sure they can come here
once accepted. We have to follow their
recommendations."
In Mayer's words, Hargadon "is the one
who has access to all the materials and
relevant data."
"I'm expected to know more about
admissions," said Hargadon, pointing out that
committees are only extra-curricular duties
for their members. "Should something go
wrong at an operational level, it's my
responsibility. You don't fire teachers or
expel students for a mistake they make on a
committee."
Some C-UAFA members are unable to
contribute significantly because they lack
expertise. "Those with tenure seem to know a
lot more," said Logan. "There's a definite
disadvantage of students having only
one-year terms." (Mayer is the only
two-termer.)
Meetings often plod along on a fixed
course. "The committee could be more
effective if . . . it didn't stick to such a rigid
agenda," said Logan.
"There is some frustration when things
move slowly and things don't get discussed,"
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel said.
In trying to counter this, Mayer has
found that "we [students J got much more
done when we met with Hargadon
separately."
Official meetings are infrequent. C-UAFA's
charge requires six meetings per year, and the
committee met only that many times.
Huff and Mayer both called for more
meetings. Fetter said, however, that he would
be "much less willing to serve on the
committee if it met too often. 1 have other
obligations within my department."
According to Siegel, "the chairman
[Green j is reluctant to overwork people."
SWOPSI: United Battle
While C-UAFA tends to rely on Hargadon
in deference to his position, the members of
the SWOPSI Policy Board are supportive of
program director Dan Lewis for a d.ifferent
reason: SWOPSI's continuing fight ? for
autonomy.
Student member Chris Elms called Lewis
"clearly the dominant force on the Board."
Faculty members respect Lewis, Elms said,
because he knows a lot about the program's
courses, and students respect him because
they know he has fought for the program for
years. (Lewis has been director since
SWOPSI's inception in 1969, but is resigning
this August.)

Although faculty members contribute far
more than the students, Elms attributed that
to agreement, not intimidation.
Elms, student chairperson Chris Baron and
another student complimented the faculty
members 011 their assistance to students, and
recognized the need for it. Said Elms, "If this
were I only] a student committee, it wouldn't
mean a thing. Students in this university don't
have a clout."
Baron noted that faculty members are
helpful in contributing a realistic view of how
much can be taught in one quarter when the
Board is discussing courses.
Academic standards for courses are the
only significant area of disagreement on this
otherwise united committee. A few members,
such as Elms, feel the Board "worries
sometimes too much whether something has
'sufficient academic rigor,' " thus discouraging
students from teaching courses. But pressure
from the administration has led to tightened
criteria.

Although the Board's main job is approving
courses, it has spent much of its time haggling
with Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs over funds and policies.
Elms expressed concern over what he saw
as the dean's apparent tendency to regard
SWOPSI- as a "proving-ground" for
departmental courses. English Prof. William
Chace, another Board member, said the
program is just "too anarchistic, too sloppy,
too unruly" for Gibbs.
Gibbs has proposed merging SWOPSI with
the Undergraduate Specials program, a
proposal the Board has fought vehemently.
In addition, the dean informed the Board
April 30 that SWOPSI funding for next year
was in question because his reserve funds,
traditionally used for the program, had dried
up. As an economy move, Gibbs also
proposed that full-time staffer Merlyn Payne's
job be reduced to four hours per day; the
Board has opposed this move as well.
Some members have begun to doubt the
Board's effectiveness in the long run and
many have viewed their role in accordance
with Lewis' motto — "Dare to struggle, dare
to stalemate."
Public Events: Yes Men?
The Committee on Public Events appears
to suffer, too, from a dependency on the
administrator whom it oversees. Of 11
committee members the four students and
four faculty do appear to contribute equally
and substantially, but the whole committee's
role in bringing public events to campus is
limited.
According to the 1971 public events policy
manual, the committee "govern[sj all
non-academic, non-athletic programs which
are held ... on University property and which
are open to the public or to all students. . ."
Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti said
the specifics of these performances are carried
out mainly by his office. The primary duty 0/
the committee, he said, is "policy setting not
programming."
Student member 800 Bacon said of the
committee, "It does fulfill public events that a
lot of students are concerned about, but
authority is vested in Tom Bacchetti. He is
capable but his taste can't possibly reflect the
whole Stanford community."
"The committee is just a rubber stamp
committee — it doesn't do much," said
student member Mary Lou Johnson.
A review of the committee minutes shows
that recent business consisted mostly of
reports by Bacchetti.
"We run this institution on an advocacy
system," said Bacchetti. "If somebody can
make a case I'm more than receptive and if
I'm persuaded I'll do it, but we're not going to
overreact to some ideas which aren't fully
realized yet."
"We only appeal to one segment of the
community," said Bacon. "Bacchetti is open
but he's going to go ahead and do what he'll
do unless you can make it [a proposal] seem
solid."
Bacchetti admits that most of the
programming done by his office "tends to be
somewhat conservative ... they are usually
things which complement academic
programming."
Student member Mason Blacher said, "I've
lobbied for University support for
student-initiated theater and drama for one
and a half >ears."
Education Prof. Robert Textor said he too
pushed for mixed offerings.
Blacher blames financial hangups rather
than Bacchetti for the Public Events failings.
"The University recognizes him when he
brings quartets and outside talents rather than
when he helps ... University groups."
Bacon points out that it is the
responsibility of students on the committee
"to have some commitment." He said
students on the committee should frequently
poll the student body, "something we haven't
done."
One student member who did consider
himself effective was ASSU Special Events
Director Dan Scher.
Scher said he was "instrumental" in
scheduling several jazz concerts on campus
next year.

Bacon said he tried to establish a Black
Cultural program next year but Bacchetti said
Bacon's proposals were not all accepted
"because of our financial responsibility to the
University."
C-15: A Virtual Standoff
An unusual milieu of intra-committee
non-cooperation has developed in the
Committee of 15 (C-15), the
faculty-student-administration panel to revise
the student judicial system.
According to two student members,
backlash among faculty members against the
defeat of the C-15 proposal last October has
resulted in a standoff between two sides of
the group.
"They [faculty] felt generous over the
October proposal," said student member
Philip Whistler. The faculty didn't want to
drag along work on a proposal for the entire
year, Whistler said.
The October proposal was overwhelmingly

defeated by students after some key student
members of the C-15 opposed it, claiming that
student judicial rights were not guaranteed.
Whistler said, "There was a standoff in last
year's [October] scheme." He said both sides
had made significant compromises in order to
reach an agreement, and submitted the
proposal because they "thought it was the
best we could get" under the prevailing
circumstances.
The major problem with the C-15 this year
was "too little time to formulate new
proposals" after the October defeat, according
to student member David Herst. Only two
C-15 meetings were held this year.
Student members of the C-15 recently have
proposed a new judicial plan which would
establish a faculty "buffer zone" in judicial
proceedings between students and the
administration.
Under the plan, an all-student panel would
make judicial recommendations to the dean of
students. If he disagreed with them, a separate
faculty board would take up the matter. Its
decision would have to be approved by the
University president.
Herst noted some urgency in the proposal.
He said the present Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) is not a big issue anymore, and"the
ionger you wait [in proposing a new system]
the more legitimate the CJP becomes."
"The judicial system as it now stands is fair
and very efficient and I see no pressure for
change," Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a former
C-15 member, told the Daily April 9.
Business Prof. Harold Leavitt, however,
said in the same issue that "what is really
needed is for students to put forward new
proposals because the faculty and
administration probably won't put forward
anything new." Leavitt is returning to the
C-15 next year.
Whistler felt that extended terms for
student members of C-15 were not necessary.
"It is a good idea to get new people involved
because the older members can get into
terrible ruts," he said.

surface and not manifesting itself publicly,

"[Herman| is not a frequent contributor,"
says Dean of Undergra'duate Studies James
Gibbs, an ex-officio member of CUS. But,
Gibbs says, "when Herman does
[contribute], it's something valuable."
CUS Chairman Richard A. Brody, assistant
professor of political science, agreed with
Gibbs. "Herman is a solid guy. He doesn't say
much but when he does it's something good."
"Word for jvord, I myself don't contribute
as much as some members," Herman admits.
But, he says, "my contribution has been as
great as the other students' [Betty Muth and
Tom Wattles]
Muth disagrees, "I don't think either one
of the guys contributes very much. There's
many meetings where he [Herman] doesn't
say anything."
Herman attributes his lack of mention in
CUS minutes to a subconscious bias in favor
of faculty members on the part of committee
secretary Alice Supton. He said he found
"most upsetting" the dearth of student
comments in the minutes.
Supton admits, "It might be that
unconsciously I didn't pay attention to
students." However, she insists her minutes
"pretty much do" reflect the relative
contributions. "I just found that Mike didn't
say as much."
Imagined or not, Herman's
non-contribution reflects a major concern of
CUS: the amount and worth of student input.
"It's variable," Gibbs says of student input.
"There are some issues students are not
interested in."
"The students are pretty general
contributors ... an important part of the
system," says chairman Brody.
Muth paints a less rosy picture. "The
problem is that faculty are reluctant to
change. They use the committee as an
instrument to define what we already have."
"The main problem [for students] is
continuity," says Gibbs. It takes one quarter
for them to learn how it [committee]
operates."
Muth strongly agrees: "Student
appointments [now one year] should be
longer," she says. "This year I've just gotten a
taste."
Investigation Summary
These seven committees can be taken to
represent the committee system in
microcosm. From their cases, a number of
problems stand out:
—Some faculty serve on committees only
as part of what they consider an "unwritten
obligation." Others serve by their own
request, and seem to become more involved
(as on CEEW) rather than disinterested (as on
COSS).
—Faculty attendance is often spotty. When
Faculty Senate members serve on committees
as well, schedule conflicts often arise. And
faculty members often find it difficult to
attach the same importance to committee
memberships that they do to their classes.
—Student views are sometimes given short
shrift. On CUS, for example, student members
perceive that their contributions are valued
less than those of faculty members. On
CEEW, on the other hand, faculty members'
active interest in student views — and greater
initiative and effort on the part of student
members — have proved effective.
—Committees intended as policy-setting
groups often defer to the "superior
knowledge" of the administrators they are
supposed to oversee. As a result, committees
often act solely on administrators'
recommendations — instead of undertaking
more independent deliberations.
—Faculty are currently given three-year
terms, while students are generally limited to
one year. In committees of a continuing
nature, such as C-US and C-UAFA, this
limitation hampers student input.
—While the ASSU currently requires
student committee members to file reports of
their performance, the Academic Council does
not request such reports. The
"accountability" of all committee members is
unclear.
—Committee meetings are not open to
effective press coverage. Confidentiality is
important to some committees (such as C-15),
but student and faculty skepticism of secret
deliberations may hamper input. Greater
monitoring and publicity might help both
student and faculty members to be more
effective.
Next year, the ASSU Council of Presidents
plans to assign a student staff assistant to each
committee's student members. ASSU
President Mike Herman says "better liaison
between student government and students on
committees" will result from the posts.

A year for financial hangups, a women's advocate and "upsetting" minutes.
"You can't hold a committee responsible
for a decision," says Assoc. Dean of Student
. iffairs Dan Williams.
But the Stanford administration, faculty
and Board of Trustees hold these groups
responsible for something, and usually it's
called "input." Together they've set up 48
different committees that contain student
members, and such groups are virtually the
only means a student has of "inputting" into
vhe decisions that shape his university.
Three major types of committees exist
here: those impaneled by the University
president, usually under the eye of an
ex-officio member who is a part of the
administration; those of the Academic
Council, governing body of the faculty (these
contain a minority of student members
and a majority from the Council); and those
of the trustees, whose minutes and
deliberations are confidential.
Just what are these committees
accomplishing, and how effective are the
students who serve on them? To find out, the
Daily has conducted an in-depth investigation
of seven committees it believes representative
of the system. No trustee committee is
included; their records are not open to the
press.
Points explored in this investigation
include the amount — and quality — of
student and faculty input; student and faculty
interest, as reflected in attendance records;
the question of possible dominance of a
committee by the official it is intended to
advise; committee harmony and conflicts;
and, finally, the accountability of committee
members to those they represent.
The investigation has revealed that
although participation on committees has
often been inadequate, some committees
stand as monuments to how change in the
University can be achieved by "going through
channels."
C-UAFA: Power Unused
Though most University committees are
admittedly only advisory bodies to an
administrator in their area, the charge of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (C-UAFA) empowers this group
to make certain "determinations."
Among these are the content of application
forms, the number of students to be admitted,
requirements for admission (and exceptions to
these), standards for establishing priority for
financial aid and the types of aid available.
Despite being blessed with such unusual
power, committee members apparently are
not taking advantage of their position. The
reason, in the words of student member
Michael Jennings, is that "[Dean of
Admissions Fred] Hargadon seems to run
things." Committee chairman Paul Green,
professor of biological sciences, said,
"Hargadon influences the committee most.
He's more informed."
Assoc. Physics Prof. Alexander Fetter
agreed that Hargadon "is generally persuasive.
The commiuoe seems to agree with
Hargadon."
Quinn Mayer, student member and now
ASSU vice president, stated, "The committee
is an advisory panel to Dean Hargadon."
Praise for both Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff was nearly
unanimous among C-UAFA members. Some
didn't feel Hargadon's domination of meetings
was detrimental.
"Dean Hargadon will accept a student's
opinion if it is intelligent enough," said
student member Carmen Logan.
Huff said although C-UAFA members "are
not, in effect, running the office . . . they
determine what type of students should be at
Stanford and make sure they can come here
once accepted. We have to follow their
recommendations."
In Mayer's words, Hargadon "is the one
who has access to all the materials and
relevant data."
"I'm expected to know more about
admissions," said Hargadon, pointing out that
committees are only extra-curricular duties
for their members. "Should something go
wrong at an operational level, it's my
responsibility. You don't fire teachers or
expel students for a mistake they make on a
committee."
Some C-UAFA members are unable to
contribute significantly because they lack
expertise. "Those with tenure seem to know a
lot more," said Logan. "There's a definite
disadvantage of students having only
one-year terms." (Mayer is the only
two-termer.)
Meetings often plod along on a fixed
course. "The committee could be more
effective if . . . it didn't stick to such a rigid
agenda," said Logan.
"There is some frustration when things
move slowly and things don't get discussed,"
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel said.
In trying to counter this, Mayer has
found that "we [students J got much more
done when we met with Hargadon
separately."
Official meetings are infrequent. C-UAFA's
charge requires six meetings per year, and the
committee met only that many times.
Huff and Mayer both called for more
meetings. Fetter said, however, that he would
be "much less willing to serve on the
committee if it met too often. 1 have other
obligations within my department."
According to Siegel, "the chairman
[Green j is reluctant to overwork people."
SWOPSI: United Battle
While C-UAFA tends to rely on Hargadon
in deference to his position, the members of
the SWOPSI Policy Board are supportive of
program director Dan Lewis for a d.ifferent
reason: SWOPSI's continuing fight ? for
autonomy.
Student member Chris Elms called Lewis
"clearly the dominant force on the Board."
Faculty members respect Lewis, Elms said,
because he knows a lot about the program's
courses, and students respect him because
they know he has fought for the program for
years. (Lewis has been director since
SWOPSI's inception in 1969, but is resigning
this August.)

Although faculty members contribute far
more than the students, Elms attributed that
to agreement, not intimidation.
Elms, student chairperson Chris Baron and
another student complimented the faculty
members 011 their assistance to students, and
recognized the need for it. Said Elms, "If this
were I only] a student committee, it wouldn't
mean a thing. Students in this university don't
have a clout."
Baron noted that faculty members are
helpful in contributing a realistic view of how
much can be taught in one quarter when the
Board is discussing courses.
Academic standards for courses are the
only significant area of disagreement on this
otherwise united committee. A few members,
such as Elms, feel the Board "worries
sometimes too much whether something has
'sufficient academic rigor,' " thus discouraging
students from teaching courses. But pressure
from the administration has led to tightened
criteria.

Although the Board's main job is approving
courses, it has spent much of its time haggling
with Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs over funds and policies.
Elms expressed concern over what he saw
as the dean's apparent tendency to regard
SWOPSI- as a "proving-ground" for
departmental courses. English Prof. William
Chace, another Board member, said the
program is just "too anarchistic, too sloppy,
too unruly" for Gibbs.
Gibbs has proposed merging SWOPSI with
the Undergraduate Specials program, a
proposal the Board has fought vehemently.
In addition, the dean informed the Board
April 30 that SWOPSI funding for next year
was in question because his reserve funds,
traditionally used for the program, had dried
up. As an economy move, Gibbs also
proposed that full-time staffer Merlyn Payne's
job be reduced to four hours per day; the
Board has opposed this move as well.
Some members have begun to doubt the
Board's effectiveness in the long run and
many have viewed their role in accordance
with Lewis' motto — "Dare to struggle, dare
to stalemate."
Public Events: Yes Men?
The Committee on Public Events appears
to suffer, too, from a dependency on the
administrator whom it oversees. Of 11
committee members the four students and
four faculty do appear to contribute equally
and substantially, but the whole committee's
role in bringing public events to campus is
limited.
According to the 1971 public events policy
manual, the committee "govern[sj all
non-academic, non-athletic programs which
are held ... on University property and which
are open to the public or to all students. . ."
Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti said
the specifics of these performances are carried
out mainly by his office. The primary duty 0/
the committee, he said, is "policy setting not
programming."
Student member 800 Bacon said of the
committee, "It does fulfill public events that a
lot of students are concerned about, but
authority is vested in Tom Bacchetti. He is
capable but his taste can't possibly reflect the
whole Stanford community."
"The committee is just a rubber stamp
committee — it doesn't do much," said
student member Mary Lou Johnson.
A review of the committee minutes shows
that recent business consisted mostly of
reports by Bacchetti.
"We run this institution on an advocacy
system," said Bacchetti. "If somebody can
make a case I'm more than receptive and if
I'm persuaded I'll do it, but we're not going to
overreact to some ideas which aren't fully
realized yet."
"We only appeal to one segment of the
community," said Bacon. "Bacchetti is open
but he's going to go ahead and do what he'll
do unless you can make it [a proposal] seem
solid."
Bacchetti admits that most of the
programming done by his office "tends to be
somewhat conservative ... they are usually
things which complement academic
programming."
Student member Mason Blacher said, "I've
lobbied for University support for
student-initiated theater and drama for one
and a half >ears."
Education Prof. Robert Textor said he too
pushed for mixed offerings.
Blacher blames financial hangups rather
than Bacchetti for the Public Events failings.
"The University recognizes him when he
brings quartets and outside talents rather than
when he helps ... University groups."
Bacon points out that it is the
responsibility of students on the committee
"to have some commitment." He said
students on the committee should frequently
poll the student body, "something we haven't
done."
One student member who did consider
himself effective was ASSU Special Events
Director Dan Scher.
Scher said he was "instrumental" in
scheduling several jazz concerts on campus
next year.

Bacon said he tried to establish a Black
Cultural program next year but Bacchetti said
Bacon's proposals were not all accepted
"because of our financial responsibility to the
University."
C-15: A Virtual Standoff
An unusual milieu of intra-committee
non-cooperation has developed in the
Committee of 15 (C-15), the
faculty-student-administration panel to revise
the student judicial system.
According to two student members,
backlash among faculty members against the
defeat of the C-15 proposal last October has
resulted in a standoff between two sides of
the group.
"They [faculty] felt generous over the
October proposal," said student member
Philip Whistler. The faculty didn't want to
drag along work on a proposal for the entire
year, Whistler said.
The October proposal was overwhelmingly

defeated by students after some key student
members of the C-15 opposed it, claiming that
student judicial rights were not guaranteed.
Whistler said, "There was a standoff in last
year's [October] scheme." He said both sides
had made significant compromises in order to
reach an agreement, and submitted the
proposal because they "thought it was the
best we could get" under the prevailing
circumstances.
The major problem with the C-15 this year
was "too little time to formulate new
proposals" after the October defeat, according
to student member David Herst. Only two
C-15 meetings were held this year.
Student members of the C-15 recently have
proposed a new judicial plan which would
establish a faculty "buffer zone" in judicial
proceedings between students and the
administration.
Under the plan, an all-student panel would
make judicial recommendations to the dean of
students. If he disagreed with them, a separate
faculty board would take up the matter. Its
decision would have to be approved by the
University president.
Herst noted some urgency in the proposal.
He said the present Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) is not a big issue anymore, and"the
ionger you wait [in proposing a new system]
the more legitimate the CJP becomes."
"The judicial system as it now stands is fair
and very efficient and I see no pressure for
change," Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a former
C-15 member, told the Daily April 9.
Business Prof. Harold Leavitt, however,
said in the same issue that "what is really
needed is for students to put forward new
proposals because the faculty and
administration probably won't put forward
anything new." Leavitt is returning to the
C-15 next year.
Whistler felt that extended terms for
student members of C-15 were not necessary.
"It is a good idea to get new people involved
because the older members can get into
terrible ruts," he said.
Faculty Quiet On COSS
A similar schism, though well below the
surface and not manifesting itself publicly,
may affect the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS).
COSS is charged by the University
president to look into areas of student life,

including residences and campus
organizations.
Most agree that faculty input on COSS has
been limited, primarily because the issues the
committee confronts are of little interest to
faculty members. One of three on the
eight-person committee, Asst. Chemistry Prof.
Hans C. Andersen, says, "For the kinds of
things we talked about this year, I can't see
how it [faculty input] was useful."
Other ills afflict COSS, the only University
committee with a student chairman and
student majority. Chairman Bill Rifkin says of
the committee's charge, which requires at
least two meetings per quarter, "We haven't
been living up to it at all."
Now meeting more regularly, COSS has
been involved in revision of the housing draw,
formulation of a report on the need for new

undergraduate housing and establishment of
provisions for selection of residence staffs,
according to Rifkin.
Dealings between the housing office and
COSS bring to light another major drawback
of the committee: adequate representation of
students. Rifkin says "blame was put in the
wrong place" when some students voiced
objections to the transfer of the black theme
house from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia in April.
Rifkin and Andersen agree that the reputed
lack of student input prior to the decision was
the fault of the committee, not Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton. "The
problem isn't between the housing office and
the committee," Rifkin says, "but between
the committee and the student body."
"Five students aren't representative of the
entire student body," Rifkin says. "We have
been blinded to certain issues." Among them
are those involving minorities: COSS' students
are all white.
The main problem with COSS, however,
remains its faculty input. "I haven't been
entirely happy with it,"says chairman Rifkin.
He hastens to add that faculty members on
COSS haven't been uncooperative, but that
schedule conflicts allow them "limited
availability."
These conflicts include simultaneous
P'aculty Senate meetings for two members and
frequent out-of-town trips by the third,
Electrical Engineering Prof. O.G. Villard, who
attended his first meeting May 1.
Another hindrance is the alienation some
faculty members feel toward the business of
COSS. "I found myself not saying too much,"
says Andersen. "Most of the topics seemed
primarily of concern to students."
Andersen is not sure more faculty input is
desirable. Given the nature of COSS, "it's not
obvious you'd want to" increase such input,
he says. "There's no reason to solicit more
faculty input for the issues we had this year."
CEEW: A Woman's Year
"This was the year of the woman student
here," according to senior Barbara Brown,
student member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
The committee's charter states that its
duties include the "improvement of
educational and occupational opportunities"
here and the development of "avenues for
increasing [the number of) women faculty
members."
CEEW succeeded in getting the student
affairs office to establish a "women's
advocate" and persuading the provost's office
to fund a study on the education of women at
Stanford, to be completed next year.
Still, said Brown, "we could have done a
lot more." Problems with the committee
chairmanship marred CEEW's year.
The committee did show several strengths,
according to its members. "We were a
cohesive group this year," said Brown. Most
members of CEEW are women activists, and
disputes concerning goals were rare.
CEEW avoids a problem of other
committees: disinterested members. Graduate
student Barbara Glenn noted this problem,
saying many faculty members "are often
reluctant to serve on a committee." But, she
added, "we had a bunch this year who were
intensely interested in the issues."
Student members, however, have been"the
guiding force of the committee," according to
Amy Metcalfe, assistant to the provost. Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams agreed:
"The women students played as great, or an
even greater role, than the other members."
CEEW lacked a strong leader for much of
the year. "We would often meet and throw
out ideas, but you really need someone to
sum things up, narrow the focus so you can
begin to act on an issue," said Brown.
Metcalfe, who served as acting chairwoman
for the first two quarters, said, "We fell apart
after winter quarter this year." She blamed
the demise on "poor planning in changing the
chairmanship in the middle of the year."
Asst. English Prof. Diane Middlebrook was
appointed to a two-year term as chairwoman in
the fall of last year. She was on leave,
however, until this April, and has not yet
become active in CEEW. The committee met
only once this quarter.
Middlebrook said she was appointed to
CEEW "against my better judgment. I accept
working on committees as part of my job at
Stanford." She thought the committee ran

smoothly this year because "the personalities
were harmonious and cooperative," but sees a
"complete turnover in membership next year"
when she will begin her first year as an active
chairwoman.
Former ASSU Vice President and member
Beth Garfield disagreed with the concept of
committees most widely held in the
University, that of an adviser. She saw the
committee's proper role as "putting pressure
on the appropriate decision-maker."
Garfield wants to change the committee's
focus next year. "Probably too much
emphasis was placed on the students' position
this year," she said. "We really need to take
up staff issues next year."
Metcalfe, however, didn't share Garfield's
concern.
Thus CEEW may be faced with its first

intra-committee dispute which would disturb
the present homogeneity of membership.
CUS: Inhibited Students
Charged by the Academic Council to
formulate "policies governing the structure of
the undergraduate curriculum," changes in
degree programs and the academic advising
system, the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has been quite active, according
to many of its members. Some student
delegates to CUS, however, apparently have
remained dormant.
CUS' accomplishments for 1973-74 are
apparently many, though few are tangible. Its
central problem rests with student
involvement: only three of its 10 members,
CUS' charge dictates, may be undergraduate
students. The remainder are from the
Academic Council, and the resulting
dominance prompted one of the student
members, Betty Muth, to comment, "I always
had the feeling I wasn't being taken seriously
by some faculty on the committee."
An inspection of the minutes of CUS' first
14 meetings this year indicates a dominance
of contributions by faculty members. It
reveals a startling fact: except for an exchange
on the policies of the ASSU Nominations
Committee at CUS' first meeting, student
member and now-ASSU President Mike
Herman had not made a single recorded
contribution to CUS meetings until the one of
May 8.
"[Herman| is not a frequent contributor,"
says Dean of Undergra'duate Studies James
Gibbs, an ex-officio member of CUS. But,
Gibbs says, "when Herman does
[contribute], it's something valuable."
CUS Chairman Richard A. Brody, assistant
professor of political science, agreed with
Gibbs. "Herman is a solid guy. He doesn't say
much but when he does it's something good."
"Word for jvord, I myself don't contribute
as much as some members," Herman admits.
But, he says, "my contribution has been as
great as the other students' [Betty Muth and
Tom Wattles]
Muth disagrees, "I don't think either one
of the guys contributes very much. There's
many meetings where he [Herman] doesn't
say anything."
Herman attributes his lack of mention in
CUS minutes to a subconscious bias in favor
of faculty members on the part of committee
secretary Alice Supton. He said he found
"most upsetting" the dearth of student
comments in the minutes.
Supton admits, "It might be that
unconsciously I didn't pay attention to

"pretty much do" reflect the relative
contributions. "I just found that Mike didn't
say as much."
Imagined or not, Herman's
non-contribution reflects a major concern of
CUS: the amount and worth of student input.
"It's variable," Gibbs says of student input.
"There are some issues students are not
interested in."
"The students are pretty general
contributors ... an important part of the
system," says chairman Brody.
Muth paints a less rosy picture. "The
problem is that faculty are reluctant to
change. They use the committee as an
instrument to define what we already have."
"The main problem [for students] is
continuity," says Gibbs. It takes one quarter

didn't feel Hargadon's domination of meetings
was detrimental.
"Dean Hargadon will accept a student's
opinion if it is intelligent enough," said
student member Carmen Logan.
Huff said although C-UAFA members "are
not, in effect, running the office . . . they
determine what type of students should be at
Stanford and make sure they can come here
once accepted. We have to follow their
recommendations."
In Mayer's words, Hargadon "is the one
who has access to all the materials and
relevant data."
"I'm expected to know more about
admissions," said Hargadon, pointing out that
committees are only extra-curricular duties
for their members. "Should something go
wrong at an operational level, it's my
responsibility. You don't fire teachers or
expel students for a mistake they make on a
committee."
Some C-UAFA members are unable to
contribute significantly because they lack
expertise. "Those with tenure seem to know a
lot more," said Logan. "There's a definite
disadvantage of students having only
one-year terms." (Mayer is the only
two-termer.)
Meetings often plod along on a fixed
course. "The committee could be more
effective if . . . it didn't stick to such a rigid
agenda," said Logan.
"There is some frustration when things
move slowly and things don't get discussed,"
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel said.
In trying to counter this, Mayer has
found that "we [students J got much more
done when we met with Hargadon
separately."
Official meetings are infrequent. C-UAFA's
charge requires six meetings per year, and the
committee met only that many times.
Huff and Mayer both called for more
meetings. Fetter said, however, that he would
be "much less willing to serve on the
committee if it met too often. 1 have other
obligations within my department."
According to Siegel, "the chairman
[Green j is reluctant to overwork people."
SWOPSI: United Battle
While C-UAFA tends to rely on Hargadon
in deference to his position, the members of
the SWOPSI Policy Board are supportive of
program director Dan Lewis for a d.ifferent
reason: SWOPSI's continuing fight ? for
autonomy.
Student member Chris Elms called Lewis
"clearly the dominant force on the Board."
Faculty members respect Lewis, Elms said,
because he knows a lot about the program's
courses, and students respect him because
they know he has fought for the program for
years. (Lewis has been director since
SWOPSI's inception in 1969, but is resigning
this August.)

Although faculty members contribute far
more than the students, Elms attributed that
to agreement, not intimidation.
Elms, student chairperson Chris Baron and
another student complimented the faculty
members 011 their assistance to students, and
recognized the need for it. Said Elms, "If this
were I only] a student committee, it wouldn't
mean a thing. Students in this university don't
have a clout."
Baron noted that faculty members are
helpful in contributing a realistic view of how
much can be taught in one quarter when the
Board is discussing courses.
Academic standards for courses are the
only significant area of disagreement on this
otherwise united committee. A few members,
such as Elms, feel the Board "worries
sometimes too much whether something has
'sufficient academic rigor,' " thus discouraging
students from teaching courses. But pressure
from the administration has led to tightened
criteria.

Although the Board's main job is approving
courses, it has spent much of its time haggling
with Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs over funds and policies.
Elms expressed concern over what he saw
as the dean's apparent tendency to regard
SWOPSI- as a "proving-ground" for
departmental courses. English Prof. William
Chace, another Board member, said the
program is just "too anarchistic, too sloppy,
too unruly" for Gibbs.
Gibbs has proposed merging SWOPSI with
the Undergraduate Specials program, a
proposal the Board has fought vehemently.
In addition, the dean informed the Board
April 30 that SWOPSI funding for next year
was in question because his reserve funds,
traditionally used for the program, had dried
up. As an economy move, Gibbs also
proposed that full-time staffer Merlyn Payne's
job be reduced to four hours per day; the
Board has opposed this move as well.
Some members have begun to doubt the
Board's effectiveness in the long run and
many have viewed their role in accordance
with Lewis' motto — "Dare to struggle, dare
to stalemate."
Public Events: Yes Men?
The Committee on Public Events appears
to suffer, too, from a dependency on the
administrator whom it oversees. Of 11
committee members the four students and
four faculty do appear to contribute equally
and substantially, but the whole committee's
role in bringing public events to campus is
limited.
According to the 1971 public events policy
manual, the committee "govern[sj all
non-academic, non-athletic programs which
are held ... on University property and which
are open to the public or to all students. . ."
Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti said
the specifics of these performances are carried
out mainly by his office. The primary duty 0/
the committee, he said, is "policy setting not
programming."
Student member 800 Bacon said of the
committee, "It does fulfill public events that a
lot of students are concerned about, but
authority is vested in Tom Bacchetti. He is
capable but his taste can't possibly reflect the
whole Stanford community."
"The committee is just a rubber stamp
committee — it doesn't do much," said
student member Mary Lou Johnson.
A review of the committee minutes shows
that recent business consisted mostly of
reports by Bacchetti.
"We run this institution on an advocacy
system," said Bacchetti. "If somebody can
make a case I'm more than receptive and if
I'm persuaded I'll do it, but we're not going to
overreact to some ideas which aren't fully
realized yet."
"We only appeal to one segment of the
community," said Bacon. "Bacchetti is open
but he's going to go ahead and do what he'll
do unless you can make it [a proposal] seem
solid."
Bacchetti admits that most of the
programming done by his office "tends to be
somewhat conservative ... they are usually
things which complement academic
programming."
Student member Mason Blacher said, "I've
lobbied for University support for
student-initiated theater and drama for one
and a half >ears."
Education Prof. Robert Textor said he too
pushed for mixed offerings.
Blacher blames financial hangups rather
than Bacchetti for the Public Events failings.
"The University recognizes him when he
brings quartets and outside talents rather than
when he helps ... University groups."
Bacon points out that it is the
responsibility of students on the committee
"to have some commitment." He said
students on the committee should frequently
poll the student body, "something we haven't
done."
One student member who did consider
himself effective was ASSU Special Events
Director Dan Scher.
Scher said he was "instrumental" in
scheduling several jazz concerts on campus
next year.

Bacon said he tried to establish a Black
Cultural program next year but Bacchetti said
Bacon's proposals were not all accepted
"because of our financial responsibility to the
University."
C-15: A Virtual Standoff
An unusual milieu of intra-committee
non-cooperation has developed in the
Committee of 15 (C-15), the
faculty-student-administration panel to revise
the student judicial system.
According to two student members,
backlash among faculty members against the
defeat of the C-15 proposal last October has
resulted in a standoff between two sides of
the group.
"They [faculty] felt generous over the
October proposal," said student member
Philip Whistler. The faculty didn't want to
drag along work on a proposal for the entire
year, Whistler said.
The October proposal was overwhelmingly

defeated by students after some key student
members of the C-15 opposed it, claiming that
student judicial rights were not guaranteed.
Whistler said, "There was a standoff in last
year's [October] scheme." He said both sides
had made significant compromises in order to
reach an agreement, and submitted the
proposal because they "thought it was the
best we could get" under the prevailing
circumstances.
The major problem with the C-15 this year
was "too little time to formulate new
proposals" after the October defeat, according
to student member David Herst. Only two
C-15 meetings were held this year.
Student members of the C-15 recently have
proposed a new judicial plan which would
establish a faculty "buffer zone" in judicial
proceedings between students and the
administration.
Under the plan, an all-student panel would
make judicial recommendations to the dean of
students. If he disagreed with them, a separate
faculty board would take up the matter. Its
decision would have to be approved by the
University president.
Herst noted some urgency in the proposal.
He said the present Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) is not a big issue anymore, and"the
ionger you wait [in proposing a new system]
the more legitimate the CJP becomes."
"The judicial system as it now stands is fair
and very efficient and I see no pressure for
change," Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a former
C-15 member, told the Daily April 9.
Business Prof. Harold Leavitt, however,
said in the same issue that "what is really
needed is for students to put forward new
proposals because the faculty and
administration probably won't put forward
anything new." Leavitt is returning to the
C-15 next year.
Whistler felt that extended terms for
student members of C-15 were not necessary.
"It is a good idea to get new people involved
because the older members can get into
terrible ruts," he said.
Faculty Quiet On COSS
A similar schism, though well below the
surface and not manifesting itself publicly,
may affect the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS).
COSS is charged by the University
president to look into areas of student life,

including residences and campus
organizations.
Most agree that faculty input on COSS has
been limited, primarily because the issues the
committee confronts are of little interest to
faculty members. One of three on the
eight-person committee, Asst. Chemistry Prof.
Hans C. Andersen, says, "For the kinds of
things we talked about this year, I can't see
how it [faculty input] was useful."
Other ills afflict COSS, the only University
committee with a student chairman and
student majority. Chairman Bill Rifkin says of
the committee's charge, which requires at
least two meetings per quarter, "We haven't
been living up to it at all."
Now meeting more regularly, COSS has
been involved in revision of the housing draw,
formulation of a report on the need for new

undergraduate housing and establishment of
provisions for selection of residence staffs,
according to Rifkin.
Dealings between the housing office and
COSS bring to light another major drawback
of the committee: adequate representation of
students. Rifkin says "blame was put in the
wrong place" when some students voiced
objections to the transfer of the black theme
house from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia in April.
Rifkin and Andersen agree that the reputed
lack of student input prior to the decision was
the fault of the committee, not Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton. "The
problem isn't between the housing office and
the committee," Rifkin says, "but between
the committee and the student body."
"Five students aren't representative of the
entire student body," Rifkin says. "We have
been blinded to certain issues." Among them
are those involving minorities: COSS' students
are all white.
The main problem with COSS, however,
remains its faculty input. "I haven't been
entirely happy with it,"says chairman Rifkin.
He hastens to add that faculty members on
COSS haven't been uncooperative, but that
schedule conflicts allow them "limited
availability."
These conflicts include simultaneous
P'aculty Senate meetings for two members and
frequent out-of-town trips by the third,
Electrical Engineering Prof. O.G. Villard, who
attended his first meeting May 1.
Another hindrance is the alienation some
faculty members feel toward the business of
COSS. "I found myself not saying too much,"
says Andersen. "Most of the topics seemed
primarily of concern to students."
Andersen is not sure more faculty input is
desirable. Given the nature of COSS, "it's not
obvious you'd want to" increase such input,
he says. "There's no reason to solicit more
faculty input for the issues we had this year."
CEEW: A Woman's Year
"This was the year of the woman student
here," according to senior Barbara Brown,
student member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
The committee's charter states that its
duties include the "improvement of
educational and occupational opportunities"
here and the development of "avenues for
increasing [the number of) women faculty
members."
CEEW succeeded in getting the student
affairs office to establish a "women's
advocate" and persuading the provost's office
to fund a study on the education of women at
Stanford, to be completed next year.
Still, said Brown, "we could have done a
lot more." Problems with the committee
chairmanship marred CEEW's year.
The committee did show several strengths,
according to its members. "We were a
cohesive group this year," said Brown. Most
members of CEEW are women activists, and
disputes concerning goals were rare.
CEEW avoids a problem of other
committees: disinterested members. Graduate
student Barbara Glenn noted this problem,
saying many faculty members "are often
reluctant to serve on a committee." But, she
added, "we had a bunch this year who were
intensely interested in the issues."
Student members, however, have been"the
guiding force of the committee," according to
Amy Metcalfe, assistant to the provost. Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams agreed:
"The women students played as great, or an
even greater role, than the other members."
CEEW lacked a strong leader for much of
the year. "We would often meet and throw
out ideas, but you really need someone to
sum things up, narrow the focus so you can
begin to act on an issue," said Brown.
Metcalfe, who served as acting chairwoman
for the first two quarters, said, "We fell apart
after winter quarter this year." She blamed
the demise on "poor planning in changing the
chairmanship in the middle of the year."
Asst. English Prof. Diane Middlebrook was
appointed to a two-year term as chairwoman in
the fall of last year. She was on leave,
however, until this April, and has not yet
become active in CEEW. The committee met
only once this quarter.
Middlebrook said she was appointed to
CEEW "against my better judgment. I accept
working on committees as part of my job at
Stanford." She thought the committee ran

smoothly this year because "the personalities
were harmonious and cooperative," but sees a
"complete turnover in membership next year"
when she will begin her first year as an active
chairwoman.
Former ASSU Vice President and member
Beth Garfield disagreed with the concept of
committees most widely held in the
University, that of an adviser. She saw the
committee's proper role as "putting pressure
on the appropriate decision-maker."
Garfield wants to change the committee's
focus next year. "Probably too much
emphasis was placed on the students' position
this year," she said. "We really need to take
up staff issues next year."
Metcalfe, however, didn't share Garfield's
concern.
Thus CEEW may be faced with its first

intra-committee dispute which would disturb
the present homogeneity of membership.
CUS: Inhibited Students
Charged by the Academic Council to
formulate "policies governing the structure of
the undergraduate curriculum," changes in
degree programs and the academic advising
system, the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has been quite active, according
to many of its members. Some student
delegates to CUS, however, apparently have
remained dormant.
CUS' accomplishments for 1973-74 are
apparently many, though few are tangible. Its
central problem rests with student
involvement: only three of its 10 members,
CUS' charge dictates, may be undergraduate
students. The remainder are from the
Academic Council, and the resulting
dominance prompted one of the student
members, Betty Muth, to comment, "I always
had the feeling I wasn't being taken seriously
by some faculty on the committee."
An inspection of the minutes of CUS' first
14 meetings this year indicates a dominance
of contributions by faculty members. It
reveals a startling fact: except for an exchange
on the policies of the ASSU Nominations
Committee at CUS' first meeting, student
member and now-ASSU President Mike
Herman had not made a single recorded
contribution to CUS meetings until the one of
May 8.
"[Herman| is not a frequent contributor,"
says Dean of Undergra'duate Studies James
Gibbs, an ex-officio member of CUS. But,
Gibbs says, "when Herman does
[contribute], it's something valuable."
CUS Chairman Richard A. Brody, assistant
professor of political science, agreed with
Gibbs. "Herman is a solid guy. He doesn't say
much but when he does it's something good."
"Word for jvord, I myself don't contribute
as much as some members," Herman admits.
But, he says, "my contribution has been as
great as the other students' [Betty Muth and
Tom Wattles]
Muth disagrees, "I don't think either one
of the guys contributes very much. There's
many meetings where he [Herman] doesn't
say anything."
Herman attributes his lack of mention in
CUS minutes to a subconscious bias in favor
of faculty members on the part of committee
secretary Alice Supton. He said he found
"most upsetting" the dearth of student
comments in the minutes.
Supton admits, "It might be that
unconsciously I didn't pay attention to
students." However, she insists her minutes
"pretty much do" reflect the relative
contributions. "I just found that Mike didn't
say as much."
Imagined or not, Herman's
non-contribution reflects a major concern of
CUS: the amount and worth of student input.
"It's variable," Gibbs says of student input.
"There are some issues students are not
interested in."
"The students are pretty general
contributors ... an important part of the
system," says chairman Brody.
Muth paints a less rosy picture. "The
problem is that faculty are reluctant to
change. They use the committee as an
instrument to define what we already have."
"The main problem [for students] is
continuity," says Gibbs. It takes one quarter
for them to learn how it [committee]
operates."
Muth strongly agrees: "Student
appointments [now one year] should be
longer," she says. "This year I've just gotten a
taste."
Investigation Summary
These seven committees can be taken to
represent the committee system in
microcosm. From their cases, a number of
problems stand out:
—Some faculty serve on committees only
as part of what they consider an "unwritten
obligation." Others serve by their own
request, and seem to become more involved
(as on CEEW) rather than disinterested (as on
COSS).
—Faculty attendance is often spotty. When
Faculty Senate members serve on committees
as well, schedule conflicts often arise. And
faculty members often find it difficult to
attach the same importance to committee
memberships that they do to their classes.
—Student views are sometimes given short
shrift. On CUS, for example, student members
perceive that their contributions are valued
less than those of faculty members. On
CEEW, on the other hand, faculty members'
active interest in student views — and greater
initiative and effort on the part of student
members — have proved effective.
—Committees intended as policy-setting
groups often defer to the "superior
knowledge" of the administrators they are
supposed to oversee. As a result, committees
often act solely on administrators'
recommendations — instead of undertaking
more independent deliberations.
—Faculty are currently given three-year
terms, while students are generally limited to
one year. In committees of a continuing
nature, such as C-US and C-UAFA, this
limitation hampers student input.
—While the ASSU currently requires
student committee members to file reports of
their performance, the Academic Council does
not request such reports. The
"accountability" of all committee members is
unclear.
—Committee meetings are not open to
effective press coverage. Confidentiality is
important to some committees (such as C-15),
but student and faculty skepticism of secret
deliberations may hamper input. Greater
monitoring and publicity might help both
student and faculty members to be more
effective.
Next year, the ASSU Council of Presidents
plans to assign a student staff assistant to each
committee's student members. ASSU
President Mike Herman says "better liaison
between student government and students on
committees" will result from the posts.

MASON BLACHER BARBARA BROWN MIKE HERMAN
A year for financial hangups, a women's advocate and "upsetting" minutes.
"You can't hold a committee responsible
for a decision," says Assoc. Dean of Student
. iffairs Dan Williams.
But the Stanford administration, faculty
and Board of Trustees hold these groups
responsible for something, and usually it's
called "input." Together they've set up 48
different committees that contain student
members, and such groups are virtually the
only means a student has of "inputting" into
vhe decisions that shape his university.
Three major types of committees exist
here: those impaneled by the University
president, usually under the eye of an
ex-officio member who is a part of the
administration; those of the Academic
Council, governing body of the faculty (these
contain a minority of student members
and a majority from the Council); and those
of the trustees, whose minutes and
deliberations are confidential.
Just what are these committees
accomplishing, and how effective are the
students who serve on them? To find out, the
Daily has conducted an in-depth investigation
of seven committees it believes representative
of the system. No trustee committee is
included; their records are not open to the
press.
Points explored in this investigation
include the amount — and quality — of
student and faculty input; student and faculty
interest, as reflected in attendance records;
the question of possible dominance of a
committee by the official it is intended to
advise; committee harmony and conflicts;
and, finally, the accountability of committee
members to those they represent.
The investigation has revealed that
although participation on committees has
often been inadequate, some committees
stand as monuments to how change in the
University can be achieved by "going through
channels."
C-UAFA: Power Unused
Though most University committees are
admittedly only advisory bodies to an
administrator in their area, the charge of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (C-UAFA) empowers this group
to make certain "determinations."
Among these are the content of application
forms, the number of students to be admitted,
requirements for admission (and exceptions to
these), standards for establishing priority for
financial aid and the types of aid available.
Despite being blessed with such unusual
power, committee members apparently are
not taking advantage of their position. The
reason, in the words of student member
Michael Jennings, is that "[Dean of
Admissions Fred] Hargadon seems to run
things." Committee chairman Paul Green,
professor of biological sciences, said,
"Hargadon influences the committee most.
He's more informed."
Assoc. Physics Prof. Alexander Fetter
agreed that Hargadon "is generally persuasive.
The commiuoe seems to agree with
Hargadon."
Quinn Mayer, student member and now
ASSU vice president, stated, "The committee
is an advisory panel to Dean Hargadon."
Praise for both Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff was nearly
unanimous among C-UAFA members. Some
didn't feel Hargadon's domination of meetings
was detrimental.
"Dean Hargadon will accept a student's
opinion if it is intelligent enough," said
student member Carmen Logan.
Huff said although C-UAFA members "are
not, in effect, running the office . . . they
determine what type of students should be at
Stanford and make sure they can come here
once accepted. We have to follow their
recommendations."
In Mayer's words, Hargadon "is the one
who has access to all the materials and
relevant data."
"I'm expected to know more about
admissions," said Hargadon, pointing out that
committees are only extra-curricular duties
for their members. "Should something go
wrong at an operational level, it's my
responsibility. You don't fire teachers or
expel students for a mistake they make on a
committee."
Some C-UAFA members are unable to
contribute significantly because they lack
expertise. "Those with tenure seem to know a
lot more," said Logan. "There's a definite
disadvantage of students having only
one-year terms." (Mayer is the only
two-termer.)
Meetings often plod along on a fixed
course. "The committee could be more
effective if . . . it didn't stick to such a rigid
agenda," said Logan.
"There is some frustration when things
move slowly and things don't get discussed,"
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel said.
In trying to counter this, Mayer has
found that "we [students J got much more
done when we met with Hargadon
separately."
Official meetings are infrequent. C-UAFA's
charge requires six meetings per year, and the
committee met only that many times.
Huff and Mayer both called for more
meetings. Fetter said, however, that he would
be "much less willing to serve on the
committee if it met too often. 1 have other
obligations within my department."
According to Siegel, "the chairman
[Green j is reluctant to overwork people."

While C-UAFA tends to rely on Hargadon
in deference to his position, the members of
the SWOPSI Policy Board are supportive of
program director Dan Lewis for a d.ifferent
reason: SWOPSI's continuing fight ? for
autonomy.

"clearly the dominant force on the Board."

C-15: A Virtual Standoff
An unusual milieu of intra-committee
non-cooperation has developed in the
Committee of 15 (C-15), the
faculty-student-administration panel to revise
the student judicial system.
According to two student members,
backlash among faculty members against the
defeat of the C-15 proposal last October has
resulted in a standoff between two sides of
the group.
"They [faculty] felt generous over the
October proposal," said student member
Philip Whistler. The faculty didn't want to
drag along work on a proposal for the entire
year, Whistler said.
The October proposal was overwhelmingly

defeated by students after some key student
members of the C-15 opposed it, claiming that
student judicial rights were not guaranteed.
Whistler said, "There was a standoff in last
year's [October] scheme." He said both sides
had made significant compromises in order to
reach an agreement, and submitted the
proposal because they "thought it was the
best we could get" under the prevailing
circumstances.
The major problem with the C-15 this year
was "too little time to formulate new
proposals" after the October defeat, according
to student member David Herst. Only two
C-15 meetings were held this year.
Student members of the C-15 recently have
proposed a new judicial plan which would
establish a faculty "buffer zone" in judicial
proceedings between students and the
administration.
Under the plan, an all-student panel would
make judicial recommendations to the dean of
students. If he disagreed with them, a separate
faculty board would take up the matter. Its
decision would have to be approved by the
University president.
Herst noted some urgency in the proposal.
He said the present Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) is not a big issue anymore, and"the
ionger you wait [in proposing a new system]
the more legitimate the CJP becomes."
"The judicial system as it now stands is fair
and very efficient and I see no pressure for
change," Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a former
C-15 member, told the Daily April 9.
Business Prof. Harold Leavitt, however,
said in the same issue that "what is really
needed is for students to put forward new
proposals because the faculty and
administration probably won't put forward
anything new." Leavitt is returning to the
C-15 next year.
Whistler felt that extended terms for
student members of C-15 were not necessary.
"It is a good idea to get new people involved
because the older members can get into
terrible ruts," he said.
Faculty Quiet On COSS
A similar schism, though well below the
surface and not manifesting itself publicly,
may affect the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS).
COSS is charged by the University
president to look into areas of student life,

including residences and campus
organizations.
Most agree that faculty input on COSS has
been limited, primarily because the issues the
committee confronts are of little interest to
faculty members. One of three on the
eight-person committee, Asst. Chemistry Prof.
Hans C. Andersen, says, "For the kinds of
things we talked about this year, I can't see
how it [faculty input] was useful."
Other ills afflict COSS, the only University
committee with a student chairman and
student majority. Chairman Bill Rifkin says of
the committee's charge, which requires at
least two meetings per quarter, "We haven't
been living up to it at all."
Now meeting more regularly, COSS has
been involved in revision of the housing draw,
formulation of a report on the need for new

undergraduate housing and establishment of
provisions for selection of residence staffs,
according to Rifkin.
Dealings between the housing office and
COSS bring to light another major drawback
of the committee: adequate representation of
students. Rifkin says "blame was put in the
wrong place" when some students voiced
objections to the transfer of the black theme
house from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia in April.
Rifkin and Andersen agree that the reputed
lack of student input prior to the decision was
the fault of the committee, not Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton. "The
problem isn't between the housing office and
the committee," Rifkin says, "but between
the committee and the student body."
"Five students aren't representative of the
entire student body," Rifkin says. "We have
been blinded to certain issues." Among them
are those involving minorities: COSS' students
are all white.
The main problem with COSS, however,
remains its faculty input. "I haven't been
entirely happy with it,"says chairman Rifkin.
He hastens to add that faculty members on
COSS haven't been uncooperative, but that
schedule conflicts allow them "limited
availability."
These conflicts include simultaneous
P'aculty Senate meetings for two members and
frequent out-of-town trips by the third,
Electrical Engineering Prof. O.G. Villard, who
attended his first meeting May 1.
Another hindrance is the alienation some
faculty members feel toward the business of
COSS. "I found myself not saying too much,"
says Andersen. "Most of the topics seemed
primarily of concern to students."
Andersen is not sure more faculty input is
desirable. Given the nature of COSS, "it's not
obvious you'd want to" increase such input,
he says. "There's no reason to solicit more
faculty input for the issues we had this year."
CEEW: A Woman's Year
"This was the year of the woman student
here," according to senior Barbara Brown,
student member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
The committee's charter states that its
duties include the "improvement of
educational and occupational opportunities"
here and the development of "avenues for
increasing [the number of) women faculty
members."
CEEW succeeded in getting the student
affairs office to establish a "women's
advocate" and persuading the provost's office
to fund a study on the education of women at
Stanford, to be completed next year.
Still, said Brown, "we could have done a
lot more." Problems with the committee
chairmanship marred CEEW's year.
The committee did show several strengths,
according to its members. "We were a
cohesive group this year," said Brown. Most
members of CEEW are women activists, and
disputes concerning goals were rare.
CEEW avoids a problem of other
committees: disinterested members. Graduate
student Barbara Glenn noted this problem,
saying many faculty members "are often
reluctant to serve on a committee." But, she
added, "we had a bunch this year who were
intensely interested in the issues."
Student members, however, have been"the
guiding force of the committee," according to
Amy Metcalfe, assistant to the provost. Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams agreed:
"The women students played as great, or an
even greater role, than the other members."
CEEW lacked a strong leader for much of
the year. "We would often meet and throw
out ideas, but you really need someone to
sum things up, narrow the focus so you can
begin to act on an issue," said Brown.
Metcalfe, who served as acting chairwoman
for the first two quarters, said, "We fell apart
after winter quarter this year." She blamed
the demise on "poor planning in changing the
chairmanship in the middle of the year."
Asst. English Prof. Diane Middlebrook was
appointed to a two-year term as chairwoman in
the fall of last year. She was on leave,
however, until this April, and has not yet
become active in CEEW. The committee met
only once this quarter.
Middlebrook said she was appointed to
CEEW "against my better judgment. I accept
working on committees as part of my job at
Stanford." She thought the committee ran

smoothly this year because "the personalities
were harmonious and cooperative," but sees a
"complete turnover in membership next year"
when she will begin her first year as an active
chairwoman.
Former ASSU Vice President and member
Beth Garfield disagreed with the concept of
committees most widely held in the
University, that of an adviser. She saw the
committee's proper role as "putting pressure
on the appropriate decision-maker."
Garfield wants to change the committee's
focus next year. "Probably too much
emphasis was placed on the students' position
this year," she said. "We really need to take
up staff issues next year."
Metcalfe, however, didn't share Garfield's
concern.
Thus CEEW may be faced with its first

intra-committee dispute which would disturb
the present homogeneity of membership.
CUS: Inhibited Students
Charged by the Academic Council to
formulate "policies governing the structure of
the undergraduate curriculum," changes in
degree programs and the academic advising
system, the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has been quite active, according
to many of its members. Some student
delegates to CUS, however, apparently have
remained dormant.
CUS' accomplishments for 1973-74 are
apparently many, though few are tangible. Its
central problem rests with student
involvement: only three of its 10 members,
CUS' charge dictates, may be undergraduate
students. The remainder are from the
Academic Council, and the resulting
dominance prompted one of the student
members, Betty Muth, to comment, "I always
had the feeling I wasn't being taken seriously
by some faculty on the committee."
An inspection of the minutes of CUS' first
14 meetings this year indicates a dominance
of contributions by faculty members. It
reveals a startling fact: except for an exchange
on the policies of the ASSU Nominations
Committee at CUS' first meeting, student
member and now-ASSU President Mike
Herman had not made a single recorded
contribution to CUS meetings until the one of
May 8.
"[Herman| is not a frequent contributor,"
says Dean of Undergra'duate Studies James
Gibbs, an ex-officio member of CUS. But,
Gibbs says, "when Herman does
[contribute], it's something valuable."
CUS Chairman Richard A. Brody, assistant
professor of political science, agreed with
Gibbs. "Herman is a solid guy. He doesn't say
much but when he does it's something good."
"Word for jvord, I myself don't contribute
as much as some members," Herman admits.
But, he says, "my contribution has been as
great as the other students' [Betty Muth and
Tom Wattles]
Muth disagrees, "I don't think either one
of the guys contributes very much. There's
many meetings where he [Herman] doesn't
say anything."
Herman attributes his lack of mention in
CUS minutes to a subconscious bias in favor
of faculty members on the part of committee
secretary Alice Supton. He said he found
"most upsetting" the dearth of student
comments in the minutes.
Supton admits, "It might be that
unconsciously I didn't pay attention to
students." However, she insists her minutes
"pretty much do" reflect the relative
contributions. "I just found that Mike didn't
say as much."
Imagined or not, Herman's
non-contribution reflects a major concern of
CUS: the amount and worth of student input.
"It's variable," Gibbs says of student input.
"There are some issues students are not
interested in."
"The students are pretty general
contributors ... an important part of the
system," says chairman Brody.
Muth paints a less rosy picture. "The
problem is that faculty are reluctant to
change. They use the committee as an
instrument to define what we already have."
"The main problem [for students] is
continuity," says Gibbs. It takes one quarter
for them to learn how it [committee]
operates."
Muth strongly agrees: "Student
appointments [now one year] should be
longer," she says. "This year I've just gotten a
taste."
Investigation Summary
These seven committees can be taken to
represent the committee system in
microcosm. From their cases, a number of
problems stand out:
—Some faculty serve on committees only
as part of what they consider an "unwritten
obligation." Others serve by their own
request, and seem to become more involved
(as on CEEW) rather than disinterested (as on
COSS).
—Faculty attendance is often spotty. When
Faculty Senate members serve on committees
as well, schedule conflicts often arise. And
faculty members often find it difficult to
attach the same importance to committee
memberships that they do to their classes.
—Student views are sometimes given short
shrift. On CUS, for example, student members
perceive that their contributions are valued
less than those of faculty members. On
CEEW, on the other hand, faculty members'
active interest in student views — and greater
initiative and effort on the part of student
members — have proved effective.
—Committees intended as policy-setting
groups often defer to the "superior
knowledge" of the administrators they are
supposed to oversee. As a result, committees
often act solely on administrators'
recommendations — instead of undertaking
more independent deliberations.
—Faculty are currently given three-year
terms, while students are generally limited to
one year. In committees of a continuing
nature, such as C-US and C-UAFA, this
limitation hampers student input.
—While the ASSU currently requires
student committee members to file reports of
their performance, the Academic Council does
not request such reports. The
"accountability" of all committee members is
unclear.
—Committee meetings are not open to
effective press coverage. Confidentiality is
important to some committees (such as C-15),
but student and faculty skepticism of secret
deliberations may hamper input. Greater
monitoring and publicity might help both
student and faculty members to be more
effective.
Next year, the ASSU Council of Presidents
plans to assign a student staff assistant to each
committee's student members. ASSU
President Mike Herman says "better liaison
between student government and students on
committees" will result from the posts.

MASON BLACHER BARBARA BROWN MIKE HERMAN
A year for financial hangups, a women's advocate and "upsetting" minutes.
"You can't hold a committee responsible
for a decision," says Assoc. Dean of Student
. iffairs Dan Williams.
But the Stanford administration, faculty
and Board of Trustees hold these groups
responsible for something, and usually it's
called "input." Together they've set up 48
different committees that contain student
members, and such groups are virtually the
only means a student has of "inputting" into
vhe decisions that shape his university.
Three major types of committees exist
here: those impaneled by the University
president, usually under the eye of an
ex-officio member who is a part of the
administration; those of the Academic
Council, governing body of the faculty (these
contain a minority of student members
and a majority from the Council); and those
of the trustees, whose minutes and
deliberations are confidential.
Just what are these committees
accomplishing, and how effective are the
students who serve on them? To find out, the
Daily has conducted an in-depth investigation
of seven committees it believes representative
of the system. No trustee committee is
included; their records are not open to the
press.
Points explored in this investigation
include the amount — and quality — of
student and faculty input; student and faculty
interest, as reflected in attendance records;
the question of possible dominance of a
committee by the official it is intended to
advise; committee harmony and conflicts;
and, finally, the accountability of committee
members to those they represent.
The investigation has revealed that
although participation on committees has
often been inadequate, some committees
stand as monuments to how change in the
University can be achieved by "going through
channels."
C-UAFA: Power Unused
Though most University committees are
admittedly only advisory bodies to an
administrator in their area, the charge of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (C-UAFA) empowers this group
to make certain "determinations."
Among these are the content of application
forms, the number of students to be admitted,
requirements for admission (and exceptions to
these), standards for establishing priority for
financial aid and the types of aid available.
Despite being blessed with such unusual
power, committee members apparently are
not taking advantage of their position. The
reason, in the words of student member
Michael Jennings, is that "[Dean of
Admissions Fred] Hargadon seems to run
things." Committee chairman Paul Green,
professor of biological sciences, said,
"Hargadon influences the committee most.
He's more informed."
Assoc. Physics Prof. Alexander Fetter
agreed that Hargadon "is generally persuasive.
The commiuoe seems to agree with
Hargadon."
Quinn Mayer, student member and now
ASSU vice president, stated, "The committee
is an advisory panel to Dean Hargadon."
Praise for both Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff was nearly
unanimous among C-UAFA members. Some
didn't feel Hargadon's domination of meetings
was detrimental.
"Dean Hargadon will accept a student's
opinion if it is intelligent enough," said
student member Carmen Logan.
Huff said although C-UAFA members "are
not, in effect, running the office . . . they
determine what type of students should be at
Stanford and make sure they can come here
once accepted. We have to follow their
recommendations."
In Mayer's words, Hargadon "is the one
who has access to all the materials and
relevant data."
"I'm expected to know more about
admissions," said Hargadon, pointing out that
committees are only extra-curricular duties
for their members. "Should something go
wrong at an operational level, it's my
responsibility. You don't fire teachers or
expel students for a mistake they make on a
committee."
Some C-UAFA members are unable to
contribute significantly because they lack
expertise. "Those with tenure seem to know a
lot more," said Logan. "There's a definite
disadvantage of students having only
one-year terms." (Mayer is the only
two-termer.)
Meetings often plod along on a fixed
course. "The committee could be more
effective if . . . it didn't stick to such a rigid
agenda," said Logan.
"There is some frustration when things
move slowly and things don't get discussed,"
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel said.
In trying to counter this, Mayer has
found that "we [students J got much more
done when we met with Hargadon
separately."
Official meetings are infrequent. C-UAFA's
charge requires six meetings per year, and the
committee met only that many times.
Huff and Mayer both called for more
meetings. Fetter said, however, that he would
be "much less willing to serve on the
committee if it met too often. 1 have other
obligations within my department."
According to Siegel, "the chairman
[Green j is reluctant to overwork people."
SWOPSI: United Battle
While C-UAFA tends to rely on Hargadon
in deference to his position, the members of
the SWOPSI Policy Board are supportive of
program director Dan Lewis for a d.ifferent
reason: SWOPSI's continuing fight ? for
autonomy.
Student member Chris Elms called Lewis
"clearly the dominant force on the Board."
Faculty members respect Lewis, Elms said,
because he knows a lot about the program's
courses, and students respect him because
they know he has fought for the program for
years. (Lewis has been director since
SWOPSI's inception in 1969, but is resigning
this August.)

Although faculty members contribute far
more than the students, Elms attributed that
to agreement, not intimidation.
Elms, student chairperson Chris Baron and
another student complimented the faculty
members 011 their assistance to students, and
recognized the need for it. Said Elms, "If this
were I only] a student committee, it wouldn't
mean a thing. Students in this university don't
have a clout."
Baron noted that faculty members are
helpful in contributing a realistic view of how
much can be taught in one quarter when the
Board is discussing courses.
Academic standards for courses are the
only significant area of disagreement on this
otherwise united committee. A few members,
such as Elms, feel the Board "worries
sometimes too much whether something has
'sufficient academic rigor,' " thus discouraging
students from teaching courses. But pressure
from the administration has led to tightened
criteria.

Although the Board's main job is approving
courses, it has spent much of its time haggling
with Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs over funds and policies.
Elms expressed concern over what he saw
as the dean's apparent tendency to regard
SWOPSI- as a "proving-ground" for
departmental courses. English Prof. William
Chace, another Board member, said the
program is just "too anarchistic, too sloppy,
too unruly" for Gibbs.
Gibbs has proposed merging SWOPSI with
the Undergraduate Specials program, a
proposal the Board has fought vehemently.
In addition, the dean informed the Board
April 30 that SWOPSI funding for next year
was in question because his reserve funds,
traditionally used for the program, had dried
up. As an economy move, Gibbs also
proposed that full-time staffer Merlyn Payne's
job be reduced to four hours per day; the
Board has opposed this move as well.
Some members have begun to doubt the
Board's effectiveness in the long run and
many have viewed their role in accordance
with Lewis' motto — "Dare to struggle, dare
to stalemate."
Public Events: Yes Men?
The Committee on Public Events appears
to suffer, too, from a dependency on the
administrator whom it oversees. Of 11
committee members the four students and
four faculty do appear to contribute equally
and substantially, but the whole committee's
role in bringing public events to campus is
limited.
According to the 1971 public events policy
manual, the committee "govern[sj all
non-academic, non-athletic programs which
are held ... on University property and which
are open to the public or to all students. . ."
Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti said
the specifics of these performances are carried
out mainly by his office. The primary duty 0/
the committee, he said, is "policy setting not
programming."
Student member 800 Bacon said of the
committee, "It does fulfill public events that a
lot of students are concerned about, but
authority is vested in Tom Bacchetti. He is
capable but his taste can't possibly reflect the
whole Stanford community."
"The committee is just a rubber stamp
committee — it doesn't do much," said
student member Mary Lou Johnson.
A review of the committee minutes shows
that recent business consisted mostly of
reports by Bacchetti.
"We run this institution on an advocacy
system," said Bacchetti. "If somebody can
make a case I'm more than receptive and if
I'm persuaded I'll do it, but we're not going to
overreact to some ideas which aren't fully
realized yet."
"We only appeal to one segment of the
community," said Bacon. "Bacchetti is open
but he's going to go ahead and do what he'll
do unless you can make it [a proposal] seem
solid."
Bacchetti admits that most of the
programming done by his office "tends to be
somewhat conservative ... they are usually
things which complement academic
programming."
Student member Mason Blacher said, "I've
lobbied for University support for
student-initiated theater and drama for one
and a half >ears."
Education Prof. Robert Textor said he too
pushed for mixed offerings.
Blacher blames financial hangups rather
than Bacchetti for the Public Events failings.
"The University recognizes him when he
brings quartets and outside talents rather than
when he helps ... University groups."
Bacon points out that it is the
responsibility of students on the committee
"to have some commitment." He said
students on the committee should frequently
poll the student body, "something we haven't
done."
One student member who did consider
himself effective was ASSU Special Events
Director Dan Scher.
Scher said he was "instrumental" in
scheduling several jazz concerts on campus
next year.

Bacon said he tried to establish a Black
Cultural program next year but Bacchetti said
Bacon's proposals were not all accepted
"because of our financial responsibility to the
University."
C-15: A Virtual Standoff
An unusual milieu of intra-committee
non-cooperation has developed in the
Committee of 15 (C-15), the
faculty-student-administration panel to revise
the student judicial system.
According to two student members,
backlash among faculty members against the

The major problem with the C-15 this year
was "too little time to formulate new

to student member David Herst. Only two
C-15 meetings were held this year.
Student members of the C-15 recently have
proposed a new judicial plan which would

however, until this April, and has not yet
become active in CEEW. The committee met
only once this quarter.
Middlebrook said she was appointed to
CEEW "against my better judgment. I accept
working on committees as part of my job at
Stanford." She thought the committee ran

smoothly this year because "the personalities
were harmonious and cooperative," but sees a
"complete turnover in membership next year"
when she will begin her first year as an active
chairwoman.
Former ASSU Vice President and member
Beth Garfield disagreed with the concept of
committees most widely held in the
University, that of an adviser. She saw the
committee's proper role as "putting pressure
on the appropriate decision-maker."
Garfield wants to change the committee's
focus next year. "Probably too much
emphasis was placed on the students' position
this year," she said. "We really need to take
up staff issues next year."
Metcalfe, however, didn't share Garfield's
concern.
Thus CEEW may be faced with its first

intra-committee dispute which would disturb
the present homogeneity of membership.
CUS: Inhibited Students
Charged by the Academic Council to
formulate "policies governing the structure of
the undergraduate curriculum," changes in
degree programs and the academic advising
system, the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has been quite active, according
to many of its members. Some student
delegates to CUS, however, apparently have
remained dormant.
CUS' accomplishments for 1973-74 are
apparently many, though few are tangible. Its
central problem rests with student
involvement: only three of its 10 members,
CUS' charge dictates, may be undergraduate
students. The remainder are from the
Academic Council, and the resulting
dominance prompted one of the student
members, Betty Muth, to comment, "I always
had the feeling I wasn't being taken seriously
by some faculty on the committee."
An inspection of the minutes of CUS' first
14 meetings this year indicates a dominance
of contributions by faculty members. It
reveals a startling fact: except for an exchange
on the policies of the ASSU Nominations
Committee at CUS' first meeting, student
member and now-ASSU President Mike
Herman had not made a single recorded
contribution to CUS meetings until the one of
May 8.
"[Herman| is not a frequent contributor,"
says Dean of Undergra'duate Studies James
Gibbs, an ex-officio member of CUS. But,
Gibbs says, "when Herman does
[contribute], it's something valuable."
CUS Chairman Richard A. Brody, assistant
professor of political science, agreed with
Gibbs. "Herman is a solid guy. He doesn't say
much but when he does it's something good."
"Word for jvord, I myself don't contribute
as much as some members," Herman admits.
But, he says, "my contribution has been as
great as the other students' [Betty Muth and
Tom Wattles]
Muth disagrees, "I don't think either one
of the guys contributes very much. There's
many meetings where he [Herman] doesn't
say anything."
Herman attributes his lack of mention in
CUS minutes to a subconscious bias in favor
of faculty members on the part of committee
secretary Alice Supton. He said he found
"most upsetting" the dearth of student
comments in the minutes.
Supton admits, "It might be that
unconsciously I didn't pay attention to
students." However, she insists her minutes
"pretty much do" reflect the relative
contributions. "I just found that Mike didn't
say as much."
Imagined or not, Herman's
non-contribution reflects a major concern of
CUS: the amount and worth of student input.
"It's variable," Gibbs says of student input.
"There are some issues students are not
interested in."
"The students are pretty general
contributors ... an important part of the
system," says chairman Brody.
Muth paints a less rosy picture. "The
problem is that faculty are reluctant to
change. They use the committee as an
instrument to define what we already have."
"The main problem [for students] is
continuity," says Gibbs. It takes one quarter
for them to learn how it [committee]
operates."
Muth strongly agrees: "Student
appointments [now one year] should be
longer," she says. "This year I've just gotten a
taste."
Investigation Summary
These seven committees can be taken to
represent the committee system in
microcosm. From their cases, a number of
problems stand out:
—Some faculty serve on committees only
as part of what they consider an "unwritten
obligation." Others serve by their own
request, and seem to become more involved
(as on CEEW) rather than disinterested (as on
COSS).
—Faculty attendance is often spotty. When
Faculty Senate members serve on committees
as well, schedule conflicts often arise. And
faculty members often find it difficult to
attach the same importance to committee
memberships that they do to their classes.
—Student views are sometimes given short
shrift. On CUS, for example, student members
perceive that their contributions are valued
less than those of faculty members. On
CEEW, on the other hand, faculty members'
active interest in student views — and greater
initiative and effort on the part of student
members — have proved effective.
—Committees intended as policy-setting
groups often defer to the "superior
knowledge" of the administrators they are
supposed to oversee. As a result, committees
often act solely on administrators'
recommendations — instead of undertaking
more independent deliberations.
—Faculty are currently given three-year
terms, while students are generally limited to
one year. In committees of a continuing
nature, such as C-US and C-UAFA, this
limitation hampers student input.
—While the ASSU currently requires
student committee members to file reports of
their performance, the Academic Council does
not request such reports. The
"accountability" of all committee members is
unclear.
—Committee meetings are not open to
effective press coverage. Confidentiality is
important to some committees (such as C-15),
but student and faculty skepticism of secret
deliberations may hamper input. Greater
monitoring and publicity might help both
student and faculty members to be more
effective.
Next year, the ASSU Council of Presidents
plans to assign a student staff assistant to each
committee's student members. ASSU
President Mike Herman says "better liaison
between student government and students on
committees" will result from the posts.

MASON BLACHER BARBARA BROWN MIKE HERMAN
A year for financial hangups, a women's advocate and "upsetting" minutes.
"You can't hold a committee responsible
for a decision," says Assoc. Dean of Student
. iffairs Dan Williams.
But the Stanford administration, faculty
and Board of Trustees hold these groups
responsible for something, and usually it's
called "input." Together they've set up 48
different committees that contain student
members, and such groups are virtually the
only means a student has of "inputting" into
vhe decisions that shape his university.
Three major types of committees exist
here: those impaneled by the University
president, usually under the eye of an
ex-officio member who is a part of the
administration; those of the Academic
Council, governing body of the faculty (these
contain a minority of student members
and a majority from the Council); and those
of the trustees, whose minutes and
deliberations are confidential.
Just what are these committees
accomplishing, and how effective are the
students who serve on them? To find out, the
Daily has conducted an in-depth investigation
of seven committees it believes representative
of the system. No trustee committee is
included; their records are not open to the
press.
Points explored in this investigation
include the amount — and quality — of
student and faculty input; student and faculty
interest, as reflected in attendance records;
the question of possible dominance of a
committee by the official it is intended to
advise; committee harmony and conflicts;
and, finally, the accountability of committee
members to those they represent.
The investigation has revealed that
although participation on committees has
often been inadequate, some committees
stand as monuments to how change in the
University can be achieved by "going through
channels."
C-UAFA: Power Unused
Though most University committees are
admittedly only advisory bodies to an
administrator in their area, the charge of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (C-UAFA) empowers this group
to make certain "determinations."
Among these are the content of application
forms, the number of students to be admitted,
requirements for admission (and exceptions to
these), standards for establishing priority for
financial aid and the types of aid available.
Despite being blessed with such unusual
power, committee members apparently are
not taking advantage of their position. The
reason, in the words of student member
Michael Jennings, is that "[Dean of
Admissions Fred] Hargadon seems to run
things." Committee chairman Paul Green,
professor of biological sciences, said,
"Hargadon influences the committee most.
He's more informed."
Assoc. Physics Prof. Alexander Fetter
agreed that Hargadon "is generally persuasive.
The commiuoe seems to agree with
Hargadon."
Quinn Mayer, student member and now
ASSU vice president, stated, "The committee
is an advisory panel to Dean Hargadon."
Praise for both Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff was nearly
unanimous among C-UAFA members. Some
didn't feel Hargadon's domination of meetings
was detrimental.
"Dean Hargadon will accept a student's
opinion if it is intelligent enough," said
student member Carmen Logan.
Huff said although C-UAFA members "are
not, in effect, running the office . . . they
determine what type of students should be at
Stanford and make sure they can come here
once accepted. We have to follow their
recommendations."
In Mayer's words, Hargadon "is the one
who has access to all the materials and
relevant data."
"I'm expected to know more about
admissions," said Hargadon, pointing out that
committees are only extra-curricular duties
for their members. "Should something go
wrong at an operational level, it's my
responsibility. You don't fire teachers or
expel students for a mistake they make on a
committee."
Some C-UAFA members are unable to
contribute significantly because they lack
expertise. "Those with tenure seem to know a
lot more," said Logan. "There's a definite
disadvantage of students having only
one-year terms." (Mayer is the only
two-termer.)
Meetings often plod along on a fixed
course. "The committee could be more
effective if . . . it didn't stick to such a rigid
agenda," said Logan.
"There is some frustration when things
move slowly and things don't get discussed,"
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel said.
In trying to counter this, Mayer has
found that "we [students J got much more
done when we met with Hargadon
separately."
Official meetings are infrequent. C-UAFA's
charge requires six meetings per year, and the
committee met only that many times.
Huff and Mayer both called for more
meetings. Fetter said, however, that he would
be "much less willing to serve on the
committee if it met too often. 1 have other
obligations within my department."
According to Siegel, "the chairman
[Green j is reluctant to overwork people."
SWOPSI: United Battle
While C-UAFA tends to rely on Hargadon
in deference to his position, the members of
the SWOPSI Policy Board are supportive of
program director Dan Lewis for a d.ifferent
reason: SWOPSI's continuing fight ? for
autonomy.
Student member Chris Elms called Lewis
"clearly the dominant force on the Board."
Faculty members respect Lewis, Elms said,
because he knows a lot about the program's
courses, and students respect him because
they know he has fought for the program for
years. (Lewis has been director since
SWOPSI's inception in 1969, but is resigning
this August.)

Although faculty members contribute far
more than the students, Elms attributed that
to agreement, not intimidation.
Elms, student chairperson Chris Baron and
another student complimented the faculty
members 011 their assistance to students, and
recognized the need for it. Said Elms, "If this
were I only] a student committee, it wouldn't
mean a thing. Students in this university don't
have a clout."
Baron noted that faculty members are
helpful in contributing a realistic view of how
much can be taught in one quarter when the
Board is discussing courses.
Academic standards for courses are the
only significant area of disagreement on this
otherwise united committee. A few members,
such as Elms, feel the Board "worries
sometimes too much whether something has
'sufficient academic rigor,' " thus discouraging
students from teaching courses. But pressure
from the administration has led to tightened
criteria.

Although the Board's main job is approving
courses, it has spent much of its time haggling
with Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs over funds and policies.
Elms expressed concern over what he saw
as the dean's apparent tendency to regard
SWOPSI- as a "proving-ground" for
departmental courses. English Prof. William
Chace, another Board member, said the
program is just "too anarchistic, too sloppy,
too unruly" for Gibbs.
Gibbs has proposed merging SWOPSI with
the Undergraduate Specials program, a
proposal the Board has fought vehemently.
In addition, the dean informed the Board
April 30 that SWOPSI funding for next year
was in question because his reserve funds,
traditionally used for the program, had dried
up. As an economy move, Gibbs also
proposed that full-time staffer Merlyn Payne's
job be reduced to four hours per day; the
Board has opposed this move as well.
Some members have begun to doubt the
Board's effectiveness in the long run and
many have viewed their role in accordance
with Lewis' motto — "Dare to struggle, dare
to stalemate."
Public Events: Yes Men?
The Committee on Public Events appears
to suffer, too, from a dependency on the
administrator whom it oversees. Of 11
committee members the four students and
four faculty do appear to contribute equally
and substantially, but the whole committee's
role in bringing public events to campus is
limited.
According to the 1971 public events policy
manual, the committee "govern[sj all
non-academic, non-athletic programs which
are held ... on University property and which
are open to the public or to all students. . ."
Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti said
the specifics of these performances are carried
out mainly by his office. The primary duty 0/
the committee, he said, is "policy setting not
programming."
Student member 800 Bacon said of the
committee, "It does fulfill public events that a
lot of students are concerned about, but
authority is vested in Tom Bacchetti. He is
capable but his taste can't possibly reflect the
whole Stanford community."
"The committee is just a rubber stamp
committee — it doesn't do much," said
student member Mary Lou Johnson.
A review of the committee minutes shows
that recent business consisted mostly of
reports by Bacchetti.
"We run this institution on an advocacy
system," said Bacchetti. "If somebody can
make a case I'm more than receptive and if
I'm persuaded I'll do it, but we're not going to
overreact to some ideas which aren't fully
realized yet."
"We only appeal to one segment of the
community," said Bacon. "Bacchetti is open
but he's going to go ahead and do what he'll
do unless you can make it [a proposal] seem
solid."
Bacchetti admits that most of the
programming done by his office "tends to be
somewhat conservative ... they are usually
things which complement academic
programming."
Student member Mason Blacher said, "I've
lobbied for University support for
student-initiated theater and drama for one
and a half >ears."
Education Prof. Robert Textor said he too
pushed for mixed offerings.
Blacher blames financial hangups rather
than Bacchetti for the Public Events failings.
"The University recognizes him when he
brings quartets and outside talents rather than
when he helps ... University groups."
Bacon points out that it is the
responsibility of students on the committee
"to have some commitment." He said
students on the committee should frequently
poll the student body, "something we haven't
done."
One student member who did consider
himself effective was ASSU Special Events
Director Dan Scher.
Scher said he was "instrumental" in
scheduling several jazz concerts on campus
next year.

Bacon said he tried to establish a Black
Cultural program next year but Bacchetti said
Bacon's proposals were not all accepted
"because of our financial responsibility to the
University."
C-15: A Virtual Standoff
An unusual milieu of intra-committee
non-cooperation has developed in the
Committee of 15 (C-15), the
faculty-student-administration panel to revise
the student judicial system.
According to two student members,
backlash among faculty members against the
defeat of the C-15 proposal last October has
resulted in a standoff between two sides of
the group.
"They [faculty] felt generous over the
October proposal," said student member
Philip Whistler. The faculty didn't want to
drag along work on a proposal for the entire
year, Whistler said.
The October proposal was overwhelmingly

defeated by students after some key student
members of the C-15 opposed it, claiming that
student judicial rights were not guaranteed.
Whistler said, "There was a standoff in last
year's [October] scheme." He said both sides
had made significant compromises in order to
reach an agreement, and submitted the
proposal because they "thought it was the
best we could get" under the prevailing
circumstances.
The major problem with the C-15 this year
was "too little time to formulate new
proposals" after the October defeat, according
to student member David Herst. Only two
C-15 meetings were held this year.
Student members of the C-15 recently have
proposed a new judicial plan which would
establish a faculty "buffer zone" in judicial
proceedings between students and the
administration.
Under the plan, an all-student panel would
make judicial recommendations to the dean of
students. If he disagreed with them, a separate
faculty board would take up the matter. Its
decision would have to be approved by the
University president.
Herst noted some urgency in the proposal.
He said the present Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) is not a big issue anymore, and"the
ionger you wait [in proposing a new system]
the more legitimate the CJP becomes."
"The judicial system as it now stands is fair
and very efficient and I see no pressure for
change," Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a former
C-15 member, told the Daily April 9.
Business Prof. Harold Leavitt, however,
said in the same issue that "what is really
needed is for students to put forward new
proposals because the faculty and
administration probably won't put forward
anything new." Leavitt is returning to the
C-15 next year.
Whistler felt that extended terms for
student members of C-15 were not necessary.
"It is a good idea to get new people involved
because the older members can get into
terrible ruts," he said.
Faculty Quiet On COSS
A similar schism, though well below the
surface and not manifesting itself publicly,
may affect the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS).
COSS is charged by the University
president to look into areas of student life,

including residences and campus
organizations.
Most agree that faculty input on COSS has
been limited, primarily because the issues the
committee confronts are of little interest to
faculty members. One of three on the
eight-person committee, Asst. Chemistry Prof.
Hans C. Andersen, says, "For the kinds of
things we talked about this year, I can't see
how it [faculty input] was useful."
Other ills afflict COSS, the only University
committee with a student chairman and
student majority. Chairman Bill Rifkin says of
the committee's charge, which requires at
least two meetings per quarter, "We haven't
been living up to it at all."
Now meeting more regularly, COSS has
been involved in revision of the housing draw,
formulation of a report on the need for new

undergraduate housing and establishment of
provisions for selection of residence staffs,
according to Rifkin.
Dealings between the housing office and
COSS bring to light another major drawback
of the committee: adequate representation of
students. Rifkin says "blame was put in the
wrong place" when some students voiced
objections to the transfer of the black theme
house from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia in April.
Rifkin and Andersen agree that the reputed
lack of student input prior to the decision was
the fault of the committee, not Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton. "The
problem isn't between the housing office and
the committee," Rifkin says, "but between
the committee and the student body."
"Five students aren't representative of the
entire student body," Rifkin says. "We have
been blinded to certain issues." Among them
are those involving minorities: COSS' students
are all white.
The main problem with COSS, however,
remains its faculty input. "I haven't been
entirely happy with it,"says chairman Rifkin.
He hastens to add that faculty members on
COSS haven't been uncooperative, but that
schedule conflicts allow them "limited
availability."
These conflicts include simultaneous
P'aculty Senate meetings for two members and
frequent out-of-town trips by the third,
Electrical Engineering Prof. O.G. Villard, who
attended his first meeting May 1.
Another hindrance is the alienation some
faculty members feel toward the business of
COSS. "I found myself not saying too much,"
says Andersen. "Most of the topics seemed
primarily of concern to students."
Andersen is not sure more faculty input is
desirable. Given the nature of COSS, "it's not
obvious you'd want to" increase such input,
he says. "There's no reason to solicit more
faculty input for the issues we had this year."
CEEW: A Woman's Year
"This was the year of the woman student
here," according to senior Barbara Brown,
student member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
The committee's charter states that its
duties include the "improvement of
educational and occupational opportunities"
here and the development of "avenues for
increasing [the number of) women faculty
members."
CEEW succeeded in getting the student
affairs office to establish a "women's
advocate" and persuading the provost's office
to fund a study on the education of women at
Stanford, to be completed next year.
Still, said Brown, "we could have done a
lot more." Problems with the committee
chairmanship marred CEEW's year.
The committee did show several strengths,
according to its members. "We were a
cohesive group this year," said Brown. Most
members of CEEW are women activists, and
disputes concerning goals were rare.
CEEW avoids a problem of other
committees: disinterested members. Graduate
student Barbara Glenn noted this problem,
saying many faculty members "are often
reluctant to serve on a committee." But, she
added, "we had a bunch this year who were
intensely interested in the issues."
Student members, however, have been"the
guiding force of the committee," according to
Amy Metcalfe, assistant to the provost. Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams agreed:
"The women students played as great, or an
even greater role, than the other members."
CEEW lacked a strong leader for much of
the year. "We would often meet and throw
out ideas, but you really need someone to
sum things up, narrow the focus so you can
begin to act on an issue," said Brown.
Metcalfe, who served as acting chairwoman
for the first two quarters, said, "We fell apart
after winter quarter this year." She blamed
the demise on "poor planning in changing the
chairmanship in the middle of the year."
Asst. English Prof. Diane Middlebrook was
appointed to a two-year term as chairwoman in
the fall of last year. She was on leave,
however, until this April, and has not yet
become active in CEEW. The committee met
only once this quarter.
Middlebrook said she was appointed to
CEEW "against my better judgment. I accept
working on committees as part of my job at
Stanford." She thought the committee ran

smoothly this year because "the personalities
were harmonious and cooperative," but sees a
"complete turnover in membership next year"
when she will begin her first year as an active
chairwoman.
Former ASSU Vice President and member
Beth Garfield disagreed with the concept of
committees most widely held in the
University, that of an adviser. She saw the
committee's proper role as "putting pressure
on the appropriate decision-maker."
Garfield wants to change the committee's
focus next year. "Probably too much
emphasis was placed on the students' position

Metcalfe, however, didn't share Garfield's
concern.

here: those impaneled by the University
president, usually under the eye of an
ex-officio member who is a part of the
administration; those of the Academic
Council, governing body of the faculty (these
contain a minority of student members
and a majority from the Council); and those
of the trustees, whose minutes and
deliberations are confidential.
Just what are these committees
accomplishing, and how effective are the
students who serve on them? To find out, the
Daily has conducted an in-depth investigation
of seven committees it believes representative
of the system. No trustee committee is
included; their records are not open to the
press.
Points explored in this investigation
include the amount — and quality — of
student and faculty input; student and faculty
interest, as reflected in attendance records;
the question of possible dominance of a
committee by the official it is intended to
advise; committee harmony and conflicts;
and, finally, the accountability of committee
members to those they represent.
The investigation has revealed that
although participation on committees has
often been inadequate, some committees
stand as monuments to how change in the
University can be achieved by "going through
channels."
C-UAFA: Power Unused
Though most University committees are
admittedly only advisory bodies to an
administrator in their area, the charge of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (C-UAFA) empowers this group
to make certain "determinations."
Among these are the content of application
forms, the number of students to be admitted,
requirements for admission (and exceptions to
these), standards for establishing priority for
financial aid and the types of aid available.
Despite being blessed with such unusual
power, committee members apparently are
not taking advantage of their position. The
reason, in the words of student member
Michael Jennings, is that "[Dean of
Admissions Fred] Hargadon seems to run
things." Committee chairman Paul Green,
professor of biological sciences, said,
"Hargadon influences the committee most.
He's more informed."
Assoc. Physics Prof. Alexander Fetter
agreed that Hargadon "is generally persuasive.
The commiuoe seems to agree with
Hargadon."
Quinn Mayer, student member and now
ASSU vice president, stated, "The committee
is an advisory panel to Dean Hargadon."
Praise for both Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff was nearly
unanimous among C-UAFA members. Some
didn't feel Hargadon's domination of meetings
was detrimental.
"Dean Hargadon will accept a student's
opinion if it is intelligent enough," said
student member Carmen Logan.
Huff said although C-UAFA members "are
not, in effect, running the office . . . they
determine what type of students should be at
Stanford and make sure they can come here
once accepted. We have to follow their
recommendations."
In Mayer's words, Hargadon "is the one
who has access to all the materials and
relevant data."
"I'm expected to know more about
admissions," said Hargadon, pointing out that
committees are only extra-curricular duties
for their members. "Should something go
wrong at an operational level, it's my
responsibility. You don't fire teachers or
expel students for a mistake they make on a
committee."
Some C-UAFA members are unable to
contribute significantly because they lack
expertise. "Those with tenure seem to know a
lot more," said Logan. "There's a definite
disadvantage of students having only
one-year terms." (Mayer is the only
two-termer.)
Meetings often plod along on a fixed
course. "The committee could be more
effective if . . . it didn't stick to such a rigid
agenda," said Logan.
"There is some frustration when things
move slowly and things don't get discussed,"
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel said.
In trying to counter this, Mayer has
found that "we [students J got much more
done when we met with Hargadon
separately."
Official meetings are infrequent. C-UAFA's
charge requires six meetings per year, and the
committee met only that many times.
Huff and Mayer both called for more
meetings. Fetter said, however, that he would
be "much less willing to serve on the
committee if it met too often. 1 have other
obligations within my department."
According to Siegel, "the chairman
[Green j is reluctant to overwork people."
SWOPSI: United Battle
While C-UAFA tends to rely on Hargadon
in deference to his position, the members of
the SWOPSI Policy Board are supportive of
program director Dan Lewis for a d.ifferent
reason: SWOPSI's continuing fight ? for
autonomy.
Student member Chris Elms called Lewis
"clearly the dominant force on the Board."
Faculty members respect Lewis, Elms said,
because he knows a lot about the program's
courses, and students respect him because
they know he has fought for the program for
years. (Lewis has been director since
SWOPSI's inception in 1969, but is resigning
this August.)

Although faculty members contribute far
more than the students, Elms attributed that
to agreement, not intimidation.
Elms, student chairperson Chris Baron and
another student complimented the faculty
members 011 their assistance to students, and
recognized the need for it. Said Elms, "If this
were I only] a student committee, it wouldn't
mean a thing. Students in this university don't
have a clout."
Baron noted that faculty members are
helpful in contributing a realistic view of how
much can be taught in one quarter when the
Board is discussing courses.
Academic standards for courses are the
only significant area of disagreement on this
otherwise united committee. A few members,
such as Elms, feel the Board "worries
sometimes too much whether something has
'sufficient academic rigor,' " thus discouraging
students from teaching courses. But pressure
from the administration has led to tightened
criteria.

Although the Board's main job is approving
courses, it has spent much of its time haggling
with Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs over funds and policies.
Elms expressed concern over what he saw
as the dean's apparent tendency to regard
SWOPSI- as a "proving-ground" for
departmental courses. English Prof. William
Chace, another Board member, said the
program is just "too anarchistic, too sloppy,
too unruly" for Gibbs.
Gibbs has proposed merging SWOPSI with
the Undergraduate Specials program, a
proposal the Board has fought vehemently.
In addition, the dean informed the Board
April 30 that SWOPSI funding for next year
was in question because his reserve funds,
traditionally used for the program, had dried
up. As an economy move, Gibbs also
proposed that full-time staffer Merlyn Payne's
job be reduced to four hours per day; the
Board has opposed this move as well.
Some members have begun to doubt the
Board's effectiveness in the long run and
many have viewed their role in accordance
with Lewis' motto — "Dare to struggle, dare
to stalemate."
Public Events: Yes Men?
The Committee on Public Events appears
to suffer, too, from a dependency on the
administrator whom it oversees. Of 11
committee members the four students and
four faculty do appear to contribute equally
and substantially, but the whole committee's
role in bringing public events to campus is
limited.
According to the 1971 public events policy
manual, the committee "govern[sj all
non-academic, non-athletic programs which
are held ... on University property and which
are open to the public or to all students. . ."
Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti said
the specifics of these performances are carried
out mainly by his office. The primary duty 0/
the committee, he said, is "policy setting not
programming."
Student member 800 Bacon said of the
committee, "It does fulfill public events that a
lot of students are concerned about, but
authority is vested in Tom Bacchetti. He is
capable but his taste can't possibly reflect the
whole Stanford community."
"The committee is just a rubber stamp
committee — it doesn't do much," said
student member Mary Lou Johnson.
A review of the committee minutes shows
that recent business consisted mostly of
reports by Bacchetti.
"We run this institution on an advocacy
system," said Bacchetti. "If somebody can
make a case I'm more than receptive and if
I'm persuaded I'll do it, but we're not going to
overreact to some ideas which aren't fully
realized yet."
"We only appeal to one segment of the
community," said Bacon. "Bacchetti is open
but he's going to go ahead and do what he'll
do unless you can make it [a proposal] seem
solid."
Bacchetti admits that most of the
programming done by his office "tends to be
somewhat conservative ... they are usually
things which complement academic
programming."
Student member Mason Blacher said, "I've
lobbied for University support for
student-initiated theater and drama for one
and a half >ears."
Education Prof. Robert Textor said he too
pushed for mixed offerings.
Blacher blames financial hangups rather
than Bacchetti for the Public Events failings.
"The University recognizes him when he
brings quartets and outside talents rather than
when he helps ... University groups."
Bacon points out that it is the
responsibility of students on the committee
"to have some commitment." He said
students on the committee should frequently
poll the student body, "something we haven't
done."
One student member who did consider
himself effective was ASSU Special Events
Director Dan Scher.
Scher said he was "instrumental" in
scheduling several jazz concerts on campus
next year.

Bacon said he tried to establish a Black
Cultural program next year but Bacchetti said
Bacon's proposals were not all accepted
"because of our financial responsibility to the
University."
C-15: A Virtual Standoff
An unusual milieu of intra-committee
non-cooperation has developed in the
Committee of 15 (C-15), the
faculty-student-administration panel to revise
the student judicial system.
According to two student members,
backlash among faculty members against the
defeat of the C-15 proposal last October has
resulted in a standoff between two sides of
the group.
"They [faculty] felt generous over the
October proposal," said student member
Philip Whistler. The faculty didn't want to
drag along work on a proposal for the entire
year, Whistler said.
The October proposal was overwhelmingly

defeated by students after some key student
members of the C-15 opposed it, claiming that
student judicial rights were not guaranteed.
Whistler said, "There was a standoff in last
year's [October] scheme." He said both sides
had made significant compromises in order to
reach an agreement, and submitted the
proposal because they "thought it was the
best we could get" under the prevailing
circumstances.
The major problem with the C-15 this year
was "too little time to formulate new
proposals" after the October defeat, according
to student member David Herst. Only two
C-15 meetings were held this year.
Student members of the C-15 recently have
proposed a new judicial plan which would
establish a faculty "buffer zone" in judicial
proceedings between students and the
administration.
Under the plan, an all-student panel would
make judicial recommendations to the dean of
students. If he disagreed with them, a separate
faculty board would take up the matter. Its
decision would have to be approved by the
University president.
Herst noted some urgency in the proposal.
He said the present Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) is not a big issue anymore, and"the
ionger you wait [in proposing a new system]
the more legitimate the CJP becomes."
"The judicial system as it now stands is fair
and very efficient and I see no pressure for
change," Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a former
C-15 member, told the Daily April 9.
Business Prof. Harold Leavitt, however,
said in the same issue that "what is really
needed is for students to put forward new
proposals because the faculty and
administration probably won't put forward
anything new." Leavitt is returning to the
C-15 next year.
Whistler felt that extended terms for
student members of C-15 were not necessary.
"It is a good idea to get new people involved
because the older members can get into
terrible ruts," he said.
Faculty Quiet On COSS
A similar schism, though well below the
surface and not manifesting itself publicly,
may affect the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS).
COSS is charged by the University
president to look into areas of student life,

including residences and campus
organizations.
Most agree that faculty input on COSS has
been limited, primarily because the issues the
committee confronts are of little interest to
faculty members. One of three on the
eight-person committee, Asst. Chemistry Prof.
Hans C. Andersen, says, "For the kinds of
things we talked about this year, I can't see
how it [faculty input] was useful."
Other ills afflict COSS, the only University
committee with a student chairman and
student majority. Chairman Bill Rifkin says of
the committee's charge, which requires at
least two meetings per quarter, "We haven't
been living up to it at all."
Now meeting more regularly, COSS has
been involved in revision of the housing draw,
formulation of a report on the need for new

undergraduate housing and establishment of
provisions for selection of residence staffs,
according to Rifkin.
Dealings between the housing office and
COSS bring to light another major drawback
of the committee: adequate representation of
students. Rifkin says "blame was put in the
wrong place" when some students voiced
objections to the transfer of the black theme
house from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia in April.
Rifkin and Andersen agree that the reputed
lack of student input prior to the decision was
the fault of the committee, not Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton. "The
problem isn't between the housing office and
the committee," Rifkin says, "but between
the committee and the student body."
"Five students aren't representative of the
entire student body," Rifkin says. "We have
been blinded to certain issues." Among them
are those involving minorities: COSS' students
are all white.
The main problem with COSS, however,
remains its faculty input. "I haven't been
entirely happy with it,"says chairman Rifkin.
He hastens to add that faculty members on
COSS haven't been uncooperative, but that
schedule conflicts allow them "limited
availability."
These conflicts include simultaneous
P'aculty Senate meetings for two members and
frequent out-of-town trips by the third,
Electrical Engineering Prof. O.G. Villard, who
attended his first meeting May 1.
Another hindrance is the alienation some
faculty members feel toward the business of
COSS. "I found myself not saying too much,"
says Andersen. "Most of the topics seemed
primarily of concern to students."
Andersen is not sure more faculty input is
desirable. Given the nature of COSS, "it's not
obvious you'd want to" increase such input,
he says. "There's no reason to solicit more
faculty input for the issues we had this year."
CEEW: A Woman's Year
"This was the year of the woman student
here," according to senior Barbara Brown,
student member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
The committee's charter states that its
duties include the "improvement of
educational and occupational opportunities"
here and the development of "avenues for
increasing [the number of) women faculty
members."
CEEW succeeded in getting the student
affairs office to establish a "women's
advocate" and persuading the provost's office
to fund a study on the education of women at
Stanford, to be completed next year.
Still, said Brown, "we could have done a
lot more." Problems with the committee
chairmanship marred CEEW's year.
The committee did show several strengths,
according to its members. "We were a
cohesive group this year," said Brown. Most
members of CEEW are women activists, and
disputes concerning goals were rare.
CEEW avoids a problem of other
committees: disinterested members. Graduate
student Barbara Glenn noted this problem,
saying many faculty members "are often
reluctant to serve on a committee." But, she
added, "we had a bunch this year who were
intensely interested in the issues."
Student members, however, have been"the
guiding force of the committee," according to
Amy Metcalfe, assistant to the provost. Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams agreed:
"The women students played as great, or an
even greater role, than the other members."
CEEW lacked a strong leader for much of
the year. "We would often meet and throw
out ideas, but you really need someone to
sum things up, narrow the focus so you can
begin to act on an issue," said Brown.
Metcalfe, who served as acting chairwoman
for the first two quarters, said, "We fell apart
after winter quarter this year." She blamed
the demise on "poor planning in changing the
chairmanship in the middle of the year."
Asst. English Prof. Diane Middlebrook was
appointed to a two-year term as chairwoman in
the fall of last year. She was on leave,
however, until this April, and has not yet
become active in CEEW. The committee met
only once this quarter.
Middlebrook said she was appointed to
CEEW "against my better judgment. I accept
working on committees as part of my job at
Stanford." She thought the committee ran

smoothly this year because "the personalities
were harmonious and cooperative," but sees a
"complete turnover in membership next year"
when she will begin her first year as an active
chairwoman.
Former ASSU Vice President and member
Beth Garfield disagreed with the concept of
committees most widely held in the
University, that of an adviser. She saw the
committee's proper role as "putting pressure
on the appropriate decision-maker."
Garfield wants to change the committee's
focus next year. "Probably too much
emphasis was placed on the students' position
this year," she said. "We really need to take
up staff issues next year."
Metcalfe, however, didn't share Garfield's
concern.
Thus CEEW may be faced with its first

intra-committee dispute which would disturb
the present homogeneity of membership.
CUS: Inhibited Students
Charged by the Academic Council to
formulate "policies governing the structure of
the undergraduate curriculum," changes in
degree programs and the academic advising
system, the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has been quite active, according
to many of its members. Some student
delegates to CUS, however, apparently have
remained dormant.
CUS' accomplishments for 1973-74 are
apparently many, though few are tangible. Its
central problem rests with student
involvement: only three of its 10 members,
CUS' charge dictates, may be undergraduate
students. The remainder are from the
Academic Council, and the resulting
dominance prompted one of the student
members, Betty Muth, to comment, "I always
had the feeling I wasn't being taken seriously
by some faculty on the committee."
An inspection of the minutes of CUS' first
14 meetings this year indicates a dominance
of contributions by faculty members. It
reveals a startling fact: except for an exchange
on the policies of the ASSU Nominations
Committee at CUS' first meeting, student
member and now-ASSU President Mike
Herman had not made a single recorded
contribution to CUS meetings until the one of
May 8.
"[Herman| is not a frequent contributor,"
says Dean of Undergra'duate Studies James
Gibbs, an ex-officio member of CUS. But,
Gibbs says, "when Herman does
[contribute], it's something valuable."
CUS Chairman Richard A. Brody, assistant
professor of political science, agreed with
Gibbs. "Herman is a solid guy. He doesn't say
much but when he does it's something good."
"Word for jvord, I myself don't contribute
as much as some members," Herman admits.
But, he says, "my contribution has been as
great as the other students' [Betty Muth and
Tom Wattles]
Muth disagrees, "I don't think either one
of the guys contributes very much. There's
many meetings where he [Herman] doesn't
say anything."
Herman attributes his lack of mention in
CUS minutes to a subconscious bias in favor
of faculty members on the part of committee
secretary Alice Supton. He said he found
"most upsetting" the dearth of student
comments in the minutes.
Supton admits, "It might be that
unconsciously I didn't pay attention to
students." However, she insists her minutes
"pretty much do" reflect the relative
contributions. "I just found that Mike didn't
say as much."
Imagined or not, Herman's
non-contribution reflects a major concern of
CUS: the amount and worth of student input.
"It's variable," Gibbs says of student input.
"There are some issues students are not
interested in."
"The students are pretty general
contributors ... an important part of the
system," says chairman Brody.
Muth paints a less rosy picture. "The
problem is that faculty are reluctant to
change. They use the committee as an
instrument to define what we already have."
"The main problem [for students] is
continuity," says Gibbs. It takes one quarter
for them to learn how it [committee]
operates."
Muth strongly agrees: "Student
appointments [now one year] should be
longer," she says. "This year I've just gotten a
taste."
Investigation Summary
These seven committees can be taken to
represent the committee system in
microcosm. From their cases, a number of
problems stand out:
—Some faculty serve on committees only
as part of what they consider an "unwritten
obligation." Others serve by their own
request, and seem to become more involved
(as on CEEW) rather than disinterested (as on
COSS).
—Faculty attendance is often spotty. When
Faculty Senate members serve on committees
as well, schedule conflicts often arise. And
faculty members often find it difficult to
attach the same importance to committee
memberships that they do to their classes.
—Student views are sometimes given short
shrift. On CUS, for example, student members
perceive that their contributions are valued
less than those of faculty members. On
CEEW, on the other hand, faculty members'
active interest in student views — and greater
initiative and effort on the part of student
members — have proved effective.
—Committees intended as policy-setting
groups often defer to the "superior
knowledge" of the administrators they are
supposed to oversee. As a result, committees
often act solely on administrators'
recommendations — instead of undertaking
more independent deliberations.
—Faculty are currently given three-year
terms, while students are generally limited to
one year. In committees of a continuing
nature, such as C-US and C-UAFA, this
limitation hampers student input.
—While the ASSU currently requires
student committee members to file reports of
their performance, the Academic Council does
not request such reports. The
"accountability" of all committee members is
unclear.
—Committee meetings are not open to
effective press coverage. Confidentiality is
important to some committees (such as C-15),
but student and faculty skepticism of secret
deliberations may hamper input. Greater
monitoring and publicity might help both
student and faculty members to be more
effective.
Next year, the ASSU Council of Presidents
plans to assign a student staff assistant to each
committee's student members. ASSU
President Mike Herman says "better liaison
between student government and students on
committees" will result from the posts.
