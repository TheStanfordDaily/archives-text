Dairy Funds Go To House Members
WASHINGTON — The nation's three largest
dairy-farmer cooperatives made political donations of from
$100 to $11,000 to at least 16 members of the House
Judiciary Committee, which is investigating allegations that
President Nixon was influenced by contributions from the
same groups.
The recipients include committee chairman Peter W.
Rodino, whose urban New Jersey district has no dairy
farmers in it. An aide said Rodino didn't ask for the money,
and said he could not explain why the cooperatives gave it
to the congressman from Newark.
Two of the recipients gave back the money after The
Associated Press questioned them about it. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., gave back $100 he received last March, and Thomas
Railsback, R-111., returned $500 he received in 1972.
Nixon To Visit Mideast
WASHINGTON — The White House formally announced
President Nixon's June 12-18 swing through five Middle
East countries yesterday, pledging to build on the success
of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's peace missions.
The journey to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Israel and
Jordan will "ratify the new environment that now exists in
the area" said spokesman Gerald Warren in outlining plans
for the most extensive Middle East tour ever undertaken by
a U.S. President.
Rodino Panel To Interview Colson
WASHINGTON — Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr.,
D-N.J.. of the House Judiciary Committee said yesterday
that the panel's impeachment staff will interview Charles W.
Colson to determine if the former Nixon aide should be
called as a witness.
Rodino declined to say when the staff would talk to

Colson, who pleaded guilty on Monday to obstruction of
justice and promised to cooperate with the special
Watergate prosecutor.
The chairman made the announcement at a briefing after
the committee had spent nearly seven hours in closed
session hearing evidence on the White House involvement in
the ITT antitrust settlement.
POW, Meredith Win Primaries
A former prisoner of war dedicated to the political
downfall of Sen. George S. McGovern won the Republican
senatorial nomination in South Dakota; and a civil rights
figure of a decade ago reached a runoff for a Democratic
congressional nomination in Mississippi, in primary contests
last night.
In South Dakota, Leo Thorsness, a retired Air Force
colonel who spent six years in a North Vietnamese prison
camp, defeated two opponents in the Republican senatorial
primary. He will face McGovern, whom he vowed to unseat
because of McGovern's antiwar views during the 1972
presidential campaign.
James Meredith, whose enrollment at the University of
Mississippi in 1962 touched off riots, outpolled five other
candidates in a Democratic congressional primary in
Mississippi. Meredith failed to get 50 percent of the vote
and will face runnerup Kenneth Dean, a white civil rights
advocate, in a runoff June 25.
FBI Cheeks Alleged New SLA Threat
SAN FRANCISCO - The FBI said yesterday it is
checking out an alleged communique from the "New
Symbionese Liberation Army" which threatened to kill
police.
"It appears to have no connection with the matter under
investigation," said FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Charles
Bates.
"We have gotten a number of such letters around the
country. Everybody seems to want to get into the act,
everybody wants to be a field marshall."
The handwritten note, delivered by an unidentified male
messenger Monday night to radio station KFRC, bore the
engraved seal of the SLA's seven-headed cobra.

In South Dakota, Leo Thorsness, a retired Air Force

presidential campaign.

Mississippi in 1962 touched off riots, outpolled five other

advocate, in a runoff June 25.
FBI Cheeks Alleged New SLA Threat
SAN FRANCISCO - The FBI said yesterday it is
checking out an alleged communique from the "New
Symbionese Liberation Army" which threatened to kill
police.
"It appears to have no connection with the matter under
investigation," said FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Charles
Bates.
"We have gotten a number of such letters around the
country. Everybody seems to want to get into the act,
everybody wants to be a field marshall."
The handwritten note, delivered by an unidentified male
messenger Monday night to radio station KFRC, bore the
engraved seal of the SLA's seven-headed cobra.
Today's Weather

Dairy Funds Go To House Members
WASHINGTON — The nation's three largest
dairy-farmer cooperatives made political donations of from
$100 to $11,000 to at least 16 members of the House
Judiciary Committee, which is investigating allegations that
President Nixon was influenced by contributions from the
same groups.
The recipients include committee chairman Peter W.
Rodino, whose urban New Jersey district has no dairy
farmers in it. An aide said Rodino didn't ask for the money,
and said he could not explain why the cooperatives gave it
to the congressman from Newark.
Two of the recipients gave back the money after The
Associated Press questioned them about it. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., gave back $100 he received last March, and Thomas
Railsback, R-111., returned $500 he received in 1972.
Nixon To Visit Mideast
WASHINGTON — The White House formally announced
President Nixon's June 12-18 swing through five Middle
East countries yesterday, pledging to build on the success
of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's peace missions.
The journey to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Israel and
Jordan will "ratify the new environment that now exists in
the area" said spokesman Gerald Warren in outlining plans
for the most extensive Middle East tour ever undertaken by
a U.S. President.
Rodino Panel To Interview Colson
WASHINGTON — Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr.,
D-N.J.. of the House Judiciary Committee said yesterday
that the panel's impeachment staff will interview Charles W.
Colson to determine if the former Nixon aide should be
called as a witness.
Rodino declined to say when the staff would talk to

Colson, who pleaded guilty on Monday to obstruction of
justice and promised to cooperate with the special
Watergate prosecutor.
The chairman made the announcement at a briefing after
the committee had spent nearly seven hours in closed
session hearing evidence on the White House involvement in
the ITT antitrust settlement.
