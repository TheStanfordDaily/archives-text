# Voters Axe Rent Control, Approve Public Transit
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
Palo Alto voters strongly rejected
the formation of a city rent control
board by defeating Proposition B in
yesterday's election.
With 90 percent of the Palo Alto
precincts reporting, votes against the
proposition outnumbered votes for it
by a margin of better than two to one.
The initiative, strongly opposed by
the Palo Alto City Council, would
have created a rent control board to
regulate rents and promote high
maintenance standards by landlords.
Opponents of Proposition B,
including the Palo Alto chapter of the
NAACP and Palo Alto Mayor Kirke
Comstock, charged that the measure
would discourage construction and
maintenance of rental housing.
The measure's supporters, led by
the Fair Rent Committee, claimed it
would end rent gouging by local
landlords.
Support Transit Funds
Voters in Santa Clara County
approved the use of motor vehicle
revenues for public mass transit in the
county by passing Proposition A. The
measure can take effect only if state
Proposition 5 is voted in; with more
than half of the state vote in,
Proposition 5 appeared certain of
passage.
With over 60 percent of the county
precincts reporting, "yes" votes for
Proposition A led by 98,000 to
48,000.
In the third Board of Equalization

district, which includes Stanford,
Republican voters gave financial
consultant Tally Mastrangelo a strong
lead over his opponent in the primary
election. With most precincts
reporting, Mastrangelo held better
than a three-to-two lead.
The Republican candidate will
oppose Democratic incumbent William
Bennetts in the November general
election. Members of the Board of
Equalization have wide control over
tax collection and assessment.
Non-Partisan Elections
Non-partisan primary elections for
many county positions also took place
yesterday. Incumbent James Scott
defeated his opponent, Paul Teilh, in
the race for Superior Court Judge.
Tax assessor Dwight Mathiesen was
returned to office by a resounding
margin as he gained 64 percent of the
vote in his four-way race. Since
Mathiesen garnered a majority of the
vote there will be no runoff election
for assessor.
In local state legislature primaries,
Democrats selected incumbent Arlen
Gregorio to run for state senate in the
tenth district and Victor Calvo as
candidate for state assemblyman
from the 21st district. Both were
unopposed.
Their Republican opponents in
November will be James Tormey, who
won the nomination to oppose
Gregorio by defeating opponent
Donald Spicer; and Clarence Jackson,
who defeated two rivals.

Tax assessor Dwight Mathiesen was
returned to office by a resounding
margin as he gained 64 percent of the
vote in his four-way race. Since
Mathiesen garnered a majority of the
vote there will be no runoff election
for assessor.
In local state legislature primaries,
Democrats selected incumbent Arlen
Gregorio to run for state senate in the
tenth district and Victor Calvo as
candidate for state assemblyman
from the 21st district. Both were
unopposed.
Their Republican opponents in
November will be James Tormey, who
won the nomination to oppose
Gregorio by defeating opponent
Donald Spicer; and Clarence Jackson,
who defeated two rivals.
Palo Alto voters strongly rejected
the formation of a city rent control
board by defeating Proposition B in
yesterday's election.
With 90 percent of the Palo Alto
precincts reporting, votes against the
proposition outnumbered votes for it
by a margin of better than two to one.
The initiative, strongly opposed by
the Palo Alto City Council, would
have created a rent control board to
regulate rents and promote high
maintenance standards by landlords.
Opponents of Proposition B,
including the Palo Alto chapter of the
NAACP and Palo Alto Mayor Kirke
Comstock, charged that the measure
would discourage construction and
maintenance of rental housing.
The measure's supporters, led by
the Fair Rent Committee, claimed it
would end rent gouging by local
landlords.
Support Transit Funds
Voters in Santa Clara County
approved the use of motor vehicle
revenues for public mass transit in the
county by passing Proposition A. The
measure can take effect only if state
Proposition 5 is voted in; with more
than half of the state vote in,
Proposition 5 appeared certain of
passage.
With over 60 percent of the county
precincts reporting, "yes" votes for
Proposition A led by 98,000 to
48,000.
In the third Board of Equalization

district, which includes Stanford,
Republican voters gave financial
consultant Tally Mastrangelo a strong
lead over his opponent in the primary
election. With most precincts
reporting, Mastrangelo held better
than a three-to-two lead.
The Republican candidate will
oppose Democratic incumbent William
Bennetts in the November general
election. Members of the Board of
Equalization have wide control over
tax collection and assessment.
Non-Partisan Elections
Non-partisan primary elections for
many county positions also took place
yesterday. Incumbent James Scott
defeated his opponent, Paul Teilh, in
the race for Superior Court Judge.
