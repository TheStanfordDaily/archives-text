# Independent Inventor Brainstorms Nifty Gadgets
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Lloyd Turner is his own genie. Unlike most
inventors, he works independently, shunning
the confinement of corporate research — the
bottle which holds so many inventors captive.
His mind steams with ideas which he
pursues at will, rather than at the beck and
call of an employer. In the crowded alcove of
his roomy old house in Los Gatos, Turner
brainstorms nifty gadgets into existence.
'The number of inventors who work out of
their basement," explained Jake Rabinow,
director of the U.S. Office of Invention, "and
who make a living off their royalties is very,
very small." Rabinow says he knows of only
two successful cases. "This guy Turner may
make the third," he conjectured.
Turner, in his somewhat unorganized
fashion, has made more money as an inventor
over the past 14 years than he ever did as an
architect or teacher. Turner taught a class in
architecture here in the early sixties. Now he
brings in about $30,000 annually. With luck,
he may tramp in the silver-lined footsteps of
inventors who make millions off a single,
seemingly simple invention. Turner has
invented a safety bottle top — which he calls
"child-proof" — to keep youngsters out of
medicines and toxic substances.

"He's uniquely sensitive to other people's
needs," explained a friend and former business
associate.
Enjoys Challenges
"People know I'm an inventor," Turner
explained, "and they come to me with things
that bug them." A friend who owned an
irregularly shaped swimming pool, for
example, complained he couldn't find a pool
cover to fit it. So Turner invented a disposable
one which comes as liquid in a bottle and,
when poured on the water, covers like oil and
hardens into "a kind of form-fitting saran
wrap," he explained. He then patented and
marketed it.
Although children's tastes are harder to
second-guess, Turner has thrilled millions
around the world with his toy the
"Arrow-Copter" which grossed four to five
million dollars, a business associate claims.
Rocketing 250 feet into the sky, the toy,
which Turner claims is "virtually
indestructable" but not "loss-proof," then
descends slowly, whirling like a helicopter.
He demonstrated the idea in his living room
by making a paper model out of an envelope.
Enraptured with the spinning miniature, he
took his guest outside to show off the real
thing.

Unlike the captive inventor who must
accept research assignments, the independent
inventor needs to be resourceful in discovering
needs to fill. Turner conceived his
"child-proof" bottle top after deliberately
pursuing a tip that Congress planned to enact
legislation requiring that toxic, household
substances be marketed in containers with
security closures.
Search For Ideas
Turner toured the country to chat with
pharmacists, container manufacturers and
spokesmen for the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
"I wanted to fill myself with all the input I
could get," he said almost ravenously. "I
asked them, 'What would be the ideal cap?' "
And then he invented it: a cheap, simple,
one-piece "Press-Top" that would deter even
young Hercules.
"The problem was to find a cap that would
befuddle children without befuddling the less
intelligent and the little old ladies with
arthritis," explained Robert McKim,
mechanical engineering professor here who
also patented a safety cap but had no luck
marketing it.
According to a local pharmacist who has
been a guinea pig testing Turner's caps,

"Turner's got the best cap I've seen. Just this
week I had to send two cases [of other kinds
of safety tops] back because they were too
complicated to work."
Turner's flat snap-top is as simple to
operate and as cheap as any ordinary one. "It
doesn't require double action like some of
these new kinds do. There's no gripping and
turning of parts simultaneously," the
pharmacist explained. "You just press the cap
down and the lid pries itself off."
Helps Arthritics
It takes 15 pounds of downward pressure
to release the top. This amounts to 30 pounds
pressure per square inch if spread over the area
of an adult's thumb — or 100 pounds spread
over the baby finger. Children, thus, are
frustrated, but an arthritic, for example, is not
because there's "no bending of joints
required," Turner explained.
In late 1970, President Nixon signed the
Poison Prevention Packaging Act that required
toxic substances be sold in containers with
safety tops. Over 72,000 young children were
being accidentally poisoned each year.
Roughly 87 percent were under five years old.
