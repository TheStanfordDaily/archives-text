## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
About 2000 graduates, more than
at any time in the past decade, are
expected to participate in this year's
commencement exercises. The
University will award more than 4000
graduate and undergraduate degrees in
ceremonies that will begin at 10 a.m.
Sunday, June 16 in Frost
Amphitheater.
Former Watergate Special
Prosecutor Archibald Cox will address
the 1974 senior class as
commencement speaker.
All available tickets for the
commencement have been issued,
Public Events Director Thomas
Bacchetti reported. "This is the first
time in the 10 years I have been
associated with Stanford that we have
run out of tickets and have not been
able to meet the demand for
additional ones," he said.
Each graduating student is entitled
to four tickets and may request up to
four extra tickets. Bacchetti asked that

students return tickets they will not
need.
Seniors can rent caps and gowns at
the bookstore from June 10 through
June 14. Students may sign a waiver
indicating that their $5 cap and gown
deposit be given to the African Famine
Relief Fund, the United Farm Workers
of America or the United Stanford
Employees hardship fund once they
have returned the cap and gown.
These three organizations were
"most frequently suggested" in
student responses to a questionnaire, a
flyer and a letter in the Daily, Senior
Class Officer Debbie Stinchfield said.
In other senior activities, a senior
"boogie" is scheduled for 8 p.m.
Thursday, June 13 in the Lagunita
dining hall. A small admission fee will
be charged.
Weekend ceremonies begin at 8
p.m. Friday, June 14 with the Phi Beta
Kappa initiation in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Math Prof. Paul Berg,
Stanford Phi Beta Kappa chapter
president, will chair the ceremonies
and Admissions Dean Fred Hargadon
will speak.
The senior-parent luncheon will
begin at 11:30 a.m. Saturday in the
Bowman Alumni House grove. Assoc.
History Prof. David Kennedy and
Biology Department Chairman
Norman K. Wessels will speak and the
class will present its gift to the
Optacon fund.
Baccalaureate services in Memorial
Church will begin at 2:30 p.m. with
Chapel Dean Robert G.H. Kelly
officiating. Rena Karefa-Smart,
lecturer in religion and black studies at
Wellesley College, will speak.
Dedication of the senior class

activities.
