# 'Quad' Returns After Two-Year Yearbook Void
## 
### 
After a two-year absence, the Quad
has returned.
Distribution continues today from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Quad office in
the courtyard of the Storke
Publications Building on Lomita Drive.
As of yesterday morning, less than
50 of the 2000 books remained to be
sold and Publisher Mason Blacher
predicted those would be gone by the
end of the day. If any remain, they
will be sold today at the Quad office
for $10.
Blacher said that he "recognized
there was a quality problem" with the
book, but noted that there were "so
many other problems with starting up
the book" that quality had to be third
priority to financial security and
getting the book out on time. Blacher
added that top priority next year will
be the improvement of the pictures,
particularly in the senior section.
Business Manager Kevin McDermott
estimated that the Quad will make in
excess of $4000 profit above the
$6000 donations that were secured
from various University departments
at the beginning of the year.
The $6000 in one-time gifts has
been placed in a reserve fund and will
be used, along with this year's profit,
to start off next year.
Both McDermott and Blacher
confirmed that the Quad would
publish next year, and said they were
trying to hold the cost to $10, the
same amount the book sold for in
1969.
Next year's editor will be
sophomore Rick Everist, one of the
current section editors. Junior Tim
Portwood will be the next business
manager and McDermott will take on
the job of publishing liaison.
