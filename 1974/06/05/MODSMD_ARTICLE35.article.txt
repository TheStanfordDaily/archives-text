# Center For Research On Women Receives University Recognition
## 
### AMY SABRIN 
The Center for Research on Women
(CROW), an unfocused idea in the
minds of a few students a year ago,
will receive $20,000 from the
University this month, and with it,
official recognition as a
University-sponsored project affiliated
with the Center for Interdisciplinary
Research.
Vice Provost for Research William
Massy, whose office allocates money
for research, said CROW will officially
receive the grant as soon as Provost
William Miller and the deans sign the
necessary forms. Massy said he expects
this to happen in the next few weeks.
The grant is "seed money," to be
used primarily to hire three part-time
staff members — a coordinator for the
center's information clearinghouse, a
secretary and a research associate to
coordinate the center's research
activities and search for permanent
funding.
The center's goals are two-fold,
according to graduate student Sue
Heck, a member of CROW's policy
board. "We hope to promote and
support research about women, and
equally as important, we hope to
promote and enhance the education of
women at Stanford," she said.
Task Force
Plans for CROW's future activities
include establishing a task force on
academic advising to look at
counseling for women, a task force on
the lecture series to continue the
weekly luncheon series inaugurated
this year and a network of student
representatives to serve as a means of
communication between CROW and
academic departments.
There will also be a clearinghouse
committee of students and volunteers
to compile an information bank of
research on women being done at
Stanford and in the Bay Area, to
collect information on scholarships,
job opportunities and training
programs and on research centers and
women's studies programs at other
universities.
CROW members think they will
have little trouble obtaining outside
funding for their future projects.

Cindy Davis, another student policy
board member, points to an increased
interest in research on women by
foundations and other sources of
support.
Additional Grant
CROW has already received an
additional $10,000 grant from the
Robert Sterling Grant Foundation.
This grant will provide matching funds
for academic departments bringing
women scholars here to give special
seminars.
But research is the center's main
objective, according to policy board
members. "Ultimately, our long-range
goal is to establish a permanent
research and policy center on women
at Stanford," said former ASSU Vice

President Beth Garfield. However, she
and other members insist their center
will not conform to the usual
conception of research institutes.
The center also hopes to involve
undergraduates and to sponsor
research that will provide information
for both the academic and general
community, according to Myra
Strober, assistant professor at the
Graduate School of Business.
'Cross-Fertilization'
"We hope for a cross-fertilization
between research and the educational
process. Research will reflect the
questions of students and be relevant
to their present education," she added.
Student member Suzi Harmatz said
she hopes CROW will expose female

students to women scholars who are
leaders in their fields.
CROW began last year when a
group of anthropology students and
professors realized a need for
coordination and stimulation of
research on women in their own field.
Energy generated by students and
faculty, combined with a detailed
budget and policy statement,
convinced Massy's office that there
would be long-term academic interest
in CROW, said Pat Devaney, Massy's
assistant.
CROW sponsored a lecture series
this year in which women discussed
their research, including China, the
media and government policy.

CROW sponsored a lecture series
this year in which women discussed
their research, including China, the
media and government policy.
The Center for Research on Women
(CROW), an unfocused idea in the
minds of a few students a year ago,
will receive $20,000 from the
University this month, and with it,
official recognition as a
University-sponsored project affiliated
with the Center for Interdisciplinary
Research.
Vice Provost for Research William
Massy, whose office allocates money
for research, said CROW will officially
receive the grant as soon as Provost
William Miller and the deans sign the
necessary forms. Massy said he expects
this to happen in the next few weeks.
The grant is "seed money," to be
used primarily to hire three part-time
staff members — a coordinator for the
center's information clearinghouse, a
secretary and a research associate to
coordinate the center's research
activities and search for permanent
funding.
The center's goals are two-fold,
according to graduate student Sue
Heck, a member of CROW's policy
board. "We hope to promote and
support research about women, and
equally as important, we hope to
promote and enhance the education of
women at Stanford," she said.
Task Force
Plans for CROW's future activities
include establishing a task force on
academic advising to look at
counseling for women, a task force on
the lecture series to continue the
weekly luncheon series inaugurated
this year and a network of student
representatives to serve as a means of
communication between CROW and
academic departments.
There will also be a clearinghouse
committee of students and volunteers
to compile an information bank of
research on women being done at
Stanford and in the Bay Area, to
collect information on scholarships,
job opportunities and training
programs and on research centers and
women's studies programs at other
universities.
CROW members think they will
have little trouble obtaining outside
funding for their future projects.

Cindy Davis, another student policy
board member, points to an increased
interest in research on women by
foundations and other sources of
support.
Additional Grant
CROW has already received an
additional $10,000 grant from the
Robert Sterling Grant Foundation.
This grant will provide matching funds
for academic departments bringing
women scholars here to give special
seminars.
But research is the center's main
objective, according to policy board
members. "Ultimately, our long-range
goal is to establish a permanent
research and policy center on women
at Stanford," said former ASSU Vice

President Beth Garfield. However, she
and other members insist their center
will not conform to the usual
conception of research institutes.
The center also hopes to involve
undergraduates and to sponsor
research that will provide information
for both the academic and general
community, according to Myra
Strober, assistant professor at the
Graduate School of Business.
'Cross-Fertilization'
"We hope for a cross-fertilization
between research and the educational
process. Research will reflect the
questions of students and be relevant
to their present education," she added.
Student member Suzi Harmatz said
she hopes CROW will expose female

students to women scholars who are
leaders in their fields.
CROW began last year when a
group of anthropology students and
professors realized a need for
coordination and stimulation of
research on women in their own field.
Energy generated by students and
faculty, combined with a detailed
budget and policy statement,
convinced Massy's office that there
would be long-term academic interest
in CROW, said Pat Devaney, Massy's
assistant.
