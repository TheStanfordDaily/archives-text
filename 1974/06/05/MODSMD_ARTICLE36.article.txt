# Charges 'Unfair Treatment'
## Flores May File Suit 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Asst. German Prof. Juan Flores said
Monday that he was "thinking of filing
a legal suit for unfair treatment"
regarding the University's handling of
his appeal of the decision to deny him
tenure.
"They've left me with the
possibility of staying here for one year
as a lame-duck professor," Flores said.
Flores was given what he termed "a
year of grace," but he said it was only
"possible" that he will be back next
autumn.
In a May 17 letter to Vice President
and Provost William Miller, Flores
officially appealed the decision of
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Halsey Royden to deny the German
Studies Department's recommendation
for promotion to a tenured position.
Flores claimed that Royden's
decision was influenced by political
bias and clouded by ambiguous criteria
for promotion.
Miller responded to Flores' letter
last Thursday, saying that it was
"sufficient in detail for the inquiry to
proceed." Earlier, Miller appointed
Vice Provost Arthur I. Bienenstock to
investigate the matter.
Miller's letter said that both
Royden and acting Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Lawrence V.
Ryan have been asked to respond to
Flores' allegations.
Miller's memo also outlined his
view of how his office should handle
grievances such as this. "We seek to
determine whether the criteria in
procedures appropriate to the decision
were invoked by those who made the
decision," it stated.
The office also tried to determine if
there were facts "sufficient to make
the decision against those criteria,"
and given the appropriate criteria and
facts, whether the decision was "a
reasonable one."
Flores charged Monday that the
procedure "doesn't leave too much of
a possibility of being considered."
Flores said that since he "hadn't
really expected the decision," he
didn't make any plans for leaving next
year. But he said he has a possible job
offer from Cambridge or a job in the
area of Puerto Rican studies in New
York City.
One of the important disagreements
surrounding the dispute regarded
published material. Flores has claimed
that the one book and one scholarly
article he has published is enough to
warrant his promotion to associate
professor.
Although Royden said the work is
not enough to grant Flores tenure,
Flores has insisted that the high
quality of the publications compensate
for any lack of quantity.
Another complaint by Flores was
that Assoc. Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Lewis Spitz "was at least
partially instrumental in the
decision-making in my case" and was
biased against him for political
reasons. Flores claimed that Spitz
objected to his left-wing political
views.
