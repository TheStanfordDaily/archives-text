# Beginning Next Winter Quarter
## Lecture Note Service Available 
### MARTHA ADAMS 
The lecture note service, proposed
by ASSU President Mike Herman's
slate during the recent campaign, will
be implemented next winter quarter,
according to a business plan completed
recently by Herman and ASSU
Financial Manager Dave Martin.
During the first quarter of
operation, notes will be available for
15 to 18 classes having enrollment
greater than 200. This number is
expected to increase over time,
according to the plan, and should level
out at about 60 to 70 courses per

quarter.
"It's important that people realize
that we're experimenting this first
quarter. We'll take a small first step,"
Herman said.
Notes will be taken by students
who have a "concentration in the
subject," have previously enrolled in
the class and achieved an "A", and
who have approval of the professor
teaching the course.
Pay Scale
The note-takers will be paid $5.25
(undergraduate) and $6 (graduate) per
lecture, although it will probably take

30-55 additional minutes to type the
notes up.
The lectures will be printed on a
mimeograph machine and distributed
at the Lecture Note Service Office at
the main ASSU office on the second
floor of Tresidder Union.
The rate schedule for the first year
will be: $4 per 10-week quarter for
two lecture hours per week, $6 for
three lecture hours a week and $8 for
four hours a week.
An average of 57 students would
have to subscribe to the service if 15
courses are covered for the program to
break even at the end of the year.
Attendance Question
Herman said that student
attendance in classes covered by the
program probably won't drop
significantly. Surveys taken at other
schools with lecture note programs
indicated that class attendance has not
dropped appreciably after notes
became available, Herman noted.
He added that some faculty
members were worried about having
their original ideas, as copied down in
the notes, being used in other people's
books or articles.
Consideration is being given to
copyrighting the notes either to the
ASSU or to the professors themselves
to prevent having the notes used
unscrupulously, Herman stated.
Herman is optimistic about the
program's future. "I think on a limited
basis, such as we're starting with,
people will be very satisfied with the
notes and the way we have them set
up now. I just don't want people to
think that at every class, every seminar
— every time you walk into a closet,
you're going to come out with notes."

who have approval of the professor
teaching the course.
Pay Scale
The note-takers will be paid $5.25
(undergraduate) and $6 (graduate) per
lecture, although it will probably take

30-55 additional minutes to type the
notes up.
The lectures will be printed on a
mimeograph machine and distributed
at the Lecture Note Service Office at
the main ASSU office on the second
floor of Tresidder Union.
The rate schedule for the first year
will be: $4 per 10-week quarter for
two lecture hours per week, $6 for
three lecture hours a week and $8 for
four hours a week.
An average of 57 students would
have to subscribe to the service if 15
courses are covered for the program to
break even at the end of the year.
Attendance Question
Herman said that student
attendance in classes covered by the
program probably won't drop
significantly. Surveys taken at other
schools with lecture note programs
indicated that class attendance has not
dropped appreciably after notes
became available, Herman noted.
He added that some faculty
members were worried about having
their original ideas, as copied down in
the notes, being used in other people's
books or articles.
Consideration is being given to
copyrighting the notes either to the
ASSU or to the professors themselves
to prevent having the notes used
unscrupulously, Herman stated.
Herman is optimistic about the
program's future. "I think on a limited
basis, such as we're starting with,
people will be very satisfied with the
notes and the way we have them set
up now. I just don't want people to
think that at every class, every seminar
— every time you walk into a closet,
you're going to come out with notes."
The lecture note service, proposed
by ASSU President Mike Herman's
slate during the recent campaign, will
be implemented next winter quarter,
according to a business plan completed
recently by Herman and ASSU
Financial Manager Dave Martin.
During the first quarter of
operation, notes will be available for
15 to 18 classes having enrollment
greater than 200. This number is
expected to increase over time,
according to the plan, and should level
out at about 60 to 70 courses per

quarter.
"It's important that people realize
that we're experimenting this first
quarter. We'll take a small first step,"
Herman said.
Notes will be taken by students
who have a "concentration in the
subject," have previously enrolled in
the class and achieved an "A", and
who have approval of the professor
teaching the course.
