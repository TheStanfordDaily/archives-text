# Joffrey's Opening Displays Polish
## 
### JANICE ROSS 
SAN FRANCISCO—The New
York City Center Joffrey Ballet
occupies a unique position in
today's dance world. It functions
as both the caretaker of many of
contemporary ballet's classics, as
well as the purveyor for some of
the most original avant-garde
ballet being done in America
today.
Last Tuesday's opening night
program in the Opera House
afforded San Franciscans an
excellent opportunity to see this
versatile and polished company in
action.
On opening night, the Joffrey
presented Gerald Arpino's
Kettentanz and his Secret Places,
Twyla Tharp's As Time Goes By,
and Jerome Robbins' N. Y. Export
op. Jazz. Although all four dances
were exceptionally well staged,
Tharp's As Time Goes By was the
most impressive of the evening's
dances because of its originality
and clarity.
Tharp is a choreographer
dancer of unusual talent; in
addition to a thorough
background in classical ballet, she
had also studied extensively with
Merce Cunningham, the
acknowledged master of
avant-garde modern dance. As a
result of this exposure, Tharp's
choreographic style is an
intriguing blend of the clarity and
precision of the ballet vocabulary,
combined with the spontaneity
and freedom of modern dance.
For the typical ballet-goer
however, Tharp's dance, /Is Time
Goes By, appears hopelessly
disorganized and formless.
Kinetic
Set to the third and fourth

movements of Haydn's Farewell
Symphony, As Time Goes By is in
a sense a kinetic translation of the
music. Beginning in silence with a
single dancer, the music and
movement build to an amazing
jumble of heads, arms, legs, tones
and rhythms. But at the end of
the piece, the stage is vacant
except for a lone dancer lazily
executing movements to the
accompaniment of one violin.
Costumed in various muted
shades of grey, white and black,
the dancers looked as if they wore
rehearsal costumes, thus
contributing to the dance's feeling
of informality.
The apparant pandemonium on
stage that was so intriguing to the
unfettered eye and probably so
offensive to the sensibilities of
many ballet connoisseurs was
really the result of an elaborate
system of complicated and
delicately timed movements.
Understatement
Tharp's choreography is
designed to understate and
de-emphasize the performer's
virtuosity. Rather than strive for
precisely unison corps-de-ballet
movement, Tharp fragments a

phrase by having a group of
dancers perform similar
movements, but in varying
tempos, orders and directions.
Just when it looks as if the
dancers are at last going to do a
unison sequence, someone begins
twitching his head, or intently
examining his fast-working feet,
and suddenly it's everyone for
himself.
What Tharp has done here is to
bend and distort traditional ballet
movements and dismantle the
traditional structure of the dance
as a whole in order to recombine
her neo-classical ballet phrases in
an almost random fashion. The
result is stunning. Through her
non-traditional approach Tharp
succeeds in teaching us more
about the special beauty of ballet
than many of the more formal
and traditional choreographers.
Tharp's conception of
choreography is similar to
Cunningham's notion of dance
where everyone is a soloist. The
rationale is that since rarely, if
ever, do we see unison movement
in real life, why then should we
expect it on the stage?
The effect of Tharp's kind of

movement anarchy is like viewing
a Hieronymus Bosch painting;
There is so much activity going on
that one can't possibly absorb all
he sees, much less know where to
look next.
Fine Performance
It is a credit to the abilities of
the Joffrey dancers, especially
Beatriz Rodriguez and Larry
Gremier that they were able to
carry off a dance as difficult and
as rich as As Time Goes By with
such elan.
The evening's other ballets,
especially N. Y. Export op. Jazz
(1958) were pallid in comparison.
Purporting to be an interpretation
of the youth's dance style in the
late fifties, Export provided an
interesting kinetic commentary on
the current resurgence of interest
in American-Graffitti style
memorabilia, without really
offering any new insights. Despite
the clever costumes, sets, and
music, Robbins' choreography
was caught in that awful
inbetween; too good to be Kitsch
and yet too old to be really
exciting.
Finishing Numbers
Kettantanz and Secret Places

rounded out the evening's
performance. Kettantam is a
delightful stylized tribute to the
lively and gay waltzes and polkas
of the Johann Strauss era. Many
of the group line configurations
were reminiscent of folk-style
chain dances where the dancers
weave through one another
without losing their formal
organization. In these individual
sections of Kettantam the Joffrey
dancers once again displayed their
superb technique.
Secret Places, a romantic duet
set to Mozart's Piano Concerto
No. 21, is a delicate study of two
young lovers. The lighting for this
dance was beautiful, providing the
right atmosphere of subtlety and
expectation for the first few silent
passages of the shy lovers.
Tuesday's performance again
proved that the Joffrey is one of
the best ballet companies in
America. Perhaps more important
than their technical virtuosity
however, is their choice of
material, which shows a strong
interest in both preserving the
quality of contemporary dance
and in changing the face of ballet
in America today.

carry off a dance as difficult and

The evening's other ballets,

(1958) were pallid in comparison.
Purporting to be an interpretation
of the youth's dance style in the
late fifties, Export provided an
interesting kinetic commentary on
the current resurgence of interest
in American-Graffitti style
memorabilia, without really
offering any new insights. Despite
the clever costumes, sets, and

was caught in that awful

Kettantanz and Secret Places

rounded out the evening's
performance. Kettantam is a
delightful stylized tribute to the
lively and gay waltzes and polkas
of the Johann Strauss era. Many
of the group line configurations
were reminiscent of folk-style
chain dances where the dancers
weave through one another
without losing their formal
organization. In these individual
sections of Kettantam the Joffrey
dancers once again displayed their
superb technique.
Secret Places, a romantic duet
set to Mozart's Piano Concerto
No. 21, is a delicate study of two
young lovers. The lighting for this
dance was beautiful, providing the
right atmosphere of subtlety and
expectation for the first few silent
passages of the shy lovers.
Tuesday's performance again
proved that the Joffrey is one of
the best ballet companies in
America. Perhaps more important
than their technical virtuosity
however, is their choice of
material, which shows a strong
interest in both preserving the
quality of contemporary dance
and in changing the face of ballet
in America today.
SAN FRANCISCO—The New
York City Center Joffrey Ballet
occupies a unique position in
today's dance world. It functions
as both the caretaker of many of
contemporary ballet's classics, as
well as the purveyor for some of
the most original avant-garde
ballet being done in America
today.
Last Tuesday's opening night
program in the Opera House
afforded San Franciscans an
excellent opportunity to see this
versatile and polished company in
action.
On opening night, the Joffrey
presented Gerald Arpino's
Kettentanz and his Secret Places,
Twyla Tharp's As Time Goes By,
and Jerome Robbins' N. Y. Export
op. Jazz. Although all four dances
were exceptionally well staged,
Tharp's As Time Goes By was the
most impressive of the evening's
dances because of its originality
and clarity.
Tharp is a choreographer
dancer of unusual talent; in
addition to a thorough
background in classical ballet, she
had also studied extensively with
Merce Cunningham, the
acknowledged master of
avant-garde modern dance. As a
result of this exposure, Tharp's
choreographic style is an
intriguing blend of the clarity and
precision of the ballet vocabulary,
combined with the spontaneity
and freedom of modern dance.
For the typical ballet-goer
however, Tharp's dance, /Is Time
Goes By, appears hopelessly
disorganized and formless.
Kinetic
Set to the third and fourth

movements of Haydn's Farewell
Symphony, As Time Goes By is in
a sense a kinetic translation of the
music. Beginning in silence with a
single dancer, the music and
movement build to an amazing
jumble of heads, arms, legs, tones
and rhythms. But at the end of
the piece, the stage is vacant
except for a lone dancer lazily
executing movements to the
accompaniment of one violin.
Costumed in various muted
shades of grey, white and black,
the dancers looked as if they wore
rehearsal costumes, thus
contributing to the dance's feeling
of informality.
The apparant pandemonium on
stage that was so intriguing to the
unfettered eye and probably so
offensive to the sensibilities of
many ballet connoisseurs was
really the result of an elaborate
system of complicated and
delicately timed movements.
Understatement
Tharp's choreography is
designed to understate and
de-emphasize the performer's
virtuosity. Rather than strive for
precisely unison corps-de-ballet
movement, Tharp fragments a

phrase by having a group of
dancers perform similar
movements, but in varying
tempos, orders and directions.
Just when it looks as if the
dancers are at last going to do a
unison sequence, someone begins
twitching his head, or intently
examining his fast-working feet,
and suddenly it's everyone for
himself.
What Tharp has done here is to
bend and distort traditional ballet
movements and dismantle the
traditional structure of the dance
as a whole in order to recombine
her neo-classical ballet phrases in
an almost random fashion. The
result is stunning. Through her
non-traditional approach Tharp
succeeds in teaching us more
about the special beauty of ballet
than many of the more formal
and traditional choreographers.
Tharp's conception of
choreography is similar to
Cunningham's notion of dance
where everyone is a soloist. The
rationale is that since rarely, if
ever, do we see unison movement
in real life, why then should we
expect it on the stage?
The effect of Tharp's kind of

movement anarchy is like viewing
a Hieronymus Bosch painting;
There is so much activity going on
that one can't possibly absorb all
he sees, much less know where to
look next.

unfettered eye and probably so
offensive to the sensibilities of
many ballet connoisseurs was
really the result of an elaborate
system of complicated and
delicately timed movements.
Understatement
Tharp's choreography is
designed to understate and
de-emphasize the performer's
virtuosity. Rather than strive for
precisely unison corps-de-ballet
movement, Tharp fragments a

phrase by having a group of
dancers perform similar
movements, but in varying
tempos, orders and directions.
Just when it looks as if the
dancers are at last going to do a
unison sequence, someone begins
twitching his head, or intently
examining his fast-working feet,
and suddenly it's everyone for
himself.
What Tharp has done here is to
bend and distort traditional ballet
movements and dismantle the
traditional structure of the dance
as a whole in order to recombine
her neo-classical ballet phrases in
an almost random fashion. The
result is stunning. Through her
non-traditional approach Tharp
succeeds in teaching us more
about the special beauty of ballet
than many of the more formal
and traditional choreographers.
Tharp's conception of
choreography is similar to
Cunningham's notion of dance
where everyone is a soloist. The
rationale is that since rarely, if
ever, do we see unison movement
in real life, why then should we
expect it on the stage?
The effect of Tharp's kind of

movement anarchy is like viewing
a Hieronymus Bosch painting;
There is so much activity going on
that one can't possibly absorb all
he sees, much less know where to
look next.
Fine Performance
It is a credit to the abilities of
the Joffrey dancers, especially
Beatriz Rodriguez and Larry
Gremier that they were able to
carry off a dance as difficult and
as rich as As Time Goes By with
such elan.
The evening's other ballets,
especially N. Y. Export op. Jazz
(1958) were pallid in comparison.
Purporting to be an interpretation
of the youth's dance style in the
late fifties, Export provided an
interesting kinetic commentary on
the current resurgence of interest
in American-Graffitti style
memorabilia, without really
offering any new insights. Despite
the clever costumes, sets, and
music, Robbins' choreography
was caught in that awful
inbetween; too good to be Kitsch
and yet too old to be really
exciting.
Finishing Numbers
Kettantanz and Secret Places

rounded out the evening's
performance. Kettantam is a
delightful stylized tribute to the
lively and gay waltzes and polkas
of the Johann Strauss era. Many
of the group line configurations
were reminiscent of folk-style
chain dances where the dancers
weave through one another
without losing their formal
organization. In these individual
sections of Kettantam the Joffrey
dancers once again displayed their
superb technique.
Secret Places, a romantic duet
set to Mozart's Piano Concerto
No. 21, is a delicate study of two
young lovers. The lighting for this
dance was beautiful, providing the
right atmosphere of subtlety and
expectation for the first few silent
passages of the shy lovers.
Tuesday's performance again
proved that the Joffrey is one of
the best ballet companies in
America. Perhaps more important
than their technical virtuosity
however, is their choice of
material, which shows a strong
interest in both preserving the
quality of contemporary dance
and in changing the face of ballet
in America today.
SAN FRANCISCO—The New
York City Center Joffrey Ballet
occupies a unique position in
today's dance world. It functions
as both the caretaker of many of
contemporary ballet's classics, as
well as the purveyor for some of
the most original avant-garde
ballet being done in America
today.
Last Tuesday's opening night
program in the Opera House
afforded San Franciscans an
excellent opportunity to see this
versatile and polished company in
action.
On opening night, the Joffrey
presented Gerald Arpino's
Kettentanz and his Secret Places,
Twyla Tharp's As Time Goes By,
and Jerome Robbins' N. Y. Export
op. Jazz. Although all four dances
were exceptionally well staged,
Tharp's As Time Goes By was the
most impressive of the evening's
dances because of its originality
and clarity.
Tharp is a choreographer
dancer of unusual talent; in
addition to a thorough
background in classical ballet, she
had also studied extensively with
Merce Cunningham, the
acknowledged master of
avant-garde modern dance. As a
result of this exposure, Tharp's
choreographic style is an
intriguing blend of the clarity and
precision of the ballet vocabulary,
combined with the spontaneity
and freedom of modern dance.
For the typical ballet-goer
however, Tharp's dance, /Is Time
Goes By, appears hopelessly
disorganized and formless.
Kinetic
Set to the third and fourth

movements of Haydn's Farewell
Symphony, As Time Goes By is in
a sense a kinetic translation of the
music. Beginning in silence with a
single dancer, the music and
movement build to an amazing
jumble of heads, arms, legs, tones
and rhythms. But at the end of
the piece, the stage is vacant
except for a lone dancer lazily
executing movements to the
accompaniment of one violin.
Costumed in various muted
shades of grey, white and black,
the dancers looked as if they wore
rehearsal costumes, thus
contributing to the dance's feeling
of informality.
