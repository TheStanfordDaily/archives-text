# Summer 'Spectrum'
## 
### 
The Stanford Summer Daily
will begin publication June 25,
and will continue to print a
weekly "Entertainment
Spectrum."
Submissions for "Summer
Spectrum" should be sent to the
entertainment editor at Storke
Student Publications Building by
noon of the Wednesday before
publication. Submissions for the
June 28 "Spectrum" will be
accepted until noon on
Wednesday, June 26.
Due to space limitations,
events on campus or in the
Stanford vicinity will receive first
consideration, and all
announcements should be brief.
Announcement in "Spectrum"
does not guarantee that the event
will be reviewed by the Daily.
