# Brown, Flournoy Take Primary; Political Reform Measure Wins
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
California voters yesterday chose
state Controller Houston Flournoy
and Secretary of State Edmund G.
Brown Jr. to battle for the
governorship in November.
Republican Flournoy scored a
sweeping victory over Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke, currently under indictment
for perjury in the ITT case. Brown,
son of the two-term former governor,
scored an easy victory over a large
Democratic field.
Voters also nominated incumbent
Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston and
Republican state Sen. H.L. Richardson
for the Senate race, and passed a
sweeping initiative aimed at political

reform.
In the vote for governor, Flournoy
led Reinecke by 69 percent to 31
percent, with about 20 percent of the
vote counted. Brown led the
Democratic pack with 36 percent,
trailed by San Francisco Mayor Joseph
Alioto with 20 percent; Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti with 17 percent;
financier William Matson Roth with 14
percent; and Rep. Jerome Waldie with
11 percent.
In the Senate race, Cranston rolled
up some 85 percent against two
political unknowns, while Richardson
— a former member of the John Birch
Society — garnered 65 percent of the
vote in a surprisingly easy victory over

former Reagan Administration official
Earl Brian (28 percent) and three
lesser contenders.
Political Reform
Proposition 9, the controversial
political reform initiative sponsored by
Common Cause, the People's Lobby
and the Ralph Nader organization,
appeared headed for an impressive
victory. It had 69 percent support,
against 31 percent in opposition.
The margin of victory for
Proposition 9 — partially written and

strongly supported by Brown — was
surprisingly large. The initiative was
strongly opposed by organized labor,
and the state AFL-CIO went so far as
to withdraw its support of Brown for
governor because of his stand on the
measure.
The only other measure that
aroused any controversy was
Proposition 5, which will allow
diversion of highway users' fees to
public mass transit.
All other state propositions
appeared assured of passage except
Proposition 7, which would have
allowed five state positions to be
removed from civil service.
In the race for lieutenant governor,
state Sen. Mervyn Dymally captured
the Democratic nomination, defeatirrg
state Sen. Lawrence Walsh, attorney

Howard Miller and attorney John
Merlo.
State Sen. John Harmer of
Glendale, one of the legislature's most
conservative members, was virtually
tied for the GOP nomination with
former Nixon Administration official
John Veneman early this morning.
Attorney General
Attorney William A. Norris received
the Democratic nomination for
attorney general with 62 percent,
defeating former Los Angeles Deputy

Dist. Atty. Vincent Bugliosi, with 38
percent. Incumbent Atty. Gen. Evelle
J. Younger was unopposed for the
Republican nomination.
Oakland Assemblywoman March
Fong was the apparent winner in a
close battle for the Democratic
nomination for secretary of state over
Assemblyman Walter Karabian and
college lecturer Cathy O'Neill. Brian
Van Camp, a former Reagan
Administration official, won the
Republican nomination over a divided
field.
Republican Assemblyman William
Bagley scored an easy victory in the
race for the controller nomination,
rolling up 52 percent to 27 percent for
Los Angeles attorney James Flournoy,
his nearest competitor. Assemblymnn



'GUV STORY' — Edmund Brown Jr. (r.) racked up a plurality against his
opponents in last night's Democratic gubernatorial primary, while Republican
Houston Flournoy scored a resounding victory over Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke for his
party's nomination for governor.
