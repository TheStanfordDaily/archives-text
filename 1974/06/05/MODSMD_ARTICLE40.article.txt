# Second Night Shows Same Skills
## 
### CHRIS SHERRY 
The Joffrey came to town
again last week. They were,
predictably, a delight; they were
also, surprisingly, much more
grown up. Wednesday evening at
the Opera House seemed an
unusually subdued performance
for the company, yet was, for the
most part, quite effective.
The program opener, Ashton's
The Dream, was enjoyable if not
wholly satisfying; the company is
not yet completely at home in the
classic-romantic tradition, and the
corps was adequate but missed the
smooth confidence and charm of
the Royal Ballet interpretation.
The overall effect of the work
is pleasantly hypnotic, but not
transporting; Becky Wright
showed an impressive sense of
lyricism as Titania though she
lacks the essential majesty and
mystery, and Burton Taylor's
Oberon is strong if somewhat
self-conscious. Fortunately,
Russell Sultzbach as the ingenious
Puck and Larry Grenier as the
clumsily appealing Bottom
together pulled it off, with the
help of a beautiful set, the antics
of the four lovers, and a billowing
veil of fog which concealed the

magic.
Perfect Performance
On the other hand, Limon's
The Moor's Pavane worked
perfectly, with a highly charged
tension matched by a cool sense
of restraint. Lighting and
costumes were rich but
beautifully understated, and Jan
Harriman was perfect as the
Moor's wife, intense yet reserved
in both movement and face.
Christian Holder as the Moor was
overwhelming; a huge towering
figure, his image dominates in the
formal ritualistic patterns of the
quartet. His arms expand and
envelop all; he entirely captures
the fatal sense of jealousy and
betrayal that pervades the work.
The rendition was tremendously
dramatic, tremendously moving.
Interplay, a 1945 Jerome
Robbins number with music by
Morton Gould, rounded out the
evening; enjoyable as always, it is
typical Joffrey fare, light and
happy with abundant displays of
technical virtuosity from
Francesca Corkle, Charthel Arthur
and Edward Vesco. It is in this
kind of crowd-pleasing, innocent
exuberance and sharp allegro that
the company excels.

Friday evening was an entirely
different story; the house was
packed and buzzing in
anticipation of the two Arpino
rock works, with a revival from
1917 stuck in between. Parade, a
collaborative effort of Erik Satie,
Leonid Massine, Jean Cocteau and
Pablo Picasso, proved fascinating,
though certainly not as shocking
as it must have been When
premiered in Paris more than 50
years ago.
Circus Theme
The dance is based on a circus
theme, where the performers try
to entice the audience with
something new and unfamiliar but
don't quite succeed; the piece
itself evokes a tentative reaction
from the general public even
today, given its highly unusual
flavor.
Drawing from the art of
surrealism and Cubism, Parade is
compelling in its fantastic scenio
designs and mechanistic music;
Gary Chryst is a superlative
Chinese conjurer, often seemingly
suspended in mid-air, and Donna
Cowen is brilliantly self-mocking
as the saucy little American girl.
The towering figures of the
managers are both comic and

awesome, and the work as a whole
leaves one confused and unsettled,
a little reluctant but highly
intrigued.
Sacred Grove on Mount
Tamalpais, conceived in Marin in
1971, was entirely beautiful, with
a natural appeal to San
Franciscans. Based on the ancient
ritual of earth renewal and on the
idea of a divine wedding and
conception, the dance is both
mystical and erotic, imparting an
overwhelming sense of
celebration. The score is
delightful, a rock-symphonic
combination; Starr Danias as the
bride is absolutely beguiling and
Sultzback as the divine son is
almost disarming in his
extraordinary balance and ease of
elevation that is seemingly
effortless.
Finale
The finale, Trinity, also
originated in the San
Francisco-Berkeley area and is a
tribute to the 60s, to the
loneliness and love of street
people and to the belief of those
who participated in peace
marches. It is not a literal tribute,
indeed, it is the vibrant and gutsy
dancing that overwhelms the
viewer, but one cannot view
Trinity without a nostalgia for
the sincerity of that era. Again,
Wright, Holder, and Chryst were
in total command, and the feeling
of community and pride clearly
comes through.
The Joffrey's greatest attribute
has always been their infectious
spirit-daring, irreverent, alive. But
it is heartening to see the
company maturing, taking on the
challenges of a broader repertoire.
The drama of The Moor's Pavane,
the imagination of Parade, even
the less than polished classical
refinement of The Dream, all
point to a new image of Joffrey
which will go beyond the
youthful energy of their highly
American style.
