# Grad Student Display
## Artwork Exhibit: 'Exciting' 
### BARBARA HEINS 
Lithographs, paintings, and
contemporary sculpture make up
the Graduate Students' Exhibition
now on view at the Stanford Art
Gallery. It is a surprising and very
exciting exhibition.
The show is a series of
different worlds and atmospheres.
Each reflects the individual artist's
approach both to his subject
matter and particular medium.
The world of Stephen Schultz
is inhabited mostly by nude
women, painted while relaxing in
chairs, sofas and on benches. The
colors in his large paintings are
almost eerie: deadly greens, deep
blues, dull reds. Over the surface
of the works are scattered tiny
aggressive strokes of bright oil
crayon. This gives each painting a
shimmery, luminous quality and
accents areas touched by light.
The works are set either in even,
cool, artificial light or the golden
accenting light of sunset which
shines on a knee or shoulder and
leaves the rest in shadow.
The women themselves remain
solid shapes: often they are
treated with less importance than
the area surrounding them. They
remain anonymous, their
disproportionately small heads
hidden by shadow, eyes never
directly meeting those of the
viewer. The poses are studied,
unmoving. A strong contrast is
created between the agitated
sparkle of the overlaid crayon and
the dulled, even underpainting
and planted poses.
One of the most exciting works
is called Reflected Figure in which
the picture plane is slanted up so
that the figure almost falls out at
the viewer's feet. The light
reflecting off of the shoulder,
breast and hands is Bonnard-like
in its pink shimmered color set
against the deep satiny blue
material below.
Accompanying the paintings
are many drawings and oil pastels
by Schultz. Here the line jumps
back and forth over the paper in
search of form. There is a much
greater sense of solidity, of
modelled weight in the drawings
than in the paintings. The color is
purer, more vibrant, with hot reds
and oranges jumping out of the
forms and contrasting with the
white of the paper backgrounds.
The world of Marcia Morse's
lithographs is a very calm,
intimate, introspective one. Using

simple geometric shapes and
designs she creates quiet, lovely
patterns. On close studying,
rigidity disappears in the tiny,
active lines of soft color. The
series explores the gradations and
blending of color to create an
awareness of each individual
color, alone and as merged with
another.
The Veil Studies are incredibly
beautiful and fragile. As
monochrome lithographs, each
gradation of line becomes an
important element and beautiful
form. The prints are
non-figurative and formal. One
must spend time with the works
and become familiar with them in
order to capture the infinite
changes and variety to be found in
each sequence. The artist says her
works "rejoice in being
lithographs." Each work explores
the technique of soft crayon on
hard stone, transferred to ink and
paper.
After the quiet intimacy of
Marcia Morse's room, Margo
Humphrey-McDanieFs is an
explosion of color. The images in
her works are thematic and
personal, reflecting "fact and
fantasy as a black in the late 20th
Century."
The works, mostly lithographs,
all reflect a wry sense of humor
and a love of color and line. The
lithographs concerning such
subjects as huge, steaming yams
and bowls of beans, are filled with
colors that jump out of the
frames.
Bright reds, deep blues, greens
and yellows are all placed next to
each other in crowded space. The
works all seem optimistic in this
series, one group even called
"Celebration." Although the artist
calls her style "sophisticated
naivete," her mastery of the
lithographic technique is anything
but naive.
There is also a whimsical
watercolor series depicting the
world of the carnival. The color
harmonies are more subtle, but no
less beautiful. Tiny pen and ink
people and animals roam around
the compositions.
In a group of monotypes,
Margo deals with more general
themes, her imagery deriving from
newly interpreted ancient African
symbols and stream of
consciousness reflections. These
works are much less finished and
more fanciful than the other

series.
Perhaps the most exciting
works by Margo Humphrey-
McDaniel are her depictions of
black faces. These works, both in
colored lithographs and
monotypes are incredibly
powerful, capturing subtle
expressions with strong lines and
color harmonies.
In the center of two of the
rooms is the result of Gary
Zerrilla's preoccupation with
seashells. Huge shells are displayed
on the floor, some measuring 4 to
8 feet. The result of exploration
of the variety of shapes, textures
and coloration of actual shells,
many of these could pass for real
if not for their size. Zerrilla's
works are fascinating because by
enlarging them to a monstrous
size, we are able to view and
realize the beautiful and varied
shapes of common objects in
nature.
In the front room are five
strange white shapes,
three-dimensional forms out of
which various sounds can be heard
at certain times of the day. This
sophisticated electronic art,
created by Peter Yackulics, is an
attempt by the artist to force the
viewer/listener to become acutely
conscious of invisibly delineated
space.
In one work, two facing
wall-mounted cylinders are
covered with white muslin with a
round slightly curved form on the
floor between them. Behind the
muslin are parabolic reflectors
that produce a strobosonic effect,
or sound beams.
In one series of sounds, called
"Surf and Wind," a very realistic
wind blows between the two
facing cylinders, with the waves
crashing against the surf from the
round cylinder below.
The five artists have spent two
years in the studio art program at
Stanford, and will receive their
master's degrees next month. The
exhibition will continue through
June 16.

beautiful and fragile. As
monochrome lithographs, each
gradation of line becomes an
important element and beautiful
form. The prints are
non-figurative and formal. One
must spend time with the works
and become familiar with them in
order to capture the infinite
changes and variety to be found in
each sequence. The artist says her
works "rejoice in being
lithographs." Each work explores
the technique of soft crayon on
hard stone, transferred to ink and
paper.
After the quiet intimacy of
Marcia Morse's room, Margo
Humphrey-McDanieFs is an
explosion of color. The images in
her works are thematic and
personal, reflecting "fact and
fantasy as a black in the late 20th
Century."
The works, mostly lithographs,
all reflect a wry sense of humor
and a love of color and line. The
lithographs concerning such
subjects as huge, steaming yams
and bowls of beans, are filled with
colors that jump out of the
frames.
Bright reds, deep blues, greens
and yellows are all placed next to
each other in crowded space. The
works all seem optimistic in this
series, one group even called
"Celebration." Although the artist
calls her style "sophisticated
naivete," her mastery of the
lithographic technique is anything
but naive.
There is also a whimsical
watercolor series depicting the
world of the carnival. The color
harmonies are more subtle, but no
less beautiful. Tiny pen and ink
people and animals roam around
the compositions.
In a group of monotypes,
Margo deals with more general
themes, her imagery deriving from
newly interpreted ancient African
symbols and stream of
consciousness reflections. These
works are much less finished and
more fanciful than the other

series.
Perhaps the most exciting
works by Margo Humphrey-
McDaniel are her depictions of
black faces. These works, both in
colored lithographs and
monotypes are incredibly
powerful, capturing subtle
expressions with strong lines and
color harmonies.
In the center of two of the
rooms is the result of Gary
Zerrilla's preoccupation with
seashells. Huge shells are displayed
on the floor, some measuring 4 to
8 feet. The result of exploration
of the variety of shapes, textures
and coloration of actual shells,
many of these could pass for real
if not for their size. Zerrilla's
works are fascinating because by
enlarging them to a monstrous
size, we are able to view and
realize the beautiful and varied
shapes of common objects in
nature.
In the front room are five
strange white shapes,
three-dimensional forms out of
which various sounds can be heard
at certain times of the day. This
sophisticated electronic art,
created by Peter Yackulics, is an
attempt by the artist to force the
viewer/listener to become acutely
conscious of invisibly delineated
space.
In one work, two facing
wall-mounted cylinders are
covered with white muslin with a
round slightly curved form on the
floor between them. Behind the
muslin are parabolic reflectors
that produce a strobosonic effect,
or sound beams.
In one series of sounds, called
"Surf and Wind," a very realistic
wind blows between the two
facing cylinders, with the waves
crashing against the surf from the
round cylinder below.
The five artists have spent two
years in the studio art program at
Stanford, and will receive their
master's degrees next month. The
exhibition will continue through
June 16.
Lithographs, paintings, and
contemporary sculpture make up
the Graduate Students' Exhibition
now on view at the Stanford Art
Gallery. It is a surprising and very
exciting exhibition.
The show is a series of
different worlds and atmospheres.
Each reflects the individual artist's
approach both to his subject
matter and particular medium.
The world of Stephen Schultz
is inhabited mostly by nude
women, painted while relaxing in
chairs, sofas and on benches. The
colors in his large paintings are
almost eerie: deadly greens, deep
blues, dull reds. Over the surface
of the works are scattered tiny
aggressive strokes of bright oil
crayon. This gives each painting a
shimmery, luminous quality and
accents areas touched by light.
The works are set either in even,
cool, artificial light or the golden
accenting light of sunset which
shines on a knee or shoulder and
leaves the rest in shadow.
The women themselves remain
solid shapes: often they are
treated with less importance than
the area surrounding them. They
remain anonymous, their
disproportionately small heads
hidden by shadow, eyes never
directly meeting those of the
viewer. The poses are studied,
unmoving. A strong contrast is
created between the agitated
sparkle of the overlaid crayon and
the dulled, even underpainting
and planted poses.
One of the most exciting works
is called Reflected Figure in which
the picture plane is slanted up so
that the figure almost falls out at
the viewer's feet. The light
reflecting off of the shoulder,
breast and hands is Bonnard-like
in its pink shimmered color set
against the deep satiny blue
material below.
Accompanying the paintings
are many drawings and oil pastels
by Schultz. Here the line jumps
back and forth over the paper in
search of form. There is a much
greater sense of solidity, of
modelled weight in the drawings
than in the paintings. The color is
purer, more vibrant, with hot reds
and oranges jumping out of the
forms and contrasting with the
white of the paper backgrounds.
The world of Marcia Morse's
lithographs is a very calm,
intimate, introspective one. Using

simple geometric shapes and
designs she creates quiet, lovely
patterns. On close studying,
rigidity disappears in the tiny,
active lines of soft color. The
series explores the gradations and
blending of color to create an
awareness of each individual
color, alone and as merged with
another.

shapes of common objects in
nature.
In the front room are five
strange white shapes,
three-dimensional forms out of
which various sounds can be heard
at certain times of the day. This
sophisticated electronic art,
created by Peter Yackulics, is an
attempt by the artist to force the
viewer/listener to become acutely
conscious of invisibly delineated
space.
In one work, two facing
wall-mounted cylinders are
covered with white muslin with a
round slightly curved form on the
floor between them. Behind the
muslin are parabolic reflectors
that produce a strobosonic effect,
or sound beams.
In one series of sounds, called
"Surf and Wind," a very realistic
wind blows between the two
facing cylinders, with the waves
crashing against the surf from the
round cylinder below.
The five artists have spent two
years in the studio art program at
Stanford, and will receive their
master's degrees next month. The
exhibition will continue through
June 16.
Lithographs, paintings, and
contemporary sculpture make up
the Graduate Students' Exhibition
now on view at the Stanford Art
Gallery. It is a surprising and very
exciting exhibition.
The show is a series of
different worlds and atmospheres.
Each reflects the individual artist's
approach both to his subject
matter and particular medium.
The world of Stephen Schultz
is inhabited mostly by nude
women, painted while relaxing in
chairs, sofas and on benches. The
colors in his large paintings are
almost eerie: deadly greens, deep
blues, dull reds. Over the surface
of the works are scattered tiny
aggressive strokes of bright oil
crayon. This gives each painting a
shimmery, luminous quality and
accents areas touched by light.
The works are set either in even,
cool, artificial light or the golden
accenting light of sunset which
shines on a knee or shoulder and
leaves the rest in shadow.
The women themselves remain
solid shapes: often they are
treated with less importance than
the area surrounding them. They
remain anonymous, their
disproportionately small heads
hidden by shadow, eyes never
directly meeting those of the
viewer. The poses are studied,
unmoving. A strong contrast is
created between the agitated
sparkle of the overlaid crayon and
the dulled, even underpainting
and planted poses.
One of the most exciting works
is called Reflected Figure in which
the picture plane is slanted up so
that the figure almost falls out at
the viewer's feet. The light
reflecting off of the shoulder,
breast and hands is Bonnard-like
in its pink shimmered color set
against the deep satiny blue
material below.
Accompanying the paintings
are many drawings and oil pastels
by Schultz. Here the line jumps
back and forth over the paper in
search of form. There is a much
greater sense of solidity, of
modelled weight in the drawings
than in the paintings. The color is
purer, more vibrant, with hot reds
and oranges jumping out of the
forms and contrasting with the
white of the paper backgrounds.
The world of Marcia Morse's
lithographs is a very calm,
intimate, introspective one. Using

simple geometric shapes and
designs she creates quiet, lovely
patterns. On close studying,
rigidity disappears in the tiny,
active lines of soft color. The
series explores the gradations and
blending of color to create an
awareness of each individual
color, alone and as merged with
another.
The Veil Studies are incredibly
beautiful and fragile. As
monochrome lithographs, each
gradation of line becomes an
important element and beautiful
form. The prints are
non-figurative and formal. One
must spend time with the works
and become familiar with them in
order to capture the infinite
changes and variety to be found in
each sequence. The artist says her
works "rejoice in being
lithographs." Each work explores
the technique of soft crayon on
hard stone, transferred to ink and
paper.
After the quiet intimacy of
Marcia Morse's room, Margo
Humphrey-McDanieFs is an
explosion of color. The images in
her works are thematic and
personal, reflecting "fact and
fantasy as a black in the late 20th
Century."
The works, mostly lithographs,
all reflect a wry sense of humor
and a love of color and line. The
lithographs concerning such
subjects as huge, steaming yams
and bowls of beans, are filled with
colors that jump out of the
frames.
Bright reds, deep blues, greens
and yellows are all placed next to
each other in crowded space. The
works all seem optimistic in this
series, one group even called
"Celebration." Although the artist
calls her style "sophisticated
naivete," her mastery of the
lithographic technique is anything
but naive.
There is also a whimsical
watercolor series depicting the
world of the carnival. The color
harmonies are more subtle, but no
less beautiful. Tiny pen and ink
people and animals roam around
the compositions.
In a group of monotypes,
Margo deals with more general
themes, her imagery deriving from
newly interpreted ancient African
symbols and stream of
consciousness reflections. These
works are much less finished and
more fanciful than the other

series.
Perhaps the most exciting
works by Margo Humphrey-
McDaniel are her depictions of
black faces. These works, both in
colored lithographs and
monotypes are incredibly
powerful, capturing subtle
expressions with strong lines and
color harmonies.
In the center of two of the
rooms is the result of Gary
Zerrilla's preoccupation with
seashells. Huge shells are displayed
on the floor, some measuring 4 to
8 feet. The result of exploration
of the variety of shapes, textures
and coloration of actual shells,
many of these could pass for real
if not for their size. Zerrilla's
works are fascinating because by
enlarging them to a monstrous
size, we are able to view and
realize the beautiful and varied
shapes of common objects in
nature.
