# 'Giovanni' Proves Exciting
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
You know my motto â€” who is
true tp one only is untrue to all
others.
The motto is that of Don
Giovanni, and the man and his
motto formed the basis for the
Stanford Opera Theater and
Drama Department's production
of Mozart's comic opera last
weekend.
Don Giovanni, despite its small
flaws, provided an exciting
conclusion to the campus
theatrical season. What the
production lacked in execution it
more than made up for in vitality.
Marie Gibson was by far the
vocal standout of the production,
her years of professional
experience giving her the power

and grace to play Donna Anna
with vital assurance. To some
extent Gibson's Thursday night
performance made it difficult for
her fellow players to measure up,
and as a result the production
seemed unevenly cast.
John Miller, cast in the title
role, provided a visually delightful
Don, and although his voice did
not carry well on the lower notes,
Miller's performance was excellent
overall.
In particular, the parlance
between Leporello (Stevens
Garlick) and the Don showed
both performers at their best. The
comic dialogues between the
buffoon and the suave seducer
added the zest necessary to
balance the serious arias. Jan
Shapiro was delightful as Zerlina,

the country maiden seduced by
the Don. Her voice was as clear
and nearly as powerful as
Gibson's, and her acting was
bright and perky in keeping with
her role.
The weakest of Thursday's
three female leads was Michele
Miland as Donna Elvira. Miland's
opening aria was an unfortunate
instance of a soprano unsure of
her power, and the result was a
rather hollow falsetto sound.
However, this problem seemed to
vanish as the performance
continued; it may have merely
indicated that this was Miland's
opening night in her part and that
she was nervous.
Nile Norton was very popular
with the audience as Don Ottavio,
Donna Anna's betrothed, but his

tenor didn't carry as well as could
have been hoped. He was not
alone, since only Gibson's voice
seemed able to reach the rafters of
Memorial Auditorium.
The entire production was
vindicated during the ensembles
with conductor Sandor Salgo
holding together the orchestra and
the choral segments and
controlling the whole admirably.
The leads combined powerfully
on trios, quartets, and other
ensemble portions which included
the production finale.
A strange combination of the
comic and the surreal, Don
Giovanni was actually climaxed
by a bit of stage trickery which
transformed the Don's portal into
the gates of hell, providing a
realistically fiery ending to an
excellently staged opera.
