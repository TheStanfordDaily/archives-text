# Robin Trower Outperforms Sha Na Na
## 
### PAUL BREWBAKER 
SAN FRANCISCO - Second-billed Robin
Trower made good his claim to rock guitar
fame last Friday and Saturday nights at
Winterland in a bill with Golden Earring and
headliners Sha Na Na. Sha Na Na suffered
from having not only one, but two hard acts
to follow, and from an audience apparently
there only to see Trower.
"Greased and ready to kick your bloody
asses," as they were characteristically
announced, the self-proclaimed resurrectors
of the Golden Age of Rock 'n' Roll combined
a show of glitter and grime with just plain old
rockin'.
They are a sight to see: blue jeans
(dungarees) cuffed at the ankles, tucked-in
white T-shirts with smokes rolled up the
sleeves, shades balanced menacingly on their
noses, and hair slicked back with vaginal
lubricant — they live up to the image of
street corner thugs cruisin' for a bruisin' a
decade ago.
Launching directly into Bill Haley's
"Rock Around The Clock," the ensemble ran
down a list of true golden oldies. In each
number, original performers were imitated,
the group shifting instrumental and vocal
loads continuously.
From Elvis Presley's "Hound Dog"
(complete with sparkling acoustic guitar
slung low) to the tear-jerker "Tell Laura I

Love Her," Sha Na Na ran the gamut of rock
and roll classics.
Shifting sets gave tne performance a
theatrical touch, along with changing
costumes for the "Sha Na Na Hits the Street"
act and the "Sha Na Na Dance Contest,"
where three girls from the audience were
brought up to the stage to Jitterbug, Tango
and Twist with the group's trio of male
dancers. Sha Na Na was fun, but as usual,
hard to take seriously.
As it turned out, the star of the evening
was clearly Robin Trower and his group,
after whose performance many people left
rather than stay for Sha Na Na's set. Though
second-billed, Trower proved master not only
of the guitar but of the concert. The former
Procul Harum lead established before the
sell-out crowd his place among the British
lead guitar greats.
Backed solidly by the fanatic drumming
of Reg Isodore and the throbbing, thumping
bass of James Dewar, who also took the
burden of vocal chores, Trower lifted from
the frets arching, screaming riffs which were
fed back through a wall of Marshall amps and
speaker out through the audience like a sonic
steamroller. With a heavy Hendrix accent,
Trower paints creative, electronic waves of
sound — good, hard and loud rock music.
Starting out with the title track from his

first solo LP, "Twice Removed From
Yesterday," Trower gave a taste of things to
come. The group moved right into his latest
LP's namesake, "Bridge of Sighs," and then
moved quickly in a smoking number, "Lady
Love."
In the grand tradition of European hard
rock groups, Golden Earring demonstrated in
the night's opening set that full-on electric
music is still the staple of the modern music
diet. The Dutch quartet's set consisted of
three extended song/jams and a rocking
encore of the old Beatles' hit, "Money."
Paced with the incredible drumming of
Cesar Zuiderwijk, the foursome started off
with a surreal electronic/flute number which
dissolved slowly but surely into a frenzied
climax. Zuiderwijk literally erupted from his
double-bassed drum set in a blinding flash at
that peak, setting the tone for the remainder
of their set. Drumming feverishly but with a
distinctive grace, Zuiderwijk bears stylistic
resemblance to Ginger Baker, or more
recently to Carmine Appice.
Golden Earring was perhaps the best
group in the evening's entertainment, not as
refined as Trower, but without the campy
onstage antics of Sha Na Na. And with the
spacy vocalist rounding out the four, the
group can definitely look ahead to bigger and
better things.
