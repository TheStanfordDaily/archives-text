Kinks
Preservation Act 1/
RCA CLP 2504
Preservation Act II is the latest
in a long line of Kinks klassics,
their 18th American LP and first
two-record set of all new material.
A continuation of last fall's
Preservation Act /, the three
records together make up the
longest and most successful rock
opera yet done.
Rock opera? Don't let it scare
you away. It is true that all past
rock operas have been marred by
a certain pretentiousness which, as
many have suggested, is
antithetical to the nature of rock.
A prime example is Tommy,
which, although it contained
much fine music, was ultimately a
failure. But Preservation is
everything a rock opera should
be: a collection of fully realized
songs which, when put together,
tell a simple, cohesive story. And,
above all else, it is fun.
Preservation might almost be
thought of as a four-record opera,
as it was in the 1969 album
Village Green Preservation Society
that the Kinks first introduced us
to the village in which much of
the action takes place.
In Act /, we are introduced to
the main characters of the opera.
The corrupt Flash has come into
national power. Although a
socialist, Mr. Black arises to
challenge Flash, and, at Act Vs
end Flash is succeeding in razing
the small towns and villages to
"build a row of identical boxes,
and sell them all off at treble the
profits."
The majority of action takes

place in Act 11. A radio bulletin
opening the album informs us that
Mr. Black has formed a people's
army to revolt against the evil
Flash. However, Kinks songwriter
and singer Ray Davies is not
content to give us stereotypes.
As the album proceeds, we see
that Flash is not all bad, and that
the supposedly idealistic Mr.
Black is every bit as self-serving as
Flash. In a dream encounter with
his soul, not unlike the strange
experience of Scrooge, Flash
comes to see the errors of his
ways and comes to confess his
sins.
However, it is all too late, for
Mr. Black succeeds in seizing
control of the government. In an
ironic twist, he proves to be far
worse than Flash, imposing
totalitarian restrictions upon the
people and working towards the
goal of building "an artificial
world full of artificial people."
One of the best things about
Act II is that, unlike most rock
operas, every song relates to the
action. There are no long
instrumental fillers or songs that
don't fit in, and you don't need a
lyric sheet to tell who is speaking
or what is happening. One of the
reasons for this are five brief
"radio bulletins" interspersed
throughout the records, similar in
effectiveness to "Miracle Cure" in
Tommy.
Musically, the album is
excellent, each and every song a
treat. Ray Davies is the best
songwriter in rock music. His
special genius is not in his ability
to write rock's best lyrics. Nor is
it in his ability as a master

plagiarist of melodies (while Ray
does borrow freely, no one has
ever accused him of lack of
originality; more than any other
group, the Kinks have always
done their "own thing,"
unaffected by whatever else is
happening in rock music). Instead,
Davies' special genius is in the way
he matches music to lyrics and
lyrics to music, each perfectly
complementing the other.
Ray is also probably the best
singer in rock music, "the
possessor of dozens of voices that
run the gamut from Howlin' Wolf
to Marlene Dietrich," as one critic
has said. It is the combination of
lyrics, music, vocals, and
arrangements that creates that
special sound, a sort of
Kinks-magic. As usual, that sound
is changing. On recent albums the
band has added a horn section.
Preservation makes effective use
of girl singers, and on Act II a girl
sings lead on a Kinks song for the
first time (it works!).
If I have a complaint about Act
II it is that while it is
homogeneously excellent with
few low points, it also lacks any
songs great enough to belong in a
"best of Kinks" collection. Still, I
would rather have an album like
this than one like 197 2's
Everybody's In Showbiz, which
contained klunkers as well as
klassics.
So there it is, Ray Davies
making fun of right-wingers,
left-wingers, old morals new
values, and throwing in a serious
warning against apathy and the
evils of modern technology. A
typical Kinks album, a knock-out
from start to finish, one of the
best records of the year. My
recommendation: BUY.

Dana Gillespie
Weren't Born A Man
MainMan/RCA APL 1-0354
Behold Dana Gillespie, just as
I've seen her in numerous glossy
press photos during the past two
months. Take a good look,
because appearance is the only
thing the lady's got.
According to the publicity
releases, Dana likes black lingerie,
gold jewelry and snakes. She also
seems to like David Bowie; she
claims to have been his first
girlfriend. If one can believe the
lyrics of the title cut, "Weren't
Born A Man," Dana also likes
other women.
Unfortunately, Dana can't sing.
That's not quite accurate — she
stays in tune, and her voice isn't
unpleasant. Yet before hearing all
of the album cuts I was forced to
put on a side of Cold Blood to
relieve my dashed expectations.
Dana Gillespie is guilty of false
packaging.
Her appearance calls forth the
breathy sensuality of Dusty
Springfield, or the outright lust of
Lydia Pense — but Dana's voice is
so weak that it must be
double-tracked in places where
power is needed.
Somehow flashes of musical
competence infiltrate this album,
particularly "Mother, Don't Be
Frightened," which features Rick
Wakeman's piano arpeggios and
Mick Ronson's guitar work.
Ronson also arranged the strings
on this piece. But these flashes
aren't enough to save the album.
Dana's own compositions are
reminiscent of the poetry
long-haired flower-child girls
wrote all over the Bay Area when
San Francisco was the love capital
of the world — most of her songs
are as original as most of those
poems. "What Memories We
Make" combines cliche lyrics
about freedom, sun, sand, sea and
summer with an equally trite
melody.
While "Dizzy Heights" and
"All Cut Up On You" approach
the kind of drive that would make
the album a worthy investment,
most press commentary about the
album will center on the title cut,
"Weren't Born A Man," in which
Dana laments the fact that one of
her girlfriends is female.
Whatever Dana's private sexual
practices may be, her public image
as presented by MjflnMan trades
on her apparent abandonment of
straight morality as a selling point
for her music. Just as corporations
have sold pretty girls' bodies for
decades, Dana is sold as a singer
who not only has a pretty body
but is — gasp! — bisexual. A new
breed of sexism is born.
Given some voice lessons and
some decent material Dana
Gillespie may recuperate from this
present venture into the murky
artistic waters of rock 'n' rouge.
For the present, neither Weren't
Born A Man nor Dana Gillespie
are worth the vinyl they're
printed on.

Kiki Dee
Loving and Free
The Rocket Record Company (MCA)
MCA-395
Kiki Dee's Loving and Free the
latest release from Elton John's
bullpen (and personal record
label), provides a few good
sounds, but this album makes it
clear that not all Elton touches
turns to gold.
Aside from producing Loving
and Free, the English
composer-pianist wrote two of the
cuts on the album with his
lyricist-partner Bernie Taupin,
played numerous keyboard
instruments on the disc and lent
his band — guitarist Davey
Johnstone, bassist Dee Murray
and drummer Nigel Olsson.
The album also contains the
labors of many of the top rock
musicians in England, such as B.J.
Cole on pedal steel and Dave
Mattacks on drums. Despite all
this, however, the album is still
basically listless and repetitive.
The main problem with Loving
and Free is that so many of the
songs seem to have come from the
same mold. "Rest My Head,"
"Amoureuse," "Sugar on the
Floor," "If It Rains," "You Put
Something Better Inside of Me"
and the title track all drag slowly
with a syrupy mixture of guitar,
piano and other assorted
keyboard instruments as backup.
Kiki tries to overpower her
background and exhibit some of
the soul which made her the first
white artist to be signed with
Motown under the Tamla label.
But even her vocals do not carry
the sluggish, overdone
instrumentation.
Of the two songs John
composed for the album. "Lonnie

and Josie" is a complete bore,
while "Supercool" might very
well have been Elton's next single
— wasted on this album.
The forceful, heavy rock in
"Supercool" is not only played by
the Elton John band (with Elton
on keyboards, of course), but the
song is strongly reminiscent of the
energetic "Saturday Night's
Alright For Fighting" from John's
own Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.
"Supercool" is easily the best
song on Kiki Dee's album.
From there, the only other
notable cut is Jackson Browne's
"Song For Adam" which is
somewhat uneven but nonetheless
very pretty.
Though cuts from Loving and
Free may be hits in England, both
Kiki Dee and the Rocket Record
Company label need more solid
works to become established in
the United States.

Billy Cobham
Crosswinds
Atlantic SD 7300
Crosswinds is the second solo
album by Billy Cobham, former
drummer of the Mahavishnu
Orchestra. It comes on the heels
of Cobham's successful first
album, Spectrum, which spent
several weeks in the top 40 this
winter and was widely hailed as
the most successful jazz-rock
fusion yet done.
Spectrum relied mostly on the
drums-guitar-keyboard interaction
that was the trademark of the
Mahavishnu Orchestra. Rather
than staying content with a
successful formula, however,
Cobham has decided to forge
further ahead into the jazz idiom.

Crosswinds represents a radical
departure from the music of the
Mahavishnu Orchestra, being
rock-tinged jazz rather than
jazz-tinged rock.
For Crosswinds Cobham has
assembled a group of musicians
entirely different from the group
on Spectrum. He has played with
many of them before, and it
seems likely that this is the group
he will be playing with in the
future. It features John
Abercrombie on guitars, Michael
and Randy Brecker on woodwinds
and trumpets respectively, John
Williams on bass, Gamett Brown
on trombone, George Duke on
keyboards, Lee Pastora on latin
percussion, and, of course, Billy
Cobham. For a group that has
been together for such a short
time, they have achieved a fine
group sound, playing together
superbly in even the most
complex passages.
The sound on Crosswinds is
dominated by horns and
woodwinds, rather than guitar.
The songs, all composed by
Cobham, all work whether they
are serene, like "Heather," or
"Flash Flood," which cooks.
Special credit should be given to
Michael Brecker, who contributes
some amazing solos. Cobham
excells throughout, showing once
more that he is one of the best
drummers in jazz or rock.
The best adjective to describe
the music on this album is cool.
With finals and hot weather
coming up, its a good album to
get. On the next scorcher, I advise
that you put Crosswinds on the
stereo, turn up the volume, and
then just lie back and relax. You'll
be glad you bought it.

Summer Rock
Upcoming rock concerts in the
Bay Area should please local rock
fans. Concerts that have been
announced include some sure sell
outs, but the as yet unannounced
concerts should give the area some
welcome surprises.
Bill Graham Productions has
the first concert of note this
weekend with The Grateful Dead
and The Beach Boys headlining an
all day affair at Oakland Stadium
that also includes The New Riders
of The Purple Sage and
Commander Cody and His Lost
Planet Airmen. Advance seats are
$8.50, tickets at the door are $10.
If the Dead concert in Santa
Barbara two weeks ago was any
indication of this concert, expect
to hear some great music, but also
expect to be disappointed by long
intermissions.
Other big concerts this summer
include at least one show by
Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, also
at the Oakland Stadium (on July
13). Rumors had Eric Clapton and
friends on the same show, but
nothing has been announced.
Cat Stevens is coming to the
Oakland Coliseum on July 3 with
Linda Lewis on a Fun Productions
tour.
Other unannounced but
reliable rumors include a summer
tour by the Stones, another Who
appearance and a possible George
Harrison appearance.

WHAT LARGE HEELS!!!—Dana Gillespie is receiving a lot of publicity about her fledgling career as a
singer. Unfortunately (or fortunately), it isn't all based on her singing ability (as demonstrated by this
typical publicity photo). Dana's new album, "Weren't Born A Man" comes off as a rather lackluster
album.

ELTON JOHN'S FlND—Although her career is being pushed by the
likes of Elton John and friends, Kiki Dee doesn't appear to be headed
for his class of stardom. Her new album shows glimpses of John-like
talent, but is not an overall success. Elton John followers might be
happy to know that John and Bernie Taupin wrote some of the songs,
and that John's back-up group played on the album.
