# Lambert Named Water Polo Coach
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Art Lambert, U.S. Olympic
water polo coach in 1968 and "72,
will move up the freeway from his
post at De Anza College to coach
the Stanford water polo squad, it
was announced Friday.
With the addition of Lambert,
Stanford becomes the last school
in the Pacific Eight to hire a
full-time water polo coach. Jim
Gaughran had been doing double
duty for the Cardinals, handling
both swimming and water polo.
Gaughran will still assist in the
water polo program but the
addition of a full-time coach will
free him to devote more time to
the swimming program. Lambert

and Gaughran were teammates on
the San Francisco Olympic Club
water polo team which won the
AAU crown in 1959.
Lambert faces a tough
challenge at Stanford. Last season
the Cards finished last in the
Pac-8, with a 0-6 record and with
NCAA water polo champion
California losing only one player
to graduation, the Cards' chances
for an NCAA berth will be slim.
Under The Gun
"The main weakness in
Stanford's water polo program has
been the amount of time Jim
[Gaughran] could devote to the
program," said Lambert. "He
[Gaughran] has really been under

the gun in the Pac-8," added
Lambert.
"I was hired so late that it will
be difficult for me to evaluate the
team," said Lambert. "But I did
have a meeting with 'em a couple
of days ago and some of 'em are
planning to play here this summer
on a club,"he added.
The new coach termed this
year's recruiting "average." "We
really didn't get anybody great in
water polo."
All-American
Lambert, 39, is a graduate of
San Jose State, where he was a
three-year All-American in
swimming and water polo. He
played on AAU championship
teams for the San Francisco
Olympic Club in 1957 and '59
and was an AAU All-American
four straight years, 1959-62.
Lambert's teams at De Anza
College have won six straight

league and Northern California
water polo championships and in
1971 won the California junior
college water polo crown.
In 1967 he coached the U.S.
water polo squad to victory in the
Pan American Games. He has also
coached the De Anza Aquatic
Foundation water polo teams
which have won six National AAU
water polo championships.
In 1968 he coached the U.S.
Olympic water polo squad to a
fifth place finish at Mexico City.
Under Lambert's guidance the
U.S. won a Bronze medal in 1972
at Munich.
"Without question Art
Lambert is one of the world's
leading figures in the sport of
water polo," said Athletic
Director Joe Ruetz. "The addition
of Lambert gives us a water sports
coaching staff that is unparalleled
in the country today," added
Ruetz.
