# USC All-Sports Champ
## 
### 
The Pacific Eight conference
no longer awards an all-sports
trophy, but if it did, USC, not
surprisingly, would be king of the
league.
Tabulations were done by the
Oregon sports information office
â€” not surprisingly, since the
Ducks would finish second ahead
of UCLA and Stanford in third
and fourth.
Points are awarded to each of
the 10 league sports on the
following basis: 10 for first, eight
for second, six, five, four, three,
two, one for for third through
eighth.
USC achived its winning
margin despite the fact that it did
not participate in cross country or
wrestling, and thus got zero points
for each. The Trojans more than
made up for this loss, however, by
winning the football, track,
swimming and baseball titles and
getting a total of 65 points.
Oregon finished second
because it finished in the top three
in seven of the league's sports, and

won the cross-country title.
UCLA had 55'/2 points and the
basketball title, Stanford, 50'/2
and tennis and golf crowns.
Wrestling champion
Washington finished fifth (43),
gymnastics titleist California sixth
(39), Washington State (36)
seventh and Oregon State last.
