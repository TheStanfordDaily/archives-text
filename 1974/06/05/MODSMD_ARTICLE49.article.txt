# Cites Backhand Improvement
## Whitlinger: Suddenly A Star 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
He still crouches tensely for
the serve, explodes a two-hand
backhand, gallops to the net,
stops, turns, lunges, his shoes
letting out angry squaks, wins a
point and shakes his head in
disbelief, much to the pleasure of
a captive crowd.
At first glance, it's still the
same John Whitlinger Stanford
tennis fans marveled over in 1973.
At another look, however, it's
not. A year ago, Whitlinger was an
overaged prodigy whose brilliance
astounded but whose game wasn't
fundamentally solid enough to get
above the sixth rung on the
Stanford ladder.
Now, he's one of the favorites
for the NCAA singles
championship, a confirmed star
who seems destined to make a
mark and a lot of money in the
pro tennis world.
Unbroken Triumph
Whitlinger's 1974 season has
been one of unbroken triumph.
He's won the Northern California
Intercollegiate and Ojai
championships, posted a 16-1
record (avenging his only defeat
by crushing UCLA's Steve Mott at
the Pac-B's) and beaten such
players as teammate Jim Delaney,
USC ace John Andrews and
Sherwood Stewart, the nation's
28th ranked player.
Last week, Whit's teammates
showed their appreciation by
electing him captain, the first time
in memory that a sophomore has
been so honored.

Whitlinger explains his sudden
improvement as being "thanks to
my two-handed backhand. Last
year I couldn't hit it.
"I worked with my father for
two weeks last summer in
Akron," he explains. "And now I
can put my backhand just about
anywhere."
Two-Year Slump
The dramatic improvement was
Whitlinger's first in a two-year
period (1972-73) that he refers to
as his slump.
Before that, Whit was
unbeatable. At 16, he won all
sorts of age-group tourneys and
the next year, at 17, he was
ranked as the third best
18-and-under player in the nation,
just behind teammate Pat DuPre
and ahead of Delaney and Chico
Hagey.
Then came the slump, which
Whitlinger attributes to poor
groundstrokes, which in a small
player (he's listed at 5-8) is a fatal
weakness.
Not that last season was a
complete failure. Whit finished
18-2, and his competitiveness
earned him several shutouts,
dubbed "whitwashes."
59th Ranked
But still, something was
missing from his game, and he
finished 1973 as the 59th ranked
men's player in the U.S. — behind
teammates Delaney, DuPre, Nick
Saviano and Hagey's '72 ranking.
Part of Whitlinger's problem
was that he hadn't been getting
the toughest competition during

the spring seasons — a product of
Neenah, Wisconsin, he won the
state high school singles
championships four consecutive
seasons.
Another problem might have
been adjustment to Stanford — a
school he attended because "I
liked the coach and the guys on
the team." Whit's first-quarter
grades didn't exactly make the Phi
Beta Kappa committee stand up
and cheer.
By now, Whitlinger has it all
straightened out. He lives
intensely, practicing and studying
hard but saving a lot of time for
his social life.
Not Detrimental
"I don't think drinking beer is
hurting me too much," Whitlinger
said between drinks of his home
state's best-known product.
"When I work, I work, when I
have a good time, I have a good
time."
A good team player ("he's
never complained about his
position on the team ladder,"
Gould says), Whitlinger's goal is to
help Stanford win the NCAA
team title this month.
The best way to do that would
be to win the singles
championship. "I think I have as
good a shot as anybody," he says.
And his eyes look elsewhere
when he adds, "I heard the NCAA
champion automatically gets
invited to Wimbledon.. .

WINNING WHITLINGER — Stanford's tennis team, which is hoping
for a second straight national title, will need yet another sterling
performance from sophomore John Whitlinger in order to win.
Whitlinger, a much-improved sophomore, has had a great year, posting
an incredible 16-1 record.

WINNING WHITLINGER — Stanford's tennis team, which is hoping
for a second straight national title, will need yet another sterling
performance from sophomore John Whitlinger in order to win.
Whitlinger, a much-improved sophomore, has had a great year, posting
an incredible 16-1 record.
He still crouches tensely for
the serve, explodes a two-hand
backhand, gallops to the net,
stops, turns, lunges, his shoes
letting out angry squaks, wins a
point and shakes his head in
disbelief, much to the pleasure of
a captive crowd.
At first glance, it's still the
same John Whitlinger Stanford
tennis fans marveled over in 1973.
At another look, however, it's
not. A year ago, Whitlinger was an
overaged prodigy whose brilliance
astounded but whose game wasn't
fundamentally solid enough to get
above the sixth rung on the
Stanford ladder.
Now, he's one of the favorites
for the NCAA singles
championship, a confirmed star
who seems destined to make a
mark and a lot of money in the
pro tennis world.
Unbroken Triumph
Whitlinger's 1974 season has
been one of unbroken triumph.
He's won the Northern California
Intercollegiate and Ojai
championships, posted a 16-1
record (avenging his only defeat
by crushing UCLA's Steve Mott at
the Pac-B's) and beaten such
players as teammate Jim Delaney,
USC ace John Andrews and
Sherwood Stewart, the nation's
28th ranked player.
Last week, Whit's teammates
showed their appreciation by
electing him captain, the first time
in memory that a sophomore has
been so honored.

Whitlinger explains his sudden
improvement as being "thanks to
my two-handed backhand. Last
year I couldn't hit it.
"I worked with my father for
two weeks last summer in
Akron," he explains. "And now I
can put my backhand just about
anywhere."
Two-Year Slump
The dramatic improvement was
Whitlinger's first in a two-year
period (1972-73) that he refers to
as his slump.
Before that, Whit was
unbeatable. At 16, he won all
sorts of age-group tourneys and
the next year, at 17, he was
ranked as the third best
18-and-under player in the nation,
just behind teammate Pat DuPre
and ahead of Delaney and Chico
Hagey.
Then came the slump, which
Whitlinger attributes to poor
groundstrokes, which in a small
player (he's listed at 5-8) is a fatal
weakness.
Not that last season was a
complete failure. Whit finished
18-2, and his competitiveness
earned him several shutouts,
dubbed "whitwashes."
59th Ranked
But still, something was
missing from his game, and he
finished 1973 as the 59th ranked
men's player in the U.S. — behind
teammates Delaney, DuPre, Nick
Saviano and Hagey's '72 ranking.
Part of Whitlinger's problem
was that he hadn't been getting
the toughest competition during

the spring seasons — a product of
Neenah, Wisconsin, he won the
state high school singles
championships four consecutive
seasons.
Another problem might have
been adjustment to Stanford — a
school he attended because "I
liked the coach and the guys on
the team." Whit's first-quarter
grades didn't exactly make the Phi
Beta Kappa committee stand up
and cheer.
By now, Whitlinger has it all
straightened out. He lives
intensely, practicing and studying
hard but saving a lot of time for
his social life.
Not Detrimental
"I don't think drinking beer is
hurting me too much," Whitlinger
said between drinks of his home
state's best-known product.
"When I work, I work, when I
have a good time, I have a good
time."
A good team player ("he's
never complained about his
position on the team ladder,"
Gould says), Whitlinger's goal is to
help Stanford win the NCAA
team title this month.
The best way to do that would
be to win the singles
championship. "I think I have as
good a shot as anybody," he says.
And his eyes look elsewhere
when he adds, "I heard the NCAA
champion automatically gets
invited to Wimbledon.. .

WINNING WHITLINGER — Stanford's tennis team, which is hoping
for a second straight national title, will need yet another sterling
performance from sophomore John Whitlinger in order to win.
Whitlinger, a much-improved sophomore, has had a great year, posting
an incredible 16-1 record.
