# 'New' Cards Seek NCAA Net Crown
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Five players won the NCAA
tennis title at Princeton for
Stanford last season.
It looks like only one of them,
junior Jim Delaney, will be
around to defend it.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
yesterday reluctantly announced
that he was taking sophomore Pat
DuPre, who's been suffering from
tendonitis in the right wrist, out
of the singles lineup. DuPre has
been unable to practice for more
than one-half hour at a time for
the last month.
Other members of the 1973
championship team who won't be
present in Los Angeles June 17-22
are Sandy Mayer, who quit the
team, and graduates Rick Fisher
and Gery Groslimond.
Singles Four
That leaves Delaney,
sophomore captain John
Whitlinger, junior Chico Hagey
and freshman Nick Saviano in the
singles lineup for the Cards.
Gould decided to play Saviano,
53rd ranked men's player in the
U.S., in DuPre's stead, rather than
Gene Mayer, a talented but less
experienced freshman.
Saviano, who starred at Gunn
High School in Palo Alto, played
well at the fifth singles position
this year, after a disappointing fall
practice season.
The lefthander has been able to
overpower opponents with his
serve-and-volley game, and should
be a threat at the NCAA's.
Hagey was an All-America
selection in 1972, and reached the
fifth round of that year's NCAA's.
However, that August he broke
his ankle at Forest Hills and it
took his game a long time to
round back into form.
But Chico was better than ever
this May when he reached the
finals of the California State
Championships at Alpine Hills.
According to some observers at
the scene, he was playing better
tennis than anyone at Stanford
this year.
Delaney has played first singles
for most of this season (Sandy
Mayer played in only five dual
matches), and suffered somewhat
from the "first singles jinx" that
afflicted Mayer last season.
However, his game is
fundamentally solid, and his
competitiveness could lead to an
NCAA crown.
At doubles, things are more
complicated. According to Gould,

there is a 40-60 chance DuPre will
be able to play. If the doctor does
give him the OK and DuPre seems
to be in good form, he will team
with Whitlinger at one doubles
spot while Hagey-Delaney play
the other position.
While this lineup would ensure
good seedings (DuPre-Whitlinger
are considered one of the four
best collegiate doubles teams in
the country), it probably won't
come about.
Probable Lineup
If DuPre can't play, his partner
Whitlinger will be teamed with
Delaney, as occurred at the
Pac-B's. In that case, Saviano-Mark
Mitchell, who have been playing
together as a team all year long,
would probably play the other
doubles position.
While these teams are good,
they probably wouldn't impress
the NCAA tournament
committee, which, at least last
year, seemed biased toward
seeding doubles teams with a
plethora of experience.
"If we get a little break in the
draw in the doubles we could
come out all right," Gould said.
Main Opponents
Stanford's main opponents for
the NCAA team title will be
familiar foes USC, UCLA and
SMU.
All three teams have two
excellent singles players who
combine to form an experienced,
top-notch doubles entry. For the
host Trojans, it's John
Andrews-Sashi Menon, for the
Bruins, Brian Teacher-Steve Mott,
for the Mustangs, George
Hardie-Tim Vann.
While no other team can be
considered a factor, certain
players, such as Victor Amaya of
Michigan and Mike Cahill of
Albama join Delaney, Whitlinger,
Teacher, Andrews and Hardie as
threats for the singles
championship vacated by Sandy
Mayer.
Playing conditions for the
six-day event may be less than
ideal. USC's David X. Marks
Tennis Stadium has good, hard
courts, but is located in central
Los Angeles where heat and smog
make a very choking doubles
combination.
A USC spokesman said that
tickets would probably be
available at the door Monday
through Friday, with some
problem getting seats for
Saturday's championship match.

High School in Palo Alto, played
well at the fifth singles position
this year, after a disappointing fall
practice season.
The lefthander has been able to
overpower opponents with his
serve-and-volley game, and should
be a threat at the NCAA's.
Hagey was an All-America
selection in 1972, and reached the
fifth round of that year's NCAA's.
However, that August he broke
his ankle at Forest Hills and it
took his game a long time to
round back into form.
But Chico was better than ever
this May when he reached the
finals of the California State
Championships at Alpine Hills.
According to some observers at
the scene, he was playing better
tennis than anyone at Stanford
this year.
Delaney has played first singles
for most of this season (Sandy
Mayer played in only five dual
matches), and suffered somewhat
from the "first singles jinx" that
afflicted Mayer last season.
However, his game is
fundamentally solid, and his
competitiveness could lead to an
NCAA crown.
At doubles, things are more
complicated. According to Gould,

there is a 40-60 chance DuPre will
be able to play. If the doctor does
give him the OK and DuPre seems
to be in good form, he will team
with Whitlinger at one doubles
spot while Hagey-Delaney play
the other position.
While this lineup would ensure
good seedings (DuPre-Whitlinger
are considered one of the four
best collegiate doubles teams in
the country), it probably won't
come about.
Probable Lineup
If DuPre can't play, his partner
Whitlinger will be teamed with
Delaney, as occurred at the
Pac-B's. In that case, Saviano-Mark
Mitchell, who have been playing
together as a team all year long,
would probably play the other
doubles position.
While these teams are good,
they probably wouldn't impress
the NCAA tournament
committee, which, at least last
year, seemed biased toward
seeding doubles teams with a
plethora of experience.
"If we get a little break in the
draw in the doubles we could
come out all right," Gould said.
Main Opponents
Stanford's main opponents for
the NCAA team title will be
familiar foes USC, UCLA and
SMU.
All three teams have two
excellent singles players who
combine to form an experienced,
top-notch doubles entry. For the
host Trojans, it's John
Andrews-Sashi Menon, for the
Bruins, Brian Teacher-Steve Mott,
for the Mustangs, George
Hardie-Tim Vann.
While no other team can be
considered a factor, certain
players, such as Victor Amaya of
Michigan and Mike Cahill of
Albama join Delaney, Whitlinger,
Teacher, Andrews and Hardie as
threats for the singles
championship vacated by Sandy
Mayer.
Playing conditions for the
six-day event may be less than
ideal. USC's David X. Marks
Tennis Stadium has good, hard
courts, but is located in central
Los Angeles where heat and smog
make a very choking doubles
combination.
A USC spokesman said that
tickets would probably be
available at the door Monday
through Friday, with some
problem getting seats for
Saturday's championship match.
Five players won the NCAA
tennis title at Princeton for
Stanford last season.
It looks like only one of them,
junior Jim Delaney, will be
around to defend it.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
yesterday reluctantly announced
that he was taking sophomore Pat
DuPre, who's been suffering from
tendonitis in the right wrist, out
of the singles lineup. DuPre has
been unable to practice for more
than one-half hour at a time for
the last month.
Other members of the 1973
championship team who won't be
present in Los Angeles June 17-22
are Sandy Mayer, who quit the
team, and graduates Rick Fisher
and Gery Groslimond.
Singles Four
That leaves Delaney,
sophomore captain John
Whitlinger, junior Chico Hagey
and freshman Nick Saviano in the
singles lineup for the Cards.
Gould decided to play Saviano,
53rd ranked men's player in the
U.S., in DuPre's stead, rather than
Gene Mayer, a talented but less
experienced freshman.
Saviano, who starred at Gunn
High School in Palo Alto, played
well at the fifth singles position
this year, after a disappointing fall
practice season.
