# 205 On 'Box Game' Ladders
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
» What has 78 handballs, 98
squash racquets and 58
racquetballs? The Stanford
handball, squash and racquetball
ladders.
The new deGuerre
swimming/handball complex has
provided a home for these "Box
Games,"as first-ranked racquetball
player Charles Engles termed
them.
The ladder system makes it
possible for enthusiasts of these
sports to compete at their own
level, says Dr. Wes Ruff, director
of physical education and
coordinator of the new facility.
Although there are 205 names
listed on the ladders, competition
has not been that intense, Engles
says."The ladder system is
supposed to make it easy for
people to find matches," said
Engles.

"But when I got to the number
one spot, I had to call people to
find a game. Frankly I'm very
disappointed with the system. I
wish there was some way of
injecting some life into the
system," he added.
Engles has even gone so far as
to put his name up twice on the
ladder to find a game. "I put my
name up as a left- and
right-handed player to find some
opponents," Engles said.
But Bryant Garth, fifth-ranked
handball player, doesn't share
Engles' view of the system. "It's
worked out pretty well. There was
a lot of interest when the system
first began, but now it's pretty
stablized.
"The best players play a lot
and the rest of the ladder is just
there. The rankings on the ladder
are kind of fortuitous, since you
can easily move up, without

beating the guy in front of you."
Bob Dow, a member of the
committee which controls the
facility termed the ladders
unimportant. "They're not a real
indication of the frequency of
activity," said Dow.
Some people attribute this lack
of competition to the fact that
these games are new to the West
Coast. "Most of your top players
are from the East. They're either
grad students from the East, or
they picked it up back there,"
said Mike Holdowan,
second-ranked racquetball player.
Play in the new facility is not
limited to members of the ladders.
The facility is open to ail Stanford
students and staff members. The
courts are open from 8:45 a.m. to
9 p.m. weekdays, 8:45 a.m. - 9
p.m. Saturdays, and 12 noon to 5
p.m. on Sundays,

first began, but now it's pretty
stablized.
"The best players play a lot
and the rest of the ladder is just
there. The rankings on the ladder
are kind of fortuitous, since you
can easily move up, without

beating the guy in front of you."
Bob Dow, a member of the
committee which controls the
facility termed the ladders
unimportant. "They're not a real
indication of the frequency of
activity," said Dow.
Some people attribute this lack
of competition to the fact that
these games are new to the West
Coast. "Most of your top players
are from the East. They're either
grad students from the East, or
they picked it up back there,"
said Mike Holdowan,
second-ranked racquetball player.
Play in the new facility is not
limited to members of the ladders.
The facility is open to ail Stanford
students and staff members. The
courts are open from 8:45 a.m. to
9 p.m. weekdays, 8:45 a.m. - 9
p.m. Saturdays, and 12 noon to 5
p.m. on Sundays,

» What has 78 handballs, 98
squash racquets and 58
racquetballs? The Stanford
handball, squash and racquetball
ladders.
The new deGuerre
swimming/handball complex has
provided a home for these "Box
Games,"as first-ranked racquetball
player Charles Engles termed
them.
The ladder system makes it
possible for enthusiasts of these
sports to compete at their own
level, says Dr. Wes Ruff, director
of physical education and
coordinator of the new facility.
Although there are 205 names
listed on the ladders, competition
has not been that intense, Engles
says."The ladder system is
supposed to make it easy for
people to find matches," said
Engles.

"But when I got to the number
one spot, I had to call people to
find a game. Frankly I'm very
disappointed with the system. I
wish there was some way of
injecting some life into the
system," he added.
Engles has even gone so far as
to put his name up twice on the
ladder to find a game. "I put my
name up as a left- and
right-handed player to find some
opponents," Engles said.
But Bryant Garth, fifth-ranked
handball player, doesn't share
Engles' view of the system. "It's
worked out pretty well. There was
a lot of interest when the system
first began, but now it's pretty
stablized.
