# Golfers Seek NCAA Title
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
It's been almost three weeks
since Stanford won the Pacific
Eight golf championship, but the
Pac-8 scoreboard still hangs
conspicuously in the Stanford
clubhouse, providing a constant
reminder to Cardinal players that
they are capable of scoring as well
as any team in the nation. •
At least that's the feeling coach
Bud Finger is trying to convey to
his players as the Cards prepare
for the NCAA championships
June 19-22 at Carleton Oaks golf
course in San Diego.
"We're not going down there
just to make a good showing,"
says Finger. "If we're lucky
enough to have four guys playing
well at the same time, we're going
to win the tournament."
Those would seem to be overly
optimistic words from a coach
whose teams have finished 19th
and 27th the past two years, but
Finger insists that the Cardinal
golfers are destined to play up to
their potential in 1974.
"It's just a matter of
maturity," Finger says. "We've
proven to ourselves that we can
beat USC, and as a result we're
playing with confidence."
Comeback
The most striking example of
Stanford's resurgence is junior
George Pettinger, who coolly fired
finishing rounds of 68-71-68 in
the Pac-8 tournament after a
disastrous opening round 79. His
286 total was good for third
place, a feature article in the San
Francisco Chronicle and unlimited
accolades from his coach.
"All of a sudden George
discovered he could play this
game," said Finger, who now
considers Pettinger one of the
Pac-B's most solid — instead of
most erratic — performers.
Involved in a similar sort of
ascent is Aly Trompas, who came
to Stanford heralded as the
nation's top junior player but for
three years failed to play up to his
16-year-old standards. Until the
Pac-B's, that is, when Trompas
shot 68-70-73-71—282 for an
impressive second place finish.
Providing a sense of stability to

the squad are juniors Dave Baskins
and Conrad Nilmeier, a pair of
197 3 honorable mention
All-Americans who have
continued to play steady golf.
Baskins, in fact, has developed
into one of the premier
performers on the West Coast,
winning the U.S. Collegiate
Invitational and tying for third at
both the Western Intercollegiates
and the Pac-8 Southern Division.
Stanford's fifth NCAA entrant
is Glenn Goethals, an energetic
freshman whose shotmaking
abilities are already legendary.
"He can be standing 240 yards
away with a 1-iron in his hands
and you know he's gonna hit the
green," says Finger.
During the latter part of the
season Goethals' tendency toward
double-bogies began to disappear,
and he tied for fourth in both the
U.S. Collegiate Invitational and
Pac-8 events.
"There's no question that the
lineup is solid," says Finger. "It's
just a matter of having four of
those guys play well at the same
time."
Florida Favored
Finger estimates that about 12
of the 42 invited teams are
capable of winning the
championship. Defending
champion Florida, currently the
top-ranked team in Golf World's
collegiate poll, would have to be
considered the favorite.
Other top 10 teams include
Wake Forest, Oklahoma State,
USC, Houston, Brigham Young,
Louisiana State, Arizona State,
Indiana and lOth-ranked
Stanford.
The tournament will be
contested over 72 holes, with the
field trimmed to the low 15 teams
# and ties at the halfway mark. For
the first time in three years, the
individual competition seems wide
open, since three-time defending
champion Ben Crenshaw has
transferred his awesome talents to
the more lucrative pro tour.
Some of the leading individual
challengers include U.S. Amateur
champion Craig Stadler and Mark
Pfeil of USC, Florida's Gary

Koch, Wake Forest's Curtis
Strange and Pac-8 champion Peter
Jacobsen of Oregon.
Trompas, a native of San Diego
who has played Carleton Oaks
many times, describes the course
as "long and tough — a lot like

Stanford."
Stanford's current competitive
averages are: Baskins (74.45),
Trompas (74.66), Pettinger
(74.80), Nilmeier (75.69), Brent
Murray (76.06) and Goethals
(76.43).
