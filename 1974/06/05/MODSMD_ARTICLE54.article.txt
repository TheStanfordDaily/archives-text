# Confident' Hogsett Biggest Hope
## Three Spikers Enter Nationals 
### MARK WHITE 
Thanks to a special qualifying
meet last Thursday, Stanford's
contingent participating in today's
first round of the NCAA
Championships at the University
of Texas in Austin will consist of
three instead of two men.
Pac-8 intermediate hurdle
champion Matt Hogsett and
veteran decathlete Ken Kring will
be joined by Tony Sandoval, who
qualified with one second to spare
in the six-mile in an 11th hour
clocking at a meet held for
Stanford and SJS runners.
This will be the first national
championship meet for Hogsett, a
sophomore, but both Kring and
Sandoval have been in NCAA

meets before. Kring placed ninth
in the national meet last year and
Sandoval ran in the NCAA
cross-country championships last
November.
Looking forward to the most
important meet of the track
season, Hogsett said "I'm still
thrilled. To be honest about it,
this is one of the few races I've
looked forward to running. I feel
good, I'm pretty strong and my
mental attitude is good.
'My Race Now'
"Before the Pac-8 meet [May
17-18] I felt like I was a novice
and I wasn't sure what would
happen. I feel a lot more
confident now — I feel like it's my
race now that it's sunk in that I
won. To place in the nationals I'll
have to run under 51.5 in each of
the prelims, then run the fastest
of my life in the finals."
Hogsett's 51.2 victory in the
440 hurdles was fastest in the
Pac-8 this season, fifth fastest in
the nation. Coach Payton Jordan
thinks Hogsett "could finish
anywhere in the top five" if the
sophomore runs true to form.
Hogsett's track career almost
came to an end in his senior year
of high school. "I was out in the
middle of the desert near El
Centro hunting when I shot
myself in the leg.
"It was pretty bad; the bullet
went through my thigh down into
my knee. I was lucky to get back

to the car; I walked part of the
way and crawled the rest."
Logical Choice
As a prep hurdle and mile relay
standout Hogsett had to choose
among USC, UCLA and Stanford,
none of which was interested in
him solely as an athlete.
"I picked Stanford because it
was the logical choice; it's just a
better school than any of the
others. There were times last year
when I had my doubts about the
choice — shoot, I had maybe two
dates the entire year — but things
are much better now.
"Terry [Albritton, former
Stanford shotputter who dropped
out for many reasons, including
Stanford's social aridity] and I
had been used to all the social
stuff we had done at Newport
Harbor High. Between living in
the dorms and being freshmen,
the social life at Stanford was

almost non-existant. Everything ;
fun now, though."
Hogsett also had track troubles
as a freshman, but still ran well
enough to rank in Stanford's
all-time top 10. "There was still
some trouble with the scar tissue
in the back of my leg and I wasn't
running quite right. I guess I can
attribute most of my success this
year to [assistant coach] Vern
Gambetta.
"In the preseason he told me
to use my arms more in the finish.
I soon realized that the final 110
yards are not that hard and that's
about when I developed my fast
finish. I've got as much stamina as
most any hurdler.
"If I can hit those first two
hurdles a little faster and then
swing wide on the final hurdle
going into the backstretch, I think
I should run as good as 1 can in
the big meet," Hogsett said.

meets before. Kring placed ninth
in the national meet last year and
Sandoval ran in the NCAA
cross-country championships last
November.
Looking forward to the most
important meet of the track
season, Hogsett said "I'm still
thrilled. To be honest about it,
this is one of the few races I've
looked forward to running. I feel
good, I'm pretty strong and my
mental attitude is good.
'My Race Now'
"Before the Pac-8 meet [May
17-18] I felt like I was a novice
and I wasn't sure what would
happen. I feel a lot more
confident now — I feel like it's my
race now that it's sunk in that I
won. To place in the nationals I'll
have to run under 51.5 in each of
the prelims, then run the fastest
of my life in the finals."
Hogsett's 51.2 victory in the
440 hurdles was fastest in the
Pac-8 this season, fifth fastest in
the nation. Coach Payton Jordan
thinks Hogsett "could finish
anywhere in the top five" if the
sophomore runs true to form.
Hogsett's track career almost
came to an end in his senior year
of high school. "I was out in the
middle of the desert near El
Centro hunting when I shot
myself in the leg.
"It was pretty bad; the bullet
went through my thigh down into
my knee. I was lucky to get back

to the car; I walked part of the
way and crawled the rest."
Logical Choice
As a prep hurdle and mile relay
standout Hogsett had to choose
among USC, UCLA and Stanford,
none of which was interested in
him solely as an athlete.
"I picked Stanford because it
was the logical choice; it's just a
better school than any of the
others. There were times last year
when I had my doubts about the
choice — shoot, I had maybe two
dates the entire year — but things
are much better now.
"Terry [Albritton, former
Stanford shotputter who dropped
out for many reasons, including
Stanford's social aridity] and I
had been used to all the social
stuff we had done at Newport
Harbor High. Between living in
the dorms and being freshmen,
the social life at Stanford was

almost non-existant. Everything ;
fun now, though."
Hogsett also had track troubles
as a freshman, but still ran well
enough to rank in Stanford's
all-time top 10. "There was still
some trouble with the scar tissue
in the back of my leg and I wasn't
running quite right. I guess I can
attribute most of my success this
year to [assistant coach] Vern
Gambetta.
"In the preseason he told me
to use my arms more in the finish.
I soon realized that the final 110
yards are not that hard and that's
about when I developed my fast
finish. I've got as much stamina as
most any hurdler.
"If I can hit those first two
hurdles a little faster and then
swing wide on the final hurdle
going into the backstretch, I think
I should run as good as 1 can in
the big meet," Hogsett said.
Thanks to a special qualifying
meet last Thursday, Stanford's
contingent participating in today's
first round of the NCAA
Championships at the University
of Texas in Austin will consist of
three instead of two men.
Pac-8 intermediate hurdle
champion Matt Hogsett and
veteran decathlete Ken Kring will
be joined by Tony Sandoval, who
qualified with one second to spare
in the six-mile in an 11th hour
clocking at a meet held for
Stanford and SJS runners.
This will be the first national
championship meet for Hogsett, a
sophomore, but both Kring and
Sandoval have been in NCAA

meets before. Kring placed ninth
in the national meet last year and
Sandoval ran in the NCAA
cross-country championships last
November.
