# Shrine Game Moves To Stanford Stadium
## 
### 
The Shrine East-West Football
Game, a popular post-season
all-star game, is moving to
Stanford Stadium.
The 50th annual Shrine Game
will be played December 28 in the
Stadium, which may become the
permanent location of the game,
depending on how things go this
year.
The game was previously
played in a variety of stadiums in
San Francisco, most recently
Candlestick Park.
Last year's game at Candlestick
drew only 32,017 spectators, so it
was decided to move the game to
Stanford Stadium. The game was
played here once before, in 1969,
and drew the largest attendance in
its history, 73,000, despite cold
weather.
The game is played for the
benefit of Shriners Hospitals for
Crippled Children and to the
Shriner Burns Institute. Over the
years, it has raised over $7
million.
The site switch follows the
appointment of Bob Murphy,
outgoing Stanford sports

information director, as executive
director of the Shrine Game.
Murphy indicated that the
game would be permanently
moved to the 86,000 seat Stadium
if this year's game was a sellout, a
goal he believes is within reach.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
was quoted as saying "Gettirig
Stanford Stadium should give the
game a new shot in the arm. I
know the community will be
solidly behind it, both Stanford
and the neighboring cities and
towns."
Ruetz said that the Santa Clara
County Assessor's Office
approved the game because both
the University and the charity ai;e
non-profit institutions.
Stanford, frequently
mentioned as a possible Super
Bowl site, has been unable to
accept bids from National
Football League clubs because of
fear it would lose its tax-exempt
status.
The two teams will continue to
work out locally, with the West
training at Stanford and the Cast
at Foothill College.
