# Frosh Crew Races
## 
### DAN PYNE 
As a result of their third place
finish at the Western Sprints last
month, the freshman crew has
been invited to compete at the
National Intercollegiate
Invitational Championships in
Seattle, Washington, June 20-22.
The oarsmen, coached by Dick
Dreissingacker (a member of the
1972 U.S. Olympic Crew) will be
competing against Washington,
which won the freshman race at
the Sprints, and Harvard,
generally considered the best
frosh crew in the East. Wisconsin,
winner of the freshman race at the
recent IRA regatta, is also
expected to attend. Cal, winner of
the "Big Row" over Stanford, will
not compete.
The Seattle championship races
are being held for the first time
this year, according to frosh

stroke Rick Tuttle. Although the
IRA regatta has been considered
the national championship in the
past, it is scheduled at an
academically awkward time for
western schools.
Tuttle said that it is generally
hoped that the Seattle race will
become the accepted national
championship race in the future.
Because the Washington varsity
is the best in the west, and the
Harvard varsity is the best in the
east, this year's varsity race will
essentially determine the best
collegiate crew in the country.
The eight men in the freshman
boat are Scooter Tow nsend, Scott
Clifford, Pete Kerman, Chuck
Harding, Pete VanOot, Miles
White, Randy Thomas and
Tuttle. Pam Meyer was the team's
coxswain at the Western Sprints.
