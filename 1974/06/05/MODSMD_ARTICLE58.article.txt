# Religious Survey Reveals Varied Backgrounds, Beliefs
## 
### 
Sixty-two percent of the students
in the 1973-74 "Stanford Religious
Survey" said that they "believe in a
God who is both infinite and
personal."
The survey, conducted by Campus
Crusade for Christ, has been taken the
past four years to map out students'
religious backgrounds and beliefs.

In addition to being asked 14
questions, students were given the
opportunity to comment on an outline
that summarizes what the New
Testament says about Christ.
The survey, conducted mostly with
the freshman class and a small segment
of upperclassmen and graduate
students, showed that 23 percent of

the students came from Roman
Catholic backgrounds.
Other significant denominations
were: Presbyterian, 13 percent;
Episcopal, 10 percent; Jewish, 10
percent and Methodist, seven percent.
Fourteen percent claimed no
denominational background. Of the
approximately 1000 who participated,
69 percent said they seldom or never
attend religious services.
When asked "What is the basic
problem of humanity?," 23 percent
cited self-centeredness and 13 percent
said a lack of understanding. Only four
percent, compared to 17 percent last
year, thought that lack of meaning and
purpose was man's basic problem.
About one-third of those surveyed
said their philosophies successfully
deal with man's basic problem on an
individual level, while another 24
percent said that their ideas would
even be successful on a more universal
scale.
Thirty-nine percent believe Jesus of
Nazereth to be the Son of God, a one
percent drop from last year. Other
students felt Jesus was a teacher or
philosopher (15 percent) or a good
man (13 percent). Fourteen percent
were unsure about his identity.
