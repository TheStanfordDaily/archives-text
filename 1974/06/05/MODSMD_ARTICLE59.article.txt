# Soph Named To New Position
## 
### 
Sophomore Jan Havens, a classics
major, has been appointed as
Committee-Staff Assistant tor fall
quarter, ASSU President Mike Herman
announced Monday.
The new position, recommended by
the Committee on Committees,
involves keeping the ASSU Senate
informed on what the various student
committees are doing. The duties also
include publishing a monthly
newsletter on the issues brought up in
committees, to be distributed to
senators and students.
Havens' experience includes serving
as a liaison between the faculty and
student council in high school, a job
she said was very similar to her new
undertaking. "I did it in high school

and 1 liked it," she said about her
reason for applying.
Havens will receive a salary of $40 a
month fall quarter.
The idea of a Committee-Staff
Assistant was one of the Herman
slate's campaign proposals. Herman
indicated that next quarter the
position will be "an experiment by the
Senate and the Council of Presidents."
Other duties of the position are to
make sure that all committees remain
filled, to organize meetings between
old and new members of committees
at the end of spring quarter and to
meet with each student group during
the beginning of fall quarter to discuss
plans for the year.
