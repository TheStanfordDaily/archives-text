# Will Face Gillmor In 12th District
## McCloskey Wins â€” Barely 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,
R-Menlo Park, narrowly defeated
Atherton businessman J. Gordon
Knapp in the Republican primary in
the 12th Congressional District, which
includes Stanford.
With 501 out of 502 precincts
reporting, McCloskey had won 29,325
votes, or 49.8 percent of the total.
Knapp garnered 28,485, or 48.4
percent. Palo Alto carpenter John
Fredrich received 1087 votes, or 1.8
percent.
Knapp led McCloskey throughout
much of the evening in a see-saw
struggle in which neither McCloskey
nor Knapp ever led by more than a
few percentage points.
In the Democratic primary, Santa
Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor won the
Democratic nomination.
Democratic Totals
With all but one precinct reporting,
Gillmor had won 17,614 votes, or 31.9
percent of the total. Palo Alto
attorney Thomas Skornia, Gillmor's
nearest rival, polled 16,101 votes, or
29.2 percent. Stanford employment
representative Herbert Rhodes ranked
third, with 11,232 votes, 20.4 percent.
Placing last was Mountain View
businessman Laurence Spitters, who
won 10,176 votes, or 18.5 percent.
In the Republican primary,
McCloskey was first believed to have
lost his bid for a sixth nomination by
his party. But shortly after midnight,
it became clear that McCloskey would
win.

Addressing hundreds of supporters
at Rickey's Hyatt House in Palo Alto,
McCloskey declared that he had
triumphed "against people who saw
fear and hate and anger."
'Last-Minute Efforts'
McCloskey noted that his victory
was possible only because of the
last-minute efforts of his supporters in
insuring a big voter turnout, citing this
as evidence that "all of us should stay
involved in the political process."
He predicted that his victory would
encourage congressmen in Washington
to proceed with the impeachment of
President Nixon. McCloskey has urged
impeachment, unlike Knapp.
Throughout the campaign,
McCloskey warned voters that he was
highly vulnerable, and told the Daily a
few days before the election that he
was "reconciled to whatever happens."
During the campaign, McCloskey
differed from Knapp on several key
issues, taking a much more liberal
position on most issues than his
opponent. McCloskey was more
inclined than Knapp to favor social
welfare measures and revision of the
national defense structure.
During the campaign, Knapp
frequently charged that McCloskey's
views failed to represent the

mainstream of Republican thought.
Knapp said he was especially angered
by a campaign conducted by
McCloskey supporters to register
Stanford students as Republicans so
they could vote for McCloskey in the
primary.
Gillmor and McCloskey have agreed
to limit their campaign spending for
the November election to $25,000.
During the campaign, Gillmor
strongly emphasized his record of
political participation in Santa Clara.
Conducting a low-profile campaign, he
relied heavily for support on his name
recognition in that area.
