# Harvard Or Stanford
## Lipset's Future Uncertain 
### JOHN FREED 
Confusion surrounds the question
of whether noted Harvard Government
Prof. Seymour Martin Lipset will
become a member of Stanford's
faculty next year.
In its May 20 edition, the Harvard
Crimson student newspaper reported
that Lipset, a professor of government
and social relations, rejected
Stanford's double appointment offer.
But Vice President and Provost
William F. Miller said Monday night
that Lipset had not yet made up his
mind "late last week."
"My information is not entirely
up-to-date, but I spoke to him last
week and he hadn't made up his mind.
It was very late in the week," Miller
said.
Stanford has offered Lipset two
positions — one, as a research associate
with Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace; the other, as a
professor of political science and
sociology.
Political Science Department
Chairman Heinz Eulau said Monday
that the negotiations with Lipset "did
not originate at the department level,"
and were being continued by the
Provost's office. Miller said the
negotiations, so far as he knew, were
continuing.
The Crimson reported that Lipset

had made up his mind to turn down
Stanford by May 29. The professor
refused further comment at the time
because he had not yet informed
Stanford of his decision, according to
the paper.
Late in April, when news of
Stanford's offer first became public,
Lipset was reportedly on the verge of
accepting the appointments.
"Harvard has its intellectual

merits . . . but we think we'd rather
live in California," Lipset said at the
time.
Once a sociology professor at
University of California at Berkeley,
Lipset went East in 1966. He has
written or edited more than a dozen
books, including two on the sociology
of political movements — Students and
Politics and Revolution and
Counterrevolution.
