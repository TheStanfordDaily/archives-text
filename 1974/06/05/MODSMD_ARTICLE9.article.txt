# UFW Needs Help

Rick Longinotti

In 1952 Cesar Chavez lived in
the barrio of East San Jose. His
contact with Stanford University
and its academics was not
favorable.
As he described his experiences
years later, "Stanford University
had people nosing around, writing
all kinds of screwy reports about
how Mexicans eat and sleep. . ..
These damn people used to talk
about 40- or 50-year patterns,
and how did we eat our beans and
tortillas, and whether we'd like to
live in a two-bedroom house
instead of a slum room.. ..
Anyway we were sick and tired of
these people coming around
asking stupid questions."
In 1973 Chavez said to a
Stanford audience, "Whenever the
union is in trouble we come to
Stanford for help." Stanford's
new reputation as a resource for
assistance in the farmworkers'
struggle has been earned over a
relatively short period of time in
comparison to its earlier
reputation for studying
impoverished people like bacteria
under a microscope.
Now once again we people of
this academic community have a
chance to prove in action that our
new reputation is not undeserved.
Fighting For Life
The union is once again
fighting for its life. Last year most
of the grape contracts, the Gallo
contract and some lettuce
contracts expired. The growers
refused to re-negotiate and instead
signed contracts with the
Teamsters Union, without ever
holding representation elections
or consulting workers as to the
terms of the new contract.
To culminate the disastrous
events, two UFW workers were
murdered while participating in
the grape strike.
Why do the Teamsters
double-cross the workers? The

Teamsters are an aging and
corrupt union whose primary
concern is to keep good relations
with the growers whose food they
ship. Any strike activity in the
fields rocks the boat for the
comparatively well-off truckers.
Cannery Worker Usurpation
These motivations were behind
the Teamster usurpation of the
AFL-CIO cannery workers
contracts in the 19505. Anyone
who argues that the Teamsters
really want to help farmworkers
only has to look at how much
they have helped the cannery
workers over 15 years.
The UFW is working on
legislation which will outlaw the
"sweetheart" contracts signed
without the consent of the
workers. But this bill may not be
passed for some time, since it will
not become law until after Reagan
is out of office. Even if it does
become law it will not win new
contracts for the UFW. That is
why the union relies so heavily on
the support of people in urban
areas â€” without the boycott there
will be no contracts.
The union needs volunteers
this summer to organize the
boycott of Gallo, grapes and
iceberg lettuce in numerous cities
across the United States.
Volunteers are supplied with
room and board plus five dollars
per week. In addition the union
needs volunteer doctors, nurses
and lawyers.
The union always needs
money, but particularly at this
crucial time. Ask for volunteer
applications or send checks to:
United Farmworkers of America,
AFL-CIO, P.O. Box 62, Keene,
Ca. 93531.
