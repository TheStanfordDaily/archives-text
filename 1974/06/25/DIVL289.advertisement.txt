This petition is for ALL members of the BARGAINING UNIT who
wish to express their resentment towards USE. The petition
committee asks you to help sign up your fellow staffers. Write your
reasons why you are against USE as this establishes the majority's
voice. If you would like to help us say so and give times and what
you would like to do.
Why should you sign the petition against USE? If you are not
satisfied in any way with the way they are representing you at the
bargaining table with Stanford or railroading you into paying dues,
or have no voice in the matter and want one, sign the petition and
watch what a firm majority of members of the BARGAINING
UNIT CAN DO TOGETHER.
