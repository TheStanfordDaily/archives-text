# Addresses 12,000 At Commencement
## Cox Explains Worth Of Individual Effort 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
Archibald Cox, former
Watergate special prosecutor,
explained his belief "that the little
bit that one can hope to do in his
own time makes it worth
persevering in the effort," to more
than 12,000 people gathered for
Stanford's 83rd commencement
June 16.
Beneath broken clouds which
brought both rain and sunshine to
2000 graduates, their parents and
friends, Cox, now Williston
Professor of Law at Harvard,
optimistically outlined the good
side of both Watergate and the
American situation in general.
"But there is another side to
Watergate," said Cox. "The
response has proved the
conscience of the nation. It is
more important that our idealism
is a live and vital force than that
some men have proven
untrustworthy."
Citing New Deal economic
reforms and the civil rights
movement, Cox said, "Granted
that the tasks are unfinished,
granted too that the resulting
bureaucracy often seems remote
and unmanageable, still may we
not have some confidence in a
system that can produce two great
egalitarian revolutions in 40 years
within a framework of
constitutionalism?"
Throughout his speech, Cox
stressed that "Procedural fairness
does not depend on whose ox is
being gored." Cox clearly
condemned recent news leaks
from the House Judiciary
Committee, commenting, "The
similar incidents have been too
numerous to excuse them by
careless slips of the tongue alone."
In reference to the
impeachment trial which he feels
is necessary, Cox held that, "The
manner in which the proceedings
are conducted — the role of
reason, the degree of impartiality,
the degree of effort to achieve
justice — will affect our
self-confidence more than the
vote."
At a June 15 press conference,
Cox described the Watergate
investigation as being "like
stripping one leaf at a time from
the artichoke," but professed a

belief that it's "better to do it
right than to do it fast."
In a personal effort to keep the
investigation fair, Cox refused to
answer questions about the
specific findings made while he
was special prosecutor, saying, "1
can't answer questions about what
I found or didn't find. It just
would be improper."
Cox charged that it was unfair
for the government to charge a
man with a crime "while at the
same time withholding evidence
that could exculpate him," and
said that "all the evidence
available to the President should
be made available to the special
prosecutor and the House
Judiciary Committee."
Asked if he thought
impeachment is necessary, Cox
replied "I think so; a court
decision doesn't settle everything
or satisfy everyone," and called

impeachment "the only way to
make sure there is no further
coverup."
While Cox expressed "dismay,
scorn and contempt for those who
were involved in misdeeds," he
was reluctant to condemn the
light sentences being given to
some of the Watergate
conspirators, and said, "I think
five years is just about long
enough for just about anyone for
just about any crime."
Cox said that the "best
evidence" in the Watergate
investigation would be "live
witnesses and the actual
recordings," and, consonant with
his belief that right will prevail in
the end, said, "I would suspect
that the Supreme Court would
rule that evidence subpoenaed
should be turned over.
"However, that's just one
lawyer's guess."

own time makes it worth
persevering in the effort," to more
than 12,000 people gathered for
Stanford's 83rd commencement
June 16.
Beneath broken clouds which
brought both rain and sunshine to
2000 graduates, their parents and
friends, Cox, now Williston
Professor of Law at Harvard,
optimistically outlined the good
side of both Watergate and the
American situation in general.
"But there is another side to
Watergate," said Cox. "The
response has proved the
conscience of the nation. It is
more important that our idealism
is a live and vital force than that
some men have proven
untrustworthy."
Citing New Deal economic
reforms and the civil rights
movement, Cox said, "Granted
that the tasks are unfinished,
granted too that the resulting
bureaucracy often seems remote
and unmanageable, still may we
not have some confidence in a
system that can produce two great
egalitarian revolutions in 40 years
within a framework of
constitutionalism?"
Throughout his speech, Cox
stressed that "Procedural fairness
does not depend on whose ox is
being gored." Cox clearly
condemned recent news leaks
from the House Judiciary
Committee, commenting, "The
similar incidents have been too
numerous to excuse them by
careless slips of the tongue alone."
In reference to the
impeachment trial which he feels
is necessary, Cox held that, "The
manner in which the proceedings
are conducted — the role of
reason, the degree of impartiality,
the degree of effort to achieve
justice — will affect our
self-confidence more than the
vote."
At a June 15 press conference,
Cox described the Watergate
investigation as being "like
stripping one leaf at a time from
the artichoke," but professed a

belief that it's "better to do it
right than to do it fast."
In a personal effort to keep the
investigation fair, Cox refused to
answer questions about the
specific findings made while he
was special prosecutor, saying, "1
can't answer questions about what
I found or didn't find. It just
would be improper."
Cox charged that it was unfair
for the government to charge a
man with a crime "while at the
same time withholding evidence
that could exculpate him," and
said that "all the evidence
available to the President should
be made available to the special
prosecutor and the House
Judiciary Committee."
Asked if he thought
impeachment is necessary, Cox
replied "I think so; a court
decision doesn't settle everything
or satisfy everyone," and called

impeachment "the only way to
make sure there is no further
coverup."
While Cox expressed "dismay,
scorn and contempt for those who
were involved in misdeeds," he
was reluctant to condemn the
light sentences being given to
some of the Watergate
conspirators, and said, "I think
five years is just about long
enough for just about anyone for
just about any crime."
Cox said that the "best
evidence" in the Watergate
investigation would be "live
witnesses and the actual
recordings," and, consonant with
his belief that right will prevail in
the end, said, "I would suspect
that the Supreme Court would
rule that evidence subpoenaed
should be turned over.
"However, that's just one
lawyer's guess."
