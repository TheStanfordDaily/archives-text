### 
A professor of religious studies
and the director of the Stanford
University Press were among the
2000 recipients of undergraduate
and graduate degrees at the 83rd
annual commencement exercises
June 16.
Edwin M. Good, a specialist in
the Old Testament and an
accomplished pianist who has
made many concert appearances
in recent years received the master
of arts degree in music (MA)
performance/practice.
Leon Seltzer, who has been
director of the University Press
since 1956, was awarded the
degree of doctor of jurisprudence
from the Law School. (When
contracted. Seltzer said he did not
want any publicity. He said it was
a personal accomplishment.)
Both obtained approvals from
all departments concerned, the
Committee on Graduate Studies
and the Faculty Senate to obtain
their degrees.

Good was born in the French
West African Camerouns of
missionary parents. He grew up in
Ohio, playing the piano at age 6
and the string bass and tuba in his
high school orchestra and band.
When Good arrived at
Westminster College in
Pennsylvania he wanted to be
either a professional musician or
teacher, but another strong
interest intervened and ho turned
toward the ministry.
He earned a bachelor of
divinity degree at Union
Theological Seminary and a
doctorate in religion at Columbia
University.
After he earned his degrees, he
taught at Union and at Princeton
before joining the faculty here 18
years ago.
In 1965, Good resumed his
musical career, first taking lessons,
then playing recitals. In 1967 and
1968 he played several recitals in
Tresidder Union and was

accompanist to Violinist David
Goldsmith in chamber recitals in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
After a 1972 concert Good
said of his second career,
"Working for the degree has been
a challenge, and the discipline has
been good for me. It's been a
matter of improving my own
musical skills and knowledge up
to the maximum pitch."
Good said recently that he
does not think the master's degree
in music would change his life. "I
took the work on to meet it. I
look forward to continuing to
perform as a pianist and to teach
my courses in religious studies
with pleasure as always."
Good is a former University
Fellow and former chairman of
the Academic Senate's Committee
on Undergraduate Studies. His
talents include acting and singing;
he recently played a starring role
as the Judge in the Stanford
Savoyard's "lolanthe."
