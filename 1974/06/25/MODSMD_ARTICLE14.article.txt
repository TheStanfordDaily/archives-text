# Palo Alto Paramedics To Serve Campus
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Beginning in January, sick and
injured people at Stanford will
receive advanced emergency care
from a new city of Palo Alto
paramedic program, approved last
night by the city council.
Physicians and nurses at
Stanford Hospital will teach a
12-week, 500-hour course this fall
for the 12 Palo Alto firemen who
will become paramedics.
In addition, the hospital has
promised to purchase about
$8,000 of communication

equipment, and to supervise the
paramedics once the program
begins, at a cost of $22,000
annually.
The architect and major
advocate of the paramedic plan is
Dr. Michael Eliastam, Stanford
emergency room director.
Together with Palo Alto Fire
Chief William Dorff, Eliastam
developed the current proposal
and worked for city council
support.
A two-man paramedic team
will respond to any medical

emergency call in Palo Alto,
Stanford or Barron Park, together
with an ambulance and an engine
from the appropriate fire
department.
Under the plan, firemen will
arrive within three minutes, begin
first aid, and tell the paramedics
by radio whether to continue
their response.
The paramedics, based at Palo
Alto's Mayfield fire station, will
arrive within ten minutes. They
will take ovtr first aid, attempt to
stabilize the patient, and then
accompany him to the hospital in
a private ambulance.
The paramedics will consult
emergency room staff by radio,
transmitting telemetered
electrocardiograms, blood
pressure, pulse and other physical
symptoms.
Physicians and nurses at the
hospital can then make a diagnosis
and prescribe treatment and
drugs.
The paramedics will be able to
administer drugs and intravenous
solutions, treat heart attacks with
electric shock and provide other
sophisticated care.
The paramedics will be regular
firemen, who respond to major
fire calls as well as medical
emergencies. They will rotate in
the paramedic positions, working
there about half the time.
Financing is the major
remaining question delaying the
program. Initial training and
equipment and salaries will be
$68,000.
The city staff had initially
proposed a tax-supported service,
like current police and fire
protection, but city council
members objected.
Now a council committee has
recommended a flat fee of $40 for
paramedic service, to pay for part
of the system. The city, together
with Stanford and Barron Park,
would subsidize the remainder of
the paramedic program.
The $40 fee, together with the
cost of ambulance transportation,
would boost the cost of
out-of-hospital care above $100

for each patient.
Opponents of the fee plan
argue that it may deter calls for
minor heart attacks and other
hard-to-diagnose ailments. They
also say the process of billing
patients and collecting debts is
more trouble than it is worth.
About eight patients are
brought by ambulance to the
Stanford emergency room daily,
with a life-threatening case every
two days.
Eliastam expects the demand
for emergency services to increase
dramatically after the paramedic
system begins. He hopes to

expand the program, or to start
others, within two years.
The Stanford Fire Department
will apparently accept the Palo
Alto program, but Stanford Fire
Chief Frank Jurian says he would
rather operate one of his own.
Some Stanford firemen may
take the paramedic training
course, but the University has not
budgeted the $50,000 necessary
for a vehicle and equipment.
Palo Alto officials, advocating
their program, argue that each
jurisdiction cannot economically
operate its own program.
