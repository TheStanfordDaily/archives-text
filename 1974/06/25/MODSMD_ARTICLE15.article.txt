# Television To Replace Books, Michener Says
## 
### 
, By the end of the century,
television will replace books as the
major means of influencing
society, Pulitzer prize-winning
author James A. Michener stated
last week at a three-day
conference here.
Thirty-two American and Latin
American editors participated in
the conference on
"Communications in the
Americas."
Although Michener said he
realized long ago that television
would eventually overpower
books, he decided to write books
in order to reach the elite. They
would still read, he said, even with
the advent of television.
In regard to today's society,
Michener said, "Not as many
people are reading, but more of
the right people are."
Eventually television will
educate 70 percent of society, he
predicted, while the other 30 will
approach education with the more
traditional "Socratic" method.
Thirty Percent
Of that 30 percent Michener
remarked, "I believe it is
impossible to run a society
without such men and women."

Michener deplored the scarcity
of Latin American writers on the
international book scene.
"All of my life I have been the
poorer for it,"he said.
The problem is that the United
States and Latin America are so
oriented towards Europe that
they mutually exclude each other,
Michener remarked.
'Intellectual Underground'
He suggested the Latin
Americans should form an
"intellectual underground" to
pressure for English publication of
talented Latin American writers.
But there is a lack of consensus
among Latin Americans on who
their best writers are, Michener
said. The Latin countries have a
hard time deciding which books
should be translated into English,
he added.
Michener praised the Nobel
prize committee for helping tc
draw worldwide attention to
worthy but relatively obscure
authors.
He also urged more
international cultural exchanges,
remarking, "I am the child of the
interchange of ideas and without
them 1 would have been nothing."
