New Chicano Advisor Appointed
U.S. Civil Rights Commission staffer Cecilia Preciado de
Burciaga will assume the position of assistant to the
President for chicano affairs July 15, President Richard
Lyman announced last week.
Burciaga, 29, will fill the post vacated when Lyman
promoted former chicano affairs adviser Salvador Sanchez
to special assistant to the President last October. Thirteen
chicano students, faculty, workers and staff have served as
an ad hoc interim "executive committee" to coordinate
chicano affairs until a new adviser was found.
Lyman praised Burciaga's "record of solid
accomplishment" in education, government and chicano
affairs, including contributions to a new five-volume Civil
Rights Commission study on chicano education.
Burciaga graduated from California State
University-Fullerton in 1967, received her teaching
credential there in 1968 and earned her master's from
UC-Riverside in 1972.
Senate Adopts New Tenure Rules
In its final session of the academic year, the Faculty
Senate decided individuals denied tenure should have the
right to request a summary of the rationale for this
decision within 60 days after they are informed of the
outcome.
Those denied tenure will also have at least one
academic year to find employment elsewhere and
department chairmen will annually offer to confer with
non-tenured faculty to review their performance in
teaching and scholarship.
The approved proposals were among the
recommendations in the Report on the Professoriate.
Action on remaining recommendations will wait until fall
when the 1974-75 Faculty Senate convenes.
The package of proposals is designed to tighten up
procedures followed in tenure decisions.
The changes are expected to be incorporated into the
University's basic policy on appointments and tenure
following consideration by the President and the Board of
Trustees.
The Senate decision called for candidates to be
"informed promptly in writing" when formal decisions are
reached not to continue their appointments, not to renew
or not to promote them.
A written rationale spelling out the grounds on which
the decision was made "shall be summarized orally and /or
in writing to the candidate by the provost or his delegate"

if requested by the candidate within 60 days after being
informed of the decision.
Two New Professorships Filled
Two newly-endowed professorships, one in history and
the other in international law, have been filled. President
Richard Lyman announced last week.
History Prof. Peter D.L. Stansky, a noted scholar of
modern British history here, will hold the Frances and
Charles Field professorship of history, while Law Prof.
Victor Li, one of the western world's leading scholars of
Chinese law, will hold the Lewis Talbot Shelton and
Nadine Hearn Shelton chair in international legal studies.
The new history chair is the first to be established by a
department graduate.
Stansky, a graduate of Yale, also holds both a B.A. and
an M.A. from King's College in Cambridge and a Ph.D.
from Harvard. He won the Doncaster prize in history at
Cambridge and taught at Harvard before coming here in
1968.
Stansky currently holds a John Simon Guggenheim
fellowship to study art, society and politics in England in
the 1890s.
Li has been active in the East Asian Studies program
and the new U.S.-China relations program here. He will
serve as director of the University's Center for East Asian
Studies next year.
Li holds a B.A. and J.D. from Columbia, LL.M. and
S.J.D. degrees from Harvard. He joined the faculty here in
1971 and was promoted to full professor earlier this year.
Pauling Signs Mercy Killing Appeal
Nobel Laureate and Emeritus Chemistry Prof. Linus
Pauling has joined 39 other signers of a statement calling
for "benefit euthanasia," mercy killing of incurably ill
patients.
The statement, published earlier this month in the
July-August issue of The Humanist magazine,
recommended establishing a "living will" for people who
believe in euthanasia.
Drafted before a person became ill, this will would
allow people to request euthanasia legally and maintain
"the right to die with dignity," the statement said.
This willed euthanasia is voluntary and "follows from a
person's own free conscience to control both his life and,
to some extent, his death," according to the statement.
"Often physicians and families, unable to bear a
terminal patient's torture, permit acts of euthanasia to

occur, but with great fear and secrecy. It is time that
society faced this moral dilemma openly," it added.
Pauling, who received Nobel awards for peace and for
chemistry, serves as director of Orthomolecular Medicine
in Menlo Park and retired from teaching here only weeks
ago.
Two foreign Nobel laureates and a host of this nation's
university professors also signed the euthanasia appeal.
Prof Blasts Syphillis Study Defense
Dr. Count Gibson, chairman of the Medical School's
Department of Community and Preventive Medicine, has
harshly criticized Emeritus Medicine Prof. Charles Barnett
and another doctor for their defenses of the controversial
Tuskegge Syphillis Study in which 399 black males
allegedly were left untreated for the disease since 1932.
Gibson's rebuttal appeared in the latest issue of
Stanford M.D. after Barnett criticized press and public
reaction to the study in the February issue of the same
publication.
Barnett claimed there was "no evidence that treatment
was deliberately withheld from untreated patients" and
that it was probable the subjects failed to get treatment
"by their own choice."
Gibson argued that the information offered to the
patients and the researchers' attempts to elicit consent for
the study may have been inadequate.
"It is extremely difficult if not impossible for members
of an oppressed group to give full and free consent to
representatives of a dominant group," he said.
He also accused the study's educated white researchers
of exploiting poor, undeducated blacks for the benefit of
middle-class Americans and suggested that the
"honorable" method of study would have been for the
researchers to infect themselves with the disease.
New Legal Program Funded
The Carnegie Corporation of New York has granted the
University $263,100 over a two-year period to establish a
new legal education program focusing on sex
discrimination and the law.
The program will enable third-yar law students to gain
practical experience by working with Equal Rights
Advocates, Inc., a San Francisco-based public interest law
firm specializing in sex discrimination law.
Law School faculty and firm members will develop the
program jointly, with Assoc. Law Prof. Barbara Babcock
as director.
