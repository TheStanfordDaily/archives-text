# Heart Donor's Killer Gets Prison Term
## 
### 
The convicted slayer of a man
whose heart was removed for a
transplant was sentenced to one
to fifteen years in prison, June 12.
Alameda County Superior
Court Judge William J. Hayes,
who had ruled that death occurs
when the brain stops functioning,
imposed the sentence on Andrew
I). Lyons, 37, in the gunshot
murder last Sept. 10 of Samuel M.
Allen, Jr., 29. Lyons was
convicted last month by a jury.
During the trial, defense
attorney John Cruikshank argued
that the cause of Allen's death
wasn't the gunshot wound, but
the removal of his heart, for
transplant to another man at the
Stanford Medical Center.
Heart surgeon Norman
Shumway of the Medical Center
helped remove Allen's heart at
Oakland's Highland Hospital and
transplant it into Blaine Wixom of
Salt Lake City. Wixom died a
month later.
Shumway testified at the trial
that "an individual is dead when
his brain is dead." He said that
there was no question in his mind
that Allen was dead before he
helped remove Allen's heart.
In his instructions to the jury,
Hayes ruled that death occurred
when Allen's brain ceased to
function, although his heart
continued to beat.
