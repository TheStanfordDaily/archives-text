Gimmick: Daily astrology queen. Works mostly at night. 3. Uh-uhh. Cornstalk Cox. Gimmick: Sado-masochistic engineering major.
Docs weird things with electricity. 4. Are you kidding? That's Viae. Gimmick: Smokes Camel Filters. 5. No. She's Bonny, star
thespian. Gimmick: Played a flirt in a Russian play last month. Same role off-stage. 6. Right. That's Bruce, beleaguered summer editor.
