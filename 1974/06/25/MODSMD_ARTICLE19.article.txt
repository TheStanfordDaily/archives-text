# 'Disciplines' Presents Student Poetry
## 
### KAREN KAUSER 
Disciplines, a book of poetry
and art, is a visual and literary
delight. The brainchild of three
Stanford seniors, Jill Greenwood,
Jack Kenealy and Gene Richie,
the book is a total work of art.
The blend of illustrations and
poems gives the book an organic
unity, and a sense of
completeness.
Disciplines is visually striking,
due to Greenwood's skillful and
confident art work. Her figures
crawl and sprawl across the pages,
striking poses that capture the
moods of the poems in a single
symbol.
It would be unfair and
inaccurate to say that
Greenwood's drawings merely
support the individual poems. The
art work gives the book a
continuity that is all its own. By
using a single design throughout
the book, Greenwood was free to
experiment with refinements and
nuances that bring imagination
and sensitivity to her illustrations.
Each figure becomes an
interpretation of an otherwise

inexpressable feeling. I can't
imagine Disciplines without the
drawings; they complete the
thoughts of the poems while they
provoke you to turn to the next
page.
It is difficult to characterize
Richie's poetry without seeming
to set a limitation on its scope.
This poetry is an attempt to
capture those feelings that we all
sense, but keep hidden just
beyond our grasp. An example,
from "Eagle's Claw":
as there is no discord
between the eagle
and the eagle's claw
nor between
the talon and the talon's
touch, so too; she
as desire in me, near
fire under evening.
Although this is only a portion
of one poem, it illustrates Richie's
primitive and vital style that
draws its strength from
unexpected combinations of
images. In this short quotation,
Gene's images are those of
wholeness (the eagle and its claw
or the toucher and the thing

touched) juxtaposed with the
near-unity of the last stanza.
The violent images of claw and
talon do not prepare the reader
for the quiet, peaceful desire of
the last stanza. Through the use of
these seemingly dissimilar images,
Richie expresses an indefinable,
hidden emotion in a manner that
intrigues the reader.
The sets of poems "Heel of
Distance" and "where are all the
Indian women" exemplify the
sensitivity and freshness of
Richie's writing. Full of colors
and run-on words, the poems
capture all of the teeming beauty
of Minnesota and Montana.
Richie envisions this now
fallow, unrenewed land as it once
wasâ€”fresh, fertile and stunning:
Thunder in the bottom of a
steel-blue storm
cloud, white breasted,
sweat-backed swallows
break and gather from evening
harbourages.
A sense of struggle, both with
the expression of human
emotions, and against the threat
of sterility, animates Richie's

poetry. But these are not the only
themes, as you should discover for
yourself.
Kenealy's poetic voice is as rich
and varied as California, the
subject of his poems. His poetry is
most successful when his sense of
contrast and irony reinforces his
images.
Kenealy often experiments
with rhyme and meter, but his use
of vowel sounds and alliteration is
particularly effective. In the poem
"Grandfather" Jack masters these
techniques, using sounds to
convey nuances of emotion:
Your child and grandchild and
your great grandchild
wait on your wife and younger
brother.
Passing carrots and peas and
beans, they wait
while the kitchened widow
kindles the fire
heat fills her shallow cheeks,
lightens her eyes.
or:
The sea swallows the dangling
sun at dusk
but the water only grays, earth
is dust.
The ironic tone of the poem is
accomplished subtly; the setting is
a family holiday dinner, but the
mood is that of a funeral.
Kenealy's work conveys his
strong sense of the presence of the
past all around us. While

"Grandfather" is one expression
of the vitality of the past, the
"Carmel poems" present a slightly
different reaction.
"Cannery Row/Use Right
Lane" is both a reproach and a
regret; a reproach for the
Californians who would capitalize
on the slumbering past of a small
town, and a regret that the town's
history has been leveled and paved
over. Both parts of the poem
contain sharp, ironic images that
compel the reader to share the
poet's disgust:
This is a sad place,
this bread
line of buildings,
this rust
in a tin cup.
Kenealy's poetry can be warm
and personal, as in
"Merced-Oakdale Express," or
precise and analytical, as in "Les
Hallea" His awareness and skillful use
of language is always surprising,
powerful, and delightful.
I don't know why or how an
artist or poet finds peculiar
significance in a particular
moment; nor do I understand
what compels him to
communicate his experience to
other people.
Disciplines, on sale at the
Stanford Bookstore and at
Kepler's, is an invitation to
explore and share in the unique
and artful perceptions of its three
creators. It is an invitation I think
you should accept.
