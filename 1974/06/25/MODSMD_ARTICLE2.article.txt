## Shultz Appointed Business Professor 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
George P. Shultz, former
secretary of the Treasury and
Labor departments, has been
appointed to the faculty of the
University's Graduate School of
Business, Dean Arjay Miller
announced June 11. The
appointment will be effective
Sept. 1.
Shultz, who accepted in
mid-May a post as executive vice
president and member of the
Board of Directors of the Bechtel
Corp. in San Francisco, made his
part-time affiliation with the
University known during his
recent trip to the Bay Area to
attend a Bechtel Corp. board
meeting and to search for a home.
Shultz's official title here will
be professor of management and
public policy. His interests in the
area range across a wide variety of
substantive issues and
organizational arrangements,
including international and
domestic problems.
Samuel Pond, associate dean of
the GSB, said yesterday that
having Shultz on the faculty "is
going to mean a tremendous
amount to us." Pond added that
Shultz would be associated with a
group of outstanding faculty in

the area of public policy and
management.
In May, when the department
voted unanimously to offer the
position to Shultz, Miller said,
"Shultz is a distinguished scholar
and would add an important
dimension to our programs. His .
governmental experience would
fit in well with our studies in
public management."
Following., the appointment,
Miller noted that "Shultz has

achieved eminence in several
different worlds — as a recognized
scholar, as an outstanding
educator, and, for the last five
years, as a brilliant cabinet officer
and one of President Nixon's most
trusted advisers. We consider
ourselves very fortunate that he
has chosen to come to Stanford."
Provost William F. Miller said
he is "elated for the University
and for the Business School,"
calling the Shultz appointment "a

coup for Stanford and the clearest
evidence of the tremendous
intellectual excitement generated
by the Business School's
programs."
Shultz, 53, retired in May as
treasury secretary after serving
more than five years in the Nixon
Administration. He was the last
original member of Nixon's
Cabinet to leave the service of the
Administration.
