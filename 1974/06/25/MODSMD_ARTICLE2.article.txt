## Shultz Appointed Business Professor 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
George P. Shultz, former
secretary of the Treasury and
Labor departments, has been
appointed to the faculty of the
University's Graduate School of
Business, Dean Arjay Miller
announced June 11. The
appointment will be effective
Sept. 1.
Shultz, who accepted in
mid-May a post as executive vice
president and member of the
Board of Directors of the Bechtel
Corp. in San Francisco, made his
part-time affiliation with the
University known during his
recent trip to the Bay Area to
attend a Bechtel Corp. board
meeting and to search for a home.
Shultz's official title here will
be professor of management and
public policy. His interests in the
area range across a wide variety of
substantive issues and
organizational arrangements,
including international and
domestic problems.
Samuel Pond, associate dean of
the GSB, said yesterday that
having Shultz on the faculty "is
going to mean a tremendous
amount to us." Pond added that
Shultz would be associated with a
group of outstanding faculty in

the area of public policy and
management.
In May, when the department
voted unanimously to offer the
position to Shultz, Miller said,
"Shultz is a distinguished scholar
and would add an important
dimension to our programs. His .
governmental experience would
fit in well with our studies in
public management."
Following., the appointment,
Miller noted that "Shultz has

achieved eminence in several
different worlds â€” as a recognized
scholar, as an outstanding
educator, and, for the last five
years, as a brilliant cabinet officer
and one of President Nixon's most
trusted advisers. We consider
ourselves very fortunate that he
has chosen to come to Stanford."
Provost William F. Miller said
he is "elated for the University
and for the Business School,"
calling the Shultz appointment "a

coup for Stanford and the clearest
evidence of the tremendous
intellectual excitement generated
by the Business School's
programs."
Shultz, 53, retired in May as
treasury secretary after serving
more than five years in the Nixon
Administration. He was the last
original member of Nixon's
Cabinet to leave the service of the
Administration.
Serving as secretary of labor
from 1969 to 1971, he was later
director of the Office of
Management and the Budget.
In May, 1972, Shultz
succeeded John Connally as
Secretary of the Treasury, serving
until May.
While at the Treasury
Department, Shultz also served as
assistant to the President for
economic affairs and was
chairman of the Council of
Economic Policy, a group Shultz
was responsible for setting up.
Shultz served at Stanford at
the beginning of the 1968-1969
academic year as a Fellow at the
Center for Advanced Study in the

Behavioral Sciences, before
becoming a member of Nixon's
cabinet.
An economist by tiaining,
Shultz graduated with honors
from Princeton University in
1942, where he was a member of
the football and basketball teams.
Following service as a major in the
U.S. Marine Corps during World
War 11, he received a Ph.D. degree
in industrial economics from MIT
in 1949.
Shultz was a professor at MIT
from 1949-1957, when he joined
the faculty of the University of
Chicago's Graduate School of
Business. He became dean of
Chicago's Business School in
1962.
