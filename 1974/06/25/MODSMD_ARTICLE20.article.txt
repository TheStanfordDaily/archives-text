# Dead, Beach Boys Begin Graham's Green Summer
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Billy Graham opened his
outdoor summer season June 8
with the Grateful Dead, the Beach
Boys, the New Riders of the
Purple Sage and Commander
Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen
in the Oakland Coliseum. The
weather cooperated and the
result was a good day of music
"on the green."
With the stage set up at the
edge of center field in the
stadium, the sound varied
throughout the park. Most of the
crowd stood or sat on the field
where echoes from the stands
were noticeable but not
disastrous.
Aside from the echoes, the
Dead's sound system managed to
provide the whole stadium with
adequate sound without blasting
out the first twenty rows of the

audience. The mammoth speaker
towers once again provided the
cleanest sound imaginable
without a hint of distortion.
The Dead came up with a
typical couple of sets, including
some new tunes which are
presumably to be found on their
new album From the Mars Hotel.
Familiar tunes included most of
their Europe '72 numbers and
"Promised Land," "Me and
Bobby McGee," "Mexicali Blues,"
"It Must Have Been The Roses,"
"Greatest Story Ever Told," "Big
River," "Ship of Fools," "Playing
in the Band," "Wharf Rat," and
"Eyes of the World."
The Dead's encore was their
current laid-back version of
"Casey Jones," which they
blended nicely into "One More
Saturday Night."
The Beach Boys, who hit the

stage shortly after noon, seemed
perfectly suited to the sunny,
shirtless day. As they sang such
old hits as "Wouldn't It Be Nice,"
"Little Deuce Coupe," "Surfer
Girl" and "Good Vibrations," it
was not hard to imagine the same
crowd of people gathered a few
years back somewhere in L.A.,
soaking up the sun and getting off
on the lyrics about surfing, hot
cars and cool nights on the
beaches.
The Beach Boys did sing some
newer material, but the crowd was
obviously up for the oldies, so
they finished with a triple encore
of "California Girls," "Surfin'
USA," and "Fun, Fun, Fun."
Backstage at the Coliseum, Bill
Graham discussed a few rumors
about other musical events
scheduled for this summer. About
the possibility of another Stones

appearance, he said "No way."
Of course, Graham's second
"day on the Green" in Oakland,
featuring Crosby, Stills, Nash and
Young, The Band and Joe Walsh
and Barnstrom, is proceeding

according to plan. There are
better places acoustically than the
Oakland Coliseum, but the
stadium's capacity is more or less
a prerequisite for a concert like
this one.

STILL STlLLS—Stephen Stills, recently leading Manassas, will reunite
with the other three members of one of rock's most famous
quartets—Neil Young, Graham Nash, and David Crosby—as Bill
Graham presents the next day on the green, July 14.
