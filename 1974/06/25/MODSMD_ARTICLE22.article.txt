# 'Holy Mountain' Pushes Cinematic Limits
## 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
Alexandro Jodorowsky's The
Holy Mountain combines
elements of BV2, Satyricon, A
Clockwork Orange, and The
Exorcist to be the kinkiest movie
yet.
Nudity, gore, bizarre behavior,
the occult, mass castrations and
even human excrement are its
stock in trade. As was evidenced
in Jodorowski's earlier film, El
Topo, his purpose in using film is
not to entertain, transform,
educate, enlighten or inspire. His
interest is in the exploration of
realms the commercial medium
has not yet covered.
Although The Holy Mountain
is often obscene, it is not
pornographic; nowhere is the
purpose of its obscenity the
titillation of the prurient.
Rather, the destruction of
myths upon which modern
culture is based seems to be
Jodorowsky's aim. He is actually
saying, "You have already
destroyed all your myths; I am
merely pointing out how empty
and meaningless they have
become. No blasphemy offends
you any longer. See?"
After a slow rambling start

which seems to take up where El
Topo left off, an ever-so-slight
story line is developed in which
the protagonist becomes one of
eight searchers for the holy
mountain, the common
denominator of all myths offering
a paradise of eternal life. The hero
is a Christ figure in the most
superficial sense—he is dressed in a
loincloth and bearded, and in one
scene he is placed on a
crucifix—but he never forgives
anyone's sins or heals their
infirmities.
Together with representatives
of seven other planets, the Christ
figure follows a seer (played by
Jodorowsky) who has mastered all
the world religions to find the
holy mountain.
The substance of the film is the
ritual by which each planetary
representative Introduces himself.
Each symbolizes some form of
modern decadence; the
earth-Christ figure himself
represents the quest for gold,
which the seer demonstrates can
be manufactured from his own
defecation. Others are into war,
exploitation of children, and
varieties of sexual debauchery and
mystical experience.

When all eight members of the
party have shown their
weaknesses or sins, they join
together under the unidentified
but clearly satanic seer on their
quest for the mountain. There are
endless complications en route,
but they finally gather at a
picnic-like table at what is
described as the summit.
The seer begins a speech which
presumably will unlock the secrets
of the mount, but instead of
addressing his disciples, he is
addressing the audience. The
camera zooms back from the
group to display a working set,
and the devil Jodorowsky tells us
that the film is the holy
mountain, our only place of
eternal life, the only myth
modern man has saved for
himself.

Others have already expressed
the view that the movies are the
church of modern man, the place
in which spiritual union is
accomplished, sin is confessed,
death is escaped, and hope
restored.
It wouldn't matter much how
effective the film is—as it is, it
ranks somewhere around the
recent Andy Warhol releases—and
if that is the film's statement, it
has to be taken seriously. Though
nowhere brilliant, it is certainly
striking, arresting, sensual and by
force of its exploration of the
sexual-physiological fantasy
world, engrossing.
In the final reading it says we
are all meaningless dead ducks,
which may explain why
"Jodorowsky appears fatigued and
bored by the project" in one

critic's preview. If I had his
optimism about the nature and
end of human life, I too would be
fatigued and more than bored.

quest for the mountain. There are
endless complications en route,
but they finally gather at a
picnic-like table at what is
described as the summit.
The seer begins a speech which
presumably will unlock the secrets
of the mount, but instead of
addressing his disciples, he is
addressing the audience. The
camera zooms back from the
group to display a working set,
and the devil Jodorowsky tells us
that the film is the holy
mountain, our only place of
eternal life, the only myth
modern man has saved for
himself.

Others have already expressed
the view that the movies are the
church of modern man, the place
in which spiritual union is
accomplished, sin is confessed,
death is escaped, and hope
restored.
It wouldn't matter much how
effective the film is—as it is, it
ranks somewhere around the
recent Andy Warhol releases—and
if that is the film's statement, it
has to be taken seriously. Though
nowhere brilliant, it is certainly
striking, arresting, sensual and by
force of its exploration of the
sexual-physiological fantasy
world, engrossing.
In the final reading it says we
are all meaningless dead ducks,
which may explain why
"Jodorowsky appears fatigued and
bored by the project" in one

critic's preview. If I had his
optimism about the nature and
end of human life, I too would be
fatigued and more than bored.
Alexandro Jodorowsky's The
Holy Mountain combines
elements of BV2, Satyricon, A
Clockwork Orange, and The
Exorcist to be the kinkiest movie
yet.
Nudity, gore, bizarre behavior,
the occult, mass castrations and
even human excrement are its
stock in trade. As was evidenced
in Jodorowski's earlier film, El
Topo, his purpose in using film is
not to entertain, transform,
educate, enlighten or inspire. His
interest is in the exploration of
realms the commercial medium
has not yet covered.
Although The Holy Mountain
is often obscene, it is not
pornographic; nowhere is the
purpose of its obscenity the
titillation of the prurient.
Rather, the destruction of
myths upon which modern
culture is based seems to be
Jodorowsky's aim. He is actually
saying, "You have already
destroyed all your myths; I am
merely pointing out how empty
and meaningless they have
become. No blasphemy offends
you any longer. See?"
After a slow rambling start

which seems to take up where El
Topo left off, an ever-so-slight
story line is developed in which
the protagonist becomes one of
eight searchers for the holy
mountain, the common
denominator of all myths offering
a paradise of eternal life. The hero
is a Christ figure in the most
superficial sense—he is dressed in a
loincloth and bearded, and in one
scene he is placed on a
crucifix—but he never forgives
anyone's sins or heals their
infirmities.
Together with representatives
of seven other planets, the Christ
figure follows a seer (played by
Jodorowsky) who has mastered all
the world religions to find the
holy mountain.
The substance of the film is the
ritual by which each planetary
representative Introduces himself.
Each symbolizes some form of
modern decadence; the
earth-Christ figure himself
represents the quest for gold,
which the seer demonstrates can
be manufactured from his own
defecation. Others are into war,
exploitation of children, and
varieties of sexual debauchery and
mystical experience.

When all eight members of the
party have shown their
weaknesses or sins, they join
together under the unidentified
but clearly satanic seer on their
quest for the mountain. There are
endless complications en route,
but they finally gather at a
picnic-like table at what is
