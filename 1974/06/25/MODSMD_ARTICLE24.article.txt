# Golfers Just Miss Cut At NCAA Championships
## 
### 
For the second straight year,
everything broke the wrong way
for Stanford at the NCAA golf
tournament, held at the Carleton
Oaks Country Club in Santee,
California , last week.
The Cardinals missed the cut
by two strokes — shooting a 601
in a tourney where it took 599 to
survive. The defending Pac-8
champs did place two players into
the finals, Aly Trompas and Dave
Baskins, but neither played
particularly well. "Tromp" shot
72-76-76-74—298 while Baskins
hit 74-73-73-77-297.
Baskins finished about 30th in
the tournament, according to
coach Bud Finger, with Trompas
35th. Baskins could have done
better — much better — had he
not played strange golf on the
back nine of the final round. He
doublebogied 10, birdied 11 and
12, double-bogied 14 and
triple-bogied 15.
Stanford's other players failed
to survive the individual cut and

played poorly. Glenn Goethals,
the only freshman in the lineup,
started with a triple-bogey on the
very first hole and never
recovered, shooting 79-74 for a
153. Conrad Nilmeier marked the
same total by hitting 77 and 76.
George Pettinger played poorly,
shooting 77-76—156.
Wake Forest won the team title
by two shots over defending
champion Florida. A Wake Forest
freshman, Chris Strange, hit an
eagle on the final hole of the
tourney to not only win the team
crown but also capture the
individual title with a
six-under-par 282.
While the men's golf

tournament was going on in the
San Diego area, so was the
women's, played at El Cajon.
Stanford's two-woman entry of
Pat Cornet and Libby Docker
played well, according to coach
Carroll Diaz.
Cornet was eighth in the 'B'
division with a four round total of
333, including a superb final
round of 77. Docker, who just
recently started playing after a
three-year layoff, scored a 374.
Mary Budke of Oregon State
won the individual title, with U.
of Miami taking the four-player
championship and San Diego
State the two-player event.
