# Stanford Retains NCAA Tennis Title
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
LOS ANGELES—"It sure makes the rest of the
country look bad," murmered one old-timer after
Stanford's varsity tennis team, against all odds, won
its second straight NCAA championship here
Friday.
Two days earlier, it didn't look like the Cards
had a chance. Star junior Jim Delaney had been
upset in the round of 64, capping a nightmarish
month for coach Dick Gould, who had lost his
superstar, Sandy Mayer, to a fit of temper and
another fine player, Pat DuPre, to tendonitis in his
wrist.
The next two days were a dream.
Johnny Whitlinger and Chico Hagey, two players
not as well known as the above triad, fought their
way to the finals with a series of brilliant wins, and
in the process, won the title for Stanford.
Saturday, Whit won the singles championship
over his teammate, teamed with Delaney to win the
doubles title, and headed off to Wimbledon.
But that 1-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win over Hagey was
only gravy. The real work had taken place in the
days before.
Great Play
Hagey, a well-liked 6-3 junior who won
All-American status as a freshman but hadn't
played much championship tennis since breaking
his leg at Forest Hills in 1972, advanced round by
round without losing a set.
In the round of 32, Chico met Alabama's Mike
Cahill, seventh seed in the tourney, held at USC's
David X. Marks Tennis Stadium. The unseeded
Hagey proceeded to play perfect tennis in
demolishing Cahill 6-3, 6-2.
Two rounds later, Chico met second-seeded
Michigan's Victor Amaya, a huge (6-5, 214 pounds)
lefty with a serve regarded as the best in collegiate
tennis.
Tiebreak Wins
For two sets, Hagey and Amaya played the pro
game, aceing each other regularly and winning
every serve. The match boiled down to two
tiebreakers.
And when the pressure was on, Hagey proved he
was the best of the power players, crushing Amaya
5-1 in each tiebreaker by hitting wicked returns of
service to win 7-6, 7-6.
The next round, in the three-out-of-five-sets
semis, Chico met Oklahoma City's Steve
Wedderburn, a floppy-hatted Australian with a big
serve and forehand.
It wasn't evey close. Hagey won 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 as
Wedderburn mumbled colorful Australian oaths.

Hagey aced him 13 times.
Whit Wins
As Hagey rolled up the points, winning 16
straight sets, so did Whitlinger.
The sophomore from Neenah, Wisconsin, was
seeded fifth and, despite later modesty, came into
the tournament thinking he was the best player
there.
For awhile, Whit's confidence in himself looked
premature. He gave his fans a scare when he barely
beat two unseeded players, Alabama's Chip Wade
and Pepperdine's Joao Soares, escaping match point
against the latter.
But in the last three rounds, the little (5-8) guy
played like a future Ken Rosewall. In the quarters,
he faced SMU's George Hardie, who in April beat
both Mayer and UCLA's Brian Teacher. (Teacher
was first seeded, but lost in the round of 16 to
Terry Moor of N.E. Louisiana).
Whit's two-handed backhand return of service
and aggressive net game overwhelmed Hardie, who
just wasn't fast enough, 6-2, 6-4.
Big Match
That win earned Whitlinger the right to meet
USC's Sashi Menon in the semis. Menon, an Indian
Davis Cupper, was playing superbly, and had KO'd
both Stanford's Nick Saviano (7-5, 5-7, 6-2) and
Moor (6-1, 6-4).
Whit started quickly, smashing backhands and
winning the first two sets, 6-3 and 7-5. In the third
set, the canny Menon aimed for Whit's weaker
forehand, and, cheered on by the fans, won 6-1.
In the fourth set, both players broke once to tie
at 5-5. Then Whit took over, breaking Menon's
serve with devastating returns and winning his own
serve to clinch his win and Stanford's
championship.
Saturday came the championship match. With
Gould staying studiously neutral, Hagey started
strong, killing Whit with his serve. After one set,
the superstitious Whitlinger changed into his blue
shirt, "because blue is my lucky color."
Hagey had another explanation for what was to
come. "I just lost my serve," he said.
Whatever the reason, Whit completely took over,
repeatedly breaking Hagey's serve and winning his
own, hitting superb passing shots to which Hagey,
at the net, could not respond. The final score was
1-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1.
But the real story was the team play of
Stanford, which won with 30 points, compared to
USC's 26, and Michigan's 19 at the end of the
tournament, which was well run by USC during a
hot, but relatively smogless, week.

both Mayer and UCLA's Brian Teacher. (Teacher
was first seeded, but lost in the round of 16 to
Terry Moor of N.E. Louisiana).
Whit's two-handed backhand return of service
and aggressive net game overwhelmed Hardie, who
just wasn't fast enough, 6-2, 6-4.
Big Match
That win earned Whitlinger the right to meet
USC's Sashi Menon in the semis. Menon, an Indian
Davis Cupper, was playing superbly, and had KO'd
both Stanford's Nick Saviano (7-5, 5-7, 6-2) and
Moor (6-1, 6-4).
Whit started quickly, smashing backhands and
winning the first two sets, 6-3 and 7-5. In the third
set, the canny Menon aimed for Whit's weaker
forehand, and, cheered on by the fans, won 6-1.
In the fourth set, both players broke once to tie
at 5-5. Then Whit took over, breaking Menon's
serve with devastating returns and winning his own
serve to clinch his win and Stanford's
championship.
Saturday came the championship match. With
Gould staying studiously neutral, Hagey started
strong, killing Whit with his serve. After one set,
the superstitious Whitlinger changed into his blue
shirt, "because blue is my lucky color."
Hagey had another explanation for what was to
come. "I just lost my serve," he said.
Whatever the reason, Whit completely took over,
repeatedly breaking Hagey's serve and winning his
own, hitting superb passing shots to which Hagey,
at the net, could not respond. The final score was
1-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1.
But the real story was the team play of
Stanford, which won with 30 points, compared to
USC's 26, and Michigan's 19 at the end of the
tournament, which was well run by USC during a
hot, but relatively smogless, week.

BIG SURPRlSE—Unseeded Chico Hagey, a junior, reached the finals
of last week's NCAA tennis tournament in Los Angeles. Hagey played
superbly, and, according to Stanford coach Dick Gould "won the
tournament for us."
LOS ANGELES—"It sure makes the rest of the
country look bad," murmered one old-timer after
Stanford's varsity tennis team, against all odds, won
its second straight NCAA championship here
Friday.
Two days earlier, it didn't look like the Cards
had a chance. Star junior Jim Delaney had been
upset in the round of 64, capping a nightmarish
month for coach Dick Gould, who had lost his
superstar, Sandy Mayer, to a fit of temper and
another fine player, Pat DuPre, to tendonitis in his
wrist.
The next two days were a dream.
Johnny Whitlinger and Chico Hagey, two players
not as well known as the above triad, fought their
way to the finals with a series of brilliant wins, and
in the process, won the title for Stanford.
Saturday, Whit won the singles championship
over his teammate, teamed with Delaney to win the
doubles title, and headed off to Wimbledon.
But that 1-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win over Hagey was
only gravy. The real work had taken place in the
days before.
Great Play
Hagey, a well-liked 6-3 junior who won
All-American status as a freshman but hadn't
played much championship tennis since breaking
his leg at Forest Hills in 1972, advanced round by
round without losing a set.
In the round of 32, Chico met Alabama's Mike
Cahill, seventh seed in the tourney, held at USC's
David X. Marks Tennis Stadium. The unseeded
Hagey proceeded to play perfect tennis in
demolishing Cahill 6-3, 6-2.
Two rounds later, Chico met second-seeded
Michigan's Victor Amaya, a huge (6-5, 214 pounds)
lefty with a serve regarded as the best in collegiate
tennis.
Tiebreak Wins
For two sets, Hagey and Amaya played the pro
game, aceing each other regularly and winning
every serve. The match boiled down to two
tiebreakers.
And when the pressure was on, Hagey proved he
was the best of the power players, crushing Amaya
5-1 in each tiebreaker by hitting wicked returns of
service to win 7-6, 7-6.
The next round, in the three-out-of-five-sets
semis, Chico met Oklahoma City's Steve
Wedderburn, a floppy-hatted Australian with a big
serve and forehand.
It wasn't evey close. Hagey won 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 as
Wedderburn mumbled colorful Australian oaths.

Hagey aced him 13 times.
Whit Wins
As Hagey rolled up the points, winning 16
straight sets, so did Whitlinger.
The sophomore from Neenah, Wisconsin, was
seeded fifth and, despite later modesty, came into
the tournament thinking he was the best player
there.
For awhile, Whit's confidence in himself looked
premature. He gave his fans a scare when he barely
beat two unseeded players, Alabama's Chip Wade
and Pepperdine's Joao Soares, escaping match point
against the latter.
But in the last three rounds, the little (5-8) guy
played like a future Ken Rosewall. In the quarters,
he faced SMU's George Hardie, who in April beat
both Mayer and UCLA's Brian Teacher. (Teacher
was first seeded, but lost in the round of 16 to
Terry Moor of N.E. Louisiana).
Whit's two-handed backhand return of service

over his teammate, teamed with Delaney to win the
doubles title, and headed off to Wimbledon.
But that 1-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win over Hagey was
only gravy. The real work had taken place in the
days before.
Great Play
Hagey, a well-liked 6-3 junior who won
All-American status as a freshman but hadn't
played much championship tennis since breaking
his leg at Forest Hills in 1972, advanced round by
round without losing a set.
In the round of 32, Chico met Alabama's Mike
Cahill, seventh seed in the tourney, held at USC's
David X. Marks Tennis Stadium. The unseeded
Hagey proceeded to play perfect tennis in
demolishing Cahill 6-3, 6-2.
Two rounds later, Chico met second-seeded
Michigan's Victor Amaya, a huge (6-5, 214 pounds)
lefty with a serve regarded as the best in collegiate
tennis.
Tiebreak Wins
For two sets, Hagey and Amaya played the pro
game, aceing each other regularly and winning
every serve. The match boiled down to two
tiebreakers.
And when the pressure was on, Hagey proved he
was the best of the power players, crushing Amaya
5-1 in each tiebreaker by hitting wicked returns of
service to win 7-6, 7-6.
The next round, in the three-out-of-five-sets
semis, Chico met Oklahoma City's Steve
Wedderburn, a floppy-hatted Australian with a big
serve and forehand.
It wasn't evey close. Hagey won 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 as
Wedderburn mumbled colorful Australian oaths.

Hagey aced him 13 times.
Whit Wins
As Hagey rolled up the points, winning 16
straight sets, so did Whitlinger.
The sophomore from Neenah, Wisconsin, was
seeded fifth and, despite later modesty, came into
the tournament thinking he was the best player
there.
For awhile, Whit's confidence in himself looked
premature. He gave his fans a scare when he barely
beat two unseeded players, Alabama's Chip Wade
and Pepperdine's Joao Soares, escaping match point
against the latter.
But in the last three rounds, the little (5-8) guy
played like a future Ken Rosewall. In the quarters,
he faced SMU's George Hardie, who in April beat
both Mayer and UCLA's Brian Teacher. (Teacher
was first seeded, but lost in the round of 16 to
Terry Moor of N.E. Louisiana).
Whit's two-handed backhand return of service
and aggressive net game overwhelmed Hardie, who
just wasn't fast enough, 6-2, 6-4.
Big Match
That win earned Whitlinger the right to meet
USC's Sashi Menon in the semis. Menon, an Indian
Davis Cupper, was playing superbly, and had KO'd
both Stanford's Nick Saviano (7-5, 5-7, 6-2) and
Moor (6-1, 6-4).
Whit started quickly, smashing backhands and
winning the first two sets, 6-3 and 7-5. In the third
set, the canny Menon aimed for Whit's weaker
forehand, and, cheered on by the fans, won 6-1.
In the fourth set, both players broke once to tie
at 5-5. Then Whit took over, breaking Menon's
serve with devastating returns and winning his own
serve to clinch his win and Stanford's
championship.
Saturday came the championship match. With
Gould staying studiously neutral, Hagey started
strong, killing Whit with his serve. After one set,
the superstitious Whitlinger changed into his blue
shirt, "because blue is my lucky color."
Hagey had another explanation for what was to
come. "I just lost my serve," he said.
Whatever the reason, Whit completely took over,
repeatedly breaking Hagey's serve and winning his
own, hitting superb passing shots to which Hagey,
at the net, could not respond. The final score was
1-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1.
But the real story was the team play of
Stanford, which won with 30 points, compared to
USC's 26, and Michigan's 19 at the end of the
tournament, which was well run by USC during a
hot, but relatively smogless, week.

BIG SURPRlSE—Unseeded Chico Hagey, a junior, reached the finals
of last week's NCAA tennis tournament in Los Angeles. Hagey played
superbly, and, according to Stanford coach Dick Gould "won the
tournament for us."
LOS ANGELES—"It sure makes the rest of the
country look bad," murmered one old-timer after
Stanford's varsity tennis team, against all odds, won
its second straight NCAA championship here
Friday.
Two days earlier, it didn't look like the Cards
had a chance. Star junior Jim Delaney had been
upset in the round of 64, capping a nightmarish
month for coach Dick Gould, who had lost his
superstar, Sandy Mayer, to a fit of temper and
another fine player, Pat DuPre, to tendonitis in his
wrist.
The next two days were a dream.
Johnny Whitlinger and Chico Hagey, two players
not as well known as the above triad, fought their
way to the finals with a series of brilliant wins, and
in the process, won the title for Stanford.
Saturday, Whit won the singles championship
