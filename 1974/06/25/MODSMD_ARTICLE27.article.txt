Kissinger Denies Secret Deal
WASHINGTON—Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
yesterday denied allegations that he negotiated a secret
agreement with the Soviet Union which would allow the
Soviets more nuclear missiles than announced in the 1972
summit agreement, but he admitted the existence of a
secret loophole.
According to Kissinger, the reports "have no merit
whatsoever." Kissinger made the remarks in a news
conference preceding testimony before a closed-door
meeting of the Senate Arms Control subcommittee. After
the committee meeting, the Secretary's principal accuser,
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) apparently indicated that
he accepted Kissinger's explanation.
Jackson has said he has a pair of classified documents
proving Kissinger concealed a secret understanding, which
would allow Moscow to build more than the 950
sub marine-based missiles allowed under the SALT I
agreement.
The Senator had also alleged that the "understanding"
may have pledged that the U.S. would maintain a
submarine force of less than the 710 missiles allowed by
the pact, signed May 27,1972.
Later, congressional sources said that Kissinger
acknowledged the existence of a loophole in the
agreement, which the U.S. was unable to close until
recently. But the Secretary said this loophole was entirely
unintentional.
In his press conference, Kissinger said the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. may reach an "agreement in principle" on an
underground test ban during the President's trip to
Moscow, which begins Thursday.
'Nixon Convinced Of CIA Role'
WASHINGTON—A private investigator said yesterday
Charles Colson told him that he and President Nixon are
convinced the Central Intelligence Agency knew of the
Watergate break-in in advance and also helped plan the
break-in at Daniel Ellsburg's psychiatrist's office.
Richard L. Bast said Colson, a former special counsel to
the President, told him "Nixon is convinced the CIA is in
this up to their eyeballs." Bast's account was published in

yesterday's Washington Star-News.
Bast said Nixon "was out of his mind over the CIA and
Pentagon roles in Watergate," last January, and told
Colson he wanted to fire CIA director William E. Colby
immediately.
However, according to Bast, semi-retired head of a
Washington securities firm, White House chief of staff
Alexander Haig persuaded Nixon "not to take down the
whole intelligence establishment of the United States in
order to save yourself from impeachment."
Colson saw "a total conspiracy by not only the CIA,
but the Pentagon as well, to take over the Presidency by
being able to exercise under influence," Bast said. Colson
was not immediately available for comment.
Colson is set to begin a prison term on July 8, after
pleading guilty to charges of obstruction of justice last
Friday.
Seven Killed During Arab Attack
NAHARIYA, Israel—Seven persons are reported dead and
five injured as a result of an Arab guerrilla attack on an
Israeli resort town near the border with Lebanon early this
morning.
The Israeli military command reported that a
29-year-old woman and her two children are among the
dead. According to reports, three guerrillas entered
Nahariya from the Mediterranean Sea and barricaded
themselves inside a three-story building.
The terrorists fought a two-and-a-half hour gun battle
with Israeli army units before being killed. One Israeli
soldier was killed and five other persons injured during the
assault.
British Nuclear Test Revealed
LONDON—Prime Minister Harold Wilson admitted
yesterday that Great Britain conducted an underground
nuclear test in Nevada several weeks ago, its first in nine
years.
Wilson told the House of Commons that the test was
"necessary to maintain the effectiveness of the nuclear
deterrent." He indicated that no further tests were
scheduled.

The Prime Minister, head of the Labor Party, has come
under criticism from members of his party who denounce
nuclear tests generally and criticize Britain's maintenance
of its own nuclear strike force.
According to some left-wing members of the party, any
nuclear testing by the country goes against official party
policy adopted last year, before Wilson came into power.
Wilson said that arrangements for the test were made
by the former Conservative government of Edward Heath,
which was defeated at the polls four months ago.
"The experiment was conducted fully within the
framework of the provisions of the partial Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty of 1963 and the Non-Proliferation Treaty of
1968," Wilson said. "It was equally in accordance with the
policy of the Labor Party."
Court Upholds Felon Vote Bar
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court yesterday ruled that
it is constitutional for convicted felons to be barred, even
after release, from voting in state and local elections.
In a companion opinion, the court also ruled that
prisoners have no rights to demand interviews with
newsmen, and that reporters cannot demand interviews
with prisoners.
In a five-to-four vote, the high court said that
regulation of such interviews was a proper means of
maintaining a violation of first amendment
rights.
The court also handed down two rulings dealing with
the obscenity issues. It unanimously overturned a
conviction of an Albany, Georgia theater owner for
showing the film "Carnal Knowledge." Justice William
Rehnquist wrote, in effect, that the jury was
forced to apply statewide, rather than local, standards.
However, not all justices went along with this reasoning,
leaving the definition of "community standards" as
muddled as before.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow, with patchy morning low
clouds. Highs 70-75, lows 52-56. Afternoon winds from
the northwest, 10-20 miles per hour.
