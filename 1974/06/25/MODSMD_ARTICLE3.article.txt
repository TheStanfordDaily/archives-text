# Trustees Approve Emeriti Housing
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Board of Trustees has approved
construction of a slightly scaled-down version of
the controversial faculty, staff and emeriti housing
development on the Row.
Students voted overwhelmingly in February to
oppose the proposed construction and the decision
whether to review the project or to continue as
planned fell to President Richard Lyman.
Lyman commissioned Faculty-Staff Housing
Director Robert Summers and Executive Assistant
to the Provost Edward Shaw to re-examine the
proposal site and its desirability among faculty
members. Based on recommendations from Shaw
and Summers, Lyman decided after a meeting on
June 11 to approve the project.
The new development will be an 82-unit
condiminium housing project rather than a
100-unit apartment complex as previously planned.
Both trustees and students had voiced concern that
the original density of the proposed units was too
great.
The project will also only rise two stories instead
of three as first conceived and it is expected to cost
about $3.9 million.

Other modifications such as redesigned common
facilities the addition of shingles and revisions on
windows and exterior treatment were made, Shaw
said.
Some of these revisions were made to secure
approval from the University Committee on Land
and Buildings which rejected the original
architectural plans in May, he added. The
committee approved modified plans June 5.
Construction will probably start this October
and the condominiums should be open for faculty
in the fall of 1975, Summers said.
The project will occupy the sites of the old
Stanford Elementary School on Mayfield Avenue
and Hurlburt-Grove house.
Hurlburt will be relocated a block and a half east
on Mayfield. The music department and child care
facilities housed in the elementary school will be
moved to modular buildings adjoining the Knoll
and the credit union respectively, according to
Shaw.
The primary aim of the project is to "free
on-campus houses for younger faculty with
children." he stated.
Shaw explained that many
older and retired faculty have no
need for the large houses they
presently lease from the
University, but wish to live on
campus. The new condominiums
are expected to free
approximately 50 houses.
The survey Shaw and Summers
compiled showed a market for
182 households, but was not
conclusive on the location,
Summers said.
Shaw said they settled on the
student-opposed Row site because
"every other site had a higher
demand [for another project]
than"the emeriti housing project."
Student reaction to the revised
architectural plans, which were
made public during spring quarter
finals week, was not especially
favorable, Shaw said.
"There are some redeeming
factors," commented former
ASSU Vice President Jim Friend,
an opponent of the Row location.
"At least it's not that high. But
the nature of the building is the
same as before. It's identical,
except lower."

Students, especially Row
residents, had complained that the
architecture of the project was
"incompatible" with the character
of the student housing on the
Row.
Shaw termed the redesigning
"passable," adding that both the
University's and potential
residents' financial limitations
prevented greater embellishment.

about $3.9 million.

Other modifications such as redesigned common
facilities the addition of shingles and revisions on
windows and exterior treatment were made, Shaw
said.
Some of these revisions were made to secure
approval from the University Committee on Land
and Buildings which rejected the original
architectural plans in May, he added. The
committee approved modified plans June 5.
Construction will probably start this October
and the condominiums should be open for faculty
in the fall of 1975, Summers said.
The project will occupy the sites of the old
Stanford Elementary School on Mayfield Avenue
and Hurlburt-Grove house.
Hurlburt will be relocated a block and a half east
on Mayfield. The music department and child care
facilities housed in the elementary school will be
moved to modular buildings adjoining the Knoll
and the credit union respectively, according to
Shaw.
The primary aim of the project is to "free
on-campus houses for younger faculty with
children." he stated.
Shaw explained that many
older and retired faculty have no
need for the large houses they
presently lease from the
University, but wish to live on
campus. The new condominiums
are expected to free
approximately 50 houses.
The survey Shaw and Summers
compiled showed a market for
182 households, but was not
conclusive on the location,
Summers said.
Shaw said they settled on the
student-opposed Row site because
"every other site had a higher
demand [for another project]
than"the emeriti housing project."
Student reaction to the revised
architectural plans, which were
made public during spring quarter
finals week, was not especially
favorable, Shaw said.
"There are some redeeming
factors," commented former
ASSU Vice President Jim Friend,
an opponent of the Row location.
"At least it's not that high. But
the nature of the building is the
same as before. It's identical,
except lower."

Students, especially Row
residents, had complained that the
architecture of the project was
"incompatible" with the character
of the student housing on the
Row.
Shaw termed the redesigning
"passable," adding that both the
University's and potential
residents' financial limitations
prevented greater embellishment.
The Board of Trustees has approved
construction of a slightly scaled-down version of
the controversial faculty, staff and emeriti housing
development on the Row.
Students voted overwhelmingly in February to
oppose the proposed construction and the decision
whether to review the project or to continue as
planned fell to President Richard Lyman.
Lyman commissioned Faculty-Staff Housing
Director Robert Summers and Executive Assistant
to the Provost Edward Shaw to re-examine the
proposal site and its desirability among faculty
members. Based on recommendations from Shaw
and Summers, Lyman decided after a meeting on
June 11 to approve the project.
The new development will be an 82-unit
condiminium housing project rather than a
100-unit apartment complex as previously planned.
Both trustees and students had voiced concern that
the original density of the proposed units was too
great.
The project will also only rise two stories instead
of three as first conceived and it is expected to cost
about $3.9 million.
