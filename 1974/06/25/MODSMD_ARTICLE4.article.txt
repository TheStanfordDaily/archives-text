# USE, University Ratify Three-Year Contract
## 
### DON COX 
Seven months of prolonged
negotiations culminated yesterday
in the signing of an initial
three-year contract between the
University and the United
Stanford Employees (USE) union.
"It is a good first agreement,"
said University negotiator Douglas
Barton. "We had a lot of basic
groundwork to lay and I think in
terms of the issues . there has
been a good effort to find a means
of accomodation."
USE president Jim Berk said
that he was "satisfied that we got
the best we could get."
The settlement represents
about a 26 percent of $4 million
increase in the bargaining unit's
wage and benefit base over the
three years from Sept. 1973
through August 1976.
The 1400 technical,
maintenance and service workers
covered by the contract will
receive a 7 percent wage increase

the first year, retroactive to Sept.
1, 1973.
Workers in selected
classifications will receive
additional increases of 2.5 to 15
percent retroactive to Sept. 1973
to adjust wages with respect to
the general job market. Workers
will also receive an additional
holiday, and designated
departments will receive shift
premium increases. "It is a fairly
decent contract," said Vice
President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger. "We
all feel we can use more, but with
the financial constraints on the
University, it is an adequate
compensation settlement."
Augsburger said that the wage
increases would have little impact
on tuition since most unit workers
are paid through outside contract
funds. The settlement might have
some impact on room and board
rates in a year, however.
The first year wage and benefit

increases represent a 10 percent
increase in the unit's wage and
benefit base. The union's original
demands called for a 23 percent
increase the first year.
The second year will bring a 6
percent across-the-board wage
increases for workers. Some
workers will receive additional
increases as the University
switches a majority of the unit
from a six-step wage range system
to a three-step system.
Workers will receive a 5
percent increase during the third
year. A cost of living escalator
could provide up to an additional
3 percent.
The University will help pay
for increased medical coverage
and will make an acre of land
available to employees who wish
to have vegetable gardens.
Unit members who were USE
members before the contract was
signed and any workers hired after
the signing are required to be
union members as a condition of
employment. Unit members not
USE members before the contract
signing will be required to pay
union dues though they will not
have to join the union.
The University had initially
opposed a modified union-agency
shop of this nature since they felt
it presented employees with a
financial burden that they had not
anticipated when they were
initially hired.
Barton said, however, the
union arguments for the shop
"openly persuaded" the
University. "We changed our
minds on some issues and so did
the union," he said.
The contract provides for a
grievance and arbitration
procedure to settle any grievance
of a worker. A joint standing
committee with equal
representation from management
and the union will review
grievances before resorting to
binding arbitration.
The agreement includes a
number of clauses protecting
workers' rights including a
provision guarding against
University administered polygraph
tests.
"We did feel and do feel these
were unnecessary and that they
indicate an element of distrust,"
said Barton. "If we were farther
down the road where we would
like to be (with regard to
University-union relations), these
issues wouldn't need to be
discussed."
Augsburger said after the
signing of the contract that he
"hoped wo can now proceed to
build a less adversary and more
cooperative relationship."
