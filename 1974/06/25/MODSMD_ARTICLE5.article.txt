# So What, Ehrlich?

Dear Dr. Ehrlich,
Having read the article
"Misconceptions" by you and
your wife in the June 16th issue
of the New York Times Magazine,
all I can say is "So what." This
reaction does not arise from
callousness.
It is instead the only way that 1
can psychically cope with the
question, "What can be done
about the population problem?"
â€” a question that, as you have so
amply demonstrated, has only one
answer: nothing. You yourself are
the first to point out that any
reasonable attempt at a solution is
highly unlikely to occur.
Virtually every statement that
I've heard you make and every
word you've written that I've seen
in print have struck a genuine fear
in me of the catastrophe that you
logically predict. Even your jokes
arouse an uncomfortable laughter
that barely hides the real reaction.
Yet am I to pursue my life
continually urinating, defecating,
squealing and running about like
any terrified laboratory rat?
Personal experience tells me that
such behavior tends to retard
social miscibility.
Ehrlich's Course
In the spring of 1973, I became
a graduate of Stanford University.
During winter quarter, 1970, I
was enrolled in a class called
Biology and Social Responsibility,
taught by you and Dr. Holm,
whose first name I have totally
forgotten. After the course ended,
I kept my mind and body
chemically altered for several
months. Later I became a hermit.
It wasn't until half a year after
taking the doom-inspired final
examination for that course that I
was able to reenter the human
race as a sane, harmless individual.
I received an A from you in that
course. It is the only grade in my
entire academic career that I am
embarrassed about.
The point is that you have
convinced me, Dr. Ehrlich, many
times over, that there is nothing I
can do about the inevitable
catastrophe, because there is
nothing anyone can do, even if he
tried.
What Can One Do?
I have a dog. What am I
supposed to do each time he
comes to me expecting his daily

meal? Feed him to some starving
children? By doing so I merely
increase the chances of the
anguished deaths of their future
offspring, right?
About a year ago I fell in love
with a woman who told me in a
tender moment that of all the
men she has known, she would
prefer me to be the father of the
child she hopes to have. What the
hell am I supposed to say to her?
Quoting you hardly seems
romantic, yet it is the most logical
thing to do. Whenever I am with
her, I must suppress everything of
yours that I have ever heard or
read (a feat which I have trained
myself to do quite effectively) or
else face paralyzing anxiety.
That is the essence behind the
reaction "so what": the psychic
suppression of every word you've
said or written, of everything you
stand for, because it is so totally
hopeless.
Terrifying Thoughts
I am in a position to utter
those two glib words, but you
must live with your terrifying
thoughts every day, even if you
don't always witness the
consequences, the world-wide
beginnings that will soon become
the end. I sometimes wonder, not
in any rhetorical sense but with
only the most innocent, childlike
curiosity: What keeps you going?
In the meantime, the woman I
mentioned is now living with
another man in Ithaca, New York.
The situation with her seems
equally as hopeless as the state of
the world, but I would much
rather spend my time worrying
about her because in her case I
can more easily delude myself
into believing that there is some
hope.
This is only because there is no
one as eloquent as you to point
out to me the situation between
her and the other man. In the case
of the world, however, you have
certainly alarmed those who have
heard of you, but you have
convinced beyond all reasonable
doubt those of us who have been
willing to read and hear your
words objectively, that there is no
hope, no chance, nothing at all
that anyone can do except keep
him- or herself temporarily alive
by saying "So what."
