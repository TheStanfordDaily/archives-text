# Nixon Ignores Soviet Jews

The Soviet government's rounding up of Jewish
citizens prior to President Nixon's visit represents
still another act of oppression perpetrated against
Soviet Jews, who only ask the right to practice
their religion or the right to leave.
It was reported last weekend that about 40 Jews
were being held in six Soviet cities in a drive to
prevent,protests during Nixon's visit. Sources also
said that other Jews had gone into hiding or had
been summoned by authorities and warned of
possible criminal prosecution.
The latest wave of arrests, predicted by Jewish
activists, were said to be worse than those before
Nixon's 1972 trip to the Soviet Union. Other
evidence of oppression was seen during the World
University Games last summer in the Soviet Union.
Fans who came to cheer for the Israeli team were
either not allowed admission or harrassed by the
security police.
Occurences such as these continue to happen in
the Soviet Union, yet President Nixon will do little
to attempt to alleviate the situation. At a recent
commencement speech at the U.S. Naval Academy,
Nixon reiterated his stance that emigration was an
internal Soviet affair.
But shouldn't the United States demand the
humanitarian treatment of a country's citizens as a
prerequisite to participating in a trade agreement
with the country?
That is what 319 members of the House of
Representatives believe. Last December, the House,

by a 319-80 margin, adopted an amendement to
the Trade Reform Act of 1973 that denies lower
tariffs or export credits to the Soviet Union unless
the President can certify that Russia does not
restrict emigration by high taxes or other obstacles.
The amendment was proposed by Rep. Charles
A. Vanik, Dâ€” Ohio, who said its aim was to force
the Soviets to grant their citizens the basic human
right of free emigration. "Passage of this bill will be
a reminder to the world that this country is still the
hope of free men everywhere," Vanik said at the
time.
The Nixon administration voiced strong
opposition to Vanik's amendment, threatening to
veto the entire bill, which he favored for the most
part, if the anti-Soviet measures remained.
Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev will undoubtably
have trade high on their agenda when they begin
discussions later this week. But whatever agreement
is made between the two most powerful men in the
world will have to be approved by Congress, which
could prove to be a headache for Nixon.
The President could easily solve this problem by
putting pressure on the Soviet leaders during their
negotiations. It is widely assumed that pressure
from American public opinion and from Congress
and the entire American government has been
responsible for the thousands of Jews who have
been granted emigration permits.
