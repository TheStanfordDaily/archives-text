Defends Flicks
Editor:
I agree with Brad Fisher that
"unannounced presentations
amount to little more than the
exploitation of a virtually captive
audience." In Mr. Fisher's June 5
letter to the Daily editor, entitled
"Against Flicks Forum," he
objected to "the policy of using
the Sunday Flicks as a forum for
local social and political causes."
There has never been any such
policy. Statements in support of
USE's position were made at the
Flicks on May 12, 19, 26 and
June 2 only as part of a special
agreement between the Flicks and
USE which permitted the Flicks
to operate during the strike.

Shortly before the strike
began, USE representatives
approached me and proposed that
either a USE statement precede
each screening and that the Flicks
pay approximately $65.00 to the
USE Hardship Fund for each
evening the Flicks operated during
the strike when a USE
projectionist was used, or the
Flicks would be shut down. Since
no non-striking personnel at
Stanford were qualified to operate
Mem Aud's 35 mm projectors,
there was little choice but to go
along with the Union's offer.
Several times between May 12
and June 2 I publicly stated that
the Flicks' position on the strike
was neutrality, and that during
the strike the Flicks would try to

honor its commitments to season
pass holders, readers of our
advertising, and film distributors.
I do want to thank again Bob
Bates and Roger Hardy, the USE
projectionists who accepted no
pay for operating the projectors
at the Flicks during the strike.
Mr. Fisher's second point was
that the Columbae-edited short
feature, The Post War War, at
State of Siege was unannounced. 1
suggest he refer to our ads in the
May 23 or 24 Daily, or to any one
of the roughly 23,000 Flicks
calendars distributed spring
quarter at Stanford.
