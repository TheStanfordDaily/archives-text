STRIKER PLEADS NOT GUILTY
Paul Galle, charged with trespassing and violating a court order
in last month's United Stanford Employees (USE) union strike,
pleaded not guilty, in Palo Alto Municipal Court Tuesday.
Galle had climbed 160 feet up a rigger's boom with a strike
sign and then tied himself to the boom. His vigil lasted almost
2-1/2 hours, when a rig operator lowered the boom and delivered
Galle to the Palo Alto police.
Galle's case is set for disposition on July 25 by Judge Edward
Scoyen.
