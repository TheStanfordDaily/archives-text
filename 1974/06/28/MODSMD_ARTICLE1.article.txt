# Carpenter Strike Slows Construction

"Strikes, weather, the poor old
law school project has had about
everything happen to it,"
lamented Planning Office Mariager
for Construction and Engineering
John Lerry as new labor strikes
threatened to bring work on the
project to a total standstill.
Carpenters stopped working on
the $12 million law school
complex June 19 because of the
state-wide carpenter's union
strike. Rumors indicated that
members of the laborers union
would leave the job today or
soon, effectively shutting down
the project.
"The progress of the job is
slowed down almost to a stop
now," said Norman Thorsell,
construction supervisor for Carl
Olson & Sons Construction Co.,
the contractor for the complex.
Even with the laborers on the job,
"we can't continue effectively
much longer without the
carpenters."
Besides the law school project,
work on the Stanford Hospital
addition is similarly threatened.
"Our anticipation is that
probably by Monday, work will
be shut down on these two major
jobs," said Lerry.
Occupation Delayed
When construction began on
the law school complex in August
1972, Sept. 1974 had been set as
the original occupation date.
Since then recurring periods of
bad weather and labor strikes have
fofced a nine month delay in the
completion of the complex. Lerry
said August 1975 is presently the
anticipated date for occupation.
'The Law School deans aren't
happy and I'm not happy but
we're still holding our breaths that
we can still make this latest date"

in spite of any new strike, he said.
"The general sense is that this
won't be as long a strike as people
thought. It is a foregone
conclusion that if people's feelings
can be calmed down, they can
come to an agreement."
Lerry explained that short
strikes and delays can be abosrbed
by a time cushion that exists
between the date of completion
and occupation. Since the

complex must be occupied at the
beginning of an academic quarter,
if completion is not possible by
this date the occupation date is
bumped back a whole quarter.
Impact On Hospital
Occupation dates at the
hospital construction site are not
contigent on any academic
calender. "There we're not talking
about quarters or semesters and
any kind of delay has an impact

on the hospital," Lerry said. The
hospital site to date has been
relatively unaffected by the
carpenter's strike and Lerry said it
would probably remain so until
pickets appeared.
While the contractors were
uncertain of the length of any
forthcoming strike and its affect,
Lerry remained "optimistic"
about completion of the complex
by next summer.

WEATHERING THE STORM—Bad weather and recurring labor strikes have repeatedly delayed
completion of the new law school complex. The project is now threatened by the carpenter union's strike.
