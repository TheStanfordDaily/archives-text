# Shopping Center Murder Defendant Convicted
## 
### 
A 20-year-old San Carlos
babysitter was convicted
Thursday of first degree murder in
the kidnap-slaying of Palo Alto
housewife Liana Hughes.
Hughes, a blonde woman of 30
who had been married for seven
years, disappeared Jan. 29 from
the Stanford Shopping Center in
Palo Alto.
Six days later — on Feb. 3, her
body was found in her mini-motor
home, which was parked in a
Burlingame municipal parking lot.
Precisely what happened to her
during those six days remains a
mystery. An autopsy indicated

that she died only one day before
her body was found, from a fatal
dose of strychnine, possibly in an
alcoholic drink.
Willful slaying by use of a
poison, in this case strychnine, is
considered first degree murder in
California.
First Death Penalty Case
If the jury finds cause for the
death penalty, it would be the
first such case in a San Mateo
court since the new death penalty
law was enacted. The electorate
overwhelmingly voted in favor of
reinstatement of the death
penalty in 1972.

After 12 hours of deliberation
over three days, the jury foreman
handed the verdict to the judge,
who read its findings. The jury
had only two choices - first degree
murder or acquittal.
The defendant, John Kreuter,
didn't show a flicker of emotion
in his tall, thin frame as Judge
Frank Piombo read the jury's
verdict in San Mateo County
Superior Court.
Stepmother In Tears
However, Kreuter's attorney,
David Pomerenk, bowed his head,
and Kreuter's stepmother, Rhoda
Kreuter of Portola Valley, broke
into tears when the verdict was
announced.
Kreuter's father, Donald,
comforted her as they sat in a rear
seat of the courtroom after the
other spectators had left.
The jury of seven women and
five men who had heard the
three-week trial, were ordered to
return Monday at 9:30 a.m. for
the second phase of the
proceedings, which will determine
if Kreuter must go to the gas
chamber.
In this phase, the jury must
decide whether the killing
occurred during the commission
of robbery, rape or kidnaping,
and if Kreuter was involved in any
of these charges. If so, the death
penalty is mandatory under
California law.

The defendant Kreuter was
tied into the case by a bottle of
strychnine found in his room in
San Carlos and by a right palm
print found in the camper.
Police also said Kreuter had
cameras and equipment from the
Hughes' van in his possession and
was seen by witnesses in the area
where the van was parked.

Although Kreuter's employer,
Harriet Kutzman, contended that
he was sleeping in bed on the
night in question after performing
his duties as a live-in baby sitter,
the prosecutor, presented
arguments that Kreuter could
have slipped out of the house
during the night without her
knowledge.

Palo Alto.
Six days later — on Feb. 3, her
body was found in her mini-motor
home, which was parked in a
Burlingame municipal parking lot.
Precisely what happened to her
during those six days remains a
mystery. An autopsy indicated

that she died only one day before
her body was found, from a fatal
dose of strychnine, possibly in an
alcoholic drink.
Willful slaying by use of a
poison, in this case strychnine, is
considered first degree murder in
California.
First Death Penalty Case
If the jury finds cause for the
death penalty, it would be the
first such case in a San Mateo
court since the new death penalty
law was enacted. The electorate
overwhelmingly voted in favor of
reinstatement of the death
penalty in 1972.

After 12 hours of deliberation
over three days, the jury foreman
handed the verdict to the judge,
who read its findings. The jury
had only two choices - first degree
murder or acquittal.
The defendant, John Kreuter,
didn't show a flicker of emotion
in his tall, thin frame as Judge
Frank Piombo read the jury's
verdict in San Mateo County
Superior Court.
Stepmother In Tears
However, Kreuter's attorney,
David Pomerenk, bowed his head,
and Kreuter's stepmother, Rhoda
Kreuter of Portola Valley, broke
into tears when the verdict was
announced.
Kreuter's father, Donald,
comforted her as they sat in a rear
seat of the courtroom after the
other spectators had left.
The jury of seven women and
five men who had heard the
three-week trial, were ordered to
return Monday at 9:30 a.m. for
the second phase of the
proceedings, which will determine
if Kreuter must go to the gas
chamber.
In this phase, the jury must
decide whether the killing
occurred during the commission
of robbery, rape or kidnaping,
and if Kreuter was involved in any
of these charges. If so, the death
penalty is mandatory under
California law.

The defendant Kreuter was
tied into the case by a bottle of
strychnine found in his room in
San Carlos and by a right palm
print found in the camper.
Police also said Kreuter had
cameras and equipment from the
Hughes' van in his possession and
was seen by witnesses in the area
where the van was parked.

Although Kreuter's employer,
Harriet Kutzman, contended that
he was sleeping in bed on the
night in question after performing
his duties as a live-in baby sitter,
the prosecutor, presented
arguments that Kreuter could
have slipped out of the house
during the night without her
knowledge.

Geophysics Prof. Robert Kovach,
recently returned from Russia on
an international conference on
seismology, explained various
techniques of earthquake
prediction yesterday in Skilling
Auditorium. Kovach believes
seismoligists are continually
improving their methods. He
raised a tumult last summer by
predicting a 5.8 magnitude
earthquake for nearby Hollister,
but the quake failed to
materialize.
A 20-year-old San Carlos
babysitter was convicted
Thursday of first degree murder in
the kidnap-slaying of Palo Alto
housewife Liana Hughes.
Hughes, a blonde woman of 30
who had been married for seven
years, disappeared Jan. 29 from
the Stanford Shopping Center in
Palo Alto.
