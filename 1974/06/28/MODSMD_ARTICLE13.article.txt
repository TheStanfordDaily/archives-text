# Gay Women Form Collective
## 
### SANDY WHITE 
Fifty gay women gathered over sweet rolls and
coffee at Tresidder Wednesday night to meet each
other, talk, listen to music and organize the
women's collective of the Gay People's Union
(GPU).
Onita Dougherty, head of the fledgling
collective, was encouraged by the large turnout and
called on all gay women to "get up off their asses
and get together."
The University has done its share by leasing
them the second floor of the Old Firehouse, and
the State by giving the GPU $90,000, to be divided
equally between the men and the women over the
next three years.

Most women at the meeting did not know each
other and most were not from Stanford. But all
seemed enthusiastic about the prospects of regular
Tuesday night meetings.
Other concerns and plans included a coffee
house on Saturday nights, which many felt would
be a better alternative to lesbian bars.
One woman volunteered her home for weekly
"consciousness-raising sessions," geared especially
for the woman who is "coming out," or
acknowledging her gayness. Some professional
women expressed dismay that they could lose their
jobs and licenses if their homosexuality were
known.
