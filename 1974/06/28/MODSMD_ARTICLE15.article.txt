# S.F. Sheriff Urges Activism For Gays
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Homosexuals must enter "the
political arena" to stop abuses
against their civil rights, San
Francisco Sheriff Richard
Hongisto declared Tuesday at a
panel discussion on "Civil Rights
and Gays."
Most of the problems gays face
are a result of legislature and law
enforcement that are under the
thumbs of elected officials,
Hongisto, who is known for
supporting the San Francisco gay
community, remarked.
Gay people don't need to get
civil rights, Hongisto said; they
already have them. They need to
"get other people to stop
trampling on their rights," he said.
"People with a lifestyle that is
not totally conventional" are
under abuse in regard to law
enforcement harassment,
employment, housing, life
insurance and legal marriage, he
said.
In order to stop these abuses,
homosexuals need to involve
themselves in politics. To change
laws they must influence
legislators, sheriffs, judges and
mayors to change their policies,
Hongisto asserted.
Influencing Elections
Homosexuals must unite. A
community will have a lot of
influence on an election "if [it]
has got it down so it can vote in a
block," Hongisto said.
He added that a community
doesn't have to support a winning
candidate. As long as the
community has enough influence,
the other candidates will appeal

for its support.
"You don't have to win an
election," Hongisto stated, "you
can tilt an election with a few
thousand votes."
Volunteering
He urged the over 200 people
present to volunteer during
elections.
"There is nothing but
yourselves stopping you from
profoundly influencing political
activities in your community."
San Francisco attorney Rick
Stokes told the audience about
the legal consequences of
homosexual acts.
He deplored the vagueness of
many legal terms, such as sodomy,
disorderly conduct, public and
vagrancy, used to define illegal sex
acts.
Disorderly conduct applies to
homosexuals dancing and holding
hands in public as well as anal
intercourse, according to Stokes.
Four Aspects of Laws
Stokes urged lawmakers to
consider four aspects of sexual
offense laws.
First, a distinction should be
made between sexual acts that are
harmful to society and those that
hurt no one, Stokes said. Second,
he mentioned that sexual offense
laws are uncommon outside Anglo
countries. Third, he noted that
sexual offense laws are virtually
unenforceable.
He also agreed that it is right to
condemn public sex acts.
However, he announced, receiving
acclaiming applause, "It is wrong
to condemn a person for being a
homosexual." Stokes added, "We
should judge people by their acts;
heterosexuals and homosexuals
should be judged equally."
Discrimination Example
As an example of homosexual
discrimination, he noted that
police would tell a heterosexual
couple, found indulging in sexual
activities in the back seat of a car,
to "move along."
On the other hand, a
homosexual couple would be
charged with criminal activity.
Stokes' solution to the
problem would be to "wipe out a
whole bunch of sex laws,"
limiting them to two.
Felony, Misdemeanor
"It would be a felony for a
person to force his sex on another
person," Stokes said. "It would be
a misdemeanor for an individual
to expose himself where he knew
someone might be offended."
Instead of a police officer
arresting the individual, a private
citizen would have to file a
complaint against him, Stokes
suggested.
Jim Foster, executive director
of the Whitman-Radclyffe
Foundation also spoke, urging the
impatient to realize change
requires tiiru
He remarked thai gays should
stop then tiwaro rhftoric. We
should stop talking to ourselves
and start goinr cut to the others."
