# Council OK's P.A. Budget
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council
Tuesday approved a $14 million
preliminary budget for 1974-75.
The budget proposes
expenditures of $14,176,666, five
percent more than the current
year's budget, but it contains no

tax rate increase. The council still
has more than 30 adjustments and
changes to make, but the changes
will not alter the current base
figures.
The main conflict of the
budget concerned the affirmative
action program which provides
money for training programs and
hiring of women and minority
groups.
Monday, amid the protests of
the Palo Alto chapter of National
Organization of Women (NOW),
$50,000 was taken from the
program, leaving $73,000. NOW
did win a hearing before the
council's policy and procedures
committee on current hiring
practices.
The other controversial issue,
funding of the drug program run
by Palo Alto Community Drug

Abuse Board (PACDAB), came up
Tuesday night.
The board's request for
$160,000 to pay for increased
staff and a 20 percent pay raise
was cut to $135,539, which will
cover a 15 percent pay raise.
The budget also includes a
compensation plan for city
employees. Pay increases will go
to firemen, police, and
administrative staff, among
others. The increases stem from
agreements made a year ago for
cost of living compensations.
