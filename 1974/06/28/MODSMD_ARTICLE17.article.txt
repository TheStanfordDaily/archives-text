# 'Pete's Sake' Stars Slapstick Streisand
## 
### KAREN LACHENAUER 
Barbra Streisand's latest vehicle, For Pete's Sake, is a
fast-paced, even comedy worth the price of a night's
entertainment if you're practiced at suspending disbelief.
Directed by Peter Yates of Bullitt and John and Mary
fame, the movie zooms in and out of incredibly tricky
situations and has little human value (though it tries), but
otherwise is an unpretentious gamble on clean fun.
Streisand and Michael Sarrazin play Henry, short for
Henrietta, and Pete, two New Yorkers married to each
other and living beyond their phone solicitor—cab driver
means. They also live in Brooklyn, which for all the taste
one gets of it and for its dazzlingly polished streets might
be SanFrancisco.And they live in an apartment decorated by
a House and Gardens consultant with Whole Earth
Catologue in hand.
Pete's cab driving status is supposed to be redeemed in
everyone's eyes by his going to night school. But brother
Fred (William Redfield) and sister-in-law Helen (Estelle
Parsons) think Pete should hurry up and get that degree
and then a job, dropping Henry along the way if possible.
To the couple, it becomes increasingly clear that
splurges on pot roast for a dinner with Fred and Helen not
only go unappreciated but get them further into debt.
Pete sees his salvation in a tip that, since the U.S. is
making a wheat-like deal in Russia, the worth of pork
bellies (of all things) will go up. Without telling Pete,

Henry then mortgages her life, in effect, to borrow $3000
needed for the surefire investment.
The mire of dilemmas into which she sinks while
waiting to pay off the ever-compounding loan gets more
improbable and expensive all the time, scraping her against
nearly soliciting more than phone sales, making Mafioso
drops and rustling brahma bulls through the city. All ends
well, of course, the loan discharged and Henry and Pete
rich, but in the meantime, they almost lose much more
than an arm and a leg.
For Pete's Soke's brand of humor is evident in its title,
for one. Such obvious parallels are drawn at every level by
writiers Maurice Rishlin and Stanley Shapiro (the latter of
a Doris Day trilogy credit). In a grotesque parody on the
subway scene in The French Connection, Henry, bedecked
in a conspicuous blond wig which against all laws of logic
she never discards, avoids the policP by shuttling in and
out of the train.
The weakness is that the "police" are embodied by a
police dog who barks vociferously but never bites.
Animals play a ludicrous role at another juncture, as
Henry finds herself chasing her charges—a herd of Texas
cattle and the brahma bull—down traffic laden streets,
eventually landing atop the bull with a policeman wedged
behind her.
Every actor with the exception of Sarrazin, possibly,
turns in not brilliant but competent performances.

Renfield and Parsons are believably distasteful as the
snobby brother and sister-in-law combination jealous of
Henry's sexuality. Sarrazin at least looks cute, though his
role calls for little else than raising eyebrows; but
Streisand, as her wacky self reminiscent of What's Up
Doc?, carries the film with enthusiasm and the confidence
of a star who can do anything, including selling bathroom
products by phone.
For Pete's Soke's main downfall lies in the realm of
human affairs when it stops building sequences and waxes
philosophical. A touching exchange, Pete forgiving Henry
for her clandestine escapades, typifies the afterthought
allegiance to values.
The moral of the story - that Pete's really a great guy
who can make it by getting rich quick — is, upon closer
inspection, none too moral. And black maid Loretta
(Vivian Bonnel) ruminates far more than necessary over
her place cleaning house for whites. "It's the colored
woman!" she announces upon every entrance, chiding
Henry for making her work and straining the movie's
liberal attitude to its limits.
If the viewer allows for a menagerie of beasts and loan
sharks, relaxing into crazy slapstick that has little bearing
on reality or his own life, he can escape for an hour or two
into mindless but decent fun. Which is, after all, what
Hollywood movies are best at doing for us.

For Pete's Soke's main downfall lies in the realm of
human affairs when it stops building sequences and waxes
philosophical. A touching exchange, Pete forgiving Henry
for her clandestine escapades, typifies the afterthought
allegiance to values.
The moral of the story - that Pete's really a great guy
who can make it by getting rich quick — is, upon closer
inspection, none too moral. And black maid Loretta
(Vivian Bonnel) ruminates far more than necessary over
her place cleaning house for whites. "It's the colored
woman!" she announces upon every entrance, chiding
Henry for making her work and straining the movie's
liberal attitude to its limits.
If the viewer allows for a menagerie of beasts and loan
sharks, relaxing into crazy slapstick that has little bearing
on reality or his own life, he can escape for an hour or two
into mindless but decent fun. Which is, after all, what
Hollywood movies are best at doing for us.
Barbra Streisand's latest vehicle, For Pete's Sake, is a
fast-paced, even comedy worth the price of a night's
entertainment if you're practiced at suspending disbelief.
Directed by Peter Yates of Bullitt and John and Mary
fame, the movie zooms in and out of incredibly tricky
situations and has little human value (though it tries), but
otherwise is an unpretentious gamble on clean fun.
Streisand and Michael Sarrazin play Henry, short for
Henrietta, and Pete, two New Yorkers married to each
other and living beyond their phone solicitor—cab driver
means. They also live in Brooklyn, which for all the taste
one gets of it and for its dazzlingly polished streets might
be SanFrancisco.And they live in an apartment decorated by
a House and Gardens consultant with Whole Earth
Catologue in hand.
Pete's cab driving status is supposed to be redeemed in
everyone's eyes by his going to night school. But brother
Fred (William Redfield) and sister-in-law Helen (Estelle
Parsons) think Pete should hurry up and get that degree
and then a job, dropping Henry along the way if possible.
To the couple, it becomes increasingly clear that
splurges on pot roast for a dinner with Fred and Helen not
only go unappreciated but get them further into debt.
Pete sees his salvation in a tip that, since the U.S. is
making a wheat-like deal in Russia, the worth of pork
bellies (of all things) will go up. Without telling Pete,

Henry then mortgages her life, in effect, to borrow $3000
needed for the surefire investment.
The mire of dilemmas into which she sinks while
waiting to pay off the ever-compounding loan gets more
improbable and expensive all the time, scraping her against
nearly soliciting more than phone sales, making Mafioso
drops and rustling brahma bulls through the city. All ends
well, of course, the loan discharged and Henry and Pete
rich, but in the meantime, they almost lose much more
than an arm and a leg.
For Pete's Soke's brand of humor is evident in its title,
for one. Such obvious parallels are drawn at every level by
writiers Maurice Rishlin and Stanley Shapiro (the latter of
a Doris Day trilogy credit). In a grotesque parody on the
subway scene in The French Connection, Henry, bedecked
in a conspicuous blond wig which against all laws of logic
she never discards, avoids the policP by shuttling in and
out of the train.
The weakness is that the "police" are embodied by a
police dog who barks vociferously but never bites.
Animals play a ludicrous role at another juncture, as
Henry finds herself chasing her charges—a herd of Texas
cattle and the brahma bull—down traffic laden streets,
eventually landing atop the bull with a policeman wedged
behind her.
Every actor with the exception of Sarrazin, possibly,
turns in not brilliant but competent performances.

Renfield and Parsons are believably distasteful as the
snobby brother and sister-in-law combination jealous of
Henry's sexuality. Sarrazin at least looks cute, though his
role calls for little else than raising eyebrows; but
Streisand, as her wacky self reminiscent of What's Up
Doc?, carries the film with enthusiasm and the confidence
of a star who can do anything, including selling bathroom
products by phone.
