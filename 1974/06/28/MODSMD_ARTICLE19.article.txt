# 'I Am A Dancer' Portrays Rudolf Nureyev, Performer
## 
### JANICE ROSS 
I Am A Dancer, currently
playing at the Clay Theatre in San
Francisco, affords a rare glimpse
into the life of one of dance's
biggest stars and most enigmatic
personalities, Rudolf Nureyev.
Although film is one of the
best means of recording the
ephemeral art of the dance, there
are surprisingly few good dance
films available. However Pierre
Jourdan and Evdoros Demetriov,
the producers of I Am A Dancer,
have succeeded in creating a film
that is a happy exception.
Rather than striving to produce
an artistic statement of their own,
Jourdan and Demetriov are
content to simply provide a
well-documented record of
Nureyev in rehersal and
performance.
The title I Am A Dancer, is
somewhat misleading; instead of a
personal statement by Nureyev
about his life as a dancer, we are
allowed only brief looks at the

offstage role of this dance
celebrity. Nureyev never speaks
directly to us as audience; we see
snatches of interviews or hear
John Percival's modification of
Nureyev's statements, but the star
himself remains frustratingly
inaccesable. It's like one of those
sensationalistic movie magazines
that promises to tell you
everything and ends up revealing
nothing.
Nureyev has always been a
connoisseur of privacy. Recently
he confided, "I do not like the
public to know about my private
and personal life. If I were to
reveal what I do or think, then I
would have nothing left to call my
own. No one needs to know what
makes me like I am ... "
Ah! how Nureyev misjudges
American audiences! Today, in
dance as well as the other
performing arts, what a celebrity
does offstage is almost as
important as what he does
onstage.
Nureyev remains illusive. Even
in the scenes of him dancing the
pas de deux from Sleeping Beauty
or sections of La Sylphide he
maintains a personal hauteur that
never allows us to forget that it is

Rudolf Nureyev dancing a
character role. Nureyev's dancing
really comes alive when he can
forget about the implicit dramatic
and emotional overtones and just
dance.
This is especially evident in the
film in Glen Tetley's Field
Figures, a non-literal duet which
Nureyev dances magnificently
with Deanne Bergsma. In this
piece, devoid of a narrative
Scenario and the frills of costumes
and lights, we see Nureyev in
simple practice clothes dancing
with an abandon and passion
beyond that of the meticulous
technician which we have always
known him as.
Nonetheless Nureyev is a
classical dancer par excellence,
and as we see in / Am A Dancer,
he is striving to extend the
boundaries of this notoriety.
Perhaps more than anything /
Am A Dancer conveys to us
Nureyev's tremendous appetite
for performing. As he says"I have
a mission and I must fulfill it; a
dancer's life is very short and I
must dance constantly and I must
dance everything ..." I Am A
Dancer continues through next
Wednesday at the Clay.

performance.
The title I Am A Dancer, is
somewhat misleading; instead of a
personal statement by Nureyev
about his life as a dancer, we are
allowed only brief looks at the

offstage role of this dance
celebrity. Nureyev never speaks
directly to us as audience; we see
snatches of interviews or hear
John Percival's modification of
Nureyev's statements, but the star
himself remains frustratingly
inaccesable. It's like one of those
sensationalistic movie magazines
that promises to tell you
everything and ends up revealing
nothing.
Nureyev has always been a
connoisseur of privacy. Recently
he confided, "I do not like the
public to know about my private
and personal life. If I were to
reveal what I do or think, then I
would have nothing left to call my
own. No one needs to know what
makes me like I am ... "
Ah! how Nureyev misjudges
American audiences! Today, in
dance as well as the other
performing arts, what a celebrity
does offstage is almost as
important as what he does
onstage.
Nureyev remains illusive. Even
in the scenes of him dancing the
pas de deux from Sleeping Beauty
or sections of La Sylphide he
maintains a personal hauteur that
never allows us to forget that it is

Rudolf Nureyev dancing a
character role. Nureyev's dancing
really comes alive when he can
forget about the implicit dramatic
and emotional overtones and just
dance.
This is especially evident in the
film in Glen Tetley's Field
Figures, a non-literal duet which
Nureyev dances magnificently
with Deanne Bergsma. In this
piece, devoid of a narrative
Scenario and the frills of costumes
and lights, we see Nureyev in
simple practice clothes dancing
with an abandon and passion
beyond that of the meticulous
technician which we have always
known him as.
Nonetheless Nureyev is a
classical dancer par excellence,
and as we see in / Am A Dancer,
he is striving to extend the
boundaries of this notoriety.
Perhaps more than anything /
Am A Dancer conveys to us
Nureyev's tremendous appetite
for performing. As he says"I have
a mission and I must fulfill it; a
dancer's life is very short and I
must dance constantly and I must
dance everything ..." I Am A
Dancer continues through next
Wednesday at the Clay.
I Am A Dancer, currently
playing at the Clay Theatre in San
Francisco, affords a rare glimpse
into the life of one of dance's
biggest stars and most enigmatic
personalities, Rudolf Nureyev.
Although film is one of the
best means of recording the
ephemeral art of the dance, there
are surprisingly few good dance
films available. However Pierre
Jourdan and Evdoros Demetriov,
the producers of I Am A Dancer,
have succeeded in creating a film
that is a happy exception.
Rather than striving to produce
an artistic statement of their own,
Jourdan and Demetriov are
content to simply provide a
well-documented record of
Nureyev in rehersal and
performance.
