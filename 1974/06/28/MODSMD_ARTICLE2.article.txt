# Nurses Threaten To Strike Tuesday
## 
### DON COX BILL EVERS 
Nurses at Stanford Hospital
announced they will strike
Tuesday if their contract demands
are not met by Monday.
The Committee for the
Recognition of Nursing
Achievements (CRONA)
representing the hospital's 714
registered nurses has been engaged
in contract negotiations with the
hospital since March.
In anticipation of the possible
strike, the hospital took steps
earlier this week to reduce elective
admissions and surgeries.
CRONA President Bonnie
Johnson said in the event of a
strike, nurses will supply minimal
coverage for critical care areas but
would expect elective admissions
to be cancelled.
The Daily has learned that

nurses who support the strike will
staff on a rotating basis the
premature infant areas in
pediatrics, the intensive care unit,
emergency room, operating room
and coronary care unit.
Statements have been sent around
to doctors in the hospital by
CRONA asking their cooperation
in the event of a strike it was
learned.
Both CRONA and hospital
officials questioned by the Daily
yesterday repeatedly declined
comment on the status of the
negotiations and the issues under
discussion but sources said the
nurses original demands for their
one year contract included a 16
percent wage increase. The
hospital countered with an offer
of nine percent sources said. The
nurses had considered a 20
percent raise but decided that a
16 percent figure could not be
considered a "padded" figure.
CRONA's goal is to achieve a
pay scale equivalent to that of the
University of California sources
said. One nurse claimed a nurse at
Stanford with four years
experience is paid the same as a
first year nurse in a University of
California hospital.
If the nurses strike, nurses'
aides and licensed vocational
nurses are expected to stay on the
job. Nurses' aides negotiated a
new contract earlier this year and
got a "big pay raise" one source
