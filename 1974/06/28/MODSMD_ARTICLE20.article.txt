# Unaccompanied Piano Jazzes El Matador
## 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO - The great
Oscar Peterson appeared at El
Matador for two weeks, beginning
June 18, offering an all-too-rare
program of unaccompanied jazz
piano.
Whereas solo jazz piano
performances were once
commonplace, the opposite is
now the case, with pianists being
surrounded by every imaginable
form of orchestration. For a jazz
pianist to walk onto to a stage
alone is daring, to say the least.
As jazz historian Orrin
Keepnews once wrote, "Once
upon a time, all jazz piano solos
were unaccompanied. To be
technical about it, the reverse is
more accurate: in the beginning
all jazz bands were pianoless (no
one having been able to figure out
how to include a piano in a New
Orleans marching band). So the
pianist made his entrance onto the
scene as an individual artiste —
which may be a bit too fancy a
way to describe a man playing a
ragtime specialty in the parlor of a
whorehouse."
Jelly Roll Morton, James P.
Johnson, Fats Waller, Art Tatus,
and others, while they were
well-known for their various
ensemble performances, were

equally at home, and just as
famous for, playing with just their
two hands.
The late Art Tatus is usually
considered to be the greatest
technical pianist in jazz history,
and it was he who changed jazz
piano for all-time. Since the
formation of his trio, which
included Tiny Grimes on guitar
and bassist Slam Stewart, solo
piano has been a lost art — a
tragedy no matter how brilliant
that trio indeed was.
Oscar Peterson, a native of
Canada, was first given public
exposure through Norman Granz'
"Jazz at the Philharmonic" tours,
which teamed him, in a variety of
combinations, with such giants as
Charley Parker, Dizzy Gillespie,
Stan Getz, and others.
His famous trio has at various
stages included guitarists Herb
Ellis, Barney Kessell, Kenny
Burrell, and Joe Pass, assists Ray
Brown, Sam Jones, and Niels
Henning Pederson, and drummers
Ed Thigpen and Bob Durham.
Peterson is unquestionably the
most accomplished jazz pianist
alive, with the technical ability of
a concert pianist.
In the selections included
Thursday night, June 20, the
influence of Art Tatum was
readily noticeable, as Peterson
would start a slow ballad, then up
the tempo after a few bars,
throwing is stride and boogie
passages.
Peterson would take a
standard, like "Body and Soul,"
and play it in every imaginable
style before he was done with it.
The packed house heard
astounding renditions of such old
favorites as "Autumn Leaves," "I
Can't Get Started," and "Smile,"
along with more recent tunes like
"On A Clear Day."

The late Art Tatus is usually
considered to be the greatest
technical pianist in jazz history,
and it was he who changed jazz
piano for all-time. Since the
formation of his trio, which
included Tiny Grimes on guitar
and bassist Slam Stewart, solo
piano has been a lost art — a
tragedy no matter how brilliant
that trio indeed was.
Oscar Peterson, a native of
Canada, was first given public
exposure through Norman Granz'
"Jazz at the Philharmonic" tours,
which teamed him, in a variety of
combinations, with such giants as
Charley Parker, Dizzy Gillespie,
Stan Getz, and others.
His famous trio has at various
stages included guitarists Herb
Ellis, Barney Kessell, Kenny
Burrell, and Joe Pass, assists Ray
Brown, Sam Jones, and Niels
Henning Pederson, and drummers
Ed Thigpen and Bob Durham.
Peterson is unquestionably the
most accomplished jazz pianist
alive, with the technical ability of
a concert pianist.
In the selections included
Thursday night, June 20, the
influence of Art Tatum was
readily noticeable, as Peterson
would start a slow ballad, then up
the tempo after a few bars,
throwing is stride and boogie
passages.
Peterson would take a
standard, like "Body and Soul,"
and play it in every imaginable
style before he was done with it.
The packed house heard
astounding renditions of such old
favorites as "Autumn Leaves," "I
Can't Get Started," and "Smile,"
along with more recent tunes like
"On A Clear Day."
SAN FRANCISCO - The great
Oscar Peterson appeared at El
Matador for two weeks, beginning
June 18, offering an all-too-rare
program of unaccompanied jazz
piano.
Whereas solo jazz piano
performances were once
commonplace, the opposite is
now the case, with pianists being
surrounded by every imaginable
form of orchestration. For a jazz
pianist to walk onto to a stage
alone is daring, to say the least.
As jazz historian Orrin
Keepnews once wrote, "Once
upon a time, all jazz piano solos
were unaccompanied. To be
technical about it, the reverse is
more accurate: in the beginning
all jazz bands were pianoless (no
one having been able to figure out
how to include a piano in a New
Orleans marching band). So the
pianist made his entrance onto the
scene as an individual artiste —
which may be a bit too fancy a
way to describe a man playing a
ragtime specialty in the parlor of a
whorehouse."
Jelly Roll Morton, James P.
Johnson, Fats Waller, Art Tatus,
and others, while they were
well-known for their various
ensemble performances, were

equally at home, and just as
famous for, playing with just their
two hands.
