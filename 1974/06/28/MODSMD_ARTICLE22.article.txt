# Swim Meet Begins Today
## 
### 
The Santa Clara International
Swimming and Diving meet, one
of the top events of its kind in the
world, begins today at the Santa
Clara International Swim Center.
Among the entrants are John

Hencken, Stanford junior and
1972 200 breast stroke gold
medalist, and Vicki Hays, star of
Stanford's women's swim team.
The men's division of the meet
has relatively fewer "big names"
than last year, because of the
retirement of many swimmers,
but the women's event should be
unusually strong.
Preliminaries will get underway
at 9 a.m. today and on Sunday,
the final day of the meet, with
Saturday's events starting at 8:30.
