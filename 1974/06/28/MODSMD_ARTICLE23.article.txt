Nixon Gels Warm Soviet Welcome
MOSCOW—President Nixon received a warm welcome as
he arrived in Moscow yesterday for the first day of summit
talks with Soviet leaders.
Nixon was greeted by about 10,000 Russians who lined
the motorcade route taken by the President and Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev. According to newsmen, other
Russians were shunted into side streets when they
attempted to join the crowds. This was interpreted as an
effort by the Soviet government to hold down crowds.
Brezhnev and Nixon exchanged jokes and banter during
a state dinner yesterday evening. The two leaders agreed to
meet in Washington next year; Brezhnev making it obvious
that he expects Nixon to still be President at that time.
The two leaders were expected to confer today about
increasing trade and trying to lessen the possibility of
nuclear war. No major arms-limitation pact is expected to
come out of the summit, however.
Wednesday, in an apparent goodwill gesture to the
President, the USSR freed Gen. Pyotr Grigorenko after
holding him in prison and mental institutions for five
years.
Meanwhile, in Washington, Sen. William Fulbright,
D.-Ark., and Sen. Henry Jackson, D. Wash., continued
their verbal argument concerning whether the U.S. should
withhold economic concessions until the Soviets change
their emigration policies toward Jews.
Fulbright specifically mentioned Jackson in his speech,
which criticized "cold warriors at home" for using Nixon's
domestic difficulties to undermine detente.
St. Clair Starts President's Defense
WASHINGTON—White House lawyer James St. Clair
began his defense of the President before the House
Judiciary Committee yesterday.
Congressmen, talking to newsmen after the closed-door
session of the committee, which is seeking the President's
impeachment, rated St. Clair's presentation along partisan
lines. *
The President's lawyers sent the committee a letter
urging the panel to get testimony from former White
House counsel John Dean, who has been a principal
accuser of the President.

St. Clair said he expected Dean to testify that Nixon
never approved payment of hush money to E. Howard
Hunt, one of the Watergate burglars. St. Clair said Dean
would say "that at most the matter was left hanging and
nothing was resolved." This issue is considered key to
allegations that the President was involved in the cover-up.
Demonstrators March In Atlanta
ATLANTA—About 200 black demonstrators marched
peacefully in Atlanta yesterday, after a similar
demonstration Wednesday provoked fighting between
demonstrators and police.
The crowd was protesting the killing of a 17-year-old
boy by police Saturday. Underlying the demonstration,
however, was the issue of whether police chief John Inman
should resign.
Mayor Maynard Jackson, a bitter foe of Inman, and the
city's first black chief executive, issued an executive order
allowing the protest yesterday.
On Wednesday, no such permit was issued and 11
persons were arrested for parading without a permit. The
organizer of the march to protest the slaying of Brandon
Gibson, the Rev. Hosea Williams, was additionally charged
with inciting to riot.
Williams, head of the Atlanta chapter of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, has vowed to remain in
jail until Inman resigns. Inman, a white, has accused Mayor
Jackson of provoking lawlessness "by failing to promote
law enforcement in this city."
Ehrlichman Jury Selected
WASHINGTON—Jury selection was completed yesterday
at the trial of former White House advisor John
Ehrlichman and three others.
The jury consists of nine blacks and three whites.
Ehrlichman, G. Gordon Liddy, Bernard L. Barker and
Eugenio Martinez are accused of conspiracy to break into
the office of the psychiatrist of Daniel Ellsburg.
Opening statements and the first prosecution witnesses
are expected to be heard today.
Meanwhile, former White House Chief of Staff H. R.
Haldeman has said he will call reporters and officials into
court to testify about news leaks in the Watergate case.

automobiles made between 1966 and 1970.

Air Resources Board delayed implementation of the order
for one year beginning last Dec. 19, because of the
gasoline crisis.
Farr Found In Contempt Of Court
LOS ANGELES—Reporter William Farr was found in
contempt of court and the county grand jury yesterday
for refusing to disclose the source of a 1970 story.

The Superior Court in Los Angeles ordered Farr to
return to court Tuesday for sentencing. Farr served 46
days in prison following a previous contempt citation
before being released pending appeal.

Angels baseball club, it was announced last night.

championships before quitting at the end of last season,

Nixon Gels Warm Soviet Welcome
MOSCOW—President Nixon received a warm welcome as
he arrived in Moscow yesterday for the first day of summit
talks with Soviet leaders.
Nixon was greeted by about 10,000 Russians who lined
the motorcade route taken by the President and Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev. According to newsmen, other
Russians were shunted into side streets when they
attempted to join the crowds. This was interpreted as an
effort by the Soviet government to hold down crowds.
Brezhnev and Nixon exchanged jokes and banter during
a state dinner yesterday evening. The two leaders agreed to
meet in Washington next year; Brezhnev making it obvious
that he expects Nixon to still be President at that time.
The two leaders were expected to confer today about
increasing trade and trying to lessen the possibility of
nuclear war. No major arms-limitation pact is expected to
come out of the summit, however.
Wednesday, in an apparent goodwill gesture to the
President, the USSR freed Gen. Pyotr Grigorenko after
holding him in prison and mental institutions for five
years.
Meanwhile, in Washington, Sen. William Fulbright,
D.-Ark., and Sen. Henry Jackson, D. Wash., continued
their verbal argument concerning whether the U.S. should
withhold economic concessions until the Soviets change
their emigration policies toward Jews.
Fulbright specifically mentioned Jackson in his speech,
which criticized "cold warriors at home" for using Nixon's
domestic difficulties to undermine detente.
St. Clair Starts President's Defense
WASHINGTON—White House lawyer James St. Clair
began his defense of the President before the House
Judiciary Committee yesterday.
Congressmen, talking to newsmen after the closed-door
session of the committee, which is seeking the President's
impeachment, rated St. Clair's presentation along partisan
lines. *
The President's lawyers sent the committee a letter
urging the panel to get testimony from former White
House counsel John Dean, who has been a principal
accuser of the President.

St. Clair said he expected Dean to testify that Nixon
never approved payment of hush money to E. Howard
Hunt, one of the Watergate burglars. St. Clair said Dean
would say "that at most the matter was left hanging and
nothing was resolved." This issue is considered key to
allegations that the President was involved in the cover-up.
Demonstrators March In Atlanta
ATLANTA—About 200 black demonstrators marched
peacefully in Atlanta yesterday, after a similar
demonstration Wednesday provoked fighting between
demonstrators and police.
The crowd was protesting the killing of a 17-year-old
boy by police Saturday. Underlying the demonstration,
however, was the issue of whether police chief John Inman
should resign.
Mayor Maynard Jackson, a bitter foe of Inman, and the
city's first black chief executive, issued an executive order
allowing the protest yesterday.
On Wednesday, no such permit was issued and 11
persons were arrested for parading without a permit. The
organizer of the march to protest the slaying of Brandon
Gibson, the Rev. Hosea Williams, was additionally charged
with inciting to riot.
Williams, head of the Atlanta chapter of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, has vowed to remain in
jail until Inman resigns. Inman, a white, has accused Mayor
Jackson of provoking lawlessness "by failing to promote
law enforcement in this city."

automobiles made between 1966 and 1970.
The Court unanimously decided that the board lacked
the authority to postpone the installation of devises. The
Air Resources Board delayed implementation of the order
for one year beginning last Dec. 19, because of the
gasoline crisis.
Farr Found In Contempt Of Court
LOS ANGELES—Reporter William Farr was found in
contempt of court and the county grand jury yesterday
for refusing to disclose the source of a 1970 story.
The story, printed in the Herald Examiner in 1970,
quoted a woman prisoner as saying the Manson group was
planning to murder several celebrities, including Frank
Sinatra.
The Superior Court in Los Angeles ordered Farr to
return to court Tuesday for sentencing. Farr served 46
days in prison following a previous contempt citation
before being released pending appeal.
Williams—From A's To Angels
ANAHEIM—Dick Williams, former manager of the
Oakland A's, has been hired to take over the California
Angels baseball club, it was announced last night.
Williams, who guided the A's to two world
championships before quitting at the end of last season,
replaces Bobby Winkles, who was fired. Williams'
appointment was made possibly by A's owner Charles
Finley, who asked a judge to lift an injunction barring
Williams from managing any other club.
Today's Weather
Fair through Saturday, except for low overcast early
mornings. Highs in the mid 70's to lower 80's, lows in the
50's. Winds from the west to northwest, 10 to 20 miles per
hour in the afternoons.
Nixon Gels Warm Soviet Welcome
MOSCOW—President Nixon received a warm welcome as
he arrived in Moscow yesterday for the first day of summit
talks with Soviet leaders.
Nixon was greeted by about 10,000 Russians who lined
the motorcade route taken by the President and Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev. According to newsmen, other
Russians were shunted into side streets when they
attempted to join the crowds. This was interpreted as an
effort by the Soviet government to hold down crowds.
Brezhnev and Nixon exchanged jokes and banter during
a state dinner yesterday evening. The two leaders agreed to
meet in Washington next year; Brezhnev making it obvious
that he expects Nixon to still be President at that time.
The two leaders were expected to confer today about
increasing trade and trying to lessen the possibility of
nuclear war. No major arms-limitation pact is expected to
come out of the summit, however.
Wednesday, in an apparent goodwill gesture to the
President, the USSR freed Gen. Pyotr Grigorenko after
holding him in prison and mental institutions for five
years.
Meanwhile, in Washington, Sen. William Fulbright,
D.-Ark., and Sen. Henry Jackson, D. Wash., continued
their verbal argument concerning whether the U.S. should
withhold economic concessions until the Soviets change
their emigration policies toward Jews.
Fulbright specifically mentioned Jackson in his speech,
which criticized "cold warriors at home" for using Nixon's
domestic difficulties to undermine detente.
St. Clair Starts President's Defense
WASHINGTON—White House lawyer James St. Clair
began his defense of the President before the House
Judiciary Committee yesterday.
Congressmen, talking to newsmen after the closed-door
session of the committee, which is seeking the President's
impeachment, rated St. Clair's presentation along partisan
lines. *
The President's lawyers sent the committee a letter
urging the panel to get testimony from former White
House counsel John Dean, who has been a principal
accuser of the President.

St. Clair said he expected Dean to testify that Nixon
never approved payment of hush money to E. Howard
Hunt, one of the Watergate burglars. St. Clair said Dean
would say "that at most the matter was left hanging and
nothing was resolved." This issue is considered key to
allegations that the President was involved in the cover-up.
Demonstrators March In Atlanta
ATLANTA—About 200 black demonstrators marched
peacefully in Atlanta yesterday, after a similar
demonstration Wednesday provoked fighting between
demonstrators and police.
The crowd was protesting the killing of a 17-year-old
boy by police Saturday. Underlying the demonstration,
however, was the issue of whether police chief John Inman
should resign.
Mayor Maynard Jackson, a bitter foe of Inman, and the
city's first black chief executive, issued an executive order
allowing the protest yesterday.
On Wednesday, no such permit was issued and 11
persons were arrested for parading without a permit. The
organizer of the march to protest the slaying of Brandon
Gibson, the Rev. Hosea Williams, was additionally charged
with inciting to riot.
Williams, head of the Atlanta chapter of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, has vowed to remain in
jail until Inman resigns. Inman, a white, has accused Mayor
Jackson of provoking lawlessness "by failing to promote
law enforcement in this city."
Ehrlichman Jury Selected
WASHINGTON—Jury selection was completed yesterday
at the trial of former White House advisor John
Ehrlichman and three others.
The jury consists of nine blacks and three whites.
Ehrlichman, G. Gordon Liddy, Bernard L. Barker and
Eugenio Martinez are accused of conspiracy to break into
the office of the psychiatrist of Daniel Ellsburg.
Opening statements and the first prosecution witnesses
are expected to be heard today.
Meanwhile, former White House Chief of Staff H. R.
Haldeman has said he will call reporters and officials into
court to testify about news leaks in the Watergate case.
