# Regents Reaffirm Earlier Vote, 8-1
## Colorado Turns Down Franklin Again 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The University of Colorado Board of Regents
voted 8-1 Tuesday against hiring former Stanford
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin. The decision
reaffirmed action taken two months earlier by the
Board.
Franklin, who was dismissed from here in
January, 1972 for allegedly inciting students to
violence during campus disturbances in 1971, said
yesterday that he believes the Regents' decision is
"in clear violation of Colorado and Federal law"
which say no state agency can deny a person a job
because of his political beliefs.
Franklin appeared Tuesday before the Colorado
Board which he said questioned him about his
political beliefs and affiliations, as well as his
academic achievements.
The Regents violated their own rules which state
that "political beliefs are not to be considered"
when making such a decision, Franklin claimed.
Regent Asks Reconsideration
According to Kathy Brotzman at the Colorado
University News Service, Regent Byron Johnson
asked that Franklin's case be reconsidered, though
he ended up voting with the majority.
The lone Franklin supporter, Regent Geraldine
Bean, had also supported hiring him when the
original vote was taken.
That vote occurred on the same day the Regents
voted to fire University President Frederick T.

Thiene, but Franklin said at the time he doubted
there was any connection between the two
decisions.
'Academic Freedom'
However, before that vote, a large number of
Regents openly supported Franklin. Several
members had told the Daily they would probably
vote to hire him.
Paul Levitt, chairman of Colorado's English
Department, said on April 8 that the Regents
would vote to hire Franklin because "the
University of Colorado believes in academic
freedom." After the first vote, Levitt declared that
violence had been done to academic freedom.
The English Department voted 28-5 earlier this
year to offer Franklin, nationally known for his
scholarship and writing on Herman Melville, the
post of associate professor. He held that position
here until he was fired.
'False Accusations'
Franklin claimed yesterday, as he had
previously, that some Stanford officials attempted
to persuade the Regents to reject his appointment.
The packets of material received by the Regents
contained "false accusations" Franklin said, adding
that persons who sent the packets kept their
identity secret.

charges by Franklin that the
administration here conspired to
keep Franklin unemployed. "We
would have no reason to do
anything like that" he said April
25.
Franklin said he would be
leaving in about a month for his
position as visiting fellow at

Wesleyan University's Center for
the Humanities during autumn
quarter. Wesleyan is located in
Middletown, Conn.
Franklin will be responsible for
conducting a seminar on "Art and
Criminality," at the center. He
said the seminar might focus on
Melville, who Franklin pointed
out was a criminal himself.
