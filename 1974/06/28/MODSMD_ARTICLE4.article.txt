## Row Decision 
### 
The decision to place an 82-unit condominium project for faculty,
staff and emeriti on the Row surprised many students here - not
because the decision was to build on the Row, but because once again
an important University decision affecting students was handed down
while few students were around or had time to protest.
President Lyman's decision to give the project his go-ahead came
after a meeting Tuesday, June 11, the next-to-the-last day of spring
quarter finals. This was the same decision Lyman termed "imminent"
May 1 on KZSU's Campus Conference.
Lyman's decision came while the majority of students were
immersed in study for their final exams. Many others had already left
for the summer or for a brief vacation before returning for summer
session.
In addition, the final plans for the project were released June 5 -
just coincidentally the day the final Daily of the quarter appeared.
There was no University News Service release of the plan completion
or of Lyman's decision, so that formal announcement of the
University's actions was nominal until the trustees made the decision
final.
Project blueprints were exhibited in the Row office in Grove House
during finals week, though, and University officials did make some
effort to contact students to get their reactions, but the bulk of the
student body was left in the dark.
The emeriti housing project fiasco could be construed to represent
a lack of consideration of student opinion in important University
decisions. Or it could be interpreted as merely the lack of impact of
student input in University decision-making.
More importantly, however, this latest decision seems to represent
another instance in a disturbing pattern of crucial decisions made
during quarter breaks or finals week — times when student-response is
minimal.
Among other notable determinations made essentially covertly
were the shift of the black theme house from Roble to Lagunita this
spring and the March, 1972 suspensions of four students, the
so-called "placement center four," for disruption of recruiting
activities.
These "surprising" decisions on issues surrounded by student
opposition might suggest to some a grand University conspiracy to
hold any controversial decision for break or finals time. Perhaps what
is needed to eliminate such student speculation is a more formalized,
streamlined and revised University decision-making process.
