# Price Hikes
## 
### 
As just noted, periods when few students are present seem to be
times when changes to which many members of the community
would object are effected.
Another example of this occured last week when Canteen Corp.
began raising its price for soft drinks from 20 to 25 cents, and for
milk from 15 to 20 cents. ,
One year ago, the price for 12 ounces of soda was only 15 cents.
While Canteen, sole vendor on campus, may be able to justify this 67
percent one-year increase, it seems to us that the new prices are
intolerable.
