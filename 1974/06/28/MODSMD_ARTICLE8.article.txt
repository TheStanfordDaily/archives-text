Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago
(New York: Harper & Row, 1974), 660 pages,
$1.95 (paperback).
Solzhenitsyn's new book is both a historical
study and a moral and political evaluation of the
system of forced labor camps in the Soviet Union.
It was intended by its author for a Russian
audience, for a Russian public that lives in
considerable ignorance of the history of the regime
which has been ruling the country.
But the book has appeared in the West (because
a hidden copy was found in Russia by the state
security forces), though the problem it discusses is
a Russian problem and one which can only justly be
resolved by popular pressures in Russia and by legal
measures there vindicating the innocent and
punishing the guilty.
Still, because of the political power of the Soviet
Union and the ideological importance of Marxian
socialism, Solzhenitsyn's book has had an impact in
the West.
Cold warriors like Henry Jackson who oppose
peaceful coexistence and normal commercial
relations with Russia are trying to use the book as a
weapon.
Maoists and Stalinists are distraught. For
example, Irwin Silber of the Guardian called the
book "an anthology of wild rumors, speculation,
gossip, and self-pity."
Revival of Politics
Independent radicals see the book as part of the
revival of politics in the Soviet Union. Ramparts
editor David Horowitz chides those leftists who are
worried that the sensation caused by Solzhenitsyn
will disrupt moves toward peace that they are
giving "credence to the cold war myth that
America's hostility towards the Soviet Union is
based on the plight of the individual under
Communist rule."
Anarchists note that Solzhenitsyn presents
evidence on the thoroughgoing injustice of state
socialism. Historian Paul Avrich writes in the
American anarchist newspaper Match: "It was
Lenin, in fact, who inaugurated the whole system
of repression that Stalin was later to perfect.
"And his victims, beyond the landowners,
officers, and bureaucrats who were bent upon
restoring the tsarist order, induded dedicated
revolutionaries — Mensheviks, Anarchists, Socialist
Revolutionaries — who criticized the Bolsheviks for
betraying the true principles of the Revolution and
who demanded the restoration of industrial
democrarcy, freely-elected soviets, and freedom of
speech, press, and assembly, all of which the new

dictatorship had suppressed."
Underlying current interest in the book is
recognition of the truth value of Solzhenitsyn's
account of the hidden history of the forced labor
system.
It is a special problem to judge the historical
accuracy of a study of a topic that is a state secret,
written in a country oppressed by political
intimidation.
But we know that Solzhenitsyn's study is
accepted as a serious work by Russian left
communist Roy Medvedev, who is familiar with
underground writings on the Stalin period, yet by
no means shares Solzhenitsyn's Russian orthodox
Christian social doctrines. In general, the material
in the book conforms to eyewitness accounts
previously published in the West.
It seems that Soviet government officials were
distressed by the book precisely because it
contained facts that they could not counter.
Purges Passed
A major weakness of the work as a historical
study is that it mentions only in passing the purge
trials of the 19305, events which were neither
uninteresting nor unimportant.
Solzhenitsyn's description of Nikolai Bukharin's
trial is a more extreme version of Arthur Koestler's
characterization of Bukharin in Darkness at Noon.
But recent scholarship (especially that of George
Katkov) indicates that Bukharin battled verbally
with the prosecutor throughout the public trial,
admitting generalized guilt, but refuting every
single specific charge.
The political lesson to be learned from
Solzhenitsyn's portrait of the 20th-century Russian
labor camps is the danger of a powerful
government. Especially important in the Soviet
Union is the official doctrine of the social nature of
crime and punishment, a doctrine which functions
to disarm and undermine resistance on political
grounds.
A powerful government with an elite police
force, a ruling party that believes and teaches that
the decisions of its leaders are always right,
rejection of the idea that absolute truth (and hence
absolute guilt or innocence) exists, a rehabilitative
prison system that naturally leaves discretionary
power in the hands of prison officials (instead of
laws proportionally fitting punishments to the
gravity of offenses) — these were the ingredients of
the terror waged by the Soviet government against
the Soviet people.
