# Arrow, Lipset Reject Professorship Offers
## 
### 
Stanford University has failed
in its attempts to lure two
prominent Harvard professors to
join the faculty next year.
Nobel Prize-winning economist
Kenneth J. Arrow and
Government Prof. Seymour
Martin Lipset both turned down
offers, the Daily learned
yesterday.
Arrow, who taught economics
and statistics here for nearly 20
years before accepting the
endowed Frank W. Taussing
research' professorship in
economics at Harvard in 1968,
said personal reasons led him to
choose to remain at Harvard.
"There were attractions in
both directions," Arrow said, but
"we [his family] will remain, at
least for a few years." Arrow is on
campus now, attending the
Institute for Mathematics and
Social Sciences.
He would have received a
newly created, endowed
professorship in economics and

operations research had he
accepted.
Arrow and Sir John Hicks of
Oxford University won the 1972
Nobel Prize in Economics for
what the Royal Swedish Academy
of Science called "their pioneering
contributions to the general
economic equilibrium theory and
welfare theory."
Fred Glover, Secretary to the
University said the Board of
Trustees had been informed that
Lipset would remain at Harvard.
He had been offered two
positions — one as a research
associate with Hoover Institution
on War, Revolution and Peace; the
other as a professor of political
science and sociology.
