# Nurses Reject Contract, Decide To Strike Today
## 
### DON COX 
Stanford Hospital nurses voted
"overwhelmingly" to walk out on
strike this morning after rejecting
an eleventh-hour contract offer.
Hospital officials predicted the
strike, the first by the nurses in
the hospital's history, would have
a "significant impact" on the
hospital.
In anticipation of the strike,
the hospital reduced its patient
load from over 500 to less than
200 in the past few days. Hoover
Pavillion was closed yesterday and
its patients either discharged to
their homes or transferred to the
main hospital complex.
Non-critically ill patients have
been transferred to other
hospitals.
Elective surgeries have been
cancelled and admissions sharply
reduced. Prospective patients not
in need of immediate emergency
aid are being redirected to other
area hospitals.
Reducing Patient Load
Deputy Director of Hospital
Administration Paul Hofmann
said in a memo circulated last
week that the hospital "will
attempt to reduce the [patient]
census to the lowest possible level
which is consistent with our
community responsibilities and
our ability to adequately staff for
the care of those patients."
'To avoid the acrimony that

developed between physicians and
nurses at Bay Area hospitals
during the San Francisco strike,
we expect that nurses at Stanford
will respect the conclusions of its
physicians as to the necessity of
nursing care," said Hofmann.
Officials hope to reduce the
patient load to about 130 in the
618-bed hospital. Nurses have
agreed to staff critical care areas.
The Committee for the
Recognition and Nursing
Achievements (CRONA),
representing the hospital's 714
registered nurses, seeks a 16
percent increase in wages and a
one percent boost in benefits. The
hospital offered a 12 percent raise
Sunday, just hours before the
nurses' present contract expired.
CRONA's wage demand is
based on a comparison of salaries
received by nurses at Stanford and
the University of California
Medical Center in San Francisco.
'Superior Benefits'
Assoc. Dean of the School of
Medicine Thomas Gonda
acknowledged in a memo
yesterday that Stanford's salaries
were lower than at other
institutions but that benefits at
Stanford hospital were
"superior."
"Our objective is to have the
total rate of compensation
(salaries and benefits) of
employees reflect the total rate of
compensation at comparable
institutions in the Bay Area,"
Gonda said.
Hospital Offer's Cost
The hospital's -12 percent offer
would cost the hospital $950,000
annually, an administrative memo
said.

CRONA has remained adamant
with regard to its 16 percent
increase demand. Neither CRONA
nor hospital officials would
comment on the negotiations
except to say that the two parties
have agreed to continue to meet
to resolve the dispute.
A state mediator has joined the
negotiations at the request of the
hospital and the nurses. The
hospital has also offered to
"accept final and binding
arbitration of our disagreement by
an impartial arbitrator chosen by
mutual agreement." CRONA has
not responded publicly to this
offer.
The hospital, which has been
engaged in negotiations with
CRONA since March, has had to
increase its contract offers in light
of other recent settlements
hospital officials said.
No negotiating sessions were
planned for today.
