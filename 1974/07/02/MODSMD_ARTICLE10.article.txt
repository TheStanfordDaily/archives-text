# Law Prof Elected New P.A. Mayor
## 
### 
Law Prof. Byron D. Sher was
elected mayor of Palo Alto on the
37th ballot at the City Council
meeting last night. He will succeed
Kirke W. Comstock, who served
three years.
Sher, 45, garnered the
necessary five of nine Council
member votes after 70 minutes of
inconclusive balloting. His
principal competition during the
election was Enid Pearson, Palo
Alto's vice mayor until last night.
Sher and Pearson are members
of the liberal "residential ist"
majority. Everyone believed the
mayor would be elected from
among its ranks, even before the
balloting began.
Alan Henderson, a third
member of that five-person
coalition, was elected vice mayor
on only the third ballot following
the mayoral election. He had
openly supported Pearson for
mayor, and was the only
candidate who expressed an
interest in the office of vice

mayor.
The 37 ballots is the second
highest total since the Council
began electing a Mayor in 1909.
In 1965, it took 46 ballots to
elect Edward Arnold.
Sher was elected to a four-year
Council term in May, 1973,
receiving the largest vote total of
16 candidates for five four-year

terms. Sher had previously served
on the Council in 1965-1967,
before being one of four liberal
members removed from office
during a stormy recall election.
Henderson, a member of the
Council for three years, is a
business manager at the Center of
Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences.
