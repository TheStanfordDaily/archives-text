# 'Hell, Heaven Experienced Through LSD'
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
"In the laboratory we are
discovering that hell exists, heaven
exists, purgatory exists — just not
in the time-space continuum.
They exist in altered states of
consciousness," according to Dr.
Stanislav Grof, noted LSD
researcher, who lectured Friday at
Meyer Library.
Until he took a leave of
absence in 1973, Grof was chief
of research at the Maryland
Psychiatric Research Center and
an assistant professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences
at John Hopkins Univesity.
Speaking with Grof was his wife
and co-researcher, Joan
Halifax-Grof. Ms. Grof is a
medical anthropologist.
During their research in
Maryland with terminal cancer
patients and patients suffering

from severe psychosis, the Grofs
discovered that many subjects
given large doses of LSD
experience feelings which make
them believe that they are dying.
Subsequently, the subject usually
feels "reborn" into a blissful and
euphoric mental state.
Dr. Grof called the experience,
"an encounter with death that is
so total that they [the subjects]
occasionally forget where they are
and think they are actually
dying."
Ms. Grof explained that in
many non-Western cultures such
death-rebirth experiences are part
of the religious tradition
surrounding transitional periods in
a person's life like birth, puberty,
marriage, aging and dying. Ms.
Grof noted that Western culture
presents, "birth, sex and death
taken out of the context of the

sacred."
Dr. Grof called LSD a
"catalyst, amplifier, unspecific
energizer of the system," and
explained that the drug merely
exposes human experiences which
are found in other societies
without the use of drugs being
necessary.
Refering to his own first use of
LSD in Czechoslovakia in 1956,
Dr. Grof said, "I didn't realize this
was a potential within me; I
thought it was the drug. So
instead of studying me, I studied
the drug."
Ms. Grof described the couple's
recent experience with a terminal
cancer patient who became
mentally able to "leave" her body
under LSD. Before her death, the
woman learned to experience the
same feeling without the drug.

explained that the drug merely
exposes human experiences which
are found in other societies
without the use of drugs being
necessary.
Refering to his own first use of
LSD in Czechoslovakia in 1956,
Dr. Grof said, "I didn't realize this
was a potential within me; I
thought it was the drug. So
instead of studying me, I studied
the drug."
Ms. Grof described the couple's
recent experience with a terminal
cancer patient who became
mentally able to "leave" her body
under LSD. Before her death, the
woman learned to experience the
same feeling without the drug.

GROF AND GROF-Dr. Stanislav
Grof and his wife Joan-Halifax
Grof, Ph.D., spoke Friday on the
parallels between certain LSD
experiences and the death-rebirth
cycle inherent in the various
stages of human life.
"In the laboratory we are
discovering that hell exists, heaven
exists, purgatory exists — just not
in the time-space continuum.
They exist in altered states of
consciousness," according to Dr.
Stanislav Grof, noted LSD
researcher, who lectured Friday at
Meyer Library.
Until he took a leave of
absence in 1973, Grof was chief
of research at the Maryland
Psychiatric Research Center and
an assistant professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences
at John Hopkins Univesity.
Speaking with Grof was his wife
and co-researcher, Joan
Halifax-Grof. Ms. Grof is a
medical anthropologist.
During their research in
Maryland with terminal cancer
patients and patients suffering

from severe psychosis, the Grofs
discovered that many subjects
given large doses of LSD
experience feelings which make
them believe that they are dying.
Subsequently, the subject usually
feels "reborn" into a blissful and
euphoric mental state.
Dr. Grof called the experience,
"an encounter with death that is
so total that they [the subjects]
occasionally forget where they are
and think they are actually
dying."
Ms. Grof explained that in
many non-Western cultures such
death-rebirth experiences are part
of the religious tradition
surrounding transitional periods in
a person's life like birth, puberty,
marriage, aging and dying. Ms.
Grof noted that Western culture
presents, "birth, sex and death
taken out of the context of the

sacred."
Dr. Grof called LSD a
"catalyst, amplifier, unspecific
energizer of the system," and
explained that the drug merely
exposes human experiences which
are found in other societies
without the use of drugs being
necessary.
Refering to his own first use of
LSD in Czechoslovakia in 1956,
