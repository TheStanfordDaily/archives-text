# Counting Each Chew Cuts Calories?

### STEPHEN M. KETYER 
Want to lose weight? Why not let your
conscience do the shrinking.
According to Dr. Albert J. Stunkard, chief
of psychiatry at the Medical School, why a
person eats may be more important than
what he eats.
Stunkard has introduced a new four-point
program to treat obesity focusing on the
factors that stimulate eating. His program is
not the traditional diet and exercise program
physicians have prescribed for years.
Instead it is designed to make the patients
aware of their eating habits by keeping
diaries of the amount, time and
circumstances of their eating. These times
and places might be termed "discriminatory
stimuli which signal eating," he said.
Change Habits
Under Stunkard's plan, patients are also
urged to change their behavior habits in
eating speed by counting each mouthful of
food eaten during a meal and by placing
utensils down after every third mouthful
until that mouthful is chewed and swallowed.
Stunkhard and his colleagues believe
environmental factors play a large role in
promoting excessive eating. The effort to
recognize and control various stimuli is

essential to the success of the program, he
said.
For example, after two weeks of
record-keeping, a 30-year-old housewife
recognized that anger stimulated her eating.
After that, whenever she began to get angry,
she left the kitchen and wrote down how she
felt. When she finished, her anger was
subsided and her urge to eat was aborted.
In an article titled "New Therapies for
Eating Disorders," Stunkard notes that in
. . standard medicine's
authoritarian-physician-dependent patient
relationship," the patient loses weight to
please the doctor.
Environmental Problems
Failure to deal with the environmental
problems therefore, leaves the patient
vulnerable to external stimulus and
regression, according to the psychiatrist.
Before they are allowed to enter
Stunkhard's program, patients are screened
for emotional stability. Those with
overwhelming emotional problems would
probably require more individualized services
than the program affords, Stunkhard notes.
According to Dr. Jo Ellen Werne, chief
resident of psychiatry, about 50 percent of

the 60 people enrolled in the program have
succeeded in making the behavioral changes
necessary to lose weight. Another 25 percent
have begun to show signs of change. The rest
fall to attrition.
Werne pointed out that patients must take
it upon themselves to follow through and
make the program work.
> Slow, Frustrating Process
In this program, patients only lose one or
two pounds a week â€” a slow and sometimes
frustrating process, according to Stunkard.
To counter this frustration, groups of six to
10 meet once a week to record their progress
and to encourage each other, he said.
The chief problem with his program has
been Medical Center's inability to
accommodate the large number of applicants,
Stunkard said. He blamed financial
difficulties for this problem.
The program, however, is becoming more
and more wide-spread throughout the
country.
At the American Medical Association
convention held in Chicago last week,
Stunkard reported that about 1,500 obese
persons had tried behavior modification in
the United States.
