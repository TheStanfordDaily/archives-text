# Gays Want Better Medical Care
## 
### KAREN LACHENAUER 
Former New York City Health
Commissioner Howard Brown
charged Friday that the health
needs of gays are not being met
adequately by the medical
profession.
Speaking in a panel discussion
on "Health Concerns and Gay
People" in the Women's
Clubhouse during Gay Pride
Week, Brown urged separatism in
health care for gay and
heterosexual people.
Many doctors and service
workers are "astonishingly" naive
and intolerant regarding

homosexuality, he said.
Consequently, homosexuals seek
help from gay professionals,
according to Brown, now a
professor of public health at New
York University.
Brown said that in touring the
country, he has seen gay
counseling centers as the most
common outgrowth of "the
distrust homosexuals have for
organized mental health
profession."
Cowell Health Center
Psychiatrist James Paulsen
objected to the idea that
institutions such as Cowell could

not be "restaffed, reeducated, and
refunctionalized" to handle
homosexual problems rather than
duplicating minority services.
He said both Cowell and gay
services should be equipped to
counsel individuals of all sexual
bents.
Jim Stoll of San Francisco
Family Services agreed that
"separatism is not in the long run
desirable, but it may be necessary
for change."
Another participant, U.C.
Medical Center psychiatrist lan
Barlow, likened the homosexual
stance to that of black militants.

"I am committed to working
within the University of California
system," he said, "but starting out
separate leads to more self
respect, as in the civil rights
movement."
The health specialists named
some of the distinctions facing
homosexuals in health care:
—homosexuals in intensive care
units may be prevented from
seeing their lovers if only
immediate family members are
admitted. This can be a
"traumatic experience" when the
patient is dying;
—gays treated for drug abuse
may be required by the treatment
agency to give up both drugs and
their homosexuality;
—in San Francisco, the
proportion of homosexuals
admitted to hospitals for
alcoholism equals that of
heterosexuals, but is less for drug
problems.
All meeting participants
observed a dire lack of
understanding of homosexuality
among members of the health
profession. "The police do a
better job of educating their
members about gayness than
medical schools do," said Brown.
Gay People's Union (GPU)
Chairperson Richard Lewis
outlined the Gay Community of
Concern, a "center without
walls."
The center, which opened
yesterday and operates out of the
Old Firehouse, refers homosexuals
from the two counties and the
campus to public and private
health services and offers peer
counseling, crisis intervention and
rap groups.
"But the biggest contribution
you can make is to offer a visible,
multipurpose service," said
Brown.
