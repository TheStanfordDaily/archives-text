# Chace Stresses 'Grotesqueries' In Art, Literature

From the photograph of two
obese, insane women dancing on a
lawn to that of a grenade-carrying
little boy in a park, Asst. English
Prof. William Chace presented his
view of the "grotesqueries" of

current American art and
literature in a lecture last Thursday.
Chace saw the "grotesque" as a
theme in contemporary art and
literature that is the result of "a
feeling of staleness and disgust"
about our time.

To illustrate his thesis he cited
the work of several well-known
poets of our day: T.S. Eliot, Ezra
Pound, Sylvia Plath and Allen
Ginsberg.
Chace began his lecture by
showing a painting by the

eighteenth-century artist, Gilbert
Stuart, entitled "The Skater."
"The painting depicts," said
Chace, "a young man with
composure, equanimity,
self-possession and integrity."
In conjunction with Stuart,
Chace showed four paintings by
the nineteenth-century artist,
Thomas Cole: "Childhood,"
"Youth," "Manhood " and "Old
Age."
"They would be considered
'corny' today," Chace said.
However, he pointed out that the
man portrayed, "although lonely,
was engulfed in the surrounding
ambiance of a sane world." The
angel seen in each of the paintings
is the "guiding force" in his life.
Chace then argued that
American artists of the twentieth
century see life as more grotesque
than before. "The paintings of
Edward Hopper," he said, "show
a clean, well-lighted place, but it is
a stale existence. It is vacant,
although the light pours in."
Of Walker Evans' dreary
photographs depicting an
Alabama farmer and his family,
Chace said, "they are the
photographic equivalents of the
poetry of Sylvia Plath: horrid,
showing no solicitude or

compassion; they are compulsive
and anxious."
Chace read one of Plath's
poems in which she bitterly
complains of how tired she is of
being a woman and of the
demands which the society makes
of her.
Moving away from"the
grotesque" for a moment, Chace
showed a picture of what he
called "a distinctly American
family," seated around the dinner
table about to enjoy a
Thanksgiving feast. The crowd of
250 broke out in laughter.
"Norman Rockwell,"
explained the speaker, "appeals to
the philistine heart in us." But
"Rockwell is dishonest,"
maintained Chace. "He depicts a
world that doesn't exist."
Chace found a more truthful
rendition of American life in the
works of Diane Arbus, a one-time
fashion photographer who later
in her life turned to photography
of a more bizarre nature.
The leering smile of "Woman
with a Veil;" the semi-nude Carol
Doda, finger under breast; and the
raunchy New York burlesque
queen, all left the audience in
gloomy silence.

"Norman Rockwell,"
explained the speaker, "appeals to
the philistine heart in us." But
"Rockwell is dishonest,"
maintained Chace. "He depicts a
world that doesn't exist."
Chace found a more truthful
rendition of American life in the
works of Diane Arbus, a one-time
fashion photographer who later
in her life turned to photography
of a more bizarre nature.
The leering smile of "Woman
with a Veil;" the semi-nude Carol
Doda, finger under breast; and the
raunchy New York burlesque
queen, all left the audience in
gloomy silence.
From the photograph of two
obese, insane women dancing on a
lawn to that of a grenade-carrying
little boy in a park, Asst. English
Prof. William Chace presented his
view of the "grotesqueries" of

current American art and
literature in a lecture last Thursday.
Chace saw the "grotesque" as a
theme in contemporary art and
literature that is the result of "a
feeling of staleness and disgust"
about our time.

To illustrate his thesis he cited
the work of several well-known
poets of our day: T.S. Eliot, Ezra
Pound, Sylvia Plath and Allen
Ginsberg.
Chace began his lecture by
showing a painting by the

eighteenth-century artist, Gilbert
Stuart, entitled "The Skater."
"The painting depicts," said
Chace, "a young man with
composure, equanimity,
self-possession and integrity."
In conjunction with Stuart,
Chace showed four paintings by
the nineteenth-century artist,
Thomas Cole: "Childhood,"
"Youth," "Manhood " and "Old
Age."
"They would be considered
'corny' today," Chace said.
However, he pointed out that the
man portrayed, "although lonely,
was engulfed in the surrounding
ambiance of a sane world." The
angel seen in each of the paintings
is the "guiding force" in his life.
Chace then argued that
American artists of the twentieth
century see life as more grotesque
than before. "The paintings of
Edward Hopper," he said, "show
a clean, well-lighted place, but it is
a stale existence. It is vacant,
although the light pours in."
Of Walker Evans' dreary
photographs depicting an
Alabama farmer and his family,
Chace said, "they are the
photographic equivalents of the
poetry of Sylvia Plath: horrid,
showing no solicitude or

compassion; they are compulsive
and anxious."
Chace read one of Plath's
poems in which she bitterly
complains of how tired she is of
being a woman and of the
demands which the society makes
of her.
Moving away from"the
grotesque" for a moment, Chace
showed a picture of what he
called "a distinctly American
family," seated around the dinner
table about to enjoy a
Thanksgiving feast. The crowd of
250 broke out in laughter.

explained the speaker, "appeals to
the philistine heart in us." But
