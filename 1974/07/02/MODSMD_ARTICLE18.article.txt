# 'That's Entertainment'
## MGM's Mad Musicals 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
If the triple travelling time step
isn't your thing and you don't get
off on the classic insanity of
Nelson Eddy singing "When I'm
calling you, oo oo 00, oo oo oo,"
to Jeannette Mac Donald, you
aren't going to like That's
Entertainment and there's nothing
that can be done to save you, you
poor misbegotten child of the
seventies.
For those on the other hand
who aren't afraid to break away

from the violence-sex tradition of
our troubled times, here's your
chance to see some of the most
treasured moments in cinema
history.
There's adolescent Judy
Garland singing "You Made Me
Love You" as she writes a fan
letter to Clark Gable. Maurice
Chevalier sings 'Thank Heaven
For Little Girls" in Gigi\ from the
same film comes Louis Jourdan
suavely delivering the title song on
the streets of Paris.

This collection of MGM's
musical madness from 1929 to
1958 has been skillfully put
together by Jack Haley, Jr., and
the generation gap is successfully
bridged through the commentary
of Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby,
Gene Kelley, Peter Lawford, Liza
Minnelli, Donald O'Connor,
Debbie Reynolds, Mickey
Rooney, Frank Sinatra, James
Stewart and Elizabeth Taylor.
Each of the 11 hosts tells how
he became involved with MGM,
and then narrates a portion of the
collection of clips. Quite
appropriately, the two master
choreographers Astaire and Kelley
narrate those portions of the film
which deal with the other dancer's
work, and Minnelli narrates the
tribute to her mother, Judy
Garland.
This reviewer's only quarrel'
with two and a half hours of
delight is that the climax, the
ballet from An American In Paris,
is not the great masterpiece it's
billed to be. Donald O'Connor's
great comic dance, "Make 'Em
Laugh" from Singin' In The Rain
is probably the best character
dance ever filmed, and should
have been given top honors.

ON THE TOWN—That's where these two high steppin' sailors are
heading, and that's the title of this classic musical starring Frank
Sinatra and Gene Kelley. Both of these gentlemen appear as hosts and
performers in MGM's recently released collection of the best of the
Hollywood musicals, That's Entertainment. As one reviewer put it,"It
certainly is."
