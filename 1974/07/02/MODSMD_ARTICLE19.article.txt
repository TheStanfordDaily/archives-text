# 'Sequoia' Gives Diverse Literature
## 
### SCOTT TUROW 
The summer issue of Sequoia
seems to take upon itself the task
of displaying the poetry and
fiction of Stanford writers who
are in various stages of
development: undergraduate,
faculty member, or graduate
fellow.
While this policy raises
inevitable ethical and critical
questions — is it fair to publish
known writers at the expense of
those who do not have the same
ready opportunity for public
voice? — how does one go about
comparing professionals with
student-writers who do not claim
their work to be fully achieved? —
it seems a reasonable scheme for a
campus enterprise, providing a full
index to the work being done by
the large and productive
community of writers which
exists at Stanford.
Each piece presented seems
admirable in its own terms. By
predisposition perhaps, I prefer
the fiction to the poetry, though
it is appropriate to point out that
two of the stories — those by
John L'Heureux and William
Kittredge — are the work of
professional writers of
considerable reputation.
Art's Misfortune
L'Heureux's "Completed
Work," about the misfortune of
art too much dependent on
ideology, is drum tight. His ear for
contemporary speech is
spectacularly accurate, and the
story moves ahead with classical
precision, complete but always
concentrated in its depiction of
the artist, Venner Martin, and his
antagonist, Sylvia Levin.
Kate Gerity, an undergraduate,
has contributed a story similarly
accomplished. "Hot Day" is
perfectly-pitched in its voice,
clever and winning, though I
wonder if Kate Gerity is as unsure
as I am about precisely what her
character feels in the last
paragraph.
To me, however, the most

intriguing of Sequoia's three
stories is Bill Kittredge's
"Unnecessary Beasts" which deals
with a youngish woman drifting
between two men and the vision
of love each represents. Kittredge,
for a few years now, has been
staking out a territory all his own,
giving up the contemporary battle
over narrative form and
concentrating instead on a novel
rendering of character psychology
while still working within a
conventional framework.
Randomness
Kittredge's fiction revolves
around a seemingly random
edetic association in the minds of
his characters, allowing a
chromatic scale of imagery to take
the place of the more rational,
James-like cerebral process which
has been for most of the century
the standard method of
representing a human being in
thought.
Kittredge's characters are not
so much existentially as
psychologically isolated, unable to
get beyond the fence-work of a
personal iconography which
simultaneously defines a character
and keeps him remote from
others. My only complaint, made
even in vast admiration, is with
Kittredge's sense of external
behavior.
While I'm inevitably compelled
by what happens inside Morgan,
the girl in "Unnecessary Beasts," I
find her actions frequently
suspect, unbelievable. In the
story's opening scene, for
instance, she attaches herself to a
young man she's never seen before
simply by saying to him, "Don't
be so smug."
It is as if, without intending to,
Kittredge haslet his vision of the
surreal landscape of a mind
influence his portrayal of the
conventions of behavior in the
normal, phenomenal world.
State of Resonance
As a reader, I am always less at
ease with poetry than with
fiction. I have no refined sense of

appraisal and I usually find myself
turning blindly to that harp-string
in my chest, judging a poem by
vibration. The piece which left me
in the greatest state of resonance
was Ted Hars' "Things Fall Apart
and Betray Us."
It is a modest poem, almost
sweet, and I liked especially its
directness and the naturalness of
language it maintained in its
opening stanza, despite the tight
scheme of internal rhymes.
Things fall apart and betray us:
chairs, the John,
the pilot light; one day the toaster
spits us
across the room; the brakes or
radar
fail, and we zoom into a stranger's
orchard.
Later, there is a departure into
mythic metaphors which seem too
grand for the poem's intentions
but are resolved in the last lines.
A longer and more difficult
poem, Rob Weston's "To Avatar
Meher Baba" is full of mind, even
if it seems a little cold to touch.
Weston's poems are smartly
crafted, all poised and neatly
phrased. "Dead Letter," the most
immediately available, evokes
with understated precision the

rears of a longing spirit in the
material world.
Difficult Imagery
Other poems in the magazine
were not as satisfying to me. I lost
hold of Lynn Goldman's "Cain's
Daughter," unable to work my
way through its imagery, and
Venetia Gleason's language in
"Minotaurs" seemed often
strained.
Nonetheless, there is not a
poem in Sequoia that is without
some success. Leslie Campbell's
"Chagall's Palm" moves deftly
along that primal edge where
sound and imagery merge, and
Mark Effron's poems are
wonderfully lucid, though perhaps
the limits which he sets out for
himself are a bit too narrow.
To return to where I started, I
think this magazine is worth a

buck and the time it takes to
contemplate its contents.
Finally, my one unleavened
complaint: when will the
Sequoia's sizeable editorial board
take upon itself the dull but
absolutely indispensable task of
correcting the page proofs for its
publication? The magazine is full
of typos, and for the second
quarter running, a short story is
made nearly incomprehensible
due to shoddy proofreading.
In "Completed Work," perhaps
the single most important line of
dialogue, Venner's "Get out" on
page 18, appears without opening
quotation marks. If Sequoia by
design, cannot confer upon all its
authors professional status, then
the least it can grant them is the
right to be understood as they
meant to be.

between two men and the vision
of love each represents. Kittredge,
for a few years now, has been
staking out a territory all his own,
giving up the contemporary battle
over narrative form and
concentrating instead on a novel
rendering of character psychology
while still working within a
conventional framework.
Randomness
Kittredge's fiction revolves
around a seemingly random
edetic association in the minds of
his characters, allowing a
chromatic scale of imagery to take
the place of the more rational,
James-like cerebral process which
has been for most of the century
the standard method of
representing a human being in
thought.
Kittredge's characters are not
so much existentially as
psychologically isolated, unable to
get beyond the fence-work of a
personal iconography which
simultaneously defines a character
and keeps him remote from
others. My only complaint, made
even in vast admiration, is with
Kittredge's sense of external
behavior.
While I'm inevitably compelled
by what happens inside Morgan,
the girl in "Unnecessary Beasts," I
find her actions frequently
suspect, unbelievable. In the
story's opening scene, for
instance, she attaches herself to a
young man she's never seen before
simply by saying to him, "Don't
be so smug."
It is as if, without intending to,
Kittredge haslet his vision of the
surreal landscape of a mind
influence his portrayal of the
conventions of behavior in the
normal, phenomenal world.
State of Resonance
As a reader, I am always less at
ease with poetry than with
fiction. I have no refined sense of

appraisal and I usually find myself
turning blindly to that harp-string
in my chest, judging a poem by
vibration. The piece which left me
in the greatest state of resonance
was Ted Hars' "Things Fall Apart
and Betray Us."
It is a modest poem, almost
sweet, and I liked especially its
directness and the naturalness of
language it maintained in its
opening stanza, despite the tight
scheme of internal rhymes.
Things fall apart and betray us:
chairs, the John,
the pilot light; one day the toaster
spits us
across the room; the brakes or
radar
fail, and we zoom into a stranger's
orchard.
Later, there is a departure into
mythic metaphors which seem too
grand for the poem's intentions
but are resolved in the last lines.
A longer and more difficult
poem, Rob Weston's "To Avatar
Meher Baba" is full of mind, even
if it seems a little cold to touch.
Weston's poems are smartly
crafted, all poised and neatly
phrased. "Dead Letter," the most
immediately available, evokes
with understated precision the

rears of a longing spirit in the
material world.
Difficult Imagery
Other poems in the magazine
were not as satisfying to me. I lost
hold of Lynn Goldman's "Cain's
Daughter," unable to work my
way through its imagery, and
Venetia Gleason's language in
"Minotaurs" seemed often
strained.
Nonetheless, there is not a
poem in Sequoia that is without
some success. Leslie Campbell's
"Chagall's Palm" moves deftly
along that primal edge where
sound and imagery merge, and
Mark Effron's poems are
wonderfully lucid, though perhaps
the limits which he sets out for
himself are a bit too narrow.
To return to where I started, I
think this magazine is worth a

buck and the time it takes to
contemplate its contents.
Finally, my one unleavened
complaint: when will the
Sequoia's sizeable editorial board
take upon itself the dull but
absolutely indispensable task of
correcting the page proofs for its
publication? The magazine is full
of typos, and for the second
quarter running, a short story is
made nearly incomprehensible
due to shoddy proofreading.
In "Completed Work," perhaps
the single most important line of
dialogue, Venner's "Get out" on
page 18, appears without opening
quotation marks. If Sequoia by
design, cannot confer upon all its
authors professional status, then
the least it can grant them is the
right to be understood as they
meant to be.
The summer issue of Sequoia
seems to take upon itself the task
of displaying the poetry and
fiction of Stanford writers who
are in various stages of
development: undergraduate,
faculty member, or graduate
fellow.
While this policy raises
inevitable ethical and critical
questions — is it fair to publish
known writers at the expense of
those who do not have the same
ready opportunity for public
voice? — how does one go about
comparing professionals with
student-writers who do not claim
their work to be fully achieved? —
it seems a reasonable scheme for a
campus enterprise, providing a full
index to the work being done by
the large and productive
community of writers which
exists at Stanford.
Each piece presented seems
admirable in its own terms. By
predisposition perhaps, I prefer
the fiction to the poetry, though
it is appropriate to point out that
two of the stories — those by
John L'Heureux and William
Kittredge — are the work of
professional writers of
considerable reputation.
Art's Misfortune
L'Heureux's "Completed
Work," about the misfortune of
art too much dependent on
ideology, is drum tight. His ear for
contemporary speech is
spectacularly accurate, and the
story moves ahead with classical
precision, complete but always
concentrated in its depiction of
the artist, Venner Martin, and his
antagonist, Sylvia Levin.
Kate Gerity, an undergraduate,
has contributed a story similarly
accomplished. "Hot Day" is
perfectly-pitched in its voice,
clever and winning, though I
wonder if Kate Gerity is as unsure
as I am about precisely what her
character feels in the last
paragraph.
To me, however, the most

intriguing of Sequoia's three
stories is Bill Kittredge's
"Unnecessary Beasts" which deals
with a youngish woman drifting
between two men and the vision
of love each represents. Kittredge,

and Betray Us."
It is a modest poem, almost
sweet, and I liked especially its
directness and the naturalness of
language it maintained in its
opening stanza, despite the tight
scheme of internal rhymes.
Things fall apart and betray us:
chairs, the John,
the pilot light; one day the toaster
spits us
across the room; the brakes or
radar
fail, and we zoom into a stranger's
orchard.
Later, there is a departure into
mythic metaphors which seem too
grand for the poem's intentions
but are resolved in the last lines.
A longer and more difficult
poem, Rob Weston's "To Avatar
Meher Baba" is full of mind, even
if it seems a little cold to touch.
Weston's poems are smartly
crafted, all poised and neatly
phrased. "Dead Letter," the most
immediately available, evokes
with understated precision the

rears of a longing spirit in the
material world.
Difficult Imagery
Other poems in the magazine
were not as satisfying to me. I lost
hold of Lynn Goldman's "Cain's
Daughter," unable to work my
way through its imagery, and
Venetia Gleason's language in
"Minotaurs" seemed often
strained.
Nonetheless, there is not a
poem in Sequoia that is without
some success. Leslie Campbell's
"Chagall's Palm" moves deftly
along that primal edge where
sound and imagery merge, and
Mark Effron's poems are
wonderfully lucid, though perhaps
the limits which he sets out for
himself are a bit too narrow.
To return to where I started, I
think this magazine is worth a

buck and the time it takes to
contemplate its contents.
Finally, my one unleavened
complaint: when will the
Sequoia's sizeable editorial board
take upon itself the dull but
absolutely indispensable task of
correcting the page proofs for its
publication? The magazine is full
of typos, and for the second
quarter running, a short story is
made nearly incomprehensible
due to shoddy proofreading.
In "Completed Work," perhaps
the single most important line of
dialogue, Venner's "Get out" on
page 18, appears without opening
quotation marks. If Sequoia by
design, cannot confer upon all its
authors professional status, then
the least it can grant them is the
right to be understood as they
meant to be.
The summer issue of Sequoia
seems to take upon itself the task
of displaying the poetry and
fiction of Stanford writers who
are in various stages of
development: undergraduate,
faculty member, or graduate
fellow.
While this policy raises
inevitable ethical and critical
questions — is it fair to publish
known writers at the expense of
those who do not have the same
ready opportunity for public
voice? — how does one go about
comparing professionals with
student-writers who do not claim
their work to be fully achieved? —
it seems a reasonable scheme for a
campus enterprise, providing a full
index to the work being done by
the large and productive
community of writers which
exists at Stanford.
Each piece presented seems
admirable in its own terms. By
predisposition perhaps, I prefer
the fiction to the poetry, though
it is appropriate to point out that
two of the stories — those by
John L'Heureux and William
Kittredge — are the work of
professional writers of
considerable reputation.
Art's Misfortune
L'Heureux's "Completed
Work," about the misfortune of
art too much dependent on
ideology, is drum tight. His ear for
contemporary speech is
spectacularly accurate, and the
story moves ahead with classical
precision, complete but always
concentrated in its depiction of
the artist, Venner Martin, and his
antagonist, Sylvia Levin.
Kate Gerity, an undergraduate,
has contributed a story similarly
accomplished. "Hot Day" is
perfectly-pitched in its voice,
clever and winning, though I
wonder if Kate Gerity is as unsure
as I am about precisely what her
character feels in the last
paragraph.
To me, however, the most

intriguing of Sequoia's three
stories is Bill Kittredge's
"Unnecessary Beasts" which deals
with a youngish woman drifting
between two men and the vision
of love each represents. Kittredge,
for a few years now, has been
staking out a territory all his own,
giving up the contemporary battle
over narrative form and
concentrating instead on a novel
rendering of character psychology
while still working within a
conventional framework.
Randomness
Kittredge's fiction revolves
around a seemingly random
edetic association in the minds of
his characters, allowing a
chromatic scale of imagery to take
the place of the more rational,
James-like cerebral process which
has been for most of the century
the standard method of
representing a human being in
thought.
Kittredge's characters are not
so much existentially as
psychologically isolated, unable to
get beyond the fence-work of a
personal iconography which
simultaneously defines a character
and keeps him remote from
others. My only complaint, made
even in vast admiration, is with
Kittredge's sense of external
behavior.
While I'm inevitably compelled
by what happens inside Morgan,
the girl in "Unnecessary Beasts," I
find her actions frequently
suspect, unbelievable. In the
story's opening scene, for
instance, she attaches herself to a
young man she's never seen before
simply by saying to him, "Don't
be so smug."
It is as if, without intending to,
Kittredge haslet his vision of the
surreal landscape of a mind
influence his portrayal of the
conventions of behavior in the
normal, phenomenal world.
State of Resonance
As a reader, I am always less at
ease with poetry than with
fiction. I have no refined sense of

appraisal and I usually find myself
turning blindly to that harp-string
in my chest, judging a poem by
vibration. The piece which left me
in the greatest state of resonance
was Ted Hars' "Things Fall Apart
and Betray Us."
It is a modest poem, almost
sweet, and I liked especially its
directness and the naturalness of
language it maintained in its
