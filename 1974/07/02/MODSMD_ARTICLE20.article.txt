Brownsville Station
School Punks
Big Tree BT 89500
Ever since their first album,
Brownsville Station has cultivated
the punk rock image. Lead singer
Cub Koda wants to get out and
bust his buns every time he climbs
on stage, although live his
overly-frenetic posturing generates
more sweat and noise than
anything else.
But the group's last two
albums for Big Tree records have
controlled this excess freneticism,
and allowed the better side of the
group to come through. School
Punks, the second album on the
Big Tree label, is full of the kind
of songs Chuck Berry wais singing
about school days 15 years ago.
Of the 10 tunes, 6 are originals by
Koda and bassist Sam Lutz, and 4
are from other sources.
Among the usual songs about
clandestine meetings and horny
boys and girls that party with the
football team, are an acoustic
number that's a refreshing change

of pace, and another song, "Kings
of the Party," that speaks to the
group's sudden success.
School Punks is nothing
different for Brownsville Station,
but what they do, they do very
well, showing there's still
something left to extract from the
well-mined vein of school
experiences.

Tangerine Dream
Phaedra
Virgin VR 13-108
The ads for this record show a
melting phone, radio and
turntable, suggesting "music that
melts." Actually, it's closer to
German space rock, which can be
gotten to by taking a left at Pink
Floyd and twisting and turning
through various exotic keyboard
instruments.
Phaedra is the product of a
German trio that is quite popular
in Europe and England, but
virtually unknown in the U.S.,
due to, as their publicity matter
says, "business problems."
But with these problems under
control, Tangerine Dream is now
making an attempt at the
American market. This first U.S.
album shows them to be masters
of the Moog, mellotron and the
spaced-out orchestral sound.

There are oftly four numbers on
the record, with sounds ranging
from symphonic to simple heavy
breathing, and just about anything
in between that a synthesizer can
do.
Phaedra is sort of a sensuous
space-warp for the mind, for those
late evenings when you're tired of
lush soul and hard-edged rock and
roll. If you don't know what a
synthesizer is, Tangerine Dream
will demonstrate for your ears. If
you don't care, why have you
read this far?

Brownsville Station
School Punks
Big Tree BT 89500
Ever since their first album,
Brownsville Station has cultivated
the punk rock image. Lead singer
Cub Koda wants to get out and
bust his buns every time he climbs
on stage, although live his
overly-frenetic posturing generates
more sweat and noise than
anything else.
But the group's last two
albums for Big Tree records have
controlled this excess freneticism,
and allowed the better side of the
group to come through. School
Punks, the second album on the
Big Tree label, is full of the kind
of songs Chuck Berry wais singing
about school days 15 years ago.
Of the 10 tunes, 6 are originals by
Koda and bassist Sam Lutz, and 4
are from other sources.
Among the usual songs about
clandestine meetings and horny
boys and girls that party with the
football team, are an acoustic
number that's a refreshing change

of pace, and another song, "Kings
of the Party," that speaks to the
group's sudden success.
School Punks is nothing
different for Brownsville Station,
but what they do, they do very
well, showing there's still
something left to extract from the
well-mined vein of school
experiences.

Tangerine Dream
Phaedra
Virgin VR 13-108
The ads for this record show a
melting phone, radio and
turntable, suggesting "music that
melts." Actually, it's closer to
German space rock, which can be
gotten to by taking a left at Pink
Floyd and twisting and turning
through various exotic keyboard
instruments.
Phaedra is the product of a
German trio that is quite popular
in Europe and England, but
virtually unknown in the U.S.,
due to, as their publicity matter
says, "business problems."
But with these problems under
control, Tangerine Dream is now
making an attempt at the
American market. This first U.S.
album shows them to be masters
of the Moog, mellotron and the
spaced-out orchestral sound.

There are oftly four numbers on
the record, with sounds ranging
from symphonic to simple heavy
breathing, and just about anything
in between that a synthesizer can
do.
Phaedra is sort of a sensuous
space-warp for the mind, for those
late evenings when you're tired of
lush soul and hard-edged rock and
roll. If you don't know what a
synthesizer is, Tangerine Dream
will demonstrate for your ears. If
you don't care, why have you
read this far?
