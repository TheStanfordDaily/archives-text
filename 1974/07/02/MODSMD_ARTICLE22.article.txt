# Tony Joe White Wailin'

### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO — Tony Joe White is probably best known
for his 1969 hit single hit "Polk Salad Annie." Few people realize
that it was he who wrote Elvis Presley's recent hit "I've Got A
Thing About You Baby," and Brook Benton's beautiful ballad
"Rainy Night In Georgia," which was nominated for a Grammy.
Still fewer people know what a Tony Joe White concert is all
about, especially on the West Coast. Tony Joe has been touring as
a solo artist for the past two years, a marked change from his
usual studio surroundings which have often included horns and
string sections.
Tony Joe has only been satisfied with his last two LPs, but he
hopes his next will be a solo, live session. "I'd just like to get
some place where the feeling's good, and cut it."
The feeling was definitely good at the Great American Music
Hall Tuesday night, June 18, for Tony Joe's one-night-only
appearance.
Tony Joe's style alternates between light, easy-going folk songs
and his very own "swamp music," sort of a rural soul music. For
the different moods he would switch from acoustic to electric
guitar, and occasionally play harmonica on a neck harness.
The first set began with "300 Pounds of Hongry," which has
become one of Tony Joe's most requested numbers, usually
making it necessary for him to play it twice a gig.
Like most of Tony Joe's songs, the lyrics were simple and
straightforward: "I don't care if you weighs a ton J 'Long as I can
butter your buns."
Tony Joe seemed more than pleased to comply with requests
from the audience, and played tunes spanning all six of his LPs,
including "Even Trolls Love Rock 'N' Roll," "Roosevelt and Ira
Lee," and of course "Polk Salad Annie," which he dedicated to
the San Francisco area for having been the first to pick up on it.
Perhaps his best electric selection was "As the Crow Flies,"
from The Train I'm On.
The acoustic numbers were the real standouts, though,
especially "Willie and Laura Mae Jones," "Rainy Night in
Georgia," and "For 01' Times Sake":
The years we had were not all bad,
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
But, now you say that you've grown tired,
And want to be by yourself a while.
Well, it would be a shame if you go,
And find that fate was a long time ago.
The second set ended with Tony Joe bringing up the opening
act, the Alice Cooper Band, for a jam which included a vocal duet
on Jimmy Reed's "Baby What You Want Me To Do."
Blues is a big influence on Tony Joe, who was raised in
Louisiana and Texas. Shades of Slim Harpo, Jimmy Reed, and
John Lee Hooker often shine through in his singing and guitar
picking.
But, Tony Joe's biggest guitar influence has been Lightnin'
Hopkins. "I started out listening to Lightnin', and I guess I
finished up with Lightnin', too."

finished up with Lightnin', too."
SAN FRANCISCO — Tony Joe White is probably best known
for his 1969 hit single hit "Polk Salad Annie." Few people realize
that it was he who wrote Elvis Presley's recent hit "I've Got A
Thing About You Baby," and Brook Benton's beautiful ballad
"Rainy Night In Georgia," which was nominated for a Grammy.
Still fewer people know what a Tony Joe White concert is all
about, especially on the West Coast. Tony Joe has been touring as
a solo artist for the past two years, a marked change from his
usual studio surroundings which have often included horns and
string sections.
Tony Joe has only been satisfied with his last two LPs, but he
hopes his next will be a solo, live session. "I'd just like to get
some place where the feeling's good, and cut it."
The feeling was definitely good at the Great American Music
Hall Tuesday night, June 18, for Tony Joe's one-night-only
appearance.
Tony Joe's style alternates between light, easy-going folk songs
and his very own "swamp music," sort of a rural soul music. For
the different moods he would switch from acoustic to electric
guitar, and occasionally play harmonica on a neck harness.
The first set began with "300 Pounds of Hongry," which has
become one of Tony Joe's most requested numbers, usually
making it necessary for him to play it twice a gig.
Like most of Tony Joe's songs, the lyrics were simple and
straightforward: "I don't care if you weighs a ton J 'Long as I can
butter your buns."
Tony Joe seemed more than pleased to comply with requests
from the audience, and played tunes spanning all six of his LPs,
including "Even Trolls Love Rock 'N' Roll," "Roosevelt and Ira
Lee," and of course "Polk Salad Annie," which he dedicated to
the San Francisco area for having been the first to pick up on it.
Perhaps his best electric selection was "As the Crow Flies,"
from The Train I'm On.
The acoustic numbers were the real standouts, though,
especially "Willie and Laura Mae Jones," "Rainy Night in
Georgia," and "For 01' Times Sake":
The years we had were not all bad,
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
But, now you say that you've grown tired,
And want to be by yourself a while.
Well, it would be a shame if you go,
And find that fate was a long time ago.
The second set ended with Tony Joe bringing up the opening
act, the Alice Cooper Band, for a jam which included a vocal duet
on Jimmy Reed's "Baby What You Want Me To Do."
Blues is a big influence on Tony Joe, who was raised in
Louisiana and Texas. Shades of Slim Harpo, Jimmy Reed, and
John Lee Hooker often shine through in his singing and guitar
picking.
But, Tony Joe's biggest guitar influence has been Lightnin'
Hopkins. "I started out listening to Lightnin', and I guess I
finished up with Lightnin', too."
