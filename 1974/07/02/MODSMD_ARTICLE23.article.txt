# Watson, Tanner Score Triumphs
## 
### 
The past few days have been fruitful ones for two ex-Stanford stars
who suddenly find themselves propelled to the top rungs of stardom
in their games.
Tom Watson, 24, won his first professional golf tournament
Sunday, the Western Open in Oak Brook, Illinois. Watson, a 1971
graduate, won $40,000 in the prestigious tournament, upping his total
winnings to over $126,000 for the year.
The victory ended Watson's "streak" of losing rich tournaments in
the final round. He led the 1973 World and Hawaiian Opens and was
tied for the lead of the 1974 U.S. Open after three rounds, but each
time blew the lead in the clutch.
Sunday, it was different. Watson carded a final-round 69 to
overcome a six-shot deficit against Tom Weiskopf, who choked to a
77.
Yesterday, Roscoe Tanner, who last played for Stanford's tennis
team in 1972, shocked doubles partner Arthur Ashe in the third
round at Wimbledon, the world's most famous net tourney.
Tanner defeated Ashe 7-5, 6-3, 7-9, 6-3. The big lefthander from
Lookout Mountain, Tennessee, overpowered Ashe, himself a "big
game" player, with devestating serves.
The match, played outdoors, was plagued by gusty winds which
threw Ashe off more than Tanner. The two players are doubles
partners on the World Championship Tennis tour.
Saturday, another ex-Stanford player, Sandy Mayer, was bopped
out of the tournament by a player of whom most American tennis
fans had never heard.
Holland's Rolf Thung beat Mayer 9-7, 6-2, 6-3. Last season, Mayer
reached the Wimbledon semifinals by beating Ilie Nastase of Rumania,
one of the world's top three players.

medal play, but lost in the first round of match play.
