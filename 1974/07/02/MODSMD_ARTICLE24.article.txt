# Hencken, Bruner Win At S.C.
## 
### 
Mike Bruner and John
Hencken, the two swimmers
expected to lead Stanford to
aquatic success in 1975, won a
total of five first places at the
Santa Clara International
Invitational Swimming and Diving
Meet, which concluded Sunday.
The Santa Clara meet is
considered one of the toughest in
the world.
Bruner, an incoming freshman

from Stockton, won the 1500 and
400 meter freestyles and the
400-yard individual medley while
swimming for the DeAnza Swim
Club.
Bruner won the 400 free in
4:03.76, the 400 IM in 4:39.21
and the 1500 free in 16:03.84. He
set meet records in both freestyle
races and was the only triple
winner in the event.
Hencken, a 1972 Olympic gold
medalist, set meet records in
winning two events. In the 200
breast, he swam a 2:24.62, while
in the 100 breast, he won in
1:05.31.
In both races, he topped
longtime rival David Wilkie of
England and the University of
Miami. Hencken, a junior, holds
the world 100 record, Wilkie, the

200 record.
Hencken also took second in
the 200 IM with 2:12.47,
23/100ths of a second behind the
winner.
The star of Stanford's women's
swim team, Vicki Hays, finished
fifth in the 100 breast in 1:18.45.
John Naber, Woodside High
School prodigy who led USC to
the 1974 NCAA swim title, was
typically brilliant at Santa Clara,
winning both the 100 and 200
men's backstrokes. Naber eclipsed
the meet record of East German
superstar Roland Matthes in the
200.
One world record was set at
the meet; Heather Greenwood, a
senior in high school in Fresno,
set the women's 400 free in
4:17.33.
