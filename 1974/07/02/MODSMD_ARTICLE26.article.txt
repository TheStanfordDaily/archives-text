Peron Dies Of Heart Failure
BUENOS AIRES — Argentine President Juan Peron
died yesterday. The 78-year-old leader died of heart and
kidney failure, two days after his widow, Maria Estela
Peron, assumed the position of Acting President.
Mrs. Peron, sobbing, announced the death of her
husband yesterday. A former cabaret dancer known as
Isabel Martinez, the 43-year-old widow becomes the first
woman head of state in the western hemisphere.
Peron ruled Argentina for nine years beginning in 1946.
A strongman who was both hated and loved, he was
ousted in 1955 amidst charges he used his power to enrich
himself and his first wife, Evita.
He spent the next 18 years in exile in Spain, but
returned triumphantly last year with the approval of the
Argentine military. In October, he and his wife were
overwhelmingly elected President and Vice President.
Violence took place at Peron's inauguration as
President. In order to prevent demonstrations at this time,
the federal police force yesterday put into effect an
emergency security plan.
King's Slaying Suspect Arraigned
ATLANTA — A 23-year-old black man, describing
himself as a "Hebrew sent on a mission," was arraigned
yesterday in Atlanta on murder charges after Sunday's
slaying of the mother of the late Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr.
Marcus Wayne Chenault, of Dayton, Ohio, tried to
plead "no contest" to the charges, but was directed to
plead not guilty by Judge William Brock.
Witnesses saw Chenault fire two pistols at Ebenezer
Baptist Church Sunday, killing Mrs. King, 69, and a
deacon, Edward Boykin, 69.
Mrs. King was slain as she played "The Lord's Prayer"
on the organ. Her body will lie in state today at the
Ebenezer Church. Funeral services are set for tomorrow.
Her husband, Martin Luther King Sr., said he
encountered the gunman after the shooting. Asked why he
did it, the man said " 'I came down here to kill my enemies.
All Christians are my enemies,'" according to King.
Yesterday, Chenault said his mission was only partially
accomplished, because, in his lawyer's words, "he still had

not confronted Martin Luther King Sr."
Asked whether he had shot anyone, Chenault said "I
assume that I have."
Atlanta police have discounted the possibility that the
shooting was part of a conspiracy.
Panel Continues Closed Sessions
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee
voted yesterday to conduct its questioning of witnesses in
the impeachment inquiry of President Nixon behind
closed doors.
Presidential adviser Dean Burch said he deplored the
decision to interview 10 witnesses in closed session. The
questioning is set to begin today. Burch said the decision
deprived the public of its right to know what witnesses
said.
Earlier in the day, committee chairman Peter Rodino
agreed to call as witnesses all six persons suggested by
White House lawyer James St. Clair. Rodino had
previously wanted to call only two White House witnesses.
The move was interpreted as a move to get Republican
votes for a move to limit questioning of witnesses to only
committee counsel John Doar, Albert Jenner and St.
Clair.
But Rodino's move failed. The committee decided to
allow each committee member to question each witness.
According to Congressman David Dennis, R-Ind., it would
have been "parliamentary suicide" to suspend the House
rules.
'Plumber' Testifies In Ellsberg Case
WASHINGTON — A member of the White House
"plumbers" unit testified yesterday that former
Presidential aide John Ehrlichman removed three
documents from the file on the break-in at Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office.
David Young, former co-director of the plumbers,
testified at the Ehrlichman trial yesterday that Ehrlichman
removed the documents "because they showed too much
forethought," meaning that they implicated Ehrlichman in
conspiracy to break into the office.
Earlier, Young said that he and Egil Krogh, the other
"plumbers" co-director, met with Ehrlichman early in

August, 1971, to talk about a covert operation against
Ellsberg.
Ehrlichman responded by saying only "let's think
about it," without indicating approval or disapproval,
Young said.
Young testified under immunity at the trial of
Ehrlichman and three others. The prosecution also
yesterday produced a memo from Krogh and Young to
Ehrlichman on which Ehrlichman allegedly initialed his
approval of their recommendation for a "covert
operation."
Arms Pact Goals Decided
MOSCOW — President Nixon and Soviet leaders Leonid
Brezhnev reportedly reached agreement yesterday on goals
they hope to achieve in arms control negotiations later this
year.
The Nixon-Brezhnev summit continues today after the
two leaders took a "working vacation" yesterday in the
White Russian city of Minsk to commemorate its
rebuilding as "hero city," after being devestated during
World War 11.
Nixon, Brezhnev, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
and Soviet Foreign Andre Gromyko are scheduled to be
consulting today about a joint communique the two sides
will issue before Nixon leaves tomorrow.
While the two leaders have reached some understanding
on goals, no breakthrough summit agreement is expected
on this trip. However, the meetings have paved the way for
possible progress at the stalled Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks in Geneva.
Icelandic Prime Minister Resigns
REYKJAVIK, Iceland — Icelandic Prime Minister
Olafur Johannessen yesterday resigned after his
government lost seats in Iceland's general election on
Sunday. Johannessen's minority coalition was defeated by
the opposition Conservative Party, whose representatives
favor retention of a U.S. Naval Base to safeguard that
country's security.

David Young, former co-director of the plumbers,
testified at the Ehrlichman trial yesterday that Ehrlichman
removed the documents "because they showed too much
forethought," meaning that they implicated Ehrlichman in
conspiracy to break into the office.
Earlier, Young said that he and Egil Krogh, the other
"plumbers" co-director, met with Ehrlichman early in

August, 1971, to talk about a covert operation against
Ellsberg.
Ehrlichman responded by saying only "let's think
about it," without indicating approval or disapproval,
Young said.
Young testified under immunity at the trial of
Ehrlichman and three others. The prosecution also
yesterday produced a memo from Krogh and Young to
Ehrlichman on which Ehrlichman allegedly initialed his
approval of their recommendation for a "covert
operation."
Arms Pact Goals Decided
MOSCOW — President Nixon and Soviet leaders Leonid
Brezhnev reportedly reached agreement yesterday on goals
they hope to achieve in arms control negotiations later this
year.
The Nixon-Brezhnev summit continues today after the
two leaders took a "working vacation" yesterday in the
White Russian city of Minsk to commemorate its
rebuilding as "hero city," after being devestated during
World War 11.
Nixon, Brezhnev, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
and Soviet Foreign Andre Gromyko are scheduled to be
consulting today about a joint communique the two sides
will issue before Nixon leaves tomorrow.
While the two leaders have reached some understanding
on goals, no breakthrough summit agreement is expected
on this trip. However, the meetings have paved the way for
possible progress at the stalled Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks in Geneva.
Icelandic Prime Minister Resigns
REYKJAVIK, Iceland — Icelandic Prime Minister
Olafur Johannessen yesterday resigned after his
government lost seats in Iceland's general election on
Sunday. Johannessen's minority coalition was defeated by
the opposition Conservative Party, whose representatives
favor retention of a U.S. Naval Base to safeguard that
country's security.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Highs in the upper 70s to
upper 80s, lows in the low to mid 50s. Northwest winds
10 to 20 miles per hour in the afternoon.
Peron Dies Of Heart Failure
BUENOS AIRES — Argentine President Juan Peron
died yesterday. The 78-year-old leader died of heart and
kidney failure, two days after his widow, Maria Estela
Peron, assumed the position of Acting President.
Mrs. Peron, sobbing, announced the death of her
husband yesterday. A former cabaret dancer known as
Isabel Martinez, the 43-year-old widow becomes the first
woman head of state in the western hemisphere.
Peron ruled Argentina for nine years beginning in 1946.
A strongman who was both hated and loved, he was
ousted in 1955 amidst charges he used his power to enrich
himself and his first wife, Evita.
He spent the next 18 years in exile in Spain, but
returned triumphantly last year with the approval of the
Argentine military. In October, he and his wife were
overwhelmingly elected President and Vice President.
Violence took place at Peron's inauguration as
President. In order to prevent demonstrations at this time,
the federal police force yesterday put into effect an
emergency security plan.
King's Slaying Suspect Arraigned
ATLANTA — A 23-year-old black man, describing
himself as a "Hebrew sent on a mission," was arraigned
yesterday in Atlanta on murder charges after Sunday's
slaying of the mother of the late Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr.
Marcus Wayne Chenault, of Dayton, Ohio, tried to
plead "no contest" to the charges, but was directed to
plead not guilty by Judge William Brock.
Witnesses saw Chenault fire two pistols at Ebenezer
Baptist Church Sunday, killing Mrs. King, 69, and a
deacon, Edward Boykin, 69.
Mrs. King was slain as she played "The Lord's Prayer"
on the organ. Her body will lie in state today at the
Ebenezer Church. Funeral services are set for tomorrow.
Her husband, Martin Luther King Sr., said he
encountered the gunman after the shooting. Asked why he
did it, the man said " 'I came down here to kill my enemies.
All Christians are my enemies,'" according to King.
Yesterday, Chenault said his mission was only partially
accomplished, because, in his lawyer's words, "he still had

not confronted Martin Luther King Sr."
Asked whether he had shot anyone, Chenault said "I
assume that I have."
Atlanta police have discounted the possibility that the
shooting was part of a conspiracy.
Panel Continues Closed Sessions
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee
voted yesterday to conduct its questioning of witnesses in
the impeachment inquiry of President Nixon behind
closed doors.
Presidential adviser Dean Burch said he deplored the
decision to interview 10 witnesses in closed session. The
questioning is set to begin today. Burch said the decision
deprived the public of its right to know what witnesses
said.
Earlier in the day, committee chairman Peter Rodino
agreed to call as witnesses all six persons suggested by
White House lawyer James St. Clair. Rodino had
previously wanted to call only two White House witnesses.
The move was interpreted as a move to get Republican
votes for a move to limit questioning of witnesses to only
committee counsel John Doar, Albert Jenner and St.
Clair.
But Rodino's move failed. The committee decided to
allow each committee member to question each witness.
According to Congressman David Dennis, R-Ind., it would
have been "parliamentary suicide" to suspend the House
rules.

Marcus Wayne Chenault, of Dayton, Ohio, tried to
plead "no contest" to the charges, but was directed to
plead not guilty by Judge William Brock.
Witnesses saw Chenault fire two pistols at Ebenezer
Baptist Church Sunday, killing Mrs. King, 69, and a
deacon, Edward Boykin, 69.
Mrs. King was slain as she played "The Lord's Prayer"
on the organ. Her body will lie in state today at the
Ebenezer Church. Funeral services are set for tomorrow.
Her husband, Martin Luther King Sr., said he
encountered the gunman after the shooting. Asked why he
did it, the man said " 'I came down here to kill my enemies.
All Christians are my enemies,'" according to King.
Yesterday, Chenault said his mission was only partially
accomplished, because, in his lawyer's words, "he still had

not confronted Martin Luther King Sr."
Asked whether he had shot anyone, Chenault said "I
assume that I have."
Atlanta police have discounted the possibility that the
shooting was part of a conspiracy.
Panel Continues Closed Sessions
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee
voted yesterday to conduct its questioning of witnesses in
the impeachment inquiry of President Nixon behind
closed doors.
Presidential adviser Dean Burch said he deplored the
decision to interview 10 witnesses in closed session. The
questioning is set to begin today. Burch said the decision
deprived the public of its right to know what witnesses
said.
Earlier in the day, committee chairman Peter Rodino
agreed to call as witnesses all six persons suggested by
White House lawyer James St. Clair. Rodino had
previously wanted to call only two White House witnesses.
The move was interpreted as a move to get Republican
votes for a move to limit questioning of witnesses to only
committee counsel John Doar, Albert Jenner and St.
Clair.
But Rodino's move failed. The committee decided to
allow each committee member to question each witness.
According to Congressman David Dennis, R-Ind., it would
have been "parliamentary suicide" to suspend the House
rules.
'Plumber' Testifies In Ellsberg Case
WASHINGTON — A member of the White House
"plumbers" unit testified yesterday that former
Presidential aide John Ehrlichman removed three
documents from the file on the break-in at Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office.
David Young, former co-director of the plumbers,
testified at the Ehrlichman trial yesterday that Ehrlichman
removed the documents "because they showed too much
forethought," meaning that they implicated Ehrlichman in
conspiracy to break into the office.
Earlier, Young said that he and Egil Krogh, the other
"plumbers" co-director, met with Ehrlichman early in

August, 1971, to talk about a covert operation against
Ellsberg.
Ehrlichman responded by saying only "let's think
about it," without indicating approval or disapproval,
Young said.
Young testified under immunity at the trial of
Ehrlichman and three others. The prosecution also
yesterday produced a memo from Krogh and Young to
Ehrlichman on which Ehrlichman allegedly initialed his
approval of their recommendation for a "covert
operation."
Arms Pact Goals Decided
MOSCOW — President Nixon and Soviet leaders Leonid
Brezhnev reportedly reached agreement yesterday on goals
they hope to achieve in arms control negotiations later this
year.
The Nixon-Brezhnev summit continues today after the
two leaders took a "working vacation" yesterday in the
White Russian city of Minsk to commemorate its
rebuilding as "hero city," after being devestated during
World War 11.
Nixon, Brezhnev, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
and Soviet Foreign Andre Gromyko are scheduled to be
consulting today about a joint communique the two sides
will issue before Nixon leaves tomorrow.
While the two leaders have reached some understanding
on goals, no breakthrough summit agreement is expected
on this trip. However, the meetings have paved the way for
possible progress at the stalled Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks in Geneva.
Icelandic Prime Minister Resigns
REYKJAVIK, Iceland — Icelandic Prime Minister
Olafur Johannessen yesterday resigned after his
government lost seats in Iceland's general election on
Sunday. Johannessen's minority coalition was defeated by
the opposition Conservative Party, whose representatives
favor retention of a U.S. Naval Base to safeguard that
country's security.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Highs in the upper 70s to
upper 80s, lows in the low to mid 50s. Northwest winds
10 to 20 miles per hour in the afternoon.
Peron Dies Of Heart Failure
BUENOS AIRES — Argentine President Juan Peron
died yesterday. The 78-year-old leader died of heart and
kidney failure, two days after his widow, Maria Estela
Peron, assumed the position of Acting President.
Mrs. Peron, sobbing, announced the death of her
husband yesterday. A former cabaret dancer known as
Isabel Martinez, the 43-year-old widow becomes the first
woman head of state in the western hemisphere.
Peron ruled Argentina for nine years beginning in 1946.
A strongman who was both hated and loved, he was
ousted in 1955 amidst charges he used his power to enrich
himself and his first wife, Evita.
He spent the next 18 years in exile in Spain, but
returned triumphantly last year with the approval of the
Argentine military. In October, he and his wife were
overwhelmingly elected President and Vice President.
Violence took place at Peron's inauguration as
President. In order to prevent demonstrations at this time,
the federal police force yesterday put into effect an
emergency security plan.
King's Slaying Suspect Arraigned
ATLANTA — A 23-year-old black man, describing
himself as a "Hebrew sent on a mission," was arraigned
yesterday in Atlanta on murder charges after Sunday's
slaying of the mother of the late Dr. Martin Luther King
