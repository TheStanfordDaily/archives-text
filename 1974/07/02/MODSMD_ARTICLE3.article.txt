# Summer Enrollment Down 160
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Summer enrollment is down
approximately 160 students from last
summer, according to preliminary figures
from the registrar's office. The decrease
might spell further economic trouble for the
University, already in the red this year.
Administration officials last month
announced a $1.5 million operating budget
deficit for 1973-74, including a $200,000
drop in tuition and fees income as a result of
decreased spring quarter enrollment.
According to a rough estimate by Vice
President for Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger, the summer enrollment drop
might add about $90,000 to that deficit.
According to Assoc. Registrar Robert
Houghton summer registration as of
yesterday stood at 3026 undergraduate and
graduate students. However, Houghton
added, approximately 100 overseas students'
registration hasn't been added in yet, so the
total is actually closer to 3126.
Last Year's Enrollment
Last year at the same point, there were
3286 students registered.

Neither Augsburger nor Houghton
described the drop as serious.
Augsburger described the decline as "not
something of concern on a short-term basis.
It's very possible that we will not meet our
summer enrollment quotas, but that can be
offset by other adjustments. It's always a
speculative thing."
Houghton termed the drop "not that
dramatic," and added that some of the
discrepancy between this summer's total and
last summer's might be made up as graduate
students enroll for programs beginning later
this month.
150 Below Last Summer
However, if he were to predict today,
Houghton added, he would estimate the total
summer enrollment to level off somewhere
near 150 below last summer.
Both Augsburger and Houghton attributed
the enrollment decline to a number of
factors, including the "economic crunch" on
students.
Although summer quarter tuition is a bit
less expensive than that during other
quarters, there is "more a feeling of not

having to go through summer and pick up a
degree" among students now, Houghton said.
Many students simply feel they must work
during the summer months to earn enough to
pay for school during the rest of the year,
Augsburger added.
Long Term Pattern
Augsburger said the enrollment drop is
only significant if it becomes a long-term
pattern.
Houghton commented that there has been
a slow decline in summer registration over
the last 10 years and blamed it on the
introduction of teachers' workshops in state
universities.
The most substantial decline this summer
seems to be in matriculated undergraduates,
he added. The undergraduate figure "has
been going up and down over the last few
years," Houghton said.
Another main area of the drop is
non matriculated graduate students, he said,
but more of these students are expected to
register later this month.

3286 students registered.

Neither Augsburger nor Houghton
described the drop as serious.
Augsburger described the decline as "not
something of concern on a short-term basis.
It's very possible that we will not meet our
summer enrollment quotas, but that can be
offset by other adjustments. It's always a
speculative thing."
Houghton termed the drop "not that
dramatic," and added that some of the
discrepancy between this summer's total and
last summer's might be made up as graduate
students enroll for programs beginning later
this month.
150 Below Last Summer
However, if he were to predict today,
Houghton added, he would estimate the total
summer enrollment to level off somewhere
near 150 below last summer.
Both Augsburger and Houghton attributed
the enrollment decline to a number of
factors, including the "economic crunch" on
students.
Although summer quarter tuition is a bit
less expensive than that during other
quarters, there is "more a feeling of not

having to go through summer and pick up a
degree" among students now, Houghton said.
Many students simply feel they must work
during the summer months to earn enough to
pay for school during the rest of the year,
Augsburger added.
Long Term Pattern
Augsburger said the enrollment drop is
only significant if it becomes a long-term
pattern.
Houghton commented that there has been
a slow decline in summer registration over
the last 10 years and blamed it on the
introduction of teachers' workshops in state
universities.
The most substantial decline this summer
seems to be in matriculated undergraduates,
he added. The undergraduate figure "has
been going up and down over the last few
years," Houghton said.
Another main area of the drop is
non matriculated graduate students, he said,
but more of these students are expected to
register later this month.
Summer enrollment is down
approximately 160 students from last
summer, according to preliminary figures
from the registrar's office. The decrease
might spell further economic trouble for the
University, already in the red this year.
Administration officials last month
announced a $1.5 million operating budget
deficit for 1973-74, including a $200,000
drop in tuition and fees income as a result of
decreased spring quarter enrollment.
According to a rough estimate by Vice
President for Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger, the summer enrollment drop
might add about $90,000 to that deficit.
According to Assoc. Registrar Robert
Houghton summer registration as of
yesterday stood at 3026 undergraduate and
graduate students. However, Houghton
added, approximately 100 overseas students'
registration hasn't been added in yet, so the
total is actually closer to 3126.

Last year at the same point, there were
3286 students registered.
