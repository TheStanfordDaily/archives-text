## Hewlett Resigns As Trustee 
### 
By BRUCE KADDEN
William R. Hewlett, president
of Hewlett-Packard Company, has
resigned from the University's
Board of Trustees. The resignation
was effective yesterday.
Hewlett, who has served on the
32-member board since 1963,
resigned "to have a littel bit more
time to pursue other objectives,"
according to his resignation letter
given to Board President Robert
Minge Brown. Hewlett has also
served on the Mills College Board

of Trustees for 10 years.
Hewlett said yesterday that his
resignation was "an effort to cut
down on outside activities." He
cited his "terribly heavy
schedule," need to spend more
time with his family and doing
corporation-related work as
reasons that led to his decision.
He described his years on the
Stanford Board as "most
gratifying indeed, not always
without trials, but certainly
rewarding in the ultimate

outcome."
Hewlett expressed confidence
in the University and its
administration. "I continue to be
impressed with both the caliber of
leadership that [President] Dick
Lyman is providing to the
University community as well as
the quality of the personnel that
Dick has been able to incorporate
into his administrative team."
Brown expressed deep regret at
losing Hewlett as a member of the
Board, but said he realized that
Hewlett was entitled to direct his
attention to other objectives after
so many years of extraordinary
service to the University.
Lyman described Hewlett as
"an excellent trustee" who "can
grasp difficult problems quickly."
He would ask "excellent questions
of the administration" during the
Board meetings, Lyman said,
adding "I'm sorry to see him go."
Before joining the Board in
19G3, Hewlett served on the
board of directors of Stanford
Hospital for six years.
Hewlett, 59, graduated from
here in 1934. After earning his
Master's of Science degree at
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1936, he returned
here and earned his electrical
engineering degree in 1939.
Hewlett-Packard, the
multi-million dollar electronics
and instrumentation firm of
which Hewlett is president, grew
from a 1939 partnership with his
Stanford classmate David Packard.
Both Hewlett and Packard have
