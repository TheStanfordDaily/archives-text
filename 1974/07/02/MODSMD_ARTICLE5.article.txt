Sign Petition
To the members of the bargaining
unit:
You and I will be required to
contribute one percent of our
wages to USE. This rule is
effective starting the day the
contract was signed. You now
have about 25 days to pay your
first month's "contribution:" If
you don't, you will force the
University to terminate you about
two weeks from the day they give
you notice. This information is
from Mr. Doug Barton, Stanford
University legal advisor and also
from Mr. Rodriguez, an officer of
the National Labor Relations
Board in San Francisco.
Now, what can I do about this?
You and I together can do
something about this! Sign the
petition in Friday's (June 28)
Daily. Send it to SEAU, P.O. Box
2504, Stanford, Calif. 94305.
Once in our possession the names
are held in the strictest
confidence, even through the
NLRB verification process.
Should the petition process gather
one-third of the bargaining unit
members, we will ask the NLRB
to set an election date.
The question on the ballot will
be for only one thing — do you
want to eliminate the agency shop
clause in the USE-University
contract. Hell, yes! Once this is
eliminated you will not be fired
for not paying your contribution
to USE.

Inside/Out
Over 20,000 California state
prisoners enjoy receiving mail.
Mail often represents their only
contact with the outside world.
But for many of these men and
women, mail call brings nothing.
Inside/Out is part.of a national
program started by Ken
McEachern, an inmate in Atlanta,
Georgia. In California, over 600
people are now taking part, but
the list of inmates desiring a
correspondent is constantly
growing. At Stanford, our list is
pathetically long — we need your
help!
If you would like to
correspond with a prisoner, come
by the Prison Information Center

in the Old Firehouse behind
Tresidder Union and leave your
name and address, or write to
Inside/Out, P.1.C., P.O. Box 6751,
Stanford, Ca. 94305. Thanks for
your concern.
