# Graduation-- 'Liberal Education?'
## Peter Tiersma 
### 
Although I do not generally
like to dwell upon past events, I
find myself compelled to
comment upon the graduation of
this June, at which I received my
degree. I had decided earlier in the
year, due to sympathy with the
goals of the African Relief Fund,
to donate the money that would
otherwise have gone to the rental
of a cap and gown in order to help
the victims of famine in the Sahel.
In a letter to the Daily I expressed
my feelings to that effect,
admittedly somewhat
passionately, in the hope that
others would do the same.
Since my parents would be
here for both baccalaureate and
commencement, I decided to
check if not wearing cap
and gown would bar me from
fully participating in these
ceremonies.
Noting that the instructions
sent to seniors stated that
participants were to appear in cap
and gown for both baccalaureate
and commencement, I inquired at

Public Events and was told that
caps and gowns would not be
required to take part in
graduation.
Under the circumstances, I was
surprised and angered to find,
when I arrived at Memorial
Auditorium an hour before
baccalaureate dressed in a suit,
that I would not be allowed to
march in the ceremony with my
fellow seniors.
It did not seem to make any
impression on the marshalls that
since I had given my two allotted
tickets to my parents, I would
therefore, a graduating senior, not
only not be able to directly

participate in the ceremony, but
would also not even be able to see
it.
Imagine the irony, after being
let in by a sympathetic usher, to
hear the excellent talk by Mrs.
Karefa-Smart which dealt in part
with the famine in the Sahel.
I feel that an apology to me
and any other senior or grad
student who was similarly
mistreated would certainly not be
out of order. Much more
important, however, is that the
members of the University
community be given the assurance
that never again will an attempt
be made to exclude someone from
a religious service of this nature.

I respect the opinion of those
hearts which skip a beat at the
sight of hundreds of young men
and women in uniform academic
regalia. However, this does not
entitle them to punish me for my
opinion.
I imagine that the marshalls,
like so many in the news today,
were only doing their duty. But if
this institution really offers the
liberal education which President
Lyman has mentioned so often, I
sincerely hope that in the future
those who try to carry out this
kind of education in their
personal lives will be encouraged
rather than opposed.

(Peter Tiersma is a 1974 graduate.)
Although I do not generally
like to dwell upon past events, I
find myself compelled to
comment upon the graduation of
this June, at which I received my
degree. I had decided earlier in the
year, due to sympathy with the
goals of the African Relief Fund,
to donate the money that would
otherwise have gone to the rental
of a cap and gown in order to help
the victims of famine in the Sahel.
In a letter to the Daily I expressed
my feelings to that effect,
admittedly somewhat
passionately, in the hope that
others would do the same.
Since my parents would be
here for both baccalaureate and
commencement, I decided to
check if not wearing cap
and gown would bar me from
fully participating in these
ceremonies.
Noting that the instructions
sent to seniors stated that
participants were to appear in cap
and gown for both baccalaureate
and commencement, I inquired at

Public Events and was told that
caps and gowns would not be
required to take part in
graduation.
Under the circumstances, I was
surprised and angered to find,
when I arrived at Memorial
Auditorium an hour before
baccalaureate dressed in a suit,
that I would not be allowed to
march in the ceremony with my
fellow seniors.
It did not seem to make any
impression on the marshalls that
since I had given my two allotted
tickets to my parents, I would
therefore, a graduating senior, not
only not be able to directly

participate in the ceremony, but
would also not even be able to see
it.
Imagine the irony, after being
let in by a sympathetic usher, to
hear the excellent talk by Mrs.
Karefa-Smart which dealt in part
with the famine in the Sahel.
I feel that an apology to me
and any other senior or grad
student who was similarly
mistreated would certainly not be
out of order. Much more
important, however, is that the
members of the University
community be given the assurance
that never again will an attempt
be made to exclude someone from
a religious service of this nature.

I respect the opinion of those
hearts which skip a beat at the
sight of hundreds of young men
and women in uniform academic
regalia. However, this does not
entitle them to punish me for my
opinion.
I imagine that the marshalls,
like so many in the news today,
were only doing their duty. But if
this institution really offers the
liberal education which President
Lyman has mentioned so often, I
sincerely hope that in the future
those who try to carry out this
kind of education in their
personal lives will be encouraged
rather than opposed.
