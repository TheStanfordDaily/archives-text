# The 						Oregon Experiment

The cry for political reform, for government
that will better represent the people, is quickly
spreading throughout the U.S.
Here in California, voters overwhelmingly chose
to make government more responsive to the people
last month by passing a political reform act and
nominating two gubernatorial candidates
untouched by scandal.
The California ideal is simple: make it possible
for better men to be elected, men without
connections to special interest groups; and they will
be more likely to make just decisions.
In Oregon this week, a different solution will be
tried. The Bend in the River Council (BITR) will
try to interest the citizens of Oregon in their own
government by having them vote on key issues by
means of the "media referendum."
This Thursday in the town of Bend, experts in
various fields will meet with members of an
advisory council, elected at town meetings in towns
throughout the state earlier in the year. For two
days, the BITR members will discuss the issues.
Then, on Saturday night, the Council will meet in
open session (televised by some Oregon stations)
and draft a ballot for presentation to the voters.
After the ballot is drafted, it will be presented in
newspapers, while debate on the subject continues
on broadcasts (it is hoped that TV and radio
stations and newspapers will be willing to donate

time and space to BITR).
Voters, who hopefully have been interested in
the process, will send in the newspaper ballots to be
counted. After the counting, results will appear, be
disseminated to the state's politicians. (The process
is colorfully described in the July 18 issue of
Rolling Stone.)
A tentative ballot has already been drafted.
According to the Oregon Daily Emerald, this
includes "measures about replacing the state
income tax with an energy tax, regulating
development by carrying capacity fa method of
limiting an area's population to the capacity of its
scarcest resource], preserving the banks of rivers,
administering all utilities such as public television
and public utilities and forbidding peacetime
missile launches over the state."
These measures sound innovative and radical.
The people of Oregon, the state which largely
decriminalized marijuana, may vote for them, but I
doubt California would.
But the issues, though interesting, are no more
than secondary. The question that will be answered
in Oregon is whether the people of a given area are
sufficiently interested in government to actively
participate in it.
If BITR works, it could be a first step toward
truly democratic government.
