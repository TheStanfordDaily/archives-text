# Contract Dispute Endangers Pub's Prospects
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Disagreement between the
University and a private company
on an operating contract threatens
the fall opening of an on-campus
pub, the Daily has learned. The
University and Guckenheimer, the
holding company for the
Tresidder food service (TDSInc),
have still not agreed on a written
operating contract for the pub
and it seems likely they never will,
even though a "verbal agreement"
was reached last April.

"It is doubtful we will agree
now," Tresidder Union Manager
Gordon Starr said. "If you had
asked me a week ago, I'd have said
we would." He would not say
what the specifics of the
disagreement are.
However, Dr. Stewart Ritchie,
president of Guckenheimer, said
that the University wants his
company to fund the project
which could cost more than
$50,000. He added that the
University also wants to charge his
company rent while they operate
the pub.
"The University is trying to set
up a landlord-tenant relationship
but I've stretched as far as I can
go," Ritchie said. "The ball is in
the University's court now."
Pressure Tactics
Asked if he thought the
University was using "pressure
tactics" to make him agree to
their position, Ritchie said, "I
used to think so but now I'm sure
they're serious [about their
plans]. That means they're
probably going out to bid."
If the University does not agree
on a contract with Guckenheimer,
the University may ask for bids on
the project and get another
company to operate the pub,
Starr said.
Complications, Delays
Ritchie said that even if the
University can come to an
agreement with a company in the
next 30 days and "everything goes
smoothly after that," the pub
probably will not open until
November 1. "There are just too
many administrative procedures."
Among them is the application

for the liquor license. The
company that runs the pub will
have to apply for an "on sale, beer
and wine license," allowing the
pub to sell beer and wine to
persons 21 or older, according to
Ritchie.
Once the application is
submitted to the Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control
(ABC), a 45-day waiting period
follows.
During this period a "notice of

intent" to sell beer and wine must
be posted for 30 days. Anyone
objecting can demand a hearing.
The Faculty Club, which has a
liquor license allowing sales of
hard liquor, spent one and a half
years getting approval from the
ABC, according to Francis Small,
the lawyer for the club in its fight
for a license.
"Unless the attitude of the
ABC has changed, the new pub
can anticipate a significant delay

(when it applies for the license),"
he said.
If the pub opens, it will be the
second of its kind in California.
Starr said the new public house
will provide "a place for students
to blow off steam, a place where
people can dance."
The pub, which is supposed to
take the place of the Encina
Snack Bar, will sell burgers and
possibly pizza in addition to beer
and wine, he added.

second of its kind in California.
Starr said the new public house
will provide "a place for students
to blow off steam, a place where
people can dance."
The pub, which is supposed to
take the place of the Encina
Snack Bar, will sell burgers and
possibly pizza in addition to beer
and wine, he added.
Disagreement between the
University and a private company
on an operating contract threatens
the fall opening of an on-campus
pub, the Daily has learned. The
University and Guckenheimer, the
holding company for the
Tresidder food service (TDSInc),
have still not agreed on a written
operating contract for the pub
and it seems likely they never will,
even though a "verbal agreement"
was reached last April.

"It is doubtful we will agree
now," Tresidder Union Manager
Gordon Starr said. "If you had
asked me a week ago, I'd have said
we would." He would not say
what the specifics of the
disagreement are.
However, Dr. Stewart Ritchie,
president of Guckenheimer, said
that the University wants his
company to fund the project
which could cost more than
$50,000. He added that the
University also wants to charge his
company rent while they operate
the pub.
"The University is trying to set
up a landlord-tenant relationship
but I've stretched as far as I can
go," Ritchie said. "The ball is in
the University's court now."
Pressure Tactics
Asked if he thought the
University was using "pressure
tactics" to make him agree to
their position, Ritchie said, "I
used to think so but now I'm sure
they're serious [about their
plans]. That means they're
probably going out to bid."
If the University does not agree
on a contract with Guckenheimer,
the University may ask for bids on
the project and get another
company to operate the pub,
Starr said.
Complications, Delays
Ritchie said that even if the
University can come to an
agreement with a company in the
next 30 days and "everything goes
smoothly after that," the pub
probably will not open until
November 1. "There are just too
many administrative procedures."
Among them is the application

for the liquor license. The
company that runs the pub will
have to apply for an "on sale, beer
and wine license," allowing the
pub to sell beer and wine to
persons 21 or older, according to
Ritchie.
Once the application is
submitted to the Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control
(ABC), a 45-day waiting period
follows.
During this period a "notice of

intent" to sell beer and wine must
be posted for 30 days. Anyone
objecting can demand a hearing.
The Faculty Club, which has a
liquor license allowing sales of
hard liquor, spent one and a half
years getting approval from the
ABC, according to Francis Small,
the lawyer for the club in its fight
for a license.
"Unless the attitude of the
ABC has changed, the new pub
can anticipate a significant delay

(when it applies for the license),"
he said.
If the pub opens, it will be the
second of its kind in California.
