# USE Dues Due For All
## Non-Union Members Object To Fees 
### DON COX 
Union dues or service fees
equal in amount to union dues
must be paid starting this month
hy all members of the Technical,
Maintenance and Service Unit and
many members are not happy
about it.
The situation arises out of the
agency shop clause in the recently
signed contract between the
United Stanford Employees union
(USE) representing the unit and
the University. According to the
clause, all non-union members in
the unit must pay, in effect, union
dues or be fired by the University.
Union dues are presently 0.2
percent of gross pay and members
are voting this week whether to
increase the amount to a full one

percent of wage base pay.
USE President Jim Berk
defends the agency shop as being
"fair" since the union has worked
to produce contract benefits for
non-union members who should
accordingly pay for the service.
However, Hansen Labs Senior
Technician Poorest Futtere is
trying to organize members
against the agency shop clause
included in the "pretty poor
contract."
'Non-Members Penalized'
"People feel they don't want
to pay into USE when they are
receiving so few benefits from it.
Members who do not belong to
USE should not be penalized since
they have no voice in the union,"
said Futtere.

Futtere and non-unit SLAC
employee John Grant have
formed the Stanford Employees
Against USE committee and are
collecting signatures on petitions
demanding the release of members
from the agency shop provision.
Grant said the committee had
collected "a couple hundred
signatures" so far out of the near
700 he says he needs to bring the
matter before the National Labor
Relations Board.
Legal Questions
Although there are some legal
questions about this procedure,
union observers have speculated
that the committee will fall far
short of the number of signatures
they are attempting to collect.
Berk is confident that the
union has the support of most
unit members, "most being union
members and paying dues."
Opposition to the agency shop
is especially concentrated among
SLAC unit members, Grant said.
Many of them are concerned
about any affiliation at all with
USE which grew out of a leftist
splinter group of an older union
on campus, Stanford Employees
Association (SEA), led at one
time by Puttere. These SLAC unit
members fear security clearances
they have held would be
jeopardized by any such
affiliation, Grant said.
'Fears Unfounded'
Berk said such fears are
unfounded and that USE is a
politically diversified group now.
If the dues increase to one

percent is approved, the extra
money would be used to build
and strengthen the union and pay
four full-time union employees,
Berk said.
Until recently Berk's wife,
Glenda Jones, was the only
full-time union employee. Berk,
however, recently took a leave of
absence from his job as an
electrical engineer at SLAC and is
now on the union payroll..
Futtere concedes that
non-union members should,
perhaps, pay something to the
union but this should amount to
only "one tenth or one
twentieth" of what union
members pay.
Response Lower Than Expected
Response to the petition drive
has been "lower than I had hoped
for" said Grant, but he remained
hopeful.
"The University bargained
away something that really wasn't
theirs to bargain away and we feel
this was pretty much of a betrayal
of the workers," Grant said.
The University had maintained
early in the negotiations that an
agency shop clause was unfair
since it placed a financial burden
on employees who came to
Stanford originally not expecting
to pay union dues. However, the
University changed its position
when they were "openly
persuaded" by the union.
Union members earlier this
month rejected a proposed
increase of dues to one percent of
gross pay.
