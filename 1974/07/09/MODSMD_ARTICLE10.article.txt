# Carpenter Walk-Out
## Construction Crippled 
### 
Construction work on the new
law school complex remains
crippled as striking Northern
California carpenters entered the
fourth week of their walkout.
Though no progress was
reported in the contract
negotiations between the
carpenters and Associated General
Contractors (AGC), Northern
California laborers ratified a new
three-year contract Friday, ending
a short strike by the laborers last
week. Laborers picketed campus
construction sites last week

effectively shutting down all
work.
Despite the return to work by
the laborers at the law school
project, "in a short while if the
carpenters don't get back to work
there won't be much left for
anyone else to do," said Hugh
Turner, assistant planning office
construction manager.
The construction supervisor for
Carl Olson & Sons Construction
Co., the contractor for the law
school complex, acknowledged
that "we can't continue
effectively much longer without
the carpenters."
Construction at the hospital
construction site has not been as
severely affected, Turner said.
The carpenters have not
picketed campus construction
sites to date.
Observers speculate that the
absence of the pickets might arise
out of a sympathy for other
workers on the sites who lost
three weeks of work during the
recent strike by the United
Stanford Employees (USE) union
strike. USE pickets slowed work
on the projects for three weeks.
