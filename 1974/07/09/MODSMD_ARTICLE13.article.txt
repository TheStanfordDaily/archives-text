# Study Confirms Stanford McCloskey Support
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
A study of voting patterns in
the June 4 primary election
confirms that Stanford students
gave Congressman Paul N.
McCloskey, Jr., R—Menlo Park,
essential support in his slim
victory over Atherton
Businessman J. Gordon Knapp.
The survey, conducted at 13
college campuses by the
University of California Student
Lobby, notes that Republican
registration increased about 80

percent between Jan. 1 and May
5, 1974. Turnout among these
Stanford Republicans was 67.3
percent compared to 41.5 percent
on the Democratic side.
According to the study,
McCloskey received 90.7 percent
of the vote in campus precincts to
Knapp's 7.8 percent, which
translates to an almost 1200-vote
margin. McCloskey won the
Republican nomination by just
867 votes out of 57,810 ballots.
The study also shows that

Stanford students supported
Jerome Waldie and Houston
Flournoy in their respective
primary races for governor, and
eventual runners-up Howard
Miller and John Veneman in their
bids for lieutenant governor.
Statewide Favorites
Statewide, students at the
surveyed colleges favored Robert
Moretti and Flournoy for
governor and eventual winners
Mervyn Dymally and John
Harmer for lieutenant governor.

Besides Stanford, the colleges
surveyed were the seven
University of California campuses
at Berkeley, Davis, Los Angeles
(UCLA), Riverside, San Diego,
Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz;
University of Southern California
(USC); California Institute of
Technology (Cal Tech);
Occidental College; Claremont
Colleges; and Loyola.
Stanford students supported
Waldie with 35.3 percent of the
vote for governor. William Matson
Roth garnered 22.6 percent,
George Brown Jr. 19.3 percent,
Moretti, 15.8 percent, Joseph
Alioto 4.4 percent.
Waldie carried just one other
campus. UC Santa Cruz with 39
percent of the vote. Brown also
won a plurality of the votes at
two colleges: Cal Tech and
Loyola.
Moretti Support
Moretti topped the field at the
other nine schools, winning as few
as 31.5 percent at the Claremont
Colleges and as much as 55
percent at UC-Santa Barbara.
Alioto mustered little support
from students, the survey
indicates. At Loyola, he
accumulated a high of 9.3
percent, but at UC-Santa Cruz he
received less than one percent of
the votes.
Roth's support varied
considerably, although he did not
win a plurality at any school. He
was favored by 27.1 percent of
the students at UCLA, but only
5.2 percent at Loyola.
Flournoy carried every campus

but Loyola, where he came out
even with Lt. Governor Ed
Reineke (each had 48.8 percent).
Flournoy claimed 80.6 percent of
the vote here, second highest to
the 86 percent he won at
UC-Davis.
Lieutenant Governor
In the Democratic primary for
lieutenant governor. Miller took
42.3 of the Stanford votes to
Dymally's 28.7 percent.
Statewide, however, Dymally
topped the balloting at eight
campuses, while Miller led in four.
On the Republican side,
Veneman captured just two other
campuses besides this one:
Claremont (59 percent) and
UC-Santa Cruz (51.2 percent).
Harmer's winning totals ranged
from 72.7 percent at USC down
to 51.8 percent at Occidental.
The survey also examined four
of the nine propositions on the
ballot. Propositions 1, 2, 5 and 9
were given strong support at all
colleges surveyed.
Proposition Support
Stanford students supported
Prop. 1 with 93.5 percent, Prop. 2
with 97.6 percent, Prop. 5 with
92.9 percent and Prop. 9 with
91.4 percent. Favorable support
on Prop. 9 varied from 80.4
percent at USC to 95.5 percent at
UC-Santa Barbara.
The survey also indicates that
Stanford had the highest turnout
of any campus, by a large margin.
In all, 49.5 percent of the
Stanford students went to the
polls.
This figure, when adjusted to
account for students who moved
from the precinct, increases to 55
percent. At most colleges (all but
Stanford and Cal Tech),
Democratic turnout outnumbered
Republican turnout.
Registration figures, compiled
in the study, show that Stanford,
due to the party-switching for the
Congressional race, had just 50.6
percent Democrats (lowest) and
39.7 percent Republicans (by far
the highest). In November, 1972,
the figures were 61.9 percent
Democrat and 17.5 percent
Republican for the eleven
precincts on this campus.

(USC); California Institute of
Technology (Cal Tech);
Occidental College; Claremont
Colleges; and Loyola.
Stanford students supported
Waldie with 35.3 percent of the
vote for governor. William Matson
Roth garnered 22.6 percent,
George Brown Jr. 19.3 percent,
Moretti, 15.8 percent, Joseph
Alioto 4.4 percent.
Waldie carried just one other
campus. UC Santa Cruz with 39
percent of the vote. Brown also
won a plurality of the votes at
two colleges: Cal Tech and
Loyola.
Moretti Support
Moretti topped the field at the
other nine schools, winning as few
as 31.5 percent at the Claremont
Colleges and as much as 55
percent at UC-Santa Barbara.
Alioto mustered little support
from students, the survey
indicates. At Loyola, he
accumulated a high of 9.3
percent, but at UC-Santa Cruz he
received less than one percent of
the votes.
Roth's support varied
considerably, although he did not
win a plurality at any school. He
was favored by 27.1 percent of
the students at UCLA, but only
5.2 percent at Loyola.
Flournoy carried every campus

but Loyola, where he came out
even with Lt. Governor Ed
Reineke (each had 48.8 percent).
Flournoy claimed 80.6 percent of
the vote here, second highest to
the 86 percent he won at
UC-Davis.
Lieutenant Governor
In the Democratic primary for
lieutenant governor. Miller took
42.3 of the Stanford votes to
Dymally's 28.7 percent.
Statewide, however, Dymally
topped the balloting at eight
campuses, while Miller led in four.
On the Republican side,
Veneman captured just two other
campuses besides this one:
Claremont (59 percent) and
UC-Santa Cruz (51.2 percent).
Harmer's winning totals ranged
from 72.7 percent at USC down
to 51.8 percent at Occidental.
The survey also examined four
of the nine propositions on the
ballot. Propositions 1, 2, 5 and 9
were given strong support at all
colleges surveyed.
Proposition Support
Stanford students supported
Prop. 1 with 93.5 percent, Prop. 2
with 97.6 percent, Prop. 5 with
92.9 percent and Prop. 9 with
91.4 percent. Favorable support
on Prop. 9 varied from 80.4
percent at USC to 95.5 percent at
UC-Santa Barbara.
The survey also indicates that
Stanford had the highest turnout
of any campus, by a large margin.
In all, 49.5 percent of the
Stanford students went to the
polls.
This figure, when adjusted to
account for students who moved
from the precinct, increases to 55
percent. At most colleges (all but
Stanford and Cal Tech),
Democratic turnout outnumbered
Republican turnout.
Registration figures, compiled
in the study, show that Stanford,
due to the party-switching for the
Congressional race, had just 50.6
percent Democrats (lowest) and
39.7 percent Republicans (by far
the highest). In November, 1972,
the figures were 61.9 percent
Democrat and 17.5 percent
Republican for the eleven
precincts on this campus.
A study of voting patterns in
the June 4 primary election
confirms that Stanford students
gave Congressman Paul N.
McCloskey, Jr., R—Menlo Park,
essential support in his slim
victory over Atherton
Businessman J. Gordon Knapp.
The survey, conducted at 13
college campuses by the
University of California Student
Lobby, notes that Republican
registration increased about 80

percent between Jan. 1 and May
5, 1974. Turnout among these
Stanford Republicans was 67.3
percent compared to 41.5 percent
on the Democratic side.
According to the study,
McCloskey received 90.7 percent
of the vote in campus precincts to
Knapp's 7.8 percent, which
translates to an almost 1200-vote
margin. McCloskey won the
Republican nomination by just
867 votes out of 57,810 ballots.
The study also shows that

Stanford students supported
Jerome Waldie and Houston
Flournoy in their respective
primary races for governor, and
eventual runners-up Howard
Miller and John Veneman in their
bids for lieutenant governor.
Statewide Favorites
Statewide, students at the
surveyed colleges favored Robert
Moretti and Flournoy for
governor and eventual winners

42.3 of the Stanford votes to
Dymally's 28.7 percent.
Statewide, however, Dymally
topped the balloting at eight
campuses, while Miller led in four.
On the Republican side,
Veneman captured just two other
campuses besides this one:
Claremont (59 percent) and
UC-Santa Cruz (51.2 percent).
Harmer's winning totals ranged
from 72.7 percent at USC down
to 51.8 percent at Occidental.
The survey also examined four
of the nine propositions on the
ballot. Propositions 1, 2, 5 and 9
were given strong support at all
colleges surveyed.
Proposition Support
Stanford students supported
Prop. 1 with 93.5 percent, Prop. 2
with 97.6 percent, Prop. 5 with
92.9 percent and Prop. 9 with
91.4 percent. Favorable support
on Prop. 9 varied from 80.4
percent at USC to 95.5 percent at
UC-Santa Barbara.
The survey also indicates that
Stanford had the highest turnout
of any campus, by a large margin.
In all, 49.5 percent of the
Stanford students went to the
polls.
This figure, when adjusted to
account for students who moved
from the precinct, increases to 55
percent. At most colleges (all but
Stanford and Cal Tech),
Democratic turnout outnumbered
Republican turnout.
Registration figures, compiled
in the study, show that Stanford,
due to the party-switching for the
Congressional race, had just 50.6
percent Democrats (lowest) and
39.7 percent Republicans (by far
the highest). In November, 1972,
the figures were 61.9 percent
Democrat and 17.5 percent
Republican for the eleven
precincts on this campus.
A study of voting patterns in
the June 4 primary election
confirms that Stanford students
gave Congressman Paul N.
McCloskey, Jr., R—Menlo Park,
essential support in his slim
victory over Atherton
Businessman J. Gordon Knapp.
The survey, conducted at 13
college campuses by the
University of California Student
Lobby, notes that Republican
registration increased about 80

percent between Jan. 1 and May
5, 1974. Turnout among these
Stanford Republicans was 67.3
percent compared to 41.5 percent
on the Democratic side.
According to the study,
McCloskey received 90.7 percent
of the vote in campus precincts to
Knapp's 7.8 percent, which
translates to an almost 1200-vote
margin. McCloskey won the
Republican nomination by just
867 votes out of 57,810 ballots.
The study also shows that

Stanford students supported
Jerome Waldie and Houston
Flournoy in their respective
primary races for governor, and
eventual runners-up Howard
Miller and John Veneman in their
bids for lieutenant governor.
Statewide Favorites
Statewide, students at the
surveyed colleges favored Robert
Moretti and Flournoy for
governor and eventual winners
Mervyn Dymally and John
Harmer for lieutenant governor.

Besides Stanford, the colleges
surveyed were the seven
University of California campuses
at Berkeley, Davis, Los Angeles
(UCLA), Riverside, San Diego,
Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz;
University of Southern California
(USC); California Institute of
Technology (Cal Tech);
Occidental College; Claremont
Colleges; and Loyola.
Stanford students supported
Waldie with 35.3 percent of the
vote for governor. William Matson
Roth garnered 22.6 percent,
George Brown Jr. 19.3 percent,
Moretti, 15.8 percent, Joseph
Alioto 4.4 percent.
Waldie carried just one other
campus. UC Santa Cruz with 39
percent of the vote. Brown also
won a plurality of the votes at
two colleges: Cal Tech and
Loyola.
Moretti Support
Moretti topped the field at the
other nine schools, winning as few
as 31.5 percent at the Claremont
Colleges and as much as 55
percent at UC-Santa Barbara.
Alioto mustered little support
from students, the survey
indicates. At Loyola, he
accumulated a high of 9.3
percent, but at UC-Santa Cruz he
received less than one percent of
the votes.
Roth's support varied
considerably, although he did not
win a plurality at any school. He
was favored by 27.1 percent of
the students at UCLA, but only
5.2 percent at Loyola.
Flournoy carried every campus

but Loyola, where he came out
even with Lt. Governor Ed
Reineke (each had 48.8 percent).

the vote here, second highest to
the 86 percent he won at
UC-Davis.
