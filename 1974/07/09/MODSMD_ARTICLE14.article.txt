# Shopping Center Murder
## Killer Sentenced To Death 
### 
John Kreuter, 20, was sentenced to death last
Tuesday for the first-degree murder of Liana
Hughes, a Palo Alto housewife.
A San Mateo County Superior Court jury, which
earlier convicted Kreuter of first-degree murder,
found that Kreuter committed rape and kidnaping
in committing the crime.
Under California's new capital punishment law,
if a jury finds that "special circumstances" exist,
imposition of the death penalty is mandatory.
Kreuter is only the second man to be sentenced to
death under the new law.
'Special Circumstances'
Judge Frank Piombo had instructed the jurors
not to concern themselves with any possible
penalty, but only whether the facts supported
"special circumstances," as required in the law. The
law was enacted by the legislature after voters
approved resumption of capital punishment in a
1972 referendum.
Piombo barred Defense Attorney David
Pomerenk from discussing the death penalty before
the jurors.
Pomerenk objected to this, and also to possible

exclusion of any jurors who exhibited any
conscientious objection to the death penalty.
The case could become a test for the new law,
and go as far as the U.S. Supreme Court, attorneys
on both sides said.
Mandatory Penalty
The Supreme Court ruled in 1972 that existing
capital punishment laws were arbitrarily imposed
and therefore constituted cruel and unusual
punishment. New laws, such as that of California,
attempt to circumvent this objection by making the
death penalty mandatory under certain
circumstances.
Hughes disappeared from the Stanford Shopping
Center on Jan. 29. Six days later, she was found
dead in her mini-motor home. An autopsy
indicated she had died of strychnine poisoning.
Kreuter was linked to the crime by a bottle of
strychnine found in his room and also by a right
palm print found in the camper.
Kreuter may also appeal his conviction on the
grounds that the bottle of strychnine was not listed
in a search warrant and might then be an unlawful
seizure.
