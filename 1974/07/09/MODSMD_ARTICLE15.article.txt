# Willie Humphrey Leads PHJB Jazz
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band of New Orleans returned to
campus for its eighth annual
summer stay last week, bringing
the unmistakable, happy sound of
traditional New Orleans jazz with
them.
The band opened Tuesday
night in Dinkelspiel as they have
some 50 times before, with just
piano, trumpet and drummer on
stage. After the first few choruses,
clarinetist Willie Humphrey joined
them from the wings and took the
lead for a while.
Next, trombonist Jim
Robinson made his entrance,
pausing in his playing only long
enough to negotiate the steps
down to the stage. At the end of
the number, Allan Jaffe on tuba
and Frank Domond on banjo
filled out the bard.
Two faces in the band
were unfamiliar to summer
regulars: trumpeter Percy
Humphrey, who appeared here for
one show last fall, has replaced
the late DeDe Pierce; and
pianist-singer Sing Miller is making
this tour in the place of Billie
Pierce, who is staying home with
an ear infection.
Jazz Standards
Tuesday's fare was mostly jazz
standards, including some plain
old blues. The form of each tune

was predictable, but just what the
audience wanted to hear: a few
choruses by the whole band, then
ample solos by the Humphreys,
Miller and Robinson, and finally a
pull-out-the-stops ensemble
chorus or two to close.
Percy Humphrey's trumpet
solos were a bit more conservative
than his predecessor's, but quite
acceptable. "Big Jim" Robinson
showed once again that he can
play great jazz trombone, when he
takes time out from his clowning
and playing to the audience.
He still has the annoying habit
of dancing, clapping and
otherwise stealing the spotlight
during other people's solos, but
seems to have toned it down a bit.
I suppose you can't teach an old
(82 years) trombonist new tricks.
Stand Out
But as more and more of the
band's audiences are discovering,
Willie Humphrey's clarinet stands
considerably above the rest of the
band, and seems to get better
every year. That might just be the
prejudice of a diehard clarinet fan
coming through, but the Tuesday
night audience applauded longer
and louder for his solos than any
others. His technique is flawless,
but not slick; he is not out to
impress anyone with his
virtuosity, just to play good jazz.
Drummer "Cie" Frazier held
the whole thing together in
traditional New Orleans fashion,
and took some good solos with his
distinctive blend of drums,
cymbals and wood blocks.
Several members of the band
did vocals from time to time. Sing

Miller did a few blues songs, and
the Humphreys sang "Hold That
Tiger," complete with a chorus of
Percy growling and Willie dancing.
Willie also danced, played and
sang his way through "Eliza
Jane," his traditional
crowd-pleaser.
Change Of Mood
After "Eliza Jane," the mood
changed suddenly for their
perennial closing number, "Just a
Closer Walk With Thee."
A traditional New Orleans jazz
funeral tune, it begins with a
dirge-like rhythm, with all of the
band members playing down low
and as sweetly and sadly as
possible. The solos are all
mournful, each speaking the
language of his own instrument.
Again there is the ensemble
finish, with the trumpet carrying
the melody, the trombone helping
with the bass and rhythm, and the
clarinet exploring various
harmonies and embellishments.
Then the tempo breaks with a
drum roll, and the parade is on, as
the band goes through the tune
again in a mood of celebration to
wish the departed on his way.
Saints Marching
Finally, the inevitable encore,
"When the Saints Go Marchin'
In," with Willie leading the parade
through the audience and the
lobby. It's hard to imagine that,
when the saints do go marchin' in,
Willie Humphrey won't be at the
front of the parade playing his
clarinet even better.
I also heard the band do two
shows Friday night. While the first
set Tuesday night had dragged a
bit, with the band seeming a bit
tired, by Friday any problems
were solved and it was full speed
ahead. The first show was a
condensed form of the Tuesday
show (unfortunately without
"Saints") in order to leave time
and energy for the second.

summer stay last week, bringing
the unmistakable, happy sound of
traditional New Orleans jazz with
them.
The band opened Tuesday
night in Dinkelspiel as they have
some 50 times before, with just
piano, trumpet and drummer on
stage. After the first few choruses,
clarinetist Willie Humphrey joined
them from the wings and took the
lead for a while.
Next, trombonist Jim
Robinson made his entrance,
pausing in his playing only long
enough to negotiate the steps
down to the stage. At the end of
the number, Allan Jaffe on tuba
and Frank Domond on banjo
filled out the bard.
Two faces in the band
were unfamiliar to summer
regulars: trumpeter Percy
Humphrey, who appeared here for
one show last fall, has replaced
the late DeDe Pierce; and
pianist-singer Sing Miller is making
this tour in the place of Billie
Pierce, who is staying home with
an ear infection.
Jazz Standards
Tuesday's fare was mostly jazz
standards, including some plain
old blues. The form of each tune

was predictable, but just what the
audience wanted to hear: a few
choruses by the whole band, then
ample solos by the Humphreys,
Miller and Robinson, and finally a
pull-out-the-stops ensemble
chorus or two to close.
Percy Humphrey's trumpet
solos were a bit more conservative
than his predecessor's, but quite
acceptable. "Big Jim" Robinson
showed once again that he can
play great jazz trombone, when he
takes time out from his clowning
and playing to the audience.
He still has the annoying habit
of dancing, clapping and
otherwise stealing the spotlight
during other people's solos, but
seems to have toned it down a bit.
I suppose you can't teach an old
(82 years) trombonist new tricks.
Stand Out
But as more and more of the
band's audiences are discovering,
Willie Humphrey's clarinet stands
considerably above the rest of the
band, and seems to get better
every year. That might just be the
prejudice of a diehard clarinet fan
coming through, but the Tuesday
night audience applauded longer
and louder for his solos than any
others. His technique is flawless,
but not slick; he is not out to
impress anyone with his
virtuosity, just to play good jazz.
Drummer "Cie" Frazier held
the whole thing together in
traditional New Orleans fashion,
and took some good solos with his
distinctive blend of drums,
cymbals and wood blocks.
Several members of the band
did vocals from time to time. Sing

Miller did a few blues songs, and
the Humphreys sang "Hold That
Tiger," complete with a chorus of
Percy growling and Willie dancing.
Willie also danced, played and
sang his way through "Eliza
Jane," his traditional
crowd-pleaser.
Change Of Mood
After "Eliza Jane," the mood
changed suddenly for their
perennial closing number, "Just a
Closer Walk With Thee."
A traditional New Orleans jazz
funeral tune, it begins with a
dirge-like rhythm, with all of the
band members playing down low
and as sweetly and sadly as
possible. The solos are all
mournful, each speaking the
language of his own instrument.
Again there is the ensemble
finish, with the trumpet carrying
the melody, the trombone helping
with the bass and rhythm, and the
clarinet exploring various
harmonies and embellishments.
Then the tempo breaks with a
drum roll, and the parade is on, as
the band goes through the tune
again in a mood of celebration to
wish the departed on his way.
Saints Marching
Finally, the inevitable encore,
"When the Saints Go Marchin'
In," with Willie leading the parade
through the audience and the
lobby. It's hard to imagine that,
when the saints do go marchin' in,
Willie Humphrey won't be at the
front of the parade playing his
clarinet even better.
I also heard the band do two
shows Friday night. While the first
set Tuesday night had dragged a
bit, with the band seeming a bit
tired, by Friday any problems
were solved and it was full speed
ahead. The first show was a
condensed form of the Tuesday
show (unfortunately without
"Saints") in order to leave time
and energy for the second.
