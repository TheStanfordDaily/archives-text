# Elton's 'Caribou' A Letdown, But Another Gold Album
## 
### 
Elton John:
Caribou
MCA 2116
After all is said and done,
Elton John's Caribou will be a
platinum album (over 1,000,000
copies sold), just like all the rest
of his studio albums released in
America.
But for the record. Caribou
really doesn't do Elton justice and
is a big letdown after his
amazingly fine Goodbye Yellow
Brick Road.
Originally titled "Old Pink
Eyes Is Back" (a parody on Frank
Sinatora's Old Blue Eyes Is Back),
Caribou contains some of the
most banal lyrics and overdone
vocals to come out of the team of
lyricist Bernie Taupin and
pianist-composer-vocalist John.
In addition, the album fails to
make use of the tremendously
talented Tower of Power horns,
relegating them to routine section
backups except for two
uninspiring tenor sax solos by
Lenny Pickett. Nameless studio
musicians could have done as well
— or better.
Incessant Percussion
And if you're a tambourine or
conga freak, you can OD on Ray
Cooper's loud, boring, simple but
omnipresent percussion which
singlehandedly almost ruins
several cuts.
The list of failures on the
album is notable. First, there's
"I've Seen the Saucers," a
pointless, sickening song about
crazies and UFOs. Later on, Elton
almost parodies himself clowning
about with an operatic vocal style
while voicing Taupin's nonsense
lyrics in "Solar Prestige A
Gammon."
Mix one tango intro on piano,
a few words about a New York

prostitute and a vocal that tries to
pick up where "All the Girls Love
Alice" (from Yellow Brick Road)
left off, and you've got "You're
So Static." But even with Tower
of Power brass behind him, Elton
bombs on that cut and on a
soul-like ditty about a garden pest
called "Stinker."
"Dixie Lily," a riverboat tune,
is cute, but will never compete
with the John-Taupin classic
riverboat saga, "My Father's Gun"
(from Tumbleweed Connection).
And despite what the lyrics say
"Pinkie" is not "as perfect as the
fourth of July," but has moments.
V/i Minute Waste
On top of all of this waste, add
a 7'/2-minute cut titled "Ticking,
Ticking" which has a beautiful
melody (albeit the vocal effects
are overdone), but which drags on
verse after verse after verse.
Why then will Caribou be
Elton's next platinum? Well,
remember Elton John's a
superstar. Caribou sold over $1
million worth (a gold record) in
advance order alone — simply
because it was Elton John's latest

release.
Then, two of the 10 cuts are
well done and two good cuts can
sell a whole album.
The AM hit "Don't Let the
Sun Go Down on Me" is beautiful
in the "Goodbye Yellow Brick
Road" mold (but a little too
heavy on the tambourine, Ray).
The song also has perhaps the
most moving lyrics Bernie Taupin
has ever written.
"/ can't light no more of your
darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to
black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands
still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of life. "
"The Bitch Is Back" is a
first-class rocker (but almost
second-class Elton John after
listening to "Saturday Night's
Alright for Fighting").
All in all, Caribou is passable,
but hopefully not the indication
of a downhill slope in quality
from one of England's true
superstars.

WHY IS THIS MAN SMILING?-Well, for one, his latest album,
Caribou is already a gold album with a top-40 smash single in its first
month of release. And for another, his new contract with MCA
Records is expected to net him $8 million. The man behind the glasses
is, of course, England's Elton John, pictured on the Caribou album
jacket.
