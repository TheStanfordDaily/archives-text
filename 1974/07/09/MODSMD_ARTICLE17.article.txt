# Polanski's 'Chinatown' Near Perfect
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Chinatown is one of those rare
movies that's practically perfect in
every way, and director Roman
Polanski's best film since
Rosemary's Baby.
Following the tragedy of his
wife's murder in 1969, Polanski
made only two films that did little
to enhance his stature as a
director, a bloody, fatuous version
of Macbeth, and an X-rated black
comedy, What?
But aided by a top-notch cast,
literate script and excellent
cinematography, Polanski now

seems to be back at the top of his
form.
Chinatown takes place in Los
Angeles of the 19305, but it's not
so much a period piece as it is an
examination of a state of mind.
Only the climactic scenes of the
film actually take place in Los
Angeles' Chinatown, when the
meaning of the title becomes
clear.
Jack Nicholson, as the
policeman-turned-private
detective who specializes in
matrimonial infidelity, gives
another top-notch performance,

treading a thin line between social
respectability and outraging the
public decency.
His confrontations with Faye
Dunaway, who portrays the
mysterious Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray,
always embody these two sides of
his personality. Dunaway plays
the exotic lady with just the right
touches, clothes and makeup, and
gives her acting career a
much-needed boost after being
miscast in a number of mediocre
films since Bonnie and Clyde.
To sketch the plot in detail
would be a disservice to those
who haven't seen the movie. But

briefly, Nicholson as private
investigator J.J. Gittis, takes a
case that seems to be simple
marital infidelity, but soon
escalates into murder, and
manipulation of real estate and
water rights in the Los Angeles
basin. Lurking in the background
is Noah Cross (director/actor John
Huston), a kindly-looking but
somehow sinister rich old man
who is Mrs. Mulwray's father.
John Alonzo's color
photography and Robert Towne's
script all contribute to the
establishment of the proper
ambiance, but there is no fawning

over the 1930's in a nostalgic way.
Polanski doesn't let the time
period get in the way of the story,
which is as meticulously crafted as
a complicated jigsaw puzzle about
the mentality of an era. When the
final piece is in place, the film
ends. But not once in the more
than two hours of running time
does audience interest lag.
It's not that so much is
happening on the screen, but
Polanski's ability to keep the
audience interested in what's
going to happen next that carries
the film along.

seems to be back at the top of his
form.
Chinatown takes place in Los
Angeles of the 19305, but it's not
so much a period piece as it is an
examination of a state of mind.
Only the climactic scenes of the
film actually take place in Los
Angeles' Chinatown, when the
meaning of the title becomes
clear.
Jack Nicholson, as the
policeman-turned-private
detective who specializes in
matrimonial infidelity, gives
another top-notch performance,

treading a thin line between social
respectability and outraging the
public decency.
His confrontations with Faye
Dunaway, who portrays the
mysterious Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray,
always embody these two sides of
his personality. Dunaway plays
the exotic lady with just the right
touches, clothes and makeup, and
gives her acting career a
much-needed boost after being
miscast in a number of mediocre
films since Bonnie and Clyde.
To sketch the plot in detail
would be a disservice to those
who haven't seen the movie. But

briefly, Nicholson as private
investigator J.J. Gittis, takes a
case that seems to be simple
marital infidelity, but soon
escalates into murder, and
manipulation of real estate and
water rights in the Los Angeles
basin. Lurking in the background
is Noah Cross (director/actor John
Huston), a kindly-looking but
somehow sinister rich old man
who is Mrs. Mulwray's father.
John Alonzo's color
photography and Robert Towne's
script all contribute to the
establishment of the proper
ambiance, but there is no fawning

over the 1930's in a nostalgic way.
Polanski doesn't let the time
period get in the way of the story,
which is as meticulously crafted as
a complicated jigsaw puzzle about
the mentality of an era. When the
final piece is in place, the film
ends. But not once in the more
than two hours of running time
does audience interest lag.
It's not that so much is
happening on the screen, but
Polanski's ability to keep the
audience interested in what's
going to happen next that carries
the film along.

Chinatown is one of those rare
movies that's practically perfect in
every way, and director Roman
Polanski's best film since
Rosemary's Baby.
Following the tragedy of his
wife's murder in 1969, Polanski
made only two films that did little
to enhance his stature as a
director, a bloody, fatuous version
of Macbeth, and an X-rated black
comedy, What?
But aided by a top-notch cast,
literate script and excellent
cinematography, Polanski now

seems to be back at the top of his
form.
