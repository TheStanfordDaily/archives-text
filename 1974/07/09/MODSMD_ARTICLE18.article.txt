# Hilton Performs, Teaches Early Dance
## 
### JANICE ROSS 
Last Monday evening in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
artist-in-residence Wendy Hilton
presented a unique
lecture-demonstration on French
dance and music of the early
18th Century.
Despite the fact that most
Early dances were couple dances,
Hilton, costumed in a dazzling
white satin 18th Century gown,
succeeded in presenting an hour
long, one-woman lecture —
demonstration of dances without
the aid of a partner that was both
enchanting and informative. Her
knowledge, devotion and personal
charm helped lend life to a subject

which might all too easily become
dry and tedious to the layperson.
This lecture-demonstration
marked the high point of a two
week long Summer Workshop in
Early Music and Dance, directed
by Hilton and sponsored by the
Stanford Music Department.
A native of England, Hilton is
an internationally reknown
authority on the dance form of
the French Baroque Court. She
has resided in New York for the
past several years where she
choreographs and performs in
addition to teaching period
movement and dance classes at
the Julliard School.
Hilton's dance background

includes considerable training in
the classical ballet tradition. It
wasn't until the late 1950s that
she met Melusine Wood, a pioneer
in historical dance research, who
stimulated her interest in dance of
the French Baroque period.
However, it hasn't been until
recently that Hilton has been able
to devote her full time to the
study of Early Dance. As she
explains, "In 1961 I formed a
dance group called the Domenico
Dance ensemble. At first there
was no opportunity to make a
living, but gradually I was able to
do less ballet dancing, and to
teach Early Dance instead.
Eventually I began teaching on a
full time basis at the Guildhall
School of Music and Dance and
the Royal Academy of Dancing in
London."
With the aid of old dance
prints, diaries, commentaries and
dances recorded by the Feuillet
system of notation, which was
devised by the Frenchman Raoul
Feuillet in 1700, Hilton has
succeeded in reconstructing
dances of the Seventeenth and
Eighteenth Century, many of
which have never been accurately
performed since that time.
As a result of her extensive
knowledge in this unique area
Hilton has understandably little
patience for inaccuracies and
exaggerations in the performance
of these dances. "Get those Ballet
arms down, and look prouder!"
She frequently admonishes the
Workshop students; "Don't swing
your hips so far out to the side,
no one would have dared be that

vulgar in the presence of his
Majesty!"
Meticulous about period
authenticity, Hilton is also
justifiably piqued at many
contemporary film and theatre
directors who depict 18th
Century dancers as "fops" or
"fags."
"These gentlemen were not
'fags'," she protests. "Despite the
elegance of their dress and the
artifice of their manners they
were very masculine and self
assured .... They would go to
their dancing masters anywhere
from one to three times a
week .... and that was not just
because they were gentlemen who
did not have to work hard for a
living.... Even if people in
society found themselves
temporarily impoverished the
dancing lesson was one of the last
things to be sacrificed. It was not
regarded as a luxury at all."
Indeed, the twice daily
technique classes that Hilton
teaches the workshop students are
in themselves lessons in court
etiquette as well as dance styles.
Seated at the head of the dance
floor Hilton maintains a regal
presence despite the often clumsy
and graceless antics of her
students.
"In the 17th and 18th
Centuries dancing was a very
formal ritual, when you had a
ruler in England or France who
was a good dancer, then it was
important for everyone at court
to be able to dance well ... you
had to participate, it was not
especially an evening of sport or

fun, it was a ritual, a social duty,"
she reminds her students.
At Monday evening's program
Hilton performed several dances
which she has adapted from
original sources and set to
instrumental music. Ranging from
the stately and controlled releves
and plies of the Minuet and
Courante to the lively and gay
runs of the Gigue and the Canarie,
these dances all demonstrate a
careful attention to details of
symmetry and formal structure.
The harmony and serenity of
the dance, and the emphasis on
proper carriage and deportment as
well as the repetition may have
been, in part, a reflection of the
social mileu, where everyone and
everything had its place, and the
highest goal was to be gentile and
elegant. At times it seems as if
many of the dances were created
simply as a pretense for displaying
one's fine clothing and manners.
Because of the complexity and
yet subtlety of these dances, they
may appear disarmingly simple,
and similar. But the more one
observes the dances, the more he
comes to appreciate them and
recognize their distinctiveness.
For hidden within the elegant
movements, simple lines, precise
foot work, and carefully
articulated jumps and hops were
the beginnings of Ballet.

FIT FOR A KlNG—This graceful lady displays the regal dance style
taught by Wendy Hilton during the recent Early Dance Workshop.
Last Monday evening in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
artist-in-residence Wendy Hilton
presented a unique
lecture-demonstration on French
dance and music of the early
18th Century.
Despite the fact that most
Early dances were couple dances,
Hilton, costumed in a dazzling
white satin 18th Century gown,
succeeded in presenting an hour
long, one-woman lecture —
demonstration of dances without
the aid of a partner that was both
enchanting and informative. Her
knowledge, devotion and personal
charm helped lend life to a subject

which might all too easily become
dry and tedious to the layperson.
This lecture-demonstration
marked the high point of a two
week long Summer Workshop in
Early Music and Dance, directed
by Hilton and sponsored by the
Stanford Music Department.
A native of England, Hilton is
an internationally reknown
authority on the dance form of
the French Baroque Court. She
has resided in New York for the
past several years where she
choreographs and performs in
addition to teaching period
movement and dance classes at
the Julliard School.
Hilton's dance background

includes considerable training in
the classical ballet tradition. It
wasn't until the late 1950s that
she met Melusine Wood, a pioneer
in historical dance research, who
stimulated her interest in dance of
the French Baroque period.
However, it hasn't been until
recently that Hilton has been able
to devote her full time to the
study of Early Dance. As she
explains, "In 1961 I formed a
dance group called the Domenico
Dance ensemble. At first there
was no opportunity to make a
living, but gradually I was able to
do less ballet dancing, and to
teach Early Dance instead.
Eventually I began teaching on a
full time basis at the Guildhall
School of Music and Dance and
the Royal Academy of Dancing in
London."
With the aid of old dance
prints, diaries, commentaries and
dances recorded by the Feuillet
system of notation, which was
devised by the Frenchman Raoul
Feuillet in 1700, Hilton has
succeeded in reconstructing
dances of the Seventeenth and
Eighteenth Century, many of
which have never been accurately
performed since that time.
As a result of her extensive
knowledge in this unique area
Hilton has understandably little
patience for inaccuracies and
exaggerations in the performance
of these dances. "Get those Ballet
arms down, and look prouder!"
She frequently admonishes the
Workshop students; "Don't swing
your hips so far out to the side,
no one would have dared be that

vulgar in the presence of his
Majesty!"
Meticulous about period
authenticity, Hilton is also
justifiably piqued at many
contemporary film and theatre
directors who depict 18th
Century dancers as "fops" or
"fags."
"These gentlemen were not
'fags'," she protests. "Despite the
elegance of their dress and the
artifice of their manners they
were very masculine and self
assured .... They would go to
their dancing masters anywhere
from one to three times a
week .... and that was not just
because they were gentlemen who
did not have to work hard for a
living.... Even if people in
society found themselves
temporarily impoverished the
dancing lesson was one of the last
things to be sacrificed. It was not
regarded as a luxury at all."
Indeed, the twice daily
technique classes that Hilton
teaches the workshop students are
in themselves lessons in court
etiquette as well as dance styles.
Seated at the head of the dance
floor Hilton maintains a regal
presence despite the often clumsy
and graceless antics of her
students.
"In the 17th and 18th
Centuries dancing was a very
formal ritual, when you had a
ruler in England or France who
was a good dancer, then it was
important for everyone at court
to be able to dance well ... you
had to participate, it was not
especially an evening of sport or

fun, it was a ritual, a social duty,"
she reminds her students.
At Monday evening's program
Hilton performed several dances
which she has adapted from
original sources and set to
instrumental music. Ranging from
the stately and controlled releves
and plies of the Minuet and
Courante to the lively and gay
runs of the Gigue and the Canarie,
these dances all demonstrate a
careful attention to details of
symmetry and formal structure.
The harmony and serenity of
the dance, and the emphasis on
proper carriage and deportment as
well as the repetition may have
been, in part, a reflection of the
social mileu, where everyone and
everything had its place, and the
highest goal was to be gentile and
elegant. At times it seems as if
many of the dances were created
simply as a pretense for displaying
one's fine clothing and manners.
Because of the complexity and
yet subtlety of these dances, they
may appear disarmingly simple,
and similar. But the more one
observes the dances, the more he
comes to appreciate them and
recognize their distinctiveness.

FIT FOR A KlNG—This graceful lady displays the regal dance style
taught by Wendy Hilton during the recent Early Dance Workshop.
Last Monday evening in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
artist-in-residence Wendy Hilton
presented a unique
lecture-demonstration on French
dance and music of the early
18th Century.
Despite the fact that most
Early dances were couple dances,
Hilton, costumed in a dazzling
white satin 18th Century gown,
succeeded in presenting an hour
long, one-woman lecture —
demonstration of dances without
the aid of a partner that was both
enchanting and informative. Her
knowledge, devotion and personal
charm helped lend life to a subject

which might all too easily become
dry and tedious to the layperson.
This lecture-demonstration
marked the high point of a two
week long Summer Workshop in
Early Music and Dance, directed
by Hilton and sponsored by the
Stanford Music Department.
A native of England, Hilton is
an internationally reknown
authority on the dance form of
the French Baroque Court. She
has resided in New York for the
past several years where she
choreographs and performs in
addition to teaching period
movement and dance classes at
the Julliard School.
Hilton's dance background

includes considerable training in
the classical ballet tradition. It
wasn't until the late 1950s that
she met Melusine Wood, a pioneer
in historical dance research, who
stimulated her interest in dance of
the French Baroque period.
However, it hasn't been until
recently that Hilton has been able
to devote her full time to the
study of Early Dance. As she
explains, "In 1961 I formed a
dance group called the Domenico
Dance ensemble. At first there
was no opportunity to make a
living, but gradually I was able to
do less ballet dancing, and to
teach Early Dance instead.
Eventually I began teaching on a
full time basis at the Guildhall
School of Music and Dance and
the Royal Academy of Dancing in
London."
With the aid of old dance
prints, diaries, commentaries and
dances recorded by the Feuillet
system of notation, which was
devised by the Frenchman Raoul
Feuillet in 1700, Hilton has
succeeded in reconstructing
dances of the Seventeenth and
Eighteenth Century, many of
which have never been accurately
performed since that time.
As a result of her extensive
knowledge in this unique area
Hilton has understandably little
patience for inaccuracies and
exaggerations in the performance
of these dances. "Get those Ballet
arms down, and look prouder!"
She frequently admonishes the
Workshop students; "Don't swing
your hips so far out to the side,
no one would have dared be that

vulgar in the presence of his
Majesty!"
Meticulous about period
authenticity, Hilton is also
justifiably piqued at many
contemporary film and theatre
directors who depict 18th
Century dancers as "fops" or
"fags."
"These gentlemen were not
'fags'," she protests. "Despite the
elegance of their dress and the
artifice of their manners they
were very masculine and self
assured .... They would go to
their dancing masters anywhere
from one to three times a
week .... and that was not just
because they were gentlemen who
did not have to work hard for a
living.... Even if people in
society found themselves
temporarily impoverished the
dancing lesson was one of the last
things to be sacrificed. It was not
regarded as a luxury at all."
Indeed, the twice daily
technique classes that Hilton
teaches the workshop students are
in themselves lessons in court
etiquette as well as dance styles.
Seated at the head of the dance
floor Hilton maintains a regal
presence despite the often clumsy
and graceless antics of her
students.
"In the 17th and 18th
Centuries dancing was a very
formal ritual, when you had a
ruler in England or France who
was a good dancer, then it was
important for everyone at court
to be able to dance well ... you
had to participate, it was not
especially an evening of sport or

fun, it was a ritual, a social duty,"
she reminds her students.
At Monday evening's program
Hilton performed several dances
which she has adapted from
original sources and set to
instrumental music. Ranging from
the stately and controlled releves
and plies of the Minuet and
Courante to the lively and gay
runs of the Gigue and the Canarie,
these dances all demonstrate a
careful attention to details of
symmetry and formal structure.
The harmony and serenity of
the dance, and the emphasis on
proper carriage and deportment as
well as the repetition may have
been, in part, a reflection of the
social mileu, where everyone and
everything had its place, and the
highest goal was to be gentile and
elegant. At times it seems as if
many of the dances were created
simply as a pretense for displaying
one's fine clothing and manners.
Because of the complexity and
yet subtlety of these dances, they
may appear disarmingly simple,
and similar. But the more one
observes the dances, the more he
comes to appreciate them and
recognize their distinctiveness.
