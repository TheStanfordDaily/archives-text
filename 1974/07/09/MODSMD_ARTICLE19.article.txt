High Court Hears U.S. vs. Nixon
WASHINGTON — The long-awaited court battle
entitled United States of America vs. Richard Nixon began
yesterday.
The Supreme Court heard opening arguments from
Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski's office and
the President's defense lawyers for three hours. The court
has been asked to determine whether Nixon must
surrender tapes subpoenaed by the Prosecutor's office.
The Court also heard arguments in the companion case,
Richard Nixon vs. United States of America. Nixon claims
he cannot be named an unindicted co-conspirator in the
Watergate cover-up.
The prosecution said yesterday that Nixon cannot
claim executive privilege in withholding the tapes because
there is evidence that the President was part of a criminal
conspiracy.
Assistant Prosecutor Philip Lacovara said the
prosecution has already adequately demonstrated that the
taped conversations were held "in furtherance of a
criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States and
obstruct justice."
But White House lawyer James St. Clair argued that
Jaworski's authority as a special prosecutor does not give
him any power to interpret the validity of a President's
claim of executive privilege.
He said Jaworski's order would make Nixon "an 85
percent President instead of a 100 percent President."
He also argued that the impeachment process — rather
than grand jury indictment — is the only way to try a
sitting President.
The court asked for clarification of points made by
both sides. There was no indication on when the court
would rule on the issues.
Eight justices are sitting on the case, William Rehnquist
having disqualified himself because of his former
associations with persons involved in the case.
Presidential spokesman yesterday declined to say
whether Nixon would abide by an adverse ruling on the
tapes question. Republican members of the House
Judiciary Committee have indicated that it would be
"harmful" to the President if he refused to abide by such
an order.
Over 300 persons lined up outside the Supreme Court

to try to get a seat at the hearings. The first 120 were
admitted.
Large Victory For Liberal Trudeau
OTTAWA — Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau
won a surprisingly large victory in national elections
yesterday.
By 10 p.m. yesterday evening, Trudeau's Liberal party
had won enough seats for an absolute majority in
Parliament. Trudeau had 136 seats firmly won, with the
opposition Progressive Conservatives holding only 92 in
the 264-seat Parliament.
Conservative leader Robert Stanfield conceded defeat.
His future at the helm of the party is uncertain. Stanfield
based his campaign almost solely on the anti-inflation
platform.
The Liberals have held power since 1962, but for the
last two years, have been a minority government.
The Liberals lost power when leader David Lewis of the
left-wing New Democratic Party withdrew support for
Trudeau. Lewis lost his seat in Parliament in his home
district of Toronto yesterday.
Both Trudeau, from Quebec, and Stanfield, from Nova
Scotia, were re-elected by large margins.
Meanwhile, in Tokyo, unofficial returns indicated that
Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka's government may be eight
seats short of a parliamentary majority after elections on
Sunday.
It is unclear whether Tanaka will be able to form a
coalition in order to retain power.
Colson To Jail, Will Testify Friday
McLEAN, Va. — Former White House aide Charles
Colson left his home yesterday to begin serving a jail
sentence.
He announced that he would offer new information to
the House Judiciary Committee when he testifies on
Watergate-related matters on Friday."
Colson is serving a one-to-three year sentence for
obstruction of justice. In other Watergate-related matters,
Federal Judge Gehrard Gesell ordered Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger to testify for the defense in the Ellsberg
break-in trial of former White House aide John

Ehrlichman. Kissinger is expected to appear tomorrow.
Today, the House Judiciary committee is expected to
make public a comparison between the White House tapes
transcripts and the transcripts made by the committee
staff.
Perry Loses Bid For 16th
OAKLAND — The Oakland A's snapped the 15-game
winning streak of Cleveland's Gaylord Perry last night,
beating Perry's Indians 4-3 in 10 innings before over
47,000 delighted spectators.
The A's won the game on a single by 19-year-old
Claudell Washington in the bottom of the 10th.
Perry is now 15-2. Had he won the game, he would
have tied the American League record for most
consecutive games won.
Facelifting For Fisherman's Wharf
SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Joseph Alioto yesterday
unveiled a $6.7 million plan designed to restore
authenticity to San Francisco's famed Fisherman's Wharf.
The mayor divulged the plan and vowed to lead the
effort after receiving a report from a citizen's committee.
The report quoted descriptions of the wharf as "a carnival
of cheap sideshows."
Alioto hopes to raise up to 85 percent of the funds
from Federal sources. The new plan includes building of
new mooring facilities, a breakwater and reconstruction of
Hyde Street Pier.
Today's Weather
An unusual winter-type storm hit the San Francisco
Bay Area yesterday, and dumped enough rain to make it
the wettest July day in the history of the City.
Some areas were hit with more than one inch of
rainfall. San Francisco got .83 inches. The storm may have
a destructive effect on portions of California's peach crop,
which is due for harvest next week.
Continued showers are possible today. Variable
cloudiness is expected, with highs in the high 60s to low
80s. Low tonight in the 50s.

SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Joseph Alioto yesterday
unveiled a $6.7 million plan designed to restore
authenticity to San Francisco's famed Fisherman's Wharf.
The mayor divulged the plan and vowed to lead the
effort after receiving a report from a citizen's committee.
The report quoted descriptions of the wharf as "a carnival
of cheap sideshows."
Alioto hopes to raise up to 85 percent of the funds
from Federal sources. The new plan includes building of
new mooring facilities, a breakwater and reconstruction of
Hyde Street Pier.
Today's Weather
An unusual winter-type storm hit the San Francisco
Bay Area yesterday, and dumped enough rain to make it
the wettest July day in the history of the City.
Some areas were hit with more than one inch of
rainfall. San Francisco got .83 inches. The storm may have
a destructive effect on portions of California's peach crop,
which is due for harvest next week.
Continued showers are possible today. Variable
cloudiness is expected, with highs in the high 60s to low
80s. Low tonight in the 50s.
High Court Hears U.S. vs. Nixon
WASHINGTON — The long-awaited court battle
entitled United States of America vs. Richard Nixon began
yesterday.
The Supreme Court heard opening arguments from
Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski's office and
the President's defense lawyers for three hours. The court
has been asked to determine whether Nixon must
surrender tapes subpoenaed by the Prosecutor's office.
The Court also heard arguments in the companion case,
Richard Nixon vs. United States of America. Nixon claims
he cannot be named an unindicted co-conspirator in the
Watergate cover-up.
The prosecution said yesterday that Nixon cannot
claim executive privilege in withholding the tapes because
there is evidence that the President was part of a criminal
conspiracy.
Assistant Prosecutor Philip Lacovara said the
prosecution has already adequately demonstrated that the
taped conversations were held "in furtherance of a
criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States and
obstruct justice."
But White House lawyer James St. Clair argued that
Jaworski's authority as a special prosecutor does not give
him any power to interpret the validity of a President's
claim of executive privilege.
He said Jaworski's order would make Nixon "an 85
percent President instead of a 100 percent President."
He also argued that the impeachment process — rather
than grand jury indictment — is the only way to try a
sitting President.
The court asked for clarification of points made by
both sides. There was no indication on when the court
would rule on the issues.
Eight justices are sitting on the case, William Rehnquist
having disqualified himself because of his former
associations with persons involved in the case.
Presidential spokesman yesterday declined to say
whether Nixon would abide by an adverse ruling on the
tapes question. Republican members of the House
Judiciary Committee have indicated that it would be
"harmful" to the President if he refused to abide by such
an order.
Over 300 persons lined up outside the Supreme Court

to try to get a seat at the hearings. The first 120 were
admitted.
Large Victory For Liberal Trudeau
OTTAWA — Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau
won a surprisingly large victory in national elections
yesterday.
By 10 p.m. yesterday evening, Trudeau's Liberal party
had won enough seats for an absolute majority in
Parliament. Trudeau had 136 seats firmly won, with the
opposition Progressive Conservatives holding only 92 in
the 264-seat Parliament.
Conservative leader Robert Stanfield conceded defeat.
His future at the helm of the party is uncertain. Stanfield
based his campaign almost solely on the anti-inflation
platform.
The Liberals have held power since 1962, but for the
last two years, have been a minority government.
The Liberals lost power when leader David Lewis of the
left-wing New Democratic Party withdrew support for
Trudeau. Lewis lost his seat in Parliament in his home
district of Toronto yesterday.
Both Trudeau, from Quebec, and Stanfield, from Nova
Scotia, were re-elected by large margins.
Meanwhile, in Tokyo, unofficial returns indicated that
Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka's government may be eight
seats short of a parliamentary majority after elections on
Sunday.
It is unclear whether Tanaka will be able to form a
coalition in order to retain power.
Colson To Jail, Will Testify Friday
McLEAN, Va. — Former White House aide Charles
Colson left his home yesterday to begin serving a jail
sentence.
He announced that he would offer new information to
the House Judiciary Committee when he testifies on
Watergate-related matters on Friday."
Colson is serving a one-to-three year sentence for
obstruction of justice. In other Watergate-related matters,
Federal Judge Gehrard Gesell ordered Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger to testify for the defense in the Ellsberg
break-in trial of former White House aide John

Ehrlichman. Kissinger is expected to appear tomorrow.
Today, the House Judiciary committee is expected to
make public a comparison between the White House tapes
transcripts and the transcripts made by the committee
staff.
Perry Loses Bid For 16th
OAKLAND — The Oakland A's snapped the 15-game
winning streak of Cleveland's Gaylord Perry last night,
beating Perry's Indians 4-3 in 10 innings before over
47,000 delighted spectators.
The A's won the game on a single by 19-year-old
Claudell Washington in the bottom of the 10th.
Perry is now 15-2. Had he won the game, he would

Perry Loses Bid For 16th
OAKLAND — The Oakland A's snapped the 15-game
winning streak of Cleveland's Gaylord Perry last night,
beating Perry's Indians 4-3 in 10 innings before over
47,000 delighted spectators.
The A's won the game on a single by 19-year-old
Claudell Washington in the bottom of the 10th.
Perry is now 15-2. Had he won the game, he would
have tied the American League record for most
consecutive games won.
Facelifting For Fisherman's Wharf
SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Joseph Alioto yesterday
unveiled a $6.7 million plan designed to restore
authenticity to San Francisco's famed Fisherman's Wharf.
The mayor divulged the plan and vowed to lead the
effort after receiving a report from a citizen's committee.
The report quoted descriptions of the wharf as "a carnival
of cheap sideshows."
Alioto hopes to raise up to 85 percent of the funds
from Federal sources. The new plan includes building of
new mooring facilities, a breakwater and reconstruction of
Hyde Street Pier.
Today's Weather
An unusual winter-type storm hit the San Francisco
Bay Area yesterday, and dumped enough rain to make it
the wettest July day in the history of the City.
Some areas were hit with more than one inch of
rainfall. San Francisco got .83 inches. The storm may have
a destructive effect on portions of California's peach crop,
which is due for harvest next week.
Continued showers are possible today. Variable
cloudiness is expected, with highs in the high 60s to low
80s. Low tonight in the 50s.
High Court Hears U.S. vs. Nixon
WASHINGTON — The long-awaited court battle
entitled United States of America vs. Richard Nixon began
yesterday.
The Supreme Court heard opening arguments from
Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski's office and
the President's defense lawyers for three hours. The court
has been asked to determine whether Nixon must
surrender tapes subpoenaed by the Prosecutor's office.
The Court also heard arguments in the companion case,
Richard Nixon vs. United States of America. Nixon claims
he cannot be named an unindicted co-conspirator in the
Watergate cover-up.
The prosecution said yesterday that Nixon cannot
claim executive privilege in withholding the tapes because
there is evidence that the President was part of a criminal
conspiracy.
Assistant Prosecutor Philip Lacovara said the
prosecution has already adequately demonstrated that the
taped conversations were held "in furtherance of a
criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States and
obstruct justice."
But White House lawyer James St. Clair argued that
Jaworski's authority as a special prosecutor does not give
him any power to interpret the validity of a President's
claim of executive privilege.
He said Jaworski's order would make Nixon "an 85
percent President instead of a 100 percent President."
He also argued that the impeachment process — rather
than grand jury indictment — is the only way to try a
sitting President.
The court asked for clarification of points made by
both sides. There was no indication on when the court
would rule on the issues.
Eight justices are sitting on the case, William Rehnquist
having disqualified himself because of his former
associations with persons involved in the case.
Presidential spokesman yesterday declined to say
whether Nixon would abide by an adverse ruling on the
tapes question. Republican members of the House
Judiciary Committee have indicated that it would be
"harmful" to the President if he refused to abide by such
an order.
Over 300 persons lined up outside the Supreme Court

to try to get a seat at the hearings. The first 120 were
admitted.
Large Victory For Liberal Trudeau
OTTAWA — Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau
won a surprisingly large victory in national elections
yesterday.
By 10 p.m. yesterday evening, Trudeau's Liberal party
had won enough seats for an absolute majority in
Parliament. Trudeau had 136 seats firmly won, with the
opposition Progressive Conservatives holding only 92 in
the 264-seat Parliament.
Conservative leader Robert Stanfield conceded defeat.
His future at the helm of the party is uncertain. Stanfield
based his campaign almost solely on the anti-inflation
platform.
The Liberals have held power since 1962, but for the
last two years, have been a minority government.
The Liberals lost power when leader David Lewis of the
left-wing New Democratic Party withdrew support for
Trudeau. Lewis lost his seat in Parliament in his home
district of Toronto yesterday.
Both Trudeau, from Quebec, and Stanfield, from Nova
Scotia, were re-elected by large margins.
Meanwhile, in Tokyo, unofficial returns indicated that
Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka's government may be eight
seats short of a parliamentary majority after elections on
Sunday.
It is unclear whether Tanaka will be able to form a
coalition in order to retain power.
Colson To Jail, Will Testify Friday
McLEAN, Va. — Former White House aide Charles
Colson left his home yesterday to begin serving a jail
sentence.
