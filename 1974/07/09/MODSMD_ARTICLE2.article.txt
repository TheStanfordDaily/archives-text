# Nurses Continue Negotiations
## 
### 
The strike by registered nurses against the Stanford Hospital moved
into its second week today as the hospital worked to further reduce
its patient load.
The 618-bed hospital, normally filled close to capacity, had 90
patients on hand late yesterday. The pediatries ward was also closed
yesterday, a hospital spokesperson said.
The Committee for the Recognition of Nursing Achievements
(CRONA), representing the hospital's 714 registered nurses and the
hospital reported no progress in their contract negotiations.
CRONA is asking for a 16 percent wage boost. The hospital has
offered a 12 percent raise. Negotiations are scheduled for this
afternoon.
About 40 nurses are currently staffing the hospital. Half of those
are striking nurses since CRONA has agreed to help staff critical care
areas.
The hospital's 12 percent offer would cost the hospital $950,000
annually, administrators have estimated. CRONA's wage demand is
hased on a comparison of salaries received by nurses at Stanford and
the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco.
