# Cancer Patient Dies; Laetrile Suit Filed
## 
### 
By 808 ZUCKERMAN
A Los Altos woman
undergoing treatment for cancer
with the controversial drug,
Laetrile, died early Sunday, but
up until the end she praised the
drug for its effectiveness in
combatting her disease.
A former patient at the
Stanford Hospital, Josephine
Bergman was 48. The cause of her
death is unknown, pending an
autopsy.
Meanwhile, a suit was filed
yesterday in Santa Clara County
Superior Court in San Jose against
the Stanford Hospital and the
State Department of Health on
behalf of 170 plaintiffs. Bergman
is listed as a plaintiff.
The suit seeks to lift as
unconstitutional a ban on Laetrile
as a cancer treatment. The State
Department of Health adopted
the ban in 1963.
Bergman said earlier that

"Easter Sunday (April 14) was my
deadline" for dying, according to
several doctors. She maintained
that Laetrile had helped her
survive past that date.
Three More Months Together
Her husband, James Bergman,
a salesman for an electrical firm,
agreed saying, 'There's no doubt
in my mind. Dr. Jones gave me
and my wife three more months
together."
Stewart M. Jones, a Palo Alto
physician, originally diagnosed
Mrs. Bergman's cancer in January,
1973 and began administering
doses of Laetrile to her. He is
currently under investigation by
the State Board of Medical
Examiners for dispensing the
drug.
Also known as Vitamin 817,
Laetrile is a substance made from
apricot and peach pits. Although
banned for use in treating cancer
in California and many other

states, it is approved for use in
California as a diet supplement.
The plait.tiffs say Laetrile is
not harmful and helps the
functions of the heart, blood
system, lungs, bowels and other
parts of the body.
Plaintiffs For Jones
The suit against the hospital
states that each plaintiff and
health department is a person
who:
— "Now has, or in the past
had, or is closely related to
persons who have had, cancer;
— "Does now use and will in
future continue to use Laetrile,
and
— "Is presently, or will in
future in the event of illness,
become a patient of | Jones]."
The plaintiffs also maintain
that if they do become seriously
ill, they will have to be admitted
to the Stanford Hospital, "which
is the only hospital or other
medical facility wherein said
doctor [Jones] has physician's
staff privileges."
No Degenerative Diseases
The suit also states that "each
plaintiff is of the conscientious
belief that a human body which is
properly nourished will not incur
degenerative disease, and that
where degenerative disease is
present, the body itself will
control or eliminate the disease
whenever the normal metabolic
balance is restored through the
administration of essential
vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and
in some cases, hormones."
The suit adds that 100
petitioners, including Mrs.
Bergman asked the state health
department to repeal the ban on
Laetrile for use in fighting cancer
three months ago, but the
department refused to cancel the
ban or hold a public hearing on
the subject.
Surgeon Approved Laetrile
Dr. William Fielder of Palo
Alto operated on Mrs. Bergman
for cancer in early January at the
Stanford Hospital where she
remained for seven weeks. At first
Fielder approved her Laetrile
treatment, which Jones had
prescribed.
However, officials at the
hospital refused to allow Jones to
continue administering the drug
to Mrs. Bergman while she was
still at the hospital.
Mrs. Bergman filed suit in
Santa Clara County Superior
Court in hopes of forcing the
hospital to allow her to receive
Laetrile, while she was there, but
Judge John Mclnerny refused to
order the hospital to change its
position.
Mrs. Bergman got around the
hospital's ban for ten days late in
March by having her husband
drive her to Jones's office for
treatment. She was finally
discharged from the hospital, but
continued to receive Laetrile up
until her death.
Final Dose
According to Mr. Bergman,
both Jones and Fielder gave her
only 24 hours to live last Tuesday
night. Jones then gave her a triple
dose of Laetrile.
Mr. Bergman added that the
following morning, she felt "100
percent better." She lived more
than four days longer.
Mrs. Bergman was a native of
Chicago and lived there until
1957, when she loved to Los
Altos.
She is survived by her husband;
two sons, Gilbert Bergman and

Gregory Bergman, both of Los
Altos; her mother, Elizabeth
Berger of Chicago; six brothers,
and five sisters.
Funeral services will be held at
three p.m. today at the Los Altos
Chapel of Spangler Mortuary.
Interment will be in Alta Mesa
Memorial Cemetery. The family
prefers memorials in the form of
donations to the Friends of
Freedom Cancer Fund.
