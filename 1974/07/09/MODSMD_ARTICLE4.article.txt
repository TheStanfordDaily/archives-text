Apology
Editor:
The July 2 issue of the Daily
contained an article by Peter
Tiersma relating the difficulties he
encountered when attempting to
participate in the Baccalaureate
ceremony this year. He believes he
is due an apology for the way he
was treated.
I agree with him and extend
my apologies on behalf of the
University for the
misunderstanding which seriously
inconvenienced him that day. He
should not have been told he
could not march in the
Baccalaureate procession. A
misunderstanding on the part of
the volunteer marshal was
responsible for the problem.
For the record, naturally we
prefer students to participate in
Baccalaureate and
Commencement wearing academic
dress. Nonetheless, we recognize
the individual's right to select his
own style of dress and believe he
will do so within the bounds of
good taste.
While apologies cannot recreate
the experience in a most pleasant
manner, I hope Mr. Tiersma will
accept ours most sincerely.

First Impressions
Editor:
My first week at Stanford
University has seemed like ten, as
to the many impressions I have
received: friendliness — a student

going with me to point out my
destination; courtesy — people
quietly waiting fifteen minutes in
a queue at the post office;
democracy — no library privileges
for spouses of visiting professors;
cooperation — the issuance of
audit cards by the business office;
concern — the soliciting of
donations for the education of
black children; selectivity —
people dipping into classes to
taste various offerings; fairness —
the book store allowance for
return of books that will not be
used.
After painfully making up my
mind concerning the class for my
needs, I decided to return four
course books. Before doing so, I
dipped into them and got caught.
From James, I could see how my
own actions cause me to make the
same mistakes over and over
again; from Hawthorne, how I
have come to accept the comfort
of the church without the
exhilaration of pain and of
struggle; from Melville, the
Satanic in my own single-minded
drive for dominance; from
Longfellow, the tragedy of people
without a country and the policies
of nation states that make
refugees, even from our own
shores to Sweden and Canada.
So, I am several dollars poorer
and many times richer. Stanford
University, thank you and your
visiting professors for the week of
education that I have already
experienced. It is just great to be
here.
