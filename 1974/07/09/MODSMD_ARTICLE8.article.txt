# Hewlett Resigned Too Late
##

The Stanford Daily of July 2 had an article on
the departure of William Hewlett of
Hewlett-Packard from the Stanford University
board of trustees.
The article mentioned that Hewlett's connection
with war-related industries made him an unpopular
figure in some circles on campus during the 19605.
But a fuller understanding of why Hewlett was
viewed and still is viewed by many people as grossly
immoral can be gained by examining a single
incident. #
On March 11, 1969, a two-hour meeting was
held in Memorial Auditorium in which five
University trustees (including Hewlett) sat on a
panel with seven students (most of whom were
radicals).
The meeting had been called by the University
Advisory Committee — a student, faculty, and
trustee group that is now defunct — in the wake of
a disruption by radicals of an on-campus trustee
meeting earlier in the year.
The meeting was intended to be a general
discussion by the trustees, who hoped to
communicate their views to the students. In this
way, trustees would defuse some of the radical
students' demands for open trustee meetings and
for specific policy changes.
But the trustees were caught off guard by
students on the panel and in the audience who
asked well-researched and probing questions.
In the end, the trustees appeared defensive and
evasive, not at all frank. The radicals, in contrast,
adhered openly and firmly to high moral standards.
Most hypocritical of all was Hewlett's
sanctimonious dissembling on the manufacture of
deadly nerve gas.
In the volatile political atmosphere on the
campus five years ago, this dramatic exchange
involving Hewlett convinced many previously
apolitical Stanford students that the trustees were
not to be trusted:
NICK SKLBY [then a junior from Hinsdale, 111.,
and sportswriter for the Stanford Daily, speaking
from the floor |: I want to see if there is some sort
of credibility gap in this university. SDS [Students
for a Democratic Society | has said that your KMC
| FMC Corp., formerly Food Machinery-
Corporation, of which Hewlett was then and still is
a director] is producing lethal nerve gas. Do you
deny that categorically? And if you don't, then I
really question your humanity If you are the sort

of person who can direct a company which can
make lethal nerve gas, then you're the sort of
person I don't want running my university.
(Applause from the audience.)
WILLIAM HEWLETT: FMC does not make nerve
gas.
PAUL RUPERT [a founder with David Harris of
The Resistance and a non-violent anti-draft and
anti-war activist, speaking from the panel]:
Seymour Hersh, in what I understand is a definitive
study called Chemical and Biological Warfare
attributes the Newport, Indiana chemical plant,
which produces Sarin, a version of nerve gas, to
your corporation; and further checking on that by
David Ransom of the Peninsula Observer [a
now-defunct radical newspaper| got a clarification
and an affirmation from one of the public relations
men in your office in San Jose. So either the book
and your P.R. man are wrong, or in fact it's true.
HEWLETT: I'm amazed by the accuracy and
reliability of your sources, but I happened to check
with the president of EMC, whom I consider
superior to your sources, and he says that they are
not making nerve gas at the present time.
EROM THE ELOOR: Have they ever made nerve
gas?
HEWLETT: The answer is yes. They were asked by
the government to build a plant, which they built
and operated at the request of the government, and
they turned that plant over to the government
about six months ago. (Indignant cries from the
audience.)
Later on in the meeting Hewlett argued that
Stanford University is "an institution of the United
States" and that it is "financed primarily through
United States funds." Therefore. Hewlett thought
that it was appropriate, and not in the least "a
political decision," for Stanford to follow the
foreign policy of the U.S. government and for
Stanford faculty members and students to be
devoting time and research facilities to Defense
Department projects.
William Hewlett should have resigned from
Stanford's board of trustees back in 1969 when
faced with the pressue of popular indidgnation. It
was the complicity of men like Hewlett in enlisting
Stanford in the U.S. government's involvement in
southeast Asia that generated a justifiably
passionate response on campus during the 19605.

meeting earlier in the year.
The meeting was intended to be a general
discussion by the trustees, who hoped to
communicate their views to the students. In this
way, trustees would defuse some of the radical
students' demands for open trustee meetings and
for specific policy changes.
But the trustees were caught off guard by
students on the panel and in the audience who
asked well-researched and probing questions.
In the end, the trustees appeared defensive and
evasive, not at all frank. The radicals, in contrast,
adhered openly and firmly to high moral standards.
Most hypocritical of all was Hewlett's
sanctimonious dissembling on the manufacture of
deadly nerve gas.
In the volatile political atmosphere on the
campus five years ago, this dramatic exchange
involving Hewlett convinced many previously
apolitical Stanford students that the trustees were
not to be trusted:
NICK SKLBY [then a junior from Hinsdale, 111.,
and sportswriter for the Stanford Daily, speaking
from the floor |: I want to see if there is some sort
of credibility gap in this university. SDS [Students
for a Democratic Society | has said that your KMC
| FMC Corp., formerly Food Machinery-
Corporation, of which Hewlett was then and still is
a director] is producing lethal nerve gas. Do you
deny that categorically? And if you don't, then I
really question your humanity If you are the sort

of person who can direct a company which can
make lethal nerve gas, then you're the sort of
person I don't want running my university.
(Applause from the audience.)
WILLIAM HEWLETT: FMC does not make nerve
gas.
PAUL RUPERT [a founder with David Harris of
The Resistance and a non-violent anti-draft and
anti-war activist, speaking from the panel]:
Seymour Hersh, in what I understand is a definitive
study called Chemical and Biological Warfare
attributes the Newport, Indiana chemical plant,
which produces Sarin, a version of nerve gas, to
your corporation; and further checking on that by
David Ransom of the Peninsula Observer [a
now-defunct radical newspaper| got a clarification
and an affirmation from one of the public relations
men in your office in San Jose. So either the book
and your P.R. man are wrong, or in fact it's true.
HEWLETT: I'm amazed by the accuracy and
reliability of your sources, but I happened to check
with the president of EMC, whom I consider
superior to your sources, and he says that they are
not making nerve gas at the present time.
EROM THE ELOOR: Have they ever made nerve
gas?
HEWLETT: The answer is yes. They were asked by
the government to build a plant, which they built
and operated at the request of the government, and
they turned that plant over to the government
about six months ago. (Indignant cries from the
audience.)
Later on in the meeting Hewlett argued that
Stanford University is "an institution of the United
States" and that it is "financed primarily through
United States funds." Therefore. Hewlett thought
that it was appropriate, and not in the least "a
political decision," for Stanford to follow the
foreign policy of the U.S. government and for
Stanford faculty members and students to be
devoting time and research facilities to Defense
Department projects.
William Hewlett should have resigned from
Stanford's board of trustees back in 1969 when
faced with the pressue of popular indidgnation. It
was the complicity of men like Hewlett in enlisting
Stanford in the U.S. government's involvement in
southeast Asia that generated a justifiably
passionate response on campus during the 19605.

The Stanford Daily of July 2 had an article on
the departure of William Hewlett of
Hewlett-Packard from the Stanford University
board of trustees.
The article mentioned that Hewlett's connection
with war-related industries made him an unpopular
figure in some circles on campus during the 19605.
But a fuller understanding of why Hewlett was
viewed and still is viewed by many people as grossly
immoral can be gained by examining a single
incident. #
On March 11, 1969, a two-hour meeting was
held in Memorial Auditorium in which five
University trustees (including Hewlett) sat on a
panel with seven students (most of whom were
radicals).
The meeting had been called by the University
Advisory Committee — a student, faculty, and
trustee group that is now defunct — in the wake of
a disruption by radicals of an on-campus trustee
meeting earlier in the year.
The meeting was intended to be a general
discussion by the trustees, who hoped to
communicate their views to the students. In this
