# Loggins, Messina To Play Despite Rock Moratorium
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The moratorium on rock music
in Frost Ampitheater imposed by
the Committee on Public Events
in 1971 may slowly be on its way
out, signalled by the appearance
of Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina here August 3.
University Public Events
Director Thomas Bacchetti
admitted that the Loggins and
Messina concert "might be a step
in that direction," but reaffirmed
that total elimination of the
moratorium is not imminent.
The University committee
declared a moratorium on rock
concerts in Frost after several
persons were injured at a July 18,
1971 Cold Blood-Elvin Bishop
concert.
The ban since has been
modified to allow softer acts such
as Joan Baez and Gordon
Lightfoot to play in Frost earlier
this year.
Two years ago, there was
speculation the moratorium
would be , lifted or
"circumvented" for the scheduled
appearance of Hot Tuna in July,
1972. Then-ASSU Special Events
Director Ron Shannon termed the
group a "blues" band. However,
Hot Tuna cancelled little more
than a week before their concert
date.
Bacchetti stressed that the
University will continue to
exercise its judgment in imposing

the ban, depending on the concert
producers, the artists and the type
of audience the artists are likely
to draw.
"The word moratorium
suggests a temporary situation,"
he said, adding that his office will
eventually "ease out way out of it
[the moratorium].
'The problem with a
moratorium on rock music is that
rock is a word encompassing a
number of subsections," he said.
"[We want to see that] as much
goes on as is reasonable."
Bacchetti said his office would
consider backing concert
productions for Frost as long as
they were well planned, especially
productions featuring a group that
has successfully performed
outdoors elsewhere.
"I am told Loggins and Messina
are not rock," he said, "and I am
willing to accept that." Bacchetti
said that ASSU Special Events
Director Dan Scher characterized
Loggins and Messina as playing
"mellow blues-oriented stuff."
And I have a considerable amount
of trust in Dan Scher."
ASSU Special Events is
sponsoring the concert.
"We may be taking a risk [with
Loggins and Messina]," Bacchetti
added. But he said his office was
willing to take that risk if it does
indeed exist.
"The odds are that the concert
will be a success," he said,

attributing his favorable outlook
to ASSU Special Events' success
with major concerts in Frost this
year. (Both the Baez and the
Lightfoot concerts were sold out.)
A more peaceful audience is
also expected for Loggins and
Messina, Bacchetti said. A
different type of person is
attracted to that group's softer
music, he commented.
Scher was unavailable for
comment.

persons were injured at a July 18,
1971 Cold Blood-Elvin Bishop
concert.
The ban since has been
modified to allow softer acts such
as Joan Baez and Gordon
Lightfoot to play in Frost earlier
this year.
Two years ago, there was
speculation the moratorium
would be , lifted or
"circumvented" for the scheduled
appearance of Hot Tuna in July,
1972. Then-ASSU Special Events
Director Ron Shannon termed the
group a "blues" band. However,
Hot Tuna cancelled little more
than a week before their concert
date.
Bacchetti stressed that the
University will continue to
exercise its judgment in imposing

the ban, depending on the concert
producers, the artists and the type
of audience the artists are likely
to draw.
"The word moratorium
suggests a temporary situation,"
he said, adding that his office will
eventually "ease out way out of it
[the moratorium].
'The problem with a
moratorium on rock music is that
rock is a word encompassing a
number of subsections," he said.
"[We want to see that] as much
goes on as is reasonable."
Bacchetti said his office would
consider backing concert
productions for Frost as long as
they were well planned, especially
productions featuring a group that
has successfully performed
outdoors elsewhere.
"I am told Loggins and Messina
are not rock," he said, "and I am
willing to accept that." Bacchetti
said that ASSU Special Events
Director Dan Scher characterized
Loggins and Messina as playing
"mellow blues-oriented stuff."
And I have a considerable amount
of trust in Dan Scher."
ASSU Special Events is
sponsoring the concert.
"We may be taking a risk [with
Loggins and Messina]," Bacchetti
added. But he said his office was
willing to take that risk if it does
indeed exist.
"The odds are that the concert
will be a success," he said,

attributing his favorable outlook
to ASSU Special Events' success
with major concerts in Frost this
year. (Both the Baez and the
Lightfoot concerts were sold out.)
A more peaceful audience is
also expected for Loggins and
Messina, Bacchetti said. A
different type of person is
attracted to that group's softer
music, he commented.
Scher was unavailable for
comment.
The moratorium on rock music
in Frost Ampitheater imposed by
the Committee on Public Events
in 1971 may slowly be on its way
out, signalled by the appearance
of Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina here August 3.
University Public Events
Director Thomas Bacchetti
admitted that the Loggins and
Messina concert "might be a step
in that direction," but reaffirmed
that total elimination of the
moratorium is not imminent.
