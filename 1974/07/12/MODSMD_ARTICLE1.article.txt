# Nurses End Strike, Get Two-Year Pact
## 
### DON COX 
Stanford Hospital's registered
nurses will begin returning to
work today after voting
overwhelmingly last night to
approve a new two-year contract
ending their 11 day strike.
The nurses voted 544 to 15 to
accept the agreement which
includes a 15 percent wage
increase for all registered nurses
the first year and a second year
wage boost of 8.5 percent.
Bonnie Johnson, president of
the Committee for the
Recognition of Nursing
Achievements (CRONA)
representing the hospital's 714
registered nurses, said last night
she was "very pleased" with "the
equitable settlement."
Hospital Deputy Director Paul
Hoffman said the contract was "a
fair settlement" which gave the

hospital a competitive market
position, financial stability and
predictability, and avoided the
extraordinary negotiation process
for a year.
Original Demands
CRONA had originally
demanded a 16 percent wage and
one percent benefit increase in a
one year contract. The hospital
responded with a proposed 7.9
percent increase which was
subsequently raised to 9 then 12
and finally 15 percent.
Hospital officials estimated it
will take ten days to build back
the normal case load of patients
which was reduced during the
strike. The 618-bed hospital,
normally filled with over 500
patients this time of year, had
only 72 patients yesterday
morning.
The first year wage increases
will cost the hospital an estimated
$1.2 million. Nurses will also
receive a 0.25 percent benefit
increase the first year.
Cost Less
Hoffman maintained the cost
of the wage increase to the
hospital for the duration of the
two-year contract is slightly less
than 12 percent — the hospital's
previous offer for a one year
contract.
The settlement with the nurses
is partially reflected in an 11.5
percent increase room and service
rates announced yesterday by the
hospital.
The settlement will provide a

new monthly salary range of
$989-$1193 for an experienced
staff nurse during the first year of
the contract. The current range is
$860-$1037.
Valuabe Mediator
Both sides agreed that Edward
Allen of the State Mediation and
Concilliation Service had been
"very valuable" in the
negotiations and one official said
he was "instrumental" in arriving
at the settlement.
CRONA said the new salary
levels would put Stanford nurses
on a level comparable to similar
institutions like the University of
California Medical Center in San
Francisco.
Hoffman said "it has always
been our intention to maintain a
competitive market position."
Hoffman said the hospital's initial
offer was made upon estimates of

this position and was revised as
the market changed.
Hospital officials said they
could not make an estimate of the
dollar cost of the strike to the
hospital but one said it was
"substantial."
