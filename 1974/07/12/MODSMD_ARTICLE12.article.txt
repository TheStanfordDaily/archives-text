# Exploring The Limits Of Longevity
## 
### GLADYS GUNDRUM 
Suppose suddenly we found cures for cancer and heart
disease. Suppose we all ate less, exercised more and kept
our blood pressure down. We'd all live to be 150 at least.
Right?
Not so, says Dr. Leonard Hayflick, a medical
microbiologist at the Medical Center. The human life span
is fixed at about 90 years. And eliminating cancer and
heart disease would increase average life expectancy at
birth by only about 10 years.
He dismisses as hoaxes the recent claims of
super-longevity from isolated communities in Ecuador and
the Soviet Union. Not only are those claims unsupported
by scientific proof, he maintains, but they fuel the image
of research in aging as a psuedoscience practiced by
eccentrics and charlatans.
Hayflick has long been an outspoken advocate of
biological research on aging. Sitting at his desk in his white
lab coat he hardly looks like a hard-boiled activist, but he
speaks with firm conviction.
'Taboo Against Aging'
"We have a taboo about aging — an innate resentment,"
he maintains. "We ghettoize our elderly and treat their
problems symptomatically." We must try to understand
the basis of aging, he says.
It is unlikely that Hayflick will give up easily on this
issue. He is already well-experienced in trying to get his
views accepted.
Twelve years ago his now well-known discovery that
normal human and animal cells have a finite lifespan was
viewed as heresy. His report was rejected by one of the
most prestigious biomedical journals because it challenged
the "fact" that cells were inherently capable of
multiplying indefinitely.
Abnormal Cells
It has since been shown that this behavior characterizes
only abnormal cells. As a person gets older normal cells
will divide fewer times. A normal fetal cell, for example,
divides about 50 times before dying while in a young adult
it can divide only 20 to 30 times.
Hayflick also carried on a 10-year battle with the
federal government to permit use of human cells in the
production of vaccines. His opposition included such
notables as Albert Sabin of polio vaccine fame. Hayflick
argued that replacing the animal cells then in use would
result in a safer, cheaper vaccine.
Today more than 60 percent of the world's supply of
polio vaccines are produced from a strain of human cells
Hayflick keeps in his laboratory. These cells, which are the
longest preserved cells in the world, have been frozen in
the super-cold of liquid nitrogen for 12 years.
Gerontology
Convinced that the science of aging, or gerontology, is
the key to any "fountain of youth," Hayflick is wary of
the Pandora's box it may open. 'The goal of gerontology
should be extending the time of vigorous and productive
years," he says. "What value is immortality if we merely
extend our infirmities?"

Hayflick has already demonstrated that a cell's aging
process can be suspended by freezing the cell. A
reconstituted cell simply takes up where it left off and
continues its predetermined doubling.
For the present, claims of cadaver preservation are just
another hoax because the necessary chemicals cannot yet
penetrate large cell masses. But Hayflick does not rule out
"the Rip van Winkle effect" when someday we may be
able to arrest our life cycles at any point with the
certainty of future revival.
Hayflick does not believe that aging is due to the finite
lifespan of cells. There is a certain probability of a mistake
each time cells divide and he suggests that normal cells
cease dividing before reaching their finite lifespan because
of an accumulation of such errors.
It also may be that the genetic material is played out or
that aging genes express themselves. Whatever the
mechanism, Hayflick believes that the living and dying of

cells is the basis of human living and dying.
But all of this will continue to be speculation unless
gerontology receives funding and can attract researchers.
Recognition of gerontology as a field is so recent that few
universities have even considered offering courses about it.
"This is hard to understand because aging is as universal
as genetics or evolution," says Hayflick. He will offer
Stanford's first course in gerontology next fall with an
undergraduate seminar on the biology of aging.
Hayflick adds that no real progress can be made
without government support. Despite official rhetoric
about aiding the aged, the current administration considers
gerontological research as "something between a nuisance
and a joke," he says.
Lack of Government Support
Last year the government spent about two dollars per
person on cancer research, one dollar per person on
cardiovascular research and only three cents per person on
all research in gerontology, he notes. He maintains that
because of a lack of government support "the field like the
subject it studies is near death."
Acting on his views, Hayflick has joined the battle to
push for a bill establishing a National Institute on Aging.
Passage of the legislation would acknowledge government
interest and provide gerontology a degree of
independence. Last year the President pocket-vetoed such
a bill.
If this year's bill meets a similar fate, Hayflick has
promised to help spearhead a mass letter-writing campaign
protesting the action.
With his past victories, it is unlikely that Hayflick will
be deterred. If he doesn't win this time, the government
may be in for a long fight.

advocate of biological research on aging, maintains that
such research might realistically increase our number of
vigorous and productive years.
