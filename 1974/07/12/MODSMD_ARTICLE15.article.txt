# Cat Stevens' World Tour
## Genius At The Coliseum 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
New music
Sweet music can lighten us
Can brighten the world
Can save us
OAKLAND — Somewhere out
on the edge of darkness, Cat
Stevens proved the truth of his
own lyrics last week. A sell-out
crowd at the Coliseum-Arena
witnessed one of the most
delightful and well-balanced
performances to hit the Bay Area
in too many months.
Stevens opened the show with
a few songs from his earliest
albums, including "Wild World,"
"Longer Boats," and "Sitting,"
before switching to material from
his latest albums, Buddha and The
Chocolate Box and Foreigner.
Remember the good old days
when fans screamed at concerts?
Hard as it was for this reviewer to
believe, some of the fans were
screaming as they recognized a
favorite song, and many people
were singing along with Stevens.
"It's good to be back, uh,
especially good to be back in San
Francisco," said Stevens in
reference to his recent concerts in
Japan.
"I almost said it's good to be
back in the United States," he
further mused, "but it is good to

be back."
With that, Stevens launched
into the single from his most
recent album, "Oh Very Young,"
again eliciting screams from the
crowd.
Unfortunately, Stevens then
played only half of "Foreigner
Suite," a piece which has been
heavily criticized by many
reviewers as not being "Cat
Stevens," a reference to the fact
that the piece is more heavily
instrumented and more driving
than Stevens' earlier work.
However, it was on "Foreigner
Suite" that Stevens first assumed
his post behind the keys of a
grand piano, strangely equipped
with a huge key like a child's
wind-up toy. And Stevens put so
much enthusiasm into the piece
that he looked almost like a kid
about to bounce right off his
piano bench.
The name Cat is incredibly apt.
Stevens' body is muscled but
graceful, and every fiber of it
seems attached to the keyboard of
the big piano. Stevens embellishes
"Foreigner Suite" and makes this
performance of it something more
than the original, which is itself
the highest refinement of Stevens'
accomplishments as arranger and
composer.
Stevens went back to center
stage behind guitar and mike and
finished out the first portion of
the concert with "Hard-Headed
Woman," "Moonshadow," and
"How Can I Tell You," the latter
drawing sighs and respectful dead
silence from the audience.
The middle portion of the
program featured Linda Lewis, a
singer who is half Betty Boop and
might be called a less talented
version of Melba Moore. Backing
anyone else she might have been
tolerable, but the question etched
in many minds throughout her set
was, "Why the hell is she up there
instead of Cat?"
Lewis sang in a sort of baby
talk that was totally
incomprehensible even from the

ninth row; she also screeched out
some incredible high scat singing
which was physically painful. As
one observer put it, she has
"tremendous range; too bad only
the middle third of it is real
voice."
When Stevens returned to
rescue his 10,000, he walked
immediately to the piano and
played "King of Trees" from
Buddha, and followed it up with
one of the night's better numbers,
"Music," again nearly bouncing
off his bench.
Returning to the guitar, he
performed "Father and Son"
from Tea For The Tillerman,
which proved to be another one
of the "ahhh" songs, a collective
sigh coming from the crowd.
All of a sudden, without
introduction, Stevens was singing
about the edge of darkness and
keyboardman Jean Roussel had
the whole audience stomping and
clapping, and three security
guards were pushing people back
up the center aisle toward their
seats; in short, what had been a
very mellow crowd went bananas.
Later, many people would say,
"You know, up until then I never
really liked 'Peace Train,' but
when I saw him singing it. .
Through "18th Avenue" the
crowd settled down, just in time
for Stevens to break things open
again with "Bitterblue": more
stomping and clapping and
singing, after which Stevens
foolishly tried to leave the stage.
The formerly dark arena lit up
with matches held high and
sparklers and even firecrackers,
and Stevens returned to sing his
next single, a rolicking number
called "Saturday Night." Again he
tried to leave, and again he
returned.
A new version of "Angelsea"
might have closed the show, but
Stevens followed it with a nearly
solo version of "Sad Lisa,"
finishing almost collapsed in an
eloquent lunge at the keyboard
that quietly, simply, ended a night
with one of pop music's geniuses.

Suite," a piece which has been
heavily criticized by many
reviewers as not being "Cat
Stevens," a reference to the fact
that the piece is more heavily
instrumented and more driving
than Stevens' earlier work.
However, it was on "Foreigner
Suite" that Stevens first assumed
his post behind the keys of a
grand piano, strangely equipped
with a huge key like a child's
wind-up toy. And Stevens put so
much enthusiasm into the piece
that he looked almost like a kid
about to bounce right off his
piano bench.
The name Cat is incredibly apt.
Stevens' body is muscled but
graceful, and every fiber of it
seems attached to the keyboard of
the big piano. Stevens embellishes
"Foreigner Suite" and makes this
performance of it something more
than the original, which is itself
the highest refinement of Stevens'
accomplishments as arranger and
composer.
Stevens went back to center
stage behind guitar and mike and
finished out the first portion of
the concert with "Hard-Headed
Woman," "Moonshadow," and
"How Can I Tell You," the latter
drawing sighs and respectful dead
silence from the audience.
The middle portion of the
program featured Linda Lewis, a
singer who is half Betty Boop and
might be called a less talented
version of Melba Moore. Backing
anyone else she might have been
tolerable, but the question etched
in many minds throughout her set
was, "Why the hell is she up there
instead of Cat?"
Lewis sang in a sort of baby
talk that was totally
incomprehensible even from the

ninth row; she also screeched out
some incredible high scat singing
which was physically painful. As
one observer put it, she has
"tremendous range; too bad only
the middle third of it is real
voice."
When Stevens returned to
rescue his 10,000, he walked
immediately to the piano and
played "King of Trees" from
Buddha, and followed it up with
one of the night's better numbers,
"Music," again nearly bouncing
off his bench.
Returning to the guitar, he
performed "Father and Son"
from Tea For The Tillerman,
which proved to be another one
of the "ahhh" songs, a collective
sigh coming from the crowd.
All of a sudden, without
introduction, Stevens was singing
about the edge of darkness and
keyboardman Jean Roussel had
the whole audience stomping and
clapping, and three security
guards were pushing people back
up the center aisle toward their
seats; in short, what had been a
very mellow crowd went bananas.
Later, many people would say,
"You know, up until then I never
really liked 'Peace Train,' but
when I saw him singing it. .
Through "18th Avenue" the
crowd settled down, just in time
for Stevens to break things open
again with "Bitterblue": more
stomping and clapping and
singing, after which Stevens
foolishly tried to leave the stage.
The formerly dark arena lit up
with matches held high and
sparklers and even firecrackers,
and Stevens returned to sing his
next single, a rolicking number
called "Saturday Night." Again he
tried to leave, and again he
returned.
A new version of "Angelsea"
might have closed the show, but
Stevens followed it with a nearly
solo version of "Sad Lisa,"
finishing almost collapsed in an
eloquent lunge at the keyboard
that quietly, simply, ended a night
with one of pop music's geniuses.

MOONSHADOW MAGICIAN — Cat Stevens, seen here singing
"Moonshadow," gave two encores before Oakland Coliseum heavies
turned on the lights last week. More than 10,000 fans greeted Cat
with everything from screams to firecrackers.
New music
Sweet music can lighten us
Can brighten the world
Can save us
OAKLAND — Somewhere out
on the edge of darkness, Cat
Stevens proved the truth of his
own lyrics last week. A sell-out
crowd at the Coliseum-Arena
witnessed one of the most
delightful and well-balanced
performances to hit the Bay Area
in too many months.
Stevens opened the show with
a few songs from his earliest
albums, including "Wild World,"
"Longer Boats," and "Sitting,"
before switching to material from
his latest albums, Buddha and The
Chocolate Box and Foreigner.
Remember the good old days
when fans screamed at concerts?
Hard as it was for this reviewer to
believe, some of the fans were
screaming as they recognized a
favorite song, and many people
were singing along with Stevens.
"It's good to be back, uh,
especially good to be back in San
Francisco," said Stevens in
reference to his recent concerts in
Japan.
"I almost said it's good to be
back in the United States," he
further mused, "but it is good to

be back."
With that, Stevens launched
into the single from his most
recent album, "Oh Very Young,"
again eliciting screams from the
crowd.

played only half of "Foreigner

heavily criticized by many
reviewers as not being "Cat

tolerable, but the question etched
in many minds throughout her set
was, "Why the hell is she up there
instead of Cat?"
Lewis sang in a sort of baby
talk that was totally
incomprehensible even from the

ninth row; she also screeched out
some incredible high scat singing
which was physically painful. As
one observer put it, she has
"tremendous range; too bad only
the middle third of it is real
voice."
When Stevens returned to
rescue his 10,000, he walked
immediately to the piano and
played "King of Trees" from
Buddha, and followed it up with
one of the night's better numbers,
"Music," again nearly bouncing
off his bench.
Returning to the guitar, he
performed "Father and Son"
from Tea For The Tillerman,
which proved to be another one
of the "ahhh" songs, a collective
sigh coming from the crowd.
All of a sudden, without
introduction, Stevens was singing
about the edge of darkness and
keyboardman Jean Roussel had
the whole audience stomping and
clapping, and three security
guards were pushing people back
up the center aisle toward their
seats; in short, what had been a
very mellow crowd went bananas.
Later, many people would say,
"You know, up until then I never
really liked 'Peace Train,' but
when I saw him singing it. .
Through "18th Avenue" the
crowd settled down, just in time
for Stevens to break things open
again with "Bitterblue": more
stomping and clapping and
singing, after which Stevens
foolishly tried to leave the stage.
The formerly dark arena lit up
with matches held high and
sparklers and even firecrackers,
and Stevens returned to sing his
next single, a rolicking number
called "Saturday Night." Again he
tried to leave, and again he
returned.
A new version of "Angelsea"
might have closed the show, but
Stevens followed it with a nearly
solo version of "Sad Lisa,"
finishing almost collapsed in an
eloquent lunge at the keyboard
that quietly, simply, ended a night
with one of pop music's geniuses.

MOONSHADOW MAGICIAN — Cat Stevens, seen here singing
"Moonshadow," gave two encores before Oakland Coliseum heavies
turned on the lights last week. More than 10,000 fans greeted Cat
with everything from screams to firecrackers.
New music
Sweet music can lighten us
Can brighten the world
Can save us
OAKLAND — Somewhere out
on the edge of darkness, Cat
Stevens proved the truth of his
own lyrics last week. A sell-out
crowd at the Coliseum-Arena
witnessed one of the most
delightful and well-balanced
performances to hit the Bay Area
in too many months.
Stevens opened the show with
a few songs from his earliest
albums, including "Wild World,"
"Longer Boats," and "Sitting,"
before switching to material from
his latest albums, Buddha and The
Chocolate Box and Foreigner.
Remember the good old days
when fans screamed at concerts?
Hard as it was for this reviewer to
believe, some of the fans were
screaming as they recognized a
favorite song, and many people
were singing along with Stevens.
"It's good to be back, uh,
especially good to be back in San
Francisco," said Stevens in
reference to his recent concerts in
Japan.
"I almost said it's good to be
back in the United States," he
further mused, "but it is good to

be back."
With that, Stevens launched
into the single from his most
recent album, "Oh Very Young,"
again eliciting screams from the
crowd.
Unfortunately, Stevens then
played only half of "Foreigner
Suite," a piece which has been
heavily criticized by many
reviewers as not being "Cat
Stevens," a reference to the fact
that the piece is more heavily
instrumented and more driving
than Stevens' earlier work.
However, it was on "Foreigner
Suite" that Stevens first assumed
his post behind the keys of a
grand piano, strangely equipped
with a huge key like a child's
wind-up toy. And Stevens put so
much enthusiasm into the piece
that he looked almost like a kid
about to bounce right off his
piano bench.
The name Cat is incredibly apt.
Stevens' body is muscled but
graceful, and every fiber of it
seems attached to the keyboard of
the big piano. Stevens embellishes
"Foreigner Suite" and makes this
performance of it something more
than the original, which is itself
the highest refinement of Stevens'
accomplishments as arranger and
composer.
Stevens went back to center
stage behind guitar and mike and
finished out the first portion of
the concert with "Hard-Headed
Woman," "Moonshadow," and
"How Can I Tell You," the latter
drawing sighs and respectful dead
silence from the audience.
The middle portion of the
program featured Linda Lewis, a
singer who is half Betty Boop and
might be called a less talented
version of Melba Moore. Backing
anyone else she might have been
tolerable, but the question etched
in many minds throughout her set
was, "Why the hell is she up there
instead of Cat?"
Lewis sang in a sort of baby
talk that was totally
incomprehensible even from the

ninth row; she also screeched out
some incredible high scat singing
which was physically painful. As
