# 'Gay Church' Examines Spiritual Conflict
## 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
The Boys In The Band, the
poignant play made into a movie
about homosexuality before the
days of the gay pride movement,
ends with a comment on the
central character's spiritual
loneliness; the fact that although
he knows intellectually he cannot
be practicing unconfessed
homosexual fornication and be a
Catholic in good standing, he still
feels a strong sense of
identification with the church and
considers the mass a form of
catharsis.
Mr. Madame, the classic
account of homosexual life in the
same era, by Kenneth Marlowe,
also records great striving for
religious liberation and a desire to
overcome the flesh through
religious practice which ultimately
ended in failure.
A personal friend who went
the gay route for a time after
dropping out of seminary has
observed he feels there is an
inordinantly high percentage of
once-practicing or even
still-practicing Christians in the
gay scene. These are a few
indications of an apparent affinity
of homosexuals toward religion,
an affinity that is not hard to
imagine. Boys who are not
physically oriented may gravitate
toward spiritual interests. The
church places more emphasis on
at least one form of brotherly love
than other instituions.
Violates Mystique
Jesus has often been falsely
depicted as effeminate, and some
liberals have even advanced the
hypothesis that he was a

homosexual. The passive,
turn-the-other-cheek meekness
taught in the gospels, and
especially emphasized to Sunday
school children, violates the
Marlboro-man masculine
mystique. Among liturgical
(formal) denominations, the
vestments, candles, incense,
classical music, choirs, flowers
and, in the case of Catholics,
celibacy, appeal to a certain type
of man.
But probably no evidence
better supports the argument for
such a link than the existence of
the Metropolitan Community
Church, a five-year-old
denomination with already 40
congregations in cities throughout
North America, the "mother
church" of which is said to be the
third largest church in the city of
Los Angeles. Its appeal is overtly
to gay Christians.
The story of the MCC is the
subject of Ronald M. Enroth and
Gerald E. Jamison's 144-page
volume. The Gay Church
(Eerdmans. Grand Rapids, $4.95
cloth). The team of sociologists,
Enroth a professor at Westmont
College, an evangelical school in
Santa Barbara, and Jamison one
of his former students, researched
the gay churches in Los Angeles
and San Francisco first hand, with
interviews and library research
conducted at others from San
Diego to Boston.
Fundamentalist
The most surprising thing,
superficially, about the MCC is
that it is fundamentalist in
everything but its attitude toward
sexual behavior. Fornication is

heartily condoned even among
most of the denomination's
clergy, all but one of whom is gay
and that one is bi sexual with a
straight marriage.
But on questions like the way
of salvation, the infallibility of the
Bible, the person and work of
Christ, and evangelism, the MCC is
almost, though not totally, as
"straight" as a Pentacostal or
Bible Baptist church.
Though they attempt to veil
their perspective in an assumed
"scientific objectivity," it is
obvious that the authors are
themselves conservative Christians
who empathize with the gay
church, while not condoning what
they consider to be its deviations
from biblical truth.
In other words, they want the
gays to admit that fornication is a
sin which, while no less
forgiveable than murder or
gossiping — the Bible does lump
them in that proximity — is never
to be taken lightly and should be
opposed in any church calling
itself Christian.
Damning Attitude
Homosexuals should be helped,
encouraged to abstain from
extramarital sexual intercourse,
and above all warned that, while
homosexual inclinations in
themselves may not be damning,
an unrepentant attitude toward
and practice of homosexual acts is,
the authors indirectly conclude.
The book is of much value as a

sensitive survey of a difficult
topic, and the theological insight
the authors bring to their task,
though they admit it is outside
their field of expertise, is
especially helpful.
They analyze each of the
passages of scripture believed to
refer to homosexuality, along
with the under-developed "gay
theology's" rationale for taking an
unorthodox posture on it. They
also deal with such questions as the
love between Christ and John the
Beloved, Paul and Timothy, and
David and Jonathan, which are
cited as at least having
implications for homosexual
relationships. The authors are
weakest in answering the gay
arguments for a case that David
and Jonathan had a more than
platonic relationship.
Social Ministries
Of special help is the book's
treatment of the MCC
congregations' social ministries to
the elderly, prisoners, alcoholics,
suicidals, and sado-masochists,
whom most MCC ministers seem
to consider pathological. A special
chapter deals with other gay
religious groups and spokesmen,
self-styled and otherwise, like the
Rev. Ray Broshears, San
Francisco's flamboyant "presiding
bishop of the Orthodox Episcopal
Church of God," and William
Johnson, the first gay seminarian
to be ordained by an established
Protestant Church, the United

Church of Christ.
The case is clearly established
that, although the denomination
may be more gay than Christian
and is potentially liable to
fracture into a dozen splinter
groups each with its own
distinctive doctrine and practice,
the gay church wants to be
Christian, not satanic, pagan, or
secular. It is not a church in name
only, like Kirby Hensley's
Universal Life Church, and not
just a tax-exempt social club.
MCC's leaders, would give
anything to establish a real case
that Christ, with whom they
strongly want to identify, is not
calling them to reject
extra-marital sex relations. The
authors believe they aren't even
close to having one yet, and as
long as they maintain the Bible
and mainline Catholic and
Protestant tradition as their
standards, they never will.
Enroth and Jamison warn that
their book is not intended as a
scholarly treatise. It is good that it
is designed to interest potential
readers in the gay subculture; but
a few much-needed footnotes
wouldn't have scared them off
completely. The index is helpful,
but unfortunately the
bibliography fails to list the
periodicals which are quoted
profusely throughout the volume.

Universal Life Church, and not
just a tax-exempt social club.
MCC's leaders, would give
anything to establish a real case
that Christ, with whom they
strongly want to identify, is not
calling them to reject
extra-marital sex relations. The
authors believe they aren't even
close to having one yet, and as
long as they maintain the Bible
and mainline Catholic and
Protestant tradition as their
standards, they never will.
Enroth and Jamison warn that
their book is not intended as a
scholarly treatise. It is good that it
is designed to interest potential
readers in the gay subculture; but
a few much-needed footnotes
wouldn't have scared them off
completely. The index is helpful,
but unfortunately the
bibliography fails to list the
periodicals which are quoted
profusely throughout the volume.
The Boys In The Band, the
poignant play made into a movie
about homosexuality before the
days of the gay pride movement,
ends with a comment on the
central character's spiritual
loneliness; the fact that although
he knows intellectually he cannot
be practicing unconfessed
homosexual fornication and be a
Catholic in good standing, he still
feels a strong sense of
identification with the church and
considers the mass a form of
catharsis.
Mr. Madame, the classic
account of homosexual life in the
same era, by Kenneth Marlowe,
also records great striving for
religious liberation and a desire to
overcome the flesh through
religious practice which ultimately
ended in failure.
A personal friend who went
the gay route for a time after
dropping out of seminary has
observed he feels there is an
inordinantly high percentage of
once-practicing or even
still-practicing Christians in the
gay scene. These are a few
indications of an apparent affinity
of homosexuals toward religion,
an affinity that is not hard to
imagine. Boys who are not
physically oriented may gravitate
toward spiritual interests. The
church places more emphasis on
at least one form of brotherly love
than other instituions.
Violates Mystique
Jesus has often been falsely
depicted as effeminate, and some
liberals have even advanced the
hypothesis that he was a

homosexual. The passive,
turn-the-other-cheek meekness
taught in the gospels, and
especially emphasized to Sunday
school children, violates the
Marlboro-man masculine
mystique. Among liturgical
(formal) denominations, the
vestments, candles, incense,
classical music, choirs, flowers
and, in the case of Catholics,
celibacy, appeal to a certain type
of man.
But probably no evidence
better supports the argument for
such a link than the existence of
the Metropolitan Community
Church, a five-year-old
denomination with already 40
congregations in cities throughout
North America, the "mother
church" of which is said to be the
third largest church in the city of
Los Angeles. Its appeal is overtly
to gay Christians.
The story of the MCC is the
subject of Ronald M. Enroth and
Gerald E. Jamison's 144-page
volume. The Gay Church
(Eerdmans. Grand Rapids, $4.95
cloth). The team of sociologists,
Enroth a professor at Westmont
College, an evangelical school in
Santa Barbara, and Jamison one
of his former students, researched
the gay churches in Los Angeles
and San Francisco first hand, with
interviews and library research
conducted at others from San
Diego to Boston.
Fundamentalist
The most surprising thing,
superficially, about the MCC is
that it is fundamentalist in
everything but its attitude toward
sexual behavior. Fornication is

heartily condoned even among
most of the denomination's
clergy, all but one of whom is gay
and that one is bi sexual with a
straight marriage.
But on questions like the way
of salvation, the infallibility of the
Bible, the person and work of
Christ, and evangelism, the MCC is
almost, though not totally, as
"straight" as a Pentacostal or
Bible Baptist church.
Though they attempt to veil
their perspective in an assumed
"scientific objectivity," it is
obvious that the authors are
themselves conservative Christians
who empathize with the gay
church, while not condoning what
they consider to be its deviations
from biblical truth.
In other words, they want the
gays to admit that fornication is a
sin which, while no less
forgiveable than murder or
gossiping — the Bible does lump
them in that proximity — is never
to be taken lightly and should be
opposed in any church calling
itself Christian.
Damning Attitude
Homosexuals should be helped,
encouraged to abstain from
extramarital sexual intercourse,
and above all warned that, while
homosexual inclinations in
themselves may not be damning,
an unrepentant attitude toward
and practice of homosexual acts is,
the authors indirectly conclude.
The book is of much value as a

sensitive survey of a difficult
topic, and the theological insight
the authors bring to their task,
though they admit it is outside
their field of expertise, is
especially helpful.
They analyze each of the
passages of scripture believed to
refer to homosexuality, along
with the under-developed "gay
theology's" rationale for taking an
unorthodox posture on it. They
also deal with such questions as the
love between Christ and John the
Beloved, Paul and Timothy, and
David and Jonathan, which are
cited as at least having
implications for homosexual
relationships. The authors are
weakest in answering the gay
arguments for a case that David
and Jonathan had a more than
platonic relationship.
Social Ministries
Of special help is the book's
treatment of the MCC
congregations' social ministries to
the elderly, prisoners, alcoholics,
suicidals, and sado-masochists,
whom most MCC ministers seem
to consider pathological. A special
chapter deals with other gay
religious groups and spokesmen,
self-styled and otherwise, like the
Rev. Ray Broshears, San
Francisco's flamboyant "presiding
bishop of the Orthodox Episcopal
Church of God," and William
Johnson, the first gay seminarian
to be ordained by an established
Protestant Church, the United

Church of Christ.
The case is clearly established
that, although the denomination
may be more gay than Christian
and is potentially liable to
fracture into a dozen splinter
groups each with its own
distinctive doctrine and practice,
the gay church wants to be
Christian, not satanic, pagan, or
secular. It is not a church in name
only, like Kirby Hensley's
Universal Life Church, and not
just a tax-exempt social club.

treatment of the MCC
congregations' social ministries to
the elderly, prisoners, alcoholics,
suicidals, and sado-masochists,
whom most MCC ministers seem
to consider pathological. A special
chapter deals with other gay
religious groups and spokesmen,
self-styled and otherwise, like the
Rev. Ray Broshears, San
Francisco's flamboyant "presiding
bishop of the Orthodox Episcopal
Church of God," and William
Johnson, the first gay seminarian
to be ordained by an established
Protestant Church, the United

Church of Christ.
The case is clearly established
that, although the denomination
may be more gay than Christian
and is potentially liable to
fracture into a dozen splinter
groups each with its own
distinctive doctrine and practice,
the gay church wants to be
Christian, not satanic, pagan, or
secular. It is not a church in name
only, like Kirby Hensley's
Universal Life Church, and not
just a tax-exempt social club.
MCC's leaders, would give
anything to establish a real case
that Christ, with whom they
strongly want to identify, is not
calling them to reject
extra-marital sex relations. The
authors believe they aren't even
close to having one yet, and as
long as they maintain the Bible
and mainline Catholic and
Protestant tradition as their
standards, they never will.
Enroth and Jamison warn that
their book is not intended as a
scholarly treatise. It is good that it
is designed to interest potential
readers in the gay subculture; but
a few much-needed footnotes
wouldn't have scared them off
completely. The index is helpful,
but unfortunately the
bibliography fails to list the
periodicals which are quoted
profusely throughout the volume.
The Boys In The Band, the
poignant play made into a movie
about homosexuality before the
days of the gay pride movement,
ends with a comment on the
central character's spiritual
loneliness; the fact that although
he knows intellectually he cannot
be practicing unconfessed
homosexual fornication and be a
Catholic in good standing, he still
feels a strong sense of
identification with the church and
considers the mass a form of
catharsis.
Mr. Madame, the classic
account of homosexual life in the
same era, by Kenneth Marlowe,
also records great striving for
religious liberation and a desire to
overcome the flesh through
religious practice which ultimately
ended in failure.
A personal friend who went
the gay route for a time after
dropping out of seminary has
observed he feels there is an
inordinantly high percentage of
once-practicing or even
still-practicing Christians in the
gay scene. These are a few
indications of an apparent affinity
of homosexuals toward religion,
an affinity that is not hard to
imagine. Boys who are not
physically oriented may gravitate
toward spiritual interests. The
church places more emphasis on
at least one form of brotherly love
than other instituions.
Violates Mystique
Jesus has often been falsely
depicted as effeminate, and some
liberals have even advanced the
hypothesis that he was a

homosexual. The passive,
turn-the-other-cheek meekness
taught in the gospels, and
especially emphasized to Sunday
school children, violates the
Marlboro-man masculine
mystique. Among liturgical
(formal) denominations, the
vestments, candles, incense,
classical music, choirs, flowers
and, in the case of Catholics,
celibacy, appeal to a certain type
of man.
But probably no evidence
better supports the argument for
such a link than the existence of
the Metropolitan Community
Church, a five-year-old
denomination with already 40
congregations in cities throughout
North America, the "mother
church" of which is said to be the
third largest church in the city of
Los Angeles. Its appeal is overtly
to gay Christians.
The story of the MCC is the
subject of Ronald M. Enroth and
Gerald E. Jamison's 144-page
volume. The Gay Church
(Eerdmans. Grand Rapids, $4.95
cloth). The team of sociologists,
Enroth a professor at Westmont
College, an evangelical school in
Santa Barbara, and Jamison one
of his former students, researched
the gay churches in Los Angeles
and San Francisco first hand, with
interviews and library research
conducted at others from San
Diego to Boston.
Fundamentalist
The most surprising thing,
superficially, about the MCC is
that it is fundamentalist in
everything but its attitude toward
sexual behavior. Fornication is

heartily condoned even among
most of the denomination's
clergy, all but one of whom is gay
and that one is bi sexual with a
straight marriage.
But on questions like the way
of salvation, the infallibility of the
Bible, the person and work of
Christ, and evangelism, the MCC is
almost, though not totally, as
"straight" as a Pentacostal or
Bible Baptist church.
Though they attempt to veil
their perspective in an assumed
"scientific objectivity," it is
obvious that the authors are
themselves conservative Christians
who empathize with the gay
church, while not condoning what
they consider to be its deviations
from biblical truth.
In other words, they want the
gays to admit that fornication is a
sin which, while no less
forgiveable than murder or
gossiping — the Bible does lump
them in that proximity — is never
to be taken lightly and should be
opposed in any church calling
itself Christian.
Damning Attitude
Homosexuals should be helped,
encouraged to abstain from
extramarital sexual intercourse,
and above all warned that, while
homosexual inclinations in
themselves may not be damning,
an unrepentant attitude toward
and practice of homosexual acts is,
the authors indirectly conclude.
The book is of much value as a

sensitive survey of a difficult
topic, and the theological insight
the authors bring to their task,
though they admit it is outside
their field of expertise, is
especially helpful.
They analyze each of the
passages of scripture believed to
refer to homosexuality, along
with the under-developed "gay
theology's" rationale for taking an
unorthodox posture on it. They
also deal with such questions as the
love between Christ and John the
Beloved, Paul and Timothy, and
David and Jonathan, which are
cited as at least having
implications for homosexual
relationships. The authors are
weakest in answering the gay
arguments for a case that David
and Jonathan had a more than
platonic relationship.
