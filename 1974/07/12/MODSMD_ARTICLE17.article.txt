Judiciary Panel Releases Evidence
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee
yesterday released eight volumes of information it has
gathered during its impeachment investigation of President
Nixon.
The information contains no new startling disclosures,
and Washington observers said that if Nixon is impeached,
it will likely be on the basis of information already in the
public domain.
Transcripts of two previously released tapes do,
however, seem to implicate Nixon. One tape showed
Nixon feared the Watergate investigation would lead to
himself.
Nixon expressed these fears in a March 17, 1973
conversation with ex-White House Counsel John Dean.
Nixon has said he did not know of the cover-up until
March 21. Dean will testify before the House Committee
today.
In the March 17 conversation, Nixon expressed fear
that two aides, Hugh Sloan and Jeb Stuart Magruder,
would reveal their involvement in Watergate. Nixon said
that the inquiry might lead "to the White House ... we've
got to cut that off."
White House press secretary Ronald Ziegler criticized
the House panel for releasing the evidence in a
"piecemeal" fashion.
Meanwhile at the Supreme Court, assistant Watergate
prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste told the court that a
19-minute. gap had been found in a subpoenaed tape of a
conversation between Nixon and John Ehrlichman on
March 20.
This tape has been subpoenaed by the House Judiciary
Committee. Previously, a gap of IBV2 minutes was found in
a tape of a conversation between Nixon and H.R.
Haldeman.
White House lawyer James St. Clair denied that the gap
was intentional, saying that it was an "interval" caused by
technical problems.
Senate Votes To Repeal 'No-Knock'
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yesterday to repeal
the "no-knock" provision in the federal drug law and to
cut off all U.S. aid to any country exporting opium.

Both actions were taken in the form of amendments to
a bill to extend the life of the Drug Enforcement
Administration for five years. The bill was passed by an
89-0 vote, and now goes to the House for approval.
The no-knock provision authorizes federal narcotic
agents and District of Columbia police to procure warrants
allowing them to break forcibly into a home or office
where narcotics are suspected.
The amendment to halt all military or economic aid to
a country growing and exporting opium was aimed at
Turkey, which recently lifted a ban on poppy growing.
Convicts Seize Hostages
WASHINGTON — Two convicts seized at least six
hostages yesterday in the cell block of the courthouse
where the trial of John Ehrlichman is underway.
The convicts, who are facing 10 to 30-year prison
terms, claimed they were holding nine hostages and that
12 other prisoners are in the basement cell block with
them.
The convicts called a radio station and said that they
wanted a car to National Airport, from which they would
fly to San Francisco and then Venezuela.
Upstairs in the courtroom, the prosecution finished
final arguments yesterday in the Ellsberg break-in trial of
Ehrlichman and three others.
Federal Judge Gerhard Gesell will instruct the jurors
this morning, and the jury will begin deliberations this
afternoon.
Patrolman Join Baltimore Strike
BALTIMORE — Patrolmen in one southwestern district
of Baltimore walked off their jobs yesterday, joining more
than 3000 other blue-collar workers in the 11th day of a
strike against the city.
In Baltimore's other seven districts, police continued a
five-day job action of enforcing laws to the letter in order
to draw attention to their contract dispute with the city.
Union officials say that the police moves are intended
to get stalled negotiations moving again, and that police
"activity" is gradually escalating.
Patty Hearst Reportedly In Guatemala
SAN FRANCISCO — A San Francisco television

station, KQED, reported last night that Patricia Hearst and
two other members of the Symbionese Liberation Army
have fled to Guatemala.
The station said that Hearst, William Harris and his
wife, Emily, traveled by boat to Guatemala. There, they
have assumed new identities and linked up with
underground groups, the station said.
Hearst was kidnaped in February, then apparently
joined her captors.
Sinatra Allowed To Continue Tour
SYDNEY — Australian unions yesterday agreed to
allow American smger Frank Sinatra to continue his tour
after holding him under virtual house arrest in a Sydney
hotel room.
Sinatra had been held after a concert Tuesday night in
Melbourne, where his bodyguards allegedly roughed up
cameramen before a concert.
Sinatra was allowed to continue his tour after saying he
"regretted" the tactics. He did not, however, issue a
general apology as the unions had demanded.
In Canberra, the minister of immigration said he would
attempt to block Sinatra from visiting Australia again.
Tentative Ban On L.A. Nudist Beaeh
LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles City Council
yesterday voted down a proposal to create areas on city
beaches labelled "clothing optional."
The council instead gave tentative approval to an
ordinance which would ban nudity at all city recreational
areas.
About 400 persons jammed into the council chambers
to hear debate on the issue. Discussion on the proposal
was temporarily disrupted when Robert Opel, 33, walked
up the aisle, stripped naked, and stood just behind Chief
of Police Ed Davis.
Opel was quickly arrested. He is the same man who
streaked across the stage at the presentation of the
Academy Awards in April.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. High today in the mid
70s to low 80s. Low tonight in the 50s. Northwest winds
10 to 20 miles per hour.

About 400 persons jammed into the council chambers
to hear debate on the issue. Discussion on the proposal
was temporarily disrupted when Robert Opel, 33, walked
up the aisle, stripped naked, and stood just behind Chief
of Police Ed Davis.
Opel was quickly arrested. He is the same man who
streaked across the stage at the presentation of the
Academy Awards in April.

Judiciary Panel Releases Evidence
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee
yesterday released eight volumes of information it has
gathered during its impeachment investigation of President
Nixon.
The information contains no new startling disclosures,
and Washington observers said that if Nixon is impeached,
it will likely be on the basis of information already in the
public domain.
Transcripts of two previously released tapes do,
however, seem to implicate Nixon. One tape showed
Nixon feared the Watergate investigation would lead to
himself.
Nixon expressed these fears in a March 17, 1973
conversation with ex-White House Counsel John Dean.
Nixon has said he did not know of the cover-up until
March 21. Dean will testify before the House Committee
today.
In the March 17 conversation, Nixon expressed fear
that two aides, Hugh Sloan and Jeb Stuart Magruder,
would reveal their involvement in Watergate. Nixon said
that the inquiry might lead "to the White House ... we've
got to cut that off."
White House press secretary Ronald Ziegler criticized
the House panel for releasing the evidence in a
"piecemeal" fashion.
Meanwhile at the Supreme Court, assistant Watergate
prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste told the court that a
19-minute. gap had been found in a subpoenaed tape of a
conversation between Nixon and John Ehrlichman on
March 20.
This tape has been subpoenaed by the House Judiciary
Committee. Previously, a gap of IBV2 minutes was found in
a tape of a conversation between Nixon and H.R.
Haldeman.
White House lawyer James St. Clair denied that the gap
was intentional, saying that it was an "interval" caused by
technical problems.
Senate Votes To Repeal 'No-Knock'
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yesterday to repeal
the "no-knock" provision in the federal drug law and to
cut off all U.S. aid to any country exporting opium.

Both actions were taken in the form of amendments to
a bill to extend the life of the Drug Enforcement
Administration for five years. The bill was passed by an
89-0 vote, and now goes to the House for approval.
The no-knock provision authorizes federal narcotic
agents and District of Columbia police to procure warrants
allowing them to break forcibly into a home or office
where narcotics are suspected.
The amendment to halt all military or economic aid to
a country growing and exporting opium was aimed at
Turkey, which recently lifted a ban on poppy growing.
Convicts Seize Hostages
WASHINGTON — Two convicts seized at least six
hostages yesterday in the cell block of the courthouse
where the trial of John Ehrlichman is underway.
The convicts, who are facing 10 to 30-year prison
terms, claimed they were holding nine hostages and that
12 other prisoners are in the basement cell block with
them.
The convicts called a radio station and said that they
wanted a car to National Airport, from which they would
fly to San Francisco and then Venezuela.
Upstairs in the courtroom, the prosecution finished
final arguments yesterday in the Ellsberg break-in trial of
Ehrlichman and three others.
Federal Judge Gerhard Gesell will instruct the jurors
this morning, and the jury will begin deliberations this
afternoon.
Patrolman Join Baltimore Strike
BALTIMORE — Patrolmen in one southwestern district
of Baltimore walked off their jobs yesterday, joining more
than 3000 other blue-collar workers in the 11th day of a
strike against the city.
In Baltimore's other seven districts, police continued a
five-day job action of enforcing laws to the letter in order
to draw attention to their contract dispute with the city.
Union officials say that the police moves are intended
to get stalled negotiations moving again, and that police
"activity" is gradually escalating.
Patty Hearst Reportedly In Guatemala
SAN FRANCISCO — A San Francisco television

station, KQED, reported last night that Patricia Hearst and
two other members of the Symbionese Liberation Army
have fled to Guatemala.
The station said that Hearst, William Harris and his
wife, Emily, traveled by boat to Guatemala. There, they
have assumed new identities and linked up with
underground groups, the station said.
Hearst was kidnaped in February, then apparently
joined her captors.
Sinatra Allowed To Continue Tour
SYDNEY — Australian unions yesterday agreed to
allow American smger Frank Sinatra to continue his tour
after holding him under virtual house arrest in a Sydney
hotel room.
Sinatra had been held after a concert Tuesday night in
Melbourne, where his bodyguards allegedly roughed up
cameramen before a concert.
Sinatra was allowed to continue his tour after saying he
"regretted" the tactics. He did not, however, issue a
general apology as the unions had demanded.
In Canberra, the minister of immigration said he would
attempt to block Sinatra from visiting Australia again.
Tentative Ban On L.A. Nudist Beaeh
LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles City Council
yesterday voted down a proposal to create areas on city
beaches labelled "clothing optional."
The council instead gave tentative approval to an
ordinance which would ban nudity at all city recreational
areas.
About 400 persons jammed into the council chambers
to hear debate on the issue. Discussion on the proposal
was temporarily disrupted when Robert Opel, 33, walked

Melbourne, where his bodyguards allegedly roughed up
cameramen before a concert.
Sinatra was allowed to continue his tour after saying he
"regretted" the tactics. He did not, however, issue a
general apology as the unions had demanded.
In Canberra, the minister of immigration said he would
attempt to block Sinatra from visiting Australia again.
Tentative Ban On L.A. Nudist Beaeh
LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles City Council
yesterday voted down a proposal to create areas on city
beaches labelled "clothing optional."
The council instead gave tentative approval to an
ordinance which would ban nudity at all city recreational
areas.
About 400 persons jammed into the council chambers
to hear debate on the issue. Discussion on the proposal
was temporarily disrupted when Robert Opel, 33, walked
up the aisle, stripped naked, and stood just behind Chief
of Police Ed Davis.
Opel was quickly arrested. He is the same man who
streaked across the stage at the presentation of the
Academy Awards in April.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. High today in the mid
70s to low 80s. Low tonight in the 50s. Northwest winds
10 to 20 miles per hour.
Judiciary Panel Releases Evidence
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee
yesterday released eight volumes of information it has
gathered during its impeachment investigation of President
Nixon.
The information contains no new startling disclosures,
and Washington observers said that if Nixon is impeached,
it will likely be on the basis of information already in the
public domain.
Transcripts of two previously released tapes do,
however, seem to implicate Nixon. One tape showed
Nixon feared the Watergate investigation would lead to
himself.
Nixon expressed these fears in a March 17, 1973
conversation with ex-White House Counsel John Dean.
Nixon has said he did not know of the cover-up until
March 21. Dean will testify before the House Committee
today.
In the March 17 conversation, Nixon expressed fear
that two aides, Hugh Sloan and Jeb Stuart Magruder,
would reveal their involvement in Watergate. Nixon said
that the inquiry might lead "to the White House ... we've
got to cut that off."
White House press secretary Ronald Ziegler criticized
the House panel for releasing the evidence in a
"piecemeal" fashion.
Meanwhile at the Supreme Court, assistant Watergate
prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste told the court that a
19-minute. gap had been found in a subpoenaed tape of a
conversation between Nixon and John Ehrlichman on
March 20.
This tape has been subpoenaed by the House Judiciary
Committee. Previously, a gap of IBV2 minutes was found in
a tape of a conversation between Nixon and H.R.
Haldeman.
White House lawyer James St. Clair denied that the gap
was intentional, saying that it was an "interval" caused by
technical problems.
Senate Votes To Repeal 'No-Knock'
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yesterday to repeal
the "no-knock" provision in the federal drug law and to
cut off all U.S. aid to any country exporting opium.

Both actions were taken in the form of amendments to
a bill to extend the life of the Drug Enforcement
Administration for five years. The bill was passed by an
89-0 vote, and now goes to the House for approval.
The no-knock provision authorizes federal narcotic
agents and District of Columbia police to procure warrants
allowing them to break forcibly into a home or office
where narcotics are suspected.
The amendment to halt all military or economic aid to
a country growing and exporting opium was aimed at
Turkey, which recently lifted a ban on poppy growing.
Convicts Seize Hostages
WASHINGTON — Two convicts seized at least six
hostages yesterday in the cell block of the courthouse
where the trial of John Ehrlichman is underway.
The convicts, who are facing 10 to 30-year prison
terms, claimed they were holding nine hostages and that
12 other prisoners are in the basement cell block with
them.
The convicts called a radio station and said that they
wanted a car to National Airport, from which they would
fly to San Francisco and then Venezuela.
Upstairs in the courtroom, the prosecution finished
final arguments yesterday in the Ellsberg break-in trial of
Ehrlichman and three others.
Federal Judge Gerhard Gesell will instruct the jurors
this morning, and the jury will begin deliberations this
afternoon.
Patrolman Join Baltimore Strike
BALTIMORE — Patrolmen in one southwestern district
of Baltimore walked off their jobs yesterday, joining more
than 3000 other blue-collar workers in the 11th day of a
strike against the city.
In Baltimore's other seven districts, police continued a
five-day job action of enforcing laws to the letter in order
to draw attention to their contract dispute with the city.
Union officials say that the police moves are intended
to get stalled negotiations moving again, and that police
"activity" is gradually escalating.
Patty Hearst Reportedly In Guatemala
SAN FRANCISCO — A San Francisco television

station, KQED, reported last night that Patricia Hearst and
two other members of the Symbionese Liberation Army
have fled to Guatemala.
The station said that Hearst, William Harris and his
wife, Emily, traveled by boat to Guatemala. There, they
have assumed new identities and linked up with
underground groups, the station said.
Hearst was kidnaped in February, then apparently
joined her captors.
Sinatra Allowed To Continue Tour
SYDNEY — Australian unions yesterday agreed to
allow American smger Frank Sinatra to continue his tour
after holding him under virtual house arrest in a Sydney
hotel room.
Sinatra had been held after a concert Tuesday night in
Melbourne, where his bodyguards allegedly roughed up
cameramen before a concert.
Sinatra was allowed to continue his tour after saying he
"regretted" the tactics. He did not, however, issue a
