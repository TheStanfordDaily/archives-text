# Agreement Reduces Campaign Expenditures
## McCloskey, Gillmor To Mail Jointly 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Continuing their efforts to
reform political campaigning,
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,
R—Menlo Park, and his
Democratic opponent, Santa Clara
Mayor Gary Gillmor, have agreed
to send out a joint mailing to
voters in the 12th Congressional
district.
The mailing should save each
candidate about $7500, since the
two candidates will split the
$15,000 estimated cost.
The agreement is the fourth
innovative measure in what may
be the most unique campaign in
history. Before the June primary
election, McCloskey and Gillmor
agreed to limit their campaign
expenses in the general election to
$25,000 apiece and to accept no
individual donations over $500.
The agreements concerning the
joint mailing and expenditures
will be supervised by a
three-member Board of Review
consisting of Santa Clara County
Democratic Chairman Alan Davis,
Santa Clara County Republican
Chairman Mike Cobb and a person
— probably from Common Cause
— chosen by the party chairmen.
Joint Printing
The material to be included in
the joint mailing will be left up to
the Review Board, but Gillmor
said yesterday that he would "like
to take it a step further" and have
a "joing printing that would
discuss the common issues."
Gillmor originally proposed the
campaign financing agreements to
all seven primary candidates,
setting a limit of primary spending
at $15,000, but the four
Democratic contenders never

reached agreement. McCloskey
responded that he would accept
the proposal for the general
election if he won.
In the Republican primary,
McCloskey spent $135,000 to
beat Atherton Businessman J.
Gordon Knapp, who spent about
$75,000. Gillmor's expenditures
reached $17,000 in the primary.
Two years ago, McCloskey

spent $183,000 in the primary
and $138,000 in the general
election, the second largest
amount spent by any
Congressional candidate in the
country.
The $25,000 limit would
appear to be most
disadvantageous to Gillmor, in
terms of name recognition, but he
noted that he could not compete

with McCloskey in terms of
spending.
McCloskey Newsletter
One disagreement has surfaced
concerning McCloskey's intention
to send "out two and possibly
three franked newsletters to
constituents during the summer,"
according to a letter he sent to
Gillmor. He added that he would
"be meticulous in avoiding any
political comments or self-serving
political information in these
mailings."
In a letter to McCloskey,
Gillmor responded that he felt
"this would be of great advantage
to you and a great disadvantage to
me." Gillmor suggested that
McCloskey "reconsider that
approach."
Another point that needs
clarification is the date which the

agreement concerning donations
went into effect.
McCloskey has proposed June
30 as the date after which
contributions would be applied to
the general rather than the
primary campaign. "I have
received two or three $1000
contributions in June, but have
found it necessary to apply them
to my primary campaign deficit,"
he told Gillmor.
But Gillmor replied that he felt
all campaign expenditures made
after June 4, not June 30, should
be considered toward the
$25,000. Apparently the Review
Board will resolve the
discrepancies between the
candidates' proposals.
McCloskey and Gillmor plan to
confront each other in a series of
ten debates, to be held on Sunday
and Monday evenings, to begin
either in October (McCloskey's
preference) or in September
(Gillmor's preference).
