# Younger Study Contains Errors

Political organizing in
California prisons by the radical
Venceremos organization was the
cause of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA),
according to a report issued
yesterday by State Attorney
General Evelle Younger.
Independent investigation by
the Daily shows that there are
errors in the report. The
formation of the SLA was an
undertaking independent of
Venceremos. Some people,
however, appear to have been
associated with both groups.
Venceremos was a
revolutionary communist group
which began in Palo Alto and
Redwood City and spread
throughout the entire Bay Area. It
was founded in early 1969, added
as members large numbers of
persons who left the
Revolutionary Union in late 1970,
and dissolved in the fall of 1973.

The report on "Terrorism in
California" was prepared by the
California Department of Justice.
The report is partly directed at
disseminating information that
might aid the government in
apprehending those persons who
bombed the office of the state
attorney general in Los Angeles
on May 31.
Behind Prison Walls
Another focus of the report is
on political organizing behind
prison walls and on the possible
recruitment of individuals from
"less action-prone revolutionary
organizations (into] the smaller
well-disciplined terrorist
organizations in order for them to
fulfill a more active role such as
that of the Symbionese Liberation
Army."
The Venceremos organization
is identified as the source of the
SLA early in the report: "Prior to
its recent disbanding, the
Venceremos organization began a
wholesale indoctrination program

to develop revolutionary cadres in
the prisons which resulted in the
formation of the Symbionese
Liberation Army and the first
political kidnaping in this
country.
"Authorities believe that many
Venceremos organization
members have gone underground
and are active in small affinity
groups ...."
Later on in the report, a
"Venceremos Underground" is
spoken of as an existing, formal
organization that continues to
work with political groups inside
prisons.
Positions Differ
The official position of
Venceremos on the role of armed
struggle in the revolutionary
process differs from that of the
SLA. Venceremos always stressed
that for armed action to be
meaningful, it must be connected
with legal, public political work
and a disciplined party
organization.

The SLA has said that armed
action by underground groups
isolated from public political
work can spark a full-fledged
armed revolutionary struggle
against the government.
Although the two positions on
armed struggle are distinct, former
Venceremos members have
confirmed that it would have been
possible to hold an SLA-type
position within Venceremos as a
minority viewpoint.
According to one former
Venceremos member: "It is
a | political J waste of time [to
emphasize] denying that there are
links [between the defunct
Venceremos organization and the
SLA) .. . There clearly are some
links."
As this same ex-Venceremos
member put it, the group
explored affiliation with the
Eldridge Cleaver-alligned New
York Black Panthers, and after
the dissolution of Venceremos
some surviving Bay Area
collectives have endorsed the
Black Liberation Army (formed
from the Cleaver faction of the
Panthers), including the BLA's
support of the SLA.

But all evidence indicates that
Venceremos as a formal
organization has ceased to exist.
In the words of former Stanford
English Prof. Bruce Franklin:
'There is no organization....
There is no central committee;
there is no newspaper; there is no
nothing."
Sources in radical groups
around the Bay Area agree that
there is no functioning
Venceremos Underground as
described in the report.
At present the status of the
former members of Venceremos
takes three forms. A few (not
"many" as described by the
report) have joined underground
armed groups that operate only in
secret and do not engage in open
political organizing. But
ex-members of Venceremos
concur that this is a small
minority.
A second group of former
members are individually involved
in reform groups such as ecology
action groups or labor unions. In
the course of their recent political
evolution, these former members
have come to place less emphasis
on revolutionary race-related
social problems and on armed
struggle.
A third group of former
members are still organized in
political collectives, such as the
one active in Palo Alto. These

collectives are deeply involved at
present in efforts to consolidate
their past practical political
experience and organizational
work qnd to form a new national
communist party.
About half of the collective in
Palo Alto reacted very negatively
to the activities of the SLA. These
members viewed the SLA actions
as counterproductive, isolated
terrorism, a few thought probably
initiated by an internal police
provocateur. But the other half of
the collective argued that the
adventurism of the SLA was of far
less danger to the revolutionary
process than the reformist
strategy of social democratic
groups.
Generally, the existing
collectives which survive as
remnants of the old Venceremos
agree that "it is absolutely clear,"
as one former member put it, that
the future nation-wide communist
party "must have an underground
military apparatus" attached to it.
The surviving collectives are
part of an on-going national
dialogue among Maoist groups
that are trying to build a new
party. A source in the Palo Alto
collective indicated that it appears
likely that a political group called
the Communist League may be
"the core" of such a new
formation, to which the Palo Alto
group might adhere.

Panthers), including the BLA's
support of the SLA.

But all evidence indicates that
Venceremos as a formal
organization has ceased to exist.
In the words of former Stanford
English Prof. Bruce Franklin:
'There is no organization....
There is no central committee;
there is no newspaper; there is no
nothing."
Sources in radical groups
around the Bay Area agree that
there is no functioning
Venceremos Underground as
described in the report.
At present the status of the
former members of Venceremos
takes three forms. A few (not
"many" as described by the
report) have joined underground
armed groups that operate only in
secret and do not engage in open
political organizing. But
ex-members of Venceremos
concur that this is a small
minority.
A second group of former
members are individually involved
in reform groups such as ecology
action groups or labor unions. In
the course of their recent political
evolution, these former members
have come to place less emphasis
on revolutionary race-related
social problems and on armed
struggle.
A third group of former
members are still organized in
political collectives, such as the
one active in Palo Alto. These

collectives are deeply involved at
present in efforts to consolidate
their past practical political
experience and organizational
work qnd to form a new national
communist party.
About half of the collective in
Palo Alto reacted very negatively
to the activities of the SLA. These
members viewed the SLA actions
as counterproductive, isolated
terrorism, a few thought probably
initiated by an internal police
provocateur. But the other half of
the collective argued that the
adventurism of the SLA was of far
less danger to the revolutionary
process than the reformist
strategy of social democratic
groups.
Generally, the existing
collectives which survive as
remnants of the old Venceremos
agree that "it is absolutely clear,"
as one former member put it, that
the future nation-wide communist
party "must have an underground
military apparatus" attached to it.
The surviving collectives are
part of an on-going national
dialogue among Maoist groups
that are trying to build a new
party. A source in the Palo Alto
collective indicated that it appears
likely that a political group called
the Communist League may be
"the core" of such a new
formation, to which the Palo Alto
group might adhere.

Political organizing in
California prisons by the radical
Venceremos organization was the
cause of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA),
according to a report issued
yesterday by State Attorney
General Evelle Younger.
Independent investigation by
the Daily shows that there are
errors in the report. The
formation of the SLA was an
undertaking independent of
Venceremos. Some people,
however, appear to have been
associated with both groups.
Venceremos was a
revolutionary communist group
which began in Palo Alto and
Redwood City and spread
throughout the entire Bay Area. It
was founded in early 1969, added
as members large numbers of
persons who left the
Revolutionary Union in late 1970,
and dissolved in the fall of 1973.

The report on "Terrorism in
California" was prepared by the
California Department of Justice.
The report is partly directed at
disseminating information that
might aid the government in
apprehending those persons who
bombed the office of the state
attorney general in Los Angeles
on May 31.
Behind Prison Walls
Another focus of the report is
on political organizing behind
prison walls and on the possible
recruitment of individuals from
"less action-prone revolutionary
organizations (into] the smaller
well-disciplined terrorist
organizations in order for them to
fulfill a more active role such as
that of the Symbionese Liberation
Army."
The Venceremos organization
is identified as the source of the
SLA early in the report: "Prior to
its recent disbanding, the
Venceremos organization began a
wholesale indoctrination program

to develop revolutionary cadres in
the prisons which resulted in the
formation of the Symbionese
Liberation Army and the first
political kidnaping in this
country.
"Authorities believe that many
Venceremos organization
members have gone underground
and are active in small affinity
groups ...."
Later on in the report, a
"Venceremos Underground" is
spoken of as an existing, formal
organization that continues to
work with political groups inside
prisons.
Positions Differ
The official position of
Venceremos on the role of armed
struggle in the revolutionary
process differs from that of the
SLA. Venceremos always stressed
that for armed action to be
meaningful, it must be connected
with legal, public political work
and a disciplined party
organization.

The SLA has said that armed
action by underground groups
isolated from public political
work can spark a full-fledged
armed revolutionary struggle
against the government.
Although the two positions on
armed struggle are distinct, former
Venceremos members have
confirmed that it would have been
possible to hold an SLA-type
position within Venceremos as a
minority viewpoint.
According to one former
Venceremos member: "It is
a | political J waste of time [to
emphasize] denying that there are
links [between the defunct
Venceremos organization and the
SLA) .. . There clearly are some
links."
As this same ex-Venceremos
member put it, the group
explored affiliation with the
Eldridge Cleaver-alligned New
York Black Panthers, and after
the dissolution of Venceremos
some surviving Bay Area
collectives have endorsed the
Black Liberation Army (formed
from the Cleaver faction of the
Panthers), including the BLA's
support of the SLA.

might aid the government in
apprehending those persons who
bombed the office of the state
attorney general in Los Angeles
on May 31.
Behind Prison Walls
Another focus of the report is
on political organizing behind
prison walls and on the possible
recruitment of individuals from
"less action-prone revolutionary
organizations (into] the smaller
well-disciplined terrorist
organizations in order for them to
fulfill a more active role such as
that of the Symbionese Liberation
Army."
The Venceremos organization
is identified as the source of the
SLA early in the report: "Prior to
its recent disbanding, the
Venceremos organization began a
wholesale indoctrination program

to develop revolutionary cadres in
the prisons which resulted in the
formation of the Symbionese
Liberation Army and the first
political kidnaping in this
country.
"Authorities believe that many
Venceremos organization
members have gone underground
and are active in small affinity
groups ...."
Later on in the report, a
"Venceremos Underground" is
spoken of as an existing, formal
organization that continues to
work with political groups inside
prisons.
Positions Differ
The official position of
Venceremos on the role of armed
struggle in the revolutionary
process differs from that of the
SLA. Venceremos always stressed
that for armed action to be
meaningful, it must be connected
with legal, public political work
and a disciplined party
organization.

The SLA has said that armed
action by underground groups
isolated from public political
work can spark a full-fledged
armed revolutionary struggle
against the government.
Although the two positions on
armed struggle are distinct, former
Venceremos members have
confirmed that it would have been
possible to hold an SLA-type
position within Venceremos as a
minority viewpoint.
According to one former
Venceremos member: "It is
a | political J waste of time [to
emphasize] denying that there are
links [between the defunct
Venceremos organization and the
SLA) .. . There clearly are some
links."
As this same ex-Venceremos
member put it, the group
explored affiliation with the
Eldridge Cleaver-alligned New
York Black Panthers, and after
the dissolution of Venceremos
some surviving Bay Area
collectives have endorsed the
Black Liberation Army (formed
from the Cleaver faction of the
Panthers), including the BLA's
support of the SLA.

But all evidence indicates that
Venceremos as a formal
organization has ceased to exist.
In the words of former Stanford
English Prof. Bruce Franklin:
'There is no organization....
There is no central committee;
there is no newspaper; there is no
nothing."
Sources in radical groups
around the Bay Area agree that
there is no functioning
Venceremos Underground as
described in the report.
At present the status of the
former members of Venceremos
takes three forms. A few (not
"many" as described by the
report) have joined underground
armed groups that operate only in
secret and do not engage in open
political organizing. But
ex-members of Venceremos
concur that this is a small
minority.
A second group of former
members are individually involved
in reform groups such as ecology
action groups or labor unions. In
the course of their recent political
evolution, these former members
have come to place less emphasis
on revolutionary race-related
social problems and on armed
struggle.
A third group of former
members are still organized in
political collectives, such as the
one active in Palo Alto. These

collectives are deeply involved at
present in efforts to consolidate
their past practical political
experience and organizational
work qnd to form a new national
communist party.
About half of the collective in
Palo Alto reacted very negatively
to the activities of the SLA. These
members viewed the SLA actions
as counterproductive, isolated
terrorism, a few thought probably
initiated by an internal police
provocateur. But the other half of
the collective argued that the
adventurism of the SLA was of far
less danger to the revolutionary
process than the reformist
strategy of social democratic
groups.
Generally, the existing
collectives which survive as
remnants of the old Venceremos
agree that "it is absolutely clear,"
as one former member put it, that
the future nation-wide communist
party "must have an underground
military apparatus" attached to it.
The surviving collectives are
part of an on-going national
dialogue among Maoist groups
that are trying to build a new
party. A source in the Palo Alto
collective indicated that it appears
likely that a political group called
the Communist League may be
"the core" of such a new
formation, to which the Palo Alto
group might adhere.

Political organizing in
California prisons by the radical
Venceremos organization was the
cause of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA),
according to a report issued
yesterday by State Attorney
General Evelle Younger.
Independent investigation by
the Daily shows that there are
errors in the report. The
formation of the SLA was an
undertaking independent of
Venceremos. Some people,
however, appear to have been
associated with both groups.
Venceremos was a
revolutionary communist group
which began in Palo Alto and
Redwood City and spread
throughout the entire Bay Area. It
was founded in early 1969, added
as members large numbers of
persons who left the
Revolutionary Union in late 1970,
and dissolved in the fall of 1973.

The report on "Terrorism in
California" was prepared by the
California Department of Justice.

attorney general in Los Angeles
