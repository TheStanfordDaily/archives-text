# Younger Study Contains Errors
## Report Cites SLA-Venceremos Links

Political organizing in
California prisons by the radical
Venceremos organization was the
cause of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA),
according to a report issued
yesterday by State Attorney
General Evelle Younger.
Independent investigation by
the Daily shows that there are
errors in the report. The
formation of the SLA was an
undertaking independent of
Venceremos. Some people,
however, appear to have been
associated with both groups.
Venceremos was a
revolutionary communist group
which began in Palo Alto and
Redwood City and spread
throughout the entire Bay Area. It
was founded in early 1969, added
as members large numbers of
persons who left the
Revolutionary Union in late 1970,
and dissolved in the fall of 1973.

The report on "Terrorism in
California" was prepared by the
California Department of Justice.
The report is partly directed at
disseminating information that
might aid the government in
apprehending those persons who
bombed the office of the state
attorney general in Los Angeles
on May 31.
Behind Prison Walls
Another focus of the report is
on political organizing behind
prison walls and on the possible
recruitment of individuals from
"less action-prone revolutionary
organizations (into] the smaller
well-disciplined terrorist
organizations in order for them to
fulfill a more active role such as
that of the Symbionese Liberation
Army."
The Venceremos organization
is identified as the source of the
SLA early in the report: "Prior to
its recent disbanding, the
Venceremos organization began a
wholesale indoctrination program

to develop revolutionary cadres in
the prisons which resulted in the
formation of the Symbionese
Liberation Army and the first
political kidnaping in this
country.
"Authorities believe that many
Venceremos organization
members have gone underground
and are active in small affinity
groups ...."
Later on in the report, a
"Venceremos Underground" is
spoken of as an existing, formal
organization that continues to
work with political groups inside
prisons.
Positions Differ
The official position of
Venceremos on the role of armed
struggle in the revolutionary
process differs from that of the
SLA. Venceremos always stressed
that for armed action to be
meaningful, it must be connected
with legal, public political work
and a disciplined party
organization.

The SLA has said that armed
action by underground groups
isolated from public political
work can spark a full-fledged
armed revolutionary struggle
against the government.
Although the two positions on
armed struggle are distinct, former
Venceremos members have
confirmed that it would have been
possible to hold an SLA-type
position within Venceremos as a
minority viewpoint.
According to one former
Venceremos member: "It is
a | political J waste of time [to
emphasize] denying that there are
links [between the defunct
Venceremos organization and the
SLA) .. . There clearly are some
links."
As this same ex-Venceremos
member put it, the group
explored affiliation with the
Eldridge Cleaver-alligned New
York Black Panthers, and after
the dissolution of Venceremos
