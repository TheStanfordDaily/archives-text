## Death Penalty 
### 
Last week, a San Mateo Superior Court jury sentenced 20-year-old
John Kreuter to die in the gas chamber.
The jury did so almost unwittingly, and perhaps, unwillingly. The
new California capital punishment law gave the jury no choice.
According to the law, if explicitly defined "special circumstances"
exist, the death penalty is mandatory.
Kreuter was convicted of the first-degree murder of Liana Hughes,
a Palo Alto housewife, in February. The jury found that Kreuter
committed kidnapping and rape in the commission of the crime, and
thus must, under law, die.
The defense attorney had no right to persuade the jury that
Kreuter should not be sentenced to death. He could not cite the
defendant's youth or any other mitigating factor. In fact, the judge
even barred the defense attorney from discussing the death penalty
before the jurors.
Under the new law, the individual is not considered, only the
offense. It represents the ultimate in dictatorial justice. The new
capital punishment law was enacted in an attempt to circumvent the
Supreme Court's 1972 decision to bar the death penalty. The court
ruled that the haphazard and discriminatory way in which the penalty
was imposed made it "cruel and unusual punishment" under the
eighth amendment to the Constitution.
Almost before the ink was dry on the decision, state legislatures
across the country began implementing "the will of the people" by
passing capital punishment laws through the loopholes of the court
decision.
We oppose capital punishment under any law. The imposition of
the death penalty serves no purpose other than blood lust, and the
country would be better off if the Supreme Court eliminated it once
and for all.
But we even more strongly oppose the new capital punishment law,
which represents a giant step toward an automated system of justice.
