# Celebration of Gay Pride

"Gay Pride" permanently left
the dictionary of political rhetoric
last week for the Stanford Gay
community as we celebrated Gay
Pride Week. In conferences and
meetings we explored what it
means to be gay from all
perspectives — religious, political,
personal and interpersonal.
Nationally known speakers such
as Dr. Howard Brown, Sheriff
Richard Hongisto and Barbara
Gittings, joined us, spoke, and
listened.
What began as an exploration
of what it means to be gay ended
up as a celebration of our life
style. The Angels of Light
provided ethereal camp
entertainment. On Saturday night
we provided our own, dancing on

the roof of Tresidder.
The final event of the week
was a parade in San Francisco. It
is hard to describe the joy of
solidarity that comes of marching
down the street, shoulder to
shoulder, like a giant Greek line
dance.
We began with only six rows of
people, but as we marched one
could see on the faces of the
people on the sidewalks that they
were dying to join us. And many
did: near the end of the parade I
looked behind me and saw two
solid city blocks of people behind
the Stanford banner — what the
Chronicle called "a few pallid
exceptions (to the drag queen
entouragees) in the rear ranks."
Farther From Closet
As a result of the week all of us
are farther out of the closet.
People who two weeks ago would
not » be photographed in a
publicity picture did television
spots and marched. We have taped
TV and radio shows. We are all
that much more public, and that
much freer.
The week produced no heroes.
We were all our own heroes and at
the same time we were all each
other's heroes. Such is social
liberation.
We have a higher consciousness
of our oppression, a greater
determination to do something
about it, a greater sense of the
value of our life .style and what it
has to offer American society.
For the support and assistance
we received from the Stanford
administration, and from Dean
Kelly of the chapel, we are deeply
thankful. Such support was
inconceivable as recently as a year
ago.

The Gay People's Union
received the following anonymous
letter last week:
"The two guys carrying the
Stanford banner at yesterday's
parade in the city were beautiful!
I felt so proud of them. Who
knows, I probably run across
them on campus every day and
was not even aware that we share
a common love for men.
"I had a very strong urge to
join them, but, as usual, fear kept
me away — it's so hard to kick
that habit!! But I'm trying."
To the writer of this letter and
the other hundreds of gay
brothers and sisters who occupy
the closet space of the Stanford
dorms I have one thing to say:
Come out. I know how
oppressively straight the
atmosphere at Stanford is with its
"tennis anyone?" adolescent,
ingenue affectation on the one
hand and jock atmosphere on the
other.
Fight Complacency
But you know what that is
worth. While we must not be
complacent with what we have
achieved, we are winning real
victories for ourselves, and for all
of humanity at the same tims.
Your fears of rejection by your
friends and relatives are largely
spooks of your imagination.
This is truly a great time to be
gay. You are in the Bay Area, the
gay capital of the world. You are
offered a taste of social and
personal freedom and liberation
the likes of which most people
will never know. Don't miss such
an opportunity to come closer to
realizing your potential as a truly
human, loving being.
