# USE Bargaining Benefits Extended To Faculty, Staff
## 
### 
The University this week extended increased health, holiday and
other assorted benefits to faculty and staff members.
The increased benefits come just over a month after the University
included similar benefit provisions in the contract with technical,
maintenance and service employees represented by the United
Stanford Employees (USE) union.
The contract settlement generated questions and complaints among
exempt staff and faculty wanting the increased benefits given USE to
be extended to all University employees.
In a memo to faculty and staff members outlining the increased
benefits for faculty and staff, Vice President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsburger said "these initial revisions in policies and benefits
will help, I hope, to answer some of your questions prompted by the
USE settlement.
"While many of the contract provisions deal with circumstances
unique to bargaining unit members, some are appropriately extended
to all Stanford employees," he said.
Among the new benefits and policies are: increased health
insurance contributions, additional time off for personal business, an
additional holiday each year and improvements in overtime and
premium pay.
