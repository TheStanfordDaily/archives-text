# Hospital Directors Raise Room Rates
## 
### 
Stanford Hospital rates for
rooms and services increase 11.5
percent, starting today.
The rise in rates reflects the
increases for nurses, who voted
yesterday on a wage proposal that
ended the 11-day strike.
Wage adjustment for
non-contractual employees and
higher operation costs were also a
factor in the increases, said
hospital and clinics director Paul
Hoffman.
The Hospital directors voted to
raise the daily room rates between
$12.50 and $15.50.
Effective today the rates will
be $100 for ward, $108 for
semi-private room and $122.50
for a private room.
The University of California
Medical Center charges $114 for a
ward, $119 for a semi-private
room and $122 for a private
room.
However, the rates at
community, non-teaching El
Camino Hospital in Mountain
View are considerably lower: $70
for a ward, $74 for a semi-private
and $79 for a private room.
Last May Stanford Hospital
increased its rate by 9 percent,
after the lift on wage and price
controls.

In April, the hospital charged
$78 per day for a ward, $85 for a
semi-private room and $95.50 for
a private room.
Previous cost increases were
forced as "an effort to recover
costs already incurred by the
hospital" due to inflation and
employee merit raises, Hoffman
said.

REPLAY—If you were here last summer, this scene probably looks familiar. This time, though, the
University is not moving Stillman-Columbae House, but the Delta Upsilon fraternity house. New location
for the house this fall will be between Stillman-Columbae and the Beta Theta Pi frat house on Lasuen.
