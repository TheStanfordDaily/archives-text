# USE Members OK Increase In Union Dues
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
United Stanford Employees
(USE) members have approved an
increase in dues, the union
announced Friday.
By a 354-265 vote, union
members decided that dues would
be raised from two-tenths of one
percent of base pay to a full one
percent of base pay, beginning
August 1.
The dues increase is applicable
to all workers in the
1400-member bargaining unit
represented by USE. Twenty-eight
percent of the members of the
unit are not members of USE, but
they will be required as a
condition of employment to pay
the equivalent of union dues.
Ballots were counted during a
USE membership meeting,
attended by 55 people, in
Tresidder room 270-1.
At the meeting, members voted
28-16 to require all persons to pay
the new one percent dues, even if
they had previously paid dues in
advance.
The vote reversed an earlier
executive committee decision to
exempt all persons who had paid
dues in advance before April 28
from the new dues increase for
the duration of their paid-up
period.
The dues increase will help the
union pay unpaid bills of over
$2000 incurred during USE's
three-week strike during spring
quarter.
USE treasurer Karl Schroeder
estimated that the total cost of
the strike was over $10,000.
USE's parent union. Service
Employees International Union,
paid $7000 of this.
At the meeting, USE President
Jim Berk said that the union was
now trying to organize Stanford
Hospital workers into one or more
officially recognized bargaining
units. Berk predicted, "We'll have
1000 to 1500 more people under
contract within six months."
