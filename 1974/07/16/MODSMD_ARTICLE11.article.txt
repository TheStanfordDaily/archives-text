# U.S. Military Revival Predicted
## By LAURIE TREUHAFT

By 1977 the American public
will want the military to receive
more priority in federal research
and development spending,
predicted Hans Mark, director of
the NASA-Ames Research Center
at Moffett Field.
Within the next three years,
there may be a change in the
public perception of our military
standing in relation to that of the
U.S.S.R., Mark told an audience
of about 50 in Skilling
Auditorium Thursday. 'The
Soviets probably are today and
certainly will be in three years,
the leading world naval power,"
he said.
By scrapping old ships and
then rebuilding them, the USSR
has maintained production of
major operational combat surface
ships at a constant, Mark
demonstrated. But the number of
U.S. ships has been decreasing,
because the government does not
rebuild U.S. "ships after they are
scrapped, he said.
Naval Supremacy
"My guess is that it is likely
that within the next three years,
some incident on the high seas
will cause something to happen
where we can't respond in kind
and must back down," he said. If
they have naval supremacy, the
Soviets could very well deny us

access to certain places, claimed
Mark.
In other areas such as
intercontinental ballistic missiles,
submarines, rockets, and
intercontinental bombers, U.S.
production has leveled off since
1967, while Soviet production has
continued to rise.
The U.S. and the Soviets are
now "substantially equal" in
missile delivery capacity, but
greater Soviet arms expenditures
could throw the balance of power
within the next three years and
have "interesting, perhaps
ominous political potential," he
observed.

Unless both nations can agree
on disarmament, Mark said, future
engineering training programs may
have to account for a public
demand that federal research and
development funds be
redistributed to favor the military.
For this reason, engineers must be
aware of the extent to which
technology becomes a matter of
public policy, he added.
Nothing In Constitution
This will be difficult because
public policy toward technology
varies with time and
circumstances, as there are no
constitutional sanctions for
government involvement in
technology, Mark said.

In the last 10 or 15 years after
World War II the government has
poured more research and
development funds into
regulatory agencies such as the
Federal Aviation Administration
and the Food and Drug
Administration, in keeping with a
policy which has increasingly
emphasized protection of the
public health and safety, Mark
commented.
As a result of this trend, the
military is presently allotted $8
billion out of a $22 billion federal
research and development budget,
as compared to the 50-90 percent
of federal resources it received 25
years ago, he said.
