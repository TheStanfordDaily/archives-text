# Prof Explains 'Higher Consciousness’

### CAROL MOLDAW 
"Conventional knowledge
cannot transform the inner self,"
Design Engineering Prof. James
Fadiman told a near capacity
audience at Tresidder Lounge
Thursday night while discussing
Transpersonal Psychology.
Transpersonal Psychology deals
with explorative knowledge that
leads to "the place where growth
of even evolution takes place,"
said Fadiman, while
"conventional knowledge is

designed for a particular level of
consciousness."
More then any other
psychology movement before it,
Transpersonal Psychology
synthesizes religious mysticism
and scientific knowledge, he said.
According to Fadiman it deals
with "that which is beyond the
personal or through the personal."
It is not concerned solely with the
individual, "but with something
beyond that, more actual than
personality itself, more entire

than the Self," said Fadiman.
Transpersonal Psychologists are
interested in phenomena such as
ESP, dreams and dream control,
mental telepathy and the "general
question of energies," Fadiman
said. "There are other kinds of
energy that don't fit into the
electro-magnetic spectrum" and
these energies should be explored,
he urged.
Fadiman named three methods
which are common tools for
raising one's consciousness —
drugs, meditation, and psychic
healing. Drugs, he said, aid in the
discovery of another level, so that
"you no longer have to assume
this is the only place there is."
He called meditation an "easy
access" to another level of
consciousness because it quiets
the normal level of consciousness
and allows other levels "to be
more visible."

Fadiman also claimed that
almost all illnesses can be proven
psychosomatic. "As you change
your mind about consciousness,
you change your body about it
too," he said, which can lead to
psychic healing.
Historical Perspective
Fadiman also gave an historical
perspective of psychology
movements, starting with Freud,
which preceded Transpersonal
Psychology. Before Transpersonal
Psychology, he said, "God wasn't
dead in psychology, he was never
invited in to discuss the issue."
Freud based his models on
immorality, and dealt with a
pessimistic view of man, who can
never win or overcome his
problems.
In contrast, during this same
period, B.F. Skinner, and
behaviorists, dealt with amorality
and called morality, emotions,
personality and the Self all
fictions which are predictable and
controllable.
A reaction to both of these
movements was Humanism, which
dealt with health, normalcy,
authenticity and meaning. . .
"things that matter instead of
easy to measure."
Optimistic View
Fadiman said that the
Humanists soon found that "as
you keep going for the best in
people you get to some very odd
areas," which didn't always fit the
Humanists' optimistic view of
people.
Transpersonal Psychology grew
as "esoteric and hidden
knowledge, which was never
available to man, became available
in paperback."
