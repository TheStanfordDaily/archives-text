### JAY HARLOW 
OAKLAND—It's been a few
years since Crosby, Stills, Nash
and Young made their last
appearances and split up. But this
summer's CSN&Y reunion tour is
proving well worth the wait.
Backed by The Band, Joe
Walsh and Barnstorm and Jesse
Colin Young, the quartet drew
76,228 listeners to its two
performances in the Oakland
Coliseum Saturday and Sundayf
David Crosby, Steve Stills and
Graham Nash hit the stage around
3:30 Sunday afternoon, opening
with Stills' "Love the One You're
With." After "Wooden Ships,"
they were joined by Neil Young
for Nash's "Immigration Man."
Most of their tunes were
familiar, either from their three
albums together or their various
solo efforts. A few were new
songs, presumably recorded in
their recent sessions in L.A.
The rest of the opening set
included a new Young song,
"Traces," Nash's "Grave
Concern," Stills' "Black Queen"
(not the solo acoustic version, but
a heavier electric one), and
"Ohio."
Throughout the afternoon, the
band seemed relaxed and
confident, a long way from their
"scared shitless" state at
Woodstock. Stills' guitar is as

good as ever, but his voice has
suffered over the last few years.
Crosby and Nash still provide the
best vocal harmonies anyone
could ask for, and Young's guitar,
voice and lyrics add several
dimensions to the band's range of
sounds and moods.
The four were backed in the
electric sets by bass and drums,
and by Joe Lala (of Manassas) on
congas. The introductions of the
former two got lost in the crowd's
enthusiastic response, but they
held together the sound perfectly
without ever being really
noticeable.
Switching to acoustic guitars
for their "wooden" set, they
opened with "Suite: Judy Blue
Eyes," followed by "Helplessly
Hoping." Group numbers
alternated with solo songs, with
each member taking the spotlight
for a few of his own songs. Young
took the lead with "Only Love
Can Break Your Heart," then
Crosby and Nash joined for "Lee
Shore." Nash's solo was his recent
"Prison Song," while Crosby's was
a Joni Mitchell tune, "For Free,"
the only song not written by one
of the four.
Young was next with two new
tunes, one in remembrance of his
1948 Buick Roadmaster, the
other a rambling collection of
cynical comments and bits of

advice. Then the four regrouped
for "Sugar Mountain" and
"Change Partners." Stills closed
the acoustic set with "Know You
Got to Run"and "Word Game,"
two of his more preachy numbers.
Young started off the last
electric set with "Don't Be
Denied," followed by a new Stills
composition, "First Things First."
This set provided most of the best
instrumental moments, including
Stills' and Crosby's guitars and
Young's piano on "Deja vu."
The band gradually stretched
out for the rest of the afternoon,

taking longer and more
complicated solos and jams on
"Pre-Road Downs" and "Long
Time Comin'." Another
many-faceted Young opus,
"Revolution Blues," followed,
then they closed with a hard,
rocking "Carry On."
The first, fairly automatic
encore was "Chicago," then the
band left the stage again. The
audience, however, demanded
more, and after ten minutes or so
of applause and shouting, they got
a repeat of the opening tune,
"Love the One You're With."

The Band preceded CSN&Y,
and played an hour or so of
competent but not too exciting
rock. Familiar songs like "Stage
Fright," "The Weight," "The
Night They Drove Old Dixie
Down" and "Across the Great
Divide" drew the most applause,
but the band and the crowd
generally seemed a bit bored with
the music, making for an
uninspired performance.
Joe Walsh, however, wound up
the morning partof the show with
some very impressive guitar work.
