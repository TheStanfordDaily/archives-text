# The 						National Tour's Fine Beginning
## 
### ROD KOON 
SEATTLE—Jesse Colin Young
had the task of warming up
17,000 people at the Seattle
Coliseum Tuesday night, July 9,
and with fine showmanship and
songs like "Sunlight" (from his
Youngbloods days) "Lightshine"
and "A Song for Julia" he
succeeded quite well. Before
leaving the stage he said, "This is
the first night of the tour and I
know it will go down in history."
By the end of the evening few
people would have disagreed with
that statement.
The Crosby, Stills, Nash, and
Young performance of that
evening was one of the best, and
certainly one of the longest rock
concerts that Northwest fans have
ever enjoyed. They came out
playing an electric set which
started with "Love the One
You're With" (written by Stills),
then "Wooden Ships," (Stills and
Crosby), "Immigration Man,"
(Nash), and "Cowgirl in the
Sand," (Young). Throughout the
evening the foursome shared the
spotlight, individually and
together, playing musical chairs
from guitars to pianos and back
again.
Aside from their old material,
which kept the crowd noisy in
appreciation, a few new songs
were done, most notably 'Traces"
by Neil Young. After playing
"Almost Cut My Hair" (which
could have been dedicated to
short-haired Neil Young) the
group dedicated its last song to
Donald Segretti. The song?

"Ohio."
The second set started out
acoustically, with just Crosby,
Stills, and Nash on stage, doing
"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes." This was
one of the few weak moments of
the night, since they seemed to
forget the words, and had to
retrace their steps over one verse
to get going again. It's a wonder
that Stills didn't break out
laughing. Soon after this,
"Helplessly Hoping" and Graham
Nash's "Prison Song," were
included.
During the evening the group
did only two songs which were
not theirs. One was Lennon and
McCartney's "Blackbird," done in
faultless four-part harmony, and
the other was a solo effort by
Crosby of a song by his favorite
songwriter, Joni Mitchell, "One
Man Band."
After Crosby and Nash joined
together for "Guinneveire" and
"Southbound Train," Nash soloed
on piano for his "Sleep Song" and
"Our House."
After having played for 90
minutes, Nash admitted that they
could have come out and done a
big slic# show, but they'd prefer
to just sit around and play a lot of

songs that they liked. And that's
just what they did. Though they
started playing at 9:30, it was past
1:30 in the morning when they
wound it all up for the evening.
Aside from a few too many new
electric songs, the show never
really dragged. Even at the end of
four hours of playing, they had
the sellout crowd yelling for
more.
Overall, it was an enthusiastic
atmosphere for both audience and
group. There was enough
handshaking and backslapping
between the four on stage to
make it look like a political rally:
a political rally with 17,000 loyal
followers.
What is so amazing about
Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young is
that they perform so well as a
group, and yet still let each
member do enough solo material
on guitar and piano to make it
seem like the talent is unlimited.
And it might be.
Though some songs were sung
solo, many that had been solos on
their albums took on a new depth.
One example is "4 and 20," a
Stills solo effort from the group's
Deja Vu album, which was
performed in four-part harmony.

atmosphere for both audience and
group. There was enough
handshaking and backslapping
between the four on stage to
make it look like a political rally:
a political rally with 17,000 loyal
followers.
What is so amazing about
Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young is
that they perform so well as a
group, and yet still let each
member do enough solo material
on guitar and piano to make it
seem like the talent is unlimited.
And it might be.
Though some songs were sung
solo, many that had been solos on
their albums took on a new depth.
One example is "4 and 20," a
Stills solo effort from the group's
Deja Vu album, which was
performed in four-part harmony.

SEATTLE—Jesse Colin Young
had the task of warming up
17,000 people at the Seattle
Coliseum Tuesday night, July 9,
and with fine showmanship and
songs like "Sunlight" (from his
Youngbloods days) "Lightshine"
and "A Song for Julia" he
succeeded quite well. Before
leaving the stage he said, "This is
the first night of the tour and I
know it will go down in history."
By the end of the evening few
people would have disagreed with
that statement.
The Crosby, Stills, Nash, and
Young performance of that
evening was one of the best, and
certainly one of the longest rock
concerts that Northwest fans have
ever enjoyed. They came out
playing an electric set which
started with "Love the One
You're With" (written by Stills),
then "Wooden Ships," (Stills and
Crosby), "Immigration Man,"
(Nash), and "Cowgirl in the
Sand," (Young). Throughout the
evening the foursome shared the
spotlight, individually and
together, playing musical chairs
from guitars to pianos and back
again.
Aside from their old material,
which kept the crowd noisy in
appreciation, a few new songs
were done, most notably 'Traces"
by Neil Young. After playing
"Almost Cut My Hair" (which
could have been dedicated to
short-haired Neil Young) the
group dedicated its last song to
Donald Segretti. The song?

"Ohio."
The second set started out
acoustically, with just Crosby,
Stills, and Nash on stage, doing
"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes." This was
one of the few weak moments of
the night, since they seemed to
forget the words, and had to
retrace their steps over one verse
to get going again. It's a wonder
that Stills didn't break out
laughing. Soon after this,
"Helplessly Hoping" and Graham
Nash's "Prison Song," were
included.
During the evening the group
did only two songs which were
not theirs. One was Lennon and
McCartney's "Blackbird," done in
faultless four-part harmony, and
the other was a solo effort by
Crosby of a song by his favorite
songwriter, Joni Mitchell, "One
Man Band."
After Crosby and Nash joined
together for "Guinneveire" and
"Southbound Train," Nash soloed
on piano for his "Sleep Song" and
"Our House."
After having played for 90
minutes, Nash admitted that they
could have come out and done a
big slic# show, but they'd prefer
to just sit around and play a lot of

songs that they liked. And that's
just what they did. Though they
started playing at 9:30, it was past
1:30 in the morning when they
wound it all up for the evening.
Aside from a few too many new
electric songs, the show never
really dragged. Even at the end of
four hours of playing, they had
the sellout crowd yelling for
more.
Overall, it was an enthusiastic
atmosphere for both audience and
group. There was enough
handshaking and backslapping
between the four on stage to
make it look like a political rally:
