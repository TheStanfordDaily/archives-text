# From The Director Of 'Klute'
## 'Parallax View' Adds A New Conspiracy 
### GEORGE POWELL 
The post-Watergate morality,
of which so much has been
written, seems to have spawned a
more unbelieving, questioning
look on the part of film makers,
too. As various committee
reports, tapes and other evidence
of President Nixon and his cronies
leaks out to the public, movie
makers are hard put to find scripts
that top these daily revelations.
The Parallax View, is the
newest entry in the conspiracy
theory movie sweepstakes, a
popular genre these days as people
ask each other the question,
"Who's really in charge here,
anyway?"
Director Alan Pakula, who had

audiences thrilled and chilled in
Klute, his last suspense movie,
succeeds in making almost
everything and everyone suspect
in this film, too. Everyone except
Warren Beatty, that is, who
portrays an investigative reporter
(eat your heart out, Robert
Redford), who has reason to
believe that a popular,
Kennedy-type senator was
knocked off by a secret
organization.
Although Beatty was there at
the assassination, which takes
place in the revolving restaurant
atop the Seattle space needle, he
doesn't begin to believe in the
conspiracy theory until fellow
newsperson Paula Prentiss dies

under mysterious circumstances.
Mysterious to Beatty, at least,
because she dies just shortly after
appearing at his apartment door,
hysterical and fearful for her life.
So with the help of his
sympathetic managing editor,
Hume Cronyn, Beatty undertakes
an investigation that makes what
Bernstein and Woodward did look
as easy as finding water in a
rainstorm. In the course of his
investigation, Beatty comes to
believe that the Parallax
Corporation, a mysterious
security organization, is nothing
more than a front for an
assassination bureau.
In one of the all-time
foolhardy ploys, Beatty attempts

to infiltrate the organization,
making them think he is a
psychopathic person who can pass
their psychological tests and
become a loyal member of
Parallax Corp. Beatty's only
contact with the outside world in
this venture is his managing
editor, so imagine the possibilities
for success.
Although this plot seems a bit
contrived (the parallels with
Robert Kennedy's death are
almost too obvious), Pakula
manages to keep the whole thing
within the realm of believability,
thanks to a rugged (but hardly
journalistic) performance by
Beatty and an excellent
supporting cast.

Cinematographer Gordon Wills,
who also photographed Klute does
a similar job in The Parallax View,
with unnerving camera angles and
dark shadows making everything
look slightly ominous.
The fact that there's some real
drama in this movie sets it miles
above the other current
assassination theory movie,
Executive Action, which was
released last fall. Nothing was
shocking or strange in Executive
Action. Everyone knew that JFK
was going to be shot, and the
alleged protagonists weren't very
interesting or frightening.
The Parallax View, however,
takes a lesson from The
Manchurian Candidate, that 1962
classic thriller about political
assassination which kept the
audience guessing right up to the
climax. But in 1974, so much has
happened that very little is needed
to get people to accept the
possibility of a conspiracy, and
the probability that efforts to
uncover it will fail.
With the John Birch Society
and long-time conspiracy theorists
like Mae Brussell agreeing that the
Warren Report on the
assassination of President John
Kennedy was a cover-up, it's
obvious an ever-widening segment
of the public is becoming
skeptical of official answers to the
events that shook the country in
the 19605. The Parallax View adds
another sizeable log to the
skeptics' fires.
