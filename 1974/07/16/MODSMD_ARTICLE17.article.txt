### 
And the rich keep getting
richer. .. .
One of the nation's top junior
tennis players, Bill Maze of
Orinda, will enroll at Stanford in
September.
Maze, after long deliberation
between USC, UCLA, California
and Stanford, sent a letter of
intent to Card tennis coach Dick
Gould last week.
"I'm sure Bill will help us a lot
before he gets through here,"
Gould said. "He has a big serve
and good groundstrokes."
Maze was the top-ranked
player in boys' 16 singles two
years ago. He recently won the
Pacific Coast Juniors at Tiburon.
Along with Maze, Stanford
recruited Perry Wright, a top
junior from Los Angeles who will
enter college a year early, and
Peter Morris, a star at Gunn High
School in Palo Alto. Morris joins
Mark Mitchell and Nick Saviano as
Gunn players attending Stanford.
All three will have a tough time
breaking into the lineup of the
national champion Cardinals, with
Maze rating the best shot.
UCLA recruited the one best
high school senior, Bill Martin of
Palos Verdes, while USC grabbed
two other stars, Bruce Manson
and Chris Lewis.
In other tennis news,
Stanford's four All-Americans,
Jim Delaney, John Whitlinger,
Chico Hagey and Saviano, along
with Pat DuPre, who might have
been All-American had he not
been injured, have been named to
the nine-man junior Davis Cup
(21-and-under) team. Maze and
Gene Mayer both were named to
the 18-and-under junior Davis Cup
team.
