## WFL Good, But Not Revolutionary 
### Vlae Kershner 
Sorry, Gary Davidson.
I saw the TV debut of your
latest creation, The World
Football League last Thursday,
and wasn't too impressed.
Now Gary, don't send my
oodles of PR releases showing
how WFL's exciting new rules are
revolutionizing the game and how
hundreds of thousands of fans are
breaking down turnstyles to get
in.
I know you tried. I know WFL
has orange-gold footballs, no fair
catch, no bump-and-run, no
kicked extra points, kickoffs from
the 30, various anti-field goal
measures, and colorful team
names.
I'll even concede that the
quality of play is better than the
AFL when it was formed,
although at the age of six at the
AFL debut I hand't yet qualified
for the god-given right of every
American male to be a Football

Expert.
But still, I wasn't too
impressed. I know you tried. But
pro football is unrevolutionizable,
to coin an 18-Letter word.
And all your rules changes,
which were designed to put more
scoring into pro football, didn't.
During the first week, only two of
the 12 teams scored more than 17
points. The average team scored a
little less than two touchdowns.
Oh, I know, the point totals
will probably pick up as the
season goes on. But I bet they still
won't be much more than what
the old, dull National Football
League produces.
College Contrast
By way of contrast, look at our
team, Stanford. Our offense last
year was the worst in our league;
for half of the season, our running
game consisted of a handoff and a
prayer.

But still, our punchless
wonders got at least 20 points in
eight of 11 games. Some of the
more explosive college football
teams averaged close to 40 points
per game.
A lot of people say that college
coaches are more innovative than
staid pro coaches, and that that's
the reason the pro game isn't very
exciting.
Too Good
I don't buy that. The pro
coaches are very smart men. Too
smart. When a college coach, like
Tommy Prothro, comes in and
starts innovating, they take out
their charts and films and
computers and figure out how to
effectively neutralize the new
pattern. And then they tell the
players, who promptly execute
like the Bolshoi Ballet.
The pro game is just too damn
good for its own good, much like
men's tennis, where the top

players would shudder if they had
to return their own serves.
Minor rules changes just don't
make that much difference
(though allowing only one serve
would be a shot in the arm for
tennis).
That's been true in all of your
creations, Gary.
In the American Basketball
Association, the red-white-and
blue basketball, a team in Indiana
and Dr. J have been successes. The
three-point goal is, at best, a
minor attraction.
In the World Hockey
Association, sudden death hasn't
brought crowds to the gate, but a
King family named Howe has.
