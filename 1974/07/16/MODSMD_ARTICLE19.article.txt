Cyprus' President Overthrown
ATHENS — Cyprus National Guard officers apparently
seeking union with Greece overthrew Cypriot President
Archibishop Makarios yesterday.
The insurgents swore in newspaper publisher Nicos
Sampson as President. Sampson's newspapers advocate
union with Greece.
Early yesterday, Makarios was reported dead by the
national radio station in the capital city of Nicosia.
However, Makarios aired a statement from a hidden radio
station telling supporters he was alive.
Nakarios blamed the Greek military junta for the coup,
which was led by 650 army officers. The troops stormed
the Presidential palace and captured 942 reserve officers
loyal to Makarios.
Makarios also appealed to the United Nations to expel
"foreign intervention" in Cyprus and vowed to continue
to fight. The U.N. has a peace-keeping force of 2187 men
on Cyprus, but has not taken any action.
The U.S. government issued a statement warning
foreign powers — meaning Greece and Turkey — to stay
away from Cyprus. The Soviet Union demanded that
Greece end "open interference" in Cyprus.
Makarios, 60, is a Greek Orthodox Archibishop who led
the struggle of Greek Cypriots for independence from
Great Britain. He opposes union with Greece. The
Mediterranean island has a population of about one-half
million, with four-fifth of the citizens Greek and one-fifth
Turkish.
Yesterday, Turkish citizens living in Greek
neighborhoods were reported leaving their homes. Turkey
nearly declared war on Greece in 1964 because the
Turkish government felt that Greek rule would endanger
the lives of Turkish Cypriots.
Colson May Have Implicated Nixon
WASHINGTON — Former Presidential counsel Charles
Colson said yesterday that John Ehrlichman told him that
the President "ordered the operation" which led to the
break-in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
Colson refused to clarify that statement, which was
made to reporters after he testified before the House
Judiciary Committee, which is conducting an
impeachment inquiry.

However, two members of the House panel said that
Colson said that Nixon ordered the break-in. Other
members disagreed with that interpretation of Colson's
testimony.
According to one interpretation, Colson said that
Ehrlichman told him in April, 1973 of the President's role.
Colson said that Nixon reportedly justified the break-in as
a national security matter.
Colson is currently serving a one-to-three year prison
term for obstruction of justice by trying to defame
Ellsberg after he leaked the Pentagon Papers.
Conviets Surrender In DC Cellblock
WASHINGTON — Two convicts who have held a
cellblock in the Federal Courthouse in Washington, D.C.
since last Thursday were captured unharmed late last
night.
The convicts were reported to have surrendered to
police after an earlier escape attempt failed. The convicts,
Frank Gorham Jr. and Robert Jones, tried to hack their
way into the courthouse's ductwork, but were foiled by
police tear gas. Some shots were exchanged.
A day earlier, the convicts' seven hostages escaped after
68 hours of captivity, using a key smuggled into them.
Houston Mass-Murderer Convicted
SAN ANTONIO — A jury yesterday found Elmer
Wayne Henley guilty of the murders of six boys in
Houston. The killings are said to be part of a three-year
series of 27 sex-torture killings.
The jury took only one hour, 32 minutes to reach the
verdict. Henley's attorney presented no witnesses in his
behalf, though he did challenge the credibility of
prosecution witnesses.
Sentencing will be today.
Jury Selected In Reinecke Trial
WASHINGTON — A jury of six men and six women
was selected yesterday in the perjury trial of California
Lieutenant Governor Ed Reinecke. Judge Barrington Parker
told the jurors in Washington that they will be sequestered
for the trial, which he estimates will take a week to ten
days.
The indictment charges Reinecke with two counts of
perjury during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings

on the nomination of former attorney general Richard
Kleindienst.
Reinecke is accused of lying about conversations he had
with former attorney general John Mitchell about an
I.T.T. offer of $400,000 to the 1972 Republican
convention, if it were held in San Diego, where I.T.T.
owns a major hotel.
Reinecke claims that he lost his bid for the Republican
nomination for governor because of pre-trial publicity.
Nixon Asks OEO Chief To Resign
WASHINGTON - The director of the Office of
Economic Opportunity (OEO) reported yesterday that the
White House requested his resignation.
OEO chief Alvin Arnett said that Presidential counselor
Dean Burch requested his resignation because he has
lobbied against President Nixon's plan to abolish the
agency set up as part of President Johnson's "Great
Society" program.
The White House is expected to announce Arnett's
resignation today.

Douglas Stays City's Growth Ban
WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas yesterday granted the city of Petaluma,
California, a stay of a court order barring the city's
ordinance limiting its growth.
The ordinance, adopted in June, 1971 limits growth to
a rate which would eventually lead to a population of no
more than 55,000. Petaluma is a rapidly-growing city in
Sonoma County, on the fringe of metropolitan San
Francisco.
Douglas' order will give time for both sides to get the
matter before court. At that time, Douglas will decide
whether to extend the delay while the case is appealed by
the city or drop the stay, letting the lower court order
take effect.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow except for chance of
morning low clouds. Highs today and tomorrow in the mid
70s to lower 80s, low tonight in the 50s. Winds from the
northwest, 10-20 miles per hour.
