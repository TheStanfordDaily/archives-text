# $2194 Printing Deficit Shuts 'Chaparral' Down
## 
### DON COX 
Plagued by mounting financial
debts, the Stanford Chaparral will
be defunct by September unless a
"minor miracle" prevents its
demise, ASSU Financial Manager
Frank Olivieri said yesterday.
But even if they could get the
money, Olivieri said he would still
propose to the ASSU Publications
Board that they force the
Chaparral to close up shop
temporarily. This move would
permit proper managerial
reorganization, Olivieri said.
The Chaparral faces current
debts totalling $2194 and ASSU
faces an additional loss of $1107
because of the Chaparral. Only
$330 remains in Chaparral's ASSU
account which Olivieri recently
froze.
In addition to freezing the
account, Olivieri rekeyed the
Chaparrat office doors after
charging Chaparral Editor Mark
Lee with misuse of the office
space.
$2194 Debt
The $2194 debt is for
typesetting and printing done by
Atherton Advertising. Lee had
gone to Atherton Advertising with
an ASSU purchase order for $400.
He contracted them to do one
issue of the Chaparral.
Both Lee and Atherton
Advertising recognized that the
$400 purchase order would only
cover one-third of the total
printing charges, but Lee said he
anticipated additional income
with which to pay the bill.
Atherton Advertising let Lee
run up a $2194 bill despite a
warning on the actual purchase
order that "invoices will not be
honored for more than amount
shown [$400]."
"Even if Atherton Advertising

let themselves get smoothed
over," Olivieri said he "would just
as soon not leave the vendor
holding the bag but, rather, reach
an equitable settlement."
While Olivieri maintained the
matter was not his responsibility,
he said he was working with Lee
to try and resolve the problem.
Lee said he had sources who
could probably raise the money to
cover the debts. However, Olivieri
doubted Lee could raise much
since "so many groups really were
disenchanted with the
Chaparral's management."
Sleeping Quarters
"The driving force behind
changing locks on the 'Chappie'
was that I had received a report
that the 'Chappie' staff was using
the office for sleeping quarters
and that Lee had granted space to
a publication put together by
non-students but not affiliated
with Stanford," Olivieri
explained.
"Lee was making use of
facilities in a way that had to be
approved by the Pub Board. In
order to rectify the problem but
not wait till the Pub Board
reconvened in September, I took
it upon myself after consultation
with [Pub Board Chairman] Rich
Jaroslovsky and [Assistant to the
Dean of Student Affairs] Dale
Snape," Olivieri said.
Snape said it was illegal to let
non-students use Chaparral space
because this would violate the
University's tax exempt status.
The Chaparral is published by
the Chaparral Chapter of the
Hammer and Coffin National
Honorary Humor Society, a secret
club, as a feature magazine for
Stanford students.
The Chaparral is financed in
large part by grants from the

ASSU Pub Board and ASSU
maintains an account with this
money.
A trust fund established by the
Hammer and Coffin Society
originally helped finance the
Chaparral.
The fund has been reduced to
between $6000 and $7000 and is
held by the University. Lee
claimed the interest on the fund's
principal to finance the
