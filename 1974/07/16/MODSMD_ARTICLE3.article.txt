# Prof Blasts Prison 'Dehumanization’
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
"Fundamental human rights
and basic constitutional rights are
being denied, distorted, and
degraded" • by the conditions
under which persons are
"involuntarily incarcerated" in
San Quentin's Maximum
Adjustment Center, Psychology
Prof. Phil Zimbardo said
yesterday.
The "conditions are such as to
offend the sensibility of any
decent person .... Extreme
corporal punishment and/or
old-fashioned third degree
methods would be preferable" to
the solitary confinement, he
declared in a statement submitted
to Judge Alfonso Zirpoli in the
U.S. District Court for Northern
California.
Zimbardo, nationally known
for his creation of an artificial
prison on this campus, appeared
yesterday as an expert witness for
plaintiffs in the "San Quentin
Six" case, in which convicts
Johnny Spain, Hugo Pinell, Luis
Talamantez, Willie Tate, Fleeta
Drumgo and David Johnson are
seeking to abolish the prison's
adjustment center.
Zimbardo expanded on his
earlier written statement and is
scheduled for cross-examination
today.
Zimbardo's testimony was
based on interviews with the six
prisoners, observations of their
living conditions, discussions with
former inmates and staff of San
Quentin and a review of social
scientific literature concerning
total confinement.
Zimbardo described the
adjustment center's atmosphere as
one "of intimidation, fear,
control, domination, anonymity
and absence of any semblance of
human values."
Dehumanization
He emphasized the
"impersonality" of the entire
setting. "The physical

features ... all combine to create
an ecology of dehumanization —
for prisoner and guard alike." The
cells, he noted, were "stark,
sterile, drab in color, [and]
monotonous, without any
attempt to personalize it or to add
any esthetic elements."
Whenever prisoners leave their
cell, except for four hour-long
exercise periods each week, they
are "chained, handcuffed and
manacled," the report says.
Zimbardo's statement contains
notes of his extensive interviews
with the six prisoners. These
included numerous references to
being treated like animals, being
dehumanized, and being "abused"
and "humiliated" by the guards
and the system.
Unconducive To Needs
Zimbardo's report notes that
"adjustment to living freely in
society is predicated upon a need
for affiliation with others,
tolerance, some compassion,
empathy, role-taking abilities,
interpersonal trust, reciprocity,
and cooperation."
He found that "the entire
social atmosphere of the
Maximum Adjustment Center
could hardly be less conducive to
the fulfillment of any of these
societal imperatives."
The conditions of
confinement, Zimbardo observed,
give evidence to "a reduced need
for social affiliation... an
extreme sense of separation of self
from other people and the
environment.. . and a lessened
concern for social interaction and
satisfying needs of others."
Zimbardo's testimony included
references to his prison
experiment of 1971 in which a
group of psychologically healthy
volunteers were placed in various
prison roles. The experiment was
halted early because of the
extreme behavior of the
"convicts" some of whom
suffered emotional break-downs
and because of beatings carried
out by the "jailers."
Zimbardo pointed out that his
experiment shows that prisons can
be the cause of pathological
behavior of prisoners, while it has
usually been assumed that the
prisoners enter the institution
with pathological tendencies.
