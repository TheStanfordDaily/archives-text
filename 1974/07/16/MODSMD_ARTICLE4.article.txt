## Younger Report 
### 
The California Department of Justice's pamphlet "Terrorism in
California," that was sent to the news media throughout the state last
week, appears to be an attempt by Attorney General Evelle J.
Younger to bolster his reputation as a top-notch crime-fighter in the
eyes of the electorate.
Younger, who will be running for re-election against Democrat
William Norris in November, has used a common political ploy of
attempting to get free publicity by identifying with an issue on which
virtually everyone agrees.
Younger gives two reasons for distributing the pamphlet: to bring
the media "up to date on terrorism in California" and to ask the
media's "assistance in passing on the information" to its readers,
listeners or viewers, with the purpose of apprehending those persons
who bombed his Los Angeles office on May 31.
Perhaps Younger should add a third reason: to aid his bid for
re-election. Most people like nothing better than to hear of law
enforcement action against revolutionary groups.
The report itself empioys the effective use of scare tactics, grossly
exaggerating terrorist activity within the state. "California is
confronted by a broad spectrum of terrorism," the report asserts, and
then goes on to outline the history of terrorist activity, specifically as
it relates to prison-related groups.
The report also briefly describes various terrorist organizations in
the state, including the "Weatherman/Weather Underground," which
the report says is responsible for the bombing of Younger's office.
Another unforgivable aspect of the report is its apparent
inaccuracy in connection with Venceremos, the now-defunct
revolutionary communist group, which originated in Palo Alto.
The report states that "Prior to its recent disbanding, the
Venceremos Organization began a wholesale indoctrination program
to develop revolutionary cadres in the prisons which resulted in the
formation of the Symbionese Liberation Army...
An independent Daily investigation found that the formation of
the SLA was an undertaking independent of Venceremos, though
some people appear to have been associated with both groups.
The report also speaks of a "Venceremos Underground" as an
existing coherant organization, though all evidence indicates that
Venceremos, as a formal group, has ceased to exist.
There seems to be little use for a report of this type except to
spread unnecessary fear to the populace. Younger's office should let
the facts regarding terrorist groups stand for themselves and spend its
time doing things that will directly benefit the people of the state.
