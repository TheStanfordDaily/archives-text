# Justice Landmark
## 
### 
The convictions of John D. Ehrlichman, former chief domestic
affairs adviser to President Nixon, and co-defendants G. Gordon
Liddy, Bernard L. Barker and Eugenio R. Martinez for violating the
civil rights of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist represent a landmark in
American justice.
Through these convictions, the court system has once again
protected the rights of all citizens to be safeguarded from illegal
searches and seizures as provided by the Fourth Amendment â€” no
matter who has authorized or participated in that search.
These guilty verdicts reaffirm that high government position
cannot stand as a shield against retribution for illegal and immoral
activities and that the guilty, no matter how high up, can and will be
brought to justice for their crimes.
And too, these convictions stand as formal condemnation of the
sham of excusing illegal activities by claiming they were performed in
the interest of national security.
As Judge Gerhard Gesell advised the jurors in this case: "An
individual cannot escape criminal liability simply because he sincerely,
but incorrectly, believes that his acts are justified in the name of
patriotism, or national security or the need to create an unfavorable
press image or that his superiors had the authority to suspend without
a warrant the protections of the Fourth Amendment."
