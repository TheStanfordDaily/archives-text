# Warrenâ€™s Legacy
## 
### 
The death of Earl Warren reminds us that not all public servants
pursue power instead of serving the public conscientiously.
When President Eisenhower appointed him to the post of Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court, Warren responded with distinction.
The "Warren Court" made many momentous decisions. It
outlawed racial discrimination in schools, affirmed the "one man,one
vote" principle and stood up for the rights of defendants.
Many think that the Supreme Court, during the Warren years of
1953 to 1969, made erroneous decisions. Perhaps it did. But the
court, with Earl Warren at the forefront, ignored powerful political
interests and sincerely tried to guarantee us all the rights given us by
the Constitution.
For this, Warren will long be remembered.
