# Drop Frost Rock Ban
## 
### 
Joan E. Hinman

Many years ago on the banks
of the Big Bay, a man was killed
by a nice group of lads known as
the Hell's Angels who were
serving as security police at a
religious rite known as Altamont.
Because this religious gathering
had something to do with rock
music, and because the man's
death had occurred at a rock
music gathering that was
somewhat larger than the usual
10,000 person mob, the
kingdom's soothsayers proclaimed
the worst for such religious events
of the future.
'The Tragedy at Altamont," as
this particular rite came to be
called, was said to herald the end
of the Age of Woodstock, a
similar festival which had been
peaceful and wildly successful.
Henceforward, said the
soothsayers, all such events would
be violent, and the crowds would
be too fearful for life and limb to
gather for the rites.
Altamont was heralded as The
Day The Music Died.
Four years later, the
soothsayers were off eating Krogh
and more than a quarter of a
million worshipers had gathered at
Ontario for an unlikely
corporate-initiated rite called
California Jam.
Credit And Blame
The fable above is merely one
example of the way rock music
seems to get both credit and
blame for anything that happens
when people get together to listen
to sounds they enjoy. Somehow,
when violence occurs at a musical
event it is the music and not the
crowd that is condemned.
At Stanford, this strange
theory is incorporated in a ban on
"large attendance,
admission-charged" events, a
policy of the Office of Public
Events which pertains specifically
to Frost Amphitheater.
This ban stemmed from an
Elvin Bishop-Cold Blood concert
held at Frost on July 18, 1971,
during which several persons were

injured when fighting broke out.
As described at the time in the
Daily, the fighting was "sporadic"
and "never involved more than a
handful of the capacity crowd."
Rock Group Ban
Although the ban was placed
on all large concerts in Frost, over
the years Arthur Fiedler and the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band have
never been turned away — the ban
has evolved to a point where it is
only applied to rock groups.
Strangely enough, the two
groups whose presence has often
been cited as the cause of the
violence on the fateful day in
1971 had both played in Frost
before and not caused any
trouble.
Stranger still, I've seen Cold
Blood play everywhere from
Keystone Berkeley to Winterland
to the Santa Clara Fairgrounds to
the old Fillmore — seven concerts
in all, and no violence.
The point is that the kind of
music, even the presence of

particular artists, probably have as
much to do with whether violence
flares up as they have to do with
the occurrence of other natural
disasters such as typhoons and
earthquakes.
As a music critic, I wouldn't
call either Cold Blood (primarily
jazz-soul oriented) or Elvin Bishop
(the Bay's greatest blues guitarist)
rock artists, but the attempt by
the Daily or anyone else to define
each artist signed for Frost is
ludicrous.
Whether Loggins and Messina
are or are not rock artists is
irrelevant to whether ASSU
Special Events and University
Public Events can bring them here
safely. Rather than pegging a
band's genre, the Daily and the
officials concerned should look at
the question of making Frost once
again secure and accessable for all
bands and audiences.

ludicrous.

Many years ago on the banks
of the Big Bay, a man was killed
by a nice group of lads known as
the Hell's Angels who were
serving as security police at a
religious rite known as Altamont.
Because this religious gathering
had something to do with rock
music, and because the man's
death had occurred at a rock
music gathering that was
somewhat larger than the usual
10,000 person mob, the
kingdom's soothsayers proclaimed
the worst for such religious events
of the future.
'The Tragedy at Altamont," as
this particular rite came to be
called, was said to herald the end
of the Age of Woodstock, a
similar festival which had been
peaceful and wildly successful.
Henceforward, said the
soothsayers, all such events would
be violent, and the crowds would
be too fearful for life and limb to
gather for the rites.
Altamont was heralded as The
Day The Music Died.
Four years later, the
soothsayers were off eating Krogh
and more than a quarter of a
million worshipers had gathered at
Ontario for an unlikely
corporate-initiated rite called
California Jam.
Credit And Blame
The fable above is merely one
example of the way rock music
seems to get both credit and
blame for anything that happens
when people get together to listen
to sounds they enjoy. Somehow,
when violence occurs at a musical
event it is the music and not the
crowd that is condemned.
At Stanford, this strange
theory is incorporated in a ban on
"large attendance,
admission-charged" events, a
policy of the Office of Public
Events which pertains specifically
to Frost Amphitheater.
This ban stemmed from an
Elvin Bishop-Cold Blood concert
held at Frost on July 18, 1971,
during which several persons were

injured when fighting broke out.
As described at the time in the
Daily, the fighting was "sporadic"
and "never involved more than a
handful of the capacity crowd."
Rock Group Ban
Although the ban was placed
on all large concerts in Frost, over
the years Arthur Fiedler and the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band have
never been turned away — the ban
has evolved to a point where it is
only applied to rock groups.
Strangely enough, the two
groups whose presence has often
been cited as the cause of the
violence on the fateful day in
1971 had both played in Frost
before and not caused any
trouble.
Stranger still, I've seen Cold
Blood play everywhere from
Keystone Berkeley to Winterland
to the Santa Clara Fairgrounds to
the old Fillmore — seven concerts
in all, and no violence.
The point is that the kind of
music, even the presence of

particular artists, probably have as
much to do with whether violence
flares up as they have to do with
the occurrence of other natural
disasters such as typhoons and
earthquakes.
