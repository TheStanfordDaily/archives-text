# Carpenters' Strike Ends
## 
### DON COX 
Construction will resume today
at University building sites
following the reported settlement
yesterday of the month-long
Northern California carpenters'
strike.
Chuck Lochtefeld,
construction manager for Carl
Olson & Sons, contractor for the
law school complex, said he
expected some of the carpenters
will return to work today and
construction will resume a normal
level by next week.
Lochtefeld said business agents
for the carpenters' union and the
Associated General Contractors
(AGC) have signed a
memorandum of agreement on a
new contract. He added that
carpenters would vote Tuesday to
ratify the new contract.
"It would be pretty unlikely if
they don't ratify it," Lochtefeld
said.
Carpenters Picket
Construction at the law school
site has been crippled for the last
month because of the strike.
Carpenters started picketing
University construction sites
Wednesday forcing work
shut-downs. Construction halted
at the Hospital, the steam plant,
and the law school complex.
The pickets were removed
yesterday noon following
announcement of the settlement.
Planning Office Assistant
Construction Manager Hugh
Turner said he is "glad to see the
strike settled." However, other
unions currently involved in
contract negotiations may strike,
causing still more slow-downs at
University construction sites.
Ironworkers To Strike?
One of these unions, the
ironworkers' union, could cause
many problems, if they strike
before the roofs on the new law
school buildings are completed,
according to Turner. Without
roofs, the buildings could be
damaged by winter rains, Turner
said.
"But it's a long, hot summer
and I don't know what comes
next," he added.
The ironworkers' contract
expired June 30, and negotiations
are in progress, he added.
The electrical workers and
operating engineer, painter,
plasterer, and sheetmetal workers'
unions also have contracts that
expired last month. All of them
are currently negotiating new
agreements.
Turner said, however, these
unions "won't hurt us much" if
they strike.
The carpenters' strike and
earlier strikes by the laborers'
union and United Stanford
Employees (USE) union have
resulted in a two month delay in
the law school complex.
