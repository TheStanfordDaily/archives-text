# The 						Astronaut Who Saw God On The Moon
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Tomorrow marks the fifth anniversary of
one of man's greatest achievements ... the first step on
the moon. While that historic moon voyage and
subsequent flights have resulted in many important
scientific advancements, the 1971 journey of Apollo 15
remains a deeply spiritual experience for astronaut Jim
Irwin.)
By SRI KRISHN CHOPRA
"Did you see any rabbits on the moon?" asked Madame
Chiang Kai Shek of Jim Irwin, the eighth man to walk on
the surface of the moon.
"No," replied the s'B" soft-spoken lunar module pilot
of Apollo 15. The glow in his deep, dark eyes seemd to
add, "but I did see God."
"How did you know it was Him?" someone asked
during a talk about his moon trip to the International
Students Crossroads Festival in Colorado Springs, last
month. Jim smiled. He has a gentle smile which is at once
contagious.
"I knew it was God when I saw Earth looking like a
little marble from the moon. It looked the most beautiful
marble you can imagine because everything you love was
in that marble. I saw God when I saw the perfect plan of
our Earth from space...."
Forty-four foreign students (nine of them Stanford
students) from 33 different countries sat spellbound last
month as Jim spoke to them in the Rastall Center
Auditorium of Colorado College.
Spellbound
He always holds them spellbound — whether it is a
bunch of college freshmen or an assembly of congressmen,
whether it is a convention of Baptists in Texas or a
congregation of Buddhists in Tokyo.
This is the same Jim Irwin, who, as a midshipman in
Annapolis, 25 years back, would rather accept punishment
than speak without notes. In fact he never once spoke
extempore until his trip to the moon. After his return
from the moon everything was different....
"When we blasted off, I was only thinking of the
scientific aspect of our flight. I didn't have any notion of
my spiritual voyage that would make me come back to the
earth a different person, bound for a higher flight."
Celebrity
But the astronaut who piloted the first extended
scientific mission to the moon and for the first time
successfully explored the Hadley Rille and Apenine
mountains of the moon was not left alone to pursue a
higher flight when he returned to earth. He becomes a
world celebrity.
NASA ordered Jim Irwin and his two Apollo 15 crew
mates, Dave Scott and A 1 Worden, to travel around the
United States and the world, like previous Apollo crews,
and explain the scientific achievements of their $24 billion
trip.
For Jim, who had "felt an overwhelming sense of
presence of God on the moon," this public relations chore
about the flight's scientific achievements alone was
"thoroughly frustrating." He wanted to share his spiritual
experience with his audiences, he says.
But spiritual matters were out of bounds in
NASA-arranged meetings. So Jim says he used to sneak
out to churches whenever he could and "tell them how I
really felt after coming back from the moon."
On October 27, 1971, nearly three months after his
coming back, he spoke to a crowd of 30,000 about his
spiritual awakening at the Astrodome in Houston. That

was his first big speech. Jim recalls that he realized then
how easy it was for him to communicate with people
about an experience that has changed his entire life.
After that, word spread that astronaut Jim Irwin had a
spiritual message he was willing to share with people.
Requests for talks started pouring in from all over the
country and abroad, he remembers.
This seemed to Jim a God-given signal. He resigned
from the U.S. Air Force soon after, terminating a 21-year
association which began in 1951 when he was
commissioned upon graduation from the Naval Academy.
A day after his resignation, High Flight Foundation was
born, with Jim Irwin as its founder-president. The mission
of High Flight: "To tell all men that God is alive, not only
on the moon, but everywhere."

Jim's wife Mary — who always tells people she meets
that "astronauts are just like other human beings, with
wife and children, with the same needs, emotions, failings"
— was Jim's constant inspiration in his big decision to quit
the Air Force and organize High Flight.
So was Jim's pastor, Dr. William H. Rittenhouse, a
well-known former Baptist preacher and speaker who now
is one of Jim's co-workers in High Flight.
Jim's other companions in High Flight include Eugene
McDaniel, a former U.S. Navy Captain who spent &A years
in North Vietnamese Prisons; Gloria Roe, one of the
nation's outstanding composers, pianists and vocalists;
Andy Ferrier, a Christian composer and accordionist from
Switzerland and the Sixth Day, a young music group.
This crew, with Jim as the pilot, organizes mission
tours, retreats, radio and television specials, recordings and
publications conveying the message of Jesus Christ to
"place the highest flight within the reach of ordinary
people."
High Flight headquarters in downtown Colorado
Springs are adorned with countless trophies, souvenirs and
awards Jim earned as High Flight organizer and his
scientific career as an astronaut.

A Master of Science in Aeronautical and
Instrumentation Engineering from the Uiversity of
Michigan, Jim Irwin was ranked among the "hottest test
pilots" in the Air Force in his time, with 7015 hours of
flying time (5300 hours of which were in jet aircrafts).
Jim, a 44-year old father of five children — the last is
Joe Chau, an adopted Vietnamese orphan — smiles his
gentle, contagious smile everytime he has to answer the
oft-repeated question: "Is he making more money now
through High Flight?"
"I had to put in all my savings to start this non-profit
organization. Even then, I had to take help from my
parents and friends. Now I have been sustaining it by
putting in my honorariums I earn from my talks. I have
been putting in all my time, day and night, to keep High
Flight going."
Jim's ceaseless day and night work for High Flight
seems to have taken its toll on his health. He suffered a
heart attack last year.
'Surprised By God'
"I was surprised by God. I couldn't imagine that I, Jim
Irwin, would have a heart attack," he writes in the
epilogue of his book To Rule The Night, an account of his
flight to the moon published last year.
He felt the same "how could this happen to me"
bewilderment when his plane crashed while he was
instructing students at the Edwards Air Base in 1961. He
had two broken legs, broken jaw, a concussion and
lacerations. It seemed that his flying career had come to an
abrupt end.
He has dreamed about going to the moon since his
childhood days in Pittsburgh, Pa., his birthplace. His
mother recounts that one day little Jim pointed up to the
moon and said, "I'm going up there some day."
But after his near-fatal plane crash and two rejections
that dream seemed very far away. So when Jim was
selected as an astronaut in the final group and later as a
crew member of Apollo 15, he ascribed it all to God's will
and destiny.
Destiny
Destiny, he reflects, brought his heart attack too. "I
believe the Lord sustained me to a certain point. Then He
decided I had to get rest "
Jim invites other astronauts to join High Flight, if they
have a spiritual message. Most astronauts go through
spiritual experiences after their space trips, he says, though
they may express themselves differently.
"There are some exceptions, though," he explained.
Owen Garriot, the Stanford electrical engineering
professor who went on Skylab, for instance, has always
been an atheist. He has continued to remain one after his
space trip.
Jim, on the other hand, says he was always a believer.
That's why he knows he saw God on the moon.
