### 
The U.S. Postal Service began constructing about 2000
additional post office boxes yesterday on the south side of
the Stanford branch building.
Construction should be finished by August 1, according
to Dan De Young, Plant Services director.
The boxes will be arranged in a rectangular,
self-contained unit with boxes on three sides and a door
on the fourth side.
