# Zimbardo Finishes Prison Testimony
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Psychology Prof. Philip G.
Zinbardo concluded his testimony
Wednesday on behalf of six San
Quentin inmates, saying he
thought the prisoners are ready to
be phased out of the prison and
back into society.
Zimbardo was an "expert"
witness for the plaintiffs who are
asking U.S. District Court Judge
Alfonso J. Zirpoli to shut down
the prison's maximum adjustment
center, used for solitary
confinement, on the grounds that
it is cruel and unusual
punishment.
Following Zimbardo's
testimony, the plaintiffs rested
their case and the judge recessed
the court until Tuesday, at which
time the State will begin its
defense.
Nationally known for his mock
prison experiment on campus
three summers ago, Zimbardo had
previously testified that the
human and constitutional rights
of the plaintiffs "are being denied,
distorted, and degraded" by the
conditions of the adjustment
center.
Prison Visits
He based his testimony on two
visits to the prison, in which he
extensively interviewed the six
inmates: Johnny Spain, Hugo
Pinell, Luis Talamantez, Willie
Tate, Fleeta Drumgo and David

Johnson.
Questioned by attorney Fred
Hiestand, Zimbardo said, "The
longer they [the six plaintiffs] are
kept in the adjustment center the
more difficult it will be for them
to make the transition back into
free society."
In a 29-page statement he had
presented to the court Monday,
Zimbardo contended that the
adjustment center's social
atmosphere "could hardly be less
conducive to the fulfillment" of
"societal imperatives" such as
"tolerance, some compassion,
empathy, roletaking abilities,
interpersonal trust, reciprocity,
and cooperation."
Not 'Extreme'
In Wednesday's
cross-examination by deputy
Attorney General Sanford
Svetcov, Zimbardo conceded that
he did not consider himself a
prison expert and that he had
only been in three prisons in his
life. He also said that confinement
in San Quentin's adjustment
center did not constitute "an
extreme form of solitary
confinement."
Svetcov said that he expected
the defense to last a week,
presenting six or seven witnesses,
possibly including San Quentin
warden Ken Britt and Department
of Corrections Director Raymond
Procunier.

of Corrections Director Raymond
Procunier.
