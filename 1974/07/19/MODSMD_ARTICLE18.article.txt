Judiciary Panel Releases Evidence
WASHINGTON — Evidence released by the House
Judiciary Committee yesterday quoted ex-Presidential aide
John Ehrlichman as saying President Nixon approved of
the break-in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist
after the operation.
Ehrlichman's statement, made on April 26, is the first
documentary evidence saying Nixon sanctioned the
break-in. The White House had no comment on the
disclosure, which was made in one of five volumes of
evidence released by the panel yesterday.
In hearings yesterday, the committee heard White
House lawyer James St. Clair conclude his defense of the
President.
St. Clair angered many members of the panel
„ investigating the impeachment of Nixon by releasing a
transcript of a taped conversation which the committee
had been unable to obtain.
St. Clair said the conversation, which took place on
March 22 between Nixon and ex-Chief of Staff H.R.
Haldeman, proved Nixon did not authorize hush money to
Watergate defendants.
Rep. Peter Rodino, D—N.J., the chairman of the panel,
said he could find no rational basis for what Nixon has and
has not produced for the committee.
Another member of the committee, Robert McClory,
R—lll., said that it was certain the committee would vote
for impeachment. He told the Washington Star-News that
he thought four or five of the 17 Republicans on the
committee would vote for impeachment.
Cyprus Conflict Continues
ATHENS — Both Greece and Turkey continued their
troop build-ups yesterday, as U.S. Undersecretary of State
Joseph Sisco prepared to fly to the Mediterranean in an
Kissinger-like effort to prevent war over Cyprus.
Yesterday, Greece, pressured by North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), agreed to recall and replace the 650
Greek army officers who led the coup that toppled the
government of Archibishop Makarios and brought
pro-Greek forces into power.
But Turkey said that recall and replacement would not
be enough to assuage its demands. The Turks want total
withdrawal of Greek forces from Cyprus and are backing

their threat by amassing troops on their southern coast,
only 50 miles from Cyprus.
The Greeks seek merger of Cyprus with Greece, but any
annexation attempt would almost certainly provoke war
with Turkey. The Greeks have put troops on the Turkish
border on alert.
About four-fifths of Cyprus' 500,000 inhabitants are
Greek, the rest, Turkish.
Sisco is expected to fly to Ankara, Turkey, today after
meeting with Greek leaders in Athens this morning.
Makarios is expected to ask the U.N. Security Council
to intervene in Cyprus when he addresses the Council
today in New York.
Nation's Economy Fails To Grow
WASHINGTON — The quarterly report on the nation's
economy, issued yesterday, indicated that the economy
has failed to grow for six consecutive months for the first
time since the 1969-70 recession.
The administration had predicted an upswing in the
economy after the passing of the energy crisis, which
caused a seven percent drop in growth for the first three
months of this year. But instead, the growth rate dropped
by another 1.3 percent.
President Nixon was attacked in both houses of
Congress yesterday. House Speaker Carl Albert, in an
hour-long speech, said the President "has neither
administered nor led."
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D—Mass., called Nixon's
economic management "totally inept."
Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department reported
yesterday that supplies of prime and choice beef would
diminish during the months ahead because of cutbacks
caused by lower prices. Total supplies of beef, however,
will stay above the levels of last year.
Unions Plan Strike Against AT&T
WASHINGTON — Unions representing some 750,000
telephone system employees have announced they will
seek strike votes against American Telephone and
Telegraph, and expressed confidence they would win these
votes.
Negotiators for several unions, including the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and

Communication Workers of America, rejected an AT&T
offer.
The votes will be completed by July 30. If there is a
strike, telephone service would not immediately be shut
down, although CWA President Glen Watts said service
would deteriorate within a few weeks.
Dizzy Dean's Funeral To Be Held
RENO — Funeral services will be held tomorrow for
legendary pitcher Dizzy Dean in his home town of
Wiggins, Mississippi.
Dean died Wednesday in a Reno hospital after a heart
attack suffered Sunday night. The hall-of-famer dazzled
batters in the early 30's with his fastball, and led the
colorful exploits of the "Gashouse Gang" of the St. Louis
Cardinals.
Later, Dean became well-known as an announcer and
after-dinner speaker.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except for patchy low clouds
mornings. Highs today and tomorrow in the upper 70s to
lower 80s, low tonight in the mid 50s. West winds 10-15
miles per hour in the afternoon.
