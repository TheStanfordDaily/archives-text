# New Row Houses Likely
## Horton Unveils Building Plan 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
"There is every reason to
believe that we'll be building three
new Row houses, probably on the
Lasuen site," Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton
disclosed yesterday.
Horton said that the objective
is for each house to accommodate
50 students and, assuming
approval, be ready for occupancy
in September, 1976.
Horton was reluctant to say
that approval is certain, but noted
that the housing office is
proceeding as if it were ready to
build. The proposal must go
through several review stages and
receive final approval from the
University's Board of Trustees
before being implemented.
The proposal is part of a
soon-to-be-released report
authored by Horton, Executive
Asst. to Provost Edward E. Shaw
and Director of University
Housing Edward A. Scoles. The
three attempted to "construct a
case for [housing] demand"
according to Horton.
The report cites a need for new
housing to accomodate 850
persons, approximately the
number who were left unassigned
after the second round of this
year's housing draw, Horton said.
As many as 700 places could
be provided by a new large
complex, possibly a dormitory
next to Lagunita Hall, Horton
said. He indicated, however, that
it is too early to tell if such a
complex is feasible.
The housing office is soliciting

student input into the plans for
the new Row houses. Yesterday, a
meeting was held with various
housing office personnel and
interested students to discuss
what students would like a Row
house to be.
Such issues as completely
independent houses, desirable
kitchen facilities, designing of
student rooms, and space needs
for various activities were
discussed. Horton said that more
of these meetings would'be held.
One reason the housing office
needs to solicit such information
is that the University has never
constructed an undergraduate
residence with co-education in
mind. Its most recent addition,
the Mirrilees Apartment complex,
was not designed with any one

housing purpose in consideration.
Florence Moore Hall, built in
1956, was designed as an
all-female dormitory and the
Cowell cluster houses were built
as fraternities.
Horton said the new houses'
architecture should blend in with
the Row, although they didn't
necessarily have to be historical
reproductions. The proposed site
is on Lasuen Avenue, between
Campus Drive and Granada Street,
across from the Beta House.
Horton said he does not
anticipate any opposition to the
proposal, such as the student
protests over the faculty emeriti
housing project. He cited housing
draw statistics which show that
students prefer small independent
houses to dormitory living.

the Row, although they didn't
necessarily have to be historical
reproductions. The proposed site
is on Lasuen Avenue, between
Campus Drive and Granada Street,
across from the Beta House.
Horton said he does not
anticipate any opposition to the
proposal, such as the student
protests over the faculty emeriti
housing project. He cited housing
draw statistics which show that
students prefer small independent
houses to dormitory living.
"There is every reason to
believe that we'll be building three
new Row houses, probably on the
Lasuen site," Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton
disclosed yesterday.
Horton said that the objective
is for each house to accommodate
50 students and, assuming
approval, be ready for occupancy
in September, 1976.
Horton was reluctant to say
that approval is certain, but noted
that the housing office is
proceeding as if it were ready to
build. The proposal must go
through several review stages and
receive final approval from the
University's Board of Trustees
before being implemented.
The proposal is part of a
soon-to-be-released report
authored by Horton, Executive
Asst. to Provost Edward E. Shaw
and Director of University
Housing Edward A. Scoles. The
three attempted to "construct a
case for [housing] demand"
according to Horton.
The report cites a need for new
housing to accomodate 850
persons, approximately the
number who were left unassigned
after the second round of this
year's housing draw, Horton said.
As many as 700 places could
be provided by a new large
complex, possibly a dormitory
next to Lagunita Hall, Horton
said. He indicated, however, that
it is too early to tell if such a
complex is feasible.
The housing office is soliciting

student input into the plans for
the new Row houses. Yesterday, a
meeting was held with various
housing office personnel and
interested students to discuss
what students would like a Row
house to be.
Such issues as completely
independent houses, desirable
kitchen facilities, designing of
student rooms, and space needs
for various activities were
discussed. Horton said that more
of these meetings would'be held.
One reason the housing office
needs to solicit such information
is that the University has never
constructed an undergraduate
residence with co-education in
mind. Its most recent addition,
the Mirrilees Apartment complex,
was not designed with any one

housing purpose in consideration.
Florence Moore Hall, built in
1956, was designed as an
all-female dormitory and the
Cowell cluster houses were built
as fraternities.
Horton said the new houses'
architecture should blend in with
the Row, although they didn't
necessarily have to be historical
reproductions. The proposed site
is on Lasuen Avenue, between
Campus Drive and Granada Street,
across from the Beta House.
