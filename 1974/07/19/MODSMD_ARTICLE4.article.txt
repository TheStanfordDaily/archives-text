# Scientists Ask DNA Test Ban
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
A committee of prominent
American scientists headed by
Biochemistry Prof. Paul Berg
appealed to biological researchers
yesterday to delay
experimentation on hybrid DNA
molecules that could accidentally
infect higher organisms and
endanger the population.
Berg, Assoc. Medicine Prof.
Stanley Cohen, Asst.
Biochemistry Prof. Ronald Davis,
Biochemistry Prof. David Hogness
and seven others appointed by the
National Academy of Sciences
issued a statement yesterday in
Washington, D.C. asking for a
temporary moratorium on the use
of techniques which permit the
fusing of animal and bacterial
genetic material.
These techniques have vast
potential benefit in cancer
research and to those studying
regulation of genes in higher
organisms, the committee
reported.

But because these techniques
have been developed only
recently, researchers are unaware
of the hybrids' effects if released
in the environment, according to
the group.
'Biologically Hazardous'
"There is serious concern that
some of these artificial
recombinant DNA molecules
could prove biologically
hazardous," Berg said.
In the committee's words,
"Our concern for the possible
unfortunate indiscriminate
application of these techniques
motivates us to urge all scientists
working in this area to join us in
agreeing not to initiate certain
types of experiments until some
resolution of the outstanding
questions has been achieved."
Along with the moratorium on
hybrid DNA tests, the group
proposed a delay on experiments
which produce antibiotic
drug-resistant bacterial strains and
those which involve DNA
introduction from animal tumor
viruses into bacterial cells.
Berg's committee also asked
the National Institute of Health to
establish an advisory group of
scientists to evaluate the potential
hazards of this research, to
develop criteria for research and
to invent control mechanisms to
limit the spread of dangerous
organisms, if they are produced.
E. Coli
The group focused on the
danger in introducing animal cell
DNA into bacterial cells that
could infect humans. A common
example is the organisms E. coli
which normally lives in the human
intestine.
But Hogness added the
proposed moratorium would be
voluntary among scientists and
the committee's proposals were
designed, in large part, to make
researchers aware of the potential
dangers, not to regulate research.
"All the people I know
working in this area are aware of
the dangers" and have taken the proper precautions," he
said. Hogness expressed particular concern about "the
so-called 'Saturday morning clinicians'" and science
classes which might undertake this research carelessly.
"We want to start being cautious before this explodes,"
he said.
Davis added that because the experiments themselves
are "easy," research in this area has expanded greatly
without proper consideration of the dangers.
"In the past the dangers were ignored, but they proved
to be harmless," Davis said.
He cited polio virus research as an example of a field in
which the potential "biohazards" were ignored, but
explained that exposure to polio virus in the environment
was common.

American scientists headed by
Biochemistry Prof. Paul Berg
appealed to biological researchers
yesterday to delay
experimentation on hybrid DNA
molecules that could accidentally
infect higher organisms and
endanger the population.
Berg, Assoc. Medicine Prof.
Stanley Cohen, Asst.
Biochemistry Prof. Ronald Davis,
Biochemistry Prof. David Hogness
and seven others appointed by the
National Academy of Sciences
issued a statement yesterday in
Washington, D.C. asking for a
temporary moratorium on the use
of techniques which permit the
fusing of animal and bacterial
genetic material.
These techniques have vast
potential benefit in cancer
research and to those studying
regulation of genes in higher
organisms, the committee
reported.

But because these techniques
have been developed only
recently, researchers are unaware
of the hybrids' effects if released
in the environment, according to
the group.
'Biologically Hazardous'
"There is serious concern that
some of these artificial
recombinant DNA molecules
could prove biologically
hazardous," Berg said.
In the committee's words,
"Our concern for the possible
unfortunate indiscriminate
application of these techniques
motivates us to urge all scientists
working in this area to join us in
agreeing not to initiate certain
types of experiments until some
resolution of the outstanding
questions has been achieved."
Along with the moratorium on
hybrid DNA tests, the group
proposed a delay on experiments
which produce antibiotic
drug-resistant bacterial strains and
those which involve DNA
introduction from animal tumor
viruses into bacterial cells.
Berg's committee also asked
the National Institute of Health to
establish an advisory group of
scientists to evaluate the potential
hazards of this research, to
develop criteria for research and
to invent control mechanisms to
limit the spread of dangerous
organisms, if they are produced.
E. Coli
The group focused on the
danger in introducing animal cell
DNA into bacterial cells that
could infect humans. A common
example is the organisms E. coli
which normally lives in the human
intestine.
But Hogness added the
proposed moratorium would be
voluntary among scientists and
the committee's proposals were
designed, in large part, to make
researchers aware of the potential
dangers, not to regulate research.
"All the people I know
working in this area are aware of
the dangers" and have taken the proper precautions," he
said. Hogness expressed particular concern about "the
so-called 'Saturday morning clinicians'" and science
classes which might undertake this research carelessly.
"We want to start being cautious before this explodes,"
he said.
Davis added that because the experiments themselves
are "easy," research in this area has expanded greatly
without proper consideration of the dangers.
"In the past the dangers were ignored, but they proved
to be harmless," Davis said.
He cited polio virus research as an example of a field in
which the potential "biohazards" were ignored, but
explained that exposure to polio virus in the environment
was common.
