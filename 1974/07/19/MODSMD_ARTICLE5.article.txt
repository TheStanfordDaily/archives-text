# TMU Cafeteria Future In Doubt
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Continued financial and operational problems
have raised "serious doubt" that the present
cafeteria service can be maintained at Tresidder
Memorial Union, Bob Caselli, food services
director of TDS, Inc., which runs the cafeteria
and coffee house, said yesterday.
Caselli said that TDS officials will begin
discussions of the cafeteria's future with
employees, University officials and other
interested parties shortly. TDS is seriously
considering "changing to a restricted, fast service
format," he said.
In a letter to United Stanford Employees
(USE) attorneys, TDS officials said that the
proposed change might take effect on August 17.

An election to determine whether or not USE
will represent TDS workers is scheduled for the
first week in August. Susan Frey, a legal worker
at the Law Commune which represents USE, said
that TDS might ask the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) to delay the election because of
the proposed change in format.
firey also said that the union was concerned
about layoffs which might be caused by a change
to a fast-food format.
TDS took over the operations of Tresidder
food service operations, which also include the
Encina Snack Bar and a catering service, in June
1973.
Previously, the cafeteria was run by the
University, which lost $240,000 in 1972-73
alone.
