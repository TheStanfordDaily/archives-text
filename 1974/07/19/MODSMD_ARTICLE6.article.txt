# Two Mistakes

In the article on
"SLAâ€”Venceremos links" there is
a statement that "it is a political
waste of time to deny there are
links between the SLA and
Venceremos." I would like to
clarify that. It is unimportant to
deny or confirm links between the
SLA and any groups. What is
important is for revolutionaries to
deal with the SLA's mistakes from
a political point of view.
There are two kinds of
mistakes revolutionaries have
made in every movement. Since
whole revolutions have failed
because of these mistakes, it is
important to understand them
and how they're connected to the
SLA.
These mistakes develop in the
following way:
"The revolutionary process
begins with a spontaneous
rebellion (like the black uprisings
of the '60s). This upheaval
changes the existence of
everybody in society. It awakens
the first conscious thoughts of
actual revolution. It creates
conscious revolutionaries. People
become aware of the need for a
revolutionary strategy and a
revolutionary organization. These
begin to form.
"But the spontaneous
movement, because it has no clear
strategy and organization, is
doomed to fail. The repression
strikes. The people sense that they
do not yet have what it takes to
win. They seem to sink back into
the apathy they had before their
rebellion. But this is only a
surface calm. Beneath it, the
thoughts of revolution are
widening and deepening.
Reformism
"When [faced with this
apathy] revolutionaries give up on
the people and surrender to
defeatism, two lines emerge. One
abandons all the revolutionary
programs and commits itself to
doing only legal work (this
mistake is called "reformism").
The other seeks to make the
revolution all by itself, abandons
all open work and goes
underground and carries out small
military actions. This is the
mistake the SLA has made. It is
called "adventurism."
Although both mistakes are
serious, adventurist mistakes are
self-limiting. A guerrilla group
connected with a mass movement
depends on the people for
supplies, intelligence,
communications and cover. If a
guerilla group is adventurist and
not linked with a mass movement
it cannot get these things.

Without good cover, it cannot
grow to a large size without being
smashed, or infiltrated and even
used by agents provocateurs.
Without good security, it is forced
from offensive to mostly
defensive actions, and going on
the defensive has proven deadly
for guerrilla groups. With these
odds, there are few people
committed enough to join them.
Reformism, though, is the
opposite. Although history has
shown that every ruling class has
used violence to protect its power
and wealth, people desperately
want to believe we can get
revoutionary change through
peaceful reform, without illegal or
military actions. This view is a
greater threat than adventurism
because it is the easy way out, and
that gives it broad appeal.
Unrealistic View
You don't have to be a
revolutionary to know that view is
unrealistic. At Wounded Knee, for
example, 150 people were
surrounded by 50 armored
personnel carriers and raked with
machine-gun fire at night. In
Denver last year a Chicano group
was bombed, one of its leaders
shot by the police, and, two
months ago, six other members
killed. In Harlan, Kentucky last
month striking miners were shot
at and beat up.
Any revolutionary group which
cannot protect people, which
cannot help people to organize to
defend themselves in these
situations, which cannot help
people in a practical way in
whatever form of struggle the
people see necessary at that time
and place, that organization isn't
worth beans. That group, in fact,
is dangerous.
While our main job is political,
revolutionary groups must be
ready to use every form of
struggle: legal, illegal,
aboveground, and underground.
Any group which uses only
military tactics is suicidal and
adventurist. At the same time any
group which doesn't seriously
prepare itself to use military
tactics is suicidal and reformist.
There is a growing feeling
around the country that our main
job is to pull together, out of the
hundreds of scattered groups and
collectives, a core group. A
revolutionary party with a unified
socialist program must be built
around this core. This is being
done. Once this party develops it,
in turn, must develop a military
apparatus.
