# TV Violence Controversy

According to the Los Angeles Times of July 10,
University of Maryland psychologist Dalmas Taylor
has just published a new study on the effects of
television violence. He states that television, often
held responsible for violence in American life,
actually reduces aggression.
He maintains that for some people television
violence diminishes hostile attitudes which precede
aggression. His findings are another addition to the
ongoing controversy over the effects of television
violence on viewers.
Stanford psychiatry Prof. Alberta Siegel has
expressed an opposing view. In her testimony
before a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate
Commerce Committee in 1972, she said: "There is
now evidence for a causal link between watching
TV violence and subsequent aggressive behavior by
the viewer."
The effect of television violence on viewers was
the subject of a $1 million study sponsored by the
U.S. Surgeon General in 1972. The conclusions
reached by the study group do not support Prof.
Siegel's position.
'School For Violence'
According to Prof. Siegel, "Commercial
television is school for violence." Children view
countless murders, the message of which is that
violence is a way of problem-solving.
Although she believes television watching is not
the principal cause of violent behavior by
adolescents and adults, "it makes its own
contributions to the set of factors that underlie
aggressive behavior in our society."
'Inconclusive'
However, the Surgeon General's report, a
279-page document on 25 different studies and
experiments, concludes that "a modest relationship
exists between viewing of violence and aggressive
behavior — but it is not wholly consistent or
conclusive."
The committee of 12 different social scientists
had five basic reservations about the alleged "causal
relationship" claimed by Siegel:
—The variations in human character made it
difficult to predict effects of any one stimulus, let
alone the tremendous onslaught of stimuli from
television.
—Each viewer has his own set of values with
which he judges what he sees on television.
—An individual's social environment influences
television impact.
—"It is difficult to design studies which isolate
the effects of television content from these other
variables."
—"There is a problem in moving from findings
of social scientific research to policy proposals for
everyday life."

Television critic Edith Efron attacked both
groups of psychologists in a three-part article in TV
Guide (November 1972), entitled "A Million-Dollar
Misunderstanding." She pointed out the
psychologists' lack of precision in defining the
words "aggression" and "violence."
For example, she says, "violence in these studies
means such disparate things as ... physically
hurting or killing people or destroying their
property; defending yourself when being hurt or
killed, or defending others from such attack;
racially stereotyping blacks; playing football.
Efron summarized what she called the
contradicitions of the various research findings:
"Some [subjects] become 'aggressive' after
seeing TV violence.
"The majority do not.
"Some [subjects] become more cooperative and
'prosocial' afterwards.
"Some [subjects] become more 'aggressive' after
watching comedies and erotic material.
"Some [subjects] become more 'aggressive' after
watching erotic material than after watching
'violent' material."
Suggestions
Despite the committee's reservations about the
findings and Efron's critique of the entire
psychological undertaking Siegel has five
suggestions for regulating the level of violence on
television:
—An independent monitoring agency to
regularly report the level of violence on television;
—Consumer refusal to buy products or stocks of
television-supporting firms;
—Increased support for public television;
—Travel fellowships to writers and producers of
children's television programs."
—Appointment of a child advocate to the staff
of the Federal Communications Commission, the
federal government's regulatory body overseeing
the broadcasting industry.
It is here in Siegel's recommendation that a
regulator of her persuasion be appointed to the
F.C.C. that the political dimension of the
controversy comes into play. Because Siegel sees a
causal link between violence on the screen and
violence in society, she proposes additional
government control of television.
Social psychologists who question Siegel's
findings, and defenders of civil liberties alike,
challenge the proposal. The civil libertarians oppose
Siegel's regulation on the ground that it directly
threatens the First Amendment, which states that
Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of
speech and freedom of the press.
