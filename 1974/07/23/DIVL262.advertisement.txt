Preview Magazines Publicize Stanford
5 College Football preview magazines distributed at the •
I Tresidder store have given Stanford a lot of publicity — but :
5 haven't been quite so nice with their predictions.
S Football Roundup, featured Stanford All-Americans Pat i
• Donovan and Roger Stillwell on the cover, along with pom-pon •
| dolly Linda Jenks. Despite the photo, set up by ex-Stanford s
| sports information director Bob Murphy, the magazine picked *
! Stanford for fourth in the conference behind USC, UCLA, and |
I surprise-choice Oregon.
s The magazine, which said it puts Jenks on the cover because of \
I "this era of women's liberation," sold out within two days here. |
Two other magazines now on sale — Sports Stars and Kickoff :
1 — pick Stanford third in the Pac-8 and 20th and 16th in the 5
| nation, respectively.
i Palo Alto Times sports writer Dick O'Connor wrote the |
| Kickoff predictions. Sports Stars, meanwhile, features a |
S full-length article on ABC's Andy Sidaris' picks of the top schools |
| for pretty girls, and a brief description of Murphy's antics in the I
I infamous "honey shot" affair.
