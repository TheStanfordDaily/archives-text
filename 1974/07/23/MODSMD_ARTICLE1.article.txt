# Gibbs Appoints Supton As New SCIRE Director
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Alice L. Supton, Urban Studies
administrative assistant, is the new
director of the Student Center for
Innovation and Research in
Education (SCIRE).
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James L. Gibbs appointed Supton
to fill the post vacant since he
fired W. Ron Jones more than a
year ago.
Supton will officially assume
the position Sept. 1.
She said she will focus on "the
need to generate interest in the
revitalized SCIRE program,
showing students that SCIRE is
available to them." The SCIRE
Policy Board reorganized the
program last year.
She said she wanted students
to realize SCIRE is a "center for
activity." She added that in the

fall SCIRE will be more like a
"clearing house" for students.
Academic Credit
SCIRE will continue to
accredit and evaluate individual
and group courses for academic
credit.
Task forces are one new aspect
of the fall program. These are
"small groups of students and
faculty who get together to work
on specific undergraduate
problems," B. Michael Closson,
assistant dean of undergraduate
studies explained.
One area a task force might
study is the advising system,
Supton suggested.
SCIRE will also specify a
work-study program for students
who want to get involved with
off-campus activities. The
program may be coordinated with

the ASSU's Action Research
Liaison Office (ARLO) which
finds students research
opportunities in the community,
Supton said.
Innovation Fund
A third aspect of the revamped
program is a $4000 innovation
fund. This money will support
students who need financial aid
for innovative projects they
propose.
The Provost office and the
Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies (ODUS)
are supplying the fund as part of
SCIRE's $25,000 budget.
Another one of Supton's
proposals is consolidating files of
research on campus programs.
Students could use SCIRE as a
research library, Supton
remarked.
"The development of
alternative courses in departments
through scheduling or finding
places in the community.. .. It's
that kind of thing SCIRE could
do more of," she said.
Exciting Ideas
Closson said Gibbs chose
Supton from the 65 applicants
because "she had the most
exciting ideas about what the
program could be."
Closson denied that Supton's
affiliation with Urban Studies
implied any kind of eventual
merging of Urban Studies and
SCIRE.
"I don't see that [the merging]
