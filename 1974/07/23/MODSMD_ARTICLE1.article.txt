# Gibbs Appoints Supton As New SCIRE Director
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Alice L. Supton, Urban Studies
administrative assistant, is the new
director of the Student Center for
Innovation and Research in
Education (SCIRE).
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James L. Gibbs appointed Supton
to fill the post vacant since he
fired W. Ron Jones more than a
year ago.
Supton will officially assume
the position Sept. 1.
She said she will focus on "the
need to generate interest in the
revitalized SCIRE program,
showing students that SCIRE is
available to them." The SCIRE
Policy Board reorganized the
program last year.
She said she wanted students
to realize SCIRE is a "center for
activity." She added that in the

fall SCIRE will be more like a
"clearing house" for students.
Academic Credit
SCIRE will continue to
accredit and evaluate individual
and group courses for academic
credit.
Task forces are one new aspect
of the fall program. These are
"small groups of students and
faculty who get together to work
on specific undergraduate
problems," B. Michael Closson,
assistant dean of undergraduate
studies explained.
One area a task force might
study is the advising system,
Supton suggested.
SCIRE will also specify a
work-study program for students
who want to get involved with
off-campus activities. The
program may be coordinated with

the ASSU's Action Research
Liaison Office (ARLO) which
finds students research
opportunities in the community,
Supton said.
Innovation Fund
A third aspect of the revamped
program is a $4000 innovation
fund. This money will support
students who need financial aid
for innovative projects they
propose.
The Provost office and the
Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies (ODUS)
are supplying the fund as part of
SCIRE's $25,000 budget.
Another one of Supton's
proposals is consolidating files of
research on campus programs.
Students could use SCIRE as a
research library, Supton
remarked.
"The development of
alternative courses in departments
through scheduling or finding
places in the community.. .. It's
that kind of thing SCIRE could
do more of," she said.
Exciting Ideas
Closson said Gibbs chose
Supton from the 65 applicants
because "she had the most
exciting ideas about what the
program could be."
Closson denied that Supton's
affiliation with Urban Studies
implied any kind of eventual
merging of Urban Studies and
SCIRE.
"I don't see that [the merging]

SCIRE HEAD HIRED—Alice L. Supton will fill post of SCIRE
director which has been vacant since W. Ron Jones was fired more
than a year ago. She hopes to make more students interested in the
revamped program through an extensive publicity campaign.
ever happening," he said. "Urban
Studies is more of a
faculty-oriented program." Many
SCIRE course are non-accredited,
he said.
Closson said he did not foresee
any problems between the Policy
Board and ODUS next year.
Supton was not as optimistic.
"It depends on the working
relationship," she said.
Financially, SCIRE depends on
ODUS. However, SCIRE's
purpose of investigating new
methods of education may "put it
in a position to go against the
status quo."
Some of the proposals may
actually challenge ODUS, but

"that's what SCIRE is all about,"
Supton said.
Jones Conflict
SCIRE's former director and
previous Policy Boards have run
into conflicts with ODUS in the
past. Gibbs chose not to renew
Jones' contract last year and his
decision was upheld by an
independent arbitrator last
summer.
The position of director has
been vacant since Jones left last
June. After the grievance hearing.
Gibbs said he planned to name a
new director by winter or spring
quarter this year.
Closson attributed the delay in
finding a new SCIRE head to
ODUS's request for a revamping
of the entire program. Closson
said, "We proposed to the Policy
Board that we have an acting
director (during a search for a
director)."
Dana Wigent held the position
this past year.
So much time was spent
reorganizing the program that the
search for a new full-time director
didn't start until March, Closson
said.
Originally from Philadelphia,
Supton taught grammar school in
New York and came here last year
with her husband, a law student.
Besides working in Urban
Studies, she served as secretary for
the Committee of Undergraduate
Studies (CUS). Merlyn Paine will
be her assistant in the SCIRE
office.
