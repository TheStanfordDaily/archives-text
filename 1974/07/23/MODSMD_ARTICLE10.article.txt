# 'Daily' Lawyers To Get Fees
## 
### 
Attorneys for the Stanford
Daily have been awarded $47,500
in fees for their work on the
lawsuit in which the search of the
Daily office by four Palo Alto
policemen was ruled
unconstitutional. United States
District Court Judge Robert F.
Peckham handed down the ruling
last Wednesday.
The court order said the figure
was based on 750 hours of the
attorneys' time at $50 an hour
plus an increase on the basis of
the compensation's contingent
nature, the quality of the work
and the results obtained by the
litigation.
The defendants in the case
were the four officers who
searched the Daily following a riot
in 1971, Palo Alto Police Chief

James Zurcher, Santa Clara
County District Attorney Louis
Bergna, Santa Clara County
Deputy District Attorney Craig
Brown and J. Barton Phelps, the
Palo Alto Municipal Court judge
who issued the search warrant.
On August 10, 1973, the court
granted the Daily motion for an
award for "reasonable attorneys'
fees." The Daily was represented
by San Francisco lawyers Robert
H. Mnookin and Jerome B. Falk
Jr. and Law Prof. Anthony
Amsterdam. However, the 750
hours does not include time spent
on the case by Amsterdam.
