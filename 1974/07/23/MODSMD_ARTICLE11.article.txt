# Prof Discusses Politics, Press
## 
### RICHARD HUTTON 
In the midst of the Watergate
miasma, the current "gap"
between politicians and journalists
is causing an even greater gap
between journalists and the
public, Communication Prof.
William Rivers said last Thursday
night.
Addressing a near-capacity
crowd in the Tresidder Lounges,
Rivers discussed "Politics and the
Press," the third lecture of the
Seven Conversations series
sponsored by the Tresidder
Program Board.
Rivers referred to politicians
and journalists as "natural
adversaries" because their "means
of communicating are necessarily
different.
"Politicians communicate
fuzzily in a way to make it seem
that what they're doing is good
for everybody. And the journalist
knows that nothing is good for
everybody," Rivers said.
An article by Rivers to appear
in the December issue of Playboy
Magazine will attempt to explore
the recent "backlash against
journalists" based n the premise
that they are al liberals. Rivers
interviewed and submitted
questionnaires to some of the
nation's most prominent
journalists for his article's survey.
He was surprised at the

"avalanche of self-criticism"
leveled by his respondents.
Forty-nine out of 50 journalists
listed faults of the press, including
the "vulnerability of a peddling
intermediary," according to
Theodore White, and the sickness
of "herd journalism," according
to a Washington bureau chief.
The herd instinct refers to the
propensity of correspondents to
"gather around to learn what one
is doing," Rivers explained. Often
the 2200 correspondents in
Washington flock to the
Associated Press reporters or
other "opinion leaders" for the

brunt of their own stories. He
suggested reporters herd to win
their home editors' approval.
Rivers singled out James
Reston as a leader for his
excellent writing and reporting
talents but believed it "damaging
that there are so many who rely
upon Mr. Reston."
George Washington's attitude
of paying "lip service to a free
press typified the press relations
of many U.S. presidents. As
Rivers noted, "In theory they had
thought a free press was a fine
thing. In practice they don't want
any such thing."

Rivers viewed the first two
years of the Nixon presidency as a
"classic example of how the
politician can triumph over the
journalist."
Never fully understanding the
function of the free press, Nixon
appealed directly to the people
over the heads of the journalists in
limited broadcasts.
"But it is necessary for the
President to commit himself to
adversary relationships," Rivers
said, in order that the journalist
be able to carry out his
"interpretive role."

"classic example of how the
politician can triumph over the
journalist."
Never fully understanding the
function of the free press, Nixon
appealed directly to the people
over the heads of the journalists in
limited broadcasts.
"But it is necessary for the
President to commit himself to
adversary relationships," Rivers
said, in order that the journalist
be able to carry out his
"interpretive role."

In the midst of the Watergate
miasma, the current "gap"
between politicians and journalists
is causing an even greater gap
between journalists and the
public, Communication Prof.
William Rivers said last Thursday
night.
Addressing a near-capacity
crowd in the Tresidder Lounges,
Rivers discussed "Politics and the
Press," the third lecture of the
Seven Conversations series
sponsored by the Tresidder
Program Board.
Rivers referred to politicians
and journalists as "natural
adversaries" because their "means
of communicating are necessarily
different.
"Politicians communicate
fuzzily in a way to make it seem
that what they're doing is good
for everybody. And the journalist
knows that nothing is good for
everybody," Rivers said.
An article by Rivers to appear
in the December issue of Playboy
Magazine will attempt to explore
the recent "backlash against
journalists" based n the premise
that they are al liberals. Rivers
interviewed and submitted
questionnaires to some of the
nation's most prominent
journalists for his article's survey.
He was surprised at the

"avalanche of self-criticism"
leveled by his respondents.
Forty-nine out of 50 journalists
listed faults of the press, including
the "vulnerability of a peddling
intermediary," according to
Theodore White, and the sickness
of "herd journalism," according
to a Washington bureau chief.
The herd instinct refers to the
propensity of correspondents to
"gather around to learn what one
is doing," Rivers explained. Often
the 2200 correspondents in
Washington flock to the
Associated Press reporters or
other "opinion leaders" for the

brunt of their own stories. He
suggested reporters herd to win
their home editors' approval.
Rivers singled out James
Reston as a leader for his
excellent writing and reporting
talents but believed it "damaging
that there are so many who rely
upon Mr. Reston."
George Washington's attitude
of paying "lip service to a free
press typified the press relations
of many U.S. presidents. As
Rivers noted, "In theory they had
thought a free press was a fine
thing. In practice they don't want
any such thing."

Rivers viewed the first two
years of the Nixon presidency as a
"classic example of how the
politician can triumph over the
journalist."
Never fully understanding the
function of the free press, Nixon
appealed directly to the people
over the heads of the journalists in
