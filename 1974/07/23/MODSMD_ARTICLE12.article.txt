# AFS Students Arrive Intact

### BRUCE KADDEN 
Shots were apparently fired at
an airplane shortly after it left
Seoul, Korea last week. The plane
happened to be carrying 165
foreign exchange students enroute
to Stanford for the American
Field Service (AFS) International
Scholarship Program's orientation
session.
The more than 30 rounds
delivered by North Korean
antiaircraft guns did not hit the
Korean Airlines jetliner, the
Korean Defense Ministry said.
One Philippino girl described
the adventure. "We were scared,"

when advised that the shots were
only engine trouble, she said.
Some people "cried, thinking of
their parents."
All the students agreed that
they knew nothing of the
shooting until reporters
questioned them in Hawaii on a
stopover.
Arrival Delayed
The 165 students were
scheduled to arrive here last
Thursday evening, to be joined
Friday evening by 123 other
Asian students on the first leg of
their year-long visit to the United
States. But the tense extravaganza
delayed their arrival until early
Friday afternoon.
The students' charter plane
began shaking and rumbling when
the shots were fired at it about 15
minutes after leaving the Seoul
Kimpo Airport.
A Korean Defense Ministry

spokesman said the plane was
south of the Han River Estuary,
40 miles northwest of Seoul when
the incident occurred. The region
forms a western truce front
between the two Koreas.
'Keep Calm'
The pilot reportedly told the
passengers to "keep calm," and
not to panic. He said mechanical
difficulties had occurred and that
the plane would return to Seoul.
Only the five group leaders were
told what had taken place.
The 707 circled at Seoul for an
hour and a half before landing
safely. A fresh crew took the
students to Hawaii, where another
new crew took over for the flight
to California.
The students were the first
AFS group to arrive in the United
States this year. In August more
than 2000 students from Europe
and Africa will arrive in New
York, AFS President Steven
Rhinesmith said.
Later this year, there will be
"2600 AFS students from 60
countries in 2000 communities
throughout the United States," he
noted.
To complete the exchange,
"2300 Americans have gone
abroad," Rhinesmith said. As he
watched the recent arrivals mingle
with each other, he added that the
students develop "a rapport with
one another which is fairly
fascinating."
The students short time here
was spent relaxing and learning
about the AFS program. A talent
show Friday night highlighted the
stay, and gave the students a
chance to share their culture.
Saturday was departure day.
Just as most of the students had
recouperated, they were off on
buses, trains, planes or a
combination of the three for
destinations throughout the
United States.
