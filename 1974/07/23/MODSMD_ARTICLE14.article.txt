# Stanford Reacts To New Federal Laws
## 
### KAREN LACHENAUER 
Two fairly recent pieces of federal
legislation have caused a stir among Bay
Area educational institutions, but Stanford
seems to be taking them in stride.
The first, the law which nullified
President Nixon's $576,000 income tax
deduction for donation of his
vice-presidential papers, is the Tax Reform
Act of 1969.
Referred to by some legislators as "the
New Act," it prohibits public or literary
figures from claiming deductions for
donated writings larger than the cost of
supplying those writings.
The second is a Department of Health,
Education and Welfare (HEW) proposal
requiring equity for the sexes in school
facilities, teacher hiring and athletic
programs and scholarships.
Effective Next Year
Title nine of the HEW education
omnibus bill, passed in 1972, will go into
effect next year, but most Bay Area
schools feel they are already complying
with the regulations.
Hardest hit by the tax reform act are
local libraries and museums. Cheap income
tax deductions used to be a powerful
bargaining tool in securing the manuscripts,
letters and other papers these special
collectors deem invaluable.
The Bancroft Library of the University
of California Berkeley, for one, known for
its Mark Twain and Hiram Johnson
collections, has lamented about a virtual
gifts halt, at least partly attributal to the
new law.
Minimal Effect
But Earl C. Borgeson, associate director
of University libraries here, minimized the
law's effect on Stanford libraries in general.
"It does concern us, but we don't make
nearly the effort to gather archival papers
that other libraries do. At the present time,
our experience has not put us in touch
with those who give for money reasons."
Borgeson also said he believes scientists
here are motivated by scholarly, rather than
monetary, goals in bequesting to their alma
mater. In the Stanford archives, much of
the preserved work of faculty, staff and
alumni related to present research and
development.
Duty
Hoover Institute Director W. Glenn
Campbell, on the other hand, cites the

"old-fashioned" notion of duty as the
reason his institution has faced an increase,
not a decrease, in acquisitions.
Hoover has 3000 collections, or sets of
papers, dealing with 20th century world
revolution and peace. The Institute receives
between 70 and 90 new collections per
year and has several hundred under
solicitation, according to Campbell.
Most of those contributing are
prominent statesmen, diplomats, military
figures and journalists "who never really
felt they should get money for something
they created while in the public's service,"
said Campbell.
Unstemmed Donations
He also credits the Institute's
international reputation, good management
and aggressive solication program with thfe
unstemmed donations flow.
But one area of the Stanford library

system does feel the pinch: the special
collections department, housed on the
Main Library's top floor.
"Gifts are down about 25 percent," said
manuscripts librarian Patricia Palmer. "I
know of at least three good ones that have
not come in the past year because of the
law."
Rounded Picture Sought
The department deals with literary
figures' works, trying to get a rounded
picture of them by compiling all drafts,
galleys and publishing correspondence.
Last year, special collections received
about 15 gifts and made five to 10 small
purchases.
Florian Shaskey, new chief of special
collections stressed, "It's difficult for us to
gauge the law's impact because we don't
know how many papers are out there."
Shasky oversees special collections but
concentrates on books. "It's completely
different," he says. "People who give rare
books under most circumstances can
deduct the appraised amount." Books are
easier to evaluate because records exist for
the sale of other volumnes of that edition,
he adds, but only one set of personal
papers exist.
'Suspicious' Appraisals
The "suspicious" appraisals made on
some sets of papers were probably a major
reason for the law, Palmer said. In recent
years, some deductions were questioned as
seeming "a bit high," she explained.
Palmer's main concern is that papers
which would have gone to libraries are
being divided on the market and sold
piecemeal to autograph collectors.
She added that she would like to see the
law omit literary people as an inducement
to keep their writings intact. "But even if
the law does change," she said, "it will still
be another 20 to 50 years before
collections can be put together again,"
with pieces filtering in as private buyers
will them to libraries and schools.
Other Response Mixed
The response to the more-recent HEW
ruling on collegiate athletics has been

mixed, also.
However, most athletic departments,
including Stanford's have had time to work
out ways to comply to some of the law's
requirements. For instance, all but two
physical education classes here are coed.
And the exceptions, self-defense for
women and dance for men, can be
justified, officials maintain.
Joe Ruetz, director of physical
education and athletics, said he believes
that "every school will be affected" —
perhaps severely — once the bill becomes
law officially.
Athletic Scholarships
Ruetz worries most about athletic
scholarships. "The requirement that a gift
have no sex preference attached may affect
University-donor relations," he said.
The law does not require matching sport
by sport or scholarship by scholarship but
it does require affirmative action to arrive
at a reasonable equity, Ruetz said.
People who "traditionally" prefer to
specify moneys by sex may stop giving,"
Ruetz said, adding that he feels such
conventions will eventually break down.
Two Choices
In any case, the University will have two
choices, he said: funneling scholarship
dollars away from men's activities into the
women's arena or starting a drive for more
sports funds overall.
"The traumas will probably be more
severe for the men," said Ruetz.
One of the possible unpleasant
by-products may be that the "law will
force a reassessment of the need factor of
the men's side that could ruin the
program," according to Ruetz.
"Due to Stanford's high tuition, if we
go to a strict need formula, we could
conceivably end up with only the very
poor and wealthy on our teams and no
range," he said.
Besides which, football players who
have to report for practice August 15 lose a
month of summer earning to help pay their
ways, he said.
Recruiting A Problem?
There have been no scholarships for
women in the past because according to
Women's Physical Education Chairman
Pamela Strathairn, the process of choosing
recipients involves recruiting and
"recruiting has been identified as a prime
problem in all intercollegiate athletics. On
the advice of the men, women stayed away
from it in the past."
But last year the Association for
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, an
organization similar to the men's NCAA,
felt HEW pressure and altered policy,
explained Administrative Coordinator
Ruth Kaiser. The AIAW deleted the clause
forbidding women holding athletic
scholarships from competing in
intercollegiate games.
The task remains for Stanford and
affected schools — those that award
athletic monies to men — of deciding upon
the machinery and criteria for women's
grant allocation, according to Strathairn.
'Pre-Th inking'
"We'd been doing a lot of pre-thinking,
looking for ways to improve and working
together sporadically," she said, "so we
were ready to make the change, from May
to September, 1972."
Men's and women's staffs began
working immediately and courses were
handled by either, depending on
qualifications and schedules, she added.
One aspect that was not readily soluble,
however, involved equivalent locker
facilities for both men and women. On the
east end of campus, women's showers and
dressing rooms are now available in Encina
Hall, but a small building may have to be
constructed behind the men's gym.
Women On Men's Teams
Women are not discouraged from going
out for men's non-contact sports, Ruetz
said. Two women, Diane Campbell and Jo
Ward, were on the varsity diving team.
"But the skill level effectively precludes
most women's participation," he said. "So
we really have to build up the women's

program."
He pointed to high school figures as a
gauge in deciding which activities to boost.
Last year, 20 high school women played on
football teams, as opposed to a million
men.
Women turned out in a two to seven
ratio versus men in basketball and a one to

two proportion in tennis and swimming. In
wrestling, there were 280,000 men, five
women, but females slightly out-numbered
men in gymnastics 35,000 to 32,000.
"We will have to focus down on
full-blown, intercollegiate games," Ruetz
continued. At present, women have six
varsity teams: field hocky, swimming,
fencing, basketball, golf and tennis.
"There will be no merging of teams as
long as sufficient numbers of women are
available and there are women's
intercollegiate conferences," said
Strathairn.
"Generally, we can accomodate here
pretty well," said Ruetz. "I'm for the law.
It's a positive step that will be beneficial in
the long run."

easier to evaluate because records exist for
the sale of other volumnes of that edition,
he adds, but only one set of personal
papers exist.
'Suspicious' Appraisals
The "suspicious" appraisals made on
some sets of papers were probably a major
reason for the law, Palmer said. In recent
years, some deductions were questioned as
seeming "a bit high," she explained.
Palmer's main concern is that papers
which would have gone to libraries are
being divided on the market and sold
piecemeal to autograph collectors.
She added that she would like to see the
law omit literary people as an inducement
to keep their writings intact. "But even if
the law does change," she said, "it will still
be another 20 to 50 years before
collections can be put together again,"
with pieces filtering in as private buyers
will them to libraries and schools.
Other Response Mixed
The response to the more-recent HEW
ruling on collegiate athletics has been

mixed, also.
However, most athletic departments,
including Stanford's have had time to work
out ways to comply to some of the law's
requirements. For instance, all but two
physical education classes here are coed.
And the exceptions, self-defense for
women and dance for men, can be
justified, officials maintain.
Joe Ruetz, director of physical
education and athletics, said he believes
that "every school will be affected" —
perhaps severely — once the bill becomes
law officially.
Athletic Scholarships
Ruetz worries most about athletic
scholarships. "The requirement that a gift
have no sex preference attached may affect
University-donor relations," he said.
The law does not require matching sport
by sport or scholarship by scholarship but
it does require affirmative action to arrive
at a reasonable equity, Ruetz said.
People who "traditionally" prefer to
specify moneys by sex may stop giving,"
Ruetz said, adding that he feels such
conventions will eventually break down.
Two Choices
In any case, the University will have two
choices, he said: funneling scholarship
dollars away from men's activities into the
women's arena or starting a drive for more
sports funds overall.
"The traumas will probably be more
severe for the men," said Ruetz.
One of the possible unpleasant
by-products may be that the "law will
force a reassessment of the need factor of
the men's side that could ruin the
program," according to Ruetz.
"Due to Stanford's high tuition, if we
go to a strict need formula, we could
conceivably end up with only the very
poor and wealthy on our teams and no
range," he said.
Besides which, football players who
have to report for practice August 15 lose a
month of summer earning to help pay their
ways, he said.
Recruiting A Problem?
There have been no scholarships for
women in the past because according to
Women's Physical Education Chairman
Pamela Strathairn, the process of choosing
recipients involves recruiting and
"recruiting has been identified as a prime
problem in all intercollegiate athletics. On
the advice of the men, women stayed away
from it in the past."
But last year the Association for
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, an
organization similar to the men's NCAA,
felt HEW pressure and altered policy,
explained Administrative Coordinator
Ruth Kaiser. The AIAW deleted the clause
forbidding women holding athletic
scholarships from competing in
intercollegiate games.
The task remains for Stanford and
affected schools — those that award
athletic monies to men — of deciding upon
the machinery and criteria for women's
grant allocation, according to Strathairn.
'Pre-Th inking'
"We'd been doing a lot of pre-thinking,
looking for ways to improve and working
together sporadically," she said, "so we
were ready to make the change, from May
to September, 1972."
Men's and women's staffs began
working immediately and courses were
handled by either, depending on
qualifications and schedules, she added.
One aspect that was not readily soluble,
however, involved equivalent locker
facilities for both men and women. On the
east end of campus, women's showers and
dressing rooms are now available in Encina
Hall, but a small building may have to be
constructed behind the men's gym.
Women On Men's Teams
Women are not discouraged from going
out for men's non-contact sports, Ruetz
said. Two women, Diane Campbell and Jo
Ward, were on the varsity diving team.
"But the skill level effectively precludes
most women's participation," he said. "So
we really have to build up the women's

program."
He pointed to high school figures as a
gauge in deciding which activities to boost.
Last year, 20 high school women played on
football teams, as opposed to a million
men.
Women turned out in a two to seven
ratio versus men in basketball and a one to

two proportion in tennis and swimming. In
wrestling, there were 280,000 men, five
women, but females slightly out-numbered
men in gymnastics 35,000 to 32,000.
"We will have to focus down on
full-blown, intercollegiate games," Ruetz
continued. At present, women have six
varsity teams: field hocky, swimming,
fencing, basketball, golf and tennis.
"There will be no merging of teams as
long as sufficient numbers of women are
available and there are women's
intercollegiate conferences," said
Strathairn.
"Generally, we can accomodate here
pretty well," said Ruetz. "I'm for the law.
It's a positive step that will be beneficial in
the long run."

Two fairly recent pieces of federal
legislation have caused a stir among Bay
Area educational institutions, but Stanford
seems to be taking them in stride.
The first, the law which nullified
President Nixon's $576,000 income tax
deduction for donation of his
vice-presidential papers, is the Tax Reform
Act of 1969.
Referred to by some legislators as "the
New Act," it prohibits public or literary
figures from claiming deductions for
donated writings larger than the cost of
supplying those writings.
The second is a Department of Health,
Education and Welfare (HEW) proposal
requiring equity for the sexes in school
facilities, teacher hiring and athletic
programs and scholarships.
Effective Next Year
Title nine of the HEW education
omnibus bill, passed in 1972, will go into
effect next year, but most Bay Area
schools feel they are already complying
with the regulations.
Hardest hit by the tax reform act are
local libraries and museums. Cheap income
tax deductions used to be a powerful
bargaining tool in securing the manuscripts,
letters and other papers these special
collectors deem invaluable.
The Bancroft Library of the University
of California Berkeley, for one, known for
its Mark Twain and Hiram Johnson
collections, has lamented about a virtual
gifts halt, at least partly attributal to the
new law.
Minimal Effect
But Earl C. Borgeson, associate director
of University libraries here, minimized the
law's effect on Stanford libraries in general.
"It does concern us, but we don't make
nearly the effort to gather archival papers
that other libraries do. At the present time,
our experience has not put us in touch
with those who give for money reasons."
Borgeson also said he believes scientists
here are motivated by scholarly, rather than
monetary, goals in bequesting to their alma
mater. In the Stanford archives, much of
the preserved work of faculty, staff and
alumni related to present research and
development.
Duty
Hoover Institute Director W. Glenn
Campbell, on the other hand, cites the

"old-fashioned" notion of duty as the
reason his institution has faced an increase,
not a decrease, in acquisitions.
Hoover has 3000 collections, or sets of
papers, dealing with 20th century world
revolution and peace. The Institute receives
between 70 and 90 new collections per
year and has several hundred under
solicitation, according to Campbell.
Most of those contributing are
prominent statesmen, diplomats, military
figures and journalists "who never really
felt they should get money for something
they created while in the public's service,"
said Campbell.
Unstemmed Donations
He also credits the Institute's
international reputation, good management
and aggressive solication program with thfe
unstemmed donations flow.
But one area of the Stanford library

system does feel the pinch: the special
collections department, housed on the
Main Library's top floor.
"Gifts are down about 25 percent," said
manuscripts librarian Patricia Palmer. "I
know of at least three good ones that have
not come in the past year because of the
law."
Rounded Picture Sought
The department deals with literary
figures' works, trying to get a rounded
picture of them by compiling all drafts,
galleys and publishing correspondence.
Last year, special collections received
about 15 gifts and made five to 10 small
purchases.
Florian Shaskey, new chief of special
collections stressed, "It's difficult for us to
gauge the law's impact because we don't
know how many papers are out there."
Shasky oversees special collections but
concentrates on books. "It's completely
different," he says. "People who give rare
books under most circumstances can
deduct the appraised amount." Books are
easier to evaluate because records exist for
the sale of other volumnes of that edition,
he adds, but only one set of personal
papers exist.

were ready to make the change, from May
to September, 1972."
Men's and women's staffs began
working immediately and courses were
handled by either, depending on
qualifications and schedules, she added.
One aspect that was not readily soluble,
however, involved equivalent locker
facilities for both men and women. On the
east end of campus, women's showers and
dressing rooms are now available in Encina
Hall, but a small building may have to be
constructed behind the men's gym.
Women On Men's Teams
Women are not discouraged from going
out for men's non-contact sports, Ruetz
said. Two women, Diane Campbell and Jo
Ward, were on the varsity diving team.
"But the skill level effectively precludes
most women's participation," he said. "So
we really have to build up the women's

program."
He pointed to high school figures as a
gauge in deciding which activities to boost.
Last year, 20 high school women played on
football teams, as opposed to a million
men.
Women turned out in a two to seven
ratio versus men in basketball and a one to

two proportion in tennis and swimming. In
wrestling, there were 280,000 men, five
women, but females slightly out-numbered
men in gymnastics 35,000 to 32,000.
"We will have to focus down on
full-blown, intercollegiate games," Ruetz
continued. At present, women have six
varsity teams: field hocky, swimming,
fencing, basketball, golf and tennis.
"There will be no merging of teams as
long as sufficient numbers of women are
available and there are women's
intercollegiate conferences," said
Strathairn.
"Generally, we can accomodate here
pretty well," said Ruetz. "I'm for the law.
It's a positive step that will be beneficial in
the long run."

Two fairly recent pieces of federal
legislation have caused a stir among Bay
Area educational institutions, but Stanford
seems to be taking them in stride.
The first, the law which nullified
President Nixon's $576,000 income tax
deduction for donation of his
vice-presidential papers, is the Tax Reform
Act of 1969.
Referred to by some legislators as "the
New Act," it prohibits public or literary
figures from claiming deductions for
donated writings larger than the cost of
supplying those writings.
The second is a Department of Health,
Education and Welfare (HEW) proposal
requiring equity for the sexes in school
facilities, teacher hiring and athletic
programs and scholarships.
Effective Next Year
Title nine of the HEW education
omnibus bill, passed in 1972, will go into
effect next year, but most Bay Area
schools feel they are already complying
with the regulations.
Hardest hit by the tax reform act are
local libraries and museums. Cheap income
tax deductions used to be a powerful
bargaining tool in securing the manuscripts,
letters and other papers these special
collectors deem invaluable.
The Bancroft Library of the University
of California Berkeley, for one, known for
its Mark Twain and Hiram Johnson
collections, has lamented about a virtual
gifts halt, at least partly attributal to the
new law.
Minimal Effect
But Earl C. Borgeson, associate director
of University libraries here, minimized the
law's effect on Stanford libraries in general.
"It does concern us, but we don't make
nearly the effort to gather archival papers
that other libraries do. At the present time,
our experience has not put us in touch
with those who give for money reasons."
Borgeson also said he believes scientists
here are motivated by scholarly, rather than
monetary, goals in bequesting to their alma
mater. In the Stanford archives, much of
the preserved work of faculty, staff and
alumni related to present research and
development.
Duty
Hoover Institute Director W. Glenn
Campbell, on the other hand, cites the

"old-fashioned" notion of duty as the
reason his institution has faced an increase,
not a decrease, in acquisitions.
Hoover has 3000 collections, or sets of
papers, dealing with 20th century world
revolution and peace. The Institute receives
between 70 and 90 new collections per
year and has several hundred under
solicitation, according to Campbell.
Most of those contributing are
prominent statesmen, diplomats, military
figures and journalists "who never really
felt they should get money for something
they created while in the public's service,"
said Campbell.
Unstemmed Donations
He also credits the Institute's
international reputation, good management
and aggressive solication program with thfe
unstemmed donations flow.
But one area of the Stanford library

system does feel the pinch: the special
collections department, housed on the
Main Library's top floor.
"Gifts are down about 25 percent," said
manuscripts librarian Patricia Palmer. "I
know of at least three good ones that have
not come in the past year because of the
law."
Rounded Picture Sought
The department deals with literary
figures' works, trying to get a rounded
picture of them by compiling all drafts,
galleys and publishing correspondence.
Last year, special collections received
about 15 gifts and made five to 10 small
purchases.
Florian Shaskey, new chief of special
collections stressed, "It's difficult for us to
gauge the law's impact because we don't
know how many papers are out there."
Shasky oversees special collections but
concentrates on books. "It's completely
different," he says. "People who give rare
books under most circumstances can
deduct the appraised amount." Books are
easier to evaluate because records exist for
the sale of other volumnes of that edition,
he adds, but only one set of personal
papers exist.
'Suspicious' Appraisals
The "suspicious" appraisals made on
some sets of papers were probably a major
reason for the law, Palmer said. In recent
years, some deductions were questioned as
seeming "a bit high," she explained.
Palmer's main concern is that papers
which would have gone to libraries are
being divided on the market and sold
piecemeal to autograph collectors.
She added that she would like to see the
law omit literary people as an inducement
to keep their writings intact. "But even if
the law does change," she said, "it will still
be another 20 to 50 years before
collections can be put together again,"
with pieces filtering in as private buyers
will them to libraries and schools.
Other Response Mixed
The response to the more-recent HEW
ruling on collegiate athletics has been

mixed, also.
However, most athletic departments,
including Stanford's have had time to work
out ways to comply to some of the law's
requirements. For instance, all but two
physical education classes here are coed.
And the exceptions, self-defense for
women and dance for men, can be
justified, officials maintain.
Joe Ruetz, director of physical
education and athletics, said he believes
that "every school will be affected" —
perhaps severely — once the bill becomes
law officially.
Athletic Scholarships
Ruetz worries most about athletic
scholarships. "The requirement that a gift
have no sex preference attached may affect
University-donor relations," he said.
The law does not require matching sport
by sport or scholarship by scholarship but
it does require affirmative action to arrive
at a reasonable equity, Ruetz said.
People who "traditionally" prefer to
specify moneys by sex may stop giving,"
Ruetz said, adding that he feels such
conventions will eventually break down.
Two Choices
In any case, the University will have two
choices, he said: funneling scholarship
dollars away from men's activities into the
women's arena or starting a drive for more
sports funds overall.
"The traumas will probably be more
severe for the men," said Ruetz.
One of the possible unpleasant
by-products may be that the "law will
force a reassessment of the need factor of
the men's side that could ruin the
program," according to Ruetz.
"Due to Stanford's high tuition, if we
go to a strict need formula, we could
conceivably end up with only the very
poor and wealthy on our teams and no
range," he said.
Besides which, football players who
have to report for practice August 15 lose a
month of summer earning to help pay their
ways, he said.
Recruiting A Problem?
There have been no scholarships for
women in the past because according to
Women's Physical Education Chairman
Pamela Strathairn, the process of choosing
recipients involves recruiting and
"recruiting has been identified as a prime
problem in all intercollegiate athletics. On
the advice of the men, women stayed away
from it in the past."
But last year the Association for
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, an
organization similar to the men's NCAA,
felt HEW pressure and altered policy,
explained Administrative Coordinator
Ruth Kaiser. The AIAW deleted the clause
forbidding women holding athletic
scholarships from competing in
intercollegiate games.
The task remains for Stanford and
affected schools — those that award
athletic monies to men — of deciding upon
the machinery and criteria for women's
grant allocation, according to Strathairn.
'Pre-Th inking'
"We'd been doing a lot of pre-thinking,
looking for ways to improve and working
together sporadically," she said, "so we
were ready to make the change, from May
to September, 1972."
Men's and women's staffs began

here are motivated by scholarly, rather than
monetary, goals in bequesting to their alma
mater. In the Stanford archives, much of
the preserved work of faculty, staff and
alumni related to present research and
development.
Duty
Hoover Institute Director W. Glenn
Campbell, on the other hand, cites the

"old-fashioned" notion of duty as the
reason his institution has faced an increase,
not a decrease, in acquisitions.
Hoover has 3000 collections, or sets of
papers, dealing with 20th century world
revolution and peace. The Institute receives
between 70 and 90 new collections per
year and has several hundred under
solicitation, according to Campbell.
Most of those contributing are
prominent statesmen, diplomats, military
figures and journalists "who never really
felt they should get money for something
they created while in the public's service,"
said Campbell.
Unstemmed Donations
He also credits the Institute's
international reputation, good management
and aggressive solication program with thfe
unstemmed donations flow.
But one area of the Stanford library

system does feel the pinch: the special
collections department, housed on the
Main Library's top floor.
"Gifts are down about 25 percent," said
manuscripts librarian Patricia Palmer. "I
know of at least three good ones that have
not come in the past year because of the
law."
Rounded Picture Sought
The department deals with literary
figures' works, trying to get a rounded
picture of them by compiling all drafts,
galleys and publishing correspondence.
Last year, special collections received
about 15 gifts and made five to 10 small
purchases.
Florian Shaskey, new chief of special
collections stressed, "It's difficult for us to
gauge the law's impact because we don't
know how many papers are out there."
Shasky oversees special collections but
concentrates on books. "It's completely
different," he says. "People who give rare
books under most circumstances can
deduct the appraised amount." Books are
easier to evaluate because records exist for
the sale of other volumnes of that edition,
he adds, but only one set of personal
papers exist.
'Suspicious' Appraisals
The "suspicious" appraisals made on
some sets of papers were probably a major
reason for the law, Palmer said. In recent
years, some deductions were questioned as
seeming "a bit high," she explained.
Palmer's main concern is that papers
which would have gone to libraries are
being divided on the market and sold
piecemeal to autograph collectors.
She added that she would like to see the
law omit literary people as an inducement
to keep their writings intact. "But even if
the law does change," she said, "it will still
be another 20 to 50 years before
collections can be put together again,"
with pieces filtering in as private buyers
will them to libraries and schools.
Other Response Mixed
The response to the more-recent HEW
ruling on collegiate athletics has been

mixed, also.
However, most athletic departments,
including Stanford's have had time to work
out ways to comply to some of the law's
requirements. For instance, all but two
physical education classes here are coed.
And the exceptions, self-defense for
women and dance for men, can be
justified, officials maintain.
Joe Ruetz, director of physical
education and athletics, said he believes
that "every school will be affected" —
perhaps severely — once the bill becomes
law officially.
Athletic Scholarships
Ruetz worries most about athletic
scholarships. "The requirement that a gift
have no sex preference attached may affect
University-donor relations," he said.
The law does not require matching sport
by sport or scholarship by scholarship but
it does require affirmative action to arrive
at a reasonable equity, Ruetz said.
People who "traditionally" prefer to
specify moneys by sex may stop giving,"
Ruetz said, adding that he feels such
conventions will eventually break down.
Two Choices
In any case, the University will have two
choices, he said: funneling scholarship
dollars away from men's activities into the
women's arena or starting a drive for more
sports funds overall.
"The traumas will probably be more
severe for the men," said Ruetz.
One of the possible unpleasant
by-products may be that the "law will
force a reassessment of the need factor of
the men's side that could ruin the
program," according to Ruetz.
"Due to Stanford's high tuition, if we
go to a strict need formula, we could
conceivably end up with only the very
poor and wealthy on our teams and no
range," he said.
Besides which, football players who
have to report for practice August 15 lose a
month of summer earning to help pay their
ways, he said.
Recruiting A Problem?
There have been no scholarships for
women in the past because according to
Women's Physical Education Chairman
Pamela Strathairn, the process of choosing
recipients involves recruiting and
"recruiting has been identified as a prime
problem in all intercollegiate athletics. On
the advice of the men, women stayed away
from it in the past."
But last year the Association for
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, an
organization similar to the men's NCAA,
felt HEW pressure and altered policy,
explained Administrative Coordinator
Ruth Kaiser. The AIAW deleted the clause
forbidding women holding athletic
scholarships from competing in
intercollegiate games.
The task remains for Stanford and
affected schools — those that award
athletic monies to men — of deciding upon
the machinery and criteria for women's
grant allocation, according to Strathairn.
'Pre-Th inking'
"We'd been doing a lot of pre-thinking,
looking for ways to improve and working
together sporadically," she said, "so we
were ready to make the change, from May
to September, 1972."
Men's and women's staffs began
working immediately and courses were
handled by either, depending on
qualifications and schedules, she added.
One aspect that was not readily soluble,
however, involved equivalent locker
facilities for both men and women. On the
east end of campus, women's showers and
dressing rooms are now available in Encina
Hall, but a small building may have to be
constructed behind the men's gym.
Women On Men's Teams
Women are not discouraged from going
out for men's non-contact sports, Ruetz
said. Two women, Diane Campbell and Jo
Ward, were on the varsity diving team.
"But the skill level effectively precludes
most women's participation," he said. "So
we really have to build up the women's

program."
He pointed to high school figures as a
gauge in deciding which activities to boost.
Last year, 20 high school women played on
football teams, as opposed to a million
men.
Women turned out in a two to seven
ratio versus men in basketball and a one to

two proportion in tennis and swimming. In
wrestling, there were 280,000 men, five
women, but females slightly out-numbered
men in gymnastics 35,000 to 32,000.
"We will have to focus down on
full-blown, intercollegiate games," Ruetz
continued. At present, women have six
varsity teams: field hocky, swimming,
fencing, basketball, golf and tennis.
"There will be no merging of teams as
long as sufficient numbers of women are
available and there are women's
intercollegiate conferences," said
Strathairn.
"Generally, we can accomodate here
pretty well," said Ruetz. "I'm for the law.
It's a positive step that will be beneficial in
the long run."

Two fairly recent pieces of federal
legislation have caused a stir among Bay
Area educational institutions, but Stanford
seems to be taking them in stride.
The first, the law which nullified
President Nixon's $576,000 income tax
deduction for donation of his
vice-presidential papers, is the Tax Reform
Act of 1969.
Referred to by some legislators as "the
New Act," it prohibits public or literary
figures from claiming deductions for
donated writings larger than the cost of
supplying those writings.
The second is a Department of Health,
Education and Welfare (HEW) proposal
requiring equity for the sexes in school
facilities, teacher hiring and athletic
programs and scholarships.
Effective Next Year
Title nine of the HEW education
omnibus bill, passed in 1972, will go into
effect next year, but most Bay Area
schools feel they are already complying
with the regulations.
Hardest hit by the tax reform act are
local libraries and museums. Cheap income
tax deductions used to be a powerful
bargaining tool in securing the manuscripts,
letters and other papers these special
collectors deem invaluable.
The Bancroft Library of the University
of California Berkeley, for one, known for
its Mark Twain and Hiram Johnson
collections, has lamented about a virtual
gifts halt, at least partly attributal to the
new law.
Minimal Effect
But Earl C. Borgeson, associate director
of University libraries here, minimized the
law's effect on Stanford libraries in general.
"It does concern us, but we don't make
nearly the effort to gather archival papers
that other libraries do. At the present time,
our experience has not put us in touch
with those who give for money reasons."
Borgeson also said he believes scientists
here are motivated by scholarly, rather than
monetary, goals in bequesting to their alma
mater. In the Stanford archives, much of
the preserved work of faculty, staff and
alumni related to present research and
development.

at a reasonable equity, Ruetz said.
People who "traditionally" prefer to
specify moneys by sex may stop giving,"
Ruetz said, adding that he feels such
conventions will eventually break down.
Two Choices
In any case, the University will have two
choices, he said: funneling scholarship
dollars away from men's activities into the
women's arena or starting a drive for more
sports funds overall.
"The traumas will probably be more
severe for the men," said Ruetz.
One of the possible unpleasant
by-products may be that the "law will
force a reassessment of the need factor of
the men's side that could ruin the
program," according to Ruetz.
"Due to Stanford's high tuition, if we
go to a strict need formula, we could
conceivably end up with only the very
poor and wealthy on our teams and no
range," he said.
Besides which, football players who
have to report for practice August 15 lose a
month of summer earning to help pay their
ways, he said.
Recruiting A Problem?
There have been no scholarships for
women in the past because according to
Women's Physical Education Chairman
Pamela Strathairn, the process of choosing
recipients involves recruiting and
"recruiting has been identified as a prime
problem in all intercollegiate athletics. On
the advice of the men, women stayed away
from it in the past."
But last year the Association for
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, an
organization similar to the men's NCAA,
felt HEW pressure and altered policy,
explained Administrative Coordinator
Ruth Kaiser. The AIAW deleted the clause
forbidding women holding athletic
scholarships from competing in
intercollegiate games.
The task remains for Stanford and
affected schools — those that award
athletic monies to men — of deciding upon
the machinery and criteria for women's
grant allocation, according to Strathairn.
'Pre-Th inking'
"We'd been doing a lot of pre-thinking,
looking for ways to improve and working
together sporadically," she said, "so we
were ready to make the change, from May
to September, 1972."
Men's and women's staffs began
working immediately and courses were
handled by either, depending on
qualifications and schedules, she added.
One aspect that was not readily soluble,
however, involved equivalent locker
facilities for both men and women. On the
east end of campus, women's showers and
dressing rooms are now available in Encina
Hall, but a small building may have to be
constructed behind the men's gym.
Women On Men's Teams
Women are not discouraged from going
out for men's non-contact sports, Ruetz
said. Two women, Diane Campbell and Jo
Ward, were on the varsity diving team.
"But the skill level effectively precludes
most women's participation," he said. "So
we really have to build up the women's

program."
He pointed to high school figures as a
gauge in deciding which activities to boost.
Last year, 20 high school women played on
football teams, as opposed to a million
men.
Women turned out in a two to seven
ratio versus men in basketball and a one to

two proportion in tennis and swimming. In
wrestling, there were 280,000 men, five
women, but females slightly out-numbered
men in gymnastics 35,000 to 32,000.
"We will have to focus down on
full-blown, intercollegiate games," Ruetz
continued. At present, women have six
varsity teams: field hocky, swimming,
fencing, basketball, golf and tennis.
"There will be no merging of teams as
long as sufficient numbers of women are
available and there are women's
intercollegiate conferences," said
Strathairn.
"Generally, we can accomodate here
pretty well," said Ruetz. "I'm for the law.
It's a positive step that will be beneficial in
the long run."
