Nguyen Huu Thai, a South Vietnamese
journalist, architect and a political prisoner
for the past two years, has accepted the
invitation to be ASSU guest professor for
1974-1975.
His coming here in September now
appears to be contingent only upon
receiving an exit visa from Vietnam and an
entrance visa to the United States.
Students voted in April to offer Thai
the position of guest professor. The
Anthropology Department has since voted
to set up an urbanization course for Thai
to instruct.
Thai is currently in a state of semi-house
arrest in Saigon.

Dr. John L. Emmett, a Stanford
alumnus who heads the Laser Fusion
Division of the Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory, will discuss his research
Thursday at 4:15 p.m. in Skilling
Auditorium.
Lasers are considered one of the most
promising means of achieving controlled
nuclear fusion to provide an almost
limitless source of energy.
Emmett, who earned his Ph.D. in
physics here in 1967, was engaged in laser
research for a number of years before
taking his present post at Livermore.
His speech is part of a summer series of
Aerospace Technology Seminars.
