# Special Summer Programs Attract Students
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Summer fun in the Stanford sun.
Granted that's what lures most people to the California
coast for summer school, but Stanford also offers some
unique summer programs which are academically alluring.
The summer programs here aren't really integrated at
all. However, a number of departments — in particular the
communication, dramatics and language departments —
sponsor their own individual summer programs.
The departments can offer intensive courses in the
summer which couldn't be given during the regular year
because of time restrictions on the part of students and
faculty.
Drama Workshop Studies 'Search For Self'
"It's weird. It's grotesque. It's violent. It's highly
sexual."
It's contemporary theater that Visiting Assoc. Drama
Prof. Charles C. Hampton is describing. And the Drama
Department has a special summer program concerning it
entitled "The Search For Self In Contemporary Theatre."
Discussing such plays as Edward Albee's Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf? allows the 12 students in the program
to study role-playing.
The students implement what they learn about "finding
different acting means for dramatizing alternate
identities," by participating in acting, lighting and staging,
Hampton said.
In the acting sessions, the students do exercises which
"open sensory awareness," Hampton remarked.
They do support exercises because "people have to
leam to trust each other," he said. One student said
"trust-like exercises get you nicely embarrassed." An
example of a trust exercise is touching another person's
face to feel the contours of his features.
The beginning of the workshop centered on the use of
masks in plays. Cole said the students study masks because
"masks make you lose all your inhibitions. People have to
treat you as a different person. Masks are a personality
which the players put on."
A student production Aug. 7 will conclude the
workshop. The students will present a number of scenes
from plays which have themes of role-playing.
Film Makers, Broadcasters Thrive Here
If hearing people mention directing, cameras and
take-one-take-two makes you think you're in the wrong

part of California, don't worry.
Fanatical movie makers thrive here as well as in
Hollywood. In fact, an entire summer program is devoted
to this type of thing — the 32nd Annual Broadcasting and
Film Institute.
The Institute is divided into three workshops — mass
media, film production and broadcast news.
The summer program gives students a practical
approach to communication. "You get a very good chance
to do what we call 'hands-on' work," Communication
Prof. Jules Dundes, the program's director, remarked. The
program during the regular year is more theoretical, he
added.
The 19 students in the broadcast news laboratory put
together their own newscasts.
On Sundays they go up to the KPIX-TV studio in San
Francisco. There they cut and edit their broadcast,
formalizing it with professional help. Eventually they
watch the broadcast on closed-circuit television.
The film production workshop introduces 17 students
to film aesthetics and criticism, research and writing for
film and S-Bmm and 16mm production. The workshop
culminates with each student producing his own film.
The mass media workshop is more general than the
other workshops. Instead of studying one media
intensively, the 15 students investigate print as well as
broadcast and film media.
Pre-Med Program Helps Minorities
This summer 29 students are involved in a pre-medical
program. The relatively new program — two years old in
its present form — is designed to help students who are
having academic problems with the pre-med curriculum
during the regular year.
Another goal of the program is to increase the number
of minority students and women applying to medical
school.
The students — 24 of whom are minority students and
almost all of whom are on financial aid — live together in
the Alpha Delta Phi house with their tutors.
The program bombards the students with the idea of
medicine as a career. In the house, students hear lectures
on career opportunities from medically-oriented people
such as veterinarians and dentists.
Besides taking classes, the students spend 15 hours a
week getting work experience at the Medical Center. Their
jobs range from taking patient histories to analyzing blood
samples.

Education Courses: Teacher's First Step
"School's out for the summer" applies to most people
affiliated with high school.
However, students at the Stanford School of Education
who are studying to be high school teachers don't claim
Alice Cooper's hit as their theme song. For them, summer
is the beginning of a special educational program — the
Secondary Teacher Education Program (STEP).
STEP is a 12-month, fifth-year program which leads to
a Master of Arts degree in education and a California
secondary school teaching credential.
During the summer the students take courses in their
own academic field and general courses in education.
A major part of this quarter's program is the summer
practicum. The students work with a small group of local
high school students in a process called "micro-teaching."
The Stanford student is filmed as he implements
various instructional strategies and techniques. Later a
supervisor and the student review his performance.
Learning English The Easy Way?
Summer is apparently the time to learn a language.
The 52 foreign students tired of learning English by
listening to Dick Cavett's talk shows should not feel
persecuted.
They need merely look into the other cubicles in the
language laboratory to see American students struggling
over Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, French, German,
Italian and Portuguese.
Most of the students in the English for Foreign
Students program plan to enter graduate school here in the
fall. The students were advised to enter either the ten-week
intensive program or the eight-week program according to
their English proficiency before they enrolled.
The students learn writing, reading and grammar on an
academic-oriented level. They listen to talk shows and
Stanford professors' lectures for listening comprehension.
Homework and female teachers are novelties to many
students, Summer Program Coordinator Beverley J.
McChesney said. She admitted these teachers have to work
a bit harder to gain the students' respect.
The students have a hard time "adjusting to the
different living conditions and the U.S. educational
system," McChesney said.
She noted that it is particularly difficult for people who
have been teaching assistants or lecturers back home to
come to America to be helpless students once again.

leam to trust each other," he said. One student said
"trust-like exercises get you nicely embarrassed." An
example of a trust exercise is touching another person's
face to feel the contours of his features.
The beginning of the workshop centered on the use of
masks in plays. Cole said the students study masks because
"masks make you lose all your inhibitions. People have to
treat you as a different person. Masks are a personality
which the players put on."
A student production Aug. 7 will conclude the
workshop. The students will present a number of scenes
from plays which have themes of role-playing.
Film Makers, Broadcasters Thrive Here
If hearing people mention directing, cameras and
take-one-take-two makes you think you're in the wrong

part of California, don't worry.
Fanatical movie makers thrive here as well as in
Hollywood. In fact, an entire summer program is devoted
to this type of thing — the 32nd Annual Broadcasting and
Film Institute.
The Institute is divided into three workshops — mass
media, film production and broadcast news.
The summer program gives students a practical
approach to communication. "You get a very good chance
to do what we call 'hands-on' work," Communication
Prof. Jules Dundes, the program's director, remarked. The
program during the regular year is more theoretical, he
added.
The 19 students in the broadcast news laboratory put
together their own newscasts.
On Sundays they go up to the KPIX-TV studio in San
Francisco. There they cut and edit their broadcast,
formalizing it with professional help. Eventually they
watch the broadcast on closed-circuit television.
The film production workshop introduces 17 students
to film aesthetics and criticism, research and writing for
film and S-Bmm and 16mm production. The workshop
culminates with each student producing his own film.
The mass media workshop is more general than the
other workshops. Instead of studying one media
intensively, the 15 students investigate print as well as
broadcast and film media.
Pre-Med Program Helps Minorities
This summer 29 students are involved in a pre-medical
program. The relatively new program — two years old in
its present form — is designed to help students who are
having academic problems with the pre-med curriculum
during the regular year.
Another goal of the program is to increase the number
of minority students and women applying to medical
school.
The students — 24 of whom are minority students and
almost all of whom are on financial aid — live together in
the Alpha Delta Phi house with their tutors.
The program bombards the students with the idea of
medicine as a career. In the house, students hear lectures
on career opportunities from medically-oriented people
such as veterinarians and dentists.
Besides taking classes, the students spend 15 hours a
week getting work experience at the Medical Center. Their
jobs range from taking patient histories to analyzing blood
samples.

Education Courses: Teacher's First Step
"School's out for the summer" applies to most people
affiliated with high school.
However, students at the Stanford School of Education
who are studying to be high school teachers don't claim
Alice Cooper's hit as their theme song. For them, summer
is the beginning of a special educational program — the
Secondary Teacher Education Program (STEP).
STEP is a 12-month, fifth-year program which leads to
a Master of Arts degree in education and a California
secondary school teaching credential.
During the summer the students take courses in their
own academic field and general courses in education.
A major part of this quarter's program is the summer
practicum. The students work with a small group of local
high school students in a process called "micro-teaching."
The Stanford student is filmed as he implements
various instructional strategies and techniques. Later a
supervisor and the student review his performance.
Learning English The Easy Way?
Summer is apparently the time to learn a language.
The 52 foreign students tired of learning English by
listening to Dick Cavett's talk shows should not feel
persecuted.
They need merely look into the other cubicles in the
language laboratory to see American students struggling
over Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, French, German,
Italian and Portuguese.
Most of the students in the English for Foreign
Students program plan to enter graduate school here in the
fall. The students were advised to enter either the ten-week
intensive program or the eight-week program according to
their English proficiency before they enrolled.
The students learn writing, reading and grammar on an
academic-oriented level. They listen to talk shows and
Stanford professors' lectures for listening comprehension.
Homework and female teachers are novelties to many
students, Summer Program Coordinator Beverley J.
McChesney said. She admitted these teachers have to work
a bit harder to gain the students' respect.
The students have a hard time "adjusting to the
different living conditions and the U.S. educational
system," McChesney said.
She noted that it is particularly difficult for people who
have been teaching assistants or lecturers back home to
come to America to be helpless students once again.
Summer fun in the Stanford sun.
Granted that's what lures most people to the California
coast for summer school, but Stanford also offers some
unique summer programs which are academically alluring.
The summer programs here aren't really integrated at
all. However, a number of departments — in particular the
communication, dramatics and language departments —
sponsor their own individual summer programs.
The departments can offer intensive courses in the
summer which couldn't be given during the regular year
because of time restrictions on the part of students and
faculty.
Drama Workshop Studies 'Search For Self'
"It's weird. It's grotesque. It's violent. It's highly
sexual."
It's contemporary theater that Visiting Assoc. Drama
Prof. Charles C. Hampton is describing. And the Drama
Department has a special summer program concerning it
entitled "The Search For Self In Contemporary Theatre."
Discussing such plays as Edward Albee's Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf? allows the 12 students in the program
to study role-playing.
The students implement what they learn about "finding
different acting means for dramatizing alternate
identities," by participating in acting, lighting and staging,
Hampton said.
In the acting sessions, the students do exercises which
"open sensory awareness," Hampton remarked.
They do support exercises because "people have to
leam to trust each other," he said. One student said
"trust-like exercises get you nicely embarrassed." An

program during the regular year is more theoretical, he
added.
The 19 students in the broadcast news laboratory put
together their own newscasts.
On Sundays they go up to the KPIX-TV studio in San
Francisco. There they cut and edit their broadcast,
formalizing it with professional help. Eventually they
watch the broadcast on closed-circuit television.
The film production workshop introduces 17 students
to film aesthetics and criticism, research and writing for
film and S-Bmm and 16mm production. The workshop
culminates with each student producing his own film.
The mass media workshop is more general than the
other workshops. Instead of studying one media
intensively, the 15 students investigate print as well as
broadcast and film media.
Pre-Med Program Helps Minorities
This summer 29 students are involved in a pre-medical
program. The relatively new program — two years old in
its present form — is designed to help students who are
having academic problems with the pre-med curriculum
during the regular year.
Another goal of the program is to increase the number
of minority students and women applying to medical
school.
The students — 24 of whom are minority students and
almost all of whom are on financial aid — live together in
the Alpha Delta Phi house with their tutors.
The program bombards the students with the idea of
medicine as a career. In the house, students hear lectures
on career opportunities from medically-oriented people
such as veterinarians and dentists.
Besides taking classes, the students spend 15 hours a
week getting work experience at the Medical Center. Their
jobs range from taking patient histories to analyzing blood
samples.

Education Courses: Teacher's First Step
"School's out for the summer" applies to most people
affiliated with high school.
However, students at the Stanford School of Education
who are studying to be high school teachers don't claim
Alice Cooper's hit as their theme song. For them, summer
is the beginning of a special educational program — the
Secondary Teacher Education Program (STEP).
STEP is a 12-month, fifth-year program which leads to
a Master of Arts degree in education and a California
secondary school teaching credential.
During the summer the students take courses in their
own academic field and general courses in education.
A major part of this quarter's program is the summer
practicum. The students work with a small group of local
high school students in a process called "micro-teaching."
The Stanford student is filmed as he implements
various instructional strategies and techniques. Later a
supervisor and the student review his performance.
Learning English The Easy Way?
Summer is apparently the time to learn a language.
The 52 foreign students tired of learning English by
listening to Dick Cavett's talk shows should not feel
persecuted.
They need merely look into the other cubicles in the
language laboratory to see American students struggling
over Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, French, German,
Italian and Portuguese.
Most of the students in the English for Foreign
Students program plan to enter graduate school here in the
fall. The students were advised to enter either the ten-week
intensive program or the eight-week program according to
their English proficiency before they enrolled.
The students learn writing, reading and grammar on an
academic-oriented level. They listen to talk shows and
Stanford professors' lectures for listening comprehension.
Homework and female teachers are novelties to many
students, Summer Program Coordinator Beverley J.
McChesney said. She admitted these teachers have to work
a bit harder to gain the students' respect.
The students have a hard time "adjusting to the
different living conditions and the U.S. educational
system," McChesney said.
She noted that it is particularly difficult for people who
have been teaching assistants or lecturers back home to
come to America to be helpless students once again.
Summer fun in the Stanford sun.
Granted that's what lures most people to the California
coast for summer school, but Stanford also offers some
unique summer programs which are academically alluring.
The summer programs here aren't really integrated at
all. However, a number of departments — in particular the
communication, dramatics and language departments —
sponsor their own individual summer programs.
The departments can offer intensive courses in the
summer which couldn't be given during the regular year
because of time restrictions on the part of students and
faculty.
Drama Workshop Studies 'Search For Self'
"It's weird. It's grotesque. It's violent. It's highly
sexual."
It's contemporary theater that Visiting Assoc. Drama
Prof. Charles C. Hampton is describing. And the Drama
Department has a special summer program concerning it
entitled "The Search For Self In Contemporary Theatre."
Discussing such plays as Edward Albee's Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf? allows the 12 students in the program
to study role-playing.
The students implement what they learn about "finding
different acting means for dramatizing alternate
identities," by participating in acting, lighting and staging,
Hampton said.
In the acting sessions, the students do exercises which
"open sensory awareness," Hampton remarked.
They do support exercises because "people have to
leam to trust each other," he said. One student said
"trust-like exercises get you nicely embarrassed." An
example of a trust exercise is touching another person's
face to feel the contours of his features.
The beginning of the workshop centered on the use of
masks in plays. Cole said the students study masks because
"masks make you lose all your inhibitions. People have to
treat you as a different person. Masks are a personality
which the players put on."
A student production Aug. 7 will conclude the
workshop. The students will present a number of scenes
from plays which have themes of role-playing.
Film Makers, Broadcasters Thrive Here
If hearing people mention directing, cameras and
take-one-take-two makes you think you're in the wrong

part of California, don't worry.
Fanatical movie makers thrive here as well as in
Hollywood. In fact, an entire summer program is devoted
to this type of thing — the 32nd Annual Broadcasting and
Film Institute.
The Institute is divided into three workshops — mass
media, film production and broadcast news.
The summer program gives students a practical
approach to communication. "You get a very good chance
to do what we call 'hands-on' work," Communication
Prof. Jules Dundes, the program's director, remarked. The
program during the regular year is more theoretical, he
added.
