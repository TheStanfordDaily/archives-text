# Cantor Rodin Collection Previewed
## 
### PAUL YEUELL 
August Rodin, who died in
1917 at the age of 77, was a key
personality in revolutionizing
both drawing and sculpture.
Rising out of a heavy training in
traditional sculpture and painting,
Rodin married classical craft with
a free expressive hand.
A preview of the collection of

Rodin sculpture donated to the
Stanford Museum by B. Gerald
Cantor will be on exhibit in the
Art Gallery through October.
The small exhibit at the
gallery, one-third of the fall show
which will encompass the entire
Cantor gift of 89 pieces, was
architectured by Lee Morgan and
Kirk Varnedoe, a Stanford Ph.D.
It is argued that Rodin was
particularly concerned with the
effect of light reflected on the
surfaces of the finished bronze
castings. At Stanford, we have the
good fortune of seeing Rodin's
work in galleries built in Rodin's
life-time having architecture and
lighting similar to the galleries
that Rodin knew.
The highlight of this preview is
the study called The Burghers of
Calais. Most people familiar with
Rodin's work know this piece as a
cluster of six men clad in
sack-cloth, bearing in every
gesture immense grief and despair.
But at the preview exhibit,
Varnedoe has remounted these
figures, stringing them out in
single file across a white plane,
heightening their dramatic impact.
In 1347, during the Hundred
Year's War, the English army
besieged the small French town of
Calais. After several months, the
English king offered the town a
deal — the long brutal siege would
be lifted in exchange for the keys
to the city and six citizens bound
together with rope halters who
would most probably be
executed.
Rodin was commissioned in
1884 by the town of Calais to
build a monument to the six men.

Rodin's commissioners envisioned
a traditional pyramid monument
on the town square.
But Rodin had something
altogether different in mind. His
plan was to cast the six men
life-size, at ground-level, marching
single file across the square,
freezing them in that moment of
unselfish sacrifice.
That plan being too outrageous
for the commissioners, the
compromised work was cast as
most people know it. But
Varnedoe's arrangement brings
back the power that Rodin
intended.

Rodin's studied excesses — the
excruciatingly expressive gestures,
the gigantic weight of the three
keys dragging down John D'Aire,
the open surrender of the youth,
and the broken shoulders of
Eustache — bring the Burghers to
life.
Full-size, in solemn procession
across the square of Calais, these
bronze mimes would re-enact the
bitterly tragic scene for the
duration of the castings.
A dynamic piece which
depends on Rodin's selected
exposures of unfinished clay is the
Centauress, a half-woman,
half-horse sculpture that explodes
with sensual fury.
Here, all the forward rushing,
top-heavy momentum of a woman
writhing in anguish balancing over
the gathering power of huge
haunches focuses on her

unfinished hands, which pull
immutably one against the other.
Rodin's delightful showing of
the undetailed clay or the original
stone, as in the Danaide, heightens
the thrill of recognition that
something very much alve has
come from these inanimate
mediums.
The powerful, seated figure
called The American Athlete,
seems to drive forward head-long,
wielding massive fore-arms with
the momentum of a pro football
guard. And in fact, American
Athlete, like many of his pieces, is
off balance, the anticipation of
the fall giving movement to the
sculpture.
An afternoon with the Rodin
collection is a lesson in perception
and a non-verbal dissertation on
the emotions. Don't wait until the
fall to begin to study Rodin.

Rodin's commissioners envisioned
a traditional pyramid monument
on the town square.
But Rodin had something
altogether different in mind. His
plan was to cast the six men
life-size, at ground-level, marching
single file across the square,
freezing them in that moment of
unselfish sacrifice.
That plan being too outrageous
for the commissioners, the
compromised work was cast as
most people know it. But
Varnedoe's arrangement brings
back the power that Rodin
intended.

Rodin's studied excesses — the
excruciatingly expressive gestures,
the gigantic weight of the three
keys dragging down John D'Aire,
the open surrender of the youth,
and the broken shoulders of
Eustache — bring the Burghers to
life.
Full-size, in solemn procession
across the square of Calais, these
bronze mimes would re-enact the
bitterly tragic scene for the
duration of the castings.
A dynamic piece which
depends on Rodin's selected
exposures of unfinished clay is the
Centauress, a half-woman,
half-horse sculpture that explodes
with sensual fury.
Here, all the forward rushing,
top-heavy momentum of a woman
writhing in anguish balancing over
the gathering power of huge
haunches focuses on her

unfinished hands, which pull
immutably one against the other.
Rodin's delightful showing of
the undetailed clay or the original
stone, as in the Danaide, heightens
the thrill of recognition that
something very much alve has
come from these inanimate
mediums.
The powerful, seated figure
called The American Athlete,
seems to drive forward head-long,
wielding massive fore-arms with
the momentum of a pro football
guard. And in fact, American
Athlete, like many of his pieces, is
off balance, the anticipation of
the fall giving movement to the
sculpture.
An afternoon with the Rodin
collection is a lesson in perception
and a non-verbal dissertation on
the emotions. Don't wait until the
fall to begin to study Rodin.

CONDEMNED OF CALAIS—These figures are Rodin's memorial to six citizens of the town of Calais who
were turned over to the English during the Hundred Years War as a ransom to halt the enemy seige. The
town commissioned Rodin to do the work in 1884, and the sculptor's original design called for six life-size
figures.
August Rodin, who died in
1917 at the age of 77, was a key
personality in revolutionizing
both drawing and sculpture.
Rising out of a heavy training in
traditional sculpture and painting,
Rodin married classical craft with
a free expressive hand.
A preview of the collection of

Rodin sculpture donated to the
Stanford Museum by B. Gerald
Cantor will be on exhibit in the
Art Gallery through October.
The small exhibit at the
gallery, one-third of the fall show
which will encompass the entire
Cantor gift of 89 pieces, was
architectured by Lee Morgan and
Kirk Varnedoe, a Stanford Ph.D.
It is argued that Rodin was
particularly concerned with the
effect of light reflected on the
surfaces of the finished bronze
castings. At Stanford, we have the
good fortune of seeing Rodin's
work in galleries built in Rodin's
life-time having architecture and
lighting similar to the galleries
that Rodin knew.
The highlight of this preview is
the study called The Burghers of
Calais. Most people familiar with
Rodin's work know this piece as a
cluster of six men clad in
sack-cloth, bearing in every
gesture immense grief and despair.
But at the preview exhibit,
Varnedoe has remounted these
figures, stringing them out in
single file across a white plane,
heightening their dramatic impact.
In 1347, during the Hundred
Year's War, the English army
besieged the small French town of
Calais. After several months, the
English king offered the town a
deal — the long brutal siege would
be lifted in exchange for the keys
to the city and six citizens bound
together with rope halters who
would most probably be
executed.

1884 by the town of Calais to
