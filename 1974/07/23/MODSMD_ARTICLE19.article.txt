# Clapton's Guitar Satisfies Friends
## 
### M.G. HARRIS 
Many critics and rock fans
alike have called his guitar playing
the most imaginative and fluent,
tasteful and exciting style of
sixties rock. And so it is no
wonder that, when Eric Clapton
returned to the scene after more
than three years of hibernation,
his old followers and admirers
flocked together to get one more
glimpse of a true superstar.
Such was the case Sunday
afternoon and evening, when
Clapton played at the Cow Palace
for two Bill Graham-produced
concerts, heading a bill which also
included the new British rock
group, "Ross." The near-revivalist
fever of the crowd approximated
perhaps only that of the recent
tour of Bob Dylan and the Band.
Ross opened the afternoon
concert with a half dozen
deafeningly-loud cuts, mostly
taken from their debut album,
Ross. The group was
well-received by the sell-out
crowd, an astonishing feat in
itself, as most were there to see
Clapton and only Clapton.
When, after a short break, old
"Slowhand" did appear on stage,
the hysteria of the crowd reached
a euphoric plateau, a high which
the performers maintained
through the next two hours of old
and new material. Clapton,
wearing ragged overalls, a beach
hat, and dark glasses, seemed very
much in control of the affair, a
quality in which he has always
been found lacking before while
playing with such groups as The
Yardbirds, Cream, Blind Faith,
and Derek and the Dominoes.
Clapton, a performer known for
his brilliant work with the electric
guitar, startled many of those
present by opening the set with

two acoustic songs with Yvonne
Elliman, well-known in her own
right for her performance as Mary
Magdalen in "Jesus Christ
Superstar." Starting softly,
Clapton chose "Smile," a Charlie
Chaplin ditty as his opener. The
totally unexpected number had a
dramatically mellowing effect on
the crowd.
Clapton continued the wooden
music with a cut from his new
album 461 Ocean Boulevard,
called "Let It Grow," a prayerful
selection, much in the tradition of
his more religiously-oriented
work. The album, which is the
only one produced thus far by the
new group, has received
middling-to-fair reviews and thus
it was no great disappointment to
the crowd that only a few new
cuts were played.
Laying aside the acoustic
guitar, Clapton plunged into the
more inspired portion of his
performance, to the roaring
approval of the audience.
Beginning with "Tell The Truth,"
from the Lay la and Other Love
Songs of Derek and the
Dominoes, Clapton strung
together almost a dozen numbers
in a row that substantiated the
crowd's adulation of his playing
skills.
The next two songs "Willy and
the Hand Jive" and "Blues
Power" featured the superb
back-up work of Clapton's
"friends." With the beautiful
Elliman adding her voice to
"Hand Jive," the song,
popularized recently by the New
Riders of the Purple Sage, took on
a host of altogether new
connotations.
Then came the long-awaited
climax, the simple moment for
which many in the audience had

laid down their cash. With the
familiar opening trill of his guitar,
Clapton launched headlong into
"Layla," a song which Clapton
has said in the past is the only one
he has written that has given
lasting pleasure and a sense of
fulfillment. With a certain urgency
not developed on the album
version, Clapton finally shucked
his reserve and, at times turning
his back to the audience, really
unwound. Then, as he
consistently did throughout the
concert, Clapton withdrew the
crowd from that peak and
brought them down with a truly
moving version of "Have You
Ever Loved A Woman?," one of
the "other" love songs on Layla.
In typical style, Clapton once
again took his fans higher, in the
opinion of this reviewer to the
highest level, with a blazing
version of the Cream classic
"Badge," a version that went on
and on, yet could well have
continued into the night. It was
on this number that Clapton

really unleashed his ability,
playing his guitar with the
eloquence and feel that other
guitarists strangle with the
death-grip they put on the guitar's
neck.
Following that, he played "In
the Presence of the Lord," a cut
which says more about Clapton's
life than the mere religious
implications made obvious by the
song's title. After a three-year
bout with heroin addiction, the
knowledg? that he has "finally
found a place to be," be it in the
presence of the Lord or otherwise,
is comforting to those who have
missed his style and talent for the
last four years.
Following a cut from the new
album, called "Mainline Florida,"
which need not have been played
at all, Clapton closed with a
version of "Crossroads," which
seemed to go completely over the
heads of the crowd. It was rather
amusing to observe how long it
took for the audience to pick up

the theme, but once it did, the
response was profound.
After a good ten minutes of
applause and foot-stomping, not
altogether easy in the
stoney-wall-to-wall press on the
Cow Palace floor, Clapton
returned, introduced the band,
which included Carl Radle of "the
Dominoes," and then played a
rousing version of Chuck Berry's
"Little Queenie." It is interesting
that he chose to open and close
the concert with selections so
obviously not his own, but the
interior of the concert was
undeniably and crowd-pleasingly
his.
Although short, extending less
than three hours in opposition to
the recent ten-hour "on the green
concerts," the set was everything
the crowd was looking for and a
little bit more. One hopes that it
will not be another four-year
drought before the next
opportunity to see one of rock's
foremost superstars.
