## Olivieri Questions 'Live Oak' Viability 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri is ready to close the
financial books on another
campus publication — the
proposed weekly news-features
newspaper Live Oak — he told the
Daily yesterday.
Olivieri questioned the
"financial viability" of Live Oak
and accused Live Oak
Editor-Business Manager Bill
Weinstein of trying to "rip off the
Stanford community."
In related publication news,
Olivieri announced yesterday that
he will recommend that the
Stanford Chaparral be placed in
receivership with the ASSU
Publications Board as the feature
magazine's "guardian."
The publication, now over
$2000 in debt, should suspend
publication, he said adding that
the Pub Board will then offer the
Chappie to "the most qualified"
party.
Live Oak was to begin
publishing this fall, with offices in
the Storke Student Publications
Building. However, Olivieri said he
has recommended that the Pub
Board deny Live Oak a $1500
stipend the board approved last
quarter.
No Space
As of yesterday, the
publication will also not be
permitted to use the Storke
Building or to receive a $500 loan
from the dean of student affairs
office for supplies, he said.
Olivieri explained he's
clamping down on Live Oak
because Weinstein has failed to
come up with $8500 independent
financial backing he indicated he

would have before the fall. Pub
Board approval of Live Oak's
grant was contingent upon that
money, Olivieri said.
"My big question, and this is
where we have our big problems,
is financial viability at the
outset," he stated.
"I want to ascertain exactly
how much cash he [Weinstein]
has available, exactly what he
plans to do with those funds,
what precisely are going to be his
costs . .. what exactly are going
to be his cash inflows ... before
I'm willing to give him the green
light."
No Comment
Contacted in Washington last
night, Weinstein declined to
comment saying only that "Live
Oak will publish in the fall."
Olivieri, Weinstein and Dale
Snape, assistant to the dean of
student affairs will meet Thursday
to discuss Live Oak's future.
Weinstein has collected at least
$2000 in addition to a bank
account and contracted
advertising, but has refused to tell
the ASSU exactly how much
money the publication has,
according to Olivieri.
To make up for the apparent
deficit, Live Oak is "looking into
the possibility" of seeking a
refundable $1 ASSU fee
assessment in the fall, Olivieri
said.
Weinstein suggested Sunday
that Live Oak would print a few
issues with their starting capital to
give students "a crystallized idea"
of the publication's format and
contents, according to Olivieri.
Weinstein maintained that these
issues would help the community

decide "objectively" whether to
support Live Oak in a fee
assessment election, Olivieri
commented.
"I was [and] still am against
the idea of Live Oak going to the
students for a fee assessment
because it has no track record,"
he maintained.
Olivieri cited a precedent in the
Public Interest Research Group
(PIRG), an organization which, he
said, waited "one full year"
before seeking a student
assessment.
He denied he was making Live
Oak "a unique case" in requiring
Live Oak to raise outside funds
before allowing Pub Board aid.
He also denied he was
overstepping his legal authority as
financial manager by interceding
in Live Oak's finances.
"What I'm afraid of really is
that we're going to have another
Chaparral problem child.
"I'm trying to restructure and
reorganize the Publications Board
so that we eliminate publications
that are apt to get into the
red ...he said.
Olivieri's latest decision for the
Chaparral is to let that publication
fall into receivership.
The financial manager said he
conferred yesterday morning by
long distance with Pub Board
Chairman Rich Jaroslovsky, who
suggested the idea. They decided
that the Chappie could then be
offered to a "responsible" group
to reorganize. The Chaparral
would suspend publication
briefly.
Olivieri said he has already had
at least two offers to take the
financially ailing publication over,

one by Quad publisher Mason
Blacher.
Pub Board approval is required,
however, and Olivieri said the
issue would be resolved finally in
October. Two members of the
Hammer and Coffin Society,
owners and official publishers of
the Chaparral, indicated last night
they would fight a Pub Board
takeover of the Chappie.
