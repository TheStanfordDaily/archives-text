# Exhibit At Weinberg Gallery
## Imagination Sparks Francisco's Art 
### KENNETH WAHL 
SAN FRANCISCO - Presently
there are a series of art shows in
San Francisco under the caption
"Introductions '74." The major
contemporary art dealers have
gotten together to introduce
young artists who haven't had
much exposure to the gallery
scene.
As one can imagine there are
several degrees of talent — from
mediocre to excellent — among
the various artists being
introduced to the public.
Therefore it is worthwhile to
bring attention to those artists
who are truly outstanding such as
Richard Francisco.
At the Daniel Weinberg
Gallery, 560 Sutter St., Francisco
is exhibiting watercolors and
constructions, through the end of
July. Francisco's works are
personal conceptions rationalized
and made to appear as isolated
phenomena, so ordered that one is
convinced that the artist is in full
control of these phenomena.
Yet it is difficult for the viewer
to penetrate the rationale behind
most of the work, though he
knows it's there. This is exactly
what makes the works so
successful. The viewer must
grapple with each image and use
his imagination to arrive at
problems similar to those the
artist has dealt with.
The difficulties that occur
often in Francisco's work involve
the polemics of form, color,
space, and the function of the art
object. Besides watercolor, he uses
balsa wood, thread, plaster, cord,
canvas and other materials to
formulate statements that
exemplify a problem and attempt
to solve it.

Francisco uses materials
reminiscent of those used by the
California based "Funk" artists,
the best known of whom is
William T. Wiley. In fact,
Francisco is a native of California,
but his studio is in New York
City. Because his work has a
mysterious subjective quality
inherent in all of Funk Art,
Francisco seems to fit under this
heading.
But there is more to it than
that. While the Funk artists
present their ideas without feeling
any need to rationalize them,
Francisco demonstrates a need to
control and justify each idea with
an ordered display of images.
In the construction "Land of
Enchantment" Francisco has
assembled four crooked sticks in
the form of a square; each stick
has a cord of myriad colors
wrapped tightly around it. The
sticks take on the appearance of
four spectrums of color relating to
each other through the
interrelationship of the square
form. At the same time the sticks,
because they are crooked, define
an ambiguous amount of space
within the square.
"Urban Compass" is another
construction of sticks, in a grid
formation paralleled horizontally
and vertically by white thread.
The construction is neatly
suspended within a box so that it
appears as a fence subtly
separating the viewer from the
space behind it.
Two constructions, "Studio
Stairway" and "untitled, 1974"
metaphysically rationalize the act
of making the art object, in this
case painting, and the relevance of
the object to the world around it.
"Studio Stairway" is a box

construction made of a piece of
balsa wood suspended above an
environment of paddle wheel-like
projections imbedded in plaster,
marble paper designs framed by
imaginary window beams, and a
background of fading darkness.
On the balsa wood are a series
of different colored forms,
representing paint pails
progressing towards the top of the

box. Just as the artist, before
starting to paint, must first enter
the studio by the stairway, he
must also start with the pure color
of the paint pails.
The second construction,
"untitled, 1974," deals with the
same theme. The box is divided
into two compartments; from the
first extends a pole which
penetrates the dividing wall into a
scene of floating paint pails and

brushes dancing orderly in a sea of
plaster. The atmosphere is that of
a Walt Disney film where
inanimate objects take on a will of
their own.
Richard Francisco's show is an
experience made both of
imagination and for the
imagination. His works have a
presence, in spite of their small
scale, that forces the viewer into
the artist's subjective world.

STUDIO STAIRWAY—That's the title of this construction by Richard Francisco. Francisco's water colors
and constructions will continue through July at the Daniel Weinberg Gallery, 560 Sutter St., San
Francisco.
