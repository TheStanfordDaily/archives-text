# Recruits To Help Card Track Team
## 
### 
Stanford's long-suffering track
coach, Payton Jordan, has landed
several recruits who could help
the Cardinals climb from the
Pacific Eight conference cellar.
Jordan announced the signing
of three 1974 California state
champions from the high school
and junior college ranks last week.
One of these, James Lofton,
the high school long jump champ,
previously signed a letter of intent
to play football for the Cards, but
he'll be at least as valuable to the
track team.
Lofton, from Washington High
School in Los Angeles, is state
high school long jump champion.
His best mark was 24-9'/2 in
winning the Golden West
Invitational. He had also triple
jumped 48-1, high jumped 6-4 and
run a 47.8 440. Both his long
jump and triple jump top marks
would be among the top 10 in
Stanford history.
JC transfer Robert Flint set the
state JC pole vault record with a
16-6V4 this spring. Flint, who
comes here from Fresno City
College, is only one-half inch from
recording a mark that would tie
for second of Stanford's all-time
pole vault list.

A third state champion is
quartermiler Alan Sheats, who ran
a leg on the winning prep state
championship relay team of John
Muir High School in Pasadena. His
best 40 time is 47.6, only
one-tenth of a second away from
making the Cards' all-time top 10.
Another star JC transfer is
John Foster from nearby Foothill
College. Foster has clocked a 14.1
in the 120 highs, close to the best
of Dave Bagshaw, Stanford's star
high hurdler this past year.
Lofton, Flint and Sheets all
have marks in their best events
which are better than any
Stanford athlete who competed
last year.
Other recruits include
two-miler Stacy Geiken of
Cubberley High School in Palo
Alto, who has posted a 9:11;
Mark Hadley from Napa, with a
1:52.6 half mile; and George
Marion from Livermore, who has
triple jumped 46-2.
Jordan called the group of
recruits "the finest we've had in
some time. Several of these
athletes are of Pacific Eight
calibre and should help us right
away."

Invitational. He had also triple
jumped 48-1, high jumped 6-4 and
run a 47.8 440. Both his long
jump and triple jump top marks
would be among the top 10 in
Stanford history.
JC transfer Robert Flint set the
state JC pole vault record with a
16-6V4 this spring. Flint, who
comes here from Fresno City
College, is only one-half inch from
recording a mark that would tie
for second of Stanford's all-time
pole vault list.

A third state champion is
quartermiler Alan Sheats, who ran
a leg on the winning prep state
championship relay team of John
Muir High School in Pasadena. His
best 40 time is 47.6, only
one-tenth of a second away from
making the Cards' all-time top 10.
Another star JC transfer is
John Foster from nearby Foothill
College. Foster has clocked a 14.1
in the 120 highs, close to the best
of Dave Bagshaw, Stanford's star
high hurdler this past year.
Lofton, Flint and Sheets all
have marks in their best events
which are better than any
Stanford athlete who competed
last year.
Other recruits include
two-miler Stacy Geiken of
Cubberley High School in Palo
Alto, who has posted a 9:11;
Mark Hadley from Napa, with a
1:52.6 half mile; and George
Marion from Livermore, who has
triple jumped 46-2.
Jordan called the group of
recruits "the finest we've had in
some time. Several of these
athletes are of Pacific Eight
calibre and should help us right
away."
