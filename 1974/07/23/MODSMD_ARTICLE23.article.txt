Panel Democrats To Present Bill
WASHINGTON — The Democratic members of the
House Judiciary Committee have decided to present a
ready-made bill of impeachment to the full panel when it
meets tomorrow.
Two members of the panel said that the Democrats
would seek the impeachment of President Nixon on three
separate articles: obstruction of justice in the Watergate
case, abuse of Presidential powers and contempt of
Congress for refusing to obey subpoenas.
The three measures will be submitted one at a time,
with the strongest being presented first, the members said.
The first vote could come on Thursday or Friday.
The debate will be televised live, the panel decided
yesterday. ABC will broadcast tomorrow's hearings, with
CBS and NBC following in rotation.
The Democratic majority on the panel also rejected the
proposal of White House lawyer James St. Clair that he be
allowed to take part in the debate. Indications were that
St. Clair would have no voice at all in the discussions.
St. Clair conferred with Nixon at the California White
House for most of yesterday, and subsequently held a
news conference.
He said that "if reviewed objectively," the evidence will
not warrant a pro-impeachment recommendation.
The White House attorney refused to speculate on
whether Nixon would comply with a Supreme Court order
to release more tapes. He said he would not comment
because the case is pending before the high court, which
could rule this week.
Meanwhile, the committee's Republican counsel, Sam
Garrison, told the panel it should decide whether to
impeach on the basis of what is best for the country rather
than on Nixon's guilt. Garrison replaced Albert E. Jenner
Jr. as minority counsel Sunday.
Garrison warned that impeachment is not warranted
just so that a Senate trial, which could clear Nixon, would
take place.
Cyprus Cease-Fire Takes Effect
ATHENS — A tentative cease-fire between Greece and
•♦Turkey on the island of Cyprus went into effect yesterday
afternoon.
Initial reports indicated that the cease-fire, engineered

by U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, was holding,
though some early violations were reported.
The cease-fire took effect at 4 p.m. yesterday in Cyprus
(7 a.m. PDT). Fighting continued until sundown.
Turkish jets were alleged to have bombed a resort hotel
and a Greek Cypriot artillery battery around the time of
the deadline.
Meanwhile, Greece, Turkey and Britain made plans to
open peace talks tomorrow in Geneva, Switzerland. British
Foreign Secretary James Callaghan announced in London
that the three governments had agreed to negotiate after
consultations with Kissinger.
A key issue in the talks will be whether Archbishop
Makarios is restored to the presidency. Makarios, in
Washington, said he was "very optimistic" constitutional
order would be restored.
Another issue concerns ways of safeguarding the rights
of both the Greek and Turkish communities on the island.
Almost all American citizens in Cyprus have been
evacuated by U.S. helicopters.
The British Royal Air Force also airlifted thousands of
refugees to England. The refugees, of many nationalities,
said they saw many bodies littering the streets of Nicosia,
the Cypriot capital.
At the time of the cease-fire, Turkey controlled the
Turkish portion of the capital city as well as a key road
leading to the sea. The government of Nikos Sampson,
which overthrew Makarios a week ago, remained in power
in the rest of the island, which is about half the size of
New Jersey.
Former Senator Morse Dies
PORTLAND, Ore. — Former Sen. Wayne Morse,
D-Ore., one of the first critics of the Vietnam War, died
yesterday.
Morse, 73, had been suffering an infection of the
urinary tract, and had been hospitalized since Wednesday.
The former Senator, who served as both a Republican
and Democrat, was viewed as a maverick. He was one of
only two Senators who voted against the Tonkin Gulf
resolution in 1964. The resolution was used by Presidents
Johnson and Nixon to justify the legality of the Vietnam
operation.

Morse, who lost to Mark Hatfield in 1966, was
attempting a political comeback. He had won the
Democratic nomination for Senate, and would have run
against Robert Packwood in the fall.
Reinecke Reverses Testimony
WASHINGTON — California Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke
yesterday said he told John Mitchell in May, 1971, that
ITT had offered to help finance the 1972 Republican
convention.
Reinecke's statement, made at his perjury trial, reversed
his earlier sworn testimony to a state committee.
He is charged with lying to the Senate Judiciary
Committee when he said that he had not told Mitchell of
the ITT pledge until Sept. 1971. Reinecke said yesterday
he misunderstood the Senate panel's question.
In another case, Federal Judge Gerhard Gesell reversed
an earlier jury decision and overturned the conviction of
John Ehrlichman on one count of perjury.
Gesell found Ehrlichman not guilty of lying to the FBI.
But he let convictions on two other perjury counts, as well
as one count of conspiracy, stand.
Station Manager Citation Upheld
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal appeals court yesterday
upheld a grand jury's contempt citation against KPFK-FM
radio station manager Will Lewis.
Lewis refused to turn over to law enforcement agencies
a tape received from the Symbionese Liberation Army on
June 7. The court agreed with Lewis that his radio station
in North Hollywood was free to broadcast the tapes, but
affirmed that "the requests of the grand jury were entirely
legitimate and justified."
Lewis, 42, said he would soon decide whether to appeal
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
- He was imprisoned from June 19 to July 5 on the
contempt charge, before being released pending appeal by
Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas.
Today's Weather
Fair and hot through tomorrow, except for patchy low
clouds mornings. Highs today and tomorrow near 90, low
tonight in the upper 50s. Northwest winds up to 15 miles

urinary tract, and had been hospitalized since Wednesday.
The former Senator, who served as both a Republican
and Democrat, was viewed as a maverick. He was one of
only two Senators who voted against the Tonkin Gulf
resolution in 1964. The resolution was used by Presidents
Johnson and Nixon to justify the legality of the Vietnam
operation.

Morse, who lost to Mark Hatfield in 1966, was
attempting a political comeback. He had won the
Democratic nomination for Senate, and would have run
against Robert Packwood in the fall.
Reinecke Reverses Testimony
WASHINGTON — California Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke
yesterday said he told John Mitchell in May, 1971, that
ITT had offered to help finance the 1972 Republican
convention.
Reinecke's statement, made at his perjury trial, reversed
his earlier sworn testimony to a state committee.
He is charged with lying to the Senate Judiciary
Committee when he said that he had not told Mitchell of
the ITT pledge until Sept. 1971. Reinecke said yesterday
he misunderstood the Senate panel's question.
In another case, Federal Judge Gerhard Gesell reversed
an earlier jury decision and overturned the conviction of
John Ehrlichman on one count of perjury.
Gesell found Ehrlichman not guilty of lying to the FBI.
But he let convictions on two other perjury counts, as well
as one count of conspiracy, stand.
Station Manager Citation Upheld
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal appeals court yesterday
upheld a grand jury's contempt citation against KPFK-FM
radio station manager Will Lewis.
Lewis refused to turn over to law enforcement agencies
a tape received from the Symbionese Liberation Army on
June 7. The court agreed with Lewis that his radio station
in North Hollywood was free to broadcast the tapes, but
affirmed that "the requests of the grand jury were entirely
legitimate and justified."
Lewis, 42, said he would soon decide whether to appeal
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
- He was imprisoned from June 19 to July 5 on the
contempt charge, before being released pending appeal by
Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas.
Today's Weather
Fair and hot through tomorrow, except for patchy low
clouds mornings. Highs today and tomorrow near 90, low
tonight in the upper 50s. Northwest winds up to 15 miles

Panel Democrats To Present Bill
WASHINGTON — The Democratic members of the
House Judiciary Committee have decided to present a
ready-made bill of impeachment to the full panel when it
meets tomorrow.
Two members of the panel said that the Democrats
would seek the impeachment of President Nixon on three
separate articles: obstruction of justice in the Watergate
case, abuse of Presidential powers and contempt of
Congress for refusing to obey subpoenas.
The three measures will be submitted one at a time,
with the strongest being presented first, the members said.
The first vote could come on Thursday or Friday.
The debate will be televised live, the panel decided
yesterday. ABC will broadcast tomorrow's hearings, with
CBS and NBC following in rotation.
The Democratic majority on the panel also rejected the
proposal of White House lawyer James St. Clair that he be
allowed to take part in the debate. Indications were that
St. Clair would have no voice at all in the discussions.
St. Clair conferred with Nixon at the California White
House for most of yesterday, and subsequently held a
news conference.
He said that "if reviewed objectively," the evidence will
not warrant a pro-impeachment recommendation.
The White House attorney refused to speculate on
whether Nixon would comply with a Supreme Court order
to release more tapes. He said he would not comment
because the case is pending before the high court, which
could rule this week.
Meanwhile, the committee's Republican counsel, Sam
Garrison, told the panel it should decide whether to
impeach on the basis of what is best for the country rather
than on Nixon's guilt. Garrison replaced Albert E. Jenner
Jr. as minority counsel Sunday.
Garrison warned that impeachment is not warranted
just so that a Senate trial, which could clear Nixon, would
take place.
Cyprus Cease-Fire Takes Effect
ATHENS — A tentative cease-fire between Greece and
•♦Turkey on the island of Cyprus went into effect yesterday
afternoon.
Initial reports indicated that the cease-fire, engineered

by U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, was holding,
though some early violations were reported.
The cease-fire took effect at 4 p.m. yesterday in Cyprus
(7 a.m. PDT). Fighting continued until sundown.
Turkish jets were alleged to have bombed a resort hotel
and a Greek Cypriot artillery battery around the time of
the deadline.
Meanwhile, Greece, Turkey and Britain made plans to
open peace talks tomorrow in Geneva, Switzerland. British
Foreign Secretary James Callaghan announced in London
that the three governments had agreed to negotiate after
consultations with Kissinger.
A key issue in the talks will be whether Archbishop
Makarios is restored to the presidency. Makarios, in
Washington, said he was "very optimistic" constitutional
order would be restored.
Another issue concerns ways of safeguarding the rights
of both the Greek and Turkish communities on the island.
Almost all American citizens in Cyprus have been
evacuated by U.S. helicopters.
The British Royal Air Force also airlifted thousands of
refugees to England. The refugees, of many nationalities,
said they saw many bodies littering the streets of Nicosia,
the Cypriot capital.
At the time of the cease-fire, Turkey controlled the
Turkish portion of the capital city as well as a key road
leading to the sea. The government of Nikos Sampson,
which overthrew Makarios a week ago, remained in power
in the rest of the island, which is about half the size of
New Jersey.

to release more tapes. He said he would not comment
because the case is pending before the high court, which
could rule this week.
Meanwhile, the committee's Republican counsel, Sam
Garrison, told the panel it should decide whether to
impeach on the basis of what is best for the country rather
than on Nixon's guilt. Garrison replaced Albert E. Jenner
Jr. as minority counsel Sunday.
Garrison warned that impeachment is not warranted
just so that a Senate trial, which could clear Nixon, would
take place.
Cyprus Cease-Fire Takes Effect
ATHENS — A tentative cease-fire between Greece and
•♦Turkey on the island of Cyprus went into effect yesterday
afternoon.
Initial reports indicated that the cease-fire, engineered

by U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, was holding,
though some early violations were reported.
The cease-fire took effect at 4 p.m. yesterday in Cyprus
(7 a.m. PDT). Fighting continued until sundown.
Turkish jets were alleged to have bombed a resort hotel
and a Greek Cypriot artillery battery around the time of
the deadline.
Meanwhile, Greece, Turkey and Britain made plans to
open peace talks tomorrow in Geneva, Switzerland. British
Foreign Secretary James Callaghan announced in London
that the three governments had agreed to negotiate after
consultations with Kissinger.
A key issue in the talks will be whether Archbishop
Makarios is restored to the presidency. Makarios, in
Washington, said he was "very optimistic" constitutional
order would be restored.
Another issue concerns ways of safeguarding the rights
of both the Greek and Turkish communities on the island.
Almost all American citizens in Cyprus have been
evacuated by U.S. helicopters.
The British Royal Air Force also airlifted thousands of
refugees to England. The refugees, of many nationalities,
said they saw many bodies littering the streets of Nicosia,
the Cypriot capital.
At the time of the cease-fire, Turkey controlled the
Turkish portion of the capital city as well as a key road
leading to the sea. The government of Nikos Sampson,
which overthrew Makarios a week ago, remained in power
in the rest of the island, which is about half the size of
New Jersey.
Former Senator Morse Dies
PORTLAND, Ore. — Former Sen. Wayne Morse,
D-Ore., one of the first critics of the Vietnam War, died
yesterday.
Morse, 73, had been suffering an infection of the
urinary tract, and had been hospitalized since Wednesday.
The former Senator, who served as both a Republican
and Democrat, was viewed as a maverick. He was one of
only two Senators who voted against the Tonkin Gulf
resolution in 1964. The resolution was used by Presidents
Johnson and Nixon to justify the legality of the Vietnam
operation.

Morse, who lost to Mark Hatfield in 1966, was
attempting a political comeback. He had won the
Democratic nomination for Senate, and would have run
against Robert Packwood in the fall.
Reinecke Reverses Testimony
WASHINGTON — California Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke
yesterday said he told John Mitchell in May, 1971, that
ITT had offered to help finance the 1972 Republican
convention.
Reinecke's statement, made at his perjury trial, reversed
his earlier sworn testimony to a state committee.
He is charged with lying to the Senate Judiciary
Committee when he said that he had not told Mitchell of
the ITT pledge until Sept. 1971. Reinecke said yesterday
he misunderstood the Senate panel's question.
In another case, Federal Judge Gerhard Gesell reversed
an earlier jury decision and overturned the conviction of
John Ehrlichman on one count of perjury.
Gesell found Ehrlichman not guilty of lying to the FBI.
But he let convictions on two other perjury counts, as well
as one count of conspiracy, stand.
Station Manager Citation Upheld
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal appeals court yesterday
upheld a grand jury's contempt citation against KPFK-FM
radio station manager Will Lewis.
Lewis refused to turn over to law enforcement agencies
a tape received from the Symbionese Liberation Army on
June 7. The court agreed with Lewis that his radio station
in North Hollywood was free to broadcast the tapes, but
affirmed that "the requests of the grand jury were entirely
legitimate and justified."
Lewis, 42, said he would soon decide whether to appeal
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
- He was imprisoned from June 19 to July 5 on the
contempt charge, before being released pending appeal by
Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas.
Today's Weather
Fair and hot through tomorrow, except for patchy low
clouds mornings. Highs today and tomorrow near 90, low
tonight in the upper 50s. Northwest winds up to 15 miles
per hour.
Panel Democrats To Present Bill
WASHINGTON — The Democratic members of the
House Judiciary Committee have decided to present a
ready-made bill of impeachment to the full panel when it
meets tomorrow.
Two members of the panel said that the Democrats
would seek the impeachment of President Nixon on three
separate articles: obstruction of justice in the Watergate
case, abuse of Presidential powers and contempt of
Congress for refusing to obey subpoenas.
The three measures will be submitted one at a time,
with the strongest being presented first, the members said.
The first vote could come on Thursday or Friday.
The debate will be televised live, the panel decided
yesterday. ABC will broadcast tomorrow's hearings, with
CBS and NBC following in rotation.
The Democratic majority on the panel also rejected the
proposal of White House lawyer James St. Clair that he be
allowed to take part in the debate. Indications were that
St. Clair would have no voice at all in the discussions.
St. Clair conferred with Nixon at the California White
House for most of yesterday, and subsequently held a
news conference.
He said that "if reviewed objectively," the evidence will
not warrant a pro-impeachment recommendation.
The White House attorney refused to speculate on
whether Nixon would comply with a Supreme Court order
to release more tapes. He said he would not comment
because the case is pending before the high court, which
could rule this week.
