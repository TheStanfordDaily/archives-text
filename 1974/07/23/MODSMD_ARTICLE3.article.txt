# TMU Workers Oppose Switch To Fast Food

### VLAE KERSHNER 
Tresidder employees have
vowed to fight the proposed
switch of TMU cafeteria into a
fast food operation, a change they
view as imminent, United
Stanford Employees (USE)
President Jim Berk said last night.
One cafeteria worker said that
it was all but certain that TDS,
Inc., which manages the cafeteria,
would layoff 28 full-time and 23
student workers August 17, when
remodeling would begin.
Only a few of these workers
would be rehired when the
fast-food operation opened in
September, Berk said.
Some cafeteria workers
voluntarily belong to USE. The
union is seeking to become sole
bargaining agent for the TDS
workers in an election set for the
first week in August.
USE and TDS officials and
attorneys have conferred over the
remodeling issue. TDS officials
and employees will meet today at
an undisclosed time to discuss the

planned changes, Berk said.
Berk sharply criticized the
impending format switch.
"That such a change should be
solely in the hands of an outside
contractor is ridiculous. We don't
know what the agreement
between TDS and the University
is... .
"It may be that TDS has been
given the green light to open a
Jack-in-the-Box junk box in the
middle of campus and no one else
has anything to do with it," Berk
said.
TDS officials were not
available last night for comment.
Bob Caselli, TDS food service
manager, said last week that
continued operational and
financial problems could force a
change in format.
When TDS took over
management of the cafeteria in
June, 1973 from the University,
the operation was running
$240,000 in debt per year.
