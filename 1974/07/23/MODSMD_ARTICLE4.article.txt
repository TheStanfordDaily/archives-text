## Cyprus Conflict 
### 
At first glance, the peace-making efforts of the United States in
Cyprus seem to be worthy of applause.
No matter how fragile the cease-fire, it is well established that a
lasting peace cannot be attained while shooting continues. In this
context, it is obvious that the efforts of Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger are worthwhile.
But the United States cannot applaud the efforts of its state
department without also chastising its government for helping to
precipitate the Cypriot crisis.
It is our support of a repressive military dictatorship in Greece that
allows that government to thrive. It is with United States arms that
the Greek military can overthrow a lawful government in Cyprus as
well as keep home dissent stifled.
The Greek-engineered overthrow of the government of Archbishop
Makarios, and the installation of Nikos Sampson, who the New York
Times called "a psychopathic killer hated by all Turks," is
inexcusable.
The U.S. government should have immediately endorsed the
demand by Britain that the 650 officers who engineered the coup be
immediately removed.
Instead, the U.S.,for strategic reasons, virtually ignored the crisis.
The installation of a militant anti-communist seemed preferable to
our government to a call for a return to lawful, if left-leaning,
government.
Our judgment in the Cyprus affair was sadly reminiscent of our
support of Pakistan in the Bengali's fight for freedom two years ago.
The U.S. has shown less concern for democratic institutions in these
cases than has the world's biggest bully, the U.S.S.R.
This does not mean we condone Turkey's intervention. The Turks'
invasion was politically motivated and irresponsible.
It's just that we think the U.S. could do better if it considered its
own constitutional principles rather than narrow self interest when
acting in world affairs.
