As She Likes It
Editor:
In no way can I set myself up
as a critic, but I do know what I
like and dislike. The current
production of "The Company" of
Stanford's As You Like It is a
breath of fresh air.
As you sit in the center with
the other audience-participants,
munching on your Rye Krisp and
swallowing sardines — the director

comes over and talks to you,
while strumming on his dulcimer.
Clowns cavort on the periphery, a
"magpie" sings, and voila — you
are there in an Elizabethan village,
talking,laughing, sighing with uh
strangers, no, but with your
fellows of all ages, sexes, kinds.
Do remember though — the
next time — to take a loaf and a
bottle of wine to share with the
5,000.
