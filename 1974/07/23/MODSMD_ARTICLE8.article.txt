# Rights Not Well Protected
## 
### 
Tim Knaak

The Daily editorial of July 16 heralding a
"Justice Landmark" in the recent conviction of
Ehrlichman, Liddy and company is premature and
misleading. This case is a sorry example to support
the illusion that the Fourth Amendment and other
human rights are as well-upheld as they should be.
One cannot disagree that these convictions are
called for, indeed overdue, but they do not go far
enough.
I am not only referring to the continued
freedom of Mr. Nixon, who uses the same paltry
excuse of national security, a fact your editorial
fails to note. Nor am I thinking only of the
country-club prisons where the four new convicts
will join their co-conspirators. But Krogh and
Segretti have already been released.
One can imagine how much the golf course at
Lompoc and the tennis courts at Allentown will do
to reform these gentlemen. [This in no way
condones the dehumanization (rightly described by
Professor Zimbardo) which is the lot of the lower
classes and minorities sent to harsher,
non-white-collar prisons.]
The Fourth Amendment is a strange one to
proclaim safe-guarded when the Supreme Court has
ruled that police can search a vehicle for evidence
of unrelated infractions after stopping it for a real
or alleged traffic violation.
This same court has also ruled that the Bank
Security Act is constitutional. The name of this law
goes beyond euphemism to being the exact
opposite of its intent. All bank records of
individuals are open to government inspection and
all checks over $100 must be reported.
Another Case
But more important is the fact that Watergate is
only the most infamous of the political
machinations and crimes of the Nixon
administration, which only carried the long-used
repression of small parties critical of the
government to its logical extreme. There is a
less-publicized case now before the courts
concerning this matter.
Through independent actions by reporter Carl
Stern, various documents have been released which
indicate the extent of this repression. The FBI
program COINTELPRO was designed to "expose,
disrupt, misdirect or otherwise neutralize" the
activities of specified dissident political groups. The
need to "prevent these groups from converting
young people" is especially emphasized.
One means used was the release of information,
including "documents subtly incorporating false
information, and entirely fabricated documents,"
through the "cooperation of reliable news media"
who would not reveal their sources. Other

documents released by Senator Lowell Weicker
reveal the use of the Internal Revenue Service to
intimidate dissidents.
Other Means
Not listed in these documents are other means
such as agents provacateurs, illegal confiscation of
records and bombings (even the office of the
Political Rights Defense Fund, prosecuting the case,
was subject to a bomb attack).
The government has already admitted the use of
phone taps and mail coverage. The latter method
came to light after attempted FBI intimidation of a
high school girl who had written to a black-listed
organization as part of a civics course. This follows
a familiar pattern of intimidation through FBI
contacts with employers, landlords, etc., warning of
the supposed dangerous nature of those
investigated.
Most potentially incriminatory is a section in the
documents on the need to "prevent the rise of a
[black] 'messiah.' " As elsewhere, relevant names
are deleted, although the program is supposedly
defunct. But the nature of the references and the
number of typewriter-spaces missing leave some
identifications unmistakable.
The one who "could have been such a
'messiah' " and who is "martyr of the movement
today" is obviously Malcolm X. The "very real
contender for this position should he abandon his
supposed .. . nonviolence" is just as clearly Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. James Earl Ray, King's
assassin, is now asking for a retrial, claiming there
was a conspiracy. Prison officials are seeking to
transfer him to a federal prison where contact with
the press can be barred.
Beware of Rejoicing
If our government can engage in political
manipulations and support of coups, assassinations
and dictatorships abroad, why not at home? We
should beware of rejoicing in the minor victories of
justice as if these allowed us to ignore the
investigation of remaining substantial violations of
political rights.
The court case mentioned above was initiated by
the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and has the
support of a great many organizations and
individuals, such as Daniel Ellsberg, who, while not
necessarily agreeing with the views of the SWP,
recognize that the denial of rights to any section of
society endangers the whole.

myself or by writing to the Political Rights Defense
Funds, PO Box 649 Cooper Station, New York, NY

The Daily editorial of July 16 heralding a
"Justice Landmark" in the recent conviction of
Ehrlichman, Liddy and company is premature and
misleading. This case is a sorry example to support
the illusion that the Fourth Amendment and other
human rights are as well-upheld as they should be.
One cannot disagree that these convictions are
called for, indeed overdue, but they do not go far
enough.
I am not only referring to the continued
freedom of Mr. Nixon, who uses the same paltry
excuse of national security, a fact your editorial
fails to note. Nor am I thinking only of the
country-club prisons where the four new convicts
will join their co-conspirators. But Krogh and
Segretti have already been released.
One can imagine how much the golf course at
Lompoc and the tennis courts at Allentown will do
to reform these gentlemen. [This in no way
condones the dehumanization (rightly described by
Professor Zimbardo) which is the lot of the lower
classes and minorities sent to harsher,
non-white-collar prisons.]
The Fourth Amendment is a strange one to
proclaim safe-guarded when the Supreme Court has
ruled that police can search a vehicle for evidence
of unrelated infractions after stopping it for a real
or alleged traffic violation.
This same court has also ruled that the Bank
Security Act is constitutional. The name of this law
goes beyond euphemism to being the exact
opposite of its intent. All bank records of
individuals are open to government inspection and
all checks over $100 must be reported.
Another Case
But more important is the fact that Watergate is
only the most infamous of the political
machinations and crimes of the Nixon
administration, which only carried the long-used
repression of small parties critical of the
government to its logical extreme. There is a
less-publicized case now before the courts
concerning this matter.
Through independent actions by reporter Carl
Stern, various documents have been released which
indicate the extent of this repression. The FBI
program COINTELPRO was designed to "expose,
disrupt, misdirect or otherwise neutralize" the
activities of specified dissident political groups. The
need to "prevent these groups from converting
young people" is especially emphasized.
One means used was the release of information,
including "documents subtly incorporating false
information, and entirely fabricated documents,"
through the "cooperation of reliable news media"
who would not reveal their sources. Other

documents released by Senator Lowell Weicker
reveal the use of the Internal Revenue Service to
intimidate dissidents.
Other Means
Not listed in these documents are other means
such as agents provacateurs, illegal confiscation of
records and bombings (even the office of the
Political Rights Defense Fund, prosecuting the case,
was subject to a bomb attack).
The government has already admitted the use of
phone taps and mail coverage. The latter method
came to light after attempted FBI intimidation of a
high school girl who had written to a black-listed
organization as part of a civics course. This follows
a familiar pattern of intimidation through FBI
contacts with employers, landlords, etc., warning of
the supposed dangerous nature of those
investigated.
Most potentially incriminatory is a section in the
documents on the need to "prevent the rise of a
[black] 'messiah.' " As elsewhere, relevant names
are deleted, although the program is supposedly
defunct. But the nature of the references and the
number of typewriter-spaces missing leave some
identifications unmistakable.
The one who "could have been such a
'messiah' " and who is "martyr of the movement
today" is obviously Malcolm X. The "very real
contender for this position should he abandon his
supposed .. . nonviolence" is just as clearly Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. James Earl Ray, King's
assassin, is now asking for a retrial, claiming there
was a conspiracy. Prison officials are seeking to
transfer him to a federal prison where contact with
the press can be barred.
Beware of Rejoicing
If our government can engage in political
manipulations and support of coups, assassinations
and dictatorships abroad, why not at home? We
should beware of rejoicing in the minor victories of
justice as if these allowed us to ignore the
investigation of remaining substantial violations of
political rights.

was a conspiracy. Prison officials are seeking to
transfer him to a federal prison where contact with
the press can be barred.
Beware of Rejoicing
If our government can engage in political
manipulations and support of coups, assassinations
and dictatorships abroad, why not at home? We
should beware of rejoicing in the minor victories of
justice as if these allowed us to ignore the
investigation of remaining substantial violations of
political rights.
The court case mentioned above was initiated by
the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and has the
support of a great many organizations and
individuals, such as Daniel Ellsberg, who, while not
necessarily agreeing with the views of the SWP,
recognize that the denial of rights to any section of
society endangers the whole.

myself or by writing to the Political Rights Defense
