# Pub Negotiations Broken Off — Starr

### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Negotiations on an operating
contract for an on-campus pub
serving beer and wine have broken
off, Tresidder Union Manager
Gordon Starr disclosed late last
week.
Disagreement on the written
contract between the University
and Guckenheimer, the food
service company, errupted three
weeks ago. The parties had
reached a verbal agreement in
April.
Starr would not say what the
problem is but Guckenheimer
president Dr. Stewart Ritchie said,
"The disagreement is on
numbers."
The University will now ask for
bids on the project from other
food service companies in the
area, according to Starr, but he
wouid not say when.
Bids In Four Weeks
Ritchie speculated that the
University would begin accepting
bids on the project within four
weeks. He added that his
company could still get the
contract if his bid is the best.
Only one other food service
company, Interstate United, has
contacted the University about
the pub so far, according to Starr.
Bob Brady, sales manager for
Interstate United, said that he
spoke with Starr last week and
was "very interested" in the
proposed pub.
Starr said three other
companies might be interested in
the project: Tougas Enterprises,
which operates The Oasis in Palo
Alto, TTie Wine Cellar in Los
Gatos and the Garret in Campbell;
Saga Food Service in Menlo Park;
and ARA Services which operates
the food service at the University
of San Francisco and the pub
there.
Fourth Operation
Scott Piersol, general manager
for Tougas Enterprises, said that
his company is "looking around
for a fourth operation." However,

he warned that no matter what his
company takes on, "We'd want to
do it our way. We'd never want to
get into anything where we were
dictated to."
The University has said it
wants to maintain as much
control over the project as
possible, according to Starr.
Gene Pucinelli, District
Manager for Saga Food Service,
spoke a little more pessimistically
about the pub's prospects:
"I'm familiar with the pub at
the University of San Francisco.
The word is that since USF has a
liquor license, other universities
might have a chance. But that
may not be true."
Pucinelli pointed out that the
burden of the liquor license —
making sure the law is obeyed — is
firmly on officials at USF. He said
that the Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control (ABC) has
placed many restrictions on that
pub's operations, which "make it
very difficult to make a profit."
Identification
Currently, USF's pub is
monitored by a full-time checker.
Customers must provide two
forms of identification, one with a
picture. The identification is also
studied under ultraviolet light.
Puccinelli added that officials
at the University of California at
Irvine had tried to secure a liquor
license, but failed because state
law will not allow liquor to be
sold on State school property.
Puccinelli also said that St.
Mary's College had failed so far in
its attempt to get a liquor license.
Saga handles St. Mary's food
service.
Even though other schools had
had little success in acquiring a
liquor license, Puccinelli said he is
interested in the proposed pub
here, but would wait until the
University contacted him before
doing anything.
No spokesman for ARA
services could be reached for
comment.
