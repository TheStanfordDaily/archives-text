# Extensive Remodeling Planned For TMU
## 
### DON COX VLAE KERSHNER 
University officials are
currently formulating extensive
plans for the renovation and
modification of Tresidder
Memorial Union (TMU), TMU
General Manager Gordon Starr
said Wednesday.
The University has decided to
close Tresidder cafeteria August
17 for financial reasons, initially
replacing it with a fast-food
format. Other changes, which
include addition of a number of
new shops within the union, have
been planned but details have not
been finalized.
The remodelling is expected to
cost between $50,000 and
$250,000. The University may
share the bill with other vendors
or companies involved, Starr said.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said the University has
been forced to make changes due
to continued losses. "It is costing
us too many tuition dollars to
finance it. We cannot have a
Cadillac when we can hardly
afford a Vega."
Tresidder has run $1.3 million
into debt in the past six years,
with the cafeteria accounting for
most of the losses.
TDS Hired
The University hired Toute de
Suite, Incorporated (TDS, Inc.),

to manage the cafeteria last year
after losing $300,000 at Tresidder
in 1972. Starr said the deficit for
last year was $100,000.
"Analysis has indicated that
unless we make substantial
changes, we will continue with a
$100,000 deficit indefinitely,"
Starr said. "The University is
under extreme financial pressure.
We have received a mandate from
a University budgetary group to
break even by May 1975."
General plans for Tresidder
include introducing a fast-food
format in September, which TDS
would manage, Starr said.
Revised Menu
TDS Food Services Manager
Bob Caselli said the new format
would feature a" small and
standardized menu. Tentative
plans indicate that coffee and
doughnuts will be served in the
morning. Hamburgers, hot dogs
and similar items will be available
from 11 a.m. until 7:30 p.m.,
Caselli said.
TDS's other operations on
campus, Encina Snack Bar, TMU
Coffee House, a catering service
and a football training table, will
not be affected, CAselli said.
TDS and University officials
will study the new format, Lyons
said. "What we have in September
may not be what we'll have in
February, or the next

September."
TDS' plans to open a fast-food
restaurant are based on a survey
made by Sterling Resources
International during the spring.
The survey showed "a strong
desire for fast food," in the
community, Caselli said.
Some TDS workers, however,
questioned the validity of the
survey and criticized the proposed
changes.
"They [TDS] don't give a
damn about service," Dean
Morris, a student worker, said.
"They just want to cut the work

force so low they can make a
profit."
About 50 persons now work at
the cafeteria. Caselli said that "as
of right now, we are overstaffed."
After the conversion to fast food,
"more than half" of the workers
would not be rehired, he said.
Meeting
Representatives of TDS
management, the University and
the employees met Tuesday to
discuss the planned changes and
impending layoffs.
At the meeting, Lyons said
"the University does not exist to

provide employment to people."
Neither does it guarantee
University jobs for TDS workers if
they are laid off, he said.
Another meeting is set for
early next week.
The University plans to give
preferential treatment for jobs to
all TDS workers who were
University employees prior to the
June, 1973 switchover.

for early August) a preferential
hiring clause will go into effect as
part of the USE-University
contract of June.
The fast-food format will take
less space in Tresidder than the
cafeteria does, Starr said.
Extra space will be partitioned
off and used for shops. A plant
shop, laundry service, printing
shop, ice cream franchise, space
for the ASSU lecture note service
and a beauty shop may be
included in the space, Starr said.
He emphasized that these
services were only under
consideration and that details
have not been finalized.
"We're really at an embryo
stage," Starr said.
In addition to the cafeteria

conversion, Tresidder
management is considering
scrapping four to six of the 14
bowling lanes and half of the
billiards room. This space might
be used for a sportswear shop or
expansion of the Stanford
Bookstore.
Starr said the major problem
with the union is "the utilization
of space — a lot of it is wasted."

He noted that Tresidder was
poorly laid out. It is "outward
directed," with no central core to
unify the building.
He hoped that changes would
give the union a more friendly
atmosphere.
"We will try to tie all of this
into a unified theme, hopefully
making this whole place less
austere," he said.

General Manager Gordon Starr
said Wednesday.
The University has decided to
close Tresidder cafeteria August
17 for financial reasons, initially
replacing it with a fast-food
format. Other changes, which
include addition of a number of
new shops within the union, have
been planned but details have not
been finalized.
The remodelling is expected to
cost between $50,000 and
$250,000. The University may
share the bill with other vendors
or companies involved, Starr said.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said the University has
been forced to make changes due
to continued losses. "It is costing
us too many tuition dollars to
finance it. We cannot have a
Cadillac when we can hardly
afford a Vega."
Tresidder has run $1.3 million
into debt in the past six years,
with the cafeteria accounting for
most of the losses.
TDS Hired
The University hired Toute de
Suite, Incorporated (TDS, Inc.),

to manage the cafeteria last year
after losing $300,000 at Tresidder
in 1972. Starr said the deficit for
last year was $100,000.
"Analysis has indicated that
unless we make substantial
changes, we will continue with a
$100,000 deficit indefinitely,"
Starr said. "The University is
under extreme financial pressure.
We have received a mandate from
a University budgetary group to
break even by May 1975."
General plans for Tresidder
include introducing a fast-food
format in September, which TDS
would manage, Starr said.
Revised Menu
TDS Food Services Manager
Bob Caselli said the new format
would feature a" small and
standardized menu. Tentative
plans indicate that coffee and
doughnuts will be served in the
morning. Hamburgers, hot dogs
and similar items will be available
from 11 a.m. until 7:30 p.m.,
Caselli said.
TDS's other operations on
campus, Encina Snack Bar, TMU
Coffee House, a catering service
and a football training table, will
not be affected, CAselli said.
TDS and University officials
will study the new format, Lyons
said. "What we have in September
may not be what we'll have in
February, or the next

September."
TDS' plans to open a fast-food
restaurant are based on a survey
made by Sterling Resources
International during the spring.
The survey showed "a strong
desire for fast food," in the
community, Caselli said.
Some TDS workers, however,
questioned the validity of the
survey and criticized the proposed
changes.
"They [TDS] don't give a
damn about service," Dean
Morris, a student worker, said.
"They just want to cut the work

force so low they can make a
profit."
About 50 persons now work at
the cafeteria. Caselli said that "as
of right now, we are overstaffed."
After the conversion to fast food,
"more than half" of the workers
would not be rehired, he said.
Meeting
Representatives of TDS
management, the University and
the employees met Tuesday to
discuss the planned changes and
impending layoffs.
At the meeting, Lyons said
"the University does not exist to

provide employment to people."
Neither does it guarantee
University jobs for TDS workers if
they are laid off, he said.
Another meeting is set for
early next week.
The University plans to give
preferential treatment for jobs to
all TDS workers who were
University employees prior to the
June, 1973 switchover.

for early August) a preferential
hiring clause will go into effect as
part of the USE-University
contract of June.
The fast-food format will take
less space in Tresidder than the
cafeteria does, Starr said.
Extra space will be partitioned
off and used for shops. A plant
shop, laundry service, printing
shop, ice cream franchise, space
for the ASSU lecture note service
and a beauty shop may be
included in the space, Starr said.
He emphasized that these
services were only under
consideration and that details
have not been finalized.
"We're really at an embryo
stage," Starr said.
In addition to the cafeteria

conversion, Tresidder
management is considering
scrapping four to six of the 14
bowling lanes and half of the
billiards room. This space might
be used for a sportswear shop or
expansion of the Stanford
Bookstore.
Starr said the major problem
with the union is "the utilization
of space — a lot of it is wasted."

He noted that Tresidder was
poorly laid out. It is "outward
directed," with no central core to
unify the building.
He hoped that changes would
give the union a more friendly
atmosphere.
"We will try to tie all of this
into a unified theme, hopefully
making this whole place less
austere," he said.

replacing it with a fast-food
format. Other changes, which
include addition of a number of
new shops within the union, have
been planned but details have not
been finalized.
The remodelling is expected to
cost between $50,000 and
$250,000. The University may
share the bill with other vendors
or companies involved, Starr said.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said the University has
been forced to make changes due
to continued losses. "It is costing
us too many tuition dollars to
finance it. We cannot have a
Cadillac when we can hardly
afford a Vega."
Tresidder has run $1.3 million
into debt in the past six years,
with the cafeteria accounting for
most of the losses.
TDS Hired
The University hired Toute de
Suite, Incorporated (TDS, Inc.),

to manage the cafeteria last year
after losing $300,000 at Tresidder
in 1972. Starr said the deficit for
last year was $100,000.
"Analysis has indicated that
unless we make substantial
changes, we will continue with a
$100,000 deficit indefinitely,"
Starr said. "The University is
under extreme financial pressure.
We have received a mandate from
a University budgetary group to
break even by May 1975."
General plans for Tresidder
include introducing a fast-food
format in September, which TDS
would manage, Starr said.
Revised Menu
TDS Food Services Manager
Bob Caselli said the new format
would feature a" small and
standardized menu. Tentative
plans indicate that coffee and
doughnuts will be served in the
morning. Hamburgers, hot dogs
and similar items will be available
from 11 a.m. until 7:30 p.m.,
Caselli said.
TDS's other operations on
campus, Encina Snack Bar, TMU
Coffee House, a catering service
and a football training table, will
not be affected, CAselli said.
TDS and University officials
will study the new format, Lyons
said. "What we have in September
may not be what we'll have in
February, or the next

September."
TDS' plans to open a fast-food
restaurant are based on a survey
made by Sterling Resources
International during the spring.
The survey showed "a strong
desire for fast food," in the
community, Caselli said.
Some TDS workers, however,
questioned the validity of the
survey and criticized the proposed
changes.
"They [TDS] don't give a
damn about service," Dean
Morris, a student worker, said.
"They just want to cut the work

force so low they can make a
profit."
About 50 persons now work at
the cafeteria. Caselli said that "as
of right now, we are overstaffed."
After the conversion to fast food,
"more than half" of the workers
would not be rehired, he said.
Meeting
Representatives of TDS
management, the University and
the employees met Tuesday to
discuss the planned changes and
impending layoffs.
At the meeting, Lyons said
"the University does not exist to

provide employment to people."
Neither does it guarantee
University jobs for TDS workers if
they are laid off, he said.
Another meeting is set for
early next week.
The University plans to give
preferential treatment for jobs to
all TDS workers who were
University employees prior to the
June, 1973 switchover.

for early August) a preferential
hiring clause will go into effect as
part of the USE-University
contract of June.
The fast-food format will take
less space in Tresidder than the
cafeteria does, Starr said.
Extra space will be partitioned
off and used for shops. A plant
shop, laundry service, printing
shop, ice cream franchise, space
for the ASSU lecture note service
and a beauty shop may be
included in the space, Starr said.
He emphasized that these
services were only under
consideration and that details
have not been finalized.
"We're really at an embryo
stage," Starr said.
In addition to the cafeteria

conversion, Tresidder
management is considering
scrapping four to six of the 14
bowling lanes and half of the
billiards room. This space might
be used for a sportswear shop or
expansion of the Stanford
Bookstore.
Starr said the major problem
with the union is "the utilization
of space — a lot of it is wasted."

He noted that Tresidder was
poorly laid out. It is "outward
directed," with no central core to
unify the building.
He hoped that changes would
give the union a more friendly
atmosphere.
"We will try to tie all of this
into a unified theme, hopefully
making this whole place less
austere," he said.
University officials are
currently formulating extensive
plans for the renovation and
modification of Tresidder
Memorial Union (TMU), TMU

said Wednesday.
