# Thai Needs Two Visas To Visit
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN News Analysis 
Although South Vietnamese
journalist and architect Nguyen
Huu Thai has accepted the
invitation to be ASSU guest
professor, he still has not acquired
an exit visa from Vietnam and an
entrance visa to the United States.
Until Thai receives these visas,
he will be unable to come here in
September.
Efforts have begun on both
fronts to attain the visas,
according to Jim Regan, member
of the Committee to Bring
Nguyen Huu Thai to Stanford.
The most important, and
certainly hardest to attain, will be
the exit visa. In a letter sent to
ASSU President Mike Herman
earlier this month. Thai wrote
that he was "in a state of
semi-house arrest.. . waiting for a

dangerous assignment by the
Army to an outpost."
Regan said Thai needs to
obtain an identification card, a
passport and then an exit visa in
order to leave Vietnam.
Jail Term
This may be very difficult
considering Thai's past and his
likely actions once he is released.
Thai was jailed in the early 1960s
"for a total of about four years"
because of his activities with the
peace movement according to a
background sheet from Regan.
Thai was released from jail in
1969 on the condition that he
enter the army; he became a
captain but continued writing
"articles of dissent," it said. In
October, 1972, he was arrested on
a charge of involvement in the
murder of a certrist politician.
Though he was never formally

charged nor put on trial, Thai
remained jailed under preventive
detention until April of this year
when he was put under house
arrest.
These credentials certainly do
not merit the applause of the
regime of President Nguyen Huu
Thieu. Neither does the possibility
of Thai's speaking on the situation
of South Vietnamese political
prisoners once in the United
States.
'Quiet Inquiries'
As for the entrance visa, Regan
said "Thai wants us to proceed
with quiet inquiries" to find out
how to obtain one. "He does not
want us to make it a big public
issue," Regan noted because "to
do so may have adverse affects."
Regan added that "we had
stopped things" but have begun
checking into attaining an

entrance visa because Thai "wants
us to be ready" if he gets his visa.
Herman said that he would
send a letter to the State
Department on behalf of the
student body, attempting to
receive any possible help there.
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,
R—Menlo Park, may also be asked
to help, Regan said. McCloskey
originally endorsed the efforts to
invite Thai here as a guest
professor.
The student body voted in
April to invite Thai here to
Stanford. At the same time
students voted to assess
themselves one dollar each to
fund the guest professorship
program.

Nguyen Huu Thai
Although South Vietnamese
journalist and architect Nguyen
Huu Thai has accepted the
invitation to be ASSU guest
professor, he still has not acquired
an exit visa from Vietnam and an
entrance visa to the United States.
Until Thai receives these visas,
he will be unable to come here in
September.
Efforts have begun on both
fronts to attain the visas,
according to Jim Regan, member
of the Committee to Bring
Nguyen Huu Thai to Stanford.
The most important, and
certainly hardest to attain, will be
the exit visa. In a letter sent to
ASSU President Mike Herman
earlier this month. Thai wrote
that he was "in a state of
semi-house arrest.. . waiting for a

dangerous assignment by the
Army to an outpost."
Regan said Thai needs to
obtain an identification card, a
passport and then an exit visa in
order to leave Vietnam.
Jail Term
This may be very difficult
considering Thai's past and his
likely actions once he is released.
Thai was jailed in the early 1960s
"for a total of about four years"
because of his activities with the
peace movement according to a
background sheet from Regan.
Thai was released from jail in
1969 on the condition that he
enter the army; he became a
captain but continued writing
"articles of dissent," it said. In
October, 1972, he was arrested on
a charge of involvement in the
murder of a certrist politician.
Though he was never formally

charged nor put on trial, Thai
remained jailed under preventive
detention until April of this year
when he was put under house
arrest.
These credentials certainly do
not merit the applause of the
regime of President Nguyen Huu
Thieu. Neither does the possibility
of Thai's speaking on the situation
of South Vietnamese political
prisoners once in the United
States.
'Quiet Inquiries'
As for the entrance visa, Regan
said "Thai wants us to proceed
with quiet inquiries" to find out
how to obtain one. "He does not
want us to make it a big public
issue," Regan noted because "to
do so may have adverse affects."
Regan added that "we had
stopped things" but have begun
checking into attaining an

entrance visa because Thai "wants
us to be ready" if he gets his visa.
Herman said that he would
send a letter to the State
Department on behalf of the
student body, attempting to
receive any possible help there.
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,
R—Menlo Park, may also be asked
to help, Regan said. McCloskey
originally endorsed the efforts to
invite Thai here as a guest
professor.
The student body voted in
April to invite Thai here to
Stanford. At the same time
students voted to assess
themselves one dollar each to
fund the guest professorship
program.
