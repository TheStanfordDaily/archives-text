# Alexander Technique's Goal: Behavior Control
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
"A healthy mind in a healthy body."
That has been a general motto in the
American education system for years. And
now, two former teachers are doing
something about the concept.
Edward and Linda Avak are teachers at
the Palo Alto Center for the F.M.
Alexander Technique, a method of
developing control over behavior.
"The goal is movement with less
effort," explains Avak. "You can feel
lighter and have more freedom of
movement."
The technique is an attempt to
eliminate bad postural habits which usually
bring on tension, resulting in headaches,
backaches, and more serious problems. It
was discovered by Shakespearean actor F.
Mathias Alexander 70 years ago in Sydney,
Australia.
Voice Problem
The young actor kept losing his voice,
always while on stage. By speaking at
home, before a mirror, Alexander noticed a
tendency to pull his head backward and
downward, creating tensions which might
be inhibiting his voice. By adjusting these
unnecessary movements, he gradually
cured his problem.
At first considered a pseudo-medical
treatment or a meditation philosophy, his

techniques gradually gained acceptance by
performers, educators, philosophers and
writers. Alexander taught his methods to
Aldous Huxley, George Bernard Shaw and
John Dewey.
Dewey, a profound believer, once said it
was "the new direction needed in
education."
More recently, 1973 Nobel Prize winner
Nikolas Tinbergen, a physiologist,
recommended the technique "as an
extremely sophisticated form of
rehabilitation." Tinbergen devoted over
half of his acceptance speech to praise of
Alexander's method.
Not A Treatment
The Alexander Technique is neither a
treatment nor an exercise. It is taught, with
the instructor guiding the student's
movement with his hands.
Instruction is in three stages. Avak first
has the student demonstrate simple
maneuvers, such as sitting, rising and
waling. Watching the student, he can
analyze typical bad habits.
The second stage consists of inhibiting
those bad habits. The student becomes
acutely aware of his tendencies, as the
teacher guides every movement.
The third step is to practice the better
patterns of motion, by mastering control
of what the student might have thought

were "involuntary" actions.
"We are interested in distributing
tension more evenly throughout the
body," says Avak. "We don't want a limp
body, but a relaxed one, soothed and ready
for action."
He explained that when tension is
evenly distributed, rather than
concentrated in small areas, there is less
stress, both mentally and physically.
"Any physical change affects your
mentality. You can't have a positive
outlook if your body is saying 'I'm
defeated.'"
Mrs. Avak recounts that many students
who come to them complaining of
frequent headaches feel victimized "until
they realize they can stop them. It's a very
liberating feeling."
Training Center
The Avaks became interested in the
Alexander Technique while in London,
where the training center is. Both former
high school teachers, they had become
more and more dissatisfied with their
work. Traveling through Europe, they took
a few lessons at the London center, out of
curiosity.
Those few lessons changed the Avaks'
plans. They remained in London for three
years to become teachers of the technique.
They then spent a year in Rome teaching,

and another in Paris, before establishing
the center in Palo Alto, one of four in the
Bay Area.
Students often come to the Avak's
expecting only to be "cured" of a certain
ailment. The student takes only enough
lessons to alleviate the pain, and then stops
coming. This happened to them once in
France.
Real Goal
'The ache goes away," warned Avak,
"but the student hasn't learned the goal
yet — that of not developing aches and
pains.
"That Frenchman came back to us
when he began hurting again. He hadn't
learned how to prevent it with only five
lessons."
The average student requires about 30
half-hour lessons over a three or four
month period to achieve the proper
control. The elderly or seriously deformed
might require more instruction. Lessons
start at two or three times a week, go to
once a week, then taper to once a
fortnight. Some students like to have an
odd lesson occasionally.
"You never learn it all; we are still
learning," he noted. "It's something you
continually apply to your whole life.
"You know, it's a lot like piano lessons.
Only the student is the piano."

who come to them complaining of
frequent headaches feel victimized "until
they realize they can stop them. It's a very
liberating feeling."
Training Center
The Avaks became interested in the
Alexander Technique while in London,
where the training center is. Both former
high school teachers, they had become
more and more dissatisfied with their
work. Traveling through Europe, they took
a few lessons at the London center, out of
curiosity.
Those few lessons changed the Avaks'
plans. They remained in London for three
years to become teachers of the technique.
They then spent a year in Rome teaching,

and another in Paris, before establishing
the center in Palo Alto, one of four in the
Bay Area.
Students often come to the Avak's
expecting only to be "cured" of a certain
ailment. The student takes only enough
lessons to alleviate the pain, and then stops
coming. This happened to them once in
France.
Real Goal
'The ache goes away," warned Avak,
"but the student hasn't learned the goal
yet — that of not developing aches and
pains.
"That Frenchman came back to us
when he began hurting again. He hadn't
learned how to prevent it with only five
lessons."
The average student requires about 30
half-hour lessons over a three or four
month period to achieve the proper
control. The elderly or seriously deformed
might require more instruction. Lessons
start at two or three times a week, go to
once a week, then taper to once a
fortnight. Some students like to have an
odd lesson occasionally.
"You never learn it all; we are still
learning," he noted. "It's something you
continually apply to your whole life.
"You know, it's a lot like piano lessons.
Only the student is the piano."

NEW KZSU CZAR—Mike Windes, a senior from San Diego, has been
appointed station manager of Stanford's radio station, KZSU. Windes
was appointed by Gary Fazzino, who resigned as station manager
Monday, and will serve until at least November. Windes previously
served as program director and public affairs director. One of his major
goals is to "get a lot of students working here in the fall."
"A healthy mind in a healthy body."
That has been a general motto in the
American education system for years. And
now, two former teachers are doing
something about the concept.
Edward and Linda Avak are teachers at
the Palo Alto Center for the F.M.
Alexander Technique, a method of
developing control over behavior.
"The goal is movement with less
effort," explains Avak. "You can feel
lighter and have more freedom of
movement."
The technique is an attempt to
eliminate bad postural habits which usually
bring on tension, resulting in headaches,
backaches, and more serious problems. It
was discovered by Shakespearean actor F.
Mathias Alexander 70 years ago in Sydney,
Australia.
Voice Problem
The young actor kept losing his voice,
always while on stage. By speaking at
home, before a mirror, Alexander noticed a
tendency to pull his head backward and
downward, creating tensions which might
be inhibiting his voice. By adjusting these
unnecessary movements, he gradually
cured his problem.
At first considered a pseudo-medical
treatment or a meditation philosophy, his

techniques gradually gained acceptance by
performers, educators, philosophers and
writers. Alexander taught his methods to
Aldous Huxley, George Bernard Shaw and
John Dewey.
Dewey, a profound believer, once said it
was "the new direction needed in
education."
More recently, 1973 Nobel Prize winner
Nikolas Tinbergen, a physiologist,
recommended the technique "as an
extremely sophisticated form of
rehabilitation." Tinbergen devoted over
half of his acceptance speech to praise of
Alexander's method.
Not A Treatment
The Alexander Technique is neither a
treatment nor an exercise. It is taught, with
the instructor guiding the student's
movement with his hands.
Instruction is in three stages. Avak first
has the student demonstrate simple
maneuvers, such as sitting, rising and
waling. Watching the student, he can
analyze typical bad habits.
The second stage consists of inhibiting
those bad habits. The student becomes
acutely aware of his tendencies, as the
teacher guides every movement.
The third step is to practice the better
patterns of motion, by mastering control
of what the student might have thought

were "involuntary" actions.
"We are interested in distributing
tension more evenly throughout the
body," says Avak. "We don't want a limp
body, but a relaxed one, soothed and ready
for action."
He explained that when tension is
evenly distributed, rather than
concentrated in small areas, there is less
stress, both mentally and physically.
"Any physical change affects your
mentality. You can't have a positive
outlook if your body is saying 'I'm
defeated.'"

eliminate bad postural habits which usually
bring on tension, resulting in headaches,
backaches, and more serious problems. It
was discovered by Shakespearean actor F.
Mathias Alexander 70 years ago in Sydney,
Australia.
Voice Problem
The young actor kept losing his voice,
always while on stage. By speaking at
home, before a mirror, Alexander noticed a
tendency to pull his head backward and
downward, creating tensions which might
be inhibiting his voice. By adjusting these
unnecessary movements, he gradually
cured his problem.
At first considered a pseudo-medical
treatment or a meditation philosophy, his

techniques gradually gained acceptance by
performers, educators, philosophers and
writers. Alexander taught his methods to
Aldous Huxley, George Bernard Shaw and
John Dewey.
Dewey, a profound believer, once said it
was "the new direction needed in
education."
More recently, 1973 Nobel Prize winner
Nikolas Tinbergen, a physiologist,
recommended the technique "as an
extremely sophisticated form of
rehabilitation." Tinbergen devoted over
half of his acceptance speech to praise of
Alexander's method.
Not A Treatment
The Alexander Technique is neither a
treatment nor an exercise. It is taught, with
the instructor guiding the student's
movement with his hands.
Instruction is in three stages. Avak first
has the student demonstrate simple
maneuvers, such as sitting, rising and
waling. Watching the student, he can
analyze typical bad habits.
The second stage consists of inhibiting
those bad habits. The student becomes
acutely aware of his tendencies, as the
teacher guides every movement.
The third step is to practice the better
patterns of motion, by mastering control
of what the student might have thought

were "involuntary" actions.
"We are interested in distributing
tension more evenly throughout the
body," says Avak. "We don't want a limp
body, but a relaxed one, soothed and ready
for action."
He explained that when tension is
evenly distributed, rather than
concentrated in small areas, there is less
stress, both mentally and physically.
"Any physical change affects your
mentality. You can't have a positive
outlook if your body is saying 'I'm
defeated.'"
Mrs. Avak recounts that many students
who come to them complaining of
frequent headaches feel victimized "until
they realize they can stop them. It's a very
liberating feeling."
Training Center
The Avaks became interested in the
Alexander Technique while in London,
where the training center is. Both former
high school teachers, they had become
more and more dissatisfied with their
work. Traveling through Europe, they took
a few lessons at the London center, out of
curiosity.
Those few lessons changed the Avaks'
plans. They remained in London for three
years to become teachers of the technique.
They then spent a year in Rome teaching,

and another in Paris, before establishing
the center in Palo Alto, one of four in the
Bay Area.
Students often come to the Avak's
expecting only to be "cured" of a certain
ailment. The student takes only enough
lessons to alleviate the pain, and then stops
coming. This happened to them once in
France.
Real Goal
'The ache goes away," warned Avak,
"but the student hasn't learned the goal
yet — that of not developing aches and
pains.
"That Frenchman came back to us
when he began hurting again. He hadn't
learned how to prevent it with only five
lessons."
The average student requires about 30
half-hour lessons over a three or four
month period to achieve the proper
control. The elderly or seriously deformed
might require more instruction. Lessons
start at two or three times a week, go to
once a week, then taper to once a
fortnight. Some students like to have an
odd lesson occasionally.
"You never learn it all; we are still
learning," he noted. "It's something you
continually apply to your whole life.
"You know, it's a lot like piano lessons.
Only the student is the piano."
