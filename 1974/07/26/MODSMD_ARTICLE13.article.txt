# YAF Shows Support For Reagan
## 
### BILL EVERS 
SAN FRANCISCO—In Gov. Ronald
Reagan's bid for the 1976 Republican
Presidential nomination, he has the
enthusiastic support of the conservative
Young Americans for Freedom (YAF).
The YAFers' affinity for Reagan was
apparent in the cheering, chanting, and
singing welcome they gave him at a YAF
national conference last weekend
commemorating the tenth anniversary of
the nomination of Sen. Barry Goldwater.
Reagan and Goldwater were the main
speakers at the conference's evening
banquets on July 18 and 20, addressing
350 YAFers and their adult supporters at
the Sheraton-Palace Hotel.
Reagan told the conference participants
Saturday that it was ironic that Goldwater,
whom he said the news media and the
liberal intellectuals had maligned in 1964,
is now viewed by them as a good,
honorable fellow.
'Hate-Filled Rhetoric'
Reagan recalled for the audience "the
hate-filled rhetoric" against Goldwater
during 1964, citing as one example the
statement of former California Gov.
Edmund G. Brown, Sr. that the "stench of
fascism" was "in the air."
Reagan's speech was a survey of what he
considered counterproductive
governmental programs and regulations,
giving special attention to the proposed
and recently defeated federal land use
control bill.
Reagan also proposed an "industrial
homestead act" designed to spread capital
investment to those now propertyless. His
proposal, while sketchy, was similar to
plans advocated by economist Louis Kelso.
Goldwater, who spoke Thursday, July
18, called the time of his nomination 10
years ago the "most memorable" of his
"entire life."

He said his nomination was made
possible by activists like those in YAF, "by
young men and women with strong ideals
and unyielding principles ... by people
just like you; people with enormous energy
and an unmoveable belief in Constitutional
government; people who were dedicated to
the conservative concept of limited
government control over the lives and
activities of free Americans."
Other speakers at the conference
included Rep. Stephen D. Symns, R—lda.;
Rep. Philip M. Crane, R—III.; political
campaign strategist F. Clifton White; and
conservative journalist M. Stanton Evans.
This YAF conference was not marked
by the acrimonious division into
conservative and libertarian factions which
characterized many of the organization's

national meetings during the past decade.
Aside from the fact that no policy
decisions were made at the conference, the
chief reason for the comparative harmony
seemed to be the conference's
concentration on domestic economic
issues. Campus radicalism and the Vietnam
war were issues which previously had
divided and splintered YAF. But these
issues have now faded from public
prominence.
The dominant conservative faction in

YAP'' has favored ! Utary intervention
abroad and control of subversives at home;
the minority libertarian faction has favored
a non-interventionist foreign policy and
defense of civil liberties. Both factions have
called for a laissez-faire economic policy.
Antagonism Emerges
Nonetheless, antagonism between the
two factions did come out when YAF
national officers were disgruntled by
radical libertarian literature tables and
during discussion of abortion.
On abortion, the libertarians generally
argue that a woman owns her own body
absolutely, while conservatives regard
abortion as murder. YAF's membership is
predominantly Roman Catholic.
Underlying the activities of the
conference was a tension between two
tactical perspectives as well.
The conservatives wish to realign the
Republican and Democratic parties into
conservative and liberal parties via the
Reagan-for-President movement.
The libertarians wish to devote at least
part of their electoral politics effort to an
ideologically-pure libertarian party.
University of Southern California
philosopher John Hospers, the Libertarian
Party's write-in candidate for governor of
California, presented this perspective in his
conference address.
Another gubernatorial candidate was
also at the YAF conference — Elizabeth
Keathley of Venice. Keathley, a feminist
and an individualist-anarchist, won the
California Peace and Freedom Party's
nomination in the June primary.
She shares many of the political views
of YAF's libertarian faction and attended
as an observer. She recently received
national news coverage for her
demonstration against ordinances
prohibiting nude bathers on California
beaches.

just like you; people with enormous energy
and an unmoveable belief in Constitutional
government; people who were dedicated to
the conservative concept of limited
government control over the lives and
activities of free Americans."
Other speakers at the conference
included Rep. Stephen D. Symns, R—lda.;
Rep. Philip M. Crane, R—III.; political
campaign strategist F. Clifton White; and
conservative journalist M. Stanton Evans.
This YAF conference was not marked
by the acrimonious division into
conservative and libertarian factions which
characterized many of the organization's

national meetings during the past decade.
Aside from the fact that no policy
decisions were made at the conference, the
chief reason for the comparative harmony
seemed to be the conference's
concentration on domestic economic
issues. Campus radicalism and the Vietnam
war were issues which previously had
divided and splintered YAF. But these
issues have now faded from public
prominence.
The dominant conservative faction in

YAP'' has favored ! Utary intervention
abroad and control of subversives at home;
the minority libertarian faction has favored
a non-interventionist foreign policy and
defense of civil liberties. Both factions have
called for a laissez-faire economic policy.
Antagonism Emerges
Nonetheless, antagonism between the
two factions did come out when YAF
national officers were disgruntled by
radical libertarian literature tables and
during discussion of abortion.
On abortion, the libertarians generally
argue that a woman owns her own body
absolutely, while conservatives regard
abortion as murder. YAF's membership is
predominantly Roman Catholic.
Underlying the activities of the
conference was a tension between two
tactical perspectives as well.
The conservatives wish to realign the
Republican and Democratic parties into
conservative and liberal parties via the
Reagan-for-President movement.
The libertarians wish to devote at least
part of their electoral politics effort to an
ideologically-pure libertarian party.
University of Southern California
philosopher John Hospers, the Libertarian
Party's write-in candidate for governor of
California, presented this perspective in his
conference address.
Another gubernatorial candidate was
also at the YAF conference — Elizabeth
Keathley of Venice. Keathley, a feminist
and an individualist-anarchist, won the
California Peace and Freedom Party's
nomination in the June primary.
She shares many of the political views
of YAF's libertarian faction and attended
as an observer. She recently received
national news coverage for her
demonstration against ordinances
prohibiting nude bathers on California
beaches.

SAN FRANCISCO—In Gov. Ronald
Reagan's bid for the 1976 Republican
Presidential nomination, he has the
enthusiastic support of the conservative
Young Americans for Freedom (YAF).
The YAFers' affinity for Reagan was
apparent in the cheering, chanting, and
singing welcome they gave him at a YAF
national conference last weekend
commemorating the tenth anniversary of
the nomination of Sen. Barry Goldwater.
Reagan and Goldwater were the main
speakers at the conference's evening
banquets on July 18 and 20, addressing
350 YAFers and their adult supporters at
the Sheraton-Palace Hotel.
Reagan told the conference participants
Saturday that it was ironic that Goldwater,
whom he said the news media and the
liberal intellectuals had maligned in 1964,
is now viewed by them as a good,
honorable fellow.
'Hate-Filled Rhetoric'
Reagan recalled for the audience "the
hate-filled rhetoric" against Goldwater
during 1964, citing as one example the
statement of former California Gov.
Edmund G. Brown, Sr. that the "stench of
fascism" was "in the air."
Reagan's speech was a survey of what he
considered counterproductive
governmental programs and regulations,
giving special attention to the proposed
and recently defeated federal land use
control bill.
Reagan also proposed an "industrial
homestead act" designed to spread capital
investment to those now propertyless. His
proposal, while sketchy, was similar to
plans advocated by economist Louis Kelso.
Goldwater, who spoke Thursday, July
18, called the time of his nomination 10
years ago the "most memorable" of his
"entire life."

He said his nomination was made
possible by activists like those in YAF, "by
young men and women with strong ideals
and unyielding principles ... by people
just like you; people with enormous energy
and an unmoveable belief in Constitutional
government; people who were dedicated to
the conservative concept of limited
government control over the lives and
activities of free Americans."
