# YA Fers Song To Reagan
## 
### 
(Sung to the tune of
"Battle Hymn of the Republic")
He has braved the trouble waters
He has flown across the skies.
He's the Man from California
He's the one we idolize.
He is headed for the White House
He will never compromise
He 7/ win in '76!
Chorus
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie Reagan,
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie Reagan,
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie Reagan,
He '11 win in '76!
