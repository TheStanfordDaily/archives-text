# 'Buster And Billie': Poor Nostalgia
## 
### KAREN LACHENAUER 
Columbia Pictures' latest
release Buster and Billie has all the
components of a strongly
affecting tragedy. This the
promotion material recognizes in

its ambitious way, heralding the
movie as "a tender love story, a
savage human drama, a gritty slice
of 1948 rural American nostalgia,
a comedy and a tragedy."
After such a catch-all

recommendation, few viewers
would tend to go see this film.
For good reason, for as anyone
might guess, this politician's kind
of equivocating ain't quite true.
Despite unrealized potential,

Buster and Billie is just like what
the film is all about: high school.
It's high school because the
screenplay is too simple. Buster, an
overwhelmingly virtuous guardian
of the underdog, befriends the
senior class clown (admirably
acted by Robert Englund). Then,
against all human norms, Buster
takes on the social code of
backwood Georgia, 1948, by
falling in love with the class
whore, Billie.
Buster and Billie is high school
because the structure's too weak.
Events weave in and out with
little relevance, leaving no thread;
rhythmless intercutting is partly
responsible for a draggy pace and
lack of climax. Buster gets to
show his confusion over falling in
love with Billie by walking to his
bedroom bureau in the night,
snapping on the light, mumbling a
few words and going back to bed.
Though Jan-Michael Vincent as
Buster (formerly seen in The
Mechanic and The World's
Greatest Athlete) has his first
chance at substantial,
corn-chawing characterization
requiring more than just looking
golden, his effectiveness is diluted
by a "scenes, not speeches"
policy. Characters must express
themselves through gestures and
monosyllables, yet the director
wields a hesitant hand: screams
are pathetically weak, languorous
looks languish.
Joan Goodfellow is the
painfully shy Billie; her first
"uninhibited" giggles make the

audience groan with
embarassment. From then on,
viewers waver in their sympathy,
never sure if they're with her or
agin her. This uncommanding
discontinuity is of a high school
competence, too.
While bucolic, the photography
is studentish, drawing on
conventions learnt in school: only
the top of a moving truck visible
above a field of cornflowers,
visions through lacy leaves or
raindrops. Reliance on the distant
and unfocused becomes so
comfortable, in fact, that it
detracts from a script that never
comes to grips with its subjects.
If Buster and Billie could have
been written by a more rigorous
expositor of behavior than Ron
Turbeville or directed by a firmer
guide than Daniel Petrie, it might
have achieved the moving,
nonverbal effects it attempts.
As it stands, it conveys
nostalgia faddish with those
currently in high school or precious
to those who went, perhaps in
1948 . . . and who can, by the
way, remember girls like Buster's
one-time steady (Pamela Sue
Martin) abstaining from sex even
when the time is ripe — in an
esteemed jalopy.
Buster and Billie is amateurish
— cinematically lovely and
literarily void. As before, the
promotion material best sums it:
"What took place in that town in
1948 should have been a love
story."

THE PUT DOWN—"Margie (Pamela Sue Marlin) tells Buster (Jan-Michael Vincent), her classmate and
fiance, they must wait until they have graduated and are married, no matter how frustrated they feel."
That sophomoric caption came with the promotional material for Buster and Billie. Unfortunately, the
film is on an equal level with the promotion.
