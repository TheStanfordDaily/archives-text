Plum blossoms are the first
flowers to appear at the end of
the long, cold Chinese winters. In
Chinese paintings and poetry,
plum blossoms have come to
symbolize the rising of the new
from the old.
A small collection of 47
paintings by Liu, Ju-Tung, China's
most prominent plum blossom
painter, is being shown at the
Bechtel International Center
through the end of the month.
In our world of overwhelming
visual input, an exhibit of oriental
blossom paintings would seem
inconsequential. However, plum
blossom paintings incorporate
more than most people realize.
Plum blossom painting is a
long-lived tradition in China. For
centuries, each dynasty has had its
own plum blossom painter who
devoted his life to painting
nothing but plum blossoms.
35 years ago, Liu, Ju-Tung,
committed himself to painting

plum blossoms. Now at the age of
76, he is recognized as China's
premier living plum blossom
painter.
The art itself involves not only
painting, but calligraphy and
writing poetry as well. The
painting is quick and simple, using
usually one or two colors,
sometimes three, but seldom more
than three.
Before beginning painting, the
artist prepares himself by
gathering in his sun chi or energy.
Gathering in his sun chi is a
crucial part of the creative process
for it is this energy that will give
the painting its movement or life.
Once the artist begins the
painting he cannot break until he
has completed the work. The
thick gnarled branches are laid out
in one continuous stroke from the
bottom to the tip, imparting the
strength of the chi out to the end.
In Liu's paintings, this
movement is apparent in the
finished piece. The eye travels

from the thick black branches to
the blossoms on the tip.
The blossoms, usually white,
pink or red, and the varying
texture, shade and configuration
of the branches give Liu's
paintings a surprising amont of
depth and complexity.
The juxtaposition of the bright
animate blossoms and the dry,
dead branches highlights the
central theme of not only the
painting but also the poem that is
a part of each work.
One of Liu's poems translates
roughly, "I have walked in the
wood with my cane, stumbling on
broken ice, looking for life for
many days only to find it in the
blossoms at my own porch."
The characters of the poem are
carefully scribed on the painting,
the calligraphy being an important
craft in itself.
Unfortunately,looking at an art
exhibit at the International Center
is like wine-tasting in a New York
City automat cafeteria.
Distracting.
But overcome that, find one
painting that interests you and
consider for awhile why Liu,
Ju-Tung has spent 36 years
painting and writing poetry about
plum blossoms.
