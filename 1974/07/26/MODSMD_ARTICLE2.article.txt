# Olivieri, Snape Levy Stipulations
## 'Live Oak' Receives ASSU Backing 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Live Oak, the proposed weekly
news-features newspaper, will be
allowed to publish under ASSU
auspices in the fall and will have
office space on campus, ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri
and Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Dale Snape decided yesterday.
The decision carried a number
of stipulations, however, including

ASSU accounting of Live Oak's
finances.
Olivieri questioned the
newspaper's "financial viability"
on Monday and said he was ready
to close its financial books.
Live Oak Editor-Business
Manager Bill Weinstein flew down
from Seattle, Wash, to attend
yesterday's meeting to clear up
Olivieri's questions. The meeting,

attended by Weinstein, Olivieri,
Snape, ASSU President Mike
Herman, Stanford Money Book
Publisher Jim Baer and ASSU
Typesetting Shop Project Director
Beverly Hendricks, produced the
ASSU position on Live Oak.
Space Question
According to that decision,
Live Oak will not have permanent
office space in the Storke Student
Publications building during
September, but will be allowed
access to the building's workroom
and upstairs photo lab.
In addition, the publication
will have space in the ASSU's
Tresidder office loft until October
— an arrangement suggested by
Herman.
In October, the Action
Research Liaison Office (ARLO)
will rove into the loft space and
the ASSU Publications Board will
be faced with the decision of
granting Live Oak space in the
Storke Building.
Weinstein must make sure that
alternative space, other than
ASSU or Storke Building space, is
available to Live Oak in October,
should the Pub Board deny the
paper's request for space, Olivieri
stressed.
Herman emphasized that Live
Oak will be "thrown out" of

ASSU space to make room for
ARLO regardless of the Pub
Board's vote.
Chappie Space
Olivieri and Snape indicated
that should Live Oak demonstrate
financial viability, the Pub Board
might consider granting the paper
use of space now belonging to the
finan c i a 11 y-troubled Stanford
Chaparral.
Among the stipulations
Weinstein must agree to include
paying the paper's bills with cash
in advance. Live Oak must also
open an ASSU financial account,
either checking or savings. He
must agree that all inflows and
outflows of cash "flow directly or
indirectly" through that account,
Olivieri said.
The decision also affirmed that
Live Oak will receive a $500 loan
from the Dean of Student Affairs
office to help cover beginning
office expenses.
Another $1500, previously
granted by the Pub Board to the
paper, will be withheld unless Live
Oak can raise $8500 in outside
donations by Sept. 1. The full Pub
Board can vote to restore that
money in October, however,
according to Olivieri.
