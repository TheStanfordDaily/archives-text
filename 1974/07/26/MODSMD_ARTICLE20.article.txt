Nixon Under Fire At Hearings
WASHINGTON — President Nixon came under heavy
fire during final debate at the House Judiciary Committee
impeachment inquiry yesterday, and at the end of the
session, it was clear the panel would vote to recommend to
impeach the President.
All 38 members of the committee made opening
statements Wednesday or yesterday. Informal surveys
showed that 28 of them seemed ready to vote for
impeachment on one or more articiles.
The panel resumes deliberations today at 7 a.m. PDT. It
is expected to consider a proposal by Rep. Robert
McClory, R —lll. McClory said yesterday he would vote in
favor of a properly worded article of impeachment on
abuse of Presidential power and initiate such an article
charging seven impeachable acts. McClory, the
committee's second-ranking Republican, was earlier
thought to be undecided on the issue.
In addition to McClory six other Republicans are
thought to be favoring impeachment, with 10 G.O.P.
members opposed. All 21 Democrats are expected to vote
for impeachment.
Several dramatic speeches were delivered at yesterday's
session. Committee Chairman Peter Rodino, D—N.J., said,
he would vote for impeachment "with a heavy heart so
that our country may survive not only this test but tests
for all time."
Another Democrat, James Mann of South Carolina, had
tears in his eyes as he appealed to the White House to
release all the evidence.
In San Clemente, the White House issued a statement
saying the debate offered many generalities but no hard
evidence that the President committed an impeachable
offense.
Yesterday's debate was considered a preview of what
the actual House and Senate would discuss if and when
they take up the issue of Presidential misconduct.
Supreme Court Vetoes Busing Plan
WASHINGTON — The United States Supreme Court
yesterday struck down a Detroit desegregation plan calling
for busing students across district lines.
By a 5-4 vote, the court said that busing pupils from a
black inner city to a white suburban district was improper.

The court held that federal courts may not impose
multidistrict desegregation plans where there is no finding
that local districts had failed to operate integrated school
systems. The case was sent back to District Court in
Detroit to formulate a desegregation plan for the city
itself.
Hours later, the court said that a lower court ruling
consolidating the Louisville, Ky. elementary schools with
those of Jefferson, a nearby suburb, should be
reconsidered in light of the decision.
Justices Warren Burger, Potter Stewart, Harry
Blackmun, Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist vcted for
the ruling, with Thurgood Marshall, William Douglas,
William Brennan and Byron White in dissent.
Speaking for the court. Burger said "No single tradition
is more deeply rooted than local control of public schools.
"Local autonomy has long been thought essential both
for the maintenance of community concern and support
for public schools and to the quality of the educational
process."
Marshall, the only black member of the court, wrote in
his dissent, "We deal with the right of all our children,
whatever their race, to an equal start in life and to an
equal opportunity to reach their full potentials as citizens.
"Those children who have been denied that right in the
past deserve better than to see fences thrown up to deny
them that right in the future."
Quick Tape Release Requested
WASHINGTON - U.S. District Judge John Sirica will
hear arguments today on a motion by Watergate special
prosecutor Leon Jaworski that President Nixon be
required to turn over within the next two to 10 days the
64 Watergate documents and tapes the Supreme Court said
Nixon must surrender.
Jaworski said he must receive the evidence quickly in
order to start the Watergate cover-up trial Sept. 9.
Jaworski sought the tapes as evidence for the trial.
The Supreme Court, in a historic ruling Wednesday,
ordered Nixon to release the tapes. Nixon said he would
comply with the ruling.
Cyprus Settlement Talks Begin
GENEVA — Turkey, Greece and Britain began talks

over the Cyprus issue yesterday in Geneva.
The three parties expressed their determination to
reach a settlement at the peace talks, rather than on the
battlegrounds of the strategic Mediterranean island.
In Nicosia, the Cypriot capital, a U.N. observer said
that the three-day old cease fire seemed to be holding,
with only scattered outbursts of gunfire.
Turkey, however, continued to pour tanks and trucks
into Cyprus.
Nixon Vows To Fight Inflation
LOS ANGELES — President Nixon said last night he
will stay with basic economic strategies to fight inflation.
Speaking before a group of businessmen in Los Angeles
and a nationwide radio audience, Nixon said he would cut
$5 billion from the budget and end 40,000 government
jobs through the process of attrition.
He also said he would veto any bill submitted by
Congress he considers to be inflationary, and rejected
"shock treatment" for the economy. He said measures
such as more wage-price controls or a tax cut would be
"like pouring gasoline on a raging fire."
Inmate Says He'll Kill Hostages
HUNTSVILLE, Tex. — A prison inmate suspected of
the murders of 50 former associates in a multimillion
dollar dope smuggling ring vowed to kill 11 hostages
yesterday unless he is released.
The inmate, Fred Gomex Carrasco, 34, took control of
the prison library Wednesday. He and five other inmates
have held the library since then, avoiding sharpshooters by
stationing one after another handcuffed hostage at the
prison door. Seven women and three men, none of whom
are inmates, are being held.
The six convicts say they will kill the hostages unless
they are given automatic weapons, ammunition and
bullet-proof vests and are allowed to leave prison.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow, except for fog likely
near the coast and occasional cloudiness and possible rain
today inland. Highs today and tomorrow near 90. Low
tonight in the upper 50's to lower 60's. Northwest winds
10 to 20 miles per hour.
