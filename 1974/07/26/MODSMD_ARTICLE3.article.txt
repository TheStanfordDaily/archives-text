# Stanford May Oppose P.A. Rezoning Plans
## 
### DON COX 
The University is concerned
about and may oppose a possible
plan by Palo Alto to rezone
University-owned lands. The plan
is proposed in the city's
Comprehensive Plan Impact
Report.
University officials are
studying planning options
contained in the report that
would rezone 176 acres of
Stanford-owned industrial park

land from industrial to residential
classifications. Also proposed is
the rezoning of the Stanford
Shopping Center to prevent its
expansion.
Rezoning might have a
significant impact on the state of
University finances, Vice
President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said
last night.
The comprehensive report
forecasts substantial increases in
employment levels if these lands
are developed and an
accompanying increase in the
traffic flow through the city. The
increase in traffic has stimulated
much opposition among Palo Alto
citizens in recent public hearings.
The proposed zoning options
are designed to limit the number
of future Palo Alto jobs.
While the rezoning options are
of a major concern to Stanford
and are likely to provoke much
debate and discussion, Augsburger
said he didn't "see this as an
adversary kind of thing — at least
not yet."
Stanford officials admit they
were caught off guard by the
recent report's release. They are
working hard to develop an
official position regarding the
planning options in the report.
Manager for Land Resources
John Breedlove identified the
Stanford Shopping Center as a
large source of unrestricted
income to the University. He said,
"It seems to have the potential for
expansion," adding, however, that
there are no immediate plans to
expand it.
Augsburger said any rezoning
prohibiting shopping center
expansion, would interfere with
the maintenance of the center's
competitiveness. "Maintaining
competitiveness may or may not
require expansion but it is
important to retain the
flexibility," he said.
In rezoning the shopping
center, Palo Alto would lose
$580,000 in revenues because of
projected future expansion of the
facilities, city officials said. While
Stanford land comprises only
seven percent of the land in Palo
Alto, property, sales and utilities
taxes on Stanford land represent
about a third of the city's total
revenues.
Zoning the shopping center
would eliminate 1000 potential
additional employees, the report
estimated.
By 1990, the zoning would
result in 1150 fewer daily
vehicular home-to-work trips and
2850 fewer daily shopping trips to
the center.
Neither University nor city
officials said the zoning was a
political move to shift business
from the shopping center to the
city's downtown retailers.
The report identifies seven
parcels of land in the city which it
proposes to rezone from industrial
to residential usage. Of the total
191 acres involved, 176 acres, or
about 92 percent of the land, is
Stanford-owned.
Two of the four parcels of
Stanford land are already leased
to Hewlett-Packard Co. and
Syntex Corp. Another parcel by
Arastradero Rd. and Coyote Hill
has already been "significantly
developed" by Stanford at a cost
of several hundred thousand
dollars said Augsburger.
Stanford was recently given the
right to develop this land as the
result of a law suit. Breedlove said
the University gave up a
substantial portion of the area to
open space because of the law
suit. About one third to one half
of the land is now designated as
open space for periods of 20 to 50
years.
Roads and sewers have already
been installed and the University
is looking for a firm to lease the
site.
'The city has some obligation
to maintaining the present zoning
since they acceded to the

settlement," said Augsburger. "It
is inconceivable that the city
would reverse itself."
Breedlove said it would have "a
distastrous affect financially if we
couldn't develop it." Breedlove
said revenues from leasing the
land have been planned for in the
University budget.
The zoning proposals were
discussed by University and city
officials yesterday in a meeting of
the Palo Alto-Stanford Liaison
Committee.
"Traffic is the real issue and
whatever generates it," said
Breedlove. "They (Palo Altans)
perceive it as employment."
Palo Alto Principal Planner
George Zimmerman said the city
was "very interested" in
suggestions by Stanford
concerning the report. He said the
interests of the University and the
city were linked and that "one is
not going to live without the
other."
Zimmerman added that the
city's first obligation was toward
the city and not Stanford's lands.

Breedlove said it would have "a
distastrous affect financially if we
couldn't develop it." Breedlove
said revenues from leasing the
land have been planned for in the
University budget.
The zoning proposals were
discussed by University and city
officials yesterday in a meeting of
the Palo Alto-Stanford Liaison
Committee.
"Traffic is the real issue and
whatever generates it," said
Breedlove. "They (Palo Altans)
perceive it as employment."
Palo Alto Principal Planner
George Zimmerman said the city
was "very interested" in
suggestions by Stanford
concerning the report. He said the
interests of the University and the
city were linked and that "one is
not going to live without the
other."
Zimmerman added that the
city's first obligation was toward
the city and not Stanford's lands.
The University is concerned
about and may oppose a possible
plan by Palo Alto to rezone
University-owned lands. The plan
is proposed in the city's
Comprehensive Plan Impact
Report.
University officials are
studying planning options
contained in the report that
would rezone 176 acres of
Stanford-owned industrial park

land from industrial to residential
classifications. Also proposed is
the rezoning of the Stanford
Shopping Center to prevent its
expansion.
Rezoning might have a
significant impact on the state of
University finances, Vice
President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said
last night.
The comprehensive report
forecasts substantial increases in
employment levels if these lands
are developed and an
accompanying increase in the
traffic flow through the city. The
increase in traffic has stimulated
much opposition among Palo Alto
citizens in recent public hearings.
The proposed zoning options
are designed to limit the number
of future Palo Alto jobs.
While the rezoning options are
of a major concern to Stanford
and are likely to provoke much
debate and discussion, Augsburger
said he didn't "see this as an
adversary kind of thing — at least
not yet."
Stanford officials admit they
were caught off guard by the
recent report's release. They are
working hard to develop an
official position regarding the
planning options in the report.
Manager for Land Resources
John Breedlove identified the
Stanford Shopping Center as a
large source of unrestricted
income to the University. He said,
"It seems to have the potential for
expansion," adding, however, that
there are no immediate plans to
expand it.
Augsburger said any rezoning
prohibiting shopping center
expansion, would interfere with
the maintenance of the center's
competitiveness. "Maintaining
competitiveness may or may not
require expansion but it is
important to retain the
flexibility," he said.
In rezoning the shopping
center, Palo Alto would lose
$580,000 in revenues because of
projected future expansion of the
facilities, city officials said. While
Stanford land comprises only
seven percent of the land in Palo
Alto, property, sales and utilities
taxes on Stanford land represent
about a third of the city's total
revenues.
Zoning the shopping center
would eliminate 1000 potential
additional employees, the report
estimated.
By 1990, the zoning would
result in 1150 fewer daily
vehicular home-to-work trips and
2850 fewer daily shopping trips to
the center.
Neither University nor city
officials said the zoning was a
political move to shift business
from the shopping center to the
city's downtown retailers.
The report identifies seven
parcels of land in the city which it
proposes to rezone from industrial
to residential usage. Of the total
191 acres involved, 176 acres, or
about 92 percent of the land, is
Stanford-owned.
Two of the four parcels of
Stanford land are already leased
to Hewlett-Packard Co. and
Syntex Corp. Another parcel by
Arastradero Rd. and Coyote Hill
has already been "significantly
developed" by Stanford at a cost
of several hundred thousand
dollars said Augsburger.
Stanford was recently given the
right to develop this land as the
result of a law suit. Breedlove said
the University gave up a
substantial portion of the area to
open space because of the law
suit. About one third to one half
of the land is now designated as
open space for periods of 20 to 50
years.
Roads and sewers have already
been installed and the University
is looking for a firm to lease the
site.
'The city has some obligation
to maintaining the present zoning
since they acceded to the

settlement," said Augsburger. "It
is inconceivable that the city
would reverse itself."
Breedlove said it would have "a
distastrous affect financially if we
couldn't develop it." Breedlove

Arastradero Rd. and Coyote Hill
has already been "significantly
developed" by Stanford at a cost
of several hundred thousand
dollars said Augsburger.
Stanford was recently given the
right to develop this land as the
result of a law suit. Breedlove said
the University gave up a
substantial portion of the area to
open space because of the law
suit. About one third to one half
of the land is now designated as
open space for periods of 20 to 50
years.
Roads and sewers have already
been installed and the University
is looking for a firm to lease the
site.
'The city has some obligation
to maintaining the present zoning
since they acceded to the

settlement," said Augsburger. "It
is inconceivable that the city
would reverse itself."
Breedlove said it would have "a
distastrous affect financially if we
couldn't develop it." Breedlove
said revenues from leasing the
land have been planned for in the
University budget.
The zoning proposals were
discussed by University and city
officials yesterday in a meeting of
the Palo Alto-Stanford Liaison
Committee.
"Traffic is the real issue and
whatever generates it," said
Breedlove. "They (Palo Altans)
perceive it as employment."
Palo Alto Principal Planner
George Zimmerman said the city
was "very interested" in
suggestions by Stanford
concerning the report. He said the
interests of the University and the
city were linked and that "one is
not going to live without the
other."
Zimmerman added that the
city's first obligation was toward
the city and not Stanford's lands.
