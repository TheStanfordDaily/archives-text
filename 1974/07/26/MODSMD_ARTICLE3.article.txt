# Stanford May Oppose P.A. Rezoning Plans

### DON COX 
The University is concerned
about and may oppose a possible
plan by Palo Alto to rezone
University-owned lands. The plan
is proposed in the city's
Comprehensive Plan Impact
Report.
University officials are
studying planning options
contained in the report that
would rezone 176 acres of
Stanford-owned industrial park

land from industrial to residential
classifications. Also proposed is
the rezoning of the Stanford
Shopping Center to prevent its
expansion.
Rezoning might have a
significant impact on the state of
University finances, Vice
President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said
last night.
The comprehensive report
forecasts substantial increases in
employment levels if these lands
are developed and an
accompanying increase in the
traffic flow through the city. The
increase in traffic has stimulated
much opposition among Palo Alto
citizens in recent public hearings.
The proposed zoning options
are designed to limit the number
of future Palo Alto jobs.
While the rezoning options are
of a major concern to Stanford
and are likely to provoke much
debate and discussion, Augsburger
said he didn't "see this as an
adversary kind of thing — at least
not yet."
Stanford officials admit they
were caught off guard by the
recent report's release. They are
working hard to develop an
official position regarding the
planning options in the report.
Manager for Land Resources
John Breedlove identified the
Stanford Shopping Center as a
large source of unrestricted
income to the University. He said,
"It seems to have the potential for
expansion," adding, however, that
there are no immediate plans to
expand it.
Augsburger said any rezoning
prohibiting shopping center
expansion, would interfere with
the maintenance of the center's
competitiveness. "Maintaining
competitiveness may or may not
require expansion but it is
important to retain the
flexibility," he said.
In rezoning the shopping
center, Palo Alto would lose
