# ERA A Fraud

The proposed Equal Rights
Amendment now under
consideration by state legislatures
pretends to improve the status of
women. Actually, it is a fraud
which will take away from women
some of their most important
rights.
There is nothing the Equal
Rights Amendment can give
women which they do not already
have, or have a way of getting.
"Equal pay for equal work" is
guaranteed by the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, and by the Equal
Employment Opportunity Act of
1972 which is very specific in
forbidding discrimination in
regard to hiring, pay and
promotions. If any woman is
discriminated against in
employment, she can file a claim
with the Federal Government, and
the Government will pay all the
costs.
On the other hand, the Equal
Rights Amendment will take away
from the American woman her
most important right of all —
namely, the right not to take a
job, the right to care for her own
baby in her own home and to be
financially supported by her
husband.
The laws of every state now
require the husband to support his
wife and children and to provide a
home for them to live in. As it is a
fact of life that women have
babies and men don't, we have
developed the laws and customs
that men must provide the
financial support.
Equal Responsibility
The Equal Rights Amendment
will remove this sole obligation
from the husband, and make the
wife equally responsible to
provide a home for her family,
and to go to work in a paying job
outside the home in order to
provide 50 percent of the
financial support of her family.
The reason for this is that the
Equal Rights Amendment will
impose a doctrinaire equality on
the sexes and prohibit the law

from imposing any obligations on
one sex which it does not impose
equally on the other sex. A legal
obligation for equal financial
support is grossly unfair to
women because women still have
to bear the babies.
It is admitted by all those for
and against the Equal Rights
Amendment that it will positively
make women subject to the draft
and for combat duty on an equal
basis with men. Most women's
libbers admit that this is what
they want. Others side-step the
issue by arguing that there will be
no more wars or no more draft.
Mandatory Draft
We can all hope for utopia on
earth, but meanwhile ERA will
make mandatory the draft of
women equally with men. Such a
radical requirement is opposed by
the overwhelming majority of
Americans, both men and women.
When the Equal Rights
Amendment was being debated
before the Illirois Legislature,
Professor Philip B. Kurland of the
University of Chicago Law School
sent a telegram opposing
ratification. His telegram read:
"Regret inability to appear before
your Committee on so-called
Equal Rights Amendment because
I think that it is largely
misrepresented as a women's
rights amendment when in fact
the primary beneficiary will be
men."
The Equal Rights Amendment
is a fraud which will wipe out a
woman's present freedom of
choice to take a job — or to be a
full-time wife and mother
supported by her husband. Please
urge your Legislators to rescind
this amendment which will
deprive wives, mothers and
draft-age girls of previous rights
and privileges they now possess.
