Death Penalty
Editor:
The July 12 Stanford Daily contained an
editorial opposing capital punishment.
The argument against the death penalty in the
editorial contained three principal errors:
First, the editorial argued that the punishment
meted out in courts of justice should be designed to
fit the criminal instead of the offense. •
On the contrary, the punishment should fit the
crime. If the punishment is fitted to the criminal, as
it is in indeterminate sentences in California
prisons, then too much discretionary power is left
in the hands of prison officials. We will have more
George Jacksons spending years in prison for minor
crimes because the authorities consider them not to
be rehabilitated.
The maximum penalty for an offense should be
fixed in proportion to the crime, but the law
should be changed so that the victim or his heirs
can forgive the criminal in whole or in part.
Secondly, the Daily condemned the justified
wrath that leads to a desire for retribution. In
sloganeering fashion, the Daily called this "blood
lust."
In the specific case cited by the Daily the
criminal was convicted of first-degree murder, rape
and kidnapping. Punishment should be determined
by the gravity of the offense, as the criminal has
taken away the rights of the victim so should the
criminal be punished. In this particular case, surely
death is deserved.
In a recent lecture, University of Toronto Prof.
Walter Berns gave an excellent response to
comments like that of the Daily's on "blood lust."
Berns said: "Anger is the sentiment aroused by
the sight of injustice, and is therefore intimately
allied with justice — and civil society requires
justice. .. . Anger is satisfied when retribution is
exacted, yes, but that righteous anger is also
rewarded when retribution is exacted. And that
righteous anger should be rewarded, for its basis is
the sentiment that to murder is wrong." It is the
moral wrongness of murder that makes it deserving
of punishment.
Thirdly, the Daily implied that youth should not
have full legal rights and responsibilities. The
editorial suggested that the criminal's age (in this
case, 20 years old) should be a legal consideration.
On the contrary, all paternalistic judicial set-ups
for youth, like the present juvenile court system,
should be abolished. But the law should be changed
as indicated above so that a victim or his heirs can
forgive a criminal on the ground that he is young or
on any other grounds.

Thanks To Fazzino
Editor:
Palo Alto owes a vote of thanks to KZSU and
Gary Fazzino for their excellent coverage of Palo
Alto city matters, especially their broadcasting of
all Palo Alto City Council meetings.
Council meetings have been broadcast regularly
for over two years now by KZSU, the student
operated FM radio station based at Stanford
University — 90.1 on your FM dial. Gary Fazzino,
the public affairs director, has made this all
interesting even to the neophyte by introducing the
meetings with pertinent background information
and by concluding with a good wrap-up. He is well
attuned to Council doings, making his commentary
one of insight and interest. Monday was Gary's last
meeting — we will miss him and hope KZSU has
someone ready to take over.
To those of us who remember "the old days"
when considerably more effort was required to stay
even somewhat aware of city business, the
availability of Council packets in the libraries, the
greatly improved written minutes of the meetings
and especially broadcasting of the meetings are
fabulous, fabulous improvements. The changes are
indicative of the priority our present and most
recent Councils place on open communication with
the voters. It is so very important, indeed basic, to
an informed, involved citizenry.
The Council is to be commended for initiating
these changes and we are fortunate indeed that
KZSU and Gary Fazzino handled their
responsibilities so ably.

I often eat at Tresidder, and the planned
restriction of food service would be a problem. Hot
dogs and hamburgers may be long on profits but
they are short on nutrition. Stanford should have a
place to get a full meal at a moderate price, or take
a visitor without driving into town.
The cafeteria could save money by cutting down
on the meat in its main dishes, which is excessive,
and on the processed junk foods. A good
vegetable/bean stew, maybe with a little meat or
soybean, would anchor an attractive and nutritious
lunch which could sell for about a dollar.

comments like that of the Daily's on "blood lust."
Berns said: "Anger is the sentiment aroused by
the sight of injustice, and is therefore intimately
allied with justice — and civil society requires
justice. .. . Anger is satisfied when retribution is
exacted, yes, but that righteous anger is also
rewarded when retribution is exacted. And that
righteous anger should be rewarded, for its basis is
the sentiment that to murder is wrong." It is the
moral wrongness of murder that makes it deserving
of punishment.
Thirdly, the Daily implied that youth should not
have full legal rights and responsibilities. The
editorial suggested that the criminal's age (in this
case, 20 years old) should be a legal consideration.
On the contrary, all paternalistic judicial set-ups
for youth, like the present juvenile court system,
should be abolished. But the law should be changed
as indicated above so that a victim or his heirs can
forgive a criminal on the ground that he is young or
on any other grounds.

Thanks To Fazzino
Editor:
Palo Alto owes a vote of thanks to KZSU and
Gary Fazzino for their excellent coverage of Palo
Alto city matters, especially their broadcasting of
all Palo Alto City Council meetings.
Council meetings have been broadcast regularly
for over two years now by KZSU, the student
operated FM radio station based at Stanford
University — 90.1 on your FM dial. Gary Fazzino,
the public affairs director, has made this all
interesting even to the neophyte by introducing the
meetings with pertinent background information
and by concluding with a good wrap-up. He is well
attuned to Council doings, making his commentary
one of insight and interest. Monday was Gary's last
meeting — we will miss him and hope KZSU has
someone ready to take over.
To those of us who remember "the old days"
when considerably more effort was required to stay
even somewhat aware of city business, the
availability of Council packets in the libraries, the
greatly improved written minutes of the meetings
and especially broadcasting of the meetings are
fabulous, fabulous improvements. The changes are
indicative of the priority our present and most
recent Councils place on open communication with
the voters. It is so very important, indeed basic, to
an informed, involved citizenry.
The Council is to be commended for initiating
these changes and we are fortunate indeed that
KZSU and Gary Fazzino handled their
responsibilities so ably.

I often eat at Tresidder, and the planned
restriction of food service would be a problem. Hot
dogs and hamburgers may be long on profits but
they are short on nutrition. Stanford should have a
place to get a full meal at a moderate price, or take
a visitor without driving into town.
The cafeteria could save money by cutting down
on the meat in its main dishes, which is excessive,
and on the processed junk foods. A good
vegetable/bean stew, maybe with a little meat or
soybean, would anchor an attractive and nutritious
lunch which could sell for about a dollar.

Death Penalty
Editor:
The July 12 Stanford Daily contained an
editorial opposing capital punishment.
The argument against the death penalty in the
editorial contained three principal errors:
First, the editorial argued that the punishment
meted out in courts of justice should be designed to
fit the criminal instead of the offense. •
On the contrary, the punishment should fit the
crime. If the punishment is fitted to the criminal, as
it is in indeterminate sentences in California
prisons, then too much discretionary power is left
in the hands of prison officials. We will have more
George Jacksons spending years in prison for minor
crimes because the authorities consider them not to
be rehabilitated.
The maximum penalty for an offense should be
fixed in proportion to the crime, but the law
should be changed so that the victim or his heirs
can forgive the criminal in whole or in part.
Secondly, the Daily condemned the justified
wrath that leads to a desire for retribution. In
sloganeering fashion, the Daily called this "blood
lust."
In the specific case cited by the Daily the
criminal was convicted of first-degree murder, rape
and kidnapping. Punishment should be determined
by the gravity of the offense, as the criminal has
taken away the rights of the victim so should the
criminal be punished. In this particular case, surely
death is deserved.
In a recent lecture, University of Toronto Prof.
Walter Berns gave an excellent response to
