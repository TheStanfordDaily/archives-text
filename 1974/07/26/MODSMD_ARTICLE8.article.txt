# 1550 Freshmen Plan To Enroll In Autumn
## 
### 
The number of students
planning to enroll here as
freshmen this fall is currently
1550, slightly higher than the
1470 places expected to be filled.
However, Robert Hamrdla,
director of the Academic
Information Center, said that
normally about 25 students who
indicated they would come
change their mind.
In April of this year, Dean of
Admission Fred Hargadon said
there were 1470 places available.
This figure is not absolute, as
approximately 2400 applicants
are accepted to fill the class.
M. John Bunnell, associate
dean of admissions, said that his
office played "a real guessing
game" when trying to determine
how many students to admit. He
added the unusually large
freshman class will not cause
many problems.

Freshman seminars might be
affected adversely because not as
many students will be able to
enroll in them.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton said he did not
foresee any greater housing
problem than usual.
He said that the housing office
allots 1550 full spaces for
freshmen and transfer students,
with freshmen being guaranteed
spaces.
If all 1550 freshmen come and
more spaces are needed for
transfer students, Horton said
freshmen may be put into quads
in Roble Hall, or doubled up in
Lagunita Court singles.
Horton indicated that the
situation would not affect the
number of places available for
those students in the housing
draw.
