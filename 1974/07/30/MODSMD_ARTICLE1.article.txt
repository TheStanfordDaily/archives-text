# Committee Passes Second Article 28-10
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The House
Judiciary Committee last night
voted 28-10 to approve a second
article of impeachment against
President Richard M. Nixon,
charging him with abuse of the
power of the Presidency.
The specific charges in the
article include use of the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) for
political harrassment,
participation in the Watergate
cover-up, instigation of illegal
wiretaps and the commissioning
and direction of the "plumbers
unit."

The "plumbers," a special
secret investigating team attached
to the White House, participated
in the burglaries at the
Democratic National Committee
Headquarters and at the office of
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
By approving the second
article, committee majority
members made it clear that they
feel the President has the
affirmative duty to "make clear to
his subordinates that they must
not break the law."
The second article is also based
on offenses the President "should

have known about," in the words
of committee members. Several
congressmen voiced concern that
Nixon was not "policing his
lieutenants."
A prime-time television and
radio audience saw the majority
consistently defeat Republican
minority attempts to water down
the second article, leading some
Nixon supporters on the
committee to claim the President
was being denied due process.
Some committee Republicans had
sought to limit the article only to
wrongs the President knew about

in advance.
Earlier in the day, Rep. Charles
Wiggins, R-Calif., failed in his
attempt to delete a portion of the
article charging Nixon with
authorizing and permitting the
illegal operations of the
"plumbers unit."
McClory Switch
Rep. Robert McClory, R-111.,
joined a solid 27-member majority
favoring impeachment, signalling a
gain of one vote from the 27-11
margin on the first article of
impeachment voted Saturday.
In explaining his vote, McClory
said that too many crimes were
committed in the White House
and that the President had failed
the American people, as well as
the Constitution.
After its historic vote, the
committee adjourned until 7:30
a.m. PDT today. KZSU 90.1 FM
will carry those proceedings live.
Impeachment Likely
The committee's strong
showing for impeachment
strengthened speculation in
Washington that the full House
will also favor impeachment on at
least one article by a large margin.
Even one of the committee's
staunchest anti-impeachment
figures, Rep. Edward Hutchinson,
R-Mich., conceded in an interview
yesterday that the House would
probably vote to impeach Nixon.
During the debate, Wiggins
maintained that the establishment
of the "plumbers unit" was not
illegal and that the President
found out about the Ellsberg
break-in long after the fact.
"We are not seeking to
impeach the President vicariously,
by reason of the acts of others by
which he had no knowledge," he
argued.
'Impossible Standards'
Wiggins also charged the
committee was setting

"impossible standards" for future
Presidents to meet. Presidents will
be expected to "anticipate what
Congress may declare abusive," he
said.
Rep. Tom Railsback, R-111.,
said during the debate over alleged
misuse of the IRS that only the
actions of then-Treasury Secretary
George Shultz and IRS
commissioner John Walters
prevented abuse of the IRS.
But Rep. Charles Sandman,
R-N.J., argued that the evidence
against Nixon on the IRS is
nothing but generalities.
The committee has yet to
consider other minor articles of
impeachment before it passes the
matter to the full House. Other
charges against the President
could include contempt of
Congress and offenses stemming
from the secret bombing of
Cambodia in 1970.

Earlier in the day, Rep. Charles
Wiggins, R-Calif., failed in his
attempt to delete a portion of the
article charging Nixon with
authorizing and permitting the
illegal operations of the
"plumbers unit."
McClory Switch
Rep. Robert McClory, R-111.,
joined a solid 27-member majority
favoring impeachment, signalling a
gain of one vote from the 27-11
margin on the first article of
impeachment voted Saturday.
In explaining his vote, McClory
said that too many crimes were
committed in the White House
and that the President had failed
the American people, as well as
the Constitution.
After its historic vote, the
committee adjourned until 7:30
a.m. PDT today. KZSU 90.1 FM
will carry those proceedings live.
Impeachment Likely
The committee's strong
showing for impeachment
strengthened speculation in
Washington that the full House
will also favor impeachment on at
least one article by a large margin.
Even one of the committee's
staunchest anti-impeachment
figures, Rep. Edward Hutchinson,
R-Mich., conceded in an interview
yesterday that the House would
probably vote to impeach Nixon.
During the debate, Wiggins
maintained that the establishment
of the "plumbers unit" was not
illegal and that the President
found out about the Ellsberg
break-in long after the fact.
"We are not seeking to
impeach the President vicariously,
by reason of the acts of others by
which he had no knowledge," he
argued.
'Impossible Standards'
Wiggins also charged the
committee was setting

"impossible standards" for future
Presidents to meet. Presidents will
be expected to "anticipate what
Congress may declare abusive," he
said.
Rep. Tom Railsback, R-111.,
said during the debate over alleged
misuse of the IRS that only the
actions of then-Treasury Secretary
George Shultz and IRS
commissioner John Walters
prevented abuse of the IRS.
But Rep. Charles Sandman,
R-N.J., argued that the evidence
against Nixon on the IRS is
nothing but generalities.
The committee has yet to
consider other minor articles of
impeachment before it passes the
matter to the full House. Other
charges against the President
could include contempt of
Congress and offenses stemming
from the secret bombing of
Cambodia in 1970.
WASHINGTON - The House
Judiciary Committee last night
voted 28-10 to approve a second
article of impeachment against
President Richard M. Nixon,
charging him with abuse of the
power of the Presidency.
The specific charges in the
article include use of the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) for
political harrassment,
participation in the Watergate
cover-up, instigation of illegal
wiretaps and the commissioning
and direction of the "plumbers
unit."

The "plumbers," a special
secret investigating team attached
to the White House, participated
in the burglaries at the
Democratic National Committee
Headquarters and at the office of
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
By approving the second
article, committee majority
members made it clear that they
feel the President has the
affirmative duty to "make clear to
his subordinates that they must
not break the law."
The second article is also based
on offenses the President "should

have known about," in the words
of committee members. Several
congressmen voiced concern that
Nixon was not "policing his
lieutenants."
A prime-time television and
radio audience saw the majority
consistently defeat Republican
minority attempts to water down
the second article, leading some
Nixon supporters on the
committee to claim the President
was being denied due process.
Some committee Republicans had
sought to limit the article only to
wrongs the President knew about

in advance.
