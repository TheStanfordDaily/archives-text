# Scientist Sees Laser As Alternative Source Of Fuel
## 
### LAURIE TREUHAFT 
In view of diminishing oil resources, laser
fusion can be an alternative energy source
"viable for a whole pattern of society," Dr.
John L. Emmett told an audience at Skilling
Auditorium last week. Emmett is head of the
Laser Fusion Division at the U.C. Radiation
Laboratory at nearby Livermore.
Emmett said that because a thermonuclear
laser is small enough to fit on the head of a
pin, it can generate "the energy equivalent of
five pounds of TNT with an explosion no
stronger than that of a cherry bomb." This
energy is obtained by combining hydrogen
atoms in the form of deuterium and tritium
to make helium.
Lasers can also efficiently concentrate
energy in time and space, Emmett said. The
laser fusion process is "energetically feasible"
because laser beams can ignite a particle
quickly and without consuming a great deal
of energy, Emmett explained.
Emmett favored laser fusion over the
other alternatives proposed by the Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy — fission and

solar energy. He said that fission plants
generate a great deal of radioactive waste and
are susceptible to accidents in time of war.
Variable Efficiency
And he explained that the efficiency of
solar energy would be variable in different
parts of the country. Solar energy also could
not be absorbed by an area of land smaller
than 25,000 square miles, as the density of
the sun's energy is "remarkably low on the
surface of the earth."
But Emmett cautioned that controlling
thermonuclear energy by laser fusion is not
as simple as was commonly and "naively"
believed in the 19605.
Emmett said for one thing, it is difficult
to obtain a uniform reaction when
illuminating a particle with laser beams. And
in the 19605, scientists did not realize the
importance of compressing this particle for
maximum energy yield.
Reduced Time?
Emmett said that presently, scientists at
Livermore, Los Alamos, N.M. and Princeton,
N.J., laboratories are trying to reduce even

further the amount of time required for a
laser to ignite a particle one millimeter in
diameter. The optimum time in which a laser
should burn a particle is 10' 9 seconds.
Emmett said that by 1985, "somebody
should achieve [this goal] in the lab and
maybe even with thermonuclear fuel."
There should be a laser fusion device in
operation by 1977, and a tenth-scale model is
scheduled to be completed by the end of this
fiscal year, he said.
Emmett cited the Atomic Energy
Commission's initial commitment of $20
million to the development of laser fusion
adding that more funding is expected.
Emmett has worked at the Cal Tech Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, as well as the Naval
Research Laboratory in Washington and at
the Stanford Research Institute.
His talk was part of a lecture series
sponsored by the Department of Aeronautics
and Astronautics here for the 1974
ASEE-NASA Summer Faculty Institute
chaired by Prof. Daniel Bershader.

Emmett said that by 1985, "somebody
should achieve [this goal] in the lab and
maybe even with thermonuclear fuel."
There should be a laser fusion device in
operation by 1977, and a tenth-scale model is
scheduled to be completed by the end of this
fiscal year, he said.
Emmett cited the Atomic Energy
Commission's initial commitment of $20
million to the development of laser fusion
adding that more funding is expected.
Emmett has worked at the Cal Tech Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, as well as the Naval
Research Laboratory in Washington and at
the Stanford Research Institute.
His talk was part of a lecture series
sponsored by the Department of Aeronautics
and Astronautics here for the 1974
ASEE-NASA Summer Faculty Institute
chaired by Prof. Daniel Bershader.

In view of diminishing oil resources, laser
fusion can be an alternative energy source
"viable for a whole pattern of society," Dr.
John L. Emmett told an audience at Skilling
Auditorium last week. Emmett is head of the
Laser Fusion Division at the U.C. Radiation
Laboratory at nearby Livermore.
Emmett said that because a thermonuclear
laser is small enough to fit on the head of a
pin, it can generate "the energy equivalent of
five pounds of TNT with an explosion no
stronger than that of a cherry bomb." This
energy is obtained by combining hydrogen
atoms in the form of deuterium and tritium
to make helium.
Lasers can also efficiently concentrate
energy in time and space, Emmett said. The
laser fusion process is "energetically feasible"
because laser beams can ignite a particle
quickly and without consuming a great deal
of energy, Emmett explained.
Emmett favored laser fusion over the
other alternatives proposed by the Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy — fission and

solar energy. He said that fission plants
generate a great deal of radioactive waste and
are susceptible to accidents in time of war.
Variable Efficiency
And he explained that the efficiency of
solar energy would be variable in different
parts of the country. Solar energy also could
not be absorbed by an area of land smaller
than 25,000 square miles, as the density of
the sun's energy is "remarkably low on the
surface of the earth."
But Emmett cautioned that controlling
thermonuclear energy by laser fusion is not
as simple as was commonly and "naively"
believed in the 19605.
Emmett said for one thing, it is difficult
to obtain a uniform reaction when
illuminating a particle with laser beams. And
in the 19605, scientists did not realize the
importance of compressing this particle for
maximum energy yield.
Reduced Time?
Emmett said that presently, scientists at
Livermore, Los Alamos, N.M. and Princeton,
N.J., laboratories are trying to reduce even

further the amount of time required for a
laser to ignite a particle one millimeter in
diameter. The optimum time in which a laser
should burn a particle is 10' 9 seconds.
Emmett said that by 1985, "somebody
should achieve [this goal] in the lab and
maybe even with thermonuclear fuel."
