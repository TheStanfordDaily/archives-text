## Becky Hobbs' Fancy First

Here's golden-haired Becky
Hobbs smiling at you,
ultra-brightly, from the cover of
her first record. She's 24, from
Bartlesville, Oklahoma, where
nothing but oil has ever come
from before.

She came to Los Angeles to
make it as a singer; so now she's
recorded her record and is smiling
like a beauty queen on the cover,
her denim jacket covered with
gold spangles at the cuff, collar
and pocket. Is this the real Becky
Hobbs? It's doubtful, just as the
material on her album is doubtful
in revealing what kind of a
songstress Hobbs is.
It's a fancy album, recorded at
four separate studios, with the
famous Memphis Homs providing
backing. Some famous Southern
session men also sit in, like Pete
Carr, who played on Ringo Starr's
country-western album among
others. But Hobbs isn't
country-western, although
according to her publicity she has

a "Southern-gusty, soul-tinged
voice."
She and her guitarist Lewis
Anderson wrote 11 of the 12
songs on the album, many
sounding closer to Aretha
Franklin than C-W queen Tammy
Wynette. Hobbs admits Aretha is
one of her major musical
influences, but at times she
sounds a bit like Bette Midler and
Carly Simon as well.
On this debut album, Becky
Hobbs emerges as a down-home
person looking for a more
down-to-earth, less glittery style,
without the emphasis on horns,
si tars and congas that dominates
throughout at the expense of her
voice.
