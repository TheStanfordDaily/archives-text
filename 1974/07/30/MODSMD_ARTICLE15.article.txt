## Cold Blood Delivers 'Lydia' 
### 
Cold Blood
Lydia
Warner Bros. BS 2806
The grabbing, gutsy voice belts
out the words, "I got to have a
one-woman man," and no one
could possibly argue that a man
being serenaded by Lydia Pense
would need more than one
woman.
Lydia is the title and the
driving force behind Cold Blood's
latest album, and her band has
added a few more songs to the
five-album set which so
eloquently tells what it's like to
be a hard-lovin' woman, 1970s
style.

Lydia continues the trend
toward smooth studio
arrangements and biggest-of-big
brass that started with Cold
Blood's last release, Thriller.
Unfortunately, the many horns
and the backup vocals clutter the
audio landscape in places, the
worst example of this being "I
Only Wanted Someone to Hear
Me," which should have stayed a
simple ballad.
Where Lydia's big voice breaks
through the generally excellent
instrumental, the effect is
astounding. "When My Love Hand
Comes Down" shows off Lydia's
incredible range and power, while

"You're Free Lovin' Me" conveys
the aforementioned message to
men who are only interested in
free love, a message Lydia delivers
with both sauce and conviction.
Add to these: "When It's
Over," a blues tune spiked with
Cold Blood's cocky sycopation;
"Consideration," a funky,
down-home love song; and "Just
Like Sunshine," a mellow, flute
accompanied ballad — there isn't a
bad cut on the whole album.
If you're new to the Bay Area
sounds, Lydia — the album and *
the woman — is a good place to
start.

LOOK OUT—Lydia Pense and Cold Blood have just released their
fifth album on Warner Brothers, aptly titled Lydia. Although marred
in places by too much studio backup work, Lydia delivers a lot of
lusty rock for your money — Lydia sings just as good as she looks.
