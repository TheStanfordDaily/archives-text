Connally Indicted In Milk Deal
WASHINGTON — Former Treasury Secretary John B.
Connally was indicted yesterday on charges of accepting a
bribe from milk producers and then lying about it to a
federal grand jury.
Connally is the fourth member of President Nixon's
Cabinet to be indicted.
A Watergate grand jury charged Connally with two
counts of accepting bribery, one count of conspiracy to
commit perjury and to obstruct justice, and two counts of
perjury. The jury also indicted Jake Jacobsen, a longtime
Connally aide.
The panel said Jacobsen, an attorney for the group of
milk producers, offered Connally $10,000 to be donated
either to candidates for public office or for a "Democrats
for Nixon" group headed by Connally.
The grand jury said Connally accepted the money,
which was donated in order to influence a 1971 increase in
milk price supports.
From his Houston office, Connally denied all charges.
The former Texas governor and longtime friend of former
President Lyndon Johnson switched from the Democratic
to Republican party last year and was frequently named as
a 1976 Presidential hopeful.
Speaking in San Francisco, Vice President Gerald Ford
said Connally's indictment was a "tragedy." Ford said
Connally's "political chances should depend on what
happens when he is brought to trial," and that he should
not be barred for consideration for the Presidential
nomination just because he was indicted.
Greece, Turkey Near Cyprus Accord
GENEVA — Ministers from Britain, Greece and Turkey
expressed hope yesterday that an agreement on troop
withdrawals from Cyprus would be reached soon.
The three countries concluded 31 straight hours of
negotiation yesterday, and were reported close to an
agreement. Last-minute objections by Turkey have
delayed a settlement.
Meanwhile, the Soviet ambassador to the United
Nations Security Council demanded that the U.N. send a
special mission to Cyprus to enforce the week-old cease
fire.
The Soviets also demanded the withdrawal of all

foreign troops and the reinstatement of deposed President
Archbishop Makarios. The Turkish government favors a
phased withdrawal of troops and neither Mediterranean
country has yet said it would agree to a return to
Makarios-ruled government.
Makarios yesterday praised the U.S.'s "increasingly
constructive" role at the Geneva talks, after concluding a
meeting with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The U.S.
and U.S.S.R. have sent observers to the negotiations.
Reinecke Decision 4 ln One Week'
SACRAMENTO — State Attorney General Evelle
Younger said yesterday that he will render a formal
opinion on whether Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke can legally
remain in office within one week.
Reinecke was convicted Saturday on a perjury charge in
connection with the ITT scandal. He affirmed yesterday in
Washington that he would not resign from his $35,000 a
year job unless forced to by law.
Younger told newsmen that Gov. Ronald Reagan had
asked him to make a ruling in the Reinecke case.
According to California law, public office must be vacated
after conviction for a felony, but conviction becomes
official only after sentencing.
Reinecke is set to be sentenced August 30. He has
appealed the conviction.
Meanwhile, the People's Lobby, a state political activist
group, may be in the process of filing a suit to stop
payment of Reinecke's salary. Spokesmen for the group
said yesterday that the conviction automatically
disqualifies Reinecke from keeping his position and
collecting his salary.
First Women Priests Ordained
PHILADELPHIA — The first women ever to become
priests of the Episcopal Church in the United States were
ordained yesterday by four bishops who face dismissal for
their actions.
Eleven woman deacons were ordained before an
overflow crowd in a church in North Philadelphia.
Among those in the crowd of 1500 was the head
executive director of the American Church Union, an
organization of Episcopal bishops. He called the action
"theologically, ecclestiastically and canonically void."

Brown, Flournoy Reach Agreement
LOS ANGELES — The two major candidates for
governor of California have agreed to limit expenditures
and make a total of six joint appearances or debates, it was
announced yesterday.
Democrat Edmund Brown Jr., and Republican Houston
Flournoy set a limit of $900,000 on spending for TV,
radio and periodical advertisements, statewide mailings,
recorded telephone messages and billboards.
They also agreed to hold six joint appearances late in
the campaign, including televised debates on Oct. 8 and
Nov. 2.
The agreement was reached after four weeks of
negotiations by attorneys for the two candidates.
Greek Government Fires Officials
ATHENS — The new Greek civilian regime of
Constantine Karamanlis yesterday fired all its senior
Cabinet officials and county administrators.
Karamanlis' move was interpreted as an attempt to get
rid of all officials appointed by the military junta which
ruled Greece for seven years before stepping down last
week.
Officials say that from now on county and national
officials will be recruited from among the senior judges
and civil servants.
Reporter Farr Sentenced, Fined
LOS ANGELES — Reporter William Farr, in and out of
jail in recent months for his refusal to release news sources
was sentenced yesterday to a maximum of five days in jail
and a fine of $500.
Superior Court Judge Charles Older ruled that Farr was
"holding himself above the law" in his three-year fight
against court orders to reveal sources of a leak concerning
the controversial Charles Manson trial in 1970.
Older stayed Farr's sentence pending appeal to the U.S.
Ninth District Court of Appeals.

Constantine Karamanlis yesterday fired all its senior
Cabinet officials and county administrators.
Karamanlis' move was interpreted as an attempt to get
rid of all officials appointed by the military junta which
ruled Greece for seven years before stepping down last
week.
Officials say that from now on county and national
officials will be recruited from among the senior judges
and civil servants.
Reporter Farr Sentenced, Fined
LOS ANGELES — Reporter William Farr, in and out of
jail in recent months for his refusal to release news sources
was sentenced yesterday to a maximum of five days in jail
and a fine of $500.
Superior Court Judge Charles Older ruled that Farr was
"holding himself above the law" in his three-year fight
against court orders to reveal sources of a leak concerning
the controversial Charles Manson trial in 1970.
Older stayed Farr's sentence pending appeal to the U.S.
Ninth District Court of Appeals.

Connally Indicted In Milk Deal
WASHINGTON — Former Treasury Secretary John B.
Connally was indicted yesterday on charges of accepting a
bribe from milk producers and then lying about it to a
federal grand jury.
Connally is the fourth member of President Nixon's
Cabinet to be indicted.
A Watergate grand jury charged Connally with two
counts of accepting bribery, one count of conspiracy to
commit perjury and to obstruct justice, and two counts of
perjury. The jury also indicted Jake Jacobsen, a longtime
Connally aide.
The panel said Jacobsen, an attorney for the group of
milk producers, offered Connally $10,000 to be donated
either to candidates for public office or for a "Democrats
for Nixon" group headed by Connally.
The grand jury said Connally accepted the money,
which was donated in order to influence a 1971 increase in
milk price supports.
From his Houston office, Connally denied all charges.
The former Texas governor and longtime friend of former
President Lyndon Johnson switched from the Democratic
to Republican party last year and was frequently named as
a 1976 Presidential hopeful.
Speaking in San Francisco, Vice President Gerald Ford
said Connally's indictment was a "tragedy." Ford said
Connally's "political chances should depend on what
happens when he is brought to trial," and that he should
not be barred for consideration for the Presidential
nomination just because he was indicted.
Greece, Turkey Near Cyprus Accord
GENEVA — Ministers from Britain, Greece and Turkey
expressed hope yesterday that an agreement on troop
withdrawals from Cyprus would be reached soon.
The three countries concluded 31 straight hours of
negotiation yesterday, and were reported close to an
agreement. Last-minute objections by Turkey have
delayed a settlement.
Meanwhile, the Soviet ambassador to the United
Nations Security Council demanded that the U.N. send a
special mission to Cyprus to enforce the week-old cease
fire.
The Soviets also demanded the withdrawal of all

foreign troops and the reinstatement of deposed President
Archbishop Makarios. The Turkish government favors a
phased withdrawal of troops and neither Mediterranean
country has yet said it would agree to a return to
Makarios-ruled government.
Makarios yesterday praised the U.S.'s "increasingly
constructive" role at the Geneva talks, after concluding a
meeting with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The U.S.
and U.S.S.R. have sent observers to the negotiations.
Reinecke Decision 4 ln One Week'
SACRAMENTO — State Attorney General Evelle
Younger said yesterday that he will render a formal
opinion on whether Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke can legally
remain in office within one week.
Reinecke was convicted Saturday on a perjury charge in
connection with the ITT scandal. He affirmed yesterday in
Washington that he would not resign from his $35,000 a
year job unless forced to by law.
Younger told newsmen that Gov. Ronald Reagan had
asked him to make a ruling in the Reinecke case.
According to California law, public office must be vacated
after conviction for a felony, but conviction becomes
official only after sentencing.
Reinecke is set to be sentenced August 30. He has
appealed the conviction.
Meanwhile, the People's Lobby, a state political activist
group, may be in the process of filing a suit to stop
payment of Reinecke's salary. Spokesmen for the group
said yesterday that the conviction automatically
disqualifies Reinecke from keeping his position and
collecting his salary.
First Women Priests Ordained
PHILADELPHIA — The first women ever to become
priests of the Episcopal Church in the United States were

their actions.
Eleven woman deacons were ordained before an

Among those in the crowd of 1500 was the head
executive director of the American Church Union, an
organization of Episcopal bishops. He called the action
"theologically, ecclestiastically and canonically void."

Greek Government Fires Officials
ATHENS — The new Greek civilian regime of
Constantine Karamanlis yesterday fired all its senior
Cabinet officials and county administrators.
Karamanlis' move was interpreted as an attempt to get
rid of all officials appointed by the military junta which
ruled Greece for seven years before stepping down last
week.
Officials say that from now on county and national
officials will be recruited from among the senior judges
and civil servants.
Reporter Farr Sentenced, Fined
LOS ANGELES — Reporter William Farr, in and out of
jail in recent months for his refusal to release news sources
was sentenced yesterday to a maximum of five days in jail
and a fine of $500.
Superior Court Judge Charles Older ruled that Farr was
"holding himself above the law" in his three-year fight
against court orders to reveal sources of a leak concerning
the controversial Charles Manson trial in 1970.
Older stayed Farr's sentence pending appeal to the U.S.
Ninth District Court of Appeals.
Today's Weather

Connally Indicted In Milk Deal
WASHINGTON — Former Treasury Secretary John B.
Connally was indicted yesterday on charges of accepting a
bribe from milk producers and then lying about it to a
federal grand jury.
Connally is the fourth member of President Nixon's
Cabinet to be indicted.
A Watergate grand jury charged Connally with two
counts of accepting bribery, one count of conspiracy to
commit perjury and to obstruct justice, and two counts of
perjury. The jury also indicted Jake Jacobsen, a longtime
Connally aide.
The panel said Jacobsen, an attorney for the group of
milk producers, offered Connally $10,000 to be donated
either to candidates for public office or for a "Democrats
for Nixon" group headed by Connally.
The grand jury said Connally accepted the money,
which was donated in order to influence a 1971 increase in
milk price supports.
From his Houston office, Connally denied all charges.
The former Texas governor and longtime friend of former
President Lyndon Johnson switched from the Democratic
to Republican party last year and was frequently named as
a 1976 Presidential hopeful.
Speaking in San Francisco, Vice President Gerald Ford
said Connally's indictment was a "tragedy." Ford said
Connally's "political chances should depend on what
happens when he is brought to trial," and that he should
not be barred for consideration for the Presidential
nomination just because he was indicted.
Greece, Turkey Near Cyprus Accord
GENEVA — Ministers from Britain, Greece and Turkey
expressed hope yesterday that an agreement on troop
withdrawals from Cyprus would be reached soon.
The three countries concluded 31 straight hours of
negotiation yesterday, and were reported close to an
agreement. Last-minute objections by Turkey have
delayed a settlement.
Meanwhile, the Soviet ambassador to the United
Nations Security Council demanded that the U.N. send a
special mission to Cyprus to enforce the week-old cease
fire.
The Soviets also demanded the withdrawal of all

foreign troops and the reinstatement of deposed President
Archbishop Makarios. The Turkish government favors a
phased withdrawal of troops and neither Mediterranean
country has yet said it would agree to a return to
Makarios-ruled government.
Makarios yesterday praised the U.S.'s "increasingly
constructive" role at the Geneva talks, after concluding a
meeting with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The U.S.
and U.S.S.R. have sent observers to the negotiations.
Reinecke Decision 4 ln One Week'
SACRAMENTO — State Attorney General Evelle
Younger said yesterday that he will render a formal
opinion on whether Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke can legally
remain in office within one week.
Reinecke was convicted Saturday on a perjury charge in
connection with the ITT scandal. He affirmed yesterday in
Washington that he would not resign from his $35,000 a
year job unless forced to by law.
Younger told newsmen that Gov. Ronald Reagan had
asked him to make a ruling in the Reinecke case.
According to California law, public office must be vacated
after conviction for a felony, but conviction becomes
official only after sentencing.
Reinecke is set to be sentenced August 30. He has
appealed the conviction.
Meanwhile, the People's Lobby, a state political activist
group, may be in the process of filing a suit to stop
payment of Reinecke's salary. Spokesmen for the group
said yesterday that the conviction automatically
disqualifies Reinecke from keeping his position and
collecting his salary.
