# Kaplan Speaks On Impeachment
## 'Can Acquit Even If Guilty' 
### RICHARD HUTTON 
If Senators believe "the better
interests of the country are
served" by the acquittal of
President Nixon in the pending
impeachment, they "certainly
have a legitimate moral right to
vote for acquittal even if they
believe the President is guilty,"
Law Prof. John Kaplan said last
week.
"A jury has a power to acquit a
defendant even if it believes he is
technically guilty," Kaplan told
the full house in the Tresidder
lounges.
Kaplan dismissed the "legal
implications" of Watergate, the
publicized subject of his speech,
as "too broad, general and
unknowable." Instead, he chose
to discuss the legal issues and the
logistics of impeachment.
Kaplan posed hypothetical
situations in which the Senate
might opt for acquittal of the
President over a legitimate
conviction.
One such situation would
occur in the last month of a
President's administration. A
conviction at that time might
bring about two changes in office
within weeks (the Vice President,
then the newly-elected President).
'Incompetent' Veep
Another reason for acquittal,
according to Kaplan, might be
that the Senate viewed the Vice
President as a "hopeless,
incompetent crook" and thus
more of a threat to the country
than the President.
Kaplan said President Nixon is
apparently liable under the "high
crimes and misdemeanors" clause
of the impeachment article. The
House Majority Committee
Council has adopted the "broader,
abuse of power" interpretation of
the clause.
'Middle Ground'
Kaplan said the president's fate
rests on a "middle ground — abuse
of power," not on Nixon's
attorneys' "narrow reading" of
the clause as meaning criminal
offenses or on any crass political
