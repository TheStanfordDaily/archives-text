# Kaplan Speaks On Impeachment
## 'Can Acquit Even If Guilty' 
### RICHARD HUTTON 
If Senators believe "the better
interests of the country are
served" by the acquittal of
President Nixon in the pending
impeachment, they "certainly
have a legitimate moral right to
vote for acquittal even if they
believe the President is guilty,"
Law Prof. John Kaplan said last
week.
"A jury has a power to acquit a
defendant even if it believes he is
technically guilty," Kaplan told
the full house in the Tresidder
lounges.
Kaplan dismissed the "legal
implications" of Watergate, the
publicized subject of his speech,
as "too broad, general and
unknowable." Instead, he chose
to discuss the legal issues and the
logistics of impeachment.
Kaplan posed hypothetical
situations in which the Senate
might opt for acquittal of the
President over a legitimate
conviction.
One such situation would
occur in the last month of a
President's administration. A
conviction at that time might
bring about two changes in office
within weeks (the Vice President,
then the newly-elected President).
'Incompetent' Veep
Another reason for acquittal,
according to Kaplan, might be
that the Senate viewed the Vice
President as a "hopeless,
incompetent crook" and thus
more of a threat to the country
than the President.
Kaplan said President Nixon is
apparently liable under the "high
crimes and misdemeanors" clause
of the impeachment article. The
House Majority Committee
Council has adopted the "broader,
abuse of power" interpretation of
the clause.
'Middle Ground'
Kaplan said the president's fate
rests on a "middle ground — abuse
of power," not on Nixon's
attorneys' "narrow reading" of
the clause as meaning criminal
offenses or on any crass political

impeachment. He discussed many hypothetical cases in which
impeachment might not be advisable.

desires of Congress.
"The contention of the
L Constitutional] framers and
subsequent [impeachment]
actions have indicated fairly
strongly that we do not need a
criminal offense for
impeachment," Kaplan said.
"The problem is simple in its
starkest form — you want to have
a frame of thought that the
President of the United States

should not be removed lightly by
the impeachment process, but on
the other hand, you don't have to
find a crime."
'Clear, Convincing Evidence'
Both House Committee
Counsel John Doar and
Presidential Counsel James St.
Clair have agreed to "clear and
convincing evidence" as the House
impeaching standard, Kaplan said.
The manner of proceedings has
also been decided — a synthesis of
grand jury and civil trial practices.
The defendant, as in a regular
trial, will be allowed to have his
attorney present and to rebut the
prosecution's testimony, Kaplan
said. However, the defendant will
not be able to call witnesses or to
cross-examine.

"What the House did, it did in
good faith," said Kaplan,
attempting to dispel claims
partisan tactics by the
Representatives. "But I would
have given more rights to the
defendant," he added.
Congress may entreat the
courts to enforce its subpoenas,
Kaplan said, referring to Nixon's
refusal to comply with
Congressional subpoenas.
However, the courts must
restrict themselves to the legalistic
aspect of the subpoenas without
treading near the impeachment
process, he added.
