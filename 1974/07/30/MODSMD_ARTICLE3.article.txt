# Shumway Testifies On Brain Death
## 
### 
Stanford heart surgeon Dr. Norman Shumway
was back in court Friday testifying that brain death
should be the single criterion for the
pronouncement of death.
For the second time in three months Shumway
was asked to testify on the definition of death in
relation to heart transplants he performed on
persons who were judged dead because their brain
had ceased functioning.
Shumway testified before Sonoma County
Superior Court Judge Joseph Murphy in Santa Rosa
in a case involving 23-year-old Jose Flores who is
charged with vehicular manslaughter in the death of
a 12-year-old girl last September.
Flores was driving a car which collided with a
van in which Colenda Ward was riding. Ward was
first taken to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital where
a neurosurgeon determined that she had suffered
massive and irreparable brain damage.
She was transferred to Stanford Medical Center,
where three physicians determined that she
suffered "brain death" though her heart and
respiration were still functioning through the me of
machines. Shumway and his transplant team
removed her heart and implanted it into a
43-year-old Arizona man, who is still living.

Public Defender Ralph Lopez has argued that
Flores cannot be guilty of manslaughter because
Ward was not legally dead when her heart was
removed.
Flores has entered a guilty plea to a felony
drunk driving charge stemming from the accident
and has agreed to stipulate the truth of the facts of
the accident as presented by the defense.
Thus the only issue is whether the injuries
resulting from the accident or the removing of the
heart caused Ward's death.
Dr. John W. Hanbery, head of the University's
department of neurosurgery preceded Shumway on
the witness stand, saying that the brain is the organ
that should be used to determine when death
occured. Hanbery was a member of the panel of
doctors who declared Ward dead.
In a similar case also involving Shumway, an
Oakland man was found guilty of manslaughter
of a person whose heart was transplanted
after he was judged dead by brain-death standards.
That case is now being appealed.
Shumway's remarks concluded the testimony in
the case. Final arguments will be heard Friday,
after which the case will go to the jury.
