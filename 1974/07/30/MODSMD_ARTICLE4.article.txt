# Layoff Notices Sent To TMU Cafe Workers
## 
### 
Layoff notices were mailed
Thursday to over 30 Tresidder
Union cafeteria employees
following a final decision to close
down the cafeteria August 17 and
convert to a fast-food format by
September.
The decision was made by TDS
Inc., the private firm operating
the cafeteria, after receiving a
directive from the University
earlier this year to resolve the
financial problems of the cafeteria
operation.
The cafeteria has been
operating at over $100,000 in the
red. "We notified them some time
ago that the debts were serious
and that they had to come up
with some solution," said Assoc.
Dean for Student Affairs Dan
Williams.
United Stanford Employees
(USE) President Jim Berk said the
decision was "madness" and that
"if they layoff people and convert
to fast food, there will be hell to
pay." Berk said the union is
currently considering a boycott of
the cafeteria.
USE is interested in the
cafeteria layoffs since a bargaining
unit including the cafeteria
workers will vote August 8, on
whether or not to have USE
represent them in the future.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said, "We dislike having to
agree that the TDS layoffs are
necessary. It is a disheartening
process to go through."
TDS and the University have
said they will help laid-off
workers find alternate
employment. Berk said yesterday
this was "a lot of nonsense" and
that there were no appropriate
vacancies on campus.
