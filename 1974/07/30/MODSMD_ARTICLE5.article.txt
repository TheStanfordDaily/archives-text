It seems that all too often the University makes a major policy
decision without consultation with those persons who will be affected
by it.
This summer's example of lack of consideration is the handling of
the proposed modification of Tresidder Memorial Union. The
University and its subcontractor, TDS, Inc., have decided to close the
cafeteria and open an El Camino-like fast-food restaurant without
consultation with the students and staff who patronize Tresidder.
Their only justification for the switch to fast-food is offered by a
survey taken spring quarter which both the University and TDS refuse
to release. One recalls that this tactic of releasing only pieces of salient
evidence is also used by a President who now faces impeachment.
We agree with Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons that no more
of our tuition money should be sunk into a deficit-plagued cafeteria.
We think that his argument that the cafeteria is outmoded and must
be closed may well be valid.
But we feel that the format now planned would leave a gaping void
in the choice of on-campus food offered. We think that the Stanford
community will miss such items as salads and pastries — items which,
if offered in the correct way could earn profits as well as serve the
needs of the community.
In order to determine which items are needed and profitable,
executives can not merely sit at their desks and read surveys.
They must actively seek the ideas of the community and proceed
with full knowledge of the ideas of those affected by decisions.
We note an improvement in University-student relations since
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton has begun actively
soliciting student input in housing matters. Other University officials
should follow Horton's lead.
We strongly urge that Lyons and TMU General Manager Gordon
Starr hold public hearings on the modification of Tresidder before a
decision is made.
