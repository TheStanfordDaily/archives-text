Pakistan Support
Editor:
Your reference to the
American support of Pakistan in
the Bangladesh war in your
editorial about Cypress has
prompted me to express my views
on this matter.
Obviously your views are based
on the assumption that there was
a genocide being committed on
the Bengalies. Why were the
Americans supporting the military
rulers of Pakistan?
Sir, these past three years have
proved beyond doubt that the
American support was based on
equity and justice. It has also been
proven beyond doubt that the
reports . on the atrocities
committed by the Pakistan army
were unfounded and biased.
Had they been true the Prime

Minister of Pakistan (as reported
by your media) would not be
welcomed by milling crowds only
last month in Dacca. Would Hitler
have dared enter Israel in 1948?
Besides the whole world is
aware as to how popular the
so-called liberators of Bangladesh
are in that tiny nation today.
Finally I would say that the
creation of Bangladesh was the
outcome of a military government
failing in its attempt to find a
political solution and a neighbor
who got the opportunity of a
life-time to undo Pakistan.

'Death Cult'
Editor:
The second objection Bill Evers
raises in his letter in the July 26
Daily to an argument against the
death penalty is that it is
"sloganeering" to call "righteous
anger" that demands death for
death "blood lust."
But if "the victim or his heirs,"
lusting not for blood but for pure
righteousness, will not "forgive
the criminal" who is unkilled, that
is, if atonement demands ritual
expiation resembling human
sacrifice, moral sentiments are
demeaned to mechanisms of
destruction, like machine pistols.
The criminal justice system
meant to protect civilization, in
abetting such exactions teaches a
barbarian death cult. The process
horrifies the more when applied
to a man so young that he might
easily come to deserve forgiveness
while yet in life.
Moreover, if blood lust is
denied, granting only to victim or
heirs the power to forgive or
condemn is not even rational.
Have we not all equal interest in
righteousness? Let us have
plebescites on each sentence, in

cold-blooded indignation.

Lecture Notes
Editor:
I would like to clarify one
point made in the front-page
article of the July 26th Daily
entitled "Extensive Remodeling
Planned For TMU," written by
Don Cox and Viae Kershner.
In the article, TMU General
Manager Gordon Starr was quoted
as indicating that the A.S.S.U.
Lecture Note Service was one of
possible uses to which extra space,
produced by the potential switch
from the Tresidder Cafeteria to a
fast-food format, might go.
It should be made clear that
space has already been designated
for the Service by the ASSU
President and the Student
Financial Manager in the area of
the A.S.S.U. office now being
used by the Action Research
Liason Office (ARLO).
The importance of the
Service's space independence is
obvious. This will be a student-run
project, in no way beholden to
anyone other than the student
body itself.
Mike Herman
ASSU President
Tresidder Service
Editor:
Last fall after taking classes on
campus, I sent a note of
compliments to the management
at Tresidder for the delicious
meals with fast and courteous
service at fair prices.
In this present service you now
have what is virtually an
"endangered species." If it is
diminished, as far as food and
drink are concerned, Stanford
University will be just another
stop along the El Camino.
Best wishes.
