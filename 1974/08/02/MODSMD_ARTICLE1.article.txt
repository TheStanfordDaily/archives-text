# Residents Protest Escondido 'Freeze'
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Two couples without children
in Escondido Village began
complaining bitterly yesterday
because they were not notified
about a housing transfer "freeze"
which began last May.
Before May, childless couples
living in one-bedroom apartments
had been allowed to fill vacancies
in two-bedroom complexes if no
couples with children applied for
the spaces.
The freeze, which was
instituted so the University could
"re-evaluate the housing situation
in the Village," has effectively
stopped all transfers, according to
Susan Swaringen, special assistant
to the dean of student affairs for
Escondido Village.
Yet, 38 Village couples on
transfer waiting lists have not
been notified.
No Notice
Village resident Paul Supton, a
law student who first learned of
the policy last week, charged that
the freeze is unfair because no
official notice of the policy was
ever given.
"People who are hit directly
are getting screwed without
having their opinions canvassed,"
said Supton.
Another resident, law student
Michael Lindsey, supported
Supton's claim.
More Likely?
Lindsey said he and his wife
turned down a cottage in Menlo
Park, because they were told by
the Village housing office that
they could probably move into
the two-bedroom complexes
during the summer.
It now appears likely the
Lindseys will remain in their
one-bedroom place at least until
winter quarter.
Escondido Village director
Alan Cummings acknowledged
that students on waiting lists
should have been notified of the
freeze, and he apologized.
However, Cummings pointed
out that regardless of the freeze,
the 38 waiting-list couples would
not have been allowed to transfer
after mid-May.
Larger Problem
The problem is part of a much
larger one, Cummings explained.
In addition to the 38 couples
waiting to transfer, there are 150
off-campus couples with children
waiting on another list to enter
the two-bedroom units.
But the Escondido Village
housing office estimates only 100
vacancies for the fall, Cummings
added. Neither waiting-list group
has been notified of this situation
either.
When asked if officials would
give special consideration to the
waiting-list couples who had never
been notified of the freeze or the
current shortage, Swaringen said,
"I'd like to say yes, but the

complexes which were originally
built to house students with
families, must go to them, because
there is a greater need."
The office will shortly send out
a letter explaining the situation,
Swaringen said.
Meeting Monday
In addition, officials have
invited all interested parties to
discuss the situation at a meeting
Monday at 10:30 a.m. of
University and Escondido Village
officials and residents in the Dean
of Student Affairs office.
The purpose of the meeting is
to discuss the final draft for a
policy change which will effect
the entire Village, Cummings said.
One proposed feature of the
new policy is allowing
post-graduates with families
preference over couples without
children.
Supton objected to this policy
change, saying that post-graduates
often get a "substantial stipend
from the University" and so
should be forced to compete for
housing in the stiffer Palo Alto
market.
However, Swaringen pointed
out that post-graduates are
considered students for the
purpose of housing, and the
University never awards a stipend
unless sufficient need can be
demonstrated.
