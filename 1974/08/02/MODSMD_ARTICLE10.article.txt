# Convicted Murderer Formally Sentenced To Death
## 
### 
John Kreuter, convicted slayer of a Palo Alto woman at the
Stanford Shopping Center, was formally sentenced to die in the
gas chamber Tuesday, and was hussled off to San Quentin
Prison's death row.
His execution date will be set pending an automatic appeal of
his conviction to the California Supreme Court, Superior Court
Judge Frank Piombo said.
Kreuter, the second person in California to be sentenced to
death under the state's new capital punishment law, was
convicted in June of first degree murder in the killing of Liana
Hughes.
Hughes, 30, vanished from the shopping center last Jan. 29.
Six days later, her body was found in her camper parked in a
Burlingame municipal parking lot.
An autopsy disclosed that she died of strychnine poisoning,
administered one day before she was found.
