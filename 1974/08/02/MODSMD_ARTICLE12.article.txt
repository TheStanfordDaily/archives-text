Festival by 'Daily' resident jazz
critic Dan Forte.)

CONCORD—The sixth annual
Concord Summer Festival opened
last weekend with some of the
world's finest jazz musicians met
by the largest crowds in the
festival's history.
Opening night began on one of
the highest notes possible with the
Ruby Braff-George Bames
Quartet.
With Braff on comet and
Barnes on lead guitar, backed only
by Michael Moore on bass and
Wayne Wright on rhythm guitar,
this was without a doubt the mo6t
tasteful music to be heard in the
three nights.

This lightly-swinging quartet —
sounding a bit like Django
Reinhardt's drummerless French
quintet of the 30s and 40s —
played over a dozen tunes, nearly
all written by George Gershwin.
Among their beautiful
performances were respectful
renditions of "Somebody Loves
me," "Embraceable You," "Love
Walked In," and "S'Wonderful."
Best Number
The group's best number by far
was Duke Ellington's "Rockin' In
Rhythm," with the four somehow
sounding as powerful as the
Ellington Orchestra itself.
The balance of Friday night's
show featured French
composer-arranger-pianist Michel
Legrand and his 40-piece
orchestra, in a program made up

entirely of Legrand's own works.
Much of the two-part set
featured what Legrand is most
famous for, motion picture
themes, such as "The Summer of
'42," "Windmills of Your Mind,"
and "Brian's Song." Whether or
not it's jazz is debatable, but
irrelevant as well; it was beautiful
music, whatever you choose to
call it.
One of the best selections by
the orchestra was "A Bit of Bach"
which juxtaposed Bach themes
(with horns and strings) with
Legrand's jazz piano.
Replacement
Midway through the set, the
orchestra was replaced by three
great jazz veterans; guitarist Herb
Ellis, bassist Ray Brown (both
formerly of Oscar Peterson's trio),
and drummer John Rae.
With Legrand's phenomenal
composing and arranging feats, his
ability as a jazz pianist is
sometimes overlooked. This
format, which included a nice
version of Miles Davis' "All

Blues," proved that Legrand's
playing ranks with the best.
The only low spots in
Legrand's set were the vocals, by
Legrand (not all that
well-endowed vocally) and/or
Mary Phillips, whose voice was as
overstaged as her gestures.
Saturday night began with
some beautiful classical guitar by
Brazil's Laurindo Almeida.
Unfortunately, much of Almeida's
music was lost due to the rudeness
of much of the crowd who were
not yet finished with their
picnicking and conversing.
What was missed by the
picnickers (and, unavoidably,
those seated near them) was
Almeida, with Ray Brown,
drummer Shelly Manne, and Bud
Shank on flute and sax playing
mostly classical and bossa nova
pieces extremely well.
Their best selection was Luiz
Bonfa's "Manha de Carnaval,"
from Black Orpheus, featuring
Shank's flute.
Following was Louie Bellson's

Big Band, later to be joined by
Bellson's wife, Pearl Bailey.
Unfortunately, Bellson's
segment was cut short, and Pearl's
set was drawn out a bit too long.
Fine Drummer
Bellson's band, besides
featuring the leader, one of
jazzdom's finest drummers,
included such notables as
trumpeter Blue Mitchell (formerly
of Horace Silver's group, more
recently known for his work with
John Mayall), pianist Nat Pierce,
and bassist (you guessed it) Ray
Brown.
After a few high-powered
tunes, like "Spacin' Home,"
"Time Check," and "Back
Home," Pearlie Mae made her
festival debut to the tune of
Charlie Chaplin's "Smile."
As Pearl herself said, she is not
a great singer like say Ella
Fitzgerald, but she is an
entertainer, and there is no
question she gives an audience its
money's worth. She sang, talked,
jived, and danced for nearly an
hour and a half, including a half
dozen encores.
Easily the highlight of her set
was her beautiful treatment of the
ballad "Here's That Rainy Day."
Too much of the rest of the set
was made up of weak
arrangements of weak songs, like
"Joy To the World" and "Put
Your Hand in the Hand."
The festival resumes this
Friday with the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band, Herb Ellis-Ray Brown
Quintet, and the Bill Berry Big
Band.
