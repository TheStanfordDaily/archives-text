House Leaders Plan Floor Debate
WASHINGTON — The leadership of the House of
Representatives yesterday continued to plan for debate on
three articles of impeachment against President Nixon.
Democratic Whip B.F. Sisk, D—Ca., said the group
tentatively agreed to begin debate August 19, with a vote
on the first article expected August 26 or 27. The House
leaders hope to end debate by the end of the month.
The leaders also agreed on a rule for debate permitting
motions to strike individual paragraphs from the articles,
but not allowing changes in the language approved by the
Judiciary Committee.
The House Republican leader, John Rhodes, R—Ariz.,
called a press conference for Monday at which he will
announce his decision on whether to support
impeachment.
Observers say Rhodes is likely to back impeachment.
Rhodes said he would resign his post as minority leader,
which he won last year after Gerald Ford resigned to
become Vice President, if he cannot support the President.
Ford, meanwhile, discussed his own role in Nixon's
defense strategy with White House Chief of Staff
Alexander Haig yesterday.
The San Franicsco Examiner reported yesterday that
Nixon's support in the Senate is "crumbling" after the
House Judiciary Committee hearings.
The paper quoted a "Democratic expert on Senate
voting habits" as saying "I think he's going to be convicted
by the Senate for sure."
According to the Examiner, the expert predicted earlier
this year that Nixon "had more than enough votes to stave
off impeachment."
Nixon Maps Impeachment Defense
WASHINGTON — President Nixon yesterday cancelled
a scheduled meeting with economic advisers and instead
spent the day mapping defense strategies against his
possible impeachment and studying Watergate tapes he
must release.
Presidential spokesman Gerald Warren said the situation
is "an extremely serious matter," and indicated that Nixon
is looking to the Senate for ultimate acquittal.
Nixon was also said to be reviewing the next group of
tapes and documents the Supreme Court ordered him to

release to special prosecutor Leon Jaworski.
Meanwhile, columnist Jack Anderson reported that
there appear to be gaps in some of those tapes.
Anderson quoted an anonymous White House source as
saying that "tapes and documents have been altered by
someone inside the White House." He said the Watergate
prosecutors do not know who made the allegations.
Reinecke To Resign This Month
SACRAMENTO — Lieutenant Governor Ed Reinecke
said yesterday he will voluntarily resign his office before
the end of the month.
Reinecke's statement came one hour before an opinion
by Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger was released. The opinion
said the office would be "automatically vacated" when
Reinecke is sentenced. Reinecke, convicted of perjury last
week, is scheduled for sentencing Aug. 30 in the U.S.
District Court in Washington.
He faces a possible five-year prison term and $2000
fine.
In Washington, Reinecke's lawyers filed a motion
yesterday asking that his conviction be reversed. If the
conviction is reversed before sentencing, Reinecke's aides
say he will not resign.
Younger's statement cited Article 20 of the California
Constitution which says in part "laws shall be made to
exclude from office persons convicted of ... perjury."
U.N. Backs Cyprus Peace Order
NEW YORK — The United Nations Security Council
voted 12-0 yesterday to allow U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim to order U.N. peace-keeping forces on Cyprus to
police cease-fire lines.
The Security Council was able to take the action
because the USSR abstained from the votes. Wednesday
night, the Soviets vetoed a similar proposal.
Yesterday, Turkish troops began a new push westward
from Kyrenia in what was called the worst violation of the
Geneva peace agreement signed Tuesday night.
Phone Union Heads Call For Strike
WASHINGTON — Leaders of unions representing
750,000 telephone workers called for a nationwide strike
against the Bell System if agreement is not reached by
12:01 a.m. (EDT) Monday.

The 500,000 member Communications Worker of
America (CWA) and two smaller unions all voted
overwhelmingly to strike.
CWA Vice President Glenn Watts said "It appears that a
strike is inevitable."
Negotiations will continue over the weekend.
In the event of a strike, management personnel would
be used to maintain service.
Texas Prison Negotiations Off
HUNTSVILLE, Tex. — Negotiations between convict
Fred Carrasco and Texas prison officials broke off last
night after the officials refused to let Carrasco go free.
Earlier, four of Carrasco's 13 hostages, who he has held
for over one week, volunteered to accompany him and his
five accomplices. Carrasco has demanded an armored truck
and ammunition to make his getaway.
The four volunteers, three women and the prison's
Catholic chaplain, said they were willing to continue to be
hostages if the other nine captives were released.
Judge Fines Milk Co-Operative
WASHINGTON — A federal judge imposed the
maximum $35,000 fine against the nation's largest milk
co-operative for making illegal campaign contributions.
The co-operative pleaded guilty to charges of
conspiracy as well as making illegal contributions to
members of both parties. Sen. Hubert Humphrey,
D—Minn., and Rep. Wilbur Mills, D—Ark., were both
recipients of illegal contributions totalling $280,000 made
by the Associated Milk Producers Incorporated.
A lawyer for the co-op entered the guilty plea and
recommended a $15,000 fine. But Judge George Hart
imposed the maximum fine.
In Fon du Lac, Wis., the co-operative's president said
his group has run a "clean shop" since 1972 and said its
40,000 members should not be blamed for actions of the
officials.
