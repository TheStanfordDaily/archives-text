The Stanford chapter of Northern California
Public Interest Research Group (NorCal-PIRG)
will probably have two of the five positions on the
NorCal-PIRG corporate board, Executive Director
Roger Telschow said in an interview yesterday.
Stanford, Hastings Law School in San Francisco
and University of Santa Clara are currently the
only contributing members of NorCal-PIRG. Thus
their student representatives will compose the
board in proportion to the amount of money each
is supplying, Telschow explained. PIRG is a
student directed social advocacy group.
In April students here passed a $1 fee
assessment for next year. Hastings students voted a
$3 assessment in March and Santa Clara will begin
its second year of funding NorCal-PIRG, Telschow
said.
One of the projects which NorCal-PIRG is
currently working on is a legislative scoreboard,"
according to Telschow. The finished "scoreboard"
should include information about how to get in
touch with Sacramento legislators and about how
they voted on key measures during the past year,
he said.
Other Ideas
Other ideas that have been proposed include a
study of mass transportation in Santa Clara
County, a study of tax reform and an investigation
to determine if local banks and finance
companies are complying with the federal
truth-in-lending laws.
One of the priorities of Telschow's work will be
to help NorCal-PIRG grow, he said. "The
California groups are one of the smallest in the
country," he added. Besides NorCal-PIRG, Cal
PIRG operates in Southern California, principally
in the San Diego area.
Telschow emphasized that "students
overwhelmingly support" PIRG. However,
problems have arisen with administrators and
trustees at some California public universities and
colleges, because they will not approve political
projects, he said.
Difficulties
The group here encountered difficulties after
the fee assessment passed. But these problems have
since been worked out, giving Stanford a unique
arrangement for financing projects.
The University was concerned that the money
given to PIRG wouldn't directly benefit students,

according to Asst. Dean ot btudent Affairs Dale
Snape.
Under the arrangement here the NorCal-PIRG
office will not control student funds. Instead,
funds will only be approved for projects
undertaken by Stanford students and "educational
to them," according to a memo from Snape to
student PIRG organizers here.
Project Outline
The procedure will involve a project outline
describing the project and how money would be
spent. The outline must also include a list of
students primarily responsible for the project,
Snape's memo noted.
"Reasonable consulting fees" may be paid to
NorCal-PIRG professionals, it continued, but
approval of funding must be made prior to
expenditure.
The Stanford chapter will pay a $300
membership fee in NorCal-PIRG besides consulting
fees.
