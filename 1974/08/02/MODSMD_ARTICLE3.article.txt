# TMU Workers Oppose Layoffs
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Workers at Tresidder Memorial
Union, who face layoff August
17, plan action to force the
University to reconsider its plan
to close TMU cafeteria and reopen
in a fast-food format.
No formal action has been
taken yet, though. A group of
employees led by United Stanford
Employees (USE) member Mike
Harris suggested yesterday that
workers might establish an
"alternative food service" as they
did in 1971 if the University does
not change its plans.
In the spring of 1971, a
coalition of USE, Venceremos and
Black Caucus members protested

the layoffs of 12 Tresidder
employees by organizing a
boycott of the cafeteria and
opening an "alternative food
service" on Tresidder patio.
The service offered home-made
sandwiches, coffee and doughnuts
as competition to the Union's
cafeteria.
Harris and USE lawyer Martin
Eichner said yesterday that the
1971 boycott was successful,
since all workers were eventually
rehired. The boycott also helped
precipitate the firing of then-TMU
head Forrest Tregea and food
service director Raymond
Harrington.
University Action
Asked whether the University
would act to stop such a boycott,
Harris responded, "They couldn't
stop us last time." He added that
health inspectors concerned about
swooping birds did visit the scene.
USE would again be a sponsor
of such a boycott, Harris said. An
election to determine whether
USE will become the sole
bargaining agent for employees of
TDS, Inc., the University
subcontractor which runs the
cafeteria and coffee house, is set
for next Thursday.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said last night "If USE
wants to start a food service,
that's just fine."
Meeting
A group of TDS employees and
USE representatives met with
University officials Tuesday,
Harris said. At that meeting, the
workers asked the University to
set up a committee representative
of the Stanford community to
decide the direction of the food
service.
When the University rejected
this proposal, saying the
University alone would decide
what to do with Tresidder, a
spokesman for the group of
workers said "then we're going to
shut you down."
At that point, the University
officials walked out of the
meeting, Harris said.
Petition
Last week, TDS workers
circulated a petition reading
"Stanford has announced plans to
close the cafeteria and reopen as a
fast-food Jack-In-The-Box this
coming September. We, the TDS
workers, want to know what you
think of losing your hot meals.
"We feel that a committee
representative of the Stanford
community should decide the
direction of the TMU food
service," the petition said.
Harris, Eichner, and TMU
student-worker Dean Morris
yesterday produced
approximately 615 signed
petitions.
