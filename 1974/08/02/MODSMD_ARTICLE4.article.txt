# Tuition Grant Bill
## 
### 
Quinn Mayer

On Wednesday, August 14th,
the State Senate Education
Committee will receive Assembly
Bill 3862, the "Tuition Grant
Bill." Designed to establish a
Tuition Grant Pilot Program
beginning in Fall 1975, the new
legislation would free $1,000,000
for approximately 1250 new
grants to students entering
accredited independent colleges
and universities.
In the words of the bill, ". . .
there is an apparent need to
narrow the gap in student charges
between public universities and
colleges and independent
institutions of higher education in
California. ..The subsidy is
aimed at students from lower and
middle-income families, so as to
provide them with .. true
economic and academic freedom
of choice in selecting a college."
The tuition grants would be in
the amount of $900 per academic
year or one-third the cost of
annual tuition, whichever is less.
Appropriations for the new grants
would be made available from the
General Fund, without affecting
other California State Scholarship
awards.
The problem faced state-wide
is that many students from
middle-income families are
economically ineligible for
scholarships and grants. While
enrollment of low-income and
disadvantaged students in
independent colleges and
universities is substantial and
continues to increase, enrollment
of middle-income students not
eligible for scholarship aid is
declining.
Certainly the "middle-income
squeeze" is a familiar phrase at
Stanford.
Surprising many, the
Knox-Lan term an Tuition Grant
Bill passed the State Assembly by
a 49-10 vote in late June.
Currently, support for the bill is
growing state-wide through a
letter campaign directed at
members of the Senate Education
Committee or its chairman, Albert

S. Rodda.
The Association of
Independent California Colleges
and Universities, of which
Stanford is a member, has
organized a request for written
support from administrators and
trustees of member instituions.
In two meetings earlier this
quarter in Los Angeles, students
representing about fifteen
independent colleges and
universities including Stanford
met to discuss the possibility of
setting up a collective lobby in
Sacramento. Both the California
State Colleges and the University
of California have student lobbies
which have been extremely
effective in presenting persuasive
student opinion to legislators, and
in getting results.
Serious consideration is being
given to Stanford's supporting
such efforts with students from
other independent schools. For
now, a strong letter campaign will
be the most effective channel in
this stage of legislation.
In addition to chairman
Rodda, other members of the
Senate Education Committee are:
H.L. Richardson (R) Arcadia
Alfred Alquist (D) San Jose
Peter H. Behr (R) San Rafael
Mervyn Dymally (D) Los Angeles
Arlen Gregorio (D) San Mateo
Donald Grunsky (R) Watsonville
John L. Harmer (R) Glendale
Fred Marler, Jr. (R) Redding
George Moscone (D) San Francisco
Walter Stiern (D) Bakersfield
Even if this measure would not
affect you directly, it might free
money that would. A short
personal letter from you would
make a difference.
We ought to at least ask for
help. If you have any questions or
would like more information on
either the bill or the Independent
California College and University
Student's Association, please call
or come by the ASSU office,
497-4331.

Bill." Designed to establish a
Tuition Grant Pilot Program
beginning in Fall 1975, the new
legislation would free $1,000,000
for approximately 1250 new
grants to students entering
accredited independent colleges
and universities.
In the words of the bill, ". . .
there is an apparent need to
narrow the gap in student charges
between public universities and
colleges and independent
institutions of higher education in
California. ..The subsidy is
aimed at students from lower and
middle-income families, so as to
provide them with .. true
economic and academic freedom
of choice in selecting a college."
The tuition grants would be in
the amount of $900 per academic
year or one-third the cost of
annual tuition, whichever is less.
Appropriations for the new grants
would be made available from the
General Fund, without affecting
other California State Scholarship
awards.
The problem faced state-wide
is that many students from
middle-income families are
economically ineligible for
scholarships and grants. While
enrollment of low-income and
disadvantaged students in
independent colleges and
universities is substantial and
continues to increase, enrollment
of middle-income students not
eligible for scholarship aid is
declining.
Certainly the "middle-income
squeeze" is a familiar phrase at
Stanford.
Surprising many, the
Knox-Lan term an Tuition Grant
Bill passed the State Assembly by
a 49-10 vote in late June.
Currently, support for the bill is
growing state-wide through a
letter campaign directed at
members of the Senate Education
Committee or its chairman, Albert

S. Rodda.
The Association of
Independent California Colleges
and Universities, of which
Stanford is a member, has
organized a request for written
support from administrators and
trustees of member instituions.
In two meetings earlier this
quarter in Los Angeles, students
representing about fifteen
independent colleges and
universities including Stanford
met to discuss the possibility of
setting up a collective lobby in
Sacramento. Both the California
State Colleges and the University
of California have student lobbies
which have been extremely
effective in presenting persuasive
student opinion to legislators, and
in getting results.
Serious consideration is being
given to Stanford's supporting
such efforts with students from
other independent schools. For
now, a strong letter campaign will
be the most effective channel in
this stage of legislation.
In addition to chairman
Rodda, other members of the
Senate Education Committee are:
H.L. Richardson (R) Arcadia
Alfred Alquist (D) San Jose
Peter H. Behr (R) San Rafael

Even if this measure would not
affect you directly, it might free
money that would. A short
personal letter from you would
make a difference.
We ought to at least ask for
help. If you have any questions or

either the bill or the Independent
California College and University
Student's Association, please call
