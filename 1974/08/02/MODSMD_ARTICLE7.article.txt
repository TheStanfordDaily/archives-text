'Open Letter'
Editor:
I would like to call attention of
the Stanford commuity to the
fact that for its third number of
Open Letter the Greenwood Press
is planning an anthology of poems
in reaction to the military coup in
Chile.
The anthology will be
published in September, 1974, to
mark the first anniversary of the
coup, and will be sold as a benefit
for NICH (Non-intervention in
Chile).
Submissions are invited. Open
Space is looking for poems
written explicitly about the coup,
or about events in Chile since the
coup. Poems may be in English or
Spanish. Short poems are
preferred.
Deadline for submission is
August 15, 1974. Submissions
may be sent to the Greenwood
Press, 300 Broadway, San
Francisco, Ca. 94133.
