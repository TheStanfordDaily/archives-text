# African Womanâ€”Wife, Mother, Teacher
## 
### CATHERINE WILES 
The traditional role of African
women is that of wife, mother
and educator, explained a panel of
12 women from Ghana, Nigeria,
South Africa and Tanzania in a
presentation Monday at the
Bechtel International Center.
The panelists were members of
The Grail, an Ohio-based
organization sponsoring their
five-month cultural exchange tour
of the United States.
They work as teachers, nurses
or school administrators in
addition to being mothers. Two of
the women had eight children.
"Every African woman must
have children," declared one of
the speakers. In a traditional
African society, when a girl
reaches puberty, she is confined
for two weeks and taught about
sex and marriage.
According to the panelists,
African women teach their
children to help manage the
household. Traditionally, boys get

firewood and girls sweep. After
meals the mother will teach her
children to sing and dance.
"A mother molds the character
of her children," said one woman,
"and mothers all over the world
are the same. They are very
strict." Her emphatic statement
brought a response of laughter
from the 40 present at the
coffee-hour discussion.
"Africans as a whole are very
religious," noted one panelist. The
traditional African women begins
her day with prayer for the
protection of her husband and
children. She sings, "Enlighten my
way and the way of my family."
The woman also plays an active
role in African society's civic life,
remarked one of the speakers.
Each community has a "Queen
Mother" who presides over legal,
economic and familial affairs.
"Women have influenced men
in ways," explained one of the
panelists. "In the past, they sang
songs to arouse men to go to

war."
African women own their own
property as do each of their
children. If a child dies, the
mother inherits his property.
Traditionally, she divides it among
the remaining children as the
"trustee in the corporation of her
family," according to one
panelist.
The rise of education in Africa
has brought about societal
changes, the panelists said. Only
the boys used to go to school if
the family had enough money.
Now both men and women are

encouraged to become doctors
and lawyers.
"Education is very important
in Africa," said one of the
panelists. "The children learn a
lot. They even know who founded
Philadelphia and where the
Mississippi River is."
"The family unit is still very
important in African society,"
one panelist maintained. '"Hiere is
no problem of competition
between the male and female
because they are building together
for themselves and their
children."
