# New Tapes Spur Calls For Resignation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Several of
President Richard Nixon's
staunchest supporters in his fight
against impeachment called for his
resignation yesterday as the
President made public transcripts
of three more White House tapes.
The transcripts, also forwarded
to the House Judiciary
Committee, contained three
conversations with former White
House Chief of Staff H.R.
Haldeman on June 23, 1972
showing that Nixon plotted to
hinder the FBI investigation into

the Watergate cover-up.
Claiming that covert CIA
activity might be in jeopardy by a
thorough FBI probe, Nixon
sought to use the CIA to shield
re-election campaign staff from
prosecution, the transcripts
revealed.
To most legislators here, these
developments represented the
"hard evidence" linking the
President to the Watergate
cover-up.
Even hard-line Republicans
Rep. Charles Wiggins of

California, Sen. Robert P. Griffin
of Michigan, Rep. Barber Conable
of New York and Rep. David
Dennis of Indiana wound up the
day calling for Nixon's resignation
and the "orderly transition of
power" from Nixon to Vice
President Gerald Ford.
The tapes themselves, recorded
less than one week after the
Watergate break-in, were among
the 64 tapes the Supreme Court
ordered Nixon to surrender to
Federal Judge John Sirica. Nixon
had the tapes delivered to the

judge yesterday in conjunction
with the transcript release.
The President issued a
two-page statement with the
transcripts saying he did not
realize at the . time the
implications the conversations
with Haldeman might have.
Nixon said he withheld the
information contained in the June
23rd tapes not only from the
House Judiciary Committee and
from the Supreme Court, but also
from his impeachment attorney
James St. Clair.
Protective Action
The President described his
action as protection against
possible exposure of "involvement
by persons connected with the
re-election committee.
"As a result, those arguing my
case as well as those passing
judgment on the case, did so with
information that was incomplete
and in some respects erroneous,"
he said in his statement.
He added that withholding the
information was "a serious act of
omission for which I take full
responsibility and which I deeply
regret."
'Foregone Conclusion'
Nixon also formally
acknowledged that a House vote
of impeachment is "virtually a
foregone conclusion."
However, he maintained that
the entire body of evidence does
not justify impeachment or his
removal from office. Gerald
Warren, White House deputy press
secretary, yesterday affirmed
previous Nixon stands that the
President is not considering
resignation.
The Captiol Hill reaction to the
latest tape revelations was
outrage.
Wiggins, the leader of Nixorr's
defense in the House Judiciary
Committee, said he would now
vote for impeachment if Nixon
does not resign.
Fighting back tears as he
spoke, Wiggins concluded that
Nixon violated the law and that

should Nixon refuse resignation,
"the magnificent public career of
Richard Nixon must be
terminated involuntarily."
Griffin, the second-ranking
Republican in the Senate, called
on Nixon to resign in "the
national and his own best
interests."
Conable, a consistent Nixon
supporter and respected
Republican leader, characterized
Nixon's defenders against
impeachment as "abused" by a
President who concealed vital
information from them.
Rep. Charles Sandman, R-N.J.,
also had harsh words for the
President, saying that his "errors
of judgment... may have
constituted an isolated criminal
act."
Dennis voiced his disapproval
more strenuously asserting that
the transcripts show Nixon is
guilty of the charges in
impeachment Article I,
obstruction of justice.
Even the Vice President
removed himself from the
shrinking list of Nixon's
defenders. Ford told newsmen it
would serve no purpose for him to
repeat statements that Nixon was
not guilty of an impeachable
offense, adding that he would
refuse comment on impeachment
from now on.
However, House Speaker Carl
Albert, D-Okla., echoed the
opinion of many Democrats and
called on the President not to step
down, to face the impeachment
proceedings for the country's best
interest.
In the three conversations
released yesterday, Nixon and
Haldeman discussed the best
approach to impede the FBI
inquiry that might have uncovered
the "laundered" money used to
finance the Watergate burglary.
Nixon also instructed
Haldeman to call CIA officials and
"just say this is a comedy of
errors without getting into it. The
President believes it is going to
just open the whole Bay of Pigs
thing up again."
The 46-page transcripts
contained many deletions,
unintelligible portions and a few
missing identifications of
speakers. Warren blamed these
deficiencies on the hurried nature
of the preparation and vowed to
keep the staff working to upgrade
the transcripts.

President is not considering
resignation.
The Captiol Hill reaction to the
latest tape revelations was
outrage.
Wiggins, the leader of Nixorr's
defense in the House Judiciary
Committee, said he would now
vote for impeachment if Nixon
does not resign.
Fighting back tears as he
spoke, Wiggins concluded that
Nixon violated the law and that

should Nixon refuse resignation,
"the magnificent public career of
Richard Nixon must be
terminated involuntarily."
Griffin, the second-ranking
Republican in the Senate, called
on Nixon to resign in "the
national and his own best
interests."
Conable, a consistent Nixon
supporter and respected
Republican leader, characterized
Nixon's defenders against
impeachment as "abused" by a
President who concealed vital
information from them.
Rep. Charles Sandman, R-N.J.,
also had harsh words for the
President, saying that his "errors
of judgment... may have
constituted an isolated criminal
act."
Dennis voiced his disapproval
more strenuously asserting that
the transcripts show Nixon is
guilty of the charges in
impeachment Article I,
obstruction of justice.
Even the Vice President
removed himself from the
shrinking list of Nixon's
defenders. Ford told newsmen it
would serve no purpose for him to
repeat statements that Nixon was
not guilty of an impeachable
offense, adding that he would
refuse comment on impeachment
from now on.
However, House Speaker Carl
Albert, D-Okla., echoed the
opinion of many Democrats and
called on the President not to step
down, to face the impeachment
proceedings for the country's best
interest.
In the three conversations
released yesterday, Nixon and
Haldeman discussed the best
approach to impede the FBI
inquiry that might have uncovered
the "laundered" money used to
finance the Watergate burglary.
Nixon also instructed
Haldeman to call CIA officials and
"just say this is a comedy of
errors without getting into it. The
President believes it is going to
just open the whole Bay of Pigs
thing up again."
The 46-page transcripts
contained many deletions,
unintelligible portions and a few
missing identifications of
speakers. Warren blamed these
deficiencies on the hurried nature
of the preparation and vowed to
keep the staff working to upgrade
the transcripts.
WASHINGTON - Several of
President Richard Nixon's
staunchest supporters in his fight
against impeachment called for his
resignation yesterday as the
President made public transcripts
of three more White House tapes.
The transcripts, also forwarded
to the House Judiciary
Committee, contained three
conversations with former White
House Chief of Staff H.R.
Haldeman on June 23, 1972
showing that Nixon plotted to
hinder the FBI investigation into

the Watergate cover-up.
Claiming that covert CIA
activity might be in jeopardy by a
thorough FBI probe, Nixon
sought to use the CIA to shield
re-election campaign staff from
prosecution, the transcripts
revealed.
To most legislators here, these
developments represented the
"hard evidence" linking the
President to the Watergate
cover-up.
Even hard-line Republicans
Rep. Charles Wiggins of

California, Sen. Robert P. Griffin
of Michigan, Rep. Barber Conable
of New York and Rep. David
Dennis of Indiana wound up the
day calling for Nixon's resignation
and the "orderly transition of
power" from Nixon to Vice
President Gerald Ford.
The tapes themselves, recorded
less than one week after the
Watergate break-in, were among
the 64 tapes the Supreme Court
ordered Nixon to surrender to
Federal Judge John Sirica. Nixon
had the tapes delivered to the

judge yesterday in conjunction
with the transcript release.
The President issued a
two-page statement with the
transcripts saying he did not
realize at the . time the
implications the conversations
with Haldeman might have.
Nixon said he withheld the
information contained in the June
23rd tapes not only from the
House Judiciary Committee and
from the Supreme Court, but also
from his impeachment attorney
James St. Clair.
Protective Action
The President described his
action as protection against
possible exposure of "involvement
by persons connected with the
re-election committee.
"As a result, those arguing my
case as well as those passing
judgment on the case, did so with
information that was incomplete
and in some respects erroneous,"
he said in his statement.
He added that withholding the
information was "a serious act of
omission for which I take full
responsibility and which I deeply
regret."
'Foregone Conclusion'
Nixon also formally
acknowledged that a House vote
of impeachment is "virtually a
foregone conclusion."
However, he maintained that
the entire body of evidence does
not justify impeachment or his
removal from office. Gerald
Warren, White House deputy press
secretary, yesterday affirmed
previous Nixon stands that the
President is not considering
resignation.

House Chief of Staff H.R.
Haldeman on June 23, 1972
showing that Nixon plotted to
hinder the FBI investigation into

the Watergate cover-up.
Claiming that covert CIA
activity might be in jeopardy by a
thorough FBI probe, Nixon
sought to use the CIA to shield
re-election campaign staff from
prosecution, the transcripts
revealed.
To most legislators here, these
developments represented the
"hard evidence" linking the
President to the Watergate
cover-up.
Even hard-line Republicans
Rep. Charles Wiggins of

California, Sen. Robert P. Griffin
of Michigan, Rep. Barber Conable
of New York and Rep. David
Dennis of Indiana wound up the
day calling for Nixon's resignation
and the "orderly transition of
power" from Nixon to Vice
President Gerald Ford.
The tapes themselves, recorded
less than one week after the
Watergate break-in, were among
the 64 tapes the Supreme Court
ordered Nixon to surrender to
Federal Judge John Sirica. Nixon
had the tapes delivered to the

judge yesterday in conjunction
with the transcript release.
The President issued a
two-page statement with the
transcripts saying he did not
realize at the . time the
implications the conversations
with Haldeman might have.
Nixon said he withheld the
information contained in the June
23rd tapes not only from the
House Judiciary Committee and
from the Supreme Court, but also
from his impeachment attorney
James St. Clair.
Protective Action
The President described his
action as protection against
possible exposure of "involvement
by persons connected with the
re-election committee.
"As a result, those arguing my
case as well as those passing
judgment on the case, did so with
information that was incomplete
and in some respects erroneous,"
he said in his statement.
He added that withholding the
information was "a serious act of
omission for which I take full
responsibility and which I deeply
regret."
'Foregone Conclusion'
Nixon also formally
acknowledged that a House vote
of impeachment is "virtually a
foregone conclusion."
However, he maintained that
the entire body of evidence does
not justify impeachment or his
removal from office. Gerald
Warren, White House deputy press
secretary, yesterday affirmed
previous Nixon stands that the
President is not considering
resignation.
The Captiol Hill reaction to the
latest tape revelations was
outrage.
Wiggins, the leader of Nixorr's
defense in the House Judiciary
Committee, said he would now
vote for impeachment if Nixon
does not resign.
Fighting back tears as he
spoke, Wiggins concluded that
Nixon violated the law and that

should Nixon refuse resignation,
"the magnificent public career of
Richard Nixon must be
terminated involuntarily."
Griffin, the second-ranking
Republican in the Senate, called
on Nixon to resign in "the
national and his own best
interests."
Conable, a consistent Nixon
supporter and respected
Republican leader, characterized
Nixon's defenders against
impeachment as "abused" by a
President who concealed vital
information from them.
Rep. Charles Sandman, R-N.J.,
also had harsh words for the
President, saying that his "errors
of judgment... may have
constituted an isolated criminal
act."
Dennis voiced his disapproval
more strenuously asserting that
the transcripts show Nixon is
guilty of the charges in
impeachment Article I,
obstruction of justice.
Even the Vice President
removed himself from the
shrinking list of Nixon's
defenders. Ford told newsmen it
would serve no purpose for him to
repeat statements that Nixon was
not guilty of an impeachable
offense, adding that he would
refuse comment on impeachment
from now on.
However, House Speaker Carl
Albert, D-Okla., echoed the
opinion of many Democrats and
called on the President not to step
down, to face the impeachment
proceedings for the country's best
interest.
In the three conversations
released yesterday, Nixon and
Haldeman discussed the best
approach to impede the FBI
inquiry that might have uncovered
the "laundered" money used to
finance the Watergate burglary.
Nixon also instructed
Haldeman to call CIA officials and
"just say this is a comedy of
errors without getting into it. The
President believes it is going to
just open the whole Bay of Pigs
thing up again."
The 46-page transcripts
contained many deletions,
unintelligible portions and a few
missing identifications of
speakers. Warren blamed these
deficiencies on the hurried nature
of the preparation and vowed to
keep the staff working to upgrade
the transcripts.
