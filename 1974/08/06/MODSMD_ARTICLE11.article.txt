# Campus Women Cops--'True Grit'
## 
### SANDY WHITE 
"Gee, isn't that heavier than carrying a
purse?" The stocky man grins, pointing to
the 12-pound gun-, mac-, flashlight-,
nightstick-, and radio-carrying belt which
weighs Stanford police officer Kristin J.
Henderson down for eight hours every day.
She remembers well the bruises it made
when she first wore it. But now, after
almost a year on the force, both she and
fellow officer Debbie Whittemore take that
and other inconveniences in stride.
Henderson and Whittemore are the first
women to serve on the Stanford force.
Chief Marvin Herrington had "grave
reservations" when they were first hired,
but so far, he says, "their performance has
been good." And it seems that the
community agrees.
"I never thought I could fall in love
with a police officer before," sighs one
man who filed a theft report with
Whittemore. As Henderson cruises down
Campus Drive, many wave to her. She
points one out as "one of my burglars."
More Responsive
Herrington speculates that people may
be more responsive to a woman officer
than to a man. When Henderson frisks a
suspect, she always asks, "Isn't that better
than having a guy do it?" Although most
agree, one burly suspect begged his
companion not to tell anyone that he was
"busted by a chick."
Neither woman has yet had to resort to
physical violence, although both have made
many arrests.
Most situations can be resolved verbally,
says Herrington. For those that can't be, he
confides, "They might resort to mace or a
club faster than a man would," instead of
trying to wrestle a suspect down.
Whittemore says she would probably try
to fight hand-to-hand before using another
weapon.
However, she says, the only time she
was ready to do so, she was with three
other officers and "we were all scared
shitless."
Same Advantages
In a serious situation, Herrington says,
Henderson and Whittemore would have the
same advantages as any man. "They are
probably two of the best shots on the
force."
Day-to-day problems are not violent,
though. On a recent eight-hour shift,
Henderson followed up an old case,
stopped a couple of 10-66's (suspicious
persons), was backed into by another car,
caught a one-hour case of hiccups and
answered an alarm set off by a falling golf
bag.
"That means we're doing effective
patrol work," she explains, "but it sure is
boring."
Like all Stanford officers, Whittemore
and Henderson patrol alone. Although,
Henderson says, "I'm really shy when it
comes down to it," she does not hesitate to
stop suspicious persons or investigate a call.
The 5'5" blonde has a brown belt in judo,
as well as the assurance of a back-up car in
dangerous situations.
Attracts Attention
A police car always attracts attention,
but when a woman is driving it, people
stare, she adds.
When Henderson first started patrolling,
the station received a call that "some
13-year old kid with blonde, frizzy hair"
had stolen a patrol car and was driving
around in it." The "frizzy-haired blonde"
was Henderson.
Another caller saw a "driverless" car.
These calls led to merciless teasing by
fellow officers, a sign of their acceptance
of her, Henderson says.
Initial Skepticism
Only two other women attended the
academy which Henderson and Whittemore
attended, out of a class of 100.
After facing the men's initial skepticism
and ribbing, they proved themselves
worthy, both in the academy and on the

force. Henderson says she won the 'true
grit' award, which goes to the one at the
academy who "works his ass off to keep up
with the others."
Whittemore takes a less competitive
approach toward the men. "I admit that I
can't do everything a man can, I don't put

myself on the defensive. If you don't go
into a situation with a hard head, you get
more respect."
Open Doors
Neither one considers herself "a
woman's libber."
"There's nothing I like better than
having guys open doors for me," says
Henderson. Whittemore says she tries to
look as feminine as possible in her khaki
pants and shirt, which she calls "just ugly.
Being a female has done nothing but help"
on the job, she says.
Both women are graduates of San Jose
State University. Whittemore held desk
jobs with the Palo Alto police for a couple
of years and Henderson interned there
while in school.
Stanford hired them last September and
they spent six weeks at the Modesto
academy.
Tomboy
Henderson, who describes herself as a
tomboy, says"I hated dolls, and sold them
to my girlfriend."
She adds that she would like to
specialize in juvenile work or officer
training after she has gained patrol
experience.
Whittemore does not know how long
she will remain in police work. "I'm not
bent on any career that I have to do. I will
do this as long as I enjoy it." After that, "I
am not averse to getting married and
having kids," she says.
But whether they make police work a
career or only a transition period,

Whittemore and Henderson are setting a
valuable precedent here. They have begun
programs at Escondido Village in
self-defense for women, and Whittemore
has been asked to give a six-week program
to the Cowell nurses in treatment of rape
cases.
