# Consumer Advocate Cautions Buyers
## Ingham Blasts Used Car Salesmen 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
"You're better off in a pool full of
sharks" than buying a car from a used car
salesman on El Camino Real, consumer
advocate I. Slim Ingham declared Thursday
night.
Speaking to more than 200 people in
Tresidder Union on "Consumer Traps And
How To Avoid Them," Ingham, a
syndicated columnist, exposed more than
20 ways in which the consumer gets taken.
The used car salesman knows nothing
about the cars he's selling "except there's a
good chance the car will run long enough to
get you off the lot," said Ingham, a member
of Consumers United of Palo Alto.
Consumers United — a volunteer,
non-profit organization that looks out for
the consumer — receives most of its
complaints from people who buy cars off
used car lots, according to Ingham.
$700 Too Much?
He charged that the average price for a
used car on lots in Palo Alto and
surrounding cities is more than $700 above
fair market values.
A person should always buy a used car
from a private party, Ingham recommended,
but warned that "a multitude of ways for
gimicking a used car exists."
When buying a used car, the consumer
should check the current blue book value
and take the vehicle to a reputable
diagnostic center, he added.
Phony Warranty
But consumer traps also exist for the
prospective new car owner, Ingham
cautioned. One of these, "the phony
automobile warranty," is actually "a license
so that the dealer can steal from you," he
claimed.
"Somewhere along the line, the shark in
nice clothing that sold you your new car
sells you an extended warranty for five
years or 50,000 miles."

However, to keep the warranty in force,
Ingham charged that the unsuspecting
consumer must bring his car to the dealer
for service every three months.
The average cost for these service checks
during the five-year period can be $12,000
to $15,000 more than the normal cost,
according to Ingham.
Magazine Rip-Offs
Besides auto sales traps, Ingham warned
the consumer against the door-to-door
magazine salesman.
Many times a consumer feels he has paid

for a one-year subscription to a magazine.
Later, when billed in the mail, he finds out
that he actually paid for half of a
six-month subscription, Ingham explained.
"There are no bargains in magazines sold
door-to-door that I know of," Ingham
stated.
'Telephone Hussies'
The consumer advocate also noted that
"telephone hussies" are likely consumer
traps.
According to Ingham, the telephone
hussler might call and say, "As a customer
of long standing with our magazine, the
advertising department wishes to reward
you, and by merely sending us money for
postage, we will extend your magazine
subscription."
Ingham charged that the postage a
subscriber has to pay can be two-and-a-third
times the price of the magazine.
Homeowners
Homeowners are particularly susceptible
to consumer traps, Ingham noted.
One of these, "the roof oilers gimmick,"
involves a man who comes to the door of
the consumer and tells him that he's just
finished a roofing job on the next block.
The man explains that he has some roof oil
left over that he'll spray on the
homeowner's shingle roof for $15 to $30.
Ingham explained that shingle roofs
should never be oiled and that usually the
con man is just spraying "some old
crankcase drainage mixed with kerosene" on
the roofs.
Not only is this solution highly
flammable, but when it rains, the solution
washes off into the yard killing plants,
Ingham said.
During his 40-minute speech, sponsored
by the Tresidder Program Board, Ingham
also described recreational land, pool and
carpet sales as possible areas of consumer
fraud.

How To Avoid Them," Ingham, a
syndicated columnist, exposed more than
20 ways in which the consumer gets taken.
The used car salesman knows nothing
about the cars he's selling "except there's a
good chance the car will run long enough to
get you off the lot," said Ingham, a member
of Consumers United of Palo Alto.
Consumers United — a volunteer,
non-profit organization that looks out for
the consumer — receives most of its
complaints from people who buy cars off
used car lots, according to Ingham.
$700 Too Much?
He charged that the average price for a
used car on lots in Palo Alto and
surrounding cities is more than $700 above
fair market values.
A person should always buy a used car
from a private party, Ingham recommended,
but warned that "a multitude of ways for
gimicking a used car exists."
When buying a used car, the consumer
should check the current blue book value
and take the vehicle to a reputable
diagnostic center, he added.
Phony Warranty
But consumer traps also exist for the
prospective new car owner, Ingham
cautioned. One of these, "the phony
automobile warranty," is actually "a license
so that the dealer can steal from you," he
claimed.
"Somewhere along the line, the shark in
nice clothing that sold you your new car
sells you an extended warranty for five
years or 50,000 miles."

However, to keep the warranty in force,
Ingham charged that the unsuspecting
consumer must bring his car to the dealer
for service every three months.
The average cost for these service checks
during the five-year period can be $12,000
to $15,000 more than the normal cost,
according to Ingham.
Magazine Rip-Offs
Besides auto sales traps, Ingham warned
the consumer against the door-to-door
magazine salesman.
Many times a consumer feels he has paid

for a one-year subscription to a magazine.
Later, when billed in the mail, he finds out
that he actually paid for half of a
six-month subscription, Ingham explained.
"There are no bargains in magazines sold
door-to-door that I know of," Ingham
stated.
'Telephone Hussies'
The consumer advocate also noted that
"telephone hussies" are likely consumer
traps.
According to Ingham, the telephone
hussler might call and say, "As a customer
of long standing with our magazine, the
advertising department wishes to reward
you, and by merely sending us money for
postage, we will extend your magazine
subscription."
Ingham charged that the postage a
subscriber has to pay can be two-and-a-third
times the price of the magazine.
Homeowners
Homeowners are particularly susceptible
to consumer traps, Ingham noted.
One of these, "the roof oilers gimmick,"
involves a man who comes to the door of
the consumer and tells him that he's just
finished a roofing job on the next block.
The man explains that he has some roof oil
left over that he'll spray on the
homeowner's shingle roof for $15 to $30.
Ingham explained that shingle roofs
should never be oiled and that usually the
con man is just spraying "some old
crankcase drainage mixed with kerosene" on
the roofs.
Not only is this solution highly
flammable, but when it rains, the solution
washes off into the yard killing plants,
Ingham said.
During his 40-minute speech, sponsored
by the Tresidder Program Board, Ingham
also described recreational land, pool and
carpet sales as possible areas of consumer
fraud.
