# Prof Examines SALT Talks

### LAURIE TREUHAFT 
Negotiators in July's Phase II
Strategic Arms Limitations Talks
(SALT) came back "essentially
empty-handed," Prof. Sidney D.
Drell told an ASEE-NASA
Summer Faculty Institute seminar
last week.
Drell, deputy director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) and a consultant
to the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said he
hoped the "momentum of trust
and understanding" necessary for
future U.S.-Soviet arms
agreements had not been lost after
last month's summit meeting.
Because of differences in U.S.
and Soviet technology and
deployment patterns, SALT II
didn't produce a decision on how
to implement the "principle of
equal security" agreed upon

before the July talks, Drell said.
He explained that if the two
nations agree to maintain an equal
number of weapons, the Soviets
still will have a larger missile supply
in size and number.
But basing an agreement on
equality in force rather than the
number of warheads will give the
advantage to the U.S., Drell
noted.
While Russia has only recently
developed and deployed MIRVs —
multiple warheads which can be
directed individually to different
targets — the U.S. already has
800-900 MIRVs deployed.
Drell said it is difficult to
determine what limits the U.S.
should place on offensive weapons
like MIRVs, in view of the greater
Soviet missile capacity.
Drell also complained about
the two-year delay for SALT ll's

threshhold test ban treaty. The
treaty, which takes effect March
31, 1976, allows for the use of
weapons up to 150 kilotons.
The 150 kiloton ceiling is too
high, Drell warned.
He charged that while the
treaty limits underground tests for
military purposes, it is impossible
for anyone besides the tester to
distinguish between underground
nuclear explosions for military as
opposed to peaceful purposes.
Conceptual Breakthrough
SALT negotiations will resume
in Geneva next month with the
aim of reaching what Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger termed a
"conceptual breakthrough," Drell
said.
A "conceptual breakthrough"
will involve "extending limitations
on offensive strategic weapons,"
Drell said.
This could mean going beyond
the SALT I principle of mutual
deterrences — that the enormous
nuclear arsenals of each country
must be maintained to make war
unthinkable.
Restrictions
Quantitative and qualitative
restrictions on the development of
MIRVs will have great significance
for SALT's future, Drell added.
The current five-year interim
agreement, places quantitative
limitations on sea-based and

land-based offensive missiles, but
not on MIRVs.
Drell said that accurate,
reliable MIRVs represent the key
threat to security, however.
A 10 percent reduction in the
number of launchers over the next
four years could reduce the
"enormous excess" in the size of
U.S. and Soviet forces, leaving
1500 launchers on each side, Drell
added.
Destruction Possibilities
"It is important not to lose
sight of the unimaginable scale of
destruction that can be wrought
by [the forces both sides have
at present]he said.
According to Drell, less than
10 percent of U.S. nuclear forces
delivered on target could destroy
approximately half of Soviet
industry or kill more than
one-fourth of the population.
At present, arms expenditures
consume about eight percent of
the total resources of the world.
Lastly, Drell said that
Secretary of Defense James
Schlesinger's new targeting policy
should not necessarily have
required the development of
additional MIRVs.
The policy, Drell explained, is
designed to make U.S. nuclear
forces versatile, so that full
retaliation will not be the only
option in the event of a less than
full-scale attack.
