# Bathing At Its Best?
## 'Free' Beaches Attract Nudists 
### D. PAUL YEUELL 
It used to be you had to go to the Tenderloin
flicks to see skin. Eight?
Well, now at the secluded Northern California
"free" beaches the scene is as naked as you make it.
Between San Francisco and Santa Cruz, there
are three well know "free" beaches — one north of
Santa Cruz, one south of Pomponio, and one north
of San Gregorio. And, there are obviously scores of
others that are not-so-well-known.
"I had no idea where I was," said one Stanford
woman, "but when I looked up there was a naked
man. I was so surprised."
Arm-In-Arm
"It was awful," she said, "people parading
around. Men strutting arm-in-arm with each other.
And dogs. And dog shit. I didn't really like it at
all."
The only advertisement for these beaches is a
cluster of cars parked at the head of a path that
winds down the side of a sea-cliff or an old
creek-bed to a hidden beach.
The approaches to most of the beaches are
guarded by signs which bear fast-current and
rip-tide warnings. Consequently, except near Santa
Cruz, few venture into the surf.
Avoiding Crowds
"I like going to the free beaches," said one
Stanford male, a senior, "but I avoid the crowds. I
enjoy getting naked with my friends and taking in

the rays."
Bathers spread out along the narrow beaches
beneath the sandstone bluffs.
In the sun, a blond boy tenderly embraces a
naked red-haired girl in his lap. A big sandy setter
lumbers by, looking stupid.
Three wet cowboys try wrecklessly to do naked
handstands. A clothed, terribly-Stanford crowd
relates to itself with a frisbee. And occasionally, a
lone down-looking walker shuffles by grinning.
Low Key
Aside from an infrequent psychedelic frenzy,
Northern California's free beaches are low key.
Since most of them are isolated by high bluffs,
naked bathers enjoy themselves in the exclusion of
the expected hoards of gawkers.
In fact, the high bluffs guarantee little
interference from either gawkers or the law.
"I go," said a male Stanford graduate, "usually
after eating a lot of LSD, to watch the weirdos,
play in the sand, and freak out in the surf."
Some beach goers are into building sandcastles;
others are into cultivating "complete" tans.
"For this to be indecent exposure," said Sky
Dalton, spokesman for the San Mateo Sheriff's
Office, "you need to have a victim, you know, a
little girl or a lady."
According to Dalton, there have been no police
incidents at any of the peninsula "free" beaches for
several years.

several years.
It used to be you had to go to the Tenderloin
flicks to see skin. Eight?
Well, now at the secluded Northern California
"free" beaches the scene is as naked as you make it.
Between San Francisco and Santa Cruz, there
are three well know "free" beaches — one north of
Santa Cruz, one south of Pomponio, and one north
of San Gregorio. And, there are obviously scores of
others that are not-so-well-known.
"I had no idea where I was," said one Stanford
woman, "but when I looked up there was a naked
man. I was so surprised."
Arm-In-Arm
"It was awful," she said, "people parading
around. Men strutting arm-in-arm with each other.
And dogs. And dog shit. I didn't really like it at
all."
The only advertisement for these beaches is a
cluster of cars parked at the head of a path that
winds down the side of a sea-cliff or an old
creek-bed to a hidden beach.
The approaches to most of the beaches are
guarded by signs which bear fast-current and
rip-tide warnings. Consequently, except near Santa
Cruz, few venture into the surf.
Avoiding Crowds
"I like going to the free beaches," said one
Stanford male, a senior, "but I avoid the crowds. I
enjoy getting naked with my friends and taking in

the rays."
Bathers spread out along the narrow beaches
beneath the sandstone bluffs.
In the sun, a blond boy tenderly embraces a
naked red-haired girl in his lap. A big sandy setter
lumbers by, looking stupid.
Three wet cowboys try wrecklessly to do naked
handstands. A clothed, terribly-Stanford crowd
relates to itself with a frisbee. And occasionally, a
lone down-looking walker shuffles by grinning.
Low Key
Aside from an infrequent psychedelic frenzy,
Northern California's free beaches are low key.
Since most of them are isolated by high bluffs,
naked bathers enjoy themselves in the exclusion of
the expected hoards of gawkers.
In fact, the high bluffs guarantee little
interference from either gawkers or the law.
"I go," said a male Stanford graduate, "usually
after eating a lot of LSD, to watch the weirdos,
play in the sand, and freak out in the surf."
Some beach goers are into building sandcastles;
others are into cultivating "complete" tans.
"For this to be indecent exposure," said Sky
Dalton, spokesman for the San Mateo Sheriff's
Office, "you need to have a victim, you know, a
little girl or a lady."
According to Dalton, there have been no police
incidents at any of the peninsula "free" beaches for
several years.
