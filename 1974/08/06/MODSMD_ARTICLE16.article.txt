# Trucks, Cars Subjects Of Photo Realism
## 
### KENNETH WAHL 
SAN FRANCISCO - Right
now there is a stalemate in the art
world as to what is the main
artistic trend. Several tendencies
such as lyrical abstraction,
"material" art, and conceptualism
seem to appear and reappear at
intervals, but there is one
tendency, photo realism, that is
continually preoccupying artists
as time goes on.
This may be because for many
of the artists photo realism is a
path to a lucrative career with a
minimal exertion of talent.
However, there are a few photo
realists that show virtuosity.
One of these is Jim Torlaksom,
a relative newcomer to the field,
who is presented in an
"Introductions '74" exhibition at
the John Berggruen Gallery, 228
Grant Ave., through August 17th.
Watercolors Prints
Torlakson makes watercolors
and prints that exemplify his
sincere interest in realism. The
watercolors are detailed, richly
colored, and fastidious renderings
of trucks, tractors, automobiles,
and house trailers. He uses a
photograph for the basis of each
work, referring to it for every

detail, but imbuing the finished
work with much more intensity
than any photograph could yield.
Every detail is given equal
attention so that the entire image
is heightened to an acute level of
perception. The pervading light is
such that it can emphasize the
minutest element, without
committing itself to any emotive
feeling. Even the edges of shadows
are intensified by thin red and
yellow borders.
Torlakson's approach is
reminiscent of the sharp focus
realism of Charles Sheeler, an
American painter of the 30s and
40s. Torlakson gives a coldness to
the vehicles he depicts, in much
the same way that Sheeler
succeeded in illustrating the
geometric starkness of the
industrial landscape.
Ominous Truck
"Leifsen's Rig and Dozer" is a
watercolor that seems to impose
the artist's attitude on the viewer.
Torlakson presents us with a
diagonal view of an ominous
looking truck. The trucks grill
confronts one head on, as if it
could drive through the frame.

In "Dutch Masters," a
watercolor depicting a truck of
the Dutch Masters Cigar
Company, one cannot help but be
amazed at the complicated detail.
Rembrandt's "Syndics," the
trademark of the company, is
intricately distorted so as to
conform with the beamed
contours which occur on the side
of the truck.
Torlakson's prints are aquatint
etchings limited to the
conventional black and white
tonality characteristic of this
medium. His prints rely more on
an esthetic response to the subject

matter, than on the refined
technique of the watercolors.
With Watercolors
Two of the four prints
exhibited are shown with the
preparatory watercolors. One sees,
when comparing the watercolors
with the prints, that Torlakson in
his prints is much more involved
with contrasting the different
structural elements and variances
of light. This gives the prints
much more compositional
stability and emotive content than
the watercolors.
One of the fallacies of photo
realism is made very clear by the

comparison of Torlakson's
watercolois and prints. The photo
realists strive for a refinement of
technique that will amaze the
viewer, but often times they lose
the emotional content that would
normally be in a picture.
The explanation that is
often given is that this coldness is to
impart the overt banality of the
subject matter. Is this coldness
completely necessary?
Torlakson has unconsciously
illustrated in his prints that it is
not, an artist can combine
hard-edge realism with esthetic
responsiveness.
