# 'Remember When' A Memorable Show
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
If you think you know a lot
about rock 'n' roll, Remember
When, an original musical being
presented on campus by the
Committee on Black Performing
Arts, may set you up for a deft bit
of nostalgia shock.
Indeed, the original work by
John H. Cochran and Sandra L.
Richards proves that nothing has
changed on the rock scene in 20
years, and that very few of the
acts which we consider to be
original are.
Take Dr. John, the Night
Tripper. In 1970 he backed up
Santana at Fillmore West and
astounded the crowd by wearing
feathers and war paint and
throwing glitter into the audience.
As Remember When points
out, this gimmick is straight out
of the repertoire of a black singer
named Screaming Jay Hawkins,

portrayed by Finis Ferguson.
Ferguson is carried into the center
of the production's incredible
theater-in-a-tent in a black casket.
He emerges from his sleep
throwing handfuls of glitter and
singing the original "I Put A Spell
On You."
The entire show consists of
sketches which show how the
ideas and songs of black
performers were borrowed or
stolen by whites to form the basis
of 50s rock. Pat Boone steals
"Tutti Frutti" from Little
Richard; Elvis Presley steals "You
Ain't Nothing' But A Houn' Dog"
from Big Mama Thornton; the
McGuire Sisters steal "Sincerely"
from the Moon glows.
The 25 member cast is simply
excellent, with various members
impersonating both the black
performers and the white stars
who profited from the black

sound. Kevin Harris is convincing
as Little Richard, and Yolanda
Rhodes does well with her
duplications of the big voices of
Mama Thornton and Etta James.
Calvin Young is exceptional as
Clyde McPhatter of The Drifters.
All of the three black vocal groups
portrayed — The Drifters, The
Moonglows, and The Five Satins
— are excellent.
The individual standout of the
show may be Paul Haje, who
becomes Pat Boone, a 50s greaser,
a southern politician, a highschool
nice guy and a blackface
comedian at various times during
the performance. The other most
versatile performer is Terrence
Pritchard who portrays both Ed
Sullivan and Elvis Presley during
the same sketch.
Although the tone gets a bit
too white-man-atone-for-your
sins-ish at times, the buoyant

spirit of the cast keeps this show
lively and full of the exhuberance
both races must feel for rock 'n'
roll, the uniquely American art
form. The show is sunny and
energetic, immensely entertaining.
The tiny touches lend
incredible professionalism — such
as members of the cast asking
members of the audience to dance
during the two large dance
sequences. It's a show you will
remember, even if you — like me
— are too young to remember
pre-Beatles rock 'n' roll.

of 50s rock. Pat Boone steals
"Tutti Frutti" from Little
Richard; Elvis Presley steals "You
Ain't Nothing' But A Houn' Dog"
from Big Mama Thornton; the
McGuire Sisters steal "Sincerely"
from the Moon glows.
The 25 member cast is simply
excellent, with various members
impersonating both the black
performers and the white stars
who profited from the black

sound. Kevin Harris is convincing
as Little Richard, and Yolanda
Rhodes does well with her
duplications of the big voices of
Mama Thornton and Etta James.
Calvin Young is exceptional as
Clyde McPhatter of The Drifters.
All of the three black vocal groups
portrayed — The Drifters, The
Moonglows, and The Five Satins
— are excellent.
The individual standout of the
show may be Paul Haje, who
becomes Pat Boone, a 50s greaser,
a southern politician, a highschool
nice guy and a blackface
comedian at various times during
the performance. The other most
versatile performer is Terrence
Pritchard who portrays both Ed
Sullivan and Elvis Presley during
the same sketch.
Although the tone gets a bit
too white-man-atone-for-your
sins-ish at times, the buoyant

spirit of the cast keeps this show
lively and full of the exhuberance
both races must feel for rock 'n'
roll, the uniquely American art
form. The show is sunny and
energetic, immensely entertaining.
The tiny touches lend
incredible professionalism — such
as members of the cast asking
members of the audience to dance
during the two large dance
sequences. It's a show you will
remember, even if you — like me
— are too young to remember
pre-Beatles rock 'n' roll.

SCREAMING JAY HAWKINS -
Known to his friends as Finis
Ferguson.
If you think you know a lot
about rock 'n' roll, Remember
When, an original musical being
presented on campus by the
Committee on Black Performing
Arts, may set you up for a deft bit
of nostalgia shock.
Indeed, the original work by
John H. Cochran and Sandra L.
Richards proves that nothing has
changed on the rock scene in 20
years, and that very few of the
acts which we consider to be
original are.
Take Dr. John, the Night
Tripper. In 1970 he backed up
Santana at Fillmore West and
astounded the crowd by wearing
feathers and war paint and
throwing glitter into the audience.
As Remember When points
out, this gimmick is straight out
of the repertoire of a black singer
named Screaming Jay Hawkins,

portrayed by Finis Ferguson.
Ferguson is carried into the center
of the production's incredible
theater-in-a-tent in a black casket.
He emerges from his sleep
throwing handfuls of glitter and
singing the original "I Put A Spell
On You."
The entire show consists of
sketches which show how the
ideas and songs of black
performers were borrowed or
stolen by whites to form the basis
of 50s rock. Pat Boone steals
"Tutti Frutti" from Little
Richard; Elvis Presley steals "You
Ain't Nothing' But A Houn' Dog"
from Big Mama Thornton; the
McGuire Sisters steal "Sincerely"
from the Moon glows.
