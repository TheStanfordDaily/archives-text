When a frisbee arches over a
concert crowd rustling like cattle
in a feed lot and slices into the
back of someone's head, it's cool.
He picks it up, figuring that
someone else is into the game, and
heaves it back into the crowd.
So it goes, an anonymous game
of a spontaneous cooperation.
When a concert in Frost
Amphitheater sells out and 9000
people are extruded through one
small gate after a two-hour wait in
a mid-day Santa Clara County
bake, it's cool.
What we need to bear in mind
here is that Dan Scher, the gawky
guy waving huge hands all over
the stage, brought Tim Buckley
and Loggins and Messina to
Stanford.
And also, if anybody asks, it
was not rock n' roll.
Buckley's Beginning
Six years ago, Tim Buckley
came into the music scene with a
couple of very fine albums, Hello
Goodbye being an extraordinarily
versatile show of song-writing. His

early work revealed an important
and innovative talent.
By varing lyrics, phrasing, and
instrumental accompaniment and
by experimenting with breaks,
transitions and rhythms, Buckley
established himself as one of the
earliest American songwriters to
pull rock out of its somewhat
linear tradition and lead it into a
richer, multilayered style.
But like most things struggling
to survive, Buckley has since
sought out a niche of his own in
the musical world — between the
sheets.
Aiming Low
The entire set by Buckley,
backed by a powerful five piece
band, was aimed at the crotch.
Get on top of me woman,
Lemme see what you learned
tonight.
Buckley leads his band with a
tight rein, dominating the picture
when he is singing and blending
back into the tapestry when he's
not, aptly exploiting rock n' roll
to heighten the sensuality of his
songs.

Just like a bitch dog in heat,
we'll have those bed springs
creaking.
Alright.
I gotta talk in tongues, honey,
when you love me. .. .
One song, "Sweet Surrender,"
reveals not only that Buckley is
concerned with the diurnal
problems of lovers but also that
he is a powerful vocalist.
I cheated on you honey,
had to pay the hunter. . .
... had to try to make love feel
new again.
Loggins and Messina
After a short break, tiny red
eyes on a wall of speakers and
amps hand-painted with Loggins
and Messina blinked on.
As usual, their set began with
"Danny's Song" and "Love
Song," both aimed considerably
higher than Buckley's set.
Anywhere that this accoustic
set happens, whether it be a
rowdy Winterland crowd or a
mellow outdoor concert, Kenny
Loggins' voice, which flies from a
deep, guttural bass to a high, nasal
alto, never fails to enchant.
Loggins and Messina have
managed to maintain a wide
musical range through three
studio albums. Songs like
Messina's "Same Old Wine" not
only paint a multi-dimensional
musical picture but also ask
Dylanesque questions:
Well we teach our children
virtue
Then we send them off to war;
so we ask ourselves the
question,
what in the hell are we fighting
for?
Of Wasted Lives
"Golden Ribbons," a beautiful
song about wasted lives, followed
two rockers, "Holiday Hotel" and
"Listen to a Country Song:"
What does it
avail a man
to gain a fortune
and lose his soul?
This chorus, that builds from a
single voice to a resounding chant,
is musically superimposed over
the answer — "those golden
ribbons," the inadequate
recompense for man's vain
endeavors in peace and war.
Finally, after a couple of tall
cups of wine, they got into what
everyone came to hear,
"Vahevela" and "Trilogy."
In both, they painted vivid

musical tapestries with excellent
instrumental and lyrics,
consistently effective harmonies,
powerful breaks and varying,
fleeting rhythms.
'Vahevela' Voyage
In "Vahevela," perhaps the
song that most typifies their spirit,
they've taken the instrumental
break in the middle and turned it
into a musical voyage which
begins in a port alive with calypso
rhythms, moves out to the
breezeless void of a calm sea, until
sea gulls and sharp guitar chords
portend the return to land.
"Trilogy" ended with the
"peace of mind" chorus sounding
sweet and soothing like a Baptist
congregation winding down a
camp meeting. Very nice.
The concert should have ended
here. Unfortunatey, they returned
for an encore of three relatively

linear songs, "My Music," "Mama
Don't Dance," and "Nobody But
You."
Exhaustion
Thoroughly exhausted, the
band left the stage for good in
spite of the clapping, screaming,
whistling crowd that drove every
dog in the house into a frenzy.
Perhaps it was not so irtuch the
particular type of music played
four years ago that made it
necessary to ban rock concerts
from Frost as it was something
else, say, a temporary climate of
mass disobedience.
Rock crowds have changed in
both appearance and make up.
Maybe with a little thought in the
area of moving crowds in and out
of Frost more efficaciously, rock
concerts there could be entirely
feasible with no danger of harm to
anyone — except maybe the dogs.

feasible with no danger of harm to
anyone — except maybe the dogs.

When a frisbee arches over a
concert crowd rustling like cattle
in a feed lot and slices into the
back of someone's head, it's cool.
He picks it up, figuring that
someone else is into the game, and
heaves it back into the crowd.
So it goes, an anonymous game
of a spontaneous cooperation.
When a concert in Frost
Amphitheater sells out and 9000
people are extruded through one
small gate after a two-hour wait in
a mid-day Santa Clara County
bake, it's cool.
What we need to bear in mind
here is that Dan Scher, the gawky
guy waving huge hands all over
the stage, brought Tim Buckley
and Loggins and Messina to
Stanford.
And also, if anybody asks, it
was not rock n' roll.
Buckley's Beginning
Six years ago, Tim Buckley
came into the music scene with a
couple of very fine albums, Hello
Goodbye being an extraordinarily
versatile show of song-writing. His

early work revealed an important
and innovative talent.
By varing lyrics, phrasing, and
instrumental accompaniment and
by experimenting with breaks,
transitions and rhythms, Buckley
established himself as one of the
earliest American songwriters to
pull rock out of its somewhat
linear tradition and lead it into a
richer, multilayered style.
But like most things struggling
to survive, Buckley has since
sought out a niche of his own in
the musical world — between the
sheets.
Aiming Low
The entire set by Buckley,
backed by a powerful five piece
band, was aimed at the crotch.
Get on top of me woman,
Lemme see what you learned
tonight.
Buckley leads his band with a
tight rein, dominating the picture
when he is singing and blending
back into the tapestry when he's
not, aptly exploiting rock n' roll
to heighten the sensuality of his
songs.

Just like a bitch dog in heat,
we'll have those bed springs
creaking.
Alright.
I gotta talk in tongues, honey,
when you love me. .. .
One song, "Sweet Surrender,"
reveals not only that Buckley is
concerned with the diurnal
problems of lovers but also that
he is a powerful vocalist.
I cheated on you honey,
had to pay the hunter. . .
... had to try to make love feel
new again.
Loggins and Messina
After a short break, tiny red
eyes on a wall of speakers and
amps hand-painted with Loggins
and Messina blinked on.
As usual, their set began with
"Danny's Song" and "Love
Song," both aimed considerably
higher than Buckley's set.
Anywhere that this accoustic
set happens, whether it be a
rowdy Winterland crowd or a
mellow outdoor concert, Kenny
Loggins' voice, which flies from a
deep, guttural bass to a high, nasal
alto, never fails to enchant.
Loggins and Messina have
managed to maintain a wide
musical range through three
studio albums. Songs like
Messina's "Same Old Wine" not
only paint a multi-dimensional
musical picture but also ask
Dylanesque questions:
Well we teach our children
virtue
Then we send them off to war;
so we ask ourselves the
question,
what in the hell are we fighting
for?
Of Wasted Lives
"Golden Ribbons," a beautiful
song about wasted lives, followed
two rockers, "Holiday Hotel" and
"Listen to a Country Song:"
What does it
avail a man
to gain a fortune
and lose his soul?
This chorus, that builds from a
single voice to a resounding chant,
is musically superimposed over
the answer — "those golden
ribbons," the inadequate
recompense for man's vain
endeavors in peace and war.
Finally, after a couple of tall
cups of wine, they got into what
everyone came to hear,
"Vahevela" and "Trilogy."
In both, they painted vivid

musical tapestries with excellent
instrumental and lyrics,
consistently effective harmonies,
powerful breaks and varying,
fleeting rhythms.
'Vahevela' Voyage
In "Vahevela," perhaps the
song that most typifies their spirit,
they've taken the instrumental
break in the middle and turned it
into a musical voyage which
begins in a port alive with calypso
rhythms, moves out to the
breezeless void of a calm sea, until
sea gulls and sharp guitar chords

only paint a multi-dimensional
musical picture but also ask
Dylanesque questions:
Well we teach our children
virtue
Then we send them off to war;
so we ask ourselves the
question,
what in the hell are we fighting
for?
Of Wasted Lives
"Golden Ribbons," a beautiful
song about wasted lives, followed
two rockers, "Holiday Hotel" and
"Listen to a Country Song:"
What does it
avail a man
to gain a fortune
and lose his soul?
This chorus, that builds from a
single voice to a resounding chant,
is musically superimposed over
the answer — "those golden
ribbons," the inadequate
recompense for man's vain
endeavors in peace and war.
Finally, after a couple of tall
cups of wine, they got into what
everyone came to hear,
"Vahevela" and "Trilogy."
In both, they painted vivid

musical tapestries with excellent
instrumental and lyrics,
consistently effective harmonies,
powerful breaks and varying,
fleeting rhythms.
'Vahevela' Voyage
In "Vahevela," perhaps the
song that most typifies their spirit,
they've taken the instrumental
break in the middle and turned it
into a musical voyage which
begins in a port alive with calypso
rhythms, moves out to the
breezeless void of a calm sea, until
sea gulls and sharp guitar chords
portend the return to land.
"Trilogy" ended with the
"peace of mind" chorus sounding
sweet and soothing like a Baptist
congregation winding down a
camp meeting. Very nice.
The concert should have ended
here. Unfortunatey, they returned
for an encore of three relatively

linear songs, "My Music," "Mama
Don't Dance," and "Nobody But
You."
Exhaustion
Thoroughly exhausted, the
band left the stage for good in
spite of the clapping, screaming,
whistling crowd that drove every
dog in the house into a frenzy.
Perhaps it was not so irtuch the
particular type of music played
four years ago that made it
necessary to ban rock concerts
from Frost as it was something
else, say, a temporary climate of
mass disobedience.
Rock crowds have changed in
both appearance and make up.
Maybe with a little thought in the
area of moving crowds in and out
of Frost more efficaciously, rock
concerts there could be entirely
feasible with no danger of harm to
anyone — except maybe the dogs.

When a frisbee arches over a
concert crowd rustling like cattle
in a feed lot and slices into the
back of someone's head, it's cool.
He picks it up, figuring that
someone else is into the game, and
heaves it back into the crowd.
So it goes, an anonymous game
of a spontaneous cooperation.
When a concert in Frost
Amphitheater sells out and 9000
people are extruded through one
small gate after a two-hour wait in
a mid-day Santa Clara County
bake, it's cool.
What we need to bear in mind
here is that Dan Scher, the gawky
guy waving huge hands all over
the stage, brought Tim Buckley
and Loggins and Messina to
Stanford.
And also, if anybody asks, it
was not rock n' roll.
Buckley's Beginning
Six years ago, Tim Buckley
came into the music scene with a
couple of very fine albums, Hello
Goodbye being an extraordinarily
versatile show of song-writing. His

early work revealed an important
and innovative talent.
By varing lyrics, phrasing, and
instrumental accompaniment and
by experimenting with breaks,
transitions and rhythms, Buckley
established himself as one of the
earliest American songwriters to
pull rock out of its somewhat
linear tradition and lead it into a
richer, multilayered style.
But like most things struggling
to survive, Buckley has since
sought out a niche of his own in
the musical world — between the
sheets.
Aiming Low
The entire set by Buckley,
backed by a powerful five piece
band, was aimed at the crotch.
Get on top of me woman,
Lemme see what you learned
tonight.
Buckley leads his band with a
tight rein, dominating the picture
when he is singing and blending
back into the tapestry when he's
not, aptly exploiting rock n' roll
to heighten the sensuality of his
songs.

Just like a bitch dog in heat,
we'll have those bed springs
creaking.
Alright.
I gotta talk in tongues, honey,
when you love me. .. .
One song, "Sweet Surrender,"
reveals not only that Buckley is
concerned with the diurnal
problems of lovers but also that
he is a powerful vocalist.
I cheated on you honey,
had to pay the hunter. . .
... had to try to make love feel
new again.
Loggins and Messina
After a short break, tiny red
eyes on a wall of speakers and
amps hand-painted with Loggins
and Messina blinked on.
As usual, their set began with
"Danny's Song" and "Love
Song," both aimed considerably
higher than Buckley's set.
Anywhere that this accoustic
set happens, whether it be a
rowdy Winterland crowd or a
mellow outdoor concert, Kenny
Loggins' voice, which flies from a
deep, guttural bass to a high, nasal
alto, never fails to enchant.
Loggins and Messina have
managed to maintain a wide
musical range through three
studio albums. Songs like
Messina's "Same Old Wine" not
only paint a multi-dimensional
musical picture but also ask
Dylanesque questions:
Well we teach our children
virtue
Then we send them off to war;
so we ask ourselves the
