# Card Net Star Hagey Turns Pro
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford tennis star Chico
Hagey has decided to forego his
senior year of competition in
order to join the professional
ranks.
Hagey told Stanford tennis
coach Dick Gould he would tum
professional this week. The
LaJolla native will return to
Stanford for two quarters, and
plans to graduate in March.
Hagey has had a fine season
this year, winning the U.S.
Amateur Grass Court title and
finishing second in both the
California State Championships
and the NCAA's. According to
Gould, Hagey has been
considering the switch to pro
tennis since the spring.
"He's certainly good enough to
play professional tennis," Gould
said.

Hagey's loss won't help
Stanford's bid for a third straight
NCAA net crown next spring. The
Stanford team, however, should
feature NCAA singles champion
John Whitlinger, three-time
All-America Jim Delaney and
several other stars.
Whitlinger and Delaney made
waves over the weekend at the
87th Western Tennis
Championships in Cincinnati.
The pair, playing as a doubles
team in only their fourth
tournament, beat two of
America's greatest doubles
players, Bob Lutz and Marty
Reissen, in the semifinals.
Whitlinger-Delaney had a
chance to win the tournament the
next day, but lost a second-set
tiebreaker and went on to fall to
Dick Dell-Sherwood Stewart, 6-4,
6-7, 6-2.

GOODBYE, CHICO —Stanford tennis star Chico Hagey, lured by
increasingly large sums of money on the professional tennis tours, will
turn pro this week. Hagey will be back at Stanford in the fall and
winter, but will only be able to be a spectator at Stanford tennis
matches.
