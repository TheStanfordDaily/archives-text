# TMU Workers Plan Picket, Alternative Food Service
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Workers at Tresidder Memorial
Union who face layoff August 17
are organizing a boycott of
Tresidder cafeteria tomorrow,
Mike Harris, spokesman for a
group of employees, said last
night.
"We will attempt to close the
cafeteria for the day," Harris said.
He indicated that some sort of
alternative food service would be
set up.
At present, the "informational
picket" is set to last only one day,
although Harris said it could be
extended.
Only Cafeteria
Workers across campus,
including members of United
Stanford Employees (USE), will
picket. At the present time, only
the Tresidder cafeteria is targeted
for the boycott — not Tresidder's
other services.
The boycott is designed "to get
them [University officials] to do
something else besides the
madness they've decided to do,"
according to Harris. The

University and subcontractor
TDS, Inc., have announced plans
to close the cafeteria and reopen
in September with a fast-food
format, a move which would
result in the permanent layoff of
over 30 workers.
Earlier yesterday, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons said
such a boycott "sure as hell is
going to give us a lot of trouble."
But he said that even in the face
of a boycott "we're going ahead."
Broadcast Tonight
Lyons, Dan Williams, associate
dean of students, and Gordon
Starr, TMU general manager,
spoke at a press conference which
will be broadcast on KZSU (90.1
FM) tonight at 7 p.m.
Starr said a boycott would be
self-defeating. "If there's a
boycott, and revenues decline and
become less than expenditures,
we've got to shut down the
operation ... and jobs are lost,"
through further layoffs.
Lyons said a similar boycott in
1971 "in part accounted for the
laying off of people today. We
never fully recovered," from that
boycott, set up to protest the
layoffs of 12 Tresidder workers.
'Vested Interest'
Lyons also said, "I doubt
whether the Stanford community
would allow a group [USE] with
a vested interest — their
employees — to make decisions
about what the food service
should be."
Those decisions about the
future of the food service will be
made only after consultation with
students in the fall, Lyons said.
He reiterated that the "somewhat
modest fast-food operation" was
only an interim solution designed
to end losses at the cafeteria,
which are in excess of $100,000
per year.
Until the present time, the
University has subsidized the
cafeteria's losses. Williams
explained why the University
would no longer do so. He said,
"when you have to choose
priorities about where your

money is going to go, as I suspect
the University is doing for the
first time since the mid '60s, then
you say our primary responsibility
is to provide educational facilities
for the people who are here.
"If to accomplish that we have
to not have a food service, then
that's what we have to do."
The tone of the University
officials indicated that if the

boycott continued into the fall
and was successful, the University
would shut down Tresidder food
operations (except for the coffee
house) entirely before it would
reopen the cafeteria.
Starr said the present cafeteria
was generating a volume of only
$800,000 a year. He said that the
space now being utilized by the
cafeteria should generate at least
$1.2 million "for the space to pay
for itself."
Starr said the University would
first attempt to sell $1.2 million a
year in food, perhaps by a
combination of a fast-food
service, ice cream parlor and
bakery.

Only Cafeteria
Workers across campus,
including members of United
Stanford Employees (USE), will
picket. At the present time, only
the Tresidder cafeteria is targeted
for the boycott — not Tresidder's
other services.
The boycott is designed "to get
them [University officials] to do
something else besides the
madness they've decided to do,"
according to Harris. The

University and subcontractor
TDS, Inc., have announced plans
to close the cafeteria and reopen
in September with a fast-food
format, a move which would
result in the permanent layoff of
over 30 workers.
Earlier yesterday, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons said
such a boycott "sure as hell is
going to give us a lot of trouble."
But he said that even in the face
of a boycott "we're going ahead."
Broadcast Tonight
Lyons, Dan Williams, associate
dean of students, and Gordon
Starr, TMU general manager,
spoke at a press conference which
will be broadcast on KZSU (90.1
FM) tonight at 7 p.m.
Starr said a boycott would be
self-defeating. "If there's a
boycott, and revenues decline and
become less than expenditures,
we've got to shut down the
operation ... and jobs are lost,"
through further layoffs.
Lyons said a similar boycott in
1971 "in part accounted for the
laying off of people today. We
never fully recovered," from that
boycott, set up to protest the
layoffs of 12 Tresidder workers.
'Vested Interest'
Lyons also said, "I doubt
whether the Stanford community
would allow a group [USE] with
a vested interest — their
employees — to make decisions
about what the food service
should be."
Those decisions about the
future of the food service will be
made only after consultation with
students in the fall, Lyons said.
He reiterated that the "somewhat
modest fast-food operation" was
only an interim solution designed
to end losses at the cafeteria,
which are in excess of $100,000
per year.
Until the present time, the
University has subsidized the
cafeteria's losses. Williams
explained why the University
would no longer do so. He said,
"when you have to choose
priorities about where your

money is going to go, as I suspect
the University is doing for the
first time since the mid '60s, then
you say our primary responsibility
is to provide educational facilities
for the people who are here.
"If to accomplish that we have
to not have a food service, then
that's what we have to do."
The tone of the University
officials indicated that if the

boycott continued into the fall
and was successful, the University
would shut down Tresidder food
operations (except for the coffee
house) entirely before it would
reopen the cafeteria.
Starr said the present cafeteria
was generating a volume of only
$800,000 a year. He said that the
space now being utilized by the
cafeteria should generate at least
$1.2 million "for the space to pay
for itself."
Starr said the University would
first attempt to sell $1.2 million a
year in food, perhaps by a
combination of a fast-food
service, ice cream parlor and
bakery.
