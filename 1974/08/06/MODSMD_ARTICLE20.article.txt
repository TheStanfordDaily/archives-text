Turkey, Greece Reach Accord
ATHENS — Turkey and Greece reached
tentative agreement yesterday on the
location of cease-fire lines in Cyprus.
The pact, which must be ratified by
officials of the two countries, was reached
after two days of negotiation and helicopter
surveys.
Meanwhile, fighting continued on the
eastern end of the Mediterranean island. The
United Nations peacekeeping force reported
skirmishes between Greek and Turkish
Cypriots.
The two sides continued to charge each
other with atrocities yesterday. Greek
Cypriot villagers have told stories recently
about rapes and killings by Turkish soldiers.
The Turkish foreign minister Turan
Gunes, accused the Greeks of trying to
undermine peace talks, which begin again in
Geneva Thursday. He also said the Greeks
burned down 50 Turkish homes in the city of
Limassol.
Both the Soviet Union and United States
have dispatched envoys to Athens and
Ankara. Assistant Secretary of State Arthur
Hartman was dispatched by his boss, Henry
Kissinger, to speak to leaders of the two
sides.
Reinecke Removal Suit Asked
SACRAMENTO - The People's Lobby, a
California citizen's group, has asked the
Attorney General's office to allow the group
to bring suit demanding the removal of Lt.
Gov. Ed Reinecke.
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger said he would
give serious study to the request. He has 16
days in which to do so.
Last week, Younger ruled that Reinecke
could stay in office until his sentencing for a
perjury conviction Aug. 30.
Reinecke has refused to resign until he has
exhausted post-trial legal rights. He was

convicted 10 days ago of lying to a Senate
committee about his role in the I.T.T.
scandal.
Lightning Causes 250 Fires
UKIAH — Lightning caused over 250 fires
yesterday morning across Northern
California.
The largest fire reported was a 100-acre
blaze west of Ukiah. In the city itself,
lightning struck a home and blew the light
switches off the walls.
No one was reported injured in any of the
fires. Electric power service in many areas
was disrupted because of lightning bolts
hitting transformers.
Okla. Disaster Area Request
OKLAHOMA CITY - Governor David
Hall of Oklahoma yesterday requested that
25 counties in the state be declared disaster
areas because of drought.
Hall added that unless rain falls soon, he
will ask that all 77 counties be declared
disaster areas and become eligible for federal
relief.
The drought, described as the worst since
the 19305, has already destroyed crops in 16
states. Authorities say the dry spell may
begin in other states too, causing damage
soon.
Nebraska, Texas and Kansas are estimated
to have suffered losses of more than $2
billion each in crops, with other states from
Ohio to Wyoming also reporting serious
losses.
S.F. Assemblymen Feud
SACRAMENTO — Two San Francisco
Democrats in the State Assembly exchanged
harsh words yesterday.
Assembly Speaker Leo McCarthy said he
offered the chairmanship of the Health
Committee to Willie Brown, Jr. Earlier,

McCarthy had removed Brown from the
chairmanship of the more powerful Ways and
Means Committee.
Brown held the Ways and Means position
under former Speaker Bob Moretti, but was
removed after a fight with McCarthy for the
Speakership.
Brown, after hearing McCarthy's
statement, called McCarthy with newsmen
present and said "You never offered it, Leo. I
do not want to be sandbagged."
Building Collapse Kills Four
MIAMI — Four persons were killed and
three reported missing after a corner of a
downtown Miami building collapsed
yesterday.
The building housed the Federal Drug
Enforcement agency. Apparently, a
60-by-150 foot section of the three-story
building collapsed under the weight of cars
from a rooftop parking garage.
Fifteen persons were injured in the
collapse, which dumped tons of rubble and
parked cars on the ground.
Texas Con Probable Suicide
HUNTSVILLE, Tex. - Officials
confirmed yesterday that convict Fred
Carrasco died of a single bullet wound
through the temple, a probable suicide.
After an autopsy report, Justice of the
Peace J.W. Bealer reported that he cannot say
Carrasco killed himself, as reported, but did
indicate that he was only hit by one bullet.
Carrasco, fellow inmate Rudolpho
Dominguez, and two of their hostages were
killed Saturday night when Carrasco tried to
escape into an armored car. He had held 13
hostages for over one week.

ATHENS — Turkey and Greece reached
tentative agreement yesterday on the
location of cease-fire lines in Cyprus.
The pact, which must be ratified by
officials of the two countries, was reached
after two days of negotiation and helicopter
surveys.
Meanwhile, fighting continued on the

undermine peace talks, which begin again in
Geneva Thursday. He also said the Greeks
burned down 50 Turkish homes in the city of
Limassol.

days in which to do so.
Last week, Younger ruled that Reinecke
could stay in office until his sentencing for a
perjury conviction Aug. 30.
Reinecke has refused to resign until he has
exhausted post-trial legal rights. He was

convicted 10 days ago of lying to a Senate
committee about his role in the I.T.T.
scandal.

Okla. Disaster Area Request
OKLAHOMA CITY - Governor David
Hall of Oklahoma yesterday requested that
25 counties in the state be declared disaster
areas because of drought.
Hall added that unless rain falls soon, he
will ask that all 77 counties be declared
disaster areas and become eligible for federal
relief.
The drought, described as the worst since
the 19305, has already destroyed crops in 16
states. Authorities say the dry spell may
begin in other states too, causing damage
soon.
Nebraska, Texas and Kansas are estimated
to have suffered losses of more than $2
billion each in crops, with other states from
Ohio to Wyoming also reporting serious
losses.

Brown, after hearing McCarthy's
statement, called McCarthy with newsmen
present and said "You never offered it, Leo. I
do not want to be sandbagged."
