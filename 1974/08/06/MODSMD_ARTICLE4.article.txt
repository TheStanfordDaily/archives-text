# Guilty Verdict In Transplant Donor Case
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
A Sonoma County Superior
Court judge ruled Friday that a
23-year-old man was guilty of
vehicular manslaughter of a young
girl whose heart was transplanted
at the Stanford Medical Center
after she was declared dead.
In a case that could have vast
legal implications, Judge Joseph
Murphy handed down the verdict
in the trial of Jose Flores after
listening to final arguments by
Flores' attorney, Public Defender
Ralph Lopez and Deputy District
Attorney Steven Tucker, the
case's prosecutor.
This decision, combined with a
similar verdict in another recent
trial which centered around the
same issue, is expected to have
substantial impact on clearing up
the question of what determines
death under California law.
The decision is also expected
to bolster the heart transplant
program here and insure the
continuation of other organ
transplant operations.
Auto Accident
Flores was driving a car which
collided with a van in which
12-year-old Colenda Ward was
riding. Ward was taken to Santa
Rosa Memorial Hospital, then
transferred to Stanford Medical
Center after a neurosurgeon
determined she had suffered
massive and irreparable brain
damage.
A panel of doctors here
declared she was dead, using
traditional medical brain-death
standards. On Sept. 17, her
still-beating heart was removed by
a transplant team led by Dr.
Norman Shumway, and implanted
into the chest of a 43-year-old
recipient.
Flores had entered a guilty plea
to a felony drunk driving charge
stemming from the accident and
agreed to stipulate the truth of
the facts of the accident as
presented by the defense.
Controversy
The controversial issue in the
trial was the question of whether
Ward was dead in a legal sense
when her heart was removed, and
thus whether the transplant or the
accident was the immediate cause
of death.
Lopez argued during the trial
that since California has no
statute specifically recognizing the
legality of brain death, Ward was
alive when the transplant
occurred. Therefore, Flores could
not be convicted of manslaughter,
he held.
Lopez also argued that only
the legislature could change
traditional legal concepts of life
and death on the basis of medical
developments. He pointed to a
1970 California Supreme Court
decision in which the justices
struck down the manslaughter
conviction of a man convicted of

causing the death of a
six-month-old fetus.
Doctors Decision
Tucker maintained that the
issue is covered under the 1970
Anatomical Gifts Act, which
allows physicians the right to
determine when a person has died.
In a trial during May in
Oakland, a judge ruled that a
gunshot victim, who also became
a donor here, had not died as the
result of the removal of the heart.
The judge charged the jury to this
affect prior to its deliberation.
The jury found the defendant
in that case guilty of
manslaughter, but the case is
currently under appeal.
New Recipient
Shumway and his transplant
team have now performed 73
heart transplants, of which 24
recipients are living.
The most recent recipient, a
30-year-old California man, was
reported "up and around" for the
first time Friday as he recovered
from his surgery.
The man, whose identity was
not disclosed, received the heart
of an anonymous donor
Wednesday. The recipient had
suffered from coronary artery
disease.
