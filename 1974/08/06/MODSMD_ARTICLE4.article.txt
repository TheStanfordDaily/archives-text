# Guilty Verdict In Transplant Donor Case
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
A Sonoma County Superior
Court judge ruled Friday that a
23-year-old man was guilty of
vehicular manslaughter of a young
girl whose heart was transplanted
at the Stanford Medical Center
after she was declared dead.
In a case that could have vast
legal implications, Judge Joseph
Murphy handed down the verdict
in the trial of Jose Flores after
listening to final arguments by
Flores' attorney, Public Defender
Ralph Lopez and Deputy District
Attorney Steven Tucker, the
case's prosecutor.
This decision, combined with a
similar verdict in another recent
trial which centered around the
same issue, is expected to have
substantial impact on clearing up
the question of what determines
death under California law.
The decision is also expected
to bolster the heart transplant
program here and insure the
continuation of other organ
transplant operations.
Auto Accident
Flores was driving a car which
collided with a van in which
12-year-old Colenda Ward was
riding. Ward was taken to Santa
Rosa Memorial Hospital, then
transferred to Stanford Medical
Center after a neurosurgeon
determined she had suffered
massive and irreparable brain
damage.
A panel of doctors here
declared she was dead, using
traditional medical brain-death
standards. On Sept. 17, her
still-beating heart was removed by
a transplant team led by Dr.
