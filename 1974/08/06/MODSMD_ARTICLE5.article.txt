# No 'Veto-Proof'

WASHINGTON - The idea of
a veto-proof Congress may supply
Republicans with an effective
camapign issue this year.
Many Democratic leaders
openly predict a November
landslide that will sweep 300
Democrats into the next House;
prospects for the new Senate seem
equally encouraging to them.
Some important Democrats,
such as AFL-CIO President
George Meany, have called for the
election of a veto-proof Congress
that would pass a series of
pro-labor bills, including
legislation repealing the
right-to-work Section 148 of the
Taft- Hartley Act.
But Democratic boasts of an
impending Republican debacle to
rival those of 1936 and 1964 are
premature for a number of
reasons.
Historical Distrust
First, American voters
historically distrust calls for
massive electoral victories that
endorse a particular program.
Wilson's demand for a Democratic
Congress did much to defeat his
party in 1918, and Roosevelt's
attempted "purge" of
conservative Democrats was
similarly unsuccessful.
More recently, Nixon's rather
heavy-handed efforts to elect a
Republican Congress in 1970
generally failed. Democratic
exploitation of the veto-proof
Congress theme could easily
antagonize many voters who
believe vaguely in a strong
two-party system.
It could also frighten many
voters who are repelled by the
idea of electing a Congress
dedicated to pushing a specific
and liberal-program into law.
Concept Opposed
This could rally many
Republicans and conservative
non-Republicans into active
opposition. With polls showing
that most of the electorate
strongly opposes the concept of a
veto-proof Congress, Democratic
leaders are beginning to avoid
mention of a veto-proof Congress.
Of course, the election of a
Congress composed of two-thirds
Democrats would not really insure
the clear passage of liberal
legislation over the presidential
veto. Many conservative
Democrats would serve to aid the
President.
Aside from this fact and the
possibility of the veto-proof

Congress theme backfiring,
Republicans have other reasons to
anticipate November with some
hopefulness.
The current Watergate
revelations have produced a voter
mood that is not so much
anti-Republican as it is
anti-incumbent.
Although a recent issue of The
Congressional Quarterly noted
that surprisingly few incumbents
failed to be renominated by their
own party in the spring primaries,
it is not inconceivable that many
fresh Republicans will be able to
oust entrenched Democrats in the
November elections.
Low Rating
Moreover, Congress currently
receives a shockingly low 21
percent approval rating from the
American public. Republicans
may win much support in
November by reminding voters
that the Democrats have held a
Congressional majority for 36 out
of the last 40 years. The GOP may
also revive its fortunes by
reminding voters that the
aberations of a few of Nixon's
advisors hardly represent the
ethics of Republican candidates.
Democratic predictions of an
upcoming landslide are based
largely on victories in recent
special congressional elections.
But as I noted in this column last
spring, by-election votes tend to
be protest votes. Candidates by
definition are not incumbents. In
contrast, voters in November will
be faced with many trusted
incumbents whom — despite any
anti-incumbent mood — they
would be loathe to defeat.
Finally, the Republicans may
win much support by stressing
their ability to provide coherent
answers to major problems such
as inflation. Rightly or wrongly,
most of the electorate is more
concerned with these issues than
with Watergate, and if the
Democrats seem totally
preoccupied with the latter, the
GOP could actually gain seats in
Congress. Democratic leaders are
beginning to realize this fact and
are increasingly emphasizing issues
relating to defense and inflation.
With more than three months
remaining until the Congressional
elections, it would be unwise to
predict that the Democrats will be
able to elect anything resembling
a "veto-proof" Congress in
November.
