Smoggy Memories
Editor:
Just the other day, I pulled into the Palo Alto
A&W to watch the sun set. The menu was of no
concern to me: I had been this way before, I knew
what 1 wanted. After mumbling my order into the
intercom-menu, I thought to myself, "God, how
long it's been since we've had smog like this."
The southwest sky was, as does a chameleon in
the Mojave desert, transmutating colors from
white-orange to grey-purple, the sun having long
since found refuge behind an acierative
translucency of nitric oxide. KFRC was playing
Elton John's single, "Don't Let the Sun Go Down
On Me." "God," I thought, "how very ironic."
The carhop, a spry young girl, evidently not long
out of high school, with small, firm breasts (that
bounced slightly as she walked), the one with no
shees, brought me a meal on an orange tray.
And, as I ate, I wondered how people felt fifty
years ago. Were they jealous of us now? I mean,
this smog was certainly not more than the stuff
dreams were made of, as it were. And whose
dreams? Of visionaries, perhaps, or, more
perceptably, of the revolutionists who knew, even
in their stumblings, that the economy mustbreathe
the air of its ways.
The girl came to pick up the tray, and I told her
to keep the change. She smiled in a way that told
me how much it meant to her.
She looked like she smoked marijuana. Actually,
she looked sort of like Patty Hearst. Patty Hearst,
where are you? You're over there: up against the
wall (mother ) of a closely watched train.
Bullets go right through smog, as thick as it was
that afternoon, never realizing a target.
Presently, atomized fuel flowed from four
barrels, on a brief journey to the respective tops of
eight solid steel Chrysler pistons. I rammed the
Hurst linkage into reverse and pulled out.
(Actually, it's only a two-barrel.)
Ah, what a summer this will have been. The way
people are running around though, one would think
it still spring. "God," I thought, "it's August,
people should be really bored. Doing nothing but
smoking dope and drinking beer."
I waited for the Trafffic-Actuated Multiple
Independently Targetable Left-Turn Arrow to turn
green. "God," I thought, "that idiot Nixon really
has his head wedged."

Editor:
I would like to bring to your attention a matter
concerning many student employees at Stanford.

This is the operation of the Residence Manager's
Office, one of Stanford's biggest summer
employers, especially of students on financial aid.
The job of the Residence Manager's Office is to
insure the artistic beauty of the school's residences
for each autumn quarter. The work which can be
provided by the Office is therefore practically
unlimited and of virtually infinite variety.
However, there is a serious problem with the
division of labor. Some student workers are blessed
with easy work, a relaxed atmosphere, and
relatively little worry that their "out-of-sight" job is
going to change. Others, on the other hand, are
faced with wretched jobs, stringent working
conditions, and the depressing knowledge that at
any time they could be transferred to another job,
which would be, more likely than not, worse. These
two categories of workers receive the same wages,
work the same hours, and often have the same
supervisors. Usually assignments to one of these
two groups are randomly issued by the Office,
though many students who "get in good" with
their supervisors or someone in the Office will be
placed in the first category upon their request.
I first started working for the Office in the
spring of '74. Having turned down a job with the
Grounds Dept., where I had worked one year
previous, because of my extreme dislike for hoeing
weeds, I happily reported to my assigned supervisor
in anticipation of the painter's position which I was
told awaited me (painters belonging to the first
category). To my utter dismay I was handed a hoe
and led to a lovely crop of weeds.
Unfortunatey, or maybe fortunately enough, I
had had several serious emotional problems in the
immediately preceeding months and had been
mainlining cocaine for some time. Between the hot
sun and the hoe I was, therefore, quickly reduced
to a vegetable-like state and after a short four day's
work (which was exactly enough for the rent) I
quit, my arms literally about to fall off.
Since that time I have done much other work
for the Office, which was kind enough to re-install
me on their payroll, including scrubbing walls for
weeks on end and more hoeing. In much better
physical and emotional circumstances I now find
the work assigned unpleasant yet tolerable.
However, I get terribly depressed at lunch time
when I meet friends and hear them relate the
luxury of their jobs.
The point I wish to make, sir, is that the
disparity between jobs offered by the Residence
Manger's Office is a! most as great as the economic
inequality of the students of the University itself.

me how much it meant to her.
She looked like she smoked marijuana. Actually,
she looked sort of like Patty Hearst. Patty Hearst,
where are you? You're over there: up against the
wall (mother ) of a closely watched train.
Bullets go right through smog, as thick as it was
that afternoon, never realizing a target.
Presently, atomized fuel flowed from four
barrels, on a brief journey to the respective tops of
eight solid steel Chrysler pistons. I rammed the
Hurst linkage into reverse and pulled out.
(Actually, it's only a two-barrel.)
Ah, what a summer this will have been. The way
people are running around though, one would think
it still spring. "God," I thought, "it's August,
people should be really bored. Doing nothing but
smoking dope and drinking beer."
I waited for the Trafffic-Actuated Multiple
Independently Targetable Left-Turn Arrow to turn
green. "God," I thought, "that idiot Nixon really

Editor:
I would like to bring to your attention a matter
concerning many student employees at Stanford.

This is the operation of the Residence Manager's
Office, one of Stanford's biggest summer
employers, especially of students on financial aid.
The job of the Residence Manager's Office is to
insure the artistic beauty of the school's residences
for each autumn quarter. The work which can be
provided by the Office is therefore practically
unlimited and of virtually infinite variety.
However, there is a serious problem with the
division of labor. Some student workers are blessed
with easy work, a relaxed atmosphere, and
relatively little worry that their "out-of-sight" job is
going to change. Others, on the other hand, are
faced with wretched jobs, stringent working
conditions, and the depressing knowledge that at
any time they could be transferred to another job,
which would be, more likely than not, worse. These
two categories of workers receive the same wages,
work the same hours, and often have the same
supervisors. Usually assignments to one of these
two groups are randomly issued by the Office,
though many students who "get in good" with
their supervisors or someone in the Office will be
placed in the first category upon their request.
I first started working for the Office in the
spring of '74. Having turned down a job with the
Grounds Dept., where I had worked one year
previous, because of my extreme dislike for hoeing
weeds, I happily reported to my assigned supervisor
in anticipation of the painter's position which I was
told awaited me (painters belonging to the first
category). To my utter dismay I was handed a hoe
and led to a lovely crop of weeds.
Unfortunatey, or maybe fortunately enough, I
had had several serious emotional problems in the
immediately preceeding months and had been
mainlining cocaine for some time. Between the hot
sun and the hoe I was, therefore, quickly reduced
to a vegetable-like state and after a short four day's
work (which was exactly enough for the rent) I
quit, my arms literally about to fall off.
Since that time I have done much other work
for the Office, which was kind enough to re-install
me on their payroll, including scrubbing walls for
weeks on end and more hoeing. In much better
physical and emotional circumstances I now find
the work assigned unpleasant yet tolerable.
However, I get terribly depressed at lunch time
when I meet friends and hear them relate the
luxury of their jobs.
The point I wish to make, sir, is that the
disparity between jobs offered by the Residence
Manger's Office is a! most as great as the economic
inequality of the students of the University itself.

Just the other day, I pulled into the Palo Alto
A&W to watch the sun set. The menu was of no
concern to me: I had been this way before, I knew
what 1 wanted. After mumbling my order into the
intercom-menu, I thought to myself, "God, how
long it's been since we've had smog like this."
The southwest sky was, as does a chameleon in
the Mojave desert, transmutating colors from
white-orange to grey-purple, the sun having long
since found refuge behind an acierative
translucency of nitric oxide. KFRC was playing
Elton John's single, "Don't Let the Sun Go Down
On Me." "God," I thought, "how very ironic."
The carhop, a spry young girl, evidently not long
out of high school, with small, firm breasts (that
bounced slightly as she walked), the one with no
shees, brought me a meal on an orange tray.
And, as I ate, I wondered how people felt fifty
years ago. Were they jealous of us now? I mean,
this smog was certainly not more than the stuff
dreams were made of, as it were. And whose
dreams? Of visionaries, perhaps, or, more
perceptably, of the revolutionists who knew, even
in their stumblings, that the economy mustbreathe
the air of its ways.

provided by the Office is therefore practically
unlimited and of virtually infinite variety.
However, there is a serious problem with the
division of labor. Some student workers are blessed
with easy work, a relaxed atmosphere, and
relatively little worry that their "out-of-sight" job is
going to change. Others, on the other hand, are
faced with wretched jobs, stringent working
conditions, and the depressing knowledge that at
any time they could be transferred to another job,
which would be, more likely than not, worse. These
two categories of workers receive the same wages,
work the same hours, and often have the same
supervisors. Usually assignments to one of these
two groups are randomly issued by the Office,
though many students who "get in good" with
their supervisors or someone in the Office will be
placed in the first category upon their request.
I first started working for the Office in the
spring of '74. Having turned down a job with the
Grounds Dept., where I had worked one year
previous, because of my extreme dislike for hoeing
weeds, I happily reported to my assigned supervisor
in anticipation of the painter's position which I was
told awaited me (painters belonging to the first
category). To my utter dismay I was handed a hoe
and led to a lovely crop of weeds.
Unfortunatey, or maybe fortunately enough, I
had had several serious emotional problems in the
immediately preceeding months and had been
mainlining cocaine for some time. Between the hot
sun and the hoe I was, therefore, quickly reduced
to a vegetable-like state and after a short four day's
work (which was exactly enough for the rent) I
quit, my arms literally about to fall off.
Since that time I have done much other work
for the Office, which was kind enough to re-install
me on their payroll, including scrubbing walls for
weeks on end and more hoeing. In much better
physical and emotional circumstances I now find
the work assigned unpleasant yet tolerable.
However, I get terribly depressed at lunch time
when I meet friends and hear them relate the
luxury of their jobs.
The point I wish to make, sir, is that the
disparity between jobs offered by the Residence
Manger's Office is a! most as great as the economic
inequality of the students of the University itself.

Smoggy Memories
Editor:
Just the other day, I pulled into the Palo Alto
A&W to watch the sun set. The menu was of no
concern to me: I had been this way before, I knew
what 1 wanted. After mumbling my order into the
intercom-menu, I thought to myself, "God, how
long it's been since we've had smog like this."
The southwest sky was, as does a chameleon in
the Mojave desert, transmutating colors from
white-orange to grey-purple, the sun having long
since found refuge behind an acierative
translucency of nitric oxide. KFRC was playing
Elton John's single, "Don't Let the Sun Go Down
On Me." "God," I thought, "how very ironic."
The carhop, a spry young girl, evidently not long
out of high school, with small, firm breasts (that
bounced slightly as she walked), the one with no
shees, brought me a meal on an orange tray.
And, as I ate, I wondered how people felt fifty
years ago. Were they jealous of us now? I mean,
this smog was certainly not more than the stuff
dreams were made of, as it were. And whose
dreams? Of visionaries, perhaps, or, more
perceptably, of the revolutionists who knew, even
in their stumblings, that the economy mustbreathe
the air of its ways.
The girl came to pick up the tray, and I told her
to keep the change. She smiled in a way that told
me how much it meant to her.
She looked like she smoked marijuana. Actually,
she looked sort of like Patty Hearst. Patty Hearst,
where are you? You're over there: up against the
wall (mother ) of a closely watched train.
Bullets go right through smog, as thick as it was
that afternoon, never realizing a target.
Presently, atomized fuel flowed from four
barrels, on a brief journey to the respective tops of
eight solid steel Chrysler pistons. I rammed the
Hurst linkage into reverse and pulled out.
(Actually, it's only a two-barrel.)
Ah, what a summer this will have been. The way
people are running around though, one would think
it still spring. "God," I thought, "it's August,
people should be really bored. Doing nothing but
smoking dope and drinking beer."
I waited for the Trafffic-Actuated Multiple
Independently Targetable Left-Turn Arrow to turn
green. "God," I thought, "that idiot Nixon really
has his head wedged."

Job Disparity
Editor:
I would like to bring to your attention a matter
concerning many student employees at Stanford.

This is the operation of the Residence Manager's
Office, one of Stanford's biggest summer
employers, especially of students on financial aid.
The job of the Residence Manager's Office is to
insure the artistic beauty of the school's residences
for each autumn quarter. The work which can be
provided by the Office is therefore practically
unlimited and of virtually infinite variety.
However, there is a serious problem with the
division of labor. Some student workers are blessed
with easy work, a relaxed atmosphere, and
relatively little worry that their "out-of-sight" job is
going to change. Others, on the other hand, are
faced with wretched jobs, stringent working
conditions, and the depressing knowledge that at
any time they could be transferred to another job,
which would be, more likely than not, worse. These
two categories of workers receive the same wages,
work the same hours, and often have the same
supervisors. Usually assignments to one of these
two groups are randomly issued by the Office,
though many students who "get in good" with
their supervisors or someone in the Office will be
