# Campus Pub Plans Tied Up In Bidding
## 
### 
Plans for an on-campus pub
serving beer and wine are
currently tied up in bidding
procedures, Tresidder Union
Manager Gordon Starr disclosed
late Friday.
"We're now shooting for a
winter quarter opening," he said.
Starr and members of the
University purchasing department
are currently working on a
bidding package which will cover
not only the proposed pub, but
also planned Tresidder cafeteria
changes.
The University recently
decided to change the Tresidder
food service to a fast-food format
and to change the layout of the
cafeteria.
By combining the bid
information on the pub and the
cafeteria the University has
delayed the completion of the bid
proposal Starr admitted. However,
the proposal should be completed

by August 15, he said.
Upon completion, a copy of
the proposal will go to each food
service company that may wish to
bid on the proposed pub.
Several food service companies
have contacted the University
about the project: Guckenheimer,
the holding company for the
Tresidder food service (TDS Inc.);
Interstate United; and Service
Systems, a subsidiary of Del
Monte.
Starr would not disclose the
name of a fourth company that
has contacted him, because, he
said they wish to remain
anonymous.
Last April, the University
reached a "verbal agreement"
with Guckenheimer President
Stewart Ritchie.
However, a dispute over the
written contract emerged early
last month. Although neither side
wished to make the specifics of
the dispute public, Ritchie said
the disagreement was "over
numbers."
Among the administrative
procedures that must be taken
care of after bidding is the
application for the pub's liquor
license. The company that runs
the pub will have to apply for an
"on sale, beer and wine license,"
allowing the pub to sell beer and
wine to persons 21 or older,
according to Ritchie.
Once the application is
submitted to the Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control
(ABC), a 45-day waiting period
follows.
During this period, a "notice of
intent" to sell beer and wine must
be posted for 30 days. Anyone
objecting can demand a hearing,
and such a hearing could further
delay the pub's opening.
