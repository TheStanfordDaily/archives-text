Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON—Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R—Menlo Park,
said last night he feels "a
tremendous amount of hope"
following President Richard
Nixon's resignation.
McCloskey said that "the
sooner we forget [Nixon] and go
forward, the better off we'll all
be."
Emphasizing that "we can't
grant immunity to Nixon if
'justice for all' means anything,"
McCloskey said that Nixon
should be indicted. "Many of
Nixon's former aids are in jail now
for what Nixon did," McCloskey
noted.
Santa Clara Mayor Gary
Gillmor, McCloskey's opponent in
the 12th Congressional district
race, said in Santa Clara last night
that he doesn't think Nixon
should be granted immunity "just
because he was President." He
should face "due process like
anyone else."
Gerald Ford
McCloskey remarked that
"although [Vice President]
Gerald Ford isn't the brightest
man in America, he has good
common sense, honesty and
leadership ability."
Although uncertain about
Ford's vice-presidential selection,
McCloskey said GOP Chairman
George Rush, former Secretary of
Defense Melvin Laird, former
Attorney General Elliot
Richardson and former New York
Governor Nelson Rockefeller are
all excellent candidates.
Although persistent rumors
suggest that Ford will offer
McCloskey a high post in his
administration, McCloskey said he
plans to remain in Congress. After
November, "there will be few
enough of us [Republicans] left
in Congress," he stated. "Ford
will need all [the Republicans] he
can get."
McCloskey said that aside from
restoration of public honesty,
amnesty for draft evaders living
abroad might be one of the Ford
administration's major
accom pi ish ments.
