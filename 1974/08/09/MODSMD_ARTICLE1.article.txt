# NIXON RESIGNS
## McCloskey Feels Hope For Future 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON—Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R—Menlo Park,
said last night he feels "a
tremendous amount of hope"
following President Richard
Nixon's resignation.
McCloskey said that "the
sooner we forget [Nixon] and go
forward, the better off we'll all
be."
Emphasizing that "we can't
grant immunity to Nixon if
'justice for all' means anything,"
McCloskey said that Nixon
should be indicted. "Many of
Nixon's former aids are in jail now
for what Nixon did," McCloskey
noted.
Santa Clara Mayor Gary
Gillmor, McCloskey's opponent in
the 12th Congressional district
race, said in Santa Clara last night
that he doesn't think Nixon
should be granted immunity "just
because he was President." He
should face "due process like
anyone else."
Gerald Ford
McCloskey remarked that
"although [Vice President]
Gerald Ford isn't the brightest
man in America, he has good
common sense, honesty and
leadership ability."
Although uncertain about
Ford's vice-presidential selection,
McCloskey said GOP Chairman
George Rush, former Secretary of
Defense Melvin Laird, former
Attorney General Elliot
Richardson and former New York
Governor Nelson Rockefeller are
all excellent candidates.
Although persistent rumors
suggest that Ford will offer
McCloskey a high post in his
administration, McCloskey said he
plans to remain in Congress. After
November, "there will be few
enough of us [Republicans] left
in Congress," he stated. "Ford
will need all [the Republicans] he
can get."
McCloskey said that aside from
restoration of public honesty,
amnesty for draft evaders living
abroad might be one of the Ford
administration's major
accom pi ish ments.

RESIGNATION—President Richard Nixon told a national television
audience last night that he would resign, effective 9 a.m. today, P.D.T.
Mike Lopez, director of
Stanford-In-Washington agreed
that the Ford administration
might grant amnesty, but said that
the resignation's "effect on
government has yet to be seen."
Noting that almost all
Stanford interns felt intense
displeasure with the Nixon
administration, Lopez guessed
that most greeted the resignation
with a sense of relief that the
Watergate ordeal was ending.
No Stanford intern has served
either Nixon or Ford, Lopez
said.
Valerie Dow, a Stanford history
expressed "curiosity about
what Ford will do for the real
problems still in existence."
Dow said she was pleased that
"Nixon's speech was honorable
and not vindicative." She noted
that earlier she and some other
interns wondered whether Nixon
would deliver an angry speech in
the style of his 1962 "last press
conference."
Dow declared that she was glad
that Nixon resigned rather than to
allow the impeachment process to
occur. She said she doubted
whether Nixon will now assume
the role of a martyr who might
have been spared conviction even
if he had remained in office.

Santa Clara Mayor Gary
Gillmor, McCloskey's opponent in
the 12th Congressional district
race, said in Santa Clara last night
that he doesn't think Nixon
should be granted immunity "just
because he was President." He
should face "due process like
anyone else."
Gerald Ford
McCloskey remarked that
"although [Vice President]
Gerald Ford isn't the brightest
man in America, he has good
common sense, honesty and
leadership ability."
Although uncertain about
Ford's vice-presidential selection,
McCloskey said GOP Chairman
George Rush, former Secretary of
Defense Melvin Laird, former
Attorney General Elliot
Richardson and former New York
Governor Nelson Rockefeller are
all excellent candidates.
Although persistent rumors
suggest that Ford will offer
McCloskey a high post in his
administration, McCloskey said he
plans to remain in Congress. After
November, "there will be few
enough of us [Republicans] left
in Congress," he stated. "Ford
will need all [the Republicans] he
can get."
McCloskey said that aside from
restoration of public honesty,
amnesty for draft evaders living
abroad might be one of the Ford
administration's major
accom pi ish ments.

RESIGNATION—President Richard Nixon told a national television
audience last night that he would resign, effective 9 a.m. today, P.D.T.
Mike Lopez, director of
Stanford-In-Washington agreed
that the Ford administration
might grant amnesty, but said that
the resignation's "effect on
government has yet to be seen."
Noting that almost all
Stanford interns felt intense
displeasure with the Nixon
administration, Lopez guessed
that most greeted the resignation
with a sense of relief that the
Watergate ordeal was ending.
No Stanford intern has served
either Nixon or Ford, Lopez
said.
Valerie Dow, a Stanford history
expressed "curiosity about
what Ford will do for the real
problems still in existence."
Dow said she was pleased that
"Nixon's speech was honorable
and not vindicative." She noted
that earlier she and some other
interns wondered whether Nixon
would deliver an angry speech in
the style of his 1962 "last press
conference."
Dow declared that she was glad
that Nixon resigned rather than to
allow the impeachment process to
occur. She said she doubted
whether Nixon will now assume
the role of a martyr who might
have been spared conviction even
if he had remained in office.
Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON—Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R—Menlo Park,
said last night he feels "a
tremendous amount of hope"
following President Richard
Nixon's resignation.
McCloskey said that "the
sooner we forget [Nixon] and go
forward, the better off we'll all
be."
Emphasizing that "we can't
grant immunity to Nixon if
'justice for all' means anything,"
McCloskey said that Nixon
should be indicted. "Many of
Nixon's former aids are in jail now
for what Nixon did," McCloskey
noted.
