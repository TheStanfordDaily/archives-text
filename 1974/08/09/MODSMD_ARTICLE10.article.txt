# TDS Employees Favor Unionization
## 
### DON COX 
Campus employees of TDS Inc.
voted 19-6 yesterday to have the
United Stanford Employees
(USE) union represent their
bargaining unit.
Employees from the Tresidder
cafeteria, Encina Snack Bar, and
the Coffee House, constitute the
new unit which includes some
students.
USE has said it will fight the
planned layoff next week of 30
cafeteria workers as TDS converts
the cafeteria to a fast-food format
as an economy move.
USE attorney Marty Eichner
said last night that he hopes they
can force TDS to compromise
their plans so that not as many
workers will be laid off.
Yesterday's vote will remain
only a preliminary figure pending

the resolution of about 17 votes
cast that were challenged. These
votes were challenged, Eichner
said, because the workers in
question joined the unit since
May, when the unionization
election was originally scheduled.
It was postponed until yesterday
by the National Labor Relations
Board.
Student cafeteria employee
Dean Morris said "there is no
indication that the 17 votes in
question will have any effect on
the 19-6 margin."
The majority of the Tresidder

workers who will be laid off have
not found alternative employment
Morris said. TDS and the
University have said they will try
to help the workers find work.
"The prospects for a food job
at Stanford are pretty bleak," he
said.
The cafeteria workers
sponsored a boycott of the
cafeteria Wednesday and set up an
alternative food supply outside
the cafeteria. Eichner said the
boycott was "very successful" and
that the cafeteria "was empty for
most of the day." He said they

sold over 200 sandwiches in the
alternative food supply run by the
workers and USE.
The alternative food service
offered homemade sandwiches
and coffee.
The University decided to close
the cafeteria August 17 since it
has run up debts totalling $1.3
million in the past six years.
The projected deficit for this
year is about $100,000.
USE and the cafeteria workers
have suggested that a boycott of
the fast-food operation next fall
might be one method of putting

pressure on the University.
University officials have
indicated that if the boycott
continued into the fall and was
successful, the University would
shut down Tresidder food
operations (except for the Coffee
House) entirely before it would
reopen the cafeteria.
The conversion of the cafeteria
to a fast-food format is just one
facet of a long range plan being
developed to remodel Tresidder
Union.
The remodelling of the union
may cost as much as $250,000.

Union.
The remodelling of the union
may cost as much as $250,000.
Campus employees of TDS Inc.
voted 19-6 yesterday to have the
United Stanford Employees
(USE) union represent their
bargaining unit.
Employees from the Tresidder
cafeteria, Encina Snack Bar, and
the Coffee House, constitute the
new unit which includes some
students.
USE has said it will fight the
planned layoff next week of 30
cafeteria workers as TDS converts
the cafeteria to a fast-food format
as an economy move.
USE attorney Marty Eichner
said last night that he hopes they
can force TDS to compromise
their plans so that not as many
workers will be laid off.
Yesterday's vote will remain
only a preliminary figure pending

the resolution of about 17 votes
cast that were challenged. These
votes were challenged, Eichner
said, because the workers in
question joined the unit since
May, when the unionization
election was originally scheduled.
It was postponed until yesterday
by the National Labor Relations
Board.
Student cafeteria employee
Dean Morris said "there is no
indication that the 17 votes in
question will have any effect on
the 19-6 margin."
The majority of the Tresidder

workers who will be laid off have
not found alternative employment
Morris said. TDS and the
University have said they will try
to help the workers find work.
"The prospects for a food job
at Stanford are pretty bleak," he
said.
The cafeteria workers
sponsored a boycott of the
cafeteria Wednesday and set up an
alternative food supply outside
the cafeteria. Eichner said the
boycott was "very successful" and
that the cafeteria "was empty for
most of the day." He said they

sold over 200 sandwiches in the
alternative food supply run by the
workers and USE.
The alternative food service
offered homemade sandwiches
and coffee.
The University decided to close
the cafeteria August 17 since it
has run up debts totalling $1.3
million in the past six years.
The projected deficit for this
year is about $100,000.
USE and the cafeteria workers
have suggested that a boycott of
the fast-food operation next fall
might be one method of putting

pressure on the University.
University officials have
indicated that if the boycott
continued into the fall and was
successful, the University would
shut down Tresidder food
operations (except for the Coffee
House) entirely before it would
reopen the cafeteria.
The conversion of the cafeteria
to a fast-food format is just one
facet of a long range plan being
developed to remodel Tresidder
Union.
