# Ford: A 'Middle American'
## 
### 
Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr., who ascends to
the Presidency today, in many ways typifies
the "ideal man" of "middle America."
Ford was born July 14, 1913, in Omaha,
Nebraska, and christened Leslie King.
Two years later, his parents divorced. His
mother moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan,
and married Gerald Rudolph Ford, Sr., who
adopted her son and gave him his name.
Ford grew up in Grand Rapids, winning
All-State football honors in school and
earning money waiting on tables and washing
dishes.
He entered the University of Michigan,
and played center on the school's national
championship football teams of 1932 and
1933. He was named Most Valuable Player
on the team in 1934 and played in several
All-Star games.
After graduation, Ford turned down pro
football offers to enter Yale Law School. He
received his degree in 1941, and set up

practice in Grand Rapids.
Ford spent four years as an aviation
operations officer in the Navy, and emerged
as a lieutenant commander.
In 1948, after returning to law practice,
Ford upset an incumbent isolationist in the
Congressional primary and was elected to the
House by a wide margin.
In the House, Ford moved up the ranks
quickly because of his party loyalty and
quiet hard work. He soon got a seat on the
powerful Appropriations Committee.
In 1965, Ford, backed by younger
Congressmen, overthrew Charles Halleck of
Indiana to become House minority leader.
His record favored a strong defense and
the Vietnam War, strong environmental
protection and opposed many "Great
Society" programs. He helped develop
Republican domestic alternatives to President
Johnson's programs.
Ford's ambition was to become Speaker

of the House and campaigned vigorously for
GOP House candidates.
When Richard Nixon became President,
Ford became one of his most loyal
supporters and helped push many of the
President's policies through the House.
In November, 1973, Nixon appointed him
Vice President to succeed Spiro Agnew. Ford
was quickly confirmed.
Ford married Elizabeth Bloomer in 1948.
The couple has three sons, Michael, John and
Steven, and one daughter, Susan. He is an
Episcopalian and member of the American
Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars.
In 1961, he received the "Distinguished
Congressional Service Award" of the
American Political Science Association. Two
years later, President Johnson appointed him
to the "Warren Commission," which
investigated the assassination of President
Kennedy.

Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr., who ascends to
the Presidency today, in many ways typifies
the "ideal man" of "middle America."
Ford was born July 14, 1913, in Omaha,
Nebraska, and christened Leslie King.
Two years later, his parents divorced. His
mother moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan,
and married Gerald Rudolph Ford, Sr., who
adopted her son and gave him his name.
Ford grew up in Grand Rapids, winning
All-State football honors in school and
earning money waiting on tables and washing
dishes.
He entered the University of Michigan,
and played center on the school's national
championship football teams of 1932 and
1933. He was named Most Valuable Player
on the team in 1934 and played in several
All-Star games.
After graduation, Ford turned down pro
football offers to enter Yale Law School. He
received his degree in 1941, and set up

practice in Grand Rapids.
Ford spent four years as an aviation
operations officer in the Navy, and emerged
as a lieutenant commander.
In 1948, after returning to law practice,
Ford upset an incumbent isolationist in the
Congressional primary and was elected to the
House by a wide margin.
In the House, Ford moved up the ranks
quickly because of his party loyalty and
quiet hard work. He soon got a seat on the
powerful Appropriations Committee.
In 1965, Ford, backed by younger
Congressmen, overthrew Charles Halleck of
Indiana to become House minority leader.
His record favored a strong defense and
the Vietnam War, strong environmental
protection and opposed many "Great
Society" programs. He helped develop
Republican domestic alternatives to President
Johnson's programs.
