# California Politicians State Diverse Views
## 
### 
Californians expressed reactions as diverse as the state itself to the
resignation of the state's native son President, Richard Nixon.
Jerry Voorhis, the congressman whom Nixon defeated in 1946 to
launch his political career, said he was relieved at Nixon's resignation.
He said that the purpose of the Nixon administration was "unlimited
power at the expense of the legislative right of the Congress."
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Sr., who beat Nixon for the
governorship in 1962, said the resignation was a "tragic end to a
career I thought I had terminated in 1962."
Band Together
Brown's son, Edmund Jr., who is now running for the governorship
said that "narrow partisanship" should be ignored and that the nation
should band together behind Gerald Ford.
Brown's opponent, Republican Houston Flournoy, expressed his
best wishes for the new President. Flournoy had previously urged
Nixon's resignation.
The two most recent mayors of Los Angeles had different
reactions. A statement issued by Mayor Tom Bradley called the
resignation "a moment of sadness and agony for the nation." He said,
however, that the actions of the press, courts, and Congress showed
the vitality of the American system.
Out Of Proportion
His predecessor, Sam Yorty, said the Watergate incident was blown
out of proportion. Of the Watergate cover-up, Yorty said "Naturally,
he |Nixon] didn't want it to come out after the election or we'd have
had McGovern as President." Yorty is a Democrat who backed Nixon
in 1972.
San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto said that there is new hope of
solutions for urban problems now that Ford is President. He said
Nixon ignored the problems of American cities while "strangling in its
web."
Two former Nixon aides living in California expressed sorrow over
the resignation. Former Communications Director Herb Klein said "I
think history will mark [this administration] as one that
accomplished more in foreign policy than any other."
He said Nixon should be granted immunity. Another former aide,
Robert Finch, said Nixon showed "class" in his resignation speech, as
he had done after losing the 1960 Presidential election.
Comment on Nixon's resignation in his home town of Whittier was
described as gentle, though most people thought it was the right thing
to do.
But in San Clemente, a prominent Republican, Farrell Smith, said
Nixon should sell his home there because "the people of California
don't want him."
