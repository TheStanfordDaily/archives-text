# Students, Staff Laugh At President's Speech
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
In marked contrast to the
mood of the public figures and
CBS announcers who appeared on
the television screen last night,
many Stanford students and staff
members laughed at Richard
Nixon.
About 100 persons jammed
into Tresidder's reading room to
listen to Nixon's resignation
address. The predominantly
young, male crowd waited
impatiently in the hot, stuffy
room for the President to begin
speaking.
Before the speech, when an
announcer said "San Francisco is
not friendly to President Nixon,"
they cheered.
When Nixon appeared on the
screen, about half the crowd
laughed, the other half shushed
them. While the audience listened
attentively, it also laughed at
Nixon six or seven times during
the speech.
Nixon drew derisive laughter
for remarks such as "I put the
interest of the nation before
personal consideration," and"I
am not a quitter."
Several times, Nixon pauses
were filled by murmured
comments. "I have acted in what I
considered the nation's best
interests," Nixon said. "Bullshit,"
came the reply.

Or, .. In Gerald Ford, the
nation will be in good hands."
"Better hands."
Only once did Nixon visibly
impress anyone, that being when
he said the US. and U.S.S.R.
should eventually destroy their
nuclear weapons.
Few people showed any
reaction at all after the speech,
though there was a scattered war
whoop or two.
"He was pretty ridiculous,"
one student said. "It was pretty
good they [the audience] didn't
turn him off after he said he'd
resign."
An old man said, "He's always
an actor. He was like that when I
saw him in 1949 in San
Francisco."
A man complained "he didn't
say anything." A woman student
called him "pretty sleazy. I think
he'll manage to squirm out of the
whole thing."
A couple of people, only a
couple, walked away quickly after
Nixon's speech, without waiting
for Roger Mudd's harsh analysis,
with tears in their eyes.
"He couldn't have said it any
better," one woman said. "They
can't expect him to talk about
Watergate."
But evidently, many of them
did.
