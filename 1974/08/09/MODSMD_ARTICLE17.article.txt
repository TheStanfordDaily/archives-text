# Tresidder Board—Anonymous?
## 
### CAROL MOLDAW 
If you saw Dial M for Murder this summer
you were attending Tresidder's Hitchcock
Festival. ...
If you toured Alcatraz, you were part of a
Tresidder sponsored trip. ...
If you heard John Kaplan speak on
impeachment or I. Slim Ingham give
consumer advise, you heard part of
Tresidder's lecture series. ...
If you took a crafts class and learned to
dye wool or work with leather, Tresidder
arranged your class....
Did you know that? If you didn't, you
aren't alone.
Board Anonymous
Even students attending some of
Tresidder's varied events often don't know
Tresidder is sponsoring them. Although most
of the events are well-attended,
well-organized and interesting, the board
itself seems anonymous.
And those who do know about Tresidder
say the inactivity and boredom of summer
quarter enhanced the board's importance.
Tresidder events are "overshadowed during
the year," one student commented.
Not so, says Roger Thacker, adviser to the

Program Board. Thacker says Tresidder is just
"getting its feet on the ground" and
attributes its relative prominence to its new
programs, not just to the lack of other
activities.
Real Test
Tresidder's real test, he says will come
during fall quarter, when the board plans to
expand its programs further.
The lecture and film series will continue in
the fall and the crafts classes will expand to
four or five nights weekly, Thacker adds.
Fall planning involves two major projects
— a four-to-five day symposium on black,
chicano, American Indian and
Asian-American cultures, and the Christmas
Crafts Fair.
The Christmas Crafts Fair is not new, but
Tresidder sponsorship is. Last year Thacker
and Community Services Manager Jean
Martin organized the fair and this year
Thacker says he intends to make it much
more of a community project through
Tresidder.
Student Involvement
One of the purposes for the cultural
symposium — slated to include cultural
exhibits, lectures, dances and a panel
discussion — is also student involvement,
Thacker says.
The board should do what they "haven't
done so far ... get more students involved in
programs the board is sponsoring . . . involve
students who are not part of the program
board," he adds.
Thacker says"the main goal of the board
is to make Tresidder a real community center
with lots of activities for lots of people."
He envisions the Program Board as both
an idea board which takes its plans to the
students for instigation and as a sounding
board which can help students organize and
fulfill their plans for the campus.
Just Plans?
So far these are just plans. Interest in the
board has extended to their entertainment
and cultural events, but seems to stop short
of committment or community zeal.
One sophomore, attending a

Tresidder-sponsored lecture, said "sure if the
event is appealing I'll go, but the board
doesn't affect my community."
Another student said, "I don't know the
first thing about the board, I just came to
hear Kaplan."
Change On The Way
Thacker, however, sees change on the
way. He says"the board has never made an
attempt to go out and say 'hey, the Tresidder
Board is here — rah, rah, rah' and it still
won't."
But Thacker says he believes a lot of
students really do want to get involved and
now one of TYesidder's goals is "to involve as
many people as it can."
The enigma is how. Even now, with a
revitalized program, Tresidder remains
relatively anonymous. Without further
publicity, how does the board plan to reach
and involve more students?
Student Organizations
Thacker says, "One of the most effective
ways to involve students is to sponsor
programs that involve other student
organizations."
For example, Thacker says the Program
Board could not present the cultural
symposium without the "active participation
of the Black Student Union (BSU), the
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztland
(MEChA), the Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO) and the Asian Students
Coordinating Committee."
The crafts fair presents a different
problem, since there are no organizations to
work through. For this Thacker says the
board will "advertise heavily . .. give advance
warning ... and just keep at it."
Tresidder's new programs and
organization were instigated one and a half
years ago after an almost five year period of
inactivity. In 1968 the first Tresidder
Memorial Union (TMU) director left and the
budget was eliminated. As of now there is no
governing Tresidder Union Board, only the
Program Board which sponsors the Tresidder
activities and consists of faculty, staff and
students.

now one of TYesidder's goals is "to involve as
many people as it can."
The enigma is how. Even now, with a
revitalized program, Tresidder remains
relatively anonymous. Without further
publicity, how does the board plan to reach
and involve more students?
Student Organizations
Thacker says, "One of the most effective
ways to involve students is to sponsor
programs that involve other student
organizations."
For example, Thacker says the Program
Board could not present the cultural
symposium without the "active participation
of the Black Student Union (BSU), the
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztland
(MEChA), the Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO) and the Asian Students
Coordinating Committee."
The crafts fair presents a different
problem, since there are no organizations to
work through. For this Thacker says the
board will "advertise heavily . .. give advance
warning ... and just keep at it."
Tresidder's new programs and
organization were instigated one and a half
years ago after an almost five year period of
inactivity. In 1968 the first Tresidder
Memorial Union (TMU) director left and the
budget was eliminated. As of now there is no
governing Tresidder Union Board, only the
Program Board which sponsors the Tresidder
activities and consists of faculty, staff and
students.

If you saw Dial M for Murder this summer
you were attending Tresidder's Hitchcock
Festival. ...
If you toured Alcatraz, you were part of a
Tresidder sponsored trip. ...
If you heard John Kaplan speak on
impeachment or I. Slim Ingham give
consumer advise, you heard part of
Tresidder's lecture series. ...
If you took a crafts class and learned to
dye wool or work with leather, Tresidder
arranged your class....
Did you know that? If you didn't, you
aren't alone.
Board Anonymous
Even students attending some of
Tresidder's varied events often don't know
Tresidder is sponsoring them. Although most
of the events are well-attended,
well-organized and interesting, the board
itself seems anonymous.
And those who do know about Tresidder
say the inactivity and boredom of summer
quarter enhanced the board's importance.
Tresidder events are "overshadowed during
the year," one student commented.
Not so, says Roger Thacker, adviser to the

Program Board. Thacker says Tresidder is just
"getting its feet on the ground" and
attributes its relative prominence to its new
programs, not just to the lack of other
activities.
Real Test
Tresidder's real test, he says will come
during fall quarter, when the board plans to
expand its programs further.
The lecture and film series will continue in
the fall and the crafts classes will expand to
four or five nights weekly, Thacker adds.
Fall planning involves two major projects
— a four-to-five day symposium on black,
chicano, American Indian and
Asian-American cultures, and the Christmas
Crafts Fair.
The Christmas Crafts Fair is not new, but
Tresidder sponsorship is. Last year Thacker
and Community Services Manager Jean
Martin organized the fair and this year
Thacker says he intends to make it much
more of a community project through
Tresidder.
Student Involvement
One of the purposes for the cultural
symposium — slated to include cultural
exhibits, lectures, dances and a panel
discussion — is also student involvement,
Thacker says.
The board should do what they "haven't
done so far ... get more students involved in
programs the board is sponsoring . . . involve
students who are not part of the program
board," he adds.
Thacker says"the main goal of the board
is to make Tresidder a real community center
with lots of activities for lots of people."
He envisions the Program Board as both
an idea board which takes its plans to the
students for instigation and as a sounding
board which can help students organize and
fulfill their plans for the campus.
Just Plans?
So far these are just plans. Interest in the
board has extended to their entertainment
and cultural events, but seems to stop short
of committment or community zeal.
One sophomore, attending a

Tresidder-sponsored lecture, said "sure if the
event is appealing I'll go, but the board
doesn't affect my community."
Another student said, "I don't know the
first thing about the board, I just came to
hear Kaplan."
Change On The Way
Thacker, however, sees change on the
way. He says"the board has never made an
attempt to go out and say 'hey, the Tresidder
Board is here — rah, rah, rah' and it still
won't."
But Thacker says he believes a lot of
students really do want to get involved and
now one of TYesidder's goals is "to involve as
many people as it can."

Thacker says.
The board should do what they "haven't
done so far ... get more students involved in
programs the board is sponsoring . . . involve
students who are not part of the program
board," he adds.
Thacker says"the main goal of the board
is to make Tresidder a real community center
with lots of activities for lots of people."
He envisions the Program Board as both
an idea board which takes its plans to the
students for instigation and as a sounding
board which can help students organize and
fulfill their plans for the campus.
Just Plans?
So far these are just plans. Interest in the
board has extended to their entertainment
and cultural events, but seems to stop short
of committment or community zeal.
One sophomore, attending a

Tresidder-sponsored lecture, said "sure if the
event is appealing I'll go, but the board
doesn't affect my community."
Another student said, "I don't know the
first thing about the board, I just came to
hear Kaplan."
Change On The Way
Thacker, however, sees change on the
way. He says"the board has never made an
attempt to go out and say 'hey, the Tresidder
Board is here — rah, rah, rah' and it still
won't."
But Thacker says he believes a lot of
students really do want to get involved and
now one of TYesidder's goals is "to involve as
many people as it can."
The enigma is how. Even now, with a
revitalized program, Tresidder remains
relatively anonymous. Without further
publicity, how does the board plan to reach
and involve more students?
Student Organizations
Thacker says, "One of the most effective
ways to involve students is to sponsor
programs that involve other student
organizations."
For example, Thacker says the Program
Board could not present the cultural
symposium without the "active participation
of the Black Student Union (BSU), the
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztland
(MEChA), the Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO) and the Asian Students
Coordinating Committee."
The crafts fair presents a different
problem, since there are no organizations to
work through. For this Thacker says the
board will "advertise heavily . .. give advance
warning ... and just keep at it."
Tresidder's new programs and
organization were instigated one and a half
years ago after an almost five year period of
inactivity. In 1968 the first Tresidder
Memorial Union (TMU) director left and the
budget was eliminated. As of now there is no
governing Tresidder Union Board, only the
Program Board which sponsors the Tresidder
activities and consists of faculty, staff and
students.
