# Profs Give Mixed Reaction

President Nixon's resignation
was met with general approval
among faculty members here
though they were in disagreement
over whether Nixon should be
prosecuted further by either
Congress or Special Prosecutor
Leon Jaworski.
Law Prof. John Kaplan said
Jaworski has "an airtight case
against Nixon for obstruction of
justice. The question is whether to
prosecute, and that's their [the
Justice Department] business."
"Do you want to give amnesty
to people [like Vietnam draft
dodgers] who commit crimes?
Nixon says no. Jaworski right now
has the decision to make, and
nobody else," he said.
"I frankly don't like, on
aesthetic grounds, prosecuting a
former President of the United
States; but his lieutenants were
prosecuted," he said.
Kaplan said it would "be a
dumb thing" for Congress to
pursue its impeachment
investigation and/or trial of
Nixon. Kaplan said because of the
uncertainty of whether Congress
can proceed with an impeachment
trial after Nixon has resigned, he
might be acquitted by members
who think the Congress has no
jurisdiction.

NEW CHIEF—Vice President Gerald Ford, shown above at the
California Republican convention earlier this year, will be sworn in as
President this morning.
President Richard Lyman, a
former History professor said last
night that "It does seem as if the
whole story should come out,"
and advocated further prosecution
of the case "if the facts warrant
it."
"I have a strong feeling that all
citizens should be equal before
the law, as nearly as possible as
this can be achieved," he said.
History Prof. David Kennedy
said he had "a sense of
considerable dismay that Nixon
never admitted guilt, leaving open
the possibility that he will be a
martyr figure for the right wing
for the next generation. He might
claim he was the victim of
partisan prosecution."
Kennedy said that the case
must be further prosecuted to
bring out the facts to "prove to
the public that the real reason for
his expulsion from office was
wrong-doing on his part."
He also speculated that "Ford
had the opportunity to earn
something of a recognizable place
in history by virtue of his
plainness and straight
forwardness," something the
country might be looking for after
a turbulent past decade.
Political Science Prof. Robert

Horn said that he doesn't favor
further prosecution of Nixon. "I
don't see that this would really
add to the punishment of the
President. I recognize the problem
of others being prosecuted for the
same thing," but Horn said he
didn't see a possible prison term
for Nixon as accomplishing
anything.
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall said he thought Nixon
should be prosecuted further.
Any grant of immunity to
Nixon might "fatally destroy the
citizen's confidence that our
government administers justice
equally."
