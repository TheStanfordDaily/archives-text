# Profs Give Mixed Reaction

President Nixon's resignation
was met with general approval
among faculty members here
though they were in disagreement
over whether Nixon should be
prosecuted further by either
Congress or Special Prosecutor
Leon Jaworski.
Law Prof. John Kaplan said
Jaworski has "an airtight case
against Nixon for obstruction of
justice. The question is whether to
prosecute, and that's their [the
Justice Department] business."
"Do you want to give amnesty
to people [like Vietnam draft
dodgers] who commit crimes?
Nixon says no. Jaworski right now
has the decision to make, and
nobody else," he said.
"I frankly don't like, on
aesthetic grounds, prosecuting a
former President of the United
States; but his lieutenants were
prosecuted," he said.
Kaplan said it would "be a
dumb thing" for Congress to
pursue its impeachment
investigation and/or trial of
Nixon. Kaplan said because of the
uncertainty of whether Congress
can proceed with an impeachment
trial after Nixon has resigned, he
might be acquitted by members
who think the Congress has no
jurisdiction.
