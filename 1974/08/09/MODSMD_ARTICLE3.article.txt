# Ford Assumes Office Today
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Richard
Milhous Nixon, the 37th President
of the United States, announced
to the nation last night that he
will step down in favor of Vice
President Gerald Ford today at 9
a.m. P.D.T., marking the first time
in history an American President
has left office by resignation.
Nixon's announcement came in
a nationally-broadcast address in
which he based his resignation on
a loss of the "political base
necessary in Congress to continue
the fight" against impending
impeachment proceedings.
Sitting at his desk in the White
House's Oval Office, Nixon said
he was "not a quitter" and that he
would have preferred to carry

through with the impeachment
process until the end, despite the
personal anguish involved.
'Best Interest'
His resignation now, however,
was in the "best interest" of the
nation, the President said, adding
that a fight in the months ahead
would dilute the power of both
the President and the Congress at
a crucial time in the nation's
history.
Nixon told the nation that his
family had strongly advised him
to sta> in office, but he noted
that America "needs a full-time
President."
The President also said he
harbored no bitterness toward his
opponents. He explained that
they too had the interests of the
nation at heart, but saw the
picture differently.
No Confession
Nixon did not admit guilt in
the Watergate burglary and
cover-up in his address.
It was Nixon's admission
Monday that he knew six days
after the Watergate break-in of
top-level involvement in the
scandal and that he acted to
impede an FBI investigation into
the matter that brought the
congressional calls for
impeachment and resignation to a
fevered pitch.
"If some of my judgments
were wrong — and some were — I
believe they were made in the best
interest of the nation," Nixon said
in a firm voice.
Nixon's decision to resign had
filtered down through staff and
congressional news leaks. Nixon
met with Ford early in the day for
70 minutes to discuss his decision,
sources said.
'Good Hands'
In turning the Presidency to
Ford, Nixon said, "I know . . . the
leadership of America will be in
good hands." He added that Ford
will need "understanding,
patience, cooperation" from all
Americans.
Chief Justice Warren Burger
will cut short his European
vacation and fly back to
Washington to administer the oath
of office to Ford.
Nixon indicated he will not
attend Ford's swearing in but will
fly back to his San Clemente
home, as a private citizen. Nixon's
wife Pat, daughters Tricia and
Julie and their husbands Edward
Cox and David Eisenhower will
accompany the President.
After Nixon finished his
16-minute address, Ford praised
Nixon for making a great personal
sacrifice to the country in
resignation.

In his public statement, made
form his Arlington, Va. home, the
Vice President also announced
that Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger had agreed to remain
during the Ford administration
and direct U.S. foreign policy.
Ford termed Nixon's
resignation "one of the saddest
incidents I have witnessed."
His words were echoed by Sen.
Barry Goldwater, R—Ariz., who
said the "two saddest days of my
life were yesterday and today."
Goldwater said "I am sorry
about it from a personal point of
view and what it means to the
nation, but it had to come."
Senate Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield, D—Mont., urged that
the impeachment process
continue despite Nixon's
resignation. But House Speaker
Carl Albert, D—Okla., rejected
this proposal and announced that
the impeachment process would
come to a halt.
Sen. George McGovern,
D~S.D., who Nixon defeated to
win re-election in 1972, agreed
with Albert, saying the
constitutional purpose for
impeachment had been fulfilled,
even though it was not carried out
to its conclusion.
McGovern, the victim of "dirty
tricks" during the 1972 campaign,
said he felt "sympathy" for Nixon
and his family.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey,
D—Minn., whom Nixon narrowly
beat to win his first term as
President, said Nixon resigned "in
a very noble manner."
McGovern, Humphrey and Sen.
Edward Kennedy, I>—Mass., all
pledged their support for Ford.
Kennedy said, "Let all of us join
together in rebuilding confidence
and trust in our system of
government. The night of
Watergate is over.
Sen. Edward Brooke, R—Mass.,
earlier in the day introduced a
congressional resolution that
Nixon be spared criminal
prosecution should he resign.
However, Brooke, the first Senate
Republican to call for Nixon's
resignation nine months ago, said
he felt the President must make a
full confession.
Congressional leaders and

Justice Department officials made
the same type of confession
amnesty deal with former Vice
President Spiro Agnew in his
bribery case last year.
However, Brook's suggestion
did not meet with congressional
enthusiasm. Mansfield commented
that the resolution would raise "a
grave constitutional question of
the separation of powers."
Rabbi Baruch Korff, one of
Nixon's foremost defenders, said
Nixon is resigning to spare the
nation "months of anguished
stalemate." He blamed the scandal
on "unchecked media giants and
vested interest groups."
