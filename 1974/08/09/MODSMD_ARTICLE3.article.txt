# Ford Assumes Office Today

### 
WASHINGTON - Richard
Milhous Nixon, the 37th President
of the United States, announced
to the nation last night that he
will step down in favor of Vice
President Gerald Ford today at 9
a.m. P.D.T., marking the first time
in history an American President
has left office by resignation.
Nixon's announcement came in
a nationally-broadcast address in
which he based his resignation on
a loss of the "political base
necessary in Congress to continue
the fight" against impending
impeachment proceedings.
Sitting at his desk in the White
House's Oval Office, Nixon said
he was "not a quitter" and that he
would have preferred to carry

through with the impeachment
process until the end, despite the
personal anguish involved.
'Best Interest'
His resignation now, however,
was in the "best interest" of the
nation, the President said, adding
that a fight in the months ahead
would dilute the power of both
the President and the Congress at
a crucial time in the nation's
history.
Nixon told the nation that his
family had strongly advised him
to sta> in office, but he noted
that America "needs a full-time
President."
The President also said he
harbored no bitterness toward his
opponents. He explained that
they too had the interests of the
nation at heart, but saw the
picture differently.
No Confession
Nixon did not admit guilt in
the Watergate burglary and
cover-up in his address.
It was Nixon's admission
Monday that he knew six days
after the Watergate break-in of
top-level involvement in the
scandal and that he acted to
impede an FBI investigation into
the matter that brought the
congressional calls for
impeachment and resignation to a
fevered pitch.
"If some of my judgments
were wrong — and some were — I
believe they were made in the best
interest of the nation," Nixon said
in a firm voice.
Nixon's decision to resign had
filtered down through staff and
congressional news leaks. Nixon
met with Ford early in the day for
70 minutes to discuss his decision,
sources said.
'Good Hands'
In turning the Presidency to
Ford, Nixon said, "I know . . . the
leadership of America will be in
good hands." He added that Ford
will need "understanding,
patience, cooperation" from all
Americans.
Chief Justice Warren Burger
will cut short his European
vacation and fly back to
Washington to administer the oath
of office to Ford.
Nixon indicated he will not
