## Nixon Resigns 
### 
Though long and eagerly awaited by many, the resignation of
President Nixon is a solemn event.
His fall from power represents a significant loss to the country in
some respects. His administration handled foreign policy in an
exemplary fashion, better than any other recent regime. It is to
Nixon's credit that he was able to overcome his "cold warrior"
prejudices in order to help lessen world tensions.
But Nixon was simultaneously guilty of subverting the
Constitution and grossly abusing the powers of the Presidency. In his
quest for peace and order abroad and at home, he showed reckless
disregard for the rights of his opposition and compromised the course
of justice.
It was not Nixon's treachery or malice that sponsored the
Watergate cover-up, and the abuse of executive agencies, but rather a
tragic set of values that led him to exemplify the shoddiest standards
of professional conduct.
While the national consensus to remove Nixon was undoubtedly
formed in part because of Nixon's conduct in office, he also lost the
trust of the American people because he let them down.
They had re-elected him in 1968 because they sought a long-lost
serenity. They wanted to be able to pick up the newspaper or turn on
the TV and find no mention of riots, long-hairs, wars or rights
movements on the front page.
But Nixon could not give the people the tranquility they desired,
as scandal after scandal stole the headlines. The people initially turned
on the press for uncovering his misdeeds, as they refused to believe
the press accounts.
With the release of the tapes the allegations became fact.
They now turn to Gerald Ford to synthesize or restore the placid
scenes they dream of. Perhaps, they don't exist.
But more importantly, our constitutional system survives and is
strengthened. This sad date has proved that the President is
accountable to the people at all times, a basic principle of our
democracy. The resolution of this issue has and will take considerable
time. The wheels of justice grind slowly, but ever so finely.
Through our resolve to maintain our system of justice, we can be
the exemplary spirit that guides the world, the symbol of freedom,
liberty and equality of mankind.
Over 13 years ago, President Kennedy told us to begin building a
new and better nation. While some may charge that we have
squandered the first of his 1000-year timetable, we have struggled to
feed our poor, care for our sick, and guarantee the rights of all men.
They have been turbulent years, but we have succeeded in part to lay
the foundation for that better nation. There remains the task of
building that dream.
Now, truly, let us begin.
