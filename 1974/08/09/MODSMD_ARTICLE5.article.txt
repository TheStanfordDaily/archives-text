Un-Free Beaches
Editor:
I am afraid that your "Free
Beaches" article (August 6) is
already out of date, at least with
respect to the beach between
Pomponio and Pescadero. The
amount of skinny-dipping there
has increased tremendously in the
last few years, and the park police
have apparently decided that it
was too much of a good thing.
The beach is now being

patrolled at least sporadically by
jeep (especially at low tide), and
warning citations are being issued
for nudity. I am told the second
such citation entails a court
appearance and fine.
Since private beaches have
admission/parking fees, it would
be nice to see the less crowded
sections of state beach remain
liberated, but people should be
aware of the potential hassles.
