# Congress Reasserts Itself

WASHINGTON - Although
the impeachment process has
captured headlines, the 93rd
Congress has also quietly
reasserted its potency vis a vis the
President in another way: by
enacting an extensive budget
reform. Many congressmen — with
uncharacteristic lack of hyperbole
— contend that the passage of the
Congressional Budget and
Impoundment Control Act of
1974 marked the start of a new
era of congressional responsibility.
After more than 40 years of
gradually allowing its powers to
pass to the Executive Branch of
government, congressmen here
seem to sense a renewed pride in
their political roles and are willing
to challenge antiquated traditions
in order to regain their
independence and initiative.
Nixon's fund impoundments, the
arrogance of Administration
officials, and the Watergate
revelations were no doubt major
stimuli to this new mood.
Under the provisions of the
budget control act, annual budget
proposals will be reviewed as a
whole by new House and Senate
committees. The committees will
recommend overall spending
levels, revenues and public debt
and the amount of budget surplus
or deficit which appears
appropriate. Congress will be
required to adopt these tentative
targets by May 15, before
studying individual appropriations
bills. In September, after the
passage of all money bills,
Congress will review its budgetary
goals and make adjustments
reflecting economic changes since
spring.
A spending ceiling is to be
imposed at the start of each
legislative session. Congress would
be forced to adhere to the ceiling
unless a vote were taken to spend
more than the ceiling or permit
the Government to operate at a
deficit.

According to one leading
congressman, "the genius behind
the budget reform consists of the
fact that Congress will be forced
to make the rational budgetary
decisions which it presently
ignores. "Currently, Congress
develops its budget with no regard
for overall spending priorities."
Another major provision of the
act is its strict control of
Presidential impoundments.
Under the act, Congress would
have the final say about whether
appropriated funds could be
withheld. Either house or congress
could veto an executive decision
to defer spending for a particular
program, while the programs
could be terminated only with the
consent of both the House and
the Senate.
The Act, despite its remarkable
innovations, seems to have pleased
almost all segments of
congressional opinion. In the
House for example, it was passed
by a margin of 401 to 6. Although
some conservatives were at first
wary about the impoundment
provisions, they reasoned that the
elimination of wasteful spending
produced by the act should make
Presidential impoundments
unnecessary.
Although many congressmen
have claimed that tighter control
over the budget will enable
Congress to reduce spending and
thus curb inflation, most
observers emphasize that the
overall impact of the reform on
the economy should not be
overstated.
The major effect of the act will

probably be of a political nature.
In addition to giving Congress a
tighter rein over the planning of
the budget and control over
executive impoundments, the act
also appropriates funds for a new
congressional budget office. Since
one of the major complaints of
members is that they lack the
research facilities and expertise
necessary to make judgments
regarding legislation, the act
represents another way in which
Congress is rebelling at having to
be at the mercy of experts in the
executive branch.
Some congressmen fear that
the new provisions are too
rational to be workable in the
highly pluralistic House and
Senate, where provincial interests
often cripple carefully developed
and impartial economic programs.
But since the various special
interests will be considered in the
initial planning of the budget,
perhaps the dangers to the
viability of the act can indeed be
minimized.
Some members of Congress
have expressed a deeper
skepticism. For example, one
Republican Congressman from the
Midwest predicted that members
of both Houses will "very quickly
find ways to thwart the rules."
It is probably true that the
provisions of the act will be
circumvented to a considerable
degree. Nevertheless, the act is a
highly significant milestone in the
restoration of congressional
power.

WASHINGTON - Although
the impeachment process has
captured headlines, the 93rd
Congress has also quietly
reasserted its potency vis a vis the
President in another way: by
enacting an extensive budget
reform. Many congressmen — with
uncharacteristic lack of hyperbole
— contend that the passage of the
Congressional Budget and
Impoundment Control Act of
1974 marked the start of a new
era of congressional responsibility.
After more than 40 years of
gradually allowing its powers to
pass to the Executive Branch of
government, congressmen here
seem to sense a renewed pride in
their political roles and are willing
to challenge antiquated traditions
in order to regain their
independence and initiative.
Nixon's fund impoundments, the
arrogance of Administration
officials, and the Watergate
revelations were no doubt major
stimuli to this new mood.
Under the provisions of the
budget control act, annual budget
proposals will be reviewed as a
whole by new House and Senate
committees. The committees will
recommend overall spending
levels, revenues and public debt
and the amount of budget surplus
or deficit which appears
appropriate. Congress will be
required to adopt these tentative
targets by May 15, before
studying individual appropriations
bills. In September, after the
passage of all money bills,
Congress will review its budgetary
goals and make adjustments
reflecting economic changes since
spring.
A spending ceiling is to be
imposed at the start of each
legislative session. Congress would
be forced to adhere to the ceiling
unless a vote were taken to spend
more than the ceiling or permit
the Government to operate at a
deficit.

According to one leading
congressman, "the genius behind
the budget reform consists of the
fact that Congress will be forced
to make the rational budgetary
decisions which it presently
ignores. "Currently, Congress
develops its budget with no regard
for overall spending priorities."
Another major provision of the
act is its strict control of
Presidential impoundments.
Under the act, Congress would
have the final say about whether
appropriated funds could be
withheld. Either house or congress
could veto an executive decision
to defer spending for a particular
program, while the programs
could be terminated only with the
consent of both the House and
the Senate.
The Act, despite its remarkable
innovations, seems to have pleased
almost all segments of
congressional opinion. In the
House for example, it was passed
by a margin of 401 to 6. Although
some conservatives were at first
wary about the impoundment
provisions, they reasoned that the
elimination of wasteful spending
produced by the act should make
Presidential impoundments
unnecessary.
Although many congressmen
have claimed that tighter control
over the budget will enable
Congress to reduce spending and
thus curb inflation, most
observers emphasize that the
overall impact of the reform on
