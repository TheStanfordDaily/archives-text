# Recreation Center Proposed
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
A new recreation center on
Lake Lagunita will replace the
Stanford Boathouse, condemned
in 1969, if the University
approves a recent ASSU Council
of Presidents' proposal.
The center, costing nearly
$100,000, will be financed with
ASSU funds including student fee
assessments, ASSU Vice President
Quinn Mayer said.
The proposal states that
construction of the center hinges
upon the conversion of Lake
Lagunita to a year-round facility
and the construction of housing
facilities on the lake.
Should the proposal pass, the
University would fund the lake's
conversion. Converting the lake
would cost $286,000 using a
method suggested in 1966, Mayer
said.
Cost Less?
However, a member of the
Stanford Sailing Association
Board of Directors has suggested a
more modern method which
would cost the University
"considerably less," Mayer stated.
How much less has not been
determined, he added, though his
"seat of the pants" estimate is
$150,000.
Dean of Student Affairs James
W. Lyons stated that passage of
the ASSU proposal is not
contingent upon a permanent
lake. "I think you can separate
the boathouse and the year-round
lake," he said.
Construction of a new
boathouse contained a "sense of
urgency" for safety sake he said,
but making a permanent lake was
not "imperative." He said he
considered building a new library
and more housing facilities more

important than constructing a
year-round lake.
He added that once the
boathouse was completed and
housing facilities on the west side
of the lake were built the
possibility of a permanent lake
would be much more likely.
University Favorable
Edward E. Shaw, executive
assistant vice president and
provost, said the general attitude
of the University towards the
proposal is favorable especially if
construction of a permanent lake
costs less than $200,000 with an
annual upkeep under $10,000.
The University will make a
decision of the feasibility of the

center construction proposal and
the permanent lake proposal by
Sept. 1.
But ASSU Financial Manager
Frank Olivieri fears the center
project will be vetoed unless the
University makes the lake
permanent.
"If they give us a red light on
the permanent lake, we could just
about kiss this project good-bye,"
he said.
ASSU Vice President Ann
Carter said the program proposal
as it stands is quite shaky. The
University is investigating the
figures reported in the ASSU
proposal and considering the
