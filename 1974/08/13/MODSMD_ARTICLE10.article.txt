Unthinking Chorus
Editor:
I was sorry to see the Daily
join the unthinking chorus of
those who deplore Nixon's
domestic crimes but praise him
extravagantly for his foreign
policy (Editorial, August 9).
Notably absent from this chorus
are millions of citizens of
Vietnam, South Korea, Brazil,
Chile, Uruguay and, until
recently, Greece.
Many of them have been
imprisoned and tortured with the
help of American know-how, and
all are victims of Nixon's
encouragement and support for
right-wing dictatorships around
the world — currently to the tune
of $5 billion a year in foreign aid.
His Administration continued
stubbornly to support the two
totally discredited generals, Thieu
and Lon Nol, so that war
continues to rage in Vietnam and
Cambodia. We tend to forget that
before signing a "peace
agreement" he had no intention
of observing, Nixon dropped more
than four million tons of bombs
on the people of Indochina and
sent 20,000 Americans to their
deaths.
Reaching detente with the
Russians and Chinese is
praiseworthy, but detente is
largely meaningless when it is
accompanied by the largest
military budget in history. Thanks
partly to this huge expenditure on
the military, the United States is
in the grip of severe inflation.

Lopez' Errors
Editor:
Your article of last Friday
dealing with the reactions of
Representative McCloskey and
some Stanford-in-Washington
interns to Nixon's resignation
contained several errors which I
feel are worth correcting.
First, Mike Lopez is not the
head of the Stanford-in-

Washington Program. Lee Ann
Huntington was the head of that
organization for the 1973-1974
school year, and Dave Treaner will
be the leader during the coming
year.
More importantly, Mr. Lopez is
wrong in believing that no
Stanford intem has served either
Mr. Nixon or Mr. Ford. I know of
at least five interns who served
in the White House during Mr.
Nixon's tenure. Many Stanford
students have had the close
connection with California
Republican politics necessary to
be chosen for such internships.
While I do not know whether
any Stanford students have served
with Mr. Ford, I doubt whether
Mr. Lopez knows either.

Clearing House
Editor:
This year, more than ever,
Stanford students face a severe
housing shortage both on and off
campus. I am a Stanford student
who is desperately trying to find
housing, fall quarter, for close to
1500 new and returning Stanford
students. I am employed by the
Dean of Student Affairs' Office
coordinating with the Rental
Housing Office, as Student
Coordinator of the Clearing
House. The Clearing House is set
up from September 7 through
September 24 to help these
students find housing.
You can be of tremendous help
to these new and returning
students if you have a room or
know r 112 a room, apartment, or
house for rent or to share on a
permanent or temporary basis, or,
if you can offer room and/or
board in exchange for work.
If you can help, please call me:
Lise Pfeiffer, Student Coordinator
of the Clearing House, Rental
Housing Stanford University,
497-3908, 497-3906, 497-1400,
Monday through Friday 9-5 from

Unthinking Chorus
Editor:
I was sorry to see the Daily
join the unthinking chorus of
those who deplore Nixon's
domestic crimes but praise him
extravagantly for his foreign
policy (Editorial, August 9).
Notably absent from this chorus
are millions of citizens of
Vietnam, South Korea, Brazil,
Chile, Uruguay and, until
recently, Greece.
Many of them have been
imprisoned and tortured with the
help of American know-how, and
all are victims of Nixon's
encouragement and support for
right-wing dictatorships around
the world — currently to the tune
of $5 billion a year in foreign aid.
His Administration continued
stubbornly to support the two
totally discredited generals, Thieu
and Lon Nol, so that war
continues to rage in Vietnam and
Cambodia. We tend to forget that
before signing a "peace
agreement" he had no intention
of observing, Nixon dropped more
than four million tons of bombs
on the people of Indochina and
sent 20,000 Americans to their
deaths.
Reaching detente with the
Russians and Chinese is
praiseworthy, but detente is
largely meaningless when it is
accompanied by the largest
military budget in history. Thanks
partly to this huge expenditure on
the military, the United States is
in the grip of severe inflation.

Lopez' Errors
Editor:
Your article of last Friday
dealing with the reactions of
Representative McCloskey and
some Stanford-in-Washington
interns to Nixon's resignation
contained several errors which I
feel are worth correcting.
First, Mike Lopez is not the
head of the Stanford-in-

Washington Program. Lee Ann
Huntington was the head of that
organization for the 1973-1974
school year, and Dave Treaner will
be the leader during the coming
year.
More importantly, Mr. Lopez is
wrong in believing that no
Stanford intem has served either
Mr. Nixon or Mr. Ford. I know of
at least five interns who served
in the White House during Mr.
Nixon's tenure. Many Stanford
students have had the close
connection with California
Republican politics necessary to
be chosen for such internships.
While I do not know whether
any Stanford students have served
with Mr. Ford, I doubt whether
Mr. Lopez knows either.

Clearing House
Editor:
This year, more than ever,
Stanford students face a severe
housing shortage both on and off
campus. I am a Stanford student
who is desperately trying to find
housing, fall quarter, for close to
1500 new and returning Stanford
students. I am employed by the
Dean of Student Affairs' Office
coordinating with the Rental
Housing Office, as Student
Coordinator of the Clearing
House. The Clearing House is set
up from September 7 through
September 24 to help these
students find housing.
You can be of tremendous help
to these new and returning
students if you have a room or
know r 112 a room, apartment, or
house for rent or to share on a
permanent or temporary basis, or,
if you can offer room and/or
board in exchange for work.
