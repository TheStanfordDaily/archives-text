# Bring Back The Photo ID's
## 
### 
Tim Peterson

A good number of us, now Stanford
students, were once involved in high school
student government or politics. As a matter
of fact, such activity may well have been the
determining factor in a few of our cases as we
were considered for admission by those
mysterious people in the undergraduate
admissions office.
When I was doing that stuff in high
school, it was probably more of an ego trip
than anything else. We really couldn't do a
helluva lot and we knew it. However one
significant thing we did do at my alma mater
was to get student identification cards with
pictures on them.
It was very likely the most important
thing our Student Council ever did. People
under 16, and thus without drivers licenses,
have a hard time proving their age and
identity unless they carry around their birth
certificates. Sometimes this can be important
for getting student fares on buses, at sporting
events or for getting into certain movies.
Everyone agreed it was an idea whose time
had come. The school agreed to foot the bill
in the interests of its tuition paying students.
(This was a parochial school.)
Cost Too High?
One would think that a place with as

many students as Stanford might see things
likewise. But alas! It was announced last
spring that the Uniersity would no longer
provide photo ID's come fall. The reason: it
costs too much, an estimated $12,000 per
year.
I admire the University for trying to cut
costs with inflation and the rotten state of
the Nixon economy. So now tuition no
longer covers telephone or linen service. Maid
service is not as extensive as it was four or
five years ago in the dorms.
All this was to keep tuition costs down
and that is fine with me. I understand the
University is caught in a financial bind. BUT,
I can see no justification for this $12,000
budget cut.
They say, "Don't worry, the food service
will issue their customers photo ID's." Well I
say what about the people living in co-ops,
fraternities, special sign-up houses, off
campus, etc?
What happens when they try to cash a
check off campus or buy liquor and have to
prove who they are? What if these people are
from Nevada, Illinois, Wisconsin or many
other states outside California which do not
have pictures on their drivers licenses? What
suspicious bartender will serve these people

when he's not sure and the ABC men are in
town?
Good Luck!
I say "Good luck!" to all these people,
especially women from such states. They
don't have draft cards and maybe no Social
Security cards, often no identification other
than a Stanford ID and a drivers license.
The University saved a lot of money in
their cuts in maid, linen and phone service.
But what's a measly $12,000 spread over
thousands of people, serving in the interest of
so many of them? What is the University
doing with the $150-plus million pledged
thus far in its fund rasing drive? Will there be
more multi-million dollar erections?
Tuition has risen nearly $800 since I was a
freshman and I don't think we are getting a
fair shake on this ID issue. Why doesn't Dick
Lyman or Jim Lyons or someone in the
administration get off his ass and say,
"Maybe we made a mistake, maybe we can
cut back elsewhere?"
You won't see anyone marching in White
Plaza this fall for the sake of photo ID's.
Still, I am convinced that if some positive
action is taken, it will save a lot of people a
lot of hassles.

thus far in its fund rasing drive? Will there be
more multi-million dollar erections?
Tuition has risen nearly $800 since I was a
freshman and I don't think we are getting a
fair shake on this ID issue. Why doesn't Dick
Lyman or Jim Lyons or someone in the
administration get off his ass and say,
"Maybe we made a mistake, maybe we can
cut back elsewhere?"
You won't see anyone marching in White
Plaza this fall for the sake of photo ID's.
Still, I am convinced that if some positive
action is taken, it will save a lot of people a
lot of hassles.

A good number of us, now Stanford
students, were once involved in high school
student government or politics. As a matter
of fact, such activity may well have been the
determining factor in a few of our cases as we
were considered for admission by those
mysterious people in the undergraduate
admissions office.
When I was doing that stuff in high
school, it was probably more of an ego trip
than anything else. We really couldn't do a
helluva lot and we knew it. However one
significant thing we did do at my alma mater
was to get student identification cards with
pictures on them.
It was very likely the most important
thing our Student Council ever did. People
under 16, and thus without drivers licenses,
have a hard time proving their age and
identity unless they carry around their birth
certificates. Sometimes this can be important
for getting student fares on buses, at sporting
events or for getting into certain movies.
Everyone agreed it was an idea whose time
had come. The school agreed to foot the bill
in the interests of its tuition paying students.
(This was a parochial school.)
Cost Too High?
One would think that a place with as

many students as Stanford might see things
likewise. But alas! It was announced last
spring that the Uniersity would no longer
provide photo ID's come fall. The reason: it
costs too much, an estimated $12,000 per
year.
I admire the University for trying to cut
costs with inflation and the rotten state of
the Nixon economy. So now tuition no
longer covers telephone or linen service. Maid
service is not as extensive as it was four or
five years ago in the dorms.
All this was to keep tuition costs down
and that is fine with me. I understand the
University is caught in a financial bind. BUT,
I can see no justification for this $12,000
budget cut.
They say, "Don't worry, the food service
will issue their customers photo ID's." Well I
say what about the people living in co-ops,
fraternities, special sign-up houses, off
campus, etc?
What happens when they try to cash a
check off campus or buy liquor and have to
prove who they are? What if these people are
from Nevada, Illinois, Wisconsin or many
other states outside California which do not
have pictures on their drivers licenses? What
suspicious bartender will serve these people

when he's not sure and the ABC men are in
town?
Good Luck!
I say "Good luck!" to all these people,
especially women from such states. They
don't have draft cards and maybe no Social
Security cards, often no identification other
than a Stanford ID and a drivers license.
The University saved a lot of money in
their cuts in maid, linen and phone service.
But what's a measly $12,000 spread over
thousands of people, serving in the interest of
so many of them? What is the University
doing with the $150-plus million pledged
thus far in its fund rasing drive? Will there be
more multi-million dollar erections?
