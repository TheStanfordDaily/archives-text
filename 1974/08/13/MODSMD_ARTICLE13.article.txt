# Two Systems Of Justice

Like a gardener in one of
Shakespeare's plays, peeking
around the curtain or gazing
through the trees, I watched last
week as the powerful and the
great read through their fateful
lines. Flanked by sentinels and
lieutenents, surrounded by his
polished women, Richard Nixon
met his end through a tragic flaw.
This rare glimpse into the more
vulnerable side of the mighty
came to me as I sat on the floor of
my uncarpeted welfare apartment.
And the verdict from the bottom
is that last week's changing of the
guard was brought on not by
erring politicians but by
overly-idealistic lawyers who set
out atop white steeds to prove the
most untenable of all American
myths — that each man and
woman is equal under the law.
Keeping one eye on the stove
and stirring the noontime
oatmeal, I watched as our new
national hero declared that "Ours
is a government of laws, not
men."
I invite Mr. Ford to return with
me to the Denver ghetto, where I
learned that the only law is he
who steals the most will lose the

least, and where the police will
not protect a white woman's right
to physical safety in a black
community — the reverse has
always been true.
Suffered Enough
Sometime between Cronkite's
opening remarks and Reasoner's
closing commentary, the face of
Senator Scott filled my screen and
he decreed that Nixon should
not face criminal prosecution
because "He has already suffered
enough."
After all, the argument went,
he has stolen no money and
committed no violent crime.
Anyone stealing a can of hair
spray will land in jail. But
unlawful surveillance, the
jockeying of thousands of illegal
dollars, and the secret bombing of
a foreign country are all part of
the game.
Dishing up the oatmeal into
second hand bowls, my mind
wandered to John Ehrlichman.
Like many others, he wasn't
prepared for the new slant on law
and order.
A welfare mother who gets
caught chiseling an extra sixty

bucks a month deserves to lose
her apartment and her children.
But when a presidential aide is
convicted of conspiracy, it's a
"miscarriage of justice."
Thin Line
Great sages, from Shakespeare
to Paul Simon, would teach us
that life is basically the same for
the prince as for the pawn, "For
the line is thinly drawn 'tween joy
and sorrow." But we have never
believed it, and as a result, nourish
two systems of justice.
One system serves the elevated,
those who live on a higher plane
and are capable of great thoughts,
feelings and accomplishments. A
president, for instance. For
Richard Nixon, the public
humiliation and loss of position
are enough.
But for the more common
criminal, the humiliation and loss
of job are only the beginning. He
must also languish long years in
jail. It is argued that the dull
nature of the lower classes
necessitates a blunt instrument,
more blatant controls. A poor
man simply couldn't be duly
affected by Mr. Nixon's
punishment.
I could attempt to bridge the
gap between the ex-president's
system of justice and my own by
agreeing that in the end, we suffer
the same joy and sorrow. One
commentator has described Nixon
as a man who won an
overwhelming victory two years
ago but left office with tears in his
eyes and wondering how he would
pay his taxes.
Same Anguish?
The naive follower of the
American myth could surmise
that in his financial quandry, he
suffers the same anguish I know
when wondering under which
rock next month's rent money is
hiding.
And it could be argued that in
his tears over losing his position,
he shares the sorrow I felt last
week when crying over the job I
interviewed for but didn't get.
But I don't believe it. This past
week in Washington has failed to
convince me that there is equality
and justice in the land, or that
Nixon and I dwell under the same
social and economic system.
Richard Nixon broke the law but
will never go to jail. There is a
universe that separates us through
our common tears.
