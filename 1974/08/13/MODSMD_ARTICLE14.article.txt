# Hatfield: 'Hoover Believed In The People'
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
"President [Herbert] Hoover's
faith in the individual was
complete. He believed that the
destiny of America rested with
the imagination, cooperation and
vision of its people," Sen. Mark O.
Hatfield, R—Ore., said Saturday,
speaking at the centennial
celebration of Hoover's birth.
He "believed in the people, in
their capacity to respond," in
troubled times, Hatfield said of
America's 31st President. "The
dignity of man was being usurped
by the power of the institution
and in this development Hoover
foresaw danger."
Hatfield was the keynote
speaker to more than 750 people
who attended the event,

sponsored by the Hoover
Institution of War, Revolution
and Peace.
Hatfield, who wrote his
master's thesis here on Hoover's
labor policies, emphasized the
former President's "commitment
to decentralized power."
Political Estrangement
"The political estrangement of
the people grows in proportion to
the power of the federal
government," Hatfield said.
"Centralized executive power is so
abused that our nation is brought
to a historical crises," he added.
"It is clear that we inherited in
large part a political climate which
Hoover prudently predicted and
rightfully feared," Hatfieid stated.
Hoover "fretted over the rise

of massive federal bureaucracies
that cut short the responsiveness
of democracy to its citizens," the
senator remarked.
Hatfield said that though
Hoover "warned against the rise
of a massive federal bureaucracy,
federal expenditure has increased
90 times over while the gross
national product has increased
only 14 times."
Confidence Waned
"Since that time ... the power
and scope of the federal
government has expanded with
unprecedented speed. Yet as
Hoover feared, people's
confidence in government has
waned at nearly an equal rate,"
Hatfield claimed.
Hatfield described Hoover as
"a man who felt both great
compassion and great failure. He
refused the temptation of
sacrificing principle on the altar of
political expedience."
Hatfield said he believes the
"greatest threat to stability, and
world peace today" is famine in
underdeveloped countries. He
praised Hoover's work in famine
relief that saved the lives of
millions of people during and
after World War I. That work
included founding the Food
Research Institute here.
Famine
"Today again the world faces
famine. At least 60 percent of the
people living in the poor
developing world suffer
malnutrition.... In the Sahel one
million have already died and five
to ten million more are starving in
the bush country, afflicted by

drought," Hatfield reported.
Hoover "fed 10 million people
and in so doing came into direct
conflict with the admirals and
generals in connection with the
policy of blockading the occupied
countries," he added.
"Hoover demonstrated in the
past how the generosity of the
American people can be inspired
to alieviate the hunger of
mankind," Hatfield said.
"Today it is such an
outpouring of American spirit
which must again come to relieve
the most basic needs of mankind
and build the foundation of true
justice and peace," Hatfield
emphasized.
Jack Parker, chairman of the
Board of Overseers of the Hoover
Institution read a telegram from
President Gerald Ford which
praised Hoover for his service to

the country.
Ford had been scheduled to
appear Saturday evening in his
capacity as Vice President, but
had to remain in Washington
when he became President.
University President Richard
W. Lyman, who is honorary
curator of the British collection at
the Hoover Institution, also spoke
Saturday. He cited anecdotes
from Hoover's college days and
contributions Hoover made to the
University during his half century
as a trustee.
Initial Class
Hoover was a freshman
member of the University's initial
class in 1891, graduating with a
bachelor's degree in geology in
1895. He was appointed to the
Board of Trustees in 1912,
retiring in 1961, but serving as a
trustee emeritus until his death in
1964.
Lyman noted that "three of
Stanford's most important
present-day academic activities are
the result directly of Mr.
Hoover's efforts." These are the
Hoover Institution, the Food
Research Institute and the
Graduate School of Business.
W. Glenn Campbell, director of
Hoover Institution, also addressed
the crowd. He spoke of the
Institution, describing it as "a
thriving center for
documentation, research, and
publication with a budget of $3
million, 50 full-time scholars
working here, and 200
non-resident scholars working on
projects supported by Hoover
grants."

Institution read a telegram from
President Gerald Ford which
praised Hoover for his service to

the country.
Ford had been scheduled to
appear Saturday evening in his
capacity as Vice President, but
had to remain in Washington
when he became President.
University President Richard
W. Lyman, who is honorary
curator of the British collection at
the Hoover Institution, also spoke
Saturday. He cited anecdotes
from Hoover's college days and
contributions Hoover made to the
University during his half century
as a trustee.
Initial Class
Hoover was a freshman
member of the University's initial
class in 1891, graduating with a
bachelor's degree in geology in
1895. He was appointed to the
Board of Trustees in 1912,
retiring in 1961, but serving as a
trustee emeritus until his death in
1964.
Lyman noted that "three of
Stanford's most important
present-day academic activities are
the result directly of Mr.
Hoover's efforts." These are the
Hoover Institution, the Food
Research Institute and the
Graduate School of Business.
W. Glenn Campbell, director of
Hoover Institution, also addressed
the crowd. He spoke of the
Institution, describing it as "a
thriving center for
documentation, research, and
publication with a budget of $3
million, 50 full-time scholars
working here, and 200
non-resident scholars working on
projects supported by Hoover
grants."

"President [Herbert] Hoover's
faith in the individual was
complete. He believed that the
destiny of America rested with
the imagination, cooperation and
vision of its people," Sen. Mark O.
Hatfield, R—Ore., said Saturday,
speaking at the centennial
celebration of Hoover's birth.
He "believed in the people, in
their capacity to respond," in
troubled times, Hatfield said of
America's 31st President. "The
dignity of man was being usurped
by the power of the institution
and in this development Hoover
foresaw danger."
Hatfield was the keynote
speaker to more than 750 people
who attended the event,

sponsored by the Hoover
Institution of War, Revolution
and Peace.
Hatfield, who wrote his
master's thesis here on Hoover's
labor policies, emphasized the
former President's "commitment
to decentralized power."
Political Estrangement
"The political estrangement of
the people grows in proportion to
the power of the federal
government," Hatfield said.
"Centralized executive power is so
abused that our nation is brought
to a historical crises," he added.
"It is clear that we inherited in
large part a political climate which
Hoover prudently predicted and
rightfully feared," Hatfieid stated.
Hoover "fretted over the rise

of massive federal bureaucracies
that cut short the responsiveness
of democracy to its citizens," the
senator remarked.
Hatfield said that though
Hoover "warned against the rise
of a massive federal bureaucracy,
federal expenditure has increased
90 times over while the gross
national product has increased
only 14 times."
Confidence Waned
"Since that time ... the power
and scope of the federal
government has expanded with
unprecedented speed. Yet as
Hoover feared, people's
confidence in government has
waned at nearly an equal rate,"
Hatfield claimed.
Hatfield described Hoover as
"a man who felt both great
compassion and great failure. He
refused the temptation of
sacrificing principle on the altar of
political expedience."
Hatfield said he believes the
"greatest threat to stability, and
world peace today" is famine in
underdeveloped countries. He
praised Hoover's work in famine
relief that saved the lives of
millions of people during and
after World War I. That work
included founding the Food
Research Institute here.
Famine
"Today again the world faces
famine. At least 60 percent of the
people living in the poor
developing world suffer
malnutrition.... In the Sahel one
million have already died and five
to ten million more are starving in
the bush country, afflicted by

drought," Hatfield reported.
Hoover "fed 10 million people
and in so doing came into direct
conflict with the admirals and
generals in connection with the
policy of blockading the occupied
countries," he added.
"Hoover demonstrated in the
past how the generosity of the
American people can be inspired
to alieviate the hunger of
mankind," Hatfield said.
"Today it is such an
outpouring of American spirit
which must again come to relieve
the most basic needs of mankind
and build the foundation of true
justice and peace," Hatfield
emphasized.

unprecedented speed. Yet as
Hoover feared, people's
confidence in government has
waned at nearly an equal rate,"
Hatfield claimed.
Hatfield described Hoover as
"a man who felt both great
compassion and great failure. He
refused the temptation of
sacrificing principle on the altar of
political expedience."
Hatfield said he believes the
"greatest threat to stability, and
world peace today" is famine in
underdeveloped countries. He
praised Hoover's work in famine
relief that saved the lives of
millions of people during and
after World War I. That work
included founding the Food
Research Institute here.
Famine
"Today again the world faces
famine. At least 60 percent of the
people living in the poor
developing world suffer
malnutrition.... In the Sahel one
million have already died and five
to ten million more are starving in
the bush country, afflicted by

drought," Hatfield reported.
Hoover "fed 10 million people
and in so doing came into direct
conflict with the admirals and
generals in connection with the
policy of blockading the occupied
countries," he added.
"Hoover demonstrated in the
past how the generosity of the
American people can be inspired
to alieviate the hunger of
mankind," Hatfield said.
"Today it is such an
outpouring of American spirit
which must again come to relieve
the most basic needs of mankind
and build the foundation of true
justice and peace," Hatfield
emphasized.
Jack Parker, chairman of the
Board of Overseers of the Hoover
Institution read a telegram from
President Gerald Ford which
praised Hoover for his service to

the country.
Ford had been scheduled to
appear Saturday evening in his
capacity as Vice President, but
had to remain in Washington
when he became President.
University President Richard
W. Lyman, who is honorary
curator of the British collection at
the Hoover Institution, also spoke
Saturday. He cited anecdotes
from Hoover's college days and
contributions Hoover made to the
University during his half century
as a trustee.
Initial Class
Hoover was a freshman
member of the University's initial
class in 1891, graduating with a
bachelor's degree in geology in
1895. He was appointed to the
Board of Trustees in 1912,
retiring in 1961, but serving as a
trustee emeritus until his death in
1964.
Lyman noted that "three of
Stanford's most important
present-day academic activities are
the result directly of Mr.
Hoover's efforts." These are the
Hoover Institution, the Food
Research Institute and the
Graduate School of Business.
W. Glenn Campbell, director of
Hoover Institution, also addressed
the crowd. He spoke of the
Institution, describing it as "a
thriving center for
documentation, research, and
publication with a budget of $3
million, 50 full-time scholars
working here, and 200
non-resident scholars working on
projects supported by Hoover
grants."
