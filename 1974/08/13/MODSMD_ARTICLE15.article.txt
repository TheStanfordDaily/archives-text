# Researcher Urges 'Abolish Prisons'

### CAROL MOLDAW 
"I urge you to consider
abolishing prisons" psychology
graduate student Craig Haney
said last Thursday at Tresidder
discussing "The Psychology of
Prisons."
Haney, a co-sponsor of the
1971 Stanford Prison Experiment,
called prisons "an unqualified
failure ... whose very existence
dehumanizes us all."
Using the prison system's own
statistics, Haney demonstrated
that prisons do not work as
rehabilitation centers or as
deterrents to crime.
Prisons cannot rehabilitate
because they are dehumanizing
and because they do not reflect
the society which the ex-convict
will have to re-enter, he said.
Unsure Punishment
They fail as a deterrent to
crime because they are not a sure
punishment, he added.
Governmental statistics report that
only two percent of the people
who commit felons are ever
imprisoned, Haney said.
A lot of crimes, especially the
majority of murders, are not
premeditated and therefore the
question of prison as a
consequence to crime is often
never considered, he explained.
The purpose of the Stanford
prison experiment, which Haney
termed "a morality play ... an
evil situation with good moral
people," was to determine if it is
"the institution itself, or the
nature of the people who work
and are confined in prisons which
insures its failure.
In a real prison the two cannot
be separated, Haney said, but in
the experiment the participants,
both wardens and prisoners, had
"none of the characteristics
associated with real prisoners or
wardens."
Coin Flip
They were not anti-social, not
hostile, and hadn't committed
crimes." The role of prisoner and
warden were assigned by "the flip
of a coin," he said.
The experiment put the
institution itself to test, Haney
said, because except for the
nature of the people, it simulated
a real prison.
Haney said "the experiment
itself was irrational ... there was
no reason for punishment, no
reason to give or accept it," yet
soon the experiment became more

than a quasi-prison and the
participants became
psychologically burdened by their
roles.
He cited one "prisoner" who
was so overwhelmed by the
experience that he agreed to
return the money he had earned
in exchange for early freedom.
After the agreement the
student was asked to return to his
cell until he was released. The
student though free from all
obligations returned "docilely" to
his cell, Haney said.
'Transformation'
"His sense of reality had
undergone a transformation"
Haney said and it was then that he
realized it was no longer just an
experiment.
Originally planned for two
weeks, the experiment was
discontinued after six days.
Haney said, "We have a
tendency to explain what people
do in terms of what kind of
people they are" but the study
"confronts that bias directly," he
added.
He said "we grant institutions
the presumption of rationality"
and instead we should "call
institutions to test for what they
do."
When asked what alternative
there is for prisons, Haney
responded that "there is no
alternative ... reserving one group
with power over another group is
not wise."

psychologically burdened by their
roles.
He cited one "prisoner" who
was so overwhelmed by the
experience that he agreed to
return the money he had earned
in exchange for early freedom.
After the agreement the
student was asked to return to his
cell until he was released. The
student though free from all
obligations returned "docilely" to
his cell, Haney said.
'Transformation'
"His sense of reality had
undergone a transformation"
Haney said and it was then that he
realized it was no longer just an
experiment.
Originally planned for two
weeks, the experiment was
discontinued after six days.
Haney said, "We have a
tendency to explain what people
do in terms of what kind of
people they are" but the study
"confronts that bias directly," he
added.
He said "we grant institutions
the presumption of rationality"
and instead we should "call
institutions to test for what they
do."
When asked what alternative
there is for prisons, Haney
responded that "there is no
alternative ... reserving one group
with power over another group is
not wise."

"I urge you to consider
abolishing prisons" psychology
graduate student Craig Haney
said last Thursday at Tresidder
discussing "The Psychology of
Prisons."
Haney, a co-sponsor of the
1971 Stanford Prison Experiment,
called prisons "an unqualified
failure ... whose very existence
dehumanizes us all."
Using the prison system's own
statistics, Haney demonstrated
that prisons do not work as
rehabilitation centers or as
deterrents to crime.
Prisons cannot rehabilitate
because they are dehumanizing
and because they do not reflect
the society which the ex-convict
will have to re-enter, he said.
Unsure Punishment
They fail as a deterrent to
crime because they are not a sure
punishment, he added.
Governmental statistics report that
only two percent of the people
who commit felons are ever
imprisoned, Haney said.
A lot of crimes, especially the
majority of murders, are not
premeditated and therefore the
question of prison as a
consequence to crime is often
never considered, he explained.
The purpose of the Stanford
prison experiment, which Haney
termed "a morality play ... an
evil situation with good moral
people," was to determine if it is
"the institution itself, or the
nature of the people who work
and are confined in prisons which
insures its failure.
In a real prison the two cannot
be separated, Haney said, but in
the experiment the participants,
both wardens and prisoners, had
"none of the characteristics
associated with real prisoners or
wardens."
Coin Flip
They were not anti-social, not
hostile, and hadn't committed
crimes." The role of prisoner and
warden were assigned by "the flip
of a coin," he said.
The experiment put the
institution itself to test, Haney
said, because except for the
nature of the people, it simulated
a real prison.
Haney said "the experiment
itself was irrational ... there was
no reason for punishment, no
reason to give or accept it," yet
soon the experiment became more

than a quasi-prison and the
participants became
psychologically burdened by their
roles.

experience that he agreed to
