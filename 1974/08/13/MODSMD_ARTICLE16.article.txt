# Bettelheim Stresses Freedom In Life
## 
### LAURIE TREUHAFT 
"I've learned a lot about
freedom as I've grown older. If we
want freedom in all aspects of our
life, we have really very little
freedom. We must define our life
activities narrowly to experience
true freedom from those areas
most important to us."
Bruno Bettelheim, visiting
graduate professor in Education
and Psychiatry, had removed his
glasses and was staring into space
as he spoke about "freedom" in
his close little office on the third
floor of Cubberley.
"Freedom comes from the self,
though the environment can help
or interfere," he said. "One of the
advantages of education is that it
gives you a chance to select an
environment for your activities;
you are less forced to accept

whatever society dishes out.
"Sometimes because of
economic and social conditions,
there is no choice in this matter.
But what bothers me is that I see
people who do have choices not
exercising them. They feel they
have to box themselves in for the
sake of earning a higher salary,
where a slight reduction in income
would give them considerably
greater freedom."
'Freeing Children*
Bettelheim is internationally
known for his dedication to
"freeing" emotionally disturbed
children during his 29 years as
director of the University of
Chicago's Sonia Shankman
Orthogenic School. About 85
percent of the patients leave the
school ready for "full
participation in life."
He retired from that post last
year and is now living in Portola
Valley. Besides teaching here,
Bettelheim has remained affiliated
with the University of Chicago
and will return there this spring.
Bettelheim has a deep

intellectual commitment to
preserving the inner self in today's
confusing world. This process of
self-awareness must begin at an
early age and should be
encouraged in the educational
system, he writes, because the
child is father to the man.
The Watergate scandal might
have been a result of raising our
children to a value-free
educational system, Bettelheim
told a social studies teachers'
conference here last month.
Elaborating later, he said, "In the
past, education transmitted very
definite values — and very
consciously.
Value-Free
"Then came the idea that we
have no right to impose specific
values. We became value-free
when we became a pluralistic
society. But we can't live without
values. Not dealing with the issue
of values prevents the child
through his educational
experience to define his own
values.
"Education shouldn't impose
values. But it should stress the
importance of the value of a good
life. That's different from
imposing.. ..
"Life is inexhaustible if you
really try to understand it,"he
tells his students.
Now in his "retirement," at age
71, Bettelheim will continue
observing primary school
classrooms in order to re-examine
some of the basic assumptions our
society makes about the
education of the young.
Just as he encourages his
education and psychoanalysis
students to look for the hidden
meanings behind what is taking
place in their classrooms,
Bettelheim said he will try to
discern what is going on in the

minds of teachers and students in
the primary school classrooms he
visits.
In his own class, he confronts
his graduate students with the
hidden meanings behind what
they have said. In fact, one girl in
Education and Psychoanalysis
215S complained that Bettelheim
uses a lot of class time "playing
psychoanalytic games" on his 61
students.
For example, a young man

remarking on a Him shown in class
began, "Well, it seems to me...
"Of course it seems to you!"
Bettelheim cut him off. "If it
seemed to anyone else, you
wouldn't be speaking now." Such
involuntary expressions say more
about a person than anything that
follows, he went on, calling "this
type of humility" an obstacle to
genuine communiation between
the teacher and the student.
Yet it is precisely this type of
outburst which has inhibited so
many of Bettelheim's students
from opening up in class. A girl
raised her hand and ventured, "I
think the reason we're all afraid to
speak in here, Dr. Bettelheim, is
that you are a very dangerous
man!"

"Yes," he said, smiling. "I'm
very dangerous, because I don't
overlook things that other people
would pass over."
Old-World Humor
It was the smile that redeemed
him, for it is a wide, gracious
smile — a kind smile. And
Bettelheim is well able to balance
his goading with an old-world
sense of humor.
As break-time in the two-hour
session approached, he made one
last comment on the film, "If we
really don't know what love and
affection are about, we have a
strange way of not missing it and
filling our lives with emptiness. I
now permit you to fill your
emptiness with coffee or
whatever."
Bettelheim grew up in the
intellectual circles of post-World
War I Vienna (where the ideas of
Freud and Marx dominated) and
received his doctorate at the
University of Vienna. He had been
detained at Dachau and
Buchenwald before coming to
America in 1939.
Inner Freedom
In The Informed Heart, he tells
his own struggle to retain his inner
freedom in the dehumanizing
environment of the concentration
camps. Bettelheim no longer talks
about these experiences and none
of his students have dared to ask
him about something so painful.
Having learned that society can
shatter the individual, Bettelheim
came to the Orthogenic School in
1944, with the aim of creating a
"totally therapeutic milieu" for
autistic and disturbed children.
Rather than using the
"behavioristic" approach of
rehabilitating the child to
"normal" the Orthogenic School's
staff interact with the patients on
an individual basis over a period
of three to four years,
encouraging the children to
transform their weaknesses into

strengths.
Attractive meals, sufficient
privacy, space for the toys and
possessions that make up a child's
world are part of a therapeutic
environment which, Bettelheim
said, makes the child feel that he
is important.
In Truants From Life, The
Empty Fortress, and in a book
that came out this past winter, A
Home for the Heart, Bettelheim
has written up case studies of
children at the Orthogenic School.
Since the perfect society
doesn't exist, it's all the more
important to know the self in
order for life to have meaning in
today's world, he maintains.
Even though America is a free
society, "freedom has its price
and this is a very high price,"
Bettelheim said.
"I've learned a lot about
freedom as I've grown older. If we
want freedom in all aspects of our
life, we have really very little

speak in here, Dr. Bettelheim, is
that you are a very dangerous
man!"

"Yes," he said, smiling. "I'm
very dangerous, because I don't
overlook things that other people
would pass over."
Old-World Humor
It was the smile that redeemed
him, for it is a wide, gracious
smile — a kind smile. And
Bettelheim is well able to balance
his goading with an old-world
sense of humor.
As break-time in the two-hour
session approached, he made one
last comment on the film, "If we
really don't know what love and
affection are about, we have a
strange way of not missing it and
filling our lives with emptiness. I
now permit you to fill your
emptiness with coffee or
whatever."
Bettelheim grew up in the
intellectual circles of post-World
War I Vienna (where the ideas of
Freud and Marx dominated) and
received his doctorate at the
University of Vienna. He had been
detained at Dachau and
Buchenwald before coming to
America in 1939.
Inner Freedom
In The Informed Heart, he tells
his own struggle to retain his inner
freedom in the dehumanizing
environment of the concentration
camps. Bettelheim no longer talks
about these experiences and none
of his students have dared to ask
him about something so painful.
Having learned that society can
shatter the individual, Bettelheim
came to the Orthogenic School in
1944, with the aim of creating a
"totally therapeutic milieu" for
autistic and disturbed children.
Rather than using the
"behavioristic" approach of
rehabilitating the child to
"normal" the Orthogenic School's
staff interact with the patients on
an individual basis over a period
of three to four years,
encouraging the children to
transform their weaknesses into

strengths.
Attractive meals, sufficient
privacy, space for the toys and
possessions that make up a child's
world are part of a therapeutic
environment which, Bettelheim
said, makes the child feel that he
is important.
In Truants From Life, The
Empty Fortress, and in a book
that came out this past winter, A
Home for the Heart, Bettelheim
has written up case studies of
children at the Orthogenic School.
Since the perfect society
doesn't exist, it's all the more
important to know the self in
order for life to have meaning in
today's world, he maintains.
Even though America is a free
society, "freedom has its price
and this is a very high price,"
Bettelheim said.
"I've learned a lot about
freedom as I've grown older. If we
want freedom in all aspects of our
life, we have really very little
freedom. We must define our life
activities narrowly to experience
true freedom from those areas
most important to us."
Bruno Bettelheim, visiting
graduate professor in Education
and Psychiatry, had removed his
glasses and was staring into space
as he spoke about "freedom" in
his close little office on the third
floor of Cubberley.
"Freedom comes from the self,
though the environment can help
or interfere," he said. "One of the
advantages of education is that it
gives you a chance to select an
environment for your activities;
you are less forced to accept

whatever society dishes out.
"Sometimes because of
economic and social conditions,
there is no choice in this matter.
But what bothers me is that I see
people who do have choices not
exercising them. They feel they
have to box themselves in for the
sake of earning a higher salary,
where a slight reduction in income
would give them considerably
greater freedom."
'Freeing Children*
Bettelheim is internationally
known for his dedication to
"freeing" emotionally disturbed
children during his 29 years as
director of the University of
Chicago's Sonia Shankman
Orthogenic School. About 85
percent of the patients leave the
school ready for "full
participation in life."
He retired from that post last
year and is now living in Portola
Valley. Besides teaching here,
Bettelheim has remained affiliated
with the University of Chicago
and will return there this spring.
Bettelheim has a deep

intellectual commitment to
preserving the inner self in today's
confusing world. This process of
self-awareness must begin at an
early age and should be
encouraged in the educational
system, he writes, because the
child is father to the man.
The Watergate scandal might
have been a result of raising our
children to a value-free
educational system, Bettelheim
told a social studies teachers'
conference here last month.
Elaborating later, he said, "In the
past, education transmitted very
definite values — and very
consciously.
Value-Free
"Then came the idea that we
have no right to impose specific
values. We became value-free
when we became a pluralistic
society. But we can't live without
values. Not dealing with the issue
of values prevents the child
through his educational
experience to define his own
values.
"Education shouldn't impose
values. But it should stress the
importance of the value of a good
life. That's different from
imposing.. ..
"Life is inexhaustible if you
really try to understand it,"he
tells his students.
Now in his "retirement," at age
71, Bettelheim will continue
observing primary school
classrooms in order to re-examine
some of the basic assumptions our
society makes about the
education of the young.
Just as he encourages his
education and psychoanalysis
students to look for the hidden
meanings behind what is taking
place in their classrooms,
Bettelheim said he will try to
discern what is going on in the

minds of teachers and students in
the primary school classrooms he
visits.
In his own class, he confronts
his graduate students with the
hidden meanings behind what
they have said. In fact, one girl in
Education and Psychoanalysis
215S complained that Bettelheim
uses a lot of class time "playing
psychoanalytic games" on his 61
students.
For example, a young man

remarking on a Him shown in class
began, "Well, it seems to me...
"Of course it seems to you!"
Bettelheim cut him off. "If it
seemed to anyone else, you
wouldn't be speaking now." Such
involuntary expressions say more
about a person than anything that
follows, he went on, calling "this
type of humility" an obstacle to
genuine communiation between
the teacher and the student.
Yet it is precisely this type of
outburst which has inhibited so
many of Bettelheim's students
from opening up in class. A girl
raised her hand and ventured, "I
think the reason we're all afraid to
speak in here, Dr. Bettelheim, is
that you are a very dangerous
man!"

"Yes," he said, smiling. "I'm
very dangerous, because I don't

and will return there this spring.
Bettelheim has a deep

intellectual commitment to
preserving the inner self in today's
confusing world. This process of
self-awareness must begin at an
early age and should be
encouraged in the educational
system, he writes, because the
child is father to the man.
The Watergate scandal might
have been a result of raising our
children to a value-free
educational system, Bettelheim
told a social studies teachers'
conference here last month.
Elaborating later, he said, "In the
past, education transmitted very
definite values — and very
consciously.
Value-Free
"Then came the idea that we
have no right to impose specific
values. We became value-free
when we became a pluralistic
society. But we can't live without
values. Not dealing with the issue
of values prevents the child
through his educational
experience to define his own
values.
"Education shouldn't impose
values. But it should stress the
importance of the value of a good
life. That's different from
imposing.. ..
"Life is inexhaustible if you
really try to understand it,"he
tells his students.
Now in his "retirement," at age
71, Bettelheim will continue
observing primary school
classrooms in order to re-examine
some of the basic assumptions our
society makes about the
education of the young.
Just as he encourages his
education and psychoanalysis
students to look for the hidden
meanings behind what is taking
place in their classrooms,
Bettelheim said he will try to
discern what is going on in the

minds of teachers and students in
the primary school classrooms he
visits.
In his own class, he confronts
his graduate students with the
hidden meanings behind what
they have said. In fact, one girl in
Education and Psychoanalysis
215S complained that Bettelheim
uses a lot of class time "playing
psychoanalytic games" on his 61
students.
For example, a young man

remarking on a Him shown in class
began, "Well, it seems to me...
"Of course it seems to you!"
Bettelheim cut him off. "If it
seemed to anyone else, you
wouldn't be speaking now." Such
involuntary expressions say more
about a person than anything that
follows, he went on, calling "this
type of humility" an obstacle to
genuine communiation between
the teacher and the student.
Yet it is precisely this type of
outburst which has inhibited so
many of Bettelheim's students
from opening up in class. A girl
raised her hand and ventured, "I
think the reason we're all afraid to
speak in here, Dr. Bettelheim, is
that you are a very dangerous
man!"

"Yes," he said, smiling. "I'm
very dangerous, because I don't
overlook things that other people
would pass over."
Old-World Humor
It was the smile that redeemed
him, for it is a wide, gracious
smile — a kind smile. And
Bettelheim is well able to balance
his goading with an old-world
sense of humor.
As break-time in the two-hour
session approached, he made one
last comment on the film, "If we
really don't know what love and
affection are about, we have a
strange way of not missing it and
filling our lives with emptiness. I
now permit you to fill your
emptiness with coffee or
whatever."
Bettelheim grew up in the
intellectual circles of post-World
War I Vienna (where the ideas of
Freud and Marx dominated) and
received his doctorate at the
University of Vienna. He had been
detained at Dachau and
Buchenwald before coming to
America in 1939.
Inner Freedom
In The Informed Heart, he tells
his own struggle to retain his inner
freedom in the dehumanizing
environment of the concentration
camps. Bettelheim no longer talks
about these experiences and none
of his students have dared to ask
him about something so painful.
Having learned that society can
shatter the individual, Bettelheim
came to the Orthogenic School in
1944, with the aim of creating a
"totally therapeutic milieu" for
autistic and disturbed children.
Rather than using the
"behavioristic" approach of
rehabilitating the child to
"normal" the Orthogenic School's
staff interact with the patients on
an individual basis over a period
of three to four years,
encouraging the children to
transform their weaknesses into

strengths.
Attractive meals, sufficient
privacy, space for the toys and
possessions that make up a child's
world are part of a therapeutic
environment which, Bettelheim
said, makes the child feel that he
is important.
In Truants From Life, The
Empty Fortress, and in a book
that came out this past winter, A
Home for the Heart, Bettelheim
has written up case studies of
children at the Orthogenic School.
Since the perfect society
doesn't exist, it's all the more
important to know the self in
order for life to have meaning in
today's world, he maintains.
Even though America is a free
society, "freedom has its price
and this is a very high price,"
Bettelheim said.
"I've learned a lot about
freedom as I've grown older. If we
want freedom in all aspects of our
life, we have really very little
freedom. We must define our life
activities narrowly to experience
true freedom from those areas
most important to us."
Bruno Bettelheim, visiting
graduate professor in Education
and Psychiatry, had removed his
glasses and was staring into space
as he spoke about "freedom" in
his close little office on the third
floor of Cubberley.
"Freedom comes from the self,
though the environment can help
or interfere," he said. "One of the
advantages of education is that it
gives you a chance to select an
environment for your activities;
you are less forced to accept

whatever society dishes out.
"Sometimes because of
economic and social conditions,
there is no choice in this matter.
But what bothers me is that I see
people who do have choices not
exercising them. They feel they
have to box themselves in for the
sake of earning a higher salary,
where a slight reduction in income
would give them considerably
greater freedom."
'Freeing Children*
Bettelheim is internationally
known for his dedication to
"freeing" emotionally disturbed
children during his 29 years as
director of the University of
Chicago's Sonia Shankman
Orthogenic School. About 85
percent of the patients leave the
school ready for "full
participation in life."
He retired from that post last
year and is now living in Portola
Valley. Besides teaching here,
Bettelheim has remained affiliated
with the University of Chicago
and will return there this spring.
