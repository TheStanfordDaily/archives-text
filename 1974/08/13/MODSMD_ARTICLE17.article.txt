# Bioptome â€” Safer Heart Transplants
## 
### LAURIE TREUHAFT 
The bioptome, a device used by
Stanford surgeons to predict a rejection
episode in heart patients, has "substantially
improved the survival chances of patients
with new hearts," according to Dr. Norman
Shumway, the internationally famous heart
surgeon here.
The bioptome is essentially a piece of
wire with a clipper at the end. Surgeons
thread the clipper through the jugular vein
to snip off a small section of the heart. The
technique takes 20 minutes and there is no
recuperation period afterward.
"It looks as though we've improved the
rejection death record since we began to
use the bioptome," Shumway said. Most
transplant patients die because their bodies
reject their new hearts.
Detects Rejection
The bioptome detects rejection 48
hours before it can be seen on an
electrocardiogram, according to Stanford
medical personnel.

Until the cardiogram came into use in
August, 1972, there was no safe and simple
way for taking biopsy of the heart. The
bioptome has permitted Stanford surgeons
to examine 360 biopsies.
A rejection can be most commonly
noticed by an "infiltrate of inflamatory
cells into the tissue," according to Dr.
Margaret Billingham of the Medical
Center's pathology department.
Billingham is in charge of processing and
interpreting the specimens removed with
the bioptome. She had worked closely with
former Stanford Hospital Surgeon Dr.
Philip K. Caves, who helped develop a
more flexible model of the original
bioptome invented in Japan.
Drugs Dangerous
Rejection may occur several times
within a week of the transplant, Billingham
said. It can be reversed by drugs, but these
drugs "knock out" the body defenses,
making the patient susceptible to infection,
she explained. With the bioptome, a

rejection can be detected early enough so
that overtreatment with dangerous drugs
won't be necessary, she added.
Billingham said that only one major
problem occurred when the heart was
perforated by the bioptome, but this
problem was corrected without surgery.
The bioptome has opened a "whole new
world" because for the first time, doctors
can study live human tissue with the
electron microscope, she said. Dead tissue
cannot be studied on this microscope.
Live Tissue
The chemistry of the heart cells and the
presence of anti-bodies to the new heart
can be examined in the live tissue removed
with the bioptome, Billingham added.
The bioptome has been used at the
National Institute of Health in Bethesda,
Md., at hospitals in London and in Japan,
where it was invented, but Stanford is now
the only medical center in the country
using the bioptome on a regular basis,
according to Billingham.

The bioptome has been used at the
National Institute of Health in Bethesda,
Md., at hospitals in London and in Japan,
where it was invented, but Stanford is now
the only medical center in the country
using the bioptome on a regular basis,
according to Billingham.
The bioptome, a device used by
Stanford surgeons to predict a rejection
episode in heart patients, has "substantially
improved the survival chances of patients
with new hearts," according to Dr. Norman
Shumway, the internationally famous heart
surgeon here.
The bioptome is essentially a piece of
wire with a clipper at the end. Surgeons
thread the clipper through the jugular vein
to snip off a small section of the heart. The
technique takes 20 minutes and there is no
recuperation period afterward.
"It looks as though we've improved the
rejection death record since we began to
use the bioptome," Shumway said. Most
transplant patients die because their bodies
reject their new hearts.
Detects Rejection
The bioptome detects rejection 48
hours before it can be seen on an
electrocardiogram, according to Stanford
medical personnel.

Until the cardiogram came into use in
August, 1972, there was no safe and simple
way for taking biopsy of the heart. The
bioptome has permitted Stanford surgeons
to examine 360 biopsies.
A rejection can be most commonly
noticed by an "infiltrate of inflamatory
cells into the tissue," according to Dr.
Margaret Billingham of the Medical
Center's pathology department.
Billingham is in charge of processing and
interpreting the specimens removed with
the bioptome. She had worked closely with
former Stanford Hospital Surgeon Dr.
Philip K. Caves, who helped develop a
more flexible model of the original
bioptome invented in Japan.
Drugs Dangerous
Rejection may occur several times
within a week of the transplant, Billingham
said. It can be reversed by drugs, but these
drugs "knock out" the body defenses,
making the patient susceptible to infection,
she explained. With the bioptome, a

rejection can be detected early enough so
that overtreatment with dangerous drugs
won't be necessary, she added.
Billingham said that only one major
problem occurred when the heart was
perforated by the bioptome, but this
problem was corrected without surgery.
The bioptome has opened a "whole new
world" because for the first time, doctors
can study live human tissue with the
electron microscope, she said. Dead tissue
cannot be studied on this microscope.
Live Tissue
The chemistry of the heart cells and the
presence of anti-bodies to the new heart
can be examined in the live tissue removed
with the bioptome, Billingham added.
