# Undergraduate Housing Additions Recommended
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
"Construction of 850 student
housing spaces" for
undergraduates at the
approximate cost of $25 million
over the next seven to 10 years is
recommended by a housing study
just released.
Titled "Undergraduate Student
Housing Needs at Stanford,
1974-1984," it recommends
immediate construction of three
Row houses accommodating
about 50 persons each to be
complete by Sept., 1976. The cost
for these is estimated at $1.2
million each.
The report also envisions an
additional 700 spaces to be added
as "a cluster or pattern of 10 to
14 houses of 50 to 70 students
each," probably with a central
kitchen, dining area and

commons. The cost for stage two
is an estimated $21.4 million.
The extensive report was
prepared by Larry Horton,
associate dean of student affairs;
Edward A. Scoles, director of
housing and food services; and
Edward E. Shaw, executive
assistant to the vice president and
provost.
Horton has indicated that
though approval isn't certain, "the
housing office is proceeding as if
it were ready to go." A student
committee has been set up to
make recommendations about the
construction of the Row Houses.
Housing Demand
The 850 figure takes into
account "a current undergraduate
housing demand of 390
incremental units" and replacing
460 spaces of Manzanita Park,
which the report says should be
replaced "as soon as it becomes
financially feasible."
The new units will be financed
by gifts, loans and higher room
and board rates.
A goal of $3 million in new
gifts "is forseen as the minimal
level of giving needed" to finance
the project, the report says. By
mid-1975, a gift of $750,000 by
Robert S. Moore, donated in
1961, should be worth $1.5
million w»h interest, the report
says.
Though the Campaign for
Stanford includes a $3 million
goal "for a variety of residence
purposes" apparently "no funds
have been raised toward this
target, because it has low
priority" the report notes.
'Minimal Financing'
The combined $4.5 in gifts is

considered "minimal financing"
necessary and will need to be
accompanied by $20,534,000 in
commercial loans, to complete the
project.
"Optimal financing consists
of" $8.5 in gifts, including the
Moore Fund and $16,543,000 of
California Educational Facilities
Authority (CEFA) loans.
The CEFA loan terms are
estimated to be 30 years at 5 3 A
percent interest compared to
commercial loans which have
terms of 25 years at eight percent
interest, the report notes.
Room And Board Rates
If the project is begun, as
expected, room and board rates
will be affected beginning
1975-76. This next year students
living in a dormatory and taking a
full meal plan will pay $1535.
Under "steady state" increases,
projected by estimated
inflationary factors, room and
board rates would increase an
average of 6.4 percent annually
through 1984.
However, if the residence staff
expenses are transferred so that
students, rather • than the
University support them, along
with the increases due because of
the new housing, room and board
rates would rise between 7.9 and
8.6 percent, depending on
whether minimal or optimum
financing were attained.
