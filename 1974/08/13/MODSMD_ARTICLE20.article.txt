# Bill May Aid Middle-Income Students
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN CAROL MOLDAW 
Students from middle-income families,
currently feeling the pinch of rising
education costs, might get a financial break if
the State Senate passes a bill known as the
"tuition grant bill."
The bill, designed to provide $1 million in
scholarship aid to students who are now
economically ineligible for grants, comes
before the Senate education committee
tomorrow.
Set to begin in 1975, the scholarships
would come in the amounts of $900 or
one-third the annual tuition, whichever is
less, according to the proposal. This money
would be independent of the California State

Scholarships currently available.
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer,
organizing a letter-writing campaign on
campus in support of the bill, noted that
more than 60 percent of the student body
here received some form of financial aid.
In urging students to write to committee
members, Mayer said he is working with an
ad-hoc lobby group to put pressure on
legislators to approve the bill, AB 3862.
"It's a problem that 80 percent of the
students here now are not matriculating
Stanford students," Mayer said of the
summer population.
Another group called the Association of

Independent California Colleges and
Universities has organized a drive to raise
written support from administrators and
trustees of the member institutions, he
added, including Stanford.
Mayer told the Daily that "six of the 11
senate committee members have indicated
verbally that they are in favor of the bill."
Among the committee members are local
Senators Alfred Alquist, D—San Jose, Arlen
Gregorio, D—San Mateo and George
Moscone, D—San Francisco.
Both candidates for lieutenant governor,
Sen. Mervyn Dymally, D— Los Angeles, and
Sen. John L. Harmer, R—Glendale, also serve
on the committee.
