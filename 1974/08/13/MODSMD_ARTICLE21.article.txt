# Spokane's Expo '74

It has been called everything from "great" to "a waste of
time" to "just interesting." Officials predict that before it ends,
over 4.8 million people will see it.
Whatever the reaction, Expo '74 certainly provides Spokane,
Wash, with more excitement and publicity than any other event
in the city's history.
The theme of the fair is ecology, "Celebrating Tomorrow's
Fresh New Environment." The number of pavilions doesn't
surpass Montreal's Expo '67, (notably with Israel and Egypt
missing), but the quality of many exhibits is up to par.
Those worth seeing include: the $11 million U.S. pavilion
(center right) which features a 70mm film projected on a screen
six stories high, a recycling exhibit containing real garbage (upper
left) and a fountain made from sinks, shower heads and bathtubs
(lower left); the Kodak exhibit which features the best slide show
of the fair; the People's Republic of China's display which
contains a good multi-media presentation; and the USSR exhibit.
Visitors are warned not to make wisecracks in the Russian
pavilion, as people have been "asked to leave."
It is interesting to note that while other nations point out
ecological problems and their solutions, Russia boasts superior
technology and denies the existence of any such problems.
Unfortunately, as evidenced by the extremely warm temperature
inside the pavilion, this technology does not extend to the
people's air conditioning.
Although the fair concentrates on national exhibits, certain
individual states, including Montana, Oregon and Idaho also
provide displays. The $11.9 million Washington state pavilion
includes an opera house and convention center, both of which
will remain permanently.
California does not have an exhibit, because, according to one
guide, 'They didn't want to spend the money."
Native American (lower right) and Afro-American exhibits are
also open for the public and as part of the Alaskan exhibit, men
spend a month carving individual totem poles (upper right).
The Fair continues through the end of October.
