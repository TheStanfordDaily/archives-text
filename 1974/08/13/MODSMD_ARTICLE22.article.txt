# Ensemble 'Alice': Mad
## 
### D. PAUL YEUELL 
The present production of Alice in Wonderland and Through The
Looking Glass approaches the dream movement of a mind on the edge
of deep sleep.
Virtually unencumbered by the heavy artifices of linear plot
development or strained comic construction, this Alice provides very
fine and innovative threatre.
The four players — Sam Ambler, Peggy Scott, Martha Lubow and
Ann DePanger — not only play all of Lewis Carroll's characters, but
also all play Alice.
They switch mid-scene and sometimes three or four play Alice
simultaneously. The result is an effective, fleeting portrayal of a
confused girl in a lively dream.
In the first act, Alice has as her chief motivation getting to the
Queen's garden and in the second act, becoming a queen. Beyond
that, the story has little underlying framework. The rest is madness.
A rhythm begins with the first scene and continues throughout.
The nearly conscious beat holds the piece together like a dance.
A score of original modern music re-enforces the rhythmic
movement of the play. The music, written and played by Jim
Baldwin, evades facile description, but effectively adds another
dimension to this production.
In addition to the taped musical score, the hardware for this show
includes single slide projections of Tenniel drawings, strobe lights, 360
degree slide projections, and a laser sculpture.
Long marches, wide open dances, charging fights, and end-to-end
speeches give this staging a much stronger sense of time and space
than conventional staging could.
The Mad Tea Party scene involves movement in four directions at
once, nearly song-like pacing and a very mad party. Martha Lubow,
the Hatter, overflows with all the fidgets, inappropriate half-laughs
and anteater sneers of a hyperkinetic nine year old boy.
Tweedle Dee Dee and Tweedle Dee Dum (Peggy Scott and Ann
Depanger) move through an absurd ditty and a bungled battle in a
tightly choreographed scene which snowballs out of their insane
psychic tug-o-wars.
Sam Ambler's time as Alice is especially interesting. Self-conscious
and delicate with his big hands, Sam aptly portrays a young girl in her
own dream.
