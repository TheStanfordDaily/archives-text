# Buddy Rich Wraps Up Concord Fest
## 
### DAN FORTE 
(Editor's note: This is the last of a
series of reports from the Concord
Summer Festival by Daily jazz
critic Dan Forte.)

Bringing things back to
Concord's usual high standard
Sunday night, Aug. 4, was Monty
Alexander, a fine 30-year-old
pianist from Jamaica.
Alexander excels at playing
jazz arrangements of Top 40
material, like "You Are the
Sunshine of My Life," "Let's Stay
Together," and "Shaft."
His most swinging number by
far though was his unorthodox
treatment of "Battle Hymn of the
Republic."
Backing. Alexander was Duffy
Jackson — a fine, energetic
drummer still in his 20s — who is
the son of bassist Chubby
Jackson, from Woody Herman's
"First Herd." On bass, making his
fifth appearance in six nights, was
Ray Brown who is always
unbeatable.
'Happy Birthday'
As an encore, the trio, along
with jazz critic-singer Jon
Hendricks, played "Happy

Birthday" for guitarist Herb Ellis
who was celebrating his 53rd
birthday.
Next on was percussionist
Airto with his wife, Flora Purim,
and their small group.
A set by Airto Moreira,
formerly of Miles Davis' group, is
more of a lesson in percussion
than a performance, as he explains
the history of many of the
percussion instruments in his vast
collection, and demonstrates —
extremely well — their use.
This he did with a tambourine
(played like you've never heard
one), a berimbao(which looks like
a cross between a hunting bow
and a peace pipe), and an
instrument given to him in Paris
which he doesn't even know the
name of. He says it took him a
long time to realize that you had
to blow in it rather than beat or
shake it.
Chanting, Stomping
All these demonstrations were
done by Airto alone,
accompanying himself with his
own style of chanting and foot
stomping. He also soloed on
American drums.

Some of the audience's
attention may have been lost
during Airto's long explanations,
but for those who listened it was
very interesting, informative, and
occasionally funny ("I'm gonna
play this piece of shit now").
To close Concord's activities
this year was the man who has for
years earned the title of the
"world's greatest drummer,"
Buddy Rich.
Rich and his small group Six,
with Sal Nastico on tenor and
Herb Ellis (also making his fifth
appearance), played fine versions
of such standards as "St. Louis
Blues," "Don't Get Around Much
Anymore," and Miles' "All
Blues."
Rich played a subdued solo on
"All Blues" in 6/8 time, but
didn't really take off until later in
the set on "Giggles" from his
most recent LP.
Incredible Drumming
Here he did what everyone had
come to see, a ten minute-plus
exhibition of some genuinely
incredible drumming gymnastics

which, at this point in his career,
is almost like Oscar Peterson
playing "Chopsticks."
Rich can do more with just his
snare drum than most good
drummers can do with a 16-piece
set.
One immediately noticeable
aspect of the Concord brand of
jazz festival is the choice of jazz
styles presented, presumably due
to the preferences of the festival's
president and general manager,
Carl Jefferson.
The Concord Summer Festival
seems to reflect the upper-middle
class, white community in which
it takes place.
No Jam
There is an obvious emphasis
on orchestras, pianos, guitars, and
the more "commercial" end of
jazz. There is a definite gap when
it comes to bebop, blues, horn
players, and the "blacker" side of
jazz. The jam atmosphere is not
felt.
This is not to say that artists
such as Pearl Bailey, Peter Nero,

and Michel Legrand aren't worthy
of this type of exposure. But, it
seems a shame that such giants as
Kenny Clarke, Dexter Gordon,
and the late Bud Powell have had
to go to Europe to receive their
just rewards.
Would it be that hard for
Concord to book such musicians?
The problem certainly wouldn't
be financial; money is the one
thing Concord seems to have
plenty of. Pearl Bailey doesn't
come cheap.
Nevertheless promoting a jazz
concert (much less a festival) is
always a big risk — jazz not being
an extremely commercial idiom.
All jazz fans (all music fans for
this matter) owe Carl Jefferson
and the city of Concord a huge
thank you.
Not only has Jefferson brought
some real giants to the Bay Area
for the past six years, but he has
also somehow made it a very
successful venture judging by the
enthusiastic crowds and the new
outdoor pavilion to open next
year.

Herb Ellis (also making his fifth
appearance), played fine versions
of such standards as "St. Louis
Blues," "Don't Get Around Much
Anymore," and Miles' "All
Blues."
Rich played a subdued solo on
"All Blues" in 6/8 time, but
didn't really take off until later in
the set on "Giggles" from his
most recent LP.
Incredible Drumming
Here he did what everyone had
come to see, a ten minute-plus
exhibition of some genuinely
incredible drumming gymnastics

which, at this point in his career,
is almost like Oscar Peterson
playing "Chopsticks."
Rich can do more with just his
snare drum than most good
drummers can do with a 16-piece
set.
One immediately noticeable
aspect of the Concord brand of
jazz festival is the choice of jazz
styles presented, presumably due
to the preferences of the festival's
president and general manager,
Carl Jefferson.
The Concord Summer Festival
seems to reflect the upper-middle
class, white community in which
it takes place.
No Jam
There is an obvious emphasis
on orchestras, pianos, guitars, and
the more "commercial" end of
jazz. There is a definite gap when
it comes to bebop, blues, horn
players, and the "blacker" side of
jazz. The jam atmosphere is not
felt.
This is not to say that artists
such as Pearl Bailey, Peter Nero,

and Michel Legrand aren't worthy
of this type of exposure. But, it
seems a shame that such giants as
Kenny Clarke, Dexter Gordon,
and the late Bud Powell have had
to go to Europe to receive their
just rewards.
Would it be that hard for
Concord to book such musicians?
The problem certainly wouldn't
be financial; money is the one
thing Concord seems to have
plenty of. Pearl Bailey doesn't
come cheap.
Nevertheless promoting a jazz
concert (much less a festival) is
always a big risk — jazz not being
an extremely commercial idiom.
All jazz fans (all music fans for
this matter) owe Carl Jefferson
and the city of Concord a huge
thank you.
Not only has Jefferson brought
some real giants to the Bay Area
for the past six years, but he has
also somehow made it a very
successful venture judging by the
enthusiastic crowds and the new
outdoor pavilion to open next
year.
(Editor's note: This is the last of a
series of reports from the Concord
Summer Festival by Daily jazz
critic Dan Forte.)

Bringing things back to
Concord's usual high standard
Sunday night, Aug. 4, was Monty
Alexander, a fine 30-year-old
pianist from Jamaica.
Alexander excels at playing
jazz arrangements of Top 40
material, like "You Are the
Sunshine of My Life," "Let's Stay
Together," and "Shaft."
His most swinging number by
far though was his unorthodox
treatment of "Battle Hymn of the
Republic."
Backing. Alexander was Duffy
Jackson — a fine, energetic
drummer still in his 20s — who is
the son of bassist Chubby
Jackson, from Woody Herman's
"First Herd." On bass, making his
fifth appearance in six nights, was
Ray Brown who is always
unbeatable.
'Happy Birthday'
As an encore, the trio, along
with jazz critic-singer Jon
Hendricks, played "Happy

Birthday" for guitarist Herb Ellis
who was celebrating his 53rd
birthday.
Next on was percussionist
Airto with his wife, Flora Purim,
and their small group.
A set by Airto Moreira,
formerly of Miles Davis' group, is
more of a lesson in percussion
than a performance, as he explains
the history of many of the
percussion instruments in his vast
collection, and demonstrates —
extremely well — their use.
This he did with a tambourine
(played like you've never heard
one), a berimbao(which looks like
a cross between a hunting bow
and a peace pipe), and an
instrument given to him in Paris
which he doesn't even know the
name of. He says it took him a
long time to realize that you had
to blow in it rather than beat or
shake it.
Chanting, Stomping
All these demonstrations were
done by Airto alone,
accompanying himself with his
own style of chanting and foot
stomping. He also soloed on
American drums.

Some of the audience's
attention may have been lost
during Airto's long explanations,
but for those who listened it was
very interesting, informative, and
occasionally funny ("I'm gonna
play this piece of shit now").
To close Concord's activities
this year was the man who has for
years earned the title of the
"world's greatest drummer,"
Buddy Rich.
Rich and his small group Six,
with Sal Nastico on tenor and
Herb Ellis (also making his fifth
appearance), played fine versions
of such standards as "St. Louis

Bringing things back to
Concord's usual high standard
Sunday night, Aug. 4, was Monty
Alexander, a fine 30-year-old
pianist from Jamaica.
Alexander excels at playing
jazz arrangements of Top 40
material, like "You Are the
Sunshine of My Life," "Let's Stay
Together," and "Shaft."
His most swinging number by
far though was his unorthodox
treatment of "Battle Hymn of the
Republic."
Backing. Alexander was Duffy
Jackson — a fine, energetic
drummer still in his 20s — who is
the son of bassist Chubby
Jackson, from Woody Herman's
"First Herd." On bass, making his
fifth appearance in six nights, was
Ray Brown who is always
unbeatable.
'Happy Birthday'
As an encore, the trio, along
with jazz critic-singer Jon
Hendricks, played "Happy

Birthday" for guitarist Herb Ellis
who was celebrating his 53rd
birthday.
Next on was percussionist
Airto with his wife, Flora Purim,
and their small group.
A set by Airto Moreira,
formerly of Miles Davis' group, is
more of a lesson in percussion
than a performance, as he explains
the history of many of the
percussion instruments in his vast
collection, and demonstrates —
extremely well — their use.
This he did with a tambourine
(played like you've never heard
one), a berimbao(which looks like
a cross between a hunting bow
and a peace pipe), and an
instrument given to him in Paris
which he doesn't even know the
name of. He says it took him a
long time to realize that you had
to blow in it rather than beat or
shake it.
Chanting, Stomping
All these demonstrations were
done by Airto alone,
accompanying himself with his
own style of chanting and foot
stomping. He also soloed on
American drums.

Some of the audience's
attention may have been lost
during Airto's long explanations,
but for those who listened it was
very interesting, informative, and
occasionally funny ("I'm gonna
play this piece of shit now").
To close Concord's activities
this year was the man who has for
years earned the title of the
"world's greatest drummer,"
Buddy Rich.
Rich and his small group Six,
with Sal Nastico on tenor and
Herb Ellis (also making his fifth
appearance), played fine versions
of such standards as "St. Louis
Blues," "Don't Get Around Much
Anymore," and Miles' "All
Blues."
Rich played a subdued solo on
"All Blues" in 6/8 time, but
didn't really take off until later in
the set on "Giggles" from his
most recent LP.
Incredible Drumming
Here he did what everyone had
come to see, a ten minute-plus
exhibition of some genuinely
incredible drumming gymnastics

which, at this point in his career,
is almost like Oscar Peterson
playing "Chopsticks."
Rich can do more with just his
snare drum than most good
drummers can do with a 16-piece
set.
One immediately noticeable
aspect of the Concord brand of
jazz festival is the choice of jazz
styles presented, presumably due
to the preferences of the festival's
president and general manager,
Carl Jefferson.
The Concord Summer Festival
seems to reflect the upper-middle
class, white community in which
it takes place.
No Jam
There is an obvious emphasis
on orchestras, pianos, guitars, and
the more "commercial" end of
jazz. There is a definite gap when
it comes to bebop, blues, horn
players, and the "blacker" side of
jazz. The jam atmosphere is not
felt.
This is not to say that artists
such as Pearl Bailey, Peter Nero,

and Michel Legrand aren't worthy
of this type of exposure. But, it
seems a shame that such giants as
Kenny Clarke, Dexter Gordon,
and the late Bud Powell have had
to go to Europe to receive their
just rewards.
Would it be that hard for
Concord to book such musicians?
The problem certainly wouldn't
be financial; money is the one
thing Concord seems to have
plenty of. Pearl Bailey doesn't
come cheap.
Nevertheless promoting a jazz
concert (much less a festival) is
always a big risk — jazz not being
an extremely commercial idiom.
All jazz fans (all music fans for
this matter) owe Carl Jefferson
and the city of Concord a huge
thank you.
Not only has Jefferson brought
some real giants to the Bay Area
for the past six years, but he has
also somehow made it a very
successful venture judging by the
enthusiastic crowds and the new
outdoor pavilion to open next
year.
