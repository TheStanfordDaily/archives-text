## 1974: Year For College Football 
### Vlae Kershner 
Richard Nixon was basically a
pro football fan, reserving his
finest compliments for Don Shula,
George Allen and their charges.
Gerald Ford, on the other
hand, is strictly a college man. He
starred for Michigan in the early
1930s and has retained his interest
in the college game ever since.
In fact, Ford as vice president,
was committed to attending the
East-West Shrine Game, in
Stanford Stadium December 28.
Bob Murphy, director of the
Shrine Game, is hopeful that the
President's schedule will permit
him to honor this commitment.
The change from Nixon to
Ford, coincidentally of course,
comes simultaneously with the
emergence of a widespread belief
that greedy pro football is killing
itself with its strikes and that fans
will now turn to the more honest
college game.
OK, the analogy doesn't really
hold up because college football
isn't exactly saintly. Then again,
neither is Jerry Ford.
The preceding message was a
stilted introduction to the fact
that college football is here again.
Fall practice begins in 13 days,
the Stanford season in a month.
In preparation for the hordes
of reporters who will soon
descend on an otherwise-deserted

campus to write season previews,
Stanford just released its 1974
football press book.
Esthetically, it is no
masterpiece. The full-color cover
features a photo of "Pretty 1973
Stanford Pompon Dollie Linda
Thomas," while Stanford's two
Ail-Americans, Roger Stillwell and
Pat Donovan, are relegated to
black-and-white photos on the
inside covers.
The same photo of Thomas
also graces Stanford's card
schedules. The whole thing is
testament to an archaic fetish of
Murphy's.
The former sports information
director, otherwise a brilliant
promoter, had the misconception
that all of Stanford, like a few
drunken sportswriters, spent its
time analyzing the beauty of the
school's coeds.
Luckily, Murphy's successor,
Gary Cavalli, will probably spend
less time photographing girls and
more making future press books
readable.
This year's press book is the
worst of the four I've seen so far.
While it contains the relevant
information, it lacks interesting
quotes and feature-ish material.
It's also written in Ziegleresque
style. A brief on the National
Football Hall of Fame lists

Stanford's 12 representatives
"who have been immortalized in
this Shrine of the Great American
Game."
A biography of Norb Hecker
calls him the former coach of the
"expansionist Atlanta Falcons."
Does that mean they're trying to
take over South Carolina?
The press book also rewrites
history. It says that punter Tom
Lynn "moved to the freshman-JV
team when Dave Ottmar
recovered from an injury."
I agree with the press book
that Lynn will be a fine punter
this year, but why not come out
and say that Ottmar planned to
redshirt 1973 but was forced to
return because Lynn's punting
was so ineffective?
Oh well, enough nitpicking.
The press book also lists the
preliminary depth chart for
Stanford in 1974.
As expected, Mike Cordova is

listed first at the quarterback
spot, with Jerry Waldvogel and
Guy Benjamin trailing in that
order.
The press guide insists the QB
job is still wide open, though such
observers as Playboy's Anson
Mount say flatly that Stanford's
offense depends on how well
Cordova plays.
Mount predicted that Stanford
would finish 5-6, which is two
standard deviations from what
most observers think.
Personally, I think Stanford
will be 8-3 or so. The Cards aren't
as good, on paper, as USC and
Michigan, and are a toss-up with
weakened Penn State and UCLA.
