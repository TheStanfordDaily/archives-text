Ford's Priority: Stopping Inflation
WASHINGTON — President Gerald Ford told the
nation last night that stopping inflation would be the first
priority of his administration.
In a nationally broadcast speech made before a joint
session of Congress, the new President indicated he would
act strongly to stop the government from spending too
much money.
Ford said he favors reestablishing the cost of living
council to expose abuses, but not to impose controls.
Ford said "it does no good to blame the public for
spending too much when the government is spending too
much." While he obliquely threatened to veto inflationary
bills, he warned against "unwarranted cuts in the national
defense."
In a speech frequently punctuated by levity, Ford said
he would be President of all Americans — "women
feminists and male chauvinists alike."
Ford also promised that "there will be no illegal
tapings, eavesdroppings, buggings or break-ins in my
administration."
Nearly all reaction to Ford's speech was favorable.
Former President Richard Nixon sent a telegram to his
successor praising him for his "splendid speech."
Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield, D—Mont., said
he "was impressed," while his G.O.P. counterpart, Hugh
Scott, said the speech was "a real bellringer."
Sen. Barry Goldwater, R—Ariz., said the speech was
"just what the country needs." Goldwater said he
recommended that Ford propose a 10 percent across the
board cut in federal salaries and programs.
Sen. Russell Long, D—La., also liked the speech but said
he was dismayed that Ford thought inflation could be
controlled by cutting the budget. Long is chairman of the
Finance Committee.
Earlier yesterday, Ford's press secretary, Jerald
TerHorst, indicated Ford was disappointed by the huge
General Motors price hikes. TerHorst said "It makes it
difficult for him to call on others to show restraint when a
giant such as GM takes unilateral action such as this."
Turkey Threatens To Leave Talks
GENEVA — Turkey reportedly has issued an ultimatum
to the Greek and Cypriot governments that unless Turkish

proposals on Cyprus are accepted by today, Turkey will
pull out of the talks.
The Turks want autonomous zones for Turkish
Cypriots, but Cypriot President Glafkos Clerides has
termed such demands unacceptable. British representatives
at the Geneva talks have tried to get the two sides to
compromise, without much success.
Meanwhile, on the island itself, fighting erupted
yesterday after three days of relative peace. While there
was little information on the fighting, observers said
Turkish invaders and Greek Cypriot national guardsmen
exchanged rifle and mortar fire.
Argentine Troops Kill Guerillas
BUENOS AIRES — The Argentine government
reported yesterday that its troops killed 15 Marxist
guerrillas in an attack on one of their hideouts.
The military has been combing several provinces in
search of members of the People's Revolutionary Army.
Guerrilla activity has been reported on the rise. On
Sunday, five persons were killed in guerrilla attacks in
Cordoba and Catamarca provinces. A total of 26 persons
have died in the last two days.
Yesterday's battle lasted six hours at a hideout in a
ravine northwest of Buenos Aires. Accounts said that none
of the guerrillas survived.
Nixon, Aides Handle Paper Work
SAN CLEMENTE — Former President Richard M.
Nixon spent yesterday with aides discussing how to handle
an enormous amount of paper work.
Nixon, residing at the former Western White House in
San Clemente, has been working with three top aides;
Ronald Ziegler, Stephen Bull and Col. Jack Brennan.
Over the weekend, Nixon spent time with his family
and with friends Charles "Bebe" Rebozo and Robert
Abplanalp. Abplanalp said "he seemed fine; he is not at all
upset."
Meanwhile, it seems as if the Senate, though not
wanting Nixon to be prosecuted for any crimes committed
while he was President, was reluctant to pass any measure
to that effect.
Sen. Edward Brooke, R—Mass., has proposed an
"immunity resolution" that would recommend
prosecutors not bring charges against Nixon.

Leaders of both parties indicated, however, that the
proposed resolution would not pass. "This is none of our
business," Sen.Norris Cotton, leader of the Senate G.O.P.
conference, said.
Ford Gathers Advice For V.P.
WASHINGTON — President Gerald Ford is getting a lot
of advice from Republicans across the nation on who to
name as his vice president.
Today, House minority leader John Rhodes, R—Ariz,
was expected to take sealed envelopes to the new
President bearing the names of candidates for the job
suggested by House leaders of both parties.
Yesterday, the conservative United Republicans of
California recommended Rep. John Ashbrook, R—Ohio,
for the job.
The Northeast Republicans Chairmen's Association,
meanwhile, endorsed former New York Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller, listing party chairman George Bush as a
second choice.
The Daily learned last night from a
Stanford-in-Washington source that former Atty. Gen.
Elliot Richardson is considered a likely choice.
L.A. Bus Strike Jams Traffic
LOS ANGELES — Traffic jams in Los Angeles were
reported even worse than usual yesterday as a result of a
bus strike.
The strike of over 3000 drivers and 700 mechanics shut
down the city's 2000-bus fleet yesterday. About 650,000
commuters in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties were affected.
While a Los Angeles police spokesman said the traffic
was not unmanageable, traffic was backed up over 12
miles on one freeway yesterday morning, and similar jams
were reported at night, with the San Bernardino freeway
most seriously affected.
No further talks are scheduled between the United
Transportation Union and the Southern California Rapid
Transit District.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except for low clouds late night
and mornings. Highs today in the 70s to low 80s, low
tonight in the 50s.

Abplanalp. Abplanalp said "he seemed fine; he is not at all

Meanwhile, it seems as if the Senate, though not
wanting Nixon to be prosecuted for any crimes committed
while he was President, was reluctant to pass any measure
to that effect.
Sen. Edward Brooke, R—Mass., has proposed an
"immunity resolution" that would recommend
prosecutors not bring charges against Nixon.

Leaders of both parties indicated, however, that the
proposed resolution would not pass. "This is none of our
business," Sen.Norris Cotton, leader of the Senate G.O.P.
conference, said.
Ford Gathers Advice For V.P.
WASHINGTON — President Gerald Ford is getting a lot
of advice from Republicans across the nation on who to
name as his vice president.
Today, House minority leader John Rhodes, R—Ariz,
was expected to take sealed envelopes to the new
President bearing the names of candidates for the job
suggested by House leaders of both parties.
Yesterday, the conservative United Republicans of
California recommended Rep. John Ashbrook, R—Ohio,
for the job.
The Northeast Republicans Chairmen's Association,
meanwhile, endorsed former New York Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller, listing party chairman George Bush as a
second choice.
The Daily learned last night from a
Stanford-in-Washington source that former Atty. Gen.
Elliot Richardson is considered a likely choice.
L.A. Bus Strike Jams Traffic
LOS ANGELES — Traffic jams in Los Angeles were
reported even worse than usual yesterday as a result of a
bus strike.
The strike of over 3000 drivers and 700 mechanics shut
down the city's 2000-bus fleet yesterday. About 650,000
commuters in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties were affected.
While a Los Angeles police spokesman said the traffic
was not unmanageable, traffic was backed up over 12
miles on one freeway yesterday morning, and similar jams
were reported at night, with the San Bernardino freeway
most seriously affected.
No further talks are scheduled between the United
Transportation Union and the Southern California Rapid
Transit District.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except for low clouds late night
and mornings. Highs today in the 70s to low 80s, low
tonight in the 50s.
Ford's Priority: Stopping Inflation
WASHINGTON — President Gerald Ford told the
nation last night that stopping inflation would be the first
priority of his administration.
In a nationally broadcast speech made before a joint
session of Congress, the new President indicated he would
act strongly to stop the government from spending too
much money.
Ford said he favors reestablishing the cost of living
council to expose abuses, but not to impose controls.
Ford said "it does no good to blame the public for
spending too much when the government is spending too
much." While he obliquely threatened to veto inflationary
bills, he warned against "unwarranted cuts in the national
defense."
In a speech frequently punctuated by levity, Ford said
he would be President of all Americans — "women
feminists and male chauvinists alike."
Ford also promised that "there will be no illegal
tapings, eavesdroppings, buggings or break-ins in my
administration."
Nearly all reaction to Ford's speech was favorable.
Former President Richard Nixon sent a telegram to his
successor praising him for his "splendid speech."
Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield, D—Mont., said
he "was impressed," while his G.O.P. counterpart, Hugh
Scott, said the speech was "a real bellringer."
Sen. Barry Goldwater, R—Ariz., said the speech was
"just what the country needs." Goldwater said he
recommended that Ford propose a 10 percent across the
board cut in federal salaries and programs.
Sen. Russell Long, D—La., also liked the speech but said
he was dismayed that Ford thought inflation could be
controlled by cutting the budget. Long is chairman of the
Finance Committee.
Earlier yesterday, Ford's press secretary, Jerald
TerHorst, indicated Ford was disappointed by the huge
General Motors price hikes. TerHorst said "It makes it
difficult for him to call on others to show restraint when a
giant such as GM takes unilateral action such as this."
Turkey Threatens To Leave Talks
GENEVA — Turkey reportedly has issued an ultimatum
to the Greek and Cypriot governments that unless Turkish

proposals on Cyprus are accepted by today, Turkey will
pull out of the talks.
The Turks want autonomous zones for Turkish
Cypriots, but Cypriot President Glafkos Clerides has
termed such demands unacceptable. British representatives
at the Geneva talks have tried to get the two sides to
compromise, without much success.
Meanwhile, on the island itself, fighting erupted
yesterday after three days of relative peace. While there
was little information on the fighting, observers said
Turkish invaders and Greek Cypriot national guardsmen
exchanged rifle and mortar fire.
Argentine Troops Kill Guerillas
BUENOS AIRES — The Argentine government
reported yesterday that its troops killed 15 Marxist
guerrillas in an attack on one of their hideouts.
The military has been combing several provinces in
search of members of the People's Revolutionary Army.
Guerrilla activity has been reported on the rise. On
Sunday, five persons were killed in guerrilla attacks in
Cordoba and Catamarca provinces. A total of 26 persons
have died in the last two days.
Yesterday's battle lasted six hours at a hideout in a
ravine northwest of Buenos Aires. Accounts said that none
of the guerrillas survived.
Nixon, Aides Handle Paper Work
SAN CLEMENTE — Former President Richard M.
Nixon spent yesterday with aides discussing how to handle
an enormous amount of paper work.
Nixon, residing at the former Western White House in
San Clemente, has been working with three top aides;
Ronald Ziegler, Stephen Bull and Col. Jack Brennan.
Over the weekend, Nixon spent time with his family
and with friends Charles "Bebe" Rebozo and Robert
Abplanalp. Abplanalp said "he seemed fine; he is not at all

Sen. Barry Goldwater, R—Ariz., said the speech was
"just what the country needs." Goldwater said he
recommended that Ford propose a 10 percent across the
board cut in federal salaries and programs.
Sen. Russell Long, D—La., also liked the speech but said
he was dismayed that Ford thought inflation could be
controlled by cutting the budget. Long is chairman of the
Finance Committee.
Earlier yesterday, Ford's press secretary, Jerald
TerHorst, indicated Ford was disappointed by the huge
General Motors price hikes. TerHorst said "It makes it
difficult for him to call on others to show restraint when a
giant such as GM takes unilateral action such as this."
Turkey Threatens To Leave Talks
GENEVA — Turkey reportedly has issued an ultimatum
to the Greek and Cypriot governments that unless Turkish

proposals on Cyprus are accepted by today, Turkey will
pull out of the talks.
The Turks want autonomous zones for Turkish
Cypriots, but Cypriot President Glafkos Clerides has
termed such demands unacceptable. British representatives
at the Geneva talks have tried to get the two sides to
compromise, without much success.
Meanwhile, on the island itself, fighting erupted
yesterday after three days of relative peace. While there
was little information on the fighting, observers said
Turkish invaders and Greek Cypriot national guardsmen
exchanged rifle and mortar fire.
Argentine Troops Kill Guerillas
BUENOS AIRES — The Argentine government
reported yesterday that its troops killed 15 Marxist
guerrillas in an attack on one of their hideouts.
The military has been combing several provinces in
search of members of the People's Revolutionary Army.
Guerrilla activity has been reported on the rise. On
Sunday, five persons were killed in guerrilla attacks in
Cordoba and Catamarca provinces. A total of 26 persons
have died in the last two days.
Yesterday's battle lasted six hours at a hideout in a
ravine northwest of Buenos Aires. Accounts said that none
of the guerrillas survived.
Nixon, Aides Handle Paper Work
SAN CLEMENTE — Former President Richard M.
Nixon spent yesterday with aides discussing how to handle
an enormous amount of paper work.
Nixon, residing at the former Western White House in
San Clemente, has been working with three top aides;
Ronald Ziegler, Stephen Bull and Col. Jack Brennan.
Over the weekend, Nixon spent time with his family
and with friends Charles "Bebe" Rebozo and Robert
Abplanalp. Abplanalp said "he seemed fine; he is not at all
upset."
Meanwhile, it seems as if the Senate, though not
wanting Nixon to be prosecuted for any crimes committed
while he was President, was reluctant to pass any measure
to that effect.
Sen. Edward Brooke, R—Mass., has proposed an
"immunity resolution" that would recommend
prosecutors not bring charges against Nixon.

Leaders of both parties indicated, however, that the
proposed resolution would not pass. "This is none of our
business," Sen.Norris Cotton, leader of the Senate G.O.P.
conference, said.
Ford Gathers Advice For V.P.
WASHINGTON — President Gerald Ford is getting a lot
of advice from Republicans across the nation on who to
name as his vice president.
Today, House minority leader John Rhodes, R—Ariz,
was expected to take sealed envelopes to the new
President bearing the names of candidates for the job
suggested by House leaders of both parties.
Yesterday, the conservative United Republicans of
California recommended Rep. John Ashbrook, R—Ohio,
for the job.
The Northeast Republicans Chairmen's Association,
meanwhile, endorsed former New York Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller, listing party chairman George Bush as a
second choice.
The Daily learned last night from a
Stanford-in-Washington source that former Atty. Gen.
Elliot Richardson is considered a likely choice.
L.A. Bus Strike Jams Traffic
LOS ANGELES — Traffic jams in Los Angeles were
reported even worse than usual yesterday as a result of a
bus strike.
The strike of over 3000 drivers and 700 mechanics shut
down the city's 2000-bus fleet yesterday. About 650,000
commuters in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties were affected.
While a Los Angeles police spokesman said the traffic
was not unmanageable, traffic was backed up over 12
miles on one freeway yesterday morning, and similar jams
were reported at night, with the San Bernardino freeway
most seriously affected.
No further talks are scheduled between the United
Transportation Union and the Southern California Rapid
Transit District.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except for low clouds late night
and mornings. Highs today in the 70s to low 80s, low
tonight in the 50s.
Ford's Priority: Stopping Inflation
WASHINGTON — President Gerald Ford told the
nation last night that stopping inflation would be the first
priority of his administration.
In a nationally broadcast speech made before a joint
session of Congress, the new President indicated he would
act strongly to stop the government from spending too
much money.
Ford said he favors reestablishing the cost of living
council to expose abuses, but not to impose controls.
Ford said "it does no good to blame the public for
spending too much when the government is spending too
much." While he obliquely threatened to veto inflationary
bills, he warned against "unwarranted cuts in the national
defense."
In a speech frequently punctuated by levity, Ford said
he would be President of all Americans — "women
feminists and male chauvinists alike."
Ford also promised that "there will be no illegal
tapings, eavesdroppings, buggings or break-ins in my
administration."
Nearly all reaction to Ford's speech was favorable.
Former President Richard Nixon sent a telegram to his
successor praising him for his "splendid speech."
Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield, D—Mont., said
he "was impressed," while his G.O.P. counterpart, Hugh
Scott, said the speech was "a real bellringer."
Sen. Barry Goldwater, R—Ariz., said the speech was
"just what the country needs." Goldwater said he
