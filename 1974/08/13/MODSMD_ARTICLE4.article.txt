# 'Dial-A-Bus' Scheduled For Campus
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN DON COX 
The Santa Clara County Transit District
will institute "demand response" bus service
to certain campus locations beginning in the
fall, Vice President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsburger said yesterday.
Augsburger said county buses will offer
taxi-like service in fixed areas at near-regular
bus fares. Faculty and staff housing areas like
Frenchman's Hill and San Juan Hill are
covered by the plan, University Master
Planner Oscar Nelson explained.
The closest the service comes to student
residential areas will probably be the
interjection of Campus Drive and Bowdoin
Street, Augsburger said.
Persons desiring bus service will be able to
call a central phone number and buses will be
dispatched to the stop nearest their location
within a few minutes, according to the
county's plan.
Gas Tax Revenues
The county, rather than the University or
the city of Palo Alto, will finance the project

out of gas tax revenue, Augsburger said,
adding, "whether it proves to be economical
remains to be seen."
Santa Clara County officials have
announced a "dial-a-bus" service in
advertisements in recent months, but have
made no specific mention of the campus.
Officials were unavailable for comment.
The service "clearly does not exclude
students though it is not as convenient as it
might be," Augsburger remarked.
University officials have expressed
displeasure with the lack of service to student
areas and are working to increase the bus
coverage.
Campus Ring
"The bus service we find we need, in
terms of Stanford students is one that rings
campus and hits the residential areas," said
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer.
Mayer termed the new plan "unresponsive
to what students are interested in." The
existing bus service is "inadequate" and a
proposed free service from the campus into
Palo Alto is only "marginally" better,

according to Mayer.
That free service, to be underwritten
jointly by the University and the city, came
up at the most recent meeting of the Palo
Alto-Stanford liaison committee last month
and was tabled.
Augsburger explained that the committee
"decided to wait and see what the results of
the other service were."
Fall Survey
Mayer indicated that the ASSU will take a
survey of student demand for bus service this
fall.
Last spring, University Transportation
Coordinator Ned Gallagher approved a
preliminary recommendation to open a
campus bus link with Palo Alto featuring a
ring around Campus Drive. However, the
proposal was not included then in a list of
comments on bus stop locations to Santa
Clara transit officials.
The decision to exclude the additional
campus stops came from Nelson who
explained in an April memo that the proposal
"may have a degree of discussion
value and should be investigated."
Nelson said last night that his
office was not "negative" on the
ring plan, but added that he
wished to see a market survey
before instituting and paying for
the service.
He suggested that students may
only need "specialized transit" —
like charter service to the airport
at the end of each quarter —
rather than an everyday route.
Mayer and others however have
stressed students' daily need to
travel into Palo Alto, noting that
students who could use the bus
now must rely on friends with
cars, on taxicabs on their bikes or
on walking.
