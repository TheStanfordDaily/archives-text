## Nixon Amnesty? 
### 
"Our national nightmare is over" and the Congress and the
President have been quick to wash their hands of the whole, sordid
Watergate affair.
Congress has sheathed the impeachment sword, after reluctantly
drawing and brandishing the king-killer.
But has Congress washed that damn spot out? Is the nightmare
really over? Aside from the many Watergate-related trials and appeals
still on the judicial docket, top legal authorities there
remains an airtight case against Richard Nixon for various criminal
acts.
By his own admission, Nixon is deeply involved in a conspiracy to
obstruct justice as the July 23, 1972 tape confirms. Former Nixon
Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman could go to jail because of that taped
conversation. What about Nixon?
It is obviously somewhat repugnant on aesthetic grounds to
prosecute a former President. Certainly, one can say Nixon's
resignation is the system's pound of flesh. But what of the other
Watergate figures now under indictment or serving time in jail? There
has been no official or unofficial amnesty for them. Nor has there
been any for Vietnam draft dodgers. Painful as it may be, everyone
must be totally liable under the law.
We have no vindictive desire to see former President Nixon in jail.
The objective is not to get Nixon behind bars, but to ensure the equal
application of justice as the Constitution directs.
This country has been quick to pat itself on the back in the last
few days for having a Constitution that really works. And yet we
should realize that we were lucky. Had it not been for Nixon's
historical ego, we would not have had the tapes that forced his ouster.
We would still be wallowing in Watergate.
Nixon has not admitted any wrong-doing and many facets of the
case still lie buried. Only when the full extent of the corruption in
Washington reaches the public, will Congress face the sobering task of
passing the needed legislation to prevent a reoccurrence.
Only then will that damn spot finally come out.
