# Avoid Cynicism

The banal and decadent aspects
of American life described in Mr.
McCasland's "Smoggy Memories"
(Daily August 6) need not infect
us all. With a little conscious
effort his warmed-over,
Caulfieldesque, resigned apathetic
cynicism can be avoided. Actually
I'm surprised anyone would want
to admit that he drove customized
cars to fast food outlets and
listened to teenybop radio
stations while daydreaming of
dope and beer, let alone deem
such acts penworthy.
The standard "ride a bike,"
"you are what you eat," "noise
pollutes," and "natural high"
rebukes to these American "vices"
are second in their triteness only
to Mr. McCasland's cute,
parenthetical observations and
"God,' I thought . .phrases.
If, for instance, Mr. McCasland
had eschewn his trip to "the A"
and let a bikeride around campus
ease his restlessness that evening,
he needn't have felt any
responsibility for the "acierative
translucency of nitric oxide" that
was then transmutating the sun's
rays. He would have also seen it
set behind Skyline's blue ridge
instead of the Cameo Club's false
front and neon signs.
It's possible he might have even
found all the herbs and barks
necessary to brew his own cup of
root beer, if he knew what to look
for (one part sarsaparillia, one
part wintergreen, one part
spikenard, and one part ginger,
fermented with sugar and yeast).
If not, he surely would have
found the soft hoo-hooing of the
great horned owls that live in the
eucalyptus grove across from the
stadium soothing to his nerves.
They also look very beautiful in
flight and are scared into hiding

only when dust is kicked up by
folks "running" their dogs from
the front seats of their cars.
What a summer this will have
been for Mr. McCasland, if he fails
to appreciate, or at least
acknowledge, the scent of the
parched foothill grasses damp
with the dew of an August
evening. Perhaps the night
blooming jasmine (Cestrum
parqui) is more to his liking. Take
a deep breath ... easily as sweet
as Cannabis sativa, no?
It's true that America must
breath the air of its ways, as Mr.
McCasland points out. That air
will take on elements of beauty
only when the country's
individual members begin to
beautify their own lives.
