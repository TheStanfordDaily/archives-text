# Byzantine Gifts Ignored

Stanford University is the only
university in the U.S.A. which is a
living tribute to the great
Byzantine or Greek Orthodox
period of the early Christian
Orthodox Church, which survived
without interruptions until 1452.
Its domain was the whole eastern
territory and it was the basis of
the later Roman-Catholic
Christianity. This period of Greek
Orthodoxy was responsible for
the foundations of Christianity in
the countries north of Greece,
namely in Serbo-Croatia and
possibly Poland and Russia, as
well as for the foundation of the
Russian alphabet.
This great culture of
Orthodoxy, established during the
early years after Christ, in many
respects surpasses the Golden Era
of Pericles at about 500 B.C. Very
few studies of the Byzantine Era
of almost 15 centuries have been
seriously pursued by English
intellectuals. A larger number is to
be found among the French and
practically none among the
German or the Russian modern
intellectuals.
The formal Greek language

during these 15 centuries was that
of the New Testament, which is
the language used by the Greek
historians between 300 and 0 B.C.
This language, which is a correct
but similar version of the
Homeric Greek language also
profoundly influenced the
classical Latin language at about
10 B.C.
The ancient Greeks consisted
of various northern tribes or
nomads, while the island natives
were the Aeoleis who were blond.
Various regions in Greece
developed cultural ways of life
and expressions of extremely high
quality and intellectual virtues.
Moral Life
However, the Byzantine
Christian period of 15 centuries
brought a unity peace and moral
life not previously enjoyed by the
Greek people of the centuries
before Christ, even though the
cultural center had shifted its
place from Athens to
Constantinoupolis.
The greatest accomplishments
of this Christian Period for the
people of Greece were the unity
and lack of wars they enjoyed as
well as the flourishing of the arts
as shown in the mosaics, paintings
and church music, and the
flourishing of the trade.
Unfortunately most of the art
monuments of this Christian
period were devastated during the
Greek slavery under the Ottoman
empire which lasted for almost
400 years, from 1452 until 1821.
After the downfall of the
Byzantine empire, a great number
of Greek intellectuals migrated to
the west, specifically to Italy,
where they were the founders of
Greek-Roman Medicine and the
fine arts of the Renaissance.
Differences
In my judgment as a scholar,
the cause of the war by the
Ottomans or Turks is to be found
in the paramount differences
between the peaceful flourishing
and highly moral life of the
Byzantine Greeks and the
uncivilized immoral life in Turkey

at that time characterized by
harems, hashish, kidnapings of
the Greek children. The Turks
raised children according to their
cruel ways and then let them
loose to destroy their parents and
every moral cultural Christian
asset.
This was the primary method
that the Turks had used during
the 400 years of their barbaric
occupation of Greece to destroy
the Greeks, and their noblest
accomplishments in the Christian
family life and in the sciences and
arts.
It was only in the beginning of
this century that internal
government improvements were
made within Turkey to ensure the
peace with its neighbors, and we,
the modern Greek generation,
learned to love the entertaining
puppet shows in Greece depicting
the Turkish people's sense of
humor.
Unfortunately, unpleasant as it
may sound, during my 26 years in
this country my Christian cultural
and scholarly background were
not appreciated by the citizens
and families I came to know as a
wife, scientist and mother of three
sons. My young family and I have
been hit by divorce, and a hatred
unprecedented in my experience
even of the second World War
years.
Because even under the
German and the Italian
occupation of Greece the children
were not abducted from our
homes. They were allowed to be
taught the moral principles of the
Old and New Testament,
principles which my children are
taught to ridicule and spit at as
not promoting money making and
so-called independence. This may
be to a large extent a reflection of
the quality of adult family
teaching and immoral practices in
their present home arrangement,
which I hope and pray will soon
be changed.

the later Roman-Catholic
Christianity. This period of Greek
Orthodoxy was responsible for
the foundations of Christianity in
the countries north of Greece,
namely in Serbo-Croatia and
possibly Poland and Russia, as
well as for the foundation of the
Russian alphabet.
This great culture of
Orthodoxy, established during the
early years after Christ, in many
respects surpasses the Golden Era
of Pericles at about 500 B.C. Very
few studies of the Byzantine Era
of almost 15 centuries have been
seriously pursued by English
intellectuals. A larger number is to
be found among the French and
practically none among the
German or the Russian modern
intellectuals.
The formal Greek language

during these 15 centuries was that
of the New Testament, which is
the language used by the Greek
historians between 300 and 0 B.C.
This language, which is a correct
but similar version of the
Homeric Greek language also
profoundly influenced the
classical Latin language at about
10 B.C.
The ancient Greeks consisted
of various northern tribes or
nomads, while the island natives
were the Aeoleis who were blond.
Various regions in Greece
developed cultural ways of life
and expressions of extremely high
quality and intellectual virtues.
Moral Life
However, the Byzantine
Christian period of 15 centuries
brought a unity peace and moral
life not previously enjoyed by the
Greek people of the centuries
before Christ, even though the
cultural center had shifted its
place from Athens to
Constantinoupolis.
The greatest accomplishments
of this Christian Period for the
people of Greece were the unity
and lack of wars they enjoyed as
well as the flourishing of the arts
as shown in the mosaics, paintings
and church music, and the
flourishing of the trade.
Unfortunately most of the art
monuments of this Christian
period were devastated during the
Greek slavery under the Ottoman
empire which lasted for almost
400 years, from 1452 until 1821.
After the downfall of the
Byzantine empire, a great number
of Greek intellectuals migrated to
the west, specifically to Italy,
where they were the founders of
Greek-Roman Medicine and the
fine arts of the Renaissance.
Differences
In my judgment as a scholar,
the cause of the war by the
Ottomans or Turks is to be found
in the paramount differences
between the peaceful flourishing
and highly moral life of the
Byzantine Greeks and the
uncivilized immoral life in Turkey

at that time characterized by
harems, hashish, kidnapings of
the Greek children. The Turks
raised children according to their
cruel ways and then let them
loose to destroy their parents and
every moral cultural Christian
asset.
This was the primary method
that the Turks had used during
the 400 years of their barbaric
occupation of Greece to destroy
the Greeks, and their noblest
accomplishments in the Christian
family life and in the sciences and
arts.
It was only in the beginning of
this century that internal
government improvements were
made within Turkey to ensure the
peace with its neighbors, and we,
the modern Greek generation,
learned to love the entertaining
puppet shows in Greece depicting
the Turkish people's sense of
humor.
Unfortunately, unpleasant as it
may sound, during my 26 years in
this country my Christian cultural
and scholarly background were
not appreciated by the citizens
and families I came to know as a
wife, scientist and mother of three
sons. My young family and I have
been hit by divorce, and a hatred
unprecedented in my experience
even of the second World War
years.
Because even under the
German and the Italian
occupation of Greece the children
were not abducted from our
homes. They were allowed to be
taught the moral principles of the
Old and New Testament,
principles which my children are
taught to ridicule and spit at as
not promoting money making and
so-called independence. This may
be to a large extent a reflection of
the quality of adult family
teaching and immoral practices in
their present home arrangement,
which I hope and pray will soon
be changed.
