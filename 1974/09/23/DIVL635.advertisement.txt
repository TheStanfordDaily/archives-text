For a dollar a month, you can have a student checking
account at Wells Fargo Bank. There's no minimum balance re
quired, and you can write as many checks as you want.
You'll get a statement every month. And if you decide
not to write checks over the summer, there's no monthly service
charge at all. We'll still keep your account open, even if there's
no money in it, until you return to school in the Fall.
We also have a special Master Charge credit plan for stu
dents. It provides extra money when you need it —and a good way
to build credit standing.
