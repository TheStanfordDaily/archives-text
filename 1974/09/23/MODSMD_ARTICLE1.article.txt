# Housing Study Released
## Three Row Houses Planned 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The University has disclosed plans
to build three new row houses as the
first stage of a proposed long-range
undergraduate housing project.
If approved by the Board of
Trustees, the houses will be built on
Mayfield Avenue across from the Beta
Theta Pi House. Each will cost about
$1.2 million, and will accomodate 50
students.
The long-term project calls for
construction of a total of 850 student
housing spaces, costing $25 million,
over the next seven to 10 years.
Entitled "Undergraduate Student
Housing Needs at Stanford,
1974-1984," the extensive report
envisions "a cluster or pattern of 10 to
14 houses of 50 to 70 students each"
as the second and final stage in the
project.
The second stage residences would
have a common kitchen and dining
area, and would be built just off Santa
Teresa Street between Lagunita Court
and Los Arboles Avenue.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs

Larry N. Horton, an author of the
study has indicated that although
approval isn't certain, "the Housing
Office is proceeding as if it were ready
to go." The trustees are expected to
consider the report at their October
meeting.
Horton is optimistic that the
trustees will approve stage one
construction, but is uncertain whether
the buildings will be completed by
September 1976. "We'll hpve to run a
four-minute mile to meet that date,"
he said, "though our current pace is
much slower."
Horton has been less than
optimistic lately about the success of
stage two, mostly because the
economy's effect on contributions to
the University.
Summer Recommendations
A committee of students and
administrators met during the summer
to make recommendations about the
construction of the new houses.
Horton has asked the committee to
suggest the amount of space desireable
for casual conversation, the best type

of kitchen facilities and the number of
feet of books the average student has,
among other things.
Horton said last week that the
architectual firm of Bull, Field,
Volkmann and Stockwell has been
chosen to draw plans for the proposed
houses.
