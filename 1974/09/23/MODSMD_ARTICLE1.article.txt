# Housing Study Released
## Three Row Houses Planned 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The University has disclosed plans
to build three new row houses as the
first stage of a proposed long-range
undergraduate housing project.
If approved by the Board of
Trustees, the houses will be built on
Mayfield Avenue across from the Beta
Theta Pi House. Each will cost about
$1.2 million, and will accomodate 50
students.
The long-term project calls for
construction of a total of 850 student
housing spaces, costing $25 million,
over the next seven to 10 years.
Entitled "Undergraduate Student
Housing Needs at Stanford,
1974-1984," the extensive report
envisions "a cluster or pattern of 10 to
14 houses of 50 to 70 students each"
as the second and final stage in the
project.
The second stage residences would
have a common kitchen and dining
area, and would be built just off Santa
Teresa Street between Lagunita Court
and Los Arboles Avenue.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs

Larry N. Horton, an author of the
study has indicated that although
approval isn't certain, "the Housing
Office is proceeding as if it were ready
to go." The trustees are expected to
consider the report at their October
meeting.
Horton is optimistic that the
trustees will approve stage one
construction, but is uncertain whether
the buildings will be completed by
September 1976. "We'll hpve to run a
four-minute mile to meet that date,"
he said, "though our current pace is
much slower."
Horton has been less than
optimistic lately about the success of
stage two, mostly because the
economy's effect on contributions to
the University.
Summer Recommendations
A committee of students and
administrators met during the summer
to make recommendations about the
construction of the new houses.
Horton has asked the committee to
suggest the amount of space desireable
for casual conversation, the best type

of kitchen facilities and the number of
feet of books the average student has,
among other things.
Horton said last week that the
architectual firm of Bull, Field,
Volkmann and Stockwell has been
chosen to draw plans for the proposed
houses.

account "a current undergraduate
housing demand of 390 incremental
units" and replacement of 460 spaces
of Man/.anita Park, which the report
said should be replaced "as soon as it
becomes financially feasible."
The new units will be financed by
gifts, loans and higher room and board
rates. The exact amount of rate
increases depends on whether the
University is able to attain optimal or
minimal financing.
About $4.5 million in gifts
accompanied by $20.5 million in
commercial loans would be necessary
to complete the project, the report
states. Such minimal financing would
necessitate average rate increases of
8.6 percent over the next ten years,
the report said.
Optimal financing consists of $8.5
million in gifts and $16.5 million of
California Educational Facilities
Authority (CEFA) loans.
The CEFA loan terms are estimated
to be 30 years at 5 3/4 percent interest
compared to commercial loans with
terms of 25 years at eight percent,
according to the report.
The University currently has a gift
of $750,000 by Robert S. Moore,
donated in 1961, which will be worth
$1.5 million with interest by
mid-1975, the report notes.
Though the Campaign for Stanford
includes a $3 million goal "for a
variety of residence purposes"
apparently "no funds have been raised

toward this target because it has low
priority," the study states.
If the project is approved and
begun as expected, room and board
rates will be affected beginning
1975-1976. This year, students living
in a dormitory and taking a full meal
plan will pay $1535.
Under steady state increases
projected in the study, room and
board next year would be $1635 and
would continue to increase over the
next ten years at an average of 6.4
percent.
Under the steady-state plan of the
report, students would be paying
$3010 for room and board by
1985-1986, and increase of almost 100
percent. This assumes inflationary
factors will remain fairly stable.
With optimal financing, students
will be paying $3395 in 11 years or
$3566 if minimal financing is
obtained.

million in gifts and $16.5 million of
California Educational Facilities
Authority (CEFA) loans.
The CEFA loan terms are estimated
to be 30 years at 5 3/4 percent interest
compared to commercial loans with
terms of 25 years at eight percent,
according to the report.
The University currently has a gift
of $750,000 by Robert S. Moore,
donated in 1961, which will be worth
$1.5 million with interest by
mid-1975, the report notes.
Though the Campaign for Stanford
includes a $3 million goal "for a
variety of residence purposes"
apparently "no funds have been raised

toward this target because it has low
priority," the study states.
If the project is approved and
begun as expected, room and board
rates will be affected beginning
1975-1976. This year, students living
in a dormitory and taking a full meal
plan will pay $1535.
Under steady state increases
projected in the study, room and
board next year would be $1635 and
would continue to increase over the
next ten years at an average of 6.4
percent.
Under the steady-state plan of the
report, students would be paying
$3010 for room and board by
1985-1986, and increase of almost 100
percent. This assumes inflationary
factors will remain fairly stable.
With optimal financing, students
will be paying $3395 in 11 years or
$3566 if minimal financing is
obtained.
The University has disclosed plans
to build three new row houses as the
first stage of a proposed long-range
undergraduate housing project.
If approved by the Board of
Trustees, the houses will be built on
Mayfield Avenue across from the Beta
Theta Pi House. Each will cost about
$1.2 million, and will accomodate 50
students.
The long-term project calls for
construction of a total of 850 student
housing spaces, costing $25 million,
over the next seven to 10 years.
Entitled "Undergraduate Student
Housing Needs at Stanford,
1974-1984," the extensive report
envisions "a cluster or pattern of 10 to
14 houses of 50 to 70 students each"
as the second and final stage in the
project.
The second stage residences would
have a common kitchen and dining
area, and would be built just off Santa
Teresa Street between Lagunita Court
and Los Arboles Avenue.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs

Larry N. Horton, an author of the
study has indicated that although
approval isn't certain, "the Housing
Office is proceeding as if it were ready
to go." The trustees are expected to
consider the report at their October
meeting.
Horton is optimistic that the
trustees will approve stage one
construction, but is uncertain whether
the buildings will be completed by
September 1976. "We'll hpve to run a
four-minute mile to meet that date,"
he said, "though our current pace is
much slower."
Horton has been less than
optimistic lately about the success of
stage two, mostly because the
economy's effect on contributions to
the University.
Summer Recommendations
A committee of students and
administrators met during the summer
to make recommendations about the
construction of the new houses.
Horton has asked the committee to
suggest the amount of space desireable
for casual conversation, the best type

of kitchen facilities and the number of
feet of books the average student has,
among other things.
Horton said last week that the
architectual firm of Bull, Field,
Volkmann and Stockwell has been
chosen to draw plans for the proposed
houses.

housing demand of 390 incremental
units" and replacement of 460 spaces
of Man/.anita Park, which the report
said should be replaced "as soon as it
becomes financially feasible."
The new units will be financed by
gifts, loans and higher room and board
rates. The exact amount of rate
increases depends on whether the
University is able to attain optimal or
minimal financing.
About $4.5 million in gifts

commercial loans would be necessary
to complete the project, the report
states. Such minimal financing would

8.6 percent over the next ten years,

Summer Recommendations
A committee of students and
administrators met during the summer
to make recommendations about the
construction of the new houses.
Horton has asked the committee to
suggest the amount of space desireable
for casual conversation, the best type

of kitchen facilities and the number of
feet of books the average student has,
among other things.
Horton said last week that the
architectual firm of Bull, Field,
Volkmann and Stockwell has been
chosen to draw plans for the proposed
houses.
The 850 planned spaces take into

account "a current undergraduate
housing demand of 390 incremental
units" and replacement of 460 spaces
of Man/.anita Park, which the report
said should be replaced "as soon as it
becomes financially feasible."
The new units will be financed by
gifts, loans and higher room and board
rates. The exact amount of rate
increases depends on whether the
University is able to attain optimal or
minimal financing.
About $4.5 million in gifts
accompanied by $20.5 million in
commercial loans would be necessary
to complete the project, the report
states. Such minimal financing would
necessitate average rate increases of
8.6 percent over the next ten years,
the report said.
Optimal financing consists of $8.5
million in gifts and $16.5 million of
California Educational Facilities
Authority (CEFA) loans.
The CEFA loan terms are estimated
to be 30 years at 5 3/4 percent interest
compared to commercial loans with
terms of 25 years at eight percent,
according to the report.
The University currently has a gift
of $750,000 by Robert S. Moore,
donated in 1961, which will be worth
$1.5 million with interest by
mid-1975, the report notes.
Though the Campaign for Stanford
includes a $3 million goal "for a
variety of residence purposes"
apparently "no funds have been raised

toward this target because it has low
priority," the study states.
If the project is approved and
begun as expected, room and board
rates will be affected beginning
1975-1976. This year, students living
in a dormitory and taking a full meal
plan will pay $1535.
Under steady state increases
projected in the study, room and
board next year would be $1635 and
would continue to increase over the
next ten years at an average of 6.4
percent.
Under the steady-state plan of the
report, students would be paying
$3010 for room and board by
1985-1986, and increase of almost 100
percent. This assumes inflationary
factors will remain fairly stable.
With optimal financing, students
will be paying $3395 in 11 years or
$3566 if minimal financing is
obtained.
