# Nixon's Pardon And His Inner Hell
##

Rich Joroslovsky

Please excuse me if I continue to wallow
in Watergate a while longer. 1 have a
fascination with the scandal something like a
moth's with a flame, and just when it seems
as if there's nothing more that can possibly
be of interest or concern, something new
comes along: secret funds, 18'/2-minute
buzzes, or whatever. What has my attention
right now is the latest go-around on the
Presidential pardon and Mr. Nixon's illness.
Now since I'm writing this last
Wednesday, things might have already
changed a bit. At this point, though, Dr.
Walter Tkach has just told Mrs. Nixon about
Mr. Nixon's problems through the pages of
Newsweek, while Julie says Mr. Nixon will be
going into the hospital soon but is really
much better, and denies reports that Mr.
Nixon is extremely ill and generally losing his
grip, which is supposedly what made
President Ford turn around and grant Mr.
Nixon a pardon so soon after he said it would
be unwise and untimely to do so, while
before he just said the country would never
stand for it, in which the public opinion polls
showed him correct. Understand?
Anyway, for all that, a few things are
clear: Mr. Nixon is off scot free, and unless
he perjures himself at the trial of his former
aides, he'll never go to jail for Watergate. In
fact, it appears that he is now setting the
stage to try to avoid appearing in court at all.

for medical reasons; only time and Judge
Sirica will tell whether or not he is successful.
Nixon 'Already Broken'
Be that as it may, I honestly can't work
myself into a rage over the Nixon pardon.
Mind you, I don't particularly care for the
manner in which it was handled, and I
certainly maintain membership in good
standing with Nixon Loathers of America.
But the fact is that I have no heart to see him
tossed in jail when it's abundantly clear that
he is already a broken man.
What Richard Nixon did to this country is
still hard to comprehend, and may not be
fully understood for generations.
In just five years, Nixon was able to
politicize the federal apparatus more than the
Democrats did in almost 30. And worst of
all, Richard Nixon used the respect of the
American people for their presidency as just
another bargaining chip in his struggle to
retain office, in the process shaking, and
perhaps irreparably damaging, our confidence
in ourselves and our institutions.
Punishment Unnecessary
No doubt about it, while in office Richard
Nixon was a threat to all of us. And getting
him out of office was of paramount national
concern. But now that he is out, we don't
need to lift a finger to see him punished.
Events have taken care of that.
For Nixon, the emoluments of high office

were as important, if not more important,
than the exercise of the powers of that
office. Stop and think for a moment â€” did
Richard Nixon really extend the parameters
of the Presidency, as did Lincoln or
Roosevelt? What Nixon did was to use the
existing powers in a criminal manner, but he
didn't forge precedents for future presidents
(for which we thank God).
No, what Nixon sought were the trappings
of power: the houses, the honors, the general
saintliness conferred upon the nation's
highest official by the populace. By now, he
must realize that they will never be his. The
people who twice elected him now revile
him. In the history books, he'll be listed
along with Grant and Harding as among our
worst presidents. There won't be any Nixon
Airports or Nixon High Schools.
For Richard Nixon, those are the cruelest
blows of all.
Phlebitis or no, what Richard Nixon is
really suffering from right now is an acute
attack of recognition that all he lusted for is
no longer his and never will be. That is
Richard Nixon's own private, personal little
hell. And when he has to live with that for
the rest of his life, why, keeping him out of
jail seems a small act of humanity indeed.
