# Amnesty, Clemency And Pardons
## 
### 
Robert McAfee Brown

President Ford has recently
made a number of attempts to
"heal the nation's wounds." After
the searing experiences of
Vietnam and Watergate this is an
admirable intention, but Ford's
hasty efforts have had, and will
continue to have, exactly the
opposite effect.
Ford's semantics, as well as his
intentions, have gotten
sidetracked in the process. He told
us some weeks ago that he was
preparing an amnesty proposal for
draft resisters and military
deserters. "Amnesty" means
forgetting, not forgiving;
supporters of amnesty have
argued that we should "forget"
the acts of those who refused to
serve in what they considered an
immoral war, thus putting the
Vietnam experience behind us and
beginning to build creatively for
the future.
Ford did engage in a recent act
of amnesty, only he directed it
not to war resisters but to the
ex-president, and he called it a
"pardon." He gave Mr. Nixon the
equivalent of unconditional
amnesty, a "full, free and
absolute" pardon, on the grounds
that we should put Watergate
behind us and forget it.
The result, of course, has been
exactly the opposite: Watergate is
now with us more than ever, and
the task of determining what
really happened and seeing to it
that justice is done has been
rendered almost impossible by the
President's action.
'Clemency' A Misnomer
A few days later, Ford's
promised amnesty for war
protesters were announced, but it
was now defined not as an act of
amnesty, but of "clemency," i.e.,
dealing mercifully with those
toward whom it was directed. But
this, too, is a misnomer, for by no
stretch of the imagination can
Ford's proposals be called
merciful.
The declaration is a cruel blow
to all young men of conscience
who chose exile or prison rather
than fight in an immoral war. The
conditions Ford offers them for a
safe return to society are harsh;
and the assumption behind the
conditions is that these young
men are a deep threat to our
society until they have paid
heavily for acting as they did out
of deep moral necessity.
Consider their situation; here
are men of conscience who have
risked life-long exile or lengthy
prison sentences because in

conscience they would not kill
Vietnamese and Laotians and
Cambodians in a war they felt to
be immoral or illegal or both.
Having already paid heavily for
these convictions, they are now
told that they must "surrender,"
take a new oath of allegiance, in
many cases serve an additional 24
months to prove that allegiance,
sign away many of their
constitutional privileges and retain
for the rest of their lives various
stigmata for their act of
conscience.
'Vindictive Action'
This is not amnesty
(forgetting), it is not clemency
(dealing mercifully), and it is not
pardon (allowing an offense to
pass without punishment). It is
rather a retributive and vindictive
action that instead of healing the
nation's wounds can only lacerate
them further.
Coming hard on the heels of
the Nixon pardon, it demonstrates
once again that there are two

systems of justice in our nation â€”
one for the powerful, another for
the powerless. If you are powerful
enough and have the right
connections, you can obstruct
justice and subvert the
constitution, and still receive a
full pardon and half a million
dollars. If you are powerless and
do not have the right connections,
and try to act out of conscience
to recall your nation from
monstrous national and
internatinal folly, your lot will be
prison, exile and release under
punitive conditions.
What would have been an
appropriate response to the war
resisters? It seems to me that it
would have acknowledged that if
anybody needs "forgiveness" it is
not those who resisted an immoral
war but those who forced
thousands of young men into
prison or exile by demanding that
they fight in it, and brought about
the deaths of 50,000 Americans
and hundreds of thousands of

southeast Asians who did fight in
it.
Such a response would have
acknowledged that the "crime" of
the resisters was simply that they
were prematurely right about the
wrongness of the war, acting as
the earliest flowing of our
national conscience about
Vietnam; and therefore it would
have acknowledged that instead of
punishing such young men we
should have welcomed them back
unconditionally, saying to them,
"We need your insight at home so
that we can listen to you more
carefully and avoid another
Vietnam abroad."
So the initial question of
amnesty has not been resolved by
Ford's action. It has barely been
surfaced, and we shall have to
continue to work for more
appropriate responses to the
costly moral witness of our young
men of conscience.
