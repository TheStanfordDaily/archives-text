# One Serra Street Morning

Each day before sallying forth
into the world of broken glass,
bent nails and thorns, I choose an
innertube to be destroyed. My
thumbs are shredded from
coercing tires off of and on to
rims, and I have run out of nasty
things to call the bike. In short, I
am an irresistible magnet for all
things that rip, tear and slash,
puncture, penetrate, gouge and
maim. Daisies grow spikes as I
approach.
Now the ordinary possessor of
this rather unique attribute may
manifest it in many degrees. The
amateur gets a slow leak a block
from home in the evening. The
expert wipes out totally in the hot
afternoon a respectable distance
from the gas station that will be
closed upon arrival. But the true
sign of the chosen is
unmistakable: Only the rear tire
gets it.
As all you ten speed maniacs
know and as the rest of you are
about to find out, getting that
rear wheel off is a task that would
give Gautama Buddha ulcers. Also
grease and road crud from the
finger tips to the elbow. That
chain and wheel just are not made
to come off without a struggle.

Which, of course, is good
preparation for getting the
!t+s%/&* tire off the rim. I have
two pliers and a spare pair of
thumbs for that one. Dented rims
from falling into the trenches,
furrows and bottomless pits on
Serra Street make it no easier.
Now, The Tube
Now I view the tube. A
thornproof tube. A heavy butyl
rubber tube. A mother loving toad
sucking hole harboring thornproof
heavy butyl rubber tube.
Some $3.49 plus tax later the
new thornproof heavy butyl
rubber torus is in place.
AND VM OFF, ripping past
pedestrians, dipping low around
corners, screaming madly as I
court death going downhill at
1000 mph with a flat rear wheel.
Okay guys, now I know that
the University has priorities and I
realize that giving water beds to
chimps and putting that $60 per
square foot deep plush pile
carpeting in a certain somebody's
office is important, but just once
every 50 years you might, if time
permits, fill in the holes and
trenches on the most heavily
student-trafficked street on
campus, Serra Street.

Would it break the budget if a
street sweeper made the rounds
once a month removing the
broken glass and other debris so
casually tossed out of limousine
windows and other sources? After
all, there aren't more than a
thousand or two bicycles on
campus, are there?
