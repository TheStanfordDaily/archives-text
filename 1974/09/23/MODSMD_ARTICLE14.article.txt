As the Stanford University
community once again begins its
pursuit of academic, athletic and
social ends, it is perhaps well to
review, at this early stage, some of
the areas in which the general
student body expressed most
discontent with the status quo at
Stanford at the conclusion of the
last academic year, with the
ultimate hope that we may be
able to find some measure of
solution to these areas. At the risk
of boring the newspaper-reading
breakfast crowd, allow me to
enumerate what I perceive some
of those areas to be:
Housing—At the conclusion of
the housing draw held last Spring,
a large sector of the student
population involuntarily was left
without assignment to a
University residence.
A report prepared by three
members of the administration
and released during the summer
recommended the immediate
construction of three Row houses
accommodating approximately
50 persons each to be
completed by September of 1976,
as well as the construction of 850
housing spaces for undergraduates
in the next seven to 10 years.
Yet, if there were one general
problem that most affected
students and about which the
Dean of Student Affairs receives
the most complaints, it would be
that of housing.
Advising—ln particular, for the
freshman, the transfer, or the
general studies student, the
advising situation at Stanford can
be inconsistent, and often
damagingly disappointing. This is
more of a personal or human
problem than it is an institutional
one.
Areas of concern here are the
manner of selecting an advisor,
the general lack of incentive on
the advisor's part, the exaggerated
expectations students bring to the
system, the possible lack of
consideration in referral for
specific problems and the lack of
alternative methods for the
acquisition of advice.
Child Care—Although this
situation affects very few
undergraduate students, to those
students, faculty members and
administrators who are also
parents of pre-school children,
child care remains a serious
concern. At present, despite the
noticeable assistance of the Office
of the Dean of Students and the
general approval of the University
governance, inadequacies continue
in areas of daytime care, facilities
for children of six years and older,
care for sick children,
transportation to and from
existing facilities and prohibitively
excessive fees.
Campus Judicial System—Since
1971, all student judicial
proceedings on the Stanford
campus have ostensibly fallen
under the purview of the Campus
Judicial Panel, a body established
by the University President.
Despite recurring efforts over the
past three years by the so-called
"Committee of Fifteen" to
remedy the situation, no proposed
system for adjudicating student
disciplinary cases has been found
that meets with the concerted
approval of the administration,
the faculty and the student body.
It is now time, in the relative
tranquility of 1974, to ameliorate
that situation.
Students will be working on
these and many other problem
areas during this academic year.
Ann Carter presently chairs a
student Advisory Committee on
the Row Housing. Cynthia Davis
and I recently prepared a
presentation of student opinion to
an Advisor's Workshop, attended
by freshman advisors and
administrators.
An account of the pressures of
schoolwork, many students are
hesitant to become involved in
extra-curricular activities. But
these problems will not disappear
by themselves, and the
administration and faculty can
not be expected to represent the
student viewpoint. ASSU Senate
elections occur in three weeks;
ad ministration-faculty-student
committee openings occur all year
around. I hope that all of you will
avail yourselves of the possibilities
to affect this University as the
University will affect you.

undergraduate students, to those
students, faculty members and
administrators who are also
parents of pre-school children,
child care remains a serious
concern. At present, despite the
noticeable assistance of the Office
of the Dean of Students and the
general approval of the University
governance, inadequacies continue
in areas of daytime care, facilities
for children of six years and older,
care for sick children,
transportation to and from
existing facilities and prohibitively
excessive fees.
Campus Judicial System—Since
1971, all student judicial
proceedings on the Stanford
campus have ostensibly fallen
under the purview of the Campus
Judicial Panel, a body established
by the University President.
Despite recurring efforts over the
past three years by the so-called
"Committee of Fifteen" to
remedy the situation, no proposed
system for adjudicating student
disciplinary cases has been found
that meets with the concerted
approval of the administration,
the faculty and the student body.
It is now time, in the relative
tranquility of 1974, to ameliorate
that situation.
Students will be working on
these and many other problem
areas during this academic year.
Ann Carter presently chairs a
student Advisory Committee on
the Row Housing. Cynthia Davis
and I recently prepared a
presentation of student opinion to
an Advisor's Workshop, attended
by freshman advisors and
administrators.
An account of the pressures of
schoolwork, many students are
hesitant to become involved in
extra-curricular activities. But
these problems will not disappear
by themselves, and the
administration and faculty can
not be expected to represent the
student viewpoint. ASSU Senate
elections occur in three weeks;
ad ministration-faculty-student
committee openings occur all year
around. I hope that all of you will
avail yourselves of the possibilities
to affect this University as the
University will affect you.

As the Stanford University
community once again begins its
pursuit of academic, athletic and
social ends, it is perhaps well to
review, at this early stage, some of
the areas in which the general
student body expressed most
discontent with the status quo at
Stanford at the conclusion of the
last academic year, with the
ultimate hope that we may be
able to find some measure of
solution to these areas. At the risk
of boring the newspaper-reading
breakfast crowd, allow me to
enumerate what I perceive some
of those areas to be:
Housing—At the conclusion of
the housing draw held last Spring,
a large sector of the student
population involuntarily was left
without assignment to a
University residence.
A report prepared by three
members of the administration
and released during the summer
recommended the immediate
construction of three Row houses
accommodating approximately
50 persons each to be
completed by September of 1976,
as well as the construction of 850
housing spaces for undergraduates
in the next seven to 10 years.
Yet, if there were one general
problem that most affected
students and about which the
Dean of Student Affairs receives
the most complaints, it would be
that of housing.
Advising—ln particular, for the
freshman, the transfer, or the
general studies student, the
advising situation at Stanford can
be inconsistent, and often
damagingly disappointing. This is
more of a personal or human
problem than it is an institutional
one.
Areas of concern here are the
manner of selecting an advisor,
the general lack of incentive on
the advisor's part, the exaggerated
expectations students bring to the
system, the possible lack of
consideration in referral for
specific problems and the lack of
alternative methods for the
acquisition of advice.
Child Care—Although this
situation affects very few
undergraduate students, to those
students, faculty members and
administrators who are also
parents of pre-school children,
child care remains a serious
concern. At present, despite the
noticeable assistance of the Office
of the Dean of Students and the
general approval of the University
governance, inadequacies continue
in areas of daytime care, facilities
for children of six years and older,
care for sick children,
transportation to and from
