## Lofty Endeavors Spark Dull Decor 
### JANET SWANBERG 
Returning to dormitories,
students are greeted by sterile
walls, institutional uniformity and
army-barrack drabness. The
freshness of digging in a summer
garden, backpacking in the
Sierras, or traveling through youth
hostels fades into a gorgeous blur
of memories when you return to a
prison-like dorm room.
Although the stark
cookie-cutter shaped rooms may
seem unconquerable, simple but
creative additions and
improvements can make dorm
rooms individualized and livable.
An interesting room is a visual
collage of heights, textures, and
colors. Here are some suggestions
to jazz up your walls, dress up
your ceiling, and increase your
floor space.
Wall Work
You can tack Indian print
bedspreads, tie-dye sheets, old
curtains or simple printed cotton
to the walls to soften the
starkness of a dorm room, while
covering nail holes and other
memorials to departed residents.
Tie-dye designs can be ironed flat
and spread on the wall or pinned
to the ceiling and allowed to fall
to the floor in accordion folds.
Simple yarn creates geometric
patterns on the wall when
attached at the ceiling and floor in
diagonal lines. Figures and borders
can be fashioned with different
colors and types of yarn. The yarn
design can be mated with
mounted photographs and
magazine cut-outs for a texture
combination.
If things are in the way, hang
them on the wall. Backpacks,

down sleeping bags, golf clubs,
tennis rackets and guitars are
usually stuffed under beds. On the
walls, they can be artistic.
If you are paranoid that your
beautiful Mercier will be stolen if
left outside, attach it to the wall
by the rear wheel on a large
covered hook (available at bike
stores for $3.) If it seems bulky,
put it behind a door or in a
corner.
Hang It Up
Use upper moldings to hang
creative planters. Attach thern to
the moldings with rustic chains
and large brass hooks, or suspend
a macrame plant holder from a
board supported by the molding
at two adjacent sides of a corner.
Cut the board to fit, so it rests
diagonally, forming a triangle with
the corner. Tack to secure.
You can also hang plants from
overhead pipes, lights, or birdcage
holders.
The ceiling is just a drab empty
space in most dorms. An orange
and white parachute, gracefully
suspended from the center and
corners, makes a great
conversation piece and an unusual
cover. Change the color of the
light bulb under the parachute
and watch your room glow red or
green. Surplus stores sell
parachutes for $10-15.
Draped fishnet will also enliven
your ceiling. Attach it here and
there to the ceiling to create the
effect of waves in motion. If
you're still mentally camping and
backpacking, paste-on stars
(available at art stores) may help
remind you of the mountains. If
you tire of parachutes or fishnet,
try covering your ceiling with

Indian print bedspreads, fake
paneling, or mobiles.
Cloth curtains lend texture.
Easily made from colored, figured
sheets, they can hang from an
expandable rod (available at a
variety store). Hanging beads also
make exotic curtains.
Convertible
If your room has more than
one door, consider converting
one. Supported by trunks or
bricks, a wood door is a sturdy
table to hold a stereo, plants, or
books.
A word of caution, however:
the University requires that you
leave the room exactly the way
you found it. To avoid forfeiting a
room deposit, make sure you'll be
able to put the room back
together before your embark on
any major project.
For the less ambitions, old
crates, empty beer kegs, or
pre-formed styrofoam used for
packing fragile electronic
equipment can become tables.
If your bed takes up too much
space, try making a self-supported
bed-loft. If the bed is metal, you
can simply elevate it with
extender poles, available in your
dorm office. Or for about
$25—and an afternoon of
work—you can build an attractive
wood loft.
You don't have to be a master
carpenter if you have access to
good tools and know how to use
them. The following instructions
come from last year's residents of
Donner, Eucalypto and Toyon.
Measure and cut the following
wood:
plywood for top (ranging from
7'x3' to 7'xB\ 3/4" thick);

four 4"x4" supporting legs
(cut desired height);
three 2"x4" supports (to
extend at floor between 3 sides of
loft);
four short 2" x 4" supports (to
use as cross braces).
Cut lumber. With a friend,
balance the plywood on top of
the four supporting legs, like a
table. Secure with nails or bolts.
Install the 2"x4" braces
connecting three of the legs.
These braces prevent the loft from

rocking back and forth.
One side is left open to allow
entry under the loft. Support the
plywood with cross-braces, made
from 2"x4" cut at 45 degree
angles at both sides. These should
make a triangle between the
plywood and the legs. Balance and
nail securely.
The loft must be completely
self supporting. Nails in the walls
are a strict "no-no" in the eyes of
the University. Remember that all
construction must be dismantled
at the end of the year.

table to hold a stereo, plants, or
books.
A word of caution, however:
the University requires that you
leave the room exactly the way
you found it. To avoid forfeiting a
room deposit, make sure you'll be
able to put the room back
together before your embark on
any major project.
For the less ambitions, old
crates, empty beer kegs, or
pre-formed styrofoam used for
packing fragile electronic
equipment can become tables.
If your bed takes up too much
space, try making a self-supported
bed-loft. If the bed is metal, you
can simply elevate it with
extender poles, available in your
dorm office. Or for about
$25—and an afternoon of
work—you can build an attractive
wood loft.
You don't have to be a master
carpenter if you have access to
good tools and know how to use
them. The following instructions
come from last year's residents of
Donner, Eucalypto and Toyon.
Measure and cut the following
wood:
plywood for top (ranging from
7'x3' to 7'xB\ 3/4" thick);

four 4"x4" supporting legs
(cut desired height);
three 2"x4" supports (to
extend at floor between 3 sides of
loft);
four short 2" x 4" supports (to
use as cross braces).
Cut lumber. With a friend,
balance the plywood on top of
the four supporting legs, like a
table. Secure with nails or bolts.
Install the 2"x4" braces
connecting three of the legs.
These braces prevent the loft from

rocking back and forth.
One side is left open to allow
entry under the loft. Support the
plywood with cross-braces, made
from 2"x4" cut at 45 degree
angles at both sides. These should
make a triangle between the
plywood and the legs. Balance and
nail securely.
The loft must be completely
self supporting. Nails in the walls
are a strict "no-no" in the eyes of
the University. Remember that all
construction must be dismantled
at the end of the year.

A MAN'S HOME—Even a dorm room can be a castle, as evidenced by
this former Toyon resident's ambitious decorating scheme.
Returning to dormitories,
students are greeted by sterile
walls, institutional uniformity and
army-barrack drabness. The
freshness of digging in a summer
garden, backpacking in the
Sierras, or traveling through youth
hostels fades into a gorgeous blur
of memories when you return to a
prison-like dorm room.
Although the stark
cookie-cutter shaped rooms may
seem unconquerable, simple but
creative additions and
improvements can make dorm
rooms individualized and livable.
An interesting room is a visual
collage of heights, textures, and
colors. Here are some suggestions
to jazz up your walls, dress up
your ceiling, and increase your
floor space.
Wall Work
You can tack Indian print
bedspreads, tie-dye sheets, old
curtains or simple printed cotton
to the walls to soften the
starkness of a dorm room, while
covering nail holes and other
memorials to departed residents.
Tie-dye designs can be ironed flat
and spread on the wall or pinned
to the ceiling and allowed to fall
to the floor in accordion folds.
Simple yarn creates geometric
patterns on the wall when
attached at the ceiling and floor in
diagonal lines. Figures and borders
can be fashioned with different
colors and types of yarn. The yarn
design can be mated with
mounted photographs and
magazine cut-outs for a texture
combination.
If things are in the way, hang
them on the wall. Backpacks,

down sleeping bags, golf clubs,
tennis rackets and guitars are
usually stuffed under beds. On the
walls, they can be artistic.
If you are paranoid that your
beautiful Mercier will be stolen if
left outside, attach it to the wall
by the rear wheel on a large
covered hook (available at bike
stores for $3.) If it seems bulky,
put it behind a door or in a
corner.
Hang It Up
Use upper moldings to hang
creative planters. Attach thern to
the moldings with rustic chains
and large brass hooks, or suspend
a macrame plant holder from a
board supported by the molding
at two adjacent sides of a corner.
Cut the board to fit, so it rests
diagonally, forming a triangle with
the corner. Tack to secure.
You can also hang plants from
overhead pipes, lights, or birdcage
holders.
The ceiling is just a drab empty
space in most dorms. An orange
and white parachute, gracefully
suspended from the center and
corners, makes a great
conversation piece and an unusual
cover. Change the color of the
light bulb under the parachute
and watch your room glow red or
green. Surplus stores sell
parachutes for $10-15.
Draped fishnet will also enliven
your ceiling. Attach it here and
there to the ceiling to create the
effect of waves in motion. If
you're still mentally camping and
backpacking, paste-on stars
(available at art stores) may help
remind you of the mountains. If
you tire of parachutes or fishnet,
try covering your ceiling with

Indian print bedspreads, fake
paneling, or mobiles.
Cloth curtains lend texture.
Easily made from colored, figured
sheets, they can hang from an
expandable rod (available at a
variety store). Hanging beads also
make exotic curtains.
Convertible
If your room has more than
one door, consider converting
one. Supported by trunks or
bricks, a wood door is a sturdy
table to hold a stereo, plants, or
books.

Simple yarn creates geometric
patterns on the wall when
attached at the ceiling and floor in
diagonal lines. Figures and borders
can be fashioned with different
colors and types of yarn. The yarn
design can be mated with
mounted photographs and
magazine cut-outs for a texture
combination.
If things are in the way, hang
them on the wall. Backpacks,

down sleeping bags, golf clubs,
tennis rackets and guitars are
usually stuffed under beds. On the
walls, they can be artistic.
If you are paranoid that your
beautiful Mercier will be stolen if
left outside, attach it to the wall
by the rear wheel on a large
covered hook (available at bike
stores for $3.) If it seems bulky,
put it behind a door or in a
corner.
Hang It Up
Use upper moldings to hang
creative planters. Attach thern to
the moldings with rustic chains
and large brass hooks, or suspend
a macrame plant holder from a
board supported by the molding
at two adjacent sides of a corner.
Cut the board to fit, so it rests
diagonally, forming a triangle with
the corner. Tack to secure.
You can also hang plants from
overhead pipes, lights, or birdcage
holders.
The ceiling is just a drab empty
space in most dorms. An orange
and white parachute, gracefully
suspended from the center and
corners, makes a great
conversation piece and an unusual
cover. Change the color of the
light bulb under the parachute
and watch your room glow red or
green. Surplus stores sell
parachutes for $10-15.
Draped fishnet will also enliven
your ceiling. Attach it here and
there to the ceiling to create the
effect of waves in motion. If
you're still mentally camping and
backpacking, paste-on stars
(available at art stores) may help
remind you of the mountains. If
you tire of parachutes or fishnet,
try covering your ceiling with

Indian print bedspreads, fake
paneling, or mobiles.
Cloth curtains lend texture.
Easily made from colored, figured
sheets, they can hang from an
expandable rod (available at a
variety store). Hanging beads also
make exotic curtains.
Convertible
If your room has more than
one door, consider converting
one. Supported by trunks or
bricks, a wood door is a sturdy
table to hold a stereo, plants, or
books.
A word of caution, however:
the University requires that you
leave the room exactly the way
you found it. To avoid forfeiting a
room deposit, make sure you'll be
able to put the room back
together before your embark on
any major project.
For the less ambitions, old
crates, empty beer kegs, or
pre-formed styrofoam used for
packing fragile electronic
equipment can become tables.
If your bed takes up too much
space, try making a self-supported
bed-loft. If the bed is metal, you
can simply elevate it with
extender poles, available in your
dorm office. Or for about
$25—and an afternoon of
work—you can build an attractive
wood loft.
You don't have to be a master
carpenter if you have access to
good tools and know how to use
them. The following instructions
come from last year's residents of
Donner, Eucalypto and Toyon.
Measure and cut the following
wood:
plywood for top (ranging from
7'x3' to 7'xB\ 3/4" thick);

four 4"x4" supporting legs
(cut desired height);
three 2"x4" supports (to
extend at floor between 3 sides of
loft);
four short 2" x 4" supports (to
use as cross braces).
Cut lumber. With a friend,
balance the plywood on top of
the four supporting legs, like a
table. Secure with nails or bolts.
Install the 2"x4" braces
connecting three of the legs.
These braces prevent the loft from

rocking back and forth.
One side is left open to allow
entry under the loft. Support the
plywood with cross-braces, made
from 2"x4" cut at 45 degree
angles at both sides. These should
make a triangle between the
plywood and the legs. Balance and
nail securely.
The loft must be completely
self supporting. Nails in the walls
are a strict "no-no" in the eyes of
the University. Remember that all
construction must be dismantled
at the end of the year.

A MAN'S HOME—Even a dorm room can be a castle, as evidenced by
this former Toyon resident's ambitious decorating scheme.
Returning to dormitories,
students are greeted by sterile
walls, institutional uniformity and
army-barrack drabness. The
freshness of digging in a summer
garden, backpacking in the
Sierras, or traveling through youth
hostels fades into a gorgeous blur
of memories when you return to a
prison-like dorm room.
Although the stark
cookie-cutter shaped rooms may
seem unconquerable, simple but
creative additions and
improvements can make dorm
rooms individualized and livable.
An interesting room is a visual
collage of heights, textures, and
colors. Here are some suggestions
to jazz up your walls, dress up
your ceiling, and increase your
floor space.
Wall Work
You can tack Indian print
bedspreads, tie-dye sheets, old
curtains or simple printed cotton
to the walls to soften the
starkness of a dorm room, while
covering nail holes and other
memorials to departed residents.
Tie-dye designs can be ironed flat
and spread on the wall or pinned
to the ceiling and allowed to fall
to the floor in accordion folds.
Simple yarn creates geometric
patterns on the wall when
attached at the ceiling and floor in
diagonal lines. Figures and borders
can be fashioned with different
colors and types of yarn. The yarn
design can be mated with
mounted photographs and
magazine cut-outs for a texture
