How" many freshmen request single-sex housing? Where are they
placed? 8.8. K.
Only 16 of 921 freshman males and 27 of 617 freshman females in
the class of 1978 requested single-sex housing, according to housing
office student staffer Mark Dexter. Of these, only 20 women were
assigned single-sex housing due to conflicts with residence-oriented
freshman seminars, he added.
Freshman women requesting single-sex housing are placed in
Paloma House, Florence Moore Hall; there is no single-sex dormitory
for men. The University requires that all freshmen spend their first
year in the University housing system.
Dexter explained that all-male fraternities seem to have offset the
need for a four-class all male dorm. The balance of demand for
women's single-sex housing in Paloma is met by upper class women,
he said.
In last year's freshman class, only 12 men and 21 women requested
single-sex housing, according to housing office figures. Dexter said the
demand for an all-male dormitory would need to climb to 50 males
per year (the size of the smallest dormitory house on campus) before
the housing office could offer men single-sex University housing.

Why don't they ask you if you mind rooming with someone who
smokes before assigning you a freshman roommate? S.F.
The housing office does implicitly ask students if they would mind
rooming with a person who smokes. On a white information card that
is filled out by all newly-admitted freshmen, the housing office asks
the following: "What special need to you believe should be taken into
account in assigning you a room?"
According to housing office student staffer Mark Dexter, the
majority of women request a non-smoking roommate as an answer to
that housing office question.
When asked why the housing office just doesn't come out and ask
if freshmen mind rooming with a smoker, Dexter replied that those
who find it really important will list it under the general question. A
specific question might invoke arbitrary choices and make matching
of roommates even more difficult, he explained.
Dexter added, however, that including a specific smoking question
has been officially suggested and will receive further housing office
consideration.
