# Tuition Grant Bill Awaits Reagan Action
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
California's tuition grant bill,
designed to provide $1 million in
scholarship aid to students from
middle-income families, is
currently on Gov. Ronald
Reagan's desk, awaiting his
decision.
Reagan has until Sept. 30 to
sign or veto A 83862. If no action
is taken by then, the bill
automatically becomes law, as the
legislature has adjourned.
The state Senate and Assembly
passed the bill during the summer.
Set to begin in 1975, the
scholarships would come in
amounts of $900 or one-third the
annual tuition, whichever is less.
The money would be independent
of the California State
scholarships currently available.
The bill states that 1250 new
grants will be made available in
each of the next three years, with
recipients eligible for annual
renewal.
ASSU Vice President Quinn
Mayer organized a letter-writing
campaign and worked with an ad
hoc lobby group to put pressure
on legislators, before it had been
approved.
Earlier this summer, Mayer
noted that 60 percent of the
student body here received some
form of financial aid. There still
are many students being hurt by
the rising education costs, but
economically ineligible for grants,
he added.
Yesterday, Mayer said that
indications he has received from
trustees and persons who have
continually lobbied for the bill
were that chances for obtaining
Reagan's approval were "good."
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett
(R-Redwood City), visiting
Stanford yesterday, said the bill
has a 50-50 chance of being signed
by Reagan.
Arnett, a former University
administrator here, noted that the
bill's sponsor. Assemblyman
Erank Lanterman (R-La Canada)
had negotiated the financial
arrangements with the vice
chairman of the assembly Ways
and Means Committee.
Arnett's uncertainty is based
on the fact that the amount of aid
"can go up to $9 million in future
years. He noted that Reagan will
probably consider all bills that
require large expenditures
together, deciding on priorities
before making a final decision.
