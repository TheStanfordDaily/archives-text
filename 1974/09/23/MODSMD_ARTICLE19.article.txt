# Trustees Approve Senate Recommendation
## Freedom Statement Adopted 
### 
A long-deliberated statement of academic
freedom was adopted by the Board of Trustees at
their regular meeting Sept. 10, after two years of
study.
The statement, which was unanimously adopted
by the Faculty Senate in April and strongly
endorsed by President Richard W. Lyman, provides
that key decisions affecting individual faculty
"shall be made without regard to a person's
political, social or other views not directly related
to academic values or to the assumption of
academic responsibilities."
Decisions about faculty searches, appointments
and promotions; assignments of teaching or other
primarily academic responsibilities; support and
sponsorship of scholarly research and "any other
granting or withholding of benefits or imposition of
burdens," are among the items covered in the
statement.
Implementation provisions are being developed
by the Advisory Board, a group of seven full
professors elected by the faculty which reviews all
proposed appointments to tenure at Stanford.
The statement affirms that key decisions
affecting individual faculty shall be made "without
regard to the conduct of a person holding an
appointment at Stanford unless such conduct is
directly related to academic values or to the
assumption of academic responsibilities," or is
determined to fall within provisions established by

the Statement on Faculty Discipline, adopted last
year by the faculty, President and Board of
Trustees.
Lyman said this description of the
decision-making process was "a sound principle and
. . . accurately describes existing practice."
The committee report declared that "the
University should be the foremost guardian of the
freedoms that sustain it." Rights and standards of
academic freedom should be "upheld by careful
internal processes and, as far as possible, not by
recourse to the courts or other outside agencies,
which might or might not respect the
confidentiality and integrity of the academic
decision-making process. .. . Outside agencies
should normally be a last resort for an aggrieved
individual."
Law Prof. Paul A. Brest headed the
subcommittee that originally drafted the statement.
Its members included Professors Mark Mancall,
history; John L. Mothershead Jr., philosophy; Jack
H. Friedenthal, law; and George A. Collier,
anthropology.
The statement's preamble says that "Stanford
University's central functions of teaching, learning,
research and scholarship depend upon an
atmosphere in which freedom of inquiry, thought,
expression, publication and peaceable assembly are
given the fullest protection.
