# New Labor Relations Act Hounds Med Center Help

### GLENN KRAMON 
A number of labor organizations
have expressed interest in representing
Stanford Hospital employees now that
the National Labor Relations Act
(NLRA) has been amended to require
that non-profit hospitals submit to
rules of collective bargaining.
The amendments, signed into law
July 26 by President Nixon, cover
about 1.4 million employees of health
care institutions. For the first time,
hospitals must now deal with labor
organizations like any other
non-health care employer under
NLRA provisions.
Stanford Hospital had previously
negotiated with two organizations, the
Committee for the Recognition of
Nursing Achievements (CRONA) and
the California Licensed Vocational
Nurses Association (CLVNA), on a
voluntary basis.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
filed a petition with the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on
Sept. 12 asking to represent a
bargaining unit of more than 1000
hospital employees.
The unit would consist of all
patient care, technical, service and
support personnel, including
pharmacists, licensed vocational
nurses, and nursing clerks, and
excluding all interns and residents,
doctors, registered nurses, office
clerical employees, guards, and
supervisors, according to USE
President Jim Berk.
But since the petition which
required signed authorization cards
from 30 percent of the employees in
the proposed bargaining unit was filed,
other labor organizations have
indicated an interest in representing
smaller groups of hospital employees.
The NLRB held an informal
conference last Friday to determine
appropriate bargaining units for these
employees. The board tentatively set
Oct. 4 as the date to initiate formal
hearings on appropriate bargaining
units. But both Berk and John J.
Schwartz, counsel to the vice president
for medical affairs at the Medical
Center, say they expect a delay while
preliminary groundwork is completed.
After the NLRB chooses the
appropriate bargaining units, it holds

an election of the hospital employees
to determine if they want a union and.
if so, which union. If the majority of
votes cast goes to a union, it is
certified to represent the employees.
Other labor organizations vying to
be certified to represent hospital
employees include:
—CRONA, which had represented
the hospital's 700 registered nurses in
negotiating a two-year contract
executed in mid-July after an 11-day
walkout, has indicated an intention to
represent registered nurses in Stanford
clinics in addition to those they
already represent in the Hospital.
—CLVNA, which has already
negotiated but not yet executed a
contract with the hospital, say they
wish to be certified to continue to
represent the licensed vocational
nurses there.
—USE can also seek to represent
the licensed vocational nurses because,
under NLRA rules, a union may be
selected to represent employees
previously represented by another
union if a written contract between
the hospital and the union is not in
effect.
—the Stanford University Medical
Center Engineering Association,
certified by the state in 1972 to
represent some employees in the
engineering department, has shown an
intent to petition for certification to
represent an expanded group of
engineers.
—The Stanford University Medical
Technologists said they would petition
to represent some 110 licensed lab
technicians.
USE President Berk said he felt
"1000 percent" sure that the NLRB will
approve the USE petition to represent
the proposed unit, which comprises
almost two-fifths of the hospital's
2600 employees.
John Meakins, NLRB agent for the
petition, could not be reached for
comment.
Berk suggested that USE might
later try to represent the 300-400
office clerical employees, mostly
women, at the hospital. "When they're
ready, we'll go for them. Right now.
they're not in the same state of
consciousness" as those prepared to
organize, he said.
