# Business Prof. Outlines Economic 'Guideposts'
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
George L. Bach, professor at
the Graduate School of Business,
recommended last Friday that
President Ford work toward "a
realistic, moderate set of
non-mandatory guideposts for
wages and prices," complemented
with "an announced, moderately
restrictive monetary-fiscal
policy."
Bach made these remarks in a
paper prepared at Ford's
invitation for the presummit
"mini-conference" on banking
and finance in Washington.
The Stanford economist
stressed that without a
moderately restrictive
monetary-fiscal policy, wage-price
guideposts will not work.
Conversely, without wage-price
restraint, monetary-fiscal policy
will be unable to combat
inflation.
"The only real anti-inflation
alternative is to ask
monetary-fiscal policy to do the
job alone, with enormously costly
recession, or to move to
mandatory direct controls, with
their equally great economic
inefficiences and socio-political
disruptions," Bach said.
Simple Policy
"What is needed is a relatively
simple, well-understood policy.
Sporadic, ad hoc jawboning will
accomplish little, generate major
inefficiences and inequities and
prove economically and politically
divisive."
Bach, the Frank E. Buck
professor in economics and public
policy, said that Ford faces a
major job of "economic
education."
"Perhaps development of
guideposts should include some
off-the-record hard bargaining
sessions among business, labor and
a few government leaders under
real pressure from the American
people and their leaders in
Washington,"he said.
Ford asked Bach and the other
mini-summit conference
participants to prepare one-page
summaries with recommendations
on short- and long-range steps to
defeat inflation.
No 'Absolute Sacrifices'
Bach reported to the
conference that the wage and
price guideposts need not involve
any "absolute sacrifices." With a
stably growing economy, income
increases could be held to an

average of three or four percent
annually, assuming a similar rate
of long-run economic growth, he
said.
He added that "widespread
attempts to catch up or get ahead
through escalated wage and price
increases or governmental
programs will simply lead to
accelerated inflation, not to larger
incomes."
Bach, a consultant to the
Federal Reserve Board and to the
secretary of the treasury, will also
participate in the summit
conference on inflation this
Friday.
The conference agenda deals
with a wide range of questions
and issues in the areas of fiscal
and monetary policy and capital
markets.
Bach is the author of The New
Inflation: Cause, Effects, Cure,
published last year.
