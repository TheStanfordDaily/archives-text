# KZSU Grid Broadcasts Limited To AM Band
## 
### 
KZSU has been prohibited
from broadcasting Stanford
football games on its FM band
because live FM broadcasts would
violate an exclusive contract
between the Athletic Department
and KSFO, a San Francisco-based
radio station.
KZSU can still broadcast on its
AM band, which reaches only
Stanford dormitories.
The contract, which has been
in existence for a number of
years, forbids the Athletic
Department from granting
broadcasting rights for football
and basketball games to any other
radio station in nine Bay Area
counties, including Santa Clara,
The contract was inadvertantly
violated for at least five years,
until former Sports Information
Director Bob Murphy discovered
the clause last December.
At that time, KZSU was forced
to suspend its regular broadcast
schedule of Stanford basketball
games.
Athletic Director Joseph
Ruetz said that although ne would
like to grant KZSU full
broadcasting rights, "we can't
allow the greater band because of
our exclusive contract with
KSFO."

R.uetz offered to allow KZSU
to broadcast the games over its
KM band on a tape-delay basis,
but station officials decided to
refuse the offer. "We feel it would
be a pointless exercise to do
tape-delay," said news director
Mark Pelesh, citing programming
difficulties and the likelihood of a
small listening audience.
Pelesh said "there isn't a whole
lot we can do," since the KSFO
contract reportedly accounts for
$28,000 annually in Athletic
Department revenue.
"Ruetz' position is — and we
support it completely — that this
is a very important source of
income," Pelesh said. "Everybody
is very amicable. We just feel it's
ridiculous that we're about the
only college station in the U.S.
that can't broadcast its own games
over a decent band."
Play-by-play announcer Pete
Bhatia expressed the view that
KZSU is not in direct competition
with KSFO. "We're no threat to
their broadcast audience," Bhatia
said. "We're a small educational
station serving a student audience
and even though our product may
be comparable to theirs
|KSFO's|, 1 can't see why they
feel so threatened by our
coverage."
