# New Campus Drive Baffles Motorists
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Returning students who plan
to drive to Tresidder Union or
Florence Moore Hall via Campus
Drive are in for a mild shock. In
fact, many students have already
set out for these places only to
find themselves on Junipert) Serra
Blvd.
The reason: Campus Drive has
subtly shifted its position. It looks
like its old self from its western
origin near the Medical Center to
the Stern parking lot at Alvarado
Row.
But from there, it veers slightly
to the left, cutting past Lasuen
House and heading straight out to
Junipero Serra over what used to
be May field Avenue.
May field, meanwhile, still
begins in the southern part of the
Row past Guthrie and Durand
Houses, but now continues down
what used to be Lasuen. Near the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity, where
Lasuen formerly intersected the
old Campus Drive, Mayfield now
makes a 90 degree turn and
continues on what used to be
Campus Drive past Tresidder and
Florence Moore Hall.
No Direct Route
There is no longer a direct
route from Campus Drive and
Alvarado Row past the Beta
House, and motorists who want to
get to Tresidder must head north
on Mayfield from the new
Campus Drive. The road to the
post office and the book store can
now be reached by turning north
on Salvatierra from Campus Drive.
Sitting in the middle of the old
Campus Drive, next to the Beta
House, is a remodeled Delta
Upsilon fraternity house which
had to be moved from Salvatierra
because of the Law School and
parking lot construction.
Master Planner Oscar Nelson
said the main reason for this
face-lifting was the amount of
traffic that the old Campus Drive
brought through the center of
campus. He said about 9000
vehicles used the road during an
average 24-hour period last year.
Nelson cited the "conflict

between pedestrians and
automobiles" at the corner of
Lasuen and old Campus Drive as
one problem with the old route,
and added that it was awkward
for motorists to have to go south
on Lasuen and make an "acute"
turn on Mayfield to get to
Junipero Serra.
Peripheral Traffic
"We feel that the new
alignment is shorter for traffic
going around the periphery of the
campus," Nelson explained.
He said the project was
undertaken because "the old
alignment of Campus Drive was
literally wearing out and had to be
rebuilt."
Nelson said it would have cost
less to repave the old road, "but
we would have a new road in the
old location with many of the
same problems."
Several Row houses had to be
upgraded over the summer to
meet housing code standards,
including the Delta Upsilon
House, the Beta House, Hurlburt
House and Stillman House.
Hurlburt and Stillman used to
comprise the two parts of Grove
House on Lasuen, but Stillman
House was moved across Campus
Drive last year to become the new
Columbae House. Last year,
Hurlburt and Lasuen made up
Grove, but Hurlburt has now been
moved south on Lasuen.
Another house, at 584
Mayfield, has now been brought
into the housing system to join
with Lasuen House as the new
Grove. This house has been used
by various organizations, and
most recently contained the
Institute for Human Problems. It
was once a fraternity house.

Sitting in the middle of the old
Campus Drive, next to the Beta
House, is a remodeled Delta
Upsilon fraternity house which
had to be moved from Salvatierra
because of the Law School and
parking lot construction.
Master Planner Oscar Nelson
said the main reason for this
face-lifting was the amount of
traffic that the old Campus Drive
brought through the center of
campus. He said about 9000
vehicles used the road during an
average 24-hour period last year.
Nelson cited the "conflict

between pedestrians and
automobiles" at the corner of
Lasuen and old Campus Drive as
one problem with the old route,
and added that it was awkward
for motorists to have to go south
on Lasuen and make an "acute"
turn on Mayfield to get to
Junipero Serra.
Peripheral Traffic
"We feel that the new
alignment is shorter for traffic
going around the periphery of the
campus," Nelson explained.
He said the project was
undertaken because "the old
alignment of Campus Drive was
literally wearing out and had to be
rebuilt."
Nelson said it would have cost
less to repave the old road, "but
we would have a new road in the
old location with many of the
same problems."
Several Row houses had to be
upgraded over the summer to
meet housing code standards,
including the Delta Upsilon
House, the Beta House, Hurlburt
House and Stillman House.
Hurlburt and Stillman used to
comprise the two parts of Grove
House on Lasuen, but Stillman
House was moved across Campus
Drive last year to become the new
Columbae House. Last year,
Hurlburt and Lasuen made up
Grove, but Hurlburt has now been
moved south on Lasuen.
Another house, at 584
Mayfield, has now been brought
into the housing system to join
with Lasuen House as the new
Grove. This house has been used
by various organizations, and
most recently contained the
Institute for Human Problems. It
was once a fraternity house.
Returning students who plan
to drive to Tresidder Union or
Florence Moore Hall via Campus
Drive are in for a mild shock. In
fact, many students have already
set out for these places only to
find themselves on Junipert) Serra
Blvd.
The reason: Campus Drive has
subtly shifted its position. It looks
like its old self from its western
origin near the Medical Center to
the Stern parking lot at Alvarado
Row.
But from there, it veers slightly
to the left, cutting past Lasuen
House and heading straight out to
Junipero Serra over what used to
be May field Avenue.
May field, meanwhile, still
begins in the southern part of the
Row past Guthrie and Durand
Houses, but now continues down
what used to be Lasuen. Near the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity, where
Lasuen formerly intersected the
old Campus Drive, Mayfield now
makes a 90 degree turn and
continues on what used to be
Campus Drive past Tresidder and
Florence Moore Hall.
No Direct Route
There is no longer a direct
route from Campus Drive and
Alvarado Row past the Beta
House, and motorists who want to
get to Tresidder must head north
on Mayfield from the new
Campus Drive. The road to the
post office and the book store can
now be reached by turning north
on Salvatierra from Campus Drive.
