# Peace Studies Offers New 1974 Program
## 
### 
The Peace Studies program has
expanded this year, with more
faculty participants drawn from
all corners of the University, and a
new name: "Stanford Sadies in
Change, Conflict and Peace."
The program will span much of
the range of human conflicts,
from family quarrels to world
wars, according to French Prof.
Raymond Giraud, and will also
include social and economic issues
involved in conflict resolution.
The central thrust of the
program, Giraud added, is to
study the idea of a peaceful
society, evaluate the role of
conflict in aiding or thwarting the
emergence of such a society and
investigate the finds of change
that may be desirable to achieve
peace.
Courses this quarter include a
basic seminar on "Conflict, Peace
and Change" and four more
specialized courses on
"Nonviolence and Liberation,"
"Science and Society," "Women
in Prison" and "Work and Social
Change." Courses are expected to
be mostly of seminar size and will
proceed on the basis of mutual
assumption of responsibility for
conduct by both faculty and
students.
There are no prerequisites for
individual courses, but students
interested in a peace studies
concentration should contact
Political Science Prof. Charles
Drekmeier (Room 22-H, ext.
7-2608).
