# Andrew Parnes Named New SWOPSI Director
## 
### 
Andrew Parnes, an expert in consumer economics, assumed his
duties as director of Stanford Workshop on Social and Political
Issues (SWOPSI) Sept. 1. He replaces Dan Lewis, who served
three years.
Parnes was selected from among 55 applicants by a search
committee consisting of two faculty members, two students,
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs and Asst. Dean
Michael Clossen.
A graduate of Williams College, Parnes received his Ph.D. from
Stanford in 1972. He has taught two years at San Jose State
College.
"Parnes has a good academic background and he also has a real
interest and enthusiasm for current political and social issues,"
Clossen stated. "It's a nice blend."
Clossen added that he has already been impressed by Parnes'
performance as SWOPSI director.
Parnes worked hard to improve the organization of SWOPSI
courses and issue the new SWOPSI catalogue, Clossen said.
'The challenge of his job is to meet the needs of different
constituencies," Clossen noted. "He must relate to the SWOPSI
Policy Board and he must be sensitive to the opinions of faculty
members, some of whom still have doubts about the SWOPSI
program. Of course, he must also serve the needs of students."
Noting that 900 students enrolled in SWOPSI courses last year,
Clossen said he expects that Parnes will keep the program
"popular and vigorous."
