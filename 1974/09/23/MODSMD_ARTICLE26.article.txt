# Two Rulings Appealed In ‘Daily’ Search Case
## 
### 
Santa Clara County and the
City of Palo Alto appealed on
Aug. 21 two court rulings relating
to an April 1971 search of the
Stanford Daily office.
The appeal seeks review of U.S.
District Court Judge Robert F.
Peckham's decision that the
search was unconstitutional and
his awarding of $47,500 in
attorneys' expenses to Daily
lawyers.
The Daily filed the original suit
following a search of its office by
four Palo Alto policemen seeking
photographs or negatives of a
demonstration at Stanford
Hospital.
In October 1972, Peck ham
declared the search
unconstitutional and in July 1974
set the amount of attorney's fees.
Peckham noted in his later
ruling that the figure was based on
750 hours of attorney's time at
$50 an hour plus an increase on
the basis of the compensation's
contingent nature, the quality of

the work and the results obtained
by the litigation.
The Daily was represented by
San Francisco lawyers Robert
Mnookin and Jerome Falk Jr. and
Law Prof. Anthony Amsterdam.
However, the fees do not include
compensation for Amsterdam.
It is expected that six months
to a year will pass before the
appeal is argued before judges in
the Ninth Circuit court.
