# Decision On Pub Delayed
## 
### 
The decision on whether a pub
can be opened on campus has
been delayed at least until
October, Dean of Students James
Lyons said last night.
The University is currently
accepting bids for management of
several of its food service
operations including Tresidder
Food Service, the Coffee Shop,
Encina Commons and the Pub.
Lyons said that bids were being
opened because Tresidder
cafeteria had been forced to close
and because the University was
unable to negotiate a contract to
run the pub with the company
that currently runs the food
service, TDS Inc.
"We wanted them to do it
cheaper than they wanted to do
it," Lyons explained simply.
Since the University's position
has been that the company which
agrees to run the pub will also
apply for the liquor license, Lyons
said no further action will be
taken on the pub until a contract
is awarded in October.
Once a bid is accepted, Lyons
said, the fate of the pub is a
"question of two things: Can we
get the capital and can we get the
license."
He said the University had
planned to have the pub "going
and underway by now although
we always had that uncertainty
over whether the state would
allow a license."
The current fast-food service at
Tresidder is only seen as a
temporary measure, Lyons said.
"We know that this is a
transition?.' arrangement. We
opened that just to have
something open."

HI AGAlN—Stanford's band welcomed students back to the Farm with its rendition of "AH Right Now" and the formation "Hi Again." The
Incomparables, who had just returned from a successful engagement at Penn State, played a lot better than the football team Saturday.
