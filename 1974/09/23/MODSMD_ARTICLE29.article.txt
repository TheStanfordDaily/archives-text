# Speakers Bureau Schedule Includes Guests-In-Residence
## 
### GORDON FIRESTEIN 
Some well-known people, like
Julian Bond and Dick Gregory,
will speak at Stanford this
academic year, and some speakers
will do a lot more than lecture
when they visit. The ASSU
Speakers Bureau has persuaded
several speakers, including R.
Sargent Shriver, Dr. Michael
Deßakey and John Kenneth
Galbraith, to stay in a dorm for a
couple days as part of the new
guests-in-residence program.
Shriver will "probably" be the
first speaker to participate in the
new program, according to
Andrew Luechter, 20, director of
the bureau. Shriver is expected to
arrive on campus in mid-October,
the exact date contingent upon
the scheduling of a trip to Russia.
Deßakey, a noted heart
surgeon and medical educator,
also will be a guest-in-residence,
and will spend the night of Oct.
31 in the guest room of Branner
Hall. During his two-day stay at
Stanford, Deßakey will deliver a
speech on "the social
responsibility of medical
research," and late will lead an
informal discussion in Branner
lounge, attend a reception and eat
in the dorm dining room.
Harvard economist John
Kenneth Galbraith will stay on
campus the last three days of
April, and former astronaut Edgar
Mitchell, now director of the
Institute for the Noetic Sciences
in Palo Alto, plans to visit the
campus for a couple days this
quarter or next.
Every Dorm Complex
"Our objective this year,"
Leuchter said, "is to have
well-known speakers stay in every
major dorm complex. So far, only
four have agreed to stay overnight
in a dorm, although Leuchter said
he has contacted several more
who are considering it.
Leuchter said he sent "a couple
hundred" letters to recognized
authorities in politics, the sciences
and the arts, but that many
notables have refused to
participate. "Either they're not
particularly interested," Leuchter

said, "or thev are very, very
busy."
Another possible reason,
Leuchter said, is that the speakers
bureau is reluctant to pay an
honorarium of more than $1500.
The bureau's $10,000 budget for
1974-75, financed by a fee
assessment last spring, "is simply
not enough," Leuchter said.
"This is one of the few
universities of its size that does
not pay for a speakers program
itself." Leuchter added that he
anticipates asking for two $1 fee
assessments in 1975-76.
Expenses
Because the size of the
honorarium increases
proportionate to the length of the
speaker's stay on campus, the
bureau can invite only a few
speakers to stay for a night or

two. So some speakers, such as
Bond and Gregory, will be at
Stanford just for the evening.
Gregory will speak Nov. 13, and
Bond will speak sometime in the
spring.
Leuchter and the bureau's
eight-member board of directors
decide who to invite and how
much to pay the speakers. The
board members were chosen by
the ASSU Nominations
Committee, and will serve through
next spring.
Leuchter refuted allegations
that the invitations issued by the
bureau indicated a liberal political
bias. "Nobody on the board is
motivated by political views," he
said. "The purpose of the bureau
is to provide as broad a range of
speakers as we can get. We are by
no means partisan."
