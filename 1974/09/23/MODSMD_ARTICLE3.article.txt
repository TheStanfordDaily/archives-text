# Freshman Disorientation
## Stanford A Country Club? 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
"We don't wanta sit way up there, do we?" inquired a
forlorn Branner freshman of his colleagues before
Saturday's Stanford-Illinois debacle.
"We wanta sit somewhere where we can be obnoxious,"
he continued, ignorant of the fact that he was sitting in a
hallowed section of the stands soon to be occupied by the
Incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University Marching
Band.
Innocence—that's what being a freshman is all about,
and while the 1540 members of the Class of '78 may differ
from their predecessors in purely statistical matters, they
share the agonies and enthusiasms of every new kid ever to
hit the big campus.
"I couldn't eat the first day I got here. Everything was
so different," says Jeff Kleiner, a Branner freshman from
Denver, Colo. "I'd never seen so many people before. I
graduated from high school with 50 people, and there are
more than that in this dorm."
100 More Than Expected
Due to a one percent increase in applicants, a five
percent increase in completed applications, and a continued
63 percent enrollment among students offered admission
by the University, this year's freshman class is 100 members
larger than the admissions office predicted.
Dispelling the "Stanford ratio" myth, there are not two
boys for every girl in the freshman class, but the 40 percent
who are female are already experiencing the advances of
upperclassmen who are more than eager to meet the new
students.
"They wait in the halls and stuff," says Connie Miottel
of the upperclassmen hangers-on around Branner. "It's
icky."
Nonetheless, when several Branner residents engineered a
five-keg social event Saturday night, women and men alike
bragged that their party had drawn attendence from the
far-off region called San Jose.
'Great Country Club'
"It's a great country club,"says Portland, Ore. native

Scott Mayer of the campus. "I haven't done any work yet,
haven't paid any money yet. It's great so far."
"It should be called freshman d/sorientation,"
complained Kleiner. "You get to meet people, have a good
time, and then you never see them after classes start."
This year's orientation wasn't entirely aimed at
promoting the campus country club image however. A
portion of the five-day pre-registration program featured
what some called the "stars of the departments" lectures on
topics which ranged from"The Evolution of Corn
Agriculture in Ancient Mexico" given in Zapata House by
Asst. Anthropology Prof. George Collier to a panel
discussion on "Masculine/Feminine: What Does It Mean?"
given in Dinkelspiel Auditorium by Assoc. Law Prof.
Barbara Babcock, Assoc. Psychology Prof. Daryl Bern,
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch and Assoc. English
Prof. Diane Middlebrook.
Slightly Better Than Predecessors
Such intellectual fare so early in their college careers
may be entirely appropriate for the Class of '78,
Admissions Dean Fred Hargadon said last week. "On just
about every academic measure we have — scholastic
aptitude tests, achievement tests, and grades — the
incoming freshmen seem to have done slightly better than
their predecessors, and improvement at that level is hard to
come by."
Academically talented they may be, but the freshmen
spent an unusual amount of time Sunday perusing the Time
Schedule and Courses and Degrees, trying to find the right
three unit course or decipher the meaning of "dhr" before
conferring with their advisers.
"My adviser looked at my picture [in the Froshbook]
and said, 'My, how people change in six months,' " says
shaggy-haired John Powell of San Mateo, Calif.
Academic Seriousness, Worries
Showing some academic seriousness, a few freshmen
have expressed worries about the orientation carnival at
Tresidder being held the night before classes start. More
typical academic worries are expressed simply by Ellen
Cone of Seattle, Wash.
"Everyone here is so talented."
The idea of being one of 1540 very talented freshman
hit Kleiner on his bus ride down from the San Francisco
airport:
"I heard some things I didn't want to hear, like someone

asking how close to a four-point someone had, and "how
many fives did you get on the advanced placement?' and I
didn't want it to be that way."
Freshman innocence undaunted, the Class of '78 faces
their first registration lines today with their only common
major complaints being dorm food and the Illinois game.
Their hopes and frustrations were best summed by a young
fanleavingthe stadium late in the fourth quarter Saturday:
"I wonder if it's too late to transfer?"
