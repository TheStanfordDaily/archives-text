Hurricane Relief Efforts Slow
SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras — A shortage of aircraft
and fuel slowed down relief efforts yesterday along the
flooded northern coast of Honduras, where hurricane Fifi
left thousands dead and where many survivors still clung to
trees and rooftops.
Dazed Hondurans wandered along washed-out roads or
dug through piles of debris searching for friends and
relatives who disappeared during the storm. Fifi swept
through the region four days earlier with sustained winds of
110 miles per hour and gusts up to 130 m.p.h.
As many American church and civic groups began drives
for food, clothing and medical supplies, the American Red
Cross dispatched disaster specialists to Honduras.
The full extent of the disaster was unknown, but
officials said 5,000 were confirmed dead and 600,000 were
homeless in what the League of Red Cross societies in
Geneva termed one of the worst catastrophes in Central
American history.
U.S. Ambassador to Honduras Phillip V. Sancez reported
there are no Americans believed missing. He said he knew
nothing about reports that some 70 Peace Corps volunteers
had been in the area where the storm hit.
Fifi, downgraded to a tropical storm, continued to blow
itself out against the mountains of Chiapas in southern
Mexico, spreading heavy rains through the area. Eleven
Mexicans were reported dead.
The storm and flooding washed out whole villages along
the Honduran coast. Lt. Col. Muaro Flores Perifin of the
Honduran National Emergency Committee said yesterday
that at least 600,000 persons were left homeless.
Kennedy To Rule Out '76 Bid?
WASHINGTON — Democratic politicians, while
declaring they are in the dark about Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy's surprise announcement of today's press
conference to discuss his political future, said last night
they expect Kennedy to rule out a 1976 presidential bid.
Several said that something must have come up in recent
days to cause Kennedy to move forward an announcement
of his political plans that he previously had said would
come late this year or early in 1975.
"It can only be something of a personal nature," one
high-ranking Democrat said. Several said they expected that
family pressures against a 1976 Kennedy candidacy have
increased.
Close Kennedy associates here, however, said they knew
nothing about the announcement. So did Sens. Walter F.
Mondale (D—Minn.) and Henry W. Jackson (D—Wash.),
who have been exploring 1976 presidential candidacies.
One longtime Kennedy associate cited "the geography"
of the announcement, the fact that it will take place in
Boston, as a sign that Kennedy had reached a negative
decision on a possible 1976 presidential bid.
"If it were affirmative," the associate said, "it would be
in Washington."
Nixon To Enter Hospital Today
LONG BEACH, Calif. — Hospital preparations were
completed yesterday to receive former President Nixon for
treatment of phlebitis in his reportedly painfully swollen
left leg.
Nixon is scheduled to enter Memorial Hospital Medical

Center today for at least three days of care, ending weeks
of speculation on the state of his health.
Varying reports have circulated about Nixon's physical
and mental condition since he resigned the presidency Aug.
25. His former White House physician told an interviewer
that Nixon has refused to enter the hospital because, "If I
go into the hospital, I will never come out alive."
Nixon's care will include anti-coagulant treatments
aimed at dissolving two blood clots resting above the knee
of his left leg. Doctors say they could be fatal if either
broke free and lodged in his heart or lungs.
Congress Cuts Federal Budget
WASHINGTON — Congress has cut slightly more than
$1 billion from the federal budget for the current fiscal
year but appears to have little chance of reaching the goal
of a $5 billion reduction.
Until conferees reached final agreement on the $82.6
billion defense appropriations measure last week, the work
of the legislators had resulted in a $1.5 billion spending
increase in the current year's budget.
But they achieved a $2.6 billion spending reduction on
the defense bill, and thus at this point can claim a net $1.1
billion reduction.
A vote on the defense bill, the largest single
appropriation measure ever put before Congress, is
scheduled in the House tomorrow. The total is some $3.1
billion more than the spending level for fiscal year 1974,
which ended last June 30.
Later in the week, the Senate expects to vote on a
measure authorizing $2.5 billion in foreign aid. The bill is
$725 million below administration requests.
Foundation May Reduce Grants
NEW YORK — The Ford Foundation, the nation's
wealthiest private philanthropic agency, may have to reduce
annual grants by as much as 50 percent because of inflation
and a depressed security market, a spokesman said
yesterday.
Foundation President McGeorge Bundy said the agency
would have to be dissolved by distributing its assets if a
reduction in grants was not implemented.
Seven years ago, Ford's trustees rejected a proposal of
dissolution.
The foundation's assets have dropped from $3 billion to
$2 billion in market value during the past year, the
spokesman said.
A proposal to reduce the $202 million annual budget is
expected to be submitted to trustees at their quarterly
meeting here this week.
The Ford Foundation is a major contributor to programs
at Stanford University.
If approved, the cuts would not take effect for at least a
year, and all current commitments would be honored, the
spokesman said.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except coastal low overcast and
patchy fog inland nights and mornings. Local drizzle near
the coast mornings. Little temperature change. Low tonight
in the 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in 60s along the
coast to mid 70s inland. Westerly wind to 20 mph
afternoons.

of the legislators had resulted in a $1.5 billion spending
increase in the current year's budget.
But they achieved a $2.6 billion spending reduction on
the defense bill, and thus at this point can claim a net $1.1
billion reduction.
A vote on the defense bill, the largest single
appropriation measure ever put before Congress, is
scheduled in the House tomorrow. The total is some $3.1
billion more than the spending level for fiscal year 1974,
which ended last June 30.
Later in the week, the Senate expects to vote on a
measure authorizing $2.5 billion in foreign aid. The bill is
$725 million below administration requests.
Foundation May Reduce Grants
NEW YORK — The Ford Foundation, the nation's
wealthiest private philanthropic agency, may have to reduce
annual grants by as much as 50 percent because of inflation
and a depressed security market, a spokesman said
yesterday.
Foundation President McGeorge Bundy said the agency
would have to be dissolved by distributing its assets if a
reduction in grants was not implemented.
Seven years ago, Ford's trustees rejected a proposal of
dissolution.
The foundation's assets have dropped from $3 billion to
$2 billion in market value during the past year, the
spokesman said.
A proposal to reduce the $202 million annual budget is
expected to be submitted to trustees at their quarterly
meeting here this week.
The Ford Foundation is a major contributor to programs
at Stanford University.
If approved, the cuts would not take effect for at least a
year, and all current commitments would be honored, the
spokesman said.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except coastal low overcast and
patchy fog inland nights and mornings. Local drizzle near
the coast mornings. Little temperature change. Low tonight
in the 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in 60s along the
coast to mid 70s inland. Westerly wind to 20 mph
afternoons.
Hurricane Relief Efforts Slow
SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras — A shortage of aircraft
and fuel slowed down relief efforts yesterday along the
flooded northern coast of Honduras, where hurricane Fifi
left thousands dead and where many survivors still clung to
trees and rooftops.
Dazed Hondurans wandered along washed-out roads or
dug through piles of debris searching for friends and
relatives who disappeared during the storm. Fifi swept
through the region four days earlier with sustained winds of
110 miles per hour and gusts up to 130 m.p.h.
As many American church and civic groups began drives
for food, clothing and medical supplies, the American Red
Cross dispatched disaster specialists to Honduras.
The full extent of the disaster was unknown, but
officials said 5,000 were confirmed dead and 600,000 were
homeless in what the League of Red Cross societies in
Geneva termed one of the worst catastrophes in Central
American history.
U.S. Ambassador to Honduras Phillip V. Sancez reported
there are no Americans believed missing. He said he knew
nothing about reports that some 70 Peace Corps volunteers
had been in the area where the storm hit.
Fifi, downgraded to a tropical storm, continued to blow
itself out against the mountains of Chiapas in southern
Mexico, spreading heavy rains through the area. Eleven
Mexicans were reported dead.
The storm and flooding washed out whole villages along
the Honduran coast. Lt. Col. Muaro Flores Perifin of the
Honduran National Emergency Committee said yesterday
that at least 600,000 persons were left homeless.
Kennedy To Rule Out '76 Bid?
WASHINGTON — Democratic politicians, while
declaring they are in the dark about Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy's surprise announcement of today's press
conference to discuss his political future, said last night
they expect Kennedy to rule out a 1976 presidential bid.
Several said that something must have come up in recent
days to cause Kennedy to move forward an announcement
of his political plans that he previously had said would
come late this year or early in 1975.
"It can only be something of a personal nature," one
high-ranking Democrat said. Several said they expected that
family pressures against a 1976 Kennedy candidacy have
increased.
Close Kennedy associates here, however, said they knew
nothing about the announcement. So did Sens. Walter F.
Mondale (D—Minn.) and Henry W. Jackson (D—Wash.),
who have been exploring 1976 presidential candidacies.
One longtime Kennedy associate cited "the geography"
of the announcement, the fact that it will take place in
Boston, as a sign that Kennedy had reached a negative
decision on a possible 1976 presidential bid.
"If it were affirmative," the associate said, "it would be
in Washington."
Nixon To Enter Hospital Today
LONG BEACH, Calif. — Hospital preparations were
completed yesterday to receive former President Nixon for
treatment of phlebitis in his reportedly painfully swollen
left leg.
Nixon is scheduled to enter Memorial Hospital Medical

Center today for at least three days of care, ending weeks
of speculation on the state of his health.
Varying reports have circulated about Nixon's physical
and mental condition since he resigned the presidency Aug.
25. His former White House physician told an interviewer
that Nixon has refused to enter the hospital because, "If I
go into the hospital, I will never come out alive."
Nixon's care will include anti-coagulant treatments
aimed at dissolving two blood clots resting above the knee
of his left leg. Doctors say they could be fatal if either
broke free and lodged in his heart or lungs.
Congress Cuts Federal Budget
WASHINGTON — Congress has cut slightly more than
$1 billion from the federal budget for the current fiscal
year but appears to have little chance of reaching the goal
of a $5 billion reduction.
Until conferees reached final agreement on the $82.6
billion defense appropriations measure last week, the work
of the legislators had resulted in a $1.5 billion spending
increase in the current year's budget.

days to cause Kennedy to move forward an announcement
of his political plans that he previously had said would
come late this year or early in 1975.
"It can only be something of a personal nature," one
high-ranking Democrat said. Several said they expected that
family pressures against a 1976 Kennedy candidacy have
increased.
Close Kennedy associates here, however, said they knew
nothing about the announcement. So did Sens. Walter F.
Mondale (D—Minn.) and Henry W. Jackson (D—Wash.),
who have been exploring 1976 presidential candidacies.
One longtime Kennedy associate cited "the geography"
of the announcement, the fact that it will take place in
Boston, as a sign that Kennedy had reached a negative
decision on a possible 1976 presidential bid.
"If it were affirmative," the associate said, "it would be
in Washington."
Nixon To Enter Hospital Today
LONG BEACH, Calif. — Hospital preparations were
completed yesterday to receive former President Nixon for
treatment of phlebitis in his reportedly painfully swollen
left leg.
Nixon is scheduled to enter Memorial Hospital Medical

Center today for at least three days of care, ending weeks
of speculation on the state of his health.
Varying reports have circulated about Nixon's physical
and mental condition since he resigned the presidency Aug.
25. His former White House physician told an interviewer
that Nixon has refused to enter the hospital because, "If I
go into the hospital, I will never come out alive."
Nixon's care will include anti-coagulant treatments
aimed at dissolving two blood clots resting above the knee
of his left leg. Doctors say they could be fatal if either
broke free and lodged in his heart or lungs.
Congress Cuts Federal Budget
WASHINGTON — Congress has cut slightly more than
$1 billion from the federal budget for the current fiscal
year but appears to have little chance of reaching the goal
of a $5 billion reduction.
Until conferees reached final agreement on the $82.6
billion defense appropriations measure last week, the work
of the legislators had resulted in a $1.5 billion spending
increase in the current year's budget.
But they achieved a $2.6 billion spending reduction on
the defense bill, and thus at this point can claim a net $1.1
billion reduction.
A vote on the defense bill, the largest single
appropriation measure ever put before Congress, is
scheduled in the House tomorrow. The total is some $3.1
billion more than the spending level for fiscal year 1974,
which ended last June 30.
Later in the week, the Senate expects to vote on a
measure authorizing $2.5 billion in foreign aid. The bill is
$725 million below administration requests.
Foundation May Reduce Grants
NEW YORK — The Ford Foundation, the nation's
wealthiest private philanthropic agency, may have to reduce
annual grants by as much as 50 percent because of inflation
and a depressed security market, a spokesman said
yesterday.
Foundation President McGeorge Bundy said the agency
would have to be dissolved by distributing its assets if a
reduction in grants was not implemented.
Seven years ago, Ford's trustees rejected a proposal of
dissolution.
The foundation's assets have dropped from $3 billion to
$2 billion in market value during the past year, the
spokesman said.
A proposal to reduce the $202 million annual budget is
expected to be submitted to trustees at their quarterly
meeting here this week.
The Ford Foundation is a major contributor to programs
at Stanford University.
If approved, the cuts would not take effect for at least a
year, and all current commitments would be honored, the
spokesman said.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except coastal low overcast and
patchy fog inland nights and mornings. Local drizzle near
the coast mornings. Little temperature change. Low tonight
in the 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in 60s along the
coast to mid 70s inland. Westerly wind to 20 mph
afternoons.
Hurricane Relief Efforts Slow
SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras — A shortage of aircraft
and fuel slowed down relief efforts yesterday along the
flooded northern coast of Honduras, where hurricane Fifi
left thousands dead and where many survivors still clung to
trees and rooftops.
Dazed Hondurans wandered along washed-out roads or
dug through piles of debris searching for friends and
relatives who disappeared during the storm. Fifi swept
through the region four days earlier with sustained winds of
110 miles per hour and gusts up to 130 m.p.h.
As many American church and civic groups began drives
for food, clothing and medical supplies, the American Red
Cross dispatched disaster specialists to Honduras.
The full extent of the disaster was unknown, but
officials said 5,000 were confirmed dead and 600,000 were
homeless in what the League of Red Cross societies in
Geneva termed one of the worst catastrophes in Central
American history.
U.S. Ambassador to Honduras Phillip V. Sancez reported
there are no Americans believed missing. He said he knew
nothing about reports that some 70 Peace Corps volunteers
had been in the area where the storm hit.
Fifi, downgraded to a tropical storm, continued to blow
itself out against the mountains of Chiapas in southern
Mexico, spreading heavy rains through the area. Eleven
Mexicans were reported dead.
The storm and flooding washed out whole villages along
the Honduran coast. Lt. Col. Muaro Flores Perifin of the
Honduran National Emergency Committee said yesterday
that at least 600,000 persons were left homeless.
Kennedy To Rule Out '76 Bid?
