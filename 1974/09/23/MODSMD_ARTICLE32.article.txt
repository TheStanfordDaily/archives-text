## Trustees OK Construction Of Emeriti Row Housing 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Board of Trustees in June approved
construction of a slightly scaled-down version
of the controversial faculty, staff and emeriti
housing development on the Row.
The new development will be an 82-unit
condominium housing project rather than a
100-unit apartment complex as previously
planned.
The project will also only rise two stories
instead of three as first conceived and it is
expected to cost about $3.9 million.
Students voted overwhelmingly last winter
quarter to oppose the project's construction
on the Row and the decision to review the
project or to proceed as planned fell to
President Richard Lyman.
Favorable Recommendations
Lyman approved the project June 11 and
passed it on to the trustees after receiving
favorable recommendations from
Faculty-Staff Housing Director Robert
Summers and Executive Assistant to the
Provost Edward Shaw.
Construction will probably begin next
month and the condominiums should be open
for faculty in the fall of 1975, Summers said.
The project will occupy the site of the old

Stanford Elementary School op, May field
Avenue and the former site of Hurlburt-Grove
house along the Row.
Music department and child care facilities
housed in the school will be relocated,
according to Shaw.
In recommending a go-ahead on the
project. Shaw and Summers surveyed facultx
members on the desirability of the project and
of its location. The survey indicated a market
for 182 households, but was inconclusive on
the location, Summers said.
'Higher Demand 1
Shaw said they settled on the
student-opposed Row site because "every
other site had a higher demand | for another
project | than the emeriti housing project."
Student reaction to the revised
architectural plans, which were made public
during spring quarter finals week, was not
especially favorable, Shaw said.
Students, especially Row residents, had
complained that the project architecture was
"incompatible" with the character of the
student housing on the Row.
Shaw termed the redesigning "passable,"
adding that both the University's and
potential residents' financial limitations
prevented greater embellishment.

ON THE MOVE-House-moving trucks (lower right) prepare to do their job on the Delta Upsilon fraternity house in July. The house now has new
roots in the middle of what used to be Campus Drive, between Stillman-Columbae house and the Beta Theta Pi frat house. University planners deny
that the DU house was relocated to confuse unwary campus motorists, stressing that the move was necessitated by the new Law School construction.
Last year the University had Stillman-Columbae moved, and a similar operation was also performed on Hurlburt house this summer.
