# Shultz Appointed Business Professor
## 
### 
George P. Shultz, former secretary of the
treasury and labor departments, joined
University's Graduate School of Business
(GSB) Sept. 1. His appointment to the
position was announced in June by GSB Dean
Arjay Miller.
Shultz will be affiliated with the University
part-time, as professor of management and
public policy. He is currently executive vice
president and member of the Board of
Directors of the Bechtel Corp. in San
Francisco.
James Van Horn, associate dean of the
GSB, said last week that Shultz's position is a
"quarter-time" appointment. Van Horn said
that it has not been decided if Shultz would
teach a course during this academic year.
Shultz will be used as a guest lecturer in
the master's program and will participate in
various seminars, according to Van Horn.
Shultz, 53, retired in May as treasury
secretary after serving more than five years in
the Nixon Administration. From 1969 to
1971 he served as secretary of labor, later
becoming director of the Office of
Management and the Budget.
In May 1972 Shultz succeeded John
Connally as Secretary of the Treasury. While
at the treasury department, Shultz also served
as assistant to the President for economic
affairs and was chairman of the Council of
Economic Policy, a group Shultz established.
Shultz served here previously, at the
beginning of the 1968-69 academic year as
a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences.
