# Laetrile Users Sue Stanford Hospital
## 
### 
One hundred sixty-six persons are suing
Stanford Hospital and the State Department
of Health, seeking to reverse the ban on the
use of the controversial drug Laetrile.
Although Modesto attorney George Kell
filed the suit in Santa Clara County Superior
Court July 8, he will wait until "probably the
first of the year" to pursue legal action.
Kell said he is "purposely allowing the suit
to lie idle. It will be resumed later as "part of
an overall program to defeat the conspiracy
against health in this state," Kell said.
The suit states that the 166 plaintiffs are
cancer patients who use Laetrile, a drug that
has been outlawed by the state as a cancer
treatment since 1963. The suit seeks to have
the ban declared unconstitutional.
Furthermore, the plaintiffs are either
current or future patients of Palo Alto
physician Dr. Stewart Jones. The suit names
the hospital as codefendant because it is the
only hospital where Jones has physician's staff
privileges.
The suit was prompted in part by the
hospital's refusal to allow Jones to administer
the drug to cancer patient Josephine Bergman
who died July 7. The hospital administrators
acted according to their interpretation of the
state law that prohibits the use of Laetrile as a
cancer treatment, but allows its use as a
dietary supplement.
Bergman had been treated with the drug,
also known as Vitamin 817, for two weeks at
Stanford Hospital.
The treatment was interrupted when
hospital administrators objected, but was
resumed for 10 days when Bergman's
husband drove her to Jones' office for
treatment. Bergman received regular
treatment from March 24, when she was
released from the hospital, until her death.
Jones is currently under investigation by
the State Board of Medical Examiners for

administering the drug to treat cancer. Jones
said he has been "falsely accused," and that
the medication was intended merely as a
dietary supplement.
Most of the 166 plaintiffs probably could
not afford the legal fees, Kell said.
Kell said he will wait until various legal
defense funds can "assure that we will have a
continuing source of income" while litigation
proceeds. Kell estimated legal costs would be
about $5000 a month.
Kell said he will also delay until the
settlement of a suit in Los Angeles involving
another physician who advocates the use of
Laetrile.
Associate hospital counsel Merel Gloubiger
declined comment on the suit.

privileges.
The suit was prompted in part by the
hospital's refusal to allow Jones to administer
the drug to cancer patient Josephine Bergman
who died July 7. The hospital administrators
acted according to their interpretation of the
state law that prohibits the use of Laetrile as a
cancer treatment, but allows its use as a
dietary supplement.
Bergman had been treated with the drug,
also known as Vitamin 817, for two weeks at
Stanford Hospital.
The treatment was interrupted when
hospital administrators objected, but was
resumed for 10 days when Bergman's
husband drove her to Jones' office for
treatment. Bergman received regular
treatment from March 24, when she was
released from the hospital, until her death.
Jones is currently under investigation by
the State Board of Medical Examiners for

administering the drug to treat cancer. Jones
said he has been "falsely accused," and that
the medication was intended merely as a
dietary supplement.
Most of the 166 plaintiffs probably could
not afford the legal fees, Kell said.
Kell said he will wait until various legal
defense funds can "assure that we will have a
continuing source of income" while litigation
proceeds. Kell estimated legal costs would be
about $5000 a month.
Kell said he will also delay until the
settlement of a suit in Los Angeles involving
another physician who advocates the use of
Laetrile.
Associate hospital counsel Merel Gloubiger
declined comment on the suit.
