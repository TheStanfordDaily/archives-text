# County Schedules Local 'Dial-A-Bus'
## 
### 
The Santa Clara County Transit District
will institute "demand response" bus service
to certain campus locations beginning some
time this fall, transit and University officials
said this summer.
University Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said county buses
will offer taxi-like service in fixed areas at
near-regular bus fares. Faculty and staff
housing areas like Frenchman's Hill and San
Juan Hill are covered by the plan. University
Master Planner Oscar Nelson explained.
The closest the service comes to student
residential areas will probably be the
intersection of Campus Drive and Bowdoin
Street, Augsburger said.
Persons desiring bus service will be able to
call a central phone number and buses will be
dispatched to the stop nearest their location
within a few minutes, according to the
county's plan.
A labor dispute between the county and its
transit district bus drivers has delayed the
start of the "dial-a-bus" program, according to
a county transit district spokesman.
The county had established Sept. 16 as its
start-up date for the system, but now
indications point to a late fall-early winter
service initiation.
The county, rather than the University or
the city of Palo Alto, will finance the project
out of gas tax revenue, Augsburger said,
adding, "Whether it proves to be economical
remains to be seen."
The service "clearly does not exclude
students though it is not as convenient as it

might be," Augsburger remarked.
University officials expressed displeasure
this summer with the lack of service to
student areas and are working to increase the
bus coverage.
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer called
the plan "unresponsive to what students are
interested in," suggesting that the best service
for students would be one that "rings campus
and hits the residential areas."
Another bus service, a free bus line from
the campus to Palo Alto subsidized jointly by
the University and the city, has been tabled
pending analysis of the "dial-a-bus" response.
Meanwhile, the ASSU will begin surveying
students about their transit problems this fall,
according to Mayer.
Among the proposals that students will be
asked about is "specialized transit"—like
charter service to the airport at the end of
each quarter.
