# Nurses Win Raise After July Strike
## 
### 
Stanford Hospital's 714 registered nurses
won a new two-year contract with a 15
percent first-year wage hike after an 11-day
strike in July.
Spokesmen for both the nurses and the
hospital said they were pleased with the new
contract, which provides for an additional 8.5
salary increase during the second year.
The strike had forced the 618-bed hospital
to slash its normal case load of patients from
over 500 to just 72.
The nurses had originally demanded a 16
percent wage and a one percent benefit
increase in a one year contract. The hospital
responded with a proposed 7.9 percent
increase, later upped to 9 then 12 and finally
15 percent.
Nurses will also receive an 0.25 percent
benefit increase during the first year,
according to the settlement.
The first-year wage increases will cost the
hospital an estimated $1.2 million, yet Hospital
Deputy Director Paul Hoffman remained
optimistic that the hospital will maintain its
competitive market position and financial
stability.
The nurses strike settlement is partially
reflected in an 11.5 percent increase in
hospital room and service rates announced the
same day as the settlement.
The daily rates are now $100 for a ward,
$108 for a semi-private room and $122.50 for
a private room.
Bonnie Johnson, president of the
Committee for the Recognition of Nursing
Achievements (CRONA) which represents the
nurses, termed the settlement "equitable" and
pointed out that the new salary levels will put
Stanford nurses on a level comparable to
those at similar institutions like the University
of California Medical Center in San Francisco.
The new contract will boost the monthly
salary range for an experienced nurse to
$989-$1193 from $860-$1037.
Hospital officials said they could not make
an estimate of the dollar cost of the
strike-caused cutbacks to the hospital, but one
said it was "substantial."
