# Hewlett Resigns From Trustee Post
## 
### 
William R. Hewlett, president of
Hewlett-Packard Company, resigned from the
University's Board of Trustees July 1. In his
resignation letter, Hewlett said he wanted "to
have a little bit more time to pursue other
objectives."
Hewlett had served since 1963 on the
32-member board. No replacement has yet
been named.

Hewlett became quite unpopular during
the years of campus unrest due to his
association with the military-industrialist
sector. In 1969 he received two telephoned
death threats and in 1971 his home was the
target of a Molotov cocktail, which caused
minor damage.
In other trustee news, Sharon Percy
Rockefeller, daughter of Sen. Charles Percy
(R—111.) was elected by the Board to fill the
position vacated by Tomas V. Jones'
resignation.
Four other persons were elected in
balloting conducted last spring by the alumni
association, succeeding four trustees whose
terms expired in June.
They are Armin Rosencranz, a former
student body president, Mary M. Wohlford,
who graduated from here in 1965; William E.
Ayer, who earned four degrees here; and
Stender E. Sweeney, graduate of the class of
1961.
