# Scientists Appeal: DNA Test Ban
## 
### 
A committee of prominent American
scientists headed by Biochemistry Prof. Paul
Berg appealed to biological researchers in July
to delay experimentation on hybrid DNA
molecules that could accidentally infect
higher organisms and endanger the
population.
Berg, Assoc. Medicine Prof. Stanley Cohen,
Asst. Biochemistry Prof. Ronald Davis,
Biochemistry Prof. David Hogness and seven
others appointed by the National Academy of
Sciences issued a statement in Washington,
D.C. asking for a temporary moratorium on
the use of techniques which permit the fusing
of animal and bacterial genetic material.
These techniques have vast potential
benefit in cancer research and to those
studying regulation of genes in higher
organisms, the committee reported.
But because these techniques have been
developed only recently, researchers are
unaware of the hybrids' effects if released into
the environment, according to the group.
"There is serious concern that some of
these artificial recombinant DNA molecules
could prove biologically hazardous," Berg
said.
Along with the moratorium on hybrid
DNA tests, the group proposed a delay on
experiments which produce antibiotic

drug-resistant bacterial strains and those
which involve DNA introduction from animal
tumor viruses into bacterial cells.
Berg's committee also asked the National
Institute of Health to establish an advisory
group of scientists to evaluate the potential
hazards of this research, to develop criteria for
research and to invent control mechanisms to
limit the spread of dangerous organisms, if
they are produced.
The proposed moratorium would be
voluntary among scientists, Hogness said, and
the committees's proposals were designed, in
large part, to make researchers aware of the
potential dangers, not to regulate research.
