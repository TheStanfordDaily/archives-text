# Murderer Appeals Death Sentence
## 
### 
John Kreuter, convicted murderer of a Palo
Alto woman, is awaiting the outcome of the
appeal of his case to the California Supreme
Court. Kreuter was sentenced to death in July
after being convicted in June for a
kidnap-murder case.
Kreuter, presently in San Quentin Prison's
Death Row, was the second person to be
sentenced under a death penalty law enacted
in 1972. That law makes death a mandatory
sentence for persons convicted of killings
during rapes, robberies or kidnappings.
Liana Hughes disappeared from the
Stanford Shopping Center last January. Her
body was found six days later in her small
motor home found in Burlingame. The
autopsy report said she died of strychnine
poisoning a day before her body was found.
A U.S. Supreme Court decision ruled the
death penalty was cruel and unusual
punishment. The court ruled that the widely
varying sentences for similar crimes caused
death penalty laws to be arbitrary and
unconstitutional.
A 1972 California referendum won enough
support to make the death penalty mandatory
in specific circumstances. The mandatory
clause is believed by proponents of the law to
eliminate the arbitrary nature of the old death
penalty law.
Depending' on the outcome of the appeal,
it is possible that Kreuter's case will go to the
U.S. Supreme Court and become a test case to
determine the constitutionality of the new
California law.
