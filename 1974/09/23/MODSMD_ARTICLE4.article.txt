# Housing Wait List Total Rises 370 From 1973
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Some 820 students, 370 more than
last year, are on the waiting list for
on-campus undergraduate housing,
according to the latest report, Sept. 1,
from the Housing Office.
Students who want to remain on
the waiting list should have
reconfirmed their desire for on-campus
housing by yesterday.
The Housing Office will post new
assignments daily after the revised
waiting list is completed today. If a
student does not accept his
assignment, he will forfeit his place on
the waiting list and must pay a $10
fee, Susan K. Eapinosa, supervisor of
single student housing, said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry N. Horton said there has been a
"dramtically increased desire to live on
campus," explaining that students
want to live on campus for
convenience and for the various
programs associated with the student
residences.
"The costlier and tighter housing
market" has discouraged students
from seeking off-campus housing,
Horton said.
Housing Report
According to a housing report
which Horton and others submitted to
the Administration this summer, home
campus undergraduate enrollment has
increased by 967 persons since
1963-64 while the capacity of
permanent and temporary
undergraduate housing has increased
only 381 places.
To combat the shortage in the short

run, Horton said the University is
trying to utilize on-campus facilities to
the maximum as well as using outside
resources such as the media to find
available off-campus housing.
In the long run, the report
recommended construction of 850
student housing spaces for
undergraduates which will cost
approximately $25 million over the
next seven to 10 years.
Rooms Stuffed
Besides increasing the stated room
capacity in Row houses and in

Lagunita Court, the University has
renovated other houses, such as the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity and Hurlhurt,
instead of tearing them down, Horton
said.
The University added a new house
to the system by remodeling 581
Mayfield.
Also, the University has rented a
floor of a woman's residence at Menlo
College. Only 14 of the 25 spaces
there have been filled so far. The
University will lose "a little money,"
according to Horton, if 15 spaces are
not taken.
Male Visitation
Horton mentioned the male
visitation restrictions and the
mandatory board plan as possible
reasons why women found the Menlo
dormitory undesirable.
Horton mentioned that the Clearing

House, where students on the waiting
list can go to find recent listings of
available off-campus housing, has been
"vastly expanded" to help fight the
off-campus housing shortage.
Horton praised the 15 volunteers
who have spent the last two weeks
finding housing for the 150-200
students who flock to the Clearing
House daily.

Randy Schutt, a Clearing House
volunteer, said that the Clearing House
fills about 40 spaces daily while about
40 new spaces in the community are
made available daily. Schutt said most
students want apartments but they
find that living with families is more
economical.
Lise Pfeiffer, the student heading
the Clearing House, has spent the
summer notifying nearby media of the
critical housing shortage as well as
soliciting 12,000 local faculty, staff
and alumni for spaces in their homes.
The Clearing House will close
Tuesday. Students still seeking housing
should consult June Becker, who is in
charge of the rental housing office in
the Old Union.
Rush For Housing
While there is still a "rush" for
on-campus housing, there will be a
freeze on all residence switches
on-campus, Horton said. He estimated
the "rush" would last for a few weeks.
Speaking of the housing shortage
olf-campus, Dean of "Student Affairs
James W. Lyons said, "1 can't see
where the situation will improve."
He also complained that with the
present system of the Clearing House
and the waiting list, the University
never finds out what happens to
people who drop off the list. The
University doesn't know what kind of
priorities students have in regards to
housing or how far they will go to get
housing.
