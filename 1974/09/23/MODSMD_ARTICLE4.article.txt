# Housing Wait List Total Rises 370 From 1973

### BONNY RODDEN 
Some 820 students, 370 more than
last year, are on the waiting list for
on-campus undergraduate housing,
according to the latest report, Sept. 1,
from the Housing Office.
Students who want to remain on
the waiting list should have
reconfirmed their desire for on-campus
housing by yesterday.
The Housing Office will post new
assignments daily after the revised
waiting list is completed today. If a
student does not accept his
assignment, he will forfeit his place on
the waiting list and must pay a $10
fee, Susan K. Eapinosa, supervisor of
single student housing, said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry N. Horton said there has been a
"dramtically increased desire to live on
campus," explaining that students
want to live on campus for
convenience and for the various
programs associated with the student
residences.
"The costlier and tighter housing
market" has discouraged students
from seeking off-campus housing,
Horton said.
Housing Report
According to a housing report
which Horton and others submitted to
the Administration this summer, home
campus undergraduate enrollment has
increased by 967 persons since
1963-64 while the capacity of
permanent and temporary
undergraduate housing has increased
only 381 places.
To combat the shortage in the short

run, Horton said the University is
trying to utilize on-campus facilities to
the maximum as well as using outside
resources such as the media to find
available off-campus housing.
In the long run, the report
recommended construction of 850
student housing spaces for
undergraduates which will cost
approximately $25 million over the
next seven to 10 years.
Rooms Stuffed
Besides increasing the stated room
capacity in Row houses and in

Lagunita Court, the University has
renovated other houses, such as the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity and Hurlhurt,
instead of tearing them down, Horton
said.
The University added a new house
to the system by remodeling 581
Mayfield.
Also, the University has rented a
floor of a woman's residence at Menlo
College. Only 14 of the 25 spaces
there have been filled so far. The
University will lose "a little money,"
