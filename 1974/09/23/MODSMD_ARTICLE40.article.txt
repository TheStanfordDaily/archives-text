## Public Events Announces Schedule Top Performers Featured On Campus 
### 
Although Public Events at
Stanford attracted only slightly
more patrons than graduation and
a Joan Baez concert in 1973-74,
the 26,900 who attended the
Office of Public Events
presentations resulted in 15
sellouts and a successful season.
The 1974-75 line-up of events
promises to be even better,
according to Tom Bacchetti,
director of the office of public
events. From the perennially
popular Preservation Hall Jazz
Band on October 4 to the Martha
Graham Dance Company on Nov.
26 and 27, the remainder of 1974
features top names in guitar,
dance and song.
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band opened the public events

season last year, and the elderly
but lively group will kick off the
season again at 8 p.m. on October
4 in Memorial Auditorium.
Another act familiar to
Stanford audiences will perform
in Dinkelspiel on October 8 at 8
p.m., the New York Chamber
Soloists. The group features two
voices, two woodwinds, five
strings and two keyboards in
various combinations, with a
repertoire of more than 250
works.
Cleo Laine, John Dankworth
and Ensemble will perform for the
first time at Stanford in Memorial
Auditorium on Oct. 10 at 8 p.m.
Laine's phrasing and four-octave
range have led many critics to
acclaim her as the best singer in

the world. She performs with her
husband, Dankworth.
Spain's first family of the
guitar, the Romeros, will make a
return appearance at Memorial
Auditorium October 24 and 25 at
8 p.m. both evenings.
On November 1 at 8 p.m., the
World of Gilbert and Sullivan will
come to Dinkelspiel. Six zany
English Savoyards will present a
potpourri of the elegant nonsense
of Gilbert and Sullivan's best
works.
The Beaux Arts Trio will
perform in their precise classical
style in Dinkelspiel on Nov. 5 at 8
p.m. Virtuoso clarinetist Michael
Webster will entertain in the
Tressider Lounges on Nov. 8 at 8
p.m. as a part of the Young

Concert Artists Series.
Then the Guarneri String
Quartet will give three concerts in
Dinkelspiel, Nov. 19, 22 and 24.
The Nov. 24 performance will be
a 2:30 matinee, with the other
two dates at 8 p.m.
Fall quarter public events will
close with the Martha Graham
Dance Company on Nov. 26 and
27 at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium. The company will be
50 years old in 1976, and Graham
js still the company's driving
force, although she stopped
performing five years ago.
Student prices for all events are
$2.75. Non-student prices vary
with the event, and tickets for any
performance can be obtained at
the Tressider Ticket Office.

MAMA DON'T DANCE—Maybe your mother doesn't, but many of the 9000 people crowded into Frost
Amphitheater on a sunny summer afternoon last Aug. 3 did as Loggins and Messina played their familiar
songs. The twosome disappointed the crowd who had waited for two hours just to get into the
amhitheater by playing for little more than an hour. Tim Buckley and the San Francisco Strutters helped
ease the long wait. Pictured above are Jim Messina (left) and Kenny Loggins.
