## 'Going Places': Sexual Farce 
### 
George Powell

There's a magazine Penthouse Forum, that
publishes kinky letters about new methods people
have discovered for erotic stimulation. Going
Places is a freneh movie that ties together a series of
erotic, amoral adventures similiar to "Forum's"
letters by two mid-twentyish scoundrels with the
moral philosophy of Screw magazine. Surprisingly
enough, it makes for an entertaining movie, if you
enjoy jokes about getting it up, menstruation,
sodomy and panty sniffing.
The French title for the film, Les Valseuses, is
slang for testicles, which should give anyone a clue
to the tone set by director Bertrand Blier.
The emphasis is strictly on erotic rather than
spiritual love, but the two French rascals,
Jean-Claude and Pierrot, dash through their
adventures with such a merry nonchalance that one
can't help but emphathie (if not sympathize) with
them.
For all their frenetic activity-stealing cars,
evading police and petty robbery while insulting
and fucking their way around France, they remain
two overgrown, lost little boys whose worst fate
would be inability to get an erection. Naturally,
Pierrot is nearly shot in the testicles in the first 10
minutes of the film and spends the first half
worrying about "getting it up" while trying such
exotic turn-ons as sucking milk from a nursing
woman's breasts (which moves her to have an
orgasm). When the woman gets off the train where
all this was going on to meet her soldier-husband,
Pierrot pummels the side of the railroad car in
frustration about his lack of a hard-on while
nursing.
„ If the glimpses of plot so far seem smutty to

some, then forget about seeing Going Places or
reading on. Admittedly, it's a movie that you are
either charmed or disgusted by, with no room for a
middle viewpoint. Some critics have alleged that it
celebrates all that is base in human nature, with its
constant dwelling on sex for pleasure's sake and the
importance of orgasm.
However, the film also shows that these
temporary pleasures, although immediately
rewarding, have little real solace for the spirit.
When the two blithe young men attempt to do
what for them is a good turn, which involves
treating an older woman (Jeanne Moreau in a
cameo role) who has been imprisoned for 10 years
to new clothes and a night of sexual fulfillment, the
morning after turns out to be a disaster,
reminiscent of a gory scene in Ingmar Bergman's
Cries and Whispers.
Blier as director is not above borrowing bits
from other directors and movies, but with style
that integrates these bits into his film's flow, rather
than calling undue attention to the borrowing.
There's a beach scene that comes across as a sad
1970s postscript to Jules and Jim, a hitchhike scene
that's straight out of It Happened One Night, and a
rather Hitchockian scene where the two men are
trying to steal a car in the middle of a field while an
irate farmer in his harvester looms ever closer. The
car won't start, the machine creeps closer, and it's
as if the Keystone Cops had invaded North By
Northwest.
There is a kind of sexual slapstick that pervades
Going Places. with a lot of frenetic simulated
humping, which leaves both men just as insecure at
the end of the film as at the start.

The only difference is that
along the way they acquire a
Marie-Ange, a beauty parlor
worker, who at last learns the joys
of erotic sex while in their
company. The three make a
strange sort of melange-a-trois,
careening around France in stolen
cars, urban sexual guerillas living
off the land which is a
compendium of American-style
shopping centers and bowling
alleys.
Is Western civilization as we
know it dehumanizing, rendering
all values but the drive for sexual
pleasure irreverant and
meaningless? The answer in Going
Places, as it has been in so many
other movies, is yes, but the
answer is delivered in such a crisp,
irreverant and freshly
photographed way that one can't
help smiling. And what's the
difference between a smile and a
leer? That's a point to ponder,
and not answered with certainty
by the movie. What's sexy for one
is sexism for another, and whether
Going Places ends up laughing at
the foibles of the world or leering
at its women will be for each
moviegoer to decide.

SOUNDS OF OLD—The Preservation Hall Jazz Band, shown here during their summer appearance on campus, is back again. Appearing in
Memorial Auditorium on Oct. 4, the band is expected to sell out. Last year, seventeen hundred students packed Mem Aud to hear the sounds of
these great New Orleans performers. Ticket prices will be scaled at $2.75 for students, and at $4.75 for everybody else. Tickets are available at
Tresider Ticket Office.

car won't start, the machine creeps closer, and it's
as if the Keystone Cops had invaded North By
Northwest.
There is a kind of sexual slapstick that pervades
Going Places. with a lot of frenetic simulated
humping, which leaves both men just as insecure at
the end of the film as at the start.

The only difference is that
along the way they acquire a
Marie-Ange, a beauty parlor
worker, who at last learns the joys
of erotic sex while in their
company. The three make a
strange sort of melange-a-trois,
careening around France in stolen
cars, urban sexual guerillas living
off the land which is a
compendium of American-style
shopping centers and bowling
alleys.
Is Western civilization as we
know it dehumanizing, rendering
all values but the drive for sexual
pleasure irreverant and
meaningless? The answer in Going
Places, as it has been in so many
other movies, is yes, but the
answer is delivered in such a crisp,
irreverant and freshly
photographed way that one can't
help smiling. And what's the
difference between a smile and a
leer? That's a point to ponder,
and not answered with certainty
by the movie. What's sexy for one
is sexism for another, and whether
Going Places ends up laughing at
the foibles of the world or leering
at its women will be for each
moviegoer to decide.

SOUNDS OF OLD—The Preservation Hall Jazz Band, shown here during their summer appearance on campus, is back again. Appearing in
Memorial Auditorium on Oct. 4, the band is expected to sell out. Last year, seventeen hundred students packed Mem Aud to hear the sounds of
these great New Orleans performers. Ticket prices will be scaled at $2.75 for students, and at $4.75 for everybody else. Tickets are available at
Tresider Ticket Office.
George Powell

There's a magazine Penthouse Forum, that
publishes kinky letters about new methods people
have discovered for erotic stimulation. Going
Places is a freneh movie that ties together a series of
erotic, amoral adventures similiar to "Forum's"
letters by two mid-twentyish scoundrels with the
moral philosophy of Screw magazine. Surprisingly
enough, it makes for an entertaining movie, if you
enjoy jokes about getting it up, menstruation,
sodomy and panty sniffing.
The French title for the film, Les Valseuses, is
slang for testicles, which should give anyone a clue
to the tone set by director Bertrand Blier.
The emphasis is strictly on erotic rather than
spiritual love, but the two French rascals,
Jean-Claude and Pierrot, dash through their
adventures with such a merry nonchalance that one
can't help but emphathie (if not sympathize) with
them.
For all their frenetic activity-stealing cars,
evading police and petty robbery while insulting
and fucking their way around France, they remain
two overgrown, lost little boys whose worst fate
would be inability to get an erection. Naturally,
Pierrot is nearly shot in the testicles in the first 10
minutes of the film and spends the first half
worrying about "getting it up" while trying such
exotic turn-ons as sucking milk from a nursing
woman's breasts (which moves her to have an
orgasm). When the woman gets off the train where
all this was going on to meet her soldier-husband,
Pierrot pummels the side of the railroad car in
frustration about his lack of a hard-on while
nursing.
„ If the glimpses of plot so far seem smutty to

some, then forget about seeing Going Places or
reading on. Admittedly, it's a movie that you are
either charmed or disgusted by, with no room for a
middle viewpoint. Some critics have alleged that it
celebrates all that is base in human nature, with its
constant dwelling on sex for pleasure's sake and the
importance of orgasm.
However, the film also shows that these
temporary pleasures, although immediately
rewarding, have little real solace for the spirit.
When the two blithe young men attempt to do
what for them is a good turn, which involves
treating an older woman (Jeanne Moreau in a
cameo role) who has been imprisoned for 10 years
to new clothes and a night of sexual fulfillment, the
morning after turns out to be a disaster,
reminiscent of a gory scene in Ingmar Bergman's
Cries and Whispers.
Blier as director is not above borrowing bits
from other directors and movies, but with style
that integrates these bits into his film's flow, rather
than calling undue attention to the borrowing.
There's a beach scene that comes across as a sad
1970s postscript to Jules and Jim, a hitchhike scene
that's straight out of It Happened One Night, and a
rather Hitchockian scene where the two men are
trying to steal a car in the middle of a field while an
irate farmer in his harvester looms ever closer. The
car won't start, the machine creeps closer, and it's
as if the Keystone Cops had invaded North By

Pierrot is nearly shot in the testicles in the first 10
minutes of the film and spends the first half
worrying about "getting it up" while trying such
exotic turn-ons as sucking milk from a nursing
woman's breasts (which moves her to have an
orgasm). When the woman gets off the train where
all this was going on to meet her soldier-husband,
Pierrot pummels the side of the railroad car in
frustration about his lack of a hard-on while
nursing.
„ If the glimpses of plot so far seem smutty to

some, then forget about seeing Going Places or
reading on. Admittedly, it's a movie that you are
either charmed or disgusted by, with no room for a
middle viewpoint. Some critics have alleged that it
celebrates all that is base in human nature, with its
constant dwelling on sex for pleasure's sake and the
importance of orgasm.
However, the film also shows that these
temporary pleasures, although immediately
rewarding, have little real solace for the spirit.
When the two blithe young men attempt to do
what for them is a good turn, which involves
treating an older woman (Jeanne Moreau in a
cameo role) who has been imprisoned for 10 years
to new clothes and a night of sexual fulfillment, the
morning after turns out to be a disaster,
reminiscent of a gory scene in Ingmar Bergman's
Cries and Whispers.
Blier as director is not above borrowing bits
from other directors and movies, but with style
that integrates these bits into his film's flow, rather
than calling undue attention to the borrowing.
There's a beach scene that comes across as a sad
1970s postscript to Jules and Jim, a hitchhike scene
that's straight out of It Happened One Night, and a
rather Hitchockian scene where the two men are
trying to steal a car in the middle of a field while an
irate farmer in his harvester looms ever closer. The
car won't start, the machine creeps closer, and it's
as if the Keystone Cops had invaded North By
Northwest.
There is a kind of sexual slapstick that pervades
Going Places. with a lot of frenetic simulated
humping, which leaves both men just as insecure at
the end of the film as at the start.

The only difference is that
along the way they acquire a
Marie-Ange, a beauty parlor
worker, who at last learns the joys
of erotic sex while in their
company. The three make a
strange sort of melange-a-trois,
careening around France in stolen
cars, urban sexual guerillas living
off the land which is a
compendium of American-style
shopping centers and bowling
alleys.
Is Western civilization as we
know it dehumanizing, rendering
all values but the drive for sexual
pleasure irreverant and
meaningless? The answer in Going
Places, as it has been in so many
other movies, is yes, but the
answer is delivered in such a crisp,
irreverant and freshly
photographed way that one can't
help smiling. And what's the
difference between a smile and a
leer? That's a point to ponder,
and not answered with certainty
by the movie. What's sexy for one
is sexism for another, and whether
Going Places ends up laughing at
the foibles of the world or leering
at its women will be for each
moviegoer to decide.
