# CSN&Y Summer Tour: Good Surprises
## 
### RANDY BAKER 
This was the summer of the
long awaited Crosby, Stills, Nash,
and Young reunion. Like many, I
was skeptical. A figure of $10
million kept popping up, and it
seemed as if the group was on
tour merely for the money. I went
to the show more out of curiosity
than anything else, and I really
was not expecting too much.
Fortunately, I was quite
wrong!

By the second song, "Wooden
Ships," it was apparent that we
were witnessing something very
special. I seemed to have caught
them on an especially good night
(their first night in Chicago), and
David Crosby told us how Chicago
was a very special place for the
group, as they had made their
very first appearance there, and as
they had also broken up there.
On this night, even though the
tour had already been going
strong for two months, it seemed

as if they were being reborn.
Graham Nash was in a really
good mood and took pains to let
us know it. "Did you ever have a
day when you just feel soooo
good, and everything is right?
Well, I'm having one of those
days," he said while jumping
around the stage.
While singing "Word Game"
alone on acoustic guitar, Stephen
Stills worked himself into such a
frenzy that he had to stop and
rest for a couple of minutes

before going into "Suite: Judy
Blue Eyes." "Sometimes," he
said, still out of breath, "you can
get so high from just singing a
song, and it's a higher feeling than
anything you could take."
After "Word Game," Neil
Young raced across the stage to
hug and embrace Stills. On several
occasions the four turned towards
one another and exchanged
soul-slaps.
They played on and on and
on — for nearly four
hours—obviously relishing every
moment of it. That is what made
the concert so unique.
It was good to see, for once, a
show where the group that was
playing was enjoying the show at
least as much as the audience
(which is saying quite a lot,
considering the eight or nine
standing ovations they received
throughout the night).
Crosby, Stills, Nash, and
Young P It was the real thing.
