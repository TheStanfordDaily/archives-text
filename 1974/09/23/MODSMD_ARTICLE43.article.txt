# Special Events Opens With Baez At Frost
## 
### 
Folksingers Joan Baez and her sister Mimi
Farina will perform a Sunday afternoon
picnic concert in Frost Amphitheater on
Oct. 6 at 2 p.m. kicking off ASSU Special
Events Fall concert series. To facilitate the
expected large crowds, entrance gates will
open at noon.
Joan Baez is currently on a Latin
American tour and will return for the fall
performance, her first Stanford appearance in
over a year. She grew up and learned to play
the guitar in Palo Alto. In Palo Alto she also
gained the reputation of fighting to correct
wrongs, donating her money to political and
social causes and setting her own ticket prices
despite the high admissions commanded by
other artists.
Mimi Farina, Joan Baez's sister, first got
her start as a folksinger in Boston coffee

houses. She is the young widow of acclaimed
novelist-poet singer-songwriter Richard
Farina. She is now embarking on a new solo
career.
Joan Baez and Mimi Farina rarely perform
together, but on Sunday they will share the
stage at Frost.
On Saturday, Oct. 19, Doc and Merle
Watson with John Fahey will perform two
shows in Memorial Auditorium at 7:30 and
10:00 p.m.
Doc and his son Merle first performed at
Stanford last spring and had the crowd
dancing in the aisles with the country sounds
of guitar and banjo.
Guitarist John Fahey rounds out the bill
on the show. Fahey is often described as the
original underground musician, and mastered
the techniques of fingerpicking and slide

guitar before this art was recently
"rediscovered."
On Saturday, Nov. 16, pianist Mark
Naftalin will perform a solo recital of blues
and rock in Stanford's Tresidder Large
Lounge. This marks Naftalin's third Stanford
performance in three years and is a testament
to his local following. Naftalin, who has
played with blues guitarist Mike Bloomfield
and local groups, will make his solo Stanford
appearance a rare listening opportunity for
all.
Tickets for the Joan Baez and Doc and
Merle Watson shows are available for $3.50.
For Mark Naftalin they are $2. Tickets are
available at Tresidder box office, Stanford;
all Macy's; Downtown Center box office,
S.F.; Peninsula box office, Los Altos; San
Jose box office, ASUC box office, Berkeley,
and Neil Thrams, Oakland.

Folksingers Joan Baez and her sister Mimi
Farina will perform a Sunday afternoon
picnic concert in Frost Amphitheater on
Oct. 6 at 2 p.m. kicking off ASSU Special
Events Fall concert series. To facilitate the
expected large crowds, entrance gates will
open at noon.
Joan Baez is currently on a Latin
American tour and will return for the fall
performance, her first Stanford appearance in
over a year. She grew up and learned to play
the guitar in Palo Alto. In Palo Alto she also
gained the reputation of fighting to correct
wrongs, donating her money to political and
social causes and setting her own ticket prices
despite the high admissions commanded by
other artists.
Mimi Farina, Joan Baez's sister, first got
her start as a folksinger in Boston coffee

houses. She is the young widow of acclaimed
novelist-poet singer-songwriter Richard
Farina. She is now embarking on a new solo
career.
Joan Baez and Mimi Farina rarely perform
together, but on Sunday they will share the
stage at Frost.
On Saturday, Oct. 19, Doc and Merle
Watson with John Fahey will perform two
shows in Memorial Auditorium at 7:30 and
10:00 p.m.
Doc and his son Merle first performed at
Stanford last spring and had the crowd
dancing in the aisles with the country sounds
of guitar and banjo.
Guitarist John Fahey rounds out the bill
on the show. Fahey is often described as the
original underground musician, and mastered
the techniques of fingerpicking and slide

guitar before this art was recently
"rediscovered."
On Saturday, Nov. 16, pianist Mark
Naftalin will perform a solo recital of blues
and rock in Stanford's Tresidder Large
Lounge. This marks Naftalin's third Stanford
performance in three years and is a testament
to his local following. Naftalin, who has
played with blues guitarist Mike Bloomfield
and local groups, will make his solo Stanford
appearance a rare listening opportunity for
all.
Tickets for the Joan Baez and Doc and
Merle Watson shows are available for $3.50.
For Mark Naftalin they are $2. Tickets are
available at Tresidder box office, Stanford;
all Macy's; Downtown Center box office,
S.F.; Peninsula box office, Los Altos; San
Jose box office, ASUC box office, Berkeley,
and Neil Thrams, Oakland.

REPEAT PERFORMANCE—Joan Baez, shown here at last year's concert in Frost Amphitheatre, returns
again for the Stanford audiences. Her Oct. 6 performance starts at 2 p.m. Appearing with Baez will be her
sister, Mimi Farina. Students who remember Baez' performance last year may recall that tickets were sold
out before the event, and were tough to get on the day of the show. Tickets are priced at $3.50 at
Tresidder. The gates to Frost will open at noon, and since it is festival seating, early attendance is
recommended.
