# Gould, Segal: Easygoing
## Lots Of Gambling In 'California Split' 
### KAREN LACHENAUER 
They sent the wrong person to
review the new Robert Altman
film California Split. It seems you
have to be nigh on to a poker
fanatic to like it.
Starring George Segal and
Elliott Gould, California Split
sports two compulsive gamblers
who lose everything and then
recoup it without much
expenditure of energy in either
direction.
Gould is his affable
self ... unfortunately. Like Segal,
he has been compromised by roles
no longer calling for intensity, in
fact, shunning it, as if riding the

mainstream of American laxity
were infinitely preferable to
showing a little emotion.
Segal's face etches lines around
now-hawkish cheekbones. But it
isn't the strain of race track
exploits that's getting to him, it's
having to be nice all the time. The
actors can't resort to their
penetrating deadpan of
yesteryear. You have to be a
regular guy, you have to be
popular.
California Split is popular. It
offends no one. It sends no one,
either.
The most ingenious moment in
the film comes at the very

beginning, as names stack up on
the screen to the whirr of shuffled
cards. The credits must last five
minutes, subliminally integrated
into a casino scenario.
The rest of the film is limp.
Ann Prentiss plays what the
promotional material
euphemistically calls a
lady-of-the-evening. She and
partner Gwen Welles display
brains and the lack thereof in an
at first pleasant relief to the
classic buddy-buddy tryst. After a
while, however, even this
mechanism wanes into the
undifferentiated mass.
No intrigue. No TENSION.

Gould and Segal go to Reno
and win a record amount of
money so quickly and with such
little suspense you almost miss it.
Then Segal looks discontent and
walks away — after splitting the
take with Gould, of course (this
must be the origin df the
provocative title) — leaving you to
assume a moral message is being
perpetrated.
Possibly, compulsive gamblers
everywhere are recognizing
themselves and standing up in
theater aisles applauding this, "a
movie about us!"
But I think it's indicative of
the film's strength that a
non-gambler was not made the
slightist bit more interested in
gaming.
Most likely, neither would
anyone else.

NO WlN—Elliot Gould and George Segal are shown losing their bet at the track in this scene from
California Split. The comedy is based on two compulsive gamblers who end up losing and winning small
fortunes in actions as diverse as poker, horse racing, slot machines. ... Both Gould and Segal play affable
people (unlike Segal's character in Terminal Man) and come across well. Director Robert Altman
duplicates some effective scenes out of McCabe and Mrs. Miller in some arty poker scenes.

yesteryear. You have to be a
regular guy, you have to be
popular.
California Split is popular. It
offends no one. It sends no one,
either.
The most ingenious moment in
the film comes at the very

beginning, as names stack up on
the screen to the whirr of shuffled
cards. The credits must last five
minutes, subliminally integrated
into a casino scenario.
The rest of the film is limp.
Ann Prentiss plays what the
promotional material
euphemistically calls a
lady-of-the-evening. She and
partner Gwen Welles display
brains and the lack thereof in an
at first pleasant relief to the
classic buddy-buddy tryst. After a
while, however, even this
mechanism wanes into the
undifferentiated mass.
No intrigue. No TENSION.

Gould and Segal go to Reno
and win a record amount of
money so quickly and with such
little suspense you almost miss it.
Then Segal looks discontent and
walks away — after splitting the
take with Gould, of course (this
must be the origin df the
provocative title) — leaving you to
assume a moral message is being
perpetrated.
Possibly, compulsive gamblers
everywhere are recognizing
themselves and standing up in
theater aisles applauding this, "a
movie about us!"
But I think it's indicative of
the film's strength that a
non-gambler was not made the
slightist bit more interested in
gaming.
Most likely, neither would
anyone else.

NO WlN—Elliot Gould and George Segal are shown losing their bet at the track in this scene from
California Split. The comedy is based on two compulsive gamblers who end up losing and winning small
fortunes in actions as diverse as poker, horse racing, slot machines. ... Both Gould and Segal play affable
people (unlike Segal's character in Terminal Man) and come across well. Director Robert Altman
duplicates some effective scenes out of McCabe and Mrs. Miller in some arty poker scenes.
They sent the wrong person to
review the new Robert Altman
film California Split. It seems you
have to be nigh on to a poker
fanatic to like it.
Starring George Segal and
Elliott Gould, California Split
sports two compulsive gamblers
who lose everything and then
recoup it without much
expenditure of energy in either
direction.
Gould is his affable
self ... unfortunately. Like Segal,
he has been compromised by roles
no longer calling for intensity, in
fact, shunning it, as if riding the

mainstream of American laxity
were infinitely preferable to
showing a little emotion.
Segal's face etches lines around
now-hawkish cheekbones. But it
isn't the strain of race track
exploits that's getting to him, it's
having to be nice all the time. The
actors can't resort to their
penetrating deadpan of
yesteryear. You have to be a
regular guy, you have to be
popular.
