# H.M.S. Pinafore Auditions
## 
### 
The Stanford Savoyards, an
informal organization of students,
faculty, staff, alumni and friends
of the University who love the
operettas of Gilbert & Sullivan,
has announced that the auditions
for its fall production of H.M.S.
Pinafore will take place today and
tomorrow, from 7 to 10 p.m.
both nights.
The auditions will take place in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Twenty
men and 20 women are

specifically needed for the chorus
of sailors and "sisters, cousins and
aunts."
The Savoyards advise that leads
should bring music and come
prepared to sing a song from the
show. Orchestra members should
bring instruments and be prepared
to play something. Crew and
production staff are needed.
For further information, call
321-5431 or 321-8888.
