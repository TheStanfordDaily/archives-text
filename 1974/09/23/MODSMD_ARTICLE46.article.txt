### 
The Stanford Daily publishes a section previewing Bay Area
entertainment events each Thursday. Anyone wishing to submit
events for publication in the Daily's Entertainment Spectrum
should type name, kind of event, date, admission cost, organizer's
telephone number and any other pertinent information and place
it in the Spectrum box at the Daily office, Storke Student
Publications Building, by 1 p.m. on Tuesday of the week of
desired publication. Mention of an event in Spectrum does not
guarantee that the Daily will review the event.
