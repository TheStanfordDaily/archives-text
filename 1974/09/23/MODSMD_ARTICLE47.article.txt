# Santana Continues On Downhill Journey
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
SAN FRANClSCO—Winter
land, the perennial Mecca of Bay
City rock 'n' roll, reopened
Friday, September 13, with the
wailing guitars of two extremely
talented homegrown
musicians—Neal Schon and Carlos
Santana.
Indeed, the evening became a
Santana reunion of sorts, with
drummer Mike Shrieve and conga
player Mike Carabello standing in
the wings listening to Carlos
Santana, Schon, Gregg Rolie, Jose
Chepito Areas and Dave Brown
write the latest chapter in the
continuing story of one of San
Francisco's most successful bands.
Since the old Santana band
split up in 1971, various musicians
have performed behind Carlos in
concert. Chepito Areas and Mike
Shrieve stayed with Carlos
performing under the name
Santana, while Neal Schon and
Gregg Rolie formed a new band,
Journey. Dave Brown was
replaced in the Santana lineup by
a younger, less exciting bassist.
Large Following
Journey has gained an
enthusiastic following since its
New Year's Eve debut nine
months ago, despite the handicap
of performing on mismatched bills
with Black Oak Arkansas and
Graham Central Station in two
major appearances. Yet the

problem of introducing what may
be a new genre in rock music is
small compared to the task of
living in the shadow of the
Santana legend.
That Journey is not only living
but growing is proof both that
Neal Schon is a recognizably
brilliant guitarist and that Bay
Area music fans —even the ones
that dig Black Oak
Arkansas—know a good thing
when they hear it.
Fine New Music
Friday's show saw Journey
adding some new material to their
already incredibly strong concert
package with fine results.
"Kohoutek" remains the most
exciting song in their repertoire,
but throughout the set Schon's
guitar and Rolie's vocals
combined perfectly.
After Journey's encore, the
latest band to perform under the
name Santana took the stage, and
it once again became evident that
it was a Santana in name only.
Between the reappearance of Dave
Brown on bass and the loss of
Mike Shrieve on drums, Carlos
had lost more than he had gained.

No one could fault Carlos
Santana's ability to play the
guitar, but somehow he seems to
have lost his desire to play. He
plays small riffs, excellent but all
too short, and things like the
guitar intro to /'Black Magic
Woman" are played by Jules
Broussard on the sax. Carlos
actually plays very little.
In contrast, Schon's guitar is
always there, forming the
presence and body of Journey's
unique sound. Schon's jazzy,
minor scale riffs provide a
delightful musical depth and
variety that is demonstrably not
present in the new Santana sound.
The old Santana sound leaned
heavily on one of the tightest
percussion sections ever formed:
Mike Shrieve on drums, Chepito
Areas on timbales and congas, and
Mike Carabello on congas. Their
sound along with the flaming
guitar riffs were Santana, and with
the departure of Mike Shrieve that
sound may be permanently lost.
Lack Of Precision
Ndugo, the new Santana
drummer, really tried to turn in a
decent solo on "Soul Sacrifice,"

but the precision that marked
Shrieve's famous performances
just wasn't there. Ndugo actually
got out of time, out of rhythm
and ended his spot blowing a
police whistle in a misguided
effort to stir up the crowd.
Some old Santana truths never
change: Chepito Areas is still the
fastest thing on timbales, Dave
Brown is an imaginative bassist
and the old Santana sound still
draws fans to Winterland although
their numbers are dwindling and
the ice palace was far from
packed.
The encore, "Toussaint
L'Overture" perhaps the finest
song ever recorded by the old
Santana, showed the ultimate
problem in recreating the old
sound with inadequate personel—
Neal Schon's missing riffs left
mile-wide holes in Carlos
Santana's closing song.
