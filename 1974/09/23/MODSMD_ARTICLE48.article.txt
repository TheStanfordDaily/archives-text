## Spirited Illinois Decks Flat Cards, 41-7 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Three judgments were being
rendered around Stanford
Stadium Saturday after a
nightmarish afternoon on which
Illinois, unranked and generally
ignored, routed the Cardinals,
41-7.
First, that Stanford's attitude
toward the Illini and other
intersectional opponents in
non-televised games is one aptly
expressed by "who cares?"
Second, that Illinois, with
possibly the finest pass defense in
the nation and a newly potent
running game as well, is a
legitimate powerhouse ready to
challenge for the Big 10 crown.
And third, and most haunting
of all, the possibility, raised first
by Penn State's 7-6 loss to Navy
and supported by Saturday's
disaster here, that "maybe | the
Cards | are not the team 1 thought
they were." The words are Jack
Christiansen's.
Indeed, the thrashing applied
to 11-point favorite Stanford
Saturday left many troubled. Not
the least of these was sophomore
quarterback Guy Benjamin, who
started the game, completed 11 of
15 passes (but threw two
interceptions) and was yanked at
the half in favor of Mike Cordova.
QB Responsible
"I didn't realize his percentage
was that good," Christiansen said
yesterday. The coach added,
however, that he holds a
quarterback responsible for
fumbles on a handoff, such as
happened late in the first quarter
when Scott Laid law was jarred
loose from the ball.
Illini linebacker Dan Hicks
caught that loose pigskin in midair
and raced 11 yards to the
Stanford 16. Illinois scored its
first touchdown three plays later.
Benjamin "hit Laidlaw high" on
the fumble play, Chris said.
The quarterback, however, was
pleased with his performance.
"I thought I had done okay.
Well enough, at least, to stay in

the game," Benjamin told
reporters.
Christiansen said he replaced
Benjamin because "the other team
had a little momentum" at half
which Chris wanted his Cards to
regain.
Illini defensive back Mike Gow,
who intercepted a school record
four passes, looked at the QB
change differently.
"I think it inspired us. When
they switched from a QB who
could have won the game to
someone else, it was kind of iike
saying 'We don't give a damn
about Illinois.' We were pretty
upset—they were taking us a little
lightly."
Passed Well
Benjamin passed well—better
than Cordova had in the first half
against Penn State and certainly
superior to how big number 16
threw in the second half Saturday.
Cordova hit only 6 of 22 and had
three intercepted.
Chris left Cordova in for the
duration, even as the Illini piled
on score after score. He didn't
reinstate Uenjamin because "at
that point I didn't know what
good it would do."
Now Benjamin is afraid he
won't have another chance.
Christiansen plans to start
Cordova this week against San
Jose State and Jerry Waldvogel
against Michigan the week after.
Chris then will select a first string
QB for the Pacific Eight season.
"I don't think it meant too
much to play against Illinois,"
Benjamin said after the game.
"I honestly think the coach has his
mind made up already and that
Cordova will be number one."
Forgetable Game
The quarterback question
aside, Saturday's game was one
Stanford would just as soon
forget.
Things began well enough.
Despite having fumbled on the
previous drive, Benjamin led the
Cards 53 yards to the opening TD
late in the first quarter.

The drive culminated with a
perfect 24-yard loft to wide
receiver Bill Singler for the
touchdown.
At some point thereafter,
momentum changed. Perhaps
Laidlaw's fumble was the catalyst.
Or maybe Stanford's lack of drive
was the key.
Christiansen admitted that he
"took Illinois a little too lightly.
Perhaps there was an emotional
factor. They were up ... we were
down a little bit."
Spark Lost
In any case, the Cards were to
lose what spark they had when an
89-yard drive early in the second
quarter died at the Illini one.
Down 14-7 after Gow
intercepted a Benjamin overthrow
and returned it 38 yards for a
touchdown, Stanford fought its
way uplield.
Benjamin's passing and a
22-yard ramble by Dave Tenn
highlighted the march. However,
with a third-and-goal at the one,
Stanford tried two pitch plays to
Ron Inge. Both gained nothing.
Christiansen said the power
sweep worked well for the goal
line offense in practice last week.
It didn't Saturday.
The definitely Fighting Illini
seized the opportunity. After Mac
McCracken grabbed an aerial
which Benjamin had thrown too
high and Singler had bobbled,
Illinois went 66 yards in 13 rushes
against the vaunted Stanford
defense.
In fact, Illinois' rushing game
was so powerful that it passed
only four more times. Offensive
plaver-of-the-game Jim Phillips
(27 rushes for 126 yards and three
TD's led the ground attack.
Second Half
Stanford went to the locker
room down 21-7 and any hopes
that the Cards would pull a
comeback similar to one against
San Jose State a year ago were
dashed on the second drive of the
third quarter.
After a 17-yard Tom Lynn
punt, the Illini dashed 58 yards to
a score. The defensive line,
anchored by two Ail-Americans,
appeared powerless to stop the
onslaught.
Asked if the Illini offense had
done the unexpected, defensive
end Roger Still well replied,
"Yeah, they held a lot."
Still well said that as defensive
captain he repeatedly complained
about holding to the referees, one
of whom told him late in the
game, "You better get back to
your position or you're gonna be
head cheerleader."

Referring to the Penn State
game the week before when
Stanford fought back from a 14-0
deficit. Still well's partner Pat
Donovan said, "The defense
didn't give up then. I don't know
why we would now. I don't know
what happened."
It was easy for Illinois in the
second half. The Cards
compounded their mistakes with
personal foul penalties, receivers
who had performed miraculously
the week before dropped passes in
their arms and a third-team Illini
quarterback faked defenders out of
their pants.
Bad came to worse when Ray
Anderson fumbled a kickoff out
of bounds at the Stanford two.
The Cards had reached their nadir.
The only way to go was up.
"Confidence and momentum
are the two basic factors,"
linebacker Gordv Riegel said
afterward. "Damn, we better get
that against San Jose State."
Stillwell felt his team was "not
ready to play a full game yet,"
but he was optimistic.
"We have moments of
brilliance, moments of disaster.
Tell the fans not to worry. We'll
be back."

Chris left Cordova in for the
duration, even as the Illini piled
on score after score. He didn't
reinstate Uenjamin because "at
that point I didn't know what
good it would do."
Now Benjamin is afraid he
won't have another chance.
Christiansen plans to start
Cordova this week against San
Jose State and Jerry Waldvogel
against Michigan the week after.
Chris then will select a first string
QB for the Pacific Eight season.
"I don't think it meant too
much to play against Illinois,"
Benjamin said after the game.
"I honestly think the coach has his
mind made up already and that
Cordova will be number one."
Forgetable Game
The quarterback question
aside, Saturday's game was one
Stanford would just as soon
forget.
Things began well enough.
Despite having fumbled on the
previous drive, Benjamin led the
Cards 53 yards to the opening TD
late in the first quarter.

The drive culminated with a
perfect 24-yard loft to wide
receiver Bill Singler for the
touchdown.
At some point thereafter,
momentum changed. Perhaps
Laidlaw's fumble was the catalyst.
Or maybe Stanford's lack of drive
was the key.
Christiansen admitted that he
"took Illinois a little too lightly.
Perhaps there was an emotional
factor. They were up ... we were
down a little bit."
Spark Lost
In any case, the Cards were to
lose what spark they had when an
89-yard drive early in the second
quarter died at the Illini one.
Down 14-7 after Gow
intercepted a Benjamin overthrow
and returned it 38 yards for a
touchdown, Stanford fought its
way uplield.
Benjamin's passing and a
22-yard ramble by Dave Tenn
highlighted the march. However,
with a third-and-goal at the one,
Stanford tried two pitch plays to
Ron Inge. Both gained nothing.
Christiansen said the power
sweep worked well for the goal
line offense in practice last week.
It didn't Saturday.
The definitely Fighting Illini
seized the opportunity. After Mac
McCracken grabbed an aerial
which Benjamin had thrown too
high and Singler had bobbled,
Illinois went 66 yards in 13 rushes
against the vaunted Stanford
defense.
In fact, Illinois' rushing game
was so powerful that it passed
only four more times. Offensive
plaver-of-the-game Jim Phillips
(27 rushes for 126 yards and three
TD's led the ground attack.
Second Half
Stanford went to the locker
room down 21-7 and any hopes
that the Cards would pull a
comeback similar to one against
San Jose State a year ago were
dashed on the second drive of the
third quarter.
After a 17-yard Tom Lynn
punt, the Illini dashed 58 yards to
a score. The defensive line,
anchored by two Ail-Americans,
appeared powerless to stop the
onslaught.
Asked if the Illini offense had
done the unexpected, defensive
end Roger Still well replied,
"Yeah, they held a lot."
Still well said that as defensive
captain he repeatedly complained
about holding to the referees, one
of whom told him late in the
game, "You better get back to
your position or you're gonna be
head cheerleader."

Referring to the Penn State
game the week before when
Stanford fought back from a 14-0
deficit. Still well's partner Pat
Donovan said, "The defense
didn't give up then. I don't know
why we would now. I don't know
what happened."
It was easy for Illinois in the
second half. The Cards
compounded their mistakes with
personal foul penalties, receivers
who had performed miraculously
the week before dropped passes in
their arms and a third-team Illini
quarterback faked defenders out of
their pants.
Bad came to worse when Ray
Anderson fumbled a kickoff out
of bounds at the Stanford two.
The Cards had reached their nadir.
The only way to go was up.
"Confidence and momentum
are the two basic factors,"
linebacker Gordv Riegel said
afterward. "Damn, we better get
that against San Jose State."
Stillwell felt his team was "not
ready to play a full game yet,"
but he was optimistic.
"We have moments of
brilliance, moments of disaster.
Tell the fans not to worry. We'll
be back."

BURIAL GROUND—Several Illini bury Ron Inge (9) on this play, which well illustrates the success
Stanford had Saturday.
Three judgments were being
rendered around Stanford
Stadium Saturday after a
nightmarish afternoon on which
Illinois, unranked and generally
ignored, routed the Cardinals,
41-7.
First, that Stanford's attitude
toward the Illini and other
intersectional opponents in
non-televised games is one aptly
expressed by "who cares?"
Second, that Illinois, with
possibly the finest pass defense in
the nation and a newly potent
running game as well, is a
legitimate powerhouse ready to
challenge for the Big 10 crown.
And third, and most haunting
of all, the possibility, raised first
by Penn State's 7-6 loss to Navy
and supported by Saturday's
disaster here, that "maybe | the
Cards | are not the team 1 thought
they were." The words are Jack
Christiansen's.
Indeed, the thrashing applied
to 11-point favorite Stanford
Saturday left many troubled. Not
the least of these was sophomore
quarterback Guy Benjamin, who
started the game, completed 11 of
15 passes (but threw two
interceptions) and was yanked at
the half in favor of Mike Cordova.
QB Responsible
"I didn't realize his percentage
was that good," Christiansen said
yesterday. The coach added,
however, that he holds a
quarterback responsible for
fumbles on a handoff, such as
happened late in the first quarter
when Scott Laid law was jarred
loose from the ball.
Illini linebacker Dan Hicks
caught that loose pigskin in midair
and raced 11 yards to the
Stanford 16. Illinois scored its
first touchdown three plays later.
Benjamin "hit Laidlaw high" on
the fumble play, Chris said.
The quarterback, however, was
pleased with his performance.
"I thought I had done okay.
Well enough, at least, to stay in

the game," Benjamin told
reporters.
Christiansen said he replaced
Benjamin because "the other team
had a little momentum" at half
which Chris wanted his Cards to
regain.
Illini defensive back Mike Gow,
who intercepted a school record
four passes, looked at the QB
change differently.
"I think it inspired us. When
they switched from a QB who
could have won the game to
someone else, it was kind of iike
saying 'We don't give a damn
about Illinois.' We were pretty
upset—they were taking us a little
lightly."
Passed Well
Benjamin passed well—better
than Cordova had in the first half
against Penn State and certainly
superior to how big number 16
threw in the second half Saturday.
Cordova hit only 6 of 22 and had
three intercepted.
Chris left Cordova in for the
duration, even as the Illini piled
on score after score. He didn't
reinstate Uenjamin because "at

dashed on the second drive of the
third quarter.
After a 17-yard Tom Lynn
punt, the Illini dashed 58 yards to
a score. The defensive line,
anchored by two Ail-Americans,
appeared powerless to stop the
onslaught.
Asked if the Illini offense had
done the unexpected, defensive
end Roger Still well replied,
"Yeah, they held a lot."
Still well said that as defensive
captain he repeatedly complained
about holding to the referees, one
of whom told him late in the
game, "You better get back to
your position or you're gonna be
head cheerleader."

Referring to the Penn State
game the week before when
Stanford fought back from a 14-0
deficit. Still well's partner Pat
Donovan said, "The defense
didn't give up then. I don't know
why we would now. I don't know
what happened."
It was easy for Illinois in the
second half. The Cards
compounded their mistakes with
personal foul penalties, receivers
who had performed miraculously
the week before dropped passes in
their arms and a third-team Illini
quarterback faked defenders out of
their pants.
Bad came to worse when Ray
Anderson fumbled a kickoff out
of bounds at the Stanford two.
The Cards had reached their nadir.
The only way to go was up.
"Confidence and momentum
are the two basic factors,"
linebacker Gordv Riegel said
afterward. "Damn, we better get
that against San Jose State."
Stillwell felt his team was "not
ready to play a full game yet,"
but he was optimistic.
"We have moments of
brilliance, moments of disaster.
Tell the fans not to worry. We'll
be back."

BURIAL GROUND—Several Illini bury Ron Inge (9) on this play, which well illustrates the success
Stanford had Saturday.
Three judgments were being
rendered around Stanford
Stadium Saturday after a
nightmarish afternoon on which
Illinois, unranked and generally
ignored, routed the Cardinals,
41-7.
First, that Stanford's attitude
toward the Illini and other
intersectional opponents in
non-televised games is one aptly
expressed by "who cares?"
Second, that Illinois, with
possibly the finest pass defense in
the nation and a newly potent
running game as well, is a
legitimate powerhouse ready to
challenge for the Big 10 crown.
And third, and most haunting
of all, the possibility, raised first
by Penn State's 7-6 loss to Navy
and supported by Saturday's
disaster here, that "maybe | the
Cards | are not the team 1 thought
they were." The words are Jack
Christiansen's.
Indeed, the thrashing applied
to 11-point favorite Stanford
Saturday left many troubled. Not
the least of these was sophomore
quarterback Guy Benjamin, who
started the game, completed 11 of
15 passes (but threw two
interceptions) and was yanked at
the half in favor of Mike Cordova.
QB Responsible
"I didn't realize his percentage
was that good," Christiansen said
yesterday. The coach added,
however, that he holds a
quarterback responsible for
fumbles on a handoff, such as
happened late in the first quarter
when Scott Laid law was jarred
loose from the ball.
Illini linebacker Dan Hicks
caught that loose pigskin in midair
and raced 11 yards to the
Stanford 16. Illinois scored its
first touchdown three plays later.
Benjamin "hit Laidlaw high" on
the fumble play, Chris said.
The quarterback, however, was
pleased with his performance.
"I thought I had done okay.
Well enough, at least, to stay in

the game," Benjamin told
reporters.
Christiansen said he replaced
Benjamin because "the other team
had a little momentum" at half
which Chris wanted his Cards to
regain.
Illini defensive back Mike Gow,
who intercepted a school record
four passes, looked at the QB
change differently.
"I think it inspired us. When
they switched from a QB who
could have won the game to
someone else, it was kind of iike
saying 'We don't give a damn
about Illinois.' We were pretty
upset—they were taking us a little
lightly."
Passed Well
Benjamin passed well—better
than Cordova had in the first half
against Penn State and certainly
superior to how big number 16
threw in the second half Saturday.
Cordova hit only 6 of 22 and had
three intercepted.
Chris left Cordova in for the
duration, even as the Illini piled
on score after score. He didn't
reinstate Uenjamin because "at
that point I didn't know what
good it would do."
Now Benjamin is afraid he
won't have another chance.
Christiansen plans to start
Cordova this week against San
Jose State and Jerry Waldvogel
against Michigan the week after.
Chris then will select a first string
QB for the Pacific Eight season.
"I don't think it meant too
much to play against Illinois,"
Benjamin said after the game.
"I honestly think the coach has his
mind made up already and that
Cordova will be number one."
Forgetable Game
The quarterback question
aside, Saturday's game was one
Stanford would just as soon
forget.
Things began well enough.
Despite having fumbled on the
previous drive, Benjamin led the
Cards 53 yards to the opening TD
late in the first quarter.

The drive culminated with a
perfect 24-yard loft to wide
receiver Bill Singler for the
touchdown.
At some point thereafter,
momentum changed. Perhaps
Laidlaw's fumble was the catalyst.
Or maybe Stanford's lack of drive
was the key.
Christiansen admitted that he
"took Illinois a little too lightly.
Perhaps there was an emotional
factor. They were up ... we were
down a little bit."
Spark Lost
In any case, the Cards were to
lose what spark they had when an
89-yard drive early in the second
quarter died at the Illini one.
Down 14-7 after Gow
intercepted a Benjamin overthrow
and returned it 38 yards for a
touchdown, Stanford fought its
way uplield.
Benjamin's passing and a
22-yard ramble by Dave Tenn
highlighted the march. However,
with a third-and-goal at the one,
Stanford tried two pitch plays to
Ron Inge. Both gained nothing.
Christiansen said the power
sweep worked well for the goal
line offense in practice last week.
It didn't Saturday.
The definitely Fighting Illini
seized the opportunity. After Mac
McCracken grabbed an aerial
which Benjamin had thrown too
high and Singler had bobbled,
Illinois went 66 yards in 13 rushes
against the vaunted Stanford
defense.
In fact, Illinois' rushing game
was so powerful that it passed
only four more times. Offensive
plaver-of-the-game Jim Phillips
(27 rushes for 126 yards and three
TD's led the ground attack.
Second Half
Stanford went to the locker
room down 21-7 and any hopes
that the Cards would pull a
comeback similar to one against
San Jose State a year ago were
dashed on the second drive of the
third quarter.
After a 17-yard Tom Lynn

Indeed, the thrashing applied
to 11-point favorite Stanford
Saturday left many troubled. Not
the least of these was sophomore
quarterback Guy Benjamin, who
started the game, completed 11 of
15 passes (but threw two
interceptions) and was yanked at
the half in favor of Mike Cordova.
QB Responsible
"I didn't realize his percentage
was that good," Christiansen said
yesterday. The coach added,
however, that he holds a
quarterback responsible for
fumbles on a handoff, such as
happened late in the first quarter
when Scott Laid law was jarred
loose from the ball.
Illini linebacker Dan Hicks
caught that loose pigskin in midair
and raced 11 yards to the
Stanford 16. Illinois scored its
first touchdown three plays later.
Benjamin "hit Laidlaw high" on
the fumble play, Chris said.
The quarterback, however, was
pleased with his performance.
"I thought I had done okay.
Well enough, at least, to stay in

the game," Benjamin told
reporters.
Christiansen said he replaced
Benjamin because "the other team
had a little momentum" at half
which Chris wanted his Cards to
regain.
Illini defensive back Mike Gow,
who intercepted a school record
four passes, looked at the QB
change differently.
"I think it inspired us. When
they switched from a QB who
could have won the game to
someone else, it was kind of iike
saying 'We don't give a damn
about Illinois.' We were pretty
upset—they were taking us a little
lightly."
Passed Well
Benjamin passed well—better
than Cordova had in the first half
against Penn State and certainly
superior to how big number 16
threw in the second half Saturday.
Cordova hit only 6 of 22 and had
three intercepted.
Chris left Cordova in for the
duration, even as the Illini piled
on score after score. He didn't
reinstate Uenjamin because "at
that point I didn't know what
good it would do."
Now Benjamin is afraid he
won't have another chance.
Christiansen plans to start
Cordova this week against San
Jose State and Jerry Waldvogel
against Michigan the week after.
Chris then will select a first string
QB for the Pacific Eight season.
"I don't think it meant too
much to play against Illinois,"
Benjamin said after the game.
"I honestly think the coach has his
mind made up already and that
Cordova will be number one."
Forgetable Game
The quarterback question
aside, Saturday's game was one
Stanford would just as soon
forget.
Things began well enough.
Despite having fumbled on the
previous drive, Benjamin led the
Cards 53 yards to the opening TD
late in the first quarter.

The drive culminated with a
perfect 24-yard loft to wide
receiver Bill Singler for the
touchdown.
At some point thereafter,
momentum changed. Perhaps
Laidlaw's fumble was the catalyst.
Or maybe Stanford's lack of drive
was the key.
Christiansen admitted that he
"took Illinois a little too lightly.
Perhaps there was an emotional
factor. They were up ... we were
down a little bit."
Spark Lost
In any case, the Cards were to
lose what spark they had when an
89-yard drive early in the second
quarter died at the Illini one.
Down 14-7 after Gow
intercepted a Benjamin overthrow
and returned it 38 yards for a
touchdown, Stanford fought its
way uplield.
Benjamin's passing and a
22-yard ramble by Dave Tenn
highlighted the march. However,
with a third-and-goal at the one,
Stanford tried two pitch plays to
Ron Inge. Both gained nothing.
Christiansen said the power
sweep worked well for the goal
line offense in practice last week.
It didn't Saturday.
The definitely Fighting Illini
seized the opportunity. After Mac
McCracken grabbed an aerial
which Benjamin had thrown too
high and Singler had bobbled,
Illinois went 66 yards in 13 rushes
against the vaunted Stanford
defense.
In fact, Illinois' rushing game
was so powerful that it passed
only four more times. Offensive
plaver-of-the-game Jim Phillips
(27 rushes for 126 yards and three
TD's led the ground attack.
Second Half
Stanford went to the locker
room down 21-7 and any hopes
that the Cards would pull a
comeback similar to one against
San Jose State a year ago were
dashed on the second drive of the
third quarter.
After a 17-yard Tom Lynn
punt, the Illini dashed 58 yards to
a score. The defensive line,
anchored by two Ail-Americans,
appeared powerless to stop the
onslaught.
Asked if the Illini offense had
done the unexpected, defensive
end Roger Still well replied,
"Yeah, they held a lot."
Still well said that as defensive
captain he repeatedly complained
about holding to the referees, one
of whom told him late in the
game, "You better get back to
your position or you're gonna be
head cheerleader."

Referring to the Penn State
game the week before when
Stanford fought back from a 14-0
deficit. Still well's partner Pat
Donovan said, "The defense
didn't give up then. I don't know
why we would now. I don't know
what happened."
It was easy for Illinois in the
second half. The Cards
compounded their mistakes with
personal foul penalties, receivers
who had performed miraculously
the week before dropped passes in
their arms and a third-team Illini
quarterback faked defenders out of
their pants.
Bad came to worse when Ray
Anderson fumbled a kickoff out
of bounds at the Stanford two.
The Cards had reached their nadir.
The only way to go was up.
"Confidence and momentum
are the two basic factors,"
linebacker Gordv Riegel said
afterward. "Damn, we better get
that against San Jose State."
Stillwell felt his team was "not
ready to play a full game yet,"
but he was optimistic.
"We have moments of
brilliance, moments of disaster.
Tell the fans not to worry. We'll
be back."

BURIAL GROUND—Several Illini bury Ron Inge (9) on this play, which well illustrates the success
Stanford had Saturday.
