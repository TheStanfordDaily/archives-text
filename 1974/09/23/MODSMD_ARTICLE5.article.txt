# Million-Dollar Losses Close TMU Cafeteria
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER Tresidder cafeteria is no more 
Unwilling to continue subsidizing
Tresidder's retail operations.
University officials closed the cafeteria
Aug. 17. While no decision has yet
been made on what will replace it, a
fast-food restaurant called The
Transition now occupies its space in
Tresidder Memorial Union (TMU).
Tresidder has lost $1.2 million since
1968, according to TMU Financial
Manager Gordon Starr. "Our studies
showed that unless we made
substantial changes, we'd never lose
less than $100,000 a year," he said.
Starr cited decreasing demand and
inflexible labor costs as reasons for the
chronic deficits. Labor costs at The

Transition will be much lower. The
new facility, which will operate for at
least four to six months, employs only
two or three full-time employees,
about 20 other workers being
students.
Some 31 full-time cafeteria
employees were laid off Aug. 17. All
were employees of TDS, Inc., which
ran the cafeteria and now operates The
Transition, Coffee House and The
Commons (formerly the Encina Snack
Bar).
TDS, a private firm, took over
management of the cafeteria from the
University in June, 1972.
TDS made some improvements, and
cut Tresidder's losses from $309,000
in 1972-73 to $156,000 last year, with
the University taking the loss.
But University budget officials
decided that Tresidder had to break
even by 1975-76. because, "we are
unable and unwilling to pour any more
tuition dollars into Tresidder,"
according to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
For financial reasons, the cafeteria
was shut down at the end of summer
quarter, before any decision was made
on an eventual replacement.
Tresidder officials have asked nine
private companies, including TDS, to
make proposals for remodeling of the
cafeteria space. Proposals are due Oct.
17. A student committee appointed by
the ASSU Council of Presidents will
work with Tresidder officials in
formulating plans, Starr said. He said
plans might be implemented within
"four to six months."
Meanwhile, The Transition opened
Friday after an $11,000 remodeling. It
serves an El Camino-like menu of hot
dogs, hamburgers, French fries and
drinks, as well as soup, salad and a
fruit plate.
Opening day reaction to The
Transition was mixed. Caselli said
customers seemed to be pleased with
the food and prices, which are lower
than those of the cafeteria. He called
The Transition "as good or better"
than Mac Donalds.
While some customers agreed,
others criticized the quality of the
meat in the hamburgers. Also, one
student said that the soup "tasted like
it came from the floor of a stable."
Caselli admitted, "We have some
opening day bugs."
Each item on The Transition's
menu is given a academic name. For
example, small, medium and large
hamburgers are called Bachelor's,
Master's and PhD.
Starr admitted that the names are
corny. He said a menu-naming contest
will be held soon, with the winner to
receive a "Tresidder fun package."
The Transition shares the cafeteria
space with Marcel's, a pastry shop run
by the man who prepared the
cafeteria's pastry. Marcel's will
probably continue in operation even

after the transition period is over.
Along with Marcel's and some sort
of restaurant, officials hope to bring
an ice cream franchise such as
Swensen's or Baskin-Robbins onto
campus.'
Tresidder officials also plan changes
in non-food operations. While no
decisions have yet been made, Starr
said that the billiards tables might be
replaced.
