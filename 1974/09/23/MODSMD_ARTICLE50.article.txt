## Let Christiansen Pick Quarterback 
### Vlae Kershner 
If Jack Christiansen is as good a football
coach as everybody said he was prior to
Saturday, he won't listen to the advice that
thousands of laymen and some sportswriters
are offering him on .vho he should play at
quarterback.
The same people who gave Mike Cordova
an ovation wh<-ii he came in during the
second half ag.Mnst Illinois Saturday are now
screaming thit Guy Benjamin, 11 for 15,
should neve.' have been taken out.
And then there are those perhaps a
majority who assert that Cordova, having
played so well against Penn State, never
should have been benched in the first place.
This latter argument is just plain wrong.
Stanford has three fine quarterbacks,
Benjamin, Cordova and Jerry Waldvogel, all
of whom have three years of eligibility
remaining. Somewhere in that bunch is an
All-American who might be able to take
Stanford to a Rose Bowl.
Cordova's good, of course, and right now
he seems to be the most likely choice to
succeed Mike Boryla.
Give All A Chance
Remember, though, these pre-season
games don't mean much compared to the

regular Pac-8 season. In my opinion, playing
the best possible quarterback in these
non-conference games is an irrelevant goal if
there's any chance at all the other guys might
do a better job.
Waldvogel hasn't played yet, but it's
obvious that Benjamin throws a tremendous
spiral at several different velocities. Benjamin
could be a great quarterback, but seems to
lack experience and game savvy.
He hasn't played in two years, which may
account for that unfortunate first quarter
fumble when he didn't put the ball away
before he was hit.
Starters Named
So, how is he ever going to get experience
if he doesn't get in the game? I hope
Benjamin, Waldvogel and Cordova all play in
the next two games, and I think they all will.
(Cordova will start next week against San
Jose State, with Benjamin likely to play in
relief, with Waldvogel starting against
Michigan.)
So let's let Chris play them all and then
decide.
Thus far, the offense has been as good as
could be expected, particularly because
running backs Scott Laidlaw and Ron Inge

got late starts due to assorted ailments.
Of more concern, at this point, is the
defense. Illinois was only able to get 16
points against Indiana, not known as a potent
defensive team. But the lllini ran all over
Stanford.
Big 10 Hits
Illinois defensive back Mike Gow, the guy
who intercepted four passes, said after the
game that "the Big 10 is known as a hitting
league and the Pac-8 isn't. We went out to
really hit them."
I'd never heard before that Pac-8 teams
are made up of pansies, and I don't believe it.
It's more likely that the defensive front
which is made up of experienced
individualists, subconsciously said "why
should we kill ourselves for Illinois."
And really, why should they? Isn't
football supposed to be fun? Is there
anything wrong with Stanford or anyone else
not giving every extra iota of effort every
non-conference game, as long as the team
tries moderately hard?
Why don't we just refund half the money
of any fan who wants it back, and forget the
Illinois game forever.
