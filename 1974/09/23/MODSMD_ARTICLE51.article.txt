# Last-Ditch Penn State Drive Ruins Stanford Debut
## 
### 
By VLAE KERSHNER
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa.-In
most respects, Stanford's opening
game trip to Penn State was an
unqualified success.
Stanford made a bundle on the
game ($103,000 in TV rights
alone). The team, band and fans
got a chance to see Pennsylvania's
verdant Happy Valley. And the
Cardinals played a good,
entertaining football game.
In fact, a victory would have
made the weekend perfect.
After capturing the lead from
the ninth-ranked Nittany Lions
during a brilliant fourth quarter
charge, Stanford fell victim to a
well-run Penn State drive and lost

24-20.
The game didn't start
auspiciously. Minutes before the
kickoff, ABC-TV stalled
Stanford's entrance onto the field,
and the Cards spent a nervous
quarter-hour in the runway.
Eaise Does It
For awhile, it looked as if they
should have stayed there. On the
Lions' first series, Jim Eaise ran
through the Card defense on a
punt return and two rushes. Soon
Penn State led 7-0.
Penn State scored another
touchdown early in the second
quarter. Meanwhile, the Cardinal
offense did nothing, as sophomore
quarterback Mike Cordova seemed

to aim for the ground and the
Goodyear blimp.
Later, Cordova admitted "I
was a little tight in the first half
and couldn't throw well." But
those jitters disappeared sometime
in the second quarter, and from
then on, the Stanford passing
game was as effective as it has
been since the days of Jim
Plunkett.
Cordova, calling most of the
plays within the bounds of a
well-conceived game plan, mixed
up 51 aeriels to seven receivers
who were constantly in the clear.
Fanatic Freshmen
By halftime, Stanford was
within four points. The Cards
couldn't score in the third quarter
due to a gusty head wind and the
presence of hordes of fanatic
freshmen, who overwhelmed the
offense with sound waves when it
approached the Lion goal line.
By this time, the TV viewers
might have thought they were
tuned to "Mike Cordova Vs.
the 58,000 Blue Monsters." But it
wasn't that simple. Stanford
stayed close only because of a
great defensive effort, sparked by
All-America end Roger Still well.
After reviewing the films,
defensive line coach Gunther
Cunningham called Still well's
performance "his best ever." And
the Card coaching staff changed
its defensive player of the game
nomination from Doc Blanchard
(who made two first half
interceptions, one a leaping grab)
to Still well. after reviewing the big
guy's obscure efforts.
Fourth Quarter
In the fourth quarter, with
wind and freshmen at their backs,
the Card offense ran over Penn
State for a touchdown. Eric Test
made the TD catch on a quick
streak pattern when he faked the
defensive back halfway into the
Susquehanna River.
The Cards, now tied at 17-all,
quickly got the ball back. Cordova
hit three quick passes. On the
third of these, Ron Inge zoomed
into the endzone. A disputed
clipping penalty nullified the

touchdown, however, and
eventually Stanford settled for a
Mike Langford field goal.
This 20-17 lead held up less
than two minutes. Lion
quarterback Tom Shuman
shrewedly mixed sharp passes
with deceptive runs. Penn State
scored the winning touchdown on
a one-yard run after a pass
interference call against Rich
Waters in the endzone.

Cardinal Notes: Cordova broke
stadium records for passes
attempted (51) and passing
yardage (301), and tied the
completions record (23). For his
efforts, Cordova was named
Northern California and Pacific

Eight plaver-of-the-week.
Langford, whose kicks
followed a trajectory normally
associated with a slingshot, hit
two of four field goals and thinks
that a third was good . . . Coach
Jack Christiansen bitterly
chastised the officiating after the
game, but seemed pleased with his
team's play.
Punter Tom Lynn may have
been shaky at the start, fearing a
repeat of his 1973 debacle against
Penn State, but soon overcame
any jitters for a respectable 39.7
average . . . Stanford will play at
Penn State the next two seasons,
and the matchup is proving so
successful that another series is
being scheduled for the 1980s.

PICTURE PERFECT PROTECTION—Stanford quarterback Mike Cordova (16) was well supported by his offensive line in the team's debut
against Penn State Sept. 14. Scott Laidlaw (33), Tom Tipton (62) and Alex Karakozoff (67) all made blocks on this play, as linebacker Chris
Devlin (66) leaps vainly, a safe distance away from Cordova.
