# Pac-8 Roundup
## Bruins Break Iowa Skein 
### 
Diehard Pae-8 followers are
quietly sneaking out of sight after
the second straight weekend of
poor inter-conference play. While
Stanford was being thrashed at
home by Illinois, UCLA and
Oregon State had to travel to such
exotic places as lowa City and
Columbus, Ohio to drop their
games.
The other four Pac-8 teams
playing (USC had a bye for the
weekend to salve its Arkansas
wounds)al! won at home,although
each game was decided by a
touchdown or less.
UCLA broke lowa's 12 game
losing streak by faltering to a
21-10 loss. The Bruins started the
game as 21 point favorites, but
after their momentary 3-0 lead
becameal4-3 deficit,they fumbled
their chances of victory away with
four turnovers. The Bruins came
within four points of lowa before
the Hawkeyes iced the game with
the last touchdown of the game.
Also traveling, and losing, was
Oregon State. Ohio State used the
Beavers as practice dummies, as
they sharpened their offensive
skills on the hapless Beaver
defense. The Buckeyes rushed for
386 yards over the Beavers and six
touchdowns.
Cal had a tough time at home,
depending on a final minute
conversion kick for the margin of
victory over a tough San Jose
State team. The Golden Bears
came back from a 13-3 deficit in
the final quarter to edge the
Spartans, 17-16. Cal quarterback
Steve Bartkowski put on his own
show by fumbling the ball five
times.
The teams playing in the
Northwest all squeaked out
victories.
Washington showed a
surprisingly strong running attack

in its 31-28 win over lowa State.
The Huskies rushed for 331 yards,
146 of which came from Willie
Hendricks. lowa State started the
game on a sour note when their
starting quarterback twisted his
knee on the first play from
scrimmage and was sidelined for
the remainder of the contest. The
Huskies held off a late rally to
maintain the victory.
Washington State's 17-10
victory over Idaho gave the
Pullman fans a little weekend
excitement. All the Idaho scoring
came in the first quarter, and all
the WSU scoring came in
the second. The rest of the game
was highlighted by most of the
game's 11 penalties.
Playing in 90 degree weather in
Eugene, Oregon put out a fourth
quarter burst to overcome Air
Firce, 27-23. Rick Kane scored
both fourth quarter touchdowns
to put the Ducks in front for
good. Kane's second touchdown
came with less than two minutes
to play, and it looked as if Oregon
had it locked up, but the Falcon's
quarterback gave it a great effort.
With 26 seconds to go, the
Falcons were at the Oregon 17
when Oregon safety Steve
Donnelly snared an interception
at the four yard line to secure the
win.
