# Hencken, Whit, Robby Lead Summer Card Charge
## 
### 
While most of us were working, sleeping
and wishing we could be at Stanford without
having to go to school, a few Stanford
athletes, while not foregoing the above three
activities, accomplished more tangible feats,
some of which follow.
Baseball
Stanford baseball players enjoyed good
summers on semiprofessional teams.
Particularly noteworthy was the
performance of Bruce Robinson. Robinson hit
four home runs in the National
Semiprofessional Championships at Wichita,
Kansas, to lead the tournament. His
Fairbanks, Alaska, team, won the national
crown, and Robinson was named to the
All-Tournament team. He led the team with
10 home runs during the regular season,
compared to none for the Cards last year.
Robinson played catcher for most of the
summer, a departure from his normal spot in
the Sunken Diamond outfield. Coach Ray
Young said he'd give Robinson a chance to
play at catcher this coming season.

This possibility seems especially likely
because last year's catcher, Dave Baker,
played mostly in the outfield for Anchorage,
Alaska. Baker hit over .300 this summer.
Shortstop Steve Davis also starred for
Anchorage, leading the team in hitting the
RBl's. Davis was named the team's most
valuable player.
Gary Pitchford, elevated to the varsity as a
frosh last' season, hit .384 for his Pueblo,
Colorado team, while Kevin Sullivan also hit
over .300 for Pueblo. Pitcher John Yandle
joined Pueblo late in the year and played well.
Young also announced the signing of
several top recruits, although recruiting was
marred by the loss of several stars, who signed
with major league teams.
Among the new players for next year are
football players Ray Cardinalli and Tom Pike,
star first basemen Randy Wong and Tom
Guardino, and infielders Dave Thompson,
Kevin Triggs and Dave Perez.
The Cards will play in the Pac-8 Southern
Division again next year. Young said there was
a possibility the division winner might go
directly to the District Eight playoffs, instead

of first having a playoff with the Northern
Division champion.
Basketball
Ask Rich Kelley to name the toughest
player he's ever competed against and he's
likely to say Bill Walton. But if you ask him
to expand that list, the top 10 could very well
include names like Lin Ping-huo, Alexander
Salnikov, Ivan Yedeshko and Kresimir Cosic.
Kelley, Stanford's 7-foot center who has
twice earned All-Pacific Eight recognition,
spent the summer of '73 touring the People's
Republic of China with a United States
All-Star team.
This past summer, he gained further
international experience representing the U.S.
at the World Basketball Championships at San
Juan, Puerto Rico, in July, and competing in a
six-game series against the U.S.S.R. in early
September.
In both events, Kelley averaged about
seven points and seven rebounds a game, far
below his Stanford averages of 18.4 and 12.5.
Kelley started at center for both teams,
however, and was used primarily as a
screening and passing pivot man.
The U.S. finished second in the World
Championships, winning nine straight games
before losing a hotly contested final game to
the Russians by seven points. The Americans
gained revenge in the September series,
winning five of six games played at various
locations across the U.S.
Golf
Stanford's golfers met similar fortune
individually this summer as they did as a team
during the NCAA championships in June.
Their performances were good when looked at
objectively, but disappointing when viewed in
their proper perspective.
The Cardinal golfers, who scored a
convincing team victory in the Pacific Eight
tournament in May, played far below their
vast potential at the NCAA's a month later,
finishing a respectable but disappointing 16th.
Only Dave Baskins and Aly Trompas, who
placed 36th and 42nd respectively, survived
the 36-hole cut.
Following the NCAA's Baskins was named
a third-team All-American, while Trompas
earned honorable mention.
Later in the summer, sophomore Brent
Murray highlighted Stanford's individual
efforts with an impressive victory in the
Oregon Amateur. Murray defeated Glen
Luikart 4 and 3 in the 36-hole final, shooting
32 on the back nine of the morning round to
build a comfortable lead.
Senior Conrad Nilmeier was one of 16
finalists in the California Amateur, but lost in
the first round of match play. Baskins and Jay
Johnston, who will transfer here this fall from
Menlo College, both qualified for the U.S.
Amateur but suffered first round match play
defeats. Baskins was also runnerup in the
Nevada Amateur.
Two incoming freshman also played well
this summer. Mike Peck of Kansas City, Kan.,
reached the quarterfinals of the Missouri
Amateur, while Lyn Pittinger of Oklahoma
City, Okla., advanced to the quarterfinals of
the prestigious Trans-Mississippi Amateur.
Pat Cornet, Stanford's top woman golfer,
finished eighth last June in the NCAA
Women's "B" division, shooting 333 for 72
holes.
Swimming
Junior John Hencken set a pool of
swimming records as he and freshman

teammate Mike Bruner, made significant leaps
in their swimming careers this summer.
Hencken established two world records at
the Concord, California dual meet against East
Germany on Sept. 1. Hencken's world marks
came in the men's 100 and 200-meter
breastroke events as he finished with first
place and world record clockings of 1:03.88
and 2:18.21, respectively.
The second part of the one-two Cardinal
combination, Mike Bruner, placed second in
the men's 400 and 1,500 freestyle categories
with times of 4:00.89 and 15:49.93.
The previous week, at the 1974 AAU
National Long Course Championships also at
Concord, Hencken established the American
record in the men's 200-meter breastroke in
2:19.53 while setting a new meet record in
the men's 400-meter freestyle with a time of
3:58.59.
In the women's division, incoming
freshman Ann Brodell made her presence
known at the A.A.U. National Swim Meet
August 22-25 in Concord. Brodell finished
fifth in the 1500 free with a time of 17:02.38
and 10th in the 400 with a 4:21.73. Janet
Stewart, another incoming freshman, also
performed well.
Teammate Vicki Hays, a sophomore,
finished fifth in the consolation finals of the

200 breast at 2:46.41.
The women's team, 11th nationally last
year, hopes to enter the top five this year.
Practice begins with a meeting this
Wednesday.
Tennis
Stanford tennis players enjoyed a
moderately successful summer after winning
the NCAA championships for the second
straight time this June.
NCAA singles champion John Whitlinger,
who'll be a junior this year, played
"consistently well," although he scored no
major tournament victories, according to
coach Dick Gould.
Whitlinger and doubles partner Jim
Delaney, who surprised everyone by taking
the NCAA doubles title, continued their
winning ways in the summer. The pair beat
two of Americas finest doubles players. Bob
Lutz-Marty Reissen, in the semifinals of the
Western Tennis Championships in Cincinnati
before losing to Dick Dell-Sherwood Stewart
in the finals.
Incoming recruit Bill Maze scored a major
tournament win, upsetting Billy Martin, the
King of junior tennis and a UCLA signee, in
the semifinals of the National Juniors in
Kalamazoo, Michigan. Maze lost, however, to
UCLA's Ferdi Taygan in the finals. Stanford's
other two recruits are Perry Wright and Peter
Morris.
The three recruits will join Stanford's
contingent of fine players who will try for a
third straight NCAA championship this spring.
Only one team member left for the pros;
Chico Hagey, who finished second to
Whitlinger at the NCAA's. Hagey decided to
forego his senior year of competition because
he felt he was ready for the professional game
after great performances at the NCAA's and
National Amateur Grass Court
Championships, which he won.
Hagey's loss is offset, however, by the
return of Pat DuPre. DuPre seems fully
recovered from tendonitis in his wrist, which
sidelined him for the latter half of last season.
Other returning players include Delaney
and Nick Saviano, both of whom are
All-Americans,Gene Mayer, Mark Mitchell and
Chip Fisher.
Meanwhile, Stanford alumnus Roscoe
Tanner played the best tennis of his life,
beating Stan Smith en route to the semifinals
at Forest Hills. Tanner, a big-serving
southpaw, lost to the world's greatest player,
Jimmy Connors, 7-6, 7-6, 6-4 in the nationally
televised semis. Tanner has beaten John

Newcombe, Hie Nastase and Arthur Ashe this
year.
Sandy Mayer met with somewhat less
success, bowing out early at both Wimbledon
and Forest Hills, Mayer compiled a so-so
record with the New York Sets of World
Team Tennis this summer.
On October 3-5, Stanford will send four
players to the Braniff International Collegiate
Tennis Invitational at S'MU. Two women
players, Andrea Barnes and Bracey Macnair,
and two men, who have not yet been named,
will represent the Cards against seven other
schools.
Track
While none of the members of the Stanford
track team competed in AAU championship
or other world class meets, track coach
Payton Jordan was very busy over the
summer.
No. Jordan didn't set any more senior
sprint records. What he did was go out and
recruit what many are calling the finest group
ever to come to the Farm. It includes three
California state champions—high school long
jump titleist James Lofton of Washington
High School in Los Angeles, JC pole vault
champion Robert Flint of Fresno City
College, and quartermiler Alan Sheats, who
ran a leg for Pasadena's John Muir High
School's state championship mile relay team.
Lofton won the state prep meet with a
long jump of 24-4 and then went on to
capture the Golden West Invitational with a
24-9'/2 effort. He has also high jumped 6-4 and
has been clocked at 47.8 in the 440. He's now
playing football.
Flint vaulted 16-6V2 to win the California
state JC Championship, setting a new state
record in the process. Sheats' bests are 9.8 in
the century and 47.6 in the 440.
Another top prospect is John Foster, a
hurdler from Foothill Junior College who
placed in the State JC meet in both the highs
and intermediates. His best is 14.1 in the 120
highs.
