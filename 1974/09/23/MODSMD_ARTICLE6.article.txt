# GOP Candidates At Frosty; Flournoy Criticizes Brown
## 
### 
Appearing on campus for the first
time since he won the Republican
gubernatorial nomination, State
Controller Houston L. Flournoy
yesterday said his opponent's
"credibility is going to be one of the
major issues" in the campaign.
Flournoy and Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr. (R—Menlo Park), spoke
to 150 people in Frost Amphitheater
at a rally sponsored by the local
chapters of the California Republican
League. Also appearing at the rally
were local state Senate candidate
James R. Tormey Jr. and
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett.
According to Flournoy, Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Edmund G.
Brown Jr. and his campaign manager.
Tom Quinn, "have been taking turns
straddling the issues. It's becoming
increasingly difficult to tell who the
candidate really is."
Flournoy said "their turn-abouts
are primarily because of the political
heat" generated by Brown's original
stands on issues such as the need for a
tax increase, the desirability of having
a unicameral legislature and the future

of the multi-million dollar pension
bonus for defeated lawmakers.
"I don't know what the issues of
the campaign are going to be,"
Flournoy said, because "it's hard to
make an issue" when Brown reverses
his position so frequently.
President Ford's pardon of Richard
Nixon was, in Flournoy's opinion,
"premature" and inappropriate "until
all the facts were in." Flournoy noted
that the pardon had "put a little bit of
a damper on things in our campaign
for a while," but added that he did not
expect it to have an impact on the
election.
McCloskey also attacked the
pardon, calling it one of "two serious
errors in judgment" by Ford since he
took office. He criticized Ford's recent
defense of the United States' "right to
interfere" in the internal affairs of
other nations.
The congressman credited students
here for providing him with the margin
of victory- in his narrow primary
victory over conservative businessman
J. Gordon Knapp, who is now working
for the Flournoy campaign.
