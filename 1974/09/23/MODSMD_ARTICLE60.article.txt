# Wrestler Killed

Jim Tatarakis, a two-year letterman on
the varsity wrestling team, was killed in
an automobile accident August 9.
Tatarakis was returning to his home
at 4 a.m. when his car crossed over the
center line onto the opposite shoulder of
the road and apparently skidded
sideways, crashing into a metal pole,
which split the car in half.
Tatarakis was removed from the car,
but was pronounced dead on arrival at
the local hospital. The official police
report said Tatarakis had fallen asleep at
the wheel.
Wrestling coach Joe DeMeo said
yesterday that the whole team was "going
to miss him. He was a member of our
family," DeMeo said of the 126-pound
competitor.
"He showed good improvement"
during his two years with the team and
was "looking forward to this season," he
added.
DeMeo described Tatarakis as a person
who "felt things deeply. Things really
mattered to him," DeMeo added.
