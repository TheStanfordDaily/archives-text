## Printing Debt Closes 'Chaparral' 
### 
ASSU Financial Manager Frank Olivieri
closed down the Stanford Chaparral in July
by freezing the "Chappie's" ASSU financial
account and rekeying the publication's office
doors.
The Chaparal faces current debts totalling
$2194 and the ASSU faces an additional loss
of $1107 because of the Chaparal, according
to Olivieri. Only $330 remains in the
publication's account, he said.
Olivieri said in July that he will propose to
the ASSU Publications Board that they force
the "Chappie" to close up shop temporarily
this year.
He later suggested that the weekly features
magazine be placed into receivership with the
Pub Board as its guardian. By closing the
"Chappie" down, Olivieri said, the Pub Board
would be able to help the publication
reorganize its management.
Olivieri also charged that Chaparral Editor
Mark Lee had personally misused office space
and had endangered the University's tax
exempt status by allowing non-student
publications to work in the "Chappie" offices.
The Chaparral is published by the
Chaparral Chapter of the Hammer and Coffin
National Honorary Humor Society, a secret
club, as a feature magazine for Stanford
students.
The publication is financed in large part by
grants from the ASSU Pub Board.
