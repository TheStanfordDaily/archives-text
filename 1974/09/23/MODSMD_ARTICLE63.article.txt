# Post Office Builds 1680 New Boxes
## 
### 
The United States Postal Service
constructed 1680 new mailboxes on the south
side of the campus post office in August in
order to alleviate the mailbox shortage.
Palo Alto Postmaster James Hodgen
attributed the construction to the "demand
on the part of the students to get their mail."
About 500 students were left without
boxes last fall when they discovered that all
5300 of the Postal Service's boxes had already
been rented. The Postal Service has no control
over who rents boxes and according to
October, 1973 records from the registrar's
office, non-students had rented 1350 of the
5300 boxes.

There is no shortage now, however. In fact,
there are at least 1000 unrented boxes,
William DeMers, Station Superintendant of
the Postal Service's Stanford branch, stated.
Hodgen estimated that the Postal Service
paid nearly $18,000 for the materials— the
boxes and keys— to construct the 8 by 31 feet
building. Plant Services Director Dan
DeYoung said the University spent
approximately $3000 for labor and additional
construction costs.
DeMers expects the Postal Service to raise
its rent rates soon but not before next
quarter. He said the rate hike has nothing to
do with the new construction.
