# Summer News Notes

Law Prof. Byron D. Sher was elected
mayor of Palo Alto on July 1 by the City
Council. It took council members 37 votes to
give Sher the necessary majority of the nine
persons.
Sher's principal competition during the
balloting was councilwoman Enid Pearson,
who served as vice mayor until the July
election. Sher and Pearson are both members
of the liberal "residentialist" majority.
Sher, 45, was elected to a four-year
council term in May, 1973, receiving the
largest vote total of 16 candidates for five
four-year terms.
Sher had previously served on the Council
in 1965-1967, before being one of four liberal
members removed from office during a stormy
recall election.
Alan Henderson, also a residentialist
member of the council, was elected vice major
on the third ballot following the mayoral
election. He had openly supported Pearson for
mayor, and was the only expressed candidate
for vice mayor.
Henderson and Sher will serve one-year
terms.

In its final session of the academic year,
the Faculty Senate decided that individuals
denied tenure should have the right to request
a summary of the rationale for the decision
within 60 days after they are informed of the
outcome.
Those denied tenure will also have at least
one year to find employment elsewhere and
department chairmen will annually offer to
confer with non-tenured faculty to review
their performance in teaching and scholarship.

The approved proposals were among the
recommendations in the Report on the
Professoriate. Action on remaining
recommendations will begin when the Faculty
Senate convenes this quarter.
The package of porposals is designed to
tighten up procedures followed in tenure
decisions.

Stanford's Professional Journalism Fellowship
program. The gift will establish and endow the

approaching middle-management level
positions in the news media.

Department of Communication and
Journalism for 27 years. Gannett was the
founder of a newspaper chain bearing his
name.

University for three to nine months of study.

management.
President Richard W. Lyman said last week
that $186,500 of the gift will be shared
between the Schools of Business, Earth
Sciences and Engineering, with the remaining
$20,000 given unrestricted to the University.
In the School of Business, the Foundation
gift will be used for fellowships with the
preference for minority students and for
support of faculty research.
In Earth Sciences fellowships will be
awarded in the fields of petroleum
engineering, geophysics and geology. In
Engineering, the gift will provide fellowships,
teaching and research support as well as a
special annual guest lectureship in chemical
engineering.
