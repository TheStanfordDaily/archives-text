Unwary students returning to the Stanford campus this
week are likely to discover several significant changes.
The major surprises include final approval of an 82-unit
condominium project for faculty, staff and emeriti on the
Row, and the decision to close Tresidder cafeteria and
replace it with an El Camino-like fast food restaurant.
The decisions themselves were not altogether surprising,
and they could quite possibly benefit a large segment of the
Stanford community. The disturbing fact is that once again
important University decisions affecting students were
handed down while few students were around to protest.
President Lyman's decision to give the emeriti housing
project his go-ahead came after a meeting Tuesday, june 11,
the next-to-last day of spring quarter finals. Although
University officials made minimal attempts to solicit student
reaction during finals week, the bulk of the student body
was immersed in study for final exams or had already left
for the summer.
Disregard for student input into the decision-making
progress was even more flagrant in the Tresidder decision,
which was made without any consultation with those
persons affected by it.
These are not isolated instances. Rather, they fit
perfectly in a disturbing pattern of crucial decisions made
during quarter breaks or finals week—times when student
response is practically non-existent.
Other notable determinations made essentially covertly
included the.shift of the black theme house from Roble to
Lagunita last spring and the March, 1972, suspensions of
four students, the so-called "placement center four," for
disruption of recruiting activities.
The list could go on and on. These "surprising" decisions
on issues surrounded by student opposition might suggest to
some a grand University conspiracy to delay any
controversial decision until finals week or vacations. At
least, it seems that the administration is often more
interested in preventing student input than encouraging it.
Double Standard
President Ford's "full, free and absolute" pardon of
former President Nixon and his decision to grant
"conditional amnesty" to war resisters together cast serious
doubts on the concepts of "justice" and "mercy" in the
Ford administration.
Ford claimed he took both actions to "heal the nation's
wounds."
But with the Nixon pardon, it has become entirely
possible that the full story of the Watergate cover-up may
never come out. By granting the pardon, Ford has not, as he
said, written "the end" to the Watergate tragedy. He has, in
fact, continued the cover-up. Although we have supported a
pardon after indictment and trial of the former President, a
pardon at this time represents a clear obstruction of justice.
But, as Presidential Counsel Philip W. Buchen explained,
there is a difference between justice and mercy. The
presidential pardon, he indicated, was merciful.
The offer to war resisters of clemency after completion
of up to 24 months of "alternate service" raises a further
question: Did these draft evaders and deserters, by refusing
to serve in an immoral war, commit a more serious crime
than did Nixon?
Nixon apparently violated his oath of office and betrayed
his country, but was required neither to admit wrongdoing
nor offer any alternative service.
So it seems ironic that Ford could manage mercy in
Nixon's case, but after a professedly "honest and
conscientious effort" could only offer less than justice to
Vietnam war resisters.
Advertising Policy
Although the Daily sometimes disagrees with its
advertisers, it also maintains a policy of open access to
advertising space. For example, the Daily supports the
struggle of the United Farmworkers, but also has published
advertisements for Gallo wine.
The Daily is opposed to excluding anyone from access to
advertising space for political reasons, regardless of whether
the advertiser's views are unacceptable to the Editorial
Board or unpopular in the community.
Specifically, the Daily accepts all advertising, regardless
of source, except that judged by the Editorial Board to be
libelous, inciting to illegal acts of violence or legally obscene.

But with the Nixon pardon, it has become entirely
possible that the full story of the Watergate cover-up may
never come out. By granting the pardon, Ford has not, as he
said, written "the end" to the Watergate tragedy. He has, in
fact, continued the cover-up. Although we have supported a
pardon after indictment and trial of the former President, a
pardon at this time represents a clear obstruction of justice.
But, as Presidential Counsel Philip W. Buchen explained,
there is a difference between justice and mercy. The
presidential pardon, he indicated, was merciful.
The offer to war resisters of clemency after completion
of up to 24 months of "alternate service" raises a further
question: Did these draft evaders and deserters, by refusing
to serve in an immoral war, commit a more serious crime
than did Nixon?
Nixon apparently violated his oath of office and betrayed
his country, but was required neither to admit wrongdoing
nor offer any alternative service.
So it seems ironic that Ford could manage mercy in
Nixon's case, but after a professedly "honest and
conscientious effort" could only offer less than justice to
Vietnam war resisters.
Advertising Policy
Although the Daily sometimes disagrees with its
advertisers, it also maintains a policy of open access to
advertising space. For example, the Daily supports the
struggle of the United Farmworkers, but also has published
advertisements for Gallo wine.
The Daily is opposed to excluding anyone from access to
advertising space for political reasons, regardless of whether
the advertiser's views are unacceptable to the Editorial
Board or unpopular in the community.
Specifically, the Daily accepts all advertising, regardless
of source, except that judged by the Editorial Board to be
libelous, inciting to illegal acts of violence or legally obscene.
Unwary students returning to the Stanford campus this
week are likely to discover several significant changes.
The major surprises include final approval of an 82-unit
condominium project for faculty, staff and emeriti on the
Row, and the decision to close Tresidder cafeteria and
replace it with an El Camino-like fast food restaurant.
The decisions themselves were not altogether surprising,
and they could quite possibly benefit a large segment of the
Stanford community. The disturbing fact is that once again
important University decisions affecting students were
handed down while few students were around to protest.
President Lyman's decision to give the emeriti housing
project his go-ahead came after a meeting Tuesday, june 11,
the next-to-last day of spring quarter finals. Although
University officials made minimal attempts to solicit student
reaction during finals week, the bulk of the student body
was immersed in study for final exams or had already left
for the summer.
Disregard for student input into the decision-making
progress was even more flagrant in the Tresidder decision,
which was made without any consultation with those
persons affected by it.
These are not isolated instances. Rather, they fit
perfectly in a disturbing pattern of crucial decisions made
during quarter breaks or finals week—times when student
response is practically non-existent.
Other notable determinations made essentially covertly
included the.shift of the black theme house from Roble to
Lagunita last spring and the March, 1972, suspensions of
four students, the so-called "placement center four," for
disruption of recruiting activities.
The list could go on and on. These "surprising" decisions
on issues surrounded by student opposition might suggest to
some a grand University conspiracy to delay any
controversial decision until finals week or vacations. At
least, it seems that the administration is often more
interested in preventing student input than encouraging it.
Double Standard
President Ford's "full, free and absolute" pardon of
former President Nixon and his decision to grant
"conditional amnesty" to war resisters together cast serious
doubts on the concepts of "justice" and "mercy" in the
Ford administration.
Ford claimed he took both actions to "heal the nation's
wounds."
