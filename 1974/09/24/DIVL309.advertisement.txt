I THE COMMONS
IS A ROSE EVER NOT A ROSE?
A rose may always be a rose, but sometimes a snack bar is a cafeteria. As in the case of
Encina Snack Bar. We've been calling it that because it has always been called that (why
else?) What it really is is a full-service cafeteria. And it's small, secluded, and cozy. We've
named it THE COMMONS, which gives you a hint about where it is — in Encina Commons,
behind Encina Hall. You'll find it nestled back in an ivy-covered alcove, a quiet oasis in a
busy world. You'll also find it worth looking for.
