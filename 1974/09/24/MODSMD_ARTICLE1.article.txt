# SWOPSI's New Mentor Notes Goals
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
An increased emphasis on economic
and political issues in the Stanford
Workshop on Social and Political
Issues (SWOPSI) is planned by Andrew
Parnes, SWOPSI's new director.
Parties, who took office Sept. 1,
noted that since its founding in 1969,
"SWOPSI has drifted away from
economic and political issues to social
service projects." Parnes explained
that "a balancing out" between
political, economic and social issues
will be the main thrust of his
directorship.
A Williams College graduate, Parnes
received his Ph.D. in economics from
Stanford in 1973 and served last year
as an instructor at San Jose State
College.
He was selected from a group of 55
"highly qualified" applicants,
according to Asst. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Michael
Clossen. Parnes was chosen because of
his "nice blend" of academic expertise
and interest in current social issues,
Clossen explained.
Interdisciplinary Projects
Rather than eliminating existing
social service projects, Parnes hopes to
integrate them with political and
economic issues.
"I'd like to bring out the
interdisciplinary nature of these
studies," Parnes said. "The task is
more one of addition than
replacement.
"When we do a social service
project, we should conduct it in the
context of the role of the service in
society. For example, students in a
SWOPSI course on child care should
not just be given work experience, but
should study the role of the center in
the community and the nation."
Parnes suggested ideas for new
SWOPSI courses that could tie in with
community action projects.
