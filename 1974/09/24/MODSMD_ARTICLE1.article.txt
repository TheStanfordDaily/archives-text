# SWOPSI's New Mentor Notes Goals
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
An increased emphasis on economic
and political issues in the Stanford
Workshop on Social and Political
Issues (SWOPSI) is planned by Andrew
Parnes, SWOPSI's new director.
Parties, who took office Sept. 1,
noted that since its founding in 1969,
"SWOPSI has drifted away from
economic and political issues to social
service projects." Parnes explained
that "a balancing out" between
political, economic and social issues
will be the main thrust of his
directorship.
A Williams College graduate, Parnes
received his Ph.D. in economics from
Stanford in 1973 and served last year
as an instructor at San Jose State
College.
He was selected from a group of 55
"highly qualified" applicants,
according to Asst. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Michael
Clossen. Parnes was chosen because of
his "nice blend" of academic expertise
and interest in current social issues,
Clossen explained.
Interdisciplinary Projects
Rather than eliminating existing
social service projects, Parnes hopes to
integrate them with political and
economic issues.
"I'd like to bring out the
interdisciplinary nature of these
studies," Parnes said. "The task is
more one of addition than
replacement.
"When we do a social service
project, we should conduct it in the
context of the role of the service in
society. For example, students in a
SWOPSI course on child care should
not just be given work experience, but
should study the role of the center in
the community and the nation."
Parnes suggested ideas for new
SWOPSI courses that could tie in with
community action projects.

illegal chicano immigration, regulation
of the economy at various levels, food
cooperatives, energy, criminal justice
and women in athletics are topics
Parnes said he hopes students will
explore in future SWOPSI courses.
Parnes said another of his main
goals is to investigate the
commencement of summer SWOPSI
programs.
"Summer is a good time to
participate in action outside of the
campus," Parnes noted. "Maybe we
can set up some sort of workshop
during the spring that could lead into a
program of involvement during the
summer."
He also suggested establishing
SWOPSI courses on the overseas
campuses.
Admitting that operating on its
current $27,000 budget will be "a
squeeze," Parnes nevertheless
expressed optimism that the program
can continue without cuts in its
activities.
Budget Problems
"The budget this year is essentially
what it was last year but with inflation
increasing, we are more financially
pressed," Parnes said.
Parnes said he has no specific plans
for encouraging - the Office of
Undergraduate Studies to increase
SWOPSI's budget. He said that the
demonstration that SWOPSI is a
"viable program attracting support
from students, faculty and the
community" is the best way to
persuade the Administration to
increase its support for SWOPSI.
"Maybe working with children and
participating in action programs isn't
academically as rigorous as classroom
experience, but it is educationally as
rigorous," Parnes declared. "The
element of personal development is
important and this is what SWOPSI
offers."
Asked about the proposed merger
of SWOPSI with the Undergraduate
Specials program, Parnes said he
opposes such ties and is pleased that

the Office of Undergraduate Studies
has chosen to keep the two programs
separate.
Parnes explained that not only are
the aims of the programs different, but
a merger would cause administrative
personnel to spread themselves too
thin.
Approval For Study
Although Panics said he hopes to
work In harmony with the University
Administration, he said he would not
hesitate to encourage SWOPSI to
publish another study like The Other
Stanford if it were "well done, valid,
and determined by the SWOPSI Policy
Board to be within the domain of the
program."
The' Other Stanford, a
SWOPSI-published report criticizing
the quality of student-faculty

relations, met with objections from
Administration officials early this
year.
"SWOPSI has the duty to create the
climate or change," Parnes explained.
"If we were presented with a study
that could help to solve a problem by
calling attention to it, we wouldn't
sweep it under the rug."
Parnes said he accepted the position
of SWOPSI Director because it "offers
me an opportunity to become involved
in undergraduate education in a
capacity other than that of a teacher.
By being responsible for an
undergraduate program that is
student-initiated gives me a chance to
use my interest in political and social
issues, especially political economy, in
order to help achieve changes in
society."

campus," Parnes noted. "Maybe we
can set up some sort of workshop
during the spring that could lead into a
program of involvement during the
summer."
He also suggested establishing
SWOPSI courses on the overseas
campuses.
Admitting that operating on its
current $27,000 budget will be "a
squeeze," Parnes nevertheless
expressed optimism that the program
can continue without cuts in its
activities.
Budget Problems
"The budget this year is essentially
what it was last year but with inflation
increasing, we are more financially
pressed," Parnes said.
Parnes said he has no specific plans
for encouraging - the Office of
Undergraduate Studies to increase
SWOPSI's budget. He said that the
demonstration that SWOPSI is a
"viable program attracting support
from students, faculty and the
community" is the best way to
persuade the Administration to
increase its support for SWOPSI.
"Maybe working with children and
participating in action programs isn't
academically as rigorous as classroom
experience, but it is educationally as
rigorous," Parnes declared. "The
element of personal development is
important and this is what SWOPSI
offers."
Asked about the proposed merger
of SWOPSI with the Undergraduate
Specials program, Parnes said he
opposes such ties and is pleased that

the Office of Undergraduate Studies
has chosen to keep the two programs
separate.
Parnes explained that not only are
the aims of the programs different, but
a merger would cause administrative
personnel to spread themselves too
thin.
Approval For Study
Although Panics said he hopes to
work In harmony with the University
Administration, he said he would not
hesitate to encourage SWOPSI to
publish another study like The Other
Stanford if it were "well done, valid,
and determined by the SWOPSI Policy
Board to be within the domain of the
program."
The' Other Stanford, a
SWOPSI-published report criticizing
the quality of student-faculty

relations, met with objections from
Administration officials early this
year.
"SWOPSI has the duty to create the
climate or change," Parnes explained.
"If we were presented with a study
that could help to solve a problem by
calling attention to it, we wouldn't
sweep it under the rug."
Parnes said he accepted the position
of SWOPSI Director because it "offers
me an opportunity to become involved
in undergraduate education in a
capacity other than that of a teacher.
By being responsible for an
undergraduate program that is
student-initiated gives me a chance to
use my interest in political and social
issues, especially political economy, in
order to help achieve changes in
society."
An increased emphasis on economic
and political issues in the Stanford
Workshop on Social and Political
Issues (SWOPSI) is planned by Andrew
Parnes, SWOPSI's new director.
Parties, who took office Sept. 1,
noted that since its founding in 1969,
"SWOPSI has drifted away from
economic and political issues to social
service projects." Parnes explained
that "a balancing out" between
political, economic and social issues
will be the main thrust of his
directorship.
A Williams College graduate, Parnes
received his Ph.D. in economics from
Stanford in 1973 and served last year
as an instructor at San Jose State
College.
He was selected from a group of 55
"highly qualified" applicants,
according to Asst. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Michael
Clossen. Parnes was chosen because of
his "nice blend" of academic expertise
and interest in current social issues,
Clossen explained.
Interdisciplinary Projects
Rather than eliminating existing
social service projects, Parnes hopes to
integrate them with political and
economic issues.
"I'd like to bring out the
interdisciplinary nature of these
studies," Parnes said. "The task is
more one of addition than
replacement.
"When we do a social service
project, we should conduct it in the
context of the role of the service in
society. For example, students in a
SWOPSI course on child care should
not just be given work experience, but
should study the role of the center in
the community and the nation."
Parnes suggested ideas for new
SWOPSI courses that could tie in with
community action projects.

me an opportunity to become involved
in undergraduate education in a
capacity other than that of a teacher.
By being responsible for an
undergraduate program that is
student-initiated gives me a chance to
use my interest in political and social
issues, especially political economy, in
order to help achieve changes in
society."
An increased emphasis on economic
and political issues in the Stanford
Workshop on Social and Political
Issues (SWOPSI) is planned by Andrew
Parnes, SWOPSI's new director.
Parties, who took office Sept. 1,
noted that since its founding in 1969,
"SWOPSI has drifted away from
economic and political issues to social
service projects." Parnes explained
that "a balancing out" between
political, economic and social issues
will be the main thrust of his
directorship.
A Williams College graduate, Parnes
received his Ph.D. in economics from
Stanford in 1973 and served last year
as an instructor at San Jose State
College.
He was selected from a group of 55
"highly qualified" applicants,
according to Asst. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Michael
Clossen. Parnes was chosen because of
his "nice blend" of academic expertise
and interest in current social issues,
Clossen explained.
Interdisciplinary Projects
Rather than eliminating existing
social service projects, Parnes hopes to
integrate them with political and
economic issues.
"I'd like to bring out the
interdisciplinary nature of these
studies," Parnes said. "The task is
more one of addition than
replacement.
"When we do a social service
project, we should conduct it in the
context of the role of the service in
society. For example, students in a
SWOPSI course on child care should
not just be given work experience, but
should study the role of the center in
the community and the nation."
Parnes suggested ideas for new
SWOPSI courses that could tie in with
community action projects.

INTERDISCIPLINARY APPRO AC H-Recently appointed SWOPSI director
Andres Parnes plans to encourage participants in SWOPSI service projects to
explore the political and economic consequences of their work.
illegal chicano immigration, regulation
of the economy at various levels, food
cooperatives, energy, criminal justice
and women in athletics are topics
Parnes said he hopes students will
explore in future SWOPSI courses.
Parnes said another of his main
goals is to investigate the
commencement of summer SWOPSI
programs.
"Summer is a good time to
participate in action outside of the
campus," Parnes noted. "Maybe we
can set up some sort of workshop
during the spring that could lead into a
program of involvement during the
summer."
He also suggested establishing
SWOPSI courses on the overseas
campuses.
Admitting that operating on its
current $27,000 budget will be "a
squeeze," Parnes nevertheless
expressed optimism that the program
can continue without cuts in its
activities.
Budget Problems
"The budget this year is essentially
what it was last year but with inflation
increasing, we are more financially
pressed," Parnes said.
Parnes said he has no specific plans
for encouraging - the Office of
Undergraduate Studies to increase
SWOPSI's budget. He said that the
demonstration that SWOPSI is a
"viable program attracting support
from students, faculty and the
community" is the best way to
persuade the Administration to
increase its support for SWOPSI.
"Maybe working with children and
participating in action programs isn't
academically as rigorous as classroom
experience, but it is educationally as
rigorous," Parnes declared. "The
element of personal development is
important and this is what SWOPSI
offers."
Asked about the proposed merger
of SWOPSI with the Undergraduate
Specials program, Parnes said he
opposes such ties and is pleased that

the Office of Undergraduate Studies
has chosen to keep the two programs
separate.
Parnes explained that not only are
the aims of the programs different, but
a merger would cause administrative
personnel to spread themselves too
thin.
Approval For Study
Although Panics said he hopes to
work In harmony with the University
Administration, he said he would not
hesitate to encourage SWOPSI to
publish another study like The Other
Stanford if it were "well done, valid,
and determined by the SWOPSI Policy
Board to be within the domain of the
program."
The' Other Stanford, a
SWOPSI-published report criticizing
the quality of student-faculty

relations, met with objections from
Administration officials early this
year.
"SWOPSI has the duty to create the
climate or change," Parnes explained.
"If we were presented with a study
that could help to solve a problem by
calling attention to it, we wouldn't
sweep it under the rug."
Parnes said he accepted the position
of SWOPSI Director because it "offers
me an opportunity to become involved
in undergraduate education in a
capacity other than that of a teacher.
By being responsible for an
undergraduate program that is
student-initiated gives me a chance to
use my interest in political and social
issues, especially political economy, in
order to help achieve changes in
society."
