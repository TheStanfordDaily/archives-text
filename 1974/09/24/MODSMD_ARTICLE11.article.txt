# On Ford's Career And Future Policy

The honeymoon is over. President Gerald
Ford has pardoned the man who appointed
him. A trial of Richard Nixon for his crimes
would have been an act of lese majeste
offending the dignity of the government's
highest office. Ford has spared us such
demystification of the Presidency, verging as
it does on judicial regicide.
Ford's clemency plan for draft resisters
requires a period of compulsory service under
government auspices. It thus preserves and
extends precisely the "involuntary servitude"
aspect of the conscription system that was
morally repugnant to many draft resisters.
The implication remains that the government
owns the life of each citizen.
Gerald Ford has a political career that
stretches across more than a quarter of a
century. The public record of that career
shows us Ford's personal philosophy in
action and provides us with indications of
what his future policies will be.
Attempt at Impeachment
Ford has a history of opposition to the
full exercise of civil liberties. Best known is
Ford's attempt in April 1970 to engineer the
impeachment of semi-libertarian Supreme
Court Justice William O. Douglas. Among
Ford's major concerns was the fact that
Douglas' writings had appeared in
pornographic magazines, namely Evergreen
Review and Avante Garde.
Ford opposed Lyndon Johnson's 1967
proposal to ban most governmental and
private wiretapping and electronic

eavesdropping. He spoke in favor of
wiretapping in the debate over the Omnibus
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968
and the D.C. Court Reform and Criminal
Procedure Act of 1970.
The preventive detention provision of this
D.C. Crime Act received Ford's endorsement.
In addition, Ford was the sole sponsor of a
1971 Nixon administration bill that would
have provided for pre-trial detention of
so-called dangerous persons charged with
certain crimes. Such policies destroy the
fundamental principle of Anglo-American
jurisprudence that a person should be
considered innocent until proven guilty.
Threatens Political Freedom
On matters of freedom of speech, Ford
was one of the major proponents of
legislation that made it a crime to travel from
state to state to incite "violence." This was
the law that was used to indict the Chicago 8
for conspiracy at the 1968 Democratic
convention.
Ford also spoke out in favor of the
no-knock entry provision of the D.C. Crime
Act.
In matters of economic liberty, Ford has
favored compulsory arbitration since at least
1967 to settle labor-management disputes in
the transportation industry.
Ford went along with President Nixon's
program of wage and price controls, a
program that functioned to prevent
employees' salaries from catching up with
government-created inflation. Ford said of

the Phase II program: "Let me emphasize
that our wage and price controls are
working."
One of Ford's first acts as President was to
apply governmental pressure in the form of a
revived Cost of Living Council and
nationally-publicized jawboning to interfere
with the free movement of prices and wages.
In addition, Ford seems to be intent on
actively pushing for early passage of a bill to
put medicine fully under government
control.
Foreign Intervention
The experience of the Indochina war has
led many Americans to recognize the
immorality of imperialism. But Ford
continues American intervention in
Indochina and the Middle East, policies
which he has long defended. Ford has
nominated anti-communist hawk Nelson
Rockefeller as Vice President, giving him
foreign policy as his province.
Furthermore, Ford was in years past in
the forefront of those urging aerial
bombardment of North Vietnam', including
urban areas, before such bombing became
official U.S. policy.
This past advocacy of policies which
direct weaponry against noncombattants is
an ill omen of the future conduct of the man
who has the power to launch nuclear
weapons.
