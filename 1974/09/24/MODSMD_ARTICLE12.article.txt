# Chilean Coup: U.S. Fraud Unmasked
## 
### 
Kevin Smith

In September 1973, when a
military coup overthrew the
democratically-elected
government of Chile's Marxist
President Salvador Allende and
caused his death, a few left-wing
cynics said they wouldn't be at all
surprised if the United States
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
were somehow involved.
"Nonsense," the government
replied. "You left-wingers think
the CIA is involved in every move
against a leftist government. The
Chilean people simply could no
longer tolerate Allende's
mismanagement of Chile's
jpvernment and economy."
Mow, one year later, we
discover that the 40 Committee, a
secret intelligence group headed
by Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, authorized $5 million
following Allende's election for
the purpose of disrupting Chile's
economy with an extra $1 million
poured in one month before the
assasination to deal the economy
a death blow. In addition,
American money was used to aid
Allende's political opponents and
undermine his own political
strength.
Blood on our Hands
Even if the CIA had no direct
hand in the actual coup and
assassination — which at this point
seems highly doubtful — the fact
that the agency deliberately
engaged in "destabilization"
procedures against Allende's
government, which caused his
ultimate failure, leaves his blood
on the hands of the American
intruders.
It has been widely reported
that Kissinger has more control
over the 40 Committee than any
of his predecessors since the
Committee was formed during the
Harry Truman years.
Therefore, the brunt of these
amazing actions against the
democratically-elected
government of another country
rests more on Kissinger's

shoulders than on anyone else's.
At his last news conference,
President Cerald Ford expressed
several reasons why he approved
of the CIA activity, although he
was not in the White House at the
time. Since Ford rarely makes
foreign policy statements or
decisions before consulting with
Kissinger — especially on matters
this sensitive — it must be
assumed that Kissinger stood
behind the public reasons offered
by Ford.
President's Rationale
First, the President said,
Allende was trying to eliminate all
opposition parties in Chile, and
the United States wanted to keep
Chile's political system as
democratic as possible.
Yet did he consider how we
would react toward any attempt
by a foreign country to meddle
with our elections or our
economy?
Just before Allende's election,
Kissinger reportedly said, "I don't
see why we should have to stand
by and. let a country go
Communist due to the
irresponsibility of its own
people." This same arrogant idea
was expressed four years later at
the Ford press conference.
Ford emphasized that we took
these actions with the best
interests of the Chilean people in

mind. That ruining a country's
economy and deposing its
elected President could serve the
best interests of that country's
people seems rather far-fetched to
begin with. But that we can claim
to know what is best for the
people of Chile is an inexcusable
— but unfortunately typical —
example of American hubris.
Familiar Argument
As a final rationale, Ford
argued that there was nothing
wrong with the CIA carrying out
such covert activities because
many other countries carry out
similar activities. We heard plenty
of that kind of defense of Nixon
during the Watergate mess — that
he had done nothing more than
had his predecessors — and the
argument stinks as much now as it
did then.
An immediate way for
Congress to show its disapproval
of this unwarranted interference
would be the swift removal of
Kissinger from his position of
power. Both in his authorization
of the Chile plan and his
involvement in the secret bombing
of Cambodia in 1972, Kissinger
has unscrupulously deceived
Congress and the country as a
whole.
Pretense Undermined
What makes the Chilean
tragedy somewhat unique is that

the United States has overtly
undermined its own democratic
pretense. We have come to the
conclusion that the democratic
process is only workable in other
countries if they elect officials we
like. This is a tragic but inevitable
result of the arrogance of power.
A prankster recently put
several fake statements, attributed
to various congressmen, into the
United States Congressional
Record. A statement attributed to
conservative Rep. John Ashbrook,
R—Ohio, claimed our activities in
Chile would help return that
country "to its rightful American
owners."
Although Ford, Kissinger, the
CIA and most members of
Congress generally would dispute
this statement, the contents of the
statement indeed describe
American foreign policy, and the
ostensible American commitment
to democracy has been unmasked
as the fraud it is.

— but unfortunately typical —
example of American hubris.
Familiar Argument
As a final rationale, Ford
argued that there was nothing
wrong with the CIA carrying out
such covert activities because
many other countries carry out
similar activities. We heard plenty
of that kind of defense of Nixon
during the Watergate mess — that
he had done nothing more than
had his predecessors — and the
argument stinks as much now as it
did then.
An immediate way for
Congress to show its disapproval
of this unwarranted interference
would be the swift removal of
Kissinger from his position of
power. Both in his authorization
of the Chile plan and his
involvement in the secret bombing
of Cambodia in 1972, Kissinger
has unscrupulously deceived
Congress and the country as a
whole.
Pretense Undermined
What makes the Chilean
tragedy somewhat unique is that

the United States has overtly
undermined its own democratic
pretense. We have come to the
conclusion that the democratic
process is only workable in other
countries if they elect officials we
like. This is a tragic but inevitable
result of the arrogance of power.
A prankster recently put
several fake statements, attributed
to various congressmen, into the
United States Congressional
Record. A statement attributed to
conservative Rep. John Ashbrook,
R—Ohio, claimed our activities in
Chile would help return that
country "to its rightful American
owners."
Although Ford, Kissinger, the
CIA and most members of
Congress generally would dispute
this statement, the contents of the
statement indeed describe
American foreign policy, and the
ostensible American commitment
to democracy has been unmasked
as the fraud it is.

In September 1973, when a
military coup overthrew the
democratically-elected
government of Chile's Marxist
President Salvador Allende and
caused his death, a few left-wing
cynics said they wouldn't be at all
surprised if the United States
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
were somehow involved.
"Nonsense," the government
replied. "You left-wingers think
the CIA is involved in every move
against a leftist government. The
Chilean people simply could no
longer tolerate Allende's
mismanagement of Chile's
jpvernment and economy."
Mow, one year later, we
discover that the 40 Committee, a
secret intelligence group headed
by Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, authorized $5 million
following Allende's election for
the purpose of disrupting Chile's
economy with an extra $1 million
poured in one month before the
assasination to deal the economy
a death blow. In addition,
American money was used to aid
Allende's political opponents and
undermine his own political
strength.
Blood on our Hands
Even if the CIA had no direct
hand in the actual coup and
assassination — which at this point
seems highly doubtful — the fact
that the agency deliberately
engaged in "destabilization"
procedures against Allende's
government, which caused his
ultimate failure, leaves his blood
on the hands of the American
intruders.
It has been widely reported
that Kissinger has more control
over the 40 Committee than any
of his predecessors since the
Committee was formed during the
Harry Truman years.
Therefore, the brunt of these
amazing actions against the
democratically-elected
government of another country
rests more on Kissinger's

shoulders than on anyone else's.
At his last news conference,
President Cerald Ford expressed
several reasons why he approved
of the CIA activity, although he
was not in the White House at the
time. Since Ford rarely makes
foreign policy statements or
decisions before consulting with
Kissinger — especially on matters
this sensitive — it must be
assumed that Kissinger stood
behind the public reasons offered
by Ford.
President's Rationale
First, the President said,
Allende was trying to eliminate all
opposition parties in Chile, and
the United States wanted to keep
Chile's political system as
democratic as possible.
Yet did he consider how we
would react toward any attempt
by a foreign country to meddle
with our elections or our
economy?
Just before Allende's election,
Kissinger reportedly said, "I don't
see why we should have to stand
by and. let a country go
Communist due to the
irresponsibility of its own
people." This same arrogant idea
was expressed four years later at
the Ford press conference.
Ford emphasized that we took
these actions with the best
interests of the Chilean people in

mind. That ruining a country's
economy and deposing its
elected President could serve the
best interests of that country's
people seems rather far-fetched to
begin with. But that we can claim
to know what is best for the
people of Chile is an inexcusable
— but unfortunately typical —
example of American hubris.

It has been widely reported
that Kissinger has more control
over the 40 Committee than any
of his predecessors since the
Committee was formed during the
Harry Truman years.
Therefore, the brunt of these
amazing actions against the
democratically-elected
government of another country
rests more on Kissinger's

shoulders than on anyone else's.
At his last news conference,
President Cerald Ford expressed
several reasons why he approved
of the CIA activity, although he
was not in the White House at the
time. Since Ford rarely makes
foreign policy statements or
decisions before consulting with
Kissinger — especially on matters
this sensitive — it must be
assumed that Kissinger stood
behind the public reasons offered
by Ford.
President's Rationale
First, the President said,
Allende was trying to eliminate all
opposition parties in Chile, and
the United States wanted to keep
Chile's political system as
democratic as possible.
Yet did he consider how we
would react toward any attempt
by a foreign country to meddle
with our elections or our
economy?
Just before Allende's election,
Kissinger reportedly said, "I don't
see why we should have to stand
by and. let a country go
Communist due to the
irresponsibility of its own
people." This same arrogant idea
was expressed four years later at
the Ford press conference.
Ford emphasized that we took
these actions with the best
interests of the Chilean people in

mind. That ruining a country's
economy and deposing its
elected President could serve the
best interests of that country's
people seems rather far-fetched to
begin with. But that we can claim
to know what is best for the
people of Chile is an inexcusable
— but unfortunately typical —
example of American hubris.
Familiar Argument
As a final rationale, Ford
argued that there was nothing
wrong with the CIA carrying out
such covert activities because
many other countries carry out
similar activities. We heard plenty
of that kind of defense of Nixon
during the Watergate mess — that
he had done nothing more than
had his predecessors — and the
argument stinks as much now as it
did then.
An immediate way for
Congress to show its disapproval
of this unwarranted interference
would be the swift removal of
Kissinger from his position of
power. Both in his authorization
of the Chile plan and his
involvement in the secret bombing
of Cambodia in 1972, Kissinger
has unscrupulously deceived
Congress and the country as a
whole.
Pretense Undermined
What makes the Chilean
tragedy somewhat unique is that

the United States has overtly
undermined its own democratic
pretense. We have come to the
conclusion that the democratic
process is only workable in other
countries if they elect officials we
like. This is a tragic but inevitable
result of the arrogance of power.
A prankster recently put
several fake statements, attributed
to various congressmen, into the
United States Congressional
Record. A statement attributed to
conservative Rep. John Ashbrook,
R—Ohio, claimed our activities in
Chile would help return that
country "to its rightful American
owners."
Although Ford, Kissinger, the
CIA and most members of
Congress generally would dispute
this statement, the contents of the
statement indeed describe
American foreign policy, and the
ostensible American commitment
to democracy has been unmasked
as the fraud it is.
