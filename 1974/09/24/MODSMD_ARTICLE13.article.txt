# State Bill To Aid Students

"What are we doing, what are
we doing to do to make it seem
sensible for a bright potential
student to elect to come to
Stanford instead of the University
of California or California State
University at San Jose, when the
differences in this vear's tuition
are $2250 and $2682,
respectively? ,,
—President Richard W. Lyman
President Lyman expressed
these concerns over the quality of
education and the widening gap
between public and private college
costs almost two years ago before
a meeting of the Academic
Council.
Now that inflation has taken
its toll, we find ourselves paying
approximately $500 more
annually than when Lyman's
words first struck home.
And there's no end in sight.
Precipice
More depressing though, if that
is possible, is that for many
students from middle-income
families, the gap between public
and private college costs has
grown from a chuck-hole into a
precipice, perhaps forcing them to
sacrifice "a Stanford education"
for an economically feasible one.
Typically over the past few
years, students from wealthy
backgrounds and from poorer
backgrounds have had an easier
time with college financing than
those from middle-income
families.
Middle-income students often
find that their parents make "a
little too much" to qualify them
for financial aid, but not quite
enough to foot the bill without
some help.
Legislation
Finally, relief for this type of
problem seems in sight tfith a
piece of legislation known as the
"tuition grant bill."
Designed to provide $1 million
in scholarship aid to students who
are now economically ineligible
for grants, the bill represents a
financial break of up to $900
annually for students currently
feeling the pinch of rising
education costs.
Students from all across the
state have lobbied to get this bill,
AB 3862, enacted, and it has
passed both houses of the state
legislature.
Governor's Decision
The issue now rests on Gov.
Reagan's desk. The governor has
until Sept. 30 to veto the bill
before it automatically becomes
law.
The "tuition grant bill"
represents the best of both
worlds. It is by far the easiest and
least complicated way for the
legislature to narrow the gap
between private and public college
costs — short of raising public
college fees.
The bill also provides a realistic
way for the state to provide
monetary support for private
universities without encumbering
them with bureaucratic red tape.
In scholarship form, the
support from Sacramento can be
free of "political strings"
commonly attached to major
grants.
Distribution
Since the bill provides the aid
on an individual basis, rather than
on a University-wide basis, the
money can be distributed evenly
among the most financially
deserving students throughout the
state.
And it is specifically designed
to supplant monies already
granted students through the
California State Scholarship
program.
Clearly the bill is one of the
best legislative deals for both the
private university and the student.
According to legislative sources, it
has a 50-50 chance of meeting
with the governor's approval.
Should AB 3862 become law,
private universities may be able to
stop running consumer price
comparisons with public
universities, and middle-income
students may be able to fight
inflation's effect on their tuition
bills.

University at San Jose, when the
differences in this vear's tuition
are $2250 and $2682,
respectively? ,,
—President Richard W. Lyman
President Lyman expressed
these concerns over the quality of
education and the widening gap
between public and private college
costs almost two years ago before
a meeting of the Academic
Council.
Now that inflation has taken
its toll, we find ourselves paying
approximately $500 more
annually than when Lyman's
words first struck home.
And there's no end in sight.
Precipice
More depressing though, if that
is possible, is that for many
students from middle-income
families, the gap between public
and private college costs has
grown from a chuck-hole into a
precipice, perhaps forcing them to
sacrifice "a Stanford education"
for an economically feasible one.
Typically over the past few
years, students from wealthy
backgrounds and from poorer
backgrounds have had an easier
time with college financing than
those from middle-income
families.
Middle-income students often
find that their parents make "a
little too much" to qualify them
for financial aid, but not quite
enough to foot the bill without
some help.
Legislation
Finally, relief for this type of
problem seems in sight tfith a
piece of legislation known as the
"tuition grant bill."
Designed to provide $1 million
in scholarship aid to students who
are now economically ineligible
for grants, the bill represents a
financial break of up to $900
annually for students currently
feeling the pinch of rising
education costs.
Students from all across the
state have lobbied to get this bill,
AB 3862, enacted, and it has
passed both houses of the state
legislature.
Governor's Decision
The issue now rests on Gov.
Reagan's desk. The governor has
until Sept. 30 to veto the bill
before it automatically becomes
law.
The "tuition grant bill"
represents the best of both
worlds. It is by far the easiest and
least complicated way for the
legislature to narrow the gap
between private and public college
costs — short of raising public
college fees.
The bill also provides a realistic
way for the state to provide
monetary support for private
universities without encumbering
them with bureaucratic red tape.
In scholarship form, the
support from Sacramento can be
free of "political strings"
commonly attached to major
grants.
Distribution
Since the bill provides the aid
on an individual basis, rather than
on a University-wide basis, the
money can be distributed evenly
among the most financially
deserving students throughout the
state.
And it is specifically designed
to supplant monies already
granted students through the
California State Scholarship
program.
Clearly the bill is one of the
best legislative deals for both the
private university and the student.
According to legislative sources, it
has a 50-50 chance of meeting
with the governor's approval.
Should AB 3862 become law,
private universities may be able to
stop running consumer price
comparisons with public
universities, and middle-income
students may be able to fight
inflation's effect on their tuition
bills.
