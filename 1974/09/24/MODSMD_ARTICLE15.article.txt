## Amid Registration Blues Organizations Woo Fresh Recruits 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
No one could make the claim
that fumbling with PTRs, Time
Schedules, deferment forms, grant
cards and the inevitable
checkbook on registration day is
easy.
The fact that someone hands
you a multicolored
conglomeration of paper known
as a "reg packet" at the very
beginning of the process may
make your fumbling and paper
shuffling even more difficult, but
don't despair.
Consider instead the 100
members of various campus
organizations who spent six hours
Sunday assembling the 348,500
pieces of literature that became
the 8500 reg packets distributed
this week. The reg packet stuffing
was organized by Alpha Phi
Omega, the campus service
organization, which itself uses the
reg packets as a means of reaching
most of the students on campus
with information about its
activities.
Exhaustion
This fall's reg packet was
assembled by 37 different campus
organizations ranging from the
Quad to the Students
International Meditation Society.
Alpha Phi Omega planned to stuff
11,500 packets Sunday, but by
6:30 p.m. the rows of student
volunteers — at least two from
each group contributing to the
packets — had reached the point
of exhaustion and operations shut
down.
"Stuffing the reg packets was a
zoO," comments Margie Shuer of
the Organization of Stanford
Athletes. 'There must be a better
way to reach people, maybe
leafleting the dorms."
Indeed, many if not most
campus organizations have
abandoned leafleting in favor of
setting up tables outside of Maples
Pavilion to attract interested
students from the throngs going
inside to hand over their tuition.
"It's been surprising," says

Scott Smith of the response at a
table staffed by the Conservative
Student Union.
"Usually people, especially
freshmen, are really busy and just
want to register," Smith says,
pleased at recruiting several
students whom he calls "latent
freshman conservatives."
Predictably, some organizations
have a far easier time recruiting
members than others, and
Monday's efforts found the
Stanford Pre-Medical Society with
220 students signed up.
"Of course, there's no
obligation to sign up and more
people will come to the first
meeting," says Anita Meister from
behind the table.
Yosemite Petition
Another highly successful table
is staffed by members of
Columbae House collecting
petition signatures opposing the
purchase by Music Corporation Of
America of large concessions in
Yosemite National Park. With 250
signatures collected Monday,
conservation seems to be a worthy
cause in the minds of many
registering students.
While the Stanford
Conservation Group had collected
only 36 new applications Monday,
group members think their table is
a success and note a higher
interest in political action among
prospective members than in
recent years.
Political Potpourri
Political activity around Maples
indeed seems to be on the
upswing , with no less than three
tables organized by typically
liberal organizations and four
staffed by conservatives.
"Considering the nature of the
organization," says John Johnson
of the Young Republicans, "I'm
doing about as well as I
expected."
Mary Kisner of the Libertarian
Society was less hopeful but
satisfied with her results, saying,
"We've had some interest and
we've handed out quite a bit of

literature."
In another portion of the
political spectrum, John
Boli-Bennett of Amnesty
International was pleased with the
80 signatures he had collected
Monday toward the release of
three doctors being held prisoner
in Chile.
Athletic Recruits
In another effort for liberation
the founders of the Organization
of Stanford Athletes, a
burgeoning women's group, have
collected signatures from 150
students interested in track, crew,
football, and intercollegiate
swimming.
Male athletes are also
recruiting, and the Stanford Crew
has brought one of its shells down
to Maples to help attract its 50
new prospects.

"The problem is to keep
people from chaining their bikes
to it," according to team captain
Sam Francis.
In extremely impressive array,
the Stanford Aikido Club staffs
their table wearing hakamas, the
trousers worn by experts in the
sport.
Brownies, Bread
Culinary persuasion was being
used both by Columbae House
and by The Bridge, with Bridge
staffers offering homemade bread
and brownies with cool apple
cider to anyone making a financial
contribution to the campus
counseling and growth center.
Religious organizations present
at registration include Hillel, the
Latter Day Saints organization,
Campus Crusade for Christ, and

the Church of Scientology.
Despite the gigantic
expenditure of paper and people
hours that goes into the
registration recruiting effort, most
table staffers seem to feel that it
all pays off in increased
memberships and extended
communication with students in
general.
At no other time do all of
Stanford's students pass through
the same area during the same 48
hours, and at no other time do
they seem to have as much
enthusiasm for extracurricular
activities as they do during the
two days before classes start.
In any case, according to Smith
of the Conservative Union, "It's
nice sitting here watching the
people go by and trying to pick
out all the freshmen."

POLITICS AND RELlGlON—Recruiters for various campus organizations waited outside Maples Pavilion
yesterday, tempting time out of students' schedules as well as change out of their pockets. While religion
and politics of all persuasions were prevalent, athletes and musical groups also made bids for new
members.

football, and intercollegiate
swimming.
Male athletes are also
recruiting, and the Stanford Crew
has brought one of its shells down
to Maples to help attract its 50
new prospects.

"The problem is to keep
people from chaining their bikes
to it," according to team captain
Sam Francis.
In extremely impressive array,
the Stanford Aikido Club staffs
their table wearing hakamas, the
trousers worn by experts in the
sport.
Brownies, Bread
Culinary persuasion was being
used both by Columbae House
and by The Bridge, with Bridge
staffers offering homemade bread
and brownies with cool apple
cider to anyone making a financial
contribution to the campus
counseling and growth center.
Religious organizations present
at registration include Hillel, the
Latter Day Saints organization,
Campus Crusade for Christ, and

the Church of Scientology.
Despite the gigantic
expenditure of paper and people
hours that goes into the
registration recruiting effort, most
table staffers seem to feel that it
all pays off in increased
memberships and extended
communication with students in
general.
At no other time do all of
Stanford's students pass through
the same area during the same 48
hours, and at no other time do
they seem to have as much
enthusiasm for extracurricular
activities as they do during the
two days before classes start.
In any case, according to Smith
of the Conservative Union, "It's
nice sitting here watching the
people go by and trying to pick
out all the freshmen."

POLITICS AND RELlGlON—Recruiters for various campus organizations waited outside Maples Pavilion
yesterday, tempting time out of students' schedules as well as change out of their pockets. While religion
and politics of all persuasions were prevalent, athletes and musical groups also made bids for new
members.
No one could make the claim
that fumbling with PTRs, Time
Schedules, deferment forms, grant
cards and the inevitable
checkbook on registration day is
easy.
The fact that someone hands
you a multicolored
conglomeration of paper known
as a "reg packet" at the very
beginning of the process may
make your fumbling and paper
shuffling even more difficult, but
don't despair.
Consider instead the 100
members of various campus
organizations who spent six hours
Sunday assembling the 348,500
pieces of literature that became
the 8500 reg packets distributed
this week. The reg packet stuffing
was organized by Alpha Phi
Omega, the campus service
organization, which itself uses the
reg packets as a means of reaching
most of the students on campus
with information about its
activities.
Exhaustion
This fall's reg packet was
assembled by 37 different campus
organizations ranging from the
Quad to the Students
International Meditation Society.
Alpha Phi Omega planned to stuff
11,500 packets Sunday, but by
6:30 p.m. the rows of student
volunteers — at least two from
each group contributing to the
packets — had reached the point
of exhaustion and operations shut
down.
"Stuffing the reg packets was a
zoO," comments Margie Shuer of
the Organization of Stanford
Athletes. 'There must be a better
way to reach people, maybe
leafleting the dorms."
Indeed, many if not most
campus organizations have
abandoned leafleting in favor of
setting up tables outside of Maples
Pavilion to attract interested
students from the throngs going
inside to hand over their tuition.
"It's been surprising," says

Scott Smith of the response at a
table staffed by the Conservative
Student Union.
"Usually people, especially
freshmen, are really busy and just
want to register," Smith says,
pleased at recruiting several
students whom he calls "latent
freshman conservatives."
Predictably, some organizations
have a far easier time recruiting
members than others, and
Monday's efforts found the
Stanford Pre-Medical Society with
220 students signed up.
"Of course, there's no
obligation to sign up and more
people will come to the first
meeting," says Anita Meister from
behind the table.
Yosemite Petition
Another highly successful table
is staffed by members of
Columbae House collecting
petition signatures opposing the
purchase by Music Corporation Of
America of large concessions in
Yosemite National Park. With 250
signatures collected Monday,
conservation seems to be a worthy
cause in the minds of many
registering students.
While the Stanford
Conservation Group had collected
only 36 new applications Monday,
group members think their table is
a success and note a higher
interest in political action among
prospective members than in
recent years.
Political Potpourri
Political activity around Maples
indeed seems to be on the
upswing , with no less than three
tables organized by typically
liberal organizations and four
staffed by conservatives.
"Considering the nature of the
organization," says John Johnson
of the Young Republicans, "I'm
doing about as well as I
expected."
Mary Kisner of the Libertarian
Society was less hopeful but
satisfied with her results, saying,
"We've had some interest and
we've handed out quite a bit of

literature."
In another portion of the
political spectrum, John
Boli-Bennett of Amnesty
International was pleased with the
80 signatures he had collected
Monday toward the release of
three doctors being held prisoner
in Chile.
Athletic Recruits
In another effort for liberation
the founders of the Organization
of Stanford Athletes, a
burgeoning women's group, have
collected signatures from 150
students interested in track, crew,
football, and intercollegiate
swimming.
Male athletes are also

Monday's efforts found the
Stanford Pre-Medical Society with
220 students signed up.
"Of course, there's no
obligation to sign up and more
people will come to the first
meeting," says Anita Meister from
behind the table.
Yosemite Petition
Another highly successful table
is staffed by members of
Columbae House collecting
petition signatures opposing the
purchase by Music Corporation Of
America of large concessions in
Yosemite National Park. With 250
signatures collected Monday,
conservation seems to be a worthy
cause in the minds of many
registering students.
While the Stanford
Conservation Group had collected
only 36 new applications Monday,
group members think their table is
a success and note a higher
interest in political action among
prospective members than in
recent years.
Political Potpourri
Political activity around Maples
indeed seems to be on the
upswing , with no less than three
tables organized by typically
liberal organizations and four
staffed by conservatives.
"Considering the nature of the
organization," says John Johnson
of the Young Republicans, "I'm
doing about as well as I
expected."
Mary Kisner of the Libertarian
Society was less hopeful but
satisfied with her results, saying,
"We've had some interest and
we've handed out quite a bit of

literature."
In another portion of the
political spectrum, John
Boli-Bennett of Amnesty
International was pleased with the
80 signatures he had collected
Monday toward the release of
three doctors being held prisoner
in Chile.
Athletic Recruits
In another effort for liberation
the founders of the Organization
of Stanford Athletes, a
burgeoning women's group, have
collected signatures from 150
students interested in track, crew,
football, and intercollegiate
swimming.
Male athletes are also
recruiting, and the Stanford Crew
has brought one of its shells down
to Maples to help attract its 50
new prospects.

"The problem is to keep
people from chaining their bikes
to it," according to team captain
Sam Francis.
In extremely impressive array,
the Stanford Aikido Club staffs
their table wearing hakamas, the
trousers worn by experts in the
sport.
Brownies, Bread
Culinary persuasion was being
used both by Columbae House
and by The Bridge, with Bridge
staffers offering homemade bread
and brownies with cool apple
cider to anyone making a financial
contribution to the campus
counseling and growth center.
Religious organizations present
at registration include Hillel, the
Latter Day Saints organization,
Campus Crusade for Christ, and

the Church of Scientology.
Despite the gigantic
expenditure of paper and people
hours that goes into the
registration recruiting effort, most
table staffers seem to feel that it
all pays off in increased
memberships and extended
communication with students in
general.
At no other time do all of
Stanford's students pass through
the same area during the same 48
hours, and at no other time do
they seem to have as much
enthusiasm for extracurricular
activities as they do during the
two days before classes start.
In any case, according to Smith
of the Conservative Union, "It's
nice sitting here watching the
people go by and trying to pick
out all the freshmen."

POLITICS AND RELlGlON—Recruiters for various campus organizations waited outside Maples Pavilion
yesterday, tempting time out of students' schedules as well as change out of their pockets. While religion
and politics of all persuasions were prevalent, athletes and musical groups also made bids for new
members.
No one could make the claim
that fumbling with PTRs, Time
Schedules, deferment forms, grant
cards and the inevitable
checkbook on registration day is
easy.
The fact that someone hands
you a multicolored
conglomeration of paper known
as a "reg packet" at the very
beginning of the process may
make your fumbling and paper
shuffling even more difficult, but
don't despair.
Consider instead the 100
members of various campus
organizations who spent six hours
Sunday assembling the 348,500
pieces of literature that became
the 8500 reg packets distributed
this week. The reg packet stuffing
was organized by Alpha Phi
Omega, the campus service
organization, which itself uses the
reg packets as a means of reaching
most of the students on campus
with information about its
activities.
Exhaustion
This fall's reg packet was
assembled by 37 different campus
organizations ranging from the
Quad to the Students
International Meditation Society.
Alpha Phi Omega planned to stuff
11,500 packets Sunday, but by
6:30 p.m. the rows of student
volunteers — at least two from
each group contributing to the
packets — had reached the point
of exhaustion and operations shut
down.
"Stuffing the reg packets was a
zoO," comments Margie Shuer of
the Organization of Stanford
Athletes. 'There must be a better
way to reach people, maybe
leafleting the dorms."
Indeed, many if not most
campus organizations have
abandoned leafleting in favor of
setting up tables outside of Maples
Pavilion to attract interested
students from the throngs going
inside to hand over their tuition.
"It's been surprising," says

Scott Smith of the response at a
table staffed by the Conservative
Student Union.
"Usually people, especially
freshmen, are really busy and just
want to register," Smith says,
pleased at recruiting several
students whom he calls "latent
freshman conservatives."
Predictably, some organizations
have a far easier time recruiting
members than others, and
Monday's efforts found the
Stanford Pre-Medical Society with
220 students signed up.
"Of course, there's no
