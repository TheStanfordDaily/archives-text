Why do students have to have two separate identification cards — one
for the University and one for the Food Service? —G.R.R.
During registration, all students will receive a cardboard I.D. on
their permit to register which shows that the student has registered.
The card will have an ink stamp on it as well as a single registration
sticker. Also, there will be a space which can be punched for ASSU
activities such as season football tickets.
Students using the Food Service will need a separate photo card
exactly the same as the former I.D. card with the addition of a stamp
declaring the card the official Food Service card.
According to Assoc. Registrar Robert Houghton, the University
and the Food Service will issue separate I.D.'s because the University
issued approximately 7000 cards to students last year. Since the Food
Service expects only 3000 students to buy meal plans, they need only
3000 cards instead of the 7000 issued to all students last yedr.
The University seems to have overlooked an obvious alternative to
the two card system. Why couldn't the University leave a space on
their cards for photos and have the Food Service pay to laminate and
put photos on cards of students buying meal plans. Holes could still be
punched through the laminated card as was done last year for the
Food Service rebates during the United Stanford Employees' strike.
Students who have their old I.D.'s intact still have to get their
pictures taken for new Food Service cards. The only difference
between the old I.D.'s and the Food Service card is a stamp. Why
couldn't the Food Service just put a special sticker on the old I.D.'s?
Is there some hind of transportation from Stanford to the San
Francisco airport and to San Jose airport? —A.L.S.
There are two modes of transportation to San Francisco Airport.
To decide which to use you have to establish priorities. For instance,
which means more to you — money or convenience? If it's money,
take the Greyhound from the station at 403 Alma (that's one block
west of University Ave. at Lytton Avenue). The buses leave on the
hour and the half hour, and a one way trip only costs $1.35. However,
you have to transfer in Redwood City to the B line. This can
sometimes take about 20 minutes so plan yOur time well.
If you are willing to spend more money — like $9.00 — there are
two limousine services available. The Airport Limousine Service
requires a reservation made at least three hours in advance. Call
961-8800 and you can ride in style to the airport.
If you get some more people to go with you, the Airport Service
will give you a discount — four people for $28. Airport Service also
goes to San Jose for the same price.
The Golden Sedan Service requires reservation a full day in advance
but you get better rates. Ask operator for toll-free EN 1-5427. To San
Francisco it's a $9 per passenger for one or two passengers, $26 for
three, $28 for four, $32 for five, and $34 for six. To San Jose it's $9
per passenger for one or two passengers, $20 for three, $20 for four,
$22 for five, and $24 for six. Both limousines may stop to pick up
people along the way. There is no Greyhound service to the San Jose
airport or Santa Clara transit.

Why do students have to have two separate identification cards — one
for the University and one for the Food Service? —G.R.R.
During registration, all students will receive a cardboard I.D. on
their permit to register which shows that the student has registered.
The card will have an ink stamp on it as well as a single registration
sticker. Also, there will be a space which can be punched for ASSU
activities such as season football tickets.
Students using the Food Service will need a separate photo card
exactly the same as the former I.D. card with the addition of a stamp
declaring the card the official Food Service card.
According to Assoc. Registrar Robert Houghton, the University
and the Food Service will issue separate I.D.'s because the University
issued approximately 7000 cards to students last year. Since the Food
Service expects only 3000 students to buy meal plans, they need only
3000 cards instead of the 7000 issued to all students last yedr.
The University seems to have overlooked an obvious alternative to
the two card system. Why couldn't the University leave a space on
their cards for photos and have the Food Service pay to laminate and
put photos on cards of students buying meal plans. Holes could still be
punched through the laminated card as was done last year for the
Food Service rebates during the United Stanford Employees' strike.
Students who have their old I.D.'s intact still have to get their
pictures taken for new Food Service cards. The only difference
between the old I.D.'s and the Food Service card is a stamp. Why
couldn't the Food Service just put a special sticker on the old I.D.'s?
Is there some hind of transportation from Stanford to the San
Francisco airport and to San Jose airport? —A.L.S.
There are two modes of transportation to San Francisco Airport.
To decide which to use you have to establish priorities. For instance,
which means more to you — money or convenience? If it's money,
take the Greyhound from the station at 403 Alma (that's one block
west of University Ave. at Lytton Avenue). The buses leave on the
hour and the half hour, and a one way trip only costs $1.35. However,
you have to transfer in Redwood City to the B line. This can
sometimes take about 20 minutes so plan yOur time well.
If you are willing to spend more money — like $9.00 — there are
two limousine services available. The Airport Limousine Service
requires a reservation made at least three hours in advance. Call
961-8800 and you can ride in style to the airport.
If you get some more people to go with you, the Airport Service
will give you a discount — four people for $28. Airport Service also
goes to San Jose for the same price.
The Golden Sedan Service requires reservation a full day in advance
but you get better rates. Ask operator for toll-free EN 1-5427. To San
Francisco it's a $9 per passenger for one or two passengers, $26 for
three, $28 for four, $32 for five, and $34 for six. To San Jose it's $9
per passenger for one or two passengers, $20 for three, $20 for four,
$22 for five, and $24 for six. Both limousines may stop to pick up
people along the way. There is no Greyhound service to the San Jose
airport or Santa Clara transit.
