# Kennedy's Withdrawal Spurs Search For Frontrunners

News Analysis
WASHINGTON (AP) - By
removing himself from the 1976
presidential race, Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy has opened the way to a
broadened Democratic field.
The action also brings relief to
those fearful of the controversy
and threat of tragedy that would
have surrounded his candidacy.
The most immediate political
beneficiaries of his decision,
whose timing was perhaps more
surprising than its contents, are
the other Democrats who have
either begun or have been
contemplating 1976 presidential
bids.
Minnesota Sen. Walter F.
Mondale's potential candidacy,
for instance, has been
overshadowed by the possibility
that a Kennedy candidacy might
wipe out much potential liberal
support.
Sen. Henry M. Jackson of
Washington faced the basic
handicap that even potential
backers feared he would be unable
to win the Democratic
nomination from Kennedy.
Frontrunners?
Mondale and Jackson may be
the closest things to frontrunners
at this early, indecisive stage. But
Kennedy's decisive stage. But
Kennedy's decision seems, if
nothing else, to guarantee a long
list of entrants and to increase the
chances of a deadlocked
convention.
Some possibilities, such as Gov.
John J. Gilligan of Ohio and Sen.
Birch E. Bayh of Indiana, could
have little hope as long as
Kennedy ran, or even considered
running. Now, significant victories
in November could propel them
into the race.
Other individuals, too, could
benefit — active ones such as Sen.
Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas and
others only candidates for office
now.
Beyond that, however, the
Democratic party may be the
ultimate beneficiary. Kennedy's
long lead in the polls had
convinced even those unlikely to
favor the Massachusetts senator
that he would be difficult to stop
for the nomination.

But many of these, from
chairman Robert S. Strauss down,
feared that Kennedy, while able
to win the nomination, would be
unable to win the presidential
election itself and that his
candidacy would doom the
nation's majority party to a third
straight national defeat.
According to Senate Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield, the
leading candidates now include
Jackson, who has done "the most
in the way of preparation,"
Mondale and Bentsen.
And Alabama Gov. George
Wallace "will be a factor that will
have to be considered," Mansfield
said.
Also deserving consideration
are such "new faces" as Governors
Dale Bumpers of Arkansas,

Reuben Askew of Florida and
Jimmy Carter of Georgia,
Mansfield said.
Increase Effort
Jackson said he would step up
his planning effort and add
political professionals to his
planning staff. He also said he
would probably make a decision
soon on whether to run.
Jackson conceded that Wallace
would probably lead in a public
opinion poll of potential
Democratic candidates because
the governor has greater public
identification.
Mondale said he and Kennedy
have similar Senate voting records
on both domestic and
international issues.
"I will have a good chance of
appealing to Kennedy supporters

who will be looking to someone
else now," he said.
Cloud Disappears
Another possible candidate,
Sen. Morris K. Udall of Arizona,
said, "The Kennedy cloud or the
Kennedy indecision was sort of
hanging over what anyone else
would do, and that's gone now.
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey,
who twice sought the presidency,
said Kennedy's support cannot be
delivered in a bloc to any other
candidate. But he predicted that
Mondale will get a share of it
because Kennedy and Mondale
have espoused similar causes.
"This means the nomination is
really up for grabs," the
Minnesotan added. "But I'm not
grabbing — I'm not even
reaching."
