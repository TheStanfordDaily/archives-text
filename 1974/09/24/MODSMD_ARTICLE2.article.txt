# Thai Encounters More Tough Obstacles In Effort To Leave Vietnam, Visit Stanford
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Nguyen Huu Thai, a South
Vietnamese journalist who has
accepted an offer to teach here this
year as an ASSU guest professor,
remains under house arrest in Saigon
and will not be allowed to leave South
Vietnam until at least October, if at
all.
Thai, who has refused to serve in
the military, will appear at a discharge
hearing next month. If he can be
classified as a security risk on the basis
of his neutralist political orientation
and his journalistic activities, he will
then be eligible to apply for an
identification card, a passport, and an
exit visa.
"But if he doesn't get discharged,
we become concerned again that he
could be sent to a frontier outpost,"
explained Jim Regan, a member of the
committee to bring Thai to Stanford.
Thai has asked the committee to
continue legal preparations for his
arrival in the United States and to
enlist the aid of influential members of
Congress in calling attention to his
case.
Shortly after Thai accepted the
ASSU's invitation last July, Rep. Paul

N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park)
wrote to the congressional liaison on
the Vietnam desk at the State
Department requesting information
and support for Thai's case. Reps.
Bella Abzug(D-N.Y.), and Donald M.
Fraser (D-Minn.), have also made
inquiries at the State Department,
Regan said.
Fraser was acting at the request of
Prof. Richard C. Kagan of Hamline
University, where Thai has been
invited to lecture for a month. Kagan
has also asked U.S. Ambassador to
Vietnam Graham Martin and Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger for help in
securing Thai's release.
Yesterday, liaison officers on the
Vietnam desk and at the Education
Bureau of the State Department told
the Daily that they had not heard of
Thai or of any action taken by the
State Department on his case.
Feels Life Endangered
However, all efforts to free Thai
have reached a temporary standstill
because actions intended to create
pressure in Saigon for Thai's release
might also endanger his life.
In mid-July, Thai expressed fear for
his life in a letter to his sister, Thoa

Branfman, who lives in Washington
D.C. "Suddenly for some reason he
felt the authorities were beginning to
crack down on dissidents of any kind.
Thoa asked us to stop everything we
were doing," said Debbie Silton, a
Thai committee member who
contacted State Department officials
this summer.
A spokesman for McCloskey said
efforts to intercede at the State
Department were halted at Branfman's

request. "We received word that he
would be killed if efforts were
continued and we will not do anything
else until we are contacted," the
spokesman said.
Fear of Scandal
Regan said, "Thai is asking us to
work quietly and smoothly and not to
create a scandal that would embarrass
Saigon into doing something drastic."
Silton said she has not yet asked
