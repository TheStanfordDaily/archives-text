# Thai Encounters More Tough Obstacles In Effort To Leave Vietnam, Visit Stanford
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Nguyen Huu Thai, a South
Vietnamese journalist who has
accepted an offer to teach here this
year as an ASSU guest professor,
remains under house arrest in Saigon
and will not be allowed to leave South
Vietnam until at least October, if at
all.
Thai, who has refused to serve in
the military, will appear at a discharge
hearing next month. If he can be
classified as a security risk on the basis
of his neutralist political orientation
and his journalistic activities, he will
then be eligible to apply for an
identification card, a passport, and an
exit visa.
"But if he doesn't get discharged,
we become concerned again that he
could be sent to a frontier outpost,"
explained Jim Regan, a member of the
committee to bring Thai to Stanford.
Thai has asked the committee to
continue legal preparations for his
arrival in the United States and to
enlist the aid of influential members of
Congress in calling attention to his
case.
Shortly after Thai accepted the
ASSU's invitation last July, Rep. Paul

N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park)
wrote to the congressional liaison on
the Vietnam desk at the State
Department requesting information
and support for Thai's case. Reps.
Bella Abzug(D-N.Y.), and Donald M.
Fraser (D-Minn.), have also made
inquiries at the State Department,
Regan said.
Fraser was acting at the request of
Prof. Richard C. Kagan of Hamline
University, where Thai has been
invited to lecture for a month. Kagan
has also asked U.S. Ambassador to
Vietnam Graham Martin and Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger for help in
securing Thai's release.
Yesterday, liaison officers on the
Vietnam desk and at the Education
Bureau of the State Department told
the Daily that they had not heard of
Thai or of any action taken by the
State Department on his case.
Feels Life Endangered
However, all efforts to free Thai
have reached a temporary standstill
because actions intended to create
pressure in Saigon for Thai's release
might also endanger his life.
In mid-July, Thai expressed fear for
his life in a letter to his sister, Thoa

Branfman, who lives in Washington
D.C. "Suddenly for some reason he
felt the authorities were beginning to
crack down on dissidents of any kind.
Thoa asked us to stop everything we
were doing," said Debbie Silton, a
Thai committee member who
contacted State Department officials
this summer.
A spokesman for McCloskey said
efforts to intercede at the State
Department were halted at Branfman's

request. "We received word that he
would be killed if efforts were
continued and we will not do anything
else until we are contacted," the
spokesman said.
Fear of Scandal
Regan said, "Thai is asking us to
work quietly and smoothly and not to
create a scandal that would embarrass
Saigon into doing something drastic."
Silton said she has not yet asked
McCloskey to make further inquiries
in the case because committee
members were unable to meet during
the summer to discuss a plan of action.
Regan added that difficulties in
communicating with Thai are
complicating efforts to lay the legal
groundwork here for his arrival. "Two
months ago our contact with Thai in
Saigon felt that his mail was not safe,"
Regan said. Although the contact later
reopened communication with the
committee, no one has heard from
Thai for about six weeks, Regan said.
Regan Unalarmed
Despite Thai's recent fear that he
might be killed or reimprisoned, Regan
is not alarmed by Thai's silence. "We
know that Thai is okay because our
sources in Saigon would inform
[former Asian Studies Prof.| David
Marr in Berkeley if anything had gone
wrong."
In a letter to Marr on August 5,

Thai cited opposition to his release
from "hawkish Vietnamese officers in
ARVN [Army of the Republic of
Vietnamj headquarters, the war
ministry, the presidential security
(CIA) office, | South Vietnamese
President] Thieu, and Ambassador
Martin himself."
"The legal process is nearly
impossible. To get an exit visa for me
now is like getting one for me to go to
the moon," Thai wrote.
Although Regan sees only a "slim
chance" that Thai will be able to get
out of South Vietnam, he has prepared
a packet of information that will
accompany Stanford's application to
the Immigration and Naturalization
Service for an entry visa for Thai. The
packet includes official invitations
from the University and the ASSU,
offers from the Political Science and
Anthropology departments and the
Professional Journalism Fellowship
program to sponsor Thai's teaching
and research activities at Stanford, and
copies of McCloskey's correspondence
with State Department officials.
But because Thai is applying for
admission to the United States under
section 214 c of the Immigration and
Nationality Act as "an alien of
distinguished merit and ability" the
application cannot be filed until Thai
provides affadavits describing the
degree and extent of his experience
and ability.
Even if the legal and political
barriers to Thai's arrival here are
removed, Regan believes there is a
slight chance that Thai will not accept
the post. "Thai says there is still a
great deal to do in Saigon and sees a
role for himself there in the urban
opposition to Thieu. But if he could
get to the U.S., I feel he'll take the
option."

slight chance that Thai will not accept
the post. "Thai says there is still a
great deal to do in Saigon and sees a
role for himself there in the urban
opposition to Thieu. But if he could
get to the U.S., I feel he'll take the
option."
Nguyen Huu Thai, a South
Vietnamese journalist who has
accepted an offer to teach here this
year as an ASSU guest professor,
remains under house arrest in Saigon
and will not be allowed to leave South
Vietnam until at least October, if at
all.
Thai, who has refused to serve in
the military, will appear at a discharge
hearing next month. If he can be
classified as a security risk on the basis
of his neutralist political orientation
and his journalistic activities, he will
then be eligible to apply for an
identification card, a passport, and an
exit visa.
"But if he doesn't get discharged,
we become concerned again that he
could be sent to a frontier outpost,"
explained Jim Regan, a member of the
committee to bring Thai to Stanford.
Thai has asked the committee to
continue legal preparations for his
arrival in the United States and to
enlist the aid of influential members of
Congress in calling attention to his
case.
Shortly after Thai accepted the
ASSU's invitation last July, Rep. Paul

N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park)
wrote to the congressional liaison on
the Vietnam desk at the State
Department requesting information
and support for Thai's case. Reps.
Bella Abzug(D-N.Y.), and Donald M.
Fraser (D-Minn.), have also made
inquiries at the State Department,
Regan said.
Fraser was acting at the request of
Prof. Richard C. Kagan of Hamline
University, where Thai has been
invited to lecture for a month. Kagan
has also asked U.S. Ambassador to
Vietnam Graham Martin and Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger for help in
securing Thai's release.
Yesterday, liaison officers on the
Vietnam desk and at the Education
Bureau of the State Department told
the Daily that they had not heard of
Thai or of any action taken by the
State Department on his case.
Feels Life Endangered
However, all efforts to free Thai
have reached a temporary standstill
because actions intended to create
pressure in Saigon for Thai's release
might also endanger his life.
In mid-July, Thai expressed fear for
his life in a letter to his sister, Thoa

Branfman, who lives in Washington
D.C. "Suddenly for some reason he
felt the authorities were beginning to
crack down on dissidents of any kind.
Thoa asked us to stop everything we
were doing," said Debbie Silton, a
Thai committee member who
contacted State Department officials
this summer.
A spokesman for McCloskey said
efforts to intercede at the State
Department were halted at Branfman's

request. "We received word that he
would be killed if efforts were
continued and we will not do anything
else until we are contacted," the
spokesman said.
Fear of Scandal
Regan said, "Thai is asking us to
work quietly and smoothly and not to
create a scandal that would embarrass
Saigon into doing something drastic."
Silton said she has not yet asked
McCloskey to make further inquiries
in the case because committee
members were unable to meet during
the summer to discuss a plan of action.
Regan added that difficulties in
communicating with Thai are
complicating efforts to lay the legal
groundwork here for his arrival. "Two
months ago our contact with Thai in
Saigon felt that his mail was not safe,"
Regan said. Although the contact later
reopened communication with the
committee, no one has heard from
Thai for about six weeks, Regan said.
Regan Unalarmed
Despite Thai's recent fear that he
might be killed or reimprisoned, Regan
is not alarmed by Thai's silence. "We
know that Thai is okay because our
sources in Saigon would inform
[former Asian Studies Prof.| David
Marr in Berkeley if anything had gone
wrong."
In a letter to Marr on August 5,

Thai cited opposition to his release
from "hawkish Vietnamese officers in
ARVN [Army of the Republic of
Vietnamj headquarters, the war
ministry, the presidential security
(CIA) office, | South Vietnamese
President] Thieu, and Ambassador
Martin himself."
"The legal process is nearly
impossible. To get an exit visa for me
now is like getting one for me to go to
the moon," Thai wrote.
Although Regan sees only a "slim
chance" that Thai will be able to get
out of South Vietnam, he has prepared
a packet of information that will
accompany Stanford's application to
the Immigration and Naturalization
Service for an entry visa for Thai. The
packet includes official invitations
from the University and the ASSU,
offers from the Political Science and
Anthropology departments and the
Professional Journalism Fellowship
program to sponsor Thai's teaching
and research activities at Stanford, and
copies of McCloskey's correspondence
with State Department officials.
But because Thai is applying for
admission to the United States under
section 214 c of the Immigration and
Nationality Act as "an alien of
distinguished merit and ability" the
application cannot be filed until Thai
provides affadavits describing the
degree and extent of his experience
and ability.
Even if the legal and political
barriers to Thai's arrival here are
removed, Regan believes there is a
slight chance that Thai will not accept
the post. "Thai says there is still a

distinguished merit and ability" the
application cannot be filed until Thai
provides affadavits describing the
degree and extent of his experience
and ability.
Even if the legal and political
barriers to Thai's arrival here are
removed, Regan believes there is a
slight chance that Thai will not accept
the post. "Thai says there is still a
great deal to do in Saigon and sees a
role for himself there in the urban
opposition to Thieu. But if he could
get to the U.S., I feel he'll take the
option."
Nguyen Huu Thai, a South
Vietnamese journalist who has
accepted an offer to teach here this
year as an ASSU guest professor,
remains under house arrest in Saigon
and will not be allowed to leave South
Vietnam until at least October, if at
all.
Thai, who has refused to serve in
the military, will appear at a discharge
hearing next month. If he can be
classified as a security risk on the basis
of his neutralist political orientation
and his journalistic activities, he will
then be eligible to apply for an
identification card, a passport, and an
exit visa.
"But if he doesn't get discharged,
we become concerned again that he
could be sent to a frontier outpost,"
explained Jim Regan, a member of the
committee to bring Thai to Stanford.
Thai has asked the committee to
continue legal preparations for his
arrival in the United States and to
enlist the aid of influential members of
Congress in calling attention to his
case.
Shortly after Thai accepted the
ASSU's invitation last July, Rep. Paul

N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park)
wrote to the congressional liaison on
the Vietnam desk at the State
Department requesting information
and support for Thai's case. Reps.
Bella Abzug(D-N.Y.), and Donald M.
Fraser (D-Minn.), have also made
inquiries at the State Department,
Regan said.
Fraser was acting at the request of
Prof. Richard C. Kagan of Hamline
University, where Thai has been
invited to lecture for a month. Kagan
has also asked U.S. Ambassador to
Vietnam Graham Martin and Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger for help in
securing Thai's release.
Yesterday, liaison officers on the
Vietnam desk and at the Education
Bureau of the State Department told
the Daily that they had not heard of
Thai or of any action taken by the
State Department on his case.
Feels Life Endangered
However, all efforts to free Thai
have reached a temporary standstill
because actions intended to create
pressure in Saigon for Thai's release
might also endanger his life.
In mid-July, Thai expressed fear for
his life in a letter to his sister, Thoa

Branfman, who lives in Washington
D.C. "Suddenly for some reason he
felt the authorities were beginning to
crack down on dissidents of any kind.
Thoa asked us to stop everything we
were doing," said Debbie Silton, a
Thai committee member who
contacted State Department officials
this summer.
A spokesman for McCloskey said
efforts to intercede at the State
Department were halted at Branfman's

request. "We received word that he
would be killed if efforts were
continued and we will not do anything
else until we are contacted," the
spokesman said.
Fear of Scandal
Regan said, "Thai is asking us to
work quietly and smoothly and not to
create a scandal that would embarrass
Saigon into doing something drastic."
Silton said she has not yet asked
McCloskey to make further inquiries
in the case because committee
members were unable to meet during
the summer to discuss a plan of action.
Regan added that difficulties in
communicating with Thai are
complicating efforts to lay the legal
groundwork here for his arrival. "Two
months ago our contact with Thai in
Saigon felt that his mail was not safe,"
Regan said. Although the contact later
reopened communication with the
committee, no one has heard from
Thai for about six weeks, Regan said.
Regan Unalarmed
Despite Thai's recent fear that he
might be killed or reimprisoned, Regan
is not alarmed by Thai's silence. "We
know that Thai is okay because our
sources in Saigon would inform
[former Asian Studies Prof.| David
Marr in Berkeley if anything had gone
wrong."
In a letter to Marr on August 5,

Thai cited opposition to his release
from "hawkish Vietnamese officers in
ARVN [Army of the Republic of
Vietnamj headquarters, the war
ministry, the presidential security
(CIA) office, | South Vietnamese
President] Thieu, and Ambassador
Martin himself."
"The legal process is nearly
impossible. To get an exit visa for me
now is like getting one for me to go to
the moon," Thai wrote.
Although Regan sees only a "slim
chance" that Thai will be able to get
out of South Vietnam, he has prepared
a packet of information that will
accompany Stanford's application to
the Immigration and Naturalization
Service for an entry visa for Thai. The
packet includes official invitations
from the University and the ASSU,
offers from the Political Science and
Anthropology departments and the
Professional Journalism Fellowship
program to sponsor Thai's teaching
and research activities at Stanford, and
copies of McCloskey's correspondence
with State Department officials.
But because Thai is applying for
admission to the United States under
section 214 c of the Immigration and
Nationality Act as "an alien of
distinguished merit and ability" the
application cannot be filed until Thai
provides affadavits describing the
degree and extent of his experience
and ability.
