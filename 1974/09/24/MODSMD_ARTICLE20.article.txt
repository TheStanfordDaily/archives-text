# Survey Indicates Increased Interest In Advanced Degrees Among Women
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The percentage of women
entering Stanford with plans to
obtain doctorates or medical or
legal degrees has doubled in the
past five years according to data
supplied by the American Council
on Education, from
questionnaires administered to 20
percent of last year's freshman
class.
According to a similar — but
not identical — survey taken in
1968, only 32 percent of the
female freshman planned to seek
Ph.D.s, M.D.s or LL.Bs. In fact,
more than 25 percent of the
women planned to stop with a
bachelor's degree or less.
The 1973 data revealed that
less than 10 percent of the women
fell into that category, with 62
percent planning to pursue Ph.D.s,
M.D.s or L.L.B.s. Moreover, the
percentage of women seeking law
degrees exceeds the percentage of
like-minded men (19.5 percent
versus 17.2 percent).
The 1973 survey also showed
"figures | which | tend to explode
the often-ex pressed concern that
Stanford is becoming a school for
the rich and the pour at the

expense of the 'middle income'
group," notes John D. Black,
director of research for the dean
of Student Affairs office, in his
report on the survey.
If the "middle-income" group
covered the $10,000 to $30,000
range, nearly hal-f the freshmen
would be included, states Black. If
it were confined to the $12,500
to $25,000 range, one-third of the
class would be included, he added.
There has been a huge increase in
the number of students from
families with parental incomes of
over $30,000 a year. Much of this
increase, Black observes, has been
"at the expense of the least
affluent families, who were
already under-represented." The
number of freshmen from families
earning less than $10,000 has
dropped from about 20 percent of
the class in 1968 to less than nine
percent. The percentage of
students in the $10,000-$20,000 a
year bracket has also been cut in
half.
Over half of the freshmen
indicated that they consider
themselves to be "liberals" and
nearly a third described
themselves as

' 'middle-of-the-roaders," with
very few students placing
themselves at the extremes of the
political spectrum. -"Thus, if they
graduate as mostly liberals, the
onus or the credit can scarcely
belong to the University," he
concluded.
Attitudes on several social
issues have shifted in the liberal
direction, with more students
favoring the legalization of
marijuana and consideration of
student opinion on faculty
promotions, and more students
opposing administrative control of
student publications and a
tougher policy on student
protests. An exception to this
liberal drift is a general opposition
to the idea of giving preferential
treatment in admissions to
students from disadvantaged
social backgrounds. Almost half
the freshmen supported such a
policy in 1968, but only about
one-fourth do now.
If their current ideas on having
children remain the same,
Stanford parents will eventually
contribute to zero population
growth. Stanford graduates would
generate 1934 children for each

1000 couples,"states Black. Twice
the percentage of women as of
men plan on no children at all —
a reflection of the fact that more
men than women considered
raising a family an essential or
very important goal. Very few
students expected to have only
one child.
The University's competition
with other schools for prospective
students has increased
substantially. In 1968, only 43
percent of the freshman had
applied to four or more schools
and only 29 percent had four or
more acceptances. Over half of
the 1973 class applied to four or
more schools, and 40 percent
were accepted by four or more
schools.
Although the percentage of
students who cite wanting to live
away from home as an important
factor in their decision to attend
Stanford has remained stable,
"the desire to live away from
home may put added pressure on
our housing facilities," said Black.
Ranking of personal goals
remained the same with one
exception: financial status. From
a list of twelve goals, students
were asked to show which they
considered "essential" or "very
important." Developing a
philosophy of life got the most
votes, followed by helping others
in difficulty, keeping up with
political affairs, being an
authority in the students field,
raising a family and being very
well-off financially. The number
of students concerned with this
goal jumped from less than a third
of the class in 1968 to nearly half
the class in 1973.
In religious preference, the
data shows a rise in
n on-Protestant religious
preferences, and in those
professing no religious preference
at all—both at the expense of the
declared Protestants.
