# 'African Drought And Famine
## Course Studies Human Crisis 
### PHILIP FEDER 
"African Drought and
Famine," a new course taught by
an inter-disciplinary team of
scholars from Stanford, Harvard,
Columbia and the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI), will
study the West . African
predicament "as an example of
the crisis millions of human beings
elsewhere are facing or may soon
face," said Prof. J. Paul Irwin,
course sponsor.
The set of 19 free public
lectures is a direct outgrowth of
last year's student drives to
provide aid for Africans suffering
from drought and famine in the
Sahel Region. The Stanford
African Famine Relief Committee
(AFRC) collected $15,000.
The opening program
tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in
Tresidder Union will feature a
film, The Sahel, produced by Carl
Rowan and J.C. Hay ward.
Melissa Lawson, AFRC
chairman last year, designed the
course with Glenn Jordan, a 1973
graduate who majored in
psychology and afro-American
studies.
Current Application
The purpose of the course is to
"apply political, economic,
historical, technological and
ecological analyses to a current
situation—the drought in the
Sudano-Sahel region of Africa,"
Lawson said.
During fall quarter—the first
quarter of a year-long
course—guest lecturers will discuss
the famine problem during Irwin's
sponsorship. In the winter and
spring, Asst. Prof. Tetteh Kofi of
the Food Research Institute will
direct a seminar, helping students
on research papers.
"In the spring, we envision an
edited publication, a book,
compiling all of our papers," said
Jordan, a research assistant for the
course. "The book will consist of
150-200 pages of informative and
illustrated materials written such
that the general public will readily
understand it."
Partially supported by National
Defense Education Act funds, the

course is designed to increase
public awareness of the African
famine and "to explore whether
the human and technological
resources of the Bay Area can be
used in some fashion" to alleviate
it, according to the chairman of
the Committee on African
Studies, Prof. David Abernethy.
Larger Issue
Irwin said, "The course and the
public lectures are designed to
address, through the case of the
Sahel, a larger human issue."
Lawson emphasized the human
issue in her campaign to arouse
public awareness and to raise
contributions for the
famine-stricken victims of West
Africa.
"The steadily deteriorating
situation in six West African
countries is such that anywhere

from 6-13 million people could
die within the year. The
economies of six nations have
been shattered as food and seed
grains are exhausted," she said.
Lawson saw the effects of
drought and famine in the Sahel
first hand.
Upon returning here last fall,
she chaired the AFRC. She now
works in Sacramento as West Coast
representative for Relief for
Americans in Need in the Sahel
(RAINS) and serves as a
discussion leader in the African
famine course.
Among the featured speakers
in the series will be Columbia
University Anthropology Prof.
Elliott Skinner, and Stanford
Professors Joseph Greenberg,
James Gibbs,' St. Clair Drake,
Irwin, Abernethy, and Kofi.
