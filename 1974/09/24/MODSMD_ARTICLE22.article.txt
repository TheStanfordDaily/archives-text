# Tom And Mary Dallas: Fruits Are Their Business
## 
### RAY SQUITIERI 
On a cool overcast morning, Mary and Tom
Dallas stand beside a eucalyptus tree near
White Plaza, under a large umbrella. Apples,
oranges, pears, tangerines and strawberries
crowd the table in front of them.
They are an oddly matched pair: she with
her smooth even contralto voice and
expressive, arresting eyes; he, with his grainy
tenor and peppery manner. Mary speaks first.
"My life was always a beautiful life. Really,
I had the most pleasant life anybody can
desire—happiness, comfort, every thing."
She accents the syllables as if still speaking
Italian. Underneath a white shawl she wears a
plain black dress. She is taking apples and
pears from boxes at her feet and carefully
arranging them before her on the table. Deep
lines in her 70-year-old olive-toned face blend
easily into a smile.
Tom stands 5-feet-8. He is not thin, but the
tendons are visible in his neck and hands. He
wears a faded plaid sport shirt, collar button
closed, and loose, brown cotton pants. Some
grey shows through his three-day growth of
beard. Tom smiles less than his wife does.
Sudden gestures and abrupt changes of subject
punctuate his speech.
A man with a beard selects an apple, hands
Tom a quarter, and walks away. Thirty-five
years ago that apple you could buy for three
cents. Now it's a quarter. Now the farmers
make more money than executives. Subsidies.
Anything for the politicians so they can put
some money in their pockets," Tom
complains.
Met On The Crossing
Mary came from Rome to Boston in 1937.
Tom had come from Lucca, near Florence.
They met on the crossing, fell in love one day
in Provincetown, Mass., as Mary recalls,
singing Italian songs to each other, she in
Italian, he in English.
In 1939 they were married. They came to
Menlo Park in the late '40s, and he opened a
cafe catering to students and professors here.
Later, in San Francisco, they had another one,
near Hastings Law School.
When Tom had a heart attack, he had to
quit heavy work, so they sold the restaurant.
They have been here for nearly two years.
Mary smiles broadly, remembering the

dressmaking business she had in Italy.
"Always I liked to create. I think the
enjoyment you have for a piece of material, to
make something different, it is tremendous."
She explains that she used to travel around
northern Italy showing her designs to wealthy
women. With six seamstresses working for her.
Mary made enough money in two years to
take her family on a vacation to the United
States.
When she left Italy, Mary was engaged, but
troubled with doubts about her impending
marriage. "I was not sure of myself," she
recalls. "I said to my boyfriend, 'Give me
time. I want to take this trip to America. I
want to see what is the reaction after I see
more of this world.' When I left Italy, I was
33 years old. I was very independent. That's

why I come here."
'A Very Busy Being'
As their children were grownig up, Mary
maintained the dressmaking business, but on a
smaller scale. "I was taking care of the house,
helping my husband in the restaurant—so
many times he would say, 'Come on. The
waitress is stealing from the cash register.
Come on and help me.' I was a very busy
being," she says, laughing.
As proud of her business acumen she is of
her skill as a designer, Mary reports that in
one year here she made ten thousand dollars.
"1 bought three homes with the money I
made in dressmaking," she says, but gave up
the business about five years ago.
Tom's father was a railroad engineer. As a
child, Tom's education was interrupted by

frequent moves and several wars. His family
was in Asia Minor when war broke out in
1911. Tom was five.
"The Turks really hated the Armenians and
the Greeks," he recalls. "They used to
slaughter them out in the street. I saw it with
my own eyes." At the outbreak of the war his
family left for Italy, but returned to Turkey
the next year. In 1914 they were caught by
the opening of World War I, in which Tom's
father was killed. "He was in the intelligence
department and he was shot. Put up against
the wall. Boom."
Name Changed
Tom puts his handb in his pockets and
surveys White Plaza, looking just over the
heads of those in the moving crowd. He
explains how he changed his name.
"My original name is Tomaso DiPiero
De' Medici. My father's parents took the
De' Medici off and they left only DiPiero. So 1
took the DiPiero off and made it
Dallas—Texas. Easy.
"I was traveling around Texas and 1 says,
"Dallas, there's a nice name that nobody can
mispronounce. So when I went in the army I
told the judge to change my name. He says to
me, 'You have a wonderful name. Why you
want to change it?'
Pronunciation
"Nobody can pronounce it,' I said. So he
had me sign both names in my naturalization
papers."
Tom was drafted in 1943 and discharged,
at his request, in 1944. He looks away and
speculates on that.
"I knew the Army life was no good," he
says. "But what are you going to do? You
have to go out killing people, and who's
gaining? Nobody. Even the victors are losers."
His expression becomes more speculative.
But "Maybe 1 should have stayed in. The
pension. Maybe I would have been an officer.
Somebody. Anybody."
'Naked Or Filthy'
Two young long-haired blue-jeaned men
walk by. Tom points toward them. The
corners of his mouth turn down. "The student
today, he's not like his great grandfather,
dignified and well-dressed when he used to go
to school.
Going to school is just like going to

church—for a new life. When you go to school
is just like when you go to church. You don't
go to church naked or filthy or dirty or
swearing, do you? When a man if filthy, then
he's arrogant. He's nothing but a wild animal.
At the other end of the table, Mary has
kinder words for students. "The youth of
today, it is very nice, very respectable, very
dependable. And very intelligent. Very smart.
"My own children," she continues," are in
Menlo Park. One is a pilot. The other is a
banker. Two beautiful children. They never
give me any trouble."
Likes The Climate
Mary likes the Bay Area climate which, she
says, reminds her of Italy. How does she like
her work? "1 enjoy it very much. I talk with
the people, and in my age you need something
like that.
"1 wish all the old people understand what
to do with themselves. Instead I see so many
of them stay home."
She leans over as if offering advice. "We are
never home, my husband and I. We go home
at night, go to a restaurant and eat, have a
little recreation. I believe you have to be
home just when you are sick."
Mary talks about her marriage. "1 was 35
when I was married. It changed me: I acquired
more patience.
"Men sometimes think the power is in
yelling, to do things. No. The power is not in
the strain, or yelling. It is when the thing lasts
longer. This is a Platonic idea. I remember,
"None la forza chc vincc, ma la durata.' It is
not force that wins out, but endurance.
"My husband is a little different. He
doesn't want me to put so much time for the
children's affairs. He wants me all for himself.
My husband says, 'They want you there
because they want you to mind the kids.' I
don't know if he is jealous.
"He is less happy than me because of this
kind of idea he has. I'm happy because I like
to make people happy.
"I think this way: don't be afraid to give.
Don't give what you need personally, but if
you have something more, if you have love,
give. Always you get back much more. I have
a daughter-in-law and I spent five years to
help her very much in raising three children. I
did all I can for her.
