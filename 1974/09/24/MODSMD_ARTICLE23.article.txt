# Pleasing Pastry Preparations Featured At Tresidder Concession

### SANDY WHITE 
Marcel Behr just can't retire
from the pastry business.
Apprenticed at age 13 in
Alsace, France, after more than
40 years and countless ovens, he's
still baking pies, cakes, donuts and
rolls. The same pastries he once
prepared for patrons of the Pierre
Hotel in New York and the Sir
Francis Drake in San Francisco
now grace the plates of Stanford
students between classes.
When University officials first
decided to discontinue the
cafeteria in favor of a fast-food
format, they planned to open at
11 each morning. Behr, who has
done all the baking for Tresidder
for four years, saw a good
opportunity. He offered to lease
the bakery and fountain from the
university, agreeing to open at 7
a.m. and provide breakfast for
starving students.
His offer met with enthusiasm
and now Behr has his own red and
blue canopied concession in the
union.
Pastry Collection
Visitors to "Marcel's" can buy
any of a large collection of
pastries, including apple
turnovers, prune filled sweet rolls,
bear claws, orange rolls, cream
puffs, eclairs, napoleons, southern
pecan pie, cheese-cake, and cake.
Coffees, tea, milk and orange juice
are also available.
As his own boss, Behr has
expanded the selection and

improved the quality of foods, he
says."The stuff is only as good as
the ingredients. I buy only the
best now," such as better instead
of margarine.
Pointing out that Tresidder losl,
$100,000 last year and $250,000
the year before, Behr wonders
"how the university puts up with
it."
Will he make money? "We have
to," he says. "I've started three
bakeries and they've all made

money." His key to success is
experience. "If you know what
you're doing, you make money."
Retail Bakers Decline
Retail bakers, facing stiff
competition from wholesalers and
grocery- stores, are hard to find.
Behr cites the decline in the
number of retail bakers in recent
years on the peninsula. "If you
squander, throw things away, it
doesn't take long to lose your
shirt in this business." As for not
squandering. Marcel uses all
leftovers, usually to make crumbs
for cakes.
"Bakers here I in America] are
not what they should be. The best
ones come from Europe," says
Behr. French bakers learn their
trade in high school, as he did.
"You must be born into it,"he
explains. His father was a grocer,
so "he was also involved with
baking— flour, and eggs, and
butter." After his apprenticeship,
Behr went to Paris, where he
spent four years working for a
major catering company.
'A Better Life'
From Paris he moved on to
New York, and he's lived in the
United States ever since. "There's
something about this country that
grows on you. It isn't money— it's
a better life.
"Things are less restricted;
there is more freedom here." He
and his Texan wife Louise, who
handles his sales, like to vacation
in Europe. "But I can't wait to

come back here," he says.
After Paris, Behr worked as
second pastry chef at the Pierre
Hotel for three years. He signed
on as chief baker for Matson lines
for another three years.
Cruising on the Mariposa
through the South Pacific, he
ended up in San Francisco at the
Sir Francis Drake. He was so
successful as pastry chef there
that he opened a retail store on
Sutter Street.
Self-Owned Business
But after 14 years of that,
Marcel decided to go into business
for himself. He started a bakery in
San Mateo, and soon after another
one in Menlo Park, which he ran
for 18 years.
He decided to retire, but not
wishing to "deteriorate", he took
the Tresidder job, which he
describes as "very easy." That
includes arriving at 4 a.m.
Marcel looks to be in no danger
of deteriorating. Reasonably trim
for a baker, he calls himself a
"health food fiend." He and
Louise both enjoy gourmet
cooking, and their rosy cheeks
attest to their success. But he
almost never eats pastries, he says,
because he's trying to cut down
on fats.
Full Line Of Goods
That doesn't discourage
anyone else from eating his goods,
though. If he's as successful as he
hopes he will be, Behr plans to
open a full line of retail goods in
Tresidder, possibly within a year.
Students could come buy a
loaf of bread or a whole cake.
Behr already caters weddings, and
sells rolls to Guckenheimer and
TDS, the two firms handling
catering out of Tresidder.
