## Wakeman's 'Journey' Once Around The Turntable 
### 
Rick Wakeman
Journey To The Centre Of The Earth
A&M SP 3621
Last year, Rick Wakeman, former keyboard man
of Yes, released one of the year's finest albums,
The Six Wives of Henry VII. It was only a prelude,
however, to the big project which Wakeman has
had in the back of his mind for years, a musical
adaptation of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center
of the Earth, complete with symphony orchestra.
Wakeman ran into a few problems in recording it
however, the major one being caused by the vinyl
shortage. Though originally planned as a 2-record
set, Journey had to be pared down to one disc.
Now that it is here, however, we can be glad that
it only is one record, because Journey is hardly the
masterwork that one might have expected from
Wakeman.
Shows Sophistication
The album has its good points, such as the fact
that it is more sophisticated than most other
attempts to mix rock and classical music. For
example, on many of the albums which groups have
done with orchestras (usually with the London
Symphony, which Wakeman has used on Journey),
the orchestra could usually be replaced by a
mellotron, as all the sections are playing the part.
The arrangements here are somewhat more
sophisticated, though the credit for this goes more
to arrangers Wil Malone and Danny Beckerman
than to Wakeman.
Anyway, Rick Wakeman at his worst and most
pretentious is still better than most other artists
now on the charts. If you plan to buy this album,
don't think of it as a major rock symphony;
instead, use it as background music, and you'll find*
that it is very nice.
Narration A Detraction
Now, for the reasons this album should hardly
be a commercial success: First of all, there is David
Hemming's narration. One has to wonder if it was
necessary. Perhaps the story could have been
included only in the liner notes.
The constant breaks for narration really destroy
the continuity of the music and turns it into "a
nerve-wracking series of interludes between the
Choir's appearances and Hemming's vain attempts
to match Laurence Olivier's diction," to quote
Rolling Stone.
Did somebody mention a choir? While Wakeman
used voices for background sound on the
mostly-instrumental Six Wives this is the first time
he has written lyrics and has a singer out front.

More than once, it sounds as if Wakeman has
pulled someone out of the audience at random and
put them in front of the mike. Really, some of
these people can't sing.
Realistic Mediocrity
The only possible explanation that I can think
of is that since the singers are playing the roles of
scientists and explorers, and as your average
scientist or explorer cannot sing, Wakeman, in an
attempt at realism, chose people who could not
sing to play the roles.
But the most glaring fault of Journey is the basic
content itself. The music usually just does not fit
the story. The narrator and vocalists are minor
things that could have been changed, but when the
music itself does not work you have a real problem.
The thing which made Six Wives such a fine
album was that the music fit the concept so well.
Each piece created a definite mood and the listener
could get a true feeling for the type of personality
Wakeman was trying to convey for each wife.
Soul Train
This is hardly the case here. In one portion of
Journey, two of the explorers become accidentally
separated. Hemmings intones, "By means of their
chronometers they discovered that they were four
miles apart, so Axel set about the task of joining
the professor." But the music which follows sounds
as if Axel has suddently turned a corner and
stumbled onto the set of Soul Train, right there,
thousands of feet below the earth.
Did Jules Vernes talk about Axel boogying his
way back to the professor? This is not to say that
all the music does not work, but the little that does
is so chopped up by narration that it is difficult to
appreciate.
In the end, I believe that Wakeman has
overextended himself on this album. The best
description of it is pretentious. What is so amazing
is that this is the man who could take an equally
challenging theme such as the six wives of Henry
VII and make it work.
Other Reason
But the fact that this is a less-than-satisfying
album is not what hurts most. Everyone is entitled
to have an occasional failure.
What hurts is that Rick Wakeman has left Yes in
order to pursue a solo career, partly because of the
tremendous response to this album (it turned gold
within six weeks of its release). That he would
abandon such an important role in one of the most
vital groups in existence in order to make more
pretentious and self-serving albums such as this
outrages me.

NEW STYLE ROCK—Rick Wakeman's new album, Journey To The Centre Of The Earth, represents a
departure in style both for Wakeman and for rock music. The rock opera consists of Wakeman's
extraordinary keyboard playing backed up by both the London Symphony Orchestra and the English
Chamber Choir. Actor David Hemmings narrates the tale which is based on Jules Vernes novel of the same
name. Wakeman's next album is slated to be based on the legend of King Arthur and the knights of the
Round Table. Wakeman and the National Philharmonic Orchestra of America and Choir will be appearing
in concert in San Francisco this Friday night. David Measham will conduct the extravaganza at the San
Francisco Civic Auditorium at 8 p.m.

Chamber Choir. Actor David Hemmings narrates the tale which is based on Jules Vernes novel of the same

Rick Wakeman
Journey To The Centre Of The Earth
A&M SP 3621
Last year, Rick Wakeman, former keyboard man
of Yes, released one of the year's finest albums,
The Six Wives of Henry VII. It was only a prelude,
however, to the big project which Wakeman has
had in the back of his mind for years, a musical
adaptation of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center
of the Earth, complete with symphony orchestra.
Wakeman ran into a few problems in recording it
however, the major one being caused by the vinyl
shortage. Though originally planned as a 2-record
set, Journey had to be pared down to one disc.
Now that it is here, however, we can be glad that
it only is one record, because Journey is hardly the
masterwork that one might have expected from
Wakeman.
Shows Sophistication
The album has its good points, such as the fact
that it is more sophisticated than most other
attempts to mix rock and classical music. For
example, on many of the albums which groups have
done with orchestras (usually with the London
Symphony, which Wakeman has used on Journey),
the orchestra could usually be replaced by a
mellotron, as all the sections are playing the part.
The arrangements here are somewhat more
sophisticated, though the credit for this goes more
to arrangers Wil Malone and Danny Beckerman
than to Wakeman.
Anyway, Rick Wakeman at his worst and most
pretentious is still better than most other artists
now on the charts. If you plan to buy this album,
don't think of it as a major rock symphony;
instead, use it as background music, and you'll find*
that it is very nice.
Narration A Detraction
Now, for the reasons this album should hardly
be a commercial success: First of all, there is David
Hemming's narration. One has to wonder if it was
necessary. Perhaps the story could have been
included only in the liner notes.
The constant breaks for narration really destroy
the continuity of the music and turns it into "a
nerve-wracking series of interludes between the
Choir's appearances and Hemming's vain attempts
to match Laurence Olivier's diction," to quote
Rolling Stone.
Did somebody mention a choir? While Wakeman
used voices for background sound on the
mostly-instrumental Six Wives this is the first time
he has written lyrics and has a singer out front.

More than once, it sounds as if Wakeman has
pulled someone out of the audience at random and
put them in front of the mike. Really, some of
these people can't sing.
Realistic Mediocrity
The only possible explanation that I can think
of is that since the singers are playing the roles of
scientists and explorers, and as your average
scientist or explorer cannot sing, Wakeman, in an
attempt at realism, chose people who could not
sing to play the roles.
But the most glaring fault of Journey is the basic
content itself. The music usually just does not fit
the story. The narrator and vocalists are minor
things that could have been changed, but when the
music itself does not work you have a real problem.
The thing which made Six Wives such a fine
album was that the music fit the concept so well.
Each piece created a definite mood and the listener
could get a true feeling for the type of personality
Wakeman was trying to convey for each wife.
Soul Train
This is hardly the case here. In one portion of
Journey, two of the explorers become accidentally
separated. Hemmings intones, "By means of their
chronometers they discovered that they were four
miles apart, so Axel set about the task of joining
the professor." But the music which follows sounds
as if Axel has suddently turned a corner and
stumbled onto the set of Soul Train, right there,
thousands of feet below the earth.
Did Jules Vernes talk about Axel boogying his
way back to the professor? This is not to say that
all the music does not work, but the little that does
is so chopped up by narration that it is difficult to
appreciate.
In the end, I believe that Wakeman has
overextended himself on this album. The best
description of it is pretentious. What is so amazing
is that this is the man who could take an equally
challenging theme such as the six wives of Henry
VII and make it work.
Other Reason
But the fact that this is a less-than-satisfying
album is not what hurts most. Everyone is entitled
to have an occasional failure.
What hurts is that Rick Wakeman has left Yes in
order to pursue a solo career, partly because of the
tremendous response to this album (it turned gold
within six weeks of its release). That he would
abandon such an important role in one of the most
vital groups in existence in order to make more
pretentious and self-serving albums such as this
outrages me.

abandon such an important role in one of the most
vital groups in existence in order to make more
pretentious and self-serving albums such as this
outrages me.

NEW STYLE ROCK—Rick Wakeman's new album, Journey To The Centre Of The Earth, represents a
departure in style both for Wakeman and for rock music. The rock opera consists of Wakeman's
extraordinary keyboard playing backed up by both the London Symphony Orchestra and the English
Chamber Choir. Actor David Hemmings narrates the tale which is based on Jules Vernes novel of the same
name. Wakeman's next album is slated to be based on the legend of King Arthur and the knights of the
Round Table. Wakeman and the National Philharmonic Orchestra of America and Choir will be appearing
in concert in San Francisco this Friday night. David Measham will conduct the extravaganza at the San
Francisco Civic Auditorium at 8 p.m.
Rick Wakeman
Journey To The Centre Of The Earth
A&M SP 3621
Last year, Rick Wakeman, former keyboard man
of Yes, released one of the year's finest albums,
The Six Wives of Henry VII. It was only a prelude,
however, to the big project which Wakeman has
had in the back of his mind for years, a musical
adaptation of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center
of the Earth, complete with symphony orchestra.
Wakeman ran into a few problems in recording it
however, the major one being caused by the vinyl
shortage. Though originally planned as a 2-record
set, Journey had to be pared down to one disc.
Now that it is here, however, we can be glad that
it only is one record, because Journey is hardly the
masterwork that one might have expected from
Wakeman.
Shows Sophistication
The album has its good points, such as the fact
that it is more sophisticated than most other
attempts to mix rock and classical music. For
example, on many of the albums which groups have
done with orchestras (usually with the London
Symphony, which Wakeman has used on Journey),
the orchestra could usually be replaced by a
mellotron, as all the sections are playing the part.
The arrangements here are somewhat more
sophisticated, though the credit for this goes more
to arrangers Wil Malone and Danny Beckerman
than to Wakeman.
Anyway, Rick Wakeman at his worst and most
pretentious is still better than most other artists
now on the charts. If you plan to buy this album,
don't think of it as a major rock symphony;
instead, use it as background music, and you'll find*
that it is very nice.
Narration A Detraction
Now, for the reasons this album should hardly
be a commercial success: First of all, there is David
Hemming's narration. One has to wonder if it was
necessary. Perhaps the story could have been
included only in the liner notes.
The constant breaks for narration really destroy
the continuity of the music and turns it into "a
nerve-wracking series of interludes between the
Choir's appearances and Hemming's vain attempts
to match Laurence Olivier's diction," to quote
Rolling Stone.
Did somebody mention a choir? While Wakeman
used voices for background sound on the
mostly-instrumental Six Wives this is the first time
he has written lyrics and has a singer out front.

More than once, it sounds as if Wakeman has
pulled someone out of the audience at random and
put them in front of the mike. Really, some of
these people can't sing.
Realistic Mediocrity
The only possible explanation that I can think
of is that since the singers are playing the roles of
scientists and explorers, and as your average
scientist or explorer cannot sing, Wakeman, in an
attempt at realism, chose people who could not
sing to play the roles.
But the most glaring fault of Journey is the basic
content itself. The music usually just does not fit
the story. The narrator and vocalists are minor
things that could have been changed, but when the
music itself does not work you have a real problem.
The thing which made Six Wives such a fine
album was that the music fit the concept so well.
Each piece created a definite mood and the listener
could get a true feeling for the type of personality
Wakeman was trying to convey for each wife.
Soul Train
This is hardly the case here. In one portion of
Journey, two of the explorers become accidentally
separated. Hemmings intones, "By means of their
chronometers they discovered that they were four
miles apart, so Axel set about the task of joining
the professor." But the music which follows sounds
as if Axel has suddently turned a corner and
stumbled onto the set of Soul Train, right there,
thousands of feet below the earth.
Did Jules Vernes talk about Axel boogying his
way back to the professor? This is not to say that
all the music does not work, but the little that does
is so chopped up by narration that it is difficult to
appreciate.
In the end, I believe that Wakeman has
overextended himself on this album. The best
description of it is pretentious. What is so amazing
is that this is the man who could take an equally
challenging theme such as the six wives of Henry
VII and make it work.
Other Reason
But the fact that this is a less-than-satisfying
album is not what hurts most. Everyone is entitled
to have an occasional failure.
What hurts is that Rick Wakeman has left Yes in
order to pursue a solo career, partly because of the
tremendous response to this album (it turned gold
within six weeks of its release). That he would
abandon such an important role in one of the most
vital groups in existence in order to make more
pretentious and self-serving albums such as this
