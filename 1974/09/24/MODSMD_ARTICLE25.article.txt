## Welby, Marshall And Now ... Tanner

Dick Cavett recently commented that television is generally geared
to the mentality of an eight-year-old. Couldn't we at least try for 11,
he asked.
In response to this and similar criticisms, network executives are
currently trying to make up for last year's myriad of flops with what
Newsweek labels a "season of atonement."
NBC boasts loudest of its "conscious effort to raise the level of
human relationships." However, if a new show called Lucas Tanner is
any indication, the sins of the past have yet to be cleansed away.
We wanted to review this show first because we liked the idea.
Remembering the moving stories of Mr. Novak and the frequently
touching humor of Room 222, we know that stories about high
school teachers and students have potential. But, alas, we have learned
— Lucas Tanner may deal with eleventh graders but the series seems to
be aimed at a first grade mind.
The show has two major problems: characters that lack real deptl
and incoherent scripts containing more bromides than cleanser.
Producer David Victor (the man behind Owen Marshall and
Marcus Welby — notice that each of these names contains four
syllables) has now created the Marcus Welby of the teaching
profession. Not only is Tanner like Welby, a widower, but he is just
too perfect, too much of an all-around guy. And that detracts from
his believability.
He is supposed to be a combination of Socrates, Plato and Charles
Atlas. As a press release puts it, he "teaches English, coaches the
baseball team, counsels students, is a former big-league pitcher and an
ex-sportswriter and plays the saxophone." This is a realistic high
school teacher? Did anybody ever have a teacher like this?
David Hartman, formerly of the Bold Ones, and an ex-baseball
player, is an excellent actor but what can he do with corny lines like:
"Winning's not everything; every kid should have a chance to
participate in sports even if it's what he doesn't do best."
Tanner frequently gets too philosophical — perhaps not bad by
itself — but the lines often coupled with mushy background music are
just so goody-goody, i.e. "A few famous names sparkled through a
piece will make people read it and a few generous truths will make
people accept it." Hopefully a few generous critics will spare people
watching it.
The only other regular characters in the series, the principal
(Rosemary Murphy) and the little boy next door (Robbie Rist)
merely serve to glorify Tanner. As for acting ability, the principal
smiles nicely and the boy has complicated lines like, "Lucas never
breaks a promise." He certainly breaks up an otherwise pleasant
evening.
Because the scripts are predominantly based around the life of
Lucas Tanner, they become superficial and incoherent. We see so
many sides of Tanner so quickly that we find it hard to accept him as
a person. Worst of all, the scripts don't deal with issues of any
importance other than how will Lucas show his goodness this week?
And if they do deal with controversy, Tanner remains the major focus
In "Instant Replay," a recent episode, in which a lady journalist
tried to convince Tanner to come back to work for her, a more
important story concerned a student seeking attention and help from
Tanner. Finally, Tanner discovered that he owed his time to the
student and not to his writing career.
Through the use of relevant names and words — "Jimmie
Connors," "Hank Aaron" and "Stonewall" — the scriptwriters again
showed us what a great man Tanner is. But the more important story
of the young man in trouble was overshadowed by Tanner's life.
Watching Lucas Tanner is indeed like taking asprin — you might get
better, you won't get worse, but you're bound to get sleepy.
We suggest that he not be granted tenure.
Lucas Tanner can be seen Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on NBC (Channel 4).
