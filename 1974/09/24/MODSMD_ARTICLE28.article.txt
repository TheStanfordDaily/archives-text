Rockefeller Denies Conflict Of ® n t ere8 t
WASHINGTON — Nelson A. Rockefeller told Congress
yesterday that the concept his family can control the
nation's economy through a vast, interlocking financial
empire is a myth.
He assured members of the Senate Rules and
Administration Committee that his own substantial and
diversified fortune will pose no conflict of interest should
he be confirmed to be vice president.
"If I had spent a lifetime of abusing economic power, I
assume I wouldn't be sitting here today," Rockefeller said.
He said also he cannot rule out the possibility he may
seek the presidency in 1976 should President P'ord choose
not to run.
Testifying at the opening of his confirmation hearings,
Rockefeller disclosed that over the past 10 years he has had
earnings totalling $46.8 million on which he paid federal,
state and local taxes totalling $21.7 million.
The 66-year-old former New York governor said that
over his lifetime he has paid $69 million in taxes. He said he
would not object if the committee publishes his tax returns
for the last 10 years.
Most of the early questioning which followed
Rockefeller's reading of a 72-page statement centered on
his fortune and the pardoning of former President Richard
M. Nixon.
Ford, Kissinger Caution Oil Nations
DETROIT — President Ford and Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger told the Arab oil producing nations in
separate speeches yesterday that the world cannot and will
not stand exorbitant or rigged oil prices. The two U.S.
officials warned of global depression.
Ford, speaking at the opening session of the World
Energy Conference in Detroit, told an audience that
included Saudi Arabia's oil minister:
''Sovereign nations cannot allow their policies to be
dictated, or their fate decided, by artificial rigging and
distortion of world commodity markets. No one can foresee
the extent of the damage nor the end of the disastrous
consequences if nations refuse to share nature's gifts for the
benefit of all mankind."
The President urged global energy cooperation under a
program he called "Project Interdependence." He said
exorbitant oil prices can "threaten the breakdown of world
order and safety."
At the United Nations, Kissinger told the oil producing
nations that their artificially high prices and production
cutbacks could push the world over the brink into general
depression.
If the inflationary spiral is not restrained through a "new
understanding" between consumers and producers, the high
cost of petroleum could shatter the fragile international
economic system, dealing a staggering blow particularly to
the poorer countries, he said in an address to the 29th
session of the General Assembly.
Congressmen Tour Ft. Knox
FT. KNOX, Ky. — The Bureau of the Mint took a
congressional delegation on a $6 billion treasure hunt
yesterday inside Ft. Knox, one of the most in pregnable
fortresses ever built.
The party, led by Mint Director Mary Brooks, saw only s
fraction of the gold stored in the depository.
"Actually," said Brooks, "we have about $6.2
billion stored here and an audit will be made t!o determine
the exact amount."
She said this was the first time since April 1943 when
President Franklin D. Roosevelt inspected the depository
that any outsiders had been permitted to tour the two-story

concrete, granite and steel building.
The congressman, headed by Sen. Walter D. Huddleston,
(D-Ky.), were accompanied by approximately 100
newsmen and photographers. It was the first time pictures
had ever been permitted inside the depository since it was
built in 1936.
Auditor Questions Flournoy
SACRAMENTO — A state bank auditor said yesterday
that he's dissatisfied with Controller Houston Flournoy's
efforts to collect bank service charges that may have cost
the state millions.
"I think it's an area that could have been cleared up
earlier," Anthony L. Andreoli said in a telephone interview.
Andreoli is one of two auditors working for Flournoy's
office who are assigned to audit banks under the Unclaimed
Property Act. That act requires that dormant bank
accounts revert to the state after 15 years of nonuse.
Democrat Edmund G. Brown Jr. has accused
Flournoy, his Republican opponent for governor, of doing
little to recover service charges levied on these dormant
accounts.
Critics claim the charges often wipe out small accounts
and may have cost California $100 million over the past
eight years.
Banks say the charges are necessary because dormant
accounts must be kept separate to properly safeguard them.
Brown, the secretary of state, contends that a 1967
court decision gave the controller the authority to collect
much of the charges.
California Employment Remains Strong
SAN FRANCISCO — Employment in California has
remained strong despite the current economic slowdown, a
Wells Fargo Bank economist reported yesterday.
"Normally, during periods of economic slowdown,
employment cutbacks are widespread, resulting in a sharp
increase in unemployment," said Joseph A. Wahed, vice
president and senior economist for Wells Fargo.
"This just isn't happening now," he added. "Steady
employment levels are helping to keep the economy more
buoyant than expected. Job levels in California, as well as
in the U.S. as a whole, have remained firm so far this year,
with the average employment level around one percent
ahead of the preceding six months."
Stock Prices Fall After Early Rally
NEW YORK — Disappointment that no major bank has
yet lowered its prime lending rate ended an early morning
rally try and turned stock prices mixed yesterday.
With glamors and blue chips getting the worst of it, the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 7.04 to 663.72.
Many key interest rates have been taking a welcome
drop recently in response to signs that the Federal Reserve
is relaxing its credit reins somewhat.
In light of that, traders sent the Dow up about 4 points
in the opening hour on the hope the First National Bank of
Chicago might cut its prime lending rate below the
prevailing 12 percent level. The Chicago bank, however,
kept its prime unchanged, and the stock market languished
for the rest of the session.

Testifying at the opening of his confirmation hearings,
Rockefeller disclosed that over the past 10 years he has had
earnings totalling $46.8 million on which he paid federal,
state and local taxes totalling $21.7 million.
The 66-year-old former New York governor said that
over his lifetime he has paid $69 million in taxes. He said he
would not object if the committee publishes his tax returns

Most of the early questioning which followed
Rockefeller's reading of a 72-page statement centered on
his fortune and the pardoning of former President Richard
M. Nixon.
Ford, Kissinger Caution Oil Nations
DETROIT — President Ford and Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger told the Arab oil producing nations in
separate speeches yesterday that the world cannot and will
not stand exorbitant or rigged oil prices. The two U.S.
officials warned of global depression.
Ford, speaking at the opening session of the World
Energy Conference in Detroit, told an audience that
included Saudi Arabia's oil minister:
''Sovereign nations cannot allow their policies to be
dictated, or their fate decided, by artificial rigging and
distortion of world commodity markets. No one can foresee
the extent of the damage nor the end of the disastrous
consequences if nations refuse to share nature's gifts for the
benefit of all mankind."
The President urged global energy cooperation under a
program he called "Project Interdependence." He said
exorbitant oil prices can "threaten the breakdown of world
order and safety."
At the United Nations, Kissinger told the oil producing
nations that their artificially high prices and production
cutbacks could push the world over the brink into general
depression.
If the inflationary spiral is not restrained through a "new
understanding" between consumers and producers, the high
cost of petroleum could shatter the fragile international
economic system, dealing a staggering blow particularly to
the poorer countries, he said in an address to the 29th
session of the General Assembly.
Congressmen Tour Ft. Knox
FT. KNOX, Ky. — The Bureau of the Mint took a
congressional delegation on a $6 billion treasure hunt
yesterday inside Ft. Knox, one of the most in pregnable
fortresses ever built.
The party, led by Mint Director Mary Brooks, saw only s
fraction of the gold stored in the depository.
"Actually," said Brooks, "we have about $6.2
billion stored here and an audit will be made t!o determine
the exact amount."
She said this was the first time since April 1943 when
President Franklin D. Roosevelt inspected the depository
that any outsiders had been permitted to tour the two-story

concrete, granite and steel building.
The congressman, headed by Sen. Walter D. Huddleston,
(D-Ky.), were accompanied by approximately 100
newsmen and photographers. It was the first time pictures
had ever been permitted inside the depository since it was
built in 1936.
Auditor Questions Flournoy
SACRAMENTO — A state bank auditor said yesterday
that he's dissatisfied with Controller Houston Flournoy's
efforts to collect bank service charges that may have cost
the state millions.
"I think it's an area that could have been cleared up
earlier," Anthony L. Andreoli said in a telephone interview.
Andreoli is one of two auditors working for Flournoy's
office who are assigned to audit banks under the Unclaimed
Property Act. That act requires that dormant bank
accounts revert to the state after 15 years of nonuse.
Democrat Edmund G. Brown Jr. has accused
Flournoy, his Republican opponent for governor, of doing
little to recover service charges levied on these dormant
accounts.
Critics claim the charges often wipe out small accounts
and may have cost California $100 million over the past
eight years.
Banks say the charges are necessary because dormant
accounts must be kept separate to properly safeguard them.
Brown, the secretary of state, contends that a 1967
court decision gave the controller the authority to collect
much of the charges.
California Employment Remains Strong
SAN FRANCISCO — Employment in California has
remained strong despite the current economic slowdown, a
Wells Fargo Bank economist reported yesterday.
"Normally, during periods of economic slowdown,
employment cutbacks are widespread, resulting in a sharp

president and senior economist for Wells Fargo.
"This just isn't happening now," he added. "Steady
employment levels are helping to keep the economy more
buoyant than expected. Job levels in California, as well as
in the U.S. as a whole, have remained firm so far this year,
with the average employment level around one percent
ahead of the preceding six months."
Stock Prices Fall After Early Rally
NEW YORK — Disappointment that no major bank has
yet lowered its prime lending rate ended an early morning
rally try and turned stock prices mixed yesterday.
With glamors and blue chips getting the worst of it, the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 7.04 to 663.72.
Many key interest rates have been taking a welcome
drop recently in response to signs that the Federal Reserve
is relaxing its credit reins somewhat.
In light of that, traders sent the Dow up about 4 points
in the opening hour on the hope the First National Bank of
Chicago might cut its prime lending rate below the
prevailing 12 percent level. The Chicago bank, however,
kept its prime unchanged, and the stock market languished
for the rest of the session.

for the last 10 years.
Most of the early questioning which followed
Rockefeller's reading of a 72-page statement centered on
his fortune and the pardoning of former President Richard
M. Nixon.
Ford, Kissinger Caution Oil Nations
DETROIT — President Ford and Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger told the Arab oil producing nations in
separate speeches yesterday that the world cannot and will
not stand exorbitant or rigged oil prices. The two U.S.
officials warned of global depression.
Ford, speaking at the opening session of the World
Energy Conference in Detroit, told an audience that
included Saudi Arabia's oil minister:
''Sovereign nations cannot allow their policies to be
dictated, or their fate decided, by artificial rigging and
distortion of world commodity markets. No one can foresee
the extent of the damage nor the end of the disastrous
consequences if nations refuse to share nature's gifts for the
benefit of all mankind."
The President urged global energy cooperation under a
program he called "Project Interdependence." He said
exorbitant oil prices can "threaten the breakdown of world
order and safety."
At the United Nations, Kissinger told the oil producing
nations that their artificially high prices and production
cutbacks could push the world over the brink into general
depression.
If the inflationary spiral is not restrained through a "new
understanding" between consumers and producers, the high
cost of petroleum could shatter the fragile international
economic system, dealing a staggering blow particularly to
the poorer countries, he said in an address to the 29th
session of the General Assembly.
Congressmen Tour Ft. Knox
FT. KNOX, Ky. — The Bureau of the Mint took a
congressional delegation on a $6 billion treasure hunt
yesterday inside Ft. Knox, one of the most in pregnable
fortresses ever built.
The party, led by Mint Director Mary Brooks, saw only s
fraction of the gold stored in the depository.
"Actually," said Brooks, "we have about $6.2
billion stored here and an audit will be made t!o determine
the exact amount."
She said this was the first time since April 1943 when
President Franklin D. Roosevelt inspected the depository
that any outsiders had been permitted to tour the two-story

concrete, granite and steel building.
The congressman, headed by Sen. Walter D. Huddleston,
(D-Ky.), were accompanied by approximately 100
newsmen and photographers. It was the first time pictures
had ever been permitted inside the depository since it was
built in 1936.
Auditor Questions Flournoy
SACRAMENTO — A state bank auditor said yesterday
that he's dissatisfied with Controller Houston Flournoy's
efforts to collect bank service charges that may have cost
the state millions.
"I think it's an area that could have been cleared up
earlier," Anthony L. Andreoli said in a telephone interview.
Andreoli is one of two auditors working for Flournoy's
office who are assigned to audit banks under the Unclaimed
Property Act. That act requires that dormant bank
accounts revert to the state after 15 years of nonuse.
Democrat Edmund G. Brown Jr. has accused
Flournoy, his Republican opponent for governor, of doing
little to recover service charges levied on these dormant
accounts.
Critics claim the charges often wipe out small accounts
and may have cost California $100 million over the past
eight years.
Banks say the charges are necessary because dormant
accounts must be kept separate to properly safeguard them.
Brown, the secretary of state, contends that a 1967
court decision gave the controller the authority to collect
much of the charges.
California Employment Remains Strong
SAN FRANCISCO — Employment in California has
remained strong despite the current economic slowdown, a
Wells Fargo Bank economist reported yesterday.
"Normally, during periods of economic slowdown,
employment cutbacks are widespread, resulting in a sharp
increase in unemployment," said Joseph A. Wahed, vice
president and senior economist for Wells Fargo.
"This just isn't happening now," he added. "Steady
employment levels are helping to keep the economy more
buoyant than expected. Job levels in California, as well as
in the U.S. as a whole, have remained firm so far this year,
with the average employment level around one percent
ahead of the preceding six months."
Stock Prices Fall After Early Rally
NEW YORK — Disappointment that no major bank has
yet lowered its prime lending rate ended an early morning
rally try and turned stock prices mixed yesterday.
With glamors and blue chips getting the worst of it, the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 7.04 to 663.72.
Many key interest rates have been taking a welcome
drop recently in response to signs that the Federal Reserve
is relaxing its credit reins somewhat.
In light of that, traders sent the Dow up about 4 points
in the opening hour on the hope the First National Bank of
Chicago might cut its prime lending rate below the
prevailing 12 percent level. The Chicago bank, however,
kept its prime unchanged, and the stock market languished
for the rest of the session.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but coastal overcast and
fog extending inland this morning. Warming trend. Low

the upper 60s and 70s near the coast and the 80s inland.
Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph this afternoon otherwise light
winds.
Rockefeller Denies Conflict Of ® n t ere8 t
WASHINGTON — Nelson A. Rockefeller told Congress
yesterday that the concept his family can control the
nation's economy through a vast, interlocking financial
empire is a myth.
He assured members of the Senate Rules and
Administration Committee that his own substantial and
diversified fortune will pose no conflict of interest should
he be confirmed to be vice president.
"If I had spent a lifetime of abusing economic power, I
assume I wouldn't be sitting here today," Rockefeller said.
He said also he cannot rule out the possibility he may
seek the presidency in 1976 should President P'ord choose
not to run.
Testifying at the opening of his confirmation hearings,
Rockefeller disclosed that over the past 10 years he has had
earnings totalling $46.8 million on which he paid federal,
state and local taxes totalling $21.7 million.
The 66-year-old former New York governor said that
over his lifetime he has paid $69 million in taxes. He said he
would not object if the committee publishes his tax returns
