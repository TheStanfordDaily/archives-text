# Nixon Rests In Hospital; Doctor Reports 'Fatigue'
## 
### 
LONG BEACH, (AP) - Former
President Richard M. Nixon, looking
drawn and avoiding questions from
newsmen, checked into a hospital here
yesterday and later was described as
"at times low in his frame of mind"
and suffering from fatigue as well as
phlebitis.
Nixon was expected to stay in the
hospital for at least a week,
"undergoing extensive tests and
treatment," Nixon's physician, Dr.
John C. Lungren, told a news
conference.
Ronald Ziegler, former White
House press secretary, said, "The
phlebitis and the events of the last 45
days have caused him to not be in
good spirits. His mind, though, is very
acute."
Lungren told a news conference
that he had examined Nixon upon his
arrival at the hospital and found
"evidence of physical fatigue." The
doctor said he would advise use of
anticoagulant drugs in treating the
phlebitis, an inflammation of the vein

which has caused two painful clots in
Nixon's left thigh.
Lungren said he also ordered
"exhaustive studies to find the
causative agent of the illness."
Asked if Nixon might receive any
psychiatric treatment, Ziegler, now
Nixon's closest aide, said no but
added, "He feels as anyone would feel
after experiencing a great and severe
loss. His discussions with me have
sometimes been reflective and
sometimes directed toward the
future."
Asked about speculation that
Nixon might be entering the hospital
to avoid complying with defense and
prosecution subpoenas to testify at the
Watergate cover-up trial, Ziegler
replied: "The reason he is here is only
for the reasons stated by Dr.
Lungren."
Accompanied by his wife, Pat, and
his youngest daughter, Julie Nixon
Eisenhower, Nixon walked through a
back exit into Memorial Hospital
Medical Center of Long Beach.
