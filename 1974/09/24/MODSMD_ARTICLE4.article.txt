# All-Male Fraternity Privileges Under Fire
## Committee Probes Draw Exemptions 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The privileges which exempt
all-male fraternities from eviction by
the housing draw and which enable
them to subjectively select future
residents are undergoing careful
scrutiny by a housing committee
headed by Assoc. Dean for Student
Affairs Larry Horton.
The committee must either extend
these privileges to other living groups
or withdraw them from the fraternities
to avoid discrimination against women
who currently do not have an
on-campus housing exemption from
the spring draw.
The discriminatory status first
became an issue last winter, when
students from Alpha Sigma Phi House,

a coeducational fraternity within the
draw, requested exemption from the
draw.
Their proposal was rejected after
much discussion by the Committee on
Student Services only because the
issues it raised were too complex to be
dealt with in a short time, Horton
said.
Alternative System
The housing committee met during
the summer in order to develop
options to the present system. Horton
requested that committee members
compose and submit an alternative
system, dividing the various houses
into categories and assigning privileges
where warranted.
Of the various proposals submitted,

the most recent, worked out by David
Salego, appeared to have the widest
support.
Under Salego's system, no students
would receive exemption from the
spring draw. However, every house
that qualifies as a "theme" house, with
characteristics to be determined later,
could submit a priority list for filling
spaces. Such a priority would
outweigh current residence priority.
If such a systen. were implemented,
every undergraduate would participate
in the draw and would need to choose
a number below the cut-off point in
order to be placed on campus.
In essence, the proposal extends the
privilege of selecting future members
to all residences which have a theme,

but withdraws the privilege of
exemption from the draw from
all-male fraternities.
The principal issue during most of
the discussion has been the
draw-exemption privilege. Proposals
that would extend that privilege to
other living groups have been frowned
upon by the committee.
Problems Of Exemption
Such systems would decrease the
number of spaces available in the
housing draw, and could increase the
percentage of students within the draw
who would be evicted from the
system. The committee has also had a
problem agreeing on which houses a
draw exemption privilege should
cover.
Horton has pointed out that a set
of objective criteria should be used so
that each house currently in the
residence system could be placed in a
category according to that specific
house's characteristics.
Among the distinguishing factors
considered by the committee are:
whether a house is a dormitory or a
small-group house; whether it is
affiliated with a national organization
or has no such ties; and whether it is a
single-sex house or coed. All such
distinctions were found to be
unsatisfactory.
Horton has indicated that a
decision must be reached by the end
of autumn quarter if the new system is
to be implemented during this spring's
housing draw.
