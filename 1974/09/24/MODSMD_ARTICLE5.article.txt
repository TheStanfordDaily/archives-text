# Kennedy Will Not Seek Presidential Nomination
## 
### 
BOSTON (AP) - Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, (D-Mass.), announced
yesterday he would not seek the
presidency or vice presidency in 1976,
saying that family responsibilities
prevented him from running.
"I will not accept the nomination,"
said Kennedy. "I will not accept a
draft. My primary responsibilities are
at home."
Kennedy was often cited as the
leading Democratic prospect for 1976,
and several other potential candidates
said his withdrawal threw the race
wide open.
The Massachusetts Democrat said
he had learned from his brothers John
and Robert that a presidential
campaign "demands a candidate's
undivided attention and his deepest
personal commitment."
Mother Relieved
He said at a Boston news

conference that he could not make the
full commitment necessary for a
presidential campaign. "1 simply
cannot do that to my wife, children
and other members of my family," he
said.
"My mother was extremely
relieved," he added.
Kennedy also announced he would

seek re-election to the Senate in 1976.
Kennedy, 42, said the 1969
accident at Chappaquiddick Island was
not a factor in his decision not to run,
although he conceded the issue would
have been raised if he sought the
presidency.
Kopechne Incident
Mary Jo Kopechne, a secretary who
worked for Robert Kennedy, drowned

when a car driven by Edward Kennedy
ran off a bridge on Chappaquiddiek
Island off Cape Cod. Her death went
unreported for several hours.
In response to questions about
Chappaquiddiek, Kennedy said: "This
decision ... would have been made
irrespective of the tragedy that
happened in 1969." But he added:
"Were I to run it would have been a
factor that would have been raised."
The senator said he had answered
questions about Chappaquiddiek
"quickly, candidly and honestly" in
the courts. "I can live with my own
testimony," he said.
Wife At His Side
Kennedy's wife Joan, who was at
his side during the news conference,
has been in rest homes twice in recent
months. His son, Edward Jr., lost part
of a leg last November because of bone
cancer.
Edward Kennedy is the last
surviving Kennedy brother. His
brother John was assassinated in 1963
during his third year as President.
Almost five years later, his brother
Robert was assassinated while seeking
the Democratic presidential
nomination.
Another Kennedy brother, Joseph,
was killed during World War 11.
And the fact that both John F.
Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy were
ultimately assassinated has raised the
fear among many that the senator
himself would inevitably at some point
be the target of a madman wanting to
eliminate the last Kennedy brother.
Kennedy said his decision not to
run was "firm, final and
unconditional. There is absolutely no
circumstance or event that will alter
the decision."
Exposure For Others
Kennedy said that his withdrawal
"will permit others who have been
interested in gaining the nomination
the chance for exposure during this
campaign."
Some Democratic presidential
hopefuls said they would step up their
planning efforts for a White House
race.
President Ford had little to say
when he was told of Kennedy's
decision not to run. When a reporter
asked his reaction, the President shook
his head, said nothing and grinned
broadly.
Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley,
with tears in his eyes, said he regretted
the decision because Kennedy would
have been "a great candidate and a
great president."
Sen. Barry M. Goldwater (R-Ariz.)
said Kennedy "just realized he
couldn't win, and not only that, that
he couldn't even get the nomination."
