# Students Find New Tresidder Distasteful
## 
### CECILE HEROLD 
Returning students have discovered a changed Tresidder food service.
Hot entree choices have been replaced by hamburger, hot dog, and
cheeseburger fare, disguised with Ph.D., Bachelor's, and Master's Degree
titles, then prepackaged and kept warm under hot lights. The changeover
to a fast food format has inspired a new student movement—to the Coffee
House.
Even at the dinner hour, Tresidder clientele was sparse.
Junior David Dinter, one of the few diners, lamented, "The food here
last year was much too expensive and of poor quality. Now the food is still
too expensive and of even poorer quality. I can easily see how they'll make
more money." With that, Dinter looked at his meek and embarrassed
hamburger hiding in its bun and added, "I can buy a hamburger one and a
half times this size off-campus for 10 cents less."
Kathy Legrand, a graduate student, said "I ate at Tresidder last year
about three times a week. I studied late and lived off-campus so it was a
matter of necessity. Toward the end of the year all I could afford was a
bowl of chili, so I appreciate the lower prices now, but I wish there was
more food variety."
But she added, "Actually I'm the only person I know who can stand
Tresidder. The atmosphere is very depressing."
Graduate student Andy Klapper griped, "It's lousy. There is nothing
pleasant about sitting here. Tresidder has become a big vending machine.
Look at this huge room—l feel like a speck because it's so empty. I'm used
to a much more human kind of place in a student union restaurant. And
there should be more flexibility in the food served. Where's the ice
cream?"
Not all comments were negative, however. "I think the food is pretty
good for Mac Donald's style food," junior Bob Schuur said. "The
hamburgers are as good as the ones off campus."
One graduate student, who wished to remain anonymous, discussed the
employment situation. "I thought the people who used to work here were
very nice and 1 enjoyed contact with them. It's too bad they lost their
jobs, and they're bound to have trouble finding new jobs. I live off campus
and used to eat breakfast here sometimes. But now I prefer the Coffee
House."
Comparing the new set-up with that of the University of California at
Berkeley, the student added "Actually, when I came back to this it was
really upsetting. At Berkeley there is a totally different set-up. The three
cafeterias serve different types of food at different hours, an arrangement
which seems more practical and efficient. And I never heard of any
extreme financial losses."
But some students seemed resigned to their fate. "I live off campus and
don't have much choice about where 1 eat when I get busy here," said
graduate student Richard Levine. "Now 1 don't have much choice about
what I eat either. I think they need a grill to make the hamburgers instead
of pre-wrapping them. A smorgasbord would be ideal," he concluded.

WORTHWHILE CHANGE?—Tresidder's change to a fast food operation has met
with criticism from students who eat there. This 30-cent cup of Sprite may help
a student diner wash down a "Ph.D." hamburger.

House.
Even at the dinner hour, Tresidder clientele was sparse.
Junior David Dinter, one of the few diners, lamented, "The food here
last year was much too expensive and of poor quality. Now the food is still
too expensive and of even poorer quality. I can easily see how they'll make
more money." With that, Dinter looked at his meek and embarrassed
hamburger hiding in its bun and added, "I can buy a hamburger one and a
half times this size off-campus for 10 cents less."
Kathy Legrand, a graduate student, said "I ate at Tresidder last year
about three times a week. I studied late and lived off-campus so it was a
matter of necessity. Toward the end of the year all I could afford was a
bowl of chili, so I appreciate the lower prices now, but I wish there was
more food variety."
But she added, "Actually I'm the only person I know who can stand
Tresidder. The atmosphere is very depressing."
Graduate student Andy Klapper griped, "It's lousy. There is nothing
pleasant about sitting here. Tresidder has become a big vending machine.
Look at this huge room—l feel like a speck because it's so empty. I'm used
to a much more human kind of place in a student union restaurant. And
there should be more flexibility in the food served. Where's the ice
cream?"
Not all comments were negative, however. "I think the food is pretty
good for Mac Donald's style food," junior Bob Schuur said. "The
hamburgers are as good as the ones off campus."
One graduate student, who wished to remain anonymous, discussed the
employment situation. "I thought the people who used to work here were
very nice and 1 enjoyed contact with them. It's too bad they lost their
jobs, and they're bound to have trouble finding new jobs. I live off campus
and used to eat breakfast here sometimes. But now I prefer the Coffee
House."
Comparing the new set-up with that of the University of California at
Berkeley, the student added "Actually, when I came back to this it was
really upsetting. At Berkeley there is a totally different set-up. The three
cafeterias serve different types of food at different hours, an arrangement
which seems more practical and efficient. And I never heard of any
extreme financial losses."
But some students seemed resigned to their fate. "I live off campus and
don't have much choice about where 1 eat when I get busy here," said
graduate student Richard Levine. "Now 1 don't have much choice about
what I eat either. I think they need a grill to make the hamburgers instead
of pre-wrapping them. A smorgasbord would be ideal," he concluded.

WORTHWHILE CHANGE?—Tresidder's change to a fast food operation has met
with criticism from students who eat there. This 30-cent cup of Sprite may help
a student diner wash down a "Ph.D." hamburger.
Returning students have discovered a changed Tresidder food service.
Hot entree choices have been replaced by hamburger, hot dog, and
cheeseburger fare, disguised with Ph.D., Bachelor's, and Master's Degree
titles, then prepackaged and kept warm under hot lights. The changeover
to a fast food format has inspired a new student movement—to the Coffee
House.
