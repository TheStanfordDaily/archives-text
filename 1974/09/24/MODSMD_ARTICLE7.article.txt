# Amnesty Boon?
## 
### 
Glenn Kramon

President Ford's offer of
conditional amnesty to draft
evaders and military deserters has
been criticized for its compulsory
alternate service, for the unequal
"sentences" it might impose, and
for its injustice in view of the
unconditional amnesty granted
former President Nixon.
But for children of some 900
soci o-economically
underprivileged families served by
Friends Outside, a San Jose-based
organization which aids families
of those in local jails, a two-year
alternative service requirement
could be a good thing.
Friends Outside is one of many
volunteer organizations whose
programs were valuably expanded
by court-ordained conscientious
objectors (CCOs) fulfilling their
alternative service requirement.
Now that most of these two-year
hitches have expired, these
organizations have suffered a
demoralizing attrition.
Resisters Boost Programs
Military resisters fulfilling their
"earned re-entry" requirements
could provide an encouraging, if
temporary, boost to such
programs. At Friends Outside,
conscientious objectors last year
occupied three of seven full-time
salaried positions as well as three
part-time unpaid jobs.
As each of these alternative
service terms ends, the
organization must increasingly
rely on volunteers who, unlike
those doing alternative service, are
not obligated to spend time there
and may not be as dependable.
Therefore, a regression to the
smaller, less effective youth
program which existed before the
first CO joined seems likely,
particularly because now, money
is tight. With donations harder to
come by, the value of heretofore
inexpensive labor (provided by
those doing alternative service)

increases.
At Friends Outside, the
military resisters could run field
trips, weekend camping outings,
and back-packing trips for
economically deprived junior and
senior high school students, most
of them chicanos. They might also
help run the day camps, and
supervise a resident camp in
Northern California for a week in
the summer. Moreover, they could
help recruit college students to
tutor children in their homes.
Screening Necessary
However, not all war resisters
may be fit for employment at
such organizations. Applications
and interviews should be required.
Friends Outside Director
Margaret Muirhead emphasizes the
danger of not screening
candidates: "Friends Outside is by
no means for everybody. Most
responsibilities are left up to you.
What you do, you do because you
want to do it. Some like to be
told how and when to do their
work. Some just don't like 'poor,
dirty people.' These types are not
right for the organization."
Conflict Possible
Furthermore, the
often-conservative views held by
many underprivileged families
might conflict with the usually
far-to-left stance of military
resisters with whom they will
deal; many parents believe that
everyone should serve his country
in battle, and thus consider the
military resisters working with
their children a bad influence. It
takes a strong personality to
overcome such distrust.
But ideally, enough war
resisters will fulfill their
alternative service requirements to
successfully benefit programs like
Friends Outside, and to shoW
some positive results for President
Ford's controversial offer.

everyone should serve his country
in battle, and thus consider the
military resisters working with
their children a bad influence. It

overcome such distrust.

Friends Outside, and to shoW
some positive results for President
Ford's controversial offer.

President Ford's offer of
conditional amnesty to draft
evaders and military deserters has
been criticized for its compulsory
alternate service, for the unequal
"sentences" it might impose, and
for its injustice in view of the
unconditional amnesty granted
former President Nixon.
But for children of some 900
soci o-economically
underprivileged families served by
Friends Outside, a San Jose-based
organization which aids families
of those in local jails, a two-year
alternative service requirement
could be a good thing.
Friends Outside is one of many
volunteer organizations whose
programs were valuably expanded
by court-ordained conscientious
objectors (CCOs) fulfilling their
alternative service requirement.
Now that most of these two-year
hitches have expired, these
organizations have suffered a
demoralizing attrition.
Resisters Boost Programs
Military resisters fulfilling their
"earned re-entry" requirements
could provide an encouraging, if
temporary, boost to such
programs. At Friends Outside,
conscientious objectors last year
occupied three of seven full-time
salaried positions as well as three
part-time unpaid jobs.
As each of these alternative
service terms ends, the
organization must increasingly
rely on volunteers who, unlike
those doing alternative service, are
not obligated to spend time there
and may not be as dependable.
Therefore, a regression to the
smaller, less effective youth
program which existed before the
first CO joined seems likely,
particularly because now, money
is tight. With donations harder to
come by, the value of heretofore
inexpensive labor (provided by
those doing alternative service)

increases.
At Friends Outside, the
military resisters could run field
trips, weekend camping outings,
and back-packing trips for
economically deprived junior and
senior high school students, most
of them chicanos. They might also
help run the day camps, and
supervise a resident camp in
Northern California for a week in
the summer. Moreover, they could
help recruit college students to
tutor children in their homes.
Screening Necessary
However, not all war resisters
may be fit for employment at
such organizations. Applications
and interviews should be required.
Friends Outside Director
Margaret Muirhead emphasizes the
danger of not screening
candidates: "Friends Outside is by
no means for everybody. Most
responsibilities are left up to you.
What you do, you do because you
want to do it. Some like to be
told how and when to do their
work. Some just don't like 'poor,
dirty people.' These types are not
right for the organization."
Conflict Possible
Furthermore, the
often-conservative views held by
many underprivileged families
might conflict with the usually
far-to-left stance of military
resisters with whom they will
deal; many parents believe that
everyone should serve his country
in battle, and thus consider the
military resisters working with
their children a bad influence. It
takes a strong personality to
overcome such distrust.
