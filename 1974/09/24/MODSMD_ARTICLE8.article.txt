It seems that although students
make up the majority of almost
every educational institution, they
nevertheless are removed from the
decision-making process. That
task is usually left to
administrators, faculty and staff
members.
At Stanford, numerous
students serve on University
committees, but it remains
questionable how much input
they have. The Committe of 15
(C-15) has been unable to develop
a student judicial system, with a
majority of students, that is also
acceptable to the faculty and
administration.
But this summer there
appeared to be a breakthrough in
the Dean of Student Affairs'
office. Two housing committees
were formed to deal with
student-oriented issues: the
proposed new row houses and the
controversial "draw-exemption"
status privilege.
High Input Probable
While it remains to be seen
exactly how much input the
students will have on final
decisions, all indications are that
their opinions will be seriously
considered.
Members of the Row House
Committee are being asked to
study the students' desires and
needs concerning small-group
living. The purpose is to develop
guidelines for an architectural
designing otthe new houses.
This includes such things as the
amount of "common" space
desirable for casual conversation,
the best type of kitchen facilities
and the number of feet of books
an average student has (Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton's favorite example).
Students met throughout the
summer to discuss the matter,
ending with a two-day "live-in" at
Lathrop house, during which the
students toured numerous
small-group living houses and

continued their evaluation of
students' needs.
Two Years' Work Ahead
Horton, who formed and heads
the committee, has indicated that
it will continue to make decisions
until the houses are complete,
hopefully in September 1976.
The other committee, also
under Horton's guidance, has a
more complex task, but nyde
smooth progress during the
summer, and will continue
meeting until a detailed decision is
reached, probably before the end
of the quarter.
Horton has also met with all
fraternity members and
representatives of most
small-group living houses to
discuss this issue which could
withdraw the fraternities'
draw-exemption privilege. Horton
has continually solicited student
input on the matter and plans to
continue in this fashion.
Student Voice Growing
It appears that the concept of
giving students a larger voice in
the decision-making process is
catching on in other areas. Both
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons and Tresidder Union
Financial Manager Gordon Starr
have indicated that students will
be involved in plans regarding the
future of Tresidder.
Students' increased input is
definitely a sign of the times.
Members of the two housing
committees have thus far taken
their duties quite seriously, and
have developed an amicable
rapport with various
administrators also on the
committees.
Students are increasingly
getting the chance to help make
decisions that will affect
themselves and their peers. A
continuation of this will be
greatly valuable to the
University's future.
