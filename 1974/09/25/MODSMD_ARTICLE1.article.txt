# City Fathers Examine Stanford
## Palo Alto Civic Leaders Express Ambivalent Attitudes Toward University's Impact On City 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Although most Palo Alto civic leaders regard
Stanford's impact on the city as "highly
favorable," many also believe the University
should work harder to solve community
problems stemming from its presence, according
to a newly published survey.
The study, commissioned by Stanford and
conducted by former Palo Alto City
Councilwoman Sylvia I. Seman, included a
detailed list of recommendations regarding what
the University could do to improve relations
with Palo Alto and other local communities.
Of the 110 Palo Alto civic leaders queried in
the poll, 60 percent agreed that the University
exercises "a highly beneficial role" in Palo
Alto's development and 22 percent affirmed
that it has been "somewhat beneficial." Only
eight percent called Stanford's role "not
beneficial."
But 88 percent went on to assert that the

University bears major or partial responsibility
for the emergence of urban problems such as
housing shortages and traffic congestion in Palo
Alto. A mere four percent said "no
responsibility."
Andrew Doty, community relations director,
told the Daily yesterday that while he's
"delighted" that most survey respondents regard
Stanford as a positive force in the community,
he isn't surprised that many also regard it as a
source of problems.
"Yes, we have created problems, but we have
created the wherewithal to deal with those
problems," Doty said. "For example, Page Mill
Road is crowded for a few hours each morning,
but the [Stanford Industrial Park| firms along
the road provide $14 million in revenue each
year to the surrounding communities.
"A good deal of people are obsessed with the
problems created by the University rather than
with the benefits derived from it."

Although 86 percent of the civic leaders
surveyed said they understand the University to
be "somewhat or greatly in need of money,"
Doty claimed that most of them probably don't
realize that the University doesn't have the
funds to grapple with community problems on
an institutional basis.
Doty said the University continually
encourages individual faculty and students to
help with Palo Alto's urban problems. The
administration contends that such work is
educationally beneficial.
But the University must "think long and
hard" before spending money for community
projects, Doty explained.
Doty cited the University's current financial
inability to extend Campus Drive to Junipero
Serra Boulevard as an example of the
University's difficulty in acting upon projects
that have wide community support.
While praising Seman's recommendation for

the creation of an organization or academy to
find solutions to community problems, Doty
said that the University alone cannot now
finance such a project.
But Doty said that if such an organization
could be funded jointly by local firms, nearby
towns and Stanford it might be viable.
"We plan to look at all of the
recommendations very carefully," Doty said.
"We don't want to reject anything out of hand."
Other projects suggested by Seman and the
civic leaders polled include the introduction of
night classes for local residents, the admission of
part-time students and an extensive study of
urban transportation.
Doty said he hoped to implement some of
the suggestions.
For a starter, he's sending copies of Campus
Report and the Stanford Observer to Palo Alto
civic leaders. He also plans to send packets of


Andrew Doty
information to local libraries, and hopes to
schedule sessions in which University officials
discuss their plans with city leaders.
Doty noted that the recently created Palo
Alto-Stanford Liaison Committee has done
much to smooth relations between the two.
In addition to general opinion questions, the
16-question survey also asked civic leaders about
their attitudes toward University expansion.
While 70 percent said expansion of the
Stanford Hospital is important, only 15 percent
and 24 percent respectively felt expansion of
the Industrial Park and Linear Accelerator
facility is important.
Only 23 percent said the Stanford Shopping
Center is in need of expansion, but 73 percent
regarded construction of low-moderate income
housing as important.
While 24 percent favored annexation of the
Santa Clara County portion of Stanford to Palo
Alto, two in five favored annexing student
housing areas and three in five favored the
annexation of faculty housing.

discuss their plans with city leaders.
Doty noted that the recently created Palo
Alto-Stanford Liaison Committee has done
much to smooth relations between the two.
In addition to general opinion questions, the
16-question survey also asked civic leaders about
their attitudes toward University expansion.
While 70 percent said expansion of the
Stanford Hospital is important, only 15 percent
and 24 percent respectively felt expansion of
the Industrial Park and Linear Accelerator
facility is important.
Only 23 percent said the Stanford Shopping
Center is in need of expansion, but 73 percent
regarded construction of low-moderate income
housing as important.
While 24 percent favored annexation of the
Santa Clara County portion of Stanford to Palo
Alto, two in five favored annexing student
housing areas and three in five favored the
annexation of faculty housing.
Although most Palo Alto civic leaders regard
Stanford's impact on the city as "highly
favorable," many also believe the University
should work harder to solve community
problems stemming from its presence, according
to a newly published survey.
The study, commissioned by Stanford and
conducted by former Palo Alto City
Councilwoman Sylvia I. Seman, included a
detailed list of recommendations regarding what
the University could do to improve relations
with Palo Alto and other local communities.
Of the 110 Palo Alto civic leaders queried in
the poll, 60 percent agreed that the University
exercises "a highly beneficial role" in Palo
Alto's development and 22 percent affirmed
that it has been "somewhat beneficial." Only
eight percent called Stanford's role "not
beneficial."
But 88 percent went on to assert that the

University bears major or partial responsibility
for the emergence of urban problems such as
housing shortages and traffic congestion in Palo
Alto. A mere four percent said "no
responsibility."
Andrew Doty, community relations director,
told the Daily yesterday that while he's
"delighted" that most survey respondents regard
Stanford as a positive force in the community,
he isn't surprised that many also regard it as a
source of problems.
"Yes, we have created problems, but we have
created the wherewithal to deal with those
problems," Doty said. "For example, Page Mill
Road is crowded for a few hours each morning,
but the [Stanford Industrial Park| firms along
the road provide $14 million in revenue each
year to the surrounding communities.
"A good deal of people are obsessed with the
problems created by the University rather than
with the benefits derived from it."

Although 86 percent of the civic leaders
surveyed said they understand the University to
be "somewhat or greatly in need of money,"
Doty claimed that most of them probably don't
realize that the University doesn't have the
funds to grapple with community problems on
an institutional basis.
Doty said the University continually
encourages individual faculty and students to
help with Palo Alto's urban problems. The
administration contends that such work is
educationally beneficial.
But the University must "think long and
hard" before spending money for community
projects, Doty explained.
Doty cited the University's current financial
inability to extend Campus Drive to Junipero
Serra Boulevard as an example of the
University's difficulty in acting upon projects
that have wide community support.
While praising Seman's recommendation for

the creation of an organization or academy to
find solutions to community problems, Doty
said that the University alone cannot now
finance such a project.
But Doty said that if such an organization
could be funded jointly by local firms, nearby
towns and Stanford it might be viable.
"We plan to look at all of the
recommendations very carefully," Doty said.
"We don't want to reject anything out of hand."
Other projects suggested by Seman and the
civic leaders polled include the introduction of
night classes for local residents, the admission of
part-time students and an extensive study of
urban transportation.
Doty said he hoped to implement some of
the suggestions.
For a starter, he's sending copies of Campus
Report and the Stanford Observer to Palo Alto
civic leaders. He also plans to send packets of

information to local libraries, and hopes to
schedule sessions in which University officials
discuss their plans with city leaders.
