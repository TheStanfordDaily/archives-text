# McCloskey Seems A Sure Victor

Despite confident rhetoric emanating
from the "Gary Gillmor for Congress"
headquarters, the Santa Clara Mayor seems
highly unlikely to defeat Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr. (R—Menlo Park) in his bid for
a sixth term in the House of Representatives.
For a political maverick, McCloskey has
demonstrated remarkable talents for electoral
survival and the Gillmor challenge is mild
compared to some McCloskey has faced.
Liberal by California Republican
standards, McCloskey has won the last six
GOP primaries in the 12th District, which
includes Stanford. The fiercest challenge to
McCloskey's incumbency was posed this
spring by Atherton businessman J. Gordon
Knapp. Millionaire Knapp campaigned
tirelessly throughout the District for several
months, basing his realistic hopes for the
GOP nomination on the intense
anti-McCloskey sentiment among
conservative Republicans. But with the help
of a tacit endorsement from then Vice
President Ford and there registration of
Stanford students as Republicans, McCloskey
squeaked out a narrow 49-48 percent victory
in the June 4 primary.
Victory of Sorts
Last month, McCloskey experienced
another political victory of sorts when
President Nixon resigned. McCloskey, who
called for Nixon's impeachment as early as
1971, had long questioned his integrity and
ran against him in several 1972 presidential
primaries. Although McCloskey probably
took no joy in Nixon's downfall, the debacle
proved again McCloskey's remarkable
political prescience and staying power.
With this sort of record, McCloskey

should have little trouble surviving Gillmor's
challenge.
Even Gillmor's campaign strategists
privately admit that their candidate's chances
of upsetting McCloskey are tenuous. One of
Gillmor's leading campaign officials said last
Saturday that McCloskey will probably win
by a 55-45 margin, less than the 61-39
margin of victory he scored in 1972 against
James Stewart.
Gillmor's Problem
Gillmor's main problem is that as a liberal
Democrat, his political base vis a vis
McCloskey is extremely narrow. McCloskey
will overwhelmingly garner the liberal
Republican vote — about one-fourth of the
votes in the District. He will probably make
his customarily heavy inroads into
Democratic strength among voters who
admire his early opposition to the Vietnam
War and his national reputation. Although
conservatives in both parties have long
detested McCloskey, it is unlikely that they
will flock to Gillmor's liberal banner.
Gillmor strategists hope to pick up 10
percent of the Knapp vote and base their
chances of victory on the possibility of
convincing voters that McCloskey is not a
true liberal.
Wade Brummel, Gillmor's press secretary,
says he intends to emphasize McCloskey's
sometime opposition to the Equal Rights
Amendment and the volunteer army. He will
stress McCloskey's increasing support for
Administration policies.
Gillmor Financial Expert?
Gillmor strategists also hope to persuade
voters that while McCloskey's concentration
on foreign affairs doesn't qualify him to

grapple with inflation, Gillmor's nine years as
Santa Clara mayor have given him expertise
in fiscal matters.
McCloskey and Gillmor basically agree on
conditional amnesty for Vietnam draft
evaders, the need for national health
insurance, a balanced federal budget and
increased support for environmental
concerns, so these issues are unlikely to cause
much controversy in the course of the
campaign and discussion is likely to center
upon specifics.
In contrast, abortion may prove one of
the major issues, as McCloskey, a
Presbyterian, favors a liberal policy while
Gillmor, a lifelong Roman Catholic, approves
of abortion only in specific cases.
Campus Supports McCloskey
As for the Stanford campus, McCloskey is
expected to receive his usual overwhelming
support here. Although Gillmor strategists
hope to persuade students that McCloskey is
a conservative disguised as a liberal, they
concede that Stanford is the weakest
territory for Gillmor in the district.
Although Gillmor staffers tend to write
off the University as hopeless, Gillmor may
make some campaign appearances here and
he and McCloskey will hold one of their
eleven debates at Bishop Auditorium on Oct.
7.
Regardless of McCloskey's instinct for
political survival, a shrewdly conducted
Gillmor campaign could render McCloskey
vulnerable. The race may yet prove to be
highly interesting and surprising.
