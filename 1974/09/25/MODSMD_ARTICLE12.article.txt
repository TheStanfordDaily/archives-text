# Med School And Official Hypocrisy

Two important labor struggles
have taken place at Stanford this
year. In May, United Stanford
Employees (USE) went on strike.
In July, the members of
Committee For Recognition of
Nursing Achievements (CRONA)
staged a work stoppage at
Stanford University Hospital.
"Patient care" figured
importantly in both work
stoppages. Because hospital
workers are not part of the USE
bargaining unit, they were not
formally on strike. However, USE
members did strike against the
Medical School. Assuring the
administration that it would not
interfere with vital patient care
services at the Hospital, USE set
up an advisory committee to
screen shipments to the Medical
Center and to assist with
emergencies.
During the first days of the
USE strike, administrators
complained bitteriy that the
union was interfering with patient
care. Nevertheless, throughout the
USE strike, the Hospital
maintained its normal in-patient
census, surgical schedule, and
out-patient services. Despite its
public stance, the administration
ultimately could not document a
single instance in which the USE
strike compromised patient care.
In retrospect, it appears that
the administration used the
patient care issue as an emotional
publicity tool, designed to detract
attention from USE's legitimate
strike demands.
The administration's

hypocritical attitude about
patient care came to light during
the CRONA work stoppage. In its
hard-line negotiations with the
nurses, the administration simply
stopped all Hospital admissions
except those patients with
extreme emergency conditions.
As entire hospital wards closed
for nearly two weeks, many USE
workers wondered whether the
administration's response showed
a bias against certain workers. It
seemed that interfering with
patient care was a bad thing only
during a strike involving
nonprofessional workers. During a
nurse's work stoppage, on the
other hand, discontinuing patient
care altogether became a
legitimate response by the
administration to the nurses'
demands.
Throughout the USE strike,
Stanford administrators implied
that patient care at the Hospital is
a function of monumental
importance. If USE didn't let
some linen through its picket
lines, horrible consequences for
patient care might result.
No Catastrophes
Amazingly enough, the closing
of Stanford Hospital during the
nurse's work stoppage produced
no catastrophes in the health care
of California. Patients were
admitted or transferred to other
hospitals in the area without
incident. No known deaths or
medical complications could be
traced to the fact that Stanford
Hospital was not admitting new
patients.
In fact, it was startlingly clear

that patients' demand for
Stanford services in largely
controlled by Stanford physicians
and administrators. During the
nurses' work stoppage, physicians
could postpone elective
admissions and handle urgent
problems at other hospitals.
Stanford Hospital could
drastically reduce its services
during a labor struggle without
significantly hurting patient care.
The two work stoppages which
affected Stanford Medical Center
this year have demystified the
patient care issue. Workers,
faculty and students have
recognized that catastrophes are
unlikely from short-term
reductions in medical services
during labor disputes.
Nothing New
After all, hospital strikes are
nothing new. Unions in hospitals
have been gaining strength
throughout the country for many
years. Strikes have reduced
services temporarily at
innumerable hospitals, without
long-term damage to patient care.
The problems which confront
professional health workers
(interns, residents, nurses,
technicians, etc.) resemble in
many ways those of
non-professional workers. Material
benefits and control over the
work process are equally urgent
concerns for all workers regardless
of their positions in hospital
hierarchies. The artifical
differences among professional
and nonprofessional workers
which administrators encourage
mask the many similarities of

their interests.
Unionization of health
workers, in common with other
workers in the University, offers
the best hope for achieving the
power which guarantees individual
dignity in the workplace and truly
humane patient care.

Two important labor struggles
have taken place at Stanford this
year. In May, United Stanford
Employees (USE) went on strike.
In July, the members of
Committee For Recognition of
Nursing Achievements (CRONA)
staged a work stoppage at
Stanford University Hospital.
"Patient care" figured
importantly in both work
stoppages. Because hospital
workers are not part of the USE
bargaining unit, they were not
formally on strike. However, USE
members did strike against the
Medical School. Assuring the
administration that it would not
interfere with vital patient care
services at the Hospital, USE set
up an advisory committee to
screen shipments to the Medical
Center and to assist with
emergencies.
During the first days of the
USE strike, administrators
complained bitteriy that the
union was interfering with patient
care. Nevertheless, throughout the
USE strike, the Hospital
maintained its normal in-patient
census, surgical schedule, and
out-patient services. Despite its
public stance, the administration
ultimately could not document a
single instance in which the USE
strike compromised patient care.
In retrospect, it appears that
the administration used the
patient care issue as an emotional
publicity tool, designed to detract
attention from USE's legitimate
strike demands.
The administration's

hypocritical attitude about
patient care came to light during
the CRONA work stoppage. In its
hard-line negotiations with the
nurses, the administration simply
stopped all Hospital admissions
except those patients with
extreme emergency conditions.
As entire hospital wards closed
for nearly two weeks, many USE
workers wondered whether the
administration's response showed
a bias against certain workers. It
seemed that interfering with
patient care was a bad thing only
during a strike involving
nonprofessional workers. During a
nurse's work stoppage, on the
other hand, discontinuing patient
care altogether became a
legitimate response by the
administration to the nurses'
demands.
Throughout the USE strike,
Stanford administrators implied
that patient care at the Hospital is
a function of monumental
importance. If USE didn't let
some linen through its picket
lines, horrible consequences for
patient care might result.
No Catastrophes
Amazingly enough, the closing
of Stanford Hospital during the
nurse's work stoppage produced
no catastrophes in the health care
of California. Patients were
admitted or transferred to other
hospitals in the area without
incident. No known deaths or
medical complications could be
traced to the fact that Stanford
Hospital was not admitting new
patients.
In fact, it was startlingly clear

that patients' demand for
Stanford services in largely
controlled by Stanford physicians
and administrators. During the
nurses' work stoppage, physicians
could postpone elective
admissions and handle urgent
problems at other hospitals.
Stanford Hospital could
drastically reduce its services
during a labor struggle without
significantly hurting patient care.
The two work stoppages which
affected Stanford Medical Center
this year have demystified the
patient care issue. Workers,
faculty and students have
recognized that catastrophes are
unlikely from short-term
reductions in medical services
during labor disputes.
Nothing New
After all, hospital strikes are
nothing new. Unions in hospitals
have been gaining strength
throughout the country for many
years. Strikes have reduced
services temporarily at
innumerable hospitals, without
long-term damage to patient care.
The problems which confront
professional health workers
(interns, residents, nurses,
technicians, etc.) resemble in
many ways those of
non-professional workers. Material
benefits and control over the
work process are equally urgent
concerns for all workers regardless
of their positions in hospital
hierarchies. The artifical
differences among professional
and nonprofessional workers
which administrators encourage
mask the many similarities of

their interests.
Unionization of health
workers, in common with other
workers in the University, offers
the best hope for achieving the
power which guarantees individual
dignity in the workplace and truly
humane patient care.
