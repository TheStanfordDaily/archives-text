# Signs Of The Times

In recent years the University
has felt the need to hire many of
its graduates into University
positions. One administrative
department that recruits graduates
from all fields is the Stanford
Institute of Sign Technology
(SIST). SIST is funded and
assisted by all academic
departments on campus.
Since its conception in 1972,
the Sign Institute has grown to
such an extent that during last
summer it was necessary to move
a house and reroute Campus Drive
in order to accommodate what
one Stanford administrator refers
to as the "sign explosion."
University maps are even being
redrawn to fucus visitors'
attention on these visual
breakthroughs.
An old favorite is the Old
Union Building doorway which
displays two signs on each door of
its double-door entrances, Use
This Door on one door and Don't
Use This Door on the other. Most
students agree that only one sign
would suffice but the signs were
designed while SIST was
experiencing a clash of
philosophies.
According to a study funded
by the Mathematics Department,
by the time a person reads both
signs, chances are even that he has
already walked through the wrong
door. The Psychology Department
is assisting by experimenting with
color coded signs in order to
confuse rodents and small
children.
New Arrival
Most drivers have noticed a
new arrival on Campus Drive
encouraging cars to Stop For
Pedestrians. This is considered a
moral victory for theology
students but inside sources
indicate that a counterpart
sponsored by the Anatomy
Department will soon be placed
on campus reading Speed Up
When Pedestrian Is In Sight.
Although funded by the
government, the most
controversial and most researched
sign on campus is displayed on the
Post Office window: No Dogs
Allowed (Except Seeing Eye
Dogs). The controversy centers on
who should be expected to read
the sign, the dog or the blind
person. A debate is scheduled for
Oct. 28 in Memorial Auditorium
concerning this subject. Dr.
Benjamin Weaver, a renowned
professor of veterinarian science,
will speak on the superiority of
human mental processes and Dr.
Carl R. Garrard, a professor of
philosophy and evolution, will
side with the dog.
SIST has received funding
through 1978. Future plans of the
program include a new line of
Don 7 Stop signs, a new edition of
Don't Swim In The Toilet, and a
renewal of It Doesn't Help To
Honk If You're Horny. Andy
Bernard, the Director of Signs, is
optimistic about the expansion of
his projects. As he comments,
"Stanford is a great place to work.
Most of the students never
question what they read."
