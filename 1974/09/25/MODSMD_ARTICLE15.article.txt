## Evel Fans Terrorize Idaho At Snake River Jump 
### STEVE HEFTER 
TWIN FALLS, Ida. - Frank Batzer
hadn't pumped more gas in all his 20 years of
running the Mobil station at the edge of town.
The choppers and vans from Maine to San
Diego just kept coming in and talk about the
big jump could be heard through the snapping
off of beer can tops and the flow of apple
wine.
"Think he'll make it man?" one Vicelords'
motorcycle gangleader asked another.
"Hell no," began the reply. "Not on a
damn Harley."
Barroom Dream
Eight years earlier, Robert Craig "Evel"
Knievel had a few drinks at a Butte, Montana
bar and dreamt of a motorcycle jump to
surpass all others. Through the helping hands
of fellas like Bob Arum, the major domo of
promo, and Bob Truax, engineer of the
steam-powered sky-cycle, Knievel's dream

became a reality; a bit of Americana to chew
on for a while.
But it wasn't only the 1,600 foot wide
Snake River Canyon or its foreboding, craggy
walls which created the excitement of the
event. It was the influx of over 40,000 people
to a rather dubious place nestled in America's
great potato state.
They partied in Twin Falls that Saturday
night, and Idaho had never seen the likes of it
before. The whole town sang out to the tunes
from the piano bars and the roar of
motorcycle engines racing along the
traffic-congested main drag.
Motorcycle Types
The bars and saloons were filled to the
brim with both rational Eastern folk staying
at the Holiday Inn and motorcycle-gang types
drinkin' and yelpin' their way to satisfaction.
"Pass me the tall blonde," roared the
husky man from Texas, but they passed him
beer instead and poured it on him and
laughed.
The harmonicas played and a lady from
Boise sang out country music, and the
Wyoming cowboys danced anyway they could
with the local young ladies. They carried on
until tke beer ran dry.
Free Beer
Along the campsites surrounding the
canyon the Hell's Angels raided the
refreshment trailers and it was free beer for
all. They mounted their trusty pieces of
machinery and jumped the outhouses, later
burning them for night-lights.
The young security guards with
double-barreled shot guns and southern drawls
were as far gone as everyone else, so the booze
and cocaine got around and the hoopla never
ceased.
No one in Twin Falls slept Saturday night,
and Sunday was a long hot day of waiting.
"I'm cookin' man, just cookin' and lovin' it
up," were the words of the fella cramped
along the front-row fence. That was 9 a.m.

All morning the helicopters flew in the
ABC cameramen and the Steve McQueen-type
celebrities, stirring up dust and blowing it into
the crowd. The sweat poured from tired
bodies to the beer-drenched ground and at
$25 a head it was expensive perspiration.
At 2:30 p.m. the final helicopter brought
in Knievel himself, draped in a
red-white-and-blue jump suit, just like Old
Glory. The voice over the loud-speaker asked
everyone to "stay cool" but at 90 degrees it
wasn't easy.
People in the back were edging forward to
catch a better glimpse. The chants began:
"Rush the fence, rush the fence." The
loud-speaker voice again urged everyone to
"stay together." That they did.
Excitement
In the pre-jump excitement, pretty young
girls stripped to the waist and one performed
fellatio on a biker as the press and VlP's
looked on. UPI and AP photographers were
right on the scene and snapped more pics of
crowd anatomy than of Evel. The press was
even treated to their own naked female as the
crowd tossed one into the compound.
A little before 3 a.m. a priest came out to
wish Evel God's speed and was greeted by a
pants-down reception from the hikers below.
Then the "Ballad Of Evel Knievel" was sung
and it was all topped off by a high school
marching band equipped with drum
majorettes and pom-pon girls playing a soured
version of "The Star-Spangled Banner."
Finally Knievel was hoisted into this
13-foot piece of tin by the "Evel Knievel
Freedom Crane," a star-spangled chair
suspending Knievel high above the crowd in a
God-like display of immortality. The crowd
grew silent. And then....
"Shit man, he's fuckin' not gonna make
it."
Knievel and cycle disappeared, prompting
thousands upon thousands to rush forward

towards the canyon rim. The chain-linked
fences fell to the ground from the sheer
human force. Guards were overwhelmed by
the masses of bodies surging forwards from
every direction. As the helicopters hovered
below and the rescue boats searched the river
for Knievel, spectators began burning
concession stands and smashing television
equipment.
Minutes later Knievel was helicoptered
back to the launch site for a hero's welcome
by screaming females tearing at his clothes.
The Hell's Angel's didn't stay to greet him.
They were off jumping cars and racing
through the crowded field of pedestrians.

Only the simple hero worshippers stayed
long enough to see Knievel return to his trailer
where a $6 million check awaited him.
Knievel had failed, but his attempt would give
many something to talk about for a long time
to come.
Back at the Mobil station at the edge of
town, the returning spectators stopped for a
final beer. Without knowing it, they had been
the highlight of Evel Knievel's much-heralded
Snake River Canyon Jump.
After a week-end of partying and carryin'
on, the visitors went back home, Knievel went
back to counting his millions and Frank
Betzer went back to pumping gas.


THE MAN—Evel Knievel attired in
stars-and-stripes jumpsuit made his way
through crowds of motorcyclists and past a
group of shotgun-equipped guards on his way
toward the launch site of his ill-fated "sky
cycle."


THE MACHINE—The famed "sky-cycle" sits ready on its launch ramp at the rim of the Snake
River Canyon near Twin Falls, Idaho.
