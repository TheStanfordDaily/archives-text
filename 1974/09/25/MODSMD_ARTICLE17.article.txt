# City Council Again Opposes New Bridge
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council
Monday night reiterated its
long-standing opposition to a new
Dumbarton Bridge and
accompanying auto traffic in its
first stab at shaping the city's new
Comprehensive Plan.
The council adopted a
recommendation by a planning
that said "Dumbarton
Bridge auto capacity not be
increased, but that any increase in
capacity be limited to transit
only."
Also endorsed by the council
was a promise that "in the event
that the new Dumbarton Bridge is
authorized, Palo Alto will take all
feasible steps to modify or locate
approaches so as to generate the
least additional traffic in Palo
Alto."
Authorization of the bridge
construction would come from
the federal Department of
Transportation, but the city has
jurisdiction over approaches
within Palo Alto.
Agreeing with the planning
commission recommendations,
the council rejected an
assumption that "the new
Dumbarton Bridge approaches
will be built as proposed by the
state."
The votes were the first council
action on recent commission
recommendations for Palo Alto's
future. The council will consider
more of the recommendations at
its October 1 issue.
In 23 separate statements, the
commission recommended
limiting commercial and industrial
growth and discouraging increases
in auto traffic while encouraging
mass transit in the city.
