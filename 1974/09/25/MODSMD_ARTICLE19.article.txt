# Heart Patient Recovering After Second Transplant
## 
### 
Ralph Trout 111 is recovering satisfactorily from a weekend
operation at the Stanford Medical Center which gave him his
third heart.
Trout, the Center's longest-living heart transplant recipient,
was given his second transplant Sunday during a tour-hour
operation directed by noted heart surgeon Dr. Norman Shumway.
Surgeons said Trout, 38, was conscious and alert following his
latest surgery, but the total hospital recuperative period will last
six to eight weeks.
The 38-year-old Redwood City pizza parlor musician received
his first ransplanted heart five years and four months ago.
Trout is the second heart recipient in the Medical Center
history to recieve a second heart, according to Dr Jay Mason, one
of the surgeons who assisted Shumway.
A degeneration of the graft tissue of Trout's first transplant
developed into congestive heart disease. Doctors said the
development would likely have been fatal unless the organ was
replaced.
"Everybody at the hospital is hoping he'll make it," Mason
said. "He's taking it so well."
