# Construction: Not Quite On Schedule

Despite more delays in the
construction of Stanford's new Law
School building and its hospital
addition, officials are hopeful that the
latest scheduled completion dates will
be the last.
"We're looking at March or April
1975 for completion of the Law
School," said John Lerry, manager of
construction and engineering.
Construction was originally scheduled
for completion this fall.
He added that the delays, resulting
from "two labor strikes, the United
Stanford Employees (USE) strike and
an extremely bad period of weather,"
occurred during the first part of the
construction period.
Weather no longer poses a threat
"because the building is basically
enclosed. We're still completing some
roofwork," explained Lerry.
No Financial Impact
The delays have not had a financial
impact, according to Lerry, but they
have affected occupation of the
building.
Law School Dean Thomas Ehrlich
is "very optimistic about moving in
in June." He explained that the library
will be a major share of the move,
"plus faculty and staff. We will do that
right after commencement because we
can't move in during the middle of the
year. We hope to have commencement
at the new buildings."
