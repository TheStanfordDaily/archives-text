# Construction: Not Quite On Schedule

### CHRISTY WISE 
Despite more delays in the
construction of Stanford's new Law
School building and its hospital
addition, officials are hopeful that the
latest scheduled completion dates will
be the last.
"We're looking at March or April
1975 for completion of the Law
School," said John Lerry, manager of
construction and engineering.
Construction was originally scheduled
for completion this fall.
He added that the delays, resulting
from "two labor strikes, the United
Stanford Employees (USE) strike and
an extremely bad period of weather,"
occurred during the first part of the
construction period.
Weather no longer poses a threat
"because the building is basically
enclosed. We're still completing some
roofwork," explained Lerry.
No Financial Impact
The delays have not had a financial
impact, according to Lerry, but they
have affected occupation of the
building.
Law School Dean Thomas Ehrlich
is "very optimistic about moving in
in June." He explained that the library
will be a major share of the move,
"plus faculty and staff. We will do that
right after commencement because we
can't move in during the middle of the
year. We hope to have commencement
at the new buildings."
In addition to the strikes, hospital
construction has been hindered by a
new senate bill, which outlines
construction specifications to
minimize or eliminate earthquake
damage.
"We're pretty much on schedule
with the Stage 1 expansion project,"
said Deputy Director of the hospital
Paul Hofmann. "It should be
completed on or about November or
December 1975, within 30 to 60 days
of the original October date."
Catch Up-Phase
Stage 1, a catch-up phase, provides
support facilities for an earlier
addition of 158 beds. These facilities
include cardiology, laboratories,
radiology, surgical pathology,
anaethesia recovery and 25 new
intensive care beds.
Hofmann added that the strike
delayed the project in addition to
increasing the cost of the project. "But
the strike was not substantial in
comparison with the impact of the
Office of Architecture and
Construction," he said.
The office is a California state
agency responsible for reviewing and
approving construction of hospitals
and health care facilities to verify
minimal or nonexistant earthquake
hazard.
Hospital information officer Spyros
Andreopoulos explained that
construction started in June 1973. In
October, state agencies issued specific
earthquake safety regulations which
caused an initial delay of three
months.
"Then there were numerous delays
due to recognition of the regulations,
and then the strikes," said
Andreopoulos.
He said "inflation, the energy crisis
and strikes are almost nothing
compared to the rise in costs as a
result of earthquake requirements."
The cost increase totals approximately
$3 million as a result of the new state
law.
The Board of Trustees has approved
a revised budget of $12,600,000 for
the project. Even with the approval,
"The project has been scaled down
considerably," said Andreopoulos.

Catch Up-Phase
Stage 1, a catch-up phase, provides
support facilities for an earlier
addition of 158 beds. These facilities
include cardiology, laboratories,
radiology, surgical pathology,
anaethesia recovery and 25 new
intensive care beds.
Hofmann added that the strike
delayed the project in addition to
increasing the cost of the project. "But
the strike was not substantial in
comparison with the impact of the
Office of Architecture and
Construction," he said.
The office is a California state
agency responsible for reviewing and
approving construction of hospitals
and health care facilities to verify
minimal or nonexistant earthquake
hazard.
Hospital information officer Spyros
Andreopoulos explained that
construction started in June 1973. In
October, state agencies issued specific
earthquake safety regulations which
caused an initial delay of three
months.
"Then there were numerous delays
due to recognition of the regulations,
and then the strikes," said
Andreopoulos.
He said "inflation, the energy crisis
and strikes are almost nothing
compared to the rise in costs as a
result of earthquake requirements."
The cost increase totals approximately
$3 million as a result of the new state
law.
The Board of Trustees has approved
a revised budget of $12,600,000 for
the project. Even with the approval,
"The project has been scaled down
considerably," said Andreopoulos.
Despite more delays in the
construction of Stanford's new Law
School building and its hospital
addition, officials are hopeful that the
latest scheduled completion dates will
be the last.
"We're looking at March or April
1975 for completion of the Law
School," said John Lerry, manager of
construction and engineering.
Construction was originally scheduled
for completion this fall.
He added that the delays, resulting
from "two labor strikes, the United
Stanford Employees (USE) strike and
an extremely bad period of weather,"
occurred during the first part of the
construction period.
Weather no longer poses a threat
"because the building is basically
enclosed. We're still completing some
roofwork," explained Lerry.
No Financial Impact
The delays have not had a financial
impact, according to Lerry, but they
have affected occupation of the
building.
Law School Dean Thomas Ehrlich
is "very optimistic about moving in
in June." He explained that the library
will be a major share of the move,
"plus faculty and staff. We will do that
right after commencement because we
can't move in during the middle of the
year. We hope to have commencement
at the new buildings."
In addition to the strikes, hospital
construction has been hindered by a
new senate bill, which outlines
construction specifications to
minimize or eliminate earthquake
damage.
"We're pretty much on schedule
with the Stage 1 expansion project,"
said Deputy Director of the hospital
Paul Hofmann. "It should be
completed on or about November or
December 1975, within 30 to 60 days
of the original October date."
