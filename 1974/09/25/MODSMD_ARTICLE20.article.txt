## 
### University News Service 
The attitudes of defendants
toward criminal courts will bt
examined by a Stanford political
scientist under a grant from the
Department of Justice's Law
Enforcement Assistance
Administration.
Jonathan D. Casper, assistant
professor of political science,
specifically wants to know what
impact various types of
experience with criminal courts
have upon the attitudes of
defendants toward the law and
legal institutions.
The study will focus upon the
potential effects of various court
experiences upon the
rehabilitation of convicted
offenders.
The $218,000 study, which is
expected to take two years, will
be conducted in three major
American cities tentatively
chosen now at San Francisco,
Detroit and Baltimore.
In each city 200 men arrested

on felony charges will be
interviewed shortly after arrest
and then reinterviewed shortly
after the disposition of their cases.
In addition to the outcome of
the case Casper and his research
staff will ascertain whether the
defendant was found guilty by
trial, pleaded guilty outright or
bargained for a lesser charge. They
also will examine the effects of
the sentence and the type of
counsel representing the
defendant
i heir interviews with
defendants will focus upon the
views of fairness of the outcome,
evaluations of various
participants, and also sample for
attitudes sucn as alienation,
anomie, respect for the law,
socialization, prejudice/
ethnocentrism and political trust.
Controls will be introduced for
race, age, occupation, past
criminal record and pretrial
incarceration.
