# Kissinger Talk: A Pleading Tone

.Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger's address to the United
Nations was a remarkable
performance, a sort of diplomatic
cry from the wilderness whose
keynote seemed to be a plaintive:
"lb anyoody listening?"
The address had a pleading
tone seldom encountered in
pronouncement of this sort, a
tone of near-desperation with the
vast complexity and enormous
peril of the problems facing the
so-called advanced nations.
The delegates listened solemnly
- perhaps some of them even
sullenly — and there were no
interruptions for applause. It
wasn't the sort of speech that
stimulates applause because it
dealt with unpalatable facts.
The world, said the secretary,
has been dealing with local
conflicts "as if they were
perpetually manageable." Now
the Western world is awake to the
realization that the Middle East,
Cyprus, Southeast Asia and
Korea, and a procession of other
situations are not only perpetually
unmanageable but are subject at
any moment to sliding out of
control.
The world, said Kissinger, has
been dealing with nuclear
weapons "as if restraint were
automatic." Yet there has been no
real progress in braking the
strategic arms race, and whether
nuclear weapons remain under
control depends precariously on
unerringly correct readings of a
procession of crises, any of which
could start in motion an awesome
progression of events.
'Inexpiurable'
The world, said the secretary,
has dealt with the economy as if
"constant advance were
inexpiurable." But the economy

no longer responds to wishful
thinking in the industrial nations.
Inflation rages out of control and
major capitals seem helpless.
Nations not long ago
considered backward and even
poor are in the van of a
devastating assault on major
economies and the ultimate
results are beyond their
capabilities to predict. The
secretary warned them they could
push the entire world into a
depression of immense portions,
with vast damage to the very
"under-developed" nations they
have purported themselves to
champion. In the long run, the oil
producers now wallowing in
unaccustomed profits could badly
damage themselves and set in
motion revolutionary forces
against their antiquated systems.
The secretary echoed President
Ford's warnings about the
burgeoning crisis of world hunger.
It is likely to be aggravated in the
current economic disarray by
nourishing in the industrialized
nations an urge to take care of
themselves first. A new
isolationism is palpably growing,
for example, in the United States.
World Jitters
Day after day the news is
dismal and gets more so. One of
the situations close to the core of
world jitters is the Middle East,
not only because it contains the
seeds of East-West general
conflict, but also because it so
stubbornly defies solution. Thus it
continues to add to the
complexities and difficulties
assailing the economies of the
West.
One even hears talks of some
sort of Western or American
"intervention" in the oil
producing nations, indicative of
waning patience in the United
States and an urge for quick

solutions. But any such solution
seeking to put an end to the
agonies of uncertainty about
sources of energy would be likely
to signal the sort of global crisis
that would make matters far
worse.
The inescapable fact is that the
outlook on oil and the outlook in
general in the Middle East is
darker and more dispiriting than
statesmen care to concede.
No Concrete Action
There's much talk about
conferences and compromises but
nothing concrete is happening and
there actually is nothing on the
horizon to insure that new war
won't break out there. If it
should, what has gone on up to
now in the world's economies
would begin quickly to look like
the good old days.
If the secretary of state

sounded morose before the U.N.
General Assembly, it shouldn't b»>
surprising. The superpowers seem
powerless to control themselves.
Each is involved in sustaining
clients, each in making sure the
other side doesn't win any clear
advantage.
The result of all this is that the
process is self-nourishing. It seems
to demonstrate all too clearly that
in spite of all the fuss about
coexistence and detente, the
reality of the matter is that naked
military force still determines
what goes on in the world and in
relations between powerful
nations.
Unless Kissinger can think up
some way of getting round that,
he will continue to have ample
reason for the sort of tone he
exhibited in his U.N. address.

exhibited in his U.N. address.
AP News Analysis
.Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger's address to the United
Nations was a remarkable
performance, a sort of diplomatic
cry from the wilderness whose
keynote seemed to be a plaintive:
"lb anyoody listening?"
The address had a pleading
tone seldom encountered in
pronouncement of this sort, a
tone of near-desperation with the
vast complexity and enormous
peril of the problems facing the
so-called advanced nations.
The delegates listened solemnly
- perhaps some of them even
sullenly — and there were no
interruptions for applause. It
wasn't the sort of speech that
stimulates applause because it
dealt with unpalatable facts.
The world, said the secretary,
has been dealing with local
conflicts "as if they were
perpetually manageable." Now
the Western world is awake to the
realization that the Middle East,
Cyprus, Southeast Asia and
Korea, and a procession of other
situations are not only perpetually
unmanageable but are subject at
any moment to sliding out of
control.
The world, said Kissinger, has
been dealing with nuclear
weapons "as if restraint were
automatic." Yet there has been no
real progress in braking the
strategic arms race, and whether
nuclear weapons remain under
control depends precariously on
unerringly correct readings of a
procession of crises, any of which
could start in motion an awesome
progression of events.
'Inexpiurable'
The world, said the secretary,
has dealt with the economy as if
"constant advance were
inexpiurable." But the economy

no longer responds to wishful
thinking in the industrial nations.
Inflation rages out of control and
major capitals seem helpless.
Nations not long ago
considered backward and even
poor are in the van of a
devastating assault on major
economies and the ultimate
results are beyond their
capabilities to predict. The
secretary warned them they could
push the entire world into a
depression of immense portions,
with vast damage to the very
"under-developed" nations they
have purported themselves to
champion. In the long run, the oil
producers now wallowing in
unaccustomed profits could badly
damage themselves and set in
motion revolutionary forces
against their antiquated systems.
The secretary echoed President
Ford's warnings about the
burgeoning crisis of world hunger.
It is likely to be aggravated in the
current economic disarray by
nourishing in the industrialized
nations an urge to take care of
themselves first. A new
isolationism is palpably growing,
for example, in the United States.
World Jitters
Day after day the news is
dismal and gets more so. One of
the situations close to the core of
world jitters is the Middle East,
not only because it contains the
seeds of East-West general
conflict, but also because it so
stubbornly defies solution. Thus it
continues to add to the
complexities and difficulties
assailing the economies of the
West.
One even hears talks of some
sort of Western or American
"intervention" in the oil
producing nations, indicative of
waning patience in the United
States and an urge for quick

solutions. But any such solution
seeking to put an end to the
agonies of uncertainty about
sources of energy would be likely
to signal the sort of global crisis
that would make matters far
worse.
The inescapable fact is that the
outlook on oil and the outlook in
general in the Middle East is
darker and more dispiriting than
statesmen care to concede.
No Concrete Action
There's much talk about
conferences and compromises but
nothing concrete is happening and
there actually is nothing on the
horizon to insure that new war
won't break out there. If it
should, what has gone on up to
now in the world's economies
would begin quickly to look like
the good old days.
If the secretary of state

sounded morose before the U.N.
General Assembly, it shouldn't b»>
surprising. The superpowers seem
powerless to control themselves.
Each is involved in sustaining
clients, each in making sure the
other side doesn't win any clear
advantage.
The result of all this is that the
process is self-nourishing. It seems
to demonstrate all too clearly that
in spite of all the fuss about
coexistence and detente, the
reality of the matter is that naked
military force still determines
what goes on in the world and in
relations between powerful
nations.
Unless Kissinger can think up
some way of getting round that,
he will continue to have ample
reason for the sort of tone he
exhibited in his U.N. address.
