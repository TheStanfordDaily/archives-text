# Prof: Death Penalty Remains 'Discretionary, Prejudiced'
## 
### 
University News Service
Death rows are starting to fill
up again.
Since the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled against discretionary death
penalties in 1972, 26 states have
legislated mandatory sentences.
At present 140 persons have
been convicted and are awaiting
execution.
Over 60% are black. Most are
poor. Many are physically ugly.
And practically all are capable of
being viewed as social outcasts
by judges and juries, according to
Law Prof. Anthony Amsterdam,
who argued and won the historic
5-4 verdict against capital
punishment in the Furman case.
'Not Mandatory'
While the new legislation is
"mandatory in form, it's not
mandatory in fact," Amsterdam
contends. "The same people are
getting it in the neck in the end.
"I do not think we will in fact
see any changes in practices under
the mandatory system from those
that grew up in the discretionary
system.
"We have just as much
discretion, but it is less visible and
therefore more likely to be
arbitrary. It is spread throughout
the system and therefore less
likely to be exercised
responsibly."
'Utterly Discretionary'
Prosecutors still have discretion
in the charges they bring, grand
juries still have discretion in
deciding whether to indict, plea

bargaining between prosecuting
and defense attorneys remains
"utterly discretionary," and juries
can find defendants guilty of
lesser but included offenses if a
case goes to trial, he explains.
While California has a
mandatory' death sentence for
lifers who kill prison guards, he
notes, several San Quentin killings
have resulted in grand jury
indictments for first-degree
murder rather than the capital
offense.
And while a combined
robbery-murder likewise carries a
mandatory death sentence, a
highly publicized recent San
Francisco case resulted in a
conviction for murder alone when
the key evidence against the
accused was stolen from his
victim.
'Arbitrary At Core'
The death penalty is "not
being even-handedly applied—it's
arbirary at its core," Amsterdam
argues. "It is invidiously
discriminatory and prejudiced."
Contrary to popular opinion,
countless studies over the past 40
years have shown that the death
penalty has "no deterrence
value," he points out.
States which abolished capital
punishment before the Supreme
Court decision had no higher rate
of capital crimes than those which
retained the death penalty. States
which have restored capital
punishment have not seen any
drop in the rate of major crimes.

Restoration of the death
penalty has proven politically
popular because it appears to be a
"solution" to the "tremendously
pervasive fear of crime,"
Amsterdam notes. One Eastern
governor strongly urged
restoration of capital punishment
well before specifying any crime
for which it should be mandatory.
'Authoritarian Structure*
Support for the death penalty
reflects the "basically
authoritarian structure of
society," he adds. Just as gun
control laws have been defeated as
threats to individual manliness,
"so government that doesn't have
an electric chair at its disposal can
be viewed as weak."
Most citizens are willing to
accept the deterrence argument
"because it rings psychologically
true," Amsterdam told a freshman
group this weekend. But where
most people are afraid of death,
"murderers think differently than
we do."
On the other hand, he argued,
"mistakes can be made" not only
in executing innocent persons but
more commonly in the many
human judgments concerning
intent to kill, sanity, and othe;key
legal questions in the criminal
process leading to execution.
'Decency Of Justice'
"More is at stake than an
individual life," he adds. "What is
at stake is the decency of the
entire administration of criminal
justice.

"The ultimate lesson of capital
punishment is that human life
ceases to be sacred whenever there
is some pragmatic reason to take
it away.
"No lesson could be more
corrosive, more destructive of the
worth of human beings, more
likely to treat man as simply an
instrument and creature of the
state than is the notion that, in
order to discourage others, his life
may be taken."
The death penalty "denies
humanity and the possibility of
redemption," Amsterdam
maintains. "It reinforces our
native penchant for dealing with
social problems by violent,
unthinking responses.

system.
"We have just as much
discretion, but it is less visible and
therefore more likely to be
arbitrary. It is spread throughout
the system and therefore less
likely to be exercised
responsibly."
'Utterly Discretionary'
Prosecutors still have discretion
in the charges they bring, grand
juries still have discretion in
deciding whether to indict, plea

bargaining between prosecuting
and defense attorneys remains
"utterly discretionary," and juries
can find defendants guilty of
lesser but included offenses if a
case goes to trial, he explains.
While California has a
mandatory' death sentence for
lifers who kill prison guards, he
notes, several San Quentin killings
have resulted in grand jury
indictments for first-degree
murder rather than the capital
offense.
And while a combined
robbery-murder likewise carries a
mandatory death sentence, a
highly publicized recent San
Francisco case resulted in a
conviction for murder alone when
the key evidence against the
accused was stolen from his
victim.
'Arbitrary At Core'
The death penalty is "not
being even-handedly applied—it's
arbirary at its core," Amsterdam
argues. "It is invidiously
discriminatory and prejudiced."
Contrary to popular opinion,
countless studies over the past 40
years have shown that the death
penalty has "no deterrence
value," he points out.
States which abolished capital
punishment before the Supreme
Court decision had no higher rate
of capital crimes than those which
retained the death penalty. States
which have restored capital
punishment have not seen any
drop in the rate of major crimes.

Restoration of the death
penalty has proven politically
popular because it appears to be a
"solution" to the "tremendously
pervasive fear of crime,"
Amsterdam notes. One Eastern
governor strongly urged
restoration of capital punishment
well before specifying any crime
for which it should be mandatory.
'Authoritarian Structure*
Support for the death penalty
reflects the "basically
authoritarian structure of
society," he adds. Just as gun
control laws have been defeated as
threats to individual manliness,
"so government that doesn't have
an electric chair at its disposal can
be viewed as weak."
Most citizens are willing to
accept the deterrence argument
"because it rings psychologically
true," Amsterdam told a freshman
group this weekend. But where
most people are afraid of death,
"murderers think differently than
we do."
On the other hand, he argued,
"mistakes can be made" not only
in executing innocent persons but
more commonly in the many
human judgments concerning
intent to kill, sanity, and othe;key
legal questions in the criminal
process leading to execution.
'Decency Of Justice'
"More is at stake than an
individual life," he adds. "What is
at stake is the decency of the
entire administration of criminal
justice.

"The ultimate lesson of capital
punishment is that human life
ceases to be sacred whenever there
is some pragmatic reason to take
it away.
"No lesson could be more
corrosive, more destructive of the
worth of human beings, more
likely to treat man as simply an
instrument and creature of the
state than is the notion that, in
order to discourage others, his life
may be taken."
The death penalty "denies
humanity and the possibility of
redemption," Amsterdam
maintains. "It reinforces our
native penchant for dealing with
social problems by violent,
unthinking responses.

Death rows are starting to fill
up again.
Since the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled against discretionary death
penalties in 1972, 26 states have
legislated mandatory sentences.
At present 140 persons have
been convicted and are awaiting
execution.
Over 60% are black. Most are
poor. Many are physically ugly.
And practically all are capable of
being viewed as social outcasts
by judges and juries, according to
Law Prof. Anthony Amsterdam,
who argued and won the historic
5-4 verdict against capital
punishment in the Furman case.
'Not Mandatory'
While the new legislation is
"mandatory in form, it's not
mandatory in fact," Amsterdam
contends. "The same people are
getting it in the neck in the end.
"I do not think we will in fact
see any changes in practices under
the mandatory system from those
that grew up in the discretionary
