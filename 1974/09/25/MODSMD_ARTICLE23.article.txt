# Interdepartmental Program
## Nutrition Courses Planned 
### PETE BHATIA 
The Stanford Committee on
Human Nutrition is making
significant progress towards an
interdepartmental program on
nutrition, committee co-chairman
Keith B. Taylor said Monday.
Taylor said the committee,
appointed last June, had "done
quite a lot in the way of
coordinating courses and subjects
relating to nutrition for
undergraduates in the Food
Research Institute and the
Program in Human Biology." He
said the committee had already
produced a nutrition course in the
medical school.
Taylor, holder of the Burnett
professorship in medicine, stressed
that the committee is moving
towards an interdisciplinary
program among various
departments. He said the
committee will seek a
professorship in human nutrition
in the future.
Taylor said the committee was
designed originally to:
—Define the substance of a
long-run teaching and research
program in human nutrition;
—Serve as a University search
committee in the event the
appointment of a nutritional
scientist becomes financially
feasible;
—Assist with the promotion of
nutrition activities on campus,
inviting seminar speakers and
increasing communication among
members of the faculty who are
already engaged in teaching and
research related to human
nutrition.

In addition to these goals,
Taylor said the committe has
become an important source of
information for faculty interested
in the problems of nutrition.
"The announcement of the
formation of the committee has
stimulated a great deal of
interest," he said. "Many have
come to us for help."
He said the committee was able
to provide varied sources of

expertise and noted that many of
the committee's members were
asked to participate in the
formation of a proposed course
on this year's Saharan drought.
Numerous foreign study groups
have also come to the committee
for their expertise, Taylor said.
The reasoning behind the
formation of the committee and
the future interdepartmental
curriculum is largely to inform the
Stanford community of the
world's nutrition problems and to
seek viable solutions.
Steady Growth
Taylor and committee
co-chairman William 0. Jones, a
professor in the Food Research
Institute, in explaining the need
for a program said, "Since the
early years of World War 11,
concern over hunger due to
undernutrition in underdeveloped
countries and regions has grown
steadily. Billions of dollars have
been spent on programs designed

to increase food supplies and
increase their distribution.
"Plant breeders have achieved
notable success in increasing the
yields of major cereal crops, and
direct feeding programs have
helped to alleviate critical
shortages caused by war and
natural disaster.
"During the same time many
relatively affluent countries have
seen a steady and frightening rise
in death and disability among
relatively young people from
so-called premature
cardio vascular disease, much of
which has its roots in nutritional
causes.
"As nations emerge from
undernutrition, many appear
destined to suffer from excessive
intake of calories or the intake of
unhealthy, unbalanced diets.
Therefore, the paradox of
undernutrition and overnutrition,
of poverty and plenty, coexist
often within the same country.
Each of these forms of
malnutrition takes its toll of
preventable disease, disabiltiy and
early death."
The five-man committee,
which also includes Donald
Kennedy, professor of biology
and chairman of the program in
human biology; Walter P. Falcon,
director of the Food Research
Institute; and John R. Farquhar,
professor of medicine, will
continue meeting through the
academic year with the formation
of an undergraduate curriculum
its primary goal.

continue meeting through the
academic year with the formation
of an undergraduate curriculum
its primary goal.


Keith B. Taylor
The Stanford Committee on
Human Nutrition is making
significant progress towards an
interdepartmental program on
nutrition, committee co-chairman
Keith B. Taylor said Monday.
Taylor said the committee,
appointed last June, had "done
quite a lot in the way of
coordinating courses and subjects
relating to nutrition for
undergraduates in the Food
Research Institute and the
Program in Human Biology." He
said the committee had already
produced a nutrition course in the
medical school.
Taylor, holder of the Burnett
professorship in medicine, stressed
that the committee is moving
towards an interdisciplinary
program among various
departments. He said the
committee will seek a
professorship in human nutrition
in the future.
Taylor said the committee was
designed originally to:
—Define the substance of a
long-run teaching and research
program in human nutrition;
—Serve as a University search
committee in the event the
appointment of a nutritional
scientist becomes financially
feasible;
—Assist with the promotion of
nutrition activities on campus,
inviting seminar speakers and
increasing communication among
members of the faculty who are
already engaged in teaching and
research related to human
nutrition.

In addition to these goals,
Taylor said the committe has
become an important source of
information for faculty interested
in the problems of nutrition.
"The announcement of the
formation of the committee has
stimulated a great deal of
interest," he said. "Many have
come to us for help."
He said the committee was able
to provide varied sources of

expertise and noted that many of
the committee's members were
asked to participate in the
formation of a proposed course
on this year's Saharan drought.
Numerous foreign study groups
have also come to the committee
for their expertise, Taylor said.
The reasoning behind the
formation of the committee and
the future interdepartmental
curriculum is largely to inform the
Stanford community of the
world's nutrition problems and to
seek viable solutions.
Steady Growth
Taylor and committee
co-chairman William 0. Jones, a
professor in the Food Research
Institute, in explaining the need
for a program said, "Since the
early years of World War 11,
concern over hunger due to
undernutrition in underdeveloped
countries and regions has grown
steadily. Billions of dollars have
been spent on programs designed

to increase food supplies and
increase their distribution.
"Plant breeders have achieved
notable success in increasing the
yields of major cereal crops, and
direct feeding programs have
helped to alleviate critical
shortages caused by war and
natural disaster.
"During the same time many
relatively affluent countries have
seen a steady and frightening rise
in death and disability among
relatively young people from
so-called premature
cardio vascular disease, much of
which has its roots in nutritional
causes.
"As nations emerge from
undernutrition, many appear
destined to suffer from excessive
intake of calories or the intake of
unhealthy, unbalanced diets.
Therefore, the paradox of
undernutrition and overnutrition,
of poverty and plenty, coexist
often within the same country.
Each of these forms of
malnutrition takes its toll of
preventable disease, disabiltiy and
early death."
The five-man committee,
which also includes Donald
Kennedy, professor of biology
and chairman of the program in
human biology; Walter P. Falcon,
director of the Food Research
Institute; and John R. Farquhar,
professor of medicine, will
continue meeting through the
academic year with the formation
of an undergraduate curriculum
its primary goal.
