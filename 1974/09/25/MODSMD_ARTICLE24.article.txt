## 'Pool' Of New Talent Helps Card Water Polo Fortunes 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
"We are definitely going to be a team to
be reckoned with," said coach Art Lambert
after the Stanford varsity water polo team
made a complete turnabout after losing its
first three pre-season matches to even its
record at 3-3.
The first-year coach attributed this
comeback to the improved defense of the
players as the number of opponent goals
dropped steadily in the six scrimmages.
The Cardinals, who have been practicing
three weeks as opposed to months by other
college squads, opened their first scrimmage
of a rough road schedule on Sept. 19 with
what coach Lambert characterized as "sloppy
play." Stanford was consequently dumped
by UC-Santa Barbara by an 8-4 margin.
Traveling south the next day, Stanford
still couldn't get on the winning track as Cal
Poly-Pomona edged Stanford 8-7. From there
the Cardinals entered the UC-Irvine
Invitational. Stanford lost 8-7 to UC-Irvine,
which later was to reach the finals of the
tournament.
Following the opening match in the
invitational, the Cardinals regrouped to take
the consolation championship with a 7-4 win
over the USC Trojans and 6-3 triumphs over
Cal State-Fullerton and San Jose State.
Improvement Seen
With this emotional lift, Lambert looks to
a considerably better league record than the
0-6 marks posted by the Cardinals the past
two years.
"The league is definitely going to be
lough. Cal is going to be very strong as they
are the defending NCAA champions and have

their entire squad returning from last year.
UCLA will also be tough. These two teams
will be standing in our way for the Pacific
Eight Championship. In our case, we are a
team consisting mainly of freshmen,
sophomores and juniors and are considered
by many of our opponents to be in a
rebuilding year," he said.
Stanford's young team includes four
newcomers, who according to Lambert, "will
improve the Cardinals' chances significantly."
These are transfers Tom Elson and Frank
Forencich (a goalie) from DeAnza JC and
freshmen Rick Johanson from Santa Barbara
High School and Brian Avery from
Menfo-Atherton High School.
Ineligible Star
Despite this new blood, the Cardinals will

still be hurting offensively due to the loss of
Rick Gebers, who is inelligible due to
academic reasons. Last year, Gebers was the
leading scorer and provided most of
Stanford's offensive punch.
"The loss of Rich Gebers will definitely
hurt us as he was our leading scorer last year
and is a good college player," Lambert
remarked.
According to Lambert, sophomores Drew
McDonald and Paul Clark, who was named
player of the tournament at UC-Irvine, will
be looked upon for guidance in the team's
quest for the Pac-8 title.
The Cardinals meet Army here on
Saturday at 10 a.m. in a pre season match
and travel to USC to open their league season
on Oct. 11. According to Lambert, the
probably starters for Saturday's matchup are
Chris Dorst, Dean Anderson, Rick Johanson,
Craig VanZandt, Drew McDonald, and John
Paul Roberts with one spot undecided.
Psychological Edge
"We will definitely have the psychological
edge in that we have previously beaten the
Trojans in the pre season. However they are
tough, big, fast and strong and they can't be
taken lightly," Lambert emphasized.
According to Lambert, the young team's
performance so far is very pleasing.
"I am happy with the efforts and
enthusiasm put out by all the guys, but we
still have a lot of learning to do," he said.
And so, Stanford's varsity water polo
team looks to a winning season and possibly
a chance at capturing the Pacific Eight title
which has eluded the Cardinals since the
league's formation five years ago.

And so, Stanford's varsity water polo
team looks to a winning season and possibly

league's formation five years ago.

PROMISING START—Rick Johanson (36), a freshman from Santa Barbara High School, harries a
teammate at practice yesterday. Johanson's play is one reason why Art Lambert, the water polo team's
first-year coach, expects an improvement over last year's 0-6 Pac-8 record.
"We are definitely going to be a team to
be reckoned with," said coach Art Lambert
after the Stanford varsity water polo team
made a complete turnabout after losing its
first three pre-season matches to even its
record at 3-3.
The first-year coach attributed this
comeback to the improved defense of the
players as the number of opponent goals
dropped steadily in the six scrimmages.
The Cardinals, who have been practicing
three weeks as opposed to months by other
college squads, opened their first scrimmage
of a rough road schedule on Sept. 19 with
what coach Lambert characterized as "sloppy
play." Stanford was consequently dumped
by UC-Santa Barbara by an 8-4 margin.
Traveling south the next day, Stanford
still couldn't get on the winning track as Cal
Poly-Pomona edged Stanford 8-7. From there
the Cardinals entered the UC-Irvine
Invitational. Stanford lost 8-7 to UC-Irvine,
which later was to reach the finals of the
tournament.
Following the opening match in the
invitational, the Cardinals regrouped to take
the consolation championship with a 7-4 win
over the USC Trojans and 6-3 triumphs over
Cal State-Fullerton and San Jose State.
Improvement Seen
With this emotional lift, Lambert looks to
a considerably better league record than the
0-6 marks posted by the Cardinals the past
two years.
"The league is definitely going to be
lough. Cal is going to be very strong as they
are the defending NCAA champions and have

their entire squad returning from last year.
UCLA will also be tough. These two teams
will be standing in our way for the Pacific
Eight Championship. In our case, we are a
team consisting mainly of freshmen,
sophomores and juniors and are considered
by many of our opponents to be in a
rebuilding year," he said.
Stanford's young team includes four
newcomers, who according to Lambert, "will
improve the Cardinals' chances significantly."
These are transfers Tom Elson and Frank
Forencich (a goalie) from DeAnza JC and
freshmen Rick Johanson from Santa Barbara
High School and Brian Avery from
Menfo-Atherton High School.
Ineligible Star
Despite this new blood, the Cardinals will

still be hurting offensively due to the loss of
Rick Gebers, who is inelligible due to
academic reasons. Last year, Gebers was the
leading scorer and provided most of
Stanford's offensive punch.
"The loss of Rich Gebers will definitely
hurt us as he was our leading scorer last year
and is a good college player," Lambert
remarked.
According to Lambert, sophomores Drew
McDonald and Paul Clark, who was named
player of the tournament at UC-Irvine, will
be looked upon for guidance in the team's
quest for the Pac-8 title.
The Cardinals meet Army here on
Saturday at 10 a.m. in a pre season match
and travel to USC to open their league season
on Oct. 11. According to Lambert, the
probably starters for Saturday's matchup are
Chris Dorst, Dean Anderson, Rick Johanson,
Craig VanZandt, Drew McDonald, and John
Paul Roberts with one spot undecided.
Psychological Edge
"We will definitely have the psychological
edge in that we have previously beaten the
Trojans in the pre season. However they are
tough, big, fast and strong and they can't be
taken lightly," Lambert emphasized.
According to Lambert, the young team's
performance so far is very pleasing.
"I am happy with the efforts and
enthusiasm put out by all the guys, but we
still have a lot of learning to do," he said.
