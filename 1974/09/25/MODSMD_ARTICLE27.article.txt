# Cards Hold Closed Session
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
If the Moody Blues were to
write an album about Stanford's
offense after the Illinois debacle,
(though I don't know why they
would) it might be titled "In
Search of The Lost Cordova."
Well, if the Cards found him
yesterday, no one will know for
awhile. Coach Jack Christiansen
sealed off practice within the high
walls of Stanford Stadium, and
the Concrete Curtain is set to
continue today.
While practice resembled
Albania—or maybe Columbus,
Ohio— some facts have leaked
out. For example, Gary Anderson
is now listed first on the depth
chart at offensive guard.
Anderson, a sophomore who
started last year, has re-won his
spot from junior college transfer
Tom Tipton.
The closed practices indicate
that Stanford is taking San Jose
State seriously. Yesterday, at the
Northern California Football
Writers Association luncheon in
San Francisco, Christiansen said,
"San Jose is in the same class as
Penn State and Illinois."
Chris also referred to the
Spartans' superb passing attack.
Quarterback Craig Kimball,
outside end Ike Mcßee and
flanker Mike Hopkins are all
potential All-Coast players and
"have found the right people to
work with at the right time."
At the luncheon, San Jose
defensive end Dave Wasick was
named Northern California
defensive player of the week.
Wasick is expected to give
Stanford headaches each time it
runs to its weak side Saturday.
While Chris was praising San
Jose, Spartan coach Darryl Rogers
was, as always, pretending his
team didn't have a ghost of a
chance. "Right now, there is
nothing I can do but shudder at
the possibility of playing
Stanford," Rogers said.
Rogers also blasted the Pacific

Eight officials who worked his
team's 17-16 loss to Cal Saturday.
"I hope we don't get the same
ones this week," was one of his
few on-the-record comments.
Those officials gave San Jose
State an "inferior" sportsmanship
rating after the Cal game. Rogers
said this was due to his protests,
and not because of any dirty play
by his team.
Pacific Eight team statistics
show Washington leading in three

categories, total offense, scoring
average and rushing defense
average, as well as being the
league's only unbeaten team.
Stanford leads only in passing
offense with a 247.5 average. The
Cards have two of the league's five
top passers, but also lead in passes
intercepted.
Student ticket sales at San Jose
for Saturday's game are going
extremely well. The school has
asked for an additional allotment
of tickets.

THREAT TO CARDS—Dave Wasick, San Jose State defensive end,
was named Northern California defensive player of the week
yesterday. A 6-foot-2, 225-pound senior, Wasick is considered a
definite pro prospect.
