## The 						Yankees Are (Sort Of) Back 
### Glenn Garvin 
CLEVELAND — Baseball's closest
approximation to automation, the New York
Yankees, clicked closer to another pennant
tonight just as inexorably as if the routine
had been programmed on punched tape.
Nah, that wasn't from this morning's
newspapers. It's been a hell of a long time
since anyone referred to the New York
Yankees as computerized robots in baseball
uniforms. In fact, it's been a long time since
anyone even referred to them as baseball
players in baseball uniforms.
That lead is from the New York Times 10
years ago this morning. The story went on to
detail how the Yankees demolished Cleveland
8-1 and 5-3 behind four home runs and some
tricky pitching by Whitey Ford and Mel
Stottlemyre.
That was September, 1964; it was a very
good year, if you care to recall. U.S.

Good Old Days
In South Vietnam, the government of
Premier Nguyen Khanh was facing strong
opposition from an urban labor movement.
In Italy and France the Communist parties
were wondering which side to take in the
newly-surfaced dispute between Peking and
Moscow. In New York CBS television was
plugging its new comedy The Munsters. And
in Pennsylvania, former vice president
Richard Nixon was telling reporters he would
make 100 speeches in 36 states for
Republican candidates during the home
stretch of the campaign.
Yes, 1964 was a very good year. Some
things haven't changed much, though; the
South Vietnamese government is still facing
strong opposition, and although Richard
Nixon has advanced to the rank of former

president he's still pretty much the same guy.
And the Yankees are back in first place.
You'd never know it was the same team.
The 1964 story about the doubleheader win
over Cleveland told how four home runs —
Joe Pepitone's 25th, Roger Maris' 24th,
Mickey Mantle's 33rd, and Phil Linz' fifth —
won the games.
Not The Same
These days the Yankees are lucky to hit
four home runs in one week, much less one
night. They've hit only 91 all season; when
Bobby Murcer hit his 9th and 10th in
consecutive games this weekend, there was
dancing in the streets of the Bronx.
In 1964, the New York pitching staff was
built around Whitey Ford, A 1 Downing, and
Jim Bouton, who won 48 games, and the
rookie Stottlemyre, who won nine in a little
over a month at the end of the season.
Stottlemyre is the only remaining Yankee
from the pennant-winning squad of 1964,
but he's been out most of the year with
injuries. The anonymous trio of Pat Dobson,
George Medich and George Tidrow has done
most of the pitching for New York this year;
they've won 47 games — and lost 41.
Not, it isn't really like the old days.
Substandard Stars
This Yankee team has been led by people
like Eliot Maddox and Lou Piniella, neither
what you would call household names. The
only two real stars on the team — outfielder
Bobbv Murcer and catcher Thurman Munson
— are suffering through substandard years.
It's a far cry from Maris, Mantle and
company.
These Yankees don't even play in Yankee
Stadium, which is closed for rebuilding; they
occupy Shea Stadium, home of that other
team across town. Shea doesn't conjure up
glorious memories of Babe Ruth parking
them; its traditions run more along the lines
of Marv Throneberry dropping pop flies.
The team itself is undergoing a major
rebuilding effort, too. It's baseball's answer

to urban renewal. No less than 13 of the
present Yankees were not with the team at
the end of last season, and that figure may
have edged up by the time you read this.
Somehow, They Win
Nevertheless, they're winning, and that's
what the old Yankees used to do. And the
fact that they're doing it largely without
dignity isn't really relevant when you look at
the standings.
Just how they're doing it remains
something of a mystery; they lack power and
the pitching staff is rather uneven. When
Dobson stopped Cleveland on four hits
Sunday he admitted he wasn't sure what had
happened.
"I had good stuff, but a pennant race
makes you pitch better than you can,"
Dobson explained to puzzled reporters.
In fairness, the team's hitting may have
been somewhat underestimated; the Yankees
are batting .264 as a squad, and that's
considerably better than the .253 average the
1964 team put together.
Fun Again
Maybe the best thing about the 1974
edition of the Bronx Bombers is that they've
made it fun for Yankee fans again. A 14-7
game may lack artistry, but it's exciting. And
just the other day outfielder Roy White
actually stole home; no one remembers the
last time a Yankee did that. And what the
hell, it's September and the Yankees are in a
pennant race. That makes up for just about
anything.
It's hard to believe that they'll manage to
beat out Baltimore's pitching staff for the
divisional title, or Oakland's all-around power
for the pennant. And to discuss the Yankees
in the same breath with Los Angeles is almost
laughable. Hedge your bets, though; someone
seems to be looking out for them. "We might
be Destiny's Darlings," Bobby Murcer
warned this week.
"But," he added, "I wish that we were
four or five games ahead at this point."

These days the Yankees are lucky to hit
four home runs in one week, much less one
night. They've hit only 91 all season; when
Bobby Murcer hit his 9th and 10th in
consecutive games this weekend, there was
dancing in the streets of the Bronx.
In 1964, the New York pitching staff was
built around Whitey Ford, A 1 Downing, and
Jim Bouton, who won 48 games, and the
rookie Stottlemyre, who won nine in a little
over a month at the end of the season.
Stottlemyre is the only remaining Yankee
from the pennant-winning squad of 1964,
but he's been out most of the year with
injuries. The anonymous trio of Pat Dobson,
George Medich and George Tidrow has done
most of the pitching for New York this year;
they've won 47 games — and lost 41.
Not, it isn't really like the old days.
Substandard Stars
This Yankee team has been led by people
like Eliot Maddox and Lou Piniella, neither
what you would call household names. The
only two real stars on the team — outfielder
Bobbv Murcer and catcher Thurman Munson
— are suffering through substandard years.
It's a far cry from Maris, Mantle and
company.
These Yankees don't even play in Yankee
Stadium, which is closed for rebuilding; they
occupy Shea Stadium, home of that other
team across town. Shea doesn't conjure up
glorious memories of Babe Ruth parking
them; its traditions run more along the lines
of Marv Throneberry dropping pop flies.
The team itself is undergoing a major
rebuilding effort, too. It's baseball's answer

to urban renewal. No less than 13 of the
present Yankees were not with the team at
the end of last season, and that figure may
have edged up by the time you read this.
Somehow, They Win
Nevertheless, they're winning, and that's
what the old Yankees used to do. And the
fact that they're doing it largely without
dignity isn't really relevant when you look at
the standings.
Just how they're doing it remains
something of a mystery; they lack power and
the pitching staff is rather uneven. When
Dobson stopped Cleveland on four hits
Sunday he admitted he wasn't sure what had
happened.
"I had good stuff, but a pennant race
makes you pitch better than you can,"
Dobson explained to puzzled reporters.
In fairness, the team's hitting may have
been somewhat underestimated; the Yankees
are batting .264 as a squad, and that's
considerably better than the .253 average the
1964 team put together.
Fun Again
Maybe the best thing about the 1974
edition of the Bronx Bombers is that they've
made it fun for Yankee fans again. A 14-7
game may lack artistry, but it's exciting. And
just the other day outfielder Roy White
actually stole home; no one remembers the
last time a Yankee did that. And what the
hell, it's September and the Yankees are in a
pennant race. That makes up for just about
anything.
It's hard to believe that they'll manage to
beat out Baltimore's pitching staff for the
divisional title, or Oakland's all-around power
for the pennant. And to discuss the Yankees
in the same breath with Los Angeles is almost
laughable. Hedge your bets, though; someone
seems to be looking out for them. "We might
be Destiny's Darlings," Bobby Murcer
warned this week.
"But," he added, "I wish that we were
four or five games ahead at this point."

8-1 and 5-3 behind four home runs and some
tricky pitching by Whitey Ford and Mel
Stottlemyre.

In South Vietnam, the government of

"I had good stuff, but a pennant race
makes you pitch better than you can,"
Dobson explained to puzzled reporters.
In fairness, the team's hitting may have
been somewhat underestimated; the Yankees
are batting .264 as a squad, and that's
considerably better than the .253 average the
1964 team put together.
Fun Again
Maybe the best thing about the 1974
edition of the Bronx Bombers is that they've
made it fun for Yankee fans again. A 14-7
game may lack artistry, but it's exciting. And
just the other day outfielder Roy White
actually stole home; no one remembers the
last time a Yankee did that. And what the
hell, it's September and the Yankees are in a
pennant race. That makes up for just about
anything.
It's hard to believe that they'll manage to
beat out Baltimore's pitching staff for the
divisional title, or Oakland's all-around power
for the pennant. And to discuss the Yankees
in the same breath with Los Angeles is almost
laughable. Hedge your bets, though; someone
seems to be looking out for them. "We might
be Destiny's Darlings," Bobby Murcer
warned this week.
"But," he added, "I wish that we were
four or five games ahead at this point."
CLEVELAND — Baseball's closest
approximation to automation, the New York
Yankees, clicked closer to another pennant
tonight just as inexorably as if the routine
had been programmed on punched tape.
Nah, that wasn't from this morning's
newspapers. It's been a hell of a long time
since anyone referred to the New York
Yankees as computerized robots in baseball
uniforms. In fact, it's been a long time since
anyone even referred to them as baseball
players in baseball uniforms.
That lead is from the New York Times 10
years ago this morning. The story went on to
detail how the Yankees demolished Cleveland
8-1 and 5-3 behind four home runs and some
tricky pitching by Whitey Ford and Mel
Stottlemyre.
That was September, 1964; it was a very
good year, if you care to recall. U.S.

Good Old Days
In South Vietnam, the government of
Premier Nguyen Khanh was facing strong
opposition from an urban labor movement.
In Italy and France the Communist parties
were wondering which side to take in the
newly-surfaced dispute between Peking and
Moscow. In New York CBS television was
plugging its new comedy The Munsters. And
in Pennsylvania, former vice president
Richard Nixon was telling reporters he would
make 100 speeches in 36 states for
Republican candidates during the home
stretch of the campaign.
Yes, 1964 was a very good year. Some
things haven't changed much, though; the
South Vietnamese government is still facing
strong opposition, and although Richard
Nixon has advanced to the rank of former

president he's still pretty much the same guy.
And the Yankees are back in first place.
You'd never know it was the same team.
The 1964 story about the doubleheader win
over Cleveland told how four home runs —
Joe Pepitone's 25th, Roger Maris' 24th,
Mickey Mantle's 33rd, and Phil Linz' fifth —
won the games.
Not The Same
These days the Yankees are lucky to hit
four home runs in one week, much less one
night. They've hit only 91 all season; when
Bobby Murcer hit his 9th and 10th in
consecutive games this weekend, there was
dancing in the streets of the Bronx.
In 1964, the New York pitching staff was
built around Whitey Ford, A 1 Downing, and
Jim Bouton, who won 48 games, and the
rookie Stottlemyre, who won nine in a little
over a month at the end of the season.
Stottlemyre is the only remaining Yankee
from the pennant-winning squad of 1964,
but he's been out most of the year with
injuries. The anonymous trio of Pat Dobson,
George Medich and George Tidrow has done
most of the pitching for New York this year;
they've won 47 games — and lost 41.
Not, it isn't really like the old days.
Substandard Stars
This Yankee team has been led by people
like Eliot Maddox and Lou Piniella, neither
what you would call household names. The
only two real stars on the team — outfielder
Bobbv Murcer and catcher Thurman Munson
— are suffering through substandard years.
It's a far cry from Maris, Mantle and
company.
These Yankees don't even play in Yankee
Stadium, which is closed for rebuilding; they
occupy Shea Stadium, home of that other
team across town. Shea doesn't conjure up
glorious memories of Babe Ruth parking
them; its traditions run more along the lines
of Marv Throneberry dropping pop flies.
The team itself is undergoing a major
rebuilding effort, too. It's baseball's answer

to urban renewal. No less than 13 of the
present Yankees were not with the team at
the end of last season, and that figure may
have edged up by the time you read this.
Somehow, They Win
Nevertheless, they're winning, and that's
what the old Yankees used to do. And the
fact that they're doing it largely without
dignity isn't really relevant when you look at
the standings.
Just how they're doing it remains
something of a mystery; they lack power and
the pitching staff is rather uneven. When
Dobson stopped Cleveland on four hits
Sunday he admitted he wasn't sure what had
happened.
"I had good stuff, but a pennant race
makes you pitch better than you can,"
Dobson explained to puzzled reporters.
