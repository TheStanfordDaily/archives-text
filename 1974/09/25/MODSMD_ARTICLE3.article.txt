# PIRG Seeks Larger Membership, Gropes For Stronger Structure

The campus counterpart to Ralph
Nader's "Raiders" has made its official
debut here, but needs organizational
support and student input before
tackling the problems of the
community, according to Jack Handy,
a Stanford chapter organizer.
The Northern California Public
Interest Research Group (NorCal
PIRG) is still in the formative stage,
Handy explained. "Right now, we're
mostly interested in getting by-laws set
up and getting the membership back
together."
Students have established PIRGs in
19 states to educate the public about
community problems, do research
work, lobby, and file lawsuits, Handy
said. A paid staff of lawyers and
scientists provide knowledge and skill
in the PIRG arrangement.
In this area, NorCal PIRG has three
contributing member
schools—Stanford, University of Santa
Clara, and Hastings Law School in San
Francisco. The Stanford group has
spent its time so far preparing to
recruit student members and
bargaining with University officials
about financing.
A membership drive will begin
shortly.
"Within the next three weeks we
hope to go to the dormitories to
explain PIRG and to distribute a
survey on what projects students
would like to see us do and which ones
they'd like to participate in" Handy
said. "A lot of people just don't know
what PIRG is."
Handy added that one problem
facing the group is a widespread belief
that PIRG's fee assessment was
defeated in balloting last spring.
"I see a lot of students who
thought that PIRG died last spring,"
Handy said. "I think people should
know that PIRG is alive and well."

PIRG's health didn't look as good
over the summer, however, when the
University started asking how the fee
assessment was to be spent.
"The University has a policy of not
collecting funds for outside groups.
We're keeping the money here and
participating in very close liaison with
the central PIRG," Handy said.
Dale Snape, assistant dean of
student affairs, said in a memorandum
that the NorCal PIRG office will not
control student funds. Instead, funds
will be approved for projects
undertaken by Stanford students and
"educational to them."
The Stanford group will submit a
project outline with lists of
participating students which the
University will judge. Fees for
consultants may be paid upon
approval, and a $300 yearly
membership fee will be paid by the
chapter to NorCal PIRG.
"The Univeristy was very generous
in allowing uses for funds- they can be
used for consulting fees, travel
expenses, etc.," Handy said.
The regional unit has six projects
planned—including studies of property
taxes, interest rates on loans, and the
cost of living—but Handy wouldn't say
what projects were being discussed for
the Stanford chapter, with one
exception.
"One project we'd like to do here is
a survey of gasoline prices in the area,"
Handy stated. NorCal PIRG's Santa
Clara chapter recently released a
similar study, which Handy described
as "a very useful service."
Representatives of the group here
distributed "legislator's scorecards" to
interested students on registration
days. The scorecard resulted from a
regional PIRG project.
Students with project ideas can get
them to Handy bv leaving a note at
the ASSU office in Tresidder. At

present, PIRG has no office space,
though the ASSU should give them
further word by Thursday.
After projects begin, PIRG workers
could conceivably receive course credit
for their efforts, possibly through an
arrangement with SWOPSI.
