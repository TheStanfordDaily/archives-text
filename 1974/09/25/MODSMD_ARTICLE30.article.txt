Cavalli's Expecting
Sports Information Director
Gary Cavalli and his wife Christy
are expecting the couple's first
child in late March, he announced

yesterday.
The new SID has improved the
department markedly since he
took over. One reason for this is
the hiring of Nancy Peterson to
write releases and features, an area
in which the office has been weak.
Garcia Signs
ANAHEIM (AP) -Rod Garcia,
who kicked a modern major
college record of 42 field goals in
his career at Stanford, signed a
contract yesterday with the
Southern California Sun of the
World Football League.
The 5-foot-9, 165-pound
soccer-style kicker was cut by the
Oakland Raiders of the National
Football League. He was a
seventh-round NFL draft choice
of the Raiders, who have George
Blanda doing their place kicking.
Garcia, who last year tied the
modern major college single

season record for field goals at 18,
joins the Sun in time for its game
tonight against Jacksonville at
Anaheim Stadium.
His longest collegiate field goal
was a 59-yarder against Southern
California last season, when he
also succeeded on a 53-yarder. He
was accurate on 71 percent of his
field goal attempts under 50
yards, and last season kicked 18
of 29 through the uprights.
The Sun has had only two field
goals in 13 attempts in 12 games
this season and Garcia becomes
the ninth man used as a
placekicker.
Besides wide receiver Dave
Williams and quarterback Tony
Adams, the Sun has used Steve
Schroder, Jim Martin, Nick
Dezepina, Fleming Jensen, Mike
Burke and Ron Svarc.
