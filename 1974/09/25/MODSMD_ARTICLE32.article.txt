Rocky: Nixon Admitted Guilt
WASHINGTON - Nelson A. Rockefeller
yesterday said former President Richard M.
Nixon's acceptance of a pardon was the
equivalent of an admission of guilt.
The subjects shifted rapidly but no major
opposition developed to Rockefeller's vice
presidential nomination in his second day of
testimony before the Senate Rules and
Administration Committee.
Rockefeller said that if he ever became
president while the cases of Watergate
defendants were still pending, he would judge
any applications for pardon on a case-by-case
basis after careful review.
He described Ford's pardon of Nixon an act
of compassion and said that he believed there
was a widespread feeling in Congress and in the
country that a former president should not be
sent to jail.
'The President accepted a pardon which in
my opinion is tantamount to admitting guilt,"
Rockfeller said of Nixon.
During questioning about Attica, Rockefeller
said that if he were again governor during a
prison revolt he would order police to attack

without weapons if that were at all possible.
Ehrlichman To Call 80
WASHINGTON — John D. Ehrlichman, one
of six defendants in the Watergate cover-up trial,
said yesterday that he plans to call 80 witnesses,
including Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
and White House chief of staff Alexander M.
Haig.
Attorneys for former White House assistant
Ehrlichman said they also will call James D. St.
Clair, an attorney who represented former
President Richard M. Nixon, and former White
House Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler.
Meanwhile, special prosecutor Leon Jaworski
released his own list of 44 witnesses for the trial
scheduled to begin next Tuesday. Among them
are former FBI Director L. Patrick Gray and the
foreman of the grand jury which indicted the
cover-up defendants, Vladimir Pregelj.
Both Jaworski and Ehrlichman have
subpoenaed Nixon to testify.
Kidnap Victim Found
CINCINNATI — Four-year-old Allison
Mechem was returned to her parents unharmed
yesterday and two men were later apprehended
about 15 miles from the fashionable home
where she was kidnaped.
The girl's father, Charles S. Mechem Jr., said
his daughter was held almost the entire 24 hours
of her captivity in a motel room about five miles
from her home. She had been pulled into a car
from her front yard Monday while riding
tricycles with a friend.
"Our little girl is back and she's happy," said
Mechem.
Police said Mechem had cooperated with
ransom instructions but that the ransom was
never picked up.
The two men were apprehended in a chili
parlor some 15 miles from the Mechem home.
County police received a tip that a man
matching the description of the kidnaper was
driving a white van. The men were picked up
after the van was spotted in front of the
restaurant.
House Unit Okays Nixon Funds
WASHINGTON — The House Appropriations
Committee approved $398,000 in transition
money yesterday for former President Richard
M. Nixon but said his White House tapes and
papers should not be moved until the Watergate
prosecutor and courts complete arrangements

for access to them.
The committee approved a cut made in
subcommittee last week of $452,000 from the
$850,000 requested by President Ford for
Nixon's expenses in winding down his affairs.
It rejected all $110,000 for a vault, near San
Clemente, in which Nixon and the Ford
administration had agreed to store the tapes and
papers.

BOSTON — Police patrolled the corridors of
Hyde Park High School yesterday keeping apart
groups of scuffleing white and black students
upset about court-ordered school busing.
Meanwhile,about seven miles away, some 200
persons demonstrated against busing near
Charlestown High School, even though the
predominately white Charlestown section of the
city is not affected by the current busing
integration order.
Police said eight persons were arrested,
mostly for disorderly conduct, in Charlestown
and at Hyde Park High. One police officer was
injured in Charlestown when bitten by a
demonstrator.
School officials said classrooms were calm
yesterday at the rest of Boston's 200 schools,
including South Boston High School, scene of
several anti-busing disturbances.
Ford Names Haig Replacement
WASHINGTON — Virtually completing the
organization of his top staff, President Gerald
Ford announced yesterday he is appointing
Donald Rumsfeld as assistant responsible for
coordinating White House operations.
Rumsfeld, a 42-year-old former Republican
house member from Illinois, will take up his
Cabinet-ranked post Friday, but will continue
temporarily also to serve as U.S. ambassador to
NATO.
Press Secretary Ronald Nessen said
Rumsfeld, who helped engineer Ford's 1965
election as House GOP leader, will succeed Gen.
Alexander M. Haig Jr., but will not have Haig's
title as White House chief of staff.
"It's a Ford White House now," said Nessen.
Israeli Planes Hit Lebanon

targets yesterday as Israel's armed forces staged

Yom Kippur war in 1973.

fighting almost a year ago.

Syrian forces struck across the cease fire lines
during Yom Kippur.
Suit Seeks A Koto's Ouster
SAN FRANCISCO — A class action suit
seeking the immediate ouster of Mayor Joseph
L. Alioto for alleged conflict of interest was
filed yesterday by a coalition of "public interest
groups."
The Superior Court suit says the mayor is a
member of all city boards and commissions to
which he appoints members. It points out that
at least five clients of Alioto's private law firm
are subject to regulation by such panels.
The action also notes that Alioto is one of
three guarantors of a $2.3 million in bank loans
an Alioto family syndicate used to purchase the
ailing Pacific Far East Line which uses the Port
of San Francisco.
