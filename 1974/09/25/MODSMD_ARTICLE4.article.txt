# Ford Foundation Grant Guts Gould Cause Stanford Pain
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
If inflation and a depressed security
market forces the Ford Foundation to
reduce its annual grants, Stanford may
suffer painfully from the cuts.
The nation's largest philanthropic
agency contributed $1.76 million to
the University during the fiscal year in
areas ranging from minority graduate
fellowships ($450,463) to the
undergraduate program in human
biology ($67,812), according to
figures compiled yesterday by Asst.
Foundations Director Ray Caldera.
That amount was a marked
decrease from the previous year's
$2.84 million.
The Foundation's 18-member
board of directors yesterday began
consideration of proposals to reduce
its $220 million annual budget by as
much as 50 percent at its quarterly
meeting in New York.
Dissolve?
Foundation President McGeorge
Bundy told the New York Times the
agency would have to be dissolved by
distributing its assets if there was no
reduction in grants.
How much, when, and in which
areas the cuts will affect Stanford are
matters for speculation as the
Foundation board mulls over
proposals. It may not act upon them
until next spring.
But Richard Magat, a spokesman
for the Ford Foundation in New York,
confirmed that present grants and
outstanding pledges will not be
affected: "There's no question. Any
cuts will not affect existing grants."
Presently, the University has yet to
receive $1,744,267 in outstanding
pledges — which are to be paid in the
future on a schedule.
Recipients
Other major recipients of Ford
Foundation grants in the fiscal year
ending last Aug. 31 include the
International Studies Committee
($318,253), the School of Education
program for developmental education
($300,592), the University Fellows
Program ($198,582), the Professional
Journalism Fellows ($103,764), and

the Graduate School of Business
M.B.A. program ($85,000), according
to figures provided by Caldera's office.
Vice President for Development
Kenneth Cuthbertson noted that
"we've been aware that [the
Foundation] was making grants at a
level in excess of their income."
But he said the University would
have to wait and see in which areas
and in what amounts budget cuts are
made before it can plan a course of
action.
The cuts would not affect grants
for at least a year; meanwhile, the

"volume of proposals submitted to the
Foundation will be maintained,"
Caldera said.
The offices of Cuthbertson and
General Secretary Daryl Pearson are
responsible for gauging the interests
and intentions of prospective donors
such as the Ford Foundation.
Should cutbacks in grants be made,
the office of Vice President and
Provost William Miller must determine
the priorities of the University for
future donations.
Miller, away on a business trip, was
unavailable for comment yesterday.

SOONER OR LATER—They'll wrap up construction on Stanford's new law
school. Right now it seems like later— about eight months later. Officials hope
that delays plaguing construction will end in time for completion in May of
next year.
