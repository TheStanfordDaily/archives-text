# 209 Still Requesting On-Campus Housing
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
The number of students still
looking for campus housing has
dropped considerably since the Sept. 1
waiting list was posted, but it's still
much higher than last year's, Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton
said yesterday.
Some 151 men and 58 women
reconfirmed their waiting list standing,
Horton reported. Last year, on the
second day after registration, 28 men
and no women had signed the
reconfirmed waiting list, he said.
While these die-hards anxiously
await vacancies in the housing system,
a majority of the 820 students on the
former waiting list succumbed to the
housing crunch panic and used
Clearing House resources to find
off-campus housing.
No Football
The Clearing House volunteers, who
have sacrificed "football games and
their personal lives," according to
Clearing House head Lise Pfeiffer,
spent their 18th and final day
directing students to . boards
overflowing with off-campus housing
lists.
According to rental housing

records, 392 off-campus houses,
apartments and rooms have been
rented since the first day of the
Clearing House, Sept. 7.
Approximately 175 students have
filled out questionnaires making
suggestions and comments about the
Clearing House after they found
housing.
Frank And Honest
Pfeiffer suggested that next year
incoming transfers should be
confronted "frankly and honestly"
with the housing situation when they
apply, not after they are accepted.
She also proposed a short seminar
on "How To Rent" as part of the
program because many of the students
had never rented before and were
baffled by forboding landlords.
Not only a rental agency, the
Clearing House introduced transfers
and returning students to the Bay Area
through field trips to the wine
country, San Francisco, Alcatraz and
Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour Restaurant.
Students looking for housing spent
a week in the Clearing House Hotel
(the converted Stern Hall) meeting
prospective roommates and dining at
the Eating Clubs for a small fee.
