FARM FROLlC—Stanford's new freshman class got its first taste of the thrilling collegiate social life last night. Hundreds of them showed up—along with a
lot of upperclassmen, too—to sample the exotic wares at the Tresidder Carnival, Stanford's answer to Disneyland. Snowcone-eating and dart-throwing were
just two of many fun-filled activities they could participate in. A good time was had by all.
