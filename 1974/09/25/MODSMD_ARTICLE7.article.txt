Bike Paths
Editor:
A month ago a pile of leaves
and rubble was dumped onto a
bike path through a vacant lot
between Jordan Hall and Via
Crespi. The clear intent was to
discourage bicycle traffic which
also cut across 15 feet of lawn at
the edge of the lot. I removed the
rubble. A week later another pile
appeared, and I removed that too.
No more was dumped, but last
night my tire was spiked by a
rusty fence hinge, in the middle of
the path which is used dozens of
times a day.
The first issue is landscape
design. If bike traffic is permitted,
it will wear a path through the
lawn. On the other hand, the
route carries major traffic
between the medical area and
center campus. Detours around
the path go through crowded
sidewalks between parked cars
and pedestrians.
At least one campus, Antioch
in Ohio, routinely paves where
footpaths have been worn through
the grass. The result is an unusual
grace, S-curves not planned on a
drawing board but developed over
years by the daily travel of
thousands of students. A side
benefit is that there are no muddy
paths or "keep off" signs like
those at square-corner style
campuses. Stanford already has
excellent landscaping, but still
there is room for natural growth.
The other issue is human
respect in the actions of the
bureaucracy. The decision to close
a major bikeway should be made
carefully and deliberately, not
routinely, and certainly never
enforced with piles of rubble.

'An Old Ford'
Editor:
What's in an old Ford?
Funeral
Of
Representational
D emocracy
and the restoration of Direct
Democracy, i.e. without
representatives or delegates.
Neither leadership nor
followership. Neither driver nor
driven. Neither guru not disciple.
Neither teacher nor student.
Look within. Be intensely
aware of that inner flow of

thoughts, feelings and actions.
Realize that you are simply the
Observer/Experiencer/Perceiver of
that endless flood.
Then walk further on.

Political Rally
Editor:
The Chinese Students Union of
Stanford advertised that they
would show two films one night
last month in Tresidder, one on
Chinese martial arts and the other
Chinatown, My Home.
But in between the films we
were treated to long speeches
describing a garment workers
strike in Chinatown. I tried to say
that we had been taken advantage
of, but was told to wait until the
question and answer period. So
I'll speak here.
They tricked us into listening
to a political rally by offering
films. Whatever the merits of their
cause (worthy, judging by what
was said), they acted unfairly and
deceitfully, demonstrating the
same qualities they protest in the
Chinatown employers.

Wants Correspondents
Editor:
I am presently an inmate at the
United States Penitentiary on
McNeil Island in the State of
Washington. I'm 27 years old,
born under the sign Aquarius,
5-foot-9 and 165 pounds. I hail
from the nation's capital.
I am writing this letter in the
hope that your paper can aid me
in the re-establishment of contact
with the outside. Hopefully, some
young body would consider
corresponding with me.
I write poems and would love
to send them to anyone who
might like them. Since my
incarceration, my friends and
acquaintances have shown their
true loyalty by not writing letters
to me. Since I am so far from
home, I am very depressed about
not receiving mail.
I humbly implore your paper
to assist me in my desperate
attempt to re-establish ties with
outside reality.
