# Students Reveal Plans For Residence College
## 
### JOHN FREED 
A residential college here, involving
45 students and five professors in a
two-quarter intensive learning
experience, reached the public
planning stage yesterday.
Tentatively named
"Stanford-in-Stanford" because of
similarities between this program and
the Stanford Overseas Campuses, the
idea originated with Tom Glenn, an
anthropology graduate student, and
ASSU President Mike Herman.
During the ASSU electoral
campaign last spring, one plank in the
Herman slate's platform dealt with a
residential college.
Program Organization
If all goes according to plan, the
program would work this way:
—A nine-member Policy
Committee, including three students,
would select five faculty members,
from a variety of disciplines, one year
in advance of the two-quarter period
in which they would participate;
—At the same time, the Policy
Committee would name a "focus," or
general topic, to be explored by
faculty and students in the program;
—At the outset of the following
quarter, nine months before a given
program begins, the committee will
announce the 45 students admitted to
the program.
Two-Quarter Sessions
Two sessions would be offered each
year — Autumn-Winter and
Spring-Summer. Participants would be
forbidden to participate in classes
offered by the regular University.
Larry Horton, associate dean of
student affairs for residential
education, questioned the isolation of
students from regular classes.
"I am enthusiastically in support of
programs to encourage education in
the residences," Horton remarked.
"But, I feel residential education
should complement instruction at the
Quad, not compete with it."
Isolation Questioned
Glenn, explaining the proposal at a
press conference yesterday, argued
that participants would probably have
to drop outside classes in order to
immerse themselves in the program.
The proposal would prevent a student
from overburdening himself, Glenn
noted.
However, social interaction with
fellow students will not be controlled.
"We weren't particularly looking for
residence within the
house on the part of the faculty
members or anyone else—it's not a
jail," Glenn said. "We're not trying to
create that kind of social isolation."
Funding of the proposal remains a
question.
The program could cost up to

$150,000 per year to operate," Glenn
said. Expenses will depend on how
many faculty members participate and
whether they take part on a full-or
half-time basis, he explained.
Herman discussed possible sources
of money, all but eliminating the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies (ODUS) from consideration. If
approved, "Stanford-in-Stanford" will
receive administrative backing from
ODUS, but not financial support.
"At the Dean's office, the budget is
tight," Herman explained. "The
money could come from the Provost's
office, the Carnegie Foundation, the
Ford Foundation, or other
foundations."
However, funding by foundations
took a turn for the worse Tuesday,
when the Ford Foundation began
considering proposals to reduce its
budget by as much as 50 percent.
Other problems yet to be overcome

RESIDENT PRESIDENT—ASSU President Mike Herman proposes a new
residential college tentatively named "Stanford-in-Stanford" at a press
conference on KZSU radio last night. The program would involve 45 students
and five professors in an intense two-quarter learning experience.
include: finding a house where the
program could be held; providing
housing for students leaving the
program; arranging draw exemptions
for entering participants; and finding
faculty members willing to devote two
quarters in residence with the students
in the program.
Commenting on the difficulty of
finding suitable housing for the
program, Herman said that
configurations like the Cowell cluster
have limited facilities for faculty
residents. "There exists no residence
on campus that can house five
professors and 45 students," he said.
Herman acknowledged that finding
housing space for students leaving the
program is a problem. However, he
suggested it be handled as with
students returning from overseas.
Horton said draw exemptions could
be approved "if a sufficient need was
shown" to justify exempting the entire
program. Herman was confident that,
with administration support, the
exemptions would be approved.
Glenn said that finding professors
would be no more difficult than
finding faculty willing to devote
themselves to two quarters overseas.
