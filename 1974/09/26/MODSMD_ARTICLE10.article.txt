# Fischer: Howard Cosell Of Chess?
## 
### 
Stephen Carter

Bobby Fischer could have been
the Howard Cosell of chess.
Fischer, the stormy and
tempestuous former World
Champion, created unprecedented
interest in chess with his antics
prior to his match with Boris
Spassky of the Soviet Union in
summer of 1972. Cosell has done
the same for Monday Night
Football.
People who didn't know a rook
from a pawn hung on the edges of
their seats to hear the score of the
latest game. What would happen
next? Another Fischer walkout?
A Soviet protest? A forfeit?
For such newspapers as the
New York Times, chess suddenly
became front page material — and
when Spassky resigned the 21st
and final game of the match, the
Times used a banner headline.
Chess was big stuff!
Publishing companies began
seeking out grandmasters to
author new books — books the
public was sure to snap up —
about all aspects of the game.
Entertainer Bobby Darin and
Church's Fried Chicken — among
others — quickly decided to
sponsor new international chess
tournaments, with record prizes.
Chess changed almost overnight,
in the United States at least, from
a game played by aging men in
dreary chess parlors in Brooklyn
to a popular and vary "in"
recreation — or even vocation.
Fischer was directly
responsible for the growth. And as
long as he stayed in the public
eye, chess prospered. Strangers on
street corners would debate
whether Bobby was a real son of a
bitch, or merely an obnoxious,
self-centered bastard.
There he stood, like Cosell —
people loved hating him, and
chess profited thereby.
As long as Fischer would
continue his antics — or, as some
would have it, his tactics — chess
would continue to grow in the
United States. And considering
the then — World Champion's
youth and enthusiasm, and the
drive which had long pushed him
toward the top of the chess world,
such a continuance seemed
certain.
In the January, 1962, issue of
Harper's, the chess world's enfant
terrible had enthused over his role
if and when he won the
championship. "I'll make a tour
of the whole world, giving
exhibitions," he vowed. "When I
come home I'll write a couple of
chess books and start to
reorganize the whole game. . . . I'll
hold big international
tournaments in my club with big
cash prizes."
The Soviet Union, he charged
then and later, was ruining chess.
Their grandmasters cheated, their
world champions (Fischer was the
first non-Soviet world champion
in a quarter of a century) played
rarely and easily. Fischer vowed
frequently in the following years
to defend his title annually and
never to be inactive as World
Champion. Chess enthusiasts in
the U.S. confidently looked
forward to the game's continuing
expansion.
But Bobby let us down.
After decisively defeating
Spassky for the title, he went into
virtual isolation. He opened no
club, played no exhibitions, wrote
no book, entered no tournaments.
But he had been isolated before.
However, last summer, in an

event little noticed amid the
political and economic crises,
Robert James Fischer submitted
his resignation as World Champion
to the International Chess
Federation (FIDE).
Why did he do it? There are
probably several reasons. On the
surface, the resignation was a
protest of a new rule concerning
world championship matches, a
rule which virtually eliminates the
champion's built-in advantage.
But Fischer had protested this
very advantage in a July 6, 1972,
letter to Boris Spassky.
But there were probably other
reasons.
Fischer is infamous for his
overbearing pride and arrogance.
Since 1966-67, he has refused to
play in the U.S. Championship,
although he has won that event

every year he has competed.
Former U.S. Champion Arthur
Bisguier claims Fischer has
avoided that event because of a
fear of finishing second.
The same could be true, now,
of world-class chess. To World
Champion Fischer, the ignominy
of losing a game — or of finishing
second! — in a chess tournament
might be too much, and Fischer,
who is reputed to have told a
reporter "Just because you're
paranoid, doesn't mean they're
not out to get ya," probably fears
that greatly.
Moreover, many observers
doubt whether Fischer could
defeat his most likely challenger,
young Anatoly Karpov, in the
World Championship match
scheduled for next summer.
Should the Fischer resignation

stand, the winner of Karpov's
current match with his Soviet
compatriot, Victor Korchnoi,
would become World Champion.
FIDE has given Fischer until
Feb. 1, 1975, to rescind his
resignation. If he follows in his
past form, he will send the
required cablegram on Jan. 31,
then proceed to thrash Karpov
and retain his championship.
If, on the other hand, his
retirement is real this time, the
chess world will have suffered a
great loss, one tantamount to
ABC's sacrificing Howard Cosell.
Because without Cosell, Monday
Night Football would be just
another game.

Bobby Fischer could have been
the Howard Cosell of chess.
Fischer, the stormy and
tempestuous former World
Champion, created unprecedented
interest in chess with his antics
prior to his match with Boris
Spassky of the Soviet Union in
summer of 1972. Cosell has done
the same for Monday Night
Football.
People who didn't know a rook
from a pawn hung on the edges of
their seats to hear the score of the
latest game. What would happen
next? Another Fischer walkout?
A Soviet protest? A forfeit?
For such newspapers as the
New York Times, chess suddenly
became front page material — and
when Spassky resigned the 21st
and final game of the match, the
Times used a banner headline.
Chess was big stuff!
Publishing companies began
seeking out grandmasters to
author new books — books the
public was sure to snap up —
about all aspects of the game.
Entertainer Bobby Darin and
Church's Fried Chicken — among
others — quickly decided to
sponsor new international chess
tournaments, with record prizes.
Chess changed almost overnight,
in the United States at least, from
a game played by aging men in
dreary chess parlors in Brooklyn
to a popular and vary "in"
recreation — or even vocation.
Fischer was directly
responsible for the growth. And as
long as he stayed in the public
eye, chess prospered. Strangers on
street corners would debate
whether Bobby was a real son of a
bitch, or merely an obnoxious,
self-centered bastard.
There he stood, like Cosell —
people loved hating him, and
chess profited thereby.
As long as Fischer would
continue his antics — or, as some
would have it, his tactics — chess
would continue to grow in the
United States. And considering
the then — World Champion's
youth and enthusiasm, and the
drive which had long pushed him
toward the top of the chess world,
such a continuance seemed
certain.
In the January, 1962, issue of
Harper's, the chess world's enfant
terrible had enthused over his role
if and when he won the
championship. "I'll make a tour
of the whole world, giving
exhibitions," he vowed. "When I
come home I'll write a couple of
chess books and start to
reorganize the whole game. . . . I'll
hold big international
tournaments in my club with big
cash prizes."
The Soviet Union, he charged
then and later, was ruining chess.
Their grandmasters cheated, their
world champions (Fischer was the
first non-Soviet world champion
in a quarter of a century) played
rarely and easily. Fischer vowed
frequently in the following years
to defend his title annually and
never to be inactive as World
Champion. Chess enthusiasts in
the U.S. confidently looked
forward to the game's continuing
expansion.
But Bobby let us down.
After decisively defeating
Spassky for the title, he went into
virtual isolation. He opened no
club, played no exhibitions, wrote
no book, entered no tournaments.
But he had been isolated before.
However, last summer, in an

event little noticed amid the
political and economic crises,
Robert James Fischer submitted
his resignation as World Champion
to the International Chess
Federation (FIDE).
Why did he do it? There are
probably several reasons. On the
surface, the resignation was a
protest of a new rule concerning
world championship matches, a
rule which virtually eliminates the
champion's built-in advantage.
But Fischer had protested this
very advantage in a July 6, 1972,
letter to Boris Spassky.
But there were probably other
reasons.
Fischer is infamous for his
overbearing pride and arrogance.
Since 1966-67, he has refused to
play in the U.S. Championship,
although he has won that event

every year he has competed.
Former U.S. Champion Arthur
Bisguier claims Fischer has
avoided that event because of a
fear of finishing second.
The same could be true, now,
of world-class chess. To World
Champion Fischer, the ignominy
of losing a game — or of finishing
second! — in a chess tournament
might be too much, and Fischer,
who is reputed to have told a
reporter "Just because you're
paranoid, doesn't mean they're
not out to get ya," probably fears
that greatly.
Moreover, many observers
doubt whether Fischer could
defeat his most likely challenger,
young Anatoly Karpov, in the
World Championship match
scheduled for next summer.
Should the Fischer resignation

stand, the winner of Karpov's
current match with his Soviet
compatriot, Victor Korchnoi,
would become World Champion.
FIDE has given Fischer until
Feb. 1, 1975, to rescind his
resignation. If he follows in his

fear of finishing second.
The same could be true, now,
of world-class chess. To World
Champion Fischer, the ignominy
of losing a game — or of finishing
second! — in a chess tournament
might be too much, and Fischer,
who is reputed to have told a
reporter "Just because you're
paranoid, doesn't mean they're
not out to get ya," probably fears
that greatly.
Moreover, many observers
doubt whether Fischer could
defeat his most likely challenger,
young Anatoly Karpov, in the
World Championship match
scheduled for next summer.
Should the Fischer resignation

stand, the winner of Karpov's
current match with his Soviet
compatriot, Victor Korchnoi,
would become World Champion.
FIDE has given Fischer until
Feb. 1, 1975, to rescind his
resignation. If he follows in his
past form, he will send the
required cablegram on Jan. 31,
then proceed to thrash Karpov
and retain his championship.
If, on the other hand, his
retirement is real this time, the
chess world will have suffered a
great loss, one tantamount to
ABC's sacrificing Howard Cosell.
Because without Cosell, Monday
Night Football would be just
another game.

Bobby Fischer could have been
the Howard Cosell of chess.
Fischer, the stormy and
tempestuous former World
Champion, created unprecedented
interest in chess with his antics
prior to his match with Boris
Spassky of the Soviet Union in
summer of 1972. Cosell has done
the same for Monday Night
Football.
People who didn't know a rook
from a pawn hung on the edges of
their seats to hear the score of the
latest game. What would happen
next? Another Fischer walkout?
A Soviet protest? A forfeit?
For such newspapers as the
New York Times, chess suddenly
became front page material — and
when Spassky resigned the 21st
and final game of the match, the
Times used a banner headline.
Chess was big stuff!
Publishing companies began
seeking out grandmasters to
author new books — books the
public was sure to snap up —
about all aspects of the game.
Entertainer Bobby Darin and
Church's Fried Chicken — among
others — quickly decided to
sponsor new international chess
tournaments, with record prizes.
Chess changed almost overnight,
in the United States at least, from
a game played by aging men in
dreary chess parlors in Brooklyn
to a popular and vary "in"
recreation — or even vocation.
Fischer was directly
responsible for the growth. And as
long as he stayed in the public
eye, chess prospered. Strangers on
street corners would debate
whether Bobby was a real son of a
bitch, or merely an obnoxious,
self-centered bastard.
There he stood, like Cosell —
people loved hating him, and
chess profited thereby.
As long as Fischer would
continue his antics — or, as some
would have it, his tactics — chess
would continue to grow in the
United States. And considering
the then — World Champion's
youth and enthusiasm, and the
drive which had long pushed him
toward the top of the chess world,
such a continuance seemed
certain.
In the January, 1962, issue of
Harper's, the chess world's enfant
terrible had enthused over his role
if and when he won the
championship. "I'll make a tour
of the whole world, giving
exhibitions," he vowed. "When I
come home I'll write a couple of
chess books and start to
reorganize the whole game. . . . I'll
hold big international
tournaments in my club with big
cash prizes."
The Soviet Union, he charged
then and later, was ruining chess.
Their grandmasters cheated, their
world champions (Fischer was the
first non-Soviet world champion
in a quarter of a century) played
rarely and easily. Fischer vowed
frequently in the following years
to defend his title annually and
never to be inactive as World
Champion. Chess enthusiasts in
the U.S. confidently looked
forward to the game's continuing
expansion.
But Bobby let us down.
After decisively defeating
Spassky for the title, he went into
virtual isolation. He opened no
club, played no exhibitions, wrote
no book, entered no tournaments.
But he had been isolated before.
However, last summer, in an

event little noticed amid the
political and economic crises,
Robert James Fischer submitted
his resignation as World Champion
to the International Chess
Federation (FIDE).
Why did he do it? There are
probably several reasons. On the
surface, the resignation was a
protest of a new rule concerning
world championship matches, a
rule which virtually eliminates the
champion's built-in advantage.
But Fischer had protested this
very advantage in a July 6, 1972,
letter to Boris Spassky.
But there were probably other
reasons.
Fischer is infamous for his
overbearing pride and arrogance.
Since 1966-67, he has refused to
play in the U.S. Championship,
although he has won that event

every year he has competed.
Former U.S. Champion Arthur
Bisguier claims Fischer has
avoided that event because of a
fear of finishing second.
The same could be true, now,
of world-class chess. To World
Champion Fischer, the ignominy
of losing a game — or of finishing
