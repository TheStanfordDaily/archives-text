# ASSU Needs You!

Hey You!
Now that the summer's over
and we're about to start dealing
with school I'd like to tell you
some things and ask you to join
me in helping you.
With the Watergate scandal
people began to take an even
dimmer view of politicians — not
that this dimmer view was
unjustified — but we of the ASSU
Senate and government don't view
outselves in the same dim light.
We are elected by you, to
represent you (sound familiar?),
but with one great difference: you
can become an elected member of
your governing body — regardless
of race, color, creed, national
origin, sex, age or economic
background!
We need you to make us viable.
ASSU Is You
The Associated Students of
Stanford University is you and
our government is only as strong
as you make us.
Supporting the ASSU is
supporting yourself.
The 1974-75 Senate elections
are to be held in October. Stop by
the ASSU to pick up a petition.
You can run for office yourself or
convince and support a
responsible friend to do so. There
are no incumbents, no shoo-ins.
Every registered student is eligible
to run.
If you have any questions
about your Senate, your
constitution, student involvement
and representation on University
and trustee committees, or
whatever, feel free to drop by the
Senate office located in the ASSU
offices on the second floor of
Tresidder Union and we'll try to
help. Or call us at 497-4331
between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. daily.
With your support we will elect
a strong, responsive and
representative Senate this year.
If you choose not to run, still
utilize your vote. Don't allow the
ASSU to represent a handful of
people, make us represent all of
you.
The ASSU needs you!
(Reginald Turner was chairman of
the Associated Students of
Stanford University Senate for
1973-74.)
