# The 						Death Knell For Fraternities?

Disclaimers from Larry
Horton's committee to the
contrary, we can sound the knell
for fraternities as we now know
them on the Stanford campus if
modifications detailed in the Sept.
23 Daily are adopted.
The associate dean of student
affairs has put together an
advisory group to study
amendments to the system after
University legal counsel advised
him that under Title IX of the
federal Educational Amendments
Act of 1972 extension of housing
privileges to only one sex is
discriminatory.
Privilege, in the case of the 540
undergraduate men in fraternities,
involves three instances of special
treatment, the housing office tells
us: the men are guaranteed
continuous residence throughout
their undergraduate years (while
878 of 3676 in the draw system
were unassigned last spring), the
frats are allowed to select
members subjectively through
rush rather than objectively
through lottery and the frat
members are not obligated to
year-long contracts with the
residence system, as are other
students.
Accusations of discrimination
at Stanford arose when members
of coed fraternity Alpha Sig
asked, and were denied,
exemption from the draw last
spring. The University
ombudsman and associate dean
for women got into the act, and
Horton now fears that a suit will
be filed under the federal statutes
unless something is done.
Stanford Different
Several factors differentiate
Stanford from other campuses
which offer Greek living. First,
fraternities here are located on
University property, or "prime
University land" as Horton calls
it. At many campuses, the houses
are off campus and therefore not
subject to federal meddling into
educational institutions.
(Obviously, with Stanford's
relative isolation from the
surrounding community, such
off-campus locations are
extremely undesirable here).
Second, Stanford has a most
nagging housing shortage. To
those in the draw, loss of an
on-campus living spot is an annual
peril.
Finally, there lies the real root

of the discrimination problem
here. In an act of parietal wisdom
in 1944, the University banned
sororities from this campus,
convinced by the notion that
women were not sufficiently
stable to handle the social
dichotomy resulting from Greek
life.
Stanford At Fault
The crux of the problem,
therefore, is the University's
discriminatory policies, not those
of fraternities. But to solve its
self-induced dilemma, Stanford is
planning to dismantle some
cornerstones of the frats.
There is a distinction between
a fraternity and a University-run
residence; from this distinction
arise privileges. The difference is
financial autonomy. Only two
Stanford fraternity houses are
self-owned; the University helped
build or remodel the remainder.
But all pay rent under leases with
Stanford.
If the same concept of
property is to be applied to these
autonomous houses as is to those
of faculty and staff on University
land, then the frats must be
allowed the same amount of
discretion over use of the
structures as are faculty (i.e.,
virtually complete). To do
otherwise is to risk another
lawsuit.
Who Will Control?
But under a plan gaining favor
from Horton's committee, the
University would assume a control
over fraternities akin to that it
now holds over â–  independent
houses. Frat members, with
considerable financial investment
in a house, would be subject to
ouster by the draw. "Rushees"
would be admitted to a house, if
they avoid the draw cut-off,
according to the house's priority
list of applicants determined "by
objective criterion."
The University also would
determine the exact number of
boarders to be allowed in the
house, to prevent the frat from
overcrowding the house with
members ousted in the draw.
Such restrictions are in
violation of the University's
long-standing commitment to
fraternities, and disruptive of the
members' commitments to their
houses. Some members of
Horton's group have argued that a
fraternity is more than simply a

house. For undergraduates, it
rarely is.
If, then, we are to maintain
fraternity life under the status
quo at Stanford (which, according
to rush figures, is beocme a more
popular alternative), then what
are we to do about
discrimination?
Simple. - End the University's
part in it. Allow all houses wishing
to establish financial
independence to withdraw from
the housing lottery. Make those
which do, pay rent to the
University. Independent houses in
the draw presently meet these
criteria.
Such a set-up could include
even dormitories, if the residents
desire, as these are conceptually
no different from other living
groups. Any group establishing
independence for such a facility,
of course, would have to assume
any debt payments outstanding.
Same Restrictions
Independent houses would be
allowed subjective selection of
their members, under only those
restrictions now applied to
fraternities (e.g., no racial
criterion). Thus, any sororities
wishing establishment of a house
might do so, provided they are
able to rent one of the current

structures on campus.
How might the houses be
alloted to competing groups? By
bid, except for living groups
currently in a house which wish to
remain in that house under
independence.
Presumably, many structures
would not be made independent
of the housing system. These
would remain for incoming
freshmen and for those students
not wishing life in an autonomous
house.
Members of Horton's
committee have dismissed
extending the privilege of
independence to other houses,
rather than destroying that held
by fraternities. They claim further
division of the community is
"socially unacceptable."
Let's face facts. Stanford
students are an elite, drawing envy
from those who cannot attend.
Within Stanford, there are those
who have earned an additional
privilege: life in an independent
house. And they are envied. Now
their privileges are to be taken
from them in the name of
"fairness."
