## Volunteers Tape Texts For Blind 
### DAN BRENNER 
Just off the corner of El Camino Real and Charleston
Boulevard near Rickey's Hyatt House stands a
diminutive, hacienda-style abode possessing an
inordinately large, number of parking spaces off its garden.
Day and night, five days a week housewives, professors,
lawyers and others park in those spaces, stay in the house
for two hours, and depart a bit exhausted but gratified.
Could this house be a low-ball poker parlor disguised as
a suburban residence? A rendezvous spot for a Peninsula
numbers operation? A massage studio in mufti?
Actually, this busy little domicile is the home of the
Palo Alto chapter of Recording for the Blind (RFB), a
national volunteer-centered service organization supplying
free recorded textbooks to over 5000 high school students
and over 4000 undergraduate and graduate students
nationwide.
The local chapter, which has about 150 volunteers who
travel from as far as San Jose and Berkeley, is one of 28

facilities through the U.S. providing recording services for
students who otherwise might be unable to attend college
or graduate school. Of the estimated 3000-plus blind
students enrolled in American colleges, RFB serves
virtually 100 percent.
Charlotte Truitt, assistant to the director of the Palo
Alto chapter, notes that many of the texts requested by
blind students are the same as those found on reading lists
at Stanford and other campuses.
"We're asked to record a wide range of texts in
specialized fields, not recreational reading," she says.
For example, among the books currently in the works
are such non-best sellers as Fundamentals of Management
Accounting, China's Developmental Experiences, Antitrust
Analysis, and the never-to-be-forgotten Deutsch Fur
Amerikaner. Since these kinds of texts will never be set in
Braille, a blind college student must rely on RFB to record
the texts.
All tapes of books recorded at the Palo Alto studio are

sent to RFB headquarters in New York to be dubbed onto
master tapes and stored for use until requested by a
student.
There are about 25,000 titles now available in RFB's
master tape library, ranging from introductory texts to
advanced material of use to doctoral candidates. Last year,
the local chapter completed over 350 tapes.
At Stanford, two blind students are currently being
served with materials from RFB. In the past seven years,
several blind Stanford students received undergraduate and
graduate degrees through the assistance of RFB.
Technical Readers
One major problem for blind students, Truitt notes, is
the lack of competent technical readers for textbooks in
engineering, computer science, chemistry, mathematics,
law and physics. Many of RFB's volunteers do not possess
the expertise to read the complicated formulae and
symbols which are the trademark of advanced scientific
texts, and unfortunately, too few of those who could do
the reading volunteer.
Steve Diamond, a fourth-year chemistry grad student, is
one of few Stanford students and faculty who presently
volunteer for RFB. "The time they ask of volunteers is so
little(lV2 to 2 hours a week) and since I hadn't done any
volunteer work like it before, 1 thought I'd give it a try."
Another RFB volunteer is Math Prof. Paul Berg. "It
seemed to me that it was so needed, and I had the special
skills in knowing how to read scientific texts. It's a very
gratifying activity," he says.
Elementary Knowledge
Berg adds that an ability to read technical material does
not require an ability to understand it. In fact, any
undergraduate who knows algebra, introductory chemistry
or physics could be a technical reader.
"It's easy for RFB to get housewives who can read
non-technical matter. It's more difficult to get readers who
can handle the college-level material," Berg commented.
Qualifying to become a reader is simple. Volunteers are
asked to read a representative passage from material in
their area of specialization. A tape of their reading is sent
to the New York headquarters, and two weeks later the
successful volunteer is notified. Recording is done in
teams, one reader, one monitor.
Lyn Taylor, a third-year chem grad student who
recently applied to RFB, expects to monitor technical
textbooks as well as read them. This way, the blind
student listening to the material will have a double check
on the reader's recital of those intricate complex equations
and sprawling covalent bond diagrams. Taylor adds that
the flexible hours which can be arranged with the chapter
will permit her to work in her reading as time permits.

RECORDING SESSION—Two volunteers record and monitor texts at the local chapter of Recording For The Blind, a
national organization which specializes in recording technical works for scholars. The local chapter is presently in need
of volunteers capable of reading texts in chemistry, physics, mathmatics and other subjects requiring a knowledge of
unusual vocabulary and symbols.
