If a student's room docs not have any hind of overhead light is the
University under obligation to provide the student with a free lamp?
—L.L.B.
Good news for you unenlightened people. The University will
provide you with a lamp if you're out in the dark or so says Rich
Richardson, plant manager of residences. Just call him at 497-3293
and tell him your problem.
Richardson said that when Clusters I and II (where most of the
lightless rooms are) were originally built, one room of the two-room
doubles was meant for studying and the other for sleeping. The
fraternities paid for some of the furniture like lamps, for instance.
Well, as the frat men left for vacation, so did the room accessories.
Richardson explained that the University had started to put
overhead lights in some of the cluster houses such as Kappa Alpha,
Zeta Psi and Alpha Delta Phi fraternities during the summer. One
particular piece of equipment has become unavailable; therefore, not
all of the houses have had overhead lights installed. While you wait,
contact Richardson.
Why do students have to pay a fee assessment? What's it for? What if
you refuse to pay it? How can you get your money back? —W.E.M.
Signing away over $1000 with a single sweep of the hand during
registration is rather appalling. No wonder you want to get back what
ever you can.
The ASSU sweeps up $7 in fee assessments for student body
activities from the hapless student who has just finished paying up for
tuition and usually room and board.
According to the ASSU Office, the student body votes on having
itself assessed each spring or at a special election. If the majority
wants to have itself assessed for a particular activity, the fee is
automatically collected at registration. A student wanting the money
refunded can go to the ASSU Office in Tresidder from 12 p.m. to 4
p.m. during the third and fourth weeks of the quarter and get it back.
Organizations receiving $1 per student are ASSU Guest
Professorship, ASSU Legal Counseling Office, ASSU Programs — an
aggregate of approximately 20 student groups which gets a percentage
of the assessment — ASSU Speakers Bureau, KZSU, Public Interest
Research Group (PIRG) and the Stanford Band.
