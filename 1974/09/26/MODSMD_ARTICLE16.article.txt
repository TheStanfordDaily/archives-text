# 93 Percent Placement
## GSB Grads Successful In Job Search 
### ROGER THOMPSON 
The June graduates of the
Graduate School of Business
(GSB) were very successful in
their job searches this year,
despite growing unemployment
lines around the nation. The 1974
M.B.A. Employment Survey
conducted by the school's
Placement Office was returned by
70 percent of the class. About 93
percent of those returning surveys
had landed jobs.
The world of finance attracted
36 percent of the 1971 graduates.
This percentage, consistent with
the past, reflects the curriculum
and focus of the school.
According to Carol Marchick,
assistant dean for placement, the
new graduates still went into
finance in these economically
troubled times, but hedged against
future uncertainty by going with
large banking concerns instead of
specialized investment companies.
Of the large number of
graduates that went into finance,
over a third were drawn by the
magnet of New York's Wall Street
and the international finance
scene. According to Marchick,
money has become less of a
motiviating factor in job decisions
as lifestyle considerations gain
importance.
She said the slight increase of
graduates going to New York
doesn't necessarily reflect a trend
back to big money motivations.
New York remains one of the best
places to get a good, fast start in
the financial world, she said.
About 13 percent of the

people returning the survey went
to New York for their first job
but half remained in California.
About 36 percent settled in
Northern California and 11
percent went to Southern
California.
Job Offers
Last year's graduates received
an average of three job offers
each, compared with two in 1972.
This may seem ironic in light of
the economic picture today, but

Marchick observed that students
seemed to be preparing themselves
better and concentrated more for
their job interviews. In addition,
she said, the world of business is
experiencing difficult times but
companies feel they still need the
talents an M.B.A. can offer them
in planning and restructuring for
the future.
Last year's class had 20 people
who concentrated in public

management. These graduates
were hired by federal and state
governments, consulting firms and
semi-public organizations.
According to John H. Steinhart,
director of administration for the
public management program,
there is a high demand by the
federal government and consulting
firms for public management
specialists. He sees this trend
continuing because of increasing
government decentralization and
greater awareness of what services
an M.B.A. recipient can offer.
Money-wise, the 1974
graduates fared quite well.
Depending on such variables as
past work experience, starting
salaries ranged from $10,000 to
$30,000. The average salary plus
compensations $17,628.
Future Recruiting
The survey is used primarily
within the GSB but many
companies use the salary averages
as references in future recruiting
efforts. Marchick also said that
the school's second-year class uses
the surrey to see what paths the
preceding class took in searching
for jobs.
The percentage of graduates
whose first contact with future
employers came through the
Placement Office increased from
44 percent in 1973 to 55 percent
in 1974. Marchick said this rise
reflected the tightening job
market, which made individual
efforts more difficult. The
Placement Office served as liaison
between 204 companies and the
282 graduates of the 1974 class.

whose first contact with future
employers came through the
Placement Office increased from
44 percent in 1973 to 55 percent
in 1974. Marchick said this rise
reflected the tightening job
market, which made individual
efforts more difficult. The
Placement Office served as liaison
between 204 companies and the
282 graduates of the 1974 class.
The June graduates of the
Graduate School of Business
(GSB) were very successful in
their job searches this year,
despite growing unemployment
lines around the nation. The 1974
M.B.A. Employment Survey
conducted by the school's
Placement Office was returned by
70 percent of the class. About 93
percent of those returning surveys
had landed jobs.
The world of finance attracted
36 percent of the 1971 graduates.
This percentage, consistent with
the past, reflects the curriculum
and focus of the school.
According to Carol Marchick,
assistant dean for placement, the
new graduates still went into
finance in these economically
troubled times, but hedged against
future uncertainty by going with
large banking concerns instead of
specialized investment companies.
Of the large number of
graduates that went into finance,
over a third were drawn by the
magnet of New York's Wall Street
and the international finance
scene. According to Marchick,
money has become less of a
motiviating factor in job decisions
as lifestyle considerations gain
importance.
She said the slight increase of
graduates going to New York
doesn't necessarily reflect a trend
back to big money motivations.
New York remains one of the best
places to get a good, fast start in
the financial world, she said.
About 13 percent of the

people returning the survey went
to New York for their first job
but half remained in California.
About 36 percent settled in
Northern California and 11
percent went to Southern
California.
Job Offers
Last year's graduates received
an average of three job offers
each, compared with two in 1972.
This may seem ironic in light of
the economic picture today, but

Marchick observed that students
seemed to be preparing themselves
better and concentrated more for
their job interviews. In addition,
she said, the world of business is
experiencing difficult times but
companies feel they still need the
talents an M.B.A. can offer them
in planning and restructuring for
the future.
Last year's class had 20 people
who concentrated in public

management. These graduates
were hired by federal and state
governments, consulting firms and
semi-public organizations.
According to John H. Steinhart,
director of administration for the
public management program,
there is a high demand by the
federal government and consulting
firms for public management
specialists. He sees this trend
continuing because of increasing
government decentralization and
greater awareness of what services
an M.B.A. recipient can offer.
Money-wise, the 1974
graduates fared quite well.
Depending on such variables as
past work experience, starting
salaries ranged from $10,000 to
$30,000. The average salary plus
compensations $17,628.
Future Recruiting
The survey is used primarily
within the GSB but many
companies use the salary averages
as references in future recruiting
efforts. Marchick also said that
the school's second-year class uses
the surrey to see what paths the
preceding class took in searching
for jobs.
