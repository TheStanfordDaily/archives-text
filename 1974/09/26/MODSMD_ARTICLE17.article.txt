# Lasers Join Struggle Against Eye Disease

### 
NEW YORK (AP) - A
phenomenon central to the study
of galaxies millions of light years
away is being used for the first
time to examine the flow of blood
in the retina of the human eye
and could have a major effect on
research on a host of ills.
The technique involves shining
a weak laser beam into the eye
and detecting the change in
frequency produced when the
highly condensed beam hits the
moving particles in the blood.
Measurement of this effect, the
Doppler effect, provides
information on blood flow speed
and circulation time in the human
retina.
The unusual work with the eye
is described as a major new field
of eye research that could affect
diseases of the retina and even

other ills, such as heart disease
and diabetes.
The work is being done at the
Retina Foundation in Boston. A
private organization, Research to
Prevent Blindness, announced on
Wednesday a $25,000 grant to Dr.
Isaac Ben-Sira, associate scientist
at the foundation, to support the
work.
The money represents the first
payment of a $75,000 pledge for
young scientists made to Research
to Prevent Blindness by William
Friedkin, director of The
Exorcist.
An understanding of how the
retina is nourished by blood is
considered of great importance
since ocular circulation plays a
major role in degeneration in the
retina, which impairs the sight of
millions of Americans.
