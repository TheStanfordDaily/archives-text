# Escondido Freeze Over; Transfer Policy Settled
## 
### CECILE HEROLD 
A freeze imposed last June on
transfers of childless couples from
one-bedroom high-rise apartments to
two-bedroom low-rise apartments in
Escondido Village has been removed,
according to Student Housing Manager
Alan Cummings.
The freeze was imposed pending
approval of an eligibility report
intended "to make clear who would be
eligible for transfers [and] when,"
Cummings said.
Under the new policy published last
August, all Escondido residents may
transfer to a larger apartment if no
students or postdoctoral fellows with
children are on the waiting list.
All but one of the 35 Escondido
couples whose transfer requests were
refused when the freeze was in effect
have been placed in the larger
apartments, Cummings said. "The
remaining couple seems to have
requested transfer to a special area of
Escondido," he explained.
Availability Extended
Besides outlining the new transfer
rules, the eligibility policy extends
residence availability to postdoctoral
fellows. Lincoln Moses, dean of the
Graduate Division, defines this
standing as "the newly minted Ph.D.
who takes a one- or two-year research
appointment or postdoctoral
fellowship to further his training."
Because the fellow is like an
advanced graduate student, he should
be accorded some degree of student
status, including housing in Escondido
Village, Moses reasoned. However,
housing priority will still be given to
graduate and undergraduate students.
The Housing Offick will now rent
the larger apartments to married
students and postdoctoral fellows
first, then to married students without
children and single students, and
finally to postdoctoral fellows without

children. Thus, married students may
have to wait ionger than expected for
their transfers because postdoctoral
fellows with children have priority
before them for the larger apartments.
Sporadic Applications
"So far," Cummings said, "the
postdoctorate response has not been
overwhelming. However, the
postdoctoral fellow can begin his work
at any time during the year, not just in
September. Applications are expected
a bit at a time."
Meanwhile, autumn quarter's
waiting list for married couples
without children has swelled to 65.
The housing office estimated the
number of single undergraduate
students on the waiting list at 200.
Because the list includes students
waiting for any kind of housing in the
area, names are constantly being added
or dropped from the list.
The shortest Escondido waiting list
is comprised of married students with
children. "The number of these
students dropped 25 percent from
1968 to 1973," Cummings explained.
"Previously, young marrieds with
children had an 11- to 18-month
waiting period and we built new
apartments in response to that earlier
demand."
Rent Rates
According to Cummings, rents at
Escondido run from $147 monthly for
one-bedroom apartments to $189 for
three-bedroom units. Rents for
non-students are slightly higher
because they cannot be listed as tax
exemptions by the Housing Office.
Cummings, manager of Escondido
Village since last September, serves as
a kind of counterpart to Larry Horton,
associate dean of students and director
of student housing programs. "I'm like
the hotel landlord whereas Larry sees
that the residences aren't run like
hotels," he said.

Cummings, manager of Escondido
Village since last September, serves as
a kind of counterpart to Larry Horton,
associate dean of students and director
of student housing programs. "I'm like
the hotel landlord whereas Larry sees
that the residences aren't run like
hotels," he said.
A freeze imposed last June on
transfers of childless couples from
one-bedroom high-rise apartments to
two-bedroom low-rise apartments in
Escondido Village has been removed,
according to Student Housing Manager
Alan Cummings.
The freeze was imposed pending
approval of an eligibility report
intended "to make clear who would be
eligible for transfers [and] when,"
Cummings said.
Under the new policy published last
August, all Escondido residents may
transfer to a larger apartment if no
students or postdoctoral fellows with
children are on the waiting list.
All but one of the 35 Escondido
couples whose transfer requests were
refused when the freeze was in effect
have been placed in the larger
apartments, Cummings said. "The
remaining couple seems to have
requested transfer to a special area of
Escondido," he explained.
Availability Extended
Besides outlining the new transfer
rules, the eligibility policy extends
residence availability to postdoctoral
fellows. Lincoln Moses, dean of the
Graduate Division, defines this
standing as "the newly minted Ph.D.
who takes a one- or two-year research
appointment or postdoctoral
fellowship to further his training."
Because the fellow is like an
advanced graduate student, he should
be accorded some degree of student
status, including housing in Escondido
Village, Moses reasoned. However,
housing priority will still be given to
graduate and undergraduate students.
The Housing Offick will now rent
the larger apartments to married
students and postdoctoral fellows
first, then to married students without
children and single students, and
finally to postdoctoral fellows without

children. Thus, married students may
have to wait ionger than expected for
their transfers because postdoctoral
fellows with children have priority
before them for the larger apartments.
Sporadic Applications
"So far," Cummings said, "the
postdoctorate response has not been
overwhelming. However, the
postdoctoral fellow can begin his work
at any time during the year, not just in
September. Applications are expected
a bit at a time."
Meanwhile, autumn quarter's
waiting list for married couples
without children has swelled to 65.
The housing office estimated the
number of single undergraduate
students on the waiting list at 200.
Because the list includes students
waiting for any kind of housing in the
area, names are constantly being added
or dropped from the list.
The shortest Escondido waiting list
is comprised of married students with
children. "The number of these
students dropped 25 percent from
1968 to 1973," Cummings explained.
"Previously, young marrieds with
children had an 11- to 18-month
waiting period and we built new
apartments in response to that earlier
demand."
Rent Rates
According to Cummings, rents at
Escondido run from $147 monthly for
one-bedroom apartments to $189 for
three-bedroom units. Rents for
non-students are slightly higher
because they cannot be listed as tax
exemptions by the Housing Office.
