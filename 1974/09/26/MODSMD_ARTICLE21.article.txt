Summit May Yield Tax Cuts
WASHINGTON — The direction signs to
President Ford's economic summit this weekend
point to a new program of moderation that may
include some tax cuts for persons with low
incomes.
L. William Siedman, organizer of the sessions,
said such reductions • aimed at easing the
burden of inflation for those in lower brackets
are definitely among the options the new
administration will consider.
Siedman said that among the possibilities for
implementing the specialized cuts would be a
reduced rate of Social Security withholding at
limited income levels.
Otto Eckstein, a Harvard economics
professor and formerly a member of President
Johnson's Council of Economic Advisers, said
tax cuts could be combined with tax incentives
for new investment capital for business.
Aside from the possibility of tax changes,
however, there is little prospect of anything
startingly new in the wake of the economic
summit, which will be held at a Washington
hotel tomorrow and Saturday.
Ford will preside over the sessions both days.
Some top union leaders already are saying
they do not expect anything to come from the
sessions that will help either labor or the
economy.
President George Meany of the AFL-CIO said
in a speech Tuesday, "I never saw an economic
problem yet that could be solved by a locker
room pep talk."
He said he is "sincerely afraid that we are
going down the road to depression right this
minute."
Israeli Jets Raid Lebanon
TEL AVIV — For the second day in a row
Israeli jets streaked into south Lebanon
yesterday, bombing and strafing in pursuit of
Palestinian guerrillas just hours before the fast
of Yom Kippur, the holiest of Jewish holidays.
The raids were reported in Tel Aviv as
designed to break up any attack the Palestinians
may be planning for the holiday and first
anniversary of the outbreak of the 1973 war in
the Mideast.
No one was reported killed by the raids on
either day.
A military spokesman in Tel Aviv was quoted
as saying that the planes struck to keep the
terrorists busy over Yom Kippur, the Jewish
Day of Atonement.
A year ago, during the 20th hour of the

solemn holiday, Egypt and Syria attacked in the
Sinai and the Golan Heights and launched the
fourth Arab-Israeli war in 25 years.
Lebanese witnesses reported plantations were
destroyed and wood set ablaze when a
formation of six jet fighters swept low over
El-Ghor, a village area close to the border with
Israel. The raid lasted 10 minutes.
Throughout Israel religious Jews began a
25-hour dusk-to-dusk fast to observe a day of
penitence dating back to Moses. Traffic stopped,
airports, shops and movie houses closed and
even the nonreligious stayed home and ate
behind closed curtains to avoid offending
religious neighbors.
Court Takes Nixon Resignation
SAN FRANCISCO — The California Supreme
Court yesterday accepted former President
Richard M. Nixon's resignation from the state
bar which was considering disciplinary action
for his Watergate role.
The brief order, signed by Chief Justice
Donald Wright, said:
"The Sept. 16, 1974 voluntary resignation of
Richard M. Nixon as a member of the State Bar
of California is accepted without prejudice to
further proceedings in any disciplinary matter
pending against him before the state bar should
he again seek to become a member thereof."
This means that in the event Nixon should
seek to become a member of the state bar again,
any disciplinary matter pending against him
could be reinstituted.
The President's resignation carne in the form
of a letter dated Sept. 16.
The state bar had voted to recommend to the
California Supreme Court that it reject an earlier
Sept. 11 letter of resignation.
Bar President Brent Able had said the
resolution was adopted because Nixon had
refused to acknowledge he faced possible
disciplinary action by the bar.
But upon the receipt of a subsequent Nixon
letter, in which he made reference to the
investigation pending against him, the bar sent a
letter to the state Supreme Court stating that a
majority of the board of governors had voted
to accept the resignation.
Schlesinger: No War Over Oil
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense
James R. Schlesinger said yesterday he doubts
that any country will go to war over oil despite
the economic problems caused by the high
prices of producer nations.
"It is not anticipated that there is going to be

military conflict," Schlesinger said at his first
Pentagon news conference in three months.
Asked if the United States were making any
military preparations to drive down the price of
oil set by the Persian Gulf nations, he said, "We
are not contemplating any kind of planning of
that sort."
Schlesinger seemed somewhat at odds with a
tougher line toward the Arab states and
Venezuela taken by both President Ford and
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger on
Tuesday.
At the Ninth World Energy Conference in
Detroit, Ford said that while the oil-producing
countries have every right to manage their own
economies, "exorbitant prices can only distort
the world economy, run the risk of-a worldwide
depression and threaten the breakdown of world
order and safety."
At the United Nations, Kissinger noted that
the United States has provided economic
programs to Middle Eastern nations in an effort
to help them diversify their oil economies.
But he said, "What has gone up by political
decision can be reduced by political decision."
Nelson A. Rockefeller, who yesterday
completed three days of testimony before the
Senate Rules and Administration Committee,
said he believes President Ford and Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger have recognized that
inflation will be almost impossible to control if
oil producing nations continue to raise their
prices.
Asked to comment on rumors that Kissinger
may leave the government, Rockefeller said, "I
just cannot believe we would be shortsighted
enough to lose this man's talent at this moment
in history.
Storm Victims Fight For Food
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — Starving
Hondurans fought over food dropped yesterday
by helicopters flying above their hurricane
stricken towns and villages.
"Food remains our biggest problem,"
declared the country's relief coordinator just
one week after Hurricane Fifi struck.
The estimate of hurricane dead by officials
here remained between 7,500 and 8.000, but at
the United Nations in New York the Honduran
foreign minister, Cesar A. Batres, pegged the toll
at about 10,000 and said damages reached more
than $1 billion.
Both he and Tegucigalpa officials said
100,000 or more were homeless and untold
thousands of others were without food.
Volunteers, guided by hunting dogs, searched

for more corpses hidden in thick gray mud of
the worst disaster in Honduran history.
Turkey Rebuffs House Vole
ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey yesterday
rebuffed the U.S. House vote to cut off military
aid, saying its army can hold its own without
American help.
Defense Minister Hasan Isik said, "Even if
nobody gives us aid, we are determined to
continue in the direction we see as right" on the
Cyprus question.
Isik said the congressional vote Tuesday was
illogical since Turkish military power also
strengthened the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
"If military aid to Turkey were suspended, it
would affect the whole of the NATO alliance,
not just Turkey," Isik said.
"If Turkey cannot use arms received within
the framework of the alliance, even for a just
cause, this nation could question the usefulness
of the armed might provided by the alliance,"
he said.
Backers of the House bill said American arms
made up 80 to 90 percent of the weapons used
in the Turkish invasion on Cyprus July 20.
Cannery Workers Sue Teamsters
SAN FRANCISCO — Alleging racial and sex
discrimination, nine Mexican American and
women cannery workers filed a total $4 million
in damage suits yesterday against two cannery
Jjrms and Teamsters Union organizations.
Three workers filed a federal suit against
Tillie Lewis Foods Inc., of Stockton and
Antioch and Teamsters Local 678 of Antioch
and Local 601 of Stockton.
Six other workers filed a similar suit in U.S.
District Court against Hickmott Foods of
Antioch and Teamsters Local 688. Also named
as defendants in both suits were the Teamsters
council of Cannery and Food Processing Unions
and the Western Conference of Teamsters.
Both suits allege unlawful discrimination
because of race, color, religion, sex or national
origin. The workers contend they were denied
promotions, preferred jobs, training
opportunities and seniority.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except coastal low
clouds extending inland nights and mornings.
Little temperature change. Lows tonight in the
50s. Highs today and tomorrow in the low 60s
near the coast and the 70s inland.
