# Recovery May Be Slow
## Clot Imperils Nixon's Health 
### 
LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) - A
potentially dangerous, dimesize blood
clot has been discovered in Richard M.
Nixon's right lung, * his doctor
announced yesterday.
A hospital spokesman said the clot
could have proved fatal if it had
lodged in the heart on its way to the
lung.
The spokesman said the clot passed
through a chamber of the former
president's heart into the lung without
causing a potentially fatal blockage of
the blood flow.
Dr. John C. Lungren, who has been
treating Nixon, said his patient "has a
hell of a will to live" and "there is a
very good chance of recovery, but it
will take some time."
No Nixon Testimony?
Lungren made his announcement at
Memorial Hospital Medical Center of
Long Beach, where Nixon, 61, has
been hospitalized since Monday for
extensive treatment and tests. He was
originally scheduled to stay only seven
days.
There was no indication from
Lungren whether the clot could keep
Nixon from testifying at the Watergate
cover-up trial, lt begins next Tuesday.
The former president has been
subpoenaed as a witness by both
defendant John Ehrlichman and
prosecutor Leon Jaworski. Jaworski
has asked U.S. District Court Judge
John J. Sirica to send an independent

medical team to determine if Nixon
can testify or give a deposition.
Potentially Dangerous
The clot lodged in the lung after
breaking off from a vein in Nixon's
left leg, where it had been created by
chronic phlebitis, Lungren said. He
described it as a "potentially
dangerous situation but not critical at
this time."
Asked if the gelatin-like clot could
endanger Nixon's life, Lungren said
only that the present risk is a
larger clot could form in the lung.
Lungren was not clear about the
possibility of a second lung clot,
saying only, "The primary risk is the
breaking off of a larger clot which
could cause more damage to the lung
and a real danger."
Second Clot
It was thought that Lungren was
referring to a breaking off of the
second clot in Nixon's leg, but a
hospital spokesman said the doctor
told him that Nixon may not have any
more clots in his leg and that hospital
diagnostic tests had ruled out the
possibility of a second clot ever
existing.
Lungren said the clot, which moved
through blood vessels to the middle of
the right lung, was found through tests
conducted by a specialist in nuclear
medicine.
He said he did not know why the
clot broke off from inside Nixon's left
leg.
Treatment Continued
No surgery is contemplated, he
said, but Nixon is continuing
anticoagulant treatment to dissolve the
clot and prevent a new one from
forming. He will remain hospitalized
through next week.
Nixon is taking two anticoagulants,
Coumadin orally and Heparin
intravenously. If the drugs are
effective, the clot probably will go
away.

But a knowledgeable Washington,
D.C., doctor said, "Even though this
clot doesn't seem to be severe, it
doesn't mean it couldn't get worse. If
a chunk of another clot broke off and
got to the lungs. .. that might be it."
If Nixon's condition worsened,
doctors also might consider surgery,
including emergency surgery in a
severe case to enter the lung.
Nixon has no chest pain, but the
lung clot is contributing to the
extreme fatigue of the former
president, Lungren said.
