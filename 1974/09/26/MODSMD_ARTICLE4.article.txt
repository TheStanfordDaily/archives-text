# Campus Health And Safety Panel Mulls Paramedic Unit Proposal
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The director of emergency services at Stanford Hospital
has asked the University to establish a paramedic unit
within the first department to improve emergency care
delivery on campus.
Emergency Services Director Dr. Michael Eliastam said
yesterday that the unit could cost as little as $20,000 or as
much as $50,000, depending on whether the University
purchased a new emergency vehicle or hired additional
personnel.
The University Panel on Health and Safety will consider
Eliastam's proposal at the request of Accounting Office
Director Franklin Riddle, whom Eliastam had contacted
originally. The panel has student, faculty and
administration members and is chaired by Dr. James B.
McClenahan, director of the student health service.
McClenahan said the panel must "make sure that the
benefits derived from the unit are worth the money spent,"
adding that he will meet with Eliastam today to obtain
further information about the proposal. Eliastam expects
the full panel to consider his plan some time next month.
Training Program
The Medical Center here opened a paramedic training
program for 22 Peninsula firemen here on Sept. 3. Under
the auspices of the program, Medical School faculty will
train the firemen in special emergency medical procedures.
Participating in the training program are 12 firemen

from Palo Alto and 10 from South San Francisco, as well as
six employees of the San Jose Ambulance Co.
To date, the only other northern California city with
trained paramedics ready for field servicers Campbell.
Eliastam said that the Campbell paramedics are supervised
by radio from the Stanford Hospital Emergency Room,
although their patients are transported to other, closer
hospitals for fuller treatment.
Paramedic Service
When paramedic training here is completed in January,
the Palo Alto firemen who participated will provide service
to the campus and Barron Park, as well as Palo Alto.
However, Eliastam believes that they will soon become
overloaded with calls from Palo Alto alone and will be
unable to provide adequate service here on campus.
"Therefore," Eliastam said, "Stanford should eventually
have its own system."
Once on duty, the paramedics will treat patients on the
scene while keeping in contact by radio with a physician or
nurse here at the Medical Center. Switchboard operators at
police and fire stations will summon the paramedics when
they are needed.
When the Palo Alto City Council approved the project
for its own fire department this summer, it also set a flat
$40 fee for each patient whom the paramedic unit serves.
The Council imposed the fee to reduce what it termed
"frivolous" or unnecessary calls.
