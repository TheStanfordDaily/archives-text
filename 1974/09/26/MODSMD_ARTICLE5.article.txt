# Judge Overturns Calley Conviction

### 
COLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) - A federal
judge overturned the My Lai murder
conviction of former Army Lt. William
L. Calley yesterday, but the Army
announced it would appeal and Calley
would not be immediately released.
U.S. District Court Judge J. Robert
Elliott cited "unrestrained and
uncontrolled" pretrial news coverage
in his opinion and compared Calley's
difficulties in obtaining government
evidence to the Watergate tapes case.
Elliott ordered that Calley be
immediately freed, but the Army said
in Washington that it would
recommend a Justice Department
appeal of Elliott's decision.
It said Calley "will not be released
from confinement pending a decision
on these recommendations."
Army Recommendations
The Army statement also said it
will recommend that the Justice
Department move for a stay of
Elliott's order.
The Justice Department acts for the
Army in cases before federal civil
courts. If an appeal is made, it
probably will be taken to the U.S. sth
Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans.
Judge Elliott devoted 85 of the 132
pages in his opinion to a
demonstration of how he felt Calley's
constitutional rights to a fair trial had
been ruined by incessant portrayals of
Calley ranging from "a mass murderer
to a ghoul" by the American press.
'Prejudicial Publicity'
"If there has ever been a case in
which a conviction should be set aside
because of prejudicial publicity, this is
it," Elliott wrote.
"Never in the history of the
military justice system and perhaps in
the history of American courts," the

opinion said, "has any accused
encountered such intense and
continuous prejudicial publicity as did
the petitioner Calley."
That, Elliott wrote, led him to the
"inescapable conclusion that the
petitioner was denied a fair trial as
required by our nation's
Constitution."
Elliott also contended Calley was
unable to prepare adequately for his
defense because the charges against
him were fmproperly drawn.
Elliott's opinion also contended
that when the U.S. Supreme Court
ordered former President Nixon to
produce certain Watergate tapes, "that
move decided the Calley case."
He said the high court's ruling
broke the privileged barriers erected
under the separation of powers
doctrine.
During Calley's court martial, Rep.
F. Edward Hebert, (D-LA.), chairman
of a House subcommittee investigating
My Lai, refused to funiish Calley's
lawyers with transcripts by Army
commanders relating to the massacre
and cover-up.
Request Refused
Hebert refused on the basis of
congressional independence from the
judiciary, despite a request for the
testimony from the presiding military
judge, Col. Reid Kennedy.
"If we substitute the word
'legislative' for the word 'presidential'
or 'executive' we see that the Supreme
Court in deciding the Nixon case also
decided the Calley case," Elliott's
opinion stated.
Judge Elliott's other key
contentions were that Calley was
denied the right of confrontation with
witnesses when the military judge
refused to subpoena high-ranking
Army officials and that Calley was
convicted on charges and
specifications "improperly drawn."
Murder Conviction
Calley, 31, was convicted 3'/2 years
ago for the murders of 22 Vietnamese
civilians at My Lai. He was sentenced
to life imprisonment but that sentence
was reduced by military review to 10
years.
Calley has been confined to the
disciplinary barracks at Ft.
Leavenworth, Kan., since Elliott took
his appeal under advisement June 25.
J. Houston Gordon, Calley's chief
attorney, said he thinks President
Gerald Ford will decide whether to
press the appeal.
Gordon said the Army should now
"stop persecuting him" and drop the
appeal in light of recent concessions
allowed draft evaders and of the
presidential pardon of Nixon.
