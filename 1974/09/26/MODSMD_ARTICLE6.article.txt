# Financial Situation A Question
## 'Live Oak' To Begin Publication Tomorrow 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Live Oak, a weekly student newspaper, will
publish its first issue tomorrow under the direction
of Founder-Editor-Business Manager Bill Weinstein.
Managing Editor Jan Agosti yesterday described
the new publication as "a weekly tabloid with
emphasis on local and campus affairs." Live Oak
will also offer "extensive" entertainment coverage
and a monthly calendar "attempting to digest all
local activities," she said.
Weinstein was unavailable for comment
yesterday. During the past year he persuaded
University officials, the ASSU Publications Board
and the ASSU Council of Presidents to give Live
Oak financial assistance and office space.
However, ASSU Financial Manager Frank Olivieri
questioned the financial viability of Live Oak.
"[Live Oak] will do a fantastic amount of
advertising, but the problem is collection," he said.
Money For Three Issues
Olivieri, who must approve all financial
transactions of Live Oak as stipulated by the Pub
Board, said the newspaper has enough money for
only three issues.
"If it takes advertisers 60 days to pay their bills —
the average amount of time—then Live Oak will go
out of business," Olivieri said.
As of yesterday, the ASSU financial office had
not received any of Live Oak's advertising revenues.
The Live Oak staff disagrees with Olivieri. Agosti
said, "As far as finances are concerned, we are in
'Fat City.' The question is resolved by simply
picking up the paper and looking at it."
'Peaceful Coexistence'
Agosti hopes for "peaceful coexistence" with
the Daily. But observers have expressed doubt that

Palo Alto's "economic base" can adequately
support two student publications with
advertisements. Dale Snape, assistant dean of
students, said, "The Daily exists primarily on ad

revenue with a yearly budget of $130,000. There is
a risk that more advertisements for Live Oak will
not come about."
However, Daily advertising manager Lee Hanley
said that Live Oak, even with its lower advertising
rates, does not pose a problem. "Live Oak's rates are
noticeably lower than ours, but I'm sure our
established advertisers will continue with us," he
said.
Decision Reversed
At one time, the University had allowed Live
Oak to solicit grants from outside sources who
would donate money to Stanford as a restricted gift
for Life Oak's use. That decision was later reversed.
Despite fears of adverse competition with the
Daily for advertising revenues and the absence of
support from outside sources, Snape is optimistic
about Live Oak's future. "I have great hopes for
Live Oak," he said. "Perhaps it can spur itself and
the Daily to new journalistic heights.
"Competition is a good idea in this regard and
there are enough people and issues to carry that
through," he continued.
Pub Board Promise
The ASSU Publications Board promised Live Oak
$1500 if Weinstein could collect $8500 in revenue.
He could not raise the money, so the allocation is
"encumbered" and will not be spent.
ASSU President Mike Herman granted Live Oak
office space in Tresidder Union until Oct. 1. The
Pub Board will decide if the paper can occupy space
in the Storke Publications Building after that date,
according to Board Chairman Rich Jaroslovsky.
A Pub Board source said that Live Oak will be
temporarily housed near the Cluster I fraternity
library until the Pub Board decision.


SAY CHEESE—Why is this lithesome young coed
smiling? It could be she ate some wild hickory nuts
with Euell Gibbons. Or maybe she ate a copy of the
new publication 'Live Oak,' scheduled to make an
appearance on campus today. Rumor has it they
don't taste any better than Dailies.
