# On Insecurity

A checking account does not
make a man rich. I thought
otherwise when I was younger.
This was my first lesson in
economics. I had observed my
parents and other adults exchange
unremarkable, and apparently
bountiful, blue sheets of paper for
every imaginable commodity and
service. So it was not without a
certain condescension and
youthful naivete that I shook my
head in disbelief as those
merchants and servicemen
exchanged their essential and
highly desirable items for paper.
Paper was cheap, I thought; and
I had just learned to write my
name with some distinction.
Truly, the marketplace contained
suckers to be licked, and great
wealth was but a checkbook
away. Luckily I acquired
knowledge about the credit
system before my first
checkbook, or I might be writing
this now from a debtor's prison.
My misunderstanding of the
credit system was more the result
of a moral deficit than of an
intellectual one. I wanted
something for nothing. The fact
that I was not clever enough to
achieve this goal — the intellectual
aspect — is a point of only
secondary and personal interest.
The more relevant fact is that I
was trying to beat the system in a
less than forthright manner. In
more recent times I have not
abandoned my admittedly
quixotic efforts to beat the
system, although I now sincerely
hope that my method does not so
closely approximate larceny.
Furthermore, my pursuit of this
economic fantasy has led me to
what I like to call my second
lesson in economics, which is —
indisputably — the system is
beating me.
What Is Inflation?
"Inflation" is a word much
talked about and little
understood. I do not understand
it. So by using this word, I do not
wish to communicate precisely or
to raise the general level of
dialogue concerning this topic.
Instead, I will be pleased if the
word elicits in my readers a gut
feeling of outrage, resentment or
self-pity, or revivifies a more
specific memory of a large grocery
bill, a raised rent or a higher
tuition. Any of the foregoing will
serve my purpose nicely.
Personally, I like to clothe the
term in metaphor — as did
President Ford, recently — and
think of inflation as an arch-villain
and multi-purpose bad guy; but it
is not necessary to go to these
lengths to appreciate what
follows.
It is unfortunate that students
do not get paid, for at times they
work very hard. But their day to
day endeavors are not
remunerated financially, and their
general support must be
maintained by philanthropic sorts,
primarily their parents and the
state. Since I, as a student, have
essentially no income, one might
rush to the conclusion that I have
found the perfect hedge against
inflation (nothing from nothing is
still, but no less than, nothing),
but this would be wrong. For I do
have certain assets which, until
recently, were in the form of a
savings account. Such a modest
portfolio produces an economic
camaraderie with "fixed income"
types who, though usually older,
apparently were no wiser.
Results Obvious
Now, it takes no master of the
abacus to calculate the net result
for one's savings from a 10
percent inflation rate with only a
5 percent yield on my account. It
is a perfect example of taking one
step forward and finding oneself
two steps behind. Aside from
losing all respect for Harry von

Zell, Eddie Albert and the others
who advertise for savings and
loans, I was swept into a profound
reconsideration of what money
really is. I will share the results of
my investigation with you after
relating two more stories —
relevant, to be sure — from my
childhood.
My brother always tried to
cheat me. He would sell me things
which I did not need and would
try to acquire possession of useful
items which I had. He once
showed me this tiny wooden chest
and pried open the lid just enough
so that I could see what was
inside. Clear as day, there was a
lot of money there. He said, I will
trade you everything in this box
for one dollar.
My greed overcame me, and I
purchased the contents of the box
to discover that the money was of
a bizarre, plastic variety which I
had not seen before. Upon
consulting the resident banker
(my mother), I learned that the
money was "foreign" and could
not be used at the local stores.
Tears of dismay ran down my
cheeks. This money was
worthless. But how, thought my
soggy little brain, can money be
worthless? An antinomy of no
mean proportion.
Economic Insecurity
Sometime thereafter, and no
causal connection is suggested, I
had a spasm of economic
insecurity. So I got a shovel and
one of my father's old cigar
boxes, and went out to my
backyard and proceeded to bury
75 cents. This was not intended as
an investment but rather as a
means of assuring my financial
survival. It did not occur to me
until recently that those 75 cents
would not be quite enough to
wash a car after the proverbial
rainy-day had ended. Nor, I am
sure, did it occur to the German
gentleman whose life insurancy
policy had so depreciated on
account of postwar inflation that
it would not, upon his death, pay
for the postage stamp needed to
send his death certificate to the
insurance company.
Having tolerated the preceding
anecdotes in order to gain
astounding insight into monetary
matters, my reader will
undoubtedly be displeased to
learn the results of my inquiry
into this subject. "Money" is
whatever is accepted consensually
as such. Only this sort of
amorphous, nondefinition of
"money" will be capable of
encompassing the various media
which successfuloy procure goods
and services.
Currency, charge cards,
checking accounts, 1.0.U.s in their
various forms, all at one time or
another do the trick. Moreover,
the story comes to mind of
Picasso's paying his bills by
doodling on the back of the
invoice. Or the indigent's paying
for his meal by washing dishes.
The unitiza t ion and
standardization of a monetary
medium are a universal fact; I do
not believe they are the essential
part of money's nature.
Yet there must be something
more primary underlying a certain
item's competitive success as a
monetary medium — an essence
which makes it acceptable to
would-be sellers. Smiles do not
work. Dollars do. What is the
difference?
I wish to introduce a new term.
The essence referred to above is
what I thought I enclosed in my
father's cigar box. I call it
"value." This is what I hoped to
bury and what inflation manages
to destroy.

money was "foreign" and could
not be used at the local stores.
Tears of dismay ran down my
cheeks. This money was
worthless. But how, thought my
soggy little brain, can money be
worthless? An antinomy of no
mean proportion.
Economic Insecurity
Sometime thereafter, and no
causal connection is suggested, I
had a spasm of economic
insecurity. So I got a shovel and
one of my father's old cigar
boxes, and went out to my
backyard and proceeded to bury
75 cents. This was not intended as
an investment but rather as a
means of assuring my financial
survival. It did not occur to me
until recently that those 75 cents
would not be quite enough to
wash a car after the proverbial
rainy-day had ended. Nor, I am
sure, did it occur to the German
gentleman whose life insurancy
policy had so depreciated on
account of postwar inflation that
it would not, upon his death, pay
for the postage stamp needed to
send his death certificate to the
insurance company.
Having tolerated the preceding
anecdotes in order to gain
astounding insight into monetary
matters, my reader will
undoubtedly be displeased to
learn the results of my inquiry
into this subject. "Money" is
whatever is accepted consensually
as such. Only this sort of
amorphous, nondefinition of
"money" will be capable of
encompassing the various media
which successfuloy procure goods
and services.
Currency, charge cards,
checking accounts, 1.0.U.s in their
various forms, all at one time or
another do the trick. Moreover,
the story comes to mind of
Picasso's paying his bills by
doodling on the back of the
invoice. Or the indigent's paying
for his meal by washing dishes.
The unitiza t ion and
standardization of a monetary
medium are a universal fact; I do
not believe they are the essential
part of money's nature.
Yet there must be something
more primary underlying a certain
item's competitive success as a
monetary medium — an essence
which makes it acceptable to
would-be sellers. Smiles do not
work. Dollars do. What is the
difference?
I wish to introduce a new term.
The essence referred to above is
what I thought I enclosed in my
father's cigar box. I call it
"value." This is what I hoped to
bury and what inflation manages
to destroy.

A checking account does not
make a man rich. I thought
otherwise when I was younger.
This was my first lesson in
economics. I had observed my
parents and other adults exchange
unremarkable, and apparently
bountiful, blue sheets of paper for
every imaginable commodity and
service. So it was not without a
certain condescension and
youthful naivete that I shook my
head in disbelief as those
merchants and servicemen
exchanged their essential and
highly desirable items for paper.
Paper was cheap, I thought; and
I had just learned to write my
name with some distinction.
Truly, the marketplace contained
suckers to be licked, and great
wealth was but a checkbook
away. Luckily I acquired
knowledge about the credit
system before my first
checkbook, or I might be writing
this now from a debtor's prison.
My misunderstanding of the
credit system was more the result
of a moral deficit than of an
intellectual one. I wanted
something for nothing. The fact
that I was not clever enough to
achieve this goal — the intellectual
aspect — is a point of only
secondary and personal interest.
The more relevant fact is that I
was trying to beat the system in a
less than forthright manner. In
more recent times I have not
abandoned my admittedly
quixotic efforts to beat the
system, although I now sincerely
hope that my method does not so
closely approximate larceny.
Furthermore, my pursuit of this
economic fantasy has led me to
what I like to call my second
lesson in economics, which is —
indisputably — the system is
beating me.
What Is Inflation?
"Inflation" is a word much
talked about and little
understood. I do not understand
it. So by using this word, I do not
wish to communicate precisely or
to raise the general level of
dialogue concerning this topic.
Instead, I will be pleased if the
word elicits in my readers a gut
feeling of outrage, resentment or
self-pity, or revivifies a more
specific memory of a large grocery
bill, a raised rent or a higher
tuition. Any of the foregoing will
serve my purpose nicely.
Personally, I like to clothe the
term in metaphor — as did
President Ford, recently — and
think of inflation as an arch-villain
and multi-purpose bad guy; but it
is not necessary to go to these
lengths to appreciate what
follows.
It is unfortunate that students
do not get paid, for at times they
work very hard. But their day to
day endeavors are not
remunerated financially, and their
general support must be
maintained by philanthropic sorts,
primarily their parents and the
state. Since I, as a student, have
essentially no income, one might
rush to the conclusion that I have
found the perfect hedge against
inflation (nothing from nothing is
still, but no less than, nothing),
but this would be wrong. For I do
have certain assets which, until
recently, were in the form of a
savings account. Such a modest
portfolio produces an economic
camaraderie with "fixed income"
types who, though usually older,
apparently were no wiser.
Results Obvious
Now, it takes no master of the
abacus to calculate the net result
for one's savings from a 10
percent inflation rate with only a
5 percent yield on my account. It
is a perfect example of taking one
step forward and finding oneself
two steps behind. Aside from
losing all respect for Harry von

Zell, Eddie Albert and the others
who advertise for savings and
loans, I was swept into a profound
reconsideration of what money
really is. I will share the results of
my investigation with you after
relating two more stories —
relevant, to be sure — from my
childhood.
My brother always tried to
cheat me. He would sell me things
which I did not need and would
try to acquire possession of useful
items which I had. He once
showed me this tiny wooden chest
and pried open the lid just enough
so that I could see what was
inside. Clear as day, there was a
lot of money there. He said, I will
trade you everything in this box
for one dollar.
My greed overcame me, and I
purchased the contents of the box
to discover that the money was of
a bizarre, plastic variety which I
had not seen before. Upon
consulting the resident banker
(my mother), I learned that the
money was "foreign" and could
not be used at the local stores.
Tears of dismay ran down my
cheeks. This money was
worthless. But how, thought my
soggy little brain, can money be

word elicits in my readers a gut
feeling of outrage, resentment or
self-pity, or revivifies a more
specific memory of a large grocery
bill, a raised rent or a higher
tuition. Any of the foregoing will
serve my purpose nicely.
Personally, I like to clothe the
term in metaphor — as did
President Ford, recently — and
think of inflation as an arch-villain
and multi-purpose bad guy; but it
is not necessary to go to these
lengths to appreciate what
follows.
It is unfortunate that students
do not get paid, for at times they
work very hard. But their day to
day endeavors are not
remunerated financially, and their
general support must be
maintained by philanthropic sorts,
primarily their parents and the
state. Since I, as a student, have
essentially no income, one might
rush to the conclusion that I have
found the perfect hedge against
inflation (nothing from nothing is
still, but no less than, nothing),
but this would be wrong. For I do
have certain assets which, until
recently, were in the form of a
savings account. Such a modest
portfolio produces an economic
camaraderie with "fixed income"
types who, though usually older,
apparently were no wiser.
Results Obvious
Now, it takes no master of the
abacus to calculate the net result
for one's savings from a 10
percent inflation rate with only a
5 percent yield on my account. It
is a perfect example of taking one
step forward and finding oneself
two steps behind. Aside from
losing all respect for Harry von

Zell, Eddie Albert and the others
who advertise for savings and
loans, I was swept into a profound
reconsideration of what money
really is. I will share the results of
my investigation with you after
relating two more stories —
relevant, to be sure — from my
childhood.
My brother always tried to
cheat me. He would sell me things
which I did not need and would
try to acquire possession of useful
items which I had. He once
showed me this tiny wooden chest
and pried open the lid just enough
so that I could see what was
inside. Clear as day, there was a
lot of money there. He said, I will
trade you everything in this box
for one dollar.
My greed overcame me, and I
purchased the contents of the box
to discover that the money was of
a bizarre, plastic variety which I
had not seen before. Upon
consulting the resident banker
(my mother), I learned that the
money was "foreign" and could
not be used at the local stores.
Tears of dismay ran down my
cheeks. This money was
worthless. But how, thought my
soggy little brain, can money be
worthless? An antinomy of no
mean proportion.
Economic Insecurity
Sometime thereafter, and no
causal connection is suggested, I
had a spasm of economic
insecurity. So I got a shovel and
one of my father's old cigar
boxes, and went out to my
backyard and proceeded to bury
75 cents. This was not intended as
an investment but rather as a
means of assuring my financial
survival. It did not occur to me
until recently that those 75 cents
would not be quite enough to
wash a car after the proverbial
rainy-day had ended. Nor, I am
sure, did it occur to the German
gentleman whose life insurancy
policy had so depreciated on
account of postwar inflation that
it would not, upon his death, pay
for the postage stamp needed to
send his death certificate to the
insurance company.
Having tolerated the preceding
anecdotes in order to gain
astounding insight into monetary
matters, my reader will
undoubtedly be displeased to
learn the results of my inquiry
into this subject. "Money" is
whatever is accepted consensually
as such. Only this sort of
amorphous, nondefinition of
"money" will be capable of
encompassing the various media
which successfuloy procure goods
and services.
Currency, charge cards,
checking accounts, 1.0.U.s in their
various forms, all at one time or
another do the trick. Moreover,
the story comes to mind of
Picasso's paying his bills by
doodling on the back of the
invoice. Or the indigent's paying
for his meal by washing dishes.
The unitiza t ion and
standardization of a monetary
medium are a universal fact; I do
not believe they are the essential
part of money's nature.
Yet there must be something
more primary underlying a certain
item's competitive success as a
monetary medium — an essence
which makes it acceptable to
would-be sellers. Smiles do not
work. Dollars do. What is the
difference?
I wish to introduce a new term.
The essence referred to above is
what I thought I enclosed in my
father's cigar box. I call it
"value." This is what I hoped to
bury and what inflation manages
to destroy.

A checking account does not
make a man rich. I thought
otherwise when I was younger.
This was my first lesson in
economics. I had observed my
parents and other adults exchange
unremarkable, and apparently
bountiful, blue sheets of paper for
every imaginable commodity and
service. So it was not without a
certain condescension and
youthful naivete that I shook my
head in disbelief as those
merchants and servicemen
exchanged their essential and
highly desirable items for paper.
Paper was cheap, I thought; and
I had just learned to write my
name with some distinction.
Truly, the marketplace contained
suckers to be licked, and great
wealth was but a checkbook
away. Luckily I acquired
knowledge about the credit
system before my first
checkbook, or I might be writing
this now from a debtor's prison.
My misunderstanding of the
credit system was more the result
of a moral deficit than of an
intellectual one. I wanted
something for nothing. The fact
that I was not clever enough to
achieve this goal — the intellectual
aspect — is a point of only
secondary and personal interest.
The more relevant fact is that I
was trying to beat the system in a
less than forthright manner. In
more recent times I have not
abandoned my admittedly
quixotic efforts to beat the
system, although I now sincerely
hope that my method does not so
closely approximate larceny.
Furthermore, my pursuit of this
economic fantasy has led me to
what I like to call my second
lesson in economics, which is —
indisputably — the system is
beating me.

part of money's nature.
Yet there must be something
more primary underlying a certain
item's competitive success as a
monetary medium — an essence
which makes it acceptable to
would-be sellers. Smiles do not
work. Dollars do. What is the
difference?
I wish to introduce a new term.
The essence referred to above is
what I thought I enclosed in my
father's cigar box. I call it
"value." This is what I hoped to
bury and what inflation manages
to destroy.
