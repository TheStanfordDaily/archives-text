# ASSU Sinks Lake's New Boathouse
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
The $100,000 proposal for
construction of a new recreation
center at the Boathouse site on Lake
Lagunita has essentially been dropped,
the ASSU Council of Presidents
announced yesterday.
Instead, the Council plans to
investigate how much it will cost to
repair the Boathouse, condemned in
1969, in order to decide exactly what
will be done with the building, ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri said.
The ASSU should have the cost
estimates in two weeks, he added.
The Council made its decision after
the Administration postponed
indefinitely the conversion of Lake
Lagunita into a year-round lake. They
said $100,000 was too much money to
spend on a recreation center if the lake
could not be used every quarter.
"It simply isn't high priority,"
Edward E. Shaw, executive assistant
vice president and provost, said of the
year-round lake. "We have to put our
resources towards scholarships,
housing and a new library."
Three Options
The Council members will have
three options with regard to the
Boathouse. They can decide to
remodel it, tear it down and leave
nothing, or tear it down and construct
a new building, ASSU Vice President
Ann Carter said. At any rate, ASSU
Vice president Quinn Mayer said
life-saving facilities and boat storage
space must be provided before the lake
starts filling.
Olivieri considers anything below
$20,000 a reasonable cost for
renovating the building. If the cost is
above $20,000 the Council may ask
students for a fee assessment. The first
$15,000 will at least be used to make
the Boathouse safe, Mayer said.
ASSU funds will be used to finance
the renovation, the Council members
said. The ASSU plans to resurface
both roofs of the Boathouse, expand
the deck for dancing and add facilities
for barbecues.
Construction of the new center
hinged upon the conversion of the lake
to a year-round facility and the
construction of housing facilities on
the lake, the original proposal stated.
Funding
The University would have funded
the lake's conversion. The most recent
estimate for converting the lake was
$150,000, according to Mayer.
However, Shaw said that estimate only
took into consideration engineering
costs, not total construction costs.
A special covering of the lake
bottom is needed because in the driest
seasons there is not enough water in
the nearby reservoirs to keep the lake
continuously full.
Dean of Students James W. Lyons
commented that "the year-round lake
is one of those nice things to do, but
something which can be done
without."
Always Postponed
This kind of attitude is what
bothers Olivieri. He said the University
will always find more important
priorities than a year-round lake. He
complained that different forms of the
same proposal for a new recreation by
former ASSU financial managers have
been "indefinitely postponed."
Olivieri said the University will put
up new housing units on the lake and
then regret they didn't make the lake
permanent. "It's like New York," he
said. "They work assed-backwards."
Shaw remarked optimistically that
future prospects for a permanent lake
are good. He said there will eventually
be a time when a year-round lake will
have top priority.
"If the economy turns
around ... we might be in a position
to ask alumni, like me for instance, to
contribute specifically to a permanent
lake fund."
