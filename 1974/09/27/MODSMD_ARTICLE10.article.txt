# Papers React Angrily To Pardon
## 
### 
The following excerpts are typical of
college newspaper editorials and columns
from around the country reacting to President
Ford's "full, free and absolute" pardon of
former President Nixon for any federal
offenses committed while in office.
Georgetown
President Ford has not only made a
mockery of the Executive Branch; he has
betrayed the trust, respect, and confidence
that millions of Americans so desperately
needed and wanted to have in him....
Exemplary of white collar crime, the law
and order boys in the white hats (with the
exception of the Cubans) got off with a
wrist-slapping. . . .
If Mr. Ford really wants to convince the
nation of his 'do-good' nature, he would have
extended his infinite mercy to U.S. draft
evaders who at least violated the law because
of their consciences — not despite them.
Kansas
The question, then, is whether this small
man, this Nixon, is worth that trouble. He is
not. The issue raised by Watergate and the
Nixon Presidency has been resolved. .. .
Only the people can call Ford to account.
Let's give Ford what he wants. Let's forget
Nixon. What is the alternative? Impeach
Ford?
UT El Paso
The greatest travesty of justice that has
occurred since the beginning of the Watergate
era. ...
This action constitutes a slap in the face
to the entire legal/judicial system of the

United States and poses a real threat to any
future actions against high governmental
officials for alleged criminal actions.
Nixon's pardon only served to place the
presidency further above the laws of this
country and eventually will lead to further
controversy over the inherent powers of the
president's office.
Lehigh
The Ford decision was both premature
and unjust. .. .
The point that Nixon has suffered enough
exemplifies reasoning which contradicts
everything for which the American judicial
process stands. It is the same type reasoning
used in the Agnew case.
The fact that an individual is caught
committing a crime and therefore suffers
great humiliation should not affect the j" act
that the individual is or was a public official.
Arizona
Jerald terHorst put the whole matter of
the Nixon pardon in a nutshell Sunday when
he told reporters he was resigning "in the
absence of a like decision to grant mercy to
persons of lesser stations in life."
Equal justice under law. A nice phrase.
Then there's the classic that runs, "We must
all take responsibility for our actions." That's
the one always heard in reference to draft
resisters whenever the question of amnesty is
raised....
But Richard Nixon, as the President tells
us, has suffered enough. Yes, perhaps he has,
and perhaps it is in order for us to accept the
pardon granted to him....
But many others have also suffered

enough, and Mr. Ford, as Jerald terHorst
said, must be evenhanded in his mercy.
SF State
When Ford granted former President
Nixon "a full and absolute pardon," he
initiated what has to be the ultimate coverup
of the coverup.
But why?
We don't know, perhaps will never know.
We can only surmise that there was a deal (no
softer word seems appropriate) and that Ford
was committed to a pardon in return for
Nixon's resignation....
The "honeymoon" is indeed over. It is not
unlikely that the divorce may soon follow.
Ivy League
Joint statement of six of the eight Ivy League
newspapers. (Harvard and Dartmouth were
not publishing at the time.)
President Ford's decision Sunday to grant
Richard Nixon a preemptive and blanket
pardon for all crimes he may have committed
while in office as President represents a
flagrant violation of' the principle of equal
justice under law.
Prosecution of Richard Nixon would have
been a clear demonstration that no
American, President or pauper, is above the
law. This pardon serves no end of humane
compassion. Instead, it can only undermine
faith in institutions basic and vital to the
democratic system in our nation.
Further, the pardon means that the
American people will never be able to learn
the real facts behind the events of the last
few years, and that a lingering suspicion of
government in general must necessarily
result.

Joint statement of six of the eight Ivy League
newspapers. (Harvard and Dartmouth were
not publishing at the time.)
President Ford's decision Sunday to grant
Richard Nixon a preemptive and blanket
pardon for all crimes he may have committed
while in office as President represents a
flagrant violation of' the principle of equal
justice under law.
Prosecution of Richard Nixon would have
been a clear demonstration that no
American, President or pauper, is above the
law. This pardon serves no end of humane
compassion. Instead, it can only undermine
faith in institutions basic and vital to the
democratic system in our nation.
Further, the pardon means that the
American people will never be able to learn
the real facts behind the events of the last
few years, and that a lingering suspicion of
government in general must necessarily
result.
The following excerpts are typical of
college newspaper editorials and columns
from around the country reacting to President
Ford's "full, free and absolute" pardon of
former President Nixon for any federal
offenses committed while in office.
Georgetown
President Ford has not only made a
mockery of the Executive Branch; he has
betrayed the trust, respect, and confidence
that millions of Americans so desperately
needed and wanted to have in him....
Exemplary of white collar crime, the law
and order boys in the white hats (with the
exception of the Cubans) got off with a
wrist-slapping. . . .
If Mr. Ford really wants to convince the
nation of his 'do-good' nature, he would have
extended his infinite mercy to U.S. draft
evaders who at least violated the law because
of their consciences — not despite them.
Kansas
The question, then, is whether this small
man, this Nixon, is worth that trouble. He is
not. The issue raised by Watergate and the
Nixon Presidency has been resolved. .. .
Only the people can call Ford to account.
Let's give Ford what he wants. Let's forget
Nixon. What is the alternative? Impeach
Ford?
UT El Paso
The greatest travesty of justice that has
occurred since the beginning of the Watergate
era. ...
This action constitutes a slap in the face
to the entire legal/judicial system of the

United States and poses a real threat to any
future actions against high governmental
officials for alleged criminal actions.
Nixon's pardon only served to place the
presidency further above the laws of this
country and eventually will lead to further
controversy over the inherent powers of the
president's office.
Lehigh
The Ford decision was both premature
and unjust. .. .
The point that Nixon has suffered enough
exemplifies reasoning which contradicts
everything for which the American judicial
process stands. It is the same type reasoning
used in the Agnew case.
The fact that an individual is caught
committing a crime and therefore suffers
great humiliation should not affect the j" act
that the individual is or was a public official.
Arizona
Jerald terHorst put the whole matter of
the Nixon pardon in a nutshell Sunday when
he told reporters he was resigning "in the
absence of a like decision to grant mercy to
persons of lesser stations in life."
Equal justice under law. A nice phrase.
Then there's the classic that runs, "We must
all take responsibility for our actions." That's
the one always heard in reference to draft
resisters whenever the question of amnesty is
raised....
But Richard Nixon, as the President tells
us, has suffered enough. Yes, perhaps he has,
and perhaps it is in order for us to accept the
pardon granted to him....
But many others have also suffered

enough, and Mr. Ford, as Jerald terHorst
said, must be evenhanded in his mercy.
SF State
When Ford granted former President
Nixon "a full and absolute pardon," he
initiated what has to be the ultimate coverup
of the coverup.
But why?
We don't know, perhaps will never know.
We can only surmise that there was a deal (no
softer word seems appropriate) and that Ford
was committed to a pardon in return for
Nixon's resignation....
The "honeymoon" is indeed over. It is not
unlikely that the divorce may soon follow.
