# Security Against College Closings

John Tunney

I am particularly interested in the area of
student assistance as it relates to vocational
and proprietary institutions. The default rate
on student loans continues to increase. In
many instances it is the fault of the
educational institutions which themselves
defaulted on their obligation to train and
instruct.
In California, for example, two vocational
institutions were forced to close at mid-term.
Thousands of students were stranded with no
education and crushing loan repayment
obligations.
Riverside University (not to be confused
with the University of California at
Riverside) became a non profit, four-year
institution in the fall of 1967. To all
appearances, the University gave every
indication of being a reputable institution.
In April 1970, however, four former
students charged that the school made "false,
deceptive, inaccurate and misleading
advertisements regarding its program in
shorthand court reporting." They filed suit in
Riverside Superior Court for refunds and
damages totaling $135,000. The complaint
alleged that each student "was wholly unable
to receive any semblance of a proper
education so as to qualify him as a court
reporter."
Riverside Bankrupt
In May 1971, Riverside University closed,
five weeks before the end of the quarter, and
filed for bankruptcy. At the time the school
closed, tuition refunds were denied and
approximately one thousand students were
left owing on loans that averaged $2,000 and
totaled $2 million.
Shortly after the University closed, my
office was inundated with letters from its
students. Many had obtained
federally insured loans or veterans'education

allowances and sought my assistance in
obtaining Federal loan forgiveness. The
response I received from the Office of
Education, while possibly legally correct, was
wholly unhelpful and unsympathetic.
Those students who had received veterans'
education allowance were denied further
benefits and asked by the Veterans
Administration to return the money
previously allocated to them for the purpose
of attending Riverside University.
Another Example
The West Coast Trade School illustrates
another, more recent example of a school
closing mid-term. The school was the lender,
all courses were paid for in full and in
advance. The paper was immediately sold to
outside financial institutions. When the
school's bid for accreditation was not
approved, its license to issue government
loans was revoked. Approximately 1,000
students were caught with loans amounting
to millions of dollars, outstanding, when the
school folded mid-session.
My bill would provide for the protection
of students in federally-insured student loan
programs when the vocational or proprietary
institutions abruptly close. It would also
protect students receiving veterans' education
allowances.
Under present circumstances, when an
institution closes its doors, a student may
lose not only an education but thousands of
dollars in future earnings.
Institution Must Educate
The educational institution has the
responsibility of educating the student. But if
it closes prematurely, the student is left
holding the bag.
My bill presents a viable solution to this
problem. It stipulates that no Federal student
loans no federally insured student loans,

and no veterans' education allowances may
be paid to a vocational or proprietary
institution that has been in existence for less
than ten years unless that school has
provided assurances — by posting a bond or
otherwise — that, in the event the institution
ceases operation, it will reimburse the
student for the portion of the loan that
would cover the education not received.
S 3807 is restricted to private vocational
and other proprietary institutions because
they are much more vulnerable to failure
than institutions supported by taxpayer
money, i.e., state-supported colleges and
universities.
Bonded For Ten Years
My bill also includes a provision which
stipulates that only those institutions in
existence for ten years or less must be
bonded. Thus, after a reasonable period of
time, a new, private educational institution
could prove itself to be a viable and reputable
institution.
Another portion of my bill directs the
Secretary of HEW to forgive the portion of
loans defaulted because of mid-term school
closings that have occurred prior to enaction
of this legislation. If the loan has already
been repaid, the government would
remimburse the student directly.
Forgiveness, however, is not the ultimate
answer. For the long-term we need a solution
that provides protection for all parties
involved with student assistance. Neither the
student, the loaning institution nor the
Federal Government should be forced to
clean up after an educational institution that
has failed its responsibility to educate.
(These remarks are excerpted from testimony
given by Sen. John Tunney (D-Calif.) before
the Senate Education Committee on Sept.
19. 1974.)

educational institutions which themselves
defaulted on their obligation to train and
instruct.
In California, for example, two vocational
institutions were forced to close at mid-term.
Thousands of students were stranded with no
education and crushing loan repayment
obligations.
Riverside University (not to be confused
with the University of California at
Riverside) became a non profit, four-year
institution in the fall of 1967. To all
appearances, the University gave every
indication of being a reputable institution.
In April 1970, however, four former
students charged that the school made "false,
deceptive, inaccurate and misleading
advertisements regarding its program in
shorthand court reporting." They filed suit in
Riverside Superior Court for refunds and
damages totaling $135,000. The complaint
alleged that each student "was wholly unable
to receive any semblance of a proper
education so as to qualify him as a court
reporter."
Riverside Bankrupt
In May 1971, Riverside University closed,
five weeks before the end of the quarter, and
filed for bankruptcy. At the time the school
closed, tuition refunds were denied and
approximately one thousand students were
left owing on loans that averaged $2,000 and
totaled $2 million.
Shortly after the University closed, my
office was inundated with letters from its
students. Many had obtained
federally insured loans or veterans'education

allowances and sought my assistance in
obtaining Federal loan forgiveness. The
response I received from the Office of
Education, while possibly legally correct, was
wholly unhelpful and unsympathetic.
Those students who had received veterans'
education allowance were denied further
benefits and asked by the Veterans
Administration to return the money
previously allocated to them for the purpose
of attending Riverside University.
Another Example
The West Coast Trade School illustrates
another, more recent example of a school
closing mid-term. The school was the lender,
all courses were paid for in full and in
advance. The paper was immediately sold to
outside financial institutions. When the
school's bid for accreditation was not
approved, its license to issue government
loans was revoked. Approximately 1,000
students were caught with loans amounting
to millions of dollars, outstanding, when the
school folded mid-session.
My bill would provide for the protection
of students in federally-insured student loan
programs when the vocational or proprietary
institutions abruptly close. It would also
protect students receiving veterans' education
allowances.
Under present circumstances, when an
institution closes its doors, a student may
lose not only an education but thousands of
dollars in future earnings.
Institution Must Educate
The educational institution has the
responsibility of educating the student. But if
it closes prematurely, the student is left
holding the bag.
My bill presents a viable solution to this
problem. It stipulates that no Federal student
loans no federally insured student loans,

and no veterans' education allowances may
be paid to a vocational or proprietary
institution that has been in existence for less
than ten years unless that school has
provided assurances — by posting a bond or
otherwise — that, in the event the institution
ceases operation, it will reimburse the
student for the portion of the loan that
would cover the education not received.
S 3807 is restricted to private vocational
and other proprietary institutions because
they are much more vulnerable to failure
than institutions supported by taxpayer
money, i.e., state-supported colleges and
universities.
Bonded For Ten Years
My bill also includes a provision which
stipulates that only those institutions in
existence for ten years or less must be
bonded. Thus, after a reasonable period of
time, a new, private educational institution
could prove itself to be a viable and reputable
institution.
Another portion of my bill directs the
Secretary of HEW to forgive the portion of
loans defaulted because of mid-term school
closings that have occurred prior to enaction
of this legislation. If the loan has already
been repaid, the government would
remimburse the student directly.
Forgiveness, however, is not the ultimate
answer. For the long-term we need a solution
that provides protection for all parties
involved with student assistance. Neither the
student, the loaning institution nor the
Federal Government should be forced to
clean up after an educational institution that
has failed its responsibility to educate.
(These remarks are excerpted from testimony
given by Sen. John Tunney (D-Calif.) before
the Senate Education Committee on Sept.
19. 1974.)
