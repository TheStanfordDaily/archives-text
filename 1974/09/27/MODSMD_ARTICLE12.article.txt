# How To Be Equal
## 
### 
Lucien Luber
By the late 19605, due to a
combination of political,
economic and social events, a
process of rediscovering poverty
and inequality was initiated. This
process led to national
commitments on the part of the
U.S. Government to find ways of
overcoming the injustices
associated with poverty and race.
The Report on Equality of
Educational Opportunity grew
out of these developments; it was
written when the forces of
political liberalism were
dominant, and when the war on
poverty had become a main issue
in American political life.
Today by the 19705, it is
recognized that the hopes
Americans had had that the
schools would be instrumental in
breaking the bonds of poverty
have faded, and as a consequence
of their disillusionment, people
began to think of elaborating new
strategies toward eliminating
poverty and inequality.
The book Inequality: A
Reassessment of the Effect of
Family and Schooling in America
by Christoper Jencks and his
colleagues reflects the obvious
fact that people are now searching
for new solutions to the perennial
problems of poverty and
inequality.
Genes Blameless
Jencks and his colleagues point
out that neither schooling nor
family background or genes can
account for the variation in men's
incomes received over a lifetime
period. Rather, economic success
is contingent upon chance factors
and competencies, and there is
not a significant relationship
between these competencies and
chance factors on the one hand,
and men's schooling, genes, family
background on the other.
Equality of opportunity has to
do with inequalities based on skin
color and economic background,
inequalities which must be
eliminated if equality of
opportunity is ever to be
achieved. Briefly stated, when
Americans talk about equal
opportunity what they mean is
that "the rules which determine
who succeeds and who fails
shoqld be fair." Jencks and his
colleagues implicitly assume that
the rules of the game are fair,
although they recognize that some
people might disagree on what is
"fair" and what is "unfair."
Jencks' next conclusion is that
poverty is defined by most
Americans in relative terms:
simply put, people in the U.S.,
when asked how much is
necessary for an American family
to get by, would reply that the
figure is about half the amount of
money the average American
family gets. People as a matter of
fact consider themselves poor as
soon as they receive much less
than their neighbors.
Wrong Focus
Moreover, Jencks reached the
conclusion that the reforms of the
1960s faded because their aim was
to equalize opportunity to
succeed or fail, and did not focus
on equalizing results.
Jencks takes issue with the
contention that schools have
long-term effects on the life of
students. Jencks assumes that no
school reform is likely to make
students more equal after they
leave school.
What strategies, then, might be
used to equalize luck and
competence factors? According to
Jencks, economic inequality is not
inevitable and there is not any
implication on his part that
poverty cannot be eliminated.
There must, however, be a major
redistribution of income.
Jencks' analysis generally runs
counter to social science tradition
and has been faulted by many
social scientists.
Clearly Jencks has operated
with much skill; however, it is still
not clear that he has exercised
sufficient care in arriving at his
major findings.

Lucien Luber
By the late 19605, due to a
combination of political,
economic and social events, a
process of rediscovering poverty
and inequality was initiated. This
process led to national
commitments on the part of the
U.S. Government to find ways of
overcoming the injustices
associated with poverty and race.
The Report on Equality of
Educational Opportunity grew
out of these developments; it was
written when the forces of
political liberalism were
dominant, and when the war on
poverty had become a main issue
in American political life.
Today by the 19705, it is
recognized that the hopes
Americans had had that the
schools would be instrumental in
breaking the bonds of poverty
have faded, and as a consequence
of their disillusionment, people
began to think of elaborating new
strategies toward eliminating
poverty and inequality.
The book Inequality: A
Reassessment of the Effect of
Family and Schooling in America
by Christoper Jencks and his
colleagues reflects the obvious
fact that people are now searching
for new solutions to the perennial
problems of poverty and
inequality.
Genes Blameless
Jencks and his colleagues point
out that neither schooling nor
family background or genes can
account for the variation in men's
incomes received over a lifetime
period. Rather, economic success
is contingent upon chance factors
and competencies, and there is
not a significant relationship
between these competencies and
chance factors on the one hand,
and men's schooling, genes, family
background on the other.
Equality of opportunity has to
do with inequalities based on skin
color and economic background,
inequalities which must be
eliminated if equality of
opportunity is ever to be
achieved. Briefly stated, when
Americans talk about equal
opportunity what they mean is
that "the rules which determine
who succeeds and who fails
shoqld be fair." Jencks and his
colleagues implicitly assume that
the rules of the game are fair,
although they recognize that some
people might disagree on what is
"fair" and what is "unfair."
Jencks' next conclusion is that
poverty is defined by most
Americans in relative terms:
simply put, people in the U.S.,
when asked how much is
necessary for an American family
to get by, would reply that the
figure is about half the amount of
money the average American
family gets. People as a matter of
fact consider themselves poor as
soon as they receive much less
than their neighbors.
Wrong Focus
Moreover, Jencks reached the
conclusion that the reforms of the
1960s faded because their aim was
to equalize opportunity to
succeed or fail, and did not focus
on equalizing results.
Jencks takes issue with the
contention that schools have
long-term effects on the life of
students. Jencks assumes that no
school reform is likely to make
students more equal after they
leave school.
What strategies, then, might be
used to equalize luck and
competence factors? According to
Jencks, economic inequality is not
inevitable and there is not any
implication on his part that
poverty cannot be eliminated.
There must, however, be a major
redistribution of income.
