# Ahh, Stanford—Crummy Food And No Housing...
## Housing Crunch Here To Stay For Long Time 
### BONNY RODDEN 
The on-campus housing shortage is here to
stay for quite some time.
The construction of three new Row houses
will not be completed until September 1976
at the earliest, according to the housing study
"Undergraduate Student Housing Needs at
Stanford 1974-1984." At that time, only 150
spaces will be available.
That means even with three new Row
houses at least 670 students would be on the
waiting lists for autumn on-campus housing,
assuming the desire for on-campus housing
does not increase along with the price of
automobiles and off-campus rent.
If the desire does increase, the number of
students clamoring for on-campus housing will
undoubtedly soar above 700.
Thus at least 700 undergraduates who pay
tution for a residential university will be living
off-campus. -
Lise Pfeiffer, head of the Clearing House—a
student rental agency — said most students
just aren't prepared to rush around looking
for housing. They don't know the folk
wisdom of renting for example, "if you like it,
grab it before the landlord rents it to someone
else."
Many students do not want to be isolated
from the rest of the campus. They came to
Stanford to live in a student community, not
a studio apartment in downtown Palo Alto.
Pfeiffer said she knew of transfers freshly
introduced to Stanford who called their
parents, crying "I was deceived. I hate it here.
I hate it here."
Homesickness is one thing; forcing students
into a living situation they abhor is another.
The Clearing House can only do so much. It
can direct students to available off-campus
housing but it cannot change student
attitudes. That is up to the University.
Some students have said the Admissions
Office wasn't honest with them about the
housing shortage situation. Pfeiffer, in her
recommendations for next year's Clearing
Housing, will suggest that all sturents be
informed of the situation on applying to
Stanford, not after having been accepted.
Being "less than candid" to incoming students
is being deceptive.
Construction of mass housing to alleviate
the crunch does not appear imminent. Stage
Two of the undergraduate housing project will
be "a cluster or pattern of 10 to 14 houses of
50 to 70 students" with occupancy of the
first units in September 1978 at the earliest.
However, one administrator said the
present state of the stock market would make
it increasingly difficult to find donors for such
a large project — costing about $21.4 million.
The Board of Trustees decides which
construction projects deserve immediate
attention and financial support. Right now
building a new library seems to rank highest in
the trustees' priorities.
However, with the room and board rates
expected to increase to $3010 by 1985-1986
with no additional construction, it will be
hard enough to attract students to Stanford.
A housing shortage will not add to the
attractiveness of an education here.
It is up to the administration and students
to enlighten the trustees about the crucial
state of housing and the priority it deserves.
And until the shortage ends, Stanford should
explain the situation to incoming students so
they know what they're getting into.
