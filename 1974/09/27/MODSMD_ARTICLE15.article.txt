## Flournoy Tries To Heat Up Lethargic Gubernatorial Race-Carefully 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
What has been one of the most lackluster
state election campaigns in recent memory
showed a few signs of heating up this week as
Republican nominee Houston I. Flournoy
stepped up his media spending and brought
his campaign to Stanford's Frost
Amphitheater.
Flournoy needs a boost. Still trailing
Democratic nominee Edmund G. Brown Jr. in
the polls, the GOP standard-bearer was
devoting precious time and energy to
rebutting charges that he botched one of his
functions as state controller.
Brown says Flournoy failed to collect bank
service charges that were due to the state, and
says this may have cost the state upwards of
$100 million. Earlier this week, one of
Flournoy's own auditors said he was
dissatisfied with the way the collections were
handled.
All this bodes ill for the controller's
campaign. Brown, son of the former
(1959-1967) Democratic governor of the same
name, was elected secretary of state in what
was otherwise a clean sweep of state offices
for the Republicans in 1970 — and proved to
be a surprisingly durable candidate in this
year's Democratic primary race.
But Flournoy, while a big vote-getter in his
two races for controller, wasn't really put to a
test in the GOP primary: his only opponent,
Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke, was indicted and
convicted of perjury in the ITT affair during
the campaign.
Ironically, if not for his ITT troubles,

Reinecke might have made the stronger
candidate. A protege of Gov. Ronald
Reagan's, the lieutenant governor is still a
member in good standing of the state party's
dominant conservative wing. Flournoy, as a
moderate, remains suspect to many
conservatives despite the backing he's picked
up from such prominent state and local
conservatives as industrialist David Packard
and J. Gordon Knapp, the Atherton
businessman who nearly unseated maverick
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) in
June.
Because of his stance, Flournoy is in a
decidely uncomfortable position. In a state

with a 3-2 Democratic registration edge, he
has to make inroads with moderate
Democratic and independent voters. But at
the same time, he has to move significantly to
the right if he wants to unite his own party
behind him — also a necessity in putting
together a victory.
So, between courting moderates and
courting conservatives, Flournoy hasn't been
able to articulate any clear issues for fear of
offending one or the other.
The result has been a curious
non-campaign. Flournoy's radio spots either
deride his opponent because of his relative
youth ("Jerry Brown just isn't ready to be
governor") or stress Flournoy's own fiscal
experience as making him better qualified to
deal with inflation and other economic ills.
But this year, a fresh young face doesn't
seem to be much of a liability — and the
uncollected fees affair isn't doing much for
Flournoy's image as a money manager.
At Frost, Flournoy actually admitted that
"I don't know what the issues of the
campaign are going to be" — a curious
statement considering the election is just five
weeks away. His increased media campaign —
which carefully avoids revealing his party
affiliation — seems to be an effort to bring
him within striking distance of Brown well
before Election Day.
If he succeeds, a last-minute push and
media blitz could conceivably swing the
election his way. If he fails, he could be out of
money and energy well before the voters go to
the polls. It's a gamble.
