# What Will The New TMU Have To Do To Survive?

### VLAE KERSHNER 
Tresidder cafeteria was much maligned and
ignored while it was in existence, but in
comparison to what occupies its space
currently, it was The Brown Derby.
Most students dislike the limited menu
choice and relatively expensive "junk" food
offered at the cafeteria's successor, The
Transition, a Daily survey showed.
Fortunately, The Transition won't be
around too long. Tresidder General Manager
Gordon Starr is currently soliciting bids for a
food service to replace it.
What will the eventual Tresidder Food
Service be like? One thing for certain is that it

will have to offer menu items which don't
require a great deal of preparation.
High Labor Costs
The cafeteria's demise can be directly
attributed to high labor costs. It employed
over 30 full-time workers, yet had a volume of
only about $800,000 in 1973-74. These costs
helped force high prices, which decreased
volume, just as a supply-demand curve would
predict.
While the United Stanford Employees
union beefed at the mass layoffs, it really had
no valid complaint other than the University's
lack of openness during the decision-making
process.
In addition to lower ratio of labor to
volume, the new Tresidder Food Service must
have a more pleasing atmosphere.
A survey taken by the University showed
that Tresidder ranks near the bottom of a list
of restaurants at which people like to eat. In
marked contrast to the Coffee House,
Tresidder customers like to get in, eat and get
out. With its 1950ish (or is it 1984ish?) decor,
sterile lighting and unattractive rows of tables,
this statistic is not surprising.
Menu Variety
A third factor which must be considered is
menu variety. Students want hot dogs,
hamburgers and milkshakes of course. But
how about those persons who want a real hot
meal like the old Tresidder offered? Those
persons, including many graduate students
without automobiles, need inexpensive but
balanced meals.
Another problem will be finding the right
group to manage Tresidder Food Service. The
current operator, TDS, Inc., is a relatively
small company which might not be able to
raise the several hundred thousand dollars
probably needed for cafeteria improvements.
Another consideration is hours. The
Transition is now one of the few fast-food
restaurants that doesn't stay open late at
night. Yet a major portion of its marketcould
well be students on meal plans who are
hungry for a late night snack.
Finally, the new Tresidder restaurant must
be integrated with the Coffee House, Marcel's
pastry shop, the ice cream franchise which is
planned for TMU and Little Leland's Pub, if
and when it becomes extant.
It's obvious that a lot of thought will have
to be given to the new Tresidder Food
Service. If it isn't, the new Tresidder will be as
financially and aesthetically inadequate as the
old.
