# Stanford And Palo Alto: Calm, But...
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The classic "town-gown" conflict between
universities and cities has seldom afflicted
relations between Palo Alto and Stanford. In
recent years however, Palo Altans have
regarded the University's activities with
increasing apprehension, fearing that
Stanford's growth aggravates the city's urban
problems.
Recognizing the potential for turmoil,
University officials have wisely attempted to
smooth Palo Alto-Stanford relations before
the disputes grow into a major riff.
The Stanford-Palo Alto Liaison
Committee, established last year, has
contributed significantly to tranquil relations
between the two. The tentative solution to
the College Terrace traffic imbroglio last
spring was the first demonstration of the
Committee's merits.
Last week, the University published a
study that, if studied and heeded by
administrators, could serve as a useful

instrument for preserving goodwill between
Palo Alto and Stanford.
Recommendations
Prepared by former Palo Alto City
Councilwoman Sylvia Seman, the study
reveals the attitudes of Palo Alto civic leaders
toward Stanford and makes a series of
recommendations for potential Stanford
community service projects.
The poll shows that although Palo Alto
leaders appreciate the benefits provided to the
community by Stanford, they blame the
University for contributing to the city's urban
problems.
Perhaps this explains why a large majority
of those polled oppose enlargement of the
Industrial Park and the Linear Accelerator
facility.
It's also why 85 percent of survey
respondents termed construction of a high rise
complex like Palo Alto Square "not important
at all."
Although the University is supposedly in a

"steady state" the results of the survey should
reaffirm the University's intention to discuss
future building plans with city officials.
The University should consider Palo Alto
opinion in its projects and make reasonable
provisions for the solutions of city problems
created by those plans. But it would be wrong
for city opinion to inhibit the University in
growth that the administration deems
necessary.
One of the most disturbing aspects of the
survey was the indication that 59 percent of
those polled favor annexing faculty housing
areas of campus and 39 percent favor
annexation of student housing areas.
Although the city council would probably
never consider annexing any major part of
Stanford, the University should explain to the
civic leaders why such annexations would be
detrimental both to the city and to the
University.
The fact that even 24 percent of the city
fathers believe that the entire University in

the county should be annexed indicates that
the University should do more to publicize
the case against annexation.
Some Good
As for the recommendations made by the
civic leaders and Seman, some of them are
intelligent and will no doubt be heeded in one
form r another by the University over a long
period of time.
For example, the report urged greater
cooperation between the city and the
University in the sharing of cultural facilities.
But many of the proposals, like a traffic
study by the University, are obviously too
expensive to be feasible for implementation
by the University alone.
Whatever the differences between
University and city interests uncovered by the
survey, the very fact that the University now
has a rich source of Palo Alto opinion and
constructive suggestion is a good omen for
future relations between the city and the
University.
