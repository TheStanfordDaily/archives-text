# Sigma Chi Plant Protest
## Fraternity Battle Imminent? 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Members of Sigma Chi fraternity will
battle a possible University ruling which
would take away fraternities' rights to
subjectively determine future residents and
to be exempt from the draw, sophomore
Tim Ferguson vowed Wednesday.
Ferguson, a Sigma Chi pledge, said he will
propose a solution to the current
sex-discrimination problem which would
allow all houses "willing to assume full
financial liability" to be outside the draw.
Ferguson presented his views to an open
meeting of mostly fraternity members in the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) lounge
Wednesday afternoon. Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton called the
meeting to discuss the issues surrounding the
draw exemption privilege.
Currently, the privileges of being exempt
from the spring housing draw and being able
to subjectively select future residents are
only extended to 12 all-male fraternities.
Alpha Sigma Phi
Last February, Alpha Sigma Phi, a coed
fraternity within the draw, requested to have
the same privilege, charging that the current
system discriminated on the basis of sex.
Their request was turned down in order to
investigate the issue more thoroughly.
Since then, regulations implementing title
IX of the federal Educational Amendments
Act of 1972 have been proposed. If such
regulations were adopted, the housing system
would be "clearly in violation" of them,
Horton has said. "We cannot maintain the
status quo."
Though not an official representative of
Sigma Chi, Ferguson said yesterday that
members of his house are "overwhelmingly in
agreement" with his position.

Ferguson's proposal sets up two systems,
with any residence being able to become
independent if its members agree to assume
full financial responsibility. Such houses
would be allowed to subjectively select their
members, with only current restrictions
applying.
This proposal is in marked contrast to one
submitted earlier by David Salego, a member
of SAE. Salego's plan withdraws the
draw-exemption privilege from fraternities,
but extends the right to select future
members to all "there" houses (characteristics
to be determined later).
Ferguson has charged that Salego's plan
will do away with fraternities "as we now
know them."
Kappa Sigma
But Greg Norton, a member of Kappa
Sigma, said fraternities could exist under the
Salego system, though he urged that a
statement of intent should be drafted in
order to avoid future decisions that would
effectively destroy fraternities.
Horton agreed that a statement should be
written to make the intent of the decision
clear.
Ferguson claims that "The crux of the
problem ... is the University's
discriminatory policies" of not allowing the
existence of sororities.
Sororities Banned
The Board of Trustees voted to ban
sororities in 1944 after a majority of the
women voted in favor of such a ban, and
after numerous hearings.
At that time, many more women than
could get in wanted to join sororities,
creating biterness, Horton noted.
He said that "what did happen in 1944 is
not going to have any bearing now, though."
Horton has often stated that history does not

tell one where to go in the future.
Ferguson also blamed the current problem
on the University's "overadmitting students."
If there currently were no housing shortage,
the Salego system would be similar to the
fraternity system now, except that it would
be extended to all "theme" houses.
Horton also indicated Wednesday that
under the current wording of title IX
regulations, "single-sex fraternities could not
remain in residences on University property."
His opinion was supported by Iris Brest, an
attorney in the General Secretary's office,
who was also at the Wednesday meeting.
George Gregory, another attorney from
the G.S.O. who attended a regional meeting
regarding the title IX regulations said the
indication was that private organizations that
discriminate on the basis of sex "can't receive
any significant institutional support."
But Horton indicated that the more
immediate problem is the draw-exemption
issue. Only when the regulations become law
and are tested will the question about
single-sex organizations be answered, he said.
As far as actually making the final
decision, Horton said that it "hasn't moved
much since last spring," and noted that he
does not know what decision-making process
he will use.
Horton explained that he "will be called
upon to make a recommendation to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons, who in turn
will make a recommendation to President
Richard Lyman."
Lyman will then bring the
recommendation before the Trustees who
will make the final decision.
Horton said he expects his
"recommendation to be a strong one." He
added that he would have to accept the
responsibility for the decision.
