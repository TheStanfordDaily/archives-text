# P.A. Officer Falls Down Embankment
## 
### 
Palo 'Alto Policeman Charles
DeMoulin, 32, remained in
intensive care at Stanford Hospital
last night after falling 30 feet
down an embankment near the
Stanford Shopping Center early
yesterday morning.
He reportedly has internal
injuries, with possibly leg and
back fractures.
DeMoulin was apparently
chasing a man he saw running
away from the I. Magnin store
when he lost his footing on the
embankment bordering the dried
up San Francisquito river bed
shortly after midnight.
He became trapped in some
trees and shrubbery about 20 feet
up from the river bed, after
tumbling down through a patch of
poison oak. Palo Alto police and
fire units took over an hour and a
half to disengage him.
Michael Eliastam, director of
the hospital's Emergency Room,
directed the rescue of DeMoulin
from the embankment, and
reported that the officer's "vital
signs were stable."
A 10-year veteran of the force,
DeMoulin was on routine patrol in
his squad car when he spotted the
suspect, according to Lt. A 1
Bowra.
When police were unable to
contact DeMoulin, other Palo
Alto officers came to the
shopping center and discovered
DeMoulin's car with the ignition
key still in it and the police radio
on, Bowra said.
