# Law Opens Student Files
## 
### BOB LOWE 
Stanford students apparently will
have access to files with confidential
information about themselves when a
new federal law goes into effect in
three weeks.
The law, authored by Sen. James
Buckley (Cons.- N.Y.) will give
students access to most letters of
recommendation written by University
faculty members, President Richard W.
Lyman said after yesterday's Faculty
Senate meeting.
Lyman said the law also makes
available high school letters of
recommendation.
The law definitely will affect
recommendation letters written after
the law becomes effective in
mid-October, but it isn't clear whether
it will be retroactive, making available
letters written earlier.
'Serious Problem'
The law will create a "serious
problem" for the University, Lyrnan
said. Applications from next year's
freshmen candidates now are coming
in to the University accompanied by
confidential letters.
The situation was revealed in
yesterday's meeting when Biology
Prof. Colin Pittendrigh asked Lyman
about the implications of the law to
the University.
"It will make available to students
all the letters in their files," Lyman
replied.
Lyman described the law as another
case where "higher education has
gotten mixed up in unrelated"
legislation.
'Computer ization'
He added that the law was
primarily a reaction to increasing
"computerization" and automated
accounting in non-education areas.
Lyman would not say how the
University will respond to a student
who asks to see the contents of his
confidential file. He said the problem
was under study.
"It came to us as a bolt out of the
blue," he said, adding that he was first
informed of the law's effect two weeks
ago.
Lyman said the University is trying
to get Buckley to amend his
legislation.
Destroy?
Dean of Graduate Studies Lincoln
Moses suggested that old high school

recommendations could be destroyed
if they will serve no future purpose.
Lyman said that other suggestions
will be studied.
In other matters, Lyman told the
Senate that the University faces a
"new round of new and serious budget
problems."
He attributed the financial plight to
the "collapse" of the stock market and
inflation. He added that the University
will decide "how best to involve the
faculty and students" in solving its
economic problems.
The Senate approved a revision in
the University's patent policy which
gives University personnel greater
control over patent rights than the
previous policy.
The previous version stated that
"all University personnel involved in
research are asked to sign" an
agreement giving patent rights to the
University.

The new policy states that
University personnel must sign the
agreement in certain situations.
Personnel working under grants and
contracts requiring the University to
"make patent agreements to fulfill
obligations to research sponsors" are
required to sign the agreement under
the amended policy.
The Senate was divided over the
procedure of handling grievances
under the Statement on Academic
Freedom approved last April by the
Senate.
Debate centered over a provision
denying the grievant access to letters
pertaining to the "grievant's
qualifications and performance of
academic functions."
The Senate took no action on the
grievance procedure which will
become policy if the Senate, Academic
Council, Lyman and the Board of
Trustees take no action against it.
