# Campaign Accord Snags On Mailing
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Congressional candidates Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo
Park) and Santa Clara Mayor Gary
Gillmor this week reaffirmed an
April agreement to limit each
candidate's campaign
expenditures to $25,000 but their
accord snagged on provisions for a
proposed joint mailer.
The new campaign agreement
retained their old promise to
refuse any contributions greater
than $500 from individuals or
$1000 from organizations.
At a meeting with a
three-member board of review,
McCloskey proposed sending the
mailer to voters immediately
while Gillmor wanted to wait
until just before the Nov. 5
election.
No Agreement Immiment
Spokesmen for both candidates
said no agreement is imminent,
and expressed little hope that
some sort of compromise can
soon be reached.
McCloskey prefers sending the
mailer early in order to attract
voter interest in the eleven
debates scheduled for the
campaign, according to Kathy
Cunningham, a McCloskey aide.
But Gillmor preferred to wait
until early November when the
candidates' stands on issues will
be clearer, Wade "Brummel,
Gillmor's press secretary,
explained to the Daily.

Cunningham said McCloskey
fears that attendance at the
debates will be sparse if the
mailers aren't sent soon but is
willing to compromise by sending
the mailers on Oct. 20.
Aides to both candidates
explained that the spending
limitation precludes any
possibility of compromising by
sending voters two mailers.
McCloskey didn't send voters
his usual August newsletter "in
order to eliminate the campaign
inequity that the frank
proliferates," Cunningham noted.
"Gillmor has procrastinated so
much that [McCloskey's]
preference won't be operable,"
Cunningham said. "The plan is in
limbo," and if an agreement isn't
reached soon so much time will
have passed that Gillmor's plan
will take effect automatically, she
explained.
Accusation Denied
But Brummel denied
Cunningham's accusation, stating
that "we're not delaying [the
mailing] we just don't have it put
together yet."
Brummel added that "its
foolish to send [the mailing] out
only to advertise." He said he
expects only 100 to 200 people to
attend each debate, insisting the
mailers will have a negligible
impact on attendance.
