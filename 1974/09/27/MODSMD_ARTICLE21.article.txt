# Telephone Installation Charges Rise To $24
## 
### JANET SWANBERG 
Students no longer wait ten rings for the University switchboard,
due to the new Centrex system. But they face a new problem: being
able to afford a phone. Phone installation now taps the pocketbook
for $24.
The state-wide flat rate of $24 applies for new houses, which
require telephone pole connection. The same rate also applies to dorm
rooms, which already have phones inside. The rate increase, up from
last year's $15 fee, was approved by the Public Utilities Commission
(PUC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) after a
23-month debate. It became effective Aug. 17 .
A representative of the Pacific Telephone Company said increased
costs in every department of the phone company prompted the
increase.
"You must remember the operator who takes the order, the typist

who types the form, the employee,
who compiles the listing, the
accounting personnel and the
installer himself," the
spokeswoman said.
Cost Studies
She added that "cost studies
performed by the telephone
company, which are submitted to
the FCC and PUC show an average
of $55-$65 per new phone
installation." She claimed, "The
$24 doesn't nearly cover all the
expenses."
The spokeswoman noted that
phone service representatives were
at Stanford all summer, testing
and rewiring all of the phones in
the residences. Many phones were
sent back to Western Electric for
repairs and each phone was given
a new number. "We spent all this
time specifically so the students
wouldn't have to wait a week for
installation," she explained.
Larry Horton, associate dean
for Student Affairs, estimated
that there are at least 3000
student phones. At $24 a shot,
this adds quickly to $72,000 for
installation alone.
Horton said that "phone prices
are worth looking into" and that
he would be "willing to help a
committee" if they wanted to
take up this project.
Committee Examination
He said, "the new row house
committee will probably examine
the phone situation for the new
houses and there is a possibility
for a spin off for the entire
campus."
Bruce Wiggins, operations
manager of University Plant
Services, noted that "each student
deals directly with the phone
company. The University has
nothing to do with the individual
connections."
Students arc not permitted to
have an existing phone connected
at last year's number because they
usually don't know who lived in
the room before them, the phone
company spokeswoman added.

Committee Examination
He said, "the new row house
committee will probably examine
the phone situation for the new
houses and there is a possibility
for a spin off for the entire
campus."
Bruce Wiggins, operations
manager of University Plant
Services, noted that "each student
deals directly with the phone
company. The University has
nothing to do with the individual
connections."
Students arc not permitted to
have an existing phone connected
at last year's number because they
usually don't know who lived in
the room before them, the phone
company spokeswoman added.
Students no longer wait ten rings for the University switchboard,
due to the new Centrex system. But they face a new problem: being
able to afford a phone. Phone installation now taps the pocketbook
for $24.
The state-wide flat rate of $24 applies for new houses, which
require telephone pole connection. The same rate also applies to dorm
rooms, which already have phones inside. The rate increase, up from
last year's $15 fee, was approved by the Public Utilities Commission
(PUC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) after a
23-month debate. It became effective Aug. 17 .
A representative of the Pacific Telephone Company said increased
costs in every department of the phone company prompted the
increase.
"You must remember the operator who takes the order, the typist

who types the form, the employee,
who compiles the listing, the
accounting personnel and the
installer himself," the
spokeswoman said.
Cost Studies
She added that "cost studies
performed by the telephone
company, which are submitted to
the FCC and PUC show an average
of $55-$65 per new phone
installation." She claimed, "The
$24 doesn't nearly cover all the
expenses."
The spokeswoman noted that
phone service representatives were
at Stanford all summer, testing
and rewiring all of the phones in
the residences. Many phones were
sent back to Western Electric for
repairs and each phone was given
a new number. "We spent all this
time specifically so the students
wouldn't have to wait a week for
installation," she explained.
Larry Horton, associate dean
for Student Affairs, estimated
that there are at least 3000
student phones. At $24 a shot,
this adds quickly to $72,000 for
installation alone.
Horton said that "phone prices
are worth looking into" and that
he would be "willing to help a
committee" if they wanted to
take up this project.
