The Grateful Dead
Grateful Dead from the Mars Hotel
Grateful Dead Records GD 102
If you're a Dead freak and you
put stock in what Rolling Stone
says about the Dead's
less-than-solid future, then you're
probably worried.
And if you've listened to the
Dead's latest release, Grateful
Dead from the Mars Hotel, that
worry may be even more justified.
It seems with the Mars Hotel
album that the Dead are lost ...
caught in the continuum of
day-to-day existence as a
supergroup. Rolling Stone
suggests in the Oct. 10 issue that
the six-member group is in a
"tour-make records-get money
syndrome that is wearing thin."
Included in the Dead's
numerous problems are the
rumors of the group's break-up
and the cancellation of their
October tour (separate from their
upcoming, almost sold-out gigs in
the City).
Overlong, Repetitive
The Mars Hotel album
musically reflects the group's deep
trouble. The eight songs included
are generally overlong and
repetitive (indicating a possible
lack of material).
Those lengthy, but ingenious

jams (found in songs like "Playing
in the Band" and "China Cat
Sunflower/ I Know You Rider"
from Europe '72) are noticeably
absent.
There's not one good, intricate
Jerry Garcia guitar solo, and Bob
Weir's rhythm guitar is so
unusually weak that it fades
behind Keith Godchaux's
keyboard boogies.
Despite overall trouble on the
album, three songs are sure to
rank among the Dead's finest
writing efforts — "Scarlett
Begonias," "U.S. Blues" and
"Ship of Fools." These songs are
so good, it's worth buying the

album, even if you have to forget
the rest of the songs.
"Scarlet Begonias" and "U.S.
Blues" are jumpy-lyric,
quick-tempo numbers that swing,
while "Ship of Fools" is a moving,
Garcia-led Bible ballad which the
Dead have played well (better) in
concert for months.
Deep Despair
Yet songs like "China Doll,"
"Money" and "Pride of
Cucamonga" show the depth of
the group's despair — they are
miserable.
Especially noteworthy is that
the three good songs on the album
are all co-written by Garcia and

Robert Hunter, who both have
recorded solo albums recently.
Neither artist's work was
particularly well-received, but it's
clear that the only song-writing
inspiration going for the Dead
now is the Hunter-Garcia duo.
Perhaps that team is strong
enough to do the job for the
Dead, but the drop in quality
from Weir's pen is particularly
disappointing.
The Grateful Dead have
another shot though — a new
album beginning in January. Let's
hope they get it together by then,
Dead fans.

"Money" and "Pride of
Cucamonga" show the depth of
the group's despair — they are
miserable.
Especially noteworthy is that
the three good songs on the album
are all co-written by Garcia and

Robert Hunter, who both have
recorded solo albums recently.
Neither artist's work was
particularly well-received, but it's
clear that the only song-writing
inspiration going for the Dead
now is the Hunter-Garcia duo.
Perhaps that team is strong
enough to do the job for the
Dead, but the drop in quality
from Weir's pen is particularly
disappointing.
The Grateful Dead have
another shot though — a new
album beginning in January. Let's
hope they get it together by then,
Dead fans.

Grateful Dead from the Mars Hotel
Grateful Dead Records GD 102
If you're a Dead freak and you
put stock in what Rolling Stone
says about the Dead's
less-than-solid future, then you're
probably worried.
And if you've listened to the
Dead's latest release, Grateful
Dead from the Mars Hotel, that
worry may be even more justified.
It seems with the Mars Hotel
album that the Dead are lost ...
caught in the continuum of
day-to-day existence as a
supergroup. Rolling Stone
suggests in the Oct. 10 issue that
the six-member group is in a
"tour-make records-get money
syndrome that is wearing thin."
Included in the Dead's
numerous problems are the
rumors of the group's break-up
and the cancellation of their
October tour (separate from their
upcoming, almost sold-out gigs in
the City).
Overlong, Repetitive
The Mars Hotel album
musically reflects the group's deep
trouble. The eight songs included
are generally overlong and
repetitive (indicating a possible
lack of material).
Those lengthy, but ingenious

jams (found in songs like "Playing
in the Band" and "China Cat
Sunflower/ I Know You Rider"
from Europe '72) are noticeably
absent.
There's not one good, intricate
Jerry Garcia guitar solo, and Bob
Weir's rhythm guitar is so
unusually weak that it fades
behind Keith Godchaux's
keyboard boogies.
Despite overall trouble on the
album, three songs are sure to
rank among the Dead's finest
writing efforts — "Scarlett
Begonias," "U.S. Blues" and
"Ship of Fools." These songs are
so good, it's worth buying the

album, even if you have to forget
the rest of the songs.
"Scarlet Begonias" and "U.S.
Blues" are jumpy-lyric,
quick-tempo numbers that swing,
while "Ship of Fools" is a moving,
Garcia-led Bible ballad which the
Dead have played well (better) in
concert for months.
Deep Despair
Yet songs like "China Doll,"
"Money" and "Pride of
Cucamonga" show the depth of
the group's despair — they are
miserable.
Especially noteworthy is that
the three good songs on the album
are all co-written by Garcia and

Robert Hunter, who both have
