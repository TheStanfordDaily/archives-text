# New Film Series Opens Tuesday
## 
### 
A new film series will be
presented on campus this fall,
featuring a wide range of French
movies, all works of prominent
directors. Two graduate students,
Helene Davis and Pauline Huerre,
created this cinematheque which
is sponsored by the French
Department, the ASSU and the
International Association.
The series will open Oct. 1
with Alain Tanner's La Salamandre
(1971). This unconventional story
gives an insight about a woman's
struggle for liberation in an
industrial and materialistic

society.
French CanCan (1954) by Jean
Renoir will be shown on Oct. 8.
Based on the life of Danglard,
who started the Moulin Rouge, it
recreates the atmosphere of
Montmartre during the Belle
Epoque.
Ma Nuit Chez Maud (1969),
presented on Oct. 22, is probably
the best work of Eric Rohmer,
who also directed Claire's Knee.
The famous film of Alain
Resnais Hiroshima Mon Amour
(Nov. 5), explores the realm of
memory through a doomed affair
between a Japanese architect and
a French woman.
Claude Chabrol's Les Bonnes
Femmes (1960), shown on Nov.
12, tells of the efforts of four
working girls in Paris to rise above
the oppression imposed by their

work-a-day lives.
On Nov. 19, the series presents
a controversial movie, Le Chagrin
Et La Pitie (1971), which deals
with a subject long considered, in
France, too sensitive to probe
deeply: the behaviour of the
French during the Nazi
occupation.
The series ends on Dec. 3 with
a film by Louis Malle, ZAZIE
DAYS LE METRO (1960). This
movie is an adaptation of a
famous novel by Raymond
Queneau.
Admission is $1, except forLe
Chagrin Et La Pitie which is
$1.50. Membership cards for the
whole series are available for $6.
All films will be in French with
English subtitles and will be
shown at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. in
Bishop Auditorium.
