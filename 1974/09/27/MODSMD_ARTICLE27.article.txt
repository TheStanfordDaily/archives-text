# Final Week Of Fair
## Pleasure Faire Recreates Old Times 
### JANET SWANBERG 
Shabbily dressed in a
gunnysack and tights, a ruffian
was forcefully holding a young
damsel in front of a bakery.
"Want a piece of Lorraine?" he
cried lustily to the passerbys.
Instantaneously attracting the
attention of the crowd, he smiled
and added . . quiche Lorraine,
.that is."
Such is the frolic and fun of
the Renaissance Faire.
Nestled in a oak forest in Marin
county, the Renaissance Pleasure
Faire offers the visitor a glimpse
of an old English market place,
400 years removed. Sights, sounds
and smells of merry old England
rebound throughout the colorful
setting, winding in and out of the
tree-lined paths.
An authentic re-creation of
16th century rural fairs in
England, the Pleasure Faire
features over 500 entertainers
who offer almost continuous
entertainment with all the pomp,
pageantry and color of Medieval
and Renaissance times.
Craftsmen and chefs display
their works in little booths, while
hucksters sing and call to visitors
to buy their wares. Barkers plead
with passerbys to "dunk a
wench," or "bowl a troll" while
other booths offer archery,
jousting and rope ladder climbing.
The language of the fairs
always includes "M'Lord and
M'Lady" and signs declare that
one must show a "Coachman's
license" before buying ale or
ginger beer.
Troubadors, mimes, jugglers,
magicians and puppeters rove
constantly throughout the
grounds, offering short shows
with varied routines. The mimes
were exceptional and jugglers even
give lessons. Harpists, guitarists
and other musicians display their
talents from various nooks and
tree branches.
The faire opens at 10 a.m. to
the sounds of horns and ringing
market bells. At noon there is a
harvest home procession, where
the crowd gathers at the Ben
Johnson stage to watch songs,
dances and plays of the period.
The Queen visits her subjects at
3 p.m., making her way through
the faire to the main theater
where she hears petitions from her
subjects and proclaims new laws.
She too is entertained by the Lord
Mayor and other musicians,
dancers and actors.
Visitors are advised to come in
costume, and although only half
of the crowd complies with this
idea, the crowd is part of the
show. Men appear in gunny sacks
turned into make-shift tunics,
while woman often put together

long skirts and gowns. The
messengers push through
masses of people, yelling "Make
way, I'm on the Queen's
business," while young girls rush
up to spectators, urging them to
try new herbal snuff.
The only evidence that the
20th century exists are the paper
cups used for cold drinks. There is
no electricity, lights or (heaven
forbid) motors or autos. Cars are
parked sufficiently far away and
are well hidden. Instead, one is
filled with natural noises of

bawdy folk, merriment and frolic.
The Bth annual Renaissance
Faire is bursting with energy and
authenticity, yet is almost
identical to the faires held in the
last few years. It is produced by
the Renaissance Centre, a
non-profit educational and
cultural foundation formed in
1968 by Ron and Phyllis
Patterson to perpetuate interest
and involvement in the Medieval

and Renaissance period.
The faire has run on weekends
since August 24th, and this
weekend is its last for the season.
Entrance fee is $4, which includes
all of the shows inside.
To reach the Faire, take
Highway 101 North of San
Francisco to Highway 37. Then
drive east for one mile to the
Black Point Exit.

400 YEARS LATE — The Queen of the Renaissance Faire in Marin County receives a late message from

400 YEARS LATE — The Queen of the Renaissance Faire in Marin County receives a late message from
one of her messengers. Although her costume is obviously one of the most elaborate at the fair, spectators
and participants come to the fair dressed in all sorts of regalia from the Elizabethan era. This is the last
weekend that the fair is going on in Northern California.
Shabbily dressed in a
gunnysack and tights, a ruffian
was forcefully holding a young
damsel in front of a bakery.
"Want a piece of Lorraine?" he
cried lustily to the passerbys.
Instantaneously attracting the
attention of the crowd, he smiled
and added . . quiche Lorraine,
.that is."
Such is the frolic and fun of
the Renaissance Faire.
Nestled in a oak forest in Marin
county, the Renaissance Pleasure
Faire offers the visitor a glimpse
of an old English market place,
400 years removed. Sights, sounds
and smells of merry old England
rebound throughout the colorful
setting, winding in and out of the
tree-lined paths.
An authentic re-creation of
16th century rural fairs in
England, the Pleasure Faire
features over 500 entertainers
who offer almost continuous
entertainment with all the pomp,
pageantry and color of Medieval
and Renaissance times.
Craftsmen and chefs display
their works in little booths, while
hucksters sing and call to visitors
to buy their wares. Barkers plead
with passerbys to "dunk a
wench," or "bowl a troll" while
other booths offer archery,
jousting and rope ladder climbing.
The language of the fairs
always includes "M'Lord and
M'Lady" and signs declare that
one must show a "Coachman's
license" before buying ale or
ginger beer.
Troubadors, mimes, jugglers,
magicians and puppeters rove
constantly throughout the
grounds, offering short shows
with varied routines. The mimes
were exceptional and jugglers even
give lessons. Harpists, guitarists
and other musicians display their
talents from various nooks and
tree branches.
The faire opens at 10 a.m. to
the sounds of horns and ringing
market bells. At noon there is a
harvest home procession, where
the crowd gathers at the Ben
Johnson stage to watch songs,
dances and plays of the period.
The Queen visits her subjects at
3 p.m., making her way through
the faire to the main theater
where she hears petitions from her
subjects and proclaims new laws.
She too is entertained by the Lord
Mayor and other musicians,
dancers and actors.
Visitors are advised to come in
costume, and although only half
of the crowd complies with this
idea, the crowd is part of the
show. Men appear in gunny sacks
turned into make-shift tunics,
while woman often put together

long skirts and gowns. The
messengers push through
masses of people, yelling "Make
way, I'm on the Queen's
business," while young girls rush
up to spectators, urging them to
try new herbal snuff.
The only evidence that the
20th century exists are the paper
cups used for cold drinks. There is
no electricity, lights or (heaven
forbid) motors or autos. Cars are
parked sufficiently far away and
are well hidden. Instead, one is
filled with natural noises of

bawdy folk, merriment and frolic.

Faire is bursting with energy and
authenticity, yet is almost
