# How Blue Can You Get?
## Eubie Blake Shows Class 
### 
Dan Forte

SAN FRANCISCO - The
Great American Music Hall was
the scene of an extremely rare
musical event last Sunday, Sept.
22, when two of this country's
most overlooked idions were
presented in a concert of solo
piano.
Representing ragtime was the
91-year-old phenomenon Eubie
Blake, who has been playing and
composing rags since the turn of
the century.
Preceeding Blake was a much
younger pianist, Mike Lipskin,
who specializes in an even more
obscure piano form, the Harlem
"stride" style developed by men
like James P. Johnson, Fats Waller
and Willie "The Lion" Smith, who
Lipskin studied under.
With the recent deaths of "The
Lion" and"The Duke," who was
also mainly a strider, Lipskin is
one of the few pianists alive
performing this type of music.
Lipskin made it immediately
known who his biggest idol is by
playing two James P. Johnson
tunes, "Snowy Morning Blues,"
and "Carolina Shout." Also
included were three Fats Waller
numbers.
Lipskin, backed only by the
brushwork of Sam Shafer on snare
drum, sang on nearly half the
selections, in a fairly unmelodic
voice, but any shortcomings in his
vocal talents can be overlooked,
since it was a stride piano set, and
that he did wonderfully.
Several Lipskin originals were
included, the best of which was
"Am I Blue," a tongue-twister
with lines like "Love's residue has
got me blue."
Lipskin closed by showing his
respect for his colleague for the

I
evening, playing Eubie's "If
You've Never Been Vamped By A
Brownskin, You've Never Been
Vamped At All."
Shortly thereafter, the amazing
Mr. Blake took the stage, hands
clasped over his head like a prize
fighter, and sat down at the piano
for an hour of rags and
reminiscing.
Like Lipskin, Blake introduced
each number with a bit of
information about its composer,
when it was written, etc. so the
whole show was like a lesson in
American piano styles.
Blake began with his
ever-famous "Charleston Rag,"
which he composed in 1899 at the
age of 16. This was followed by
his own "Classical Rag," and a
conglomeration — not a medley,
but a conglomeration — of George
Gershwin's "The Man I Love" and
"Rhapsody in Blue."
Ragtime and stride both being
very difficult two-handed styles,
Eubie made mention of Lipskin's
adept left hand saying, "If you
leave the bass out, the chords are
sitting in midair." He then
demonstrated the way piano was
played when he was young as
opposed to the way it is played
now, and the difference was
surely an eye-opener to any young
keyboard players in the crowd,
which, by the way, was standing
room only.
Blake, too, paid tribute to
James P. with a medley of
"Charleston Dance," "Old
Fashioned Love" and "If I Could
Be With You One Hour Tonight."
His biggest tribute, though, was
to Scott Joplin, who he referred
to as "The Master of Us All"
several times. His two Joplin
selections were "Maple Leaf Rag"

and "Elite Syncopation."
At a time when the music of
Scott Joplin is being played by
everyone from classical composers
like Joshua Rifkin to movie
scorers like Marvin Hamlisch —
each in a different interpretation
— it was nice to hear Joplin's rags
played by someone who grew up
in the same era. And don't let
Eubie's 91 years fool you; his
fingers are as agile as a teenager's.
Along with Noble Sissle, Eubie
Blake wrote the music to many
Broadway shows, the most
famous of which was "Shuffle
Along," which he recalled in a
medley topped off by "I'm Just
Wild About Harry."
After his most famous
composition of all, "Memories of
You," Eubie was easily persuaded
to return for an encore with his
rousing ragtime version of "Stars
and Stripes Forever."
Hopefully, the large,
enthusiastic crowds at the Great
American Music Hall will persuade
other clubs to book similar acts.
This weekend G.A.M.H.
presents jazz immortal Dizzy
Gillespie, tonight; and pianist
Hampton Hawes, tomorrow night.
