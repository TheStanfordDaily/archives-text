# Financial Loss, Low Enrollment May Close Tours Study Center
## 
### GORDON FIRESTEIN 
Low enrollment is costing the Tours Studies Center in
France nearly $20,000 and may force its closure, Overseas
Studies officials said yesterday.
Only 28 students are currently participating in a
program designed for 80 and officials are reevaluating the
center.
Closing it "has to be considered one of the possibilities,"
said Corbin Smith, assistant director of Overseas Studies.
But he added less drastic measures are also under
consideration.
Overseas Studies is interviewing students who have
attended the Tours campus, those who plan to and faculty
members who have taught there in an attempt to find out
what's wrong.
The Overseas Studies staff expects to reach a decision by
the end of the quarter, Assoc. Director Don Price said.
The Overseas Studies staff is eager to achieve "a more
reasonable financial situation there," Smith said. The
problem, he added, "needs to be resolved fairly soon."
The urgency derives from the "considerable financial
loss" absorbed by the University because of the low
enrollment, Smith said.
Stanford has contracted with the French government for
use of the study facility, as well as ancillary services. The
contract provides for a minimum guarantee based on full
enrollment — the University pays for house staff, maids,
and meals for 80 students regardless of actual enrollment.

Smith said retaining the present Tours location is the
"least likely" of the alternatives under consideration by the
Overseas Studies staff.
After the University makes a decision about the Center,
it will renegotiate its contract with the Centre National des
Ouevres Universitaires et Scolaires, a public corporation
owned by the French government.
Any new contract could take effect July 1.
At present, Stanford is obligated to pay the $136,080 a
year for room and board services at the Tours facility.
Students pay Stanford $508 each for a quarter's room and
board.
With 28 students enrolled, and Stanford committed to
pay for services for 80 students, the Tours program will lose
nearly $20,000 this quarter.
The situation is complicated by the fluctuating foreign
exchange rate. Stanford receives room and board fees in
U.S. dollars, but must pay the French in francs. A
disadvantageous exchange rate has increased the program's
costs, Overseas Studies Director Mark Mancall said.
Reform of the Tours program will depend on the
outcome of the negotiations this December. The program
could continue at the present facility, be moved elsewhere
in Tours or France.
Mancall said no changes will be made until next summer
and that permanent elimination of the program in France is
not anticipated.

Low enrollment is costing the Tours Studies Center in
France nearly $20,000 and may force its closure, Overseas
Studies officials said yesterday.
Only 28 students are currently participating in a
program designed for 80 and officials are reevaluating the
center.
Closing it "has to be considered one of the possibilities,"
said Corbin Smith, assistant director of Overseas Studies.
But he added less drastic measures are also under
consideration.
Overseas Studies is interviewing students who have
attended the Tours campus, those who plan to and faculty
members who have taught there in an attempt to find out
what's wrong.
The Overseas Studies staff expects to reach a decision by
the end of the quarter, Assoc. Director Don Price said.
The Overseas Studies staff is eager to achieve "a more
reasonable financial situation there," Smith said. The
problem, he added, "needs to be resolved fairly soon."
The urgency derives from the "considerable financial
loss" absorbed by the University because of the low
enrollment, Smith said.
Stanford has contracted with the French government for
use of the study facility, as well as ancillary services. The
contract provides for a minimum guarantee based on full
enrollment — the University pays for house staff, maids,
and meals for 80 students regardless of actual enrollment.

Smith said retaining the present Tours location is the
"least likely" of the alternatives under consideration by the
Overseas Studies staff.
After the University makes a decision about the Center,
it will renegotiate its contract with the Centre National des
Ouevres Universitaires et Scolaires, a public corporation
owned by the French government.
Any new contract could take effect July 1.
At present, Stanford is obligated to pay the $136,080 a
year for room and board services at the Tours facility.
Students pay Stanford $508 each for a quarter's room and
board.
With 28 students enrolled, and Stanford committed to
pay for services for 80 students, the Tours program will lose
nearly $20,000 this quarter.
The situation is complicated by the fluctuating foreign
exchange rate. Stanford receives room and board fees in
U.S. dollars, but must pay the French in francs. A
disadvantageous exchange rate has increased the program's
costs, Overseas Studies Director Mark Mancall said.
Reform of the Tours program will depend on the
outcome of the negotiations this December. The program
could continue at the present facility, be moved elsewhere
in Tours or France.
Mancall said no changes will be made until next summer
and that permanent elimination of the program in France is
not anticipated.
