## Lacy Atkinson: 27-Year-Old Ex-Marine Not Out Of Place 
### CHRIS BAKER 
The little boy waiting for autographs outside the Stanford football
training quarters saw the tall, muscular, man approach the entrance to
the training quarters.
"Hi coach, when are the players coming out?" asked the hero
worshipper. "I'm a player," replied the man. It's a common mistake.
Lacy Atkinson doesn't really look like he should be playing
football. Atkinson, 27, has the look of a Marine drill instructor turned
football coach, with his close cropped hair and booming voice.
But Atkinson is a football player. Ask Penn State quarterback Tom
Shuman. Playing in relief of nose guard Drew Palin, Atkinson hurried
Shuman into throwing his second interception of the day.
One usually finds a 27-year-old football player in the professional
ranks, not on the Farm. But Atkinson isn't a normal case.
He spent six years in the Marine Corps, two of them in Vietnam,
where he earned a Purple Heart. "I really consider myself lucky to
have come out of 'Nam alive. I was there during one of the hottest
periods of the war. I saw quite a few of my friends being killed,"
Atkinson said.
Lacy was awarded the Purple Heart for his actions during a
campaign in the DMZ where he received a shrapnel wound. "I was just
trying to get out of there. I didn't try to be a hero. I just took things
one day at a time and I made it out of there," Atkinson said.
Atkinson doesn't harbor any malice toward those who refused to
serve in the war. "I think they're the real heroes. They listened to
their consciences. I didn't really want to go there either, but I was just
a kid then. I think that we should welcome them back with a

handshake," Atkinson said.
He's come a long way from his
native Farmdale, N.C. "I always
wanted an education, but I
wanted to be independent. My
family was really poor, so the
service was about the only choice
that I had," Atkinson said.
First Goal
"I came to the Coast because
of the opportunities available
here. When I first got here I was
really amazed. When I was coming
up I didn't see a football until I
was in the sixth grade," said
Atkinson. "But my first goal was
getting an education."
He became involved in football
because of the challenge it
presented. "A lot of dudes just sit
around the tube on Sunday
watching football and say, ho
that's easy. I thought I could do it
and I don't like to pay lip service
to anything, I like to go out and
do it,"he said.
Atkinson, a junior college
transfer from San Mateo JC,
credits San Mateo coach Steve
Schaffer with making him a top
caliber athlete.
"I always felt that I could play
football with the best. But I set
my goals one at a time. My first
one was to play on a MC
champion," said Atkinson. He
realized this goal last year when
he started for San Mateo.
Many JC transfers find
academic life on the Farm very
different from junior college, but
not Atkinson. "I think we have a
very good academic system here.
Student, Not System
"But I still think that the
student, not the system makes an
education. About 80 percent of
your education is what you put
into it. If you don't put anything
into it you don't get anything out
of it," Atkinson said, an
anthropology/archelogy major.
Although he doesn't
participate in the social life at
Stanford, he is amazed at the
variety of activities available here.
"This place is a country club.
There's just so much to do here,"
said Atkinson.
Many people who are 27 would
hesitate to participate in college
atheletics but Lacy feels that he's
still in his prime. "I feel I'm in top
condition. A lot of people just get
set to die after they reach their
25th birthday, but not me," said
Atkinson.
No Trouble
He doesn't have any trouble
relating to his teammates, some of
whom look to him for advice.
Among them is All-American
defensive end Roger Stillwell.
"He's more of a leader since he's
older and more knowledgeable.
He really helps us out a lot," said
Stillwell.
Atkinson seems to have turned
Stanford practices into a camp.
Yesterday he resembled a Marine
drill instructor when he led the
defensive linemen in drills. "Make
it feel good," said Atkinson as he

led his teammates in stretching
drills. He seemed indefatigable,
doing about twice as much work
as the rest of the defensive line.
His exploits have earned him
the nickname— Six Million Dollar
Man. "He's just a machine. He
does some of the drills like a
machine," said Stillwell.
Defensive line coach Gunther
Cunningham had nothing but
praise for Atkinson. "He's our Six
Million . Dollar Man," said
Cunningham. Lacy is just so much
more mature. He's been a big plus
for us this year," said
Cunningham.
Football For Fun
But Atkinson hasn't let these

words of praise go to his head.
"I'm just happy to play on this
team with people who'll probably
go into pro football. I don't want
to play in the pros. I play football
because it's fun," said Atkinson.
Some players set their goals far
in advance but Lacy is an
exception. "I just take things one
day at a time, one goal a day. My
goal is to get through the day,"
Atkinson said.
"My philosophy follows
something Robert Kennedy said.
'Some see things that never were
and wonder why. I see things and
wonder why not.' I really think I
can do anything if I put my mind
to it."

their consciences. I didn't really want to go there either, but I was just
a kid then. I think that we should welcome them back with a

handshake," Atkinson said.
He's come a long way from his
native Farmdale, N.C. "I always
wanted an education, but I
wanted to be independent. My
family was really poor, so the
service was about the only choice
that I had," Atkinson said.
First Goal
"I came to the Coast because
of the opportunities available
here. When I first got here I was
really amazed. When I was coming
up I didn't see a football until I
was in the sixth grade," said
Atkinson. "But my first goal was
getting an education."
He became involved in football
because of the challenge it
presented. "A lot of dudes just sit
around the tube on Sunday
watching football and say, ho
that's easy. I thought I could do it
and I don't like to pay lip service
to anything, I like to go out and
do it,"he said.
Atkinson, a junior college
transfer from San Mateo JC,
credits San Mateo coach Steve
Schaffer with making him a top
caliber athlete.
"I always felt that I could play
football with the best. But I set
my goals one at a time. My first
one was to play on a MC
champion," said Atkinson. He
realized this goal last year when
he started for San Mateo.
Many JC transfers find
academic life on the Farm very
different from junior college, but
not Atkinson. "I think we have a
very good academic system here.
Student, Not System
"But I still think that the
student, not the system makes an
education. About 80 percent of
your education is what you put
into it. If you don't put anything
into it you don't get anything out
of it," Atkinson said, an
anthropology/archelogy major.
Although he doesn't
participate in the social life at
Stanford, he is amazed at the
variety of activities available here.
"This place is a country club.
There's just so much to do here,"
said Atkinson.
Many people who are 27 would
hesitate to participate in college
atheletics but Lacy feels that he's
still in his prime. "I feel I'm in top
condition. A lot of people just get
set to die after they reach their
25th birthday, but not me," said
Atkinson.
No Trouble
He doesn't have any trouble
relating to his teammates, some of
whom look to him for advice.
Among them is All-American
defensive end Roger Stillwell.
"He's more of a leader since he's
older and more knowledgeable.
He really helps us out a lot," said
Stillwell.
Atkinson seems to have turned
Stanford practices into a camp.
Yesterday he resembled a Marine
drill instructor when he led the
defensive linemen in drills. "Make
it feel good," said Atkinson as he

led his teammates in stretching
drills. He seemed indefatigable,
doing about twice as much work
as the rest of the defensive line.
His exploits have earned him
the nickname— Six Million Dollar
Man. "He's just a machine. He
does some of the drills like a
machine," said Stillwell.
Defensive line coach Gunther
Cunningham had nothing but
praise for Atkinson. "He's our Six
Million . Dollar Man," said
Cunningham. Lacy is just so much
more mature. He's been a big plus
for us this year," said
Cunningham.
Football For Fun
But Atkinson hasn't let these

words of praise go to his head.
"I'm just happy to play on this
team with people who'll probably
go into pro football. I don't want
to play in the pros. I play football
because it's fun," said Atkinson.
Some players set their goals far
in advance but Lacy is an
exception. "I just take things one
day at a time, one goal a day. My
goal is to get through the day,"
Atkinson said.
"My philosophy follows
something Robert Kennedy said.
'Some see things that never were
and wonder why. I see things and
wonder why not.' I really think I
can do anything if I put my mind
to it."

Lacy Atkinson
The little boy waiting for autographs outside the Stanford football
training quarters saw the tall, muscular, man approach the entrance to
the training quarters.
"Hi coach, when are the players coming out?" asked the hero
worshipper. "I'm a player," replied the man. It's a common mistake.
Lacy Atkinson doesn't really look like he should be playing
football. Atkinson, 27, has the look of a Marine drill instructor turned
football coach, with his close cropped hair and booming voice.
But Atkinson is a football player. Ask Penn State quarterback Tom
Shuman. Playing in relief of nose guard Drew Palin, Atkinson hurried
Shuman into throwing his second interception of the day.
One usually finds a 27-year-old football player in the professional
ranks, not on the Farm. But Atkinson isn't a normal case.
He spent six years in the Marine Corps, two of them in Vietnam,
where he earned a Purple Heart. "I really consider myself lucky to
have come out of 'Nam alive. I was there during one of the hottest
periods of the war. I saw quite a few of my friends being killed,"
Atkinson said.
Lacy was awarded the Purple Heart for his actions during a
campaign in the DMZ where he received a shrapnel wound. "I was just
trying to get out of there. I didn't try to be a hero. I just took things
one day at a time and I made it out of there," Atkinson said.
Atkinson doesn't harbor any malice toward those who refused to
serve in the war. "I think they're the real heroes. They listened to

different from junior college, but
not Atkinson. "I think we have a
very good academic system here.
Student, Not System
"But I still think that the
student, not the system makes an
education. About 80 percent of
your education is what you put
into it. If you don't put anything
into it you don't get anything out
of it," Atkinson said, an
anthropology/archelogy major.
Although he doesn't
participate in the social life at
Stanford, he is amazed at the
variety of activities available here.
"This place is a country club.
There's just so much to do here,"
said Atkinson.
Many people who are 27 would
hesitate to participate in college
atheletics but Lacy feels that he's
still in his prime. "I feel I'm in top
condition. A lot of people just get
set to die after they reach their
25th birthday, but not me," said
Atkinson.
No Trouble
He doesn't have any trouble
relating to his teammates, some of
whom look to him for advice.
Among them is All-American
defensive end Roger Stillwell.
"He's more of a leader since he's
older and more knowledgeable.
He really helps us out a lot," said
Stillwell.
Atkinson seems to have turned
Stanford practices into a camp.
Yesterday he resembled a Marine
drill instructor when he led the
defensive linemen in drills. "Make
it feel good," said Atkinson as he

led his teammates in stretching
drills. He seemed indefatigable,
doing about twice as much work
as the rest of the defensive line.
His exploits have earned him
the nickname— Six Million Dollar
Man. "He's just a machine. He
does some of the drills like a
machine," said Stillwell.
Defensive line coach Gunther
Cunningham had nothing but
praise for Atkinson. "He's our Six
Million . Dollar Man," said
Cunningham. Lacy is just so much
more mature. He's been a big plus
for us this year," said
Cunningham.
Football For Fun
But Atkinson hasn't let these

words of praise go to his head.
"I'm just happy to play on this
team with people who'll probably
go into pro football. I don't want
to play in the pros. I play football
because it's fun," said Atkinson.
Some players set their goals far
in advance but Lacy is an
exception. "I just take things one
day at a time, one goal a day. My
goal is to get through the day,"
Atkinson said.
"My philosophy follows
something Robert Kennedy said.
'Some see things that never were
and wonder why. I see things and
wonder why not.' I really think I
can do anything if I put my mind
to it."

Lacy Atkinson
The little boy waiting for autographs outside the Stanford football
training quarters saw the tall, muscular, man approach the entrance to
the training quarters.
"Hi coach, when are the players coming out?" asked the hero
worshipper. "I'm a player," replied the man. It's a common mistake.
Lacy Atkinson doesn't really look like he should be playing
football. Atkinson, 27, has the look of a Marine drill instructor turned
football coach, with his close cropped hair and booming voice.
But Atkinson is a football player. Ask Penn State quarterback Tom
Shuman. Playing in relief of nose guard Drew Palin, Atkinson hurried
Shuman into throwing his second interception of the day.
One usually finds a 27-year-old football player in the professional
ranks, not on the Farm. But Atkinson isn't a normal case.
He spent six years in the Marine Corps, two of them in Vietnam,
where he earned a Purple Heart. "I really consider myself lucky to
have come out of 'Nam alive. I was there during one of the hottest
periods of the war. I saw quite a few of my friends being killed,"
Atkinson said.
Lacy was awarded the Purple Heart for his actions during a
campaign in the DMZ where he received a shrapnel wound. "I was just
trying to get out of there. I didn't try to be a hero. I just took things
one day at a time and I made it out of there," Atkinson said.
Atkinson doesn't harbor any malice toward those who refused to
serve in the war. "I think they're the real heroes. They listened to
their consciences. I didn't really want to go there either, but I was just
a kid then. I think that we should welcome them back with a

handshake," Atkinson said.
He's come a long way from his
native Farmdale, N.C. "I always
wanted an education, but I
wanted to be independent. My
family was really poor, so the
service was about the only choice
that I had," Atkinson said.
First Goal
"I came to the Coast because
of the opportunities available
here. When I first got here I was
really amazed. When I was coming
up I didn't see a football until I
was in the sixth grade," said
Atkinson. "But my first goal was
getting an education."
He became involved in football
because of the challenge it
presented. "A lot of dudes just sit
around the tube on Sunday
watching football and say, ho
that's easy. I thought I could do it
and I don't like to pay lip service
to anything, I like to go out and
do it,"he said.
Atkinson, a junior college
transfer from San Mateo JC,
credits San Mateo coach Steve
Schaffer with making him a top
caliber athlete.
"I always felt that I could play
football with the best. But I set
my goals one at a time. My first
one was to play on a MC
champion," said Atkinson. He
realized this goal last year when
he started for San Mateo.
Many JC transfers find
academic life on the Farm very
different from junior college, but
not Atkinson. "I think we have a
very good academic system here.
