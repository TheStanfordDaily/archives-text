# It Won't Be Easy, But...
## Cards Need First Victory Over SJS 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The purpose of this article is to
preview the Stanford-San Jose
State game, reminding you that
the Spartans can't be taken lightly
and could well defeat the
Cardinals.
All of which is true.
But no matter how good San
Jose is, if Stanford loses its third
straight tomorrow, the
40,000-plus fans will walk out of
the Stadium saying "Stanford
stinks."
Which would also, probably, be
true.
The Spartans do have a fine
football team, with several
potential All-Coast players. But
they still aren't nearly the football

team Stanford should be.
So there's a lot of pressure on
the Cardinals, for if they can't win
tomorrow's game, how can they
be expected to have a chance later
in the year?
Stanford has practiced inside
the walls of the Stadium the past
three days, presumably to work
on new wrinkles for the game,
which begins at 1:30 and will be
carried live over KNEW (910).
KZSU FM (90.1) will offer a
highlights show at 10 p.m.
On offense, Stanford will have
two lineup switches from last
week. Gary Anderson will start at
guard ahead of Tom Tipton,
while, as was long-ago decided,

Mike Cordova will start at
quarterback, rather than Guy
Benjamin, who got the nod last
week.
"It's good to know we're going
against their starter," SJS coach
Darryl Rogers said of the Card
quarterback situation. Last week,
Illinois was ired that Benjamin
started.
No changes in the defensive
starting alignment are planned.
Lacy Atkinson could get the nod
at middle guard, however, since
Drew Palin has a back injury.
The defense had disappointed
in the Cards first two games.
Linebacker Forrie Martin said
yesterday that "maybe San Jose

will come at us with a very
unusual offense and beat the hell
out of us, but looking at it now,
we'll be in great shape."
The Spartan offense Stanford
will come up against is, much like
Stanford's, primarily a passing
one. San Jose is led by Craig
Kimball, an outstanding
quarterback who thus far has
completed 42 of 81 passes for 519
yards.
Kimball has several of fine
receivers. Most famous is Ike
Mcßee, a 6-foot sprinter who
a year ago caught five passes
against Stanford and a year from
now will be playing pro football.
If the defense worries too
much about Mcßee, however,
they'll get burned by flanker Mike
Hopkins. And then there's tight
end Dan Prager, who has caught
three touchdown passes so far.
They'll give Stanford's
inexperienced secondary a rugged
test.
When San Jose moves the ball
on the ground, it'll normally be
via one of the two tailbacks, Steve
Bruce and Marv Stewart. In
Rogers' system, the fullback is
most often used for blocking.
The Spartans' defense is also
tough. Cal coach Mike White,
sighing with relief after his Bears
beat San Jose by one point last
week, said "They're the first team
we've played that could stop our
power sweep."
The biggest threat on defense is
weak side end Dave Wasick. His
teammates call him "animal."
What his opponents call him is
unprintable, but most of them
probably wish they'd have a
referee specifically assigned to
watch him. Tomorrow, he'll try to
prove he's in the same class as
Stanford's Roger Stillwell and Pat
Donovan.
The Spartan linebacking crew
is also a tough one, though a
pinched nerve may hamper one
star with the likely name of Larry
Zajonc.
As we said, San Jose State,
which rolled over S*' Clara
(47-10) and Fresno Stale (28-7) is
a very good football team, better
than the 17-point underdog status
would indicate.
One prediction service even
predicted a Spartan victory. And
there'll be plenty of San Jose
rooters who 11 make the freeway
trek tomorrow.
Martin has said, "We could go
undefeated for the rest of the
season or we could have a very
bad season, depending upon how
well we're willing to put out."
If the Cards don't put out
tomorrow, it'll probably be a
very, very bad season.

The Spartans do have a fine
football team, with several
potential All-Coast players. But
they still aren't nearly the football

team Stanford should be.
So there's a lot of pressure on
the Cardinals, for if they can't win
tomorrow's game, how can they
be expected to have a chance later
in the year?
Stanford has practiced inside
the walls of the Stadium the past
three days, presumably to work
on new wrinkles for the game,
which begins at 1:30 and will be
carried live over KNEW (910).
KZSU FM (90.1) will offer a
highlights show at 10 p.m.
On offense, Stanford will have
two lineup switches from last
week. Gary Anderson will start at
guard ahead of Tom Tipton,
while, as was long-ago decided,

Mike Cordova will start at
quarterback, rather than Guy
Benjamin, who got the nod last
week.
"It's good to know we're going
against their starter," SJS coach
Darryl Rogers said of the Card
quarterback situation. Last week,
Illinois was ired that Benjamin
started.
No changes in the defensive
starting alignment are planned.
Lacy Atkinson could get the nod
at middle guard, however, since
Drew Palin has a back injury.
The defense had disappointed
in the Cards first two games.
Linebacker Forrie Martin said
yesterday that "maybe San Jose

will come at us with a very
unusual offense and beat the hell
out of us, but looking at it now,
we'll be in great shape."
The Spartan offense Stanford
will come up against is, much like
Stanford's, primarily a passing
one. San Jose is led by Craig
Kimball, an outstanding
quarterback who thus far has
completed 42 of 81 passes for 519
yards.
Kimball has several of fine
receivers. Most famous is Ike
Mcßee, a 6-foot sprinter who
a year ago caught five passes
against Stanford and a year from
now will be playing pro football.
If the defense worries too
much about Mcßee, however,
they'll get burned by flanker Mike
Hopkins. And then there's tight
end Dan Prager, who has caught
three touchdown passes so far.
They'll give Stanford's
inexperienced secondary a rugged
test.
When San Jose moves the ball
on the ground, it'll normally be
via one of the two tailbacks, Steve
Bruce and Marv Stewart. In
Rogers' system, the fullback is
most often used for blocking.
The Spartans' defense is also
tough. Cal coach Mike White,
sighing with relief after his Bears
beat San Jose by one point last
week, said "They're the first team
we've played that could stop our
power sweep."
The biggest threat on defense is
weak side end Dave Wasick. His
teammates call him "animal."
What his opponents call him is
unprintable, but most of them
probably wish they'd have a
referee specifically assigned to
watch him. Tomorrow, he'll try to
prove he's in the same class as
Stanford's Roger Stillwell and Pat
Donovan.
The Spartan linebacking crew
is also a tough one, though a
pinched nerve may hamper one
star with the likely name of Larry
Zajonc.
As we said, San Jose State,
which rolled over S*' Clara
(47-10) and Fresno Stale (28-7) is
a very good football team, better
than the 17-point underdog status
would indicate.
One prediction service even
predicted a Spartan victory. And
there'll be plenty of San Jose
rooters who 11 make the freeway
trek tomorrow.
Martin has said, "We could go
undefeated for the rest of the
season or we could have a very
bad season, depending upon how
well we're willing to put out."
If the Cards don't put out
tomorrow, it'll probably be a
very, very bad season.
The purpose of this article is to
preview the Stanford-San Jose
State game, reminding you that
the Spartans can't be taken lightly
and could well defeat the
Cardinals.
All of which is true.
But no matter how good San
Jose is, if Stanford loses its third
straight tomorrow, the
40,000-plus fans will walk out of
the Stadium saying "Stanford
stinks."

true.
