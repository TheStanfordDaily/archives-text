# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
Last season's Daily fearless
football forecaster produced a
peerless prognostication
percentage of .860, with a
36-7-1 record.
Unfortunately, he has since
disappeared, never being seen
since forecasting that
Stanford's basketball team
would win every game it
played against foes who
weren't UCLA.
This year, we have a more
fearful forecaster, a Woody
Allen type whose fingers
tremble upon putting the magic
scores on paper. Here goes
nothing. . . .
Stanford ought to recover
and beat San Jose State. If the
Cards play as they did against
Illinois, they'd get beat by two
touchdowns, but the team
simply couldn't be that bad.
We hope.
Cat, meanwhile, ought to
whomp Army. Actually, the
Army has a better team this
year. Last season, the football
team was even less effective
than their teammates had been
in Vietnam.
USC visits Pitt in the battle
between A.D. West (Anthony
Davis) and A.D. East (Anthony
Dorsett). A.D. East is probably
a better football player, but

USC has the better team.
In the week's most
interesting game, Michigan
State visits UCLA. By any
objective measurement of past
performance, the Spartans
should win. But UCLA is
probably the better football
team.
In the great Northwest,
Texas A&M visits the league's
only unbeaten team,
Washington. The Aggies ought
to show the Huskies how bad a
football team Washington
really has.
Cardinal fans probably hope
Illinois kills Washington State
in this week's TV game, just so
the home team won't look so
bad. The lllini should win, all
right, but it'll be a lot closer
than last week's game.
Finally (since Oregon State
has wisely scheduled a week to
heal after being clobbered by
Ohio State) Oregon visits Utah.
A toss-up, the edge goes to the
Ducks.
