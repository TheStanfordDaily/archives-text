# Don't Ignore Stanford Soccer!
## 
### DAN PYNE 
Stanford soccer, like soccer all
over the United States, receives
little publicity on campus.
Perhaps this could be justified by
contending that the Stanford
soccer team isn't any good
anyway. But the team is pretty
good.
Last year it was 11-4 and
placed third in the West Coast
Intercollegiate Soccer Conference.
And head coach Fred Priddle
thinks the team will do even
better this year. "We could go
pretty near all the way," he said
in an interview before
Wednesday's game with
Westmont. "We could get into the
NCAA regional playoffs."
In order to get there Stanford
will have to do away with
Westmont, who they tied 0-0
Wednesday, San Jose State, USF,
UCLA, Santa • Clara and Chico
State.
Priddle has nine returning
varsity lettermen to anchor this

year's squad, seniors Bruce
Mosbacher, William Ralston and
Richard Taylor, and juniors Mike
Kellogg, John Muraco, Walter
Robb, Jim Stokes, Richard Tylor
and Phil Wright.
Filling out the varsity are two
more seniors, two juniors, three
sophomores, and one freshman.
Priddle indicates that he may
juggle the varsity lineup as the
season progresses, moving up a
few junior varsity or freshman
players.

The Cardinal booters utilize a
4-3-3 attack — four fullbacks,
three halfbacks, and three
forwards — rather than a
conventional 2-3-5 set-up.
Priddle explained that the
4-3-3 is not as defensive as it may
appear; the center halfback serves
essentially as a forward on
kickoffs and when the play is
close to the opposing team's goal.
Tentatively, Priddle has Robert
Bonaparte, Edward Caldwell,

Glenn Cristofori, John Gross,
Richard Morrow, Murao and Skip
Pfeiffer at forwards; Marty
Glickfield, Charles Hall, Kellogg,
James Melamed, Ralston, Robb,
Stokes, Taylor and Wright as
backs, and Mosbacher in goal.
And (as if that isn't enough),
there are about 25 junior varsity
and 25 freshmen out this year as
well.
The Cardinals play Cal
tomorrow morning here at
Stanford.

WHO WANTS IT?—Stanford's Johnny Murao (7) and a UCLA player seem to twist away from the ball in
last year's game between the two teams. Murae a junior, returns this season at forward and is one reason
whv Stanford's soccer team is expecting an improved season.
