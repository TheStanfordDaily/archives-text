# IM Roundup
## New Year 
### PETE BHATIA 
Another excitement-packed
year of intramural sports gets
under way Monday with the
opening of regular season play in
touch football and two-player
volleyball. Teams can still enter in
those or any of the other eight fall
sports through 5 p.m. today.
Other fall events include tennis
doubles, pocket billiards, bowling,
basketball free throws, cross
country, wrestling and golf.
Wrestling will be held in the fall
for the first time this year. It
normally is a winter event.
Bowling will also be in a league
format. Three-man teams with
handicaps will be employed in the
daily leagues. The remaining
sports will be single elimination
tourneys, with the exception of
the one-day wrestling and cross
country events. They are both set
during October.
Tomorrow at halftime of the
San Jose State-Stanford football
extravaganza Theta Delta Chi will
receive the 1973-74 Intramural
championship trophy. The Theta
Delts set a record for most IM
points scored in a year last season
in winning their third IM title in a
row.
The last time any organization
accomplished that feat was
between 1949 and 1952 when
Sigma Chi captured three titles.
