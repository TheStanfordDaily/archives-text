# OAW Holds Initial Meeting
## 
### TRACY REYNOLDS 
The newly-formed
Organization of Stanford Women
Athletes (OSA) held its first
meeting in the women's clubhouse
Tuesday evening.
Co-ordinator Terry Holchers
explained the group's three-fold
purpose to those persons present.
First, the OSA wants to make the
student body and Administration
aware of present inadequacies in
women's P.E. facilities and
equipment, intercollegiate
competition, coaching and, most
importantly, funding. The OSA
plans to work with the
Administration and men's and
women's P.E. departments in
order to correct these
inadequacies.
Second, a group of women
athletes intend to form teams in
sports such as volleyball, track
and crew, which at present, are
not offered for women.
Finally, OSA hopes to
strengthen the sports now offered
for women on the intramural,
club sport and intercollegiate
levels.
After discussion of these goals,
the athletes formed into groups of
women wishing to participate in
various sports. Each group
appointed a team representative.
The representatives plan to meet

as a body to form the leadership
of the OSA.
In all, 180 women filled out a
questionnaire which was
distributed at registration, and
OSA founders believe this
indicates that women on this
campus, particularly incoming
freshman, want changes in the
athletic department.
"I was amazed to learn that
track isn't offered for women,"
one freshman said.
The OSA has one thing in its
favor — Title 9 of the Educational
Amendments Act of 1972. One
portion of the act states "No
person shall, on the basis of sex,
be excluded from participation in,
be denied the benefits of, or be
treated differently from another
person, or otherwise be
discriminated against in any
physical education or athletic
program operated by recipient fof
government aide].
Guidelines for enforcement of
this rule are currently being
formulated. Until they are
established, the women athletes
believe they have a long, hard

fight ahead of them.
The OSA says it wants women
"to be on an equal footing with
men." In sports such as crew,
however, they may have to settle
for little or no funds, and next to
no publicity, as the men have.
Thus, the OSA believes it can
work with men athletes in minor
sports, for the benefit of all.
The OSA's next meeting will
be Oct. 8, and all interested
persons are urged to attend.
Meanwhile, questions can be
referred to the women's center,
497-3114.

strengthen the sports now offered
for women on the intramural,
club sport and intercollegiate
levels.
After discussion of these goals,
the athletes formed into groups of
women wishing to participate in
various sports. Each group
appointed a team representative.
The representatives plan to meet

as a body to form the leadership
of the OSA.
In all, 180 women filled out a
questionnaire which was
distributed at registration, and
OSA founders believe this
indicates that women on this
campus, particularly incoming
freshman, want changes in the
athletic department.
"I was amazed to learn that
track isn't offered for women,"
one freshman said.
The OSA has one thing in its
favor — Title 9 of the Educational
Amendments Act of 1972. One
portion of the act states "No
person shall, on the basis of sex,
be excluded from participation in,
be denied the benefits of, or be
treated differently from another
person, or otherwise be
discriminated against in any
physical education or athletic
program operated by recipient fof
government aide].
Guidelines for enforcement of
this rule are currently being
formulated. Until they are
established, the women athletes
believe they have a long, hard

fight ahead of them.
The OSA says it wants women
"to be on an equal footing with
men." In sports such as crew,
however, they may have to settle
for little or no funds, and next to
no publicity, as the men have.
Thus, the OSA believes it can
work with men athletes in minor
sports, for the benefit of all.
The OSA's next meeting will
be Oct. 8, and all interested
persons are urged to attend.
Meanwhile, questions can be
referred to the women's center,
497-3114.
The newly-formed
Organization of Stanford Women
Athletes (OSA) held its first
meeting in the women's clubhouse
Tuesday evening.
Co-ordinator Terry Holchers
explained the group's three-fold
purpose to those persons present.
First, the OSA wants to make the
student body and Administration
aware of present inadequacies in
women's P.E. facilities and
equipment, intercollegiate
competition, coaching and, most
importantly, funding. The OSA
plans to work with the
Administration and men's and
women's P.E. departments in
order to correct these
inadequacies.
Second, a group of women
athletes intend to form teams in
sports such as volleyball, track
and crew, which at present, are
not offered for women.
Finally, OSA hopes to
strengthen the sports now offered
for women on the intramural,
club sport and intercollegiate
levels.
