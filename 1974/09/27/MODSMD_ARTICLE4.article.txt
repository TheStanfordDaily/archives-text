# University Chooses Day Care Center Site
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
After months of wrangling,
University officials and the staff of
Stanford's cooperative child care
center have finally chosen a new site
for the center—and it could be
operating in the new location as early
as mid-October.
The center, which handles 125
children, will be relocated in a corner
of what used to be a soccer field, just
off Pampas Lane near the Credit
Union.
It will move to the quiet, wooded
area from its present quarters—the old
Stanford Elementary School, which is
being torn down to make way for an
apartment complex housing faculty,
staff and emeriti.
The University has agreed to fund
clearance of the area and the
construction of two buildings
comprised of 11 modular units of all
sizes at a cost of between $200,000
and $300,000, according to Edward E.
Shaw, executive assistant to the
Provost.
Interior Space
The buildings will contain more
than 5000 square feet of interior space
— comparable in size to the present
structure on Mayfield Avenue.
The first section of one of the
modules arrived yesterday, and Shaw
said he hoped the site would be ready
for occupancy by "mid- to mid-late
October."
Ironically, the new center, which
day care employees considered the
most desirable of several alternatives,
might end up costing less than the
original University offer that the
center occupy the vacant Ryan
Laboratory on Stanford Avenue.
"It was too difficult, not so much
in money as in time, to turn Ryan Lab
into a usable facility," Shaw said. Parts
of the laboratory are radioactive and
would have to be decontaminated. The
layout was considered unsuitable for a
child care facility.

Meanwhile, the University has
agreed to postpone the demolition of
the existing day care center, where
construction of the 82-unit emeriti
housing project will commence as soon
as possible, until the children can be
moved to the new site.
Allowing the existing center to
remain until the new site is ready will
prevent the center from having to
relocate twice, a move day care
employees vehemently opposed during
the months of deliberations on where
to move the center.
Delayed construction on the
emeriti housing project may increase
its eventual cost because winter rains
could cause further delay.
"We're taking a slight risk because
we don't want to move the center
twice," Shaw said. "We want a
significant amount of construction
before the rains come [and]
construction on the emeriti site may
be a week behind now."
'Not Optimistic'
However, Phyllis Craig, consultant
to the dean of student affairs, said
she's "not too optimistic" about
chances that the center can relocate by
the end of October.
Shaw called the new site ideal
because "it's not subject to other use
in the forseeable future and that's
healthy. The [present] May field site
would have been in a constant tussle
for extension of life" as other
proposed projects sought to occupy its
location.
Craig liked the new site because
"there's less traffic in the area.
Mayfield Avenue was getting to be
impossible."
"It's really nice to have a clean
building. And they're fairly
substantial. When you walk inside you
don't get the feeling the floor is giving
out under you," said center Director
Francis Roth.
"We're getting a building for which
we're not paying," Craig added. "We'd
be a lot happier if the University could
do the whole darn thing, though."
Another $17,000
She noted that the child care center
would have to raise $17,000 on its
own to help ready the grounds and
building for licensing under state rules.
The Dean of Student Affairs and
the Provost's office have committed a
$10,000 loan to the child care center
to pay for internal furnishings. The
buildings come equipped only with
plumbing, Craig said.
"Our budget would only take us so
far, and we loaned the children's
center the money in anticipation of
their fund-raising efforts," Shaw said.
Shaw noted the importance of
self-sufficiency of the child care center
as another reason for the requirement
that the loan be repaid.
Outdoor Expenses
But Craig says the child care center
must immediately raise another $7000
for outdoor necessities including large
swings, sand pits, covered areas for
rainy weather, and two playgrounds —
one for older, one for younger
children.
She said she could see the cost
rising above $7000 if the University
does not completely fund grounds
preparation for such facilities.

PLAY TIME- These workmen aren't exactly having fun, but 125 children from the University community will because of
what they're building. The new Stanford children's center is currently under construction on Pampas Lane near the Credit
Union.
