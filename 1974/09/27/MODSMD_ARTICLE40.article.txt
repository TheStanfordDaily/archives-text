# Cross Country Begins With Race For Positions
## 
### MIKE SHEPHERD 
Officially, the cross country
season opens tomorrow morning
at the Stanford Golf Course with
a meet against the West Valley TVack
Club and San Diego State.
For most runners, however, it
will instead be a hotly contested
intrasquad race. The meet will
mean a chance to break into the
lineup for next week's Fresno
State Invitational.
Behind the top three of Tony
Sandoval, Mark McConell and
Jack Bellah, there should be real
competition. Juniors Chris Berka,
Doug Mclean, Art Brown and
Alan Cummings and sophomores
Steve Crowley, Frank Boutin, Jeff
Norton and Jeff Parrietti will
battle for the remaining four
varsity spots with freshman
standouts Stacy Geiken and Pete
Witt.
Sandoval, the Stanford record
holder for the six-mile course and
the top Stanford finisher in the
Pacific Eight meet last year, is a
doubtful starter because of a foot
injury that kept him out of the
arly workouts.
He will be missed against West
Valley, led by Jim Dare, the
fourth place finisher in the 1972
Olympic Steeplechase trials and a
Stanford gradute student, and A 1
Sanford, a former Stanford
runner.
But from the point of view of
the intrasquad competition,
Sandoval's position is secure, for
the real competition will be
among the underclassmen.
These younger runners should
give the team good depth, an
important factor in close meets
where the sixth and seventh men
can decide the outcome. This
depth should take some of the
pressure off the top three and

make Stanford a serious
contender in the Southern
Division of the Pac-8, if
not the entire league.
Aside from Geiken, Stanford is
returning the same team as last
year, but coach Marshall Clark
says, "We're not sure about
ourselves yet. It's a pretty wide
open battle after the top three,
but we've looked good in the
early workouts."
The Pac-8 looks like an
unusuallv strong conference again
this year. The Northwest schools

have always been among the best
in the country. Oregon, even
without Steve Prefontaine, looks
powerful, as does Washington
State.
Oregon State, which finished a
distant third in last year's Pac-8
meet, should be stronger this year
with the addition of probably the
best freshman runner in the
country, Rich Kimbal.
Oregon and Washington State
are two teams that Stanford has
never beaten. The road to building
a solid contender starts tomorrow.

ourselves yet. It's a pretty wide
open battle after the top three,
but we've looked good in the
early workouts."
The Pac-8 looks like an
unusuallv strong conference again
this year. The Northwest schools

have always been among the best
in the country. Oregon, even
without Steve Prefontaine, looks
powerful, as does Washington
State.
Oregon State, which finished a
distant third in last year's Pac-8
meet, should be stronger this year
with the addition of probably the
best freshman runner in the
country, Rich Kimbal.
Oregon and Washington State
are two teams that Stanford has
never beaten. The road to building
a solid contender starts tomorrow.

TOP RUNNER—Tony Sandoval (left) is expected to lead the Cardinal
cross country charge again this season, although a foot injury should
keep him out of tomorrow's initial race.
Officially, the cross country
season opens tomorrow morning
at the Stanford Golf Course with
a meet against the West Valley TVack
Club and San Diego State.
For most runners, however, it
will instead be a hotly contested
intrasquad race. The meet will
mean a chance to break into the
lineup for next week's Fresno
State Invitational.
Behind the top three of Tony
Sandoval, Mark McConell and
Jack Bellah, there should be real
competition. Juniors Chris Berka,
Doug Mclean, Art Brown and
Alan Cummings and sophomores
Steve Crowley, Frank Boutin, Jeff
Norton and Jeff Parrietti will
battle for the remaining four
varsity spots with freshman
standouts Stacy Geiken and Pete
Witt.
Sandoval, the Stanford record
holder for the six-mile course and
the top Stanford finisher in the
Pacific Eight meet last year, is a
doubtful starter because of a foot
injury that kept him out of the
arly workouts.
He will be missed against West
Valley, led by Jim Dare, the
fourth place finisher in the 1972
Olympic Steeplechase trials and a
Stanford gradute student, and A 1
Sanford, a former Stanford
runner.
But from the point of view of
the intrasquad competition,
Sandoval's position is secure, for
the real competition will be
among the underclassmen.
These younger runners should
give the team good depth, an
important factor in close meets
where the sixth and seventh men
can decide the outcome. This
depth should take some of the
pressure off the top three and

make Stanford a serious
contender in the Southern
Division of the Pac-8, if
not the entire league.
Aside from Geiken, Stanford is
returning the same team as last
year, but coach Marshall Clark
says, "We're not sure about
ourselves yet. It's a pretty wide
open battle after the top three,
but we've looked good in the
early workouts."
