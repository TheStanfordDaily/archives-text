Senate Witnesses Blast Rocky
WASHINGTON - Neison A. Rockefeller was
criticized yesterday by Senate witnesses who
claimed his wealth and his handling of such issues as
abortion and the Attica prison revolt make him
unfit for the vice presidency.
Members of the Senate Rules and Administration
Committee, who reportedly are ready to
recommend Rockefeller's confirmation, asked polite
questions and gave no indication the criticism would
change their positions.
Angela Davis, a co-chairperson of the National
Alliance Against Racial and Political Repression,
called Attica "one of the most wanton massacres in
the history of the United States." She said
Rockefeller is responsible for the 43 deaths and 80
injuries that occurred as a result of the uprising.
Representatives of the anti-abortion groups said
Rockefeller's policies as governor of New York have
made him a national of what they called
"permissive abortion." They said his confirmation
by the House and Senate would be a signal that the
United States government officially condones
abortion on demand.
Another witness, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) told
the Senate he does not believe that Rockefeller as a
public official can divorce himself from his family
dynasty.
"We are in fact asking ourselves whether we want
the highest political offices in the land to be
identified with one of the highest concentrations of
private power in the land," he said.
Rockefeller does not stand alone from the rest of
his family or from the financial and corporate
institutions with which they are involved, Helms
said. "He stands with a dynasty of wealth and
power unequalled in the history of the United
States."
Ford Decries Foreign Aid Limits
WASHINGTON — President Ford appealed
yesterday to congressional leaders to block attempts
to attach rigid legislative restriction to foreign aid
programs.
Senate Republican Leader High Scott (R-Pa.)
said, however, the President would accept a money
bill under which military aid to Turkey could be
suspended.
The President and Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger met for two hours and 15 minutes at the
White House with the bipartisan leadership of the
Senate and House and senior members of their
foreign affairs committees.
Scott said Ford urged passage of a continuing
resolution extending beyond Sept. 30 authority to
continue foreign aid and other programs for which
regular appropriation bills have not yet been passed.
The House, in passing the money resolution
Tuesday, attached a rider requiring suspension of
military aid to Turkey until the President could
certify substantial progress in negotiations between
Greece, Turkey and Cyprus for withdrawal of
foreign troops in Cyprus.
Scott said President Ford would accept a
modification adopted by the Senate Appropriations
Committee on Wednesday that would make
continued military aid to Turkey contingent upon a

presidential finding that Turkey is making good
faith efforts to reach a negotiated settlement.
The Senate is scheduled to act on the continuing
resolution Monday. Differences will be subject to
House and Senate concurrence.
Scott and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield
said the Senate will then proceed to act on a sharply
reduced and restrictive foreign aid authorization bill
for this year supported by a majority of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
Economic Index Drops Sharply
WASHINGTON — Hours before the opening of
President Ford's economic summit, the government
reported yesterday that its economic index posted
the sharpest monthly drop of the year.
The index, designed to predict the future course
of the economy, projected higher unemployment,
further stagnation in an already depressed
construction industry and a slowed expansion of the
productive capacity necessary to curtail inflationary
product shortages.
The over-all drop in the index for August was 1.2
percent, reversing a 1.9 percent rise in July.
The gloomy projection was echoed in the
testimony of the President's chief economic adviser,
Alan Greenspan, who told Congress' Joint
Economic Committee that any significant relief
from rising food prices will have to await next year's
harvest.
Furthermore, "the secondary effects of higher oil
prices are and will continue to be felt in a number
of diverse industrial products" despite an expected
leveling off of petroleum prices, said Greenspan,
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Nixon Responds To Treatments
LONG BEACH, Calif. — Former President
Richard M. Nixon is responding satisfactorily to
treatments for the dime-size blood clot in his right
lung, his doctor said yesterday.
Dr. John C. Lungren said Nixon was receiving the
same oral and intravenous anticoagulants that the
former chief executive has been getting since being
hospitalized Monday.
Anticoagulants hopefully will disolve the lung
clot and prevent new clots from forming. The clot*
broke from a larger clot in his left leg, where it had
been created by persistent phlebitis.
Memorial Hospital Medical Center officials said
Nixon has received hundreds of get-well cards and
bouquets.
But the hospital has also received crank
telephone calls threatening Nixon's life and a bomb
threat.
Judge Blocks Galley's Release
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court judge
yesterday temporarily blocked the release of Army
Lt. William L. Calley, who had been ordered freed
by a lower court judge in reversing Galley's
conviction for murder in the My Lai massacre.
Chief Judge John R. Brown of the U.S. sth
Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans granted a
stay of the lower court order until Monday to allow
the Army time to present a written motion for a
15-day stay.
The Justice Department authorized the Army to

seek the 15-day delay to allow time for government
lawyers to decide whether to appeal Wednesday's
order by U.S. District Court Judge J. Robert Elliott
of Columbus, Ga.
Elliott had ruled that Calley's constitutional
rights to a fair trial were violated during the
court-martial three-and-a-half years ago that resulted
in Calley's conviction and sentence of life
imprisonment, later reduced to 10 years.
After Elliott denied an Army request that he stay
his own order, Solicitor General Robert H. Bork
authorized the Army to seek a delay from the Court
of Appeals. Bork's decision stopped short of
authorizing a full-scale appeal of Elliott's order.
Soviet Ship Sinks, Turks Report
ISTANBUL, Turkey — A Soviet guided-missile
destroyer exploded and sank on a trial cruise in the
Black Sea in what could be the worst peacetime
naval disaster ever recorded, Turkish authorities said
yesterday.
Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia news agency said
there were no survivors, but gave no indication of
how many men were aboard. Jane's Fighting Ships,
the authoritative British publication, shows that a
comparable American destroyer carries about 350
men.
The Guinness Book of World Records says the
worst previous peacetime disaster involving a
military ship occurred in 1963 off Cape Cod, Mass.,
when the U.S. nuclear-powered submarine Thresher
was lost with 129 aboard.
Turkish naval sources said the Russian ship was
attached to the Soviet Black Sea fleet and exploded
Wednesday. But the Anatolia agency said the
disaster occurred two weeks ago.
There was no immediate comment from the
Soviet Union, which does not usually publicize its
disasters.
U.S. Navy officials in London and the NATO
Southern Command in Italy said they had no
information about the explosion.
Col sob Pardon Plea Considered
WASHINGTON — President Ford has been asked
to grant a pardon to Charles W. Colson, former
White House special counsel who is serving a federal
prison sentence for obstruction of justice, a White
House spokesman said last night.
Deputy Press Secretary John W. Hushen said the
petition for pardon was submitted to the Justice
Department by Colson's attorney within a week or
two after Ford granted a full pardon on Sept. 8 to
resigned President Richard M. Nixon.
Colson arranged a plea bargain with Watergate
special prosecutor Leon Jaworski last June. He
pleaded guilty to spreading derogatory information
about Daniel Ellsberg in 1971 after Ellsberg leaked
the Pentagon Papers and was a defendant in a
federal criminal case.

questions and gave no indication the criticism would
change their positions.
Angela Davis, a co-chairperson of the National
Alliance Against Racial and Political Repression,
called Attica "one of the most wanton massacres in
the history of the United States." She said
Rockefeller is responsible for the 43 deaths and 80
injuries that occurred as a result of the uprising.
Representatives of the anti-abortion groups said
Rockefeller's policies as governor of New York have
made him a national of what they called
"permissive abortion." They said his confirmation
by the House and Senate would be a signal that the
United States government officially condones
abortion on demand.
Another witness, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) told
the Senate he does not believe that Rockefeller as a
public official can divorce himself from his family
dynasty.
"We are in fact asking ourselves whether we want
the highest political offices in the land to be
identified with one of the highest concentrations of
private power in the land," he said.
Rockefeller does not stand alone from the rest of
his family or from the financial and corporate
institutions with which they are involved, Helms
said. "He stands with a dynasty of wealth and
power unequalled in the history of the United
States."
Ford Decries Foreign Aid Limits
WASHINGTON — President Ford appealed
yesterday to congressional leaders to block attempts
to attach rigid legislative restriction to foreign aid
programs.
Senate Republican Leader High Scott (R-Pa.)
said, however, the President would accept a money
bill under which military aid to Turkey could be
suspended.
The President and Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger met for two hours and 15 minutes at the
White House with the bipartisan leadership of the
Senate and House and senior members of their
foreign affairs committees.
Scott said Ford urged passage of a continuing
resolution extending beyond Sept. 30 authority to
continue foreign aid and other programs for which
regular appropriation bills have not yet been passed.
The House, in passing the money resolution
Tuesday, attached a rider requiring suspension of
military aid to Turkey until the President could
certify substantial progress in negotiations between
Greece, Turkey and Cyprus for withdrawal of
foreign troops in Cyprus.
Scott said President Ford would accept a
modification adopted by the Senate Appropriations
Committee on Wednesday that would make
continued military aid to Turkey contingent upon a

presidential finding that Turkey is making good
faith efforts to reach a negotiated settlement.
The Senate is scheduled to act on the continuing
resolution Monday. Differences will be subject to
House and Senate concurrence.
Scott and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield
said the Senate will then proceed to act on a sharply
reduced and restrictive foreign aid authorization bill
for this year supported by a majority of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
Economic Index Drops Sharply
WASHINGTON — Hours before the opening of
President Ford's economic summit, the government
reported yesterday that its economic index posted
the sharpest monthly drop of the year.
The index, designed to predict the future course
of the economy, projected higher unemployment,
further stagnation in an already depressed
construction industry and a slowed expansion of the
productive capacity necessary to curtail inflationary
product shortages.
The over-all drop in the index for August was 1.2
percent, reversing a 1.9 percent rise in July.
The gloomy projection was echoed in the
testimony of the President's chief economic adviser,
Alan Greenspan, who told Congress' Joint
Economic Committee that any significant relief
from rising food prices will have to await next year's
harvest.
Furthermore, "the secondary effects of higher oil
prices are and will continue to be felt in a number
of diverse industrial products" despite an expected
leveling off of petroleum prices, said Greenspan,
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Nixon Responds To Treatments
LONG BEACH, Calif. — Former President
Richard M. Nixon is responding satisfactorily to
treatments for the dime-size blood clot in his right
lung, his doctor said yesterday.
Dr. John C. Lungren said Nixon was receiving the
same oral and intravenous anticoagulants that the
former chief executive has been getting since being
hospitalized Monday.
Anticoagulants hopefully will disolve the lung
clot and prevent new clots from forming. The clot*
broke from a larger clot in his left leg, where it had
been created by persistent phlebitis.
Memorial Hospital Medical Center officials said
Nixon has received hundreds of get-well cards and
bouquets.
But the hospital has also received crank
telephone calls threatening Nixon's life and a bomb
threat.
Judge Blocks Galley's Release
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court judge
yesterday temporarily blocked the release of Army
Lt. William L. Calley, who had been ordered freed
by a lower court judge in reversing Galley's
conviction for murder in the My Lai massacre.
Chief Judge John R. Brown of the U.S. sth
Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans granted a
stay of the lower court order until Monday to allow
the Army time to present a written motion for a
15-day stay.
The Justice Department authorized the Army to

seek the 15-day delay to allow time for government
lawyers to decide whether to appeal Wednesday's
order by U.S. District Court Judge J. Robert Elliott
of Columbus, Ga.
Elliott had ruled that Calley's constitutional
rights to a fair trial were violated during the
court-martial three-and-a-half years ago that resulted
in Calley's conviction and sentence of life
imprisonment, later reduced to 10 years.
After Elliott denied an Army request that he stay
his own order, Solicitor General Robert H. Bork
authorized the Army to seek a delay from the Court
of Appeals. Bork's decision stopped short of
authorizing a full-scale appeal of Elliott's order.
Soviet Ship Sinks, Turks Report
ISTANBUL, Turkey — A Soviet guided-missile
destroyer exploded and sank on a trial cruise in the
Black Sea in what could be the worst peacetime
naval disaster ever recorded, Turkish authorities said
yesterday.
Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia news agency said
there were no survivors, but gave no indication of
how many men were aboard. Jane's Fighting Ships,
the authoritative British publication, shows that a
comparable American destroyer carries about 350
men.
The Guinness Book of World Records says the
worst previous peacetime disaster involving a
military ship occurred in 1963 off Cape Cod, Mass.,
when the U.S. nuclear-powered submarine Thresher
was lost with 129 aboard.
Turkish naval sources said the Russian ship was
attached to the Soviet Black Sea fleet and exploded
Wednesday. But the Anatolia agency said the
disaster occurred two weeks ago.
There was no immediate comment from the
Soviet Union, which does not usually publicize its
disasters.
U.S. Navy officials in London and the NATO
Southern Command in Italy said they had no
information about the explosion.
Col sob Pardon Plea Considered
WASHINGTON — President Ford has been asked
to grant a pardon to Charles W. Colson, former
White House special counsel who is serving a federal
prison sentence for obstruction of justice, a White
House spokesman said last night.
Deputy Press Secretary John W. Hushen said the
petition for pardon was submitted to the Justice
Department by Colson's attorney within a week or
two after Ford granted a full pardon on Sept. 8 to
resigned President Richard M. Nixon.
Colson arranged a plea bargain with Watergate
special prosecutor Leon Jaworski last June. He
pleaded guilty to spreading derogatory information
about Daniel Ellsberg in 1971 after Ellsberg leaked
the Pentagon Papers and was a defendant in a
federal criminal case.

injuries that occurred as a result of the uprising.
Representatives of the anti-abortion groups said
Rockefeller's policies as governor of New York have
made him a national of what they called
"permissive abortion." They said his confirmation
by the House and Senate would be a signal that the
United States government officially condones
abortion on demand.
Another witness, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) told
the Senate he does not believe that Rockefeller as a
public official can divorce himself from his family
dynasty.
"We are in fact asking ourselves whether we want
the highest political offices in the land to be
identified with one of the highest concentrations of
private power in the land," he said.
Rockefeller does not stand alone from the rest of
his family or from the financial and corporate
institutions with which they are involved, Helms
said. "He stands with a dynasty of wealth and
power unequalled in the history of the United
States."
Ford Decries Foreign Aid Limits
WASHINGTON — President Ford appealed
yesterday to congressional leaders to block attempts
to attach rigid legislative restriction to foreign aid
programs.
Senate Republican Leader High Scott (R-Pa.)
said, however, the President would accept a money
bill under which military aid to Turkey could be
suspended.
The President and Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger met for two hours and 15 minutes at the
White House with the bipartisan leadership of the
Senate and House and senior members of their
foreign affairs committees.
Scott said Ford urged passage of a continuing
resolution extending beyond Sept. 30 authority to
continue foreign aid and other programs for which
regular appropriation bills have not yet been passed.
The House, in passing the money resolution
Tuesday, attached a rider requiring suspension of
military aid to Turkey until the President could
certify substantial progress in negotiations between
Greece, Turkey and Cyprus for withdrawal of
foreign troops in Cyprus.
Scott said President Ford would accept a
modification adopted by the Senate Appropriations
Committee on Wednesday that would make
continued military aid to Turkey contingent upon a

presidential finding that Turkey is making good
faith efforts to reach a negotiated settlement.
The Senate is scheduled to act on the continuing
resolution Monday. Differences will be subject to
House and Senate concurrence.
Scott and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield
said the Senate will then proceed to act on a sharply
reduced and restrictive foreign aid authorization bill
for this year supported by a majority of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
Economic Index Drops Sharply
WASHINGTON — Hours before the opening of
President Ford's economic summit, the government
reported yesterday that its economic index posted
the sharpest monthly drop of the year.
The index, designed to predict the future course
of the economy, projected higher unemployment,
further stagnation in an already depressed
construction industry and a slowed expansion of the
productive capacity necessary to curtail inflationary
product shortages.
The over-all drop in the index for August was 1.2
percent, reversing a 1.9 percent rise in July.
The gloomy projection was echoed in the
testimony of the President's chief economic adviser,
Alan Greenspan, who told Congress' Joint
Economic Committee that any significant relief
from rising food prices will have to await next year's
harvest.
Furthermore, "the secondary effects of higher oil
prices are and will continue to be felt in a number
of diverse industrial products" despite an expected
leveling off of petroleum prices, said Greenspan,
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Nixon Responds To Treatments
LONG BEACH, Calif. — Former President
Richard M. Nixon is responding satisfactorily to
treatments for the dime-size blood clot in his right
lung, his doctor said yesterday.
Dr. John C. Lungren said Nixon was receiving the
same oral and intravenous anticoagulants that the
former chief executive has been getting since being
hospitalized Monday.
Anticoagulants hopefully will disolve the lung
clot and prevent new clots from forming. The clot*
broke from a larger clot in his left leg, where it had
been created by persistent phlebitis.
Memorial Hospital Medical Center officials said
Nixon has received hundreds of get-well cards and
bouquets.
But the hospital has also received crank
telephone calls threatening Nixon's life and a bomb
threat.
Judge Blocks Galley's Release
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court judge
yesterday temporarily blocked the release of Army
Lt. William L. Calley, who had been ordered freed
by a lower court judge in reversing Galley's
conviction for murder in the My Lai massacre.
Chief Judge John R. Brown of the U.S. sth
Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans granted a
stay of the lower court order until Monday to allow
the Army time to present a written motion for a
15-day stay.
The Justice Department authorized the Army to

seek the 15-day delay to allow time for government
lawyers to decide whether to appeal Wednesday's
order by U.S. District Court Judge J. Robert Elliott
of Columbus, Ga.
Elliott had ruled that Calley's constitutional
rights to a fair trial were violated during the
court-martial three-and-a-half years ago that resulted
in Calley's conviction and sentence of life
imprisonment, later reduced to 10 years.
After Elliott denied an Army request that he stay
his own order, Solicitor General Robert H. Bork
authorized the Army to seek a delay from the Court
of Appeals. Bork's decision stopped short of
authorizing a full-scale appeal of Elliott's order.
Soviet Ship Sinks, Turks Report
ISTANBUL, Turkey — A Soviet guided-missile
destroyer exploded and sank on a trial cruise in the
Black Sea in what could be the worst peacetime
naval disaster ever recorded, Turkish authorities said
yesterday.
Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia news agency said
there were no survivors, but gave no indication of
how many men were aboard. Jane's Fighting Ships,
the authoritative British publication, shows that a
comparable American destroyer carries about 350
men.
The Guinness Book of World Records says the
worst previous peacetime disaster involving a
military ship occurred in 1963 off Cape Cod, Mass.,
when the U.S. nuclear-powered submarine Thresher
was lost with 129 aboard.
Turkish naval sources said the Russian ship was
attached to the Soviet Black Sea fleet and exploded
Wednesday. But the Anatolia agency said the
disaster occurred two weeks ago.
There was no immediate comment from the
Soviet Union, which does not usually publicize its
disasters.
U.S. Navy officials in London and the NATO
Southern Command in Italy said they had no
information about the explosion.
Col sob Pardon Plea Considered
WASHINGTON — President Ford has been asked
to grant a pardon to Charles W. Colson, former
White House special counsel who is serving a federal
prison sentence for obstruction of justice, a White
House spokesman said last night.
Deputy Press Secretary John W. Hushen said the
petition for pardon was submitted to the Justice
Department by Colson's attorney within a week or
two after Ford granted a full pardon on Sept. 8 to
resigned President Richard M. Nixon.
Colson arranged a plea bargain with Watergate
special prosecutor Leon Jaworski last June. He
pleaded guilty to spreading derogatory information
about Daniel Ellsberg in 1971 after Ellsberg leaked
the Pentagon Papers and was a defendant in a
federal criminal case.

Senate Witnesses Blast Rocky
WASHINGTON - Neison A. Rockefeller was
criticized yesterday by Senate witnesses who
claimed his wealth and his handling of such issues as
abortion and the Attica prison revolt make him
unfit for the vice presidency.
Members of the Senate Rules and Administration
Committee, who reportedly are ready to
recommend Rockefeller's confirmation, asked polite
questions and gave no indication the criticism would
change their positions.
Angela Davis, a co-chairperson of the National
Alliance Against Racial and Political Repression,

abortion on demand.
Another witness, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) told
the Senate he does not believe that Rockefeller as a
public official can divorce himself from his family
dynasty.
"We are in fact asking ourselves whether we want
the highest political offices in the land to be
identified with one of the highest concentrations of
private power in the land," he said.
Rockefeller does not stand alone from the rest of
his family or from the financial and corporate
institutions with which they are involved, Helms
said. "He stands with a dynasty of wealth and
power unequalled in the history of the United
States."
Ford Decries Foreign Aid Limits
WASHINGTON — President Ford appealed
yesterday to congressional leaders to block attempts
to attach rigid legislative restriction to foreign aid
programs.
Senate Republican Leader High Scott (R-Pa.)
said, however, the President would accept a money
bill under which military aid to Turkey could be
suspended.
The President and Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger met for two hours and 15 minutes at the
White House with the bipartisan leadership of the
Senate and House and senior members of their
foreign affairs committees.
Scott said Ford urged passage of a continuing
resolution extending beyond Sept. 30 authority to
continue foreign aid and other programs for which
regular appropriation bills have not yet been passed.
The House, in passing the money resolution
Tuesday, attached a rider requiring suspension of
military aid to Turkey until the President could
certify substantial progress in negotiations between
Greece, Turkey and Cyprus for withdrawal of
foreign troops in Cyprus.
Scott said President Ford would accept a
modification adopted by the Senate Appropriations
Committee on Wednesday that would make
continued military aid to Turkey contingent upon a

presidential finding that Turkey is making good
faith efforts to reach a negotiated settlement.
The Senate is scheduled to act on the continuing
resolution Monday. Differences will be subject to
House and Senate concurrence.
Scott and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield
said the Senate will then proceed to act on a sharply
reduced and restrictive foreign aid authorization bill
for this year supported by a majority of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
Economic Index Drops Sharply
WASHINGTON — Hours before the opening of
President Ford's economic summit, the government
reported yesterday that its economic index posted
the sharpest monthly drop of the year.
The index, designed to predict the future course
of the economy, projected higher unemployment,
further stagnation in an already depressed
construction industry and a slowed expansion of the
productive capacity necessary to curtail inflationary
product shortages.
The over-all drop in the index for August was 1.2
percent, reversing a 1.9 percent rise in July.
The gloomy projection was echoed in the
testimony of the President's chief economic adviser,
Alan Greenspan, who told Congress' Joint
Economic Committee that any significant relief
from rising food prices will have to await next year's
harvest.
Furthermore, "the secondary effects of higher oil
prices are and will continue to be felt in a number
of diverse industrial products" despite an expected
leveling off of petroleum prices, said Greenspan,
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Nixon Responds To Treatments
LONG BEACH, Calif. — Former President
Richard M. Nixon is responding satisfactorily to
treatments for the dime-size blood clot in his right
lung, his doctor said yesterday.
Dr. John C. Lungren said Nixon was receiving the
same oral and intravenous anticoagulants that the
former chief executive has been getting since being
hospitalized Monday.
Anticoagulants hopefully will disolve the lung
clot and prevent new clots from forming. The clot*
broke from a larger clot in his left leg, where it had
been created by persistent phlebitis.
Memorial Hospital Medical Center officials said
Nixon has received hundreds of get-well cards and
bouquets.
But the hospital has also received crank
telephone calls threatening Nixon's life and a bomb
threat.
Judge Blocks Galley's Release
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court judge
yesterday temporarily blocked the release of Army
Lt. William L. Calley, who had been ordered freed
by a lower court judge in reversing Galley's
conviction for murder in the My Lai massacre.
Chief Judge John R. Brown of the U.S. sth
Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans granted a
stay of the lower court order until Monday to allow
the Army time to present a written motion for a
15-day stay.
The Justice Department authorized the Army to

seek the 15-day delay to allow time for government
lawyers to decide whether to appeal Wednesday's
order by U.S. District Court Judge J. Robert Elliott
of Columbus, Ga.
Elliott had ruled that Calley's constitutional
rights to a fair trial were violated during the
court-martial three-and-a-half years ago that resulted
in Calley's conviction and sentence of life
imprisonment, later reduced to 10 years.
After Elliott denied an Army request that he stay
his own order, Solicitor General Robert H. Bork
authorized the Army to seek a delay from the Court
of Appeals. Bork's decision stopped short of
authorizing a full-scale appeal of Elliott's order.
Soviet Ship Sinks, Turks Report
ISTANBUL, Turkey — A Soviet guided-missile
destroyer exploded and sank on a trial cruise in the
Black Sea in what could be the worst peacetime
naval disaster ever recorded, Turkish authorities said
yesterday.
Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia news agency said
there were no survivors, but gave no indication of
how many men were aboard. Jane's Fighting Ships,
the authoritative British publication, shows that a
comparable American destroyer carries about 350
men.
The Guinness Book of World Records says the
worst previous peacetime disaster involving a
military ship occurred in 1963 off Cape Cod, Mass.,
when the U.S. nuclear-powered submarine Thresher
was lost with 129 aboard.
Turkish naval sources said the Russian ship was
attached to the Soviet Black Sea fleet and exploded
Wednesday. But the Anatolia agency said the
disaster occurred two weeks ago.
There was no immediate comment from the
Soviet Union, which does not usually publicize its
disasters.
U.S. Navy officials in London and the NATO
Southern Command in Italy said they had no
information about the explosion.
Col sob Pardon Plea Considered
WASHINGTON — President Ford has been asked
to grant a pardon to Charles W. Colson, former
White House special counsel who is serving a federal
prison sentence for obstruction of justice, a White
House spokesman said last night.
Deputy Press Secretary John W. Hushen said the
petition for pardon was submitted to the Justice
Department by Colson's attorney within a week or
two after Ford granted a full pardon on Sept. 8 to
resigned President Richard M. Nixon.
Colson arranged a plea bargain with Watergate
special prosecutor Leon Jaworski last June. He
pleaded guilty to spreading derogatory information
about Daniel Ellsberg in 1971 after Ellsberg leaked
the Pentagon Papers and was a defendant in a
federal criminal case.
Today's Weather
Clearing this morning then fair through
tomorrow. Warming trend beginning today. Lows
tonight in the 50s. Highs today in mid 60s to mid
70s and tomorrow, in the 80s. Northwest wind 10
to 20 mph afternoons.
Senate Witnesses Blast Rocky
WASHINGTON - Neison A. Rockefeller was
criticized yesterday by Senate witnesses who
claimed his wealth and his handling of such issues as
abortion and the Attica prison revolt make him
unfit for the vice presidency.
Members of the Senate Rules and Administration
Committee, who reportedly are ready to
recommend Rockefeller's confirmation, asked polite
questions and gave no indication the criticism would
change their positions.
Angela Davis, a co-chairperson of the National
Alliance Against Racial and Political Repression,
called Attica "one of the most wanton massacres in
the history of the United States." She said
Rockefeller is responsible for the 43 deaths and 80
injuries that occurred as a result of the uprising.
Representatives of the anti-abortion groups said
Rockefeller's policies as governor of New York have
made him a national of what they called
"permissive abortion." They said his confirmation
by the House and Senate would be a signal that the
United States government officially condones
abortion on demand.
Another witness, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) told
the Senate he does not believe that Rockefeller as a
public official can divorce himself from his family
dynasty.
"We are in fact asking ourselves whether we want
the highest political offices in the land to be
identified with one of the highest concentrations of
private power in the land," he said.
