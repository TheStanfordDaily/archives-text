# State Reviews GPU Grant For Possible Reapproval

### SUE KING 
A $30,000 grant by the California
Department of Health to the Gay
People's Union (GPU) here, after first
being approved and later withheld, has
been re-examined and is now in the
final stages of review and approyal, a
state official said yesterday.
It was "probably a mistake" that
the funding was turned down after it
had been approved last May, said
Vernon Bertourne, chief of the Special
Services Section of the Health
Department
He said that it was probably a case
of trying to "right a wrong by sending
[the GPU proposal] back [for
re-examination]," although he said he
could not "pin down" the person or
department who authorized the
rejection.
The grant, which would provide
funding for improved mental health
services for Midpeninsula bisexuals and
homosexuals, was first approved in a
letter from Andrew G. Robertson, the
deputy director of Health Treatment
Systems.
The GPU was informed that the
proposal for a program entitled "Gay
Community of Concern" had been
approved and they would be receiving
the contract "shortly."
"There was no mention of any way
that contract would not be signed,"
said Richard A. Lewis, executive
director of Gay Community of
Concern. He assumed that it would
just be a matter of time before the
project received its funding contract.
The program got underway July 1.
Then, in August, the GPU received a
memo from Betourne warning all grant
recipients that a letter of acceptance
did not amount to final approval for
their projects, and they should not
spend any money until they received a
signed copy of the grant contract.
In September the Whitman
Radclyffe Foundation, through which
the GPU received the grant, received a
letter from Robertson's replacement,
Don Z. Miller, saying that a "decision
was made" that financial support
could not be provided for Gay
Community of Concern.
Out of the approximately 5000
groups that requested grants "we were
the only ones singled out [for
rejection]," said Lewis.
Assemblyman Dixon. Arnett
(R-Redwood City) and State Assembly
Speaker Leo McCarthy (D-San
Francisco) wrote letters to William
Mayer, director of the state Health
Department asking why the project
had been denied funds. , , _
The GPU has no record of further
correspondence answering the
questions raised by Arnett and

McCarthy, but since Sept. 10, the date
the Whitman Radclyffe Foundation
received the "rejection notice" from
Miller, the question of funding for Gay
Community of Concern has been
reopened.
According to Richard Thomas, a
member of the advisory council of
Gay Community of Concern, work
had already begun on the project when
the GPU received word that funds had
been denied.
He indicated plans to hire a
woman administrator and additional
staff for the project, as well as ideas
for a film on homosexuals and a book
to educate mental health agencies on
the needs of gay clients, would have to
be scrapped if funds were not
forthcoming.
