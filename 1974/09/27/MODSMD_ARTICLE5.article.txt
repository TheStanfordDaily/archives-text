# Mayor Combines Civic Service With Scholarship
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Even among the Stanford faculty, Byron D.
Sher is a busy and versatile man. In addition
to his academic duties, Law Prof. Sher serves
on the Palo Alto City Council and was elected
mayor last July by his council collegues.
Sher says he views his job as mayor as
essentially an extension of his continuing role
as councilman. In an interview this week, Sher
pointed out that under Palo Alto's
"council-mayor" system, the mayor has little
more power than any other council member.
But while his main extra job as mayor is to
guide Council meetings and perform
ceremonial duties, Sher stops short of calling
himself merely first among equals on the
council.
Sher explained that, as mayor, he
symbolizes city government to many Palo
Alto residents and therefore probably
exercises more influence than other council
members.
Dual Roles
Despite his ties to both Stanford and Palo
Alto, Sher emphasized that his dual roles have
created no conflict of interest.
Sher said that his presense at Stanford gives
him "some sensitivity to Stanford's
problems," but that his main concern on the
council is to respond to the needs of Palo
Altans.
"As mayor, my job is to represent the
city," Sher said. "If the city attorney ever

advised me that a particular issue posed a
conflict of interest, I'd disqualify myself from
voting on the matter, but this has never
occurred."
Noting that many Palo Alto residents over
the years have accused Stanford of dominating
city affairs, Sher called his election as mayor
an encouraging sign that most Palo Altans no
longer fear Stanford's presense.
"Although the Stanford campus isn't
within the city's corporate boundary, the two
entities can't ignore each other," Sher
declared.
Land Problems
"When the University pursued active land
development, it had an impact on Palo Alto
because of the commuters passing through on
the way to the .lospital and Industrial Park.
"But in recent months, the University has
issued a statement regarding its land use plans,
and the Palo Altans are generally pleased
because they believe this reflects a cautious
attitude on the part of Stanford."
He added that the recent appearance of
University Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger before the City's
Policy and Planning Commission did much to
impress the city.
Sher stated that because of the formation
of a new comprehensive plan by the city, "the
shoe has shifted to the other foot and now the
University is expressing concern about the
plans for Palo Alto's development.

Palo Alto's "blueprint for the future" will
regulate housing, parking, employment and
parks, Sher explained. The final step will be
the creation of a total review of the zoning
map, Stanford's leading cause of concern, he
said.
Although the issue of Palo Alto's
development vis a vis environmental concerns
has caused turmoil on the council in the past,

Sher says there is more consensus on the
countil now than when he entered city politic
a decade ago.
Acknowledging that council members
previously formed pro-development and
"residentialist" blocs, Sher said he is pleased
that members now are "addressing themselves
to the merits of individual issues" rather than
dividing persistently along the old lines.
Old Feud
Sher is certainly familiar with the acrimony
engendered by the old council divisions.
Originally elected to the council in 1965, Sher
and several other liberal "residentialist"
members were recalled from the council in
1967 after pro-development forces attacked
them as anti-business.
But by 1973, Sher was the leading
vote-getter in the council race.
Sher, 48, was elected mayor on the 37th
ballot by a 5-4 vote that many observers
suspect broke along rigid liberal-conservative
lines. But Sher says he believes that he can
work harmoniously with all council members.
Time Pressure
Although he admits that becoming mayor
has placed further demands on his time, Sher
stressed that he won't allow his civic activities
to interfere with his teaching.
A graduate of Washington University in St.
Louis, Sher graduated summa cum laude from
Harvard Law School in 1952 and has served
on the Stanford faculty since 1957. He

teaches courses in contract law and a seminar
in consumer protection law.
Sher noted that his service on the council
has provided him with an "interchange of
ideas," broadening his understanding of his
professional studies.
"I enjoy being mayor-my wife calls the
council my hobby," he laughed. "It is a
fascinating position because of the terrific
interest of Palo Alto residents in their city.
There are a lot of council watchers in the
city."
Palo Alto mayors don't usually enter office
with any specific program different from their
aims while ordinary councilmen. As mayor,
Sher said he will continue his old interests of
encouraging regionalism and supporting
greater comity between Palo Alto and
Stanford.
But Sher noted that as mayor, he is often
so busy directing council meetings that he has
less time to participate in debates. Sher said
that as mayor, he hopes to streamline the
work of council meetings.
"I have experienced changes in my
perspective since becoming mayor," he said.
"One can deal with substantive issues as a
councilperson. But when you try to run a
meeting and move items, you have less time to
think about participating in debate. A mayor
must try to move the meeting and discourage
people from repetition in debate and
discussion of peripheral issues."

so busy directing council meetings that he has
less time to participate in debates. Sher said
that as mayor, he hopes to streamline the
work of council meetings.
"I have experienced changes in my
perspective since becoming mayor," he said.
"One can deal with substantive issues as a
councilperson. But when you try to run a
meeting and move items, you have less time to
think about participating in debate. A mayor
must try to move the meeting and discourage
people from repetition in debate and
discussion of peripheral issues."

Byron Sher
Even among the Stanford faculty, Byron D.
Sher is a busy and versatile man. In addition
to his academic duties, Law Prof. Sher serves
on the Palo Alto City Council and was elected
mayor last July by his council collegues.
Sher says he views his job as mayor as
essentially an extension of his continuing role
as councilman. In an interview this week, Sher
pointed out that under Palo Alto's
"council-mayor" system, the mayor has little
more power than any other council member.
But while his main extra job as mayor is to
guide Council meetings and perform
ceremonial duties, Sher stops short of calling
himself merely first among equals on the
council.
Sher explained that, as mayor, he
symbolizes city government to many Palo
Alto residents and therefore probably
exercises more influence than other council
members.
Dual Roles
Despite his ties to both Stanford and Palo
Alto, Sher emphasized that his dual roles have
created no conflict of interest.
Sher said that his presense at Stanford gives
him "some sensitivity to Stanford's
problems," but that his main concern on the
council is to respond to the needs of Palo
Altans.
"As mayor, my job is to represent the
city," Sher said. "If the city attorney ever

advised me that a particular issue posed a
conflict of interest, I'd disqualify myself from
voting on the matter, but this has never
occurred."
Noting that many Palo Alto residents over
the years have accused Stanford of dominating
city affairs, Sher called his election as mayor
an encouraging sign that most Palo Altans no
longer fear Stanford's presense.
"Although the Stanford campus isn't
within the city's corporate boundary, the two
entities can't ignore each other," Sher
declared.
Land Problems
"When the University pursued active land
development, it had an impact on Palo Alto
because of the commuters passing through on
the way to the .lospital and Industrial Park.
"But in recent months, the University has
issued a statement regarding its land use plans,
and the Palo Altans are generally pleased
because they believe this reflects a cautious
attitude on the part of Stanford."
He added that the recent appearance of
University Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger before the City's
Policy and Planning Commission did much to
impress the city.
Sher stated that because of the formation
of a new comprehensive plan by the city, "the
shoe has shifted to the other foot and now the
University is expressing concern about the
plans for Palo Alto's development.

Palo Alto's "blueprint for the future" will
regulate housing, parking, employment and
parks, Sher explained. The final step will be
the creation of a total review of the zoning
map, Stanford's leading cause of concern, he
said.
Although the issue of Palo Alto's
development vis a vis environmental concerns
has caused turmoil on the council in the past,

Sher says there is more consensus on the
countil now than when he entered city politic
a decade ago.
Acknowledging that council members
previously formed pro-development and
"residentialist" blocs, Sher said he is pleased
that members now are "addressing themselves
to the merits of individual issues" rather than
dividing persistently along the old lines.
Old Feud
Sher is certainly familiar with the acrimony
engendered by the old council divisions.
Originally elected to the council in 1965, Sher
and several other liberal "residentialist"
members were recalled from the council in
1967 after pro-development forces attacked
them as anti-business.
But by 1973, Sher was the leading
vote-getter in the council race.
Sher, 48, was elected mayor on the 37th
ballot by a 5-4 vote that many observers
suspect broke along rigid liberal-conservative
lines. But Sher says he believes that he can
work harmoniously with all council members.
Time Pressure
Although he admits that becoming mayor
has placed further demands on his time, Sher
stressed that he won't allow his civic activities
to interfere with his teaching.
A graduate of Washington University in St.
Louis, Sher graduated summa cum laude from
Harvard Law School in 1952 and has served
on the Stanford faculty since 1957. He

teaches courses in contract law and a seminar
in consumer protection law.
Sher noted that his service on the council
has provided him with an "interchange of
ideas," broadening his understanding of his
professional studies.
"I enjoy being mayor-my wife calls the
council my hobby," he laughed. "It is a
fascinating position because of the terrific
interest of Palo Alto residents in their city.
There are a lot of council watchers in the
city."
Palo Alto mayors don't usually enter office
with any specific program different from their
aims while ordinary councilmen. As mayor,
Sher said he will continue his old interests of
encouraging regionalism and supporting
greater comity between Palo Alto and
Stanford.

so busy directing council meetings that he has

Palo Alto mayors don't usually enter office

"I have experienced changes in my
perspective since becoming mayor," he said.
"One can deal with substantive issues as a
councilperson. But when you try to run a
meeting and move items, you have less time to
think about participating in debate. A mayor
must try to move the meeting and discourage
people from repetition in debate and
discussion of peripheral issues."

Even among the Stanford faculty, Byron D.
Sher is a busy and versatile man. In addition
to his academic duties, Law Prof. Sher serves
on the Palo Alto City Council and was elected
mayor last July by his council collegues.
Sher says he views his job as mayor as
essentially an extension of his continuing role
as councilman. In an interview this week, Sher
pointed out that under Palo Alto's
"council-mayor" system, the mayor has little
more power than any other council member.
But while his main extra job as mayor is to
guide Council meetings and perform
ceremonial duties, Sher stops short of calling
himself merely first among equals on the
council.
Sher explained that, as mayor, he
symbolizes city government to many Palo
Alto residents and therefore probably
exercises more influence than other council
members.
Dual Roles
Despite his ties to both Stanford and Palo
Alto, Sher emphasized that his dual roles have
created no conflict of interest.
Sher said that his presense at Stanford gives
him "some sensitivity to Stanford's
problems," but that his main concern on the
council is to respond to the needs of Palo
Altans.
"As mayor, my job is to represent the
city," Sher said. "If the city attorney ever

advised me that a particular issue posed a
conflict of interest, I'd disqualify myself from
voting on the matter, but this has never
occurred."
Noting that many Palo Alto residents over
the years have accused Stanford of dominating
city affairs, Sher called his election as mayor
an encouraging sign that most Palo Altans no
longer fear Stanford's presense.
"Although the Stanford campus isn't
within the city's corporate boundary, the two
entities can't ignore each other," Sher
declared.
Land Problems
"When the University pursued active land
development, it had an impact on Palo Alto
because of the commuters passing through on
the way to the .lospital and Industrial Park.
"But in recent months, the University has
issued a statement regarding its land use plans,
and the Palo Altans are generally pleased
because they believe this reflects a cautious
attitude on the part of Stanford."
He added that the recent appearance of
University Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger before the City's
Policy and Planning Commission did much to
impress the city.
Sher stated that because of the formation
of a new comprehensive plan by the city, "the
shoe has shifted to the other foot and now the
University is expressing concern about the
plans for Palo Alto's development.

Palo Alto's "blueprint for the future" will
regulate housing, parking, employment and
parks, Sher explained. The final step will be
the creation of a total review of the zoning
map, Stanford's leading cause of concern, he
said.
Although the issue of Palo Alto's
development vis a vis environmental concerns
has caused turmoil on the council in the past,

Sher says there is more consensus on the
countil now than when he entered city politic
a decade ago.
Acknowledging that council members
previously formed pro-development and
"residentialist" blocs, Sher said he is pleased
that members now are "addressing themselves
to the merits of individual issues" rather than
dividing persistently along the old lines.
Old Feud
Sher is certainly familiar with the acrimony
engendered by the old council divisions.
Originally elected to the council in 1965, Sher
and several other liberal "residentialist"
members were recalled from the council in
1967 after pro-development forces attacked
them as anti-business.
But by 1973, Sher was the leading
vote-getter in the council race.
Sher, 48, was elected mayor on the 37th
ballot by a 5-4 vote that many observers
suspect broke along rigid liberal-conservative
lines. But Sher says he believes that he can
work harmoniously with all council members.
Time Pressure
Although he admits that becoming mayor
has placed further demands on his time, Sher
stressed that he won't allow his civic activities
to interfere with his teaching.
A graduate of Washington University in St.
Louis, Sher graduated summa cum laude from
Harvard Law School in 1952 and has served
on the Stanford faculty since 1957. He

teaches courses in contract law and a seminar
in consumer protection law.
Sher noted that his service on the council
has provided him with an "interchange of
ideas," broadening his understanding of his
professional studies.

council my hobby," he laughed. "It is a
fascinating position because of the terrific
