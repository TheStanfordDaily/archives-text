# A 						Real Education

It is time for Stanford to
address itself to the education
that it is providing outside the
classroom. This is "community
education," or the process of
acquiring and practicing skills
which are used to affect the
quality of life outside the
classroom or job.
Stanford is deeply involved in
this kind of education through its
policy of providing on-campus
housing for most of its academic
groups. Although 1 will
specifically focus on graduate
student housing in Escondido
Village, many of the same
considerations are pertinent to
groups ranging from
undergraduates to senior faculty.
In designing Escondido Village
to accommodate nearly 4000
people — 1500 graduate students
and their families—Stanford gave
great attention to providing an
optimum physical plant within
low income housing limitations.
The apartments are small but
efficient and the grounds are ideal
for children. In most areas there is
a fine sense of space made
possible by a generous land
allocation.
Escondido Village is also very
fortunate in its composition. We
have great diversity in language,
culture, race and religion. This
opportunity to share and
experience differences in an
everyday living situation is unique
and of immeasurable value.
Despite this heterogeneity, there
are common factors which draw
us close — similar association with
Stanford, young family status,
and common educational
interests.
Village Is Home
Another healthy factor for
community life is that we regard
Escondido Village as our home. It
is here that we live all year, that
our children go to school, that we
pay taxes, vote and seek
recreation. Our average length of
stay approximates that of most
Americans in any communtiy.
In effect, then, Stanford has
created a small town on its
campus which has the potential
for providing an optimum
"community education." This
responsibility should merit the
most careful consideration and
planning. Goals should be set for
active citizen involvement and an
appropriate environment provided
where they can be implemented.
Avoid Paternalism
There is, of course, a fine line
which the University must walk
between paternalism and
abnegation of responsibility.
From a resident's point of view,
most problems result from errors
on the side of paternalism.
Our "town" is unique in that
we all have the same landlord, the
University. This makes any degree
of self government somewhat
artificial since there is always the
possibility of the University
exercising authority contrary to
resident opinion. This limitation
should not, however, be used as

an excuse for arbitrary use of
authority. Rather, the University
should recognize from an
educational point of view, the
greater the degree of
responsibility for their
community vested in them, the
greater will be the learning
experience for residents.
Since the average age in the
Village is about thirty, this is
often an early experience in
participation as adult members of
a "town." Attitudes and degree of
participation will be initiated and
practiced here which will set their
future patterns wherever they
may later go. If residents live in a
"town" where little responsibility
is either allowed or expected of
them, will Stanford have offered a
valid educational experience?
Much To Gain
The University has a great deal
to gain from an Escondido Village
which shares in governing itself.
First, Stanford fulfills its
obligation to provide a total
education. In light of current
examples of government
corruption, there are few who
would argue against the value of
fostering citizen participation in
their communities.
Secondly, it develops an
attitude of "we can do for
ourselves" which is much less
expensive than paternalism. There
are definite costs associated with
"doing for" a group if they do not
share voluntarily in the effort.
Another measurable cost of
paternalism is the loss of
administration time and effort
spent responding to dissent which
basically stems from residents'
inability to affect decisions.
Last, since residents have a
vested interest in matters affecting
the Village, they have to offer an
interest and supply of information
that any administration should
welcome. Since the residents are
the best experts on the Village,
there is every expectation that
fewer mistakes will be made if
they are fully involved in the
decision-making which affects
them.
The Village in the last year has
just begun to tap the tremendous
reservoir of talented and skilled
residents in an effort to further
community life. This has ranged
from programming at the new
community center to work on the
budget.
In summation, I encourage
Stanford University to
complement an excellent
academic experience with a fine
community education as well. It
should not be regarded as
satisfactory to create conditions
where Escondido Village is
faceless and quiet. Rather, given
the proper stimulus, a campus
"town" could be fostered which
would serve as a model for other
universities and further enhance
life at Stanford.

on the side of paternalism.
Our "town" is unique in that
we all have the same landlord, the
University. This makes any degree
of self government somewhat
artificial since there is always the
possibility of the University
exercising authority contrary to
resident opinion. This limitation
should not, however, be used as

an excuse for arbitrary use of
authority. Rather, the University
should recognize from an
educational point of view, the
greater the degree of
responsibility for their
community vested in them, the
greater will be the learning
experience for residents.
Since the average age in the
Village is about thirty, this is
often an early experience in
participation as adult members of
a "town." Attitudes and degree of
participation will be initiated and
practiced here which will set their
future patterns wherever they
may later go. If residents live in a
"town" where little responsibility
is either allowed or expected of
them, will Stanford have offered a
valid educational experience?
Much To Gain
The University has a great deal
to gain from an Escondido Village
which shares in governing itself.
First, Stanford fulfills its
obligation to provide a total
education. In light of current
examples of government
corruption, there are few who
would argue against the value of
fostering citizen participation in
their communities.
Secondly, it develops an
attitude of "we can do for
ourselves" which is much less
expensive than paternalism. There
are definite costs associated with
"doing for" a group if they do not
share voluntarily in the effort.
Another measurable cost of
paternalism is the loss of
administration time and effort
spent responding to dissent which
basically stems from residents'
inability to affect decisions.
Last, since residents have a
vested interest in matters affecting
the Village, they have to offer an
interest and supply of information
that any administration should
welcome. Since the residents are
the best experts on the Village,
there is every expectation that
fewer mistakes will be made if
they are fully involved in the
decision-making which affects
them.
The Village in the last year has
just begun to tap the tremendous
reservoir of talented and skilled
residents in an effort to further
community life. This has ranged
from programming at the new
community center to work on the
budget.
In summation, I encourage
Stanford University to
complement an excellent
academic experience with a fine
community education as well. It
should not be regarded as
satisfactory to create conditions
where Escondido Village is
faceless and quiet. Rather, given
the proper stimulus, a campus
"town" could be fostered which
would serve as a model for other
universities and further enhance
life at Stanford.

It is time for Stanford to
address itself to the education
that it is providing outside the
classroom. This is "community
education," or the process of
acquiring and practicing skills
which are used to affect the
quality of life outside the
classroom or job.
Stanford is deeply involved in
this kind of education through its
policy of providing on-campus
housing for most of its academic
groups. Although 1 will
specifically focus on graduate
student housing in Escondido
Village, many of the same
considerations are pertinent to
groups ranging from
undergraduates to senior faculty.
In designing Escondido Village
to accommodate nearly 4000
people — 1500 graduate students
and their families—Stanford gave
great attention to providing an
optimum physical plant within
low income housing limitations.
The apartments are small but
efficient and the grounds are ideal
for children. In most areas there is
a fine sense of space made
possible by a generous land
allocation.
Escondido Village is also very
fortunate in its composition. We
have great diversity in language,
culture, race and religion. This
opportunity to share and
experience differences in an
everyday living situation is unique
and of immeasurable value.
Despite this heterogeneity, there
are common factors which draw
us close — similar association with
Stanford, young family status,
and common educational
interests.
Village Is Home
Another healthy factor for
community life is that we regard
Escondido Village as our home. It
is here that we live all year, that
our children go to school, that we
pay taxes, vote and seek
recreation. Our average length of
stay approximates that of most
Americans in any communtiy.
In effect, then, Stanford has
created a small town on its
campus which has the potential
for providing an optimum
"community education." This
responsibility should merit the
most careful consideration and
planning. Goals should be set for
active citizen involvement and an
appropriate environment provided
where they can be implemented.
Avoid Paternalism
There is, of course, a fine line
which the University must walk
between paternalism and
abnegation of responsibility.

It is time for Stanford to
address itself to the education
that it is providing outside the
classroom. This is "community
education," or the process of
acquiring and practicing skills
which are used to affect the
quality of life outside the
classroom or job.
Stanford is deeply involved in
this kind of education through its
policy of providing on-campus
housing for most of its academic
groups. Although 1 will
specifically focus on graduate
student housing in Escondido
Village, many of the same
considerations are pertinent to
groups ranging from
undergraduates to senior faculty.
In designing Escondido Village
to accommodate nearly 4000
people — 1500 graduate students
and their families—Stanford gave
great attention to providing an
optimum physical plant within
low income housing limitations.
The apartments are small but
efficient and the grounds are ideal
for children. In most areas there is
a fine sense of space made
possible by a generous land
allocation.
Escondido Village is also very
fortunate in its composition. We
have great diversity in language,
culture, race and religion. This
opportunity to share and
experience differences in an
everyday living situation is unique
and of immeasurable value.
Despite this heterogeneity, there
are common factors which draw
us close — similar association with
Stanford, young family status,
and common educational
interests.
Village Is Home
Another healthy factor for
community life is that we regard
Escondido Village as our home. It
is here that we live all year, that
our children go to school, that we
pay taxes, vote and seek
recreation. Our average length of
stay approximates that of most
Americans in any communtiy.
In effect, then, Stanford has
created a small town on its
campus which has the potential
for providing an optimum
"community education." This
responsibility should merit the
most careful consideration and
planning. Goals should be set for
active citizen involvement and an
appropriate environment provided
where they can be implemented.
Avoid Paternalism
There is, of course, a fine line
which the University must walk
between paternalism and
abnegation of responsibility.
From a resident's point of view,
most problems result from errors
on the side of paternalism.
Our "town" is unique in that
we all have the same landlord, the
University. This makes any degree
of self government somewhat
artificial since there is always the
possibility of the University
exercising authority contrary to
resident opinion. This limitation
should not, however, be used as

an excuse for arbitrary use of
authority. Rather, the University
should recognize from an
educational point of view, the
greater the degree of
responsibility for their
community vested in them, the
greater will be the learning
experience for residents.
Since the average age in the
Village is about thirty, this is
often an early experience in
participation as adult members of
a "town." Attitudes and degree of
participation will be initiated and
practiced here which will set their
future patterns wherever they
may later go. If residents live in a
"town" where little responsibility
is either allowed or expected of
them, will Stanford have offered a
valid educational experience?
Much To Gain
The University has a great deal
to gain from an Escondido Village
which shares in governing itself.
First, Stanford fulfills its
obligation to provide a total
education. In light of current
examples of government
corruption, there are few who
would argue against the value of
fostering citizen participation in
their communities.
Secondly, it develops an
attitude of "we can do for
ourselves" which is much less
expensive than paternalism. There
are definite costs associated with
"doing for" a group if they do not
share voluntarily in the effort.
Another measurable cost of
paternalism is the loss of
administration time and effort
spent responding to dissent which
basically stems from residents'
inability to affect decisions.
Last, since residents have a
vested interest in matters affecting
the Village, they have to offer an
interest and supply of information
that any administration should
welcome. Since the residents are
the best experts on the Village,
there is every expectation that
fewer mistakes will be made if
they are fully involved in the
decision-making which affects
them.
The Village in the last year has
just begun to tap the tremendous
reservoir of talented and skilled
residents in an effort to further
community life. This has ranged
from programming at the new
community center to work on the
budget.
In summation, I encourage
Stanford University to
complement an excellent
academic experience with a fine
community education as well. It
should not be regarded as
satisfactory to create conditions
where Escondido Village is
faceless and quiet. Rather, given
the proper stimulus, a campus
"town" could be fostered which
would serve as a model for other
universities and further enhance
life at Stanford.
