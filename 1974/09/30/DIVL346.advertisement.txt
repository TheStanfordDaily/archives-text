THE COMMONS
IS A ROSE EVER NOT A ROSE?
A rose may always be a rose, but sometimes a snack bar is a cafeteria. As in the
case of Encina Snack Bar. We've been calling it that because it has always been
called that (why else?) What it really is is a full-service cafeteria. And it's small,
secluded, and cozy. We've named it THE COMMONS, which gives you a hint
about where it is — in Encina Commons, behind Encina Hall. You'll find it
nestled back in an ivy-covered alcove, a quiet oasis in a busy world. You'll also
find it worth looking for.
