# There's More To The Flicks Than The Movie
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
The movie is not the only reason for going to the ASSU
Sunday flicks. In fact, sometimes it doesn't figure as a
reason at all.
The Flicks may instead be the motivation behind an
impromptu party numbering anything from a romantic
two-some to a boisterous gang from L e dorm. Or it can be
the testing grounds for the latest model in paper airplanes.
Dressed in autumn's latest in pantsuits or in ragged
T-shirts and red gym shorts, hundreds of students line up
almost all the way to Hoover Tower's doorstep.
By the time they finally enter the building, strangers
have become friends and friends have often become a group
of rowdies intent on trying to raise the rest of the crowd to
their own level of hilarity.
Hard-Cord Rowdies
The "hard-cores," almost all male, sit in the front row of
the balcony, tennis shoes dangling over the edge. Their
position is a strategic one: good acoustics for banging
together soft drink cans, and more important, a launching
pad for scores of paper airplanes, showered on the heads of
the helpless below.
Every last scrap of paper in Memorial Auditorium must
beaiibomeat least once in the two-hour period.
In one showing of the movie Joe some years back, an
actor made the mistake of mentioning the United States Air
Force. Acting as if on cue, the "hard-cores" filled the
auditorium with their own fleet of aircraft.
Will the missile make it all the way to the stage? An
"ahh" escapes from a thousand throats as one plane sails,
dipps, then "ooh" smashes against the back of the girl in
the fifth row.
But the crowd quickly tires of such antics and the
"hardcores" try another tactic. They begin a rhythmic
clapping which builds up to hoots and hollers of

impatience.
Some take the delay calmly. A few take out textbooks
and try to study. Two bespectacled juniors resume a
discussion on Bertoldt Brecht.
Finally the movie—remember the movie?—starts to an
overwhelming shshshsh and scattered yells of "focus" or
"sound."
Relative Silence
If the movie is good, then the audience becomes
relatively quiet, except for a stubborn few who shout
clever, or not so-clever rejoinders to the actors' lines
throughout the show.
But if the movie is bad or maudlin be prepared not to
hear much of it. A belch comes in the middle of a tragic
scene, a deafening hiss drowns out some playwright's poor
attempt at comedy. A couple of years ago, some
enterprising young student even dragged a stepladder and
mop onstage to literally clean up a nude scene.
Yesterday's movie, Paper Chase, apparently warranted
enough respect to keep the noise level to a minimum.
But, feeling cheated of a primary role in the Flicks, the
audience asserted its presence by making as much noise as
possible when noise was called for.
Boos And Cheers
A giggle became a roar of laughter, bad guys drew
excessive hissing and good guys drew cheers and applause at
the slightest sign of victory over "evil" (in this case a
pompous law professor).
On the surface, it was total involvement, but, more
accurately, it was total release. The movie seemed to have a
cathartic effect, not so much in what it said as the setting in
which it was presented.
That's another good reason to go to the Sunday Fiicks:
to watch what happens when (1700) Stanford students get
together in a non-academic activity.

FLICK FANS—lt's been a tradition at Stanford ever since Richard Lyman was in short pants, or longer — the line at
Memorial Auditorium for the Sunday Flicks, which are still the best entertainment bargain on the Midpeninsula. For 50
cents, a person with current Stanford ID can see a recent first-run movie.
