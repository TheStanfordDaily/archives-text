# One Tradition Worth Maintaining
## 
### 
Jim Wascher

"New plans threaten frats" screamed the
headline in Live Oak last week. And scream it
should have, because the latest bright idea
out of the Housing Office would deprive
fraternities of their most essential asset:
control over their own membership (the plan,
drafted by David Salego, would subject frat
members to the housing draw for the first
time ever).
I don't belong to a fraternity, so it's
difficult for me confidently to predict how
badly Salego's plan would hurt the frats.
However, it seems to me that the principal
purpose of a fraternity is to build lasting
friendships. And I've always preferred to
choose my friends—lasting or
otherwise—rather than to have them assigned
to me by an impersonal third party.
Throughout Stanford's 80-year history,
generations of men have found something
special at the frat—and that seems to be one
tradition that is worth maintaining.
"Brotherhood is an outdated word," one
fraternity member told me, "but we have real
unity here—ss guys living and doing things
together. We're a lot tighter than any dorm
situation could be because we do choose our
own members?"

It would be particularly distressing if the
University Administration decided to scrap
this tradition because of its own bungling and
poor planning. As Tim Ferguson pointed out
on this page last week, Stanford is in
apparent non-compliance with a new federal
anti-sexism statute primarily because it chose
to shut down sororities 30 years ago.
Now, only frat men are privileged to be
guaranteed housing each year. And the Great
White Fathers in Washington say this must
not be so.
Accordingly, to rectify this evil, the Great
White Fathers in the Old Union propose to
emasculate fraternities rather than to restore
sororities. Thus a perverted sort of credit
system: we fly now and you pay for what we
do later.
Some may ask why 500 men should be
guaranteed housing each year when 820
other students who want to live on campus
cannot do so for lack of space. Well, I was
one of those 820 unfortunate souls this
my anger is directed at the
University, not at the frats.
Thumb-Twiddling
After all, it was the University—its Board
of Trustees, Administration and Housing
Office—which failed to anticipate the housing

crunch which has been with us for so many
years. As they blissfully twiddled their
thumbs, the situation grew worse and worse,
until last year, when nearly one-fourth of
those who participated in the housing draw
were not placed on campus.
Only now have the powers that be finally
gotten around to planning more housing—and
the first 150 places won't be ready for at
least two years.
An old cliche warns that where there's
smoke, there's fire. In this case, the
Administration is throwing up so much
smoke that one can't be certain who started
the fire. But all signs point to the
Administration (surprise!).
It seems that the students are always the
ones who suffer when the University digs
itself into a hole. The Salego plan asks
fraternities to boost Stanford out of this
housing hole, only to be buried themselves.
Every student who is still interested in fair
play should stand beside Ferguson and his
fraternity colleagues in their battle against
the University. Enough is enough.

It would be particularly distressing if the
University Administration decided to scrap
this tradition because of its own bungling and
poor planning. As Tim Ferguson pointed out
on this page last week, Stanford is in
apparent non-compliance with a new federal
anti-sexism statute primarily because it chose
to shut down sororities 30 years ago.
Now, only frat men are privileged to be
guaranteed housing each year. And the Great
White Fathers in Washington say this must
not be so.
Accordingly, to rectify this evil, the Great
White Fathers in the Old Union propose to
emasculate fraternities rather than to restore
sororities. Thus a perverted sort of credit
system: we fly now and you pay for what we
do later.
Some may ask why 500 men should be
guaranteed housing each year when 820
other students who want to live on campus
cannot do so for lack of space. Well, I was
one of those 820 unfortunate souls this
my anger is directed at the
University, not at the frats.
Thumb-Twiddling
After all, it was the University—its Board
of Trustees, Administration and Housing
Office—which failed to anticipate the housing

crunch which has been with us for so many
years. As they blissfully twiddled their
thumbs, the situation grew worse and worse,
until last year, when nearly one-fourth of
those who participated in the housing draw
were not placed on campus.
Only now have the powers that be finally
gotten around to planning more housing—and
the first 150 places won't be ready for at
least two years.
An old cliche warns that where there's
smoke, there's fire. In this case, the
Administration is throwing up so much
smoke that one can't be certain who started
the fire. But all signs point to the
Administration (surprise!).
It seems that the students are always the
ones who suffer when the University digs
itself into a hole. The Salego plan asks
fraternities to boost Stanford out of this
housing hole, only to be buried themselves.
Every student who is still interested in fair
play should stand beside Ferguson and his
fraternity colleagues in their battle against
the University. Enough is enough.

"New plans threaten frats" screamed the
headline in Live Oak last week. And scream it
should have, because the latest bright idea
out of the Housing Office would deprive
fraternities of their most essential asset:
control over their own membership (the plan,
drafted by David Salego, would subject frat
members to the housing draw for the first
time ever).
I don't belong to a fraternity, so it's
difficult for me confidently to predict how
badly Salego's plan would hurt the frats.
However, it seems to me that the principal
purpose of a fraternity is to build lasting
friendships. And I've always preferred to
choose my friends—lasting or
otherwise—rather than to have them assigned
to me by an impersonal third party.
Throughout Stanford's 80-year history,
generations of men have found something
special at the frat—and that seems to be one
tradition that is worth maintaining.
"Brotherhood is an outdated word," one
fraternity member told me, "but we have real
unity here—ss guys living and doing things
together. We're a lot tighter than any dorm
situation could be because we do choose our
own members?"
