						Welcome Death Knell For Frats
##

John Freed

Tim Ferguson provided an
interesting defense of fraternity
living in the Sept. 26 Daily. I
wondered about his statement
that, if certain conditions are met,
we will soon hear the knell for
frats "as we now know them."
From where I stand, the knell
is already loud and clear.
Four factors are accelerating
the demise of Stanford's archaic
fraternity system:
—In 1944, University women
voted to ban sororities from
campus. Little did they realize
that their vote would be affecting
the fraternity system some 30
years later.
—In 1964, certain racial
minority groups agitated for and
won passage of federal civil rights
legislation. Ten years later, a
different federal law protecting
the civil rights of women now
threatens the special privileges
extended to frats.
—Later in the '60s, co-ed
housing swept the campus. All but
a few dorms went co-ed, and some
fraternities ("fratorities"?)
followed suit.
—With the recent institution of
the Housing Draw, the concept of
guaranteeing 540 frat men a space
on campus has fallen out of favor,
as hundreds more undergraduate
men and women are tossed off
campus to let the frat men stay.
Only One Answer
Larry Horton, associate dean
of student affairs, notes that the
Draw is merely a method of
allocating a "scarce resource—on
campus housing spaces." Horton
does not claim that the Draw is
"the" answer—only one answer.
"The Draw is no sacred cow,"
Horton has said. "It can be revised
or even scrapped."
Yet Ferguson predicts dire
consequences for fraternities if
they are incorporated into the
Draw. He ignores the fact that the
Draw system can be altered to
accomodate frats— perhaps to the
point where frats can continue to
admit members as they do now,
so long as the members draw
better than the cutoff numbers.
Under such a system, any living
group consisting solely of
upperclassmen could request
exemption annually from the
assigning process. Once the
"on-campus" pool had been
decided by the cutoff number
procedure, each exempted living
group could subjectively decide its
membership, drawing from the
eligible pool. The rest of the pool
would be assigned as under the
present procedure.
Financial Investment
Ferguson argues persuasively
that some frat men have put large
sums of money into their houses;

yet, he points out, only two frat
houses (Sigma Chi and Theta Xi)
are wholly owned by the
fraternity occupying the house!
The University could (if the
Trustees really wanted to be
nasty) refuse to renew the lease
on the land those two houses
stand upon, forcing each frat
either to abandon its house or to
move the house off-campus.
Ferguson abhors the thought
of frat men being off campus.
"Obviously, with Stanford's
relative isolation from the
surrounding community, such
off-campus locations are
extremely undesirable here," he
wrote.
Yet, what kind of numbers are
we talking about? At the present
eviction rate, if frats were added
to the Draw, in the neighborhood
of 115 frat men would be evicted
each year. Ferguson seems much
more concerned about them than
about the 878 undergraduates,
male and female alike, who were

unassigned after last year's Spring
Draw.
Why are these frat men more
important then others who want
on-campus housing? Ferguson's
argument is unconvincing; in fact,
it is almost nauseating.
Earned Privilege?
"Stanford students are an elite,
drawing envy from those who
cannot attend. Within Stanford,
there are those who have earned
an additional privilege: life in an
independent house," he wrote.
"Aaauggh!" to paraphrase
Charlie Brown. What have
fraternity men done to "earn" the
privilege of guaranteed on-campus
housing for three years? Perhaps
surviving an occasionally
humiliating initiation process is
sufficient. Perhaps Ferguson had
other reasons in mind. At the
least, he owes us an explanation.
A further question—if this
privilege can be "earned," would
someone mind letting me know
how females on this campus can

earn it? Or is there some specific
aspect of the male anatomy which
prevents women from qualifying?
Frats Dying
The frats at Stanford have been
slowly dying for years. Rush
figures were up last year,
Ferguson tells us, but then, so was
enrollment. Today, only a scant
dozen all-male fraternities cling
tenuously to their position.
Historical factors within and
without the University have
contributed to the current
situation. Dumping blame in
Larry Horton's lap or proposing a
fraternity-like housing system
throughout the campus will not
solve the problem.
Perhaps it would have been
"nicer," or more "aesthetically
pleasing" to keep the old frat
system around a while longer. But
the federal government has said
the time to act is now.
So act we must.

covered housing issues last year.)
