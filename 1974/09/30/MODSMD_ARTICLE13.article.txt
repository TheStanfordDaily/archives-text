So the Grateful Dead are
feeling miserable, eh? And the
Mars Hotel album musically
reflects the group's deep troubles?
Because it's overlong and
repetitive? Incredible, somehow I
failed to notice.
But isn't it strange that their
most recent concerts have been so
brilliant? According to the field
reports I've read, their music has
never been healthier.
So, do us all a favor and give
Mars Hotel to a better qualified
reviewer. Hopefully he will be
more patient and will try to
appreciate what these musicians
are up to.
Thank God the Dead is one
group which makes music you
have to listen to many times
before you can understand what
they've learned, and how aptly
they've expressed it. Music such as
the Dead's doesn't wear thin after
three listenings.
My point is this: if, like Mark
Simonian, you're somebody who
gets frustrated when you can't
figure a piece of music out after
three minutes, maybe you
shouldn't be listening to the Dead.
Too bad the Daily
entertainment department has lost
its investigative spirit. The rumors
concerning the Dead's impending
"break-up" are untrue. That's
Rolling Stone hype—that's how
they sell their magazine—and too
bad if you believe it
unquestioningly.
If Simonian had contacted
the Dead office he would have
learned that the band intends to
stop gigging for nine months or
so. And wouldn't you rest if
you'd been two years on the
road?
I hope to see an intelligent
appraisal of the Dead's unique
genius soon after their upcoming
Winterland concerts. Surely there
are capable writers on your staff
who believe what they hear in
concert, without prejudice.

"Once around the
turntable"—how aptly stated. It
overly expresses the reviewer's
state of mind during his obviously
"quickly passed judgement" on
the new Grateful Dead album
"Grateful Dead from the Mars
Hotel". Three times you've
listened to this album, Mr.
Simonian, three times. And yet
you conclude the band is in a
miserable stage. Have any of you
figured out what the front cover
of the album says, underneath
"Grateful Dead from the Mars
Hotel"? UGLY RUMORS. The
words are there—see them, never
just look at them. UGLY
RUMORS— no more can be said.

they've learned, and how aptly
they've expressed it. Music such as
the Dead's doesn't wear thin after
three listenings.
My point is this: if, like Mark
Simonian, you're somebody who
gets frustrated when you can't
figure a piece of music out after
three minutes, maybe you
shouldn't be listening to the Dead.
Too bad the Daily
entertainment department has lost
its investigative spirit. The rumors
concerning the Dead's impending
"break-up" are untrue. That's
Rolling Stone hype—that's how
they sell their magazine—and too
bad if you believe it
unquestioningly.
If Simonian had contacted
the Dead office he would have
learned that the band intends to
stop gigging for nine months or
so. And wouldn't you rest if
you'd been two years on the
road?
I hope to see an intelligent
appraisal of the Dead's unique
genius soon after their upcoming
Winterland concerts. Surely there
are capable writers on your staff
who believe what they hear in
concert, without prejudice.

Ugly Rumors

"Once around the
turntable"—how aptly stated. It
overly expresses the reviewer's
state of mind during his obviously
"quickly passed judgement" on
the new Grateful Dead album
"Grateful Dead from the Mars
Hotel". Three times you've
listened to this album, Mr.
Simonian, three times. And yet
you conclude the band is in a
miserable stage. Have any of you
figured out what the front cover
of the album says, underneath
"Grateful Dead from the Mars
Hotel"? UGLY RUMORS. The
words are there—see them, never
just look at them. UGLY
RUMORS— no more can be said.

So the Grateful Dead are
feeling miserable, eh? And the
Mars Hotel album musically
reflects the group's deep troubles?
Because it's overlong and
repetitive? Incredible, somehow I
failed to notice.
But isn't it strange that their
most recent concerts have been so
brilliant? According to the field
reports I've read, their music has
never been healthier.
So, do us all a favor and give
Mars Hotel to a better qualified
reviewer. Hopefully he will be
more patient and will try to
appreciate what these musicians
are up to.
Thank God the Dead is one
group which makes music you
have to listen to many times
before you can understand what
they've learned, and how aptly
they've expressed it. Music such as
the Dead's doesn't wear thin after
three listenings.
