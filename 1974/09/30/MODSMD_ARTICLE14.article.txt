# Ways To Curb The Energy Crisis
## 
### 
David Smith

President Ford struck a mighty blow
against America's problems on Saturday
when he called on all Americans to make lists
of 10 ways to fight inflation and the energy
crisis. In fact, list-making may prove our
most effective weapon against these thorny
problems. But we must not stop at Ford's
recommendations.
After they send their inflation-fighting
lists to the White House, Americans should
start to work on more lists. In the hope that
others will follow my lead, I submit what I
feel are the 10 most important lists of 10
items that will help solve all our problems.
Ten Foodless Dinners—Food prices have
soared recently, but they could go nowhere
but down if no one bought any. It is a
well-known fact that people can eat quite a
filling portion without consuming any food
at all.
Housewives should spend some time
developing hot, tasty supper dishes like
sneaker gumbo and fried light bulbs, and
they should encourage their children to
perfect delicious mud pies and cakes.
Meatless meals were all right in past
decades, but the inflation-killing meals of the
seventies will be foodless meals.
Ten Substitutes for Tennis Balls—Food
shortages have hit as swiftly or as mercilessly
as the current tennis-ball crisis. Americans
should not hog the high-priced balls on the
market now; instead, they should make their
own from old socks and other "useless"
items.
Ten Established Mutual Funds-The
average item which was worth ten dollars a

decade ago is now worth about twenty. By
contrast, the mutual-fund share bought for
ten dollars in the sixties will now bring about
five. There is no surer way to prevent people
from gaining inflation—causing high interest
rates and watching their money grow
meaninglessly than to have them lose it in
mutual-fund shares. Only established funds,
though, can insure a steady loss rate spanning
many years.
Ten Safe Manufacturers—lf Americans,
often a very miserly breed, do not wish to see
their money disappear in a mutual fund, then
perhaps they can be persuaded to buy strong,
decorative safes and store the money forever,
thus stemming inflationary spending.
Models that can be opened only once
every 10, 50, or 100 years should be
promoted as a public service by our great
advertising firms, and the government should
suggest that no patriot can be without his
own "freedom safe" or "liberty safe," which
would replace the inflationary U.S. Savings
Bonds.
Ten Leo Kottke Albums—Even in these
days of the vinyl shortage, there are still
many records which hardly anyone would
even think of buying. If stores could stock
exclusively the complete Leo Kottke
collection, there would be no record sales
and, in the long run, more vinyl floor tiles to
replace scarce linoleum tiles.
Ten Exciting Things to Do in Bed—lf
Americans stayed in bed more, they would
not only use their cars less, but they could
also cut down on heating-fuel consumption
by adding extra blankets.
Games like bed-chess and bed-monopoly

should be developed immediately, along with
other new sources of entertainment that will
make it more fun to stay in bed than to
travel.
Ten Artists who Work Only with Old
Plastic Bags and Other Non-Recyclable
Garbage—These men are national heroes and
should be patronized as such. On the other
hand, sculptors who use scarce iron, bronze,
and copper, and painters who insist on
oil-based paints should be disdained as the
resource-hoggers they really are.
Ten Locomotive-Engineer Training
Schools—Too many people earning too much
money spells inflation, yet some claim that
the unemployed don't have the satisfaction
of knowing a trade.
If every other person were trained to be a
locomotive engineer, they would become
highly skilled in a job for which they would
never receive inflationary wages.
Ten Devices That Use No Conventional
Energy—lt has already been proved that
pyramids can keep milk fresh and razor
blades sharp, thus eliminating the need for
electric milk-fresheners and electric
razor-blade sharpeners. Soon scientists and
para-scientists may find that the sphere will
pop popcorn or the rhomboid inflate bicycle
tires, and the energy crunch will be over.
Ten Best Lists of Ten Lists of Ten Items
to End America's Problems—Compiled by
White House secretaries, who will also name
the 10 best list-makers. These will be asked
to serve on the President's
Enemy-of-Inflation List Committee under
veteran listmaker John Dean.

others will follow my lead, I submit what I
feel are the 10 most important lists of 10
items that will help solve all our problems.
Ten Foodless Dinners—Food prices have
soared recently, but they could go nowhere
but down if no one bought any. It is a
well-known fact that people can eat quite a
filling portion without consuming any food
at all.
Housewives should spend some time
developing hot, tasty supper dishes like
sneaker gumbo and fried light bulbs, and
they should encourage their children to
perfect delicious mud pies and cakes.
Meatless meals were all right in past
decades, but the inflation-killing meals of the
seventies will be foodless meals.
Ten Substitutes for Tennis Balls—Food
shortages have hit as swiftly or as mercilessly
as the current tennis-ball crisis. Americans
should not hog the high-priced balls on the
market now; instead, they should make their
own from old socks and other "useless"
items.
Ten Established Mutual Funds-The
average item which was worth ten dollars a

decade ago is now worth about twenty. By
contrast, the mutual-fund share bought for
ten dollars in the sixties will now bring about
five. There is no surer way to prevent people
from gaining inflation—causing high interest
rates and watching their money grow
meaninglessly than to have them lose it in
mutual-fund shares. Only established funds,
though, can insure a steady loss rate spanning
many years.
Ten Safe Manufacturers—lf Americans,
often a very miserly breed, do not wish to see
their money disappear in a mutual fund, then
perhaps they can be persuaded to buy strong,
decorative safes and store the money forever,
thus stemming inflationary spending.
Models that can be opened only once
every 10, 50, or 100 years should be
promoted as a public service by our great
advertising firms, and the government should
suggest that no patriot can be without his
own "freedom safe" or "liberty safe," which
would replace the inflationary U.S. Savings
Bonds.
Ten Leo Kottke Albums—Even in these
days of the vinyl shortage, there are still
many records which hardly anyone would
even think of buying. If stores could stock
exclusively the complete Leo Kottke
collection, there would be no record sales
and, in the long run, more vinyl floor tiles to
replace scarce linoleum tiles.
Ten Exciting Things to Do in Bed—lf
Americans stayed in bed more, they would
not only use their cars less, but they could
also cut down on heating-fuel consumption
by adding extra blankets.
Games like bed-chess and bed-monopoly

should be developed immediately, along with
other new sources of entertainment that will
make it more fun to stay in bed than to
travel.
Ten Artists who Work Only with Old
Plastic Bags and Other Non-Recyclable
Garbage—These men are national heroes and
should be patronized as such. On the other
hand, sculptors who use scarce iron, bronze,
and copper, and painters who insist on
oil-based paints should be disdained as the
resource-hoggers they really are.
Ten Locomotive-Engineer Training
Schools—Too many people earning too much
money spells inflation, yet some claim that
the unemployed don't have the satisfaction
of knowing a trade.
If every other person were trained to be a
locomotive engineer, they would become
highly skilled in a job for which they would
never receive inflationary wages.
Ten Devices That Use No Conventional
Energy—lt has already been proved that
pyramids can keep milk fresh and razor
blades sharp, thus eliminating the need for
electric milk-fresheners and electric
razor-blade sharpeners. Soon scientists and
para-scientists may find that the sphere will
pop popcorn or the rhomboid inflate bicycle
tires, and the energy crunch will be over.
Ten Best Lists of Ten Lists of Ten Items
to End America's Problems—Compiled by
White House secretaries, who will also name
the 10 best list-makers. These will be asked
to serve on the President's
Enemy-of-Inflation List Committee under
veteran listmaker John Dean.

President Ford struck a mighty blow
against America's problems on Saturday
when he called on all Americans to make lists
of 10 ways to fight inflation and the energy
crisis. In fact, list-making may prove our
most effective weapon against these thorny
problems. But we must not stop at Ford's
recommendations.
