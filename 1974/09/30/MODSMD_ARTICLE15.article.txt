## 'Sometimes The Underdog Is Wrong' Royko: Chicago's Top Columnist 
### STEVE HEFTER 
CHICAGO, 111. — It was morning in The
Loop. It was cold, the kind of flesh
stinging chill that numbs the mind and
cools the blood. It was early, too early to
be in downtown Chicago on a Monday
morning.
It was windy, the kind of wind that
blows off the lake and cracks across the
frigid city like a whip, and it was raining a
drenching downpour which literally soaked
a big-city American newspaperman as he
came to work.
Despite the persistent longing to be in
some other, warmer place, Chicago
columnist Mike Royko sat in his black
leathered swivel chair, harbored inside the
imposing riverfront office that houses the
Chicago Daily News.
The City
This is the city Mike Royko writes
about and through his piercing articles
about this city and its people, Royko has
emerged as one of America's most eminent
journalists.
For Royko, Chicago is a cold city and
its mayor is the coldest of all mayors and

the subject of his best-selling book, Boss:
Richard J. Daley of Chicago.
Gazing down at the murky Chicago
River, Royko emphasizes, "Chicago's
personality is one of thoughness. The
people have to be taught to survive here.
This is a city," he concludes, "that places a
great deal of stock in pragmatism. Chicago
is tough, cynical."
'Door Kicker'
Describing his difficult times, Royko
grins like the cat who got the canary.
"When I was a reporter, I was considered a
'doorkicker,' which is a phrase we have in
this business for one who will go to any
lengths to get a story. I was a snarling,
spitting night editor at one time, and
everyone," he laughs, "was terrified of me.
"That's the way I've tried to be,
professionally. Newspaper reporting is a
tough business, and you have to develop a
thick hide."
It took a "thick hide" to write his book,
Boss, an expose on Daley and Chicago.
After its publication, Daley managed to
have the book removed from Chicago's two
airports (the airport concession owner's

wife is the mayor's cousin).
Despite such rejection, Jimmy Breslin,
renowned author and journalist calls Boss
"the best book ever written about the
American condition at this time." Breslin
referes to Royko as "the man who,
through his always enjoyable, frequently
caustic columns, crunches the heads of
Chicago bosses just like a Chicago cop."
Underdog's Top Dog
Royko has often been dubbed "the
champion of the little man." But he
replies, "I don't think of myself as a
'defender of the underdog.' Sometimes the
underdog is wrong and the role changes.
The guy whose house I save from some
sharp lawyer (through his column) may
say, 'you're defending me, the underdog.'
"Then, a black guy may buy a house in
this guy's neighborhood, and the same guy
may be out with a brick in his hand.
Then," he muses, "he's not going to like
what I have to write about him."
Leaning against his typewriter, looking
for all the world as if he has forgotten his
last name, shirt-sleeves rolled up, cigarette
languishing in an ashtray, Mike Royko goes

about his daily business, journalism. He is
physically solid, and appears tough through
his writings, but there is a distinct
sensitivity evident in his manner.
'Joy In Living'
"There should be a lot more joy in
living here than there is, but there is a sense
of restraint placed upon Chicago." Royko's
brow furrows with annoyance.
'There's a young guy who called me
today, who sells balloons for two bits or
half a buck, and,"he adds, "it's a nice
thing to see a guy walking around the
street selling balloons." Royko pauses. "He
was arrested again yesterday, and it's about
the tenth time they've busted him.
"They've got the idea that street
peddlers are bad for the dignity of the
North Side. So the police captain up there
pinches hot dog guys and balloon guys. It's
little things like that, that detract from
what should be a spontaneous pleasure in
living in this city."
And it's the concern for little stories
like that one which says it all about a giant
of a writer, Mike Royko.

living in this city."

like that one which says it all about a giant
of a writer, Mike Royko.


—Dally pMoto by Doug Archerd
MOUSEKETEER? — Granted that freshmen get younger every year,
but this newly-arrived resident of Stern Hall seems to be striving for
too much of a youthful image. Or perhaps the attire is merely a
symbol of freshmen hopes about the difficulty of their classes.
CHICAGO, 111. — It was morning in The
Loop. It was cold, the kind of flesh
stinging chill that numbs the mind and
cools the blood. It was early, too early to
be in downtown Chicago on a Monday
morning.
It was windy, the kind of wind that
blows off the lake and cracks across the
frigid city like a whip, and it was raining a
drenching downpour which literally soaked
a big-city American newspaperman as he
came to work.
Despite the persistent longing to be in
some other, warmer place, Chicago
columnist Mike Royko sat in his black
leathered swivel chair, harbored inside the
imposing riverfront office that houses the
Chicago Daily News.
The City
This is the city Mike Royko writes
about and through his piercing articles
about this city and its people, Royko has
emerged as one of America's most eminent
journalists.
For Royko, Chicago is a cold city and
its mayor is the coldest of all mayors and

the subject of his best-selling book, Boss:
Richard J. Daley of Chicago.
Gazing down at the murky Chicago
River, Royko emphasizes, "Chicago's
personality is one of thoughness. The
people have to be taught to survive here.
This is a city," he concludes, "that places a
great deal of stock in pragmatism. Chicago
is tough, cynical."
'Door Kicker'
Describing his difficult times, Royko
grins like the cat who got the canary.
"When I was a reporter, I was considered a
'doorkicker,' which is a phrase we have in
this business for one who will go to any
lengths to get a story. I was a snarling,
spitting night editor at one time, and
everyone," he laughs, "was terrified of me.
"That's the way I've tried to be,
professionally. Newspaper reporting is a
tough business, and you have to develop a
thick hide."
It took a "thick hide" to write his book,
Boss, an expose on Daley and Chicago.
After its publication, Daley managed to
have the book removed from Chicago's two
airports (the airport concession owner's

wife is the mayor's cousin).
Despite such rejection, Jimmy Breslin,
renowned author and journalist calls Boss
"the best book ever written about the
American condition at this time." Breslin
referes to Royko as "the man who,
through his always enjoyable, frequently
caustic columns, crunches the heads of
Chicago bosses just like a Chicago cop."
Underdog's Top Dog
Royko has often been dubbed "the
champion of the little man." But he
replies, "I don't think of myself as a
'defender of the underdog.' Sometimes the
underdog is wrong and the role changes.
The guy whose house I save from some
sharp lawyer (through his column) may
say, 'you're defending me, the underdog.'
"Then, a black guy may buy a house in
this guy's neighborhood, and the same guy
may be out with a brick in his hand.
Then," he muses, "he's not going to like
what I have to write about him."
Leaning against his typewriter, looking
for all the world as if he has forgotten his
last name, shirt-sleeves rolled up, cigarette
languishing in an ashtray, Mike Royko goes

about his daily business, journalism. He is
physically solid, and appears tough through
his writings, but there is a distinct
sensitivity evident in his manner.
'Joy In Living'
"There should be a lot more joy in
living here than there is, but there is a sense
of restraint placed upon Chicago." Royko's
brow furrows with annoyance.
'There's a young guy who called me
today, who sells balloons for two bits or
half a buck, and,"he adds, "it's a nice
thing to see a guy walking around the
street selling balloons." Royko pauses. "He
was arrested again yesterday, and it's about
the tenth time they've busted him.
"They've got the idea that street
peddlers are bad for the dignity of the
North Side. So the police captain up there
pinches hot dog guys and balloon guys. It's
little things like that, that detract from
what should be a spontaneous pleasure in

his writings, but there is a distinct

'Joy In Living'
"There should be a lot more joy in
living here than there is, but there is a sense
of restraint placed upon Chicago." Royko's
brow furrows with annoyance.
'There's a young guy who called me
today, who sells balloons for two bits or
half a buck, and,"he adds, "it's a nice
thing to see a guy walking around the
street selling balloons." Royko pauses. "He
was arrested again yesterday, and it's about
the tenth time they've busted him.
"They've got the idea that street
peddlers are bad for the dignity of the
North Side. So the police captain up there
pinches hot dog guys and balloon guys. It's
little things like that, that detract from
what should be a spontaneous pleasure in
living in this city."
And it's the concern for little stories
like that one which says it all about a giant
of a writer, Mike Royko.
