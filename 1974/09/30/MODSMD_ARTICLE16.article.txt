Norman Smoodla is back.
After a long sojourn in the wilderness, he has returned to
Stanford, driven by a whimsical fate.
As no doubt none of you will remember, Norman was
introduced to the bored Daily masses last year, where the
tale of his disillusionment and escape to San Jose State was
chronicled.
Somehow, on his way to San Jose, Norman found himself
at the Stanford Campus in Britain. Departing there in June
he spent a summer in The Real World. Finally, impelled by
the logic of habit, he returned to Stanford for his Senior
Year — that glittering, elusive culmination of the
undergraduate career.
Things, it seems, don't change much.
Take, for instance, Norman's long awaited return to the
elite portals of Stanford dorms.
Smoodla arrived at six o'clock Sunday night and,
attempting to appear friendly but experienced, sought out
the RA for his assigned dorm. He found this worthy passing
through the lounge, appearing very purposeful and occupied.
Norman introduced himself and asked for a room key, his
desires in life at that moment being limited to unloading his
car and getting his much loved posters up on the wall.

He was told that his room keys were in the Stern office.
After twenty minutes of wandering through the mirrored
confusion of the Stern dorm complex — Norman's previous
pathfinding had been limited to the rather more disjointed
bewilderment of the Wilbur dorms — Norman located the
Stern. It's in Larkin, should you ever need to find it.
The Stern office was closed.
The return trip to his dorm required only 15 minutes.
After an extensive search, Norman located his RA
stepping purposefully into the shower. He was told that the
Stern office closed at five and he should go to the door of
the Head Stern Person, who, for delicacies sake, shall go
unnamed herein.
Wandering like a pinball back through the dorms Norman
came to rest before the aforementioned door. There was no
light coming through the crack beneath the door. The Head
Stern Person was at the Sunday Flicks.
Dribbling back to his dorm, Norman communicated this
latest bit of intelligence to his RA as that worthy was drying
his hair. The RA was very sympathetic and said he couldn't
let Norman into his room since the room list was in the Stern
office but he would try to find an empty room and if
Norman came back later he could probably spend the night
on an empty bed and gee, yes, it did seem like an obvious
problem someone should have foreseen.
Norman then wandered off into the night, accompanied

by his car and all his worldly possessions. After ascertaining
that everyone he knew was not in their supposed rooms,
Norman found himself at a dorm dance in Wilbur.
This, of course, could provide material for a whole new
column which, out of the goodness of my heart, I am not
going to write. Suffice to say that, after his stay in The Real
World, Norman was somewhat objective and inclined to
sympathize with the female viewpoint. He decided if would
scare the hell out of him, were he a girl, to have all those hot
male bodies hovering about him.
All things considered, registration the next morning went
very smoothly. There were only a handful of demoralizing
experiences.
Like, for instance, the tuition payment line where
Norman stared morosely at the depressing totals following
''ie dollar signs. As Norman reached the payment window an
'prepossessing, bearded intellectual clutching a tuition
nt card was making his payments. To Norman's dismay he
led out a wad of traveler's checks. Groaning inwardly,
rman prepared for a long wait while this prodigy signed
y traveler's checks in two places.
Instead, the prodigy in question signed one $20 traveler's
check. He handed it to the cashier who gave him three dollars
change.
Norman chipped three teeth clenching his jaw as he made
out a check for $1,671, thereby annihilating three months of

eight hour days.
After regaining his composure and signing class lists (none
of which, as it turned out, he actually went to) Norman went
to get a meal sticker, relieved to be through the whole
process without waiting in the wrong line.
Naturally he was in the wrong line.
Then he learned that he had to have a new ID taken to
replace his old, nearly identical ID on which he had been
collecting meal stickers for four years and to which he was
very attached. He further discovered the new ID took an
hour to dry. Norman spent the hour searching for a line there
would be some point in waiting in.
Comforting himself with his upperclassman dignity
Norman finally retrieved his thoroughly dry ID and retreated
from the fray waiting briefly in the line to register as a voter,
until he remembered he didn't have an address.
That night, in one of those charming
where-are-you-from-and-what's-your-major converstions
Norman's credibility was questioned. A junior asked him
what year he was. Norman responded casually he was a
senior. She didn't believe him. She accused him of being a
freshman.
In a joking voice he said,"So all right, I'm a freshman."
She believed him.
Norman Smoodla is back.
