# Reagan Approves Death Definition
## 
### 
Gov. Ronald Reagan signed
into law Friday a bill that legally
defines death as a "total and
irreversible cessation of brain
function" in the judgment of two
or more doctors.
When signing the bill, authored
by Assemblyman Dixon Arnett
(R-Redwood City), Reagan said it
"clears the way for transplant
donations of organs to save many
other lives."
T he new law should increase
„.ie number of transplants
performed at the Stanford
Medical Center.
Arnett authored the bill in
response to a controversy that
resulted from conflicting judicial
opinions'cn i,ne precise definition
of death.
Two separate cases stemmed
from transplants performed by
Stanford heart surgeon Dr.
Normam Shumway in which the
donor had been the victim of a
criminal act. Both defense
attorney's argued that their clients
could not be considered
responsible for the donor's death,
because the removal of the heart,
kept beating by a machine, caused
the death.
In an Alameda County case, a
Superior Court judge instructed
the jury in a murder case that
death takes place when the brain
ceases to function and not when
the heart stops beating. The jury
found the defendant guilty, but
his attorney appealed the case.
In the Santa Rosa case, a
Munipical Court judge originally
dismissed vehicular manslaughter
charges against a man accused of
causing the death of a 12-year-old
girl who became a transplant
donor.
That decision was reversed by a
Superior Court judge and the
dependent was convicted in
August of manslaughter.
Arnett's new law requires an
independent confirmation of the

death of organ donors. Neither
the physician pronouncing death
nor the doctor confirming it will
be allowed to take part in organ
removal or transplant.
The bill does not define death
as cessation of brain function,
which has been traditionally used
to determine death.
The traditional brain-death
criteria is inability to breathe
spontaneously , no brain activity
recorded by electro
encephalograms made 24 hours
apart and lack of response to
stimulation.
Shumway testified during both
trials, stating that cessation of the
brain's function is a valid criterion
to determine death and that heart
stoppage was "a boy scout"
definition of death.
