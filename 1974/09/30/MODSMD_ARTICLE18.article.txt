# More Than $250,000 Saved
## Court Ruling Aids University 
### 
The state Supreme Court's ruling in favor of the
1972 law granting the state authority to issue
tax-exempt bonds for private institutions will save
Stanford an estimated $250,000 to $500,000
annually in lower interest costs, according to
Director of Finance, Rod Adams.
With authority from the Board of Trustees to
seek up to $14.8 million through the California
Educational Facilities Authority, the University
may seek an initial package of $9 million,
depending on interest rates and market conditions.
The package will include about $4 million to
refinance general plant improvements, $4 million to
refinance Escondido Village Unit IV, and $1
million to refinance the University's central food
service facility. Later the University may also try
for an additional $4.2 million to renovate the East
Wing at Encina Hall, and $1.5 million for a new
chemistry building.
The suit challenging the 1972 California
Educational Facilities Authority Act was brought
by the authority itself when Treasurer Ivy Baker
Priest refused to process bonds for sale to finance
University of the Pacific facilities. Priest asserted

that issuance the bonds would result in providing
state aid to sectarian colleges, thereby violating the
First Amendment's ban on laws establishing
religion.
The court found Priest's assertion invalid, ruling
that the law did meet three tests set down in recent
U.S. Supreme Court decisions for a law to
withstand a challenge of violating the establishment
clause.
The law's purpose is secular; it does not have a
primary effect of advancing religion, and general
state supervision does not amount to excessive
governmental entanglement with religion, the court
said.
The court also concluded that the act doesn't
violate any California constitutional ban against
state aid for sectarian purposes; or the state
constitution section prohibiting public
appropriation for private use.
Until the legislation and court ruling, private
college construction bonds were not tax exempt.
About a dozen institutions have already
indicated they will try to use this method of
financing campus construction.
