# $1 Million Tuition Grant Law Signed
## 
### 
Gov. Ronald Reagan signed
Friday a tuition grant bill which is
designed to provide $1 million in
scholarship aid to students from
middle-income families in
California.
Reagan had until today to sign
or veto the bill (A 83862). The bill
could have automatically become
law even if he did not sign it, since
the legislature had adjourned.
ASSU Vice President Quinn
Mayer, who organized a
letter-writing campaign and
worked with an ad hoc lobby
group to put pressure on
legislatures to support the bill,
said he was "very pleased" the bill
was signed.
"I only hope now that we see
some results. Hopefully the
freedom-of choice purpose of the

program can be carried out," he
said.
However, Mayer warned that
the new bill "will take a lot of fire
out of the lobbying goint on for
financial aids programs."
"We are at a very difficult
crossroads, because this is the first
legislation of its type," explained
Mayer, adding that there was still
some uncertainty as to whether or
not the bill could be expanded.
"There are still legislators who
don't believe private education is
better than public education."
The bill is designed to help lessen
the gap between the cost of
private and public education at
the college level.
"The next step is one of
waiting and then isolating the
benefits of the new program,"
Mayer added, saying he hoped the
program could eventually be
expanded.
During the summer, the state
Senate and Assembly passed, the
bill. The scholarships, which will
become available in autumn of
1975, will be in amounts of $900
or one-third the annual tuition
(whichever is less).
The money will be
independent of the California
State scholarships currently
available.
Sixty percent of the student
body here receives some form of
financial aid. Many students are
feeling the pinch of rising
education costs, but are still
economically ineligible for grants,
Mayer said.
Approximately 55 private
schools throughout the state will
benefit from the program,
according to Mayer. Because the
money will be parceled out in the
form of scholarships to individuals
rather than lump-sum grants to
institutions, the set-up is expected
to allow the program by bypass
much red tape at both state and
university levels.
