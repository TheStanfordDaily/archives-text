# ASSU Board Seeks New Guest Professor
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
The ASSU Guest Professorship
Board will consider other candidates
for a temporary teaching post
established by a student fee assessment
vote last spring board member Kevin
O'Grady said yesterday.
In the same election, students voted
to invite South Vietnamese journalist
Nguyen Huu Thai to teach here this
year as a guest professor. Thai
accepted the ASSU's invitation, but
remains under house arrest in Saigon.
"The odds on getting Thai here for
even winter quarter are pretty slim,"
O'Grady said. "We are going ahead
with efforts to bring someone else
here."
The board will try to find a
candidate who is "in keeping with the
spirit of the Thai resolution,"
O'Grady explained. He added that the
board had asked Political Science Prof.
Richard C. Fagen about the possibility
of inviting a Chilean scholar to teach
as a guest professor.
Chilean Candidate
Yesterday, Fagen told the Daily
that Fergio Bitar, a minister of mining
under the Allende government, was
"the only name on view at this time."
Bitar, an economist who has taught
at the University of Chile and
published articles on industrial
development and multi-national
corporations, is "extremely qualified"
for a guest professorship, Fagen said.
Bitar is currently in prison in
Santiago, but there is talk of
pardoning and releasing him, Fagen
explained. "If he gets out of priosn
he'll be thrown out of the country
immediately," Fagen added. "Getting
him out of Chile won't be a problem.
Whether he'll be allowed to enter the
U.S. is a different political question."
Sponsorship Possibilities
Any course taught by an ASSU
guest professor must be sponsored by
the appropriate academic department.
Fagen said that Bitar "should teach in

the Economics Department," but
added that sponsorship from the Latin
American Studies Department was a
possibility. Latin American Studies
sponsored three Chilean scholars here
last year.
The ASSU guest professorship
board is inviting members of the
Stanford community to suggest other
candidates for the post, O'Grady said.
Suggestions should be placed in the
guest professorship mailbox in the
ASSU office.
Realizing that political problems
have prevented Thai from leaving
South Vietnam and have complicated
efforts to secure the documentation
necessary for his entry into the United
States, O'Grady said that the board
would give "preference" to candidates
for whom such problems are minimal.
The guest professor would have to
arrive here in time to prepare course
work for winter quarter, O'Grady
explained.
Invitation Stands
The ASSU's invitation to Thai still
stands, O'Grady said. The board will
invite the new candidate to teach here
for two quarters and set aside
sufficient funds to bring Thai here for
one quarter if he becomes available.
Inviting Thai to teach here during the
1975-76 academic year would require
another referendum next spring.
Jim Regan, a member of a student
committee working to bring Thai to
Stanford, said no one has heard from
Thai during the last seven weeks. But
efforts to obtain permission for his

release in Saigon will continue, Regan
added.
"Our position with the
governments of the United States and
South Vietnam will be that Thai has
accepted the position, that funds are
available for him when he can get out
of the country, and that he should be
released," Regan explained.
Regan also said that the ASSU
would ask Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park) to make further
inquiries at the State Department
regarding Thai's case. Congressional
efforts to intercede at the State
Department were halted last July after
Thai wrote to his sister in Washington
D.C., saying that efforts to secure his
release were endangering his life.
