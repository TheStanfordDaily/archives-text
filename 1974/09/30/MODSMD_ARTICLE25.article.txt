## What's Wrong With The Defense? 
### Vlae Kershner 
The dry voice of the P.A. announcer came
with infuriating regularity. "Robinson up the
middle for 4 . .. Robinson over right tackle
for 4 .. .Robinson over left tackle for
7 .. .Robinson .. .Kimball .. .Robinson ..
And during this period, that 19-play tying
drive in the fourth quarter, I wonder if
40,000 people in Stanford Stadium weren't
wondering what I was.
"Why the blank can't we stop them???"
Our vaunted defensive front couldn't stop
an obscure Spartan tailback named Walt
Robinson and the blockers who paved his
way. And while San Jose State is definitely a
good football team, harder-hitting than Penn
State, according to nose guard Lacy
Atkinson, could their rushing be any better
than Michigan's or UCLA's?
There are several possible explanations for
that drive, which covered 80 yards during
8:31 of valuable fourth-quarter time.
Attitude
First, an alumnus (class of 1930) criticized
Stanford's "lackadaisical attitude" during the
game.
Well, he's wrong. Stanford's defense tried
as hard as it could. Linebacker Forrie Martin
noted "We were up for the game; I thought
we were psychologically prepared."
Atkinson described his personal feeling
during the SJS charge: "It's very frustrating

when you can't stop them. After every play,
you keep asking yourself 'what am I doing
wrong?' "
A pair of defenders must have been asking
themselves this after the drive, v/hen they sat
on the bench, heads down, and unabashedly
cried.
So it wasn't that Stanford didn't try. They
did. (By the way, I'd like to take back that
stupid insinuation I made last week that it's
OK if a team tries only moderately hard.
It's not OK, and I must have had a bad
day.)
Officiating
Another explanation might be the refs.
Rich Waters probably never committed that
pass interference penalty. And Roger
Stillwell said after the game "I think Pat
[Donovan] and I are Ail-Americans, the refs
tend to let the offensive players get away
with a few things."
However, SJS was not playing "dirty"
football, according to most Card defenders.
Donovan said, "It's the cleanest I've ever seen
San Jose State play."
By the time San Jose launched its long
march, Stillwell, Drew Palin, Gerald Wilson
and Jeff Siemens were all out with some
injury. The replacements, Duncan McColl,
Atkinson, Paul Skrabo and Larry McGovern,
all played well, but are by definition not as

experienced and/or talented as the starters.
Veer Offense
A more technical reason for the ability of
SJS to run on the Cards is provided by
linebacker Gordy Riegel, who missed much
of the game himself after a freak tangling
with a Spartan face mask.
'They were running a veer and we're a
pursuing team so sometimes our linebackers
outran the play. Against a veer, linebackers
sometimes have to stay in place instead of
moving laterally," Riegel said, expressing
optimism that the Cards could correct these
flaws before playing other teams (such as
UCLA) which run the veer.
There's one more explanation for the
defense's performance, and it's the most
haunting. As coach Jack Christiansen put it,
"Maybe we overestimated the ability of some
of our players."
If that's true, Stanford's in trouble. Those
three down linemen and four linebackers
have a lot of responsibility in Stanford's
3-4-4 defense. If any one man can't handle it,
the Cards are in trouble.
So those are the explanations. You've
noticed I've used quotes in most places, and
not criticized anyone, because I think
Christiansen, his staff and his players know a
helluva lot more about defense than I do.
Let's hope they show it pretty soon.
