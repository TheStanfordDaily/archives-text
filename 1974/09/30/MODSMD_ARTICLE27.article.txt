# Pac-8 Roundup
## L.A. Teams Return To Usual Form 
### 
Call the Pasadena Chamber of
Commerce. Tell the members
there may be a Rose Bowl this
January after all.
Until Saturday, doubts were
growing over the ability of the
Pacific Eight to field a team for
the post-season classic.
Now the attention has

centered, as it has so many times
before, on the two Los Angeles
powerhouses. Both UCLA and
USC emerged with flying colors
from a day which saw remaining
Pac-8 teams become further mired
in mediocrity.
Dick Vermeil's Bruins were
nothing short of spectacular in
trouncing previously unbeaten
Michigan State, 56-14. UCLA's
veer offense went the whole game
without fumbling, and
quarterback John Sciarra was so
effective that Vermiel was
prompted to say, "I doubt
seriously that there is a better
quarterback among collegiate
teams today."
John McKay was saying
something akin to that about his
quarterback, Pat Haden, a month
ago. The Trojan mentor might be

a little more reserved in his
comments now.
Haden couldn't cut the
mustard again at Pittsburgh
Saturday, but after he was lost to
a concussion the Trojans came
from behind to beat the
eighth-ranked Panthers, 16-7.
The loss of Haden forced USC
to do what it does best: run.
Anthony Davis gained 149 yards
in 33 carries and Allen Carter
added 88 in 12 tries.
Noted war historian Woody
Hayes would be hard pressed to
remember an upset victory by the
U.S. military comparable to that
which almost occurred in
Berkeley Saturday.
Army, a 22-point underdog,
led California 14-0 at halftime.
But Cal quarterback Steve
Bartkowski completed 18 of 29

passes for 193 yards and running
back Chuck Mancie gained 136
yards as the Bears came back,
27-14.
Oregon got a scare, too.
Against Utah. Utah. Stan Woodfill
kicked three field goals to keep
the Ducks afloat, 23-16.
Washington finally went under
against ninth-ranked Texas A&M.
But the Huskies weren't
embarrassed, pulling to within
21-15 in the final quarter before
falling, 28-15.
The Fumbling Illini lived up to
their newfound nickname in
Champaign-Urbana, losing four of
nine fumbles. But they didn't lose
the game to Washington State. A
Jeff Hollenbach touchdown pass
with 34 seconds left beat the
Cougars, 21-19.

trouncing previously unbeaten
Michigan State, 56-14. UCLA's
veer offense went the whole game
without fumbling, and
quarterback John Sciarra was so
effective that Vermiel was
prompted to say, "I doubt
seriously that there is a better
quarterback among collegiate
teams today."
John McKay was saying
something akin to that about his
quarterback, Pat Haden, a month
ago. The Trojan mentor might be

a little more reserved in his
comments now.
Haden couldn't cut the
mustard again at Pittsburgh
Saturday, but after he was lost to
a concussion the Trojans came
from behind to beat the
eighth-ranked Panthers, 16-7.
The loss of Haden forced USC
to do what it does best: run.
Anthony Davis gained 149 yards
in 33 carries and Allen Carter
added 88 in 12 tries.
Noted war historian Woody
Hayes would be hard pressed to
remember an upset victory by the
U.S. military comparable to that
which almost occurred in
Berkeley Saturday.
Army, a 22-point underdog,
led California 14-0 at halftime.
But Cal quarterback Steve
Bartkowski completed 18 of 29

passes for 193 yards and running
back Chuck Mancie gained 136
yards as the Bears came back,
27-14.
Oregon got a scare, too.
Against Utah. Utah. Stan Woodfill
kicked three field goals to keep
the Ducks afloat, 23-16.
Washington finally went under
against ninth-ranked Texas A&M.
But the Huskies weren't
embarrassed, pulling to within
21-15 in the final quarter before
falling, 28-15.
The Fumbling Illini lived up to
their newfound nickname in
Champaign-Urbana, losing four of
nine fumbles. But they didn't lose
the game to Washington State. A
Jeff Hollenbach touchdown pass
with 34 seconds left beat the
Cougars, 21-19.
Call the Pasadena Chamber of
Commerce. Tell the members
there may be a Rose Bowl this
January after all.
Until Saturday, doubts were
growing over the ability of the
Pacific Eight to field a team for
the post-season classic.
Now the attention has

centered, as it has so many times
before, on the two Los Angeles
powerhouses. Both UCLA and
USC emerged with flying colors
from a day which saw remaining
Pac-8 teams become further mired
in mediocrity.
Dick Vermeil's Bruins were
nothing short of spectacular in
trouncing previously unbeaten
Michigan State, 56-14. UCLA's
veer offense went the whole game
without fumbling, and
quarterback John Sciarra was so
effective that Vermiel was
prompted to say, "I doubt
