# More Questions Raised
## Cards, Spartans Tie, 21-All 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
For the third week in a row, the performance of Stanford's
football team raised more questions than it answered.
And the consensus of those players and coaches who sulked and
swore in the aftermath of the Cards' 21-21 tie against San Jose State
Saturday at Stanford Stadium was perhaps most simply stated by
Brad Williams: "Something's wrong."
Williams' logical conclusion came after the Spartans, 17-point
underdogs, had marched methodically down the field in the final
quarter, chewing up 8:31 on the scoreboard clock in an 80-yard,
19-play drive that left several Card defenders teary-eyed.
It also left the Stanford victory column empty. Craig Kimball's
five-yard scoring pass to Bill Crumley and Ron Ploger's subsequent
conversion tied the score at 21-all, and Stanford failed to mount any
sort of threat in the remaining 5:03.
Still, there were those Cardinals who thought they had stopped the
final Spartan drive with 6:07 remaining. San Jose faced a fourth and
five situation from the Cardinal 17. The field goal team trotted onto
the field, but Spartan coach Darryl Rogers quickly changed his mind,
called time-out and instructed quarterback Craig Kimball to go for the
first down.
Kimball dropped back and fired a pass over the middle to Ike
Mcßee. The play was broken up by defensive back Rich Waters and
the Cards were ecstatic—until they saw an ominous yellow flag.
"I didn't think it was even close," said an amazed Waters. "I got up
and was all happy. I thought we'd stopped them and it was our ball.
Then I saw the flag. I don't see how he could have called it when the
official in front had a better view."

Waters, who was the victim of
a similarly fateful call against
Penn State, admitted that he
"might have interfered" against
the Nittany Lions. But Saturday
"it wasn't close. I was pissed."
Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen, asked to comment
on Waters' explanation, paused to
think it over and then said, "I
agree with Rich."
Excellent Team
Christiansen, though, made it
clear he wasn't blaming the
deadlock on one whistle. "San
Jose State is an excellent football
team," he said. "They're a better
team by 50 or maybe 100 percent
than the team that beat the
Stanford Rose Bowl team three
years ago."
But back to those unanswered
questions. First and foremost, of
course: Who is the Cardinal
quarterback?
Christiansen said that Jerry
Waldvogel will get his first starting
assignment next week against
Michigan, with Mike Cordova his
back-up. It might seem a bit
foolish to start untested
Waldvogel against a national
power like Michigan, but Chris
explained that the San Jose and
Michigan defenses are almost
identical, and Waldvogel should be
well-prepared, having spent the
past week looking at the Spartan
alignment as Cordova's back-up.
After the Michigan game, Chris
hopes to choose definite number
one quarterback (Cordova,

Waldvogel or Guy Benjamin),
who, "barring injury or poor
performance," would start all
seven Pacific Eight games.
"It's not the best situation you
can have on a football team,"
Chris said of his indecision, "but I
promised these kids a chance to
play the day I recruited 'em. I've
gotta give 'em that chance."
Poor Execution
A second pressing question
involves the Cardinal offense.
Some players seem dissatisfied
with Stanford's pattern of run
up-the-middle and pass to the
right side, but others feel the
problem lies elsewhere. "You
can't junk your whole offense just
because it hasn't worked," said
Waldvogel. "We're just not
executing properly."
Other question marks include
the demise of the supposedly
vaunted Cardinal defense (see
related article) and a notorious
Stanford trademark: the inability
to win games that don't directly
affect the Cardinals' New Year's
Day plans.
Still, many of the players have
not lost hope. "With the people
we've got, we should be able to
beat anybody in the country,"
said receiver Eric Test.
But something is definitely

wrong.

Cardinal Notes: San Jose
defensive lineman Dave Wasick,
who was named defensive player
of the game, called Card offensive
tackle Keith Rowen "probably
the best offensive tackle, all
around, that I've seen."
Offensive player of the game
honors went to Spartan running
back Walt Robinson, who gained
85 yards on 20 carries.
All-American defensive end
Roger Stillwell hobbled off the
field early in the fourth quarter
with a sprained left knee. "Doc
[Fred Behling, Stanford's team
physician] says I'm gonna be
OK," Stillwell said, "and if Doc
says I'm gonna be OK Saturday,
I'm gonna play."
Other injured players,
including Gerald Wilson and
Forrie Martin (bruised thighs),
Jeff Siemens (knee sprain), Drew
Palin (shoulder sprain) and Ron
Inge (pinched neck nerve), all
should recover in time for the
Michigan game.
Ted Pappas, however, who
suffered a shoulder bruise and
wrist injury, will be x-rayed to
determine if a wrist bone was
broken.
