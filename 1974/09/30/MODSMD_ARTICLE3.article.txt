## Bruce Franklin Files Colorado Suit 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Fired Stanford English Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin has filed suit in Denver
against the University of Colorado's
Board of Regents, which twice has
denied him employment.
Franklin, an avowed
Marxist-Lennist, contends that the
University of Colorado deprived him
of his constitutional liberties by
refusing him employment solely on
the basis of his political beliefs.
Currently an instructor at Wesleyan
College in Connecticut, Franklin said
he is suing for injunctive relief in the
hope that the court will order the
University of Colorado to hire him.
Franklin added that he is also suing
for financial compensation, but is
unsure whether the suit requests
punitive or merely compensatory

damages.
Case Against Stanford
Santa Clara County Superior Court
Judge Bruce Allen announced last
week that a similar action filed by
Franklin against Stanford won't be
heard by a jury.
Allen added that the civil trial
concerning Franklin's dismissal will be
limited to a review of the University's
advisory board hearings that led to his
firing in January 1972.
Franklin had requested a full jury
trial at which Stanford would have
been required to answer 188 written
questions.
Recommendation At Colorado
Two years after his dismissal here
for allegedly inciting students to
violence, the University of Colorado's
English department recommended to

the Colorado Board of Regents that
Franklin, a noted Melville scholar, be
appointed to the faculty.
In April and again in July, the
University of Colorado Regents
rejected the recommendation in 8-1
votes.
Franklin has sued each of the
University of Colorado Regents
individually except Geraldine Bean,
who twice voted to hire him.
Plaintiffs in the suit include several
members of the University of
Colorado's student government,
Franklin said.
Deprivation Of Students
"The main victims of the Regents'
decisions are the people of the state of
Colorado, especially the students,"
Franklin explained. "They have been

deprived of hearing ideas that are
important in today's world."
Claiming that the Regents made
public statements which criticized his
political views, Franklin said that the
courts might ignore what he called
clear-cut evidence in his favor.
'Abuse Justice'
"If the courts can approve of
President Ford's pardon of [former
President] Nixon and can let
[William] Calley go free, there is no
reason why they won't also abuse
justice by refusing to recognize the
facts in my case," Franklin said.
Franklin noted that the suit against
Colorado was originally instigated with
his approval by the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU). He said that
prior to the second vote by the
Regents, the ACLU warned the board
that failure to hire Franklin might lead
to a lawsuit.
