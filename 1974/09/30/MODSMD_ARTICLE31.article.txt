# Water Polo Team Sinks Army, 20-0
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
Even the military reserves
couldn't have helped the U.S.
Military Academy's varsity water
polo team Saturday. The Cadets
could not withstand the heavy
artillery of host Stanford and
were consequently blasted out of
the pool by the Cardinals, 20-0.
The win brings the Cardinal
pre season record over the .500
mark at 4-3.
Army, which finished third in
the Eastern Championships with
an 11-5 record last year, had to
run for cover as Stanford ran up a
10-0 lead by the end of the first
quarter.
The 10 goal onslaught was
spotlighted with six tallies in the
last two minutes. Paul Clark
started the fireworks with an
assist to Rick Johanson at 1:53
left in the first quarter, added a
goal of his own 30 seconds later,
and then tallied another assist to
Dean Anderson at 1:02 left in the
first period.
The Cards came back for extra
helpings as Anderson assisted Tom
Purcell at 35 seconds left and the
combination of Clark to Purcell
accounted for two goals in the last
nine seconds.
The change of Army goalies at
the end of the first quarter cooled
down the red-hot pace of the
Cards, but Stanford was still able
to chalk up five goals in the
second quarter and five in the
second half. The Cadets, by
comparison, were allowed only
two shots on goal by the stubborn
Stanford defense in the entire first
half.
Accounting for the bulk of
Cardinal goals were Purcell, with
five goals and three assists and
Clark, two goals and three assists.
According to coach Art
Lambert, Stanford's first team
saw action for about a quarter and
a half.
"It was a real pleasure playing
an intersectional game against an
East Coast team. Even though we
had our first-string players in
there for about 10 minutes into

the game, the Cadets are one of
the best Eastern teams," Lambert
said.
The Cardinals' last tune-up
before the opening their Pacific
Eight season against USC on
October 11 puts them against San
Diego State, UC-Davis and Long
Beach State this Saturday in the
Northern California Aquatics
Federation Invitational
Tournament.
"We ought to do very well in
the tournament. I have only seen
one of the teams, UC-Davis. The
rest are unknowns to me,"
Lambert said.
According to Lambert, the
Army game will have no effect on
the play of the upcoming USC
match.
"We are not going to change
any aspect of our game. All we are
going to do is play the way we
have been playing," he said.

the tournament. I have only seen
one of the teams, UC-Davis. The
rest are unknowns to me,"
Lambert said.
According to Lambert, the
Army game will have no effect on
the play of the upcoming USC
match.
"We are not going to change
any aspect of our game. All we are
going to do is play the way we
have been playing," he said.

EASY DOES IT—Stanford's Tom Purcell (38) takes a shot against an outgunned Army goalie during
Saturday's 20-0 massacre. Since Purcell scored five times, it's likely this one went in.
Even the military reserves
couldn't have helped the U.S.
Military Academy's varsity water
polo team Saturday. The Cadets
could not withstand the heavy
artillery of host Stanford and
were consequently blasted out of
the pool by the Cardinals, 20-0.
The win brings the Cardinal
pre season record over the .500
mark at 4-3.
Army, which finished third in
the Eastern Championships with
an 11-5 record last year, had to
run for cover as Stanford ran up a
10-0 lead by the end of the first
quarter.
The 10 goal onslaught was
spotlighted with six tallies in the
last two minutes. Paul Clark
started the fireworks with an
assist to Rick Johanson at 1:53
left in the first quarter, added a
goal of his own 30 seconds later,
and then tallied another assist to
Dean Anderson at 1:02 left in the
first period.
The Cards came back for extra
helpings as Anderson assisted Tom
Purcell at 35 seconds left and the
combination of Clark to Purcell
accounted for two goals in the last
nine seconds.
The change of Army goalies at
the end of the first quarter cooled
down the red-hot pace of the
Cards, but Stanford was still able
to chalk up five goals in the
second quarter and five in the
second half. The Cadets, by
comparison, were allowed only
two shots on goal by the stubborn
Stanford defense in the entire first
half.
Accounting for the bulk of
Cardinal goals were Purcell, with
five goals and three assists and
Clark, two goals and three assists.
According to coach Art
Lambert, Stanford's first team
saw action for about a quarter and
a half.
"It was a real pleasure playing
an intersectional game against an
East Coast team. Even though we
had our first-string players in
there for about 10 minutes into

the game, the Cadets are one of
the best Eastern teams," Lambert
said.
The Cardinals' last tune-up
before the opening their Pacific
Eight season against USC on
October 11 puts them against San
Diego State, UC-Davis and Long
Beach State this Saturday in the
Northern California Aquatics
Federation Invitational
Tournament.
"We ought to do very well in
the tournament. I have only seen
one of the teams, UC-Davis. The
rest are unknowns to me,"
Lambert said.
According to Lambert, the
Army game will have no effect on
the play of the upcoming USC
match.
