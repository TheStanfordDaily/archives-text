# Runners Split Opener
## 
### MIKE SHEPHERD 
Stanford opened its cross
country season Saturday at the
Stanford Golf Course by finishing
second in a triangular meet with
the West Valley Track Club and
San Diego State.
Stanford scored 39 points,
ahead of SDS, which had 64
but not enough to compete with
the WVTC, which won with 27,
paced by a second-place finish by
Stanford graduate student Jim
Dare.
But more important than the
competition for most Stanford
runners was the intrasquad battle
for positions for next week's
Fresno State Invitational. Though
Stanford record-holder Tony
Sandoval was out with a minor
foot injury, the other two
members of the top three, Mark
McConnell and Jack Bellah ran
very well.
McConnell ran a good race,
leading all Stanford runners and
finishing second with a 20:18.4
time for the 4.2 mile course.
Bellah finished less than ten

seconds later, but finished sixth in
a close finish.
Bellah said he "wanted to stay
back and then make a move on
the leaders, but the pace was too
fast. Maybe 1 should have gone
out with them."
Returning lettermen Chris
Berka, Frank Boutin and Art
Brown finished within four
seconds of one another to become
the third, fourth and fifth
Stanford finishers respectively.
Boutin's fourth place finish was
somewhat of a surprise, and he
moved up on the ladder for next
week.
Sophomore Steve Crowley,
who was expected to do especially
well on the shorter 4.2 mile
course, finished 14th in the race
and sixth among Stanford
runners. After the race he said, "I
felt good at the one-mile mark,
then I don't know what
happened."
Freshmen Stacy Geiken,
probably the best young runner,
felt "really tight at the mile" and
finished in 22:01.
