NAPA, Calif — Johnny Miller scored
his eighth victory of the season and set
a pro golf tour record of $346,933 in
money winnings yesterday with his
easy eight-stroke victory in the Kaiser
International Open.
The victory margin matched the
largest on the tour this year and was
nailed down on a final round of 66,
six-under-par on Miller's home course.
It enabled him to claim $30,000
from the total purse of $150,000,
break a Jack Nicklaus record and tie
another mark held by Arnold Palmer.
Miller, easily the outstanding player
in the game this year, smashed
Nicklaus' single-season money-winning
record of $320,542, set in 1972.

NAPA, Calif — Johnny Miller scored
his eighth victory of the season and set
a pro golf tour record of $346,933 in
money winnings yesterday with his
easy eight-stroke victory in the Kaiser
International Open.
The victory margin matched the
largest on the tour this year and was
nailed down on a final round of 66,
six-under-par on Miller's home course.
It enabled him to claim $30,000
from the total purse of $150,000,
break a Jack Nicklaus record and tie
another mark held by Arnold Palmer.
Miller, easily the outstanding player
in the game this year, smashed
Nicklaus' single-season money-winning
record of $320,542, set in 1972.
