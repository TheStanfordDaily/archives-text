# Soccer Team Stops 'Shotless' Westmont
## 
### DAN PYNE 
In spite of the fact that
Friday's soccer preview article
contained misinformation blatant
enough to create a credibility gap
as wide as the Snake River
Canyon, the Stanford booters
managed to score an impressive
3-0 victory over Westmont last
Saturday morning.
If you read Friday's story,
perhaps you're wondering why
the soccer team played Westmont
twice in one week.
Actually, they didn't.
The Cardinals tied Foothill 0-0
last Wednesday afternoon, and
played Westmont, not California,
on Saturday.
And now that things are
getting straightened out, everyone
is happy that Stanford did beat
Westmont instead of Cal, because
Westmont is ranked 20th in the
nation while Cal is not ranked at
all.
All Dribbling
At the outset of Saturday's
game it appeared Westmont had
things under control, displaying
sharp passing and dribbling, while
Stanford looked shakey. As the
game progressed, however, it
became apparent that all
Westmont was going to do was
pass and dribble, while the
Cardinals started to warm up.
Stanford took a 1-0 lead
midway through the first half on a
breakaway shot by freshman Jim
Melamed, set up by pass from
center forward Phil Wright.
The second Cardinal goal was
the result of one of varsity coach
Bert Baldaccini's 'trick plays' on
an indirect free kick in front of
the Westmont goal.
Very Confusing
The play, which, according to

forward John Gross, is the same
one Brazil used successfully
against East Germany in World
Cup play, is designed to foil the
defensive 'wall' that opposing
backs form in front of an indirect
free kick. Two players take a pass
at the ball, cross, but do not kick
it, and a third player passes to one
of the first two, who takes the
shot.
Confusing?
That's the main idea. The
defensive wall collapses and the
shot scores. Marty Glickfield
made the pass to Wright, who
scored and gave Stanford a 2-0
margin.
Westmont had a chance to get
back within one point but blew a
direct free kick just before the
half. -
John Murao scored Stanford's
final goal, unassisted, on a fast
break in the second half.
Few Shots
Westmont continued to get
within striking distance, but its
continual dribbling usually
prevented the team from taking a
shot. Stanford goalie Bruce
Mosbacher did a creditable job in
preserving the shutout, batting
away several close shots. Late in
the second half, Melamed was
ejected from the game for his part
in the foot-and-fist altercation in
front of the stands. A Westmont
player, displaying a boxing form
that at least equalled his shooting
prowess, was also ejected.
Stanford plays San Jose State,
rated among the top 10 teams in
the nation, tomorrow afternoon
at 3:30. If the Cardinals win, they
will be a big step closer to the
NCAA playoffs.
