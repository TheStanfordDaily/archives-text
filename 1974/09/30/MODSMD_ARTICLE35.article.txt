Cover-Up Trial To Begin
WASHINGTON — The Watergate cover-up trial
begins tomorrow with the full role to be played by
former President Richard M. Nixon still unknown.
Continued optimistic reports about Nixon's
recovery from a phlebitis condition make it more
likely that he will eventually testify as a witness in
the trial.
The former president has been subpoenaed—for
widely differing reasons—as a witness by the
Watergate special prosecutor's office and cover-up
defendant John D. Ehrlichman.
But the prosecutors will need Nixon first, for
strictly legal reasons.
Last spring, Nixon personally handled some of
the tapes of more than 33 conversations he held
with either the defendants or witnesses scheduled to
testify at the trial. The tapes provide a major block
of evidence for the prosecutors.
Defense lawyers refused to permit the tapes to be
admitted without formal authentication that they
are genuine reproductions of White House
conversations which actually took place.
Thus, reluctantly, special prosecutor Leon
Jaworski subpoenaed Nixon to prove the "changed
custody" of the tapes left them undisturbed.
Some defense lawyers say that if Nixon cannot
personally appear to verify the tapes, they may
never be heard by the jury. But a source close to
Jaworski said over the weekend that Jaworski is
confident a way will be found to use them.
Ford To Seek Gas Tax Hike?
WASHINGTON — The Ford administration is
considering asking Congress to raise the federal tax
on gasoline by anywhere from 10 to 20 cents a
gallon, a White House source says.
But the source said the administration fears a
public outcry if and when such a tax plan is
announced and is unsure whether Congress would
approve it.
The purpose of the higher gasoline tax would be
two-fold: to discourage gasoline consumption, and
to raise new tax revenue to finance federal
programs, such as public service unemployment.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.), said after
Ford's economic summit conference Saturday he
expects the Administration will propose the tax
which he predicted would be "highly controversial."
The federal tax on gasoline is now about four
cents a gallon. States also impose a tax on gasoline
averaging about eight cents.
A White House economist said a 10-cent increase
in the gasoline tax would raise about $9 billion in
extra revenue.
Unconditional Amnesty Asked
NEW YORK — A young draft evader says he will
confront President Ford's clemency officials today
in Washington and refuse alternative service in an

effort to win "total, unconditional and universal
amnesty" for all Vietnam-era draft resisters and
deserters.
Bill Meis, 29, of Decatur, 111., who returned to
the United States last week from Canada with help
from the Safe Return Amnesty Committee, based
here, said yesterday he was worried that the
confrontation might result in his arrest.
"But if you commit yourself to action," Meis
said, "you have to be willing to take risks."
Meis, under indictment charging violation of the
Selective Service law, is one of about 4,000 draft
evaders the government considers fugitives — 3,000
of whom are in Canada.
President Ford has offered clemency to draft
dodgers and deserters who return and work at
public service jobs "promoting national health,
safety or interest" for up to 24 months.
Kissinger Returns To U N
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger headed back to the United Nations an
important meeting on the Cyprus crisis yesterday,
but not before devoting some attention to the
Middle East.
He held a 90-minute private meeting with Syrian
Foreign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam today
before leaving for New York.
Kissinger told a newsman afterward the
discussion was "very good and covered the entire
aspect of the Middle East."
Kissinger indicated the two men discussed the
question of an extension for the presence of U.N.
peacekeeping forces in the disengagement zone
between Israel and Syria.
Kissinger and Khaddam also met Saturday and
yesterday. The two men flew together in the
secretary's plane to New York for the continuing
sessions of the U.N. General Assembly.
Kissinger spent three days at the United Nations
last week for discussions with other visiting foreign
ministers. He is expected to stay most of this week,
particularly dealing with the Cyprus question.
His first meeting in this round was with Greek
Foreign Minister George Mavros last night to discuss
ways Kissinger might become more involved in
settling the Greek-Turkish conflict on Cyprus.
Acting as a sort of middleman, Kissinger also
scheduled a meeting this morning with Mavros'
Turkish counterpart, Foreign Minister Turan Gunes.
'Stagflation 9 Pressures Congress
WASHINGTON — The Democratic Congress is
under increasing pressure to work the rest of the
year on ways to fight what speakers at the economy
conference called "stagflation" — a combination of
inflation and economic slowdown.
President Ford told the conference just before it
adjourned Saturday that he will have economic
recommendations before Congress within 10 days.
Congressional leaders plan a recess beginning Oct.

11 until after the November election so members
can go home and campaign. They are not likely to
abandon the recess, though they may start it later.
Ford gave no indication what his legislative
package will contain, saying he wants to digest the
enormous amount of testimony and discussion
accumulated at the summit conference and a series
of preliminary meetings.
First Lady Recovers Satisfactorily
WASHINGTON — President Ford made two
visits to his wife's bedside yesterday as doctors
reported Betty Ford was progressing satisfactorily
after removal of a breast because of cancer.
The President had lunch in his wife's suite at
Bethesda Naval Medical Center, went back to the
White House for a tennis game, then returned to the
hospital last night.
"We haven't looked beyond next week," the
President told reporters when they asked whether
he planned to cancel any more of his campaign
schedule because of his wife's illness.
He gave the same answer when asked if he would
run for re-election in 1976 if his wife didn't want
him to.
No Change In Nixon's Condition
LONG BEACH — Former President Richard M.
Nixon would up his first week in the hospital today
with no reported change in his condition since
Friday. Pat Nixon said Saturday he was feeling
much better.
Nixon's doctor said he would issue the next
medical report on Nixon at noon today and didn't
plan to issue medical reports over the weekend
unless there was a change in the patient's condition.
Dr. John C. Lungren said Friday that Nixon was
responding satisfactorily to the anticoagulant drug
therapy he has been receiving since entering
Memorial Hospital Medical Center last Monday for
treatment of a vein inflamation in his left leg and a
small blood clot in his right lung.
The former chief executive is expected to remain
hospitalized through the end of this week.
Nixon's wife visited him on Saturday along with
his eldest daughter, Tricia Nixon Cox, and the
archbishop of the Los Angeles Roman Catholic
diocese, Cardinal Timothy Manning, who has known
Nixon since 1946.
It was the first visit to the hospital by Tricia
since her father was admitted for treatment of
phlebitis in his left leg. Daughter Julie Nixon
Eisenhower accompanied Nixon when he entered
the hospital.
Today's Weather
Coastal low cloudiness extending inland locally
night and morning. Mostly sunny inland areas
afternoons with variable high cloudiness through
tomorrow. Low temperatures tonight in the low to
mid 50s. Highs both days in the 60s to mid 70s.

evaders the government considers fugitives — 3,000

President Ford has offered clemency to draft
dodgers and deserters who return and work at
public service jobs "promoting national health,

Kissinger Returns To U N
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger headed back to the United Nations an
important meeting on the Cyprus crisis yesterday,
but not before devoting some attention to the
Middle East.
He held a 90-minute private meeting with Syrian
Foreign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam today
before leaving for New York.
Kissinger told a newsman afterward the
discussion was "very good and covered the entire
aspect of the Middle East."
Kissinger indicated the two men discussed the
question of an extension for the presence of U.N.
peacekeeping forces in the disengagement zone
between Israel and Syria.
Kissinger and Khaddam also met Saturday and
yesterday. The two men flew together in the
secretary's plane to New York for the continuing
sessions of the U.N. General Assembly.
Kissinger spent three days at the United Nations
last week for discussions with other visiting foreign
ministers. He is expected to stay most of this week,
particularly dealing with the Cyprus question.
His first meeting in this round was with Greek
Foreign Minister George Mavros last night to discuss
ways Kissinger might become more involved in
settling the Greek-Turkish conflict on Cyprus.
Acting as a sort of middleman, Kissinger also
scheduled a meeting this morning with Mavros'
Turkish counterpart, Foreign Minister Turan Gunes.
'Stagflation 9 Pressures Congress
WASHINGTON — The Democratic Congress is
under increasing pressure to work the rest of the
year on ways to fight what speakers at the economy
conference called "stagflation" — a combination of
inflation and economic slowdown.
President Ford told the conference just before it
adjourned Saturday that he will have economic
recommendations before Congress within 10 days.
Congressional leaders plan a recess beginning Oct.

11 until after the November election so members
can go home and campaign. They are not likely to
abandon the recess, though they may start it later.
Ford gave no indication what his legislative
package will contain, saying he wants to digest the
enormous amount of testimony and discussion
accumulated at the summit conference and a series
of preliminary meetings.
First Lady Recovers Satisfactorily
WASHINGTON — President Ford made two
visits to his wife's bedside yesterday as doctors
reported Betty Ford was progressing satisfactorily
after removal of a breast because of cancer.
The President had lunch in his wife's suite at
Bethesda Naval Medical Center, went back to the
White House for a tennis game, then returned to the
hospital last night.
"We haven't looked beyond next week," the
President told reporters when they asked whether
he planned to cancel any more of his campaign
schedule because of his wife's illness.
He gave the same answer when asked if he would
run for re-election in 1976 if his wife didn't want
him to.
No Change In Nixon's Condition
LONG BEACH — Former President Richard M.
Nixon would up his first week in the hospital today
with no reported change in his condition since
Friday. Pat Nixon said Saturday he was feeling
much better.
Nixon's doctor said he would issue the next
medical report on Nixon at noon today and didn't
plan to issue medical reports over the weekend
unless there was a change in the patient's condition.
Dr. John C. Lungren said Friday that Nixon was
responding satisfactorily to the anticoagulant drug
therapy he has been receiving since entering
Memorial Hospital Medical Center last Monday for
treatment of a vein inflamation in his left leg and a
small blood clot in his right lung.
The former chief executive is expected to remain
hospitalized through the end of this week.
Nixon's wife visited him on Saturday along with
his eldest daughter, Tricia Nixon Cox, and the
archbishop of the Los Angeles Roman Catholic
diocese, Cardinal Timothy Manning, who has known
Nixon since 1946.
It was the first visit to the hospital by Tricia
since her father was admitted for treatment of
phlebitis in his left leg. Daughter Julie Nixon
Eisenhower accompanied Nixon when he entered
the hospital.
Today's Weather
Coastal low cloudiness extending inland locally
night and morning. Mostly sunny inland areas
afternoons with variable high cloudiness through
tomorrow. Low temperatures tonight in the low to
mid 50s. Highs both days in the 60s to mid 70s.
Cover-Up Trial To Begin
WASHINGTON — The Watergate cover-up trial
begins tomorrow with the full role to be played by
former President Richard M. Nixon still unknown.
Continued optimistic reports about Nixon's
recovery from a phlebitis condition make it more
likely that he will eventually testify as a witness in
the trial.
The former president has been subpoenaed—for
widely differing reasons—as a witness by the
Watergate special prosecutor's office and cover-up
defendant John D. Ehrlichman.
But the prosecutors will need Nixon first, for
strictly legal reasons.
Last spring, Nixon personally handled some of
the tapes of more than 33 conversations he held
with either the defendants or witnesses scheduled to
testify at the trial. The tapes provide a major block
of evidence for the prosecutors.
Defense lawyers refused to permit the tapes to be
admitted without formal authentication that they
are genuine reproductions of White House
conversations which actually took place.
Thus, reluctantly, special prosecutor Leon
Jaworski subpoenaed Nixon to prove the "changed
custody" of the tapes left them undisturbed.
Some defense lawyers say that if Nixon cannot
personally appear to verify the tapes, they may
never be heard by the jury. But a source close to
Jaworski said over the weekend that Jaworski is
confident a way will be found to use them.
Ford To Seek Gas Tax Hike?
WASHINGTON — The Ford administration is
considering asking Congress to raise the federal tax
on gasoline by anywhere from 10 to 20 cents a
gallon, a White House source says.
But the source said the administration fears a
public outcry if and when such a tax plan is
announced and is unsure whether Congress would
approve it.
The purpose of the higher gasoline tax would be
two-fold: to discourage gasoline consumption, and
to raise new tax revenue to finance federal
programs, such as public service unemployment.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.), said after
Ford's economic summit conference Saturday he
expects the Administration will propose the tax
which he predicted would be "highly controversial."
The federal tax on gasoline is now about four
cents a gallon. States also impose a tax on gasoline
averaging about eight cents.
A White House economist said a 10-cent increase
in the gasoline tax would raise about $9 billion in
extra revenue.
Unconditional Amnesty Asked
NEW YORK — A young draft evader says he will
confront President Ford's clemency officials today
in Washington and refuse alternative service in an

effort to win "total, unconditional and universal
amnesty" for all Vietnam-era draft resisters and
deserters.
Bill Meis, 29, of Decatur, 111., who returned to
the United States last week from Canada with help
from the Safe Return Amnesty Committee, based
here, said yesterday he was worried that the
confrontation might result in his arrest.
"But if you commit yourself to action," Meis
said, "you have to be willing to take risks."
Meis, under indictment charging violation of the
Selective Service law, is one of about 4,000 draft
evaders the government considers fugitives — 3,000
of whom are in Canada.
President Ford has offered clemency to draft

him to.
No Change In Nixon's Condition
LONG BEACH — Former President Richard M.
Nixon would up his first week in the hospital today
with no reported change in his condition since
Friday. Pat Nixon said Saturday he was feeling
much better.
Nixon's doctor said he would issue the next
medical report on Nixon at noon today and didn't
plan to issue medical reports over the weekend
unless there was a change in the patient's condition.
Dr. John C. Lungren said Friday that Nixon was
responding satisfactorily to the anticoagulant drug
therapy he has been receiving since entering
Memorial Hospital Medical Center last Monday for
treatment of a vein inflamation in his left leg and a
small blood clot in his right lung.
The former chief executive is expected to remain
hospitalized through the end of this week.
Nixon's wife visited him on Saturday along with
his eldest daughter, Tricia Nixon Cox, and the
archbishop of the Los Angeles Roman Catholic
diocese, Cardinal Timothy Manning, who has known
Nixon since 1946.
It was the first visit to the hospital by Tricia
since her father was admitted for treatment of
phlebitis in his left leg. Daughter Julie Nixon
Eisenhower accompanied Nixon when he entered
the hospital.
Today's Weather
Coastal low cloudiness extending inland locally
night and morning. Mostly sunny inland areas
afternoons with variable high cloudiness through
tomorrow. Low temperatures tonight in the low to
mid 50s. Highs both days in the 60s to mid 70s.
Cover-Up Trial To Begin
WASHINGTON — The Watergate cover-up trial
begins tomorrow with the full role to be played by
former President Richard M. Nixon still unknown.
Continued optimistic reports about Nixon's
recovery from a phlebitis condition make it more
likely that he will eventually testify as a witness in
the trial.
The former president has been subpoenaed—for
widely differing reasons—as a witness by the
Watergate special prosecutor's office and cover-up
defendant John D. Ehrlichman.
But the prosecutors will need Nixon first, for
strictly legal reasons.
Last spring, Nixon personally handled some of
the tapes of more than 33 conversations he held
with either the defendants or witnesses scheduled to
testify at the trial. The tapes provide a major block
of evidence for the prosecutors.
Defense lawyers refused to permit the tapes to be
admitted without formal authentication that they
are genuine reproductions of White House
conversations which actually took place.
Thus, reluctantly, special prosecutor Leon
Jaworski subpoenaed Nixon to prove the "changed
custody" of the tapes left them undisturbed.
Some defense lawyers say that if Nixon cannot
personally appear to verify the tapes, they may
never be heard by the jury. But a source close to
Jaworski said over the weekend that Jaworski is
confident a way will be found to use them.
Ford To Seek Gas Tax Hike?
WASHINGTON — The Ford administration is
considering asking Congress to raise the federal tax
on gasoline by anywhere from 10 to 20 cents a
gallon, a White House source says.
But the source said the administration fears a
public outcry if and when such a tax plan is
announced and is unsure whether Congress would
approve it.
The purpose of the higher gasoline tax would be
two-fold: to discourage gasoline consumption, and
to raise new tax revenue to finance federal
programs, such as public service unemployment.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.), said after
Ford's economic summit conference Saturday he
expects the Administration will propose the tax
which he predicted would be "highly controversial."
The federal tax on gasoline is now about four
cents a gallon. States also impose a tax on gasoline
averaging about eight cents.
A White House economist said a 10-cent increase
in the gasoline tax would raise about $9 billion in
extra revenue.
Unconditional Amnesty Asked
NEW YORK — A young draft evader says he will
confront President Ford's clemency officials today
in Washington and refuse alternative service in an

effort to win "total, unconditional and universal
amnesty" for all Vietnam-era draft resisters and
deserters.
Bill Meis, 29, of Decatur, 111., who returned to
the United States last week from Canada with help
from the Safe Return Amnesty Committee, based
here, said yesterday he was worried that the
confrontation might result in his arrest.
"But if you commit yourself to action," Meis
said, "you have to be willing to take risks."
Meis, under indictment charging violation of the
Selective Service law, is one of about 4,000 draft
evaders the government considers fugitives — 3,000
of whom are in Canada.
President Ford has offered clemency to draft
dodgers and deserters who return and work at
public service jobs "promoting national health,
safety or interest" for up to 24 months.
Kissinger Returns To U N
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger headed back to the United Nations an
important meeting on the Cyprus crisis yesterday,
but not before devoting some attention to the
Middle East.
He held a 90-minute private meeting with Syrian
Foreign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam today
before leaving for New York.
Kissinger told a newsman afterward the
discussion was "very good and covered the entire
aspect of the Middle East."
Kissinger indicated the two men discussed the
question of an extension for the presence of U.N.
peacekeeping forces in the disengagement zone
between Israel and Syria.
Kissinger and Khaddam also met Saturday and
yesterday. The two men flew together in the
secretary's plane to New York for the continuing
sessions of the U.N. General Assembly.
Kissinger spent three days at the United Nations
last week for discussions with other visiting foreign
ministers. He is expected to stay most of this week,
particularly dealing with the Cyprus question.
His first meeting in this round was with Greek
Foreign Minister George Mavros last night to discuss
ways Kissinger might become more involved in
settling the Greek-Turkish conflict on Cyprus.
Acting as a sort of middleman, Kissinger also
scheduled a meeting this morning with Mavros'
Turkish counterpart, Foreign Minister Turan Gunes.
'Stagflation 9 Pressures Congress
WASHINGTON — The Democratic Congress is
under increasing pressure to work the rest of the
year on ways to fight what speakers at the economy
conference called "stagflation" — a combination of
inflation and economic slowdown.
President Ford told the conference just before it
adjourned Saturday that he will have economic
recommendations before Congress within 10 days.
Congressional leaders plan a recess beginning Oct.

11 until after the November election so members
can go home and campaign. They are not likely to
abandon the recess, though they may start it later.
Ford gave no indication what his legislative
package will contain, saying he wants to digest the
enormous amount of testimony and discussion
accumulated at the summit conference and a series
of preliminary meetings.
First Lady Recovers Satisfactorily
WASHINGTON — President Ford made two
visits to his wife's bedside yesterday as doctors
reported Betty Ford was progressing satisfactorily
after removal of a breast because of cancer.
The President had lunch in his wife's suite at
Bethesda Naval Medical Center, went back to the
White House for a tennis game, then returned to the
hospital last night.
"We haven't looked beyond next week," the
President told reporters when they asked whether
he planned to cancel any more of his campaign
schedule because of his wife's illness.
He gave the same answer when asked if he would
run for re-election in 1976 if his wife didn't want

gallon, a White House source says.
But the source said the administration fears a
public outcry if and when such a tax plan is
announced and is unsure whether Congress would
approve it.
The purpose of the higher gasoline tax would be
two-fold: to discourage gasoline consumption, and
to raise new tax revenue to finance federal
programs, such as public service unemployment.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.), said after
Ford's economic summit conference Saturday he
expects the Administration will propose the tax
which he predicted would be "highly controversial."
The federal tax on gasoline is now about four
cents a gallon. States also impose a tax on gasoline
averaging about eight cents.
A White House economist said a 10-cent increase
in the gasoline tax would raise about $9 billion in
extra revenue.
Unconditional Amnesty Asked
NEW YORK — A young draft evader says he will
confront President Ford's clemency officials today
in Washington and refuse alternative service in an

effort to win "total, unconditional and universal
amnesty" for all Vietnam-era draft resisters and
deserters.
Bill Meis, 29, of Decatur, 111., who returned to
the United States last week from Canada with help
from the Safe Return Amnesty Committee, based
here, said yesterday he was worried that the
confrontation might result in his arrest.
"But if you commit yourself to action," Meis
said, "you have to be willing to take risks."
Meis, under indictment charging violation of the
Selective Service law, is one of about 4,000 draft
evaders the government considers fugitives — 3,000
of whom are in Canada.
President Ford has offered clemency to draft
dodgers and deserters who return and work at
public service jobs "promoting national health,
safety or interest" for up to 24 months.
Kissinger Returns To U N
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger headed back to the United Nations an
important meeting on the Cyprus crisis yesterday,
but not before devoting some attention to the
Middle East.
He held a 90-minute private meeting with Syrian
Foreign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam today
before leaving for New York.
Kissinger told a newsman afterward the
discussion was "very good and covered the entire
aspect of the Middle East."
Kissinger indicated the two men discussed the
question of an extension for the presence of U.N.
peacekeeping forces in the disengagement zone
between Israel and Syria.
Kissinger and Khaddam also met Saturday and
yesterday. The two men flew together in the
secretary's plane to New York for the continuing
sessions of the U.N. General Assembly.
Kissinger spent three days at the United Nations
last week for discussions with other visiting foreign
ministers. He is expected to stay most of this week,
particularly dealing with the Cyprus question.
His first meeting in this round was with Greek
Foreign Minister George Mavros last night to discuss
ways Kissinger might become more involved in
settling the Greek-Turkish conflict on Cyprus.
Acting as a sort of middleman, Kissinger also
scheduled a meeting this morning with Mavros'
Turkish counterpart, Foreign Minister Turan Gunes.
'Stagflation 9 Pressures Congress
WASHINGTON — The Democratic Congress is
under increasing pressure to work the rest of the
year on ways to fight what speakers at the economy
conference called "stagflation" — a combination of
inflation and economic slowdown.
President Ford told the conference just before it
adjourned Saturday that he will have economic
recommendations before Congress within 10 days.
Congressional leaders plan a recess beginning Oct.

11 until after the November election so members
can go home and campaign. They are not likely to
abandon the recess, though they may start it later.
Ford gave no indication what his legislative
package will contain, saying he wants to digest the
enormous amount of testimony and discussion
accumulated at the summit conference and a series
of preliminary meetings.
First Lady Recovers Satisfactorily
WASHINGTON — President Ford made two
visits to his wife's bedside yesterday as doctors
reported Betty Ford was progressing satisfactorily
after removal of a breast because of cancer.
The President had lunch in his wife's suite at
Bethesda Naval Medical Center, went back to the
White House for a tennis game, then returned to the
hospital last night.
"We haven't looked beyond next week," the
President told reporters when they asked whether
he planned to cancel any more of his campaign
schedule because of his wife's illness.
He gave the same answer when asked if he would
run for re-election in 1976 if his wife didn't want
him to.
No Change In Nixon's Condition
LONG BEACH — Former President Richard M.
Nixon would up his first week in the hospital today
with no reported change in his condition since
Friday. Pat Nixon said Saturday he was feeling
much better.
Nixon's doctor said he would issue the next
medical report on Nixon at noon today and didn't
plan to issue medical reports over the weekend
unless there was a change in the patient's condition.
Dr. John C. Lungren said Friday that Nixon was
responding satisfactorily to the anticoagulant drug
therapy he has been receiving since entering
Memorial Hospital Medical Center last Monday for
treatment of a vein inflamation in his left leg and a
small blood clot in his right lung.
The former chief executive is expected to remain
hospitalized through the end of this week.
Nixon's wife visited him on Saturday along with
his eldest daughter, Tricia Nixon Cox, and the
archbishop of the Los Angeles Roman Catholic
diocese, Cardinal Timothy Manning, who has known
Nixon since 1946.
It was the first visit to the hospital by Tricia
since her father was admitted for treatment of
phlebitis in his left leg. Daughter Julie Nixon
Eisenhower accompanied Nixon when he entered
the hospital.
