# Rival Interests Propose 'Chaparral' Revival Plans
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
Two students have expressed
separate interests in reviving the
Chaparral, a feature magazine which
appeared sporadically before it was
shut down by ASSU Financial
Manager Frank Olivieri because of
alleged mismanagement.
Graduate student Mason Blacher,
who last year served as publisher of
the revived Quad, the student
yearbook, and Mike Dornheim, a
senior and former Chaparral staffer,
have both indicated that they will
submit proposals to the Publications
Board.
"I think it would be a lot of fun to
try the Chaparral," Blacher said. "If I
had a choice, I would have gone to the
Chaparral first [rather than the Quad].
"I used to read Mad and the
Harvard Lampoon, and was very
disappointed to find the Chappie
taken over by the 'radical chic.' " He
would like to make the Chaparral an
all-humor magazine, as it has been at
times in the past.
"I'm not exactly sure what's going
on yet," said Mike Dornheim. He also
would like to change the format of the
Chaparral.
"I want to express dismay over the
way it [the closure of the Chaparral]
was handled this summer," said
Dornheim. He said he doubted the

authority of Olivieri to make such a
move.
"I feel that Mason wants to add the
"Chappie" to his list of
accomplishments," said Dornheim. "It
pains me to see it used this way."
According to Olivieri, Blacher
started preparing his proposal when
the Chaparral was shut down due to a
$2194 printing deficit. Olivieri noted
that Blacher has been successful in the
past, but feels that "the work and
effort involved in turning around the
Chaparral will be much greater."
Blacher, a graduate student, has
already arranged to receive $1,000
from the Dean of Students' Office and
$2,000 from the Vice President and
Provost's office if his proposal is
accepted. A plan is "being worked
on," according to Blacher, to receive
the balance of the trust fund
established by the Hammer and Coffin
Society fraternal organization which
published the Chaparral.
According to Stan Norton, a trustee
of the fund, the remaining $7000 in
the trust fund will probably be meted
out in "a sort of installment plan. We
would like to do it in a way that has a
built-in incentive." He would like the
Chaparral to be self-supporting. "We're
very optimistic and hopeful" said
Norton. The Publications Board will
meet Thursday, October 3 at 4 p.m. to
discuss the Chaparral situation.

alleged mismanagement.
Graduate student Mason Blacher,
who last year served as publisher of
the revived Quad, the student
yearbook, and Mike Dornheim, a
senior and former Chaparral staffer,
have both indicated that they will
submit proposals to the Publications
Board.
"I think it would be a lot of fun to
try the Chaparral," Blacher said. "If I
had a choice, I would have gone to the
Chaparral first [rather than the Quad].
"I used to read Mad and the
Harvard Lampoon, and was very
disappointed to find the Chappie
taken over by the 'radical chic.' " He
would like to make the Chaparral an
all-humor magazine, as it has been at
times in the past.
"I'm not exactly sure what's going
on yet," said Mike Dornheim. He also
would like to change the format of the
Chaparral.
"I want to express dismay over the
way it [the closure of the Chaparral]
was handled this summer," said
Dornheim. He said he doubted the

authority of Olivieri to make such a
move.
"I feel that Mason wants to add the
"Chappie" to his list of
accomplishments," said Dornheim. "It
pains me to see it used this way."
According to Olivieri, Blacher
started preparing his proposal when
the Chaparral was shut down due to a
$2194 printing deficit. Olivieri noted
that Blacher has been successful in the
past, but feels that "the work and
effort involved in turning around the
Chaparral will be much greater."
Blacher, a graduate student, has
already arranged to receive $1,000
from the Dean of Students' Office and
$2,000 from the Vice President and
Provost's office if his proposal is
accepted. A plan is "being worked
on," according to Blacher, to receive
the balance of the trust fund
established by the Hammer and Coffin
Society fraternal organization which
published the Chaparral.
According to Stan Norton, a trustee
of the fund, the remaining $7000 in
the trust fund will probably be meted
out in "a sort of installment plan. We
would like to do it in a way that has a
built-in incentive." He would like the
Chaparral to be self-supporting. "We're
very optimistic and hopeful" said
Norton. The Publications Board will
meet Thursday, October 3 at 4 p.m. to
discuss the Chaparral situation.
Two students have expressed
separate interests in reviving the
Chaparral, a feature magazine which
appeared sporadically before it was
shut down by ASSU Financial
Manager Frank Olivieri because of
alleged mismanagement.
