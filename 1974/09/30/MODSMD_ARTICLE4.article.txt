# Upcoming Tuition Hike Parallels Inflation Rate
## 
### BOB LOWE 
Tuition at Stanford will continue
rising despite the highly successful
$300 million Campaign for Stanford
which has raised 57 percent of its goal,
President Richard W. Lyman said
Friday.
Lyman, addressing the Academic
Council, told faculty members, "We
can and must keep raising tuition at
least... at the same rate" as inflation.
Lyman said the 27-month-old
Campaign for Stanford has raised $171
million thus far and is "more
successful than anyone could have
imagined, given what has befallen the
economy."
But, worldwide inflation and the
"unprecedented failure of the
securities markets" has created serious

financial trouble for the University, he
added.
Money Committed
Lyman noted that much of the
money raised so far is earmarked for
specific purposes or is in the form of
pledges and not readily available.
Tuition, which provides 49 percent
of the operating budget, must increase
because other sources of income are
not keeping pace with inflation, he
said.
While painting a less-than-bright
financial picture for the University,
Lyman warned the Council not to let
concern over the University's money
problems become an obsession.
"Our task at Stanford is not merely
to survive, but to thrive," he said,
encouraging the faculty to think

innovatively and "produce some fresh
answers" to problems in the
University's education.
First Meeting
Meeting for the first time in the
1974-75 academic year, the Council,
besides hearing Lyman's report on the
state of the University, also seriously
changed its own voting procedure,
making mail ballot referendums
mandatory in some cases.
The Academic Council is composed
of all University professors and
Lyman. Normally only a fraction of
the Council's members attend
meetings.
The Faculty Senate is a
representative body of the Council
whose members are elected by Council
members. Most actions taken by the
Senate go to Lyman and the Board of
Trustees for approval automatically,
unless the Academic Council rejects or
modifies the legislation.
Absentees Get Say
Supporters of the mail referendum
amendment praised it for giving absent
members of the Council some say in
the body's actions.
History Prof. Gordon A. Craig,
chairman of the Faculty Senate, said,
"All we are saying here is that
Athenian democracy does not work at
a big University like this ..."
Some Council members opposed
the mail referendum amendment,
largely on the basis that it would make
the Council meetings useless and
reduce already poor attendance.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz said the
amendment would result in "sterile
efficiency," and "emasculate" the
Council meetings.
"I predict that we will never be able
to get a quorum," Rebholz said,
adding that only Lyman, the academic
secretary and people introducing
memorial resolutions would attend the
meetings.

Lyman noted that much of the
money raised so far is earmarked for
specific purposes or is in the form of
pledges and not readily available.
Tuition, which provides 49 percent
of the operating budget, must increase
because other sources of income are
not keeping pace with inflation, he
said.
While painting a less-than-bright
financial picture for the University,
Lyman warned the Council not to let
concern over the University's money
problems become an obsession.
"Our task at Stanford is not merely
to survive, but to thrive," he said,
encouraging the faculty to think

innovatively and "produce some fresh
answers" to problems in the
University's education.
First Meeting
Meeting for the first time in the
1974-75 academic year, the Council,
besides hearing Lyman's report on the
state of the University, also seriously
changed its own voting procedure,
making mail ballot referendums
mandatory in some cases.
The Academic Council is composed
of all University professors and
Lyman. Normally only a fraction of
the Council's members attend
meetings.
The Faculty Senate is a
representative body of the Council
whose members are elected by Council
members. Most actions taken by the
Senate go to Lyman and the Board of
Trustees for approval automatically,
unless the Academic Council rejects or
modifies the legislation.
Absentees Get Say
Supporters of the mail referendum
amendment praised it for giving absent
members of the Council some say in
the body's actions.
History Prof. Gordon A. Craig,
chairman of the Faculty Senate, said,
"All we are saying here is that
Athenian democracy does not work at
a big University like this ..."
Some Council members opposed
the mail referendum amendment,
largely on the basis that it would make
the Council meetings useless and
reduce already poor attendance.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz said the
amendment would result in "sterile
efficiency," and "emasculate" the
Council meetings.
"I predict that we will never be able
to get a quorum," Rebholz said,
adding that only Lyman, the academic
secretary and people introducing
memorial resolutions would attend the
meetings.
Tuition at Stanford will continue
rising despite the highly successful
$300 million Campaign for Stanford
which has raised 57 percent of its goal,
President Richard W. Lyman said
Friday.
Lyman, addressing the Academic
Council, told faculty members, "We
can and must keep raising tuition at
least... at the same rate" as inflation.
Lyman said the 27-month-old
Campaign for Stanford has raised $171
million thus far and is "more
successful than anyone could have
imagined, given what has befallen the
economy."
But, worldwide inflation and the
"unprecedented failure of the
securities markets" has created serious

financial trouble for the University, he
added.
Money Committed
