# New Clearinghouse To Expand Undergraduate Research Efforts
## 
### ROGER THOMPSON 
A new clearing house will attempt to provide
ways for undergraduates with a strong interest in a
project to work with faculty in research situations.
One of the main purposes of the program is to
increase faculty-undergraduate interaction,
according to the program's initiator, B. Michael
Closson, assistant dean of undergraduate studies.
Selection for the approximately 100 research
slots in about 60 different projects ranging from
medicine and biology to political science will be
handled by the individual faculty sponsor. But the
program will assist students who have research ideas
in attempting to find faculty research sponsors.
Nothing more than an interest in the project is
required for some of the positions; others
necessitate knowledge of lab techniques and subject
matter.
Opportunities Directory
Research opportunities are listed in the Directory
of Undergraduate Research Opportunities, but
supplies of copies from the initial printing were
exhausted last week. Additional copies should be
available today in the SWOPSI office and the
Academic Information Center.

Some of the research positions could be
considered full-time jobs, requiring as many as 10
hours a week during the school year and 40 hours
weekly during the summer. Others require only
several hours a week for a quarter.
Compensation for research work will come in the
form of pay or academic credit.
Acknowledging that there exists a danger of tasks
for the undergraduate becoming menial and of little
academic value, Closson said his office will attempt
to insure that the positions remain truly
research-oriented.
Program To Expand?
Because the need for undergraduate research help
is on the rise, Closson said he envisions the program
as two or three times larger next year.
Closson also hopes to find permanent
department representatives to provide news of new
research programs as they are initiated.
The idea for the service comes from a program at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology now in
its fifth year.
Last May a questionnaire was distributed to
faculty members attempting to determine their

receptiveness to the idea. Of the 35 percent
returning the survey, over 95 percent liked the idea.
Faculty Surveyed
Generally, the faculty indicated that students
could provide assistance in the implementation of
research ideas, and saw the approach as an alternate
way of interacting with and teaching students.
About 32 percent said they would be interested
in having an undergraduate research assistant if they
were required to underwrite the hiring costs.
But almost 80 percent of the faculty members
returning the questionnaire said they would employ
undergraduates if the costs were covered by the
University.
Funding Request
Closson is preparing a request for funding from
the University. It will be presented in a few weeks.
Closson hopes to expand the program, which
now emphasizes biology, chemistry, and medicine,
to include more research opportunities in the social
sciences and humanities. Such organizations as the
Hoover Institution and the Food Research Institute
might also take part, he said.

SEARCHING FOR RESEARCH?—B. Michael Closson, assistant dean of
undergraduate studies, has initiated a program allowing undergraduates to work
on research with faculty members. Closson hopes the plan will increase
faculty-undergraduate interaction and broaden research opportunities.
