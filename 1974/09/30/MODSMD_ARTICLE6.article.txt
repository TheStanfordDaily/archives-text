The housing shortage did not just come about; it was
created because of poor foresight and planning. In order to
ensure that this problem does not recur, the housing office
has undertaken a study which, in part, recommends the
construction of 850 units for undergraduates over the next
10 years.
The importance of this study cannot be underestimated.
If Stanford is to honestly maintain its status as a residential
university, the demand for undergraduate housing must be
met.
When the Board of Trustees meets next month, we urge
the Trustees to give top priority to the construction of
student residences as outlined in the housing office report.
While we realize the importance of a new library and other
facilities, we believe Stanford must expand its residence
system to meet the demands if it is to continue to attract
the high caliber of students it does now.
We urge that Stage I, which would add 150 spaces in
three new Row houses, be approved immediately so that
construction can begin in time to have the houses ready for
occupancy by September 1976.
Stage 11, which will provide the bulk of the new housing,
should also be given serious consideration and high priority,
although we realize its massive cost must be balanced against
other future expenditures.
Until the housing shortage is alleviated, we insist that the
University be honest with persons applying for admission,
especially transfers who quite often experience the housing
crunch immediately upon their arrival.
It is not fair that students who are drawn toward
Stanford because of its advertised residential education
suddenly discover that they may be forced to live off
campus because of the lack of residence space.
Specifically, we urge the Admissions Office to inform all
applicants, in writing, of the scarcity of campus housing for
undergraduates as part of the first step in the admissions
process.
