# Clearing House

### 
The only saving grace for those students forced off
campus by the housing draw was the Clearing House, where
students could go to check lists of available off-campus
housing. We commend the patient and dedicated Clearing
House volunteers who put up with the harried homeless
these last few weeks.
Not only have the volunteers helped the students find
off-campus housing, but they have also improved the
attitude of those who have been pushed off campus.
The Clearing House Hotel and the Eating Clubs offered
house-hunting students inexpensive accommodations and a
convenient place to meet people. Also, for those students
who found housing, the Clearing House organized field trips
to Alcatraz and San Franciscoâ€”appreciated alternatives to
views of Palo Alto apartments.
Although the Clearing House couldn't solve the housing
dilemma, at least it helped students deal with it. Here's to a
job well done.
