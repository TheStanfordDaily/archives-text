CORRECTION "'1
Thursday's Daily incorrectly!
reported the comparative I
; advertising rates of the Daily and :f
Live Oak, a weekly student §
newspaper which appeared for the §
| first time Friday.
The statement by Daily 1
advertising manager Lee Hanley §
| that Live Oak rates were "noticeably 1
I lower than ours" was based on the §
| quoted rates for the two 1
I publications. The Daily charges |
I $3.15 per column inch, while Live I
. Oak lists a rate of $2.85.
| However, the latter publication |
prints on a smaller column width 1
| than the Daily—l.67 inches as |
opposed to 2.00 inches.
| In terms of actual advertising!
I space, it costs $1.71 per square inch 112
I to advertise in Live Oak. The Daily 1
charges $1.58 for the same amount |
| of space.
