# Cover-Up Trial Opens; Strachan Case Delayed
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
WASHINGTON - U.S. District
Judge John J. Sirica will begin the
Watergate cover-up trial today with five
defendants instead of six.
With 24 hours to go before the start
of jury selection, Sirica granted
yesterday a request from Special
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski that former
White House aide Gordon Strachan be
given a separate trial.
The renewed request from
Strachan's lawyers that the conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and perjury
charges against him be dismissed was
turned down by Sirica.
Among the five remaining
defendants are three of former
President Richard Nixon's closest
advisors, H.R. Haldeman, John D.
Erhlichman and former Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell.
Remaining Issues
Meanwhile, Sirica tried in a closed
hearing yesterday to clear up
remaining legal issues.
Among those apparently called to
testify at the closed hearing was
former White House chief of staff
Haldeman, whose lawyers are
questioning the accuracy of transcripts
of White House tapes prepared by the
special prosecutor's office.
Another issue is whether the 33
presidential tapes the prosecutors want
used as evidence can be authenticated
without an appearance in the
courtroom by Nixon.
While the transcripts question is
likely to be cleared up before Sirica
begins questioning a pool of 1,000
prospective jurors, the authentication
issue is likely to be held off for a week
or 10 days.
Spectators
Also yesterday, Sirica decided that
half the public seats in the courtroom
would go to spectators who are
expected to line the halls of the U.S.
District Courthouse in hopes of getting
a seat.
The order sharply limits the
number of news organizations which
can be represented full time in the
courtroom.

Inside the courtroom, technicians
were busy placing finishing touches on
the listening system which will allow
the jury and everyone else to hear the
White House tapes on individually
installed earphones.
Strachan's Trial
Strachan's separate trial is unlikely
to begin before the end of the current
Watergate trial, expected to take a
minimum of three months. In his
order, Sirica said the legal issues
Strachan raised merit a separate
pre-trial hearing, for which there was
no time before the main trial begins.
At issue in Strachan's case is
testimony he gave to a Watergate
grand jury in exchange for what he
believes to be the promise that he
would not be prosecuted.
The former personal aide to
Haldeman claims that when the
immunity deal fell through, the special
prosecutor's office improperly used
the grand jury testimony as part of the
evidence in the indictment.
The trial, if it begins on time, could
mark the beginning of the end of the
greatest political scandal in the
nation's history, one that shook
confidence in the governmental system
itself and in the end toppled a
presidency.
However, it seems certain that
other legal actions and appeals will
make it at least another several years
before all Watergate-related matters
are resolved.
Still Probing
In fact, a federal grand jury is
reportedly still probing the financing
of President Nixon's 1972 re-election
campaign, including the alleged "sale"
of ambassadorships.
That investigation, which hasn't yet
produced any indictments, has
nonetheless already taken a toll,
especially visible at Stanford.
Earlier this year, it was disclosed
that Thomas V. Jones, a Stanford
trustee and chairman and president of
Northrop Corp., a Los Angeles
aeronautics concern, had illegally
funneled corporate funds into the
President's campaign.

reportedly still probing the financing
of President Nixon's 1972 re-election
campaign, including the alleged "sale"
of ambassadorships.
That investigation, which hasn't yet
produced any indictments, has
nonetheless already taken a toll,
especially visible at Stanford.
Earlier this year, it was disclosed
that Thomas V. Jones, a Stanford
trustee and chairman and president of

aeronautics concern, had illegally
funneled corporate funds into the
President's campaign.

WASHINGTON - U.S. District
Judge John J. Sirica will begin the
Watergate cover-up trial today with five
defendants instead of six.
With 24 hours to go before the start
of jury selection, Sirica granted
yesterday a request from Special
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski that former
White House aide Gordon Strachan be
given a separate trial.
The renewed request from
Strachan's lawyers that the conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and perjury
charges against him be dismissed was
turned down by Sirica.
Among the five remaining
defendants are three of former
President Richard Nixon's closest
advisors, H.R. Haldeman, John D.
Erhlichman and former Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell.
Remaining Issues
Meanwhile, Sirica tried in a closed
hearing yesterday to clear up
remaining legal issues.
Among those apparently called to
testify at the closed hearing was
former White House chief of staff
Haldeman, whose lawyers are
questioning the accuracy of transcripts
of White House tapes prepared by the
special prosecutor's office.
Another issue is whether the 33
presidential tapes the prosecutors want
used as evidence can be authenticated
without an appearance in the
courtroom by Nixon.
While the transcripts question is
likely to be cleared up before Sirica
begins questioning a pool of 1,000
prospective jurors, the authentication
issue is likely to be held off for a week
or 10 days.
Spectators
Also yesterday, Sirica decided that
half the public seats in the courtroom
would go to spectators who are
expected to line the halls of the U.S.
District Courthouse in hopes of getting
a seat.
The order sharply limits the
number of news organizations which
can be represented full time in the
courtroom.

Inside the courtroom, technicians
were busy placing finishing touches on
the listening system which will allow
the jury and everyone else to hear the
White House tapes on individually
installed earphones.
Strachan's Trial
Strachan's separate trial is unlikely
to begin before the end of the current
Watergate trial, expected to take a
minimum of three months. In his
order, Sirica said the legal issues
Strachan raised merit a separate
pre-trial hearing, for which there was
no time before the main trial begins.
At issue in Strachan's case is
testimony he gave to a Watergate
grand jury in exchange for what he
believes to be the promise that he
would not be prosecuted.
The former personal aide to
Haldeman claims that when the
immunity deal fell through, the special
prosecutor's office improperly used
the grand jury testimony as part of the
evidence in the indictment.
The trial, if it begins on time, could
mark the beginning of the end of the
greatest political scandal in the
nation's history, one that shook
confidence in the governmental system
itself and in the end toppled a
presidency.
However, it seems certain that
other legal actions and appeals will
make it at least another several years
before all Watergate-related matters
are resolved.
Still Probing
In fact, a federal grand jury is
reportedly still probing the financing
of President Nixon's 1972 re-election
campaign, including the alleged "sale"
of ambassadorships.
