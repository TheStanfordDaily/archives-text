# The 						Myth Of Presidential Knowledge
## 
### 
Bill Evers

The publication of the White House tape
transcripts had a shattering effect on the
image of Richard Nixon. The tapes also
desanctified the office of the Presidency in
the eyes of some of the public.
For the last 50 years, many social
scientists have been affectionate toward the
executive branch. The aggrandizement of
power by the government has been seen as
both necessary and desirable.
But now all students of politics are faced
with hard, though fragmentary, evidence on
the day-to-day inner workings of
government. TTie tape transcripts are
documentary evidence of what information
and values go into the decision-making
process.
With this new evidence in hand we can
proceed to re-examine some hypotheses. For
example, political scientist James N. Murray
Jr. has written: "The executive's position of
supremacy in foreign policy results from his
exclusive access to all sources of information
on which foreign policy is based. . .. Under
these circumstances even the most
hardworking and sincere congressman,
concerned with foreign policy issues, might
well feel constrained to go along with the
President on the grounds that the latter may
know more about the situation."
Weak Hypothesis
Looking objectively at the empirical
evidence in the White House tapes, as Murray
N. Rothbard does in the October Harper's, it
becomes clear that hypotheses like James

Murray's do not stand up well.
Many people believe, in part because of
textbook writers like James Murray, that the
important information about American
society and the rest of the world is gathered
in and then passed upward through the
various levels of the government.
At each level the unimportant is
discarded, until at the top of the pyramid,
the President knows, in Rothbard's words,
"the most crucial things about every facet of
reality, the pristine distillate of the world's
critical information."
Bad News Suppressed
In fact, Rothbard writes, almost the
reverse occurs: "Less and less gets known as
we move to the top. Not only is much vital
information lost at each step of the process,
but also there is a built-in bias to throw away
unpleasant data. Advancing in the hierarchy
depends on pleasing one's superiors, and
good news confirms their own previous
estimates of reality."
James Murray talks about Congressmen
going along with the President because he
knows. In addition, there is considerable
social pressure on members of the general
public to go along with the President because
he knows. But it is clear from the White
House tapes that the President "knows
considerably less than any well-informed
reader of the New York Times."
Another frequently encountered
hypothesis concerns the alleged
farsightedness of the President. For instance,

James MacGregor Burns and J.W. Peltason
speak of the President having to "plan far
ahead when people are thinking only of
immediate problems."
Rothbard writes: "Orthodox political
scientists also maintain that while private
citizens are wrapped up in grubby,
short-range concerns, the rulers of
government, up there on Mount Olympus,
can and do plan wisely for the future."
Short-Range Vision
But, Rothbard contends, the White House
tapes show the "almost incredibly
short-range vision" of top government
officials. They are concerned not just with
winning the upcoming election, but with the
upcoming national TV news.
Rothbard cites as an example the Nixon
belief that the transcripts would be a
propaganda coup on his behalf. Yet as soon
as they began to be digested, the adverse
reaction set in.
Instead of the present poor processing of
information that we find in the government,
there is the alternative of the market
economy. As economist F.A. Hayek has
demonstrated, the free market is unequaled
in its ability to process and use information.
A just and a much more efficient society
could well exist without a government and
with market-oriented institutions delivering
all services.

proceed to re-examine some hypotheses. For
example, political scientist James N. Murray
Jr. has written: "The executive's position of
supremacy in foreign policy results from his
exclusive access to all sources of information
on which foreign policy is based. . .. Under
these circumstances even the most
hardworking and sincere congressman,
concerned with foreign policy issues, might
well feel constrained to go along with the
President on the grounds that the latter may
know more about the situation."
Weak Hypothesis
Looking objectively at the empirical
evidence in the White House tapes, as Murray
N. Rothbard does in the October Harper's, it
becomes clear that hypotheses like James

Murray's do not stand up well.
Many people believe, in part because of
textbook writers like James Murray, that the
important information about American
society and the rest of the world is gathered
in and then passed upward through the
various levels of the government.
At each level the unimportant is
discarded, until at the top of the pyramid,
the President knows, in Rothbard's words,
"the most crucial things about every facet of
reality, the pristine distillate of the world's
critical information."
Bad News Suppressed
In fact, Rothbard writes, almost the
reverse occurs: "Less and less gets known as
we move to the top. Not only is much vital
information lost at each step of the process,
but also there is a built-in bias to throw away
unpleasant data. Advancing in the hierarchy
depends on pleasing one's superiors, and
good news confirms their own previous
estimates of reality."
James Murray talks about Congressmen
going along with the President because he
knows. In addition, there is considerable
social pressure on members of the general
public to go along with the President because
he knows. But it is clear from the White
House tapes that the President "knows
considerably less than any well-informed
reader of the New York Times."
Another frequently encountered
hypothesis concerns the alleged
farsightedness of the President. For instance,

James MacGregor Burns and J.W. Peltason
speak of the President having to "plan far
ahead when people are thinking only of
immediate problems."
Rothbard writes: "Orthodox political
scientists also maintain that while private
citizens are wrapped up in grubby,
short-range concerns, the rulers of
government, up there on Mount Olympus,
can and do plan wisely for the future."
Short-Range Vision
But, Rothbard contends, the White House
tapes show the "almost incredibly
short-range vision" of top government
officials. They are concerned not just with
winning the upcoming election, but with the
upcoming national TV news.
Rothbard cites as an example the Nixon
belief that the transcripts would be a
propaganda coup on his behalf. Yet as soon
as they began to be digested, the adverse
reaction set in.
Instead of the present poor processing of
information that we find in the government,
there is the alternative of the market
economy. As economist F.A. Hayek has
demonstrated, the free market is unequaled
in its ability to process and use information.
A just and a much more efficient society
could well exist without a government and
with market-oriented institutions delivering
all services.

The publication of the White House tape
transcripts had a shattering effect on the
image of Richard Nixon. The tapes also
desanctified the office of the Presidency in
the eyes of some of the public.
For the last 50 years, many social
scientists have been affectionate toward the
executive branch. The aggrandizement of
power by the government has been seen as
both necessary and desirable.
But now all students of politics are faced
with hard, though fragmentary, evidence on
the day-to-day inner workings of
government. TTie tape transcripts are
documentary evidence of what information
and values go into the decision-making
process.
With this new evidence in hand we can
proceed to re-examine some hypotheses. For

Jr. has written: "The executive's position of
