# Housing--Time To Change Priorities
## 
### 
Schutt, Viener

In July the housing office
issued a report entitled
"Undergraduate Housing Needs at
Stanford 1974-1984." In general
we agree with the report's
arguments and recommendations.
However, after careful study we
have decided that several topics
require additional discussion. We
have written a 12-page paper
supplementing and constructively
criticizing this report. This article
is a synopsis of our paper.
The University report
calculates a student demand for
390 incremental housing units.
Our analysis found this to be
extremely conservative.
Using the figures given in the
report, we have calculated the
true demand to be much closer to
595, and we recommend that this
many places be built. We agree
with the report that the 460
places in Manzanita Park should
be replaced as soon as possible.
The report recommends that
three Row houses (for 150
students) be constructed for
occupancy in 1976 and that a
dorm (for 700 students) be built
in stages next to Lagunita Hall
and the golf driving range with
expected occupancy in
1978-1982.
Timetable Too Slow
Considering the current
housing situation at Stanford and
in Palo Alto, this timetable is
much too slow. As much as we
hate the trailers, we recommend
that some sort of temporary
housing be constructed
immediately for occupancy next
September. This housing should
be replaced as soon as it is
possible to do so. (The campus
does not need another
"temporary" housing complex.)
Five rather than three Row
houses should be built by 1976
and a dormitory or more Row
houses for 750 students ought to
be completed by 1980 at the
latest.

The location of the proposed
dormitory is poor. The Santa
Teresa site is too far away from
the central campus area for a
student residence. We believe that
the proposed site of the Emeriti
Faculty condominiums on
Mayfield Avenue would be a
much better location for Row
houses (or a dorm) and that the
Santa Teresa site would be a
better location for the Emeriti
Faculty project. The present
location of Manzanita Park would
also be a good location for
another dormitory.
The report presents extensive
calculations showing different
schemes for financing new
housing construction. The
underlying theme of this section
of the report is that financing may
not be available when the time
comes to build, or that the
University might stop the building
program because it feels that the
resulting room and board
increases would price Stanford
out of the student market.
Desperate Problem
We believe that student
housing is the most desperate
problem at Stanford today. Yet a
new Chemistry building,
Engineering building, Music
building, and ar addition to the
Main Library are being planned.
A new expensive Law School is
being built and an Education
Research building has just been
completed. The $300 million
contribution drive has a paltry $3
million targeted for student
housing, none of which has been
collected so far.
We think that student housing
should be reassigned a very high
priority and that all funds that
can legally be shifted from other
projects should be.
Everyone Affected
The issue of undergraduate
housing is one that affects
students financially, socially, and
academically. At ci rrent rates, 56

percent of all undergraduates will
be unassigned after Round II of
the Draw during one of their years
here and 39 percent will be
assigned to the trailers.
In its preface the report tells
the consequences of not building
adequate housing for
undergraduates. We repeat this for
emphasis: "The continuing
problem of being unable to
provide sufficient on-campus
housing at Stanford cannot help
but adversely affect our ability to
attract and to enroll, in
competition with such other
universities as Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton (all of which provide
on-campus housing, and at that, in

a more continuous fashion than
can we, for all four years), a
significant proportion of the most
able high school graduates each
year.
It is simply the case that a
university with well-knwon
insufficient residence capacity
may not for long be able to
attract a national undergraduate
student body of exceptional
quality."
