# A 						View From Abroad

Imagine living in a dormitory
for the past six months with 50
Stanford students in the middle of
France in the middle-sized,
middle-class city of Tours.
Then, imagine that your only
means of contact with the
English-speaking world is the
International Herald-Tribune.
The Herald-Tribune would
arrive every day except Sunday at
4:30 p.m. with students pouncing
on it, hoping to read the latest
Watergate events.
The articles were quite
explicit: the 18-minute gap in the
tapes, Nixon's withholding of the
tapes, Nixon's lies, the
resignation, President Gerald
Ford, the honeymoon.
The news was totally objective,
showing no intense television
coverage of the House Judiciary
Committee hearings, no biting
analyses by Eric Sevareid, no
protests from the White House
gates direct to your living room.
The Watergate Game
Watergate was a game to the
French — with too many players
and too many pieces to put
together. Instead, they enjoyed
the euphoria of the first months
of their own presidential
administration and basked in the
sun on the pebbled beaches at
Nice.
As an American student in
Tours, you were detached from
the emotionalism raging at home.
You were merely an observer.
You undoubtedly had previous
feelings about Nixon — good, bad
or indifferent — but they became
irrelevant: events had taken a
more definite turn. Impeachment
or resignation was imminent.
People at home were enmeshed
in the muck of Watergate. All the
while, you wondered what all the
fuss was about.
Protective Cocoon
You traveled on weekends to
Paris, to the Normandy beaches,
to the Riviera, and to Florence in
a cocoon — a train — sheltered,
and most probably spared, from
the news in America.
While America wallowed,
Europe had seen changes of
governemnt in Portugal, Spain,
England, Germany, Italy (so, what
else is new?), Greece, Cyprus,
Israel and, not to mention,
France. Europe seemed to have
graver problems than the United
States: inflation more accelerated,
unemployment higher, and the
standard of living lower.
Europe's complex problems
were solved with simple solutions.
When Willy Brandt knew of the
spy scandal in his cabinet, he
quickly resigned. The British
resolutely turned off their lights
and reverted to a three-day work
week in a show of unity not seen
since the blitzkrieg.
France buried their late
President Georges Pompidou and
moved into a new era — away
from Gaullism.
Long Ousting Process
America took great pains to
oust Richard Nixon. The entire
process took over two years: from
the break-in at Democratic
Headquarters at the Watergate to
the August resignation.
In Strasbourg, France, a city
on the Rhine near the German
border, Nixon's fateful day in
August was marked by rain and
cold weather.
The capital of Alsace,
Strasbourg has had its share of
problems. The Strasbourgeois
have changed from one
nationality to another with the
victories and defeats of the
French at the hands of the
Germans.
They know how a government
is overthrown and how another
replaces it. They are prepared for
possible changes in language,
customs and personalities.
The fog encircled the single
gothic tower on the cathedral —
the pride of Strasbourg. The red
tower seemed redder that day,
darkened by the dampness. The
headlines were dark, black and
bold on that wet day of August,
announcing Nixon's resignation.
Foreigners Oblivious
The Strasbourgeois seemed
oblivious to the American affairs.
Noting the headlines, they calmly
walked away from the news stand.
Life would continue unaltered
here.
Back at Tours, the
correspondents showed relief after
the resignation, a relief that you
could not share. The emotions,
the minute-by-minute deluge of
news reports and the instant
replay were non-existent in
Europe.
Six months had passed — six
months of Paris, Madrid, Vienna,
Rome, Athens and Strasbourg.
What was all the fuss about?

and reverted to a three-day work
week in a show of unity not seen
since the blitzkrieg.
France buried their late
President Georges Pompidou and
moved into a new era — away
from Gaullism.
Long Ousting Process
America took great pains to
oust Richard Nixon. The entire
process took over two years: from
the break-in at Democratic
Headquarters at the Watergate to
the August resignation.
In Strasbourg, France, a city
on the Rhine near the German
border, Nixon's fateful day in
August was marked by rain and
cold weather.
The capital of Alsace,
Strasbourg has had its share of
problems. The Strasbourgeois
have changed from one
nationality to another with the
victories and defeats of the
French at the hands of the
Germans.
They know how a government
is overthrown and how another
replaces it. They are prepared for
possible changes in language,
customs and personalities.
The fog encircled the single
gothic tower on the cathedral —
the pride of Strasbourg. The red
tower seemed redder that day,
darkened by the dampness. The
headlines were dark, black and
bold on that wet day of August,
announcing Nixon's resignation.
Foreigners Oblivious
The Strasbourgeois seemed
oblivious to the American affairs.
Noting the headlines, they calmly
walked away from the news stand.
Life would continue unaltered
here.
Back at Tours, the
correspondents showed relief after
the resignation, a relief that you
could not share. The emotions,
the minute-by-minute deluge of
news reports and the instant
replay were non-existent in
Europe.
Six months had passed — six
months of Paris, Madrid, Vienna,
Rome, Athens and Strasbourg.
What was all the fuss about?
(Philip Feder is a Daily reporter.)
Philip Feeler

Imagine living in a dormitory
for the past six months with 50
Stanford students in the middle of
France in the middle-sized,
middle-class city of Tours.
Then, imagine that your only
means of contact with the
English-speaking world is the
International Herald-Tribune.
The Herald-Tribune would
arrive every day except Sunday at
4:30 p.m. with students pouncing
on it, hoping to read the latest
Watergate events.
The articles were quite
explicit: the 18-minute gap in the
tapes, Nixon's withholding of the
tapes, Nixon's lies, the
resignation, President Gerald
Ford, the honeymoon.
The news was totally objective,
showing no intense television
coverage of the House Judiciary
Committee hearings, no biting
analyses by Eric Sevareid, no
protests from the White House
gates direct to your living room.
The Watergate Game
Watergate was a game to the
French — with too many players
and too many pieces to put
together. Instead, they enjoyed
the euphoria of the first months
of their own presidential
administration and basked in the
sun on the pebbled beaches at
Nice.
As an American student in
Tours, you were detached from
the emotionalism raging at home.
You were merely an observer.
You undoubtedly had previous
feelings about Nixon — good, bad
or indifferent — but they became
irrelevant: events had taken a
more definite turn. Impeachment
or resignation was imminent.
People at home were enmeshed
in the muck of Watergate. All the
while, you wondered what all the
fuss was about.
Protective Cocoon
You traveled on weekends to
Paris, to the Normandy beaches,
to the Riviera, and to Florence in
a cocoon — a train — sheltered,
and most probably spared, from
the news in America.
While America wallowed,
Europe had seen changes of
governemnt in Portugal, Spain,
England, Germany, Italy (so, what
else is new?), Greece, Cyprus,
Israel and, not to mention,
France. Europe seemed to have
graver problems than the United
States: inflation more accelerated,
unemployment higher, and the
standard of living lower.
Europe's complex problems
were solved with simple solutions.
When Willy Brandt knew of the
spy scandal in his cabinet, he
quickly resigned. The British
resolutely turned off their lights
and reverted to a three-day work
week in a show of unity not seen
since the blitzkrieg.
