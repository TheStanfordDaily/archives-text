## Isralow Probes Rock Music Roots 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
"Yeah, I have 10,000 records. About 3500 albums,
4500 455, and 1000 singles or 78s, and they're heavy,"
explains rock music historian Eric Isralow, perhaps
assuming his audience is too young to know what a 78 is.
"Records to me are historical artifacts. They're my
tools. Like a plumber wouldn't throw away his tools, I
wouldn't give away my records.
"When I moved out here from the east I had about
3000 books. I gave most of my books away; I wouldn't
give away my records."
Rock History
Isralow is keeping his 10,000 records in his attic
apartment in Berkeley while traveling to Stanford on
Mondays and Wednesdays to teach "The History of Rock
and Roll" under the sponsorship of The Committee On
Black Performing Arts. <
"Music I think by far is the most influencial medium
today," says Isralow, citing the $2 billion in record sales
last year which topped the market for any form of
entertainment.
Isralow utilizes records, live musicians and

demonstrations to teach the relationship between
American culture and music from the late 1940s to the
present. Racism, sexism, drugs and politics form the
sociological syncopation to the history of artists and
songs.
"The 50s were not very good times," says Isralow in
argument against the kind of nostalgia popularized by
American Grafitti and its many spinoffs.
Repression, Recession
"The 50s were sexually repressive, they were politically
repressive. You had a recession in the 50s, you had
Eisenhower, and of course you had Dick Nixon. There was
MeCarthyism. McCarthyism flourished in the 50s.
"I think people should remember the 50s for
McCarthy, not for the good times," Isralow almost
concludes, adding, "The only good thing about the 50s
was rock and roll."
Even rock and roll wasn't entirely good, and much of
what was good was stolen from black artists and released
in bleached-out versions called "cover records" by white
artists for white audiences.
"Of course, the ultimate example of this is Pat Boone,"

cites Isralow, noting Boone's version of Little Richard's
song, "Tutti Frutti."
Terrified Parents
In what Isralow contends was a racist society at the
peak of its tensions, Boone was acceptable to parents and
adolescents who were essentially terrified of blacks.
To give his classes a feel for what Boone was like in his
historical context, Isralow explains, "When 1 had a really
large class I went down to the Salvation Army and got
some white bucks and a cardigan sweater and I walked in
from the back of the class lip syncing "Love Letters In
The Sand."
In the same spirit, Isralow has impersonated Elvis
Presley for classes, demonstrating, "why they didn't show
the lower half of his body on The Ed Sullivan Show."
KSFX D.J.
Despite a master's degree in counseling psychology and
a stint as disc jockey at KSFX, Isralow is most satisfied
with his role as a teacher, personifying his belief that "a
good teacher is also an entertainer."
Isralow has given his course as well as individual
lectures on campuses across the country occasionally
attracting enrollments of 300 or more. Sometimes giving a
lecture becomes an education for the instructor.
Recently Isralow was addressing a group from the
National Organization For Women, and as part of a
discussion of sexism in rock he played the 50s classic
"Bobby's Girl." The members of NOW all sang along, "I
wanna be Bobby's girl." They also sang along to the
Rolling Stones," "Under My Thumb."
"As politicized as they are, they still get conditioned by
their music," explains Isralow.
Beatles' Basis
Complicated as Isralow claims the relationship between
music and culture is, even The Beatles phenomenon can be
explained more in cultural terms than on the basis of
musical merit.
"The people made The Beatles great; it's never the
music, it's always the people," states Isralow, further
explaining that the unique social circumstances of the
1960s coming out of the relative repression of the 50s gave
The Beatles their opportunity to grow from their original
rock and roll context.
"The Beatles and the Stones heard American black rock
and roll and gave it credibility. It took the British to teach
us about our own culture."
Putting rock music back into the present tense, Isralow
claims to be "into the demystification of rock stars," and
feels performers are just human beings doing their thing.
Refusing to classify his tastes narrowly, he admires John
Lennon, Chick Correa, Herbie Hancock, J. Geils, Elton
John and dozens of other artists, summing it all in a very
understated way: "/ love music."

sociological syncopation to the history of artists and
songs.
"The 50s were not very good times," says Isralow in
argument against the kind of nostalgia popularized by
American Grafitti and its many spinoffs.
Repression, Recession
"The 50s were sexually repressive, they were politically
repressive. You had a recession in the 50s, you had
Eisenhower, and of course you had Dick Nixon. There was
MeCarthyism. McCarthyism flourished in the 50s.
"I think people should remember the 50s for
McCarthy, not for the good times," Isralow almost
concludes, adding, "The only good thing about the 50s
was rock and roll."
Even rock and roll wasn't entirely good, and much of
what was good was stolen from black artists and released
in bleached-out versions called "cover records" by white
artists for white audiences.
"Of course, the ultimate example of this is Pat Boone,"

cites Isralow, noting Boone's version of Little Richard's
song, "Tutti Frutti."
Terrified Parents
In what Isralow contends was a racist society at the
peak of its tensions, Boone was acceptable to parents and
adolescents who were essentially terrified of blacks.
To give his classes a feel for what Boone was like in his
historical context, Isralow explains, "When 1 had a really
large class I went down to the Salvation Army and got
some white bucks and a cardigan sweater and I walked in
from the back of the class lip syncing "Love Letters In
The Sand."
In the same spirit, Isralow has impersonated Elvis
Presley for classes, demonstrating, "why they didn't show
the lower half of his body on The Ed Sullivan Show."
KSFX D.J.
Despite a master's degree in counseling psychology and
a stint as disc jockey at KSFX, Isralow is most satisfied
with his role as a teacher, personifying his belief that "a
good teacher is also an entertainer."
Isralow has given his course as well as individual
lectures on campuses across the country occasionally
attracting enrollments of 300 or more. Sometimes giving a
lecture becomes an education for the instructor.
Recently Isralow was addressing a group from the
National Organization For Women, and as part of a
discussion of sexism in rock he played the 50s classic
"Bobby's Girl." The members of NOW all sang along, "I
wanna be Bobby's girl." They also sang along to the
Rolling Stones," "Under My Thumb."
"As politicized as they are, they still get conditioned by
their music," explains Isralow.
Beatles' Basis
Complicated as Isralow claims the relationship between
music and culture is, even The Beatles phenomenon can be
explained more in cultural terms than on the basis of
musical merit.
"The people made The Beatles great; it's never the
music, it's always the people," states Isralow, further
explaining that the unique social circumstances of the
1960s coming out of the relative repression of the 50s gave
The Beatles their opportunity to grow from their original
rock and roll context.
"The Beatles and the Stones heard American black rock
and roll and gave it credibility. It took the British to teach
us about our own culture."
Putting rock music back into the present tense, Isralow
claims to be "into the demystification of rock stars," and
feels performers are just human beings doing their thing.
Refusing to classify his tastes narrowly, he admires John
Lennon, Chick Correa, Herbie Hancock, J. Geils, Elton
John and dozens of other artists, summing it all in a very
understated way: "/ love music."

historical context, Isralow explains, "When 1 had a really
large class I went down to the Salvation Army and got
some white bucks and a cardigan sweater and I walked in
from the back of the class lip syncing "Love Letters In
The Sand."
In the same spirit, Isralow has impersonated Elvis
Presley for classes, demonstrating, "why they didn't show
the lower half of his body on The Ed Sullivan Show."
KSFX D.J.
Despite a master's degree in counseling psychology and
a stint as disc jockey at KSFX, Isralow is most satisfied
with his role as a teacher, personifying his belief that "a
good teacher is also an entertainer."
Isralow has given his course as well as individual
lectures on campuses across the country occasionally
attracting enrollments of 300 or more. Sometimes giving a
lecture becomes an education for the instructor.
Recently Isralow was addressing a group from the
National Organization For Women, and as part of a
discussion of sexism in rock he played the 50s classic
"Bobby's Girl." The members of NOW all sang along, "I
wanna be Bobby's girl." They also sang along to the
Rolling Stones," "Under My Thumb."
"As politicized as they are, they still get conditioned by
their music," explains Isralow.
Beatles' Basis
Complicated as Isralow claims the relationship between
music and culture is, even The Beatles phenomenon can be
explained more in cultural terms than on the basis of
musical merit.
"The people made The Beatles great; it's never the
music, it's always the people," states Isralow, further
explaining that the unique social circumstances of the
1960s coming out of the relative repression of the 50s gave
The Beatles their opportunity to grow from their original
rock and roll context.
"The Beatles and the Stones heard American black rock
and roll and gave it credibility. It took the British to teach
us about our own culture."
Putting rock music back into the present tense, Isralow
claims to be "into the demystification of rock stars," and
feels performers are just human beings doing their thing.
Refusing to classify his tastes narrowly, he admires John
Lennon, Chick Correa, Herbie Hancock, J. Geils, Elton
John and dozens of other artists, summing it all in a very
understated way: "/ love music."

DOCTOR ROCK— I That's the name rock music fanatic Eric
Isralow hopes to adopt as host of a syndicated radio show
he wants to do. Meanwhile, isralow is at Stanford teaching
'Tlie History of Rock and Roll' Mondays and Wednesdays
at Harmony House.
"Yeah, I have 10,000 records. About 3500 albums,
4500 455, and 1000 singles or 78s, and they're heavy,"
explains rock music historian Eric Isralow, perhaps
assuming his audience is too young to know what a 78 is.
"Records to me are historical artifacts. They're my
tools. Like a plumber wouldn't throw away his tools, I
wouldn't give away my records.
"When I moved out here from the east I had about
3000 books. I gave most of my books away; I wouldn't
give away my records."
Rock History
Isralow is keeping his 10,000 records in his attic
apartment in Berkeley while traveling to Stanford on
Mondays and Wednesdays to teach "The History of Rock
and Roll" under the sponsorship of The Committee On
Black Performing Arts. <
"Music I think by far is the most influencial medium
today," says Isralow, citing the $2 billion in record sales
last year which topped the market for any form of
entertainment.
Isralow utilizes records, live musicians and

demonstrations to teach the relationship between
American culture and music from the late 1940s to the
present. Racism, sexism, drugs and politics form the
sociological syncopation to the history of artists and
songs.
"The 50s were not very good times," says Isralow in
argument against the kind of nostalgia popularized by
American Grafitti and its many spinoffs.
Repression, Recession
"The 50s were sexually repressive, they were politically
repressive. You had a recession in the 50s, you had
Eisenhower, and of course you had Dick Nixon. There was
MeCarthyism. McCarthyism flourished in the 50s.
"I think people should remember the 50s for
McCarthy, not for the good times," Isralow almost
concludes, adding, "The only good thing about the 50s
was rock and roll."
Even rock and roll wasn't entirely good, and much of
what was good was stolen from black artists and released
in bleached-out versions called "cover records" by white
artists for white audiences.
"Of course, the ultimate example of this is Pat Boone,"

cites Isralow, noting Boone's version of Little Richard's
song, "Tutti Frutti."
Terrified Parents
In what Isralow contends was a racist society at the
peak of its tensions, Boone was acceptable to parents and
adolescents who were essentially terrified of blacks.
To give his classes a feel for what Boone was like in his
historical context, Isralow explains, "When 1 had a really
large class I went down to the Salvation Army and got
some white bucks and a cardigan sweater and I walked in
