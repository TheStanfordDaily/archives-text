Is there some place on campus where students can go that is open for
all-night studying? —P.G.
Bug expected this question a little later in the quarter, but for all
you red-hots, here's the answer.
Room 144 on the ground level of Meyer Library should stay open
all night if the "helpful" security police don't lock it up around 2
a.m., Kathleen Fehrn, University libraries secretary, said.
Another place that is open all night is the computer center in
Jordan Quad. The surroundings aren't the most comfortable, but
you're there to study anyway. There are some tables and chairs by the
canteen and some outside.
Dormitory lounges are good for those who want to burrow
themselves in books late at night. If you can slip into one of these
before the security guards lock up the dorm, you've got yourself a
cozy place to study.
There is still one more place to study if you're the gambling type.
Classrooms in the Quad are officially locked up at 10 p.m. However,
frequently a few rooms are left open, so if you're patient and
desperate, you can search for a door that's ajar.
Also if you get to know the security police, sources have told Bug
the police will do special favors for their hard-working friends — like
letting them study in locked rooms.

Why doesn't the Housing Office allow freshmen to request a
certain roommate? —M. W.K.
Freshman year is the time to break away from the womb,
according to University officials who put roommates together. As
Stanford students are chosen for their diversity, so are roommates. In
other words, womb mates can't be roommates.
While the Housing Office puts together roommates with different
geographic and academic backgrounds, it does match students with
supportive interests like sports and hobbies, according to Bob
Hamrdla, assistant dean of Undergraduate Studies.
However, the Housing Office doesn't want diversity in roommates'
physical structure because one roommate might intimidate the other.
The Housing Office rarely makes an exception to the rule that
freshmen will not be made roommates upon request. Hamrdla
explained that frequently the roommates request is not mutual, and
one of the prospective roommates writes a letter specifically stating he
does not want to room with the other person.
At any rate, the number of requests is quite small — three percent
among entering freshmen this fall, Hamrdla said. Most of those
students are at least put in the same dormitory to ease the pain of
separation.

Dormitory lounges are good for those who want to burrow
themselves in books late at night. If you can slip into one of these
before the security guards lock up the dorm, you've got yourself a
cozy place to study.
There is still one more place to study if you're the gambling type.
Classrooms in the Quad are officially locked up at 10 p.m. However,
frequently a few rooms are left open, so if you're patient and
desperate, you can search for a door that's ajar.
Also if you get to know the security police, sources have told Bug
the police will do special favors for their hard-working friends — like
letting them study in locked rooms.

Why doesn't the Housing Office allow freshmen to request a
certain roommate? —M. W.K.
Freshman year is the time to break away from the womb,
according to University officials who put roommates together. As
Stanford students are chosen for their diversity, so are roommates. In
other words, womb mates can't be roommates.
While the Housing Office puts together roommates with different
geographic and academic backgrounds, it does match students with
supportive interests like sports and hobbies, according to Bob
Hamrdla, assistant dean of Undergraduate Studies.
However, the Housing Office doesn't want diversity in roommates'
physical structure because one roommate might intimidate the other.
The Housing Office rarely makes an exception to the rule that
freshmen will not be made roommates upon request. Hamrdla
explained that frequently the roommates request is not mutual, and
one of the prospective roommates writes a letter specifically stating he
does not want to room with the other person.
At any rate, the number of requests is quite small — three percent
among entering freshmen this fall, Hamrdla said. Most of those
students are at least put in the same dormitory to ease the pain of
separation.

Is there some place on campus where students can go that is open for
all-night studying? —P.G.
Bug expected this question a little later in the quarter, but for all
you red-hots, here's the answer.
Room 144 on the ground level of Meyer Library should stay open
all night if the "helpful" security police don't lock it up around 2
a.m., Kathleen Fehrn, University libraries secretary, said.
Another place that is open all night is the computer center in
Jordan Quad. The surroundings aren't the most comfortable, but
you're there to study anyway. There are some tables and chairs by the
canteen and some outside.
