So you think local TV news in
the Bay Area is bad? It suffers
from too much entertainment and
not enough hard, investigative
reporting, you say. Why do we
have to hear a five-minute weather
forecast every night? Why include
silly, meaningless stories that only
take up time? In short, why cram
ten minutes of news into a
half-hour program?
These are good questions.
Perhaps they are valid criticisms.
And when we look around the
country, we realize that they
don't just pertain to our neck of
the airwaves.
In Honolulu, it is not
uncommon for a newscaster to
pause to remove a dust particle
from his eye or for a weatherman
to playfully chase the anchorman
around the studio during a live
broadcast.
In Los Angeles, until very
recently, George Putnam
anchored a newsshow called Talk
Back, in which a half-hour
segment was devoted to Putnam
discussing news with the studio
audience, a kind of urbane Joe
Pyne Show.
Demands Too Much
Putnam, the nation's highest
paid newscaster at $350,000 a
year, was let go because he
demanded more. But the point of
all of this is that local news shows
are turning into entertainment
extravaganzas rather than sources
of information.
Recently, we traveled to
Spokane, Washington, to visit
Expo '74. We saw that, but we
also saw the end of the inevitable
path that many local news shows
are taking. The end was visible in
the form of the most incompetant
and saddest local news production
in a major city that we could have
ever imagined. We now discuss it
in expose '74:
Many of the local TV stations
in Spokane are located near high
schools, which is appropriate since
those places seem to be where
they recruit personnel. One
station even signs off the air with

a high school band marching on a
field in front of it, playing the
"Star Spangled Banner" and the
"Expo Song" ("Meet me by the
river at Expo '74"). But this
station isn't the biggest offender.
Poor Side
At the extreme end of the
unprofessional spectrum lies
KXLY, a CBS affiliate. Although
its anchormen, Ted Warren and
Mac McAllister, deliver the stories,
the station borrows a lot of film
from CBS. Occasionally, it video
tapes them directly off the
network and even leaves Walter
Cronkite on for a few seconds
before cutting back to Ted and
Mac.
Watching Ted and Mac stutter,
introduce the wrong film footage
and, at times, not even know what
to say made us want to visit the
studio during a telecast to see if it
really could be this bad.
We therefore knocked on a
back door until a man (looking
high on something) came to
answer it. One might imagine that
it would be near impossible for
strangers to be admitted to a local
television station at 10:30 on a
Friday night. But not here. The
man was so pleasantly surprised
we wanted to watch, he
immediately invited us inside.
We were asked
if we wanted to sit in the
directors' booth. How could we
refuse? This was when the fun
started.
Ted and Mac were in the
studio, checking over the script.
(Yes, they actually had one.) The
director sat down, spoke into the
headset of a cameraman (who
looked 16 and had to run back
and forth between two cameras)
and a few minutes later," The
Scene Tonight" (as it was called,

Ala "The Ted-Mac Amateur
Half-Hour") went on the air.
Throughout the show, the
director made comments like,
"Well, we had one good show this
week" and "Cut out the special
effects. No, not Mac, the special
effects." It was like watching the
show on television, only better,
because the director made the
same kinds of comments we had
made the night before.
While Mac did the weather,
commenting, "Today's low is
.. . the director stated,
"Today's low was when we
started." The director went on to
comment, "We're running over.
Well, at least we don't have a
network show following us
tonight."
Ted's big interview involved a
girl sitting in a golf cart. We
couldn't hear what he asked her
but we did hear one of her
responses. And to this day, we
can't think of what question
could possibly have made her

respond," No, but I stepped on a
worm once." This was the
featured story of the night.
No Credit Desired
Upon rolling the credits, the
director decided to pull his name
out, commenting, "I'm not
putting my name on (expletive
deleted) like this." After the show,
Ted and Mac emerged from the
studio, Mac angrily threw his
coffee cup down on the floor and
then they along with the director
walked into a room to watch a
video-tape replay of the show.
Before shutting the door, the
director burned, stating, "It's not
always like this." Another
technician quickly retorted, "It
usually is."
We'll repeat our original
question: So you think Bay Area
local news is bad? Well, from this
perspective, it could be a lot
worse. And we would recommend
not visiting any local studio
control rooms for fear of
discovering that indeed it is.
