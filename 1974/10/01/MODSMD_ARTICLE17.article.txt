"Recent Sculptures" by Carrie
Abramovitz are featured during
October in the upstairs exhibition
at Tresidder Memorial Union.
A Ph.D. in economics,
Abramovitz abandoned her career
of 13 years to become a
professional painter and sculptor
in 1953.
Her work includes pieces
utilizing alabaster, quartz,
sandstone, redwood, walnut,
bronze and lead, as well as some
pieces of ceramic sculpture.
Abramovitz says of her two
careers, "Indirectly but
significantly, I believe, the
education, discipline and work
needed to become a social
scientist helped me to develop as
an artist. My formal education for
economics was extensive; as an
artist I am essentially self-taught."
Abramovitz's works are
exhibited at the Harvard Medical
School and the Neuberger
Museum of the University of New
York, as well as the Center for
Research in the Behavioral
Sciences at Stanford.
Locally her works have been
shown at the De Young Museum,
the San Francisco Museum of Art
and the Oakland Art Museum.
