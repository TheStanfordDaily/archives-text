Ford To Testify On Pardon
WASHINGTON — President Ford told a House
subcommittee he will personally appear to testify
on why he gave former President Richard M. Nixon
a pardon.
The President told Chairman William L. Hungate
(D-Mo.) of the House Judiciary subcommittee in a
brief letter Monday that he would personally
respond to the 14 questions raised by two
resolutions before the subcommittee.
Ford said he would like to arrange the personal
testimony within the next 10 days, Hungate said.
Hungate said it would be the first personal
testimony by a sitting president before Congress
since that of Abraham Lincoln.
The questions Ford agreed to answer are on
details of whether White House Chief of Staff
Alexander M. Haig Jr. suggested the pardon for
Nixon, what agreements were made in connection
with the pardon and whether Ford's granting of it
was based on any knowledge of Nixon's mental or
physical health.
Outlook Hopeful For Betty Ford
WASHINGTON — Betty Ford's doctors reported
yesterday that they found some cancer cells in
lymph glands that were removed along with her
cancerous right breast.
The doctors said they "remain optimistic for a
prolonged survival."
Arriving for a hospital visit Monday night,
President Ford said he was optimistic about the
pathology report from the doctors.
"It's I think good, but there also are some
questions raised," the President told reporters in a
cautious and serious tone.
As for Mrs. Ford, he said: "With her strong, fine
attitude, I think everything will work out all right."
The medical report said "microscopic
involvement of cancer" was found in two of 30
lumph nodes removed Saturday from beneath the
right armpit.
Statistics show that such a finding usually
indicates decreased chances for a longterm cancer
cure.
Women found to have cancer cells in one or more
of their lymph nodes have a 50 percent chance of
surviving for five years, and a 25 percent chance for
10 year survival.
But hopeful new research results reported
yesterday by leading breast cancer researchers
brighten Mrs. Ford's chances of defeating the
disease.
A National Cancer Institute spokesmen
confirmed yesterday that three scientists

prominently involved in the institute's Breast
Cancer Task Force had met "with Navy medical
officials to discuss Mrs. Ford's case."
The spokesman declined to reveal the nature of
the discussions, but it was speculated they met with
Mrs. Ford's doctors to discuss applying the new
research findings to her case.
Nixon To Leave Hospital Soon
LONG BEACH, Calif. — Former President
Richard M. Nixon probably will leave the hospital
by this weekend, but it would not be advisable for
him to travel to Washington for the Watergate trial
for at least a month, his doctor said yesterday.
However, Dr. John C. Lungren said Nixon
probably could provide a written deposition in two
or three weeks.
"The exact duration of how long he will be in
restricted convalescent activity will depend on how
he responds to treatment he is getting at the present
time," Lungren said.
Asked if Nixon was strong enough to make the
trip to Washington, where the trial begins today,
Lungren said, "At this time I don't think he is."
The doctor said Nixon should be out of the
hospital by Saturday, but will have to wear a
support stocking on his left leg and avoid prolonged
periods of sitting, standing or riding in a car or
airplane.
He said it would be "at least a month, maybe
three months" before Nixon should travel. "In all
honesty I don't know," Lungren added.
Asked about when Nixon could give a written
deposition if one was required, Lungren said, "I
think a written deposition perhaps within a period
of two or three weeks, certainly."
Nixon has been subpoened in the cover-up trial
as a witness by both defendant John Ehrlichman
and special prosecutor Leon Jaworski. U.S. District
Judge John J. Sirica is considering a request from
Jaworski to send an independent medical team to
examine Nixon.
Reineeke Says He'll Resign
SACRAMENTO—Lt. Gov. Ed Reineeke said
yesterday he will resign when he is sentenced
tomorrow for perjury.
Reineeke had adamantly refused to resign in
spite of pressure from both Democratic and
Republican leaders ever since his conviction two
months ago.
But yesterday his office issued the following
statement:
"In view of the judge's decision last Friday to
deny my post-trial motions, I will resign as
lieutenant governor simultaneously with my

sentencing by the trial court, which is scheduled for
Wednesday in Washington, D.C."
Earlier in the day, Assemblyman Richard
Alatorre (D-Los Angeles) formally introduced a
resolution in the Assembly to impeach Reinecke.
Leftists Oust Portugese Leader
LISBON, Portugal — Young leftist military
leaders forced Gen. Antonio de Spinola to quit as
Portugal's president yesterday and a left-leaning
three-man committee began running the country.
The final blow to Spinola's hold on the
presidency that he assumed after a coup overthrew
Premier Marcello Caetano last April was the failure
by his rightist supporters to carry off a weekend
rally to express their support. Spinola cancelled the
rally after Communists and other leftists strongly
denounced it and threatened open violence to
prevent it.
But the end had been coming for some time for
the 64-year-old general, who the leftists felt was
proceeding too slowly and with too much caution in
instituting reforms, including the final termination
of Portugal's control over its African territories.
Watergate Jury Calls Mills Aides
WASHINGTON — A Watergate grand jury has
questioned three current and former aides to Rep.
Wilbur D. Mills (D-Ark.) about milk-fund money
used in the Congressman's brief 1972 presidential
campaign.
In recent weeks the Watergate prosecutors have
summoned Mills' administrative assistant, Oscar
Eugene Goss, and two former campaign officials.
Goss said he appeared voluntarily and was
questioned about links between the Mills campaign
and Associated Milk Producers Inc., the big dairy
cooperative that recently pleaded guilty to donating
$5,000 illegally to Mills.
Goss said the questions concerned the $5,000
cash gift, which allegedly passed through his hands,
and the use of corporate money by the co-op to pay
salaries and expenses of Mills campaign workers. Use
of corporate money in federal election campaigns is
prohibited by law.
Mills, reached by telephone at his suburban
Virginia home, said he has not been called to testify
by prosecutors. Earlier this year, Mills declined two
requests by the now-disbanded Senate Watergate
committee to appear for questioning.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow, except patchy night and
morning low clouds. Little temperature change.
Lows tonight in low to mid 50s. Highs today and
tomorrow in mid 60s to upper 70s. Light winds.
