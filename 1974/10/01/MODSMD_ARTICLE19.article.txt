# Grad Students' Coalition Announces Senate Slate
## 
### PETER BENNETT 
A group of 10 graduate students
calling themselves the Graduate
Student Coalition (GSC) held a press
conference yesterday in Tresidder
Union to announce their plans to
campaign for the ASSU Senate in the
Oct. 9 election.
Expressing concern that grad
students have been neglected by the
University, GSC members said they are
seeking more campus-wide recognition
of their needs and a larger role in
establishing administrative priorities.
The GSC candidates represent six
different schools and nine individual
departments. Members of the slate and
their area of study are: Sandra Dunn,
psychology; Janice Haney, English;
Henry Harmon, Food Research
Institute; David Harris,
communications; Bill Hoke, education;
Mike Lindsey, law; Deb Mukherjee,
aeronautics and astronautics; Bob
Nelson, English; Ken Perry, electrical
engineering; and Pieter Winsamius,
business.
The slate said it hopes to focus

attention on the issues of housing,
health care, a food co-op, child care,
the special needs of minority, foreign
and women students, single parents and
cooperation between the ASSU and
Escondido Village.
Housing represents a major
problem, they say. Less than 40
percent of grad students applying for
on-campus housing this year were
accomodated, while just under 80
percent of undergraduates who applied
for housing were successful.
GSC said it hopes to convince the
University that it should show the
same level of concern for graduate
housing needs that it has shown for
undergraduate housing.
Another area of concern is student
health care. Grad students rely
primarily on the Cowell Student
Health Center, but the services
provided are incomplete in a number
of ways. Students not officially
enrolled during summer quarter may
not use the health center. Grad
students, many of whom must stay at
Stanford whether enrolled or not, find
themselves without medical care
during the summer months.
