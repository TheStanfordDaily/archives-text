# Gould Files Discrimination Suit
## Prof Fights Truckers' Pact 
### DON COX 
Law Prof. William Gould filed suit
in Washington yesterday to set aside
an "entirely inadequate" agreement
between the U.S. Justice Department
and major trucking firms concerning
racial discrimination in the trucking
industry.
The government has given the
trucking industry "a license to break
the law" against racial discrimination
in employment, Gould charged in
arguing against the partial consent
agreement.
Under the agreement's provisions,
government and industry officials may
offer $500 or more to minority
employees in trucking to waive past
and future rights to sue against racially
discriminatory policies.
"It is an attempt by the trucking
firms to buy immunity from further
prosecution in future civil rights
litigation," Gould told the Daily last
night. He said it was unreasonable to
ask minority truckers to sign for a
$500 settlement when some of them
may be losing as much as $10,000 per
year due to discriminatory
employment policies.
Inadequate Agreement
Gould said the Justice Department
probably settled for such an
inadequate agreement because of the
Nixon administration's friendship with
the Teamsters union and because of
the frustration with meeting its
obligations of achieving racial equality
throughout the nation.
"They want to be finished with the
whole problem. We do too, but they
want the easy way out," he said.
Gould brought suit against trucking
firms and the Teamsters last year on
behalf of minority truck drivers. Many
union members are covered in the
protested partial consent agreement.
Gould is asking for $50 million in
punitive damages and backpay.
Similar Suit
Gould won a similar suit against the
Detroit Edison Co. last year which
resulted in a record-setting $4 million
judgement against the company and
$250,000 against Utility Workers of
America local 223. The case is still on
appeal.
In addition to the inadequate
monetary damages awarded in the
partial consent agreement, Gould said
there is no regulation of the time,
place or manner in which waivers are
sought, and no guarantees or seniority

rights for those who sign.
While the consent agreement gives
employers and government officials
free access to minorities affected by its
provisions, many employees may be
unaware of the existence of legal
counsel under a San Francisco district
court order restricting communication
in the case, he said.
"They have no opportunity to get
competent counsel. They are just
going to be called into the office and
asked to sign," Gould said.
Law Profs. Anthony Amsterdam
and Thelton Henderson have joined
Gould on the trucking case which has
also received backing from the
American Civil Liberties Union.

ask minority truckers to sign for a
$500 settlement when some of them
may be losing as much as $10,000 per
year due to discriminatory
employment policies.
Inadequate Agreement
Gould said the Justice Department
probably settled for such an
inadequate agreement because of the
Nixon administration's friendship with
the Teamsters union and because of
the frustration with meeting its
obligations of achieving racial equality
throughout the nation.
"They want to be finished with the
whole problem. We do too, but they
want the easy way out," he said.
Gould brought suit against trucking
firms and the Teamsters last year on
behalf of minority truck drivers. Many
union members are covered in the
protested partial consent agreement.
Gould is asking for $50 million in
punitive damages and backpay.
Similar Suit
Gould won a similar suit against the
Detroit Edison Co. last year which
resulted in a record-setting $4 million
judgement against the company and
$250,000 against Utility Workers of
America local 223. The case is still on
appeal.
In addition to the inadequate
monetary damages awarded in the
partial consent agreement, Gould said
there is no regulation of the time,
place or manner in which waivers are
sought, and no guarantees or seniority

rights for those who sign.
While the consent agreement gives
employers and government officials
free access to minorities affected by its
provisions, many employees may be
unaware of the existence of legal
counsel under a San Francisco district
court order restricting communication
in the case, he said.
"They have no opportunity to get
competent counsel. They are just
going to be called into the office and
asked to sign," Gould said.
Law Profs. Anthony Amsterdam
and Thelton Henderson have joined
Gould on the trucking case which has
also received backing from the
American Civil Liberties Union.


William Gould
Law Prof. William Gould filed suit
in Washington yesterday to set aside
an "entirely inadequate" agreement
between the U.S. Justice Department
and major trucking firms concerning
racial discrimination in the trucking
industry.
The government has given the
trucking industry "a license to break
the law" against racial discrimination
in employment, Gould charged in
arguing against the partial consent
agreement.
Under the agreement's provisions,
government and industry officials may
offer $500 or more to minority
employees in trucking to waive past
and future rights to sue against racially
discriminatory policies.
"It is an attempt by the trucking
firms to buy immunity from further
prosecution in future civil rights
litigation," Gould told the Daily last
night. He said it was unreasonable to
ask minority truckers to sign for a
$500 settlement when some of them
may be losing as much as $10,000 per
year due to discriminatory
employment policies.
