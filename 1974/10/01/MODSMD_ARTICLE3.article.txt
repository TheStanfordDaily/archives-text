# Goheen Considers Self Mediator, Not Advocate
## 
### CRIS WILHELM 
For those who have despaired
about the lack of justice for the
ordinary Stanford citizen, or reeled
before the onslaughts of bureaucratic
tangles and unnecessary delays, there
is still hope.
The place to go is building 80,
room 85.
That's the office of Emeritus Prof.
John D. Goheen, University
ombudsman.
Now in his first year as
ombudsman, Goheen says he decided
to take the position because of his
interest in people and because "it is
something important for the
University to do. I have had long
experience with the University and
thought that I could do a reasonable
job."
While the ombudsman's office is
funded by the University, the office
"is independent of the University. It
functions as a mediator and,
hopefully, a resolver of disputes,"
Goheen said.
Goheen agreed that it is a common
misconception that an ombudsman is
an advocate for the community he
serves. Rather, he looks at the facts
objectively and makes an independent
determination as to whether the
complaint is justified. If it is justified,
only then does the ombudsman
become an advocate for the
complainant.

"The real difficulty, of course, is
making the decision to be an advocate
and having sufficient grounds on
which to base a decision," Goheen
said.
He added that his dealings with the
University have not been frustrating.
"People respond very favorable to
inquiries even when those inquiries
might appear to be threatening."
The majority of complaints come
from students, with some coming from
staff, and only a few from the faculty.
He said, "There really is no typical
complaint. We deal with all kinds of
things, from the trivial to the tragic."
One recent case concerned a
graduate student whose application for
admission was incomplete because his
transcript had been temporarily lost,
and as a result, his application wasn't
considered until the selection process
was almost over. Since it was too late
to help the individual, Goheen said he
proded the graduate school about it's
procedures in general.
The first ombudsman, Dr. Herant
Katchadourian, was appointed in
1969, after the Committee of 15
proposed the idea. Lois Amsterdam,
an attorney, and former Registrar
Harvey Hall followed Katchadourian
as ombudsman.
Now emeritus professor of
philosophy, Goheen came to Stanford
in 1950.

ombudsman.
Now in his first year as
ombudsman, Goheen says he decided
to take the position because of his
interest in people and because "it is
something important for the
University to do. I have had long
experience with the University and
thought that I could do a reasonable
job."
While the ombudsman's office is
funded by the University, the office
"is independent of the University. It
functions as a mediator and,
hopefully, a resolver of disputes,"
Goheen said.
Goheen agreed that it is a common
misconception that an ombudsman is
an advocate for the community he
serves. Rather, he looks at the facts
objectively and makes an independent
determination as to whether the
complaint is justified. If it is justified,
only then does the ombudsman
become an advocate for the
complainant.

"The real difficulty, of course, is
making the decision to be an advocate
and having sufficient grounds on
which to base a decision," Goheen
said.
He added that his dealings with the
University have not been frustrating.
"People respond very favorable to
inquiries even when those inquiries
might appear to be threatening."
The majority of complaints come
from students, with some coming from
staff, and only a few from the faculty.
He said, "There really is no typical
complaint. We deal with all kinds of
things, from the trivial to the tragic."
One recent case concerned a
graduate student whose application for
admission was incomplete because his
transcript had been temporarily lost,
and as a result, his application wasn't
considered until the selection process
was almost over. Since it was too late
to help the individual, Goheen said he
proded the graduate school about it's
procedures in general.
The first ombudsman, Dr. Herant
Katchadourian, was appointed in
1969, after the Committee of 15
proposed the idea. Lois Amsterdam,
an attorney, and former Registrar
Harvey Hall followed Katchadourian
as ombudsman.
Now emeritus professor of
philosophy, Goheen came to Stanford
in 1950.
For those who have despaired
about the lack of justice for the
ordinary Stanford citizen, or reeled
before the onslaughts of bureaucratic
tangles and unnecessary delays, there
is still hope.
The place to go is building 80,
room 85.
That's the office of Emeritus Prof.
John D. Goheen, University
ombudsman.
