# Lyman Warns On Housing
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
President Richard W. Lyman
yesterday cautioned against
over-emphasis on undergraduate
housing as the single highest priority
for University funding.
Recognizing the urgent need for
such housing in light of spiraling
off-campus rent and increased
desirability of University residences,
Lyman still warned of the importance
of other priorities in his first news
conference of the quarter.
"It just isn't that easy to say
dormitories are the thing and the
[proposed| library, for example, can
just wait, because I think a strong
argument can be made that a
university without an adequate library
is no university at all, whereas most
universities in the world exist without
any dormitories," Lyman said in a

pre-recording of KXSU's Campus
Conference.
Lyman noted that although a
housing office proposal for three new
Row houses for 150 undergraduates
will be submitted to the Board of
Trustees, he would regard additional
construction of a cluster or pattern of
10 to 14 houses of 50 to 70 students
each as "a very difficult target."
"Clearly, the University cannot
afford that or we'd be going ahead and
doing it," Lyman said.
'Privacy Of Apartments'
He noted that five years ago, the
University did not build more
undergraduate housing not only for
financial reasons, but "because student
leaders were quick to tell us that the
future lay in apartments and that
students ... preferred the privacy of
apartments."
Now, "student tastes have changed
180 degrees," and the lag between
planning and actual construction of
projects to accommodate new student
needs has become very visible, he said.
Lyman indicated he had suggested
further survey research on
undergraduate housing tastes to the
Dean of Student's office.
He refused to suggest a perference
for a course of action regarding an
adjustment of the University housing
system to comply with the rules of
Title IX, an adjunct to the U.S.
Education Amendments of 1972
which forbids sex discrimination in
any activities or education programs at
universities that receive federal
assistance.
Violation Of Law
Privileges which currently exempt
all-male fraternities from the housing
draw are considered in violation of the
law because no such exemptions exist
for women.
"I don't want to prejudice [the
decision] by saying I lean in one
direction and not the other," Lyman
explained.
However, he said he disliked the
idea that "the risks of the draw would
be confined to a relatively small
number of students" if the housing
office chooses to exempt members of

theme houses as well as fraternities
from the spring draw.
Buckley Law
Lyman also criticized a federal law
authored by Sen. James Buckley
(Cons.-N.Y.) allowing any student to
see letters of recommendation in his
own file, and lauded a new state
tuition grant bill.
He called the Buckley law "a
disastrous, or at least, an untoward
development to have happen. I'm not
sure the Senator (Buckley) even
intended it to have the sweeping effect
it will have."
"Writers of letters of
recommendation, knowing they will
be open, will be inhibited in what they
say," Lyman stressed.
"It's much better to get responsible
people making responsible statements
to other responsible people who judge
applicants than to have everybody
writing publicity releases on their
favorite high school student," he
added.
'Clandestine Calls'
Now, "if you really want to find
out something more than simply the
SAT scores and the letter grades on

an important concern, there are other items which take a higher priority. Lyman

the high school transcript, what do
you do? Resort to clandestine phone
calls?"
Lyman concluded that the
possibility of unfairness to the student
increases if admissions officers must
rely on such phone calls —
communications which don't leave a
written record, and thus may not be
able to be justified later.
He called the recent state tuition
grant bill signed by Gov. Ronald
Reagan on Friday a "step toward
solving a very severe problem for the
sector of private education in general,
namely that the difference in cost
between going to a public sector
institution and a private sector
institution keeps increasing year by
year" as the degree of subsidy to
students in the public sector continues
to increase.
Campus Conference will be
broadcast tonight at 7:30 p.m. on
KZSU.
