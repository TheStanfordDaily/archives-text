# Union Chief Berk Faces Vote Test
## 
### DON COX 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union members will choose incumbent
Jim Berk or steamfitter leader Keith
Stothers tonight to be next year's
president.
The annual election of the union
president and other officers will take
place at the October membership
meeting tonight. Up for election are
five general officers and 15 group
representatives. These officers and the
past president from the union's
executive committee conducts union
business between membership
meetings.
Ballots handed out to members two
weeks ago will be counted at the
meeting in the Tresidder large lounge
at 5 p.m.
Both candidates reported
campaigning to be fairly low key as the
election drew near. Berk is heading a
slate including Hansen Labs machinist
Bill Reynolds, running for asst.
president and senior health physicist
Roland Finston running for reporter.
SLAC lab machanic Keith Doty is
running against Reynolds, and genetics

technician Tim Knaak is running
against Finston for the reporter spot.
'Dictatorship'?
Stothers' main campaign platform
plank is greater and more complete
representation of the workers and
their interests in high union
decision-making circles. Stothers
objects to the "dictatorship" of Jim
Berk and wants to provide more
responsive leadership to the union
members.
"One of the biggest things I've been
fighting against in this whole campaign
is that Berk is just not representing the
people," Stothers said yesterday.
Berk has "been spending a lot of
time and money" on organizing the
hospital workers without the consent
of the union members," he said.
"He's been a dictator from the
word 'go'," he added.
Teamsters Backer
In 1972, Stothers pushed for the
election of the Teamsters Union to
represent the 1400 technical,
maintenance and service employees in
the then newly defined bargaining
unit. The unit subsequently chose USE
to represent them in contract talks
which resulted in the contract
agreement signed in June.
Berk and his "unity slate" propose
to work on the establishment of group
legal, dental and medical plans. He said
that a president must be a "leader not
a follower."
"Unity is the single most important
thing you need," he said. Berk
maintained that his slate can provide
this unity in leadership and program
planning to "do the things we couldn't
do in the past." Berk charged that
some of his slates' opponents would
put politics before union interests.
Inconsistent
"Stothers won't make a good
president if he is elected because he
doesn't know the people and he
doesn't know the problems," Berk
said. Stothers hasn't been consistent in
his involvement in union affairs, Berk
also charged.
Stothers said he has been active in
union affairs from his role as an early
organizer of USE to his activity during
USE's three week strike last spring. He
cannot devote as much time to union
affairs as Berk, "because I also have to
hold down a job," he said. Berk, a
former SLAC engineer, is a full-time
union employee.
Neither presidential candidate
would speculate on the results of the
election, though Stothers said he
considered himself the "underdog."

union members will choose incumbent
Jim Berk or steamfitter leader Keith
Stothers tonight to be next year's
president.
The annual election of the union
president and other officers will take
place at the October membership
meeting tonight. Up for election are
five general officers and 15 group
representatives. These officers and the
past president from the union's
executive committee conducts union
business between membership
meetings.
Ballots handed out to members two
weeks ago will be counted at the
meeting in the Tresidder large lounge
at 5 p.m.
Both candidates reported
campaigning to be fairly low key as the
election drew near. Berk is heading a
slate including Hansen Labs machinist
Bill Reynolds, running for asst.
president and senior health physicist
Roland Finston running for reporter.
SLAC lab machanic Keith Doty is
running against Reynolds, and genetics

technician Tim Knaak is running
against Finston for the reporter spot.
'Dictatorship'?
Stothers' main campaign platform
plank is greater and more complete
representation of the workers and
their interests in high union
decision-making circles. Stothers
objects to the "dictatorship" of Jim
Berk and wants to provide more
responsive leadership to the union
members.
"One of the biggest things I've been
fighting against in this whole campaign
is that Berk is just not representing the
people," Stothers said yesterday.
Berk has "been spending a lot of
time and money" on organizing the
hospital workers without the consent
of the union members," he said.
"He's been a dictator from the
word 'go'," he added.
Teamsters Backer
In 1972, Stothers pushed for the
election of the Teamsters Union to
represent the 1400 technical,
maintenance and service employees in
the then newly defined bargaining
unit. The unit subsequently chose USE
to represent them in contract talks
which resulted in the contract
agreement signed in June.
Berk and his "unity slate" propose
to work on the establishment of group
legal, dental and medical plans. He said
that a president must be a "leader not
a follower."
"Unity is the single most important
thing you need," he said. Berk
maintained that his slate can provide
this unity in leadership and program
planning to "do the things we couldn't
do in the past." Berk charged that
some of his slates' opponents would
put politics before union interests.
Inconsistent
"Stothers won't make a good
president if he is elected because he
doesn't know the people and he
doesn't know the problems," Berk
said. Stothers hasn't been consistent in
his involvement in union affairs, Berk
also charged.
Stothers said he has been active in
union affairs from his role as an early
organizer of USE to his activity during
USE's three week strike last spring. He
cannot devote as much time to union
affairs as Berk, "because I also have to
hold down a job," he said. Berk, a
former SLAC engineer, is a full-time
union employee.
Neither presidential candidate
would speculate on the results of the
election, though Stothers said he
considered himself the "underdog."
