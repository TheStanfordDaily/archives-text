# Massage Parlor Rule Referred To Committee
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
A proposed ordinance to license
Palo Alto massage parlors was referred
by the City Council last night to the
Policy and Planning Procedures
Committee.
The rule would require all Palo Alto
massage establishments to obtain an
operating license from the chief of
police.
Noting that the proposed ordinance
poses many unanswered questions,
several Council members said they
preferred to discuss the matter in
committee before bringing it to a vote.
Committee Chairwoman Enid

Pearson emphasized that the public
will be welcome to address the
hearings, but said she is not certain
when the committee will explore the
issue.
Information regarding the exact
nature of treatments to be
administered in the parlors and the
possible history of criminal
convictions would be required before
issuance of the license.
The ordinance would force the
applicant to provide a certificate from
a medical doctor stating that he was
free from any contagious or
communicable disease. The rule would
also require every applicant to present
proof of having completed at least 50
hours of instruction in massage
technique.
Noting that the number of massage
parlors in the city has increased from
six to 26 during the last year, Chief of
Police James Zurcher and Asst. City
Manager Charles Walker wrote the
ordinance, citing the need for
maintaining high sanitary standards.
In other action last night, the
Council voted unanimously to approve
in principle a proposal that the Palo
Alto Housing Corporation form a
non-profit organization whose aim
would be to assist in the provision and
preservation of low-moderate income
Palo Alto housing.
The Council directed the Housing
Corporation to work with the city
staff to develop a program outlining
the scope, objectives and structure of
the plan.
A financial program of $10 million
for five years was recommended. The
Housing Corporation was ordered to
set forth at least three alternative
forms of financing, including General
Obligation Bonds and Revenue Bonds.
Later in the evening, the Council
endorsed California's Election
Proposition 15, which would repeal
Article 34 of the state constitution,
which requires that proposed
lower-income public housing must be
submitted to the electorate.
