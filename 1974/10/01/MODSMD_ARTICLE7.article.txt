Campus Menace
Editor:
"You don't hate blacks, do
you?"
You've been there. The dapper
black man strolls up, smiling, his
hand outstretched. The phony
aggressive friendliness, immaculate
dress and fast talk are all part of
the hustle. He's collecting money,
ostensibly for such and such a
cause, which I am convinced is
completely bogus.
This type of activity is
sometimes known as extortion.
Whatever you call it, it has
become a major source of
harassment for many students.
As far as I can tell the most
that has been done to discourage
this menace is to ignore it, which I
suppose is typical of the
easy-going lifestyle around here. I,
for one, have been tempted to let
my Doberman perform a
tracheotomy on one of the
scoundrels. That probably
wouldn't go over very well in this
bastion of white middle class
"liberal" tolerance, though.
Its nice to get back to
California after being away for a
while: everythings relaxed, no
hassles, you can smoke shit in
public, cross the street without
risking your life; I didn't hesitate
for a moment to leave my .357
magnum at home — I figured I
couldn't possibly need it here. Did
I make an unwise decision?
In addition to being a nuisance,
the way in which these guys
present their act is degrading and
insulting. I have more respect for
a guy out on the street begging
quarters to buy himself some
taste.
If indeed these con-artists are
representing a legitimate
organization (I haven't let one of
them get far enough into his hype
to find out — I did two years ago,
but I'm older and wiser now),
then I suggest that they set up a
table in White Plaza, as others
have done, and distribute their
literature and solicit donations
from there. That way, if I want to
find out about their hustle, I'll ask
them about it. Until then, I don't
want to hear about it.

On The 'Rescue Squad'
Editor:
In the Sept. 26 edition of the
Daily there was an informative
article about the Paramedic Unit
proposal and efforts to improve
emergency care delivered on
campus.
I would just like to add a little
information that may be helpful
to the Stanford community. As
many people are hopefully aware,
we have had for some time on
campus a medical emergency unit,
the so-called "Rescue Squad."
This is made up of firemen
trained in emergecny first aid
care, an emergency vehicle
outfitted with resuscitation
equipment and a communication
system which links the Fire
Department, Police Department,
ambulance service, and hospital.
This system has worked well
and is readily available anywhere
on campus. The proposal which is
under consideration is for a
possible expansion of the present
service, involving additional
training and equipment; it is not
that we are without emergency
service at the present time.

Old Myths Reinforced
Editor:
Deja vu. Regarding the 1966
Oliphant cartoon showing Ho Chi
Minh holding the emaciated body

of a Vietnamese, supposedly
sacrificed to Ho's obstinacy:
It's unfortunate that the
cartoon was published without a
historical footnote. Even
antiquated political cartoons are
very powerful, and this one
strongly reinforces old myths.
It suggests that the U.S. was
defending civil liberties and
self-determination in South
Vietnam, that North Vietnam was
the aggressor, and that
negotiations were stalled by
Hanoi's stubborness.
Though many people in 1974
now realize that the U.S. has been
intervening in Vietnam to support
a repressive American client state,
many Americans still swallow the
line expounded in the cartoon;
they believe the official U.S.
position that ceasefire violations
and landgrabbing by the
"Vietcong" are the causes of the
continuing war in Vietnam.
In fact, in 1966 the U.S.
continually refused to negotiate
with the National Liberation
Front; began sending B-52's on
mass raids against the North; and
bombed Hanoi, Haiphong, and the
DMZ for the first time.
Meanwhile, Thieu and Ky
maintained military rule in the
South, suppressed Catholics and
Buddhists demanding civilian rule,
and excluded neutralists from
national elections.
Now, in 1974, the U.S. violates
the Peace Agreement by opposing
national elections involving the
Provisional Revolutionary
Government, sending massive
amounts of military aid for the
Thieu regime to use in attacking
territory legally held by the PRC,
and helping Thieu maintain a vast
police and prisons system to
suppress political dissenters.
Giving Oliphant a Pulitzer Prize
for this cartoon shows the same
logic that won Henry Kissinger a
Nobel Prize for bringing peace to
Vietnam.

Response
My reflections on the Mars Hotel
album represent conclusions based
on weeks of listening to the
Dead's latest release,not on a once
or even thrice around the
turntable as implied in the letters
of Grushkin and Ruetz (see Daily,
Sept. 30).
In addition, I have heard the
Dead numerous times in concert
(the last being in Santa Barbara
this spring). I also own and
frequently listen to several Dead
albums and am a great Dead fan
(i.e. "Deadhead").
Several other Daily critics (who
also happen to be Dead fans) and
I agree that Mars Hotel contains
moments which represent the
Dead's finest work to date.
However, we agree that most of
the album lacks inspiration and
cohesiveness.
This opinion is a considered,
honest appraisal of the
performance, setting aside
prejudices in the group's favor.
The rumors of the Dead's
demise come not only from
Rolling Stone, but have been well
discussed among many of the
group's closest observers. Their
break-up is not definite; their
uncertainty is.
Surely Grushkin can't assume
that the words of the Dead front
office always ring exactly true. All
groups have public relations flaks
whose sole responsibility is to
squelch unfavorable publicity
regardless of its validity.
The Mars Hotel album pains
me because as a Dead fan, I
expect the group's work to live up
to the Dead's truly unique talents.
I am disappointed and objective
enough to admit it.
