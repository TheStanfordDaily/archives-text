# Jim Berk Easily Beats Keith Stothers In Battle For USE Presidential Post
## 
### DON COX 
Incumbent United Stanford
Employees (USE) union president Jim
Berk was overwhelmingly re-elected
last night at the union's monthly
-membership meeting.
Berk said the 395 to 228 victory
aver sieamfitter Keith Stothers was a
vote of confidence from the people"
in what Berk considered a referendum
on past and future policy.
Up for election were five general
officers and 15 group representatives.
l"hese officers and the past president
former USE president Glenda Jonesi

form the union's executive committee
which conducts union business
between membership meetings.
Berk neaded a "unity slate" of
candidates, alt of whom easily
defeated their opponents for the
contended union offices. The slate's
campaign platform stressed unit> in
union leadership and future programs.
'All The Way'
Stothers said he had expected a
bigger turnout, but that he "would
back Berk ail the way. i may fight
with him on some issues, but he's
president and iti important to hang

together.
The election was viewed widely as a
referendum on Berk's leadership of the
union during its first contract
negotiations during the past year. The
union's first contract covering the
1400 technical, maintenance and
service employees USE represents was
signed in June, but only after a
three-week strike.
The presidential election was
"dominated by a personality contest."
Berk said. He said future elections
would be more concerned with the
"clear delineation of proposed
programs."
The Stothervßerk rivalry grew
during 1972 when Stothers pushed for
the election of the Teamsters union to
represent the then-newly defined
bargaining unit of Stanford workers.
Berk campaigned to have the unit
represented by USE, a leftist splinter
group of an older on-campus labor
organization. After two elections, USE
finally won.
01 Sentiment
During the prolonged contract
negotiations and the three-week strike
last June, some sentiment against Berk
and his politics surfaced. Many felt the
strike was unnecessary . However, Berk
claims that the 63 percent vote yesterday
was a elear approval by the workers of
past and future leadership and
programs. He said his persona! politics
were no longer at issue.
Stothers said he lost ,4 badlv,"
"would try again next year." He
campaigned for greater and more
complete representation of the
workers and their interests in high
union decision making circles. He
objected to Berk's "dictatorship" and
Berk's initiation of programs or
expenditures without the members
consent.
Stothers said he supports Berk's
efforts to organize the hospital
workers. But he added that Berk
should not have spent union funds on
this type of activity without members'
consent,
Organizing activities were the
primary responsibility of USE's

mother labor organization, the Service
Employees Intemauonai Union
(SEIU).
Berk and his slate intend to work
on the establishment of group legal,
dental. and medical plans. He
suggested that these plans, once
operational under union sponsorship,
might be included among University 7
financed benefits in future contracts.
