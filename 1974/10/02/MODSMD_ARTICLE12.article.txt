# Congressmen, Too, Distort News

The events leading to the resignation of
former presidential press secretary Jerald
terHorst once again point out the uneasy
relationship existing between government
and the press.
Manipulation of news by government
through its press secretaries not only
misinforms the public, but also causes the
press to present governmental news in a
cynical manner. »
This is not a new problem. Long before
Ronald Ziegler euphemistically called all his
previous Watergate statements "inoperative,"
the press complained about managed news.
As early as the 19505, James Hagerty,
Eisenhower's powerful press secretary, was
often criticized for allegedly withholding
important facts from the press
People who naively praise the Kennedy
Administration's relations with the press
forget the acerbity resulting from the
attempted cover-up of the Bay of Pigs
incident and the manipulation of news during
the Cuban crisis.
'Credibility Gap'
During the Johnson Administration,
someone coined the term "credibility gap" to
describe managed news during the Vietnam
War, but the problem was the same as ever.
The problem of lying by governmental
press organs is a topic that has been much
discussed. But managed news is an issue that
extends far beyond bald lies at the White
House. Several less well known dimensions to
the problem also exist.
One issue that has been given little

attention is the manipulation of news
through routine press releases. Every week,
thousands of press releases are issued by
congressional offices in Washington and are
sent to constituency newspapers. Since only
a small proportion of the nation's daily
newspapers employ their own regular
Washington correspondents, millions of
Americans rely solely on news releases for
information regarding their local
representatives. Most papers print the releases
verbatim, so the congressmen in effect
receive free publicity while having their own
versions of their actions fed to their
constituents without challenge.
Releases Often Distorted
Of course, the news included in the
releases is often distorted. For example,
thousands of pieces of duplicate legislation
are introduced in Congress each year and
congressmen are able to write their releases in
such a way that they are credited with
conceiving legislation that has been
introduced many times in identical or similar
form.
Not all of the publicity devices of
congressmen and senators are designed to
mislead voters and or attract votes. For
example, the placement of recording studios
on Capitol Hill seems an honest attempt to
better inform the public by providing more
convenient and efficient facilities for
distributing publicity. Press releases
themselves are often written to inform
constituents rather than to mislead.
Furthermore, congressmen cannot be much

blamed if they attempt to use the devices at
their disposal to attract support. Most of the
fault must rest with the public and the press.
A case in point is the coverage given to
governmental agencies. Since many such
agencies are involved in work that reporters
find rather abstruse, agencies are often not
property covered. Writing in a 1972
Columbia Journalism Review article, an
observer of the subject declared
that "without public relations men, most
stories would never be written." If the public
is to be properly informed the work of these
agencies — whose activities are often more
important than those of Congress —
newspapers must train reporters to cover
them intelligently, since most people ignore
the few scholarly journals that probe issues in
depth.
Another example is the work of
congressional committees. Most reporters
devote far more attention to the final votes
on important bills than to the work of the
committees, where most of the substantial
legislative work is done.
While the press tends to cover the White
House astutely and balk at manipulated news,
most publications are far more vulnerable to
manipulated news at over levels of
government. Before newspapers and
newspaper readers complain too much about
managed news, they ought to realize that
often they allow the lower levels of
government to manipulate the news.
