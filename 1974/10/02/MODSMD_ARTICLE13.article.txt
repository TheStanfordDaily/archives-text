# The 						Cost Of 'Annexing' The Frats
##

Justice is the primary avowed motivation
for the current proposal to annex fraternities
into the University housing draw. As with
most attempts to equalize by levelling, we
must be sure that no further injustices are
caused in the process. We must examine this
limited issue.
Fraternity members — alumni and current
actives alike — have historically invested a
great deal of time, effort and money into
their facilities, not merely for personal
benefit, but also to guarantee fraternity
continuity in the future. Current members,
among other things, pay initiation fees,
personally maintain and improve the house.
Alumni, on their part, donate money directly
or via the University to the fraternity.
Through the years this investment — financial
or otherwise — has become substantial.
All this, of course, was and is invested on
the assumption that the fraternity will
remain an independent organization, and
hence exempt from the draw system.
(Independence, and consequently
draw-exemption, are integral parts of the
concept of a fraternity.) The Unviersity has
implicitly ratified this assumption by
sanctioning fraternities, and cooperating with
fraternities in the construction of new
buildings.
On the whole, too, fraternities have

successfully operated autonomously,
assuming financial responsibility for their
short and long-range viability, despite recent
hard times. Needless to say, this autonomy
has saved the University many administrative
problems and headaches by transferring them
to the fraternities (with — ahem! — certain
exceptions).
In all fairness we would agree that
responsible autonomy earns independence,
and further, that historical autonomy
warrants future independence. The
University, again, implicitly acceded to this
principle.
On these two bases alone, it would seem
just to say that fraternities have a historically
earned moral justification to their autonomy,
independence and consequent exemption
from the draw. University assent to this claim
makes it an informal moral obligation by the
University. (The question clearly is more a
problem of fairness than legality.)
The Administration, to be sure, can
change its mind, but such a shift and
takeover of fraternities would be unjust,
violating the fraternities'justified claims, and
previous tacit agreements.
Draw-exemption, to be sure, is hardly a
basic right; thus it can be over-ridden, but
only if the fraternities' claims to it are
surrendered, or extinguished through just

compensation. Such compensation would
involve mutually satisfactory resolution with
respect to the fraternity institution and
current members.
With respect to the institution, the
Administration might recompense the
fraternity for its historical investment in their
facilities (whether the Administration
formally holds title to the buildings or not,
fraternity alumni have made substantial
contributions to them). With respect to
current members who have personally
invested time and effort to the fraternity, a
year's exemption from the draw during the
possible annexation transition can most fairly
be granted.
The essential point is that Administration
take-over of fraternities requires
compensation to the fraternities for the loss
of earned independence. An important
question to raise is the cost of the just
compensations, were all fraternities to be
annexed.
There are 12 draw-exempt fraternities
presently. Compensation would not be
insignificant. Perhaps the University can
better use the money for the construction of
a new residence? The wisdom of alternatives
to annexation might more constructively be
explored!
