# Brown Campaign 'Closed'

Rich Jaroslovsky, in his
analysis of Hugh Flournoy's race
for the governorship (Daily, Sept.
27), made one serious mistake. He
quoted Flournoy as saying, "I
don't know what the issues of the
campaign are going to be." This
Was taken entirely out of context.
Had Jaroslovsky stopped to
take note of an earlier Flournoy
article (Daily, Sept. 23), he would
have read that Flournoy
continued, in the same quote, that
"it's hard to make an issue" when
Jerry Brown reverses his position
so frequently.
Flournoy knows his issues. He
is campaigning for open
government, fiscal responsibility,
quality education and an end to
job discrimination. Maybe
Brown is also campaigning on
certain issues, but no one seems to
know for sure, because Brown
never openly says much about his

issues, except in carefully
controlled circumstances. KNX
radio in Los Angeles has labeled
Brown as "the phantom
candidate."
Twice, there have been offers
from the broadcast media to carry
the Flournoy-Brown debates live
on state-wide radio and television,
free of charge. Twice Flournoy
has agreed to the offer. Twice
Brown has refused.
Cites Agreement
Brown bases his refusal on the
fact that Flournoy and he agreed
early in the campaign to televise
the debates only regionally. If
Flournoy had not agreed to that,
Brown would have refused to hold
any debates at all. Now Brown
says Flournoy won't abide by
their original agreement — one
which hinders an open campaign.
Brown is pulling an old
Richard Nixon campaign trick. He
is 14 points ahead of Flournoy,

according to the last poll taken.
His strategy seems to be, "the less
said, the better."
Maybe better for Jerry Brown,
but not for California. In the
wake of Watergate and nefarious
campaign trickery, California
cannot afford to let their governor
be chosen on the basis of
half-truths, generalizations, and
closed campaigns. Whether Jerry
Brown should be elected governor
of this state remains to be seen —
if and when he ever deigns it
politically expedient to let the
voters in on a few issues.
Until then, there are still two
major campaigns in California —
an open one and a closed one.
Jerry Brown talks of reform, but
talk is cheap. Apparently he isn't
ready to put his talk into practice.
Maybe he isn't ready to be
governor yet, either.
