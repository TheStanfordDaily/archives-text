The recent Daily article on
Recording for the Blind contained
an unfortunate remark by Paul
Berg regarding volunteers who are
"housewives." In two sentences
he makes "housewives" a
four-letter word and maligns them
as people whose low levels of
intelligence and educational
accomplishments make their
volunteering a waste of time. I can
beat Berg at that game and, in
only one sentence, label him a
male chauvinist pig.

The feature article (Daily,
Sept. 27) announcing the
formation of the Organization of
Stanford Women Athletes is
indicative of the overt interest in
athletic competition which has
been developing among our
women students. The purposes of
OSA, as delineated in the article,
serve to reinforce the general and
specific directions which Athletic
Director Joe Ruetz and I have,
increasingly, implemented since
September, 1972.
Your readers should know that
Ruetz and I have presented to the
University administration our
recommendations through which
additional athletic opportunities
for talented and motivated
women students, who
demonstrate such interest, are
feasible immediately and on a
long-range projection.
Those persons who have taken
time to read pages 581-591 of the
1974-75 Courses and Degrees
Bulletin have accurate
information regarding the
diversity of sports available for
women through either
department's curriculum. For
example, whereas we do not at
present have a women's track
team for intercollegiate
competition, track is offered for
women and is listed in this
quarter's Time Schedule —
contrary to information
apparently provided by the OSA.
In continuing the policies and
practices of last year, the club
sports and intramurals programs
are open to participation by men
and women. Specific information
on the diversities of these
recreational programs may be
secured from Mrs. Diaz (WPE) and
Mr. Fehring (MPE). Sign-ups for
the various intramurals are
announced regularly in OATQ as
well as in either physical
education edepartment buildings.
Title IX of the Educational
Amendments of 1972
notwithstanding, the University
and its departments of physical
education and athletics have been
and continue to move toward
eliminating inequities in
opportunity on this campus and
in our athletic conference
affiliations through which
intercollegiate competition is
possible.

Amendments of 1972

The recent Daily article on
Recording for the Blind contained
an unfortunate remark by Paul
Berg regarding volunteers who are
"housewives." In two sentences
he makes "housewives" a
four-letter word and maligns them
as people whose low levels of
intelligence and educational
accomplishments make their
volunteering a waste of time. I can
beat Berg at that game and, in
only one sentence, label him a
male chauvinist pig.

Editor:
The feature article (Daily,
Sept. 27) announcing the
formation of the Organization of
Stanford Women Athletes is
indicative of the overt interest in
athletic competition which has
been developing among our
women students. The purposes of
OSA, as delineated in the article,
serve to reinforce the general and
specific directions which Athletic
Director Joe Ruetz and I have,
increasingly, implemented since
September, 1972.
Your readers should know that
Ruetz and I have presented to the
University administration our
recommendations through which
additional athletic opportunities
for talented and motivated
women students, who
demonstrate such interest, are
feasible immediately and on a
long-range projection.
Those persons who have taken
time to read pages 581-591 of the
1974-75 Courses and Degrees
Bulletin have accurate
information regarding the
diversity of sports available for
women through either
department's curriculum. For
example, whereas we do not at
present have a women's track
team for intercollegiate
competition, track is offered for
women and is listed in this
quarter's Time Schedule —
contrary to information
apparently provided by the OSA.
In continuing the policies and
practices of last year, the club
sports and intramurals programs
are open to participation by men
and women. Specific information
on the diversities of these
recreational programs may be
secured from Mrs. Diaz (WPE) and
Mr. Fehring (MPE). Sign-ups for
the various intramurals are
announced regularly in OATQ as
well as in either physical
education edepartment buildings.
