## Relaxed Hospital Puts Children At Ease 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
Children eat warm, chewy brownies fresh
from the overn, challenge friends to pool in
the recreation room and play foosball while,
over the phonograph, "Mary Poppins" sings
of chimney sweeps and spoonfulls of sugar.
Young patients enjoy these activities at the
Marie Louise Graham Children's Center of the
Stanford University Medical Center.
Sterile walls are adorned with boldly
painted ducks, cats and clowns. Toys, books,
games and papier-mache flowers fill a bright,
spacious playroom, and furry panda bears
grace the nurses' station.
Lasting Effects
Dr. David Bergman, a resident in the
pediatrics ward, explains that a hospital stay
can be "traumatizing" for a child. If not
handled properly, "it can have lasting effects
for years. Children have perceptions of death,
dying and sickness," and can also develop
anxieties from parental separation.
"There's no question about it," Bergman
adds, "the more attention you give them, the
easier it is for the child."
As a result, visiting hours are open and
unlimited. Parents play games with their

children in the sick rooms, or simply visit with
other parents in the waiting room.
Overnight
Popping open a can of Pepsi, the weary
mother of a two month infant with heart
trouble boasted that she had not left the
hospital for four days — parents may even
sleep at the hospital.
However if mom and dad can't make it,
patients won't lack attention. Betty Lovelace,
pediatric recreation director, sees to that,
greeting each child daily with an irrepressible
smile and an occasional challenge to foosball.
She's the hospital's answer to "Mother
Hubbard" — soft, maternal, loving.
According to Lovelace, many childhood
illnesses are exaggerated by psychological
stress. "I feel I'm a failure if the children go
home hypochondriacs." She proudly adds, "I
send them home bragging about the things
they've made."
'Nicer Doctors'
Taking time out from watching Gilligan's
Island, Keith, 10, pondered the other hospital
he was once in. "This is nicer. They got nicer
doctors and nurses. At the other hospital they
wouldn't let my aunt in,"he said.

Keith thought about the Stanford Hospital
and said, "There's a lot of games and a pool
table. That's fun. Besides, bedtime is at 9:30
except if there's a good movie on, like
Thunderball. I stayed up till 11:30."
What about the sign: CHILDREN UNDER
16 NOT ALLOWED?
"You just ignore it," said Keith. "One
boy's brother and sister come in at night and
visit."
A caring staff, relaxed regulations, an
extensive play program and an orientation
program combine to help the children cope
with hospitalization.
Orientation
The Sunday before entering, children
steam into the hospital to take a tour, see
slides and ask questions. Then they meet a
nurse — in a non-threatening situation — who
gives out popsicles and answers questions.
After this, said Lovelace, children look
forward to coming back.
Under the proper supervision, patients are
permitted to play with stethoscopes, blood
pressure cuffs and syringes. Nurse Lynn Ellis
explained, "Kids release a lot of anxiety in
play. It's unrealistic to expect a small child to

enjoy a painful treatment. If they can stick
someone with a syringe they can express their
fears in a comfortable way."
A miniature model hospital complete with
dolls dressed as medical staff, designed and
patented by Lovelace, also helps children
work out their feelings. Bergman said that
since children don't "cogitate at night like
adults" to rationalize their fears, playing with
doctor and patient dolls can, serve as a
psychological release.
The book, A Visit to the Hospital, tells the
story of a child's stay, from admittance to
discharge. At the end is a chart of procedures
for which patients can earn stars.
Older children play a game of chance: "It's
real hard," says Rob, 11. "It's like a maze.
You can get sent back to surgery. You win the
game when you get to go home."
Rob, wearing dungarees and tennis shoes
(patients are not required to wear hospital
pajamas) said he wanted to go home "in a way
cause I kinda miss my dog." But he adds,
"This is better than my house. There's more
people my age."
