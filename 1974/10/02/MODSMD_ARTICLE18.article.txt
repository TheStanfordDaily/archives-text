# Nefer's Advice To The Star-Crossed
## 
### 
I've been told that my lucky day is Saturday, my lucky color is brown
and my lucky number is four. Does this say anything about my love
life and if so, what should I avoid and when? —Capricorn
Well, Saturday night's all right for more than fighting; it's also good
for Capricorns and it's a good night for going out with lovelies of
either sex. Be thankful that you're not a Scorpio, for instance — their
most lucky day is Tuesday, and carousing on Tuesday isn't guaranteed
to improve chances of making it to a Wednesday 9 a.m. class.
Aside from brown, Capricorns also tend to dig other exciting colors
such as navy or indigo blue, forest green, and basic black. Being an
earth child, it stands to reason that you should wear natural colors,
and these sombre tones echo the rock-steady Capricorn nature.
Romantically speaking you might want to try going out with four
people at once, but Nefer thinks you'd be better off going out on days
of the month that are multiples of four, such as October 4, 8, 12, 16,
20, 24, and 28.
The square of four (16) and the square root of four (two) will
probably also have an influence on you, but even in numerology it is
true that people develop a "feelipg" for what their lucky number is
independent of what the charts say. In that case, go with your own

best hunch and let experience teach you.
Why do some people say I'm a no-count, while others say I'm no
good? -Cancer
Such melancholy is extreme even for you, Cancer. Being a moon
child doesn't make anyone very stable, since Cancer's ruling planet
changes it's relative position in the sky every few days — i.e. the moon
will be in Aquarius one day, three days later it's in Pisces.
Look up in the sky tonight, Cancer. That's a full moon shining
down. It's been proven that crime increases on nights with full moons;
"lunacy" originally meant the behavior of one under the influence of
the full moon.
The influence of their swiftly-orbiting orb moves moon children's
-moods with only slightly less power than it moves great oceans. In
three days you'll feel much better.
Meanwhile, you might consider enjoying your moods in the spirit
of one of Nefer's old Cancer friends. He would often answer inquiries
on the state of his existence with the words, "I'm sad, morose, blue,
over-sexed and under-loved."
