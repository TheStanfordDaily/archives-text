## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Stanford officiate are slili several
months away from choosing a
replacement for former University
Relations Frank Newman,
now president of the University of
Rhode Island.
Presidential assistant William
Stone, heading the search, said the
original crop of 400 applicants has
bwn trimmed to 25, and will be cut
again to about half a dozen before
the final interviewing and selection.
It's understood that the current
list contains several "highpowered"
political figures, as well as
prominent educators and
businessmen.
Names on the list are closely
guarded, but reports have
mentioned Rep. Paul N. McCloskey
Jr. (R-Menlo Park), particularly
before he narrowly won
renomination in June, and state
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett
(R-Redwood City), a former
University Relations official here
who has performed numerous
favors for Stanford since moving to
Sacramento.

Although selection was
originally schfduled for Oct, 1,
Stone said it rna> now be January
before an appointment is made.
Perhaps not coincidental!}, that's
when legislative and gubernatorial
terms of office expire.
Acting University Relations
Director Don Carlson is considered
the top candidate from within the
University. However, Community
Relations Director Andrew Doty
and Governmental Relations
Director Robert Freelen have also
been mentioned as possible
contenders.

echelons of the University as an
administrator, adviser, lobbyist and

liaison with the alumni, and the
University's envoy to Washington,
Sacramento, and many educational
and professional associations.
Because of the unusually sensitive
nature of the post. University officials
are operating outside normal channels
to select a new director. Applicant
screening is being handled largely by
Stone, Vice Provost Raymond
Bacchetti, affirmative action officer
Ann Miner and legal adviser James
Siena. In most cases, selection of
applicants would be handled by a
special student-faculty-administration
panel.
President Lyman has been
personally involved "every step of the
way," said Stone, and will make the
final choice.
While not a prerequisite, experience
in government "must be considered a
very positive factor," Stone said.
Other sources indicated the
University is "very interested" in
attracting someone with "a national
reputation" who could aid in the
increasingly important dealings with
the government as a major source of
funds.
"Clearly, governmental relations is
a more important part of the job than
it was just a few years ago," Lyman
said.

Newman's expertise in several of
the diverse functions of the Job may
be difficult to replace. For example,
he had an extensive political
background as a founder of the
moderate California Republican
League and an unsuccessful
congressional candidate in 1966.
Two years ago he headed a federal
task force investigating the quality of
American high education.
Stone said the University isn't
"thinking in terms of a radical change"
in searching for a new director, but
also realizes that it "can't and won't
get a carbon copy of Frank Newman.**
Added Lyman, "It seems only obvious
that different people might have more
experience in different fields."
According to criteria being used to
screen the applicants, a new director
must be articulate, able to administer
the broad range of basically
autonomous offices in the department,
experienced in dealing with the
government, knowledgeable on
educational and political issues, and
hopefully have some previous
connection with Stanford.
