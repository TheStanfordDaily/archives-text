## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Stanford officiate are slili several
months away from choosing a
replacement for former University
Relations Frank Newman,
now president of the University of
Rhode Island.
Presidential assistant William
Stone, heading the search, said the
original crop of 400 applicants has
bwn trimmed to 25, and will be cut
again to about half a dozen before
the final interviewing and selection.
It's understood that the current
list contains several "highpowered"
political figures, as well as
prominent educators and
businessmen.
Names on the list are closely
guarded, but reports have
mentioned Rep. Paul N. McCloskey
Jr. (R-Menlo Park), particularly
before he narrowly won
renomination in June, and state
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett
(R-Redwood City), a former
University Relations official here
who has performed numerous
favors for Stanford since moving to
Sacramento.

Although selection was
originally schfduled for Oct, 1,
Stone said it rna> now be January
before an appointment is made.
Perhaps not coincidental!}, that's
when legislative and gubernatorial
terms of office expire.
Acting University Relations
Director Don Carlson is considered
the top candidate from within the
University. However, Community
Relations Director Andrew Doty
and Governmental Relations
Director Robert Freelen have also
been mentioned as possible
contenders.
The University Relations
director functions in the highest
echelons of the University as an
administrator, adviser, lobbyist and
spokesman. The office now
encompasses all governmental and
public relations functions—includ
ing the University News Service— as
well as responsibility for the
cultural programs of the Office of
Public Events.
In addition, the director must
serve as adviser to the president.
