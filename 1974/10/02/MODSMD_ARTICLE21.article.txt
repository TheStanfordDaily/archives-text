# P.A. Police Plan To Research Rapes
## 
### SUE LUTTNER 
The Palo Alto Police Department is asking
victims of unreported rapes to help with a
research projept funded by the Office of
Criminal Justice Planning (OCJP).
Women who reported being raped, victims
who did not notify police and non-victims
will be asked to talk with the project's
consulting group. The project seeks to assess
public feelings about rape and discover why
women do not report the crime, Officer
Katherine Talbot said.
Specific figures vary, but police
departments estimate that only one out of
every three to 10 rapes is reported.
"There will always be some women who
just don't want to talk about it," Officer
Lynette Bieler explained, but the reporting
rate can certainly be improved.
Arrange Contacts
To find women in the non-reporting
category, the department is asking women's
groups, community organizations and
individuals to arrange contacts.
Talbot said the study will also consider
changes in legal and medical examination

procedures that would make reporting of
rape "as non-traumatic as possible for the
victim."
The investigators will also question district
attorneys and judges to find out what
examination and investigation procedures are
essential. Talbot said that she hopes some
routine questions can be eliminated.
Research Results
The first result of the research will
probably be development of a complete
procedure plan for dealing with rape cases at
the Stanford Emergency Room and the
North County Mental Hospital, where rape
victims are usually sent, she said. Project
workers will work jointly with hospital
officials to develop this plan.
After the medical part of the study is
finished, the project directors plan to write a
training manual for Santa Clara County
police departments, Talbot said.
"We may find out that most women
would prefer to talk to a female officer about
a rape, but we want to train all officers in the
immediate procedures," Talbot explained,
because the policeman who first arrives at the

scene will often be a man.
The two-year rape study project will also
involve a community action program, which
will start with an open meeting on Tuesday,
Oct. 22, at 7:30 p.m. in the Palo Alto
Cultural Center, according to Bieler.
The scheduled program will start with an
explanation of the project and the rape
problem in Palo Alto. Discussion of legal
procedures, talks on the medical and
emotional effects of rape and a presentation
by Women Against Rape will also be
included.
Bieler said the police want women's
groups to attend the meeting and bring any
informational material they think is
appropriate. The department will also use
standard suggestion cards to solicit opinions
from the audience.
Talbot said a rising rape rate has not been
a problem in Palo Alto, but the county-wide
rate has increased to about one reported case
per day. The OCJP grant was made to Palo
Alto with the understanding that the study
will include all of Santa Clara County, she
added.
