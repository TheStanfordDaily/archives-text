## 'Fluke' SJS Goal Beats Soccer Team 
### DAN PYNE 
It grew cold and windy
yesterday afternoon, and amidst
whirlwinds of dust and unpopular
officiating the Stanford soccer
team lost to nationally ranked San
Jose State 1-0.
"San Jose has a great team,"
varsity coach Bert Baldaccini said
after the game. "We gave it all we
had, but lost on a fluke goal."
The Cardinal defense,
Baldaccini added, showed that it
is "one of the best defenses in the
league."
Unfortunately, the outstanding
defensive effort was not enough.
Stanford had only five shots on
goal in the entire game, and as
head coach Fred Priddle
remarked, "when you can't
generate more than five shots you
don't have much, of an offensive
attack."
San Jose State, however, kept
Cardinal goalie Bruce Mosbacher
very busy. Mosbacher had eight
saves in the first half, and nine in
the second half. Twice he had to

pull out of the goal to challenge
San Jose forwards.
Baldaccini said that Mosbacher
did an "excellent job" in the goal,
and singled out fullback Mack
Taylor as well. "Bruce and Mack
are both to be commended for
their play."
In spite of the lack of attack
Stanford stayed with San Jose
State all the way. The Spartans'
goal came late in the second
period when forward John Smillie
took the ball, unassisted, up the
left backline toward the Stanford
goal and put the ball high into the
right side of the net.
Stanford continued to press for
the remainder of the match but
was unable to get a clean shot at
the San Jose goal.
Friday, the Cardinals play the
University of San Francisco, a
team ranked third in the nation
among college soccer teams, but
Baldaccini thinks his team has a
chance.
"We can beat anyone in the
league," he said quietly, "and
we'll give USF a hell of a game."
