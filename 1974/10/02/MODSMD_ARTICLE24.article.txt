## Finley: The Genius Blew This One 
### Glenn Garvin 
When a sportswriter runs out of ideas, or
is pressed for time, or just feels lousy in
general, there's one sure cure: Charlie Finley.
You can always get a colorful 15 inches of
copy by dumping on Charlie. Practically
everybody hates him and they'll never fail to
see what exciting news adjectives a columnist
can apply to him. That's probably one reason
why he's gotten so much bad press: it's so
easy to do.
Most of Finley's bad reputation comes
from Neanderthals who are appalled by
Finley's radical ideas: you know, white shoes
and exploding scoreboards. Those weird
things that threaten the very fabric of the
game.
This sort of criticism of Finley is garbage.
The man is a promotional genius; most of his
innovations have made the game a little more
interesting to the casual fans without altering
baseball's fundamentals.
Don't put this column down, though. If
you're looking for some harsh words for
Charlie, you won't go away disappointed.
Because despite all the foregoing words of
worship, he still does some pretty stupid
things from time to time, and he did one of
his stupidest last Thursday in front of live
witnesses.
Poor Prescription
Speaking to a group of sportswriters, he
complained once again about low attendance
of professional baseball in the Bay Area, and
issued the Finley Prescription For Survival:
—interleague games;
—new league alignments putting all the
California franchises into one division;
—and a 20-second clock for pitchers.
That's it, sports fans. If we don't do all
that stuff, baseball will die. And we'll be to
blame.
Suggestions like these, unlike Finley's
special promotional nights, do threaten
baseball's basic nature, and they might very
well kill it if anyone is silly enough to listen
to them. Finley, like most other critics, has
badly misunderstood the people who support
baseball.
Record Loueis
They are really a very conservative lot. It
comforts them to think that everything is
written down somewhere; that in some
musty book somewhere you can find what

Bill Skowron hit in 1959, or how many
errors Enos Slaughter made in 1948, or how
many' times Bob Meusel batted in 1924. It's
all there somewhere, just like the Book of
Life. And a hell of a lot more reliable.
The essence of baseball, to most fans, is
not going out to sit at the game. It's in
reading the box score, in shuffling through
yards of fine type, in comparing
performances of 1974 with those of 1934.
But for such comparisons to have any
meaning, for them to prove anything, the
game must remain basically the same from
year to year.
Interleague play, divisional realignment
and a shorter schedule (which Finley also
advocates) destroy that essence. It undercuts
any basis for statistical comparison. If the
Dodgers hit 250 homers next year in a new
California division, what difference would it
make?
Playing in a new league against new teams,
who could say whether it meant Los Angeles
had assembled its most powerful team in 70
years — or if playing in smog six days a week
made the balls carry further?
Alien To Game
Just as Finely's structural changes would
wreck what most fans want out of baseball,
his 20-second clock would interfere with
what they want to watch. Baseball fans like
the strategic twists of their game, the war of
nerves between the pitcher and batter.
Artificial time constraints are alien to
baseball and always will be. That's why the
game has innings instead of a scoreboard
clock.
At this point it's worth examining just
why Finley thinks baseball needs change at
the moment. Attendance is up all over both
leagues, with two notable exceptions: San
Francisco and Oakland. Both teams continue
to slump at the gate.
The problem is doubly perplexing for
Finley. Despite a fine promotional job and a
team that's won consistently over the last
four years, he told the sportswriters that the
A's will have to win the World Series just to
break even. He doubtless wonders what the
hell is going on.
The answer is much simpler than schedule
changes or new clocks. If Finely had taken
Econ 1, he would understand: there aren't

enough fans in the Bay Area to support two
major league baseball teams.
Sports-wise, this is a bush league area, and
at least one team is going to have to move.
The sooner Finley realizes it the better;
there's no reason the other 22 teams should
have to suffer financially every time they
visit here.
Wrong Move
The unfortunate thing is that Charlie's
club will probably be the one to move. It's
younger, more exciting, and best of all it
wins. Horace Stoneham's club is boring,
faceless, and loses. But Stoneham refused an
offer of $3 million from Finley to leave
town. That must inevitably mean the
Athletics will be playing somewhere else in
the next two years.
From Finley's standpoint, it's just as well.
The news media here have never been behind
him, choosing to publicize a just plain lousy
Giant team over the A's, with some of the
most exciting players in baseball. The fans
have proven they don't know what's going on
by refusing to patronize a winner. Go
somewhere else, Charlie, where they
understand baseball.
But quit talking this atrocious nonsense
about changing schedules and everything else.
Baseball tradition is far bigger than any one
franchise.
*****
Something else Charlie said could be
disastrous for the Oakland Athletics in the
more immediate future — say, next week.
"We're hoping the Yankees win their
division because we feel we can beat them
more easily than Baltimore," he told the
sportswriters. That is an unbelievably foolish
statement for two reasons:
1. The evidence suggests it isn't true.
Oakland split 12 games with Baltimore this
season, but dropped seven of 12 to New
York.
2. It is just the sort of patronizing drivel
that can inspire a team to mayhem. You can
bet the Yankees will be out to beat Oakland's
collective brains out now.
As this column came out of the
typewriter, no one could call a winner in the
American League's Eastern Division. But if
Baltimore won, you bet that Someone Up
There was looking out for Charlie. If the
Yankees won,bet on them.
When a sportswriter runs out of ideas, or
is pressed for time, or just feels lousy in
general, there's one sure cure: Charlie Finley.

collective brains out now.
As this column came out of the
typewriter, no one could call a winner in the
American League's Eastern Division. But if
Baltimore won, you bet that Someone Up
There was looking out for Charlie. If the
Yankees won,bet on them.
When a sportswriter runs out of ideas, or
is pressed for time, or just feels lousy in
general, there's one sure cure: Charlie Finley.
You can always get a colorful 15 inches of
copy by dumping on Charlie. Practically
everybody hates him and they'll never fail to
see what exciting news adjectives a columnist
can apply to him. That's probably one reason
why he's gotten so much bad press: it's so
easy to do.
Most of Finley's bad reputation comes
from Neanderthals who are appalled by
Finley's radical ideas: you know, white shoes
and exploding scoreboards. Those weird
things that threaten the very fabric of the
game.
This sort of criticism of Finley is garbage.
The man is a promotional genius; most of his
innovations have made the game a little more
interesting to the casual fans without altering
baseball's fundamentals.
Don't put this column down, though. If
you're looking for some harsh words for
Charlie, you won't go away disappointed.
Because despite all the foregoing words of
worship, he still does some pretty stupid
things from time to time, and he did one of
his stupidest last Thursday in front of live
witnesses.
Poor Prescription
Speaking to a group of sportswriters, he
complained once again about low attendance
of professional baseball in the Bay Area, and
issued the Finley Prescription For Survival:
—interleague games;
—new league alignments putting all the
California franchises into one division;
—and a 20-second clock for pitchers.
That's it, sports fans. If we don't do all
that stuff, baseball will die. And we'll be to
blame.
Suggestions like these, unlike Finley's
special promotional nights, do threaten
baseball's basic nature, and they might very
well kill it if anyone is silly enough to listen
to them. Finley, like most other critics, has
badly misunderstood the people who support
baseball.
Record Loueis
They are really a very conservative lot. It
comforts them to think that everything is
written down somewhere; that in some
musty book somewhere you can find what

Bill Skowron hit in 1959, or how many
errors Enos Slaughter made in 1948, or how
many' times Bob Meusel batted in 1924. It's
all there somewhere, just like the Book of
Life. And a hell of a lot more reliable.
The essence of baseball, to most fans, is
not going out to sit at the game. It's in
reading the box score, in shuffling through
yards of fine type, in comparing
performances of 1974 with those of 1934.
But for such comparisons to have any
meaning, for them to prove anything, the
game must remain basically the same from
year to year.
Interleague play, divisional realignment
and a shorter schedule (which Finley also
advocates) destroy that essence. It undercuts
any basis for statistical comparison. If the
Dodgers hit 250 homers next year in a new
California division, what difference would it
make?
Playing in a new league against new teams,
who could say whether it meant Los Angeles
had assembled its most powerful team in 70
years — or if playing in smog six days a week
made the balls carry further?
Alien To Game
Just as Finely's structural changes would
wreck what most fans want out of baseball,
his 20-second clock would interfere with
what they want to watch. Baseball fans like
the strategic twists of their game, the war of
nerves between the pitcher and batter.
Artificial time constraints are alien to
baseball and always will be. That's why the
game has innings instead of a scoreboard
clock.
At this point it's worth examining just
why Finley thinks baseball needs change at
the moment. Attendance is up all over both
leagues, with two notable exceptions: San
Francisco and Oakland. Both teams continue
to slump at the gate.
The problem is doubly perplexing for
Finley. Despite a fine promotional job and a
team that's won consistently over the last
four years, he told the sportswriters that the
A's will have to win the World Series just to
break even. He doubtless wonders what the
hell is going on.
The answer is much simpler than schedule
changes or new clocks. If Finely had taken
Econ 1, he would understand: there aren't

enough fans in the Bay Area to support two
major league baseball teams.
Sports-wise, this is a bush league area, and
at least one team is going to have to move.
The sooner Finley realizes it the better;
there's no reason the other 22 teams should
have to suffer financially every time they
visit here.
Wrong Move
The unfortunate thing is that Charlie's
club will probably be the one to move. It's
younger, more exciting, and best of all it
wins. Horace Stoneham's club is boring,
faceless, and loses. But Stoneham refused an
offer of $3 million from Finley to leave
town. That must inevitably mean the
Athletics will be playing somewhere else in
the next two years.
From Finley's standpoint, it's just as well.
The news media here have never been behind
him, choosing to publicize a just plain lousy
Giant team over the A's, with some of the
most exciting players in baseball. The fans
have proven they don't know what's going on
by refusing to patronize a winner. Go
somewhere else, Charlie, where they
understand baseball.
But quit talking this atrocious nonsense
about changing schedules and everything else.
Baseball tradition is far bigger than any one
franchise.
*****
Something else Charlie said could be
disastrous for the Oakland Athletics in the
more immediate future — say, next week.
"We're hoping the Yankees win their
division because we feel we can beat them
more easily than Baltimore," he told the
sportswriters. That is an unbelievably foolish
statement for two reasons:
1. The evidence suggests it isn't true.
Oakland split 12 games with Baltimore this
season, but dropped seven of 12 to New
York.
2. It is just the sort of patronizing drivel
that can inspire a team to mayhem. You can
bet the Yankees will be out to beat Oakland's
collective brains out now.
As this column came out of the

American League's Eastern Division. But if
Baltimore won, you bet that Someone Up

Oakland split 12 games with Baltimore this
season, but dropped seven of 12 to New
York.
2. It is just the sort of patronizing drivel
that can inspire a team to mayhem. You can
bet the Yankees will be out to beat Oakland's
collective brains out now.
As this column came out of the
typewriter, no one could call a winner in the
American League's Eastern Division. But if
Baltimore won, you bet that Someone Up
There was looking out for Charlie. If the
Yankees won,bet on them.
When a sportswriter runs out of ideas, or
is pressed for time, or just feels lousy in
general, there's one sure cure: Charlie Finley.
You can always get a colorful 15 inches of
copy by dumping on Charlie. Practically
everybody hates him and they'll never fail to
see what exciting news adjectives a columnist
can apply to him. That's probably one reason
why he's gotten so much bad press: it's so
easy to do.
Most of Finley's bad reputation comes
from Neanderthals who are appalled by
Finley's radical ideas: you know, white shoes
and exploding scoreboards. Those weird
things that threaten the very fabric of the
game.
This sort of criticism of Finley is garbage.
The man is a promotional genius; most of his
innovations have made the game a little more
interesting to the casual fans without altering
baseball's fundamentals.
Don't put this column down, though. If
you're looking for some harsh words for
Charlie, you won't go away disappointed.
Because despite all the foregoing words of
worship, he still does some pretty stupid
things from time to time, and he did one of
his stupidest last Thursday in front of live
witnesses.
Poor Prescription
Speaking to a group of sportswriters, he
complained once again about low attendance
of professional baseball in the Bay Area, and
issued the Finley Prescription For Survival:
—interleague games;
—new league alignments putting all the
California franchises into one division;
—and a 20-second clock for pitchers.
That's it, sports fans. If we don't do all
that stuff, baseball will die. And we'll be to
blame.
Suggestions like these, unlike Finley's
special promotional nights, do threaten
baseball's basic nature, and they might very
well kill it if anyone is silly enough to listen
to them. Finley, like most other critics, has
badly misunderstood the people who support
baseball.
Record Loueis
They are really a very conservative lot. It
comforts them to think that everything is
written down somewhere; that in some
musty book somewhere you can find what

Bill Skowron hit in 1959, or how many
errors Enos Slaughter made in 1948, or how
many' times Bob Meusel batted in 1924. It's
all there somewhere, just like the Book of
Life. And a hell of a lot more reliable.
The essence of baseball, to most fans, is
not going out to sit at the game. It's in
reading the box score, in shuffling through
yards of fine type, in comparing
performances of 1974 with those of 1934.
But for such comparisons to have any
meaning, for them to prove anything, the
game must remain basically the same from
year to year.
Interleague play, divisional realignment
and a shorter schedule (which Finley also
advocates) destroy that essence. It undercuts
any basis for statistical comparison. If the
Dodgers hit 250 homers next year in a new
California division, what difference would it
make?
Playing in a new league against new teams,
who could say whether it meant Los Angeles
had assembled its most powerful team in 70
years — or if playing in smog six days a week
made the balls carry further?
Alien To Game
Just as Finely's structural changes would
wreck what most fans want out of baseball,
his 20-second clock would interfere with
what they want to watch. Baseball fans like
the strategic twists of their game, the war of
nerves between the pitcher and batter.
Artificial time constraints are alien to
baseball and always will be. That's why the
game has innings instead of a scoreboard
clock.
At this point it's worth examining just
why Finley thinks baseball needs change at
the moment. Attendance is up all over both
leagues, with two notable exceptions: San
Francisco and Oakland. Both teams continue
to slump at the gate.
The problem is doubly perplexing for
Finley. Despite a fine promotional job and a
team that's won consistently over the last
four years, he told the sportswriters that the
A's will have to win the World Series just to
break even. He doubtless wonders what the
hell is going on.
The answer is much simpler than schedule
changes or new clocks. If Finely had taken
Econ 1, he would understand: there aren't

enough fans in the Bay Area to support two
major league baseball teams.
Sports-wise, this is a bush league area, and
at least one team is going to have to move.
The sooner Finley realizes it the better;
there's no reason the other 22 teams should
have to suffer financially every time they
visit here.
Wrong Move
The unfortunate thing is that Charlie's
club will probably be the one to move. It's
younger, more exciting, and best of all it
wins. Horace Stoneham's club is boring,
faceless, and loses. But Stoneham refused an
offer of $3 million from Finley to leave
town. That must inevitably mean the
Athletics will be playing somewhere else in
the next two years.
From Finley's standpoint, it's just as well.
The news media here have never been behind
him, choosing to publicize a just plain lousy
Giant team over the A's, with some of the
most exciting players in baseball. The fans
have proven they don't know what's going on
by refusing to patronize a winner. Go
somewhere else, Charlie, where they
understand baseball.
But quit talking this atrocious nonsense
about changing schedules and everything else.
Baseball tradition is far bigger than any one
franchise.

Something else Charlie said could be
disastrous for the Oakland Athletics in the
more immediate future — say, next week.
"We're hoping the Yankees win their
division because we feel we can beat them
more easily than Baltimore," he told the
sportswriters. That is an unbelievably foolish
statement for two reasons:
1. The evidence suggests it isn't true.
Oakland split 12 games with Baltimore this
season, but dropped seven of 12 to New
York.
2. It is just the sort of patronizing drivel
that can inspire a team to mayhem. You can

"We're hoping the Yankees win their
division because we feel we can beat them
more easily than Baltimore," he told the
sportswriters. That is an unbelievably foolish
statement for two reasons:
1. The evidence suggests it isn't true.
Oakland split 12 games with Baltimore this
season, but dropped seven of 12 to New
York.
2. It is just the sort of patronizing drivel
that can inspire a team to mayhem. You can
bet the Yankees will be out to beat Oakland's
collective brains out now.
As this column came out of the
typewriter, no one could call a winner in the
American League's Eastern Division. But if
Baltimore won, you bet that Someone Up
There was looking out for Charlie. If the
Yankees won,bet on them.
