# Cards Consolidate Inconsistent Offense
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Before Stanford can even think
about upsetting Michigan
Saturday, it must first tackle
another enemyâ€”poor offensive
execution.
In an effort to stop the
mistakes which have left the
Cardinals undefeating after three
games, coach Jack Christiansen
has consolidated the offense.
"We're only going to run eight,
10, 12 basic plays," Chris said at
the Northern California Football
Writers luncheon in San Francisco
yesterday.
He later explained his
reasoning as follows. "Sometimes
you ask a blocker to block a guy
on defense and there's just no way
he can do it. So you just have to
go with the things you can do the
best."

Keith Rowen, one of the
nation's premier offensive tackles,
said the Card offensive line was
"making too many mental
mistakes. We're not thinking, not
adapting."
Chris lamented that "this year,
we set up a play, and someone
misses an assignment and bang, we
don't gain any yards. And it's
never the same guy making the
mistake."
Hopefully, the consolidated
offense will mean better
execution. Which will be needed
against third-ranked Michigan, a
team which has outscored its first
three foes 107-7.
The Wolverine defense is
"possibly the best in the
country," according to Rowen,
and is especially tough up the
middle. Since Stanford has been

weak on inside runs, it's likely the
offense, run by QB Jerry
Waldvogel, will look elsewhere for
yardage.
Michigan should be "at least a
40-point favorite," Christiansen
said, apparently seriously. Chris
made several other good-natured
comments, embellishing his status
as an underdog, in the fashion of
San Jose State coach Darryl
Rogers.

Cardinal Notes: This week's

captains are Eric Test and Gordy
Riegel... Michigan appears dead
set on getting QB Dennis Franklin
the Heisman Trophy, and
Wolverine SID Will Perry praised
him lavishly yesterday .. . Pac-8
team statistics show Stanford first
in passing yardage, but last in
rushing offense ... Jean Zwicky,
secretary to Card SIDs for the last
10 years, has finally gotten a
promotion to administrative
assistant. SID Gary Cavalli called
the move "five years overdue."
