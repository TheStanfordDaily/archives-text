G»vei4Jp Goes Tt Trial
WASHINGTON' — The Watergate cover-up case
went to trial yesterday with the judge predicting it
will be months before the jury renders its verdict
upon men who once sat in the high councils of
government with Richard M. Nixon.
"Every effort will be made to conclude the trial
before the holiday season, but this cannot be
guaranteed," UjS. District Judge John J. Sirica said
on the first day of the time-consuming process of
selecting a jury.
By day's end the first pool of 155 prospective
jurors had been whittled to 65 and each one will be
questioned in more detail and privacy tomorrow. In
the meantime, a second panel of 175 will go
through the initial weeding-out process today.
Before Sirica as defendants in a criminal
conspiracy case were three men once counted as
among the post powerful in government, John N.
Mitchell, Nixon's law-and-order attorney general;
H.R. Haldeman, Nixon's chief of staff and John D.
Ehrlichman, through whom all domestic programs
cleared.
Along with co-defendants Robert C. Maid tan and
Kenneth W. Parkinson, who were employed by the
Nixon re-election committee in 1972, they were
accused of trying to hide responsibility for the
Watergate break-in through "deceit, craft, trickery
and dishonest means."
Nixoa's Coadkioa Improves
LONG BEACH — Former President Richard M.
Nixon got good news yesterday-his doctor says the
potentially dangerous blood clot in his right lung has
apparently began to dear up and latest tests show
no sign of any new dot.
In a medical bulletin. Dr. John C. Lungren said
the gelatin-like dot was being naturally absorbed
into Nixon's system. He said the anticoagulants
Nixon had been taken had apparently prevented
another dot.
The development was announced after Nixon,
61, was wheeled into the hospital Radiology
Department for more x-rays.
Lungren also said he now believes the dot moved
to the lung two weeks before Nixon's
hospitalization, when he and his wife Pat were
vacationing in Palm Springs. The dot, smaller than a
dime, broke from a clot created by chronic phlebitis
in Nixon's left leg.
Lungren feared earlier that another piece of the
leg dot might break off and move through Nixon's
heart to the lungs. If a dot lodged in his heart, it
could be fatal.
There was no indication whether the
development meant that Nixon would be released
from Memorial Hospital Medical Center of Long
Beach before tomorrow.
The doctor added, however, that the former
president would not be able to travel any great
distance for at least a month and must continue to
take medication at his seaside home in San
ClemenLe. He entered the hospital Sept. 23.

CLEVELAND — The Cleveland Indians will
name Prank Robinson as the first black manager in
major league baseball on Thursday, it was learned
last night.
The team plans a news conference here sometime
Thursday, knowledgeable baseball sources said, to
officially announce the choice of the 39-year-old
Robinson to succeed Ken Aspromonte, who was
fired last Friday, effective at the end of the season.
The selection of Robinson as a manager comes
27 years after another Robinson broke the color

relation to Frank—became the first black to play in
the majors when he donned the uniform of the
Brooklyn Dodgers.
SLA Murder Trial Poatpoaed
OAKLAND — The murder trial of two
Symbionese Liberation Army "soldiers" was
postponed yesterday until Nov. 15 while the
California Supreme Court deliberates a possible
change of location because of massive publicity.
Joseph M. Remiro, 28, and Russell J. little, 24,
are charged with the Nov. 6 cyanide bullet
assassination of Oakland School Supt. Marcus
Foster, a popular black educator.
The tiny terrorist SLA, which kidnaped
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst on Feb. 4, has
claimed Remiro and Little as its "soldiers." The two
men have sent communications to the group which
lost six members in a fiery shootout with Lx>s
Angeles police on May 17.
The SLA claimed responsibility for the Foster
assassination.
Thiea Plaw For Third Ten
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu charged

last night that the United States reneged on
promises of increased aid for South Vietnam
because of "'internal problems."
In a two-hour broadcast and televised speech.
Thieu also rejected charges of corruption against
him and. his family and made dear that he plans to
run next year for a third term.
But he offered to resign if he loses the trust of
the South Vietnamese people and armed forces,
indicating that only 7 he can determine if they lose
faith.
Thieu said the U.S. government promised him 20
months ago when he accepted the Paris agreement
that ended American involvement in Vietnam that it
would react strongly if the other side violated the
cease-fire and North Vietnamese troops infiltrated
into the south.
"But now there is no such reaction because of
their internal problems." he said. "If the aid does
not stay at its old level, with the prospect of a
general offensive, the situation will become very
critical. If military and economic aid is not satisfied,
1 think the UjS. Congress' attitude would only
encourage the Communists to invade South
Vietnam."
Thieu spoke as U.S. Deputy Secretary 7 of Defense
William Clements arrived from Bangkok to reassure
the South Vietnamese president that the Ford
administration will continue to press for
supplemental aid.
Congress cut military aid to Saigon by more than
half to $700 million. The Ford administration is
seeking $750 million in economic support, but this
too is expected to be cut to possibly $400 million.
