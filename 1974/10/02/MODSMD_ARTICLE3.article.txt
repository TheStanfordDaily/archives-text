# Older Students Get Loans
## 
### CYNTHIA CIMA 
Money to fill the Stanford tuition
coffers may be harder to come by for
most undergraduates this year, but for
those 26 years old or older this could
be a year of good fortune.
First came a recent announcement
by the California State Scholarship

and Loan Commission, a progiam
giving partial aid to nearly 1000
Stanford undergrads. The Commission
announced it would drop its age
requirement for applicants as of
January 1975.
In the past, an undergraduate
applicant for a state scholarship or
loan had to be age 30 or younger.
According to state Assemblyman
Howard Berinan (D-Sherman Oaks),
author of the bill which erased the age
requirement, "this bill will increase
educational opportunities for many
people who did not have a chance to
attend college in their younger years."
On the same note, Bank of America
this week did away with the age limit
for applicants to its Federally Insured
Student Loan (FISL) program.
Under FISL, each participating
bank if free to set its own limitations.
Bank of America had previously
restricted its loans to undergraduates
under 26, except in some cases where
the student was a regular customer of
the bank.
Benita Coyle, student loan officer
at the Stanford branch, said that the
main reason for the change was to
make it possible for women who have
been out of school for several years to
pursue an undergraduate course of
study.
Two other nearby banks
participating in FISL still have some
form of maximum age limit. Roger B.
Adams, manager of the Wells Fargo
Stanford branch, said "It would be
very difficult for an undergraduate
over 26 years of age to receive a
student loan.
"Most banks are not enthusiastic
about student loans, Adams
continued. "Every time a bank grants
a student loan, they're losing money."
Adams was referring to the seven
percent simple interest in the FISL
program, the only student loan
program currently handled by banks.
Interest rates of 12 and 13 percent are
common for most non-student bank
loans.
Crocker National Bank in Palo Alto
does not grant student loans to
undergraduates over age 25 as regular
bank policy, although it may grant one
in individual cases, according to
manager Robert Norton.
Mary Roberts, assistant director for
undergraduate awards said that
financing an undergraduate education
for older students has not yet created
a problem in the financial aids office.
The results of a study by the Office
of the Registrar showed 18 men and

2b women undergraduates with
birthdates in 1948 or earlier. But the
financial aids office has no
corresponding statistics on how these
students pay their tuition.
The small number of older students
has not had a great impact on the
office, Roberts said.
Ken Kaufman, student loan
coordinator, recalled one 40-year-old
undergraduate who financed his
education with a Stanford scholarship
and an FISL. but quoted no figures on
the rest of the students. Kaufman said
the office does not discriminate on the
basis of age in granting financial
assistance.

Benita Coyle, student loan officer
at the Stanford branch, said that the
main reason for the change was to
make it possible for women who have
been out of school for several years to
pursue an undergraduate course of
study.
Two other nearby banks
participating in FISL still have some
form of maximum age limit. Roger B.
Adams, manager of the Wells Fargo
Stanford branch, said "It would be
very difficult for an undergraduate
over 26 years of age to receive a
student loan.
"Most banks are not enthusiastic
about student loans, Adams
continued. "Every time a bank grants
a student loan, they're losing money."
Adams was referring to the seven
percent simple interest in the FISL
program, the only student loan
program currently handled by banks.
Interest rates of 12 and 13 percent are
common for most non-student bank
loans.
Crocker National Bank in Palo Alto
does not grant student loans to
undergraduates over age 25 as regular
bank policy, although it may grant one
in individual cases, according to
manager Robert Norton.
Mary Roberts, assistant director for
undergraduate awards said that
financing an undergraduate education
for older students has not yet created
a problem in the financial aids office.
The results of a study by the Office
of the Registrar showed 18 men and

2b women undergraduates with
birthdates in 1948 or earlier. But the
financial aids office has no
corresponding statistics on how these
students pay their tuition.
The small number of older students
has not had a great impact on the
office, Roberts said.
Ken Kaufman, student loan
coordinator, recalled one 40-year-old
undergraduate who financed his
education with a Stanford scholarship
and an FISL. but quoted no figures on
the rest of the students. Kaufman said
the office does not discriminate on the
basis of age in granting financial
assistance.
Money to fill the Stanford tuition
coffers may be harder to come by for
most undergraduates this year, but for
those 26 years old or older this could
be a year of good fortune.
First came a recent announcement
by the California State Scholarship

and Loan Commission, a progiam
giving partial aid to nearly 1000
Stanford undergrads. The Commission
announced it would drop its age
requirement for applicants as of
January 1975.
In the past, an undergraduate
applicant for a state scholarship or
loan had to be age 30 or younger.
According to state Assemblyman
Howard Berinan (D-Sherman Oaks),
author of the bill which erased the age
requirement, "this bill will increase
educational opportunities for many
people who did not have a chance to
attend college in their younger years."
On the same note, Bank of America
this week did away with the age limit
for applicants to its Federally Insured
Student Loan (FISL) program.
Under FISL, each participating
bank if free to set its own limitations.
Bank of America had previously
restricted its loans to undergraduates
under 26, except in some cases where
the student was a regular customer of
the bank.
