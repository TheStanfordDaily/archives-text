### WILLIAM ROSS 
Pilo Alto police last week raided a
massage parlor in a building partly
owned by Santa Clara Mayor Gary
Gillmor. a candidate for Congress in
the 12th District, which includes
Stanford.
Immediately after the raid, Gillmor
denied having any knowledge that the
building was housing a massage parlor.
Wade Brummel, Gillmor s press
secretary, told Daily that he doubts if
the matter will have much impact on
the congressional campai&i.
"I think most people are
sophisticated enough to realize thai
there is a difference between leasing a
building and being responsible for the
activities that might go on within the
building," Brummel declared.
He added he would be very
surprised if Gillmor's opponent. Rep.
Paul N. McClo&key Jr. (R-Menlo Park),
emphasizes the issue. That would be a

"below the belt" Lactic, Brummri said.
He also noted that during the Gist
McQoskey-Gillmor debate after the
raid, McOo&key made no mention of
the matter.
Two employees of the Royal
Massage Parlor at 2435 Birch St. were
arrested in the raid, according to SgU
Jack Gamer of the Palo Alto Police
Department.
One was arrested for soliciting
prostitution and the other was arrested
for soliciting prostitution, soliciting a
lewd act, and perversion, Gamer said.
Both were released on bail.
The massage parlor is still in
operation and Gillmor is legally
obligated to retain the $250 a month
lease unless the — 112 parlor
operators are convicted.
Brummei said that Gillmor had
been told that the tenants would
operate a health studio on the
property.
