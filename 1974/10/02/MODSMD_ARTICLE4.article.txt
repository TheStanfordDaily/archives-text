# City Council Finally Sells Drug Center
## 
### 
Unity House, Palo Alto's
controversial residential anti-drug
center, will be sold, the Palo Alto City
Council decided early yesterday
morning.
"It is fairly well established that a
residential treatment center with
regard to heroin addiction doesn't
work," Councilman Richard
Rosenbaum said.
Unity House, at 851 University
Ave., has been closed since March due
to reported drug usage, thefts and
internal problems.
Monday night, the council voted
5-2, with Vice Mayor Alan Henderson
and Councilwoman Enid Pearson
dissenting, to keep the house closed
and forget the idea of another
residential center elsewhere.
The vote to sell the house was 6 to
1 with Pearson opposed.
Councilman John Beahrs called the
center "the biggest ripoff this town
has ever suffered at the hands of
cynical, undisciplined people."
Later he explained that the
"ripoffs" included the $90,000 spent
to purchase the house and the payroll
and equipment expenses connected
with the program.
Pearson objected that the nearest
similar centers are in Redwood City
and San Jose, and that lack of a
residential center in Palo Alto would
be "driving the drug-addicted people
out of town."
The city, through the Palo Alto
Community Drug Abuse Board, also
operates a downtown treatment center
in a new location, 829 Emerson St.
The center at Emerson was forced
from its former location 420 Ramona
St. when the owner refused to renew
the lease with the city. The center
occupied the Ramona St. office for
two years.
