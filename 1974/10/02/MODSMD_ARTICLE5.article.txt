# Gibbs Attacks Residential College As Too Expensive, Cumbersome
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Questions over the feasibility of a
residential college here reman a major
stumbling block for proponents of the
"Stanford-in-Stanford" plan, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs
said yesterday.
"It's too cumbersome; it's too
expensive," Gibbs said of the current
proposal.
At a press conference last
Wednesday, co-author ThomasGlenn,a
graduate student in anthropology,
noted that costs could run $150,000
per year to operate the program,
which would involve 45 students and
five professors in a two-quarter
intensive learning experience.
Gibbs repeatedly emphasized that
he does not want to stifle student
currieular innovation. However, he did
suggest that the price tag on
Stanford-in-Stanford r ould be too
high.
"If the cost were $150,000 it
would be more expensive than
SWOPSI, SCIRE, Urban Studies and
the Undergraduate Specials programs
combined," Gibbs noted. He added
that instructional costs would
comprise the bulk of the program's
budget.
Refinement
Gibbs favored increased residential
education, but argued that the
Stanford-in-Stanford idea needed
refinement.
"I think it was tactically incorrect
to spring |the plan] full-blown. Now,
you either have to attack the proposal,
or else endorse it out of hand.

Unfortunately, we can't endorse it
without questioning it first," Gibbs
explained.
ASSU President Mike Herman, who
co-authored the proposal with Glenn,
said last Wednesday that a possible
source of funds for the residential
college was from foundations. Recent
proposals for cutbacks in the Ford
Foundation's budget could eliminate
foundation money, however, and
Gibbs added that many philanthropic
institutions would not even consider
the proposal for funding.
Not New
"It's not the sort of thing a
foundation will fund, because it's not
new. The idea of people living and
learning together is as old as the hills,"
Gibbs remarked.
The plan, if implemented, would
establish a policy committee for the
residential college which would be a
subcommittee of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. Gibbs
questioned the merits of providing an
administrative structure for the plan
before consultation with the
University administrators involved.
Gibbs said the administrative
structure set up in the residential
college proposal was much too
elaborate and repeated mistakes made
in the past.
Herman and Glenn did not consult
with Gibbs or Larry Horton, associate
dean of student affairs for residential
education, before releasing the
finished proposal, according to both
administrators. Gibbs and Horton will
present their views on

Stanford in-Stanford during KZSU's
Campus Conference to be aired next
Tuesday.
"Let's talk about the idea of how
we could have some type of learning
experience that would be residential in
structure for a small number of
students," Gibbs suggested. "What is
important is that the students who
study together live together.
"In other words, you can have
them together, but not necessarily in
such a self-contained program."
Gibbs mildly criticized the
co-authors for presenting the proposal
for administration approval without
first getting concrete evidence of
faculty or student interest.
"You never start building any
program in this University from the
top down," Gibbs commented.

administrative structure for the plan
before consultation with the
University administrators involved.
Gibbs said the administrative
structure set up in the residential
college proposal was much too
elaborate and repeated mistakes made
in the past.
Herman and Glenn did not consult
with Gibbs or Larry Horton, associate
dean of student affairs for residential
education, before releasing the
finished proposal, according to both
administrators. Gibbs and Horton will
present their views on

Stanford in-Stanford during KZSU's
Campus Conference to be aired next
Tuesday.
"Let's talk about the idea of how
we could have some type of learning
experience that would be residential in
structure for a small number of
students," Gibbs suggested. "What is
important is that the students who
study together live together.
"In other words, you can have
them together, but not necessarily in
such a self-contained program."
Gibbs mildly criticized the
co-authors for presenting the proposal
for administration approval without
first getting concrete evidence of
faculty or student interest.
"You never start building any
program in this University from the
top down," Gibbs commented.

Questions over the feasibility of a
residential college here reman a major
stumbling block for proponents of the
"Stanford-in-Stanford" plan, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs
said yesterday.
"It's too cumbersome; it's too
expensive," Gibbs said of the current
proposal.
At a press conference last
Wednesday, co-author ThomasGlenn,a
graduate student in anthropology,
noted that costs could run $150,000
per year to operate the program,
which would involve 45 students and
five professors in a two-quarter
intensive learning experience.
Gibbs repeatedly emphasized that
he does not want to stifle student
currieular innovation. However, he did
suggest that the price tag on
Stanford-in-Stanford r ould be too
high.
"If the cost were $150,000 it
would be more expensive than
SWOPSI, SCIRE, Urban Studies and
the Undergraduate Specials programs
combined," Gibbs noted. He added
that instructional costs would
comprise the bulk of the program's
budget.
Refinement
Gibbs favored increased residential
education, but argued that the
Stanford-in-Stanford idea needed
refinement.
"I think it was tactically incorrect
to spring |the plan] full-blown. Now,
you either have to attack the proposal,
or else endorse it out of hand.

Unfortunately, we can't endorse it
without questioning it first," Gibbs
explained.
ASSU President Mike Herman, who
co-authored the proposal with Glenn,
said last Wednesday that a possible
source of funds for the residential
college was from foundations. Recent
proposals for cutbacks in the Ford
Foundation's budget could eliminate
foundation money, however, and
Gibbs added that many philanthropic
institutions would not even consider
the proposal for funding.
Not New
"It's not the sort of thing a
foundation will fund, because it's not
new. The idea of people living and
learning together is as old as the hills,"
Gibbs remarked.
The plan, if implemented, would
establish a policy committee for the
residential college which would be a
subcommittee of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. Gibbs
questioned the merits of providing an
administrative structure for the plan
before consultation with the
University administrators involved.
