# DeYoung Warns:
## Stanford Must Continue To Conserve Fuel 
### DAN PYNE 
The energy crisis that caused some
inconvenience and much worry on
campus last year is still around.
Dan DeYoung, director of service
operations, explained Stanford cannot
afford to let up on energy
conservation programs initiated last
year.
"We are not threatened with a
shortage of oil this year," DeYoung
said, "but we do face an increase in
price. Heating oil prices are expected
to double this year, and gas prices are
also expected to go up a great deal."
DeYoung said that these increases,
when added to a general rise in the
rates of all utilities, could mean a
substantial increase in University
operating costs, which in turn, would
affect the cost of tuition.
Help
"Operating costs is one of the few
areas where everyone can help to make
a dent in the high cost of a Stanford
education," DeYoung said. He
emphasized that the University
community should take advantage of
"every opportunity to conserve
energy."
As director of Plant Services last
year, DeYoung spearheaded a
conservation program that reduced
electricity and heating oil
consumption 20 percent over 1972-73
levels, for a net savings of about
$300,000.
One of the major problems
DeYoung faced last year was the lack
of a oifficient emergency supply of

heating oil.
The University steam boilers that
are responsible for heating campus
buildings rely upon natural gas
supplied by Pacific Gas & Electric.
Because Stanford uses a large
quantity of gas it is classified as a
commercial user and may buy gas at a
lower price. However, service to
commercial customers is on an
incompatible basis.
When PG&E does interrupt service,
the University must rely on a standing
supply of heating oil. Last year at this
time there were only 30,000 gallons
on hand, a one day supply of fuel.
PG&E later cut off gas supplies to
Stanford for three days, but by that
time De Young' had expanded
emergency reserves enough to meet
the demand.
This year PG&E predicts it will
have to interrupt service 10 to 16
times. A result, DeYoung said,
University heating oil supplies have
been increased to 540,000 gallons, a
21-day supply.
DeYoung also said that the
conservation programs initiated last
year are being continued this year.
Unnecessary heating and lighting in
classrooms and dorms will be
eliminated on weekends, and over
Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks.
"We've shown that we can conserve
energy," DeYoung concluded, but
warned that the forecast of a severe
winter this year underlines the
importance of a continuing energy
conservation effort.
