## Editorials Photo ID's 
### 
We are strongly opposed to the elimination of
photographs from University identification cards. We feel
that the present two-card system is wasteful for those who
take food service meal plans, and that ID cards without
pictures especially inconvenience the large majority of
students who have nothing to do with the food service.
The new University ID is virtually worthless. Many
students have complained that stores and merchants are not
accepting these cards for purposes of cashing checks or
giving students discount rates. This has special impact on
those students who come from states which don't place
pictures on drivers' livenses.
We feel that this problem can be resolved if the
University simply leaves a space for a picture on each ID
card. Then students who need pictures on their cards can
have them attached to the official University ID. This would
eliminate the problem of having picture cards only for those
students with meal plans, and would avoid the unnecessary
duplication we have now. Picture ID's would be optional, so
those students who would object to having thier pictures
taken should have no complaint.
Since the original purpose of switching to the present
system was to reduce cost to the University, we would
finally recommend that each student desiring a photo ID
pay the additional cost of having the picture processed.
From past University estimates, this cost should amount to
little more than $1 a student. Or perhaps a voluntary
check-off system on registration forms could be used to add
the cost of a photo ID to the total amount a student must
pay.
