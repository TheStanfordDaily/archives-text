# What We Can Do

The sight of the world's leading
economists huddled together in
Washington is quite a spectacle.
With the accompanying fanfare in
the press, it is not unusual to see
people place great faith in the
proposition that economic
wizardry can and will successfully
deal with our economic woes.
In this respect President Ford
may have done the country a
disservice by calling the economic
summit and delyaing the day the
American people realize they will
have to back down to a more
reasonable standard of living.
We've simply been living too
high on the hog.
Needless to say, this is a highly
unfavorable position to take and
there is no rush by politicians to
embrace any similar philosophy.
The basic rules of politics dictate
one should never suggest the
people have too much.
Lack Resources
But we just do not have the
resources to continue to maintain
such a high level of living. Easing
ourselves back down without too
much of a crunch is a problem,
however. It might just take a good
depression or recession to
accomplish that.
But, perhaps, rather than
cutting taxes to preserve the
consumers' purchasing power, as
suggested by many, we should
raise them to curtail the current
buying spree.
People might be encouraged to
save instead of spend. The
country could abandon its
debt-oriented frame of mind.
Arabs No Danger
U.S. economists are needlessly
preoccupied with feared impact of
the Arabs' petro-dollars on our
economy. The Arabs are not going
to threaten or damage the
financial structure that gives

meaning to their money.
We cannot wait for Project
Independence to free us from any
dependence on Arab oil, but must
move immediately to reduce its
consumption. The latter can be
done most effectively through the
imposition of a large gas tax, such
as the 20 cents a gallon Ford is
reportedly considering.
Government expenditures need
to be cut significantly, not just a
cosmetic $5 to $10 billion. The
budget could be balanced with
cuts in the defense budget alone.
It is none of our business to be
building specialized weapons
designed to fight "limited" wars,
if there is such a thing, like
Vietnam. How quickly we forget.
Food Foundation
While arms and oil may
currently dominate international
trade channels, the United States'
near-unparaHeled capacity for
food production could provide
the foundation for our economy
in future years.
But even if all of these changes
were to occur over the screams of
labor leaders, corporate officials
and the people themselves, the
international outlook is gloomy.
Italy has been temporarily
saved from bankruptcy by
Germany and Britain is so near
the brink of collapse that vigilante
groups are forming to run the
country when the government
falls.
But since the U.S. does have
some influence in international
affairs, there is some hope if we
pull through.
While this writer is fairly bush
league when it comes to
economics, the economists' have
had their say, and so far it's been
of little help.
