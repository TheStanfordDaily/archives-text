# Campus Pub Opening Postponed Again
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The possibility of an on-campus
pub serving beer and wine opening
before winter quarter has virtually
disappeared, Tresidder Union Manager
Gordon Starr admitted Tuesday.
Nine food service companies will
submit bids on the pub by Oct. 14,
Starr said, However, even if one
company's offer is accepted, the pub
won't be open by the beginning of
next quarter—and, odds are, not for
some time after that.
Construction cannot begin until
approval of the pub's liquor license is
almost assured, Starr explained. And
until the University decides which
company will run the pub, the
company can't apply for the license.
Starr said the University will take
two to four weeks after the deadline
to evaluate the bid packages, which
include bids on the cafeteria, coffee
house and University catering ?r * ; ces
as well as the pub.
'Creative Input'
The University is encouraging the
food services companies to "use their
own creative input" in determining a
bidding package, he said.
He warned, however, that if none
of the bid packages are acceptable to
the University, the University will then
ask for bids on the projects separately.
This could mean an additional two
months before a company is picked
for any of the projects, he said.
Verbal Agreement
Last spring, Starr predicted that the
pub would probably open in
September when a verbal agreement
was reached with Guckenheimer Food
Service on an operating contract.
Guckenheimer is the holding company
for TDS Inc., which has been
operating the Tresidder Food Service.

Disagreement on financial
arrangements later arose when the
written agreement was being drawn up
and negotiations broke down in July.
After that, the project bogged down in
bidding procedures.
Starr said the nine food services
companies which plan to submit
bidding packages, are TDS, Saga,
ARA, Service Systems, S ( ervomation,
Interstate United Corp., Greyhound,
Canteen and Mannings.
Although the University has
received no. bids yet, Starr said
companies typically do not send in
proposals until the deadline.
Liquor License
Once the University selects a
company to run the pub, that
company will apply to the State
Department of Alcoholic Beverage
Control (ABC) for a liquor license.
Once the application is submitted, a
45-day waiting period follows. During
this period a "notice of intent" to sell
beer and wine must be posted for 30
days. If anyone objects, he can
demand a hearing.
The Faculty Club, which has a
liquor license allowing sale of hard
liquor, spent a year and a half
obtaining ABC approval.
Francis Small, the lawyer for the
club in its fight, said earlier that
"unless the attitude of the ABC has
changed, the new pub can anticipate
significant delay."
Starr said Tuesday that he hopes
the pub will open before spring
quarter.
Starr said he could not give a final
deadline, but noted "if the pub does
not open by next fall, it probably will
not open until 18-year-olds are given
the right to drink."

companies which plan to submit
bidding packages, are TDS, Saga,
ARA, Service Systems, S ( ervomation,
Interstate United Corp., Greyhound,
Canteen and Mannings.
Although the University has
received no. bids yet, Starr said
companies typically do not send in
proposals until the deadline.
Liquor License
Once the University selects a
company to run the pub, that
company will apply to the State
Department of Alcoholic Beverage
Control (ABC) for a liquor license.
Once the application is submitted, a
45-day waiting period follows. During
this period a "notice of intent" to sell
beer and wine must be posted for 30
days. If anyone objects, he can
demand a hearing.
The Faculty Club, which has a
liquor license allowing sale of hard
liquor, spent a year and a half
obtaining ABC approval.
Francis Small, the lawyer for the
club in its fight, said earlier that
"unless the attitude of the ABC has
changed, the new pub can anticipate
significant delay."
Starr said Tuesday that he hopes
the pub will open before spring
quarter.
Starr said he could not give a final
deadline, but noted "if the pub does
not open by next fall, it probably will
not open until 18-year-olds are given
the right to drink."

BAD NEWS—Tresidder Memorial Union (TMU) Manager Gordon Starr admitted
Tuesday that the long-awaited on-campus pub has been delayed again—this time
until at least spring quarter. Earlier this year, Starr had predicted that the pub
would open during winter quarter.
The possibility of an on-campus
pub serving beer and wine opening
before winter quarter has virtually
disappeared, Tresidder Union Manager
Gordon Starr admitted Tuesday.
Nine food service companies will
submit bids on the pub by Oct. 14,
Starr said, However, even if one
company's offer is accepted, the pub
won't be open by the beginning of
next quarter—and, odds are, not for
some time after that.
Construction cannot begin until
approval of the pub's liquor license is
almost assured, Starr explained. And
until the University decides which
company will run the pub, the
company can't apply for the license.
Starr said the University will take
two to four weeks after the deadline
to evaluate the bid packages, which
include bids on the cafeteria, coffee
house and University catering ?r * ; ces
as well as the pub.
'Creative Input'
The University is encouraging the
food services companies to "use their
own creative input" in determining a
bidding package, he said.
He warned, however, that if none
of the bid packages are acceptable to
the University, the University will then
ask for bids on the projects separately.
This could mean an additional two
months before a company is picked
for any of the projects, he said.
Verbal Agreement
Last spring, Starr predicted that the
pub would probably open in
September when a verbal agreement
was reached with Guckenheimer Food
Service on an operating contract.
Guckenheimer is the holding company
for TDS Inc., which has been
operating the Tresidder Food Service.

Disagreement on financial
arrangements later arose when the
written agreement was being drawn up
and negotiations broke down in July.
After that, the project bogged down in
bidding procedures.

companies which plan to submit
bidding packages, are TDS, Saga,
ARA, Service Systems, S ( ervomation,
Interstate United Corp., Greyhound,
