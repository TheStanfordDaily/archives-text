# Frats Relieve Housing Shortage
##

After reading John Freed's
article of Sept. 30, I can't help
but feel somewhat strange sitting
here writing a defense of
fraternities when only three years
ago I, like most freshman of those
days, â€¢ was virulently against
fraternities, those bastions of
conservativism and all that is evil.
Somehow, however, that year I
found myself pledging a
fraternity, and my outlooked has
changed somewhat.
As we all know, Stanford
University banned sororities in
1944 after they came under fire
for certain reasons. A student
referendum supported this
decision, and Stanford began its
thirty-year policy of refusing
housing to women outside the
draw. Fraternities were never
seriously challenged and have
survived, obviously, to this day.
In the late fifties, however, in
building the bookstore and post
office, the University was moved
to dismantle part of the old Row.
Those fraternities which were
displaced were given the option of
coming up with close to $200,000
each for new buildings in what
were to become the fraternity
clusters. The rest of the money
for the buildings was provided by
government loans which the
University was able to get. The
catch was that the new buildings,
unlike the old ones, were to be
signed over to the University.
Therein lies the rub, Mr. Freed.
That, believe it or not, is how it
came to pass that the individual
frats raised large sums of money
for houses to which they do not
hold title.
Discrimination
Today, 30 years after the
demise of Stanford sororities and
15 years after the destruction
of the old Row, we find to our
horror that Stanford has been
discriminating against women by
allowing all-male fraternities to
exist, thereby granting housing
privileges not extended to women.
Oh, thou wretched cur, thou

frat-rat! How couldst thou be so
base? Well let me tell you
something fella It is University
policy which keeps those frats
discriminatory. Ask the people at
Alpha Sig who petitioned the
University to become a coed
fraternity outside the draw. They
were refused because of the
thirty-year old University policy
against allowing women any
housing outside the draw.
Let's face it: Stanford is not a
red-hot fraternity school. Most of
the men in frats would go coed in
a minute if it didn't mean losing
control over the membership of
the house, not to mention the old
sword of Damocles known as the
low draw number.
Draw Cut-Off
On the other hand, what gives
fraternity men the right to be out

of the draw, anyway? Well,
suppose those fraternity houses
didn't exist. Suppose no private
organization had ever come
forward with money to finance
new, if exclusive, housing. Where
would those 540 men be right
now? Well, they'd be in Wilbur
and Toyon and Roble and the
cut-off for the draw would be 540
lower.
Maybe fraternities are no
longer the answer. Maybe coed
living is far superior. Or simply
more equitable. In any event, I
question the thinking that holds
the only answer to be an
all-inclusive, all-leveling draw
system. I really wonder if the
solution lies in destroying the last
vestiges of independent housing
and pulling all those buildings into

The System.
But perhaps the frats are
terribly guilty. After all, they've
added to the housing shortage by
building nearly 30 buildings on
this campus, 12 of which have the
audacity to remain free of the
beloved draw. And they have
discriminated against women by
being refused permission to allow
them in and remain autonomous.
Prodded by the federal
government, let's destroy frats
and ignore the fact that it is the
University, not the frats, which
has failed to accommodate those
who need housing and has insisted
on enforcing an outdated,
sexually discriminate policy.
