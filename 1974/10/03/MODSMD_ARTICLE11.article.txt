In a Daily article on Sept. 25,
William Ross played down the
possibility of Pete McCloskey
losing his House seat to Santa Clara
Mayor Gary Gillmor in the
coming November election.
Unfortunately, it is precisely this
type of attitude that increases
Gillmor's chances of upsetting
McCloskey.
Although Ross quoted one of
Gillmor's campaign officials as
forecasting a McCloskey victory
of 10 percentage points, local
political experts at times
predicted a McCloskey victory by
a similar margin in last June's
primary. As was proved by the
fraction of a percentage point
McCloskey victory such forecasts
can often be inaccurate.
They are often wrong because
they are based upon an
assumption of a standard
campaign and do not take into
account unusual aspects. For

instance an enthusiastic volunteer
effort for a candidate can result in
him performing far better than
expected. Likewise an unusual
amount of voter apathy among his
supporters can result in an upset
for his opponent. If McCloskey
supporters are lulled into believing
that his election is certain an
upset is more than possible.
Stanford Effort Helped
It was only an extraordinary
effort by Stanford supporters last
June that allowed McCloskey to
finish ahead in that contest. The
indifference that is present now
among many of his followers on
campus, and is being encouraged
by the general belief that,
"McCloskey Seems A Sure
Victor," will only make the
possibility that Gillmor not
McCloskey will go to Washington
in January more likely.
Ross stated in the article that
the GiUmor challenge is mild

compared to others fazed by
McCloskey in the past This is
saying very little w.ien one
considers the nature of the
challenges that McCloskey has
overcome in the past, the most
recent being his narrow 800-vote
plurality over Atherton mllionaire
Gordon Knapp in last June's
primary. The Gillmor challenge is
a very real one and refusing to
consider it as such will only make
it more so.
It will take a concerted effort
by Stanford students to insure
that a man of McCloskey's
integrity and courage can
continue to serve in the political
spectrum. McCloskey supporters
should not be lulled into a false
sense of security, and should
come the fore and aid in his
reelection.

In a Daily article on Sept. 25,
William Ross played down the
possibility of Pete McCloskey
losing his House seat to Santa Clara
Mayor Gary Gillmor in the
coming November election.
Unfortunately, it is precisely this
type of attitude that increases
Gillmor's chances of upsetting
McCloskey.
Although Ross quoted one of
Gillmor's campaign officials as
forecasting a McCloskey victory
of 10 percentage points, local
political experts at times
predicted a McCloskey victory by
a similar margin in last June's
primary. As was proved by the
fraction of a percentage point
McCloskey victory such forecasts
can often be inaccurate.
They are often wrong because
they are based upon an
assumption of a standard
campaign and do not take into
account unusual aspects. For

instance an enthusiastic volunteer
effort for a candidate can result in
him performing far better than
expected. Likewise an unusual
amount of voter apathy among his
supporters can result in an upset
for his opponent. If McCloskey
supporters are lulled into believing
that his election is certain an
upset is more than possible.
Stanford Effort Helped
It was only an extraordinary
effort by Stanford supporters last
June that allowed McCloskey to
finish ahead in that contest. The
indifference that is present now
among many of his followers on
campus, and is being encouraged
by the general belief that,
"McCloskey Seems A Sure
Victor," will only make the
possibility that Gillmor not
McCloskey will go to Washington
in January more likely.
Ross stated in the article that
the GiUmor challenge is mild

compared to others fazed by
McCloskey in the past This is
saying very little w.ien one
considers the nature of the
challenges that McCloskey has
overcome in the past, the most
recent being his narrow 800-vote
plurality over Atherton mllionaire
Gordon Knapp in last June's
primary. The Gillmor challenge is
a very real one and refusing to
consider it as such will only make
it more so.
It will take a concerted effort
by Stanford students to insure
that a man of McCloskey's
integrity and courage can
continue to serve in the political
spectrum. McCloskey supporters
should not be lulled into a false
sense of security, and should
come the fore and aid in his
reelection.
