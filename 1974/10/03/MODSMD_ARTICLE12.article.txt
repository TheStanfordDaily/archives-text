# FCC And TV Ads

If it weren't that the people of
this country, especially the
low-money people, were being
robbed, the irony of the power
elite's current screams about
inflation could be amusing.
If inflation stems from
excessive consumer demand, at
least in part, and demand is
artificially stimulated by
advertising, why don't the
corporations limit their
advertising?
They don't, of course, because
they don't want to lose money.
They would prefer to advertise all
the deodorants, etc., all the things
we don't need, until the whole
country goes bust, rather than
lose their corporation's share of
the market. Who volunteers for a
suicide mission?
Yet in the army the rosters for
suicide missions are somehow
filled out. Wasn't it Abraham
Lincoln who said that government
should do for people what people
can't do for themselves?
The Federal Communications
Commission has the statutory
authority to limit the minutes of
commercials per hour on radio
and television. It has not yet
directly exercised this power, but
the legal basis is there. The
Commission could limit the
amount of advertising in
broadcasting by the stroke of its
collective pen.
Powerful Ads
Television advertising is
powerful. To test it's power,
McCann-Erikson once withdrew
the advertising of one of its
clients, Johnson's Wax, from the
upstate New York airwaves for a
limited period. Sales declined
more than 30 percent.
The special effects of television
advertising have even been
conceded by the National
Association of Broadcasters, at
least in part. That Association has
recently adopted guidelines for
less advertising during hours of
children's programming.
Of course, such an FCC action
would be bad for business, at least
some businesses. We might not sell
as much toothpaste, laundry soap,
and plastic toys. But if inflation
declined as a result, we might be
able to lower interest rates in
response, thus lossening up capital
and giving the consumer a chance
to buy a house again.
Limit Drilling
Why shouldn't the consumer,
whose real income has been
declining for some time, create a
shortage of his own? Why
shouldn't we limit the drilling of a
precious national resource, the
airwaves?
There is a pretty good
correlation between the
prime-time television advertiser
and membership on Fortune's list
of the top 500 corporations.
These corporations, however, are
less vulnerable to the constraints
of fiscal and monetary policy, as
John Kenneth Galbraith has
lucidly explained in Economics
and the Public Purpose.
Balanced control of monetary,
fiscal, and informational policy
could provide a more equitable
way of putting brakes on the
economy. Why should so many
major corporations' profits soar
when so many little people go
into bankruptcy?
The answer, of course, at least
according to the cynic, who seems
to be right more often lately, is
that the system is out of the
people's control. The major
corporations who are now doing
relatively well compared to the
rest of us, who monopolize the
airwaves on prime time, also own
the politicians and control the
public relations machine that
keeps all too many of us
hypnotized.
Viable Method
But here is a solution that just
might prove the cynics wrong, if
anyone is still unpacified enough
to care. Here is an act through
legal channels, through the
democratic process (trumpets and
flags in the background please!),
that could work.
And it wouldn't hurt
broadcasters. Like the utility
companies, or the oil companies,
or the ghetto store, they're a
monopoly. If the entire industry
were controlled, broadcasters
could simply raise their rates just
like all the others do when there's
a shortage. Competition from
other media might be cited as a
problem, but who can believe that
national advertisers would
abandon TV and radio for
magazines or newspapers? Or if
they did, what's wrong with
having the newspapers on our
side?
And who can deny that
television would be more
enjoyable without so many of
those damn commercials, anyway.
