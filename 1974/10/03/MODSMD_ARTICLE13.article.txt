There's a highly used, exclusive
place for lunch on the Stanford
campus, although it may be
locatod in a rather out of the way
place — a rolling hillside on
Arastradero Road.
But once you gain access to the
lunch area, you can get food on
credit, a monthly statement, and
half-pints of orange juice for a
mere 15 cents among the benefits.
The place for 15 cent orange

juice and other goodies is the
Prancing Pony.
Fancy Vending
The Prancing Pony is nothing
more than a fancy name for a
computerized vending machine
located in the Artifical
Intelligence Laboratory at 1550
Arastradero Road, a corner of the
campus that most people have
forgotten.
The vending machine was just a
standard one until Les Earnest,

the lab's associate director,
decided to hook it up to the
laboratory computer. With some
help in programming from
business manager Jerry Jobe and
in the actual hookup from
research engineer Ted Panofsky,
the first computer-operated
vending machine became a reality.
It might evolve into the
Automat of the future, although
the current program is
"impractical" for widespread use
now, according to Earnest.
The current operation was
designed to specifically meet the
needs of the Artificial Intelligence
Lab, which has had trouble
getting food from the University
and vending machine operators
because of the lab's isolated
location, Earnest explained.
Better Food
The computer was connected
for about $100, he said, and a
monthly fee is paid just to rent
the vending machine, enabling the
laboratory to stock it with better
quality food.
"Vending machine food is
terrible," Earnest said between
swigs of 15 cent orange juice, "so
we do our own stocking." The
popularity of the new setup
makes restocking necessary four
or five times a week, he added.
It looks like a normal vending
machine, although prices are
lower, with a humming teletype
machine next to it.
There are only a few catches to
prevent just anyone from using the
Prancing Pony as a snack bar.
First, to have access to the
computer vending machine, you
must be a programmer with
initials and a secret password as
well. Anybody can get coffee,
donuts and other snacks not in
the vending machine, but to get
sandwiches, cheap orange juice,
and a monthly bill, you need
access to the lab computer and

the proper password.
Now that word of the
computerized vending machine
has leaked out, Earnest has
received calls from national
vending machine companies
wanting to know more about the
way it works.
Although not yet feasible for
large-seal*' use, the computer
vending machine is easily the most
popular one on the Stanford
campus, and monthly bills have
cut down on money lost in the

snack area.
Automatically the first of each
month lab employees receive a
bill from the computer for all
purchases from the vending
machine, other snacks (coffee,
tea, donuts, etc.), copy machine
use and the sauna. Yes, the
Artificial Intelligence Lab has a
sauna.
"We're also trying to get beer,"
Earnest said, crediting another
half-pint of orange juice to his
account.

has leaked out, Earnest has
received calls from national
vending machine companies
wanting to know more about the

vending machine is easily the most

MACHINE'S MENTOR—Les Earnest, associate director of the
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is the man who originated the idea
of linking a computer to a vending machine, thereby allowing AI
workers to order food and get billed monthly.
There's a highly used, exclusive
place for lunch on the Stanford
campus, although it may be
locatod in a rather out of the way
place — a rolling hillside on
Arastradero Road.
But once you gain access to the
lunch area, you can get food on
credit, a monthly statement, and
half-pints of orange juice for a
mere 15 cents among the benefits.
The place for 15 cent orange

juice and other goodies is the
Prancing Pony.
Fancy Vending
The Prancing Pony is nothing
more than a fancy name for a
computerized vending machine
located in the Artifical
Intelligence Laboratory at 1550
Arastradero Road, a corner of the
campus that most people have
forgotten.
The vending machine was just a
standard one until Les Earnest,

the lab's associate director,
decided to hook it up to the
laboratory computer. With some
help in programming from
business manager Jerry Jobe and
in the actual hookup from
research engineer Ted Panofsky,
the first computer-operated
vending machine became a reality.
It might evolve into the
Automat of the future, although
the current program is
"impractical" for widespread use
now, according to Earnest.
The current operation was
designed to specifically meet the
needs of the Artificial Intelligence
Lab, which has had trouble
getting food from the University
and vending machine operators
because of the lab's isolated
location, Earnest explained.
Better Food
The computer was connected
for about $100, he said, and a
monthly fee is paid just to rent
the vending machine, enabling the
laboratory to stock it with better
quality food.
"Vending machine food is
terrible," Earnest said between
swigs of 15 cent orange juice, "so
we do our own stocking." The
popularity of the new setup
makes restocking necessary four
or five times a week, he added.
It looks like a normal vending
machine, although prices are
lower, with a humming teletype
machine next to it.
There are only a few catches to
prevent just anyone from using the
Prancing Pony as a snack bar.
First, to have access to the
computer vending machine, you
must be a programmer with
initials and a secret password as
well. Anybody can get coffee,
donuts and other snacks not in
