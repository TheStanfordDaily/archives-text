Are the aluminum beer and soda cans left in the stadium after football
games recycled? —T.O.
Unfortunately the answer is no. That's pretty appalling too upon
seeing all the glittering aluminum underneath the stadium benches
after the hordes have gone home.
Terra House used to recycle the cans, operation manager Peter GL
Kmetovic said, but no one has done it for the past two years.
He added that the clean-up crew has "a tough enough time getting
the place picked up for the next football game as it is." He did say,
however, if any group wanted to recycle the cans he would willingly
comply.
The reason Terra House stopped recycling the stadium's cans is
that the members of the house felt "it wasn't worth the trouble"
according to John Backes, Terra's house manager.
One member of the house said some engineers did a study a few
years ago discovering that it took more energy to reprocess the metal
of aluminum cans than was worthwhile ecologically.
She also remarked that the Stanford Conservation Group is
considering starting up their recycling operations once again. They
may take care of the cans in the stadium.
By the way, Backes said the Terra House members recycle their
own cans at the Palo Alto Recycling Center. They might be willing to
recycle yours too, if you brought the cans to the house in the Cowell
Cluster.

Could someone persuade the police to ticket cars parked in the no
parking zone between Meyer and the Main Library? That's a major
bike route and the cars do a good job of blocking it. Also, why don't
the police give tickets to those individuals who park at the wrong
angle in parking stalls? —M.T.
No sooner said than done (or at least looked into), according to
Marvin L. Herrington, director of the Stanford Police Department. He
agreed "that's very definitely not to be parked in." That driveway is
intended for emergency vehicles.
Herrington said he realizes the infractions of parking regulations on
campus are pretty rampant but Ins four community service operators
are doing all they can to give out citations for blaring violations.
First priority are red zones and no parking zones so sometimes the
officers can't get to the cars parked crookedly.
Herrington said the police give out 2000 citations a month and
14-15,000 a year but the $2.00 fine for minor parking infractions
doesn't seem to convince anybody. He said the court judges decide •
the fines, not the police.
If we keep bugging the police, Bug has a feeling there will be fewer
bugged bicyclists after a while, however.
