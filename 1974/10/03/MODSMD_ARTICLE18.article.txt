## The 						World Cinema 'Juggernaut' Brings Back Excitement 
### George Powell 
"They don't make movies like they used
to," was a standard cry of moviegoers and
critics alike as film revenues declined in the
late 1960s and early 19705. But now things
seem on the upswing in movieland for both
audiences and critics alike, with a film like
Juggernaut the most recent example of a
new trend that puts adventure and
entertainment back in films.
That's not to say excitement and fun ever
completely left the movies, but fascination
with a formula, whether it was "youth" or
"mammoth musicals" nearly forced the
industry into receivership in frenetic attempt
to find a profitable share of the
entertainment dollars.
Juggernaut is a symbol of everything
that's good in the movie industry of 1974, a
vivid demonstration of how intelligent
casting and careful pacing can wonders for an
essentially well-used formula. Credit for
putting together such a satisfying package
must go to director Richard Lester, who has
followed his box office success of "The
Three Musketeers" with something that
should do equally as well.
Juggernaut does what all movies about
disaster of potential disaster (man-made or
natural) do, placing an all-star cast in a
constricted area that's fraught with danger.
The area in this case is a cruise ship, the
Britannic, which has become the target of a
diabolical bomber, Juggernaut.
With seven nearly tamper-proof explosive

devices placed aboard the ship, Juggernaut
demands 500,000 pounds as a price for
telling how to defuse the devices. Otherwise,
they will explode, sink the ship and kill the
1200 passengers and crew.
Sure, it sounds pretty trite, but when
Richard Harris as the hard drinking head of
the bomb disposal squad heads an impeccable
cast that includes Omar Sharif, David
Hemmings, Shirley Knight and Anthony
Hopkins (the doctor in the six-hour TV
movie QB VII) the potential is there to
overcome the triteness.
Harris has to make the eccentric head of
the bomb squad seem human while almost
machine-like at taking bombs apart. By
adding a dash of gallows humor and some
very brief monologues about the human
condition, Harris succeeds admirably in a
tricky role, giving his most balanced
performance since The Molly Maguires.
Sharif is fine as the playboy captain,
Hemmings nearly and properly fades into the
background as Harris' chief assistant, Knight
brings conviction to her role as a woman
emotionally adrift and Hopkins conveys the
proper inner tension as the Scotland Yard
inspector whose wife happens to be aboard
the ship.
Lester keeps the action moving at just the
right pace to give the actors a chance to flesh
out their roles, although windy dialogue
about the human condition is kept to a
minimum. In contrast to The Poseidon

Adventure which featured Gene Hackman as
a hip priest declaiming and philosophizing
through the disaster, in Juggernaut Harris and
other characters accomplish more in a glance
or a gesture.
The camera aids Lester in the gradual
buildup of concern for the people involved
with finding Juggernaut and defusing the
bombs by getting only as close as is necessary
for the story, heightening the suspense of the
defusing process by extreme closeups of the
bomb's deadly interior and the delicate steps
involved in rendering it harmless.
As a movie, Juggernaut is about as delicate
as one of the bombs, and just as craftil
designed. One false step and the whole
structure would collapse under the weight of
its heavily used plot. But thanks to the deft
Lester touch. Juggernaut neither the
ponderousness of Airport nor the corny
melodrama of The Poseidon Adventure.
Instead, Lester has set high standards for
the disaster movies still to come in 1974
With enough money to pay all-star casts and
to simulate earthquakes aad high rise fires,
the movie industry has hopes of making
disaster into a box office bonanza. However,
without the care showed by Lester and
company in Juggernaut future attempts to
refurbish this old standby plot may only be a
disaster in one place — at the box office.
"Juggernaut," rated PG, is currently
playing at the Palo Alto Square 11.
