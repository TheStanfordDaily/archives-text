# D.C. Offers Interns Political Experience
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
While enjoying the sights, sounds
and excitement of being in Washington
D.C. during one of its most eventful
summers, Stanford-in-Washington
interns were also learning that there's
more to government than camera
lights and front page stories.
Behind the scenes, Helen Hung,
who worked for Sen. Roman Hruska
(R-Neb.) said, "there is a lot of
detailed background research and
tedious work" to do—much of it
clerical. Less fortunate interns found
themselves running errands, filing,
sending out form letters or answering
telephones.
The Stanford name, however,
seemed to carry a lot of prestige in
Washington, and interns from here
generally "did much better than
average," said Mike Lopez, summer
chairman of the internship program.
Many interns researched
background material for various bills,
some becoming the office "experts"
on issues ranging from strip mining to
labor laws. An intern doing research
might suddenly find himself loaded
down with all the pertinent
information and letters in the office.
Work Varied
The amount and kind of work
interns did varied from office to
office, and also from a representative's
office to a senator's office. Because a
representative's office was smaller, an
intern there often did more and saw
more than did his fellows in a senator's
office.
But interns in both types of offices
were given substantial responsibility
and were accepted as regular staffers,
doing so much that "we sometimes
wondered how they did without us,"
remarked Lisa Weinberg, who worked
for Rep. Paul N. McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park).
Working closely with senators and
congressmen gave the interns new
insights into the nature of the
government. Often, noted Hung, "the
real legislative action was done by the
staff," and the senator or congressman
functioned as more of a "figurehead,"
reading speeches or giving reports that
were researched and written for him.
Nevertheless, said Barbara Bauman, an
intern for Sen. Gunn McKay (D-Utah).
"the congressman does set the tone of
the office."
For the interns with less inspiring
jobs, Washington proved to be a
consolation. "It's a fun city for young
people," said Luzann Fernandez, who
worked for Sen. John Tunney
(D-Calif.).
The sense of being "where
everything was happening" was also
important to many interns. "You feel
like you have your finger on the pulse
[of the nation]," said Bauman.

"This may sound corny," said
Weinberg, "but I really felt a sense of
history being made . . . usually history
seems so far away, but there 1 was
right in the middle of it."
Impeachment
Most of the interns took advantage
of their ideal situation to see for
themselves what was going on during
the impeachment hearings and ai'ter
Nixon's resignation, attending hearings
when they could, trying to be near the
center of action.
There was a more serious side to
the impeachment proceedings. Interns
had more work to do than in previous
years because there was more going
on: constituents' letters to answer,
meetings to attend, keeping up-to-date
on any amendments that came to a
vote.
The Stanford-in-Washington
program helps students find housing in
Washington, advises them about where
they have the greatest chances of being
accepted, and organizes a lobbying
group each spring to push the interests
of Stanford intems-to-be.

interns did varied from office to
office, and also from a representative's
office to a senator's office. Because a
representative's office was smaller, an
intern there often did more and saw
more than did his fellows in a senator's
office.
But interns in both types of offices
were given substantial responsibility
and were accepted as regular staffers,
doing so much that "we sometimes
wondered how they did without us,"
remarked Lisa Weinberg, who worked
for Rep. Paul N. McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park).
Working closely with senators and
congressmen gave the interns new
insights into the nature of the
government. Often, noted Hung, "the
real legislative action was done by the
staff," and the senator or congressman
functioned as more of a "figurehead,"
reading speeches or giving reports that
were researched and written for him.
Nevertheless, said Barbara Bauman, an
intern for Sen. Gunn McKay (D-Utah).
"the congressman does set the tone of
the office."
For the interns with less inspiring
jobs, Washington proved to be a
consolation. "It's a fun city for young
people," said Luzann Fernandez, who
worked for Sen. John Tunney
(D-Calif.).
The sense of being "where
everything was happening" was also
important to many interns. "You feel
like you have your finger on the pulse
[of the nation]," said Bauman.

"This may sound corny," said
Weinberg, "but I really felt a sense of
history being made . . . usually history
seems so far away, but there 1 was
right in the middle of it."
Impeachment
Most of the interns took advantage
of their ideal situation to see for
themselves what was going on during
the impeachment hearings and ai'ter
Nixon's resignation, attending hearings
when they could, trying to be near the
center of action.
There was a more serious side to
the impeachment proceedings. Interns
had more work to do than in previous
years because there was more going
on: constituents' letters to answer,
meetings to attend, keeping up-to-date
on any amendments that came to a
vote.
The Stanford-in-Washington
program helps students find housing in
Washington, advises them about where
they have the greatest chances of being
accepted, and organizes a lobbying
group each spring to push the interests
of Stanford intems-to-be.
While enjoying the sights, sounds
and excitement of being in Washington
D.C. during one of its most eventful
summers, Stanford-in-Washington
interns were also learning that there's
more to government than camera
lights and front page stories.
Behind the scenes, Helen Hung,
who worked for Sen. Roman Hruska
(R-Neb.) said, "there is a lot of
detailed background research and
tedious work" to do—much of it
clerical. Less fortunate interns found
themselves running errands, filing,
sending out form letters or answering
telephones.
The Stanford name, however,
seemed to carry a lot of prestige in
Washington, and interns from here
generally "did much better than
average," said Mike Lopez, summer
chairman of the internship program.
Many interns researched
background material for various bills,
some becoming the office "experts"
on issues ranging from strip mining to
labor laws. An intern doing research
might suddenly find himself loaded
down with all the pertinent
information and letters in the office.
Work Varied

interns did varied from office to

office to a senator's office. Because a
