Ford To Testify On Pardon
WASHINGTON - President Ford's
testimony before a house subcommittee on his
pardon for former President Richard M. Nixon
was set yesterday for next week. It will be
televised live next Thursday.
Sketchy historical records indicate Ford may
be only the second President to make such an
appearance. Abraham Lincoln testified before
the full House Judiciary Committee in 1862.
Ford has promised to answer personally 14
questions before the subcommittee. The
questions included whether former White House
chief of staff Alexander Haig Jr. initiated
negotiations before Nixon's Aug. 9 resignation,
what conditions and promises were made and
whether Ford had any evidence on Nixon's
mental or physical condition.
Harmer To Replace Reinecke
LOS ANGELES — Gov. Ronald Reagan said

yesterday he would appoint state Sen. John
Harmer as new lieutenant governor today to
replace Ed Reinecke, who stepped down shortly
before his perjury sentence in Washington, D.C.
Reagan made his intentions known in an
interview with the Los Angeles Times from his
home in suburban Pacific Palisades, where he is
resting after a barnstorming national Republican
speaking tour.
There had been speculation that Harmer, the
Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in
November, would be the choice, but Reagan's
office in Sacramento had declined to speculate
who Reagan's appointee would be. Reagan
spokesmen would only say the appointment
would be announced today at a news conference
in San Francisco with the appointee to be
present.
"I'd be hypocritical to appoint someone
other than Harmer; after all, I'm supporting him
for election to the office," Reagan told the
Times.
Reinecke sent a one-sentence resignation
letter to the Assembly and Senate one-half hour
before a judge read him his sentence in a
Washington courtroom.
He received an 18-month suspended jail
sentence. Reinecke was convicted of lying to a
U.S. Senate committee investigating an
International Telephone and Telegraph scandal
in 1972.
House Slashes Nixon Funds
WASHINGTON — The House voted
overwhelmingly last night to slash former
President Richard M. Nixon's expense money to
$200,000, but it rejected efforts to deny him
everything, even a pension.
Despite sometimes strongly worded
denunciations of the former president, the
House rejected 344 to 46 a cutoff of the
$55,000 pension.
Rep. Jerome R. Waldie, D-Calif., said his
measure would be the House's only chance to
register its verdict that Nixon's "service was not
honorable, not deserving of reward."
President Ford's $850,000 request for Nixon
had been chopped to $398,000 in committee,
and the additional cuts to $200,000 were
proposed by Rep. Joseph P. Addabbo, D-N.Y.
Sirica Narrows Cover-Up Panel
WASHINGTON — District Judge John J.
Sirica completed the first phase of his search for
an impartial jury in the Watergate cover-up trial
yesterday, while one of the defendants, John D.
Ehrlichman, claimed double jeopardy as ground

for dismissal of his case.
By the end of the trial's second day, Sirica
had narrowed several hundred prospective jurors
to 144 and was ready to start more detailed
questioning today.
Ehrlichman said the White House plumbers
case, in which he already stands convicted, is so
inextricably linked to the Watergate cover-up
that the separate accusations violate his
constitutional rights.
He said in a memorandum that as soon as
jury is chosen he will petition the court to
dismiss the Watergate charges of obstructing
justice and conspiring to obstruct.
The prosecution, meanwhile, disclosed that it
has linked one more person to the alleged
conspiracy.
Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski filed a
statement that as a result of newly discovered
evidence made known to the defendants on
Monday, another person had been named an
unindicted co-conspirator.
A source close to the case identified the
addition as Richard A. Moore, the former
special counsel to Nixon, whose resignation
from the White House was announced
yesterday.
Moore testified at the Senate Watergate
hearings that counsel John W. Dean told Nixon
the Watergate cover-up story at his urging after
Moore urged him to do so.
He was involved in some of the conversations
recorded by the White House and his testimony
probably will be used in connection with the
tapes.
Roeky's Nomination Postponed
WASHINGTON — Senate action on Nelson
A. Rockefeller's nomination to be vice president
was postponed yesterday until after the Nov. 5
elections.
Chairman Howard W. Canon, (D-Nev.)
announced the delay, saying it would be
impossible for the Senate Rules Committee to
submit its recommendation on the nomination
until Congress meets in a post-election session.
He told the Senate the postponement stems
from the inability of the Joint Committee on
Internal Revenue Taxation to report on
Rockefeller's tax returns and other financial
records cannot be completed before Oct. 18.
The Senate is scheduled to recess for the
elections on Oct. 11.
Ambassadorship Sales Denied
WASHINGTON — Former White House aide
Peter M. Flanigan denied under oath yesterday

that he offered ambassadorships in exchange for
contributions to former President Richard M.
Nixon's campaigns.
Flanigan's testimony to the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, which is considering his
nomination to be ambassador to Spain,
conflicted with that given House impeachment
investigators by Herbert Kalmbach, former
lawyer for Nixon.
Sen. J. W. Fulbright, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, did not indicate any
attempt to resolve the differences.
The charge of selling ambassadorships was
one of several raised before the committee by
Sen. Thomas F. Eagle ton (D-Mo.) who said
Flanigan is unfit to hold such a high post
because of his role in the ITT antitrust affair,
the ambassadorships allegation and his
reputation of being the White House go-between
for businessmen seeking favors.
Six White House Aides Resign
WASHINGTON - President Ford's chief
spokesman disclosed yesterday the resignations
of six holdover White House aides and said
others would be leaving soon.
But Press Secretary Ron Nessen said Ford
had set no deadline for aides of former President
Richard M. Nixon leaving the White House
payroll.
Heading the list of departures announced by
Nessep was Dr. John McLaughlin, a Jesuit priest
who emerged as one of Nixon's most outspoken
defenders.
Pirates Clinch Nl. East
PITTSBURGH — Manny Sanguilln's infield
single with one out in the 10th inning drove in
the winning run, gave Pittsburgh Pirates a 5-4
victory over the Chicago Cubs last night and the
National League East Division championship.
The victory eliminated the St. Louis
Cardinals from the division race. Pittsburgh
wound up l'/2 games ahead of the Cards, who
were rained out at Montreal.
That game would have been played
Thursday, only if the Bucs had lost Wednesday
night.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through this afternoon through
tomorrow except local low cloudiness or fog
night and morning. Little temperature change.
Low both nights in the 50s. High today and
tomorrow in the mid 60s to mid 70s. Westerly

to 144 and was ready to start more detailed
questioning today.
Ehrlichman said the White House plumbers
case, in which he already stands convicted, is so
inextricably linked to the Watergate cover-up
that the separate accusations violate his
constitutional rights.
He said in a memorandum that as soon as
jury is chosen he will petition the court to
dismiss the Watergate charges of obstructing
justice and conspiring to obstruct.
The prosecution, meanwhile, disclosed that it
has linked one more person to the alleged
conspiracy.
Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski filed a
statement that as a result of newly discovered
evidence made known to the defendants on
Monday, another person had been named an
unindicted co-conspirator.
A source close to the case identified the
addition as Richard A. Moore, the former
special counsel to Nixon, whose resignation
from the White House was announced
yesterday.
Moore testified at the Senate Watergate
hearings that counsel John W. Dean told Nixon
the Watergate cover-up story at his urging after
Moore urged him to do so.
He was involved in some of the conversations
recorded by the White House and his testimony
probably will be used in connection with the
tapes.
Roeky's Nomination Postponed
WASHINGTON — Senate action on Nelson
A. Rockefeller's nomination to be vice president
was postponed yesterday until after the Nov. 5
elections.
Chairman Howard W. Canon, (D-Nev.)
announced the delay, saying it would be
impossible for the Senate Rules Committee to
submit its recommendation on the nomination
until Congress meets in a post-election session.
He told the Senate the postponement stems
from the inability of the Joint Committee on
Internal Revenue Taxation to report on
Rockefeller's tax returns and other financial
records cannot be completed before Oct. 18.
The Senate is scheduled to recess for the
elections on Oct. 11.
Ambassadorship Sales Denied
WASHINGTON — Former White House aide
Peter M. Flanigan denied under oath yesterday

that he offered ambassadorships in exchange for
contributions to former President Richard M.
Nixon's campaigns.
Flanigan's testimony to the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, which is considering his
nomination to be ambassador to Spain,
conflicted with that given House impeachment
investigators by Herbert Kalmbach, former
lawyer for Nixon.
Sen. J. W. Fulbright, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, did not indicate any
attempt to resolve the differences.
The charge of selling ambassadorships was
one of several raised before the committee by
Sen. Thomas F. Eagle ton (D-Mo.) who said
Flanigan is unfit to hold such a high post
because of his role in the ITT antitrust affair,
the ambassadorships allegation and his
reputation of being the White House go-between
for businessmen seeking favors.
Six White House Aides Resign
WASHINGTON - President Ford's chief
spokesman disclosed yesterday the resignations
of six holdover White House aides and said
others would be leaving soon.
But Press Secretary Ron Nessen said Ford
had set no deadline for aides of former President
Richard M. Nixon leaving the White House
payroll.
Heading the list of departures announced by
Nessep was Dr. John McLaughlin, a Jesuit priest
who emerged as one of Nixon's most outspoken
defenders.
Pirates Clinch Nl. East
PITTSBURGH — Manny Sanguilln's infield
single with one out in the 10th inning drove in
the winning run, gave Pittsburgh Pirates a 5-4
victory over the Chicago Cubs last night and the
National League East Division championship.
The victory eliminated the St. Louis
Cardinals from the division race. Pittsburgh
wound up l'/2 games ahead of the Cards, who
were rained out at Montreal.
That game would have been played
Thursday, only if the Bucs had lost Wednesday
night.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through this afternoon through
tomorrow except local low cloudiness or fog
night and morning. Little temperature change.
Low both nights in the 50s. High today and
tomorrow in the mid 60s to mid 70s. Westerly
winds 10 to 20 mph.
Ford To Testify On Pardon
WASHINGTON - President Ford's
testimony before a house subcommittee on his
pardon for former President Richard M. Nixon
was set yesterday for next week. It will be
televised live next Thursday.
Sketchy historical records indicate Ford may
be only the second President to make such an
appearance. Abraham Lincoln testified before
the full House Judiciary Committee in 1862.
Ford has promised to answer personally 14
questions before the subcommittee. The
questions included whether former White House
chief of staff Alexander Haig Jr. initiated
negotiations before Nixon's Aug. 9 resignation,
what conditions and promises were made and
whether Ford had any evidence on Nixon's
mental or physical condition.
Harmer To Replace Reinecke
LOS ANGELES — Gov. Ronald Reagan said

yesterday he would appoint state Sen. John
Harmer as new lieutenant governor today to
replace Ed Reinecke, who stepped down shortly
before his perjury sentence in Washington, D.C.
Reagan made his intentions known in an
interview with the Los Angeles Times from his
home in suburban Pacific Palisades, where he is
resting after a barnstorming national Republican
speaking tour.
There had been speculation that Harmer, the
Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in
November, would be the choice, but Reagan's
office in Sacramento had declined to speculate
who Reagan's appointee would be. Reagan
spokesmen would only say the appointment
would be announced today at a news conference
in San Francisco with the appointee to be
present.
"I'd be hypocritical to appoint someone
other than Harmer; after all, I'm supporting him
for election to the office," Reagan told the
Times.
Reinecke sent a one-sentence resignation
letter to the Assembly and Senate one-half hour
before a judge read him his sentence in a
Washington courtroom.
He received an 18-month suspended jail
sentence. Reinecke was convicted of lying to a
U.S. Senate committee investigating an
International Telephone and Telegraph scandal
in 1972.
House Slashes Nixon Funds
WASHINGTON — The House voted
overwhelmingly last night to slash former
President Richard M. Nixon's expense money to
$200,000, but it rejected efforts to deny him
everything, even a pension.
Despite sometimes strongly worded
denunciations of the former president, the
House rejected 344 to 46 a cutoff of the
$55,000 pension.
Rep. Jerome R. Waldie, D-Calif., said his
measure would be the House's only chance to
register its verdict that Nixon's "service was not
honorable, not deserving of reward."
President Ford's $850,000 request for Nixon
had been chopped to $398,000 in committee,
and the additional cuts to $200,000 were
proposed by Rep. Joseph P. Addabbo, D-N.Y.
Sirica Narrows Cover-Up Panel
WASHINGTON — District Judge John J.
Sirica completed the first phase of his search for
an impartial jury in the Watergate cover-up trial
yesterday, while one of the defendants, John D.
Ehrlichman, claimed double jeopardy as ground

for dismissal of his case.
By the end of the trial's second day, Sirica
had narrowed several hundred prospective jurors
to 144 and was ready to start more detailed
questioning today.

PITTSBURGH — Manny Sanguilln's infield
single with one out in the 10th inning drove in
the winning run, gave Pittsburgh Pirates a 5-4
victory over the Chicago Cubs last night and the
National League East Division championship.
The victory eliminated the St. Louis
Cardinals from the division race. Pittsburgh
wound up l'/2 games ahead of the Cards, who
were rained out at Montreal.
That game would have been played
Thursday, only if the Bucs had lost Wednesday
night.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through this afternoon through
tomorrow except local low cloudiness or fog
night and morning. Little temperature change.
Low both nights in the 50s. High today and
tomorrow in the mid 60s to mid 70s. Westerly
winds 10 to 20 mph.
Ford To Testify On Pardon
WASHINGTON - President Ford's
testimony before a house subcommittee on his
pardon for former President Richard M. Nixon
was set yesterday for next week. It will be
televised live next Thursday.
Sketchy historical records indicate Ford may
be only the second President to make such an
appearance. Abraham Lincoln testified before
the full House Judiciary Committee in 1862.
Ford has promised to answer personally 14
questions before the subcommittee. The
questions included whether former White House
chief of staff Alexander Haig Jr. initiated
negotiations before Nixon's Aug. 9 resignation,
what conditions and promises were made and
whether Ford had any evidence on Nixon's
mental or physical condition.
Harmer To Replace Reinecke
LOS ANGELES — Gov. Ronald Reagan said

yesterday he would appoint state Sen. John
Harmer as new lieutenant governor today to
replace Ed Reinecke, who stepped down shortly
before his perjury sentence in Washington, D.C.
Reagan made his intentions known in an
interview with the Los Angeles Times from his
home in suburban Pacific Palisades, where he is
resting after a barnstorming national Republican
speaking tour.
There had been speculation that Harmer, the
Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in
November, would be the choice, but Reagan's
office in Sacramento had declined to speculate
who Reagan's appointee would be. Reagan
spokesmen would only say the appointment
would be announced today at a news conference
in San Francisco with the appointee to be
present.
"I'd be hypocritical to appoint someone
other than Harmer; after all, I'm supporting him
for election to the office," Reagan told the
Times.
Reinecke sent a one-sentence resignation
letter to the Assembly and Senate one-half hour
before a judge read him his sentence in a
Washington courtroom.
He received an 18-month suspended jail
sentence. Reinecke was convicted of lying to a
U.S. Senate committee investigating an
International Telephone and Telegraph scandal
in 1972.
House Slashes Nixon Funds
WASHINGTON — The House voted
overwhelmingly last night to slash former
President Richard M. Nixon's expense money to
$200,000, but it rejected efforts to deny him
everything, even a pension.
Despite sometimes strongly worded
denunciations of the former president, the
House rejected 344 to 46 a cutoff of the
$55,000 pension.
Rep. Jerome R. Waldie, D-Calif., said his
measure would be the House's only chance to
register its verdict that Nixon's "service was not
honorable, not deserving of reward."
President Ford's $850,000 request for Nixon
had been chopped to $398,000 in committee,
and the additional cuts to $200,000 were
proposed by Rep. Joseph P. Addabbo, D-N.Y.
Sirica Narrows Cover-Up Panel
WASHINGTON — District Judge John J.
Sirica completed the first phase of his search for
an impartial jury in the Watergate cover-up trial
yesterday, while one of the defendants, John D.
Ehrlichman, claimed double jeopardy as ground

for dismissal of his case.
By the end of the trial's second day, Sirica
had narrowed several hundred prospective jurors
to 144 and was ready to start more detailed
questioning today.
Ehrlichman said the White House plumbers
case, in which he already stands convicted, is so
inextricably linked to the Watergate cover-up
that the separate accusations violate his
constitutional rights.
He said in a memorandum that as soon as
jury is chosen he will petition the court to
dismiss the Watergate charges of obstructing
justice and conspiring to obstruct.
The prosecution, meanwhile, disclosed that it
has linked one more person to the alleged
conspiracy.
Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski filed a
statement that as a result of newly discovered
evidence made known to the defendants on
Monday, another person had been named an
unindicted co-conspirator.
A source close to the case identified the
addition as Richard A. Moore, the former
special counsel to Nixon, whose resignation
from the White House was announced
yesterday.
Moore testified at the Senate Watergate
hearings that counsel John W. Dean told Nixon
the Watergate cover-up story at his urging after
Moore urged him to do so.
He was involved in some of the conversations
recorded by the White House and his testimony
probably will be used in connection with the
tapes.
Roeky's Nomination Postponed
WASHINGTON — Senate action on Nelson
A. Rockefeller's nomination to be vice president
was postponed yesterday until after the Nov. 5
elections.
Chairman Howard W. Canon, (D-Nev.)
announced the delay, saying it would be
impossible for the Senate Rules Committee to
submit its recommendation on the nomination
until Congress meets in a post-election session.
He told the Senate the postponement stems
from the inability of the Joint Committee on
Internal Revenue Taxation to report on
Rockefeller's tax returns and other financial
records cannot be completed before Oct. 18.
The Senate is scheduled to recess for the
elections on Oct. 11.
Ambassadorship Sales Denied
WASHINGTON — Former White House aide
Peter M. Flanigan denied under oath yesterday

that he offered ambassadorships in exchange for
contributions to former President Richard M.
Nixon's campaigns.
Flanigan's testimony to the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, which is considering his
nomination to be ambassador to Spain,
conflicted with that given House impeachment
investigators by Herbert Kalmbach, former
lawyer for Nixon.
Sen. J. W. Fulbright, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, did not indicate any
attempt to resolve the differences.
The charge of selling ambassadorships was
one of several raised before the committee by
Sen. Thomas F. Eagle ton (D-Mo.) who said
Flanigan is unfit to hold such a high post
because of his role in the ITT antitrust affair,
the ambassadorships allegation and his
reputation of being the White House go-between
for businessmen seeking favors.
Six White House Aides Resign
WASHINGTON - President Ford's chief
spokesman disclosed yesterday the resignations
of six holdover White House aides and said
others would be leaving soon.
But Press Secretary Ron Nessen said Ford
had set no deadline for aides of former President
Richard M. Nixon leaving the White House
payroll.
Heading the list of departures announced by
Nessep was Dr. John McLaughlin, a Jesuit priest
who emerged as one of Nixon's most outspoken
defenders.

measure would be the House's only chance to
register its verdict that Nixon's "service was not
honorable, not deserving of reward."
President Ford's $850,000 request for Nixon
had been chopped to $398,000 in committee,
and the additional cuts to $200,000 were
proposed by Rep. Joseph P. Addabbo, D-N.Y.
Sirica Narrows Cover-Up Panel
WASHINGTON — District Judge John J.
Sirica completed the first phase of his search for
an impartial jury in the Watergate cover-up trial
yesterday, while one of the defendants, John D.
Ehrlichman, claimed double jeopardy as ground

for dismissal of his case.
By the end of the trial's second day, Sirica
had narrowed several hundred prospective jurors
to 144 and was ready to start more detailed
questioning today.
Ehrlichman said the White House plumbers
case, in which he already stands convicted, is so
inextricably linked to the Watergate cover-up
that the separate accusations violate his
constitutional rights.
He said in a memorandum that as soon as
jury is chosen he will petition the court to
dismiss the Watergate charges of obstructing
justice and conspiring to obstruct.
The prosecution, meanwhile, disclosed that it
has linked one more person to the alleged
conspiracy.
Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski filed a
statement that as a result of newly discovered
evidence made known to the defendants on
Monday, another person had been named an
unindicted co-conspirator.
A source close to the case identified the
addition as Richard A. Moore, the former
special counsel to Nixon, whose resignation
from the White House was announced
yesterday.
Moore testified at the Senate Watergate
hearings that counsel John W. Dean told Nixon
the Watergate cover-up story at his urging after
Moore urged him to do so.
He was involved in some of the conversations
recorded by the White House and his testimony
probably will be used in connection with the
tapes.
Roeky's Nomination Postponed
WASHINGTON — Senate action on Nelson
A. Rockefeller's nomination to be vice president
was postponed yesterday until after the Nov. 5
elections.
Chairman Howard W. Canon, (D-Nev.)
announced the delay, saying it would be
impossible for the Senate Rules Committee to
submit its recommendation on the nomination
until Congress meets in a post-election session.
He told the Senate the postponement stems
from the inability of the Joint Committee on
Internal Revenue Taxation to report on
Rockefeller's tax returns and other financial
records cannot be completed before Oct. 18.
The Senate is scheduled to recess for the
elections on Oct. 11.
Ambassadorship Sales Denied
WASHINGTON — Former White House aide
Peter M. Flanigan denied under oath yesterday

that he offered ambassadorships in exchange for
contributions to former President Richard M.
Nixon's campaigns.
Flanigan's testimony to the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, which is considering his
nomination to be ambassador to Spain,
conflicted with that given House impeachment
investigators by Herbert Kalmbach, former
lawyer for Nixon.
Sen. J. W. Fulbright, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, did not indicate any
attempt to resolve the differences.
The charge of selling ambassadorships was
one of several raised before the committee by
Sen. Thomas F. Eagle ton (D-Mo.) who said
Flanigan is unfit to hold such a high post
because of his role in the ITT antitrust affair,
the ambassadorships allegation and his
reputation of being the White House go-between
for businessmen seeking favors.
Six White House Aides Resign
WASHINGTON - President Ford's chief
spokesman disclosed yesterday the resignations
of six holdover White House aides and said
others would be leaving soon.
But Press Secretary Ron Nessen said Ford
had set no deadline for aides of former President
Richard M. Nixon leaving the White House
payroll.
Heading the list of departures announced by
Nessep was Dr. John McLaughlin, a Jesuit priest
who emerged as one of Nixon's most outspoken
defenders.
Pirates Clinch Nl. East
PITTSBURGH — Manny Sanguilln's infield
single with one out in the 10th inning drove in
the winning run, gave Pittsburgh Pirates a 5-4
victory over the Chicago Cubs last night and the
National League East Division championship.
The victory eliminated the St. Louis
Cardinals from the division race. Pittsburgh
wound up l'/2 games ahead of the Cards, who
were rained out at Montreal.
That game would have been played
Thursday, only if the Bucs had lost Wednesday
night.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through this afternoon through
tomorrow except local low cloudiness or fog
night and morning. Little temperature change.
Low both nights in the 50s. High today and
tomorrow in the mid 60s to mid 70s. Westerly
winds 10 to 20 mph.
Ford To Testify On Pardon
WASHINGTON - President Ford's
testimony before a house subcommittee on his
pardon for former President Richard M. Nixon
was set yesterday for next week. It will be
televised live next Thursday.
Sketchy historical records indicate Ford may
be only the second President to make such an
appearance. Abraham Lincoln testified before
the full House Judiciary Committee in 1862.
Ford has promised to answer personally 14
questions before the subcommittee. The
questions included whether former White House
chief of staff Alexander Haig Jr. initiated
negotiations before Nixon's Aug. 9 resignation,
what conditions and promises were made and
whether Ford had any evidence on Nixon's
mental or physical condition.
Harmer To Replace Reinecke
LOS ANGELES — Gov. Ronald Reagan said

yesterday he would appoint state Sen. John
Harmer as new lieutenant governor today to
replace Ed Reinecke, who stepped down shortly
before his perjury sentence in Washington, D.C.
Reagan made his intentions known in an
interview with the Los Angeles Times from his
home in suburban Pacific Palisades, where he is
resting after a barnstorming national Republican
speaking tour.
There had been speculation that Harmer, the
Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in
November, would be the choice, but Reagan's
office in Sacramento had declined to speculate
who Reagan's appointee would be. Reagan
spokesmen would only say the appointment
would be announced today at a news conference
in San Francisco with the appointee to be
present.
"I'd be hypocritical to appoint someone
other than Harmer; after all, I'm supporting him
for election to the office," Reagan told the
Times.
Reinecke sent a one-sentence resignation
letter to the Assembly and Senate one-half hour
before a judge read him his sentence in a
Washington courtroom.
He received an 18-month suspended jail
sentence. Reinecke was convicted of lying to a
U.S. Senate committee investigating an
International Telephone and Telegraph scandal
in 1972.
House Slashes Nixon Funds
WASHINGTON — The House voted
overwhelmingly last night to slash former
President Richard M. Nixon's expense money to
$200,000, but it rejected efforts to deny him
everything, even a pension.
Despite sometimes strongly worded
denunciations of the former president, the
House rejected 344 to 46 a cutoff of the
$55,000 pension.
Rep. Jerome R. Waldie, D-Calif., said his
measure would be the House's only chance to
register its verdict that Nixon's "service was not
honorable, not deserving of reward."
President Ford's $850,000 request for Nixon
