Moot Court Competition
Four law students will compete for
a place in the National Moot Court
Competition in a qualifying-round
contest to be held in Room 163E of
the law school tonight at 7:30.
The students will argue the
hypothetical case of Howard Lincoln,
a qualified black student who is
rejected by predominately-black
Sweetwater College in favor of a less
qualified white student who will fill
the school's quota of whites.
The proceedings will be open to the
public; no admission will be charged.
