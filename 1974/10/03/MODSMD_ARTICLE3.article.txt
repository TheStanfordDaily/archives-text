# P.A. City Council Members Speak Out
## Drug Center Sale Stirs Anger 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Palo Alto City Council's decision to sell Unity
House, the city's residential drug treatment center, has
angered several Council members.
"I'm disappointed by the center's closing," Councilman
Kirke Comstock told the Daily. "We've had testimony in
the past from experts who have made convincing
statements that residential treatment centers can be
effective."
But Councilman John Beahrs declared yesterday that
"most authorities agree that no center has been
spectacularly successful and most don't do much good at
all."
The Council, in a 5-2 vote Tuesday morning, not only
voted to sell Unity House but also to abandon all plans for
establishing any other residential drug treatment centers.
Two avowed supporters of maintaining a center were absent
at the time of the vote.
House Ineffective
All Couih • members agreed thai in its old form Unity
House- which closed in March amid charges oi
mismanagement—was ineffective.
Councilwoman Enid Pearson, an opponent ot Unity
House's sale, noted that the center's lack of a hierarchial
management structure was the main reason for its failure.
"t lit.y House or t* i on collectivism"everyone voted
in its decisions, in ud ng «he poopl; > .'ig treated, she
said. "There nas to oe strict discipline if sU - systen
going to work."
Comstock admitted that "the people who were in charge
of Unity House didn't have the wherewithal to maintain the
program, but that doesn't mean that all centers must fail."
Pearson said she was especially upset that the Council
didn't even examine the proposals for new residential
treatment centers submitted at its own request by
Miramonte Mental Health Services and Narcanon.
Cora Autor, administrative assistant to Narcanon, a
nonprofit anti-drug organization, said yesterday that
"residential drug treatments do work and the Council
shouldn't throw up its hands just because they feel a sense
of failed purpose."
Autor said that Narcanon had requested $59,000 to
operate a center for one year. Narcanon will now attempt
to raise the money through private donations, she said.
Although Beahrs complained about the expense of
maintaining residential treatment centers. Councilman Alan

Henderson told the Daily that the program is relatively
inexpensive.
"The house itself cost $90,000, but it is an asset that has
gone up in value," Henderson said. "As for the program, it
was allocated $100,000 a year, but spent considerably less
than $150,000 altogether during its two years in
operation."
Pearson described the cost of the program as "peanuts"
in the city's $37 million annual budget.
"Several Council members are inherently opposed to any
drug abuse concerns," Pearson said. "They want to leave it
to other governments but the responsibility is at the local
level. That is where people are most accessible and where
the most effective work can be done."
But Beahrs said that the city couldn't possibly afford to
spend the large sums of money necessary for any successful
program and added that the responsibility should rest with
the state and federal governments.
Pearson noted that a recent report of the John F.
Kennedy Institute commissioned by the Council showed
that the incidence of drug abuse in Palo Alto is already high
and is growing.
'Definite Need'
Henderson said that the "survey people" at the Institute
"did an objective survey and concluded that there is a
definite need i'or such a program, but agreed it should be
stn-ctured with ahi jrchy."
i'iie fact that u.. problem is quiet,-people aren't lying
in the streets—means that the problem is surreptitious and
some people ignore it," Pearson said.
"I don't agree with [Beahrs'J contention that the
residential treatment center was a rip off," Pearson
continued. "I know for a fact that some people were helped
and any time even if only one person was helped, it wasn't
a rip off."
But Beahrs said that any drug abuse center sponsored by
the city would be unworkable because "drug abusers
aren't too disciplined. They don't need to be coddled but
strengthened."
Most Council members agreed that there is little chance
that they will consider any more proposals for another
residential program.
But Pearson said that if a unified proposal were
presented to the council together with strong community
support and reasonable proof of the program's viability,
such a program might yet be accepted.
