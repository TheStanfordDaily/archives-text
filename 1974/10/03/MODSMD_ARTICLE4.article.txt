# Stock Loss Alters Investment Plans
## 
### DON COX 
The continued decline of the stock
market has forced shifts in University
investment policy, business and
finance officials said yesterday.
Faced with a $2 million income loss
because of the falling security prices,
officials busy formulating the
University's 1974-75 operating budget
are attempting to minimize the impact
of the expected loss.
Vice Provost for Budget and
Planning Raymond Bacchetti said
University departments would be
asked to curtail hiring and reduce
expenditures. He said the University
"would very likely have to pledge
operating reserves" in order to meet
expenses.
"There isn't much of a way to
make educational programs more
efficient. Seminars are seminars, they
are essential and they can't be all
converted into lectures," he said.
Response
Deputy Vice-President Kenneth
Creighton said the University "is in the
process of determining how to respond
to the continued loss" of income. He
said officials are looking for other

sources of income available to
individual departments and schools.
Creighton said budget planners
must begin "tackling the budget base
and reducing it."
President Richard Lyman said on
KZSU's Campus Conference earlier
this week that "there have been shifts
[in investment policy] to take
advantage of short-term high interest
rates ... to keep income at as high a
level as possible."
Since 1968, the University has used
over $2 million annually from capital
appreciation on part of the
endowment to meet expenses. The
market value of the endowment
securities dropped below their
recorded value earlier this year,
however, with a corresponding loss of
income.
Creighton said that the University is
drawing up the 1974-75 budget
without drawing on capital
appreciation, if there is any. This
policy shift could be extended into
future years he said.
"We need to cut down on the
amount of income drawn on the
endowment principal," he said.
In come-Only Basis
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said earlier
this year, "if left to my
druthers ... I'd get pn an income-only
basis and not rely on appreciation for
program commitments."
Creighton also indicated that the
University may combine pools of
funds in the endowment in order to
have some investment balance.
Bacchetti said most educational
institutions similar to Stanford "have
pretty much the same problem.
"We're doing better than most, but
even Harvard can't behave with
financial impunity" as it might have in
the past. Harvard's endowment is close
to three times Stanford's $350 million
endowment," he said.
Gifts Suffer
In addition to the immediate
income problem caused by the falling
stock market, gifts to the University
have suffered also.
"Over the past five years, over 70
percent of gifts from living individuals
were in the form of appreciated
securities—that is, securities that were
worth more than when the donor
bought them," Lyman said.
Nobody has any appreciated
securities to give [now] and tax
benefits from giving appreciated
securities don\ exist," he adued.
"The amount of gifts is down even
though the number giving is greater
than ever before," he said.
Bacchetti said he was confident
that University departments would cut
expenses and minimize the income
problem. "They understand the
outside world and its financing
problems, and they care about
Stanford."
Stanford experienced a similar loss
of income because the low market
wiped out expected capital
appreciation during the 1973-74 fiscal
year.
Officials instituted budget saving
measures late in the sphng to keep the
unexpected loss to a minimum.

securities don\ exist," he adued.
"The amount of gifts is down even
though the number giving is greater
than ever before," he said.
Bacchetti said he was confident
that University departments would cut
expenses and minimize the income
problem. "They understand the
outside world and its financing
problems, and they care about
Stanford."
Stanford experienced a similar loss
of income because the low market
wiped out expected capital
appreciation during the 1973-74 fiscal
year.
Officials instituted budget saving
measures late in the sphng to keep the
unexpected loss to a minimum.
The continued decline of the stock
market has forced shifts in University
investment policy, business and
finance officials said yesterday.
Faced with a $2 million income loss
because of the falling security prices,
officials busy formulating the
University's 1974-75 operating budget
are attempting to minimize the impact
of the expected loss.
Vice Provost for Budget and
Planning Raymond Bacchetti said
University departments would be
asked to curtail hiring and reduce
expenditures. He said the University
"would very likely have to pledge
operating reserves" in order to meet
expenses.
"There isn't much of a way to
make educational programs more
efficient. Seminars are seminars, they
are essential and they can't be all
converted into lectures," he said.
Response
Deputy Vice-President Kenneth
Creighton said the University "is in the
process of determining how to respond
to the continued loss" of income. He
said officials are looking for other

sources of income available to
individual departments and schools.
Creighton said budget planners
must begin "tackling the budget base
and reducing it."
President Richard Lyman said on
KZSU's Campus Conference earlier
this week that "there have been shifts
[in investment policy] to take
advantage of short-term high interest
rates ... to keep income at as high a
level as possible."
Since 1968, the University has used
over $2 million annually from capital
appreciation on part of the
endowment to meet expenses. The
market value of the endowment
securities dropped below their
recorded value earlier this year,
however, with a corresponding loss of
income.
Creighton said that the University is
drawing up the 1974-75 budget
without drawing on capital
appreciation, if there is any. This
policy shift could be extended into
future years he said.
"We need to cut down on the
amount of income drawn on the
endowment principal," he said.
In come-Only Basis
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said earlier
this year, "if left to my
druthers ... I'd get pn an income-only
basis and not rely on appreciation for
program commitments."
Creighton also indicated that the
University may combine pools of
funds in the endowment in order to
have some investment balance.
Bacchetti said most educational
institutions similar to Stanford "have
pretty much the same problem.
"We're doing better than most, but
even Harvard can't behave with
financial impunity" as it might have in
the past. Harvard's endowment is close
to three times Stanford's $350 million
endowment," he said.
Gifts Suffer
In addition to the immediate
income problem caused by the falling
stock market, gifts to the University
have suffered also.
"Over the past five years, over 70
percent of gifts from living individuals
were in the form of appreciated
securities—that is, securities that were
worth more than when the donor
bought them," Lyman said.
Nobody has any appreciated
securities to give [now] and tax
benefits from giving appreciated
securities don\ exist," he adued.
"The amount of gifts is down even
though the number giving is greater
than ever before," he said.
