# ARLO Combines Idealism, Relevancy
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
Rhetoric about the isolation of academia
from The Real World —the one where Stanford's
granite arches give way to McDonald's golden
arches—has flowed fast and free ever since the
mid 1960's when the demand for relevancy in
higher education rattled hallowed halls across
the country.
At Stanford the demand was met in part by
the creation of special programs such as
Stanford Workshop on Social and Political
Issues (SWOPSI); Stanford Center for
Innovation in Research and Education (SCIRE);
Values, Technology and Society (VTS),and the
Program on Urban Studies.
However, many students found that even the
work done on social issues through these
programs often became as irrelevant as the work
done in more conventional courses', pollution
probes, wilderness surveys, and transportation
studies went unused by agencies and
government officials because students had no
idea who was interested in the research they
were doing.
At the same time, groups as diverse as the
Sierra Club, the American Friends Service
Committee, mental health organizations and
local governments needed the servicss of
students as researchers but had no way to pay
students and no way to give them academic
credit for their efforts.
Academic Credit
To combat the problem, ARLO, the Action
Research Liaison Office, was formed last spring.
ARLO provides students with connections to
community organizations which need help with
specific projects and then helps students arrange

to get academic credit for their work.
ARLO's new co-directors are Edith Eddy and
Susan Deborah, and they aren't so much
co-directors as they are two halves of one
director; the office has funding for only one
position which the two women share by job
pairing.
Their idea of sharing the position is part of a
national trend toward job pairing, but it caused
problems in the University's accounting office.
"They have no system for it," explained Eddy,
joking that "Susan and I have decided that we're
both half-volunteers."
Varied Fields
This quarter Eddy and Deborah have
compiled a catalogue of 31 projects focused on
particular problems within such broad fields as
public finance, taxation, mental health, peace
action, energy, homosexuality and conservation.
The common ground of all the projects is the
fact that they are sponsored by some
community group that needs student researchers
for a very specific project, often for a particular
length of time. For example, the Committee for
Green Foothills is sponsoring students doing an
environmental impact statement on a 62-acre
parcel of land which the Palo Alto Unified
School District has decided to sell for
development. The statement must be completed
by April 1975.
Of the 31 current projects, Deborah said that
"they're really ready," only needing students to
fill the openings. After, a student decides on a
project, Eddy and Deborah student
find a faculty member willing to grant credit for
the work.

leadership of ARLO, the Action Research Liasion Office. ARLO, established last spring, serves to
place interested students in social research projects with the option for academic credit. Thirty-one
community sponsored programs in varied fields have been compiled.
