# Grapes Of Wrath

VISALIA, Calif. — Numerous
books have been written
attempting to explain the
sociology of contemporary
California. But a book published
in 1939 also has a lot to say about
and to California in 1974.
It isn't pleasant recommending
John Steinbeck's The Grapes of
Wrath to people seeking an
understanding of the San Joaquin
Valley 35 years later. It isn't
pleasant because it describes
starvation amidst the greatest
agricultural plenty that the world
has ever known, and paints a
picture of fascism and feudalism
in twentieth-century California.
But the question "How much
has really changed?" is legitimate,
and the answer is complicated and
deeply troubling.
The farm labor strife that made
headlines in August, 1973 brought
the agricultural sociology of the
Valley into the news. The bitter
struggle between the agri-business
establishment and the United
Farm Workers led by Cesar
Chavez does not quietly disappear
as so many modern industrial
disputes do. Steinbeck offers
insights as to why it cannot.
Power Struggle
It is a struggle for power,
between those who have nearly all
the power and those who have
next to none. That is why "in the
little towns pity for the sodden
men changed to anger, and anger
at the hungry people changed to
fear of them. Then sheriffs swore
in deputies in droves, and orders
were rushed for rifles, for tear gas,
for ammunition."
Mercifully the large-scale
deputization of civilians is a thing
of the past. But squads of armed
farmers and a legal system that is
quick to come to their aid and
slow to condemn their excesses
aren't much different.
The questions of
labor-management law in which
the situation is often couched are
legitimate — sweetheart contracts,
jurisdictional strikes, secondary
boycotts, and so on.
But they have not been
resolved in the way that labor
disputes in other sectors of the
economy are handled. Federal and
state union recognition and
collective bargaining laws do not
apply to agriculture.
Sorry History
The sorry history of the
Central > Valley compels the
conclusion that it is because of
the "power struggle" framework
of the entire conflict, that these
laws have not been extended to
farmworkers.
When a major manufacturing
industry and a large industrial
union reach a compromise accord,
no one seriously suggests that
management will be destroyed or
that the economy will be ruined.
Management does not refuse to
give an inch on the ground that
the union will take a mile.
The agricultural labor situation
is more akin to the Deep South of
15 years ago, where any
improvement in the lot of black
citizens was resisted by many
whites who feared that "if we give
them an inch, they'll take a mile."
Many Southern whites of
moderate persuasion supported
extremists because they felt it was
necessary to maintain a solid
front.

how desirable?
"Only means to destroy revolt
were considered, while the causes
of revolt went on." That could be
lifted out of the 1969 Kerner
Commission Report. In fact, it
comes from Chapter 19 of The
Grapes of Wrath. And it describes
the mass arrests of farmworker
pickets in 1973. To the degree
that it is an exaggeration, it serves
only to emphasize the underlying
truth.
Hopefully, the
"Establishment" has become
more enlightened in its views of
social problems since the Great
Depression. The terrible
experiences of that era
undoubtedly played a part in
moving the hearts of some people
who wield power.
But the lesson of the
continuing farmworker struggle is
that California has not moved
nearly far enough.
Scientists Praised
Steinbeck praised the men of
science at major universities who
have made possible modern,
scientific farming. His lament was
that a state which was capable of
so many technological wonders
could not or would not create a
decent and humane social system.
Since 1937, great strides have
been made in the science of
agriculture. But that scientific
progress is still far ahead of the
sociology of the San Joaquin
Valley.
The events of the past four
decades do not suggest that
Steinbeck's analysis is now an
anachronism. Rather, they are
explained by his theories and they
lend credence to those theories.
Steinbeck left the Joad family
in a miserable, rain-soaked barn in
central Tulare County. He left the
hundreds of thousands of migrant
workers with their fear turning to
wrath. It is the same wrath that
has boiled up in the souls of their
successors as laborers in the fields.
Yet today, "the grapes of
wrath are filling and growing
heavy, growing heavy for the
vintage."
