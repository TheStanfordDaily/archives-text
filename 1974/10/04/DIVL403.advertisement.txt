Lines are tedious, frustrating, and as
inevitable as death and taxes. But we've
got some good news for you: They can
move very fast. Especially when the
people serving you have their act together.
At the Coffee House, you've always been
able to get a good, made-to-order sand
wich, pastries, and the coffee drink of your
choice. But you've sometimes been driven
to distraction waiting for it. No more. Now
we make you this promise: a maximum
wait, from end of the line to cash register,
10 minutes. Time us. If we break our
promise, give the attached note to the
cashier.
