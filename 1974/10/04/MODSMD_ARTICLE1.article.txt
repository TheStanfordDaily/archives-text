# Horton, Housing Issue Make The Rounds At Frats
## 
### BONNY RODDEN MARK SIMONIAN 
Berated last spring by students facing "rounds one and
two" of the housing draw, Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry N. Horton has begun this school year facing different
"rounds"— the rounds of a verbal boxing match.
For the past two weeks, Horton has fielded questions,
challenges and criticisms at fraternity houses in an attempt
to thrash out various proposals the University could adopt
to obey a federal law prohibiting discrimination on the
basis of sex.
Horton explained last night at Alpha Sigma Phi that the
housing "status quo is in violation of the law" because the
system does not provide equal housing accomodations for
both sexes.
The University's problem housing area is the fraternity—
the all-male, basically independent house which exists
outside of the draw.
Two Options
Horton made it clear again last night that the fraternity
system cannot remain as it is and he outlined two options
for compliance with the law's specifics.
The University can establish multi-categorical housing
under one system, specifically the draw system, Horton
explained. Or the University can set up two or more

residential systems, he added.
Many fraternity men have expressed fears that Horton
has already decided the fate of the fraternities, bringing
them into the draw. Fraternity spokesmen, like
Inter-Fraternity Council President Mike Nilsson, contend
that assimilating the frats will be tantamount to destroying
them.
Attracts Crowds
Horton's appearances have attracted attention—and
crowds. More than 60 people jammed into Theta Delta Chi
Wednesday night to watch and listen to Horton battle
fraternity representatives in what Horton has dubbed his
"road shows."
Many of the discussions have been heated and bitter. A
number of fraternity members have calmly brought
alternative proposals to Horton's attention, however.
One student asked Horton if it would be possible to
make fraternities co-ed.
Horton responded, "If fraternities went co-ed, we would
have to re-examine those houses in the draw system which
have consistently been denied exemption from the draw.
Bearing The Burden
"If those houses were suddenly exempted from the
draw, then all desirable houses would have enormous
special privileges while people living in Wilbur and Stern

would bear most of the burden," Horton added.
The precedent against independent co-ed fraternities
began with Alpha Sig. Originally an all-male draw-exempt
frat, Alpha Sig was forced into the draw when it began
admitting women.
Earlier this year, Alpha Sig petitioned for its previous
draw-exempt status, but the University refused. That
decision was discriminatory, Horton admitted, since the
denial was based on women living in the house.
But simply increasing the number of draw-exempt
houses to include co-ed houses is not necessarily the
answer, Horton maintained. Adding to the number of
draw-exempt houses will increase the eviction rate for
students still in the draw, he said.
More than 800 students remained unassigned to
on-campus housing as of Sept. 1, according to housing
office statistics.
"Advantages for some houses outside the system is not
worth loss of equal access to the others," Horton added.
Sigma Chi pledge Tim Ferguson picked up on the "equal
access" point, continuing the argument.
Ferguson earlier this week proposed a system which
would allow financially independent houses to select house
members subjectively. Everyone would at least have equal
opportunity to rush a house under that system, Ferguson

said.
Horton has also heard the proposition of reviving
sororities, all-female independent houses banned in 1944. A
few avid sorority supporters from Theta Delta Chi
commented that sororities could accomodate the number of
women proportional to the number of men now in
fraternities.
George Gregory, legal staff counsel to the General
Secretary's Office, questioned the legality of separate
all-female houses.
Quoting a proposed regulation from the new law, Title
IX of the Federal Education Amendments Act of 1972,
Gregory said, "... if the organization receives assistance
from the institution they can not discriminate as to
membership on the basis of sex, even if some form of
separate housing is to be maintained."
Legal counselors who have accompanied Horton have
emphasized that the separate-but-equal clause is only one of
several proposed regulations which might be tacked on to
the general law.
Presidential Legal Counsel James V. Siena said the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) will
accept comments on the draft regulations on Title IX until
Oct. 15. Siena said he will compose an official letter from
the University.
