# On Great Britain's Next Government

LONDON — For the first time since 1924
the British electorate is faced with a second
general election inside a calendar year. For
many in London it will be their fourth visit
to the polling booth in 18 months, including
area and local elections, and for some, who
have experienced the added burden of a by
election, it will be the fifth.
The February election, forced on
Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath
by the National Union of Mineworkers, was
indecisive. The electorate, on being asked
"Who rules the country?," refused to decide.
The result was a minority Socialist
Government with a'five seat parliamentary
edge over the Tories, but, given the vagaries
of our electoral system, one million less
votes.
The only real conclusions that could be
drawn from the Feb. 28 returns were the
increasing popualrity of Welsh and Scottish
Nationalism, the enormous complexity of the
situation in Northern Ireland, the revival of
the once nearly extinct Liberal Party and a
growing apathy towards politics in general
and the big parties in particular.
Now we are once again being asked to
entrust the management of our islands to one
of three national parties. Following the
theme of "Who rules the country?," the
Autumn campaigns are revolving around
national unity to fight inflation (or, as the
Tory manifesto terms it, "Putting Britain
First"). The Liberals, meanwhile, shout that
the country needs a government independent
of business (Conservative) and unions
(Labour). In fact the Tories seem so worried
about inflation (now at 20 percent per
annum) that they have offered, even if
returned with a majority, to form a coalition.
What have the Socialists done over the last
six months? They have scrapped much Tory

legislation, especially that dealing with trade
unions, issued a massive number of Whate
Papers promising every section of society the
earth, shelved projects in Tory areas while
encouraging those in Socialist areas, given
nurses, students and pensioners massive pay
increases and generally embarked on an all
around vote-buying spending spree.
Socialist Premier Wilson has even dug
Bonsseau's Social Contract out of his bag of
political tricks, claiming that an
understanding exists between him and the
Unions. Ford workers at Dagenham and
Halewood disagree!
What then are the alternatives?
The Conservatives were elected in June,
1970, to control the unions, tackle inflation
by voluntary means, reduce the Civil Service,
denationalize and make private industry
stand on its own feet. In fact the unions ran
amok, statutory prices and incomes
legislation was introduced, the Civil Service
grew, the natioanlized sector increased and
government grants to private industry
continued.
Joined Common Market
To cap all that, we entered, rightly or
wrot gly, the European Economics
Community against the wishes of 75 percent
or more of the electorate, and the rate of
monetary expansion was so ludicrously high
that Milton Friedman became almost a
household name. No wonder the Tories are
not hot favourites with the bookies.
The thiid national party, the Liberals, has
gained much from Socialist and Conservative
failures over the last ten years. They won a
number of by-elections during the latter part
of the Heath administration and in February
took 15 seats, later increasing to 16 with the
defection of a moderate socialist.

Their main problem is finding centrist
policies that are distinct from those of the
ever leftward moving Tories. Like the Tories,
they support Europe and a devolution of
power in Scotland and Wales.
Six Million Votes
In February they polled six million votes
for 15 seats whereas Labour polled 11
million for 301 and the Tories 12 million for
296. Consequently, although they only need
another million or so votes to "take off" to,
say, 150 seats, one of their main platforms is
electoral reform — a single transferable vote
in multi-member constituencies. Their main
hope is to hold the balance of power. The
bookies are quoting 100-to-1 against their
leader Jeremy Thorpe being the next occupant
of 10 Downing Street.
With the Socialists odds on favorites to be
the largest single party, what are the chances
of their having a workable overall majority
with the growth of the Liberals and the
Nationalists? As I write, the campaign is only
entering its third of 21 days. However, most
pundits believe that the Scottish Nationalists
will increase their ranks at Westminster, that
the Welsh might capture one or two more,
that the Liberals stand a good chance of at
least holding their present ground and maybe
even doubling it and that the Conservatives
will not take too bad a beating.
Consequently very few impartial observers
are willing to state categorically that Labour
will have an overall victory — better to play
safe and say we will have either a coalition, a
second minority socialist government or a
new majority socialist administration, the
chances of all three being at the moment
fairly even.

1970, to control the unions, tackle inflation
by voluntary means, reduce the Civil Service,
denationalize and make private industry
stand on its own feet. In fact the unions ran
amok, statutory prices and incomes
legislation was introduced, the Civil Service
grew, the natioanlized sector increased and
government grants to private industry
continued.
Joined Common Market
To cap all that, we entered, rightly or
wrot gly, the European Economics
Community against the wishes of 75 percent
or more of the electorate, and the rate of
monetary expansion was so ludicrously high
that Milton Friedman became almost a
household name. No wonder the Tories are
not hot favourites with the bookies.
The thiid national party, the Liberals, has
gained much from Socialist and Conservative
failures over the last ten years. They won a
number of by-elections during the latter part
of the Heath administration and in February
took 15 seats, later increasing to 16 with the
defection of a moderate socialist.

Their main problem is finding centrist
policies that are distinct from those of the
ever leftward moving Tories. Like the Tories,
they support Europe and a devolution of
power in Scotland and Wales.
Six Million Votes
In February they polled six million votes
for 15 seats whereas Labour polled 11
million for 301 and the Tories 12 million for
296. Consequently, although they only need
another million or so votes to "take off" to,
say, 150 seats, one of their main platforms is
electoral reform — a single transferable vote
in multi-member constituencies. Their main
hope is to hold the balance of power. The
bookies are quoting 100-to-1 against their
leader Jeremy Thorpe being the next occupant
of 10 Downing Street.
With the Socialists odds on favorites to be
the largest single party, what are the chances
of their having a workable overall majority
with the growth of the Liberals and the
Nationalists? As I write, the campaign is only
entering its third of 21 days. However, most
pundits believe that the Scottish Nationalists
will increase their ranks at Westminster, that
the Welsh might capture one or two more,
that the Liberals stand a good chance of at
least holding their present ground and maybe
even doubling it and that the Conservatives
will not take too bad a beating.
Consequently very few impartial observers
are willing to state categorically that Labour
will have an overall victory — better to play
safe and say we will have either a coalition, a
second minority socialist government or a
new majority socialist administration, the
chances of all three being at the moment
fairly even.

LONDON — For the first time since 1924
the British electorate is faced with a second
general election inside a calendar year. For
many in London it will be their fourth visit
to the polling booth in 18 months, including
area and local elections, and for some, who
have experienced the added burden of a by
election, it will be the fifth.
The February election, forced on
Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath
by the National Union of Mineworkers, was
indecisive. The electorate, on being asked
"Who rules the country?," refused to decide.
The result was a minority Socialist
Government with a'five seat parliamentary
edge over the Tories, but, given the vagaries
of our electoral system, one million less
votes.
The only real conclusions that could be
drawn from the Feb. 28 returns were the
increasing popualrity of Welsh and Scottish
Nationalism, the enormous complexity of the
situation in Northern Ireland, the revival of
the once nearly extinct Liberal Party and a
growing apathy towards politics in general
and the big parties in particular.
Now we are once again being asked to
entrust the management of our islands to one
of three national parties. Following the
theme of "Who rules the country?," the
Autumn campaigns are revolving around
national unity to fight inflation (or, as the
Tory manifesto terms it, "Putting Britain
First"). The Liberals, meanwhile, shout that
the country needs a government independent
of business (Conservative) and unions
(Labour). In fact the Tories seem so worried
about inflation (now at 20 percent per
annum) that they have offered, even if
returned with a majority, to form a coalition.
What have the Socialists done over the last
six months? They have scrapped much Tory

legislation, especially that dealing with trade
unions, issued a massive number of Whate
Papers promising every section of society the
earth, shelved projects in Tory areas while
encouraging those in Socialist areas, given
nurses, students and pensioners massive pay
increases and generally embarked on an all
around vote-buying spending spree.
Socialist Premier Wilson has even dug
Bonsseau's Social Contract out of his bag of
political tricks, claiming that an
understanding exists between him and the
Unions. Ford workers at Dagenham and
Halewood disagree!

Consequently very few impartial observers
are willing to state categorically that Labour
will have an overall victory — better to play
safe and say we will have either a coalition, a
second minority socialist government or a
new majority socialist administration, the
chances of all three being at the moment
fairly even.

LONDON — For the first time since 1924
the British electorate is faced with a second
general election inside a calendar year. For
many in London it will be their fourth visit
to the polling booth in 18 months, including
area and local elections, and for some, who
have experienced the added burden of a by
election, it will be the fifth.
The February election, forced on
Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath
by the National Union of Mineworkers, was
indecisive. The electorate, on being asked
"Who rules the country?," refused to decide.
The result was a minority Socialist
Government with a'five seat parliamentary
edge over the Tories, but, given the vagaries
of our electoral system, one million less
votes.
The only real conclusions that could be
drawn from the Feb. 28 returns were the
increasing popualrity of Welsh and Scottish
Nationalism, the enormous complexity of the
situation in Northern Ireland, the revival of
the once nearly extinct Liberal Party and a
growing apathy towards politics in general
and the big parties in particular.
Now we are once again being asked to
entrust the management of our islands to one
of three national parties. Following the
theme of "Who rules the country?," the
Autumn campaigns are revolving around
national unity to fight inflation (or, as the
Tory manifesto terms it, "Putting Britain
First"). The Liberals, meanwhile, shout that
the country needs a government independent
of business (Conservative) and unions
(Labour). In fact the Tories seem so worried
about inflation (now at 20 percent per
annum) that they have offered, even if
returned with a majority, to form a coalition.
What have the Socialists done over the last
six months? They have scrapped much Tory

legislation, especially that dealing with trade
unions, issued a massive number of Whate
Papers promising every section of society the
earth, shelved projects in Tory areas while
encouraging those in Socialist areas, given
nurses, students and pensioners massive pay
increases and generally embarked on an all
around vote-buying spending spree.
Socialist Premier Wilson has even dug
Bonsseau's Social Contract out of his bag of
political tricks, claiming that an
understanding exists between him and the
Unions. Ford workers at Dagenham and
Halewood disagree!
What then are the alternatives?
The Conservatives were elected in June,
1970, to control the unions, tackle inflation
by voluntary means, reduce the Civil Service,
denationalize and make private industry
stand on its own feet. In fact the unions ran
amok, statutory prices and incomes
legislation was introduced, the Civil Service
grew, the natioanlized sector increased and
government grants to private industry
continued.
Joined Common Market
To cap all that, we entered, rightly or
wrot gly, the European Economics
Community against the wishes of 75 percent
or more of the electorate, and the rate of
monetary expansion was so ludicrously high
that Milton Friedman became almost a
household name. No wonder the Tories are
not hot favourites with the bookies.
The thiid national party, the Liberals, has
gained much from Socialist and Conservative
failures over the last ten years. They won a
number of by-elections during the latter part
of the Heath administration and in February
took 15 seats, later increasing to 16 with the
defection of a moderate socialist.

Their main problem is finding centrist
policies that are distinct from those of the
ever leftward moving Tories. Like the Tories,
they support Europe and a devolution of
power in Scotland and Wales.
Six Million Votes
In February they polled six million votes
for 15 seats whereas Labour polled 11
million for 301 and the Tories 12 million for
296. Consequently, although they only need
another million or so votes to "take off" to,
say, 150 seats, one of their main platforms is
electoral reform — a single transferable vote
in multi-member constituencies. Their main
hope is to hold the balance of power. The
bookies are quoting 100-to-1 against their
leader Jeremy Thorpe being the next occupant
of 10 Downing Street.
With the Socialists odds on favorites to be
the largest single party, what are the chances
of their having a workable overall majority
with the growth of the Liberals and the
Nationalists? As I write, the campaign is only
entering its third of 21 days. However, most
pundits believe that the Scottish Nationalists
will increase their ranks at Westminster, that
the Welsh might capture one or two more,
that the Liberals stand a good chance of at
least holding their present ground and maybe
even doubling it and that the Conservatives
will not take too bad a beating.
Consequently very few impartial observers
are willing to state categorically that Labour
will have an overall victory — better to play
safe and say we will have either a coalition, a
second minority socialist government or a
new majority socialist administration, the
chances of all three being at the moment
