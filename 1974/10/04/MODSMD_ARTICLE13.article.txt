# The 						C-15 Needs A Student Majority

You stand accused of cheating
on your Swahili final. You've
been caught painting the carpet in
the lounge of a rival dorm black.
You're charged with obstructing
traffic for lying at midfield during
the Stanford-USC game, to
protest ticket prices. Your
professor has flunked you for
snoring during his lecture.
What do all these traumatic
experiences have in common?
The "law" you have broken is
probably one of three basic codes
described in the Stanford
Legislative and Judicial System.
Simplified, they say that you
should be a "good citizen," that
you should obey the Honor Code
and that "free speech" does not
include campus disruption. The
codes were established Hy the
Stanford Conduct Legislative
Council. Composition: six faculty,
five students.
Facts Determined
Next, a hearing officer (an
attorney hired by the University)
determines the facts of the case
and presents them to the Campus
Judicial Panel (CJP). This is
Stanford's version of a jury. If
you are a Stanford student, you
are under its jurisdiction. If you'd
like to remain a Stanford student,
you must comply with the CJP. It
has the power to suspend or even
expel a student for
noncoope ration.
Your only other course of
action is to throw yourself at the
mercy of the Dean of Students, or
hope for a presidential
pardon(from Lyman, not Ford),
since CJP "sentences" take the
form of recommendations to the
President.
The CJP is not part of the

original system, but a replacement
made by Lyman for the Student
Judicial Council. The SJC
involved students in the
fact-finding procedures more than
does the CJP, and did not give the
chairman (appointed by the
President) such complete control
of the proceedings.
Composition At Issue
The main issue, however, has
been that' of composition. The
CJP consists of three faculty
members nominated by the
Academic Senate, three students
selected at random and the
chairman, who votes to break ties.
The current CJP has never been

approved by the student body. In
fact, students have repeatedly
rejected the system, and even
reforms in the system which they
felt had not gone far enough in
providing a student majority and
increasing student participation.
Enter the Committee of
Fifteen (C-15). Composed of six
students, six faculty and three
presidentially-appointed members,
its function is "proposing
amendments to the legislative and
judicial charter." The C-15 has
been responsible for most of the
proposed reforms to the charter in
the CJP-SJC problem. It has been
the center of attention in the

question of reforms because it
brings students, faculty and
administration together to draft
reforms which will hopefully be
acceptable to all concerned.
As a student member of the
C-15, I am convinced that
Stanford's student judicial system
will gain the respect and support
of students only if it contains at
least a student majority. An
effective system for student
justice must have the approval of
the student body.
