Under normal circumstances,
the total ruination of a truly
mediocre restaurant is of little
concern to anyone. Sometimes,
however, the character of a
restaurant may be overshadowed
by other, more important factors.
This seems to be the situation at
Tresidder Memorial Union, which
has lowered the quality of its
previously unappetizing foods,
and is the only restaurant on the
Leland Junior campus.
Admittedly the food served at
Tresidder during previous quarters
might not have delighted the most
selective of gourmets, but the
food was, if nothing else,
adequate. The hamburgers do
contain some meat — perhaps not
as much as your dog's Alpo, but a

noticeable amount, at least
traceable by our junior chemists.
Tresidder's modernization has
produced a menu so limited that
unless your tastes can
accommodate a Ph.D hot dog or a
hamburger that is bound to treat
all you a-la-carters, then I suggest
you go vegetarian. The burgers
come in three unpalatable sizes
which contain all of the flavor of
the normal burger with none of
the taste.
What Was It?
I stumbled in unaware the
other day, only to be handed
something which I hesitate to
classify in any food group, but it
looked similar to a Big Mac, with
no lettuce, pickle, tomato, meat,
etc. The way that I recognized it

was by the unmistakable grease
flavor of Mac Donald's.
Well, Stanfordidians, I have a
few suggestions: DO THIS WITH
YOUR BURGER:
THROW IT TO A FRIEND: I
hear that they make great frisbees.
SA VE IT: Bring it home. Put it
on the carpet. Then run and tell
your mother what the dog did.
TAKE IT SKIING WITH YOU:
They make dandy snow-gag jokes.
And now that we're on the
subject of rejects, how do you like
your new non-photo i.d.? I have
heard a few students complain,
but I can't quite justify their
complaints: my i.d. was delicious.

TAKE IT SKIING WITH YOU:
They make dandy snow-gag jokes.
And now that we're on the

heard a few students complain,
but I can't quite justify their
complaints: my i.d. was delicious.
