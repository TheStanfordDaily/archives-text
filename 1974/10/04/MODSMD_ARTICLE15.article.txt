# On The Campus Climate

David Nimmer

In the course of academic year
1974, many of Stanford's living
units will undoubtedly stage at
least one evening colloquy
detailing the evils, hypocrisies
and atrocities of the University.
Perhaps the unholy alliance
with fascist corporations will be
denounced, or due harangue paid
to Larry Morton's housing
mismanagement. But the main
grievance will be reserved for
Stanford's intellectual
atmosphere, descriptions of which
will range from "stultifying" to
"non-existent."
These sessions are sometimes
valuable, often justified. Yet
having only recently endured my
own house's annual exercise in
University-flagellation, I " wish to
raise a lone voice in defense of
"the system." In particular, my
goal is to rebut a few of the major
complaints lodged against our
intellectual climate. These
include:
1. Stanford stresses the
acquisition of facts, to the neglect
of thinking;
2. Professor/student contact is
too limited;
3. There is too much of a
Science/Humanity dichotomy.
Courses are too compartment
alized.
Not having undertaken surveys
on the subject, I can represent
only my own views.
Stanford 'Different'
These show me a Stanford far
different from the one portrayed,
above.
All of my classes here have
required me to learn some facts.
Far from stopping there, however,
almost all have further demanded
analysis of these facts for truth
and value, and also, where
possible, synthesis of alternative
systems. Through both prodding
by the professor and the stimulus
of text-books, more has been
required than rote memorizations.
This pattern extends even to
elementary foreign language
classes, in my acquaintance.
Although the primary function of
these classes must be to instil the
maximum number of facts,
attention has been paid to some
minimum analyzing of
morphology and phonemic
evolution, rather than bare
vocabulary acquisition.
Small Comfort
It is small comfort, I realize, to
the student who has vainly been
seeking his chem prof all year that
this writer has never had a
problem seeing any of his
professors. But surely, my
experience cannot be that much
out of kilter with the rest of the
school! Nonetheless, too many
reclusive students blame the lack
of student/teacher intercourse on
the other side.
Undoubtedly, there are some
hermitic professors extant (how
else to account for the widespread
currency of the inaccessible prof
myth?). But their number must be
miniscule compared to those who
are willing to relate to a student
who so desires.
The University tries to make
"well rounded boys and girls" of
each of us through its distribution
requirement. More it cannot and
should not do. It is up to every
individual to insure his own
"liberal" education.
Turning now to
compartmentalization, what is the
alternative? A seminar entitled
"The Falling Apple" to be
examined from the physical,
chemical, biological, sociological,
economic, historical, accoustical
and artistic viewpoints? Granted, I
exaggerate, but how can we
expect any instructor to master
even two fields?
Certainly, no one questions the
value of an integrated education.
The point is that it is available at
Stanford, in discrete chunks for
the student to interrelate.
Through personal thought,
exchange with others and proper
selection of courses, the student
here can learn almost all facets of
nearly any problem. He must pick
and choose, and acquire bit by bit
â€” unfortunately, no one is or can
be master of all human
knowledge.
