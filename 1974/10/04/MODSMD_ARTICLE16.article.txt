# Tactical Errors May Doom Residential College
## 
### TERRY ANZUR GLENN GARVIN 
Pity Mike Herman and Tom Glenn. They
have problems.
Herman, ASSU president, and Glenn, a
graduate student in anthropology, offered
Stanford a plan for a residential college last
week. Life has not been easy for them since.
The plan has been reviled by several
administrators and scorned by others. And now
its authors have some more thinking to do.
Basically, their college would work like
this: a nine-member policy committee would
select five faculty members, 45 students, and
a theme for the house to explore. Then, for
two quarters, the faculty and students would
live and study together. Neither could
participate in regular academic programs.
The program would cost about $150,000 a
year, according to Herman and Glenn.
Endless Headaches
The two have set out details of a
conceivably workable program. But several
serious tactical errors and some horrendous
oversights have given them endless headaches
and may doom their idea, which they dub
"Stanford-in-Stanford" because it resembles
closely the University's foreign campuses.
Headache Number One is money. Given a
huge grant like the one that launched Yale's
residential education program, the
Herman-Glenn proposal could be viable. But a
request for $150,000 per year to operate a
residential college here could not have come

at a more inopportune time.
Cutbacks in government spending and
foundation support for higher education
reflect national economic uncertainties. Here
at Stanford, a spectacular $300 million
fundraising campaign has overshadowed a
quiet but serious effort to trim unnecessary
University expenditures under the Budget
Adjustment Program.
Headache Number Two: the residential
college proposal was handed to University

decision-makers as a fait accompli. Herman
said he hoped his press conference
presentation of the proposal "won't be
construed as a pressure tactic" but admitted
he would do it the same way if he were
starting over again.
Attack Presentation
While creative thinking and bold action
from students is not inherently bad, in this
case it's allowed critics to attack the proposal
on its presentation rather than content.

"I think it was tactically incorrect to spring
[the plan] full blown," said James Gibbs,
dean of undergraduate studies. "Now you
either have to attack the proposal or endorse
it out of hand. Unfortunately we can't
endorse it without questioning it first."
Gibbs, as undergraduate studies dean,
would be an ex-officio non-voting member of
the residential college's policy committee. His
support is essential, but absent because
Herman and Glenn failed to realize that "you
never start building any program in this
University from the top down," Gibbs said.
Administrators weren't the only members
of the University community that
"Stanford -in-Stanford" caught by surprise.
Although Herman received general feedback
on the proposal from students during his
campaign, apparently no effort has been made
to seek advice from students already
committed to residential education here.
'Thunderstruck'
Junior Chris Elms, a second-year resident
of Whitman House, said that "nobody in the
house had any input" into the new residential
college plan. Whitman has been called an
"interdisciplinary" or "residential education"
theme house, Elms said, and its residents were
"thunderstruck" by news of the
Herman-Glenn proposal.
Some observers have shaken off their initial
shock and offered tough criticisms of the
proposal. Larry Horton, associate dean of
student affairs in charge of residential

education programs, wondered whether the
stipulation that students not participate in
outside academic programs wouldn't isolate
them too much.
The ban on such participation would
indeed leave students in the residential college
as isolated as those attending Stanford's
foreign campuses. And it's interesting to note
that an attempt to make the overseas campus
in Tours, France, more academic triggered a
mass drop in enrollments there.
The Herman-Glenn program would foster
such isolation — without offering the same
travel benefits available in Tours. Would it
work? Herman says yes, but enrollment
figures for the European campuses this
quarter strongly suggest he's wrong.
By modeling their proposal on the overseas
campuses, Herman and Glenn apparently
overlooked the possibility of modifying an
existing theme house. Their proposal is "what
we're after at Whitman — with some
modifications," Elms noted. Whitman features
a faculty resident and various house seminars
— without stopping house residents from
utilizing the full resources of the University.
Herman says he and Glenn will try to
eliminate some of these headaches during "a
long brainstorming session this weekend."
Perhaps by the time it's formally presented to
the University Oct. 9, their proposal will
reflect the realities of University
administrative procedure and student needs,
as well as the ideals of its authors.

quarter strongly suggest he's wrong.
By modeling their proposal on the overseas
campuses, Herman and Glenn apparently
overlooked the possibility of modifying an
existing theme house. Their proposal is "what
we're after at Whitman — with some
modifications," Elms noted. Whitman features
a faculty resident and various house seminars
— without stopping house residents from
utilizing the full resources of the University.
Herman says he and Glenn will try to
eliminate some of these headaches during "a
long brainstorming session this weekend."
Perhaps by the time it's formally presented to
the University Oct. 9, their proposal will
reflect the realities of University
administrative procedure and student needs,
as well as the ideals of its authors.

Mike Herman
Pity Mike Herman and Tom Glenn. They
have problems.
Herman, ASSU president, and Glenn, a
graduate student in anthropology, offered
Stanford a plan for a residential college last
week. Life has not been easy for them since.
The plan has been reviled by several
administrators and scorned by others. And now
its authors have some more thinking to do.
Basically, their college would work like
this: a nine-member policy committee would
select five faculty members, 45 students, and
a theme for the house to explore. Then, for
two quarters, the faculty and students would
live and study together. Neither could
participate in regular academic programs.
The program would cost about $150,000 a
year, according to Herman and Glenn.
Endless Headaches
The two have set out details of a
conceivably workable program. But several
serious tactical errors and some horrendous
oversights have given them endless headaches
and may doom their idea, which they dub
"Stanford-in-Stanford" because it resembles
closely the University's foreign campuses.
Headache Number One is money. Given a
huge grant like the one that launched Yale's
residential education program, the
Herman-Glenn proposal could be viable. But a
request for $150,000 per year to operate a
residential college here could not have come

at a more inopportune time.
Cutbacks in government spending and
foundation support for higher education
reflect national economic uncertainties. Here
at Stanford, a spectacular $300 million
fundraising campaign has overshadowed a
quiet but serious effort to trim unnecessary
University expenditures under the Budget
Adjustment Program.
Headache Number Two: the residential
college proposal was handed to University

decision-makers as a fait accompli. Herman
said he hoped his press conference
presentation of the proposal "won't be
construed as a pressure tactic" but admitted
he would do it the same way if he were
starting over again.
Attack Presentation
While creative thinking and bold action
from students is not inherently bad, in this
case it's allowed critics to attack the proposal
on its presentation rather than content.

"I think it was tactically incorrect to spring
[the plan] full blown," said James Gibbs,
dean of undergraduate studies. "Now you
either have to attack the proposal or endorse
it out of hand. Unfortunately we can't
endorse it without questioning it first."
Gibbs, as undergraduate studies dean,
would be an ex-officio non-voting member of
the residential college's policy committee. His
support is essential, but absent because
Herman and Glenn failed to realize that "you
never start building any program in this
University from the top down," Gibbs said.
Administrators weren't the only members
of the University community that
"Stanford -in-Stanford" caught by surprise.
Although Herman received general feedback
on the proposal from students during his
campaign, apparently no effort has been made
to seek advice from students already
committed to residential education here.
'Thunderstruck'
Junior Chris Elms, a second-year resident
of Whitman House, said that "nobody in the
house had any input" into the new residential
college plan. Whitman has been called an
"interdisciplinary" or "residential education"
theme house, Elms said, and its residents were
"thunderstruck" by news of the
Herman-Glenn proposal.
Some observers have shaken off their initial
shock and offered tough criticisms of the
proposal. Larry Horton, associate dean of
student affairs in charge of residential

education programs, wondered whether the
stipulation that students not participate in
outside academic programs wouldn't isolate
them too much.
The ban on such participation would
indeed leave students in the residential college
as isolated as those attending Stanford's
foreign campuses. And it's interesting to note
that an attempt to make the overseas campus
in Tours, France, more academic triggered a
mass drop in enrollments there.
The Herman-Glenn program would foster
such isolation — without offering the same
travel benefits available in Tours. Would it
work? Herman says yes, but enrollment
figures for the European campuses this
quarter strongly suggest he's wrong.

shock and offered tough criticisms of the
proposal. Larry Horton, associate dean of
student affairs in charge of residential

education programs, wondered whether the
stipulation that students not participate in
outside academic programs wouldn't isolate
them too much.
The ban on such participation would
indeed leave students in the residential college
as isolated as those attending Stanford's
foreign campuses. And it's interesting to note
that an attempt to make the overseas campus
in Tours, France, more academic triggered a
mass drop in enrollments there.
The Herman-Glenn program would foster
such isolation — without offering the same
travel benefits available in Tours. Would it
work? Herman says yes, but enrollment
figures for the European campuses this
quarter strongly suggest he's wrong.
By modeling their proposal on the overseas
campuses, Herman and Glenn apparently
overlooked the possibility of modifying an
existing theme house. Their proposal is "what
we're after at Whitman — with some
modifications," Elms noted. Whitman features
a faculty resident and various house seminars
— without stopping house residents from
utilizing the full resources of the University.
Herman says he and Glenn will try to
eliminate some of these headaches during "a
long brainstorming session this weekend."
Perhaps by the time it's formally presented to
the University Oct. 9, their proposal will
reflect the realities of University
administrative procedure and student needs,
as well as the ideals of its authors.

Pity Mike Herman and Tom Glenn. They
have problems.
Herman, ASSU president, and Glenn, a
graduate student in anthropology, offered
Stanford a plan for a residential college last
week. Life has not been easy for them since.
The plan has been reviled by several
administrators and scorned by others. And now
its authors have some more thinking to do.
Basically, their college would work like
this: a nine-member policy committee would
select five faculty members, 45 students, and
a theme for the house to explore. Then, for
two quarters, the faculty and students would
live and study together. Neither could
participate in regular academic programs.
The program would cost about $150,000 a
year, according to Herman and Glenn.
Endless Headaches
The two have set out details of a
conceivably workable program. But several
serious tactical errors and some horrendous
oversights have given them endless headaches
and may doom their idea, which they dub
"Stanford-in-Stanford" because it resembles
closely the University's foreign campuses.
Headache Number One is money. Given a
huge grant like the one that launched Yale's
residential education program, the
Herman-Glenn proposal could be viable. But a
request for $150,000 per year to operate a
residential college here could not have come

at a more inopportune time.
Cutbacks in government spending and
foundation support for higher education
reflect national economic uncertainties. Here
at Stanford, a spectacular $300 million
fundraising campaign has overshadowed a
quiet but serious effort to trim unnecessary
University expenditures under the Budget
Adjustment Program.
Headache Number Two: the residential
college proposal was handed to University

decision-makers as a fait accompli. Herman
said he hoped his press conference
presentation of the proposal "won't be
construed as a pressure tactic" but admitted
he would do it the same way if he were
starting over again.
Attack Presentation
While creative thinking and bold action
from students is not inherently bad, in this
case it's allowed critics to attack the proposal
on its presentation rather than content.

"I think it was tactically incorrect to spring
[the plan] full blown," said James Gibbs,
dean of undergraduate studies. "Now you
either have to attack the proposal or endorse
it out of hand. Unfortunately we can't
endorse it without questioning it first."
Gibbs, as undergraduate studies dean,
would be an ex-officio non-voting member of
the residential college's policy committee. His
support is essential, but absent because
Herman and Glenn failed to realize that "you
never start building any program in this
University from the top down," Gibbs said.
Administrators weren't the only members
of the University community that
"Stanford -in-Stanford" caught by surprise.
Although Herman received general feedback
on the proposal from students during his
campaign, apparently no effort has been made
to seek advice from students already
committed to residential education here.
'Thunderstruck'
Junior Chris Elms, a second-year resident
of Whitman House, said that "nobody in the
house had any input" into the new residential
college plan. Whitman has been called an
"interdisciplinary" or "residential education"
theme house, Elms said, and its residents were
"thunderstruck" by news of the
Herman-Glenn proposal.
