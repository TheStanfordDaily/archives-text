# Opens Files To Students
## Admissions Office Trembles Over New Law 
### BOB LOWE 
A new federal law that slipped through
Congress under the nose of higher education
presents a multitude of troubling problems for
the University.
The controversial law, the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974,
goes into effect Nov. 21 (not mid-October as
previously reported in the Daily).
It will open the University's confidential
files on students to the students themselves.
Universities across the nation, including
Stanford, are worried about giving students
access to letters of recommendation written
with an understanding of confidentiality. But
short of violating the law, it appears they will
have little choice.
Serious Problems
The new act creates several serious
problems for the University.
The admissions office is hit two ways.
First, it is presently receiving
recommendations for next year's prospective
freshmen, written with an informal

confidentiality understanding the University
can't keep.
The University will have to inform the high
school teachers, counselors and others writing
the letters that it can't keep them
confidential, said James Siena, legal advisor to
President Richard L. Lyman.
However, by accomplishing this big
publicity feat, the University will face a
second problem.
Whitewashing
Recommendations written without
confidentiality are certain to be whitewashed.
Authors will be hesitant to point out a
student's weak points. Judging prospective
students on the basis of recommendations
which may not be frank and candid will be
tough.
This problem isn't isolated to students
entering the University. The loss in the
credibility of recommendations will also
extend to graduate schools.
An aide to Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), Tom Constantino,said "the law might
change the whole philosophy behind the letter
of recommendation."
This year's applicants to law, medical and
other graduate schools may find their letters
of recommendation playing a different role in
the selection process.
'Everything'
Another serious problem is the letters of
recommendation already written which are
sitting in students' files. "As I read the
legislation, it opens up everything, including
letters already written," Siena said.
Thousands of these letters were written
"under a common understanding of
confidentiality," Siena added. Showing them
to students is an ethical violation if not a legal
one.

Siena would not say what the University
will do when the law becomes effective.
He noted that the University has 45 days
to comply with a student's request to see his
file. This is some breathing room and Siena
said the University might use it to get the
author's permission to give the letter to the
student.
At Least One
But it seems certain at least one student
will want to see a letter written by a person
who doesn't want him to see it.
Siena said the University will decide what

to do in that case by the Nov. 21 deadline.
Authored by conservative Sen. James
Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.), the act is intended to
allow a student to challenge the validity of a
recommendation he believes inaccurate.
Provisions in the act also prevent the
distribution of confidential information
without the student's okay.
The law slipped through Congress without
arousing much interest or recognition of its
implications. Apparently universities across
the nation were sleeping when it was
considered and higher education had no lobby
fighting it. They're certainly awake now.

to comply with a student's request to see his
file. This is some breathing room and Siena
said the University might use it to get the
author's permission to give the letter to the
student.
At Least One
But it seems certain at least one student
will want to see a letter written by a person
who doesn't want him to see it.
Siena said the University will decide what

to do in that case by the Nov. 21 deadline.
Authored by conservative Sen. James
Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.), the act is intended to
allow a student to challenge the validity of a
recommendation he believes inaccurate.
Provisions in the act also prevent the
distribution of confidential information
without the student's okay.
The law slipped through Congress without
arousing much interest or recognition of its
implications. Apparently universities across
the nation were sleeping when it was
considered and higher education had no lobby
fighting it. They're certainly awake now.

A new federal law that slipped through
Congress under the nose of higher education
presents a multitude of troubling problems for
the University.
The controversial law, the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974,
goes into effect Nov. 21 (not mid-October as
previously reported in the Daily).
It will open the University's confidential
files on students to the students themselves.
Universities across the nation, including
Stanford, are worried about giving students
access to letters of recommendation written
with an understanding of confidentiality. But
short of violating the law, it appears they will
have little choice.
Serious Problems
The new act creates several serious
problems for the University.
The admissions office is hit two ways.
First, it is presently receiving
recommendations for next year's prospective
freshmen, written with an informal

confidentiality understanding the University
can't keep.
The University will have to inform the high
school teachers, counselors and others writing
the letters that it can't keep them
confidential, said James Siena, legal advisor to
President Richard L. Lyman.
However, by accomplishing this big
publicity feat, the University will face a
second problem.
Whitewashing
Recommendations written without
confidentiality are certain to be whitewashed.
Authors will be hesitant to point out a
student's weak points. Judging prospective
students on the basis of recommendations
which may not be frank and candid will be
tough.
This problem isn't isolated to students
entering the University. The loss in the
credibility of recommendations will also
extend to graduate schools.
An aide to Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), Tom Constantino,said "the law might
change the whole philosophy behind the letter
of recommendation."
This year's applicants to law, medical and
other graduate schools may find their letters
of recommendation playing a different role in
the selection process.
'Everything'
Another serious problem is the letters of
recommendation already written which are
sitting in students' files. "As I read the
legislation, it opens up everything, including
letters already written," Siena said.
Thousands of these letters were written
"under a common understanding of
confidentiality," Siena added. Showing them
to students is an ethical violation if not a legal
one.

Siena would not say what the University
will do when the law becomes effective.
He noted that the University has 45 days
to comply with a student's request to see his
file. This is some breathing room and Siena
said the University might use it to get the
author's permission to give the letter to the
student.
