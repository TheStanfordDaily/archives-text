# Sides Form In Frat Fight
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The issue of whether on-campus
undergraduate houses should be exempt from
the spring housing draw grew more
complicated this week as new proposals
continued to emerge.
Two clear sides are developing: those who
believe all students living in campus residences
should particpate in the housing draw and
those who think certain groups of students
should be exempt from drawing.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon member David Salego
has submitted a proposal under which all
students would participate in the draw, with
those obtaining a number below the cutoff
being eligible for a space in the independent
house of their choice.
Diametrically opposed are three recent
proposals which would allow certain groups to
attain draw-exemption status.
Ferguson Proposal
Tim Ferguson, of Sigma Chi, submitted a
proposal which would allow all houses
"willing to assume full financial liability" to
be outside the draw.
Under Ferguson's plan, financially
independent houses would be allowed to
subjectively select their members, as
fraternities do now.
Proposals by Inter-fraternity Council
President Michael Nilsson and Theta Xi
member Allan Chinen are similar to
Ferguson's in that they would award

draw-exemption to all houses that assume
financial independence.
The strength of the fraternity argument is
based on history, financial support and the
importance of remaining autonomous.
Alumni-Built
Two houses, Sigma Chi and Theta Xi, were
completely built with funds provided by
alumni of the fraternity. A number of other
houses, including those in Cluster 11, were
partly funded by alumni contributions and
loans obtained by individual alumni
corporations.
But the University has the title to all
fraternities except Sigma Chi and Theta Xi
and without exception, the Greek houses are
located on "prime University land" as Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton has
often said.
Most fraternity members do not want to be
subject to the draw and feel they have a
legitimate right to be outside the system.
But if they are to maintain the exemption,
other groups must also be eligible for
exemption. Horton says criteria should be
established to distinguish houses that deserve
the exemption.
F actors
Proposed distinguishing factors include
whether a house is a dormitory or a
small-group house; whether it is affiliated with
a national organization; and whether it is
single-sex or coed.

All of the above are generally regarded as
inadequate criteria for distinguishing between
houses.
The current proposals distinguish a
financially independent house from one that
is University operated, awarding the privilege
to the former residences. This appears to be
adequate criteria to most people.
But the question still remains whether any
residence on University land should be
granted privileges like being exempt from
eviction by the housing draw.
This is the question that Horton must
decide when he recommends housing policy
to Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons.
