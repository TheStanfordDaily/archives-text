# Pub Board Rules Chaparral In Limbo
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
The Stanford Chaparral is no longer
publishing, the ASSU Publications
Board declared yesterday, and its
space in the Storke Building can be
assigned to another publication.
In a meeting punctuated by heated
charges and countercharges, the Pub
Board voted 6-5 to rule that the
Chaparral has ceased publication.
Mike Dornheim, a former Chaparral
staff member, and Mason Biacher, aj
graduate student, appeared before the
Pub Board to compete for control of
the Chaparral and its office space.
Dornheim, supported by two members
of the Hammer and Coffin Society —
an organization affiliated with the
Chaparral — claimed the editorship
based on the rules of the Society.
According to Dornheim and his
supporters, the rules state that the
editorship automatically falls to the
active members of the Hammer and
Coffin Society on campus.
The Chaparral staff, including
Dornheim, was originally denied access to
its office by ASSU financial manager

•Frank Olivieri, who charged the
Chaparral with mismanagement. The
charges included substantial debts to
Atherton Advertising Typography and
misuse of office space.
According to Dale Snape, assistant
dean of student affairs, "the prime
concern of the Pub Board is to see that
the space is made the best use of."
However, according to Pub Board
Chairman Rich Jaroslovsky, "the
Board has no real power to enforce
decisions it has made."
The decision followed lengthy
debate on what power the Pub Board
has over the Chaparral. According to
the members of the Hammer and
Coffin Society, the Pub Board has no
authority to determine who the editor
of the Chaparral should be. "Who
should be head should be determined
internally," said Tim Haight, a
Hammer and Coffin Society member.
The members of the Society further
said the Board would be open to legal
suit by the Society, if the Pub Board
ruled against them.
In another vote, the Pub Board
denied seats on the Board to
Dornheim and his business manager,
Jim Hu. The two insisted thev were
nevertheless members of the Board,
and walked out.
The decision to declare the
Chaparral had ceased publishing was a
technical move on the part of the
Board which gives it control of the
office space. What future action the
Board will take remains unclear.
It appears that most of the
members of the Board would like to
give control of the Chaparral to
Blacher, who has already solicited
promises of financial support from the
University and the Hammer and Coffin
Trust Fund, a financial organization
separate from the Hammer and Coffin
Society. Jaroslovsky, a non-voting
member of the Board, said afterward,
"I suppose this leaves Mason in a
pretty good position."
