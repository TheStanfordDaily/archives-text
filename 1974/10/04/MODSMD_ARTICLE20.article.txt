# Cranston: Counted Down And Out, Now He's Back Upâ€”And Unbeatable
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Eight years ago, Californians might have
invested cheaply in the political stock of one
Alan Cranston. The victim of a bear market
for state Democrats, Cranston's fortunes
reached a low ebb in November 1966 when he
was ousted as state controller by Houston
Flournoy.
Two years later he was back in the political
arena, still not an imposing figure, but in
possession of enough political savvy to gain
the Democratic sena<orial nomination over a
collection of non-entities.
The November campaign wasn't much
tougher. Cranston was able to tag his
opponent, then-state superintendent of
schools Max Rafferty, as an ultra-conservative.

Rafferty's Bircher image, together with the
last-minute sputtering of Richard Nixon's
presidential campaign, was enough to propel
the unobtrusive Cranston into the Senate by a
narrow margin.
Something Happened
During the last six years in the U.S.
Capitol, something happened. Cranston gained
respect for his legislative abilities as a member
of the anti-war, anti-defense lobby. He rarely
antagonized his constituents, protected their
"interests" (compromising his own principles
on some issues, such as support of the
Lockheed loan) and rarely allowed his
left-oriented viewpoints to surface, save for
popular issues like the war.
When 1974 began, Watergate-stung
Republicans realized the California's senior
senator was virtually unbeatable. During
June's primary, they nominated a candidate
who assured it.
H.L. Richardson is, it's fair to say, a
hard-liner. On just about everything. Prisons,
for example; he believes that incapacitation is
more important than rehabilitation for

hardened criminals.
Most Agree
Actually, most Californians would
probably agree. As they would with his
positions on the death penalty (for), busing
(against) and government spending
(conservative).
But Richardson made a major mistake
prior to his eight-year political career. He
committed the ultimate sin of the
conservative politician. He joined the John
Birch Society.
So Alan Cranston can do exactly as he is
planning: ignore the campaign until Congress
adjourns in mid-October and return to
California a triumphant warrior. Polls indicate
he shall remain so.
His membership in the World Federalists
long forgotten, his rumored "subversive" ties
long since ignored by a public tired of
"McCarthyism," Cranston has run the gamut
from political hack to national statesman.
He's lucky he's such an avid runner in track
meets for seniors. He's going to need that
vigor for six more years in the Senate.

senator was virtually unbeatable. During
June's primary, they nominated a candidate
who assured it.
H.L. Richardson is, it's fair to say, a
hard-liner. On just about everything. Prisons,
for example; he believes that incapacitation is
more important than rehabilitation for

hardened criminals.
Most Agree
Actually, most Californians would
probably agree. As they would with his
positions on the death penalty (for), busing
(against) and government spending
(conservative).
But Richardson made a major mistake
prior to his eight-year political career. He
committed the ultimate sin of the
conservative politician. He joined the John
Birch Society.
So Alan Cranston can do exactly as he is
planning: ignore the campaign until Congress
adjourns in mid-October and return to
California a triumphant warrior. Polls indicate
he shall remain so.
His membership in the World Federalists
long forgotten, his rumored "subversive" ties
long since ignored by a public tired of
"McCarthyism," Cranston has run the gamut
from political hack to national statesman.
He's lucky he's such an avid runner in track
meets for seniors. He's going to need that
vigor for six more years in the Senate.
Eight years ago, Californians might have
invested cheaply in the political stock of one
Alan Cranston. The victim of a bear market
for state Democrats, Cranston's fortunes
reached a low ebb in November 1966 when he
was ousted as state controller by Houston
Flournoy.
Two years later he was back in the political
arena, still not an imposing figure, but in
possession of enough political savvy to gain
the Democratic sena<orial nomination over a
collection of non-entities.
The November campaign wasn't much
tougher. Cranston was able to tag his
opponent, then-state superintendent of
schools Max Rafferty, as an ultra-conservative.

Rafferty's Bircher image, together with the
last-minute sputtering of Richard Nixon's
presidential campaign, was enough to propel
the unobtrusive Cranston into the Senate by a
narrow margin.
Something Happened
During the last six years in the U.S.
Capitol, something happened. Cranston gained
respect for his legislative abilities as a member
of the anti-war, anti-defense lobby. He rarely
antagonized his constituents, protected their
"interests" (compromising his own principles
on some issues, such as support of the
Lockheed loan) and rarely allowed his
left-oriented viewpoints to surface, save for
popular issues like the war.
When 1974 began, Watergate-stung
Republicans realized the California's senior
senator was virtually unbeatable. During
June's primary, they nominated a candidate
who assured it.
