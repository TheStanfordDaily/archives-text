# USE Vote Certainly Proves Apathy Isn't Easy To Beat
## 
### DON COX 
The re-election of Jim Berk as president of
the United Stanford Employees (USE) union
was not particularly stunning news to anyone.
He is respected by most in the union as a
good labor organizer who has put in a lot of
work founding the union. USE represents
1400 technical, maintenance and service
employees. Nor did Berk have a particularly
strong opponent in the presidential race.
Other candidates that might have had a
chance of beating him have long since given
up on USE and left, or don't care anymore.
The latter may be the attitude of a lot of
workers who don't care if there is or isn't a
union so long as the union doesn't bother
them by taking too much of their pay for
dues.
That became evident at this week's
monthly membership meeting when only 30
of the union's 1000 or so members showed.
Of course, this is typical of many
organizations. Which is the point: the workers
don't think of USE as anything special if they
think of it as anything at all.

While Berk and his past associates still
dominate the union hierarchy, USE will try to
assume more of the look of an established
union. They have plans to develop dental,
legal, and medical programs for their members
and to concentrate on organizing more
workers on campus.
However, with debts still piled up from the
union's early activities, it will probably be a
while before the programs get off the ground.
USE is currently working on the
organization of the hospital workers and Berk
wouldn't mind representing the University's
clerical workers sometime in the future. It will
probably be a long way in the future.
Berk and USE officials have long been
associated with leftish political causes, since
USE was originally a leftist splinter group
from an older campus labor organization. This
has apparently faded as an issue.
While some thought the USE membership
might shed Berk and his leadership in this past
election along with the union's turbulent
beginning, Berk can probably ride the wave of
apathy for a while to come.
