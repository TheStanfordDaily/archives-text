# Stanford-In-Government Expands
## 
### ANN HOFFMAN 
As the nation's largest student intern
program, Stanford-in-Government last
summer helped place 75 students in
government offices and agencies in
Washington, Sacramento, San Francisco
and Atlanta.
Stanford students worked in the
Pentagon, the National Council of La Raza
Unida, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Division
of the Justice Department and in the
offices of many prominent Congressmen.
They also comprised one-fourth of the
interns who aided in last summer's
televised impeachment hearings.
This year, promises Board Chairman
Dave Brenner, the program, which
currently encompasses
Stanford-in-Washington,
S t a n 112 or d-i n-Sacr a me n to and
Stanford-in-the-Cities, will expand its
information and assistance services to cover
agencies in more cities than ever before.
Members of the Stanford-in-
Government Board will investigate
possible internships with federal
publications and with such special
programs as the Sierra Club and the
lobbying group Common Cause. This year,

a Board committee also will study the
feasibility of internships with consulates in
both Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.
Dispel Notion
Brenner stressed that expansion in these
areas will not hinder work on regular
positions in the Senate and the House of
Representatives, which provide the
majority of intern jobs. Brenner said,
however, that the organization will attempt
to dispel the notion that government
internships are available only to an elite
group of white upper middle-class students.
Since Stanford-in-Government is one of
the most liberally-funded programs in the
nation — with annual funds of
approximately $20,000 from alumni
contributions — Brenner feels that through
stipends the program may be able to
accommodate students from all financial
backgrounds. The organization also
emphasizes the importance of involving
minority groups in governmental work.
Programs within the organization provide
special services to Blacks and Chicanos
seeking internships.
Unlike many other student intern
programs, Stanford-in-Government does
not obtain specific positions and then

select students for the jobs on a
competitive basis.
Instead, the program attempts to
provide necessary and useful services to
interested students.
Ten-Year Period
The program first compiles and
dispenses information to applicants
drawing on the experiences of past interns.
Brenner stated that in "using information
gathered over a ten-year period and
updated each year," the program is able to
indicate positions most likely to be
available and those most worth obtaining.
Once the information on potential
positions is distributed, it becomes the
student's responsibility to write to specific
Congressmen and agencies, according to
Brenner.
Stanford-in-Government operates on the
principle that Stanford students themselves
are best able to assert their capabilities and
define their interests, he said.
Lobbying
After a student writes to a Congressman
or agency, Stanford-in-Government lobbies
for him, using resumes written by the
student himself.
Next February, a group of six board

members will fly to Washington to
represent those students desiring
internships. They will visit Congressional
offices and governmental agencies where
students have applied and will lobby for
each student on an individual basis. A
student may apply for more than one
position with a Congressman or agency.
Brenner stated that this lobbying service
is of particular importance to Stanford
students, since they must compete with
students from eastern universities who have
easier access to Washington. This lobbying,
according to Brenner, "provides
congressmen with much more personal
information on a student than any kind of
letter could possibly provide."
The program then offers an additional
service for those students who obtain
internships, but are consequently
confronted with financial problems. With
the assistance of a Financial Aids Office
rating system, the program last year
provided transportation and living expenses
for people requesting financial aid.
This system is a vast improvement over
the old method whereby stipends were
granted at the discretion of the chairman,
Brenner said.

ON THE MAKE—CooI, suave, debonair and well-groomed, this
fearless llama flirts with a Stanford girl. No one could tell he's
only a freshman. The llama was here this week to advertise Stanford
Night at Marine World tomorrow night.
As the nation's largest student intern
program, Stanford-in-Government last
summer helped place 75 students in
government offices and agencies in
Washington, Sacramento, San Francisco
and Atlanta.
Stanford students worked in the
Pentagon, the National Council of La Raza
Unida, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Division
of the Justice Department and in the
offices of many prominent Congressmen.
They also comprised one-fourth of the
interns who aided in last summer's
televised impeachment hearings.
This year, promises Board Chairman
Dave Brenner, the program, which
currently encompasses
Stanford-in-Washington,
S t a n 112 or d-i n-Sacr a me n to and
Stanford-in-the-Cities, will expand its
information and assistance services to cover
agencies in more cities than ever before.
Members of the Stanford-in-
Government Board will investigate
possible internships with federal
publications and with such special
programs as the Sierra Club and the
lobbying group Common Cause. This year,

a Board committee also will study the
feasibility of internships with consulates in
both Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.
Dispel Notion
Brenner stressed that expansion in these
areas will not hinder work on regular
positions in the Senate and the House of
Representatives, which provide the
majority of intern jobs. Brenner said,
however, that the organization will attempt
to dispel the notion that government
internships are available only to an elite
group of white upper middle-class students.
Since Stanford-in-Government is one of
the most liberally-funded programs in the
nation — with annual funds of
approximately $20,000 from alumni
contributions — Brenner feels that through
stipends the program may be able to
accommodate students from all financial
backgrounds. The organization also
emphasizes the importance of involving
minority groups in governmental work.
Programs within the organization provide
special services to Blacks and Chicanos
seeking internships.
Unlike many other student intern
programs, Stanford-in-Government does
not obtain specific positions and then

select students for the jobs on a
competitive basis.
Instead, the program attempts to
provide necessary and useful services to
interested students.
Ten-Year Period
The program first compiles and
dispenses information to applicants
drawing on the experiences of past interns.
Brenner stated that in "using information
gathered over a ten-year period and
updated each year," the program is able to
indicate positions most likely to be
available and those most worth obtaining.
Once the information on potential
positions is distributed, it becomes the
student's responsibility to write to specific
Congressmen and agencies, according to
Brenner.
Stanford-in-Government operates on the
principle that Stanford students themselves
are best able to assert their capabilities and
define their interests, he said.
Lobbying
After a student writes to a Congressman
or agency, Stanford-in-Government lobbies
for him, using resumes written by the
student himself.
Next February, a group of six board

members will fly to Washington to
represent those students desiring
internships. They will visit Congressional
offices and governmental agencies where
students have applied and will lobby for
each student on an individual basis. A
student may apply for more than one
position with a Congressman or agency.
Brenner stated that this lobbying service
is of particular importance to Stanford
students, since they must compete with
students from eastern universities who have
easier access to Washington. This lobbying,
