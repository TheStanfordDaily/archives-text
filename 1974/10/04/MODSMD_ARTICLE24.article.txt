## Grateful Dead Star In Unreleased Film 
### 
Stanford's Memorial Auditorium will be the site of an unusual
film premiere tomorrow when Sunshine Daydream, a movie
about the Grateful Dead, will be shown twice, at 8 and 10 p.m.
Tickets will be $2 for everyone.
Filmed in Oregon at a benefit for writer Ken Kesey's dairy in
Eugene, the movie features the Dead playing some highly
psychedelic music, reminiscent of performances when the Dead
were the Kesey-led Merry Pranksters house band.
Filmmakers Joaquin Villegas and Alan Curtiss then took the
benefit footage and intercut it with old footage of Merry
Pranksters doing their thing on a cross-country bus trip ten years
ago.
The escapades of the Merry Pranksters, for those unfamiliar
with them, are detailed in Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid
Acid Test. Kesey, the Dead and the Merry Pranksters all got
together in the midpeninsula area around Palo Alto-Stanford in
the middle 19605. The film should give students of the Dead in
1974 some idea of the way it was in the beginning.
For example, there's a clip of infamous prankster Neal Cassidy
driving the "magic" bus to the sounds of the Dead playing "I
Know You Rider."
In conjunction with the first public screening of Sunshine
Daydream, KZSU disc jockey Mike Lopez will host a show from
7 to 8 p.m. tonight featuring many unreleased Dead tapes.
Audience comments on the test screening are encouraged,
according to the two filmmakers. The Memorial Auditorium Box
office will open at 6 p.m. for the event.
