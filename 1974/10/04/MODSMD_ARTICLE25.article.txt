# Stanford Gallery Highlights Cambiaso's Italian Artworks
## 
### BARBARA HEINS 
The Stanford Art Gallery has recently opened its
doors with an exhibition of drawings and paintings
by Luca Cambiaso, the great Renaissance artist
considered to be the first truly Geroese artistic
personality.
The exhibition consists of eight paintings and 44
drawings from the collection of Bertina Suida and
Robert Manning. It forms the main focus of their
collection, which is considered the most impressive
private collection of Italian art in this country.
After studying under his father in Genoa,
Cambiaso travelled to Rome where he was greatly
influenced by the work of Michelangelo and
Raphael. From 1550 until the 1580 she worked in
Genoa, executing series of monumental decoration
in Genoese churches and palaces. In 1583
Cambiaso became the court painter to King Philip
II of Spain.
Although he is often classified as a Mannerist,
Luca Cambiaso refused to be strictly bound by the
Mannerist motifs of his time. His work is intensely
human and often quite innovative.
Don't Rush Through
The exhibition in the gallery has to be viewed
deliberately, not hurried through. The drawings are
executed in brown ink over light brown washes.
Despite an economy of line, they are incredibly
alive and sure.

Using a quick pen stroke, Cambiaso finds
expressive contours and gestures that keep the eye
moving and interested in every aspect of the
drawing; moving in and out of space, around and
through forms.
Some of the drawings are saturated with lines
from which figures appear and disappear in the
masses of soft brown and white areas. In others, the
composition is simple, revealing a single figure.
Human Qualities
Above all a strong sense of humor, of human
intimacy and experience is dominant in the
drawings, regardless of their subject matter.
In one particularly beautiful drawing, "Bust of a
Female Figure," the way in which Cambiaso
portrays the face almost negates the work's subject,
ostensibly a marble bust of a woman. The
execution of the face, although extremely simple, is
so expressive that it is hard to imagine it as
portraying a cold marble statue. Cambiaso's skill
and the light brown wash background give the face
a three-dimensionality and aliveness.
Cambiaso's lines are unusually articulate. The
subject matter of the works is religious and
mythical, yet there is no sense of weighty moral
overtones or religious teachings. Instead, they
reveal an enthusiasm and understanding of
humanity. The compositions themselves are not
formal but intimate.

In one work, Venus lies languidly, arm thrust
over her head as if sheilding her eyes from the sun,
as Cupid rests with his head in her lap, arms
flopped sideways.
Cambiaso's two incredibly beautiful renditions
of "Madonna Del Passeggio" are one of the
highlights of the exhibition. Dating from 1560 and
1570 each depicts the Madonna as a contemporary
woman. The earlier work shows her dressed in
peasant clothes in front of a city sky-line. On her
head is a hat with a wide brim. Above it, the faint
halo, is the only indication of her divinity. She is a
woman from Passeggio first, Mother of God,
second.
In another work, "The Visitation," the angel
comes to Mary, not in the quiet garden of Middle
Age interpretations; but amid the bustle and
everyday activity of a hallway. People rush by and
fat women with their children sit gossiping, while
Mary is told her future.
Artistic Diversity
Cambiaso's drawing style undergoes several
changes. In some works the composition is purely
surface with rounded, thin lines. In others, the line
has become flat and angular, and the composition
includes perspective and architecture.
In later works there is a curious cubic rendering
of human forms along with a negation of the
individuality of each. Cambiaso's drawings

command appreciation because of his skill and
draughtsmanship but also because of his versatility
of line and expression.
The eight paintings in the exhibition at first
offer an almost jarring contrast to the intimate
drawings. They seem detached, flat, dead. A strange
thing happens as you pass them the third or fourth
time. A curious warmth seems to grow out of the
paintings, drawing the viewer back to each one.
Religious Subjects
The subject matter of the works is religious,
"The Adoration of the Shepherds," "Saint Anne."
They are surface works â€” the flat background and
lack of deep modelling of paint place the figures on
the frontal plane of the canvas surface and prevent
backward movement into depth which is possible in
the drawings.
The paintings are simple compositionally and
have a very limited color range of variations of
brown, beige and white tonalities with occasional
dulled accent colors. Groups of figures are
half-hidden in darkness with a single light source
illuminating them. This is somehow very
reminiscent of the works of George de La Tour, the
artist of the early 17th century.
The Luca Cambiaso exhibition is an
exceptionally coherent and beautiful show. It will
continue at the Stanford Art Gallery through
October 27.
