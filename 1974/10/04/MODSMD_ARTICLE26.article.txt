# Gillespie Dazzles Audience
## 
### SCOTT GHERINI 
The afficionados, some waiting
for over 90 minutes in line,
received what they had been
patiently waiting for: the piercing
and electrifying show of Dizzy
Gillespie. In what is now an annual
custom, the trumpet artist
returned to the Great American
Music Hall in San Francisco with
his quartet. Gillespie, twenty
pounds heavier around the waist
than he was a year ago, came up to
the city after his show-stealing
performance at the Monterey Jazz
Festival and an impromptu jam
with Milt Jackson at the El
Matador club.
The energized session came as a
surprise especially when one takes
into account that he has been
wailing like he did Friday night
ever since the late thirties.
Diz opened the show with a
couple of pre-sixties numbers and
then moved into his now
predominant Latin-American
songs. The tunes are intensified by
his occasional disport on the
congas, a trip that Dizzy has been
getting more into in his recent
concerts.
Dizzy goes beyond his unerring
musical instinct with his
charismatic style as an entertainer;
a poignant contrast to his subdued
days with the old Teddy Hill
band. While the group performed,
Diz would strut across the stage
bouncing his belly and shaking his
derriere at the audience. Gillespie
radiated his flamboyancy into the
crowd and one couldn't help
liking it.
But the people came to hear
him play and Diz wailed. After a
tightly knit first session the band
let it out into an impassioned and
unrelenting two hour closing set.
The sound is intensified by
Gillespie's "son," John Fetis, a
native of Oakland who emerged
from this year's Newport Jazz
Festival as the trumpeter of the
future.
Fetis is better than believable
and his pulsating solo in
"Summertime" proved it.
Together with Gillespie, the two
overpowered the evening with
updated songs. Fetis is worth
seeing alone by anyone with a
taste for jazz.
