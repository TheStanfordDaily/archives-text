# Haw Blue Can You Get
## Hawes' Jazz In Fine Form 
### Dan Forte 
SAN FRANCISCO - Judging
by his performance Saturday,
Sept. 28 at the Great American
Music Hall, Hampton Hawes'
soon-to-be-released LP, Northern
Windows, should be fantastic.
It is the first album recorded
with his current trio (Carol Kaye
on bass, drummer Spider Webb
and Hawes at piano), and all of
the tunes are originals.
Hawes and the group included
many of the new tunes in their
three sets, beginning with perhaps
the best song of the evening,
"Moses," which has a definite
gospel quality.
Forty-five year old Hawes —
who relates in his autobiography,
Raise Up Off Me, an incident
when the legendary Art Tatum
remarked, "Son, you hot!" — is
without a doubt one of the
premier pianists of modern jazz.
Hawes split his playing half and
half between acoustic and electric
piano, and, while I usually find
electric piano intolerable, he is
one of a very few who can play it
really seriously and musically.
Electric bassist Carol Kaye,
author of countless instruction
manuals (there's even a Carol
Kaye bass pick on the market),
has apparently been persuaded to
finally leave the recording studios,
where she is one of the most
in-demand bassists in jazz.
Her back-up work was fine, as
was Spider Webb's drumming, but
there was a sameness to her solos
after the first few. She is
extremely fast, and perhaps this
contributes to the lack of variety.
The trio excelled in a couple of
Latin numbers, the best of which
was entitled "Sierra Madre."
Hawes' versions of pop tunes

stand a notch above those of
many other jazzmen, because
somehow he can manage to play a
Stevie Wonder or Roberta Flack
song without sounding
"commercial." His entire
repertoire held together perfectly;
no gaps.
The trio closed their first two
sets with compositions by
saxophonist Sonny Rollins; his
calypso "St. Thomas" and
"Playing In The Yard," the title
tune of his latest Prestige LP.
The second set saw Hawes
stretching out more than ever. He
would begin most of the

selections with extended,
unaccompanied introductions in
which he was totally free to play
whatever came to mind.
His solo intro to "Sunny"
included many classical figures,
whereas "Playing In The Yard"
was preceded by chorus after
chorus of fast boogie woogie.
With the Berkeley-based
Fantasy-Prestige-Milestone label
currently cornering the jazz
market, the Bay Area should see a
lot more of the likes of jazzman
Hampton Hawes in the near
future.
