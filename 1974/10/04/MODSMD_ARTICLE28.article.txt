# Weekend Offers Top Shows
## 
### 
If on next Monday anybody
claims that there wasn't anything
to do this weekend at Stanford,
you know he's either kidding or
that he's a freshman pre-med.
Starting off the weekend in
grandiose style, the Preservation
Hall Jazz Band overtakes
Memorial Auditorium tonight for
what promises to be one of their
typically outstanding shows. The
Band has appeared frequently on
campus in the last eight years and
rarely fails to bring a packed
house to its feet.
The Band's concert starts
tonight at 8 p.m., but if previous
shows are any indication (which,
no doubt, they are), early
attendance is recommended.

Tickets are priced at $2.75 for
students, and $4.75 for all others.
Saturday festivities start at
Stanford Stadium, where the
Cards oppose the 3rd ranked
football machine in the nation,
Michigan. After the game, anyone
connected with Stanford is invited
to join in an all-Stanford party at
Marineworld/Africa USA.
The Stanford takeover of
Marineworld/Africa USA lasts
through the late afternoon and
much of the night at a cost of
only $4. Shellback Rose will be
playing at the site.
People who have other things
on their mind Saturday night
might want to make it back to
Memorial Auditorium for either
the 8 or 10 p.m. showing of
Sunshine Daydream, the as-of-yet
unreleased Grateful Dead flick.
Taking into account all the
options available on Saturday
night, Stanford schedulers held
off activities on Sunday morning,
at least until noon.
Joan Baez and Mimi Farina
start their performance at 2 p.m.
in the afternoon, but to
accommodate the expected large
crowds, the gates to Frost
Amphitheatre open at 12 p.m. So
sleep late, get a spot in Frost and
get some more rest in the two
hours before Mimi Farina opens
the show.
If ticket sales follow last year's
patterns, late-comers will be

disappointed in not being able to
get inside Frost. Baez, fresh from
a Latin American tour, will play
only for those lucky ten thousand
or so who got to the
Amphitheatre early.
After the concert, eat, freshen

up and get ready to line up
outside Mem Aud again to get
seats for the Sunday Flicks movie,
Sleeper. Showtimes are at 7 and 9
p.m. and they just might be two
more sellouts in what appears to
be a long string for the weekend.
