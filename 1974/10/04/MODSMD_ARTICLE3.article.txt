# Harmer Takes Lt. Governor Office Today

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - John
Harmer, a Glendale state senator, was
appointed California's 40th lieutenant
governor yesterday by Gov. Ronald
Feagan, who hailed Harmer's "record
of ability."
The 40-year-old Harmer, the
Republican candidate for the post in
the Nov. 5 race, appeared with the
GOP chief executive at a Hilton Hotel
news conference to announce the
appointment.
When Harmer is formally
inaugurated in Los Angeles Friday, he
will assume the No. 2 elected post in
California, replacing Ed Reinecke, who
resigned Wednesday following his
perjury conviction.
Reagan and Harmer, both dressed
in dark suits with American flags on
their lapels, sat side by side while
Reagan praised Harmer to reporters.
No Fix
Both men denied Democratic
contentions that the historic
appointment was an attempt to "fix"
the election. Reagan said the charge as
"ridiculous" and said it would
"hypocritical" for him to name
anyone else.
"Harmer has a demonstrated record
of ability as an elected official, and he
is a man of high moral character,"
Reagan said.
In a Los Angeles appearance later
yesterday, Harmer said, "most of my
political family advised me against
accepting, because we knew it would
be interpreted negatively."
"But that's not the issue," he said
in a brief interview after taping a
debate with his Democratic opponent,
State Sen. Mervyn Dymally. "It would
be inconsistent of me not to accept
when I've been telling people all year
I'm the best qualified candidate for
the job."
Resigned
He also said that upon his
appointment he resigned from his law
firm from which he said he receives
about $10,000 annually.
Harmer, a former Mormon
missionary who will sit on 15 state
boards and commissions in his new
position, said he was "deeply
honored" by the appointment.
"Now, governor, I pledge to you
that I shall endeavor with all the
capacity God gives to me to fill this
responsibility with dignity, integrity
and dedication," Harmer said.
Reagan's selection of Harmer came
as no surprise.
Speculation
As soon as Reinecke said Monday
he had exhausted legal appeals of his
Washington D.C. perjury conviction,
speculation about Reinecke's
replacement zeroed in on Harmer.
Politically, Reagan and Harmer
share many of the same ideas. They
oppose big government growth and
"permissiveness" in society.
