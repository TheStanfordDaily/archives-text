## An Inside Look At SMUT The 						Band: Even Grosser Than You See 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Consider stopping in at
tomorrow's Stanford-Michigan
game. No matter how bad the
carnage on the field, the
Incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
has pledged top-notch
entertainment.
The halftime show, built
around the theme of getting ahead
in America, is "better than
average for us," leered Norm
Halleen, band manager. "A couple
of formations, if you look at them
the right way, are pretty gross."
The pre-game show is also
pretty good, bandsmen said.
Originally it was going to be a
salute to housing, but the Band
decided against a tribute to Larry
Horton, the associate dean in
charge of residential education.
It said HORTON: SUCK ME.
"This has too many letters,"
explained ' Band librarian Whit
Goodrich. "We don't have that
many guys."
Go, Team
Another idea that was tossed
out was a tribute to the football

team. The formation was to say
WIN ONE while the band played
"Someday."
The group of Bandsmen who
devise the halftime and pre-game
shows are known as the Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers, or
SMUT. The acronym is certainly
appropriate.
"We try to get the show to say
something new and yet be totally
inane as a unit," Hallen said.
"We're not very big on doing
salutes to the new law school," he
added, somewhat superfluously.
Drunk
SMUT operates on three levels,
Halleen said. The first, and most
general, involves a large number of
random Bandsmen sitting around
and getting drunk.
"At some meetings we may not
do anything but drink a lot of
beer," Halleen said. "Other times
four or five formations come out
just like that."
The first group comes up with
basic ideas for shows. Then about
a dozen Bandsmen work on
cutting the ideas down to a
manageable size. "They twist a

25-letter spellout into six or seven
letters that mean something,"
Halleen said. Then someone
actually diagrams the formations
so individual bandsmen will know
where to stand.
Topicality is important to the
Band, and this fall events have
moved almost too fast for them.
"All of a sudden all the Nixon
formations are no good, and we
have to do things with Kord,"
Halleen said.
Justice
"On the way to Penn State the
show was going to be about
America's summer
vacation ... By the time we got
back here enough stuff had
happened that we could do a
show on American justice's
summer vacation," he said.
Narration for the shows is left
totally up to the Band's
announcer. "He treats the staff
with no mercy," Halleen said. "He
dumps on all of us. Have you seen
the press releases he puts
out?... They list all of our
names.
"To show how important the
information is, down with all of
our names he had bits of
information like 'The capital of
Arkansas is Little Rock,' stuff like
that."
Tasteful
Good taste and mature
judgement have never exercised a
. restraining influence on the Band.
Halftime shows have dealt with
everything from UCLA running
back James McAlister's gradepoint
average to a "Salute to Puberty"
at last year's Berkeley game.
The latter, Halleen said,
attracted the most complaints of
any since he joined the Band in
1971. It featured a form HI, MEN
as the Band played "Break On
Through." A later formation,
supposedly dealing with skin
problems, said NO PIMP.
A third, Halleen said, showed
"a band grasping a razor, which
looked very much like a guy
beating off." Some alumni
indicated they were
unappreciative.
"They were not so much
appalled by the formations as by
the fact they thought we were
trying to snow them, which we
weren't," Halleen said. "We're not
always subtle."
Not Gross Enough
Sometimes complaints run in
the other direction. "Another
show we did, we got a lot of
complaints from the student
. body," Halleen said. 'They didn't
think it was gross enough."
Some shows ever ih«? years
have been labeled too gross and
will never see the light of day, he
said.
"Even our highly sexual shows
have to have a theme, albeit
little," Halleen said. "We have to
have some way to talk our way
out of it if we get caught."
Among those shows you'll
probably never see at halftime:
—a Bible show, which would
open with the song "Along Comes
Marv" and close with "Hang 'Em
High";
—a Middle East show, with a
formation showing what Halleen
describes as "a crack in the
Ass-wan Dam";
—a Kennedy show, leading
with a formation of a
half-submerged Volkswagen while

the Band plays "Bridge Over
Troubled Waters."
Not On Field
"This [these shows] wouldn't
go on the field," Halleen hastened
to point out.
One show now under
consideration is entitled "Death
and Medicine."
"It's got some bugs in it, so
we're not doing it this week,"
Halleen said. "If we can find a
subtle way to get a wheelchair
onto the field you may see it."
The show, according to several
Bandsmen, includes a formation
on the death of actress Jayne
Mansfield, decapitated in an auto
accident several years ago. It
shows a car between two
suggestively-formed hills as the
Band plays "Another Saturday

Night (And I Ain't Got No
Body)."
In another formation, the Band
salutes former President Richard
Nixon's health by spelling out
CLOT and playing "Killing Me
Softly."
But the Bandsmen point out
the show isn't in its final form yet
and both numbers may be out.
To continually design shows
gross enough to satisfy Stanford
students and yet clean enough to
keep Bandsmen enrolled is a
tough job, Halleen insisted.
"The students are always
saying 'come on, come on, you
can do worse than that,' " he
explained. Every week they
wonder 'What are they going to
do besides the same old cock and
balls routine?' We have to work."

THE ORGANIZATION MAN—Michigan fans have dubbed
quarterback Dennis Franklin with this title. Franklin's a tremendous
QB, but sublimates his whatever desires he has to show off his passing
for the glory of the team.

A CLEAN ONE—The formations you see on the field, such as this
salute to Stanford's tuition (only a year ago, it was a paltry $3135)
are often relatively or even completely clean. But SMUT masterminds,
at their weekly meetings, dream of incredible gross formations.
