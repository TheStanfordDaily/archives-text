# Stanford Prospects Don't Look Bright Against 'Under-Ranked' Michigan
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
It's been years since Stanford
entered a football game with
seemingly less chance to win than
it will here tomorrow.
The Cardinals host Michigan at
1:30 p.m., and if the game is
anything like it was last year,
when the Cards lost 47-10, you'd
better be in your seat or tuned to
KSFO (560) by 1:31 if you want
to see or hear a tie score.
Last season the Cards fumbled,
dropped punts and did everything
possible to get behind 34-0 at the
half, as the Wolverines avenged
the 13-12 Rose Bowl upset of
1972.
If Michigan can, it will show
no mercy this year, either. The
Wolverines are third-ranked in the
UPI poll, fourth-rated by the AP,
and they're mad about it.
"For some reason we don't
rank as high as we think we
should," Michigan SID Will Perry
said. After three big wins, 24-7
over lowa, Colorado 31-0 and
Navy 51-0, a lot of Wolverine fans
think they, not Ohio State, should
be number one. So don't be
surpri- > i f ■ "ipan. if it gets
coi > ran up
the score to impress the selectors.
The Wolverines are led by
maybe the best quarterback in
college football, but one who
probably won't win the Heisman.
Dennis Franklin passes and
runs superbly, and calls the plays
which win. Unfortunately for his
reputation, those plays are usually
rushes, especially by fullback
Chuck Heater. So he's only
thrown 22 passes this season,
completing 16.
Michigan coach Bo
Schembechler calls him " the best
quarterback in college football."
But Franklin, is admittedly an

:irga: i/aiion man, a.to wi
sacrifice All-America status so the
Wolverines can capture that
long-elusive national
championship.
On defense, the Wolverines are
led by such players as Steve
Strinko, who is often called "the
best linebacker against the run in
the country. Stanford recruited
the 6-foot-3, 235-pound Strinko,
and will probably regret his loss
tomorrow.
Strinko and his fellow
behemoths in the defensive front
may force a change in the
Cardinal game plan tomorrow.
Stanford's running game up the
middle hasn't been very effective.

id < lie offensive line isn't likoly
to overwhelm Michigan.
Jerry Waldvogel will direct the
mistake-prone Cards, who haven't
made the big plays in their first
three games. Waldvogel gets his
first shot at the quarterback job
tomorrow.
Waldvogel says, "In some ways,
I'm glad to start against Michigan.
If I do well, I'll get noticed
quickly."
Some cynics think the chances
of Waldvogel's performing well are
analogous to those of the
Christians against the Lions. And
even Waldvogel jokes, "Michigan's
going to have a picnic and I'm
going to be the lunch." But

Waidvogel actually is more
confident than that statement
would indicate.
Stanford's defense, meanwhile,
will face an equally tough chore.
It's probable that Roj»er Stillwell
will see little or no acJon because
of recurring knee problems. And
throwing Duncan McColl into the
lineup against Michigan is like .. .
Michigan will only run a few
plays against Stanford, but,
according to linebacker Gordy
Riegel "what they run they run
well. We'll just have to dig in."
On paper, it looks almost
certain that Stanford will lose,
and wind up its first winless
non-conference season since 1960,
a year when the team didn't win
any games at all.
But remember, Stanford is
known for miracles.
