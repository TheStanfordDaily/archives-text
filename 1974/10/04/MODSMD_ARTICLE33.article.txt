# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
Last week, our fearful
forecaster somehow lucked out
and picked six right, zero
wrong and one tie (the
Stanford <jame). It would be
'unt thv r rip
js a /osi>, but no one eise
does that, we won't do it
either.
But since our picker got a
lucky break when Washington
State forgot to cover an Illinois
receiver in the endzone with
less than one minute to play,
we're still fearful going into
this week's predictions.
Starting with Stanford. The
Cardinals should lose.
Michigan's comparative point
advantage is 57 points
(Michigan 52, Navy 0; Navy 7,
Penn State 6; Penn State 24,
Stanford 20). And even a good
performance by the Cardinals
probably won't win. Hope
we're wrong on this, but. ..
The two Southern

California powers ought to
continue to roll, but there is an
interesting omen. USC was
upset three weeks ago, UCLA
two weeks ago, the Rams last
week â€” does this mean the
Dodgers will fall in the
playoffs?
So far, all the picks have
been of favorites. So now let's
go with an underdog.
California's won two straight,
Illinois is good, all right, but
lucked out last week, fumbling
all over the place. And the
Bears have athletes named
Strickland and Muncie who can
do just about anything.
Predictions
Michigan 28, Stanford 14
USC 23, lowa 7
UCLA 48, Utah 15
Oregon 44, Northwestern 35
SMU 20, Oregon State 10
Texas 39, Washington 19
California 24, Illinois 20
