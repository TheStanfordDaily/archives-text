# Jim Lonborg to Bob Boone
## Ex-Stanford Pre-Meds Succeed As Philly Battery 
### KEVIN SMITH 
PHILADELPHA - Pre-meds
who are worried about the stiff
competition to get into medical
schools can investigate another
option — they can play
professional baseball with the
Philadelpha Phillies.
Two of their former colleagues
are doing just that. Phillies catcher
Bob Boone and Phillies pitcher
Jim Lonborg make up the only
Stanford-grown battery in the
major leagues, but both originally
had visions of surgical gloves
instead of baseball gloves.
Both players have achieved a
good deal of success in the big
leagues. Lonborg achieved the
status of a superstar in 1967,
when he helped catapult the
Boston Red Sox into the World
Series after a ninth place finish in
1966.
In that 1967 season, Lonborg
posted a 22-9 record, struck out
246 batters and easily walked
away with the American League
Cy Young Award. This year, he
was the Phillies most consistent
pitcher, posting a 17-13 record to
tie streaky Steve Carlton for the
club's victory mark.
Boone Coming Up
Boone, in his rookie season last
year, hit .261 with 10 home runs
and finished high in the running
for Rookie of the Year. This year,
he finished a distant second to
Johnny Bench in the balloting for
National League All-Star catcher.
Although he has only hovered
around the .250 mark all season,
Bob was third on the Phillies in
game-winning hits, though batting
in the number eight slot.
A native of San Diego, Boone,
now 26, was the more likely of
the two to become a professional
athlete. "I had an offer out of
high school to play baseball," he
said in an interview last month,
"but came to Stanford on a
baseball-basketball scholarship."
Boone, son of former
big-leaguer Ray Boone, quickly
turned his athletic attention soley
to baseball. "I played basketball
for about five days and found out
it wasn't for me," the 6-foot-2
catcher explained.
Actually, Boone didn't become
a catcher until 1972, when he
made the switch from third base
because of competition in the
Phils' organization there. He likes
the new job, and talked his
brother Rod, a 1971 Stanford
graduate, into donning the
catcher's mask in the Kansas City
Royals' organization.
On Impulse
Boone, who was a psychology
major, said his decision to come
to Stanford "was probably an

impulse. I felt Stanford was the
right place."
He also liked the people in
Stanford's athletic department,
most notably head coach Dutch
Fehring and his frosh coach,
current headman Ray Young.
And, although he devoted a lot
of time to baseball, he said he was
serious about wanting to attend
medical school. "I wasn't just
there to play baseball," he said,
"though I used to wonder when
taking Organic Chem."
But the possibility that the
Phillies catcher will some day be
"Dr. Bob Boone" is slim. "I'm
doing something now that I
enjoy," he said. "It would be too
late by the time I get out [of
baseball]. ... To go to medical
school would require me to
retire."
Lonborg presents a contrast to
Boone both in general demeanor
and in the progression of his
baseball career. While Boone
conveys a scrappy, fun-loving,
effervescent attitude, Lonborg
comes across as being more quiet
and serious — almost scholarly.
But both have an innate
friendliness which offsets their
other differences.
Lonnie's Career
Unlike Boone, Lonborg has
stayed at one position throughout
his baseball career. And also
unlike Boone, he did not have a
professional sports career in mind.
He came to Stanford in 1960
from San Luis Obispo on an
academic scholarship, and
basketball was his major sport. "I
knew that I'd go out and play

baseball too, but at that time I
didn't have as much professional
potential in baseball," he recalled.
The 6-5 Lonborg lasted a little
longer than Boone on the
basketball court — but not much.
He quit basketball after one year
because he was playing behind
Tom Dose, who "went on to set a
scoring record at Stanford."
Besides, Lonnie said, "I had a
very good freshman year [on the
mound]. I got a lot of people out
and got a lot of encouragement
from Ray Young."
Lonborg said he first
considered playing pro baseball
after his sophomore year.
But Jim was still concentrating
on his pre-med studies and his
biology major. "I was still very
concerned about my education at
the time because there wasn't any
indication . .. that I might be able
to play professional baseball," he
said.
That all changed in 1963.
Lonborg played for a South
Dakota team in the Basin League
that summer which really turned
him toward pro ball. "It was just a
tremendous experience," he said.
Fell Into Place
Then things began to fall into
place. "I was getting stronger and
stronger, and I was getting better
stuff all the time, so the Red Sox
offered me a bonus in 1963," he
said. Lonborg came back to
Stanford for two more quarters
during the 1963-1964 school year,
which put him one quarter shy of
graduation. He finished his last
quarter in 1966 by
correspondence.

Strangely, Lonborg said he
feels he's a better pitcher now
than in his super year of 1967. "I
threw everything hard then," he
explained. "I think more in terms
of location now than in terms of
constant velocity. . . This year,
there's more satisfaction in
knowing that what I'm doing will
bring about a desired result."
This change was necessitated in
part by "a couple of sore arms"
which "never returned to the
original strength." He downplayed
his much-celebrated skiing
accident after the 1967 season,
saying this hampered him "only in
the sense that I might have tried
to come back too soon
afterwards."
Neither Boone nor Lonborg
said they were disturbed by the
fact that Stanford baseball does
not receive the attention or the
crowds of football, basketball and
tennis.
"We always drew well," Boone

said. "You don't really get the big
crowds until you get to the major
leagues." Besides, he added, the
Stanford baseball program "was
tremendous." The Stanford team
Boone played on went to the
College World Series in 1967.
Bob said he has no definite
plans for retirement. "I'm
constantly trying to do things that
I learn something at," he said.
"I'm not worried about it."
Lonnie, meanwhile, is putting
his Stanford biology degree to
good use. "I do some work in
hospitals now . . . trying to learn
administrative technique in the
off-season." He wind up
either in hospital administration
or in the administration side of
baseball.
So the pre-med success
syndrome continues in them.
Neither Boone or Lonborg
actually went to medical school
but baseball gave each a shot in
the arm.
