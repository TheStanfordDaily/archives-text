Senate Nears Tapes Decision
WASHINGTON — The Senate pushed toward a final
vote yesterday on a bill to assure the public and courts full
access to Richard M. Nixon's White House tapes and papers.
By voice vote, senators adopted a resolution urging
President Gerald Ford to do what he could to make public
all the facts about the Watergate scandal, including any
relevant documents from Nixon's five and a half years in
office.
But the big battle was over the bill giving the federal
government custody and control of the tapes and papers, a
measure designed to overturn an arrangement Nixon
worked out with the Ford administration before he was
pardoned last month.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Gaylord Nelson, (D-Wis.),
was prompted by a provision in the Nixon-Ford agreement
that would allow the former president to destroy the papers
after three years and the tapes after five years. In case of
Nixon's death the tapes would be destroyed immediately.
"Destruction of these materials would conceal forever
the truth about the Watergate scandals," said Nelson. "Our
generation and future generations would thus be unable to
learn exactly what happened and why."
Nixon Requests Testimony Exemption
WASHINGTON — Lawyers for Richard M. Nixon asked
yesterday that the former president be excused from
testifying in the Watergate coverup trial.
U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica said he woudl
postpone until a jury is selected any decision on whether
Nixon would be compelled to appear.
The judge predicted the 12 jurors and six alternates
might be chosen by Monday or Tuesday.
The jury selection process continued yesterday at a
snail's pace, however. Sirica interviewed only 10 persons
over a period lasting more than six hours. He is attempting
to find enough people unbiased by Watergate publicity.
Five persons were accepted by Sirica and defense and
prosecution lawyers. But they must still survive the third
phase, in which the lawyers can eliminate them as jurors
without saying why.
British Voters Still Undecided
LONDON — Britain began the final week of its election
campaign yesterday with public opinion polls showing
many voters still undecided.
Politicians insist public interest in the Oct. 10 election
for a new House of Commons is as high as it was in the
election last February, when 78.8 percent of the voters
participated.
But public opinion polls show significant numbers who
either say they will not vote or have not yet made up their
minds.
Among the decided voters polled, the Labor party holds
a clear lead. Three polls published yesterday put Labor
ahead of the Conservatives by nine percent, eight and a half
percent and seven and a half percent. The Liberals got
about 20 percent of the total.
U.S. Crime Rate Up 16%
WASHINGTON — The FBI yesterday reported another

dramatic increase in the nation's crime rate. Atty. Gen.
William B. Saxbe called the trend disturbing.
The increase demonstrated that the upward spiral which
began in late 1973 has continued unabated.
The FBI figures showed serious crime increased 16
percent during the first six months of 1974. Crime
decreased one percent during the same periods in 1973 and
1972. The 1974 figures showed increases in all seven crime
categories measured by the FBI Uniform Crime Reports.
Earthquake Strikes Central Peru
LIMA, Peru — An earthquake shook central Peru
yesterday, causing extensive damage and killing at least 40
persons while injuring 1000 others, government officials
said.
The quake struck during the morning rush hour, causing
widespread panic. The initial tremor lasted about two
minutes, and a string of aftershocks followed.
Officials said the quake was centered about 120 miles
south of Lima. There was considerable damage in and
around the capital of Lima where at least 200 persons were
reported injured, many of them suffering from shock.
Cliff Barnett, director of the Stanford program in Lima,
said last night that all students in the program were
unharmed and that the University had so advised all
parents.
Italian Government Collapses
ROME — Italy's government collapsed again last night in
a crisis over acute economic problems and a strong
Communist bid for a share of power.
Premier Mario Rumor, who headed a center-left
coalition, submitted his resignation to President Giovanni
Leone. Leone asked Rumor to stay on as a caretaker
premier until elections can be held.
It was the 36th Italian government to fall since the end
of World War 11. Rumor's cabinet submitted its resignation
in June, but Leone that time refused to accept it, forcing
the premier to stay on.
Nobel Award Arouses Criticism
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — The award of the 1974 Nobel
Prize for Literature to two relatively unknown Swedish
authors touched off immediate criticism last night in
Swedish literary circles.
While authors Harry Martinson and Eyvind Johnson are
"important writers," the decision to award them the prize
was "disastrous," said fellow author and critic Sven
Delblanc.
"The rest of the international prestige miraculously
retained by the prize will be wiped out by laughter and
derision around the globe," he said.
Delblanc said there was "no strong international opinion
speaking for them and the choice shows lack of judgment."
The two, acclaimed at home but little known abroad,
share an award worth about $124,000.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but variable low clouds
night and morning. Little temperature change. Low both
nights in the 50s. High today and tomorrow in the mid 60s
to mid 70s. West to northwest winds 10 to 20 mph
afternoons.

Mostly fair through tomorrow but variable low clouds

nights in the 50s. High today and tomorrow in the mid 60s
to mid 70s. West to northwest winds 10 to 20 mph
afternoons.
Senate Nears Tapes Decision
WASHINGTON — The Senate pushed toward a final
vote yesterday on a bill to assure the public and courts full
access to Richard M. Nixon's White House tapes and papers.
By voice vote, senators adopted a resolution urging
President Gerald Ford to do what he could to make public
all the facts about the Watergate scandal, including any
relevant documents from Nixon's five and a half years in
office.
But the big battle was over the bill giving the federal
government custody and control of the tapes and papers, a
measure designed to overturn an arrangement Nixon
worked out with the Ford administration before he was
pardoned last month.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Gaylord Nelson, (D-Wis.),
was prompted by a provision in the Nixon-Ford agreement
that would allow the former president to destroy the papers
after three years and the tapes after five years. In case of
Nixon's death the tapes would be destroyed immediately.
"Destruction of these materials would conceal forever
the truth about the Watergate scandals," said Nelson. "Our
generation and future generations would thus be unable to
learn exactly what happened and why."
Nixon Requests Testimony Exemption
WASHINGTON — Lawyers for Richard M. Nixon asked
yesterday that the former president be excused from
testifying in the Watergate coverup trial.
U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica said he woudl
postpone until a jury is selected any decision on whether
Nixon would be compelled to appear.
The judge predicted the 12 jurors and six alternates
might be chosen by Monday or Tuesday.
The jury selection process continued yesterday at a
snail's pace, however. Sirica interviewed only 10 persons
over a period lasting more than six hours. He is attempting
to find enough people unbiased by Watergate publicity.
Five persons were accepted by Sirica and defense and
prosecution lawyers. But they must still survive the third
phase, in which the lawyers can eliminate them as jurors
without saying why.
British Voters Still Undecided
LONDON — Britain began the final week of its election
campaign yesterday with public opinion polls showing
many voters still undecided.
Politicians insist public interest in the Oct. 10 election
for a new House of Commons is as high as it was in the
election last February, when 78.8 percent of the voters
participated.
But public opinion polls show significant numbers who
either say they will not vote or have not yet made up their
minds.
Among the decided voters polled, the Labor party holds
a clear lead. Three polls published yesterday put Labor
ahead of the Conservatives by nine percent, eight and a half
percent and seven and a half percent. The Liberals got
about 20 percent of the total.
U.S. Crime Rate Up 16%
WASHINGTON — The FBI yesterday reported another

dramatic increase in the nation's crime rate. Atty. Gen.
William B. Saxbe called the trend disturbing.
The increase demonstrated that the upward spiral which
began in late 1973 has continued unabated.
The FBI figures showed serious crime increased 16
percent during the first six months of 1974. Crime
decreased one percent during the same periods in 1973 and
1972. The 1974 figures showed increases in all seven crime
categories measured by the FBI Uniform Crime Reports.
Earthquake Strikes Central Peru
LIMA, Peru — An earthquake shook central Peru
yesterday, causing extensive damage and killing at least 40
persons while injuring 1000 others, government officials
said.
The quake struck during the morning rush hour, causing
widespread panic. The initial tremor lasted about two
minutes, and a string of aftershocks followed.
Officials said the quake was centered about 120 miles
south of Lima. There was considerable damage in and
around the capital of Lima where at least 200 persons were
reported injured, many of them suffering from shock.
Cliff Barnett, director of the Stanford program in Lima,
said last night that all students in the program were
unharmed and that the University had so advised all
parents.
Italian Government Collapses
ROME — Italy's government collapsed again last night in
a crisis over acute economic problems and a strong
Communist bid for a share of power.
Premier Mario Rumor, who headed a center-left
coalition, submitted his resignation to President Giovanni
Leone. Leone asked Rumor to stay on as a caretaker
premier until elections can be held.
It was the 36th Italian government to fall since the end
of World War 11. Rumor's cabinet submitted its resignation
in June, but Leone that time refused to accept it, forcing
the premier to stay on.
Nobel Award Arouses Criticism
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — The award of the 1974 Nobel
Prize for Literature to two relatively unknown Swedish
authors touched off immediate criticism last night in
Swedish literary circles.
While authors Harry Martinson and Eyvind Johnson are
"important writers," the decision to award them the prize
was "disastrous," said fellow author and critic Sven
Delblanc.
"The rest of the international prestige miraculously
retained by the prize will be wiped out by laughter and
derision around the globe," he said.
Delblanc said there was "no strong international opinion
speaking for them and the choice shows lack of judgment."
The two, acclaimed at home but little known abroad,
share an award worth about $124,000.

retained by the prize will be wiped out by laughter and
derision around the globe," he said.
Delblanc said there was "no strong international opinion
speaking for them and the choice shows lack of judgment."
The two, acclaimed at home but little known abroad,
share an award worth about $124,000.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but variable low clouds
night and morning. Little temperature change. Low both
nights in the 50s. High today and tomorrow in the mid 60s
to mid 70s. West to northwest winds 10 to 20 mph
afternoons.
Senate Nears Tapes Decision
WASHINGTON — The Senate pushed toward a final
vote yesterday on a bill to assure the public and courts full
access to Richard M. Nixon's White House tapes and papers.
By voice vote, senators adopted a resolution urging
President Gerald Ford to do what he could to make public
all the facts about the Watergate scandal, including any
relevant documents from Nixon's five and a half years in
office.
But the big battle was over the bill giving the federal
government custody and control of the tapes and papers, a
measure designed to overturn an arrangement Nixon
worked out with the Ford administration before he was
pardoned last month.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Gaylord Nelson, (D-Wis.),
was prompted by a provision in the Nixon-Ford agreement
that would allow the former president to destroy the papers
after three years and the tapes after five years. In case of
Nixon's death the tapes would be destroyed immediately.
"Destruction of these materials would conceal forever
the truth about the Watergate scandals," said Nelson. "Our
generation and future generations would thus be unable to
learn exactly what happened and why."
Nixon Requests Testimony Exemption
WASHINGTON — Lawyers for Richard M. Nixon asked
yesterday that the former president be excused from
testifying in the Watergate coverup trial.
U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica said he woudl
postpone until a jury is selected any decision on whether
Nixon would be compelled to appear.
The judge predicted the 12 jurors and six alternates
might be chosen by Monday or Tuesday.
The jury selection process continued yesterday at a
snail's pace, however. Sirica interviewed only 10 persons
over a period lasting more than six hours. He is attempting
to find enough people unbiased by Watergate publicity.
Five persons were accepted by Sirica and defense and
prosecution lawyers. But they must still survive the third
phase, in which the lawyers can eliminate them as jurors
without saying why.
British Voters Still Undecided
LONDON — Britain began the final week of its election
campaign yesterday with public opinion polls showing
many voters still undecided.
Politicians insist public interest in the Oct. 10 election
for a new House of Commons is as high as it was in the
election last February, when 78.8 percent of the voters
participated.
But public opinion polls show significant numbers who
either say they will not vote or have not yet made up their
minds.
Among the decided voters polled, the Labor party holds
a clear lead. Three polls published yesterday put Labor
ahead of the Conservatives by nine percent, eight and a half
percent and seven and a half percent. The Liberals got
about 20 percent of the total.
U.S. Crime Rate Up 16%
WASHINGTON — The FBI yesterday reported another

dramatic increase in the nation's crime rate. Atty. Gen.
William B. Saxbe called the trend disturbing.
The increase demonstrated that the upward spiral which
began in late 1973 has continued unabated.
The FBI figures showed serious crime increased 16
percent during the first six months of 1974. Crime
decreased one percent during the same periods in 1973 and
1972. The 1974 figures showed increases in all seven crime
categories measured by the FBI Uniform Crime Reports.
Earthquake Strikes Central Peru
LIMA, Peru — An earthquake shook central Peru
yesterday, causing extensive damage and killing at least 40
persons while injuring 1000 others, government officials
said.
The quake struck during the morning rush hour, causing
widespread panic. The initial tremor lasted about two
minutes, and a string of aftershocks followed.
Officials said the quake was centered about 120 miles
south of Lima. There was considerable damage in and
around the capital of Lima where at least 200 persons were
reported injured, many of them suffering from shock.
Cliff Barnett, director of the Stanford program in Lima,
said last night that all students in the program were
unharmed and that the University had so advised all
parents.
Italian Government Collapses
ROME — Italy's government collapsed again last night in
a crisis over acute economic problems and a strong
Communist bid for a share of power.
Premier Mario Rumor, who headed a center-left
coalition, submitted his resignation to President Giovanni
Leone. Leone asked Rumor to stay on as a caretaker
premier until elections can be held.
It was the 36th Italian government to fall since the end
of World War 11. Rumor's cabinet submitted its resignation
in June, but Leone that time refused to accept it, forcing
the premier to stay on.
Nobel Award Arouses Criticism
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — The award of the 1974 Nobel
Prize for Literature to two relatively unknown Swedish
authors touched off immediate criticism last night in
Swedish literary circles.
While authors Harry Martinson and Eyvind Johnson are
"important writers," the decision to award them the prize
was "disastrous," said fellow author and critic Sven
Delblanc.
"The rest of the international prestige miraculously
retained by the prize will be wiped out by laughter and
derision around the globe," he said.
Delblanc said there was "no strong international opinion
speaking for them and the choice shows lack of judgment."
