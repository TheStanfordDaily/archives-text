The value of mental health coverage
in a national health insurance program
was questioned at a panel discussion
sponsored by the Mental Health
Associations of San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties in cooperation with the
psychology department last night in
Memorial Auditorium.
"This is an idea whose
time ... should have come 20 to 30
years ago," said the main speaker,
Hilda Robbins, co-chairwoman of the
Public Affairs Committee of the
National Association for Mental
Health.
Robbins asserted that the Medicare
and MedicAid systems were
"antiquated [ones] centered around a
hospital delivery system," with
discrimination against mental health
written into both programs.
"This must end," said Robbins,
[and] "the time to make those
corrections is in writing the
legislation."
Suggestions
The National Association for
Mental Health reported Robbins, has
suggested that among other things
national health insurance include
coverage for unlimited use of facilities
for outpatients, a limit on inpatient
treatment, a wide range of services for
children, and citizen boards with
control over delivery of services.

Dr. Melvin Brown, vice president of
the Mental Health Association of San
Mateo county expressed doubts about
a national health insurance program.
"It's different, but not necessarily a
better system," said Brown.
An insurance program is written
pragmatically, with an eye on keeping
costs as low as possible, Brown noted.
"What's this have to do with the needs
of the people?"
"[The insurance program] is trying
to assign a system that meets the needs
of the insurance company, not the
needs of the patient," agreed Dr.
George Pickett, director of health and
welfare in San Mateo county.
Fears
Both Pickett and Brown voiced
fears that a national program would
interfere with the doctor-patient
relationship. Limitations on time in
the hospital, on amounts and types of
treatments amount to
"pre-prescriptions that tie the doctor,"
said Brown.
Outpatient care is not necessarily
cheaper than inpatient care, added
Pickett.
Allocation of funds to communities
to cover local problems could be the
answer, agreed Brown and Pickett.
"The problem is not one of dollars
— we can provide dollars," said Bill
Whipple, general agent for the
