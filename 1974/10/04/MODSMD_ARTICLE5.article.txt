# Death Defined
## Heart Program Survives Law 
### ROSARIO DE LA TORRE 
California's recently amended state
law defining death as the "total
cessation of brain function" will not
affect the number of heart transplants
performed at the Stanford Medical
Center, according to Dr. Ronald
Griepp, assistant professor of
cardiovascular surgery.
Currently, Stanford has the only
active heart transplant program in the
country, performing about one
transplant per month.
The law should end the controversy
caused by several court battles
regarding the actual time of death. The
controversy reduced the number of

available organ donors because doctors
were reluctant to suggest donors for
fear of being prosecuted.
Lois Christopherson, chief social
worker in surgery, works with the
families of organ donors. She feels the
law will have a positive effect on
physicians and the number of donors
will soon increase.
Kidney Transplants
The law will have a more
pronounced affect on kidney
transplants, which are more common.
"The law will make more kidneys
available to centers with active kidney
transplantation programs, such as the
University of California hospitals,"
Griepp said.
The law will also make it easier to
use homicide victims as donors. After
brain death has been determined by
physicians not involved with the
transplant, organs may be removed.
The county coronor must also approve
removal of the organs.
The law will not have any effect on
Stanford policy regarding transplants.
"Our policy concerning transplant
cases has always been that three
independant neurosurgeons, not a part
of the transplant operation, must
establish brain death before any organs
can be removed," Griepp said.
The statute itself does not establish
the actual criteria for determining
brain death. "A person may be
pronounced dead if, based on usual
and customary standards of medical
practice, it is determined that the
person has suffered an irreversable
cessation of brain function," the
statute reads.
Flexible Criteria
The law was written this way so the
criteria for determining brain death
may keep up with scientific advances.
"As more is learned about the brain
and its function, a more precise
method of determining brain death
may be discovered," Griepp added.
The currently accepted criteria for
brain death, established by an ad hoc
committee of the Harvard Medical
School in 1968, are: a lack of response
to stimulation, no movement or
spontaneous breathing for at least one
hour, no reflexes and a flat
electroencephalogram (EEG).
California is the fourth state to
adopt a brain death statute, following
Kansas, Maryland and Minnesota.
Christopherson feels the adoption of

the statute in California is important
because the state is recognized as a
leader in the field of transplants.
Both Griepp and Christopherson
agree the legislation is overdue. "The
courts have already set a precedent
regarding brain death and the new law
will clear the air once and for all,"
Griepp said.
Griepp feels a law of this kind
would meet with strong opposition on
a national level. "It's just too
controversial," he said. "It would be
easier to leave it up to each individual
state to decide what it needs."
