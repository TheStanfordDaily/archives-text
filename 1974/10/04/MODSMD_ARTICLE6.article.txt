# Lecture Note Service Begins To Take Shape
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The ASSU Lecture Note Service, an
idea which has been kicking around
for at least five years, began to take
shape yesterday as ASSU President
Mike Herman announced the
appointment of Vic Petroff as the
service's director.
Petroff expressed confidence that
the new program will begin operations
this winter quarter.
Each professor must approve of the
service before any of his classes can be
covered, and no professor has
approved of the service yet, Herman
admitted.
Still, letters to professors
introducing the service were mailed
only two days ago, Petroff said, adding
that 16 classes had been chosen for
coverage winter quarter.
No Time
"I do not think the program will
take a substantial amount of my time
to get it off the ground," he saod.
The service is designed to provide

low-cost lecture notes to students in
classes here, giving them an increased
opportunity to listen to lectures and
grasp the main points, Herman
explained.
"However, the service is not
supposed to be a substitute for student
notes, rather to be a supplament to
them," he added.
Responding to criticism that the
service would increase the likelihood
of student absenteeism, Herman cited
statistics from a similiar program at
UCLA.
UCLA Okay
"In the classes studied at UCLA,
there was no noticable difference in
absenteeism between classes with
notes and those without," he said.
Generally a Stanford student "is
not the type of person that will allow
someone to take a class for him,"
Petroff added.
James Gibbs, undergraduate dean,
has given his support to the project
and the University has not voiced any
objection, according to Herman.
All classes chosen for the pilot
program had an enrollment of more
than 200 last spring. Most of the
classes are in the natural sciences.
At Least 57
The average number of student
subscribers to the non-profit program
must be at least 57 for the program to
make money, according to Petroff.
Most of the costs for the program
are for a mimeograph machine (about
$1300) and an electronic stencilmaker
(about $1500). Labor, distribution,
and advertising represent the other
costs.
Students will be interviewed and
chosen by Petroff for the notetaking
position sometime this quarter. To be
a notetaker, each candidate must have

subject to be covered;
—an A in the course previously;
—and obtained approval of the
professor teaching the course.
Printing
Other students will be hired to
handle printing and distribution of the
lecture notes which will be handed out
in the ASSU office in Tresidder Union.
Students should apply there for all
positions.
Copyrighting of a professor's
lectures will be done at the professor's
request so that no legal problems arise,
Herman noted.
"Over the last five years, every
Council of Presidents has suggested the

possibility of having a lecture note
service, but we are the first to follow
through with our plans," he said.
Last spring, the Herman slate ran
on a campaign platform that stressed
the need for student services.
The lecture note service will be free
at least for the first week of the
quarter, in order to give students a
chance to examine the quality of the
notes, Herman added.
But rates for the service have
already been set. Students must
subscribe for an entire quarter —$4 for
courses that meet two hours a week,
$6 for courses that meet three hours a
week and $8 for courses that meet
four hours a week.
