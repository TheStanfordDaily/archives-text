# Robinson: Baseball's First Black Manager
## 
### 
CLEVELAND (AP) - Frank
Robinson, smiling, jovial and
proud, was named baseball's first
black manager yesterday, but said
he hoped he would not be classified
by the color of his skin.
"I want to be judged by my
expertise on the field," Robinson
said after the Cleveland Indians
made it official that he would be
the club's 1975 field manager.
"I was born bfack and now that
I'm a manager, I guess I have to be
a black manager," said Robinson,
the only man to be named Most
Valuable Player in both the
American and National leagues.
Robinson replaces Ken
Aspromonte, who was fired.
Robinson will be a playing manager
and most likely will use himself as a
designated hitter.
600 Homers?
"I really wanted to get my 20th
year as a player in," he said. "I'd
like to go for 3000 hits and 600
home runs."
He needs 26 homers and 100
hits to reach those goals.
Robinson signed a one-year
contract for $180,000.
"I originally thought a
multi-year contract was the most
important thing to me," Robinson
said. "But I'm hoping that my
performance will be my assurance

for another contract after this
year."
Speech
Robinson was flanked by
Indians General Manager Phil Seghi,
President Nick Mileti and Executive
Vice President Ted Bonda during a
10- minute off-the-cuff acceptance
speech and a question and answer
session.
Baseball Commissioner Bowie
Kuhn, American League President
Lee MacPhail and Robinson's wife
Barbara sat to one side during the
conference.
"To say that this is a proud day
for me would be an
understatement," Robinson said.
Sentimental
Only once did he become
sentimental:
"If I had one wish in the world
today, that wish would be to have
Jackie Robinson here to see this
happen."
Jackie Robinson, who was no
relation to Frank, became the
major leagues' first black baseball
player in 1947. He died in 1972.
"I don't think 1 could have
stood the pressure or have gone
through what Jackie had to," said
Frank, who broke a 105-year
baseball tradition of white field
bosses.

I'm a manager, I guess I have to be
a black manager," said Robinson,
the only man to be named Most
Valuable Player in both the
American and National leagues.
Robinson replaces Ken
Aspromonte, who was fired.
Robinson will be a playing manager
and most likely will use himself as a
designated hitter.
600 Homers?
"I really wanted to get my 20th
year as a player in," he said. "I'd
like to go for 3000 hits and 600
home runs."
He needs 26 homers and 100
hits to reach those goals.
Robinson signed a one-year
contract for $180,000.
"I originally thought a
multi-year contract was the most
important thing to me," Robinson
said. "But I'm hoping that my
performance will be my assurance

for another contract after this
year."
Speech
Robinson was flanked by
Indians General Manager Phil Seghi,
President Nick Mileti and Executive
Vice President Ted Bonda during a
10- minute off-the-cuff acceptance
speech and a question and answer
session.
Baseball Commissioner Bowie
Kuhn, American League President
Lee MacPhail and Robinson's wife
Barbara sat to one side during the
conference.
"To say that this is a proud day
for me would be an
understatement," Robinson said.
Sentimental
Only once did he become
sentimental:
"If I had one wish in the world
today, that wish would be to have
Jackie Robinson here to see this
happen."
Jackie Robinson, who was no
relation to Frank, became the
major leagues' first black baseball
player in 1947. He died in 1972.
"I don't think 1 could have
stood the pressure or have gone
through what Jackie had to," said
Frank, who broke a 105-year
baseball tradition of white field
bosses.
CLEVELAND (AP) - Frank
Robinson, smiling, jovial and
proud, was named baseball's first
black manager yesterday, but said
he hoped he would not be classified
by the color of his skin.
"I want to be judged by my
expertise on the field," Robinson
said after the Cleveland Indians
made it official that he would be
the club's 1975 field manager.
"I was born bfack and now that
I'm a manager, I guess I have to be
a black manager," said Robinson,
