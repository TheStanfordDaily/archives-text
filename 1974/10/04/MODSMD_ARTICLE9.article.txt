It is not widely known yet, but
former President Richard Nixon
had assembled one hell of an
impeachment defense before he
resigned the Presidency. I became
aware of this when one of my
sources in the San Clemen te
fortress (hereafter to be referred
to as "Green Door" to preserve
his anonymity) provided me with
exclusive briefs which presidential
defense attorney James St. Clair
was prepared to submit at a
Senate trial.
The briefs, according to Green
Door, explain crucial portions of
the White House tapes in such a
way as to "thoroughly,
conclusively, and unequivocally
exonerate the President of any
involvement in the Watergate
affair — or any illicit affair, for
that matter, in which the
President has been accused of
covering-up or not having gone
the hang-out route." Excerpts are
printed below.
President: Now let me make this
clear ... I don't give a shit
what happens. I want you all
to stonewall it, let them plead
the sth Amendment, coverup
or anything else, if it'll save it
— save the plan ... Up to this
point the whole theory has
been containment, as you
know John.
Mitchell: Yeah.
President: That's the thing I'm
really concerned with. We're
going to protect our people if
we can.
Foreign Policy
We find in this remarkable
passage an example of Nixon
foreign policy in action. The
President pledged his continued
support to the sound world
communist containment policies
of President Truman and Dean
Acheson; he didn't give a shit
what happened as long as the
spirit of the Truman Doctrine was
continued. The President's
purpose, of course, was not only
to "protect our people" — the
American people — but also free
people everywhere from the
possibility of Communist
takeovers.
Viewed in this light, the
following discussion of the
President with John Dean on
March 21, 1973, falls neatly into
place.
President: John, you had the right
plan, let me say, I have no
doubts about the right plan
before the election. And you
handled it just right. You
contained it. Now after the
election we've got to have
another plan.
The President hints in this
passage that certain modifications

may have to be made in the
Truman/Acheson containment
policy to accommodate the new
policy of "negotiation and not
confrontation." The new plan
referred to is a replacement for
the now famous "secret plan"
with which the President brought
peace with honor to Vietnam.
And Watergate?
In the course of the March 21
conversation, the topic switched
briefly to Watergate. Dean said as
an afterthought that Watergate
conspirator E. Howard Hunt was
demanding $120,000 for his
continued silence. The President,
as H.R. Haldeman indicated in his
testimony before the Watergate
committee, clearly and
unambiguously prohibited any
hush money payments to Hunt
and said they would be wrong.
President: That's why your, for
your immediate thing you've
got no choice with Hunt but
the hundred and twenty or
whatever it is. Right?
Dean: That's right.
President: Would you agree that
that's a buy time thing, you
better damn well get that done
but fast?
Dean: I think he ought to be given
some signal, anyway, to, to—
President: Yes.
Dean: Yeah — you know.
President: Well for Christ's sakes,
get it...
Firm Order
At the conclusion of the
conversation, the President
ordered his aides to appear before
a new Grand Jury so they could
testify as to their involvement in
Watergate. Nixon was particularly
concerned with getting the full
story before the public, wherever
it led, whomever it involved, and
whatever cost there would be to
the administration.
President: And that means, we got
to, we've got to keep it off
you, uh, which I
(unintelligible) obstruction of
justice thing. We've got to keep
it off Ehrlichman. We've got to
keep it, naturally, off of Bob,
off Chapin, if possible, and
Strachan. Right?
Dean: Uh huh.
President: The Grand Jury appeals
to me from the standpoint, it's
the President makes the move
... That's the place to do it,
and not before a committee of
Congress. Right?
Dean: Uh huh.
President: God, we can't risk that,
I mean, uh, all sorts of shit'll
break loose there.

some signal, anyway, to, to—
President: Yes.
Dean: Yeah — you know.
President: Well for Christ's sakes,
get it...
Firm Order
At the conclusion of the
conversation, the President
ordered his aides to appear before
a new Grand Jury so they could
testify as to their involvement in
Watergate. Nixon was particularly
concerned with getting the full
story before the public, wherever
it led, whomever it involved, and
whatever cost there would be to
the administration.
President: And that means, we got
to, we've got to keep it off
you, uh, which I
(unintelligible) obstruction of
justice thing. We've got to keep
it off Ehrlichman. We've got to
keep it, naturally, off of Bob,
off Chapin, if possible, and
Strachan. Right?
Dean: Uh huh.
President: The Grand Jury appeals
to me from the standpoint, it's
the President makes the move
... That's the place to do it,
and not before a committee of
Congress. Right?
Dean: Uh huh.
President: God, we can't risk that,
I mean, uh, all sorts of shit'll
break loose there.

It is not widely known yet, but
former President Richard Nixon
had assembled one hell of an
impeachment defense before he
resigned the Presidency. I became
aware of this when one of my
sources in the San Clemen te
fortress (hereafter to be referred
to as "Green Door" to preserve
his anonymity) provided me with
exclusive briefs which presidential
defense attorney James St. Clair
was prepared to submit at a
Senate trial.
The briefs, according to Green
Door, explain crucial portions of
the White House tapes in such a
way as to "thoroughly,
conclusively, and unequivocally
exonerate the President of any
involvement in the Watergate
affair — or any illicit affair, for
that matter, in which the
President has been accused of
covering-up or not having gone
the hang-out route." Excerpts are
printed below.
President: Now let me make this
clear ... I don't give a shit
what happens. I want you all
to stonewall it, let them plead
the sth Amendment, coverup
or anything else, if it'll save it
— save the plan ... Up to this
point the whole theory has
been containment, as you
know John.
Mitchell: Yeah.
President: That's the thing I'm
really concerned with. We're
going to protect our people if
we can.
Foreign Policy
We find in this remarkable
passage an example of Nixon
foreign policy in action. The
President pledged his continued
support to the sound world
communist containment policies
of President Truman and Dean
Acheson; he didn't give a shit
what happened as long as the
spirit of the Truman Doctrine was
continued. The President's
purpose, of course, was not only
to "protect our people" — the
American people — but also free
people everywhere from the
possibility of Communist
takeovers.
Viewed in this light, the
following discussion of the
President with John Dean on
March 21, 1973, falls neatly into
place.
President: John, you had the right
plan, let me say, I have no
doubts about the right plan
before the election. And you
handled it just right. You
contained it. Now after the
election we've got to have
another plan.
The President hints in this
passage that certain modifications

may have to be made in the
Truman/Acheson containment
policy to accommodate the new
policy of "negotiation and not
confrontation." The new plan
referred to is a replacement for
the now famous "secret plan"
with which the President brought
peace with honor to Vietnam.
And Watergate?
In the course of the March 21
conversation, the topic switched
briefly to Watergate. Dean said as
an afterthought that Watergate
conspirator E. Howard Hunt was
demanding $120,000 for his
continued silence. The President,
as H.R. Haldeman indicated in his
testimony before the Watergate
committee, clearly and
unambiguously prohibited any
hush money payments to Hunt
and said they would be wrong.
President: That's why your, for
your immediate thing you've
got no choice with Hunt but
the hundred and twenty or
whatever it is. Right?
Dean: That's right.
President: Would you agree that
that's a buy time thing, you
better damn well get that done
but fast?
Dean: I think he ought to be given
some signal, anyway, to, to—
President: Yes.
Dean: Yeah — you know.
President: Well for Christ's sakes,

before the election. And you
handled it just right. You
contained it. Now after the
election we've got to have
another plan.
The President hints in this
passage that certain modifications

may have to be made in the
Truman/Acheson containment
policy to accommodate the new
policy of "negotiation and not
confrontation." The new plan
referred to is a replacement for
the now famous "secret plan"
with which the President brought
peace with honor to Vietnam.
And Watergate?
In the course of the March 21
conversation, the topic switched
briefly to Watergate. Dean said as
an afterthought that Watergate
conspirator E. Howard Hunt was
demanding $120,000 for his
continued silence. The President,
as H.R. Haldeman indicated in his
testimony before the Watergate
committee, clearly and
unambiguously prohibited any
hush money payments to Hunt
and said they would be wrong.
President: That's why your, for
your immediate thing you've
got no choice with Hunt but
the hundred and twenty or
whatever it is. Right?
Dean: That's right.
President: Would you agree that
that's a buy time thing, you
better damn well get that done
but fast?
Dean: I think he ought to be given
some signal, anyway, to, to—
President: Yes.
Dean: Yeah — you know.
President: Well for Christ's sakes,
get it...
Firm Order
At the conclusion of the
conversation, the President
ordered his aides to appear before
a new Grand Jury so they could
testify as to their involvement in
Watergate. Nixon was particularly
concerned with getting the full
story before the public, wherever
it led, whomever it involved, and
whatever cost there would be to
the administration.
President: And that means, we got
to, we've got to keep it off
you, uh, which I
(unintelligible) obstruction of
justice thing. We've got to keep
it off Ehrlichman. We've got to
keep it, naturally, off of Bob,
off Chapin, if possible, and
Strachan. Right?
Dean: Uh huh.
President: The Grand Jury appeals
to me from the standpoint, it's
the President makes the move
... That's the place to do it,
and not before a committee of
Congress. Right?
Dean: Uh huh.
President: God, we can't risk that,
I mean, uh, all sorts of shit'll
break loose there.

It is not widely known yet, but
former President Richard Nixon
had assembled one hell of an
impeachment defense before he
resigned the Presidency. I became
aware of this when one of my
sources in the San Clemen te
fortress (hereafter to be referred
to as "Green Door" to preserve
his anonymity) provided me with
exclusive briefs which presidential
defense attorney James St. Clair
was prepared to submit at a
Senate trial.
The briefs, according to Green
Door, explain crucial portions of
the White House tapes in such a
way as to "thoroughly,
conclusively, and unequivocally
exonerate the President of any
involvement in the Watergate
affair — or any illicit affair, for
that matter, in which the
President has been accused of
covering-up or not having gone
the hang-out route." Excerpts are
printed below.
President: Now let me make this
clear ... I don't give a shit
what happens. I want you all
to stonewall it, let them plead
the sth Amendment, coverup
or anything else, if it'll save it
— save the plan ... Up to this
point the whole theory has
been containment, as you
know John.
Mitchell: Yeah.
President: That's the thing I'm
really concerned with. We're
going to protect our people if
we can.
Foreign Policy
We find in this remarkable
passage an example of Nixon
foreign policy in action. The
President pledged his continued
support to the sound world
communist containment policies
of President Truman and Dean
Acheson; he didn't give a shit
what happened as long as the
spirit of the Truman Doctrine was
continued. The President's
purpose, of course, was not only
to "protect our people" — the
American people — but also free
people everywhere from the
possibility of Communist
takeovers.
Viewed in this light, the
following discussion of the
President with John Dean on
March 21, 1973, falls neatly into
place.
President: John, you had the right
plan, let me say, I have no
doubts about the right plan
before the election. And you
handled it just right. You
contained it. Now after the
election we've got to have
another plan.
