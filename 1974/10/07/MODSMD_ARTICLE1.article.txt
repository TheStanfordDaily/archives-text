"It's not going to be an easy ride
from now on," Sen. John V. Tunney
(D-Calif.) said Friday night. "We're
going to need men in positions of
leadership who are willing to bite the
bullet... I feel we have such a man in
Gary Gillmor."
Tunney spoke to 500 people at a
$50-a-plate fundraising dinner for
Gillmor at Rickey's Hyatt House in
Palo Alto. Gillmor, the mayor of Santa
Clara, is the Democratic candidate for
the 12th congressional district seat
held by Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park).
"We are having now the very
beginning of problems," Tunney
warned. "I am desperately worried
about whether or not we are going to
be able — as a society — to maintain
not only our standard of living, but
the democratic [process] that has
served us so well."
Tunney said the country needs "a
man who is not afraid to take the
special interests on." Gillmor, he said,
"puts human beings first — he's a
sensitive man, he's a compassionate
man, he's... an honest man, and
that's why I'm here tonight."
Gillmor, who followed Tunney to
the podium, said, "It's really not
worth jt to serve if you have to start
looking to corporations, and even
labor unions and other vested interest
groups."
Spending Limitation
Later, Gillmor said that he agreed
to a $25,000 campaign spending
limitation with McCloskey because,
"If I would spend $100,000 he would
spend $300,000." Besides, he said, "I
don't believe in" spending a lot for a
campaign.
Attacking McCloskey's voting
record, Gillmor said, "I would never
have voted for some of the things my
opponent did — especially in the areas
of health and education, upholding
former President Nixon's vetoes in
these areas."
Gillmor, chairman of the Northern
California Power Agency, also
criticized McCloskey for not knowing

what the "rate of return" of utilities
was. Gillmor accused McCloskey of
saying during a debate that utilities
only have a six percent rate of return
when the actual figure is 13 percent.
Rate Of Return
"No wonder [we have problems]
when we have congressmen who don't
even know what consumers are paying
or what the rate of return of a utility
is," he said.
Gillmor owned part of the property
leased by one of the Palo Alto massage
parlors raided several weeks ago.
Master of Ceremonies Ken Cory, the
Democratic nominee for controller,
kidded that Gillmor was "a great
reform candidate — he's run all of the
massage parlors out of Santa Clara."
At a press conference after the
dinner, Tunney said the withdrawal of
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.)
from the 1976 Democratic presidential
race left the field wide open.
"I suppose that [Sen.] Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) and I are the only
senators who aren't running," he said,
"and I'm not so sure about Alan."
Asked about recent public opinion
polls which show Alabama Gov.
George Wallace as the current
frontrunner for the nomination,
Tunney said he didn't think Wallace
could get the nomination unless the
country "is in very bad economic
shape."
Tunney added, "That would greaJy
displease me. I don't think he's in any
way up to the job."
Asked about the energy situation,
Tunney said, "I think we first ought to
try carpooling and asking people not
to drive their cars." He recommended
adoption of a law providing "free

parking downtown if you drive in a
carpool."
Former Assembly Speaker Jess
Unruh, Democratic candidate for
treasurer, briefly addressed the
gathering. Palo Alto attorneys Tom
Skornia, who was defeated by Gillmor
in the primary, and Jim Stewart, who
was defeated by McCloskey in 1972,
were also on hand.
In addition, Gillmor received
telegrams of endorsement from
Secretary of State and Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Edmund G.
Brown Jr., and Representatives Don
Edwards (D-San Jose) and Leo Ryan
(D-San Mateo).
