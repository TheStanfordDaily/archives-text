# Open Files Protect Student Rights
## 
### 
Rich Jaroslovsky

This column was going to be about a
recent New York magazine article casting
aspersions on the validity of some of the uses
of all those Educational Testing Service tests
like the S.A.T. and L.S.A.T. While that
article is still commended to you (it's in the
Oct. 7 edition), this column—thanks to an
office debate recently swirling around me—is
turning its attention to the recently passed
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
This bill, to refresh your memory, will
apparently allow students access to their own
confidential files. The University, along with
much of the higher education community, is
screaming that the law will hamper them by
allowing students to read supposedly
confidential letters of recommendation.
In fact, I haven't yet heard a good word
about the law. So I have a few. I think it's a
damned good idea, and I think the higher
education community is drastically
overreacting to what should, in the long run,
be beneficial to schools and students alike.
In the articles thus far written, the
objection to the law seems to be that people
writing the recommendations will be less
critical about the applicants if they know the
recommendations can't be kept secret. On
the surface, this seems a reasonable
arguments: —but if you stop to think about
it for a moment, the benefits of this law far
outweigh the drawbacks.

Let us say, for argument's sake, that some
creditor has it in for Dr. Lyman, and inserts a
derogatory reference in his credif file.
Something tells me that when his
BankAmeficard application was refused, Dr.
Lyman might be just a wee bit
upset—especially if that derogatory reference
was inserted because the creditor didn't like
left-wing, soft-on-Commie-students college
administrators. Up until very recently Dr.
Lyman had no recourse, and that reference
could have haunted him every time he sought
credit for the rest of his life.
The educational community's yelps over
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act greatly resemble the credit industry's
yelps over legislation forcing it to open a
consumer's credit files to him. Now, a
consumer can protect himself from unfair or
arbitrary entries by filing his own reply to
the charges. Certainly, an unfavorable
educational recommendation could have an
even more serious effect than could a credit
reference—but where is the student's
protection against such arbitrariness? If
anything, the new law doesn't go far enough,
since it doesn't give the student the right of
reply—but at least allowing him to know
what's been written about him is a step in the
right direction.
The University fears the reverse situation,
the toning down of genuinely critical

remarks. But let me ask this: is it more
beneficial to overlook a strong candidate
because of misinformation, or to look longer
at a weaker candidate, particularly when
there are other ways of evaluating him? I
think that while yes, some might be less
critical in their recommendations, that's
outweighed by the benefit of protecting the
genuinely qualified student from unfair
criticism. The weaker student will eventually
be eliminated from consideration by other
criteria—but the stronger student could
conceivably be blown out of the water by an
unfair criticism.
Yes, the law opens up a can of worms, and
yes, it's a hell of a lot easier for the
University to keep its files confidential. But
that's not the point here.
Bear in mind that we're not talking about
a great number of people here. Many
applicants, in fact most, will never bother to
go look at their files. Some criticisms, as the
University fears, may be toned down, but not
many people writing recommendations are
going to say black is white, or right is
wrong—just as not many are going to write
unfairly derogatory statements. But the
point, I think, is this: if we're going to err, let
us err on the side of maximum protection.

This column was going to be about a
recent New York magazine article casting
aspersions on the validity of some of the uses
of all those Educational Testing Service tests
like the S.A.T. and L.S.A.T. While that
article is still commended to you (it's in the
Oct. 7 edition), this column—thanks to an
office debate recently swirling around me—is
turning its attention to the recently passed
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
This bill, to refresh your memory, will
apparently allow students access to their own
confidential files. The University, along with
much of the higher education community, is
screaming that the law will hamper them by
allowing students to read supposedly
confidential letters of recommendation.
In fact, I haven't yet heard a good word
about the law. So I have a few. I think it's a
damned good idea, and I think the higher
education community is drastically
overreacting to what should, in the long run,
be beneficial to schools and students alike.
In the articles thus far written, the
objection to the law seems to be that people
writing the recommendations will be less
critical about the applicants if they know the
recommendations can't be kept secret. On
the surface, this seems a reasonable
arguments: —but if you stop to think about
it for a moment, the benefits of this law far
outweigh the drawbacks.

Let us say, for argument's sake, that some
creditor has it in for Dr. Lyman, and inserts a
derogatory reference in his credif file.
Something tells me that when his
BankAmeficard application was refused, Dr.
Lyman might be just a wee bit
upset—especially if that derogatory reference
was inserted because the creditor didn't like
left-wing, soft-on-Commie-students college
administrators. Up until very recently Dr.
Lyman had no recourse, and that reference
could have haunted him every time he sought
credit for the rest of his life.
The educational community's yelps over
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act greatly resemble the credit industry's
yelps over legislation forcing it to open a
consumer's credit files to him. Now, a
consumer can protect himself from unfair or
arbitrary entries by filing his own reply to
the charges. Certainly, an unfavorable
educational recommendation could have an
even more serious effect than could a credit
reference—but where is the student's
protection against such arbitrariness? If
anything, the new law doesn't go far enough,
since it doesn't give the student the right of
reply—but at least allowing him to know
what's been written about him is a step in the
right direction.
The University fears the reverse situation,
the toning down of genuinely critical

remarks. But let me ask this: is it more
beneficial to overlook a strong candidate
because of misinformation, or to look longer
at a weaker candidate, particularly when
there are other ways of evaluating him? I
think that while yes, some might be less
critical in their recommendations, that's
outweighed by the benefit of protecting the
genuinely qualified student from unfair
criticism. The weaker student will eventually
be eliminated from consideration by other
criteria—but the stronger student could
conceivably be blown out of the water by an
unfair criticism.
Yes, the law opens up a can of worms, and
yes, it's a hell of a lot easier for the
University to keep its files confidential. But
that's not the point here.
Bear in mind that we're not talking about
a great number of people here. Many
applicants, in fact most, will never bother to
go look at their files. Some criticisms, as the
University fears, may be toned down, but not
many people writing recommendations are
going to say black is white, or right is
wrong—just as not many are going to write
unfairly derogatory statements. But the
point, I think, is this: if we're going to err, let
us err on the side of maximum protection.
