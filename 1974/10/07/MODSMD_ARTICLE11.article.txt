Pub Board Dispute
Editor:
Last Friday's Daily article on
the Thursday Publications Board
meeting was a fairly accurate
account of that session. However,
a reading of the ASSU by-laws,
Section 6.09 "Publications
Board" will indicate that the
procedures of the meeting were
not entirely legal. Paragraph D of
that section of the by-laws states
"Immediate financial and editorial
control of each publication shall
be in a body local to that
publication ..." — the Pub Board
has no control over the staff of a
publication. By last year's
Chaparral staff I was made editor
of the '74-'75 Chaparral and I
appointed Jim Hu to be my
business manager; this is in
complete accord with paragraph D
of the by-laws.
Paragraph B, part 4a states that
the editor and business manager
of the Chaparral are voting
members of the Pub Board. At the
Thursday meeting there was a
vote to have us seated; while the
motion was appreciated it was not
to the point as we are members of
the Pub Board.
The Chaparral may be unseated
by the process in part 3 of
paragraph B, which says, "A
member publication may be
removed from the Board by
three-fourths vote of the full
Board membership, and upon
approval of two-thirds of the
members of the ASSU Senate
present and voting," but
otherwise it is a member
publication and Jim Hu and I are
its legitimate representatives to
the Pub Board. At the next Pub
Board meeting we shall vote on all
affairs that come before the
Board.

Bruce Kadden's article (Daily,
Oct. 3,) "How to recognize a
freshman," struck me as being
arrogantly inappropriate.
Indeed I cannot challenge the
accuracy of Kadden's observations
as he invites his fellow
upperclassmen to laugh at their
former selves. But because this
perennial freshman innocence is
so inabstruse, I question the need
for Kadden's comment in the first
place. Wrongly perhaps I have
come to expect greater taste and
restraint of the Upperclass.
In eliciting a few laughs by
satirizing the ephemeral
awkwardness, insecurity and
eagerness of the freshman class,
Bruce Kadden took a cheap shot
devoid of any class whatsoever.

publication. By last year's
Chaparral staff I was made editor
of the '74-'75 Chaparral and I
appointed Jim Hu to be my
business manager; this is in
complete accord with paragraph D
of the by-laws.
Paragraph B, part 4a states that
the editor and business manager
of the Chaparral are voting
members of the Pub Board. At the
Thursday meeting there was a
vote to have us seated; while the
motion was appreciated it was not
to the point as we are members of
the Pub Board.
The Chaparral may be unseated
by the process in part 3 of
paragraph B, which says, "A
member publication may be
removed from the Board by
three-fourths vote of the full
Board membership, and upon
approval of two-thirds of the
members of the ASSU Senate
present and voting," but
otherwise it is a member
publication and Jim Hu and I are
its legitimate representatives to
the Pub Board. At the next Pub
Board meeting we shall vote on all
affairs that come before the
Board.

Arrogant Satire
Editor:
Bruce Kadden's article (Daily,
Oct. 3,) "How to recognize a
freshman," struck me as being
arrogantly inappropriate.
Indeed I cannot challenge the
accuracy of Kadden's observations
as he invites his fellow
upperclassmen to laugh at their
former selves. But because this
perennial freshman innocence is
so inabstruse, I question the need
for Kadden's comment in the first
place. Wrongly perhaps I have
come to expect greater taste and
restraint of the Upperclass.
In eliciting a few laughs by
satirizing the ephemeral
awkwardness, insecurity and
eagerness of the freshman class,
Bruce Kadden took a cheap shot
devoid of any class whatsoever.

Pub Board Dispute
Editor:
Last Friday's Daily article on
the Thursday Publications Board
meeting was a fairly accurate
account of that session. However,
a reading of the ASSU by-laws,
Section 6.09 "Publications
Board" will indicate that the
procedures of the meeting were
not entirely legal. Paragraph D of
that section of the by-laws states
"Immediate financial and editorial
control of each publication shall
be in a body local to that
publication ..." — the Pub Board
has no control over the staff of a
publication. By last year's
Chaparral staff I was made editor
of the '74-'75 Chaparral and I
appointed Jim Hu to be my
business manager; this is in
complete accord with paragraph D
of the by-laws.
Paragraph B, part 4a states that
the editor and business manager
of the Chaparral are voting
members of the Pub Board. At the
Thursday meeting there was a
vote to have us seated; while the
motion was appreciated it was not
to the point as we are members of
the Pub Board.
The Chaparral may be unseated
by the process in part 3 of
paragraph B, which says, "A
member publication may be
removed from the Board by
three-fourths vote of the full

publication and Jim Hu and I are

the Pub Board. At the next Pub
