# ASSU Senatorial Candidates Announce Election Platforms
## 
### 
(The following statements were
written by candidates for ASSU
Senate in Wednesday's election.
More statements will appear on
this page tomorrow.)
Nussbaum, Dixon
Well voters, once again you
have the chance to cast your
ballot in favor of decency,
honesty and goodness; to vote for
the 3 essential elements of all
civilization (as we know it):
freedom, democracy and the right
to drink in your own pub. And of
all the candidates there are two
who stand apart from the crowd,
who stand ready to secure those
essential elements at a single
bound: Andrew Nussbaum and
Shea Dixon.
But why should these two
draw your attention? Or rather,
how does any candidate get
elected? He does so on the
number of friends that he can
muster, not on the basis of his
qualifications or because of any
issue. After all how many of you
will seriously attempt to judge the

qualifications of a candidate in
this election? And how could you
in an article this short? You can't.
What we plan to do is to relax
and admit that no issue will truly
threaten our sheltered haven here.
Then we'll confront those few
serious issue which may arise and
attempt to solve them.

Al Tomaszczuk
One of the most frustrating
aspects I have encountered in
running for the ASSU Senate is
that of trying to present the most
comprehensive, wonderful picture
of oneself in the smallest possible
space. For example, in designing
my poster, I was confronted with
the problem of trying to say
something creative and insightful
about my candidacy, and at the
same time realizing that a
long-winded dissertation would

not be read. So, I had to
compromise between the two, and
thus, probably didn't succeed
completely at either.
It is unfortunate, I think, that
all ASSU candidates are forced to
prostitute themselves in this
manner. It's not something I
particularly enjoy, and yet,
because I do want the position,
it's something I'm willing to do.
For all those who take the time to
read these little statements, I
think it is an all-important point
to consider.
Meanwhile, 111 go back out on
the campaign trail, trying my best
to convince those who say all
ASSU politicos are alike that I
don't fit the mold.

Jim Johnson
The issues confronting the
University in the coming year
make vocal representation of
student interests imperative. The
student body has far more to lose
in the 1974-75 academic year
than it has had in a long time.
The desperate situation of the
American economy has brought a
plethora of pressures to bear on
the University. Loss of revenues
through investments and increased
costs stemming from last spring's
strike settlement will force the
University to seek expanded
sources of income. The first resort
in such a "treasure hunt" has
traditionally been the tuition
increase. This year, every
precaution must be taken to
insure that the tuition hike will be
as small (or non-existant) as
possible.
There are far too many issues
to detail them all here. The
inequities of the draw, the
movement to drive the fraternities
from the campus, and the massive
problems of the graduate
population on campus will all be
resolved this year—to the
advantage or the disadvantage of
the student body. As a student
who recognizes these problems, I
would like the opportunity to

) work towards solutions in the
1 student interest. I feel that
I students have as much to gain as
they do to lose in the upcoming
t Senate session.

Pat Mortell
• The ASSU Senate is exclusively
a representative body that has
- been in seclusion during my career
at Stanford, emerging only at
election times. Silence is a sure
means of escaping criticism, yet
''without contraries is no
progression."
I assure you the proceedings of
the Senate will be published
frequently if I have a voice in it
this year. As Joe Stanford
student, lam a member of a
species on campus that needs to
put some sensitive, responsive
students, proficient in punching
and grinding, on the Senate.
The new council of presidents
is a cohesive, determined group.
Let's give them some good people
to work with. Assert thyself, vote!
(Pat Mortell is an undergraduate

Robert Flynn
I am not using the Senate as a
springboard for other ASSU
related positions. I am in my last
year; it's too late for political
career building. I think the
tendency for Senators is to be
interested in their so-called
political futures and connections
more than in the business at hand.
My main motivation is for
involvement with the ASSU
Senate, and other Stanford
people.
I basically would like Lo
represent what I see to be the
students' views.
(Robert Flynn is an
undergraduate majoring in
English.)

Kevin McDermott
The problems I would like to
concentrate on are:
HOUSING: Additional spaces
need to be established in
University Housing, not just a
reallocation of the fraternity
spaces.
STUDENT ACTIVITIES:
Student organizations can be
responsibly run. As Business
Manager of the Quad I helped
that group become financially
solvent. I feel that the ASSU can
encourage this type of action.
TUITION: As student
representative on the Finance and
Development Committee of the
Board of Trustees I understand
the pressures to increase tuition,
but $6000 can still buy a lot of
things. Let's be sure A Stanford
Education is still worth it.
(Kevin McDermott is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics.)
Richard Olivas
The needs of new and transfer
students are of real concern to
me. As a new arrival on Stanford's
campus this quarter, I am acutely
aware of the frustrations that
entering students face.
For a start, Stanford's housing
situation is a disgrace. Many of us
know this first-hand. As a student
representative, my energies will be
directed toward this problem in
particular. The University's
administration should be
confronted on this issue; priorities
need to be rearranged.
I am not a seasoned veteran of
Stanford politics. No special bloc
of students guarantees my stay in
office. So I need your help. I
appeal to all Stanford undergrads
— new or old — for your vote of
confidence this week. (Richard
Olivas is an undergraduate

Tyran, Weiland
We are enthusiastic to provide
the ASSU with the best possible
representation.
Purporting to be a residential

university, Stanford is lacking a
basic prerequisite, adequate
housing. If we are ever going to
get our community together, good
and abundant living arrangements
must be provided.
Students should be aware of
how their money is being used. It
is important that the ASSU
Financial Report appear in the
Daily.
No member of the ASSU
Nominating Committee, which
places students on various
committees, should be allowed to
nominate himself to any
committees. In the past a student
on this committee could nominate
himself to prestigious positions
when he was not the most
qualified candidate. In addition,
students should not be permitted
to serve on more than one
committee.
The students in charge of the
Course Review have done a very
good job but there are still many
courses which should be
evaluated.
These are issues which
especially interest us. Certainly we
can't promise that all the ideas
will be fulfilled but if elected we
can promise that we will do our
best towards this end. (Garry

Derek Toliver
The Academic year 1973-74
proved to be the turning point in
Senate relations with the
University-at-large. As a member
of the past year's Senate my duties
included chairing the Senate
Finance Committee, assisting in
the appointment of the present
ASSU Financial Manager, and a
term on the Board of Trustees
Committee on Academic Affairs.
Student government at the
collegiate level is constantly being
attacked for its seemingly
insignificant contribution towards
bettering student affairs. But as an
incumbent member of the Senate
I can personally attest to the
importance of a well-informed

and highly practical Senate. Last
year I encountered numerous
requests from various groups
seeking ways of contacting
students. By working with the
Registar's office I was able to
initiate a brief response form at
the head of every student's Permit
to Register. Students wishing to
be contacted by a campus
organization can now indicate so
by simply signing their PTR.
The Senate is functional only
when it has practical people
working on practical affairs. In
closing I'd like to encourage all
students to come to polls and vote
for the practical experience of
candidates like Derek Toliver.
(Derek Toliver is a undergraduate

Robert Brain
The Stanford Band,
subcommittee on Departmental
Honors, junior varsity basketball,
independent research projects and
various residence hall legislative
councils. These are just a few of
the activities that have coralled
my time at Stanford. With my
unique background, I'm ready to
offer the Senate a new slant on
things — the students' point of
view.
As a senator, I would make
sure the Herman slate would keep
that promise, and I would force
the ASSU to become more
involved in policy-making
decisions. Two current examples
of this are the fraternity and
Tresidder issues. On the fraternity
question, the ASSU must take a
stand. The senate should support
the Inter-fraternity Council's
proposal to allow any houses with
the proper financial backing to
become independant. Tresidder is
supposedly exists to serve the
students, and so far it is doing a
poor job. The ASSU should have
to a say in the atmosphere and
services of Tresidder, the Coffee
Shop and the Pub.
