## USE's Jim Berk.. Hot Air Or Working Class Hero 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
A crowd gathers outside Tresidder Union
to listen to a heated argument. One
protagonist is a student. The other is a
47-year-old man with a salt-and-pepper
ponytail and beard.
"I think you're a liar, Mr. Forensics!," the
older man yells. He turns and walks away
from the student, laughing, shouting.
After he's left, a woman asks who the man
is. Another spectator tells her.
"Oh, so that's Jim Berk," she says.
Jim Berk is more than just a bag of hot air,
however, even though many in the University
administration would dismiss him as such.
He's the president of United Stanford
Employees (USE), which now represents 1500
workers.
Effectiveness
When Berk first became USE president in
1970, the union, at best, represented only 30
workers. For that reason alone, it's nearly
impossible to challenge Berk's effectiveness.
USE members apparently don't, re-electing
him by a 395 to 228 margin last Tuesday.
Roland Finston, who served as USE
president in the group's first year, 1969, said,
"He (Berk) moved the organization from a
small group of individuals to where it is now,
which is no mean achievement. You have to
give him credit. He has a quite good
understanding of how to organize people's
individual problems into a movement for
social change."

Even one of Berk's enemies inside the
union, Dennis Davie, agrees. "He's been very
effective. He did get us a good contract with
the University — when they weren't offering
us zero."
The contract, signed in June after Berk led
a three-week strike, gives the workers a 10
percent raise this year, which he says is nearly
double the University's offer, though less than
half what Berk originally requested.
Berk and USE—the names, as in that last
sentence, are frequently interchangable. One
wonders how Berk, an electrical engineer
with the harsh-lined face of an Appalachian
farmerj became a hard-nosed labor leader.
Educated Dropout
The answer has something to do with the
fact that Berk is a dropout who was later
educated. Born in 1927 in a middle-class
Chicago neighborhood, Berk says "society
programmed me into electrical engineering."
Berk entered Northwestern in 1945, as a
"double E" major but dropped out a year
later. He then began 15 years as a "drifter."
He worked in a factory, drugstore, chemical
company and the Chicago stockyards (as an
egg researcher).
Moving to New York, he served as a
draftsman for a chemical company and began
attending night school at the City College of
New York.
Finally, Berk decided he wanted to become
an electrical engineer. "But remember, there's
a big difference between being programmed

into something and selecting something."
In 1961, Berk settled down at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center. He and his second
wife, Glenda Jones, have lived in Palo Alto
since then with two of his children, one of
hers, and one of their own.
Berk says he's recommended that the
children "not go to college until they know
what they want to do. I think they should do
what I've done."
Sea Split
Berk was a "paper member" of the
Stanford Employees Association (SEA) which
split in 1969 over the issue of student
demonstrations. Berk was kicked out of the
SEA, not because of any political attitudes,
but because he urged SEA President Mike
Fineo "to make demands to the University
right now. The University was so busy with
the demonstrations they'd give us some of our
demands just to avoid more trouble."
Berk handled workers' grievances during
his first year in USE, which was formed by 15
people Fineo had expelled from the now
defunct SEA. Berk says"The road to
power ..."
"Responsibility, Jim. Remember, you're
being quoted," his wife interrupts.
"The road to responsibility in USE was
grievances," Berk corrects.
More Strength
He fought layoffs at Tresidder (getting into
a shoving match with an official along the
way). He shepherded USE into the Service
Employees International Union of the
AFL-CIO to give it more strength.
He and his wife (who served a one-year
term as union president during 1972-73) led
the campaign that won USE the right to
bargain for 1400 technical, maintenance and
service workers. And finally, he led USE's
negotiations with the University.
During negotiations, he bitterly criticized
the University and its chief negotiator,
mild-mannered Doug Barton. "Barton was
insulting the integrity of the workers here. He
was always talking about discipline. We felt he
was abusing his position as a steward ..."
Barton, asked to comment on the
negotiations, would only say, "I really prefer
not to replough that ground. It was a long,
arduous process."
In April of this year Berk walked out of
the negotiating sessions. A month later, he
won the approval of the members to strike.
Berk made headlines during the strike for
being arrested after lying down under crane
attempting to enter a construction site. He
drew laughs for calling an unpopular Medical
School official a "pathological liar," and jeers
for shoving a reporter who got too close to
him with a microphone.
But one incident, in particular, typifies
Jim Berk. Dan DeYoung, then the University

plant services director, set up a pay table
behind a union picket line, and invited
workers to cross their own picket line to pick
up their last prestrike paychecks.
Berk rushed to the scene, walked toward
the pay table, and pushed it over, the checks
flying to the ground.
The Biblical parallel was obvious, and Berk
then said, "I felt a tremendous surge of energy
when I did that."
Now he says he was misunderstood, that he
saw the similarity to Jesus overturning the
tables of gold and silver, but didn't mean to
compare himself with Him. But a lot of
people wonder.
"He acts the way he thinks a labor leader
should— very overdramatic," Don Cox, chief
labor writer of The Stanford Daily says.
Cox says Berk's bluntness hurt him during
the negotiating process. "Some of the people
on the negotiating committee told me
sometimes they wished he'd just shut up."
Davie, who lost to Berk in the election for
union president last year, agrees. "He's very
offensive and it hurts the union. He's turned
off very valuable people—if it weren't for my
tenacity, he might have gotten me out.
"If he encounters someone who disagrees
with him, he's liable to attack him personally.
He'll call you out, stand you up in front of
people and bawl you out," Davie says.
Finston disagrees. "I think that whatever
personality traits some find offensive are part
and parcel of his intellect. He demands
intelligence, integrity and honesty. He's a
challenging person intellectually and some
people mistake that for being blunt."
Berk says,"I don't try hard to avoid fights

and wouldn't be successful if I did. The little
fights are trivial. The real question on an issue
is "How does it serve the membership? That is
the only criterion that must be applied."
He obviously thinks he can serve the
membership best. For example, when asked
about nepotism (both he and his wife, who is
the union co-ordinator, are on the payroll), he
says "It's not a big issue as long as she's doing
her job as well as anyone can do it and I'm
doing my job as well as anyone can do it."
Is there a Jim Berk separable from USE?
His wife laughs at the question. "All he does is
read, play with the kids, work on the cars and
use the computer," she says.
The car Berk is most often seen in is an old
green Citroen that nearly scrapes the ground.
It blends well with his style of dress, tie-die
T-shirts and blue jeans which would be
fashionable for a man half his age.
Berk's other love is the computer. During
the negotiations and strike, he was frequently
seen at all hours at the computer center.
"It was worth it,"he says, reverting to
discussion of union affairs. "We actually got a
little more than 10 percent because we used
the computer for analysis and knew what was
happening better than they (the University)
did."
Even Berk's dreams are connected with
USE. In his mind, the union will encompass
nearly all of the 6000-8000 workers at
Stanford. It will become "a more significant
force." It will offer a group legal, health care,
wholesale discount and dental plans:
"We can make a showcase out of
Stanford!"

STRIKE LEADER—During May's USE strike, union President Jim Berk was often seen on picket
lines and attending meetings such as this one. Some critics thought Berk's tactics were
overdramatic.
