## We ant aldvogel' So Say Card Fans After Game 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Football fans are a fickle lot.
Before Saturday's game against
Michigan a lot of them were
wondering why head coach Jack
Christiansen didn't just name a
starting quarterback.
The Daily conducted a brief
pre-game survey of the fans and
Mike Cordova was the favorite
with four votes. Guy Benjamin
trailed Cordova with two votes.
Starting quarterback Jerry
Waldvogel did not receive a single
vote.
But after the game, Waldvogel
was the overwhelming choice of
the fans, receiving 32 votes.
Cordova was a poor second with
10 and Benjamin trailed the pack
with four ballots.
One sideline observer, former
head football manager Chris
Canellos, recalled that Chris had
the same problem when he was
head coach of the San Francisco
49ers. "Chris had to make a
choice between John Brodie and
Steve Spurrier and he couldn't do
it. When he finally named Brodie,
it was too late, the 49ers had
gotten off to one of their worst
starts and had a poor season."
"John Ralston had the same
problem with Don Bunce and Jim
Plunkett and he went with
Plunkett and he took us to the
Bowl. We've put so much
publicity into making Cordova the
starter that Chris has to start him,
but I'd go with Waldvogel. He's
the smartest," Canellos said.
One VIP rooter, former
University Vice President Frank
Walker, said it really doesn't "make
much difference. But he added,
"While Cordova's not another
Plunkett, I think he's the
smoothest of the three."
A season ticket holder offered
Chris some advice on selecting a
starter. "If they're as even as
Christiansen says they are, why
doesn't he just put their names in
a hat and draw for it?"
A former Stanford
All-American was quick to name
Waldvogel. "He was the only one
of them who was able to inspire
them. But maybe it's unfair to the
rest of them because he was
playing with an inspired team
today and the other two weren't.
Then again it was Jerry who

inspired 'em."
One of the fathers of a
Stanford starter favored
Waldvogel because of his
experience. "I think we should go
with the oldest. Jerry's more
mature and he really did a better
job than Cordova."
One drunken tailgater who'd
had too many harvey walbangers
favored Waldvogel. "If I were the

coach I'd go with Walbanger.
Cordova and Benjamin are still
kids. Let's go with Walbanger
and stop this fooling around. I
want to go to Pasadena on
January 1."
But one fan had a solution
which would solve everything.
"I'd like to have Denny Franklin
[Michigan's quarterback]. But I'll
settle for Waldvogel."

OUR MAN JERRY — No one ever compared Jerry Waldvogel's form
with Jim Plunkett's, and with good reason. But Waldvogel played well
on Saturday, and the fans (and several players) would like to see him
named starting quarterback for the season.

Plunkett and he took us to the
Bowl. We've put so much
publicity into making Cordova the
starter that Chris has to start him,
but I'd go with Waldvogel. He's
the smartest," Canellos said.
One VIP rooter, former
University Vice President Frank
Walker, said it really doesn't "make
much difference. But he added,
"While Cordova's not another
Plunkett, I think he's the
smoothest of the three."
A season ticket holder offered
Chris some advice on selecting a
starter. "If they're as even as
Christiansen says they are, why
doesn't he just put their names in
a hat and draw for it?"
A former Stanford
All-American was quick to name
Waldvogel. "He was the only one
of them who was able to inspire
them. But maybe it's unfair to the
rest of them because he was
playing with an inspired team
today and the other two weren't.
Then again it was Jerry who

inspired 'em."
One of the fathers of a
Stanford starter favored
Waldvogel because of his
experience. "I think we should go
with the oldest. Jerry's more
mature and he really did a better
job than Cordova."
One drunken tailgater who'd
had too many harvey walbangers
favored Waldvogel. "If I were the

coach I'd go with Walbanger.
Cordova and Benjamin are still
kids. Let's go with Walbanger
and stop this fooling around. I
want to go to Pasadena on
January 1."
But one fan had a solution
which would solve everything.
"I'd like to have Denny Franklin
[Michigan's quarterback]. But I'll
settle for Waldvogel."

OUR MAN JERRY — No one ever compared Jerry Waldvogel's form
with Jim Plunkett's, and with good reason. But Waldvogel played well
on Saturday, and the fans (and several players) would like to see him
named starting quarterback for the season.
Football fans are a fickle lot.
Before Saturday's game against
Michigan a lot of them were
wondering why head coach Jack
Christiansen didn't just name a
starting quarterback.
The Daily conducted a brief
pre-game survey of the fans and
Mike Cordova was the favorite
with four votes. Guy Benjamin
trailed Cordova with two votes.
Starting quarterback Jerry
Waldvogel did not receive a single
vote.
But after the game, Waldvogel
was the overwhelming choice of
the fans, receiving 32 votes.
Cordova was a poor second with
10 and Benjamin trailed the pack
with four ballots.
One sideline observer, former
head football manager Chris
Canellos, recalled that Chris had
the same problem when he was
head coach of the San Francisco
49ers. "Chris had to make a
choice between John Brodie and
Steve Spurrier and he couldn't do
it. When he finally named Brodie,
it was too late, the 49ers had
gotten off to one of their worst
starts and had a poor season."
"John Ralston had the same
problem with Don Bunce and Jim
Plunkett and he went with
Plunkett and he took us to the
Bowl. We've put so much
publicity into making Cordova the
starter that Chris has to start him,
but I'd go with Waldvogel. He's
the smartest," Canellos said.
