# Inspired Cards Scare Michigan
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Maybe Stanford has a good
football team after all.
Though there were mistakes
and lapses, the Cardinals'
performance Saturday, in a 27-16
loss to third-ranked Michigan,
bore out the maxim that given a
will to do so, Stanford can play
with anybody.
That was shown in the first
quarter. Michigan got the ball four
times. It punted the ball away
after three unsuccessful downs
four times. While the Card defense
couldn't continue to thwart the
Wolverines in that manner, all in
all, it was the defense's best game
of the year.
The Card offense was even
more impressive. It chalked up
more points than anyone had
gotten against Michigan since
1971. That time span includes the
1972 Rose Bowl loss to Stanford
and three battles with superpower
Ohio State.
The unlikely hero of this
offensive charge against a team
which had only allowed seven
points in three previous games was
one Jerry Waldvogel.
"Wald vogel's a god,"
outspoken linebacker Forrie
Martin said of the previously
untested quarterback, who
heretofore hadn't been considered
much more than a candidate for
second-string.
Offensive starters Ron Inge and
Keith Rowen echoed, "Waldvogel
called a really good game."
Late Drive
Waldvogel completed 21 of 40
passes for 229 yards, but what
really brought him the praise was
a fourth-quarter drive that
brought Stanford within 20-16.
Starting at their own 13 after a
holding penalty that left them
virtually hopeless, the Cards
consistently converted
third-and-long situations.
"Usually when it's third down
I'd get ready to go in the game,"
Martin said. "But this time I said
— 'relax. He'll make it.' "
When the drive stalled at

fourth-and-one on the Michigan
seven, the coaching staff called
the big play, a seven-yard TD pass
to Scott Laidlaw.
Partly Right
"The touchdown pass was just
perfect. He saw I was open and he
just lobbed it to me nice and
soft," Eric Test was quoted as
saying by a mixed up San
Francisco Examiner writer. Well,
the pass was to Laidlaw, not Test,
but it was a perfect one indeed.
Stanford, probably by mistake,
went for a one-point conversion
(see related column), but it didn't
really matter.
Michigan came back with a
chillingly effective drive.
Quarterback Dennis Franklin,
who earlier drew the ire of his
coach, Bo Schembechler, for
passing too much, executed the
option perfectly.
Deja Vu
Stanford's defense must have
felt a deja vu. Pretty much the
same thing had happened in the
fourth quarter against Penn State
and San Jose State. But here there
was an excuse. Michigan was just
too good.
By the time the 14-play,
78-yard drive ended in
touchdown, the game was over.
But it wouldn't be fair to blame
the defense for the loss.
An offensive error in the third
quarter really cost the game. On
the first play following a
Wolverine touchdown that made
it 13-9, Waldvogel pitched high to
Scott Laidlaw.
Both players blamed
themselves for a fumble at the
Stanford nine which set up a
quick TD.
Langford Kicks
Before that miscue, Stanford
outplayed Michigan. In addition
to staunch defense, Stanford took
its 9-6 halftime lead on the power
of Mike Langford's foot.
Langford booted field goals of
52, 42 and 42 yards, in a
I Garcia-esque performance that
had the same effect on Stanford

fans that Rod's boots against USC
had last year.
The fans were tremendous.
From the opening series to a final
(unnecessary) Michigan time out,
the crowd of 52,500 — especially
the student section — supported
its team with numerous
standing ovations.
After the game, Christiansen
said, "I feel good about the
football team." Most of the fans,
at least, no longer feel bad.

Cardinal Notes: Larry
McGovern's second quarter pass
interception, which set up a field
goal, was the first turnover against
Michigan in 261 snaps . . . After
the interception, Bo
Schembechler told Franklin:
"Jesus, Den, start using your
head. We don't want those damn
passes." Ole Bo shouted a lot at
halftime, and generally behaved
like a pupil of Woody Hayes.
