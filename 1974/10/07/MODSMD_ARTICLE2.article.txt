# Large Field Develops In ASSU Race
## 
### 
Eighty-four candidates will
compete for 10 undergraduate and 10
graduate positions in the ASSU Senate
election on Wednesday and Thursday.
The large number of candidates
includes 68 undergrads, eight more
than last year.
According to ASSU Financial
Manager Frank Olivieri, six
undergraduate candidates were barred
from the race because their petitions
included the signatures of graduate
students.
Each candidate's petition must
include 25 signatures of students in
the same division. A random sampling
of the signatures uncovered the
discrepancies in six cases, Olivieri said.
The six students, who may not yet
be aware of the ASSU decision, are
Beth Wood, Warner Session, Elena
Rios, Lori Pryor, Eleanor Lynds and
Kate Janeway.
With no other issues on the ballot,
Rocky Barber, former Senate
chairman, expects only 2500 students
to vote. Last year, only 43 votes
separated the top 10 vote-getters, and
this year's race is expected to be
equally close. "Ultimately," Barber
said, "the decision comes down to
who can reach the most people."
In the past six years. Barber recalls
only four freshmen elected to the
Senate. "One of them painted a
50-foot sign with his name in large
letters, and another went door to door
soliciting votes," Barber said.
Candidates are limited to $50 in
campaign spending. Many candidates
have mimeographed literature
outlining their positions. Statements
by the candidates will be printed in
the Daily today and tomorrow.
A bloc of 10 graduate students,
citing the need for more effective
representation of their interests, will
campaign as a unit for all graduate
positions.
Polling places will be open from 10
a.m. to 2 p.m. on Wednesday and
Thursday at the history corner, the
Graduate School of Business, the
medical school and the Physics tank.
Students may vote at the post office
and engineering corner between 10
a.m. and 4 p.m. on both election days.
Tentative election results will be
printed in the Daily on Friday. Final
results will not be known until Oct. 13
when the overseas absentee ballots are
returned.

equally close. "Ultimately," Barber
said, "the decision comes down to
who can reach the most people."
In the past six years. Barber recalls
only four freshmen elected to the
Senate. "One of them painted a
50-foot sign with his name in large
letters, and another went door to door
soliciting votes," Barber said.
Candidates are limited to $50 in
campaign spending. Many candidates
have mimeographed literature
outlining their positions. Statements
by the candidates will be printed in
the Daily today and tomorrow.
A bloc of 10 graduate students,
citing the need for more effective
representation of their interests, will
campaign as a unit for all graduate
positions.
Polling places will be open from 10
a.m. to 2 p.m. on Wednesday and
Thursday at the history corner, the
Graduate School of Business, the
medical school and the Physics tank.
Students may vote at the post office
and engineering corner between 10
a.m. and 4 p.m. on both election days.
Tentative election results will be
printed in the Daily on Friday. Final
results will not be known until Oct. 13
when the overseas absentee ballots are
returned.
