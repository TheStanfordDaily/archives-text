# Shuffling The Cards
## Chris' Mistakes 
### Dave Robinson 
I have often questioned Jack Christiansen, but have never felt
qualified to criticize him. After all, my background in football
strategy is limited to one year as a highly unsuccessful high school
quarterback and a two-unit Stanford class entitled "Theory and
Technique of Football."
I have always liked and admired Christiansen. He is friendly,
affable and cooperative — even with bothersome reporters. And I have
always thought, particularly after last year's dramatic midseason
reversal of Cardinal fortunes, that Jack Christiansen was one hell of a
football coach.
I even defended Christiansen these past few weeks, pleading with
skeptics to wait before calling for his contract. The Cards will come
back, I thought, as soon as Chris chooses a quarterback. For now, let's
be patient while he keeps his word and gives Mike Cordova, Guy
Benjamin and Jerry Waldvogel a fair chance.
But Saturday afternoon my patience ran short. In the midst of a
brilliant Stanford effort against Michigan, Christiansen made an
inexcusable tactical error. And afterwards, he shrugged aside an earlier
promise to choose a No. 1 quarterback before the Pac-8 opener.
Midway in the fourth quarter, the score was 20-15 Michigan.
Stanford had just scored on a fourth and goal flare pass from
Waldvogel to Scott Laidlaw — a perfect call by Christiansen. But then
Mike Langford trotted onto the field to kick one of the most useless
extra points in college football history.
A two-point conversion would have put the Cardinals within a field
goal of a tie; a missed two-pointer would be no worse than a one-point
conversion.
Langford himself was skeptical. "Do you want me to kick it?" he
iasked. "Yes," Christiansen replied. "Are you sure?"
Later, Christiansen admitted the one-point conversion was "an
oversight." One coach, maybe, could be excused for not analyzing the
alternatives in such a heated situation. But a nine-man coaching staff
neglecting the obvious? That's one hell of an oversight.
Of course that play didn't figure in the final score, and I had
mellowed considerably upon reaching the Cardinal dressing room.
Then Christiansen answered the inevitable "Who's your quarterback"
question:
"I think we've got three pretty good quarterbacks. I hope we
would rally around whoever happens to be in there. I think it's
horseshit that you have to have one leader — in fact the leader doesn't
have to be the quarterback."
In other words, there isn't a No. 1 quarterback, and there might
not be one the rest of the season. A classic cop-out.
I sympathize with Christiansen's dilemma. Waldvogel, Benjamin
and Cordova have all performed brilliantly at times. But I also realize
that Stanford, despite its 0-3-1 status, has a damned good football
team and could conceivably rally behind one quarterback and go to
the Rose Bowl.
"This team has to have a No, 1 quarterback," said Waldvogel.
"Naturally I'd like it to be me, but we've got to pick somebody and
get going."
Christiansen should begin practice this afternoon with the
following announcement:
"Our offensive captain for the week and our starting quarterback
for the Pac-8 season is ."
Fill in the blank with Waldvogel, Benjamin or Cordova. It doesn't
really matter.
But somebody has got to be No. 1.

affable and cooperative — even with bothersome reporters. And I have
always thought, particularly after last year's dramatic midseason
reversal of Cardinal fortunes, that Jack Christiansen was one hell of a
football coach.
I even defended Christiansen these past few weeks, pleading with
skeptics to wait before calling for his contract. The Cards will come
back, I thought, as soon as Chris chooses a quarterback. For now, let's
be patient while he keeps his word and gives Mike Cordova, Guy
Benjamin and Jerry Waldvogel a fair chance.
But Saturday afternoon my patience ran short. In the midst of a
brilliant Stanford effort against Michigan, Christiansen made an
inexcusable tactical error. And afterwards, he shrugged aside an earlier
promise to choose a No. 1 quarterback before the Pac-8 opener.
Midway in the fourth quarter, the score was 20-15 Michigan.
Stanford had just scored on a fourth and goal flare pass from
Waldvogel to Scott Laidlaw — a perfect call by Christiansen. But then
Mike Langford trotted onto the field to kick one of the most useless
extra points in college football history.
A two-point conversion would have put the Cardinals within a field
goal of a tie; a missed two-pointer would be no worse than a one-point
conversion.
Langford himself was skeptical. "Do you want me to kick it?" he
iasked. "Yes," Christiansen replied. "Are you sure?"
Later, Christiansen admitted the one-point conversion was "an
oversight." One coach, maybe, could be excused for not analyzing the
alternatives in such a heated situation. But a nine-man coaching staff
neglecting the obvious? That's one hell of an oversight.
Of course that play didn't figure in the final score, and I had
mellowed considerably upon reaching the Cardinal dressing room.
Then Christiansen answered the inevitable "Who's your quarterback"
question:
"I think we've got three pretty good quarterbacks. I hope we
would rally around whoever happens to be in there. I think it's
horseshit that you have to have one leader — in fact the leader doesn't
have to be the quarterback."
In other words, there isn't a No. 1 quarterback, and there might
not be one the rest of the season. A classic cop-out.
I sympathize with Christiansen's dilemma. Waldvogel, Benjamin
and Cordova have all performed brilliantly at times. But I also realize
that Stanford, despite its 0-3-1 status, has a damned good football
team and could conceivably rally behind one quarterback and go to
the Rose Bowl.
"This team has to have a No, 1 quarterback," said Waldvogel.
"Naturally I'd like it to be me, but we've got to pick somebody and
get going."
Christiansen should begin practice this afternoon with the
following announcement:
"Our offensive captain for the week and our starting quarterback
for the Pac-8 season is ."
Fill in the blank with Waldvogel, Benjamin or Cordova. It doesn't
really matter.
But somebody has got to be No. 1.
I have often questioned Jack Christiansen, but have never felt
qualified to criticize him. After all, my background in football
strategy is limited to one year as a highly unsuccessful high school
quarterback and a two-unit Stanford class entitled "Theory and
Technique of Football."
I have always liked and admired Christiansen. He is friendly,
affable and cooperative — even with bothersome reporters. And I have
