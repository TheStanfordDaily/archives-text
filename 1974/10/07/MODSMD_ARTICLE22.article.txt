# Women's Crew Team Becoming A Reality?
## 
### WENDY QUINONES 
In an early dip into the muddy
waters of federal prohibitions on
sexual discrimination in athletics,
a women's crew team seems well
on the way to reality for this year.
At a Thursday night meeting
with Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
and representatives of the men's
team, prospective women rowers,
many with previous crew
experience, garnered considerable
support for their nascent group.
But problems of location,
equipment and coaching remain
to be solved.
The formation of the team,
one of a growing number of
women's crews both locally and at
the national level, seems to be
mandated by Title IX of the
Federal Education Amendments
Act of 1972, which prohibits
denial of opportunities for
athletes on the basis of sex.
But the meeting testified to the
difficulties of expanding a
program whose participants claim
can barely accommodate the 80
men now in training. The men
warned that adding what all agree
must be a separate 30-woman
team would strain their limited
resources.
The crew's seven 8-man boats
are now being used to capacity,
according to Capt. Sam Francis.
And Ruetz worried that releasing
one of the boats for use by the
women would cause the men's
team for the first time in itf

history to cut some of its
members and thus "lose its
competitive status."
Preservation of this status is a
major concern because of the
crew's funding situation. As a club
sport, it receives some $4,500 of
its annual budget from the
University, plus a larger amount
from alumni gifts.
According to Kent Mitchell, a
Palo Alto attorney, former crew
member and ex-coach, the
$10,000 he estimates would be
required to equip a women's team
could not be raised from alumni
"unless we could show that it
wouldn't affect the program we
have now."
He added that he thinks both
crew and alumni favor the
establishment of a women's team,
and that they would support it
financially if its problems could
be solved "without jeopardizing
the competitive status of the
men's team."
Though no solutions were
found at the meeting, participants
agreed to meet again. In the
meantime, they plan to explore
several alternatives for funding
and equipping the women's team
which would least threaten the
men's crew.
But as one woman warned,
"We have to get the women into
boats now or they'll lose interest.
And if nothing else works out, it
seems like the men might just
have to make some sacrifices."
