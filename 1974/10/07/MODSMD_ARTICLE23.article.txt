AMERICAN LEAGUE
OAKLAND— Left-hander Ken
Holtzman limited Baltimore to five
hits and So! Bando belted a three-run
shot, giving the Oakland A's a 5-0
victory over the Orioles yesterday to
even the American League playoffs at
one game apiece.
The best-of-five series resumes
tomorrow in Baltimore.
Holtzman, backed by faultless and
often brilliant fielding, retired 16
batters in a row after giving up a
single to Andy Etchebarren in the
third.
With two outs in the eighth, Enos
Cabell singled up the middle for
Baltimore's second hit and
Etchebarren followed with another
single, giving the Orioles a runner on
second base for the first time.
Oakland Manager Alvin Dark, who
had two pitchers working in his
bullpen, went to the mound to
confer with Holtzman and decided to
let him attempt to work out of the
jam.
Dark's confidence paid off when
Curt Motton, batting for Mark
Belanger, checked his swing and
tapped a soft grounder to first
basemen Gene Tenace for the third
out.
NATIONAL LEAGUE
PITTSBURGH-Pinch-hitter Willie
Crawford singled home the
tie-breaking run as the Los Angeles
Dodgers raked Pittsburgh relief ace
Dave Giusti for three runs in the
eighth inning to beat the Pirates 5-2
yesterday.
The win gave the Dodgers a 2-0
stranglehold in the best-of-five
National League playoffs.
The Dodgers' big rally came after
Pittsburgh broke a 15-inning scoring
famine with a pair of seventh-inning

runs that tied the game 2-2.
The victory sent Los Angeles
home needing only one more victory
in the three games scheduled for
Dodger Stadium starting tomorrow
afternoon to clinch their first
National League pennant since 19G6.

tossed touchdown passes of 11, 45

LAS VEGAS - Veteran Al
Geiberger wrote an end to five years
of frustration and disappointment
with a two-under-par 69 that brought
him the title yesterday in the Sahara
Invitational Golf Tournament.
Geiberger, a 37-year-old who
scored his last victory in the 1966
PGA National Championship, won by
three strokes with a 273 total as last
gasp bids by Johnny Miller and Chi
Chi Rodriguez fell short.
