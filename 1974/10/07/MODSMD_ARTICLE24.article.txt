# Pac-8 Roundup
## Bart Express Rolls Along 
### 
The Bart express is rolling.
Previously considered only a Bay
Area phenomenon, it made its
presence known across the
country Saturday as Cal ripped
14th ranked Illinois 31-14.
Steve Bartowski led the Bart
Express to its third straight
victory as he completed 14 of 19
passes for two touchdowns and
244 yards.
Down South, the two
traditional Pac-8 powerhouses,
UCLA and USC, were outplayed
but won relatively easily.
USC, though outgained 363
yards to 231, smashed lowa 41-3.
lowa, on offense much of the
game, had four drives terminated
by fumbles. Two of these fumbles
were returned for touchdowns, of
83 and 98 yards, by defensive
back Charles Phillips.
Phillips broke a NCAA record
for returns either by interception
or fumble.
UCLA, also outgained,
prevailed over Utah 27-14. Utah
controlled the ball much of the
first two quarters but just could
not score.
While the Southern
powerhouses were winning, Jim
Sweeney of Washington State and
Jim Owens of Washington were
muttering to the people who
scheduled their games.
Both the Cougars and the
Huskies were facing their second

straight nationally ranked team,
and both lost.
The Cougars were tamed by
Ohio State's Archie Griffin, who
rushed for his 15th straight
100-yard plus game, as the No. 1
ranked Buckeyes crushed them
42-7.
Texas, featuring a devastating
Wishbone offense, racked up 367
yards rushing en route to a 35-21
victory over Washington.
Quarterback Chris Rowland's 24
of 37 passing display fell short for
the Huskies, who slipped to 2-2.
Oregon and Oregon State drew
easier competition, yet still lost,
as both the Ducks and the Beavers
needed outstanding performances
to stay in the game.
Don Reynolds gained 196
yards and broke a 56-yard
touchdown run the first time he
carried the ball. But the Ducks
couldn't make the lead last as
they fell to Northwestern 14-10.
Oregon evened it's record to 2-2
as the Wildcats picked up their
first victory of the season.
And Oregon State lost its
fourth game in a row as the
Beavers were defeated by
Southern Methodist, 37-30. Down
30-9 in the fourth quarter, Oregon
State reserve quarterback Alvin
White ignited his team to a
21-point quarter. But his efforts
were in vain as the Mustangs
scored once more. SMU rushed
for 463 yards in the game.
