# JV Faces Lineman Shortage
## 
### JEFF BOOTHE 
The Stanford junior varsity
football program is faced with a
unique yet not discouraging
problem — an overabundance of
backs and receivers, and a definite
lack of linemen.
The junior varsity Cards will be
featuring what coach Doug Single
admits is one of the smallest
group of linemen in years, in both
numbers and size. The baby
Cardinals have only 14 linemen,
eight offensive and six defensive,
with about 45 players at other
positions.
When asked about this, Single
stated, "The situation isn't as
dramatic as it may seem. It looks
much better than it did at the
beginning of the season, but we
just can't get hurt."
The varsity won't provide
much help, Single said. "Most of
the people who could come down
are junior college transfers or
redshirts and they can't play for
us."
Therefore the JV's will have to
turn within for the solution. And
the solution once again is a
Stanford tradition — the pass.
Single explained, "We will be
throwing the ball a lot because
this is much easier on the linemen.
They are quick and smart and this
will help in pass blocking."
Despite this apparent adversity,
Single is confident that the
problem will work out to the
team's advantage. "Since we are
weak at linemen it will give these
players a chance to develop and
make up for their size," Single
said.
A shortage of players is
plaguing not only Stanford but
also traditional powerhouse
Oklahoma, which was forced to
cancel this year's junior varsity
football schedule.
When asked if he feared an end
to the junior varsity football
program at Stanford, Single
declared, "We have enough
interest that the program will
last."
"We depend on walk-ons and
former junior varsity football
members. Without these people
we wouldn't be able to play. This
situation doesn't exist at so-called
football factories where the
emphasis is on winning."
