# Runners Just Miss Crown At Fresno
## 
### MIKE SHEPHERD 
The Stanford cross country
team finished a close second to
Nevada-Reno 45-49 at the Fresno
State Invitational Saturday. Coach
Marshall Clark said, "They beat us
up front with the one-two punch,"
as Domingo Tibedizua and Hans
Menet finished first and second.
Tony Sandoval, Stanford's top
runner last year, returned after
missing last week's race with a
foot injury to lead all Stanford
runners. He finished fifth (behind
two unattached contestants) in
30:33.
Jack Bellah, who last week
"wanted to stay back and then
make a move on the leaders, but
the pace was too fast," tried to set
a fast pace of his own in Fresno.
Bellah ran a very aggressive
race and led the field at the
three-mile mark with a 15:10
split.
The heat and distance were just
too much, however, and he

finished sixth behind Sandoval in
30:45. This was the first race of
the season at the usual six mile
length and perhaps this was also a
factor in the drop in position of
Bellah and Mark McConnel, who
finished ninth in 31:12.
As Clark remarked, both
Tibedizua and Menet are "older,
seasoned runners who were less
affected by the fast pace."
Sandoval and Art Brown, who
finished 12th in 31:42, did not
try to run with the leaders in the
first three miles and held their
positions throughout the race.
Chris Berka and Frank Boutin
ran good races, finishing fifth and
sixth among Stanford runners to
round out the scoring. Naturally
disappointed in losing such a close
meet, Stanford has to be
encouraged with Sandoval's strong
race on his first outing and the
general improvement in times in
looking forward to the more
important races later in the
season.

PACE PROBLEMS — Stanford's second-best cross-country runner,
Jack Bellah, is shown a week ago Saturday, in a race where he started
too slow. This past Saturday, he may have gone out too fast. Despite
these problems, Bellah is an outstanding runner who'll surprise a lot of
foes before the year is over.
