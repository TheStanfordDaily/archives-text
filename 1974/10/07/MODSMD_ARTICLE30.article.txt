# Booters Almost Upset USF, But Reffing Produces Tie
## 
### DAN PYNE 
Someone, somewhere, once
said that bad things come in
bunches. The Stanford soccer
team would have to agree.
For the second game in a row,
controversial officiating plagued
the Cardinal soccer team, which
was forced to settle for a 2-2 tie
with the University of San
Francisco.
"I just can't believe it," varsity
coach Bert Baldaccini kept
repeating after last Friday's game.
"We had them beaten, and then
they [the officials] took one goal
away from us and gave one to
them."
Frank Johns, junior varsity
goalie, added, "In South America,
refs are killed for better
performances than the ones
displayed today .. ."
Actually, despite the
impressive way Stanford has
played in its previous two
games, many spectators wondered
before the game how long the
Cardinals could hold USF, fifth
ranked in the country and top
ranked in the West. Stanford is
ranked ninth in the West.
Long Day
But from the first minute of
the game it was clear USF was in
for a long day. Stanford displayed
a knack for ball control that USF,
notorious for recruiting foreign
players in their late 20s or early
30s, was supposedly noted for.

And the Cardinal defense was
solid.
At 10:20 into the first half,
Mack Taylor lofted a free kick
into the goal area from just past
midfield, and Phil Wright headed
the ball over the USF goalkeeper
for Stanford's first score.
Minutes later Taylor and
Wright combined for the same
play, but the goal was nullified by
an offsides penalty apparently on
Johnny Murao. Baldaccini
disagreed.
"There was no offsides," he
said. "The ball was in the goal
before he [Murao] touched it. He
couldn't have been offsides."
USF scored with just 4:20 left
in the first half on a shot by Andy
Atuegbu.
Came Out Kicking
The Cardinals came out kicking
in the second half, and three
minutes into the period Marty
Glickfield drove the ball from
outside the USF penalty area for
Stanford's second official tally.
USF began to get its game
together but still could not score
against Stanford's obstinate
defense. The Dons had 32 shots
on goal in the game while the
Cardinals had only seven. But
Stanford goalie Bruce Mosbacher

was tough once again. He made 17
saves in the game, 10 in the
second half.
But then there was the penalty
kick.
With about five minutes
remaining in the match USF was
awarded a direct free penalty kick
when Stanford was called for
"pushing" on a corner kick. "I
never even saw a penalty,"
Baldaccini said.
Walt Harris, former Stanford
goalie, claimed it was a very
questionable call; usually pushing
results in an indirect free kick.
Protests were to no avail; Atuegbu
took the shot and scored the tying
goal.
Stanford will undoubtedly rise
in regional standings as a result of
their performance against USF,
but the outcome remains
bittersweet.
"I told you we could beat the
hell out of USF," Baldaccini said,
"and we almost did. We beat them
in our shots, and our defense . .."
He shrugged.
At least, he concluded, "we
shouldn't lose another game the
rest of the season."
The Cardinals play a relatively
easier game with San Francisco
State tomorrow at 1 p m, here.

said that bad things come in
bunches. The Stanford soccer
team would have to agree.
For the second game in a row,
controversial officiating plagued
the Cardinal soccer team, which
was forced to settle for a 2-2 tie
with the University of San
Francisco.
"I just can't believe it," varsity
coach Bert Baldaccini kept
repeating after last Friday's game.
"We had them beaten, and then
they [the officials] took one goal
away from us and gave one to
them."
Frank Johns, junior varsity
goalie, added, "In South America,
refs are killed for better
performances than the ones
displayed today .. ."
Actually, despite the
impressive way Stanford has
played in its previous two
games, many spectators wondered
before the game how long the
Cardinals could hold USF, fifth
ranked in the country and top
ranked in the West. Stanford is
ranked ninth in the West.
Long Day
But from the first minute of
the game it was clear USF was in
for a long day. Stanford displayed
a knack for ball control that USF,
notorious for recruiting foreign
players in their late 20s or early
30s, was supposedly noted for.

And the Cardinal defense was
solid.
At 10:20 into the first half,
Mack Taylor lofted a free kick
into the goal area from just past
midfield, and Phil Wright headed
the ball over the USF goalkeeper
for Stanford's first score.
Minutes later Taylor and
Wright combined for the same
play, but the goal was nullified by
an offsides penalty apparently on
Johnny Murao. Baldaccini
disagreed.
"There was no offsides," he
said. "The ball was in the goal
before he [Murao] touched it. He
couldn't have been offsides."
USF scored with just 4:20 left
in the first half on a shot by Andy
Atuegbu.
Came Out Kicking
The Cardinals came out kicking
in the second half, and three
minutes into the period Marty
Glickfield drove the ball from
outside the USF penalty area for
Stanford's second official tally.
USF began to get its game
together but still could not score
against Stanford's obstinate
defense. The Dons had 32 shots
on goal in the game while the
Cardinals had only seven. But
Stanford goalie Bruce Mosbacher

was tough once again. He made 17
saves in the game, 10 in the
second half.
But then there was the penalty
kick.
With about five minutes
remaining in the match USF was
awarded a direct free penalty kick
when Stanford was called for
"pushing" on a corner kick. "I
never even saw a penalty,"
Baldaccini said.
Walt Harris, former Stanford
goalie, claimed it was a very
questionable call; usually pushing
results in an indirect free kick.
Protests were to no avail; Atuegbu
took the shot and scored the tying
goal.
Stanford will undoubtedly rise
in regional standings as a result of
their performance against USF,
but the outcome remains
bittersweet.
"I told you we could beat the
hell out of USF," Baldaccini said,
"and we almost did. We beat them
in our shots, and our defense . .."
He shrugged.
At least, he concluded, "we
shouldn't lose another game the
rest of the season."
The Cardinals play a relatively
easier game with San Francisco
State tomorrow at 1 p m, here.
