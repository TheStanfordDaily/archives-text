# Poloists Finish Third At NorCal Tourney
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
"I don't know what we came
to play, but it sure wasn't water
polo," said a puzzled coach Art
Lambert as he watched his
Stanford poloists drop their last
two games last Saturday and
finish third in the Northern
California Aquatics Federation
Invitational Tournament.
In the qualifying rounds the
previous day, the Cards chalked
up three wins and reached the
finals as they ran over San Diego
State, UC-Davis and Long Beach
City College by scores of 5-3, 6-5
and 12-4, respectively.
The Cardinals' onslaught on
the San Diego State goalie was led
by Paul Clark with two goals and
Dean Anderson, Tom Elson and
Drew McDonald with one apiece.
Just four hours later, Stanford
took its second contest of the
day, this time over UC-Davis with
a pair of goals tallied by Clark and
John Roberts, while Rick
Johanson and Craig VanZandt
rounded out the Stanford 6-5
decision, each scoring one goal.
Long Beach City College,
Stanford's last foe in the
qualifying match that day and the
last Cardinal pre-season victory,
was drowned by a 12-goal

Stanford attack. Once again, Clark
led the way with two goals. Elson
and Roberts also netted two goals.
With the change of days came a
change in the Cardinal team.
Stanford opened the finals at
DeAnza Junior College with a 9-6
loss to UC-Irvine. The margin of
victory didn't reflect the game,
however, as with the score tied at
2-2 middle of the second quarter,
Irvine scored three goals in a
one-minute time period. The
Cards caught up to 6-6 later in the
fourth quarter but, due to a lapse
in defense, allowed another three
Irvine goals in one minute.
Stanford couldn't get off the
losing track as the Cardinals were
swarmed upon by the 1973
NCAA champion California Bears,
9-2. The loss placed them in third
place for the tournament.
Stanford hits the road this
weekend as the Cardinals meet
USC and UCLA back-to-back this
Friday and Saturday.
According to Lambert, the
Cards are going to have to get up
for the games during practice this
week.
"If we plan to win this
weekend, we will have to be ready
to compete. We're just going to
have to want to win," he said.

finish third in the Northern
California Aquatics Federation
Invitational Tournament.
In the qualifying rounds the
previous day, the Cards chalked
up three wins and reached the
finals as they ran over San Diego
State, UC-Davis and Long Beach
City College by scores of 5-3, 6-5
and 12-4, respectively.
The Cardinals' onslaught on
the San Diego State goalie was led
by Paul Clark with two goals and
Dean Anderson, Tom Elson and
Drew McDonald with one apiece.
Just four hours later, Stanford
took its second contest of the
day, this time over UC-Davis with
a pair of goals tallied by Clark and
John Roberts, while Rick
Johanson and Craig VanZandt
rounded out the Stanford 6-5
decision, each scoring one goal.
Long Beach City College,
Stanford's last foe in the
qualifying match that day and the
last Cardinal pre-season victory,
was drowned by a 12-goal

Stanford attack. Once again, Clark
led the way with two goals. Elson
and Roberts also netted two goals.
With the change of days came a
change in the Cardinal team.
Stanford opened the finals at
DeAnza Junior College with a 9-6
loss to UC-Irvine. The margin of
victory didn't reflect the game,
however, as with the score tied at
2-2 middle of the second quarter,
Irvine scored three goals in a
one-minute time period. The
Cards caught up to 6-6 later in the
fourth quarter but, due to a lapse
in defense, allowed another three
Irvine goals in one minute.
Stanford couldn't get off the
losing track as the Cardinals were
swarmed upon by the 1973
NCAA champion California Bears,
9-2. The loss placed them in third
place for the tournament.
Stanford hits the road this
weekend as the Cardinals meet
USC and UCLA back-to-back this
Friday and Saturday.
According to Lambert, the
Cards are going to have to get up
for the games during practice this
week.
"If we plan to win this
weekend, we will have to be ready
to compete. We're just going to
have to want to win," he said.
"I don't know what we came
to play, but it sure wasn't water
polo," said a puzzled coach Art
Lambert as he watched his
Stanford poloists drop their last
two games last Saturday and
finish third in the Northern
California Aquatics Federation
Invitational Tournament.
