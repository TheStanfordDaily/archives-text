Ford Rules Out Gas Tax Hike
WASHINGTON — Personally ruling out higher
gasoline taxes, President Ford said yesterday the
anti-inflation program he will present to Congress and the
nation tomorrow "will be a fair one."
As he walked back to the White House from worship
services, Ford told newsmen, "We're in very good shape" in
preparations for the nationally televised and broadcast
address.
The President summoned Treasury Secretary William
Simon, chairman Alan Greenspan of the Council of
Economic Advisers and other aides to the Oval Office
yesterday afternoon to review the package of proposals he
will outline to a joint session of Congress.
A White House spokesman said Ford has yet to make
final decisions on the program. But administration sources
indicate the President is moving toward proposed changes
in the tax structure, to ease the impact of inflation on
lower income families.
Under the tentative plan, these families would receive a
tax cut while those in higher income brackets would fact a
tax increase to make up the difference and bring the federal
budget into balance.
FBI Limits SLA Search
SAN FRANCISCO — Patricia Hearst and Bill and Emily
Harris are the only Symbionese Liberation Army members
sought by the FBI regardless of whether nine other SLA
members exist, the federal agent in charge of the case said
yesterday.
Asked about a Chicago Tribune story that federal agents
believe code names found in SLA hideouts refer to other
surviving SLA members besides the fugitive trio, FBI special
agent in charge Charles Bates said:
"We don't care who is a member. We're interested in
locating three federal fugitives and any information related
to crimes they committed.
"As far as identifying new SLA members or persons
involved, I don't know of anything of that nature. If we
knew of anybody involved in the crimes the SLA
committed or involved to the extent of harboring them we
would get warrants," Bates added in an interview.
The SLA kidnaped Hearst, daughter of newspaper
executive Randolph A. Hearst last Feb. 4. She later joined the
self-styled revolutionary group which was decimated when
six members perished in a May 17 shootout with policy in
Los Angeles.
Chile Buys UJS. Jets
SANTIAGO, Chile — Chile is quietly buying supersonic
jet fighters and close air support attack planes from the
United States in a multimillion dollar arms deal, a
diplomatic source here disclosed yesterday.
Sources say the military government is purchasing the
aircraft and looking for additional weaponry because of
concern that Peru may eventually go to war against Chile.

A high source in the Chilean air force confirmed the
arms deal but said he is "optimistic" about future relations
with Peru's military regime.
Peruvian officians have denied publicly that they want
to wage war on Chile, and Chilean officians also have said
they maintain cordial relations with their northern
neighbor.
Nevertheless, there is concern here that there are a
number of Marxists in the Peruvian military who are not
friendly toward Chile.
The Chilean military overthrew the government of
Marxist President Salvador Allende 13 months ago.
Thousands of Allende supporters went into exile or were
rounded up and imprisoned.
First Lady Continues To Recover
WASHINGTON — First Lady Betty Ford's doctors said
yesterday she was "bright and chipper" and continuing an
excellent recovery from breast cancer surgery eight days
ago.
Dr. William Fouty, chief surgeon at Bethesda Naval
Medical Center, gave the description of Ford's condition in
a bulletin released by the White House.
"She has an excellent appetite and is eating anything she
desires," Fouty said in describing her condition as
excellent.
The bulletin said that after a Saturday evening visit by
the President and comedian Bob Hope, the first lady "spent
a relaxing evening and watched a movie on television."
Her doctors reported she probably will leave the hospital
late this week. One physician said she probably could leave
earlier, but would then have to return to the hospital for a
series of special tests.
Egypt Parades Military Might
CAIRO, Egypt — Egypt paraded its armed might
yesterday to mark the anniversary of last year's war with
Israel and vowed it was ready to fight again to regain the
Sinai Desert.
Israel reported all quiet along the Sinai and Golan fronts,
but in Jerusalem 100 Israelis who fought in the war
gathered outside Premier Yitzhak Rabin's office,
demanding a general election and "an end to our leadership
crisis."
They claimed Rabin, who replaced Golda Meir after the
war, had failed to correct the failings that they believe
brought on the war — "an extravagant lifestyle,
over-confidence and the social gap."
