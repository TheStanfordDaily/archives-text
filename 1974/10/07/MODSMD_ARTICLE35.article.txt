Union Meeting Postponed
Formal National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) hearings to determine
appropriate bargaining units for
Stanford Hospital employees have
been postponed until Nov. 4 while the
hospital and labor organizations
hoping to represent the employees
prepare their presentations.
Five labor organizations, including
United Stanford Employees (USE),
have indicated an interest in
representing units of up to 1200 of the
hospital's 2600 employees.

Labor Relations Act signed into law

determine if they want a union and, if
so, which union.
The period between the informal
conference to discuss appropriate
bargaining units, held last Sept. 20,

synthesize information concerning
different duties and job classifications
of the hospital employees," said John
Schwartz, counsel to the vic.> president
