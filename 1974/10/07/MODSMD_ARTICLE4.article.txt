# World Moves Toward Totalitarianism?
## Hospers Airs Libertarian Views 
### STEPHEN SOBLE 
John Hospers, the Libertarian party
candidate for governor of California,
warned Friday that "whether by
conspiracy or not, the world is being
propelled toward totalitarianism."
In Hospers' view, America is no
exception. An overconcentration of
power in the hands of the bureaucracy
and the gloomy economic situation
increase the likelihood that the
American people will turn, in
desperation, to a strong man, he said.
"We must stop it," said Hospers to
his fellow Libertarians at a fund raising
dinner in Los Altos.
The Libertarian party holds that
governments do not have "the right to
regulate the life of the individual and
seize the fruits of his labor without his
consent." Rather, governments are
only charged with protecting the
individual's right to private property,
and with defending the individual
against physical force and any form of
censorship.
Federal Bureaucracy
Painting a picture of a
power-hungry federal bureaucracy,
Hospers explained that the regulatory
agencies such as the Federal Housing
Administration, Food and Drug
Administration, and Occupational
Safety and Health Administration,
overuse their powers of regulation and
inspection. As a result this government
intervention inhibits the rapid
execution of innovative industrial
change.
Hospers said these agencies, "are
sapping the strength of America and of
its most productive citizens."
For Hospers, government
intervention in the economy is the
root of our current economic woes.

Taxation, deficit spending and the
1933 decision to go off the gold
standard have necessarily entailed
spiraling inflation.
'Hidden Tax'
Inflation, is in effect, a "hidden
tax" levied on the American people to
maintain the power of "big
government" and to pay for its past
errors, Hospers argued.
By building a national political
party Hospers and his followers hope
to attain their goals of curbing the
power of the government and of
creating a free market economy in the
United States.
Since the Libertarian party
primarily aims to affect national
policy, it is building state
organizations with an eye to 1976.
Hospers' stated objective in his

write-in campaign is to receive a
minimum of two percent of the total
vote (about 120,000 votes) so that the
Libertarian party can automatically be
placed on the California ballot in the
1976 presidential election.
Other Libertarian write-in
candidates in California are William
Susel for lieutenant governor, and
William White, an employee at the
Stanford Computer Science Center,
for the U.S. Senate.
The Libertarians have had
experience in Presidential races before.
In 1972 Hospers ran for President,
receiving one electoral vote cast by
Roger Macßride, a renegade
Republican elector from Virginia who
refused to support Richard Nixon.
Macßride, now billed as a folk hero
of the Libertarian movement, also

spoke in Los Altos on Friday.
Predicting a massive Republican
debacle in the 1974 election, Macßride
told 125 people gathered at the dinner
that the Libertarian party will soon be
one of the major U.S. political parties.
He also noted that reporters,
including a columnist for the
Washington Post, were enticed by a
political party boasting of clear
principles and no compromises.
Consequently, the idea of
libertarianism is being spread to those
"Americans who agree in their gut
with us, but who don't know we
exist."
Macßride concluded,
"Libertarianism is an idea whose time
has come. The only defense against it
is stupidity."
