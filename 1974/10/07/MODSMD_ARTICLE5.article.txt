# Administrators Back Residential College
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Two key administrators last Friday
supported creation of some type of
residential college here, but sharply
criticized the ASSU's proposal for
residential education on the overseas
campuses model.
In an interview scheduled for
broadcast at 7 p.m. tomorrow on
KZSU's Campus Conference, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs
said that the idea of a residential
college here deserves "serious
consideration." But Larry Horton,
associate dean of students, said it
would be "virtually impossible" to
implement the ASSU's proposal in its
present form.
Plans for a residential college, called
Stanford-in-Stanford because it is
similar to academic programs at the
overseas campuses, were unveiled by
ASSU President Mike Herman and
anthropology graduate student Tom
Glenn at an ASSU press conference
Sept. 25.
Under the proposal, a policy
committee would select the college's
interdisciplinary theme and choose 45

students and five faculty members to
explore it. Students and faculty would
live and study together in a single
Cowell cluster residence. Both would
be barred from regular academic
activities during the two-quarter
session.
Questions Isolation
Horton objected to isolating
students and faculty from the
academic mainstream of the
University. "We clearly want programs
in the residences that complement
regular academic work. We don't want
something that's totally isolated," he
said.
Gibbs added that "it is impractical
to expect people here in California to
be as separate as they are overseas,"
and questioned whether the Overseas
Studies program was the best model
for an on-campus residential college.
"Faculty like to go overseas to
spend six months in Florence or
Tours," he said. "Would faculty be as
willing to isolate themselves from the
rest of their community right here at
Stanford?"
Detailed Plan
Herman and Glenn should have
consulted faculty members before
making a bid for administrative
support, Gibbs said. He also criticized
Herman and Glenn for not seeking
advice from administrators before
working out the details of their plan.
"Students sometimes feel they
shouldn't come and talk to
administrators if they don't have
something that is very detailed," Gibbs
said. "But we actually feel better
about discussing something when it is
in very rough form and letting the
details grow out of the conversation."
But Gibbs added that the
Stanford-in-Stanford plan had not
attracted faculty backing because "it
isn't concrete enough." Faculty are
not likely to express an interest in a
program until an academic focus is
determined, he claimed.
Funding Problems
Hprman and Glenn should also have
given more thought to the problem of
funding their program, Horton said.
Gibbs doubted that the $150,000
needed to operate Stanford-in-Stan
ford for one year would come from a
foundation grant. Foundations tend to
support innovations in education and
"the idea of a residential college is not
new," he explained.
Horton pointed out that no existing
on-campus residence could
accomodate five faculty residents and
their families plus 45 students. He said
it would cost at least $100,000 to
provide such facilities.
Both administrators suggested
lowering the program's price tag by
allowing faculty associated with the
college to establish offices in the
residence but live elsewhere. That way
"faculty could interact with students
but the faculty would have a chance to
go home to their families in the
evening and lead a life outside the
program," Horton said.
There has been no student response
to the idea other than "a few negative
comments," Horton added. No
housing space can be allocated to the
program until there is an indication of
substantial student interest, he
explained.
Horton said he would not hesitate
to exempt a residential college from
the draw. "Any program that is
educationally justified" should be
allowed to select its members, he said,
claiming that existing theme houses
"justify priority in the draw, but no

exemptions."
Rejecting a suggestion from
sophomore Tim Ferguson that any
financially independent campus
residence should be allowed to select
its members, Horton said. "I don't
think we should make educational
decisions at Stanford merely because
someone pays the bakery bill. They
should not be given space simply
because they are self-supporting."
Herman and Glenn plan to revise
the Stanford-in-Stanford proposal
before the Council of Presidents meets

with the Steering Committee of the
Faculty Senate on Wednesday. 'The
proposal needs some drastic reshaping,
Horton said. He hoped that "a
desirable alternative to the campus
that could be administratively and
financially implemented next year"
would emerge.
Gibbs, who supports "a program of
intensive involvement with
co-residents" expects future discussion
of the residential college idea to center
on "what the program should be and
the easiest way of administering it."
