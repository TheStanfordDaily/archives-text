# Administrators Back Residential College
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Two key administrators last Friday
supported creation of some type of
residential college here, but sharply
criticized the ASSU's proposal for
residential education on the overseas
campuses model.
In an interview scheduled for
broadcast at 7 p.m. tomorrow on
KZSU's Campus Conference, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs
said that the idea of a residential
college here deserves "serious
consideration." But Larry Horton,
associate dean of students, said it
would be "virtually impossible" to
implement the ASSU's proposal in its
present form.
Plans for a residential college, called
Stanford-in-Stanford because it is
similar to academic programs at the
overseas campuses, were unveiled by
ASSU President Mike Herman and
anthropology graduate student Tom
Glenn at an ASSU press conference
Sept. 25.
Under the proposal, a policy
committee would select the college's
interdisciplinary theme and choose 45

students and five faculty members to
explore it. Students and faculty would
live and study together in a single
Cowell cluster residence. Both would
be barred from regular academic
activities during the two-quarter
session.
Questions Isolation
Horton objected to isolating
students and faculty from the
academic mainstream of the
University. "We clearly want programs
in the residences that complement
regular academic work. We don't want
something that's totally isolated," he
said.
Gibbs added that "it is impractical
to expect people here in California to
be as separate as they are overseas,"
and questioned whether the Overseas
Studies program was the best model
for an on-campus residential college.
"Faculty like to go overseas to
spend six months in Florence or
Tours," he said. "Would faculty be as
willing to isolate themselves from the
rest of their community right here at
Stanford?"
Detailed Plan
Herman and Glenn should have
consulted faculty members before
making a bid for administrative
support, Gibbs said. He also criticized
Herman and Glenn for not seeking
advice from administrators before
working out the details of their plan.
"Students sometimes feel they
shouldn't come and talk to
administrators if they don't have
something that is very detailed," Gibbs
said. "But we actually feel better
about discussing something when it is
in very rough form and letting the
details grow out of the conversation."
But Gibbs added that the
Stanford-in-Stanford plan had not
attracted faculty backing because "it
isn't concrete enough." Faculty are
not likely to express an interest in a
program until an academic focus is
determined, he claimed.
Funding Problems
Hprman and Glenn should also have
given more thought to the problem of
funding their program, Horton said.
Gibbs doubted that the $150,000
