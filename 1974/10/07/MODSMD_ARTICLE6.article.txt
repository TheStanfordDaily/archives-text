# Electronic Machinery Aids In Saving Lives

The mysterious machine has a screen with a
bobbing electronic dot. When the dot becomes a
stationary straight line, the patient hovers on the
edge of death. A man with surgical gloves uses the
heart shock machine. The patient is saved.
Dr. James McClure, chief medical
instrumentation engineer at Stanford Medical
Center, repairs and maintains machines like this. "In
the last 15 years, the amount of electronic
machinery in hospitals has increased tremendously,"
McClure said.
One of the newest machines is a biological
telemetry unit installed only four weeks ago. "It's
just like the one in the TV show, Emergency,"
McClure said. A rescue squad relays by phone a
signal that the machine converts into an
electro-cardiogram. A doctor at the hospital uses
this information as he speaks with paramedics.

Dr. Richard Ott, a surgical resident at the Med
Center said, "Last week a man's life was definitely
saved by the timely efforts of the paramedic unit.
Within several years there will probably be a whole
network of such paramedic units in the Bay Area
tied into hospitals by similar machines."
Machines help doctors and nurses in many ways,
according to Dr. Allen Ream, chairman of the
Hospital Instrumentation Committee. "A machine
may break down but it never gets bored, so it can be
used in situations requiring constant monitoring."
Ream, who holds a master's in electrical
engineering along as well as a medical degree, added,
"Biomedical machines can make certain kinds of
medical measurements quickly and precisely and
handle information faster than a human.
"The popular conception of medical machines is
that they will take the place of nurses and doctors,
an automatic nurse of a sort. That's just not the

case," Ream said. "All machines do is serve as an
extension of doctors and nurses. They allow them
to do more things and help more people than
otherwise possible."
The men who work on these machines are
familiar with their medical application, but
problems still occur. "Sometimes the engineering
and medical people don't understand each other
because neither understands the other's technical
language," McClure explained.
McClure said that it was "frustrating" for the
technician when the doctor speaks with medical
terminology. "We're working on a program now
that should help to correct this problem," he said.
Hospital machines measure heart rates and blood
pressure, analyze blood, produce surgical knives
with high-frequency sound waves and correlate data
into manageable form for doctors and nurses.
