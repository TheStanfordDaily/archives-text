# Marine World Night Lures Few Students

### BONNY RODDEN

The five-ton killer whale leaped from
the water and splashed down, wetting
some spectators' clothes.
But Saturday's Stanford night at
Marine World-Africa U.S.A. did not make
much of a splash with students and it
came far from whetting their sense of
adventure.
Fewer than 800 persons showed up to
watch sea lions flap their flippers and
wild birds ride bicycles at the Marine
World extravaganza, according to event
coordinator Rocky Barber.
The ASSU made about $50 above
expenses, Barber said. The money will be
given to the Student Volunteer Center to
be distributed among Optacon Fund,
Operation Share and the Black Student
Center.
Additional Money
The Center will also receive any
additional money from tickets sold to
persons who didn't attend the event.
Marine World will probably "just
about break even," Barber added. The
amusement park agreed to take a
percentage of the gate receipts to cover
costs, he said.
Alumni, faculty, staff and students
who did make it up to Redwood City
strolled among thatched huts and tropical
masks in what park promoters refer to as
"Africa relocated."
Urping Seals
Wandering on dark and nearly deserted
asphalt paths, park visitors made their
way past urping seals and quacking ducks

to observe flying dolphins and prancing
elephants.
But the shows were only held once
prompting one sophomore to complain,
"We came late and missed everything."
And then there were the bands.
Shellback Rose, a blues band, played for
dancers who wanted to put on a show of
their own. The Incomparable Leland
Stanford Jr. University Marching Band
greeted the incoming visitors and later
played at the Jungle Theater.
After the Band, another group of
animals took over as a tige- rode around a
cage on the back of a huge Indian
elephant.
Stanford Jokes
Though the event did have its
shortcomings, the announcer at the killer
whale show tried to make the spectators
feel at home by cracking Stanford jokes
to go along with the mammals' antics.
"This is Jack Christiansen after today's
game," he proclaimed as a sea lion
whined and squealed.
"Did you see the game?" he asked a
killer whale who rocked back and forth
with affirmation. "Did you like the
outcome?" he demanded of the whale.
The whale swayed sideways on his tail,
mourning the 27-16 loss to Michigan.
Sophomore Steve Abdo summed up
the prevalent view of the evening's
entertainment. "The shows were fun but
much briefer than the ones I've seen at
Sea World and Marineland." He was
disappointed that the animals were
unable to perform perfectly.

CROWD PLEASERS—It was hard to tell which of the performers the crowd ogled Saturday night at Marine v
World's Jungle Theater— the elephant or his sparsely clad trainer. About 800 Stanford affiliates came to the X
event, which raised approximately $50 for the Student Volunteer Center. Q
