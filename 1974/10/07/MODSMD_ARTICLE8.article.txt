# Residential Study

Knowledge of the first draft o
the ASSU Council of Presidents
proposal for a residential stud}
program at Stanford has been i
part of the public domain now foi
nearly two weeks. I believe it h
time to correct severa
misconceptions of the proposa
and of the intention behind it:
public release which certair
members of the administratior
have inadvertently misinterpreted
To refresh the mer.ories of tht
readers of the Daily, our proposal
in a simplified version (reduced
from a 20-page study) calls for a
residential facility that would be
set aside for the participation by
3 to 5 faculty members and about
45 students in an intensive
academic study of a specific
intellectual focus conceived by
the participating faculty members.
The program would be scheduled
at two-quarter intervals as in the
case of the overseas campuses.
As such, articles in the Daily
have implied that our proposal
was presented to the university
community as a fait accompli,
that we have "sprung the plan
full-blown." Webster's Dictionary
defines the word "proposal" as
"an act of putting forward or
stating something for
consideration." That is, in fact,
what we have attempted to
do—not ask for an endorsement
but for consideration and analysis
of our presentation of such
factors as personnel, facilities,
administrative structure,
curriculum, and activities—all of
which are necessary components
of any workable program.
Announcement
A second point along the same
line is that the press conference
that was held to announce the
existence of this porposal was not
called to imply that our proposal
was a finished product. One of the
most oft-heard criticisms of the
ASSU in general is that students
rarely are told what their elected
representatives are doing. The
intent of the conference was to
acquaint the university
community with the progress of
one of the services we offered on
our platform in our campaign for
the COP last spring. Anyone who
took the time to listen to my
opening statement at the
conference over KZSU would
know that.
It should be noted that
criticisms of the program stem
entirely from practical

112 considerations and not from the
academic content or merit of the
' proposal.
i One of those practical
r considerations relates to money.
> At the news conference, co-author
I Tom Glenn was asked to give an
I estimate of what the program
» could cost; his response was that
i the program "could cost up to
i $150,000." Since that time, in
. following Daily articles, the
112 speculative portion of that
, statement has been taken as fact,
I with the phrase now being written
i as "would cost up to $150,000."
There is little way, given any sort
of fiscal responsibility, that such a
program could approach that
figure; in point of fact, in recent
discussions with Associate Dean
of Students Larry Horton,
estimates of possible programs ran
only as high as the room and
board of four students, or $3000.
Final Consideration
A final consideration comes
from those who question who was
involved with and informed of the
proposal before its public release.
It is a known reality that any
program requiring planning which
is undertaken by the COP with
any hope of seeing some form of
progress or fruition before the
close of their term of office must
be planned during the summer
months prior to the openings of
the school year. Consequently,
much student support for any
program by the COP must be
translated from electoral
acceptance in the spring. In the
case of this proposal, in fact,
numerous bibliographical
references were noted, including
those of such student-initiated
programs as Whitman House; as
one student noted correctly in a
Daily article, our proposal is
generally "what we're after at
Whitman —with some
modifications."
As far as faculty involvement is
concerned, since the start of this
quarter, we have spoken formally
to at least two dozen
faculty-administrators and
full-time faculty in the hope of
gaining valuable comments and
suggestions on our program.
Faculty perspective is obviously
essential; our knowledge of that is
substantiated by the fact that
Tom Glenn was, for four years at
Franklin and Marshall College, a
member of the faculty.
Our proposal has now been
criticized publicly by many who
have, in the past, expressed
support for the highly-regarded
innovation of residential
education. We now ask them to
join us in the further
improvement of our program for
the benefit of the entire university
community.
