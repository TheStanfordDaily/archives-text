Tandberg TCD-310
Everything you hear
is true.
If you think Oslo is the stereo cassette capital of the
world, you've been listening to the new Tandberg
TCD-310. Measuring the way others do, Tandberg
can claim a signal-to-noise ratio of 65 dB, lEC
weighted, with QO2 and Dolby* But let us tell you
the unweighted figure. An even more impressive
52d8. Here are some other features that make
TCD-310 the pride of Norway:
• Extended frequency response, constant speed and in
audible wow and flutter.
• Three motors One hysteresis synchronous drive motor,
and two servo controlled direct drive spooling motors.
• Electronic push-button controls.
• Expanded range peak reading meters that warn you about -
distortion before it happens
• Two flywheels and dual capstan closed-loop tape drive
for absolute stability.
• Guaranteed performance, 2 year warranty.
By now you must have the idea that TCD-310 is no
ordinary cassette deck. Listen to it. Look at the price
tag. You'll walk out a Tandberg believer.
