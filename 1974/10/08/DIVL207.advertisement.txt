minds
matter
MITRE is a place which daily faces the challenge of minds over matter, and where,
even more importantly, minds matter a lot. Since we're a nonprofit system engineering
company operating wholly in the public interest and dealing with tough problems
assigned to us by more than a score of governmental agencies, we know that our
greatest resource is the human mind. And we know that the kind of mind we need also
needs to know that it will be working on important problems with other professionals.
What's more, we'll be quite specific in spelling out your assignment to you. All of this
because you matter. .â€¢. and because at MITRE, minds matter.
We are currently seeking new graduates to work in command and control systems,
information processing systems, electronic surveillance systems, communications
systems, and environmental, health and other social systems.
If you're an EE, Computer Science, Math, Operations Research, or Physics major, you
could be working on problems in telecommunications, voice communications, micro
wave and digital signal processing, educational information systems, radar design,
propagation studies or advanced modulation, coding, error control and data
compression techniques.
Or, you might want to get involved with solid waste disposal techniques, digital informa
tion systems, data handling and reduction, microprogramming techniques, data base
structure, time sharing, text processing, management information systems, computer
program design and development or evaluation of present day software for phase-over
to next generation machines. These are just a few of the areas in which you might get
involved at MITRE.
All of these positions require a minimum of a BS degree. If you have more than a
bachelor's, that's even better. Almost % of our 750 technical staff members have
advanced degrees.
All these openings are at our corporate headquarters at Bedford, Massachusetts
(suburban Boston). If you are interested and think you can meet our standards, send us
your resume. Better yet, we'd like to talk to vou on campus. Sign up at your Placement
Office. We'll be there on October 17 and 18.
