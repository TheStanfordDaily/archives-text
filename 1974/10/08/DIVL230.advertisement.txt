Electrostatic highs combined with dynamic lows.
Until now, you had to choose between the clear, smooth highs of our elec
trostatic phone, and the heavy bass of our dynamic phone. We combined
both in the new Electro-Pro. So you can enjoy the highest notes on the
moog, mellotron, or electric fiddle, without missing the driving beat of the
bass guitar and drums. Turn up the volume, no distortion. The Electro-Pro
comes in black, with Chroma trim, and a 15 foot coil cord. Its comfort lies
in its lightness, its fully adjustable headband, and soft ear
cushions. The electrostatic element and mylar woofer
are inside the phones, while the crossover and power j&Wff
components are housed in a self protecting energizer. flflv 65
Overall response is 10-24,000 Hz. 1 year guarantee.
