# Cranston Offers Cure For Raging Inflation
## 
### THOMAS CREMA 
SAN FRANCISCO—Sen. Alan
Cransto,n (D-Calif.) said Sunday that
the federal government "must reduce
substantially" military aid to foreign
countries, including U.S. troops, to
halt runaw ay inflation.
But Cranston added that a large
percentage of funds now being used to
sustain U.S . troops abroad should be
appropriated to "domestic programs
designed to improve transportation,
education, health care and housing,"
instead of cut from the federal budget.
Cranston, campaigning for
re-election against Republican state
Sen. H. L. Richardson, claimed that
"the U.S. government appropriates $5
billion in military aid to 58
dictatorships every year." Cranston
supports a bill now before Congress to
phase out .ill foreign aid to
"dictators."
Speaking to reporters from several
Bay Area college newspapers, Cranston
stated that he is "strongly opposed" to
the role the CLA allegedly played in
the overthrow of former Chilean
President Salvador Allende's
government last fall, and that "the
situation was to o analogous to our
intervention in Vit 'tnam."
Cranston and Senators J. William
Fulbright (D-Ai k.) and Stuart
Symington (D-Mo .) have introduced
legislation to requ ire total disclosure
of all money appropriated to and
spent by the CIA.
'Very Hopeful'
Cranston is "vei *y hopeful of the
bill as it has already gained support
from both sides of the Senate."
Senators Howard IBaker (R-Tenn.),
Lowell Weicker (11-Conn.), Frank
Church (D-Idaho) ,nnd Philip Hart
(D-Mich.) also support the legislation,
Cranston said.
Calling himself "d'eeply involved"
in President Ford's economic summit
conference, Cranston supports
legislation to expend tax money for

large-scale public employment.
Cranston claimed that "local
governments would be provided with
federal funds in order to create new
jobs for members of their
communities, cutting the
unemployment rate— now 5.8 percent
nationally and over 8 percent in
California."
Differences
The main differences between this
proposed type of public employment
and the post-Depression Works
Progress Administration are that "the
jobs would be of value, designed to
teach a skill, and would last no longer
than one year," said Cranston.
In an attempt to ease the effects of
inflation, Cranston supports "tax
breaks for those in the lowest levels of
income."
Cranston reserved judgment on the
newly proposed gasoline tax, but said
that effective methods of cutting U.S.
energy consumption must be initiated.
Cranston stated that he would "hope
to avoid rationing, yet we may be
driven to it later."
Optimism
The senator expressed optimism
about the new 10-year program to
develop alternative energy sources. He
called it"the third crash scientific
program the U.S. has undertaken "
after the Manhattan Project to develop
the atomic bomb during World War II
and the space program of the late
1950s and 19605.
Cranston supports "limited
offshore drilling for oil" and said the
government "must consider the impact
of any such action before
implementing programs that may harm
the environment."
Cranston declined to take any
position on state Proposition 17,
which would block an Army Corns of
Engineers dam on the Stanislaus River,
yet said, "If the proposition is passed,
Congress will have to take a very close
look at these types of expenditures."
