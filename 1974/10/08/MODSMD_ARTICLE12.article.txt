# In Defense Of P.A. Massage Parlors
## 
### 
Bill Evers

Last week at the Palo Alto City Council
meeting, an ordinance was proposed to
regulate massage parlors. The impetus for the
ordinance came from the city police — a
most unusual occurrence in Palo Alto city
government, as Councilwoman Enid Pearson
pointed out at the meeting.
Even though the suggested law came from
the police, it was cloaked in the usual weasel
words of modern regulatory liberalism. The
letter introducing the ordinance reeked of
concern for safety, sanitation, proper
working conditions, and"the hazards of
being exposed to untrained technicians."
But beneath the cloying rhetoric about
the "general health and welfare of the
community" was a classically Puritan effort
to crack down on prostitution. The police
believe prostitution is associated with
massage parlors here. (Whether or not the
police are right is a matter in dispute.)
In the wording of the ordinance, one finds
elaborate licensing provisions designed to
violate the civil liberties, especially the
privacy, of massage parlor operators and
employees.
Everybody is required to be photographed
and fingerprinted by the police. Owners are
forced to provide a detailed history of their
business activities to the police.
All investigating officials of the city are
authorized to enter without a warrant any
and all massage parlors at any time during
business hours, during which hours the
massage parlors are required to leave all
exterior doors unlocked. This "no knock
entry" formula gives the ordinance a police
state character.
A Woman's Right
One can believe that being a prostitute is
probably not exactly the road to true

happiness, while still believing that a person
has a right to be a prostitute — just as one
can believe that taking drugs is generally not
the road to true happiness while believing
that all drugs should be legal. Both the
importance of moral choice and the variety
of human individuals make this freedom
necessary.
A woman (or a man — there are male
prostitutes) owns her own body. This is the
important truth that has emerged out of the
vociferous debate surrounding abortion. A
woman owns her own reproductive system,
her sexual organs. They do n<?t belong to the
state (sometimes euphemistically called
"society"). They are hers to use or abuse.
Regulation by the government is an invasion
of privacy and a denial of human liberty.
The desire to prevent prostitution is to
some extent rooted in Western religious
beliefs that uphold the Virgin Mary as the
ideal for womankind and Puritanism that
regards enjoyment as sinful in itself.
But more broadly, efforts to stamp out
prostitution represent a holdover of
pre-capitalist consciousness of women's
place. The cultural lag here tends to keep
women in a serf-like status bound by
obligations, duties, and responsibilities.
Special Status
The attitudes involved focus on a special
status in which women are to be kept.
Women are to be confined to their proper
station and are not allowed to be
freely-contracting human beings in any
occupation or social role.
Part of keeping women in their place is
isolating them from what Marx called the
cash nexus. In the marketplace the web of
status is broken. It is partly for this reason
that the prejudice against career-oriented

women persists. The prostitute is an easy
target, a scapegoat, for those holding this
attitude.
A remaining facet of the prostitution issue
that holds a special appeal for advocates of
the Bismarckian welfare state is licensing
prostitutes to prevent venereal disease.
The sacred cow of public health has long
sanctioned the violation of human rights.
Forced vaccination, forced floridation, and
forced blood transfusions have been imposed
on conscientious objectors, especially
Christian Scientists and Jehovah's Witnesses.
Forced sterilization has been visited upon
those with unusual genetic backgrounds.
The religious liberty of prostitutes of
Christian Science background is violated by
compulsory medical supervision of
prostitution. (Of course, a tort action should
be available to any customer when a
prostitute falsely claims to be healthy.)
The proper activity for the police is
preventing and investigating crimes of
violence. There is all too much rape, robbery,
and murder as it is.
Wasted Money
Yet police continue to waste money taken
from the taxpayers to control and prevent
activities in which all the parties are
consenting adults. In acts of prostitution
there is no complaining victim.
Instead of a society overburdened with
social control, we should strive for a society
in which there is full liberty.
There will be a policy committee meeting
on massage parlors sometime in October,
followed by a Council meeting discusssing
the subject. Those interested should attend
to defend the freedom of massage parlors.

ordinance came from the city police — a
most unusual occurrence in Palo Alto city
government, as Councilwoman Enid Pearson
pointed out at the meeting.
Even though the suggested law came from
the police, it was cloaked in the usual weasel
words of modern regulatory liberalism. The
letter introducing the ordinance reeked of
concern for safety, sanitation, proper
working conditions, and"the hazards of
being exposed to untrained technicians."
But beneath the cloying rhetoric about
the "general health and welfare of the
community" was a classically Puritan effort
to crack down on prostitution. The police
believe prostitution is associated with
massage parlors here. (Whether or not the
police are right is a matter in dispute.)
In the wording of the ordinance, one finds
elaborate licensing provisions designed to
violate the civil liberties, especially the
privacy, of massage parlor operators and
employees.
Everybody is required to be photographed
and fingerprinted by the police. Owners are
forced to provide a detailed history of their
business activities to the police.
All investigating officials of the city are
authorized to enter without a warrant any
and all massage parlors at any time during
business hours, during which hours the
massage parlors are required to leave all
exterior doors unlocked. This "no knock
entry" formula gives the ordinance a police
state character.
A Woman's Right
One can believe that being a prostitute is
probably not exactly the road to true

happiness, while still believing that a person
has a right to be a prostitute — just as one
can believe that taking drugs is generally not
the road to true happiness while believing
that all drugs should be legal. Both the
importance of moral choice and the variety
of human individuals make this freedom
necessary.
A woman (or a man — there are male
prostitutes) owns her own body. This is the
important truth that has emerged out of the
vociferous debate surrounding abortion. A
woman owns her own reproductive system,
her sexual organs. They do n<?t belong to the
state (sometimes euphemistically called
"society"). They are hers to use or abuse.
Regulation by the government is an invasion
of privacy and a denial of human liberty.
The desire to prevent prostitution is to
some extent rooted in Western religious
beliefs that uphold the Virgin Mary as the
ideal for womankind and Puritanism that
regards enjoyment as sinful in itself.
But more broadly, efforts to stamp out
prostitution represent a holdover of
pre-capitalist consciousness of women's
place. The cultural lag here tends to keep
women in a serf-like status bound by
obligations, duties, and responsibilities.
Special Status
The attitudes involved focus on a special
status in which women are to be kept.
Women are to be confined to their proper
station and are not allowed to be
freely-contracting human beings in any
occupation or social role.
Part of keeping women in their place is
isolating them from what Marx called the
cash nexus. In the marketplace the web of
status is broken. It is partly for this reason
that the prejudice against career-oriented

women persists. The prostitute is an easy
target, a scapegoat, for those holding this
attitude.
A remaining facet of the prostitution issue
that holds a special appeal for advocates of
the Bismarckian welfare state is licensing
prostitutes to prevent venereal disease.
The sacred cow of public health has long
sanctioned the violation of human rights.
Forced vaccination, forced floridation, and
forced blood transfusions have been imposed
on conscientious objectors, especially
Christian Scientists and Jehovah's Witnesses.
Forced sterilization has been visited upon
those with unusual genetic backgrounds.
The religious liberty of prostitutes of
Christian Science background is violated by
compulsory medical supervision of
prostitution. (Of course, a tort action should
be available to any customer when a
prostitute falsely claims to be healthy.)
The proper activity for the police is
preventing and investigating crimes of
violence. There is all too much rape, robbery,
and murder as it is.
Wasted Money
Yet police continue to waste money taken
from the taxpayers to control and prevent
activities in which all the parties are
consenting adults. In acts of prostitution
there is no complaining victim.
Instead of a society overburdened with
social control, we should strive for a society
in which there is full liberty.
There will be a policy committee meeting
on massage parlors sometime in October,
followed by a Council meeting discusssing
the subject. Those interested should attend
to defend the freedom of massage parlors.

Even though the suggested law came from
the police, it was cloaked in the usual weasel
words of modern regulatory liberalism. The
letter introducing the ordinance reeked of
concern for safety, sanitation, proper
working conditions, and"the hazards of
being exposed to untrained technicians."
But beneath the cloying rhetoric about
the "general health and welfare of the
community" was a classically Puritan effort
to crack down on prostitution. The police
believe prostitution is associated with
massage parlors here. (Whether or not the
police are right is a matter in dispute.)
In the wording of the ordinance, one finds
elaborate licensing provisions designed to
violate the civil liberties, especially the
privacy, of massage parlor operators and
employees.
Everybody is required to be photographed
and fingerprinted by the police. Owners are
forced to provide a detailed history of their
business activities to the police.
All investigating officials of the city are
authorized to enter without a warrant any
and all massage parlors at any time during
business hours, during which hours the
massage parlors are required to leave all
exterior doors unlocked. This "no knock
entry" formula gives the ordinance a police
state character.
A Woman's Right
One can believe that being a prostitute is
probably not exactly the road to true

happiness, while still believing that a person
has a right to be a prostitute — just as one
can believe that taking drugs is generally not
the road to true happiness while believing
that all drugs should be legal. Both the
importance of moral choice and the variety
of human individuals make this freedom
necessary.
A woman (or a man — there are male
prostitutes) owns her own body. This is the
important truth that has emerged out of the
vociferous debate surrounding abortion. A
woman owns her own reproductive system,
her sexual organs. They do n<?t belong to the
state (sometimes euphemistically called
"society"). They are hers to use or abuse.
Regulation by the government is an invasion
of privacy and a denial of human liberty.
The desire to prevent prostitution is to
some extent rooted in Western religious
beliefs that uphold the Virgin Mary as the
ideal for womankind and Puritanism that
regards enjoyment as sinful in itself.
But more broadly, efforts to stamp out
prostitution represent a holdover of
pre-capitalist consciousness of women's
place. The cultural lag here tends to keep
women in a serf-like status bound by
obligations, duties, and responsibilities.
Special Status
The attitudes involved focus on a special
status in which women are to be kept.
Women are to be confined to their proper
station and are not allowed to be
freely-contracting human beings in any
occupation or social role.
Part of keeping women in their place is
isolating them from what Marx called the
cash nexus. In the marketplace the web of
status is broken. It is partly for this reason
that the prejudice against career-oriented

women persists. The prostitute is an easy
target, a scapegoat, for those holding this
attitude.
A remaining facet of the prostitution issue
that holds a special appeal for advocates of
the Bismarckian welfare state is licensing
prostitutes to prevent venereal disease.
The sacred cow of public health has long
sanctioned the violation of human rights.
Forced vaccination, forced floridation, and
forced blood transfusions have been imposed
on conscientious objectors, especially
Christian Scientists and Jehovah's Witnesses.
Forced sterilization has been visited upon
those with unusual genetic backgrounds.
The religious liberty of prostitutes of
Christian Science background is violated by
compulsory medical supervision of
prostitution. (Of course, a tort action should
be available to any customer when a
prostitute falsely claims to be healthy.)
The proper activity for the police is
preventing and investigating crimes of
violence. There is all too much rape, robbery,
and murder as it is.
Wasted Money
Yet police continue to waste money taken
from the taxpayers to control and prevent
activities in which all the parties are
consenting adults. In acts of prostitution
there is no complaining victim.
Instead of a society overburdened with
social control, we should strive for a society
in which there is full liberty.
There will be a policy committee meeting
on massage parlors sometime in October,
followed by a Council meeting discusssing
the subject. Those interested should attend
to defend the freedom of massage parlors.
