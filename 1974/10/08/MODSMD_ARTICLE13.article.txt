Rock Not Stolen
Editor:
I must object to Joan Hinman's
Daily (Oct. 1) characterization of
50s rock and roll as "stolen" from
black artists by whites. Pat Boone
did not steal "Tutti Frutti" from
Little Richard any more than
Peter, Paul and Mary stole
"Blowin* in the Wind" from Bob
Dylan. Doing a different version
of a song does not constitute
theft.
Hinman has fallen into a trap
common to rock critics. She
ignores the fact that white
"cover" versions of black hits
actually got rock and roll on the
road. Black artists had a lot of
trouble getting their music onto
AM radio during the 50s; white
performers, though, could get the
same material before a mass
audience. Cover versions were
actually a cultural advance that
helped speed the emergence of
rock and roll.
As such they should be praised,
not reviled as criminal.

Immature Students
Editor:
When I escaped from high
school four years ago, I left
behind an environment whic'fl,
condoned the forcible imposition
on other people of a person's ovtrn
ego-trips, whether they be the
showering of paper airplar.es,
hooting at an unappreciated
movie, or the like. I fined it
incredible that in cominp; to
Stanford as a grad student, I 'nave
returned to just such an
environment. The front page
feature in the Sept. 30 Daily
belies the support this immaturity
receives from the students of a
University reputed to be "elite."
Incredible.

A New Fan Club?
Editor:
All this talk about having
another Jim Plunkett j'm our midst
â€” all the time we've had another
Don Bunce and didn't even know
it! Anybody wanna help form a
Jerry Waldvogel Fan Club?
