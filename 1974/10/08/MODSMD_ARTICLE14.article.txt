# Senatorial Candidates Announce Platforms
## 
### 
The following are statements by
candidates for ASSU Senate in
Wednesday's and Thursday's
elections. More statements were
published yesterday.
Mary Ann Toman
The housing draw issue is of
major concern, thus I propose to
concentrate on this and other
student services including
implementation of the proposed
Record Co-op. As a member of
the Record Co-op Committee, I
have already gathered information
and have helped to initiate action.
As for the Pub, I was a member of
the Tresidder Union Committee,
so I was able to gain insight into
the operations of the University,
and especially, those problems
holding up the Pub.
Initiative is necessary for both
senators and students. I have
personally contacted Dr.
Mc Clennahan of the Health and
Safety Committee about the
dangerous biking conditions that
exist on parts of the new Campus
Drive close to the Row. I have
proposed two-way asphalt bike
pathways next to he sidewalks.
Immediate action is necessary. I
have taken the first step.
(Mary Ann Toman is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics.)
Jan Pepper
Much work is facing the ASSU
Senate in the area of student
services. An improved Tresidder
food service, a pub, partly
financed by the excess profits of
the Coffee House or Tresidder,
and safer conditions for bicycles
are a few examples.
The Senate also has the
responsibility of appointing
competent and dedicated students
to serve on University committees
in order to assume that the
student view will be an important
factor in administrative decisions.
Plans for future student housing,
particularly, should be approved
by students in terms of placement
on campus and architectural
design.
(Jan Pepper is an undergraduate
majoring in civil engineering.)

M. Scott Smith
As an ASSU senator, I would
advocate a plan creating a student
majority in the student court
system. ASSU-student body
communication would be aided
by regular reporting of ASSU
activity in the Daily and on
KZSU, and by surveys of student
sentiment on current issues. The
current housing crunch should be
eased by construction of low cost,
temporary housing, not by
assimilation of fraternities into
the draw. More thorough advising
and orientation programs are
needed for freshmen and transfer
students — it takes long enough to
figure out what goes on here as it
is.
(M. Scott Smith is an
undergraduate.)
Mike Dorsey
Maybe I'm a hopeless idealist
(as some of my friends suggest),
but I believe in the concept of
people getting together to work
for something they believe in. I
further believe in the concept of
student government: students
working together in many ways
for the benefit of the entire
student body.
Now, why me? As I stated in
my campaign literature, I believe
that I have the necessary
experience and enthusiasm to be
an effective senator. Before
coming to Stanford I served as
Associated Student Body
President for my high school
(please forgive my accidental
ommission of "high school" in
campaign literature) and, last
year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always
agree with the Council-of-
Presidents, I have confidence in
them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I
thoroughly enjoy this kind of
work, I can readily make my one
promise: to attend every meeting.
(Mike Dorsey is an
undergraduate.)
Jody Meisel
My primary concerns, aside

from the obvious need to make
the Senate into a more viable and
better publicized organization,
include the following:
1) Securing on-campus housing
for all undergraduates who desire
it.
2) Making public hearings a
continued part of the University's
decision-making process.
3) Seeking increased financial
aid and better part-time jobs,
including the placement of
undergraduates in jobs related to
their studies.
4) Improving the present
advisor system.
My experience includes
working with educational
administrators and elected
officials of the Los Angeles Board
of Education, both on a city-wide
student committee and later as a
full-time employee.
(Jody Meisal is an undergraduate
majoring in history.)
Pete Truex
As Stanford students, there are
some problems that we should try
to solve together. The current
housing shortage is of utmost
importance to everybody, and the
lack of campus social activities is
another field where there's a lot
of room for improvement. If
elected, I'll do my best to solve
these and other problems that
face us here at Stanford. I'm
willing to work for you.
(Pete Truex is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Beth Wood
This is my first year at
Stanford so I have not served in
any organizations on campus
previously. However, I feel that I
am well qualified for this position
as I was very active student
government during my high
school years and served as
Vice-president of my Student
Council.
As a member of several
minorities on campus — I am a
black freshwoman planning to
major in pre-law and I live in
Burbank. I feel that I would prove
successful in representing a
substancial portion of the

Stanford populace.
I am prepared to work for the
benefit of Stanford students
through the ASSU Senate right
away but first I need your vote on
October 9 and 10.
(Beth Wood is an undergraduate.)
Eleanor Lynds
I believe the Seante can work
for you, but steps should be taken
to make you more aware of what
issues are coming before the
senators. I will work to create
such interaction. I will bring an
open-minded and responsive voice
to our government, without any
commitments or obligations to
any special interest group.
The issues that will come
before the Senate are important —
the housing problem, the related
question of the future of
Fraternities, the inadequate
service provided by our current
Tresidder food service, the Pub,
and as always the selection of the
Nominations committee. The
Senate needs your opinions, and
above all, senators who are
concerned with maximizing
benefits for all students.
Support a dependable
candidate, concerned with being
an equitable voice and responsive
to you.
(Eleanor Lynds is an
undergraduate majoring in art
history.)
Davis, Germaine, Gray,
Silton, Strnad, Sumner
Students must realize that we
are as important a part of the
Stanford community as the
faculty, administration, and staff.
The student body has the right to
have its views become an integral
part of every important decision.
We are running because we believe
that the ASSU can serve as an
effective student advocate, not
just a clearinghouse for ideas.
Alternatives in housing should
always be open to Stanford
students. Fraternities, then,
should be allowed to exist simply
to add to the diversity of the
University (not because dues and
initiation fees have bought them a
privilege). In order to comply
with Title IX, fraternities should
be allowed to be coed when they

so desire. And more importantly,
theme houses .should also become
exempt from I;he draw in order to
maintain continuity and strength
in the theme.
Of course, the real problem is
the on-camptjs housing shortage.
It is imperative that more student
housing be built, and that the
highest housing priority be
student — not emeritus — housing.
We propose to develop in
conjunction with present
committees a student housing
plan (as th e first part of a student
Land Use plan) that will articulate
student priorities to the
administration and defend these
priorities.
The situation for women at
Stanford is improving. We will do
everything possible to further this
progress.
In orc?ier to reach more women,
we will vote to appropriate funds
for a newsletter on all women's
activities;, and aid all valuable
projects by sisters at Stanford. WE
approve of the appointment of
the Assistnat Dean for Women
and will maintain this important
liaison.. We support the
Organization of Stanford Women
Athletes in its work to gain
equal ity.
The Course Review is the
beginning of real student course
evaluation, but it needs funding to
cove r more courses and to insure a
return of all student opinions.
Wit'fi a respected, comprehensive
Course Review, we can provide a
basis for eventual student input
into tenure decisions. We support
the proposals that the Economics
Department should offer a full
spf.-ctrum of academically
respected thought, and feel that
all academic departments should
b<a more receptive to student
desires for new courses.
(Cynthia Davis, Charlotte
Germane, Chris Gray, Debbi
Hilton, Lyse Strnad, and Mike
Sumner are all undergraduates.)
Janeway, Max
We will work to provide
government responsive to the
attitudes and needs of the
Stanford Student Body.
(Kate Janeway is an
undergraduate majoring in
humanities. Wendy Max is an
undergraduate majoring in
history.)
Krohn, Sobotka
In talking with many of our
friends before deciding to run for
seats in the ASSU Senate, we
began to realize that perhaps our
finest qualification for office lay
in our lack of commitment to the
established ASSU hierarchy. We
have noted consistently the
growing pre-occupation of the
ASSU with its organizational
structure, leading to extended
discussion of ornamental issues.
We have similarly noted the
disappearance of the ASSU Senate
as an open forum for the candid
airing of real questions facing the
Stanford community.
We have witnessed the
unfortunate lack of student input
in major University decisions.
Notable shortcomings have
included: student housing
(student placement,
determination of independent
status, Resident Fellow and RA
selection), food service (Why is
there a 40 percent overhead?),
academic direction and the
granting of professorial tenure,
and the administration's
misguided priorities. The list of
very real issues yet to be acted
upon will continue to grow as
long as the Senate closes its mind
and ears. We will listen, and we
will act.
(Doug Krohn is an undergraduate
majoring in mathematics and
philosophy. Paul Sobotka is an
undergraduate majoring in
chemistry.)
Ruben Sanchez
An understanding of the
responsibilities of a student
senator begins with the
recognition that he, or she, is

there to represent. And before
this objective can be reached, a
much more prominant one must
be secured. One of understanding
Stanford University's bureaucratic
scheme. In essence, learning the
sytem, in order to work within it.
Any change, great or small,
necessitates time. As a freshman,
knowledge of such undergoings
will be profitable not only for the
present, but in future encounters,
as well.
(Ruben Sanchez is an
undergraduate.)
Bill Cortes
ASSU Senate campaigns are
typically cluttered with vague
generalizations and hollow
promises as candidates attempt to
capitalize on false issues while
sliding sideways in the face of
really controversial matters. What
is needed is a concrete approach
to problems that directly affect
students and a genuine desire to
effect productive change.
The current housing shortage,
the impending demise of the
fraternity system, the autocratic
policies regarding theme houses,
and the inadequacies of the
residence staffs as perpetrated by
the closed selection and lack of
periodic evaluation of resident
fellows and resident assistants all
point to a need for reform in the
residential education system.
Student input is also needed if
Tresidder is to resume an
improved role in serving
off-campus students and if
student services are to be
increased for transfers.
Real action can be expected
from the Senate only if candidates
with solid programs are elected.
Students should utilize one of the
few direct inputs available to
them and see that this is done.
(Bill Cortes is an undergraduate

majoring in political science.)
Brad Levin
We must study and re-evaluate
the method of administering
examinations at Stanford and the
University grading system, for I
believe that they both contain
some basic faults and
inconsistencies. I will seek the
establishment of an ASSU
committee to study the problems,
to evaluate the system, and to
come up with some workable
solutions.
I've also made a big promise to
all freshmen; not only do I intend
to keep that promise, but now I
extend it to the transfer students.
I believe that there are certain
needs and desires which are
peculiar to freshmen and transfers
and which, up until now, have
gone unrepresented. These
students need greater access
to information and a clearer
explanation of student activities
and programs, so their transition
into the new Stanford
environment will be easier. These
students need a voice, and they
must have greater representation
in all phases of student
government. Finally, these
students need more attention and
honest advice, by providing higher
housing priorities for transfers, by
involving these students in
innovative studies or programs,
and by assisting them in making
important course and career
decisions.
(Brad Levin is an undergraduate.)
Weld, Bergerac
As a result of the system by
which ASSU senators are elected,
freshmen are inadvertently
deprived of fair representation.
Despite the fact that over
one-quarter of the undergraduates
are freshmen, there were no
freshmen senators last year. The
reason for this is quite clear: The

elections are held now, freshmen
learn about the Senate later.
While we realize that
orientation takes time, in a few
weeks freshmen will be as aware
of their goals and expectations as
anyone at Stanford Yet without a
change, they will continue to go
without representation in the
ASSU senate. To alleviate this
problem we have gone out of our
way to familiarize ourselves with
the responsibilities of a senator.
We have talked to senators,
current presidents, and most
importantly to the students around
us. Having recognized what we
feel is an injustice, we have
decided to run for senatorial
positions on the platform of equal
representation.
The process of specialization,
by nature, is one that over the
years draws the individual away
from the University as a whole. As
freshmen, we have more time and
optimistic enthusiasm which we
want to apply to more than just
academic life.
(Kit Weld and Randy Bergerac are
undergraduates.)
Jeff Rowe
A University should maintain
an atmosphere of open, honest,
unprejudiced intellectual inquiry
and be at the same time dedicated
to the proposition that life is to
be enjoyed by every individual
with his own special flair.
These principles are translated
into the political realm by my
confidence in the Jeffersonian
ideal that the least government is
the best government, and that
every man should have a voice in
it. Should my voice be chosen one
of the representative few, I intend
to raise it in support of
worthwhile, practical projects of
the ASSU that benefit significant
numbers of students, and raise it

even higher against activities that
lack these virtues. Further, I
intend to push for a maintenance
of the current standard of student
life against the usurpations of
administrators who are trying to
reduce the student body to its
lowest common factor:
intellectually, politically and
socially.
(Jeff Rowe is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Reginald Turner
As chairman of the Senate this
past academic year, I have sought
to expose the student body to the
entire functions and activities of
the Senate.
I started the Senate
Communications Report, which
each senator was required to post
in an assigned area and make
himself answerable and available
to this constituency to answer
whatever questions may arise.
I further worked to establish
the two public forums which the
Senate sponsored to better
educate the community about the
emeriti housing situation and the
USE strike.
This is what I've done and if
elected more is yet to come. I
believe that further investigation
is needed into tuition increases,
ID cards, and the possibility of
establishing of a WATS line for all
students to help cut down on long
distance phone call bills.
I am also willing to study
whatever else the students feel
should be done. The Senate is
here to represent, to help and to
improve.
(Reginald Turner is an
undergraduate.)
Jim Feliciano
I am running for the ASSU
Senate with proposals not
promises. Also, I have run once
before, am currently serving on an
ASSU subcommittee, and last

year wrote a paper that has served
as a significant input in the
growing debate about a University
shuttlebus system. You are
probably waiting for some
concrete proposals and I will not
disappoint you:
1) The members of the ASSU
Nominations Committee should
be limited to serving on one
committee.
2) I urge the speedy
implementation of an ASSU
notetaking service.
3) I urge serious study into the
possibility of transforming
Tresidder from a poor cafeteria
into a student center including a
student store.
(Jim Feliciano is an undergraduate
majoring in philosophy.)
Kurt Hunciker
There is little understanding of
what the Senate can and cannot
do: What powers does the ASSU
Senate have? First, it has control
over $75,000 in funds for student
activities and organizations. The
ASSU can also be a focal point for
student activities and
organizations. The ASSU can't
directly increase the amount of
on-campus housing or reform the
curriculum. But, the Senate can
gain significant inroads into the
making of University policy by
hard work and vigorous lobbying.
This implies both passing
resolutions and following them up
by strongly presenting them to
administrators.
The Senate should lobby for
Residential Colleges. A perfect
opportunity exists to
concurrently design the
educational program and the
facilities available for a residential
college in the newly proposed row
houses. Finally, the class note
service and student co-op, both
proposed by the Council of
Presidents, should be

implemented.
(Kurt Hunciker is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics and political science.)
Ira Rubin
I have a sincere desire to help
the University, which has
contributed so much to me
academically, yet proven deficient
in so many other aspects of
college life.
The housing issue is important
to me (as one who has previously
arrived in the fall unassigned and
despairing). I am also concerned
with the future of the overseas
study program and feel I could
benefit the Senate in this respect.
There is one area of concern
which I feel is extremely lacking
at Stanford. With the except of
Fred Hargadon's "personal" letter
of congratuations upon admission
I believe the University is grossly
deficient in communicating with
its students on any but a mass
basis.
(Ira Rubin is an undergraduate
majoring in political science and
communication.)
Tim Coqway
I am running for the ASSU
Senate to express my views and
take an active role in such
problems as the housing shortage
and the lack of cohesive social
activities for the students.
If elected I will:
1) Attend the bi-weekly
meetings of the Senate.
2) Actively seek the opinions
of other students.
3) Consider these opinions and
decide as I see fit.
Vote on Thursday. If you don't
vote, don't gripe!
(Tim Conway is an undergraduate
majoring in chemistry.)
Mark Pigott
I am running for the Senate.
(Mark Pigott is an undergraduate.)
The following are statements by
candidates for ASSU Senate in
Wednesday's and Thursday's
elections. More statements were
published yesterday.
Mary Ann Toman
The housing draw issue is of
major concern, thus I propose to
concentrate on this and other
student services including
implementation of the proposed
Record Co-op. As a member of
the Record Co-op Committee, I
have already gathered information
and have helped to initiate action.
As for the Pub, I was a member of
the Tresidder Union Committee,
so I was able to gain insight into
the operations of the University,
and especially, those problems
holding up the Pub.
Initiative is necessary for both
senators and students. I have
personally contacted Dr.
Mc Clennahan of the Health and
Safety Committee about the
dangerous biking conditions that
exist on parts of the new Campus
Drive close to the Row. I have
proposed two-way asphalt bike
pathways next to he sidewalks.
Immediate action is necessary. I
have taken the first step.
(Mary Ann Toman is an
undergraduate majoring in

Jan Pepper
Much work is facing the ASSU
Senate in the area of student
services. An improved Tresidder
food service, a pub, partly
financed by the excess profits of
the Coffee House or Tresidder,
and safer conditions for bicycles
are a few examples.
The Senate also has the
responsibility of appointing
competent and dedicated students
to serve on University committees
in order to assume that the
student view will be an important
factor in administrative decisions.
Plans for future student housing,
particularly, should be approved
by students in terms of placement
on campus and architectural
design.
(Jan Pepper is an undergraduate

M. Scott Smith
As an ASSU senator, I would
advocate a plan creating a student
majority in the student court
system. ASSU-student body
communication would be aided
by regular reporting of ASSU
activity in the Daily and on
KZSU, and by surveys of student
sentiment on current issues. The
current housing crunch should be
eased by construction of low cost,
temporary housing, not by

people getting together to work
for something they believe in. I
further believe in the concept of
student government: students
working together in many ways
for the benefit of the entire
student body.
Now, why me? As I stated in
my campaign literature, I believe
that I have the necessary
experience and enthusiasm to be
an effective senator. Before
coming to Stanford I served as
Associated Student Body
President for my high school
(please forgive my accidental
ommission of "high school" in
campaign literature) and, last
year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always
agree with the Council-of-
Presidents, I have confidence in
them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I
thoroughly enjoy this kind of
work, I can readily make my one
promise: to attend every meeting.

Jody Meisel
My primary concerns, aside

include the following:
1) Securing on-campus housing

2) Making public hearings a
continued part of the University's
decision-making process.
3) Seeking increased financial
aid and better part-time jobs,
including the placement of
undergraduates in jobs related to
their studies.
4) Improving the present
advisor system.
My experience includes
working with educational
administrators and elected
officials of the Los Angeles Board
of Education, both on a city-wide
student committee and later as a
full-time employee.
(Jody Meisal is an undergraduate
majoring in history.)
Pete Truex
As Stanford students, there are
some problems that we should try
to solve together. The current
housing shortage is of utmost
importance to everybody, and the
lack of campus social activities is
another field where there's a lot
of room for improvement. If
elected, I'll do my best to solve
these and other problems that
face us here at Stanford. I'm
willing to work for you.
(Pete Truex is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Beth Wood
This is my first year at
Stanford so I have not served in
any organizations on campus
previously. However, I feel that I
am well qualified for this position
as I was very active student
government during my high
school years and served as
Vice-president of my Student
Council.
As a member of several
minorities on campus — I am a
black freshwoman planning to
major in pre-law and I live in
Burbank. I feel that I would prove
successful in representing a
substancial portion of the

Stanford populace.
I am prepared to work for the
benefit of Stanford students

I believe the Seante can work

to make you more aware of what
issues are coming before the
senators. I will work to create
such interaction. I will bring an
open-minded and responsive voice
to our government, without any
commitments or obligations to
any special interest group.
The issues that will come
before the Senate are important —
the housing problem, the related
question of the future of
Fraternities, the inadequate
service provided by our current
Tresidder food service, the Pub,
and as always the selection of the
Nominations committee. The
Senate needs your opinions, and
above all, senators who are
concerned with maximizing
benefits for all students.
Support a dependable
candidate, concerned with being
an equitable voice and responsive
to you.
(Eleanor Lynds is an
undergraduate majoring in art

Davis, Germaine, Gray,
Silton, Strnad, Sumner
Students must realize that we
are as important a part of the
Stanford community as the
faculty, administration, and staff.
The student body has the right to
have its views become an integral
part of every important decision.
We are running because we believe
that the ASSU can serve as an
effective student advocate, not
just a clearinghouse for ideas.
Alternatives in housing should
always be open to Stanford

should be allowed to exist simply
to add to the diversity of the

Of course, the real problem is
the on-camptjs housing shortage.
It is imperative that more student

student — not emeritus — housing.
We propose to develop in
conjunction with present
committees a student housing

priorities.
The situation for women at
Stanford is improving. We will do
everything possible to further this

In orc?ier to reach more women,
we will vote to appropriate funds

sliding sideways in the face of
really controversial matters. What
is needed is a concrete approach

The current housing shortage,
the impending demise of the

point to a need for reform in the

Student input is also needed if
Tresidder is to resume an
improved role in serving
off-campus students and if
student services are to be
increased for transfers.
Real action can be expected
from the Senate only if candidates
with solid programs are elected.
Students should utilize one of the
few direct inputs available to
them and see that this is done.

Brad Levin
We must study and re-evaluate
the method of administering
examinations at Stanford and the
University grading system, for I
believe that they both contain
some basic faults and
inconsistencies. I will seek the
establishment of an ASSU
committee to study the problems,
to evaluate the system, and to
come up with some workable
solutions.
I've also made a big promise to
all freshmen; not only do I intend
to keep that promise, but now I
extend it to the transfer students.
I believe that there are certain
needs and desires which are
peculiar to freshmen and transfers
and which, up until now, have
gone unrepresented. These
students need greater access
to information and a clearer
explanation of student activities
and programs, so their transition
into the new Stanford
environment will be easier. These
students need a voice, and they
must have greater representation
in all phases of student
government. Finally, these
students need more attention and
honest advice, by providing higher
housing priorities for transfers, by
involving these students in
innovative studies or programs,
and by assisting them in making
important course and career
decisions.
(Brad Levin is an undergraduate.)
Weld, Bergerac
As a result of the system by
which ASSU senators are elected,
freshmen are inadvertently
deprived of fair representation.
Despite the fact that over
one-quarter of the undergraduates
are freshmen, there were no
freshmen senators last year. The
reason for this is quite clear: The

elections are held now, freshmen
learn about the Senate later.
While we realize that
orientation takes time, in a few
weeks freshmen will be as aware
of their goals and expectations as
anyone at Stanford Yet without a
change, they will continue to go
without representation in the
ASSU senate. To alleviate this
problem we have gone out of our
way to familiarize ourselves with
the responsibilities of a senator.
We have talked to senators,
current presidents, and most
importantly to the students around
us. Having recognized what we
feel is an injustice, we have
decided to run for senatorial
positions on the platform of equal
representation.
The process of specialization,
by nature, is one that over the
years draws the individual away
from the University as a whole. As
freshmen, we have more time and
optimistic enthusiasm which we
want to apply to more than just
academic life.
(Kit Weld and Randy Bergerac are
undergraduates.)
Jeff Rowe
A University should maintain
an atmosphere of open, honest,
unprejudiced intellectual inquiry
and be at the same time dedicated
to the proposition that life is to
be enjoyed by every individual
with his own special flair.
These principles are translated
into the political realm by my
confidence in the Jeffersonian
ideal that the least government is
the best government, and that
every man should have a voice in
it. Should my voice be chosen one
of the representative few, I intend
to raise it in support of
worthwhile, practical projects of
the ASSU that benefit significant
numbers of students, and raise it

even higher against activities that
lack these virtues. Further, I
intend to push for a maintenance
of the current standard of student
life against the usurpations of
administrators who are trying to
reduce the student body to its
lowest common factor:
intellectually, politically and
socially.
(Jeff Rowe is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Reginald Turner
As chairman of the Senate this
past academic year, I have sought
to expose the student body to the
entire functions and activities of
the Senate.
I started the Senate
Communications Report, which
each senator was required to post
in an assigned area and make
himself answerable and available
to this constituency to answer
whatever questions may arise.
I further worked to establish
the two public forums which the
Senate sponsored to better
educate the community about the
emeriti housing situation and the
USE strike.
This is what I've done and if
elected more is yet to come. I
believe that further investigation
is needed into tuition increases,
ID cards, and the possibility of
establishing of a WATS line for all
students to help cut down on long
distance phone call bills.
I am also willing to study
whatever else the students feel
should be done. The Senate is
here to represent, to help and to
improve.
(Reginald Turner is an
undergraduate.)
Jim Feliciano
I am running for the ASSU
Senate with proposals not
promises. Also, I have run once
before, am currently serving on an
ASSU subcommittee, and last

year wrote a paper that has served
as a significant input in the
growing debate about a University
shuttlebus system. You are
probably waiting for some
concrete proposals and I will not
disappoint you:
1) The members of the ASSU
Nominations Committee should
be limited to serving on one
committee.
2) I urge the speedy
implementation of an ASSU
notetaking service.
3) I urge serious study into the
possibility of transforming
Tresidder from a poor cafeteria
into a student center including a
student store.
(Jim Feliciano is an undergraduate
majoring in philosophy.)
Kurt Hunciker
There is little understanding of
what the Senate can and cannot
do: What powers does the ASSU
Senate have? First, it has control
over $75,000 in funds for student
activities and organizations. The
ASSU can also be a focal point for
student activities and
organizations. The ASSU can't
directly increase the amount of
on-campus housing or reform the
curriculum. But, the Senate can
gain significant inroads into the
making of University policy by
hard work and vigorous lobbying.
This implies both passing
resolutions and following them up
by strongly presenting them to
administrators.
The Senate should lobby for
Residential Colleges. A perfect
opportunity exists to
concurrently design the
educational program and the
facilities available for a residential
college in the newly proposed row
houses. Finally, the class note
service and student co-op, both
proposed by the Council of
Presidents, should be

implemented.
(Kurt Hunciker is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics and political science.)
Ira Rubin
I have a sincere desire to help
the University, which has
contributed so much to me
academically, yet proven deficient
in so many other aspects of
college life.
The housing issue is important
to me (as one who has previously
arrived in the fall unassigned and
despairing). I am also concerned
with the future of the overseas
study program and feel I could
benefit the Senate in this respect.
There is one area of concern
which I feel is extremely lacking
at Stanford. With the except of
Fred Hargadon's "personal" letter
of congratuations upon admission
I believe the University is grossly
deficient in communicating with
its students on any but a mass
basis.
(Ira Rubin is an undergraduate
majoring in political science and
communication.)
Tim Coqway
I am running for the ASSU
Senate to express my views and
take an active role in such
problems as the housing shortage
and the lack of cohesive social
activities for the students.
If elected I will:
1) Attend the bi-weekly
meetings of the Senate.
2) Actively seek the opinions
of other students.
3) Consider these opinions and
decide as I see fit.
Vote on Thursday. If you don't
vote, don't gripe!
(Tim Conway is an undergraduate
majoring in chemistry.)
Mark Pigott
I am running for the Senate.
(Mark Pigott is an undergraduate.)
The following are statements by
candidates for ASSU Senate in
Wednesday's and Thursday's
elections. More statements were
published yesterday.
Mary Ann Toman
The housing draw issue is of
major concern, thus I propose to
concentrate on this and other
student services including
implementation of the proposed
Record Co-op. As a member of
the Record Co-op Committee, I
have already gathered information
and have helped to initiate action.
As for the Pub, I was a member of
the Tresidder Union Committee,
so I was able to gain insight into
the operations of the University,
and especially, those problems
holding up the Pub.
Initiative is necessary for both
senators and students. I have
personally contacted Dr.
Mc Clennahan of the Health and
Safety Committee about the
dangerous biking conditions that
exist on parts of the new Campus
Drive close to the Row. I have
proposed two-way asphalt bike
pathways next to he sidewalks.
Immediate action is necessary. I
have taken the first step.
(Mary Ann Toman is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics.)
Jan Pepper
Much work is facing the ASSU
Senate in the area of student
services. An improved Tresidder
food service, a pub, partly
financed by the excess profits of
the Coffee House or Tresidder,
and safer conditions for bicycles
are a few examples.
The Senate also has the
responsibility of appointing
competent and dedicated students
to serve on University committees
in order to assume that the
student view will be an important
factor in administrative decisions.
Plans for future student housing,
particularly, should be approved
by students in terms of placement
on campus and architectural
design.
(Jan Pepper is an undergraduate
majoring in civil engineering.)

M. Scott Smith
As an ASSU senator, I would
advocate a plan creating a student
majority in the student court
system. ASSU-student body
communication would be aided
by regular reporting of ASSU
activity in the Daily and on
KZSU, and by surveys of student
sentiment on current issues. The
current housing crunch should be
eased by construction of low cost,
temporary housing, not by
assimilation of fraternities into
the draw. More thorough advising
and orientation programs are
needed for freshmen and transfer
students — it takes long enough to
figure out what goes on here as it
is.
(M. Scott Smith is an
undergraduate.)
Mike Dorsey
Maybe I'm a hopeless idealist
(as some of my friends suggest),
but I believe in the concept of
people getting together to work
for something they believe in. I
further believe in the concept of
student government: students
working together in many ways
for the benefit of the entire
student body.
Now, why me? As I stated in
my campaign literature, I believe
that I have the necessary
experience and enthusiasm to be
an effective senator. Before
coming to Stanford I served as
Associated Student Body
President for my high school
(please forgive my accidental
ommission of "high school" in
campaign literature) and, last
year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always
agree with the Council-of-
Presidents, I have confidence in
them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I
thoroughly enjoy this kind of
work, I can readily make my one
promise: to attend every meeting.
(Mike Dorsey is an
undergraduate.)
Jody Meisel
My primary concerns, aside

from the obvious need to make
the Senate into a more viable and
better publicized organization,
include the following:
1) Securing on-campus housing
for all undergraduates who desire
it.
2) Making public hearings a
continued part of the University's
decision-making process.
3) Seeking increased financial
aid and better part-time jobs,
including the placement of
undergraduates in jobs related to
their studies.
4) Improving the present
advisor system.
My experience includes
working with educational
administrators and elected
officials of the Los Angeles Board
of Education, both on a city-wide
student committee and later as a
full-time employee.
(Jody Meisal is an undergraduate
majoring in history.)
Pete Truex
As Stanford students, there are
some problems that we should try
to solve together. The current
housing shortage is of utmost
importance to everybody, and the
lack of campus social activities is
another field where there's a lot
of room for improvement. If
elected, I'll do my best to solve
these and other problems that
face us here at Stanford. I'm
willing to work for you.
(Pete Truex is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Beth Wood
This is my first year at
Stanford so I have not served in
any organizations on campus
previously. However, I feel that I
am well qualified for this position
as I was very active student
government during my high
school years and served as
Vice-president of my Student
Council.
As a member of several
minorities on campus — I am a
black freshwoman planning to
major in pre-law and I live in
Burbank. I feel that I would prove
successful in representing a
substancial portion of the

Stanford populace.
I am prepared to work for the
benefit of Stanford students
through the ASSU Senate right
away but first I need your vote on
October 9 and 10.
(Beth Wood is an undergraduate.)
Eleanor Lynds
I believe the Seante can work
for you, but steps should be taken
to make you more aware of what
issues are coming before the
senators. I will work to create
such interaction. I will bring an
open-minded and responsive voice
to our government, without any
commitments or obligations to
any special interest group.
The issues that will come
before the Senate are important —
the housing problem, the related
question of the future of
Fraternities, the inadequate
service provided by our current
Tresidder food service, the Pub,
and as always the selection of the
Nominations committee. The
Senate needs your opinions, and
above all, senators who are
concerned with maximizing
benefits for all students.
Support a dependable
candidate, concerned with being
an equitable voice and responsive
to you.
(Eleanor Lynds is an
undergraduate majoring in art
history.)
Davis, Germaine, Gray,
Silton, Strnad, Sumner
Students must realize that we
are as important a part of the
Stanford community as the
faculty, administration, and staff.
The student body has the right to
have its views become an integral
part of every important decision.
We are running because we believe
that the ASSU can serve as an
effective student advocate, not
just a clearinghouse for ideas.
Alternatives in housing should
always be open to Stanford
students. Fraternities, then,
should be allowed to exist simply
to add to the diversity of the
University (not because dues and
initiation fees have bought them a
privilege). In order to comply
with Title IX, fraternities should
be allowed to be coed when they

so desire. And more importantly,
theme houses .should also become
exempt from I;he draw in order to
maintain continuity and strength
in the theme.
Of course, the real problem is
the on-camptjs housing shortage.
It is imperative that more student
housing be built, and that the
highest housing priority be
student — not emeritus — housing.
We propose to develop in
conjunction with present
committees a student housing
plan (as th e first part of a student
Land Use plan) that will articulate
student priorities to the
administration and defend these
priorities.
The situation for women at
Stanford is improving. We will do
everything possible to further this
progress.
In orc?ier to reach more women,
we will vote to appropriate funds
for a newsletter on all women's
activities;, and aid all valuable
projects by sisters at Stanford. WE
approve of the appointment of
the Assistnat Dean for Women
and will maintain this important
liaison.. We support the
Organization of Stanford Women
Athletes in its work to gain
equal ity.
The Course Review is the
beginning of real student course
evaluation, but it needs funding to
cove r more courses and to insure a
return of all student opinions.
Wit'fi a respected, comprehensive
Course Review, we can provide a
basis for eventual student input
into tenure decisions. We support
the proposals that the Economics
Department should offer a full
spf.-ctrum of academically
respected thought, and feel that
all academic departments should
b<a more receptive to student
desires for new courses.
(Cynthia Davis, Charlotte
Germane, Chris Gray, Debbi
Hilton, Lyse Strnad, and Mike
Sumner are all undergraduates.)
Janeway, Max
We will work to provide
government responsive to the
attitudes and needs of the
Stanford Student Body.

Krohn, Sobotka
In talking with many of our
friends before deciding to run for
seats in the ASSU Senate, we
began to realize that perhaps our
finest qualification for office lay
in our lack of commitment to the
established ASSU hierarchy. We
have noted consistently the
growing pre-occupation of the
ASSU with its organizational
structure, leading to extended
discussion of ornamental issues.
We have similarly noted the
disappearance of the ASSU Senate
as an open forum for the candid
airing of real questions facing the
Stanford community.
We have witnessed the
unfortunate lack of student input
in major University decisions.
Notable shortcomings have
included: student housing
(student placement,
determination of independent
status, Resident Fellow and RA
selection), food service (Why is
there a 40 percent overhead?),
academic direction and the
granting of professorial tenure,
and the administration's
misguided priorities. The list of
very real issues yet to be acted
upon will continue to grow as
long as the Senate closes its mind
and ears. We will listen, and we
will act.

majoring in mathematics and
philosophy. Paul Sobotka is an

Ruben Sanchez
An understanding of the
responsibilities of a student
senator begins with the
recognition that he, or she, is

there to represent. And before
this objective can be reached, a
much more prominant one must
be secured. One of understanding
Stanford University's bureaucratic
scheme. In essence, learning the
sytem, in order to work within it.
Any change, great or small,
necessitates time. As a freshman,
knowledge of such undergoings
will be profitable not only for the
present, but in future encounters,
as well.
(Ruben Sanchez is an
undergraduate.)
Bill Cortes
ASSU Senate campaigns are
typically cluttered with vague
generalizations and hollow
promises as candidates attempt to
capitalize on false issues while
sliding sideways in the face of
really controversial matters. What
is needed is a concrete approach
to problems that directly affect
students and a genuine desire to
effect productive change.
The current housing shortage,
the impending demise of the
fraternity system, the autocratic
policies regarding theme houses,
and the inadequacies of the
residence staffs as perpetrated by
the closed selection and lack of
periodic evaluation of resident
fellows and resident assistants all
point to a need for reform in the
residential education system.
Student input is also needed if
Tresidder is to resume an
improved role in serving
off-campus students and if
student services are to be
increased for transfers.
Real action can be expected
from the Senate only if candidates
with solid programs are elected.
Students should utilize one of the
few direct inputs available to
them and see that this is done.
(Bill Cortes is an undergraduate

majoring in political science.)
Brad Levin
We must study and re-evaluate
the method of administering
examinations at Stanford and the
University grading system, for I
believe that they both contain
some basic faults and
inconsistencies. I will seek the
establishment of an ASSU
committee to study the problems,
to evaluate the system, and to
come up with some workable
solutions.
I've also made a big promise to
all freshmen; not only do I intend
to keep that promise, but now I
extend it to the transfer students.
I believe that there are certain
needs and desires which are
peculiar to freshmen and transfers
and which, up until now, have
gone unrepresented. These
students need greater access
to information and a clearer

as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty

willing to work for you.

Beth Wood
This is my first year at

previously. However, I feel that I
am well qualified for this position

Stanford populace.
I am prepared to work for the
benefit of Stanford students
through the ASSU Senate right
away but first I need your vote on
October 9 and 10.
(Beth Wood is an undergraduate.)
Eleanor Lynds
I believe the Seante can work
for you, but steps should be taken
to make you more aware of what
issues are coming before the
senators. I will work to create
such interaction. I will bring an
open-minded and responsive voice
to our government, without any
commitments or obligations to
any special interest group.
The issues that will come
before the Senate are important —
the housing problem, the related
question of the future of
Fraternities, the inadequate
service provided by our current
Tresidder food service, the Pub,
and as always the selection of the
Nominations committee. The
Senate needs your opinions, and
above all, senators who are
concerned with maximizing
benefits for all students.
Support a dependable
candidate, concerned with being
an equitable voice and responsive
to you.

undergraduate majoring in art

Davis, Germaine, Gray,
Silton, Strnad, Sumner
Students must realize that we
are as important a part of the
Stanford community as the
faculty, administration, and staff.
The student body has the right to
have its views become an integral
part of every important decision.
We are running because we believe
that the ASSU can serve as an
effective student advocate, not
just a clearinghouse for ideas.
Alternatives in housing should
always be open to Stanford
students. Fraternities, then,
should be allowed to exist simply
to add to the diversity of the
University (not because dues and
initiation fees have bought them a
privilege). In order to comply
with Title IX, fraternities should
be allowed to be coed when they

so desire. And more importantly,
theme houses .should also become
exempt from I;he draw in order to
maintain continuity and strength
in the theme.
Of course, the real problem is
the on-camptjs housing shortage.
It is imperative that more student
housing be built, and that the
highest housing priority be
student — not emeritus — housing.
We propose to develop in
conjunction with present
committees a student housing
plan (as th e first part of a student
Land Use plan) that will articulate
student priorities to the
administration and defend these
priorities.
The situation for women at
Stanford is improving. We will do
everything possible to further this
progress.
In orc?ier to reach more women,
we will vote to appropriate funds
for a newsletter on all women's
activities;, and aid all valuable
projects by sisters at Stanford. WE
approve of the appointment of
the Assistnat Dean for Women
and will maintain this important
liaison.. We support the
Organization of Stanford Women
Athletes in its work to gain
equal ity.
The Course Review is the
beginning of real student course
evaluation, but it needs funding to
cove r more courses and to insure a
return of all student opinions.
Wit'fi a respected, comprehensive
Course Review, we can provide a
basis for eventual student input
into tenure decisions. We support
the proposals that the Economics
Department should offer a full
spf.-ctrum of academically
respected thought, and feel that
all academic departments should
b<a more receptive to student
desires for new courses.

Krohn, Sobotka
In talking with many of our
friends before deciding to run for
seats in the ASSU Senate, we
began to realize that perhaps our
finest qualification for office lay
in our lack of commitment to the
established ASSU hierarchy. We
have noted consistently the
growing pre-occupation of the
ASSU with its organizational
structure, leading to extended
discussion of ornamental issues.
We have similarly noted the
disappearance of the ASSU Senate
as an open forum for the candid
airing of real questions facing the
Stanford community.
We have witnessed the
unfortunate lack of student input
in major University decisions.
Notable shortcomings have
included: student housing
(student placement,
determination of independent
status, Resident Fellow and RA
selection), food service (Why is
there a 40 percent overhead?),
academic direction and the
granting of professorial tenure,
and the administration's
misguided priorities. The list of
very real issues yet to be acted
upon will continue to grow as
long as the Senate closes its mind
and ears. We will listen, and we
will act.

majoring in mathematics and

Ruben Sanchez
An understanding of the
responsibilities of a student
senator begins with the
recognition that he, or she, is

there to represent. And before
this objective can be reached, a
much more prominant one must
be secured. One of understanding
Stanford University's bureaucratic
scheme. In essence, learning the
sytem, in order to work within it.
Any change, great or small,
necessitates time. As a freshman,
knowledge of such undergoings
will be profitable not only for the
present, but in future encounters,
as well.
(Ruben Sanchez is an
undergraduate.)
Bill Cortes
ASSU Senate campaigns are
typically cluttered with vague
generalizations and hollow
promises as candidates attempt to
capitalize on false issues while
sliding sideways in the face of
really controversial matters. What
is needed is a concrete approach
to problems that directly affect
students and a genuine desire to
effect productive change.
The current housing shortage,
the impending demise of the
fraternity system, the autocratic
policies regarding theme houses,
and the inadequacies of the
residence staffs as perpetrated by
the closed selection and lack of
periodic evaluation of resident
fellows and resident assistants all
point to a need for reform in the
residential education system.
Student input is also needed if
Tresidder is to resume an
improved role in serving
off-campus students and if
student services are to be
increased for transfers.
Real action can be expected
from the Senate only if candidates
with solid programs are elected.
Students should utilize one of the
few direct inputs available to
them and see that this is done.
(Bill Cortes is an undergraduate

majoring in political science.)
Brad Levin
We must study and re-evaluate
the method of administering
examinations at Stanford and the
University grading system, for I
believe that they both contain
some basic faults and
inconsistencies. I will seek the
establishment of an ASSU
committee to study the problems,
to evaluate the system, and to
come up with some workable
solutions.
I've also made a big promise to
all freshmen; not only do I intend
to keep that promise, but now I
extend it to the transfer students.
I believe that there are certain
needs and desires which are
peculiar to freshmen and transfers
and which, up until now, have
gone unrepresented. These
students need greater access
to information and a clearer
explanation of student activities
and programs, so their transition
into the new Stanford
environment will be easier. These
students need a voice, and they
must have greater representation
in all phases of student
government. Finally, these
students need more attention and
honest advice, by providing higher
housing priorities for transfers, by
involving these students in
innovative studies or programs,
and by assisting them in making
important course and career
decisions.
(Brad Levin is an undergraduate.)
Weld, Bergerac
As a result of the system by
which ASSU senators are elected,
freshmen are inadvertently
deprived of fair representation.
Despite the fact that over
one-quarter of the undergraduates
are freshmen, there were no
freshmen senators last year. The
reason for this is quite clear: The

elections are held now, freshmen
learn about the Senate later.
While we realize that
orientation takes time, in a few
weeks freshmen will be as aware
of their goals and expectations as
anyone at Stanford Yet without a
change, they will continue to go
without representation in the
ASSU senate. To alleviate this
problem we have gone out of our
way to familiarize ourselves with
the responsibilities of a senator.
We have talked to senators,
current presidents, and most
importantly to the students around
us. Having recognized what we
feel is an injustice, we have
decided to run for senatorial
positions on the platform of equal
representation.
The process of specialization,
by nature, is one that over the
years draws the individual away
from the University as a whole. As
freshmen, we have more time and
optimistic enthusiasm which we
want to apply to more than just
academic life.
(Kit Weld and Randy Bergerac are
undergraduates.)
Jeff Rowe
A University should maintain
an atmosphere of open, honest,
unprejudiced intellectual inquiry
and be at the same time dedicated
to the proposition that life is to
be enjoyed by every individual
with his own special flair.
These principles are translated
into the political realm by my
confidence in the Jeffersonian
ideal that the least government is
the best government, and that
every man should have a voice in
it. Should my voice be chosen one
of the representative few, I intend
to raise it in support of
worthwhile, practical projects of
the ASSU that benefit significant
numbers of students, and raise it

even higher against activities that
lack these virtues. Further, I
intend to push for a maintenance
of the current standard of student
life against the usurpations of
administrators who are trying to
reduce the student body to its
lowest common factor:
intellectually, politically and
socially.
(Jeff Rowe is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Reginald Turner
As chairman of the Senate this
past academic year, I have sought
to expose the student body to the
entire functions and activities of
the Senate.
I started the Senate
Communications Report, which
each senator was required to post
in an assigned area and make
himself answerable and available
to this constituency to answer
whatever questions may arise.
I further worked to establish
the two public forums which the
Senate sponsored to better
educate the community about the
emeriti housing situation and the
USE strike.
This is what I've done and if
elected more is yet to come. I
believe that further investigation
is needed into tuition increases,
ID cards, and the possibility of
establishing of a WATS line for all
students to help cut down on long
distance phone call bills.
I am also willing to study
whatever else the students feel
should be done. The Senate is
here to represent, to help and to
improve.
(Reginald Turner is an
undergraduate.)
Jim Feliciano
I am running for the ASSU
Senate with proposals not
promises. Also, I have run once
before, am currently serving on an
ASSU subcommittee, and last

year wrote a paper that has served
as a significant input in the
growing debate about a University
shuttlebus system. You are
probably waiting for some
concrete proposals and I will not
disappoint you:
1) The members of the ASSU
Nominations Committee should
be limited to serving on one
committee.
2) I urge the speedy
implementation of an ASSU
notetaking service.
3) I urge serious study into the
possibility of transforming
Tresidder from a poor cafeteria
into a student center including a
student store.
(Jim Feliciano is an undergraduate
majoring in philosophy.)
Kurt Hunciker
There is little understanding of
what the Senate can and cannot
do: What powers does the ASSU
Senate have? First, it has control
over $75,000 in funds for student
activities and organizations. The
ASSU can also be a focal point for
student activities and
organizations. The ASSU can't
directly increase the amount of
on-campus housing or reform the
curriculum. But, the Senate can
gain significant inroads into the
making of University policy by
hard work and vigorous lobbying.
This implies both passing
resolutions and following them up
by strongly presenting them to
administrators.
The Senate should lobby for
Residential Colleges. A perfect
opportunity exists to
concurrently design the
educational program and the
facilities available for a residential
college in the newly proposed row
houses. Finally, the class note
service and student co-op, both
proposed by the Council of
Presidents, should be

implemented.
(Kurt Hunciker is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics and political science.)
Ira Rubin
I have a sincere desire to help
the University, which has
contributed so much to me
academically, yet proven deficient
in so many other aspects of
college life.
The housing issue is important
to me (as one who has previously
arrived in the fall unassigned and
despairing). I am also concerned
with the future of the overseas
study program and feel I could
benefit the Senate in this respect.
There is one area of concern
which I feel is extremely lacking
at Stanford. With the except of
Fred Hargadon's "personal" letter
of congratuations upon admission
I believe the University is grossly
deficient in communicating with
its students on any but a mass
basis.
(Ira Rubin is an undergraduate
majoring in political science and
communication.)
Tim Coqway
I am running for the ASSU
Senate to express my views and
take an active role in such
problems as the housing shortage
and the lack of cohesive social
activities for the students.
If elected I will:
1) Attend the bi-weekly
meetings of the Senate.
2) Actively seek the opinions
of other students.
3) Consider these opinions and
decide as I see fit.
Vote on Thursday. If you don't
vote, don't gripe!
(Tim Conway is an undergraduate
majoring in chemistry.)
Mark Pigott
I am running for the Senate.
(Mark Pigott is an undergraduate.)
The following are statements by
candidates for ASSU Senate in
Wednesday's and Thursday's
elections. More statements were
published yesterday.
Mary Ann Toman
The housing draw issue is of
major concern, thus I propose to
concentrate on this and other
student services including
implementation of the proposed
Record Co-op. As a member of
the Record Co-op Committee, I
have already gathered information
and have helped to initiate action.
As for the Pub, I was a member of
the Tresidder Union Committee,
so I was able to gain insight into
the operations of the University,
and especially, those problems
holding up the Pub.
Initiative is necessary for both
senators and students. I have
personally contacted Dr.
Mc Clennahan of the Health and
Safety Committee about the
dangerous biking conditions that
exist on parts of the new Campus
Drive close to the Row. I have
proposed two-way asphalt bike
pathways next to he sidewalks.
Immediate action is necessary. I
have taken the first step.
(Mary Ann Toman is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics.)
Jan Pepper
Much work is facing the ASSU
Senate in the area of student
services. An improved Tresidder
food service, a pub, partly
financed by the excess profits of
the Coffee House or Tresidder,
and safer conditions for bicycles
are a few examples.
The Senate also has the
responsibility of appointing
competent and dedicated students
to serve on University committees
in order to assume that the
student view will be an important
factor in administrative decisions.
Plans for future student housing,
particularly, should be approved
by students in terms of placement
on campus and architectural
design.
(Jan Pepper is an undergraduate
majoring in civil engineering.)

M. Scott Smith
As an ASSU senator, I would
advocate a plan creating a student
majority in the student court
system. ASSU-student body
communication would be aided
by regular reporting of ASSU
activity in the Daily and on
KZSU, and by surveys of student
sentiment on current issues. The
current housing crunch should be
eased by construction of low cost,
temporary housing, not by
assimilation of fraternities into
the draw. More thorough advising
and orientation programs are
needed for freshmen and transfer
students — it takes long enough to
figure out what goes on here as it
is.
(M. Scott Smith is an
undergraduate.)
Mike Dorsey
Maybe I'm a hopeless idealist
(as some of my friends suggest),
but I believe in the concept of
people getting together to work
for something they believe in. I
further believe in the concept of
student government: students
working together in many ways
for the benefit of the entire
student body.
Now, why me? As I stated in
my campaign literature, I believe
that I have the necessary
experience and enthusiasm to be
an effective senator. Before
coming to Stanford I served as
Associated Student Body
President for my high school
(please forgive my accidental
ommission of "high school" in
campaign literature) and, last
year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always
agree with the Council-of-
Presidents, I have confidence in
them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I
thoroughly enjoy this kind of
work, I can readily make my one
promise: to attend every meeting.
(Mike Dorsey is an
undergraduate.)
Jody Meisel
My primary concerns, aside

from the obvious need to make
the Senate into a more viable and
better publicized organization,
include the following:
1) Securing on-campus housing
for all undergraduates who desire
it.
2) Making public hearings a
continued part of the University's
decision-making process.
3) Seeking increased financial
aid and better part-time jobs,
including the placement of
undergraduates in jobs related to
their studies.
4) Improving the present
advisor system.
My experience includes
working with educational
administrators and elected
officials of the Los Angeles Board
of Education, both on a city-wide
student committee and later as a
full-time employee.
(Jody Meisal is an undergraduate
majoring in history.)
Pete Truex
As Stanford students, there are
some problems that we should try
to solve together. The current
housing shortage is of utmost
importance to everybody, and the
lack of campus social activities is
another field where there's a lot
of room for improvement. If
elected, I'll do my best to solve
these and other problems that
face us here at Stanford. I'm
willing to work for you.
(Pete Truex is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Beth Wood
This is my first year at
Stanford so I have not served in
any organizations on campus
previously. However, I feel that I
am well qualified for this position
as I was very active student
government during my high
school years and served as
Vice-president of my Student
Council.
As a member of several
minorities on campus — I am a
black freshwoman planning to
major in pre-law and I live in
Burbank. I feel that I would prove
successful in representing a
substancial portion of the

Stanford populace.
I am prepared to work for the
benefit of Stanford students
through the ASSU Senate right
away but first I need your vote on
October 9 and 10.

open-minded and responsive voice

commitments or obligations to
any special interest group.
The issues that will come
before the Senate are important —
the housing problem, the related
question of the future of
Fraternities, the inadequate
service provided by our current
Tresidder food service, the Pub,
and as always the selection of the
Nominations committee. The
Senate needs your opinions, and
above all, senators who are
concerned with maximizing
benefits for all students.
Support a dependable

an equitable voice and responsive
to you.

Residential Colleges. A perfect
opportunity exists to
concurrently design the
educational program and the
facilities available for a residential
college in the newly proposed row
houses. Finally, the class note
service and student co-op, both
proposed by the Council of
Presidents, should be

implemented.
(Kurt Hunciker is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics and political science.)
Ira Rubin
I have a sincere desire to help
the University, which has
contributed so much to me
academically, yet proven deficient
in so many other aspects of
college life.
The housing issue is important
to me (as one who has previously
arrived in the fall unassigned and
despairing). I am also concerned
with the future of the overseas
study program and feel I could
benefit the Senate in this respect.
There is one area of concern
which I feel is extremely lacking
at Stanford. With the except of
Fred Hargadon's "personal" letter
of congratuations upon admission
I believe the University is grossly
deficient in communicating with
its students on any but a mass
basis.
(Ira Rubin is an undergraduate
majoring in political science and
communication.)
Tim Coqway
I am running for the ASSU
Senate to express my views and
take an active role in such
problems as the housing shortage
and the lack of cohesive social
activities for the students.
If elected I will:
1) Attend the bi-weekly
meetings of the Senate.
2) Actively seek the opinions
of other students.
3) Consider these opinions and
decide as I see fit.
Vote on Thursday. If you don't
vote, don't gripe!
(Tim Conway is an undergraduate
majoring in chemistry.)
Mark Pigott
I am running for the Senate.
(Mark Pigott is an undergraduate.)
The following are statements by
candidates for ASSU Senate in
Wednesday's and Thursday's
elections. More statements were
published yesterday.
Mary Ann Toman
The housing draw issue is of
major concern, thus I propose to
concentrate on this and other
student services including
implementation of the proposed
Record Co-op. As a member of
the Record Co-op Committee, I
have already gathered information
and have helped to initiate action.
As for the Pub, I was a member of
the Tresidder Union Committee,
so I was able to gain insight into
the operations of the University,
and especially, those problems
holding up the Pub.
Initiative is necessary for both
senators and students. I have
personally contacted Dr.
Mc Clennahan of the Health and
Safety Committee about the
dangerous biking conditions that
exist on parts of the new Campus
Drive close to the Row. I have
proposed two-way asphalt bike
pathways next to he sidewalks.
Immediate action is necessary. I
have taken the first step.
(Mary Ann Toman is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics.)
Jan Pepper
Much work is facing the ASSU
Senate in the area of student
services. An improved Tresidder
food service, a pub, partly
financed by the excess profits of
the Coffee House or Tresidder,
and safer conditions for bicycles
are a few examples.
The Senate also has the
responsibility of appointing
competent and dedicated students
to serve on University committees
in order to assume that the
student view will be an important
factor in administrative decisions.
Plans for future student housing,
particularly, should be approved
by students in terms of placement
on campus and architectural
design.
(Jan Pepper is an undergraduate
majoring in civil engineering.)

M. Scott Smith
As an ASSU senator, I would
advocate a plan creating a student
majority in the student court
system. ASSU-student body
communication would be aided
by regular reporting of ASSU
activity in the Daily and on
KZSU, and by surveys of student
sentiment on current issues. The
current housing crunch should be
eased by construction of low cost,
temporary housing, not by
assimilation of fraternities into
the draw. More thorough advising
and orientation programs are
needed for freshmen and transfer
students — it takes long enough to
figure out what goes on here as it
is.
(M. Scott Smith is an
undergraduate.)
Mike Dorsey
Maybe I'm a hopeless idealist
(as some of my friends suggest),
but I believe in the concept of
people getting together to work
for something they believe in. I
further believe in the concept of
student government: students
working together in many ways
for the benefit of the entire
student body.
Now, why me? As I stated in
my campaign literature, I believe
that I have the necessary
experience and enthusiasm to be
an effective senator. Before
coming to Stanford I served as
Associated Student Body
President for my high school
(please forgive my accidental
ommission of "high school" in
campaign literature) and, last
year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always
agree with the Council-of-
Presidents, I have confidence in
them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I
thoroughly enjoy this kind of
work, I can readily make my one
promise: to attend every meeting.
(Mike Dorsey is an
undergraduate.)
Jody Meisel
My primary concerns, aside

from the obvious need to make
the Senate into a more viable and
better publicized organization,
include the following:
1) Securing on-campus housing
for all undergraduates who desire
it.
2) Making public hearings a
continued part of the University's
decision-making process.
3) Seeking increased financial
aid and better part-time jobs,
including the placement of
undergraduates in jobs related to
their studies.
4) Improving the present
advisor system.
My experience includes
working with educational
administrators and elected
officials of the Los Angeles Board
of Education, both on a city-wide
student committee and later as a
full-time employee.
(Jody Meisal is an undergraduate
majoring in history.)
Pete Truex
As Stanford students, there are
some problems that we should try
to solve together. The current
housing shortage is of utmost
importance to everybody, and the
lack of campus social activities is
another field where there's a lot
of room for improvement. If
elected, I'll do my best to solve
these and other problems that
face us here at Stanford. I'm
willing to work for you.
(Pete Truex is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Beth Wood
This is my first year at
Stanford so I have not served in
any organizations on campus
previously. However, I feel that I
am well qualified for this position
as I was very active student
government during my high
school years and served as
Vice-president of my Student
Council.
As a member of several
minorities on campus — I am a
black freshwoman planning to
major in pre-law and I live in
Burbank. I feel that I would prove
successful in representing a
substancial portion of the

Stanford populace.
I am prepared to work for the
benefit of Stanford students
through the ASSU Senate right
away but first I need your vote on
October 9 and 10.
(Beth Wood is an undergraduate.)
Eleanor Lynds
I believe the Seante can work
for you, but steps should be taken
to make you more aware of what
issues are coming before the
senators. I will work to create
such interaction. I will bring an
open-minded and responsive voice
to our government, without any
commitments or obligations to
any special interest group.
The issues that will come
before the Senate are important —
the housing problem, the related
question of the future of
Fraternities, the inadequate
service provided by our current
Tresidder food service, the Pub,
and as always the selection of the
Nominations committee. The
Senate needs your opinions, and
above all, senators who are
concerned with maximizing
benefits for all students.
Support a dependable
candidate, concerned with being
an equitable voice and responsive
to you.
(Eleanor Lynds is an
undergraduate majoring in art
history.)
Davis, Germaine, Gray,
Silton, Strnad, Sumner
Students must realize that we
are as important a part of the
Stanford community as the
faculty, administration, and staff.
The student body has the right to
have its views become an integral
part of every important decision.
We are running because we believe
that the ASSU can serve as an
effective student advocate, not
just a clearinghouse for ideas.
Alternatives in housing should
always be open to Stanford
students. Fraternities, then,
should be allowed to exist simply
to add to the diversity of the
University (not because dues and
initiation fees have bought them a
privilege). In order to comply
with Title IX, fraternities should
be allowed to be coed when they

so desire. And more importantly,
theme houses .should also become
exempt from I;he draw in order to
maintain continuity and strength
in the theme.
Of course, the real problem is
the on-camptjs housing shortage.
It is imperative that more student
housing be built, and that the
highest housing priority be
student — not emeritus — housing.
We propose to develop in
conjunction with present
committees a student housing
plan (as th e first part of a student
Land Use plan) that will articulate
student priorities to the
administration and defend these
priorities.
The situation for women at
Stanford is improving. We will do
everything possible to further this
progress.
In orc?ier to reach more women,
we will vote to appropriate funds
for a newsletter on all women's
activities;, and aid all valuable
projects by sisters at Stanford. WE
approve of the appointment of
the Assistnat Dean for Women
and will maintain this important
liaison.. We support the
Organization of Stanford Women
Athletes in its work to gain
equal ity.
The Course Review is the
beginning of real student course
evaluation, but it needs funding to
cove r more courses and to insure a
return of all student opinions.
Wit'fi a respected, comprehensive
Course Review, we can provide a
basis for eventual student input
into tenure decisions. We support
the proposals that the Economics
Department should offer a full
spf.-ctrum of academically
respected thought, and feel that
all academic departments should
b<a more receptive to student
desires for new courses.
(Cynthia Davis, Charlotte
Germane, Chris Gray, Debbi
Hilton, Lyse Strnad, and Mike
Sumner are all undergraduates.)
Janeway, Max
We will work to provide
government responsive to the
attitudes and needs of the
Stanford Student Body.
(Kate Janeway is an
undergraduate majoring in
humanities. Wendy Max is an
undergraduate majoring in

Krohn, Sobotka
In talking with many of our
friends before deciding to run for
seats in the ASSU Senate, we
began to realize that perhaps our
finest qualification for office lay
in our lack of commitment to the
established ASSU hierarchy. We
have noted consistently the
growing pre-occupation of the
ASSU with its organizational
structure, leading to extended
discussion of ornamental issues.
We have similarly noted the
disappearance of the ASSU Senate
as an open forum for the candid
airing of real questions facing the
Stanford community.
We have witnessed the
unfortunate lack of student input
in major University decisions.
Notable shortcomings have
included: student housing
(student placement,
determination of independent
status, Resident Fellow and RA
selection), food service (Why is
there a 40 percent overhead?),
academic direction and the
granting of professorial tenure,
and the administration's
misguided priorities. The list of
very real issues yet to be acted
upon will continue to grow as
long as the Senate closes its mind
and ears. We will listen, and we
will act.
(Doug Krohn is an undergraduate
majoring in mathematics and
philosophy. Paul Sobotka is an
undergraduate majoring in
chemistry.)
Ruben Sanchez
An understanding of the
responsibilities of a student
senator begins with the
recognition that he, or she, is

there to represent. And before
this objective can be reached, a
much more prominant one must
be secured. One of understanding
Stanford University's bureaucratic
scheme. In essence, learning the
sytem, in order to work within it.
Any change, great or small,
necessitates time. As a freshman,
knowledge of such undergoings
will be profitable not only for the
present, but in future encounters,
as well.
(Ruben Sanchez is an
undergraduate.)
Bill Cortes
ASSU Senate campaigns are
typically cluttered with vague
generalizations and hollow
promises as candidates attempt to
capitalize on false issues while
sliding sideways in the face of
really controversial matters. What
is needed is a concrete approach
to problems that directly affect
students and a genuine desire to
effect productive change.
The current housing shortage,
the impending demise of the
fraternity system, the autocratic
policies regarding theme houses,
and the inadequacies of the
residence staffs as perpetrated by
the closed selection and lack of
periodic evaluation of resident
fellows and resident assistants all
point to a need for reform in the
residential education system.
Student input is also needed if
Tresidder is to resume an
improved role in serving
off-campus students and if
student services are to be
increased for transfers.
Real action can be expected
from the Senate only if candidates
with solid programs are elected.
Students should utilize one of the
few direct inputs available to
them and see that this is done.
(Bill Cortes is an undergraduate

majoring in political science.)
Brad Levin
We must study and re-evaluate
the method of administering
examinations at Stanford and the
University grading system, for I
believe that they both contain
some basic faults and
inconsistencies. I will seek the
establishment of an ASSU
committee to study the problems,
to evaluate the system, and to
come up with some workable
solutions.
I've also made a big promise to
all freshmen; not only do I intend
to keep that promise, but now I
extend it to the transfer students.
I believe that there are certain
needs and desires which are
peculiar to freshmen and transfers
and which, up until now, have
gone unrepresented. These
students need greater access
to information and a clearer
explanation of student activities
and programs, so their transition
into the new Stanford
environment will be easier. These
students need a voice, and they
must have greater representation
in all phases of student
government. Finally, these
students need more attention and
honest advice, by providing higher
housing priorities for transfers, by
involving these students in
innovative studies or programs,
and by assisting them in making
important course and career
decisions.
(Brad Levin is an undergraduate.)
Weld, Bergerac
As a result of the system by
which ASSU senators are elected,
freshmen are inadvertently
deprived of fair representation.
Despite the fact that over
one-quarter of the undergraduates
are freshmen, there were no
freshmen senators last year. The
reason for this is quite clear: The

elections are held now, freshmen
learn about the Senate later.
While we realize that
orientation takes time, in a few
weeks freshmen will be as aware
of their goals and expectations as
anyone at Stanford Yet without a
change, they will continue to go
without representation in the
ASSU senate. To alleviate this
problem we have gone out of our
way to familiarize ourselves with
the responsibilities of a senator.
We have talked to senators,
current presidents, and most
importantly to the students around
us. Having recognized what we
feel is an injustice, we have
decided to run for senatorial
positions on the platform of equal
representation.
The process of specialization,
by nature, is one that over the
years draws the individual away
from the University as a whole. As
freshmen, we have more time and
optimistic enthusiasm which we
want to apply to more than just
academic life.
(Kit Weld and Randy Bergerac are
undergraduates.)
Jeff Rowe
A University should maintain
an atmosphere of open, honest,
unprejudiced intellectual inquiry
and be at the same time dedicated
to the proposition that life is to
be enjoyed by every individual
with his own special flair.
These principles are translated
into the political realm by my
confidence in the Jeffersonian
ideal that the least government is
the best government, and that
every man should have a voice in
it. Should my voice be chosen one
of the representative few, I intend
to raise it in support of
worthwhile, practical projects of
the ASSU that benefit significant
numbers of students, and raise it

even higher against activities that
lack these virtues. Further, I
intend to push for a maintenance
of the current standard of student
life against the usurpations of
administrators who are trying to
reduce the student body to its
lowest common factor:
intellectually, politically and
socially.
(Jeff Rowe is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Reginald Turner
As chairman of the Senate this
past academic year, I have sought
to expose the student body to the
entire functions and activities of
the Senate.
I started the Senate
Communications Report, which
each senator was required to post
in an assigned area and make
himself answerable and available
to this constituency to answer
whatever questions may arise.
I further worked to establish
the two public forums which the
Senate sponsored to better
educate the community about the
emeriti housing situation and the
USE strike.
This is what I've done and if
elected more is yet to come. I
believe that further investigation
is needed into tuition increases,
ID cards, and the possibility of
establishing of a WATS line for all
students to help cut down on long
distance phone call bills.
I am also willing to study
whatever else the students feel
should be done. The Senate is
here to represent, to help and to
improve.
(Reginald Turner is an
undergraduate.)
Jim Feliciano
I am running for the ASSU
Senate with proposals not
promises. Also, I have run once
before, am currently serving on an
ASSU subcommittee, and last

year wrote a paper that has served
as a significant input in the
growing debate about a University
shuttlebus system. You are
probably waiting for some
concrete proposals and I will not
disappoint you:
1) The members of the ASSU
Nominations Committee should
be limited to serving on one
committee.
2) I urge the speedy
implementation of an ASSU
notetaking service.
3) I urge serious study into the
possibility of transforming
Tresidder from a poor cafeteria
into a student center including a
student store.
(Jim Feliciano is an undergraduate
majoring in philosophy.)
Kurt Hunciker
There is little understanding of
what the Senate can and cannot
do: What powers does the ASSU
Senate have? First, it has control
over $75,000 in funds for student
activities and organizations. The
ASSU can also be a focal point for
student activities and
organizations. The ASSU can't
directly increase the amount of
on-campus housing or reform the
curriculum. But, the Senate can
gain significant inroads into the
making of University policy by
hard work and vigorous lobbying.
This implies both passing
resolutions and following them up
by strongly presenting them to
administrators.
The Senate should lobby for
Residential Colleges. A perfect
opportunity exists to
concurrently design the
educational program and the
facilities available for a residential
college in the newly proposed row
houses. Finally, the class note
service and student co-op, both
proposed by the Council of
Presidents, should be

implemented.
(Kurt Hunciker is an

Mary Ann Toman
The housing draw issue is of
major concern, thus I propose to

Much work is facing the ASSU
Senate in the area of student
services. An improved Tresidder

and safer conditions for bicycles
are a few examples.
The Senate also has the
responsibility of appointing
competent and dedicated students
to serve on University committees
in order to assume that the
student view will be an important

(please forgive my accidental

year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always
agree with the Council-of-
Presidents, I have confidence in
them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I
thoroughly enjoy this kind of
work, I can readily make my one
promise: to attend every meeting.

willing to work for you.

Beth Wood
This is my first year at
Stanford so I have not served in
any organizations on campus
previously. However, I feel that I
am well qualified for this position

sytem, in order to work within it.
Any change, great or small,
necessitates time. As a freshman,
knowledge of such undergoings
will be profitable not only for the
present, but in future encounters,
as well.
(Ruben Sanchez is an
undergraduate.)
Bill Cortes
ASSU Senate campaigns are
typically cluttered with vague
generalizations and hollow
promises as candidates attempt to
capitalize on false issues while
sliding sideways in the face of
really controversial matters. What
is needed is a concrete approach
to problems that directly affect
students and a genuine desire to
effect productive change.
The current housing shortage,
the impending demise of the
fraternity system, the autocratic
policies regarding theme houses,
and the inadequacies of the
residence staffs as perpetrated by
the closed selection and lack of
periodic evaluation of resident
fellows and resident assistants all
point to a need for reform in the
residential education system.
Student input is also needed if
Tresidder is to resume an
improved role in serving
off-campus students and if
student services are to be
increased for transfers.
Real action can be expected
from the Senate only if candidates
with solid programs are elected.
Students should utilize one of the
few direct inputs available to
them and see that this is done.
(Bill Cortes is an undergraduate

majoring in political science.)
Brad Levin
We must study and re-evaluate
the method of administering
examinations at Stanford and the
University grading system, for I
believe that they both contain
some basic faults and
inconsistencies. I will seek the
establishment of an ASSU
committee to study the problems,
to evaluate the system, and to
come up with some workable
solutions.
I've also made a big promise to
all freshmen; not only do I intend
to keep that promise, but now I
extend it to the transfer students.
I believe that there are certain
needs and desires which are
peculiar to freshmen and transfers
and which, up until now, have
gone unrepresented. These
students need greater access
to information and a clearer
explanation of student activities
and programs, so their transition
into the new Stanford
environment will be easier. These
students need a voice, and they
must have greater representation
in all phases of student
government. Finally, these
students need more attention and
honest advice, by providing higher
housing priorities for transfers, by
involving these students in
innovative studies or programs,
and by assisting them in making
important course and career
decisions.
(Brad Levin is an undergraduate.)
Weld, Bergerac
As a result of the system by
which ASSU senators are elected,
freshmen are inadvertently
deprived of fair representation.
Despite the fact that over
one-quarter of the undergraduates
are freshmen, there were no
freshmen senators last year. The
reason for this is quite clear: The

elections are held now, freshmen
learn about the Senate later.
While we realize that
orientation takes time, in a few
weeks freshmen will be as aware
of their goals and expectations as
anyone at Stanford Yet without a
change, they will continue to go
without representation in the
ASSU senate. To alleviate this
problem we have gone out of our
way to familiarize ourselves with
the responsibilities of a senator.
We have talked to senators,
current presidents, and most
importantly to the students around
us. Having recognized what we
feel is an injustice, we have
decided to run for senatorial
positions on the platform of equal
representation.
The process of specialization,
by nature, is one that over the
years draws the individual away
from the University as a whole. As
freshmen, we have more time and
optimistic enthusiasm which we
want to apply to more than just
academic life.
(Kit Weld and Randy Bergerac are
undergraduates.)
Jeff Rowe
A University should maintain
an atmosphere of open, honest,
unprejudiced intellectual inquiry
and be at the same time dedicated
to the proposition that life is to
be enjoyed by every individual
with his own special flair.
These principles are translated
into the political realm by my
confidence in the Jeffersonian
ideal that the least government is
the best government, and that
every man should have a voice in
it. Should my voice be chosen one
of the representative few, I intend
to raise it in support of
worthwhile, practical projects of
the ASSU that benefit significant
numbers of students, and raise it

even higher against activities that
lack these virtues. Further, I
intend to push for a maintenance
of the current standard of student
life against the usurpations of
administrators who are trying to
reduce the student body to its
lowest common factor:
intellectually, politically and
socially.
(Jeff Rowe is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Reginald Turner
As chairman of the Senate this
past academic year, I have sought
to expose the student body to the
entire functions and activities of
the Senate.
I started the Senate
Communications Report, which
each senator was required to post
in an assigned area and make
himself answerable and available
to this constituency to answer
whatever questions may arise.
I further worked to establish
the two public forums which the
Senate sponsored to better
educate the community about the
emeriti housing situation and the
USE strike.
This is what I've done and if
elected more is yet to come. I
believe that further investigation
is needed into tuition increases,
ID cards, and the possibility of
establishing of a WATS line for all
students to help cut down on long
distance phone call bills.
I am also willing to study
whatever else the students feel
should be done. The Senate is
here to represent, to help and to
improve.
(Reginald Turner is an
undergraduate.)
Jim Feliciano
I am running for the ASSU
Senate with proposals not
promises. Also, I have run once
before, am currently serving on an
ASSU subcommittee, and last

year wrote a paper that has served
as a significant input in the
growing debate about a University
shuttlebus system. You are
probably waiting for some
concrete proposals and I will not
disappoint you:
1) The members of the ASSU
Nominations Committee should
be limited to serving on one
committee.
2) I urge the speedy
implementation of an ASSU
notetaking service.
3) I urge serious study into the
possibility of transforming
Tresidder from a poor cafeteria
into a student center including a
student store.
(Jim Feliciano is an undergraduate
majoring in philosophy.)
Kurt Hunciker
There is little understanding of
what the Senate can and cannot
do: What powers does the ASSU
Senate have? First, it has control
over $75,000 in funds for student
activities and organizations. The
ASSU can also be a focal point for
student activities and
organizations. The ASSU can't
directly increase the amount of
on-campus housing or reform the
curriculum. But, the Senate can
gain significant inroads into the
making of University policy by
hard work and vigorous lobbying.
This implies both passing
resolutions and following them up
by strongly presenting them to
administrators.
The Senate should lobby for
Residential Colleges. A perfect
opportunity exists to
concurrently design the
educational program and the
facilities available for a residential
college in the newly proposed row
houses. Finally, the class note
service and student co-op, both
proposed by the Council of
Presidents, should be

implemented.
(Kurt Hunciker is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics and political science.)
Ira Rubin
I have a sincere desire to help
the University, which has
contributed so much to me
academically, yet proven deficient
in so many other aspects of
college life.
The housing issue is important
to me (as one who has previously
arrived in the fall unassigned and
despairing). I am also concerned
with the future of the overseas
study program and feel I could
benefit the Senate in this respect.
There is one area of concern
which I feel is extremely lacking
at Stanford. With the except of
Fred Hargadon's "personal" letter
of congratuations upon admission
I believe the University is grossly
deficient in communicating with
its students on any but a mass
basis.
(Ira Rubin is an undergraduate
majoring in political science and
communication.)
Tim Coqway
I am running for the ASSU
Senate to express my views and
take an active role in such
problems as the housing shortage
and the lack of cohesive social
activities for the students.
If elected I will:
1) Attend the bi-weekly
meetings of the Senate.
2) Actively seek the opinions
of other students.
3) Consider these opinions and
decide as I see fit.
Vote on Thursday. If you don't
vote, don't gripe!
(Tim Conway is an undergraduate
majoring in chemistry.)
Mark Pigott
I am running for the Senate.
(Mark Pigott is an undergraduate.)
The following are statements by
candidates for ASSU Senate in
Wednesday's and Thursday's
elections. More statements were
published yesterday.
Mary Ann Toman
The housing draw issue is of
major concern, thus I propose to
concentrate on this and other
student services including
implementation of the proposed
Record Co-op. As a member of
the Record Co-op Committee, I
have already gathered information
and have helped to initiate action.
As for the Pub, I was a member of
the Tresidder Union Committee,
so I was able to gain insight into
the operations of the University,
and especially, those problems
holding up the Pub.
Initiative is necessary for both
senators and students. I have
personally contacted Dr.
Mc Clennahan of the Health and
Safety Committee about the
dangerous biking conditions that
exist on parts of the new Campus
Drive close to the Row. I have
proposed two-way asphalt bike
pathways next to he sidewalks.
Immediate action is necessary. I
have taken the first step.
(Mary Ann Toman is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics.)
Jan Pepper
Much work is facing the ASSU
Senate in the area of student
services. An improved Tresidder
food service, a pub, partly
financed by the excess profits of
the Coffee House or Tresidder,
and safer conditions for bicycles
are a few examples.
The Senate also has the
responsibility of appointing
competent and dedicated students
to serve on University committees
in order to assume that the
student view will be an important
factor in administrative decisions.
Plans for future student housing,
particularly, should be approved
by students in terms of placement
on campus and architectural
design.
(Jan Pepper is an undergraduate
majoring in civil engineering.)

M. Scott Smith
As an ASSU senator, I would
advocate a plan creating a student
majority in the student court
system. ASSU-student body
communication would be aided
by regular reporting of ASSU
activity in the Daily and on
KZSU, and by surveys of student
sentiment on current issues. The
current housing crunch should be
eased by construction of low cost,
temporary housing, not by
assimilation of fraternities into
the draw. More thorough advising
and orientation programs are
needed for freshmen and transfer
students — it takes long enough to
figure out what goes on here as it
is.
(M. Scott Smith is an
undergraduate.)
Mike Dorsey
Maybe I'm a hopeless idealist
(as some of my friends suggest),
but I believe in the concept of
people getting together to work
for something they believe in. I
further believe in the concept of
student government: students
working together in many ways
for the benefit of the entire
student body.
Now, why me? As I stated in
my campaign literature, I believe
that I have the necessary
experience and enthusiasm to be
an effective senator. Before
coming to Stanford I served as
Associated Student Body
President for my high school
(please forgive my accidental
ommission of "high school" in
campaign literature) and, last
year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always
agree with the Council-of-
Presidents, I have confidence in
them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I
thoroughly enjoy this kind of
work, I can readily make my one
promise: to attend every meeting.
(Mike Dorsey is an
undergraduate.)
Jody Meisel
My primary concerns, aside

from the obvious need to make
the Senate into a more viable and
better publicized organization,
include the following:
1) Securing on-campus housing
for all undergraduates who desire
it.
2) Making public hearings a
continued part of the University's
decision-making process.
3) Seeking increased financial
aid and better part-time jobs,
including the placement of
undergraduates in jobs related to
their studies.
4) Improving the present
advisor system.
My experience includes
working with educational
administrators and elected
officials of the Los Angeles Board
of Education, both on a city-wide
student committee and later as a
full-time employee.
(Jody Meisal is an undergraduate
majoring in history.)
Pete Truex
As Stanford students, there are
some problems that we should try
to solve together. The current
housing shortage is of utmost
importance to everybody, and the
lack of campus social activities is
another field where there's a lot
of room for improvement. If
elected, I'll do my best to solve
these and other problems that
face us here at Stanford. I'm
willing to work for you.
(Pete Truex is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Beth Wood
This is my first year at
Stanford so I have not served in
any organizations on campus
previously. However, I feel that I
am well qualified for this position
as I was very active student
government during my high
school years and served as
Vice-president of my Student
Council.
As a member of several
minorities on campus — I am a
black freshwoman planning to
major in pre-law and I live in
Burbank. I feel that I would prove
successful in representing a
substancial portion of the

Stanford populace.
I am prepared to work for the
benefit of Stanford students
through the ASSU Senate right
away but first I need your vote on
October 9 and 10.
(Beth Wood is an undergraduate.)
Eleanor Lynds
I believe the Seante can work
for you, but steps should be taken
to make you more aware of what
issues are coming before the
senators. I will work to create
such interaction. I will bring an
open-minded and responsive voice
to our government, without any
commitments or obligations to
any special interest group.
The issues that will come
before the Senate are important —
the housing problem, the related
question of the future of
Fraternities, the inadequate
service provided by our current
Tresidder food service, the Pub,
and as always the selection of the
Nominations committee. The
Senate needs your opinions, and
above all, senators who are
concerned with maximizing
benefits for all students.
Support a dependable
candidate, concerned with being
an equitable voice and responsive
to you.
(Eleanor Lynds is an
undergraduate majoring in art
history.)
Davis, Germaine, Gray,
Silton, Strnad, Sumner
Students must realize that we
are as important a part of the
Stanford community as the
faculty, administration, and staff.
The student body has the right to
have its views become an integral
part of every important decision.
We are running because we believe
that the ASSU can serve as an
effective student advocate, not
just a clearinghouse for ideas.
Alternatives in housing should
always be open to Stanford
students. Fraternities, then,
should be allowed to exist simply
to add to the diversity of the
University (not because dues and
initiation fees have bought them a
privilege). In order to comply
with Title IX, fraternities should
be allowed to be coed when they

so desire. And more importantly,
theme houses .should also become
exempt from I;he draw in order to
maintain continuity and strength
in the theme.
Of course, the real problem is
the on-camptjs housing shortage.
It is imperative that more student
housing be built, and that the
highest housing priority be
student — not emeritus — housing.
We propose to develop in
conjunction with present
committees a student housing
plan (as th e first part of a student
Land Use plan) that will articulate
student priorities to the
administration and defend these
priorities.
The situation for women at
Stanford is improving. We will do
everything possible to further this
progress.
In orc?ier to reach more women,
we will vote to appropriate funds
for a newsletter on all women's
activities;, and aid all valuable
projects by sisters at Stanford. WE
approve of the appointment of
the Assistnat Dean for Women
and will maintain this important
liaison.. We support the
Organization of Stanford Women
Athletes in its work to gain
equal ity.
The Course Review is the
beginning of real student course
evaluation, but it needs funding to
cove r more courses and to insure a
return of all student opinions.
Wit'fi a respected, comprehensive
Course Review, we can provide a
basis for eventual student input
into tenure decisions. We support
the proposals that the Economics
Department should offer a full
spf.-ctrum of academically
respected thought, and feel that
all academic departments should
b<a more receptive to student
desires for new courses.
(Cynthia Davis, Charlotte
Germane, Chris Gray, Debbi
Hilton, Lyse Strnad, and Mike
Sumner are all undergraduates.)

We will work to provide
government responsive to the
attitudes and needs of the
Stanford Student Body.

Krohn, Sobotka
In talking with many of our
friends before deciding to run for
seats in the ASSU Senate, we
began to realize that perhaps our
finest qualification for office lay
in our lack of commitment to the
established ASSU hierarchy. We
have noted consistently the
growing pre-occupation of the
ASSU with its organizational
structure, leading to extended
discussion of ornamental issues.
We have similarly noted the
disappearance of the ASSU Senate
as an open forum for the candid
airing of real questions facing the
Stanford community.
We have witnessed the
unfortunate lack of student input
in major University decisions.
Notable shortcomings have
included: student housing
(student placement,
determination of independent
status, Resident Fellow and RA
selection), food service (Why is
there a 40 percent overhead?),
academic direction and the
granting of professorial tenure,
and the administration's
misguided priorities. The list of
very real issues yet to be acted
upon will continue to grow as
long as the Senate closes its mind
and ears. We will listen, and we
will act.

Ruben Sanchez
An understanding of the
responsibilities of a student
senator begins with the
recognition that he, or she, is

there to represent. And before
this objective can be reached, a
much more prominant one must
be secured. One of understanding
Stanford University's bureaucratic
scheme. In essence, learning the
sytem, in order to work within it.
Any change, great or small,
necessitates time. As a freshman,
knowledge of such undergoings
will be profitable not only for the
present, but in future encounters,
as well.

coming to Stanford I served as
Associated Student Body
President for my high school
(please forgive my accidental
ommission of "high school" in

year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always
agree with the Council-of-

them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I
thoroughly enjoy this kind of

Jody Meisel
My primary concerns, aside

from the obvious need to make
the Senate into a more viable and
better publicized organization,
include the following:
1) Securing on-campus housing
for all undergraduates who desire
it.
2) Making public hearings a
continued part of the University's
decision-making process.
3) Seeking increased financial
aid and better part-time jobs,
including the placement of
undergraduates in jobs related to
their studies.
4) Improving the present
advisor system.
My experience includes
working with educational
administrators and elected
officials of the Los Angeles Board
of Education, both on a city-wide
student committee and later as a
full-time employee.
(Jody Meisal is an undergraduate
majoring in history.)
Pete Truex
As Stanford students, there are
some problems that we should try
to solve together. The current
housing shortage is of utmost
importance to everybody, and the
lack of campus social activities is
another field where there's a lot
of room for improvement. If
elected, I'll do my best to solve
these and other problems that
face us here at Stanford. I'm
willing to work for you.
(Pete Truex is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Beth Wood
This is my first year at
Stanford so I have not served in
any organizations on campus
previously. However, I feel that I
am well qualified for this position
as I was very active student
government during my high
school years and served as
Vice-president of my Student
Council.
As a member of several
minorities on campus — I am a
black freshwoman planning to
major in pre-law and I live in
Burbank. I feel that I would prove
successful in representing a
substancial portion of the

Stanford populace.
I am prepared to work for the
benefit of Stanford students
through the ASSU Senate right
away but first I need your vote on
October 9 and 10.
(Beth Wood is an undergraduate.)
Eleanor Lynds
I believe the Seante can work
for you, but steps should be taken
to make you more aware of what
issues are coming before the
senators. I will work to create
such interaction. I will bring an
open-minded and responsive voice
to our government, without any
commitments or obligations to
any special interest group.
The issues that will come
before the Senate are important —
the housing problem, the related
question of the future of
Fraternities, the inadequate
service provided by our current
Tresidder food service, the Pub,
and as always the selection of the
Nominations committee. The
Senate needs your opinions, and
above all, senators who are
concerned with maximizing
benefits for all students.
Support a dependable
candidate, concerned with being
an equitable voice and responsive
to you.
(Eleanor Lynds is an
undergraduate majoring in art
history.)
Davis, Germaine, Gray,
Silton, Strnad, Sumner
Students must realize that we
are as important a part of the
Stanford community as the
faculty, administration, and staff.
The student body has the right to
have its views become an integral
part of every important decision.
We are running because we believe
that the ASSU can serve as an
effective student advocate, not
just a clearinghouse for ideas.
Alternatives in housing should
always be open to Stanford
students. Fraternities, then,
should be allowed to exist simply
to add to the diversity of the
University (not because dues and
initiation fees have bought them a
privilege). In order to comply
with Title IX, fraternities should
be allowed to be coed when they

so desire. And more importantly,
theme houses .should also become
exempt from I;he draw in order to
maintain continuity and strength
in the theme.
Of course, the real problem is
the on-camptjs housing shortage.
It is imperative that more student
housing be built, and that the
highest housing priority be
student — not emeritus — housing.
We propose to develop in
conjunction with present
committees a student housing
plan (as th e first part of a student
Land Use plan) that will articulate
student priorities to the
administration and defend these
priorities.
The situation for women at
Stanford is improving. We will do
everything possible to further this
progress.
In orc?ier to reach more women,
we will vote to appropriate funds
for a newsletter on all women's
activities;, and aid all valuable
projects by sisters at Stanford. WE
approve of the appointment of
the Assistnat Dean for Women
and will maintain this important
liaison.. We support the
Organization of Stanford Women
Athletes in its work to gain
equal ity.
The Course Review is the
beginning of real student course
evaluation, but it needs funding to
cove r more courses and to insure a
return of all student opinions.
Wit'fi a respected, comprehensive
Course Review, we can provide a
basis for eventual student input
into tenure decisions. We support
the proposals that the Economics
Department should offer a full
spf.-ctrum of academically
respected thought, and feel that
all academic departments should
b<a more receptive to student
desires for new courses.
(Cynthia Davis, Charlotte
Germane, Chris Gray, Debbi

Krohn, Sobotka
In talking with many of our
friends before deciding to run for
seats in the ASSU Senate, we
began to realize that perhaps our
finest qualification for office lay
in our lack of commitment to the
established ASSU hierarchy. We
have noted consistently the
growing pre-occupation of the
ASSU with its organizational
structure, leading to extended
discussion of ornamental issues.
We have similarly noted the
disappearance of the ASSU Senate
as an open forum for the candid
airing of real questions facing the
Stanford community.
We have witnessed the
unfortunate lack of student input
in major University decisions.
Notable shortcomings have
included: student housing
(student placement,
determination of independent
status, Resident Fellow and RA
selection), food service (Why is
there a 40 percent overhead?),
academic direction and the
granting of professorial tenure,
and the administration's
misguided priorities. The list of
very real issues yet to be acted
upon will continue to grow as
long as the Senate closes its mind
and ears. We will listen, and we
will act.

majoring in mathematics and

Ruben Sanchez
An understanding of the
responsibilities of a student
senator begins with the
recognition that he, or she, is

there to represent. And before
this objective can be reached, a
much more prominant one must
be secured. One of understanding
Stanford University's bureaucratic
scheme. In essence, learning the
sytem, in order to work within it.
Any change, great or small,
necessitates time. As a freshman,
knowledge of such undergoings
will be profitable not only for the
present, but in future encounters,
as well.
(Ruben Sanchez is an
undergraduate.)
Bill Cortes
ASSU Senate campaigns are
typically cluttered with vague
generalizations and hollow
promises as candidates attempt to
capitalize on false issues while
sliding sideways in the face of
really controversial matters. What
is needed is a concrete approach
to problems that directly affect
students and a genuine desire to
effect productive change.
The current housing shortage,
the impending demise of the
fraternity system, the autocratic
policies regarding theme houses,
and the inadequacies of the
residence staffs as perpetrated by
the closed selection and lack of
periodic evaluation of resident
fellows and resident assistants all
point to a need for reform in the
residential education system.
Student input is also needed if
Tresidder is to resume an
improved role in serving
off-campus students and if
student services are to be
increased for transfers.
Real action can be expected
from the Senate only if candidates
with solid programs are elected.
Students should utilize one of the
few direct inputs available to
them and see that this is done.
(Bill Cortes is an undergraduate

majoring in political science.)
Brad Levin
We must study and re-evaluate
the method of administering
examinations at Stanford and the
University grading system, for I
believe that they both contain
some basic faults and
inconsistencies. I will seek the
establishment of an ASSU
committee to study the problems,
to evaluate the system, and to
come up with some workable
solutions.
I've also made a big promise to
all freshmen; not only do I intend
to keep that promise, but now I
extend it to the transfer students.
I believe that there are certain
needs and desires which are
peculiar to freshmen and transfers
and which, up until now, have
gone unrepresented. These
students need greater access
to information and a clearer
explanation of student activities
and programs, so their transition
into the new Stanford
environment will be easier. These
students need a voice, and they
must have greater representation
in all phases of student
government. Finally, these
students need more attention and
honest advice, by providing higher
housing priorities for transfers, by
involving these students in
innovative studies or programs,
and by assisting them in making
important course and career
decisions.
(Brad Levin is an undergraduate.)
Weld, Bergerac
As a result of the system by
which ASSU senators are elected,
freshmen are inadvertently
deprived of fair representation.
Despite the fact that over
one-quarter of the undergraduates
are freshmen, there were no
freshmen senators last year. The
reason for this is quite clear: The

elections are held now, freshmen
learn about the Senate later.
While we realize that
orientation takes time, in a few
weeks freshmen will be as aware
of their goals and expectations as
anyone at Stanford Yet without a
change, they will continue to go
without representation in the
ASSU senate. To alleviate this
problem we have gone out of our
way to familiarize ourselves with
the responsibilities of a senator.
We have talked to senators,
current presidents, and most
importantly to the students around
us. Having recognized what we
feel is an injustice, we have
decided to run for senatorial
positions on the platform of equal
representation.
The process of specialization,
by nature, is one that over the
years draws the individual away
from the University as a whole. As
freshmen, we have more time and
optimistic enthusiasm which we
want to apply to more than just
academic life.
(Kit Weld and Randy Bergerac are
undergraduates.)
Jeff Rowe
A University should maintain
an atmosphere of open, honest,
unprejudiced intellectual inquiry
and be at the same time dedicated
to the proposition that life is to
be enjoyed by every individual
with his own special flair.
These principles are translated
into the political realm by my
confidence in the Jeffersonian
ideal that the least government is
the best government, and that
every man should have a voice in
it. Should my voice be chosen one
of the representative few, I intend
to raise it in support of
worthwhile, practical projects of
the ASSU that benefit significant
numbers of students, and raise it

even higher against activities that
lack these virtues. Further, I
intend to push for a maintenance
of the current standard of student
life against the usurpations of
administrators who are trying to
reduce the student body to its
lowest common factor:
intellectually, politically and
socially.
(Jeff Rowe is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Reginald Turner
As chairman of the Senate this
past academic year, I have sought
to expose the student body to the
entire functions and activities of
the Senate.
I started the Senate
Communications Report, which
each senator was required to post
in an assigned area and make
himself answerable and available
to this constituency to answer
whatever questions may arise.
I further worked to establish
the two public forums which the
Senate sponsored to better
educate the community about the
emeriti housing situation and the
USE strike.
This is what I've done and if
elected more is yet to come. I
believe that further investigation
is needed into tuition increases,
ID cards, and the possibility of
establishing of a WATS line for all
students to help cut down on long
distance phone call bills.
I am also willing to study
whatever else the students feel
should be done. The Senate is
here to represent, to help and to
improve.
(Reginald Turner is an
undergraduate.)
Jim Feliciano
I am running for the ASSU
Senate with proposals not
promises. Also, I have run once
before, am currently serving on an
ASSU subcommittee, and last

year wrote a paper that has served
as a significant input in the
growing debate about a University
shuttlebus system. You are
probably waiting for some
concrete proposals and I will not
disappoint you:
1) The members of the ASSU
Nominations Committee should
be limited to serving on one
committee.
2) I urge the speedy
implementation of an ASSU
notetaking service.
3) I urge serious study into the
possibility of transforming
Tresidder from a poor cafeteria
into a student center including a
student store.
(Jim Feliciano is an undergraduate
majoring in philosophy.)
Kurt Hunciker
There is little understanding of
what the Senate can and cannot
do: What powers does the ASSU
Senate have? First, it has control
over $75,000 in funds for student
activities and organizations. The
ASSU can also be a focal point for
student activities and
organizations. The ASSU can't
directly increase the amount of
on-campus housing or reform the
curriculum. But, the Senate can
gain significant inroads into the
making of University policy by
hard work and vigorous lobbying.
This implies both passing
resolutions and following them up
by strongly presenting them to
administrators.
The Senate should lobby for
Residential Colleges. A perfect
opportunity exists to
concurrently design the
educational program and the
facilities available for a residential
college in the newly proposed row
houses. Finally, the class note
service and student co-op, both
proposed by the Council of
Presidents, should be

implemented.
(Kurt Hunciker is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics and political science.)
Ira Rubin
I have a sincere desire to help
the University, which has
contributed so much to me
academically, yet proven deficient
in so many other aspects of
college life.
The housing issue is important
to me (as one who has previously
arrived in the fall unassigned and
despairing). I am also concerned
with the future of the overseas
study program and feel I could
benefit the Senate in this respect.
There is one area of concern
which I feel is extremely lacking
at Stanford. With the except of
Fred Hargadon's "personal" letter
of congratuations upon admission
I believe the University is grossly
deficient in communicating with
its students on any but a mass
basis.
(Ira Rubin is an undergraduate
majoring in political science and
communication.)
Tim Coqway
I am running for the ASSU
Senate to express my views and
take an active role in such
problems as the housing shortage
and the lack of cohesive social
activities for the students.
If elected I will:
1) Attend the bi-weekly
meetings of the Senate.
2) Actively seek the opinions
of other students.
3) Consider these opinions and
decide as I see fit.
Vote on Thursday. If you don't
vote, don't gripe!
(Tim Conway is an undergraduate
majoring in chemistry.)
Mark Pigott
I am running for the Senate.
(Mark Pigott is an undergraduate.)
The following are statements by
candidates for ASSU Senate in
Wednesday's and Thursday's
elections. More statements were
published yesterday.
Mary Ann Toman
The housing draw issue is of
major concern, thus I propose to
concentrate on this and other
student services including
implementation of the proposed
Record Co-op. As a member of
the Record Co-op Committee, I
have already gathered information
and have helped to initiate action.
As for the Pub, I was a member of
the Tresidder Union Committee,
so I was able to gain insight into
the operations of the University,
and especially, those problems
holding up the Pub.
Initiative is necessary for both
senators and students. I have
personally contacted Dr.
Mc Clennahan of the Health and
Safety Committee about the
dangerous biking conditions that
exist on parts of the new Campus
Drive close to the Row. I have
proposed two-way asphalt bike
pathways next to he sidewalks.
Immediate action is necessary. I
have taken the first step.
(Mary Ann Toman is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics.)
Jan Pepper
Much work is facing the ASSU
Senate in the area of student
services. An improved Tresidder
food service, a pub, partly
financed by the excess profits of
the Coffee House or Tresidder,
and safer conditions for bicycles
are a few examples.
The Senate also has the
responsibility of appointing
competent and dedicated students
to serve on University committees
in order to assume that the
student view will be an important
factor in administrative decisions.
Plans for future student housing,
particularly, should be approved
by students in terms of placement
on campus and architectural
design.
(Jan Pepper is an undergraduate
majoring in civil engineering.)

M. Scott Smith
As an ASSU senator, I would
advocate a plan creating a student
majority in the student court
system. ASSU-student body
communication would be aided
by regular reporting of ASSU
activity in the Daily and on
KZSU, and by surveys of student
sentiment on current issues. The
current housing crunch should be
eased by construction of low cost,
temporary housing, not by
assimilation of fraternities into
the draw. More thorough advising
and orientation programs are
needed for freshmen and transfer
students — it takes long enough to
figure out what goes on here as it
is.
(M. Scott Smith is an
undergraduate.)
Mike Dorsey
Maybe I'm a hopeless idealist
(as some of my friends suggest),
but I believe in the concept of
people getting together to work
for something they believe in. I
further believe in the concept of
student government: students
working together in many ways
for the benefit of the entire
student body.
Now, why me? As I stated in
my campaign literature, I believe
that I have the necessary
experience and enthusiasm to be
an effective senator. Before
coming to Stanford I served as
Associated Student Body
President for my high school
(please forgive my accidental
ommission of "high school" in
campaign literature) and, last
year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always
agree with the Council-of-
Presidents, I have confidence in
them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I
thoroughly enjoy this kind of
work, I can readily make my one
promise: to attend every meeting.
(Mike Dorsey is an
undergraduate.)
Jody Meisel
My primary concerns, aside

from the obvious need to make

2) Making public hearings a
continued part of the University's
decision-making process.
3) Seeking increased financial
aid and better part-time jobs,
including the placement of
undergraduates in jobs related to
their studies.
4) Improving the present
advisor system.
My experience includes
working with educational
administrators and elected
officials of the Los Angeles Board
of Education, both on a city-wide
student committee and later as a
full-time employee.

Pete Truex
As Stanford students, there are
some problems that we should try

elected, I'll do my best to solve
these and other problems that

willing to work for you.

Beth Wood
This is my first year at
Stanford so I have not served in

ID cards, and the possibility of
establishing of a WATS line for all
students to help cut down on long
distance phone call bills.
I am also willing to study
whatever else the students feel
should be done. The Senate is
here to represent, to help and to
improve.
(Reginald Turner is an
undergraduate.)
Jim Feliciano
I am running for the ASSU
Senate with proposals not
promises. Also, I have run once
before, am currently serving on an
ASSU subcommittee, and last

year wrote a paper that has served
as a significant input in the
growing debate about a University
shuttlebus system. You are
probably waiting for some
concrete proposals and I will not
disappoint you:
1) The members of the ASSU
Nominations Committee should
be limited to serving on one
committee.
2) I urge the speedy
implementation of an ASSU
notetaking service.
3) I urge serious study into the
possibility of transforming
Tresidder from a poor cafeteria
into a student center including a
student store.
(Jim Feliciano is an undergraduate
majoring in philosophy.)
Kurt Hunciker
There is little understanding of
what the Senate can and cannot
do: What powers does the ASSU
Senate have? First, it has control
over $75,000 in funds for student
activities and organizations. The
ASSU can also be a focal point for
student activities and
organizations. The ASSU can't
directly increase the amount of
on-campus housing or reform the
curriculum. But, the Senate can
gain significant inroads into the
making of University policy by
hard work and vigorous lobbying.
This implies both passing
resolutions and following them up
by strongly presenting them to
administrators.
The Senate should lobby for
Residential Colleges. A perfect
opportunity exists to
concurrently design the
educational program and the
facilities available for a residential
college in the newly proposed row
houses. Finally, the class note
service and student co-op, both
proposed by the Council of
Presidents, should be

implemented.
(Kurt Hunciker is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics and political science.)
Ira Rubin
I have a sincere desire to help
the University, which has
contributed so much to me
academically, yet proven deficient
in so many other aspects of
college life.
The housing issue is important
to me (as one who has previously
arrived in the fall unassigned and
despairing). I am also concerned
with the future of the overseas
study program and feel I could
benefit the Senate in this respect.
There is one area of concern
which I feel is extremely lacking
at Stanford. With the except of
Fred Hargadon's "personal" letter
of congratuations upon admission
I believe the University is grossly
deficient in communicating with
its students on any but a mass
basis.
(Ira Rubin is an undergraduate
majoring in political science and
communication.)
Tim Coqway
I am running for the ASSU
Senate to express my views and
take an active role in such
problems as the housing shortage
and the lack of cohesive social
activities for the students.
If elected I will:
1) Attend the bi-weekly
meetings of the Senate.
2) Actively seek the opinions
of other students.
3) Consider these opinions and
decide as I see fit.
Vote on Thursday. If you don't
vote, don't gripe!
(Tim Conway is an undergraduate
majoring in chemistry.)
Mark Pigott
I am running for the Senate.
(Mark Pigott is an undergraduate.)
The following are statements by
candidates for ASSU Senate in
Wednesday's and Thursday's
elections. More statements were
published yesterday.
Mary Ann Toman
The housing draw issue is of
major concern, thus I propose to
concentrate on this and other
student services including
implementation of the proposed
Record Co-op. As a member of
the Record Co-op Committee, I
have already gathered information
and have helped to initiate action.
As for the Pub, I was a member of
the Tresidder Union Committee,
so I was able to gain insight into
the operations of the University,
and especially, those problems
holding up the Pub.
Initiative is necessary for both
senators and students. I have
personally contacted Dr.
Mc Clennahan of the Health and
Safety Committee about the
dangerous biking conditions that
exist on parts of the new Campus
Drive close to the Row. I have
proposed two-way asphalt bike
pathways next to he sidewalks.
Immediate action is necessary. I
have taken the first step.
(Mary Ann Toman is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics.)
Jan Pepper
Much work is facing the ASSU
Senate in the area of student
services. An improved Tresidder
food service, a pub, partly
financed by the excess profits of
the Coffee House or Tresidder,
and safer conditions for bicycles
are a few examples.
The Senate also has the
responsibility of appointing
competent and dedicated students
to serve on University committees
in order to assume that the
student view will be an important
factor in administrative decisions.
Plans for future student housing,
particularly, should be approved
by students in terms of placement
on campus and architectural
design.
(Jan Pepper is an undergraduate
majoring in civil engineering.)

M. Scott Smith
As an ASSU senator, I would
advocate a plan creating a student
majority in the student court
system. ASSU-student body
communication would be aided
by regular reporting of ASSU
activity in the Daily and on
KZSU, and by surveys of student
sentiment on current issues. The
current housing crunch should be
eased by construction of low cost,
temporary housing, not by
assimilation of fraternities into
the draw. More thorough advising
and orientation programs are
needed for freshmen and transfer
students — it takes long enough to
figure out what goes on here as it
is.
(M. Scott Smith is an
undergraduate.)
Mike Dorsey
Maybe I'm a hopeless idealist
(as some of my friends suggest),
but I believe in the concept of
people getting together to work
for something they believe in. I
further believe in the concept of
student government: students
working together in many ways
for the benefit of the entire
student body.
Now, why me? As I stated in
my campaign literature, I believe
that I have the necessary
experience and enthusiasm to be
an effective senator. Before
coming to Stanford I served as
Associated Student Body
President for my high school
(please forgive my accidental
ommission of "high school" in
campaign literature) and, last
year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always
agree with the Council-of-
Presidents, I have confidence in
them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I
thoroughly enjoy this kind of
work, I can readily make my one
promise: to attend every meeting.
(Mike Dorsey is an
undergraduate.)
Jody Meisel
My primary concerns, aside

from the obvious need to make
the Senate into a more viable and
better publicized organization,
include the following:
1) Securing on-campus housing
for all undergraduates who desire
it.
2) Making public hearings a
continued part of the University's
decision-making process.
3) Seeking increased financial
aid and better part-time jobs,
including the placement of
undergraduates in jobs related to
their studies.
4) Improving the present
advisor system.
My experience includes
working with educational
administrators and elected
officials of the Los Angeles Board
of Education, both on a city-wide
student committee and later as a
full-time employee.
(Jody Meisal is an undergraduate
majoring in history.)
Pete Truex
As Stanford students, there are
some problems that we should try
to solve together. The current
housing shortage is of utmost
importance to everybody, and the
lack of campus social activities is
another field where there's a lot
of room for improvement. If
elected, I'll do my best to solve
these and other problems that
face us here at Stanford. I'm
willing to work for you.
(Pete Truex is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Beth Wood
This is my first year at
Stanford so I have not served in
any organizations on campus
previously. However, I feel that I
am well qualified for this position
as I was very active student
government during my high
school years and served as
Vice-president of my Student
Council.
As a member of several
minorities on campus — I am a
black freshwoman planning to
major in pre-law and I live in
Burbank. I feel that I would prove
successful in representing a
substancial portion of the

Stanford populace.
I am prepared to work for the
benefit of Stanford students
through the ASSU Senate right
away but first I need your vote on
October 9 and 10.
(Beth Wood is an undergraduate.)
Eleanor Lynds
I believe the Seante can work
for you, but steps should be taken
to make you more aware of what
issues are coming before the
senators. I will work to create
such interaction. I will bring an
open-minded and responsive voice
to our government, without any
commitments or obligations to
any special interest group.
The issues that will come
before the Senate are important —
the housing problem, the related
question of the future of
Fraternities, the inadequate
service provided by our current
Tresidder food service, the Pub,
and as always the selection of the
Nominations committee. The
Senate needs your opinions, and
above all, senators who are
concerned with maximizing
benefits for all students.
Support a dependable
candidate, concerned with being
an equitable voice and responsive
to you.
(Eleanor Lynds is an
undergraduate majoring in art
history.)
Davis, Germaine, Gray,
Silton, Strnad, Sumner
Students must realize that we
are as important a part of the
Stanford community as the
faculty, administration, and staff.
The student body has the right to
have its views become an integral
part of every important decision.
We are running because we believe
that the ASSU can serve as an
effective student advocate, not
just a clearinghouse for ideas.
Alternatives in housing should
always be open to Stanford
students. Fraternities, then,
should be allowed to exist simply
to add to the diversity of the
University (not because dues and
initiation fees have bought them a
privilege). In order to comply
with Title IX, fraternities should
be allowed to be coed when they

so desire. And more importantly,
theme houses .should also become
exempt from I;he draw in order to
maintain continuity and strength
in the theme.
Of course, the real problem is
the on-camptjs housing shortage.
It is imperative that more student
housing be built, and that the
highest housing priority be
student — not emeritus — housing.
We propose to develop in
conjunction with present
committees a student housing
plan (as th e first part of a student
Land Use plan) that will articulate
student priorities to the
administration and defend these
priorities.
The situation for women at
Stanford is improving. We will do
everything possible to further this
progress.
In orc?ier to reach more women,
we will vote to appropriate funds
for a newsletter on all women's
activities;, and aid all valuable
projects by sisters at Stanford. WE
approve of the appointment of
the Assistnat Dean for Women
and will maintain this important
liaison.. We support the
Organization of Stanford Women
Athletes in its work to gain
equal ity.
The Course Review is the
beginning of real student course
evaluation, but it needs funding to
cove r more courses and to insure a
return of all student opinions.
Wit'fi a respected, comprehensive
Course Review, we can provide a
basis for eventual student input
into tenure decisions. We support
the proposals that the Economics
Department should offer a full
spf.-ctrum of academically
respected thought, and feel that
all academic departments should
b<a more receptive to student
desires for new courses.
(Cynthia Davis, Charlotte
Germane, Chris Gray, Debbi
Hilton, Lyse Strnad, and Mike
Sumner are all undergraduates.)
Janeway, Max
We will work to provide
government responsive to the
attitudes and needs of the
Stanford Student Body.
(Kate Janeway is an

humanities. Wendy Max is an

Krohn, Sobotka
In talking with many of our
friends before deciding to run for
seats in the ASSU Senate, we
began to realize that perhaps our
finest qualification for office lay
in our lack of commitment to the
established ASSU hierarchy. We
have noted consistently the
growing pre-occupation of the
ASSU with its organizational
structure, leading to extended
discussion of ornamental issues.
We have similarly noted the
disappearance of the ASSU Senate
as an open forum for the candid
airing of real questions facing the
Stanford community.
We have witnessed the
unfortunate lack of student input
in major University decisions.
Notable shortcomings have
included: student housing
(student placement,
determination of independent
status, Resident Fellow and RA
selection), food service (Why is
there a 40 percent overhead?),
academic direction and the
granting of professorial tenure,
and the administration's
misguided priorities. The list of
very real issues yet to be acted
upon will continue to grow as
long as the Senate closes its mind
and ears. We will listen, and we
will act.
(Doug Krohn is an undergraduate
majoring in mathematics and
philosophy. Paul Sobotka is an

Ruben Sanchez
An understanding of the
responsibilities of a student
senator begins with the
recognition that he, or she, is

there to represent. And before
this objective can be reached, a
much more prominant one must
be secured. One of understanding
Stanford University's bureaucratic
scheme. In essence, learning the
sytem, in order to work within it.
Any change, great or small,
necessitates time. As a freshman,
knowledge of such undergoings
will be profitable not only for the
present, but in future encounters,
as well.
(Ruben Sanchez is an
undergraduate.)
Bill Cortes
ASSU Senate campaigns are
typically cluttered with vague
generalizations and hollow
promises as candidates attempt to
capitalize on false issues while
sliding sideways in the face of
really controversial matters. What
is needed is a concrete approach
to problems that directly affect
students and a genuine desire to
effect productive change.
The current housing shortage,
the impending demise of the
fraternity system, the autocratic
policies regarding theme houses,
and the inadequacies of the
residence staffs as perpetrated by
the closed selection and lack of
periodic evaluation of resident
fellows and resident assistants all
point to a need for reform in the
residential education system.
Student input is also needed if
Tresidder is to resume an
improved role in serving
off-campus students and if
student services are to be
increased for transfers.
Real action can be expected
from the Senate only if candidates
with solid programs are elected.
Students should utilize one of the
few direct inputs available to
them and see that this is done.
(Bill Cortes is an undergraduate

majoring in political science.)
Brad Levin
We must study and re-evaluate
the method of administering
examinations at Stanford and the
University grading system, for I
believe that they both contain
some basic faults and
inconsistencies. I will seek the
establishment of an ASSU
committee to study the problems,
to evaluate the system, and to
come up with some workable
solutions.
I've also made a big promise to
all freshmen; not only do I intend
to keep that promise, but now I
extend it to the transfer students.
I believe that there are certain
needs and desires which are
peculiar to freshmen and transfers
and which, up until now, have
gone unrepresented. These
students need greater access
to information and a clearer
explanation of student activities
and programs, so their transition
into the new Stanford
environment will be easier. These
students need a voice, and they
must have greater representation
in all phases of student
government. Finally, these
students need more attention and
honest advice, by providing higher
housing priorities for transfers, by
involving these students in
innovative studies or programs,
and by assisting them in making
important course and career
decisions.
(Brad Levin is an undergraduate.)
Weld, Bergerac
As a result of the system by
which ASSU senators are elected,
freshmen are inadvertently
deprived of fair representation.
Despite the fact that over
one-quarter of the undergraduates
are freshmen, there were no
freshmen senators last year. The
reason for this is quite clear: The

elections are held now, freshmen
learn about the Senate later.
While we realize that
orientation takes time, in a few
weeks freshmen will be as aware
of their goals and expectations as
anyone at Stanford Yet without a
change, they will continue to go
without representation in the
ASSU senate. To alleviate this
problem we have gone out of our
way to familiarize ourselves with
the responsibilities of a senator.
We have talked to senators,
current presidents, and most
importantly to the students around
us. Having recognized what we
feel is an injustice, we have
decided to run for senatorial
positions on the platform of equal
representation.
The process of specialization,
by nature, is one that over the
years draws the individual away
from the University as a whole. As
freshmen, we have more time and
optimistic enthusiasm which we
want to apply to more than just
academic life.
(Kit Weld and Randy Bergerac are
undergraduates.)
Jeff Rowe
A University should maintain
an atmosphere of open, honest,
unprejudiced intellectual inquiry
and be at the same time dedicated
to the proposition that life is to
be enjoyed by every individual
with his own special flair.
These principles are translated
into the political realm by my
confidence in the Jeffersonian
ideal that the least government is
the best government, and that
every man should have a voice in
it. Should my voice be chosen one
of the representative few, I intend
to raise it in support of
worthwhile, practical projects of
the ASSU that benefit significant
numbers of students, and raise it

even higher against activities that
lack these virtues. Further, I
intend to push for a maintenance
of the current standard of student
life against the usurpations of
administrators who are trying to
reduce the student body to its
lowest common factor:
intellectually, politically and
socially.
(Jeff Rowe is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Reginald Turner
As chairman of the Senate this
past academic year, I have sought
to expose the student body to the
entire functions and activities of
the Senate.
I started the Senate
Communications Report, which
each senator was required to post
in an assigned area and make
himself answerable and available
to this constituency to answer
whatever questions may arise.
I further worked to establish
the two public forums which the
Senate sponsored to better
educate the community about the
emeriti housing situation and the
USE strike.
This is what I've done and if
elected more is yet to come. I
believe that further investigation
is needed into tuition increases,
ID cards, and the possibility of
establishing of a WATS line for all
students to help cut down on long
distance phone call bills.
I am also willing to study
whatever else the students feel
should be done. The Senate is
here to represent, to help and to
improve.
(Reginald Turner is an
undergraduate.)
Jim Feliciano
I am running for the ASSU
Senate with proposals not

as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty

Krohn, Sobotka
In talking with many of our
friends before deciding to run for
seats in the ASSU Senate, we
began to realize that perhaps our
finest qualification for office lay
in our lack of commitment to the
established ASSU hierarchy. We
have noted consistently the
growing pre-occupation of the
ASSU with its organizational
structure, leading to extended
discussion of ornamental issues.
We have similarly noted the
disappearance of the ASSU Senate
as an open forum for the candid
airing of real questions facing the
Stanford community.
We have witnessed the
unfortunate lack of student input
in major University decisions.
Notable shortcomings have
included: student housing
(student placement,
determination of independent
status, Resident Fellow and RA
selection), food service (Why is
there a 40 percent overhead?),
academic direction and the
granting of professorial tenure,
and the administration's
misguided priorities. The list of
very real issues yet to be acted
upon will continue to grow as
long as the Senate closes its mind
and ears. We will listen, and we
will act.

Ruben Sanchez
An understanding of the
responsibilities of a student
senator begins with the
recognition that he, or she, is

there to represent. And before
this objective can be reached, a
much more prominant one must
be secured. One of understanding
Stanford University's bureaucratic
scheme. In essence, learning the
sytem, in order to work within it.
Any change, great or small,
necessitates time. As a freshman,
knowledge of such undergoings
will be profitable not only for the
present, but in future encounters,
as well.
(Ruben Sanchez is an
undergraduate.)
Bill Cortes
ASSU Senate campaigns are
typically cluttered with vague
generalizations and hollow
promises as candidates attempt to
capitalize on false issues while
sliding sideways in the face of
really controversial matters. What
is needed is a concrete approach
to problems that directly affect
students and a genuine desire to
effect productive change.
The current housing shortage,
the impending demise of the
fraternity system, the autocratic
policies regarding theme houses,
and the inadequacies of the
residence staffs as perpetrated by
the closed selection and lack of
periodic evaluation of resident
fellows and resident assistants all
point to a need for reform in the
residential education system.
Student input is also needed if
Tresidder is to resume an
improved role in serving
off-campus students and if
student services are to be
increased for transfers.
Real action can be expected
from the Senate only if candidates
with solid programs are elected.
Students should utilize one of the
few direct inputs available to
them and see that this is done.
(Bill Cortes is an undergraduate

majoring in political science.)
Brad Levin
We must study and re-evaluate
the method of administering
examinations at Stanford and the
University grading system, for I
believe that they both contain
some basic faults and
inconsistencies. I will seek the
establishment of an ASSU
committee to study the problems,
to evaluate the system, and to
come up with some workable
solutions.
I've also made a big promise to
all freshmen; not only do I intend
to keep that promise, but now I
extend it to the transfer students.
I believe that there are certain
needs and desires which are
peculiar to freshmen and transfers
and which, up until now, have
gone unrepresented. These
students need greater access
to information and a clearer
explanation of student activities
and programs, so their transition
into the new Stanford
environment will be easier. These
students need a voice, and they
must have greater representation
in all phases of student
government. Finally, these
students need more attention and
honest advice, by providing higher
housing priorities for transfers, by
involving these students in
innovative studies or programs,
and by assisting them in making
important course and career
decisions.
(Brad Levin is an undergraduate.)
Weld, Bergerac
As a result of the system by
which ASSU senators are elected,
freshmen are inadvertently
deprived of fair representation.
Despite the fact that over
one-quarter of the undergraduates
are freshmen, there were no
freshmen senators last year. The
reason for this is quite clear: The

elections are held now, freshmen
learn about the Senate later.
While we realize that
orientation takes time, in a few
weeks freshmen will be as aware
of their goals and expectations as
anyone at Stanford Yet without a
change, they will continue to go
without representation in the
ASSU senate. To alleviate this
problem we have gone out of our
way to familiarize ourselves with
the responsibilities of a senator.
We have talked to senators,
current presidents, and most
importantly to the students around
us. Having recognized what we
feel is an injustice, we have
decided to run for senatorial
positions on the platform of equal
representation.
The process of specialization,
by nature, is one that over the
years draws the individual away
from the University as a whole. As
freshmen, we have more time and
optimistic enthusiasm which we
want to apply to more than just
academic life.
(Kit Weld and Randy Bergerac are
undergraduates.)
Jeff Rowe
A University should maintain
an atmosphere of open, honest,
unprejudiced intellectual inquiry
and be at the same time dedicated
to the proposition that life is to
be enjoyed by every individual
with his own special flair.
These principles are translated
into the political realm by my
confidence in the Jeffersonian
ideal that the least government is
the best government, and that
every man should have a voice in
it. Should my voice be chosen one
of the representative few, I intend
to raise it in support of
worthwhile, practical projects of
the ASSU that benefit significant
numbers of students, and raise it

even higher against activities that
lack these virtues. Further, I
intend to push for a maintenance
of the current standard of student
life against the usurpations of
administrators who are trying to
reduce the student body to its
lowest common factor:
intellectually, politically and
socially.
(Jeff Rowe is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Reginald Turner
As chairman of the Senate this
past academic year, I have sought
to expose the student body to the
entire functions and activities of
the Senate.
I started the Senate
Communications Report, which
each senator was required to post
in an assigned area and make
himself answerable and available
to this constituency to answer
whatever questions may arise.
I further worked to establish
the two public forums which the
Senate sponsored to better
educate the community about the
emeriti housing situation and the
USE strike.
This is what I've done and if
elected more is yet to come. I
believe that further investigation
is needed into tuition increases,
ID cards, and the possibility of
establishing of a WATS line for all
students to help cut down on long
distance phone call bills.
I am also willing to study
whatever else the students feel
should be done. The Senate is
here to represent, to help and to
improve.
(Reginald Turner is an
undergraduate.)
Jim Feliciano
I am running for the ASSU
Senate with proposals not
promises. Also, I have run once
before, am currently serving on an
ASSU subcommittee, and last

year wrote a paper that has served
as a significant input in the
growing debate about a University
shuttlebus system. You are
probably waiting for some
concrete proposals and I will not
disappoint you:
1) The members of the ASSU
Nominations Committee should
be limited to serving on one
committee.
2) I urge the speedy
implementation of an ASSU
notetaking service.
3) I urge serious study into the
possibility of transforming
Tresidder from a poor cafeteria
into a student center including a
student store.
(Jim Feliciano is an undergraduate
majoring in philosophy.)
Kurt Hunciker
There is little understanding of
what the Senate can and cannot
do: What powers does the ASSU
Senate have? First, it has control
over $75,000 in funds for student
activities and organizations. The
ASSU can also be a focal point for
student activities and
organizations. The ASSU can't
directly increase the amount of
on-campus housing or reform the
curriculum. But, the Senate can
gain significant inroads into the
making of University policy by
hard work and vigorous lobbying.
This implies both passing
resolutions and following them up
by strongly presenting them to
administrators.
The Senate should lobby for
Residential Colleges. A perfect
opportunity exists to
concurrently design the
educational program and the
facilities available for a residential
college in the newly proposed row
houses. Finally, the class note
service and student co-op, both
proposed by the Council of
Presidents, should be

implemented.
(Kurt Hunciker is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics and political science.)
Ira Rubin
I have a sincere desire to help
the University, which has
contributed so much to me
academically, yet proven deficient
in so many other aspects of
college life.
The housing issue is important
to me (as one who has previously
arrived in the fall unassigned and
despairing). I am also concerned
with the future of the overseas
study program and feel I could
benefit the Senate in this respect.
There is one area of concern
which I feel is extremely lacking
at Stanford. With the except of
Fred Hargadon's "personal" letter
of congratuations upon admission
I believe the University is grossly
deficient in communicating with
its students on any but a mass
basis.
(Ira Rubin is an undergraduate
majoring in political science and
communication.)
Tim Coqway
I am running for the ASSU
Senate to express my views and
take an active role in such
problems as the housing shortage
and the lack of cohesive social
activities for the students.
If elected I will:
1) Attend the bi-weekly
meetings of the Senate.
2) Actively seek the opinions
of other students.
3) Consider these opinions and
decide as I see fit.
Vote on Thursday. If you don't
vote, don't gripe!
(Tim Conway is an undergraduate
majoring in chemistry.)
Mark Pigott
I am running for the Senate.
(Mark Pigott is an undergraduate.)
The following are statements by
candidates for ASSU Senate in
Wednesday's and Thursday's
elections. More statements were
published yesterday.
Mary Ann Toman
The housing draw issue is of
major concern, thus I propose to
concentrate on this and other
student services including
implementation of the proposed
Record Co-op. As a member of
the Record Co-op Committee, I
have already gathered information
and have helped to initiate action.
As for the Pub, I was a member of
the Tresidder Union Committee,
so I was able to gain insight into
the operations of the University,
and especially, those problems
holding up the Pub.
Initiative is necessary for both
senators and students. I have
personally contacted Dr.
Mc Clennahan of the Health and
Safety Committee about the
dangerous biking conditions that
exist on parts of the new Campus
Drive close to the Row. I have
proposed two-way asphalt bike
pathways next to he sidewalks.
Immediate action is necessary. I
have taken the first step.
(Mary Ann Toman is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics.)
Jan Pepper
Much work is facing the ASSU
Senate in the area of student
services. An improved Tresidder
food service, a pub, partly
financed by the excess profits of
the Coffee House or Tresidder,
and safer conditions for bicycles
are a few examples.
The Senate also has the
responsibility of appointing
competent and dedicated students
to serve on University committees
in order to assume that the
student view will be an important
factor in administrative decisions.
Plans for future student housing,
particularly, should be approved
by students in terms of placement
on campus and architectural
design.
(Jan Pepper is an undergraduate
majoring in civil engineering.)

M. Scott Smith
As an ASSU senator, I would
advocate a plan creating a student
majority in the student court
system. ASSU-student body
communication would be aided
by regular reporting of ASSU
activity in the Daily and on
KZSU, and by surveys of student
sentiment on current issues. The
current housing crunch should be
eased by construction of low cost,
temporary housing, not by
assimilation of fraternities into
the draw. More thorough advising
and orientation programs are
needed for freshmen and transfer
students — it takes long enough to
figure out what goes on here as it
is.
(M. Scott Smith is an
undergraduate.)
Mike Dorsey
Maybe I'm a hopeless idealist
(as some of my friends suggest),
but I believe in the concept of
people getting together to work
for something they believe in. I
further believe in the concept of
student government: students
working together in many ways
for the benefit of the entire
student body.
Now, why me? As I stated in
my campaign literature, I believe
that I have the necessary
experience and enthusiasm to be
an effective senator. Before
coming to Stanford I served as
Associated Student Body
President for my high school
(please forgive my accidental
ommission of "high school" in
campaign literature) and, last
year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always
agree with the Council-of-
Presidents, I have confidence in
them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I
thoroughly enjoy this kind of
work, I can readily make my one
promise: to attend every meeting.
(Mike Dorsey is an
undergraduate.)
Jody Meisel
My primary concerns, aside

from the obvious need to make
the Senate into a more viable and
better publicized organization,
include the following:
1) Securing on-campus housing
for all undergraduates who desire
it.
2) Making public hearings a
continued part of the University's
decision-making process.
3) Seeking increased financial
aid and better part-time jobs,
including the placement of
undergraduates in jobs related to
their studies.
4) Improving the present
advisor system.
My experience includes
working with educational
administrators and elected
officials of the Los Angeles Board
of Education, both on a city-wide
student committee and later as a
full-time employee.
(Jody Meisal is an undergraduate
majoring in history.)
Pete Truex
As Stanford students, there are
some problems that we should try
to solve together. The current
housing shortage is of utmost
importance to everybody, and the
lack of campus social activities is
another field where there's a lot
of room for improvement. If
elected, I'll do my best to solve
these and other problems that
face us here at Stanford. I'm
willing to work for you.
(Pete Truex is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Beth Wood
This is my first year at
Stanford so I have not served in
any organizations on campus
previously. However, I feel that I
am well qualified for this position
as I was very active student
government during my high
school years and served as
Vice-president of my Student
Council.
As a member of several
minorities on campus — I am a
black freshwoman planning to
major in pre-law and I live in
Burbank. I feel that I would prove
successful in representing a
substancial portion of the

Stanford populace.
I am prepared to work for the
benefit of Stanford students
through the ASSU Senate right
away but first I need your vote on
October 9 and 10.
(Beth Wood is an undergraduate.)
Eleanor Lynds
I believe the Seante can work
for you, but steps should be taken
to make you more aware of what
issues are coming before the
senators. I will work to create
such interaction. I will bring an
open-minded and responsive voice
to our government, without any
commitments or obligations to
any special interest group.
The issues that will come
before the Senate are important —
the housing problem, the related
question of the future of
Fraternities, the inadequate
service provided by our current
Tresidder food service, the Pub,
and as always the selection of the
Nominations committee. The
Senate needs your opinions, and
above all, senators who are
concerned with maximizing
benefits for all students.
Support a dependable
candidate, concerned with being
an equitable voice and responsive
to you.
(Eleanor Lynds is an
undergraduate majoring in art
history.)
Davis, Germaine, Gray,
Silton, Strnad, Sumner
Students must realize that we
are as important a part of the
Stanford community as the
faculty, administration, and staff.
The student body has the right to
have its views become an integral
part of every important decision.
We are running because we believe
that the ASSU can serve as an
effective student advocate, not
just a clearinghouse for ideas.
Alternatives in housing should
always be open to Stanford
students. Fraternities, then,
should be allowed to exist simply
to add to the diversity of the
University (not because dues and
initiation fees have bought them a
privilege). In order to comply
with Title IX, fraternities should
be allowed to be coed when they

so desire. And more importantly,
theme houses .should also become
exempt from I;he draw in order to
maintain continuity and strength
in the theme.
Of course, the real problem is
the on-camptjs housing shortage.
It is imperative that more student
housing be built, and that the
highest housing priority be
student — not emeritus — housing.
We propose to develop in
conjunction with present
committees a student housing
plan (as th e first part of a student
Land Use plan) that will articulate
student priorities to the
administration and defend these
priorities.
The situation for women at
Stanford is improving. We will do
everything possible to further this
progress.
In orc?ier to reach more women,
we will vote to appropriate funds
for a newsletter on all women's
activities;, and aid all valuable
projects by sisters at Stanford. WE
approve of the appointment of
the Assistnat Dean for Women
and will maintain this important
liaison.. We support the
Organization of Stanford Women
Athletes in its work to gain
equal ity.
The Course Review is the
beginning of real student course
evaluation, but it needs funding to
cove r more courses and to insure a
return of all student opinions.
Wit'fi a respected, comprehensive
Course Review, we can provide a
basis for eventual student input
into tenure decisions. We support
the proposals that the Economics
Department should offer a full
spf.-ctrum of academically
respected thought, and feel that
all academic departments should
b<a more receptive to student
desires for new courses.

As an ASSU senator, I would
advocate a plan creating a student
majority in the student court
system. ASSU-student body
communication would be aided
by regular reporting of ASSU
activity in the Daily and on
KZSU, and by surveys of student
sentiment on current issues. The
current housing crunch should be
eased by construction of low cost,
temporary housing, not by
assimilation of fraternities into
the draw. More thorough advising
and orientation programs are
needed for freshmen and transfer
students — it takes long enough to
figure out what goes on here as it
is.
(M. Scott Smith is an
undergraduate.)
Mike Dorsey
Maybe I'm a hopeless idealist
(as some of my friends suggest),
but I believe in the concept of
people getting together to work
for something they believe in. I
further believe in the concept of
student government: students
working together in many ways
for the benefit of the entire
student body.
Now, why me? As I stated in
my campaign literature, I believe
that I have the necessary
experience and enthusiasm to be
an effective senator. Before
coming to Stanford I served as
Associated Student Body
President for my high school
(please forgive my accidental
ommission of "high school" in
campaign literature) and, last
year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always
agree with the Council-of-
Presidents, I have confidence in
them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I
thoroughly enjoy this kind of
work, I can readily make my one
promise: to attend every meeting.
(Mike Dorsey is an
undergraduate.)
Jody Meisel
My primary concerns, aside

from the obvious need to make
the Senate into a more viable and
better publicized organization,
include the following:
1) Securing on-campus housing
for all undergraduates who desire
it.
2) Making public hearings a
continued part of the University's
decision-making process.
3) Seeking increased financial
aid and better part-time jobs,
including the placement of
undergraduates in jobs related to
their studies.
4) Improving the present
advisor system.
My experience includes
working with educational
administrators and elected
officials of the Los Angeles Board
of Education, both on a city-wide
student committee and later as a
full-time employee.
(Jody Meisal is an undergraduate
majoring in history.)
Pete Truex
As Stanford students, there are
some problems that we should try
to solve together. The current
housing shortage is of utmost
importance to everybody, and the
lack of campus social activities is
another field where there's a lot
of room for improvement. If
elected, I'll do my best to solve
these and other problems that
face us here at Stanford. I'm
willing to work for you.
(Pete Truex is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Beth Wood
This is my first year at
Stanford so I have not served in
any organizations on campus
previously. However, I feel that I
am well qualified for this position
as I was very active student
government during my high
school years and served as
Vice-president of my Student
Council.
As a member of several
minorities on campus — I am a
black freshwoman planning to
major in pre-law and I live in
Burbank. I feel that I would prove
successful in representing a
substancial portion of the

Stanford populace.
I am prepared to work for the
benefit of Stanford students
through the ASSU Senate right
away but first I need your vote on
October 9 and 10.
(Beth Wood is an undergraduate.)
Eleanor Lynds
I believe the Seante can work
for you, but steps should be taken
to make you more aware of what
issues are coming before the
senators. I will work to create
such interaction. I will bring an
open-minded and responsive voice
to our government, without any
commitments or obligations to
any special interest group.
The issues that will come
before the Senate are important —
the housing problem, the related
question of the future of
Fraternities, the inadequate
service provided by our current
Tresidder food service, the Pub,
and as always the selection of the
Nominations committee. The
Senate needs your opinions, and
above all, senators who are
concerned with maximizing
benefits for all students.
Support a dependable
candidate, concerned with being
an equitable voice and responsive
to you.
(Eleanor Lynds is an
undergraduate majoring in art
history.)
Davis, Germaine, Gray,
Silton, Strnad, Sumner
Students must realize that we
are as important a part of the
Stanford community as the
faculty, administration, and staff.
The student body has the right to
have its views become an integral
part of every important decision.
We are running because we believe
that the ASSU can serve as an
effective student advocate, not
just a clearinghouse for ideas.
Alternatives in housing should
always be open to Stanford
students. Fraternities, then,
should be allowed to exist simply
to add to the diversity of the
University (not because dues and
initiation fees have bought them a
privilege). In order to comply
with Title IX, fraternities should
be allowed to be coed when they

so desire. And more importantly,
theme houses .should also become
exempt from I;he draw in order to
maintain continuity and strength
in the theme.
Of course, the real problem is
the on-camptjs housing shortage.
It is imperative that more student
housing be built, and that the
highest housing priority be
student — not emeritus — housing.
We propose to develop in
conjunction with present
committees a student housing
plan (as th e first part of a student
Land Use plan) that will articulate
student priorities to the
administration and defend these
priorities.
The situation for women at
Stanford is improving. We will do
everything possible to further this
progress.
In orc?ier to reach more women,
we will vote to appropriate funds
for a newsletter on all women's
activities;, and aid all valuable
projects by sisters at Stanford. WE
approve of the appointment of
the Assistnat Dean for Women
and will maintain this important
liaison.. We support the
Organization of Stanford Women
Athletes in its work to gain
equal ity.
The Course Review is the
beginning of real student course
evaluation, but it needs funding to
cove r more courses and to insure a
return of all student opinions.
Wit'fi a respected, comprehensive
Course Review, we can provide a
basis for eventual student input
into tenure decisions. We support
the proposals that the Economics
Department should offer a full
spf.-ctrum of academically
respected thought, and feel that
all academic departments should
b<a more receptive to student
desires for new courses.

Germane, Chris Gray, Debbi

Krohn, Sobotka
In talking with many of our
friends before deciding to run for
seats in the ASSU Senate, we
began to realize that perhaps our
finest qualification for office lay
in our lack of commitment to the
established ASSU hierarchy. We
have noted consistently the
growing pre-occupation of the
ASSU with its organizational
structure, leading to extended
discussion of ornamental issues.
We have similarly noted the
disappearance of the ASSU Senate
as an open forum for the candid
airing of real questions facing the
Stanford community.
We have witnessed the
unfortunate lack of student input
in major University decisions.
Notable shortcomings have
included: student housing
(student placement,
determination of independent
status, Resident Fellow and RA
selection), food service (Why is
there a 40 percent overhead?),
academic direction and the
granting of professorial tenure,
and the administration's
misguided priorities. The list of
very real issues yet to be acted
upon will continue to grow as
long as the Senate closes its mind
and ears. We will listen, and we
will act.

Ruben Sanchez
An understanding of the
responsibilities of a student
senator begins with the
recognition that he, or she, is

there to represent. And before
this objective can be reached, a
much more prominant one must
be secured. One of understanding
Stanford University's bureaucratic
scheme. In essence, learning the
sytem, in order to work within it.
Any change, great or small,
necessitates time. As a freshman,
knowledge of such undergoings
will be profitable not only for the
present, but in future encounters,
as well.
(Ruben Sanchez is an
undergraduate.)
Bill Cortes
ASSU Senate campaigns are
typically cluttered with vague
generalizations and hollow
promises as candidates attempt to
capitalize on false issues while
sliding sideways in the face of
really controversial matters. What
is needed is a concrete approach
to problems that directly affect
students and a genuine desire to
effect productive change.
The current housing shortage,
the impending demise of the
fraternity system, the autocratic
policies regarding theme houses,
and the inadequacies of the
residence staffs as perpetrated by
the closed selection and lack of
periodic evaluation of resident
fellows and resident assistants all
point to a need for reform in the
residential education system.
Student input is also needed if
Tresidder is to resume an
improved role in serving
off-campus students and if
student services are to be
increased for transfers.
Real action can be expected
from the Senate only if candidates
with solid programs are elected.
Students should utilize one of the
few direct inputs available to
them and see that this is done.
(Bill Cortes is an undergraduate

majoring in political science.)
Brad Levin
We must study and re-evaluate
the method of administering
examinations at Stanford and the
University grading system, for I
believe that they both contain
some basic faults and
inconsistencies. I will seek the
establishment of an ASSU
committee to study the problems,
to evaluate the system, and to
come up with some workable
solutions.
I've also made a big promise to
all freshmen; not only do I intend
to keep that promise, but now I
extend it to the transfer students.
I believe that there are certain
needs and desires which are
peculiar to freshmen and transfers
and which, up until now, have
gone unrepresented. These
students need greater access
to information and a clearer
explanation of student activities
and programs, so their transition
into the new Stanford
environment will be easier. These
students need a voice, and they
must have greater representation
in all phases of student
government. Finally, these
students need more attention and
honest advice, by providing higher
housing priorities for transfers, by
involving these students in
innovative studies or programs,
and by assisting them in making
important course and career
decisions.
(Brad Levin is an undergraduate.)
Weld, Bergerac
As a result of the system by
which ASSU senators are elected,
freshmen are inadvertently
deprived of fair representation.
Despite the fact that over
one-quarter of the undergraduates
are freshmen, there were no
freshmen senators last year. The
reason for this is quite clear: The

elections are held now, freshmen
learn about the Senate later.
While we realize that
orientation takes time, in a few
weeks freshmen will be as aware
of their goals and expectations as
anyone at Stanford Yet without a
change, they will continue to go
without representation in the
ASSU senate. To alleviate this
problem we have gone out of our
way to familiarize ourselves with
the responsibilities of a senator.
We have talked to senators,
current presidents, and most
importantly to the students around
us. Having recognized what we
feel is an injustice, we have
decided to run for senatorial
positions on the platform of equal
representation.
The process of specialization,
by nature, is one that over the
years draws the individual away
from the University as a whole. As
freshmen, we have more time and
optimistic enthusiasm which we
want to apply to more than just
academic life.
(Kit Weld and Randy Bergerac are
undergraduates.)
Jeff Rowe
A University should maintain
an atmosphere of open, honest,
unprejudiced intellectual inquiry
and be at the same time dedicated
to the proposition that life is to
be enjoyed by every individual
with his own special flair.
These principles are translated
into the political realm by my
confidence in the Jeffersonian
ideal that the least government is
the best government, and that
every man should have a voice in
it. Should my voice be chosen one
of the representative few, I intend
to raise it in support of
worthwhile, practical projects of
the ASSU that benefit significant
numbers of students, and raise it

even higher against activities that
lack these virtues. Further, I
intend to push for a maintenance
of the current standard of student
life against the usurpations of
administrators who are trying to
reduce the student body to its
lowest common factor:
intellectually, politically and
socially.
(Jeff Rowe is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Reginald Turner
As chairman of the Senate this
past academic year, I have sought
to expose the student body to the
entire functions and activities of
the Senate.
I started the Senate
Communications Report, which
each senator was required to post
in an assigned area and make
himself answerable and available
to this constituency to answer
whatever questions may arise.
I further worked to establish
the two public forums which the
Senate sponsored to better
educate the community about the
emeriti housing situation and the
USE strike.
This is what I've done and if
elected more is yet to come. I
believe that further investigation
is needed into tuition increases,
ID cards, and the possibility of
establishing of a WATS line for all
students to help cut down on long
distance phone call bills.
I am also willing to study
whatever else the students feel
should be done. The Senate is
here to represent, to help and to
improve.
(Reginald Turner is an
undergraduate.)
Jim Feliciano
I am running for the ASSU
Senate with proposals not
promises. Also, I have run once
before, am currently serving on an
ASSU subcommittee, and last

year wrote a paper that has served
as a significant input in the
growing debate about a University
shuttlebus system. You are
probably waiting for some
concrete proposals and I will not
disappoint you:
1) The members of the ASSU
Nominations Committee should
be limited to serving on one
committee.
2) I urge the speedy
implementation of an ASSU
notetaking service.
3) I urge serious study into the
possibility of transforming
Tresidder from a poor cafeteria
into a student center including a
student store.
(Jim Feliciano is an undergraduate
majoring in philosophy.)
Kurt Hunciker
There is little understanding of
what the Senate can and cannot
do: What powers does the ASSU
Senate have? First, it has control
over $75,000 in funds for student
activities and organizations. The
ASSU can also be a focal point for
student activities and
organizations. The ASSU can't
directly increase the amount of
on-campus housing or reform the
curriculum. But, the Senate can
gain significant inroads into the
making of University policy by
hard work and vigorous lobbying.
This implies both passing
resolutions and following them up
by strongly presenting them to
administrators.
The Senate should lobby for
Residential Colleges. A perfect
opportunity exists to
concurrently design the
educational program and the
facilities available for a residential
college in the newly proposed row
houses. Finally, the class note
service and student co-op, both
proposed by the Council of
Presidents, should be

implemented.
(Kurt Hunciker is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics and political science.)
Ira Rubin
I have a sincere desire to help
the University, which has
contributed so much to me
academically, yet proven deficient
in so many other aspects of
college life.
The housing issue is important
to me (as one who has previously
arrived in the fall unassigned and
despairing). I am also concerned
with the future of the overseas
study program and feel I could
benefit the Senate in this respect.
There is one area of concern
which I feel is extremely lacking
at Stanford. With the except of
Fred Hargadon's "personal" letter
of congratuations upon admission
I believe the University is grossly
deficient in communicating with
its students on any but a mass
basis.
(Ira Rubin is an undergraduate
majoring in political science and
communication.)
Tim Coqway
I am running for the ASSU
Senate to express my views and
take an active role in such
problems as the housing shortage
and the lack of cohesive social
activities for the students.
If elected I will:
1) Attend the bi-weekly
meetings of the Senate.
2) Actively seek the opinions
of other students.
3) Consider these opinions and
decide as I see fit.
Vote on Thursday. If you don't
vote, don't gripe!
(Tim Conway is an undergraduate
majoring in chemistry.)
Mark Pigott
I am running for the Senate.
(Mark Pigott is an undergraduate.)
The following are statements by
candidates for ASSU Senate in
Wednesday's and Thursday's
elections. More statements were
published yesterday.
Mary Ann Toman
The housing draw issue is of
major concern, thus I propose to
concentrate on this and other
student services including
implementation of the proposed
Record Co-op. As a member of
the Record Co-op Committee, I
have already gathered information
and have helped to initiate action.
As for the Pub, I was a member of
the Tresidder Union Committee,
so I was able to gain insight into
the operations of the University,
and especially, those problems
holding up the Pub.
Initiative is necessary for both
senators and students. I have
personally contacted Dr.
Mc Clennahan of the Health and
Safety Committee about the
dangerous biking conditions that
exist on parts of the new Campus
Drive close to the Row. I have
proposed two-way asphalt bike
pathways next to he sidewalks.
Immediate action is necessary. I
have taken the first step.
(Mary Ann Toman is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics.)
Jan Pepper
Much work is facing the ASSU
Senate in the area of student
services. An improved Tresidder
food service, a pub, partly
financed by the excess profits of
the Coffee House or Tresidder,
and safer conditions for bicycles
are a few examples.
The Senate also has the
responsibility of appointing
competent and dedicated students
to serve on University committees
in order to assume that the
student view will be an important
factor in administrative decisions.
Plans for future student housing,
particularly, should be approved
by students in terms of placement
on campus and architectural
design.
(Jan Pepper is an undergraduate
majoring in civil engineering.)

M. Scott Smith
As an ASSU senator, I would

year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always

them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I

freshmen, we have more time and
optimistic enthusiasm which we
want to apply to more than just
academic life.

Jeff Rowe
A University should maintain
an atmosphere of open, honest,
unprejudiced intellectual inquiry
and be at the same time dedicated
to the proposition that life is to
be enjoyed by every individual
with his own special flair.
These principles are translated
into the political realm by my
confidence in the Jeffersonian
ideal that the least government is
the best government, and that
every man should have a voice in
it. Should my voice be chosen one
of the representative few, I intend
to raise it in support of
worthwhile, practical projects of
the ASSU that benefit significant
numbers of students, and raise it

even higher against activities that
lack these virtues. Further, I
intend to push for a maintenance
of the current standard of student
life against the usurpations of
administrators who are trying to
reduce the student body to its
lowest common factor:
intellectually, politically and
socially.

Reginald Turner
As chairman of the Senate this
past academic year, I have sought
to expose the student body to the
entire functions and activities of
the Senate.
I started the Senate
Communications Report, which
each senator was required to post
in an assigned area and make
himself answerable and available
to this constituency to answer
whatever questions may arise.
I further worked to establish
the two public forums which the
Senate sponsored to better
educate the community about the
emeriti housing situation and the
USE strike.
This is what I've done and if
elected more is yet to come. I
believe that further investigation
is needed into tuition increases,
ID cards, and the possibility of
establishing of a WATS line for all
students to help cut down on long
distance phone call bills.
I am also willing to study
whatever else the students feel
should be done. The Senate is
here to represent, to help and to
improve.

Jim Feliciano
I am running for the ASSU
Senate with proposals not
promises. Also, I have run once
before, am currently serving on an
ASSU subcommittee, and last

year wrote a paper that has served
as a significant input in the
growing debate about a University
shuttlebus system. You are
probably waiting for some
concrete proposals and I will not
disappoint you:
1) The members of the ASSU
Nominations Committee should
be limited to serving on one
committee.
2) I urge the speedy
implementation of an ASSU
notetaking service.
3) I urge serious study into the
possibility of transforming
Tresidder from a poor cafeteria
into a student center including a
student store.

Kurt Hunciker
There is little understanding of
what the Senate can and cannot
do: What powers does the ASSU
Senate have? First, it has control
over $75,000 in funds for student
activities and organizations. The
ASSU can also be a focal point for
student activities and
organizations. The ASSU can't
directly increase the amount of
on-campus housing or reform the
curriculum. But, the Senate can
gain significant inroads into the
making of University policy by
hard work and vigorous lobbying.
This implies both passing
resolutions and following them up
by strongly presenting them to
administrators.
The Senate should lobby for
Residential Colleges. A perfect
opportunity exists to
concurrently design the
educational program and the
facilities available for a residential
college in the newly proposed row
houses. Finally, the class note
service and student co-op, both
proposed by the Council of
Presidents, should be

implemented.

Ira Rubin
I have a sincere desire to help
the University, which has
contributed so much to me
academically, yet proven deficient
in so many other aspects of
college life.
The housing issue is important
to me (as one who has previously
arrived in the fall unassigned and
despairing). I am also concerned
with the future of the overseas
study program and feel I could
benefit the Senate in this respect.
There is one area of concern
which I feel is extremely lacking
at Stanford. With the except of
Fred Hargadon's "personal" letter
of congratuations upon admission
I believe the University is grossly
deficient in communicating with
its students on any but a mass
basis.
(Ira Rubin is an undergraduate
majoring in political science and

Tim Coqway
I am running for the ASSU
Senate to express my views and
take an active role in such
problems as the housing shortage
and the lack of cohesive social
activities for the students.
If elected I will:
1) Attend the bi-weekly
meetings of the Senate.
2) Actively seek the opinions
of other students.
3) Consider these opinions and
decide as I see fit.
Vote on Thursday. If you don't
vote, don't gripe!
(Tim Conway is an undergraduate
majoring in chemistry.)
Mark Pigott
I am running for the Senate.
