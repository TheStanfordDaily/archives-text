# Senatorial Candidates Announce Platforms
## 
### 
The following are statements by
candidates for ASSU Senate in
Wednesday's and Thursday's
elections. More statements were
published yesterday.
Mary Ann Toman
The housing draw issue is of
major concern, thus I propose to
concentrate on this and other
student services including
implementation of the proposed
Record Co-op. As a member of
the Record Co-op Committee, I
have already gathered information
and have helped to initiate action.
As for the Pub, I was a member of
the Tresidder Union Committee,
so I was able to gain insight into
the operations of the University,
and especially, those problems
holding up the Pub.
Initiative is necessary for both
senators and students. I have
personally contacted Dr.
Mc Clennahan of the Health and
Safety Committee about the
dangerous biking conditions that
exist on parts of the new Campus
Drive close to the Row. I have
proposed two-way asphalt bike
pathways next to he sidewalks.
Immediate action is necessary. I
have taken the first step.
(Mary Ann Toman is an
undergraduate majoring in
economics.)
Jan Pepper
Much work is facing the ASSU
Senate in the area of student
services. An improved Tresidder
food service, a pub, partly
financed by the excess profits of
the Coffee House or Tresidder,
and safer conditions for bicycles
are a few examples.
The Senate also has the
responsibility of appointing
competent and dedicated students
to serve on University committees
in order to assume that the
student view will be an important
factor in administrative decisions.
Plans for future student housing,
particularly, should be approved
by students in terms of placement
on campus and architectural
design.
(Jan Pepper is an undergraduate
majoring in civil engineering.)

M. Scott Smith
As an ASSU senator, I would
advocate a plan creating a student
majority in the student court
system. ASSU-student body
communication would be aided
by regular reporting of ASSU
activity in the Daily and on
KZSU, and by surveys of student
sentiment on current issues. The
current housing crunch should be
eased by construction of low cost,
temporary housing, not by
assimilation of fraternities into
the draw. More thorough advising
and orientation programs are
needed for freshmen and transfer
students — it takes long enough to
figure out what goes on here as it
is.
(M. Scott Smith is an
undergraduate.)
Mike Dorsey
Maybe I'm a hopeless idealist
(as some of my friends suggest),
but I believe in the concept of
people getting together to work
for something they believe in. I
further believe in the concept of
student government: students
working together in many ways
for the benefit of the entire
student body.
Now, why me? As I stated in
my campaign literature, I believe
that I have the necessary
experience and enthusiasm to be
an effective senator. Before
coming to Stanford I served as
Associated Student Body
President for my high school
(please forgive my accidental
ommission of "high school" in
campaign literature) and, last
year, my freshman year, I served
as an ASSU representative on the
University's student-faculty
Committee on Health and Safety.
Although I don't expect to always
agree with the Council-of-
Presidents, I have confidence in
them and look forward to
working with them. Finally, as I
thoroughly enjoy this kind of
work, I can readily make my one
promise: to attend every meeting.
(Mike Dorsey is an
undergraduate.)
Jody Meisel
My primary concerns, aside

from the obvious need to make
the Senate into a more viable and
better publicized organization,
include the following:
1) Securing on-campus housing
for all undergraduates who desire
it.
2) Making public hearings a
continued part of the University's
decision-making process.
3) Seeking increased financial
aid and better part-time jobs,
including the placement of
undergraduates in jobs related to
their studies.
4) Improving the present
advisor system.
My experience includes
working with educational
administrators and elected
officials of the Los Angeles Board
of Education, both on a city-wide
student committee and later as a
full-time employee.
(Jody Meisal is an undergraduate
majoring in history.)
Pete Truex
As Stanford students, there are
some problems that we should try
to solve together. The current
housing shortage is of utmost
importance to everybody, and the
lack of campus social activities is
another field where there's a lot
of room for improvement. If
elected, I'll do my best to solve
these and other problems that
face us here at Stanford. I'm
willing to work for you.
(Pete Truex is an undergraduate
majoring in economics.)
Beth Wood
This is my first year at
Stanford so I have not served in
any organizations on campus
previously. However, I feel that I
am well qualified for this position
as I was very active student
government during my high
school years and served as
Vice-president of my Student
Council.
As a member of several
minorities on campus — I am a
black freshwoman planning to
major in pre-law and I live in
Burbank. I feel that I would prove
successful in representing a
substancial portion of the

Stanford populace.
I am prepared to work for the
benefit of Stanford students
through the ASSU Senate right
away but first I need your vote on
October 9 and 10.
(Beth Wood is an undergraduate.)
Eleanor Lynds
I believe the Seante can work
for you, but steps should be taken
to make you more aware of what
issues are coming before the
senators. I will work to create
such interaction. I will bring an
open-minded and responsive voice
to our government, without any
commitments or obligations to
any special interest group.
The issues that will come
before the Senate are important —
the housing problem, the related
question of the future of
Fraternities, the inadequate
service provided by our current
Tresidder food service, the Pub,
and as always the selection of the
Nominations committee. The
Senate needs your opinions, and
above all, senators who are
concerned with maximizing
benefits for all students.
Support a dependable
candidate, concerned with being
an equitable voice and responsive
to you.
(Eleanor Lynds is an
undergraduate majoring in art
history.)
Davis, Germaine, Gray,
Silton, Strnad, Sumner
Students must realize that we
are as important a part of the
Stanford community as the
faculty, administration, and staff.
The student body has the right to
have its views become an integral
part of every important decision.
We are running because we believe
that the ASSU can serve as an
effective student advocate, not
just a clearinghouse for ideas.
Alternatives in housing should
always be open to Stanford
students. Fraternities, then,
should be allowed to exist simply
to add to the diversity of the
University (not because dues and
initiation fees have bought them a
privilege). In order to comply
with Title IX, fraternities should
be allowed to be coed when they

so desire. And more importantly,
theme houses .should also become
exempt from I;he draw in order to
maintain continuity and strength
in the theme.
Of course, the real problem is
the on-camptjs housing shortage.
It is imperative that more student
housing be built, and that the
highest housing priority be
student — not emeritus — housing.
We propose to develop in
conjunction with present
committees a student housing
plan (as th e first part of a student
Land Use plan) that will articulate
student priorities to the
administration and defend these
priorities.
The situation for women at
Stanford is improving. We will do
everything possible to further this
progress.
In orc?ier to reach more women,
we will vote to appropriate funds
for a newsletter on all women's
activities;, and aid all valuable
projects by sisters at Stanford. WE
approve of the appointment of
the Assistnat Dean for Women
and will maintain this important
liaison.. We support the
Organization of Stanford Women
Athletes in its work to gain
equal ity.
The Course Review is the
beginning of real student course
evaluation, but it needs funding to
cove r more courses and to insure a
return of all student opinions.
Wit'fi a respected, comprehensive
Course Review, we can provide a
basis for eventual student input
into tenure decisions. We support
the proposals that the Economics
Department should offer a full
spf.-ctrum of academically
respected thought, and feel that
all academic departments should
b<a more receptive to student
desires for new courses.
(Cynthia Davis, Charlotte
Germane, Chris Gray, Debbi
Hilton, Lyse Strnad, and Mike
Sumner are all undergraduates.)
Janeway, Max
We will work to provide
government responsive to the
attitudes and needs of the
Stanford Student Body.
(Kate Janeway is an
