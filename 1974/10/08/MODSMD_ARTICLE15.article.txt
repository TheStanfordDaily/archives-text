# Housing Construction Tops Trustees' Agenda
## 
### 
The recommendation for
construction of three new Row
Houses and a report by President
Richard W Lyman on the
University's long-range financial
outlook are among the items on
the agenda for today's Board of
Trustees meeting in San
Francisco.
The Committee on Academic
Affairs will recommend to the
other committees that they take
appropriate action to accomplish
Stage 1 of the housing

recommendation (the
construction of three new Row
Houses to accommodate 150
more students).
University officials declined to
make any prediction on how the
board would vote, although Dean
of Student Affairs Jim Lyons said,
"We're certainly hopeful that we'll
get approval."
Larry Horton, associate dean
of student affairs, agreed that
they "would not want to prejudge"
the board's decision. "The merits
of the case must speak for itself,"
said Horton. "I think the merits
of this one are pretty good."
The actions needed to carry
out Stage 1 will probably be
discussed at the November board
meeting, according to Fred
Glover, secretary to the
University.
