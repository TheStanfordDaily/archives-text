## P.H. Jazz Band: 'Pure Good Times' 
### STEPHEN WALT 
After the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band's concert last Friday
night it appears that reports of
any generation gap have been
greatly exaggerated. Playing their
second school-year concert at
Stanford, this group of
supposedly "old" musicians,
whose average age is
approximately 65, reaffirmed the
universal appeal of well-played
New Orleans jazz and gave the
capacity crowd at Memorial
Auditorium two solid hours of
pure good times.
In an era where costuming and
pretentious showmanship tend to
dominate the concert scene,
Preservation Hall provides a
refreshing change. Wearing white
shirts and black ties, sitting in
straight backed wooden chairs on
a baie stage, their simplicity
becomes the keynote of the
evening, with nothing to dilute
the purity of the music.
The music itself deserves no
dilution. Despite the recent deaths
of co-leaders Billie and Dede
Pierce the band continues its
tradition of musical spontaneity
and professional excellence.
They began with just a trio. Cie
Franzier on drums, Sing Miller on

piano and Percy Humphrey on
trumpet. From stage left entered
Willie Humphrey, weaving and
blowing some hot clarinet licks
that produced a spontaneous
burst of applause from the
audience.
Then from the opposite side of
the stage strutted "Big Jim"
Robinson, the 84 year old wonder
whose entrance sparked the
loudest cheers of all. They
finished the number and were
then joined by Allan Jaffe, tuba,
and Frank Dumon, banjo.
New Orleans' jazz rests heavily
on the interplay between the
three lead instruments, and in
this, Preservation Hall is
unmatched. Percy Humphrey's
trumpet carries the main melody,
generally unadorned, while
brother Willie dances an
incredibly lively clarinet around
the lines.
In addition, Willie produced
the most inspired solos of the
evening. His solo work is
consistently inventive, and
features long runs of exceptional
speed and clarity as well as some
awesome high notes.
Robinson's trombone handles
harmony and provides accents and
some timely sliding. Within this
structure each is free to stretch
out a little, giving the music its
vitality.
Credit must also be given to
drummer Cie Franzier. As one of
the last traditional New Orleans
drummers still performing, his
style is a masterpiece of simplicity
with inspiration. He consistently
punctuated melodic exchanges
with deft rim shots and his solos
featured a variety of sounds and
rapid rolls.
The rhythm section of Frazier,
tubist Allan Jaffe, and Frank
Dumon on banjo are primarily
responsible for the rhythmic
"swing" which gives Preservation

Hall's music its infectious quality.
But a Preservation Hall concert
is something more than just a
demonstration of exemplary
musicianship. It is an almost
undefinable atmosphere of joy
and life that these men
communicate.
Octogenarian Robinson would
tap his feet, clap and rise up to
dance, and the crowd would
immediately respond by clapping
in time with the music, whistling
and cheering for more. "Big Jim"
is certainly the liveliest 84 year
old currently performing.
The concert was divided in two
halves, with a 15-20 minute

intermission. Pacing was excellent
throughout both sets, with hot
footstompers like "Tiger Rag"
being balanced by slow dreamy
ballads and gentle gospel like
"Amen" and "This Little Light of
Mine."
While the faster numbers
probably receive more attention,
the slow songs are worthy of
particular notice. The
predominant image I visualize in a
Preservation Hall ballad is that of
a happy partier weaving slowly
home to bed. This provides a great
contrast to the contrast to the
jumping tunes normally associated
with New Orleans Jazz.

At the finish the crowd
immediately rose in a thundering
standing ovation, bringing them
back for their traditional encore,
"When the Saints Go Marching
In." The gritty vocal was supplied
by Percy Humphrey.
By now the crowd was
thoroughly caught by their spell
and spilled out into the aisles and
eventually up on the stage,
dancing and singing. The rear
stage curtain was raised, and soon
the band was entirely surrounded
by enthusiastic young people
enjoying Southern jazz as it was
meant to be.
Who ever said anything about a
generation gap?

SOUNDS OF OLD—The Preservation Hall Jazz Band carried on the
name of New Orleans Jazz in the finest tradition last Sunday when
they played for a capacity Memorial Auditorium audience. The band's
sounds consistently had the crowd cheering and stomping throughout
the performance. The band ended their performance among a mass of
people who went on stage to dance and talk with individual members.

tradition of musical spontaneity
and professional excellence.
They began with just a trio. Cie
Franzier on drums, Sing Miller on

piano and Percy Humphrey on
trumpet. From stage left entered
Willie Humphrey, weaving and
blowing some hot clarinet licks
that produced a spontaneous
burst of applause from the
audience.
Then from the opposite side of
the stage strutted "Big Jim"
Robinson, the 84 year old wonder
whose entrance sparked the
loudest cheers of all. They
finished the number and were
then joined by Allan Jaffe, tuba,
and Frank Dumon, banjo.
New Orleans' jazz rests heavily
on the interplay between the
three lead instruments, and in
this, Preservation Hall is
unmatched. Percy Humphrey's
trumpet carries the main melody,
generally unadorned, while
brother Willie dances an
incredibly lively clarinet around
the lines.
In addition, Willie produced
the most inspired solos of the
evening. His solo work is
consistently inventive, and
features long runs of exceptional
speed and clarity as well as some
awesome high notes.
Robinson's trombone handles
harmony and provides accents and
some timely sliding. Within this
structure each is free to stretch
out a little, giving the music its
vitality.
Credit must also be given to
drummer Cie Franzier. As one of
the last traditional New Orleans
drummers still performing, his
style is a masterpiece of simplicity
with inspiration. He consistently
punctuated melodic exchanges
with deft rim shots and his solos
featured a variety of sounds and
rapid rolls.
The rhythm section of Frazier,
tubist Allan Jaffe, and Frank
Dumon on banjo are primarily
responsible for the rhythmic
"swing" which gives Preservation

Hall's music its infectious quality.
But a Preservation Hall concert
is something more than just a
demonstration of exemplary
musicianship. It is an almost
undefinable atmosphere of joy
and life that these men
communicate.
Octogenarian Robinson would
tap his feet, clap and rise up to
dance, and the crowd would
immediately respond by clapping
in time with the music, whistling
and cheering for more. "Big Jim"
is certainly the liveliest 84 year
old currently performing.
The concert was divided in two
halves, with a 15-20 minute

intermission. Pacing was excellent
throughout both sets, with hot
footstompers like "Tiger Rag"
being balanced by slow dreamy
ballads and gentle gospel like
"Amen" and "This Little Light of
Mine."
While the faster numbers
probably receive more attention,
the slow songs are worthy of
particular notice. The
predominant image I visualize in a
Preservation Hall ballad is that of
a happy partier weaving slowly
home to bed. This provides a great
contrast to the contrast to the
jumping tunes normally associated
with New Orleans Jazz.

At the finish the crowd
immediately rose in a thundering
standing ovation, bringing them
back for their traditional encore,
"When the Saints Go Marching
In." The gritty vocal was supplied
by Percy Humphrey.
By now the crowd was
thoroughly caught by their spell
and spilled out into the aisles and
eventually up on the stage,
dancing and singing. The rear
stage curtain was raised, and soon
the band was entirely surrounded
by enthusiastic young people
enjoying Southern jazz as it was
meant to be.
Who ever said anything about a

SOUNDS OF OLD—The Preservation Hall Jazz Band carried on the
name of New Orleans Jazz in the finest tradition last Sunday when
they played for a capacity Memorial Auditorium audience. The band's
sounds consistently had the crowd cheering and stomping throughout
the performance. The band ended their performance among a mass of
people who went on stage to dance and talk with individual members.

SOLOISTS RETURN—The New York Chamber Soloists return to Stanford tonight as part of the Office
of Public Events Lively Arts season. The Soloists, who are returning after a year's absence from the
mid-peninsula, will be performing tonight at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Their repertoire covers
more than 250 works, with many compositions written especially for them. The group features oboist
Melvin Kaplan, tenor Charles Bressler, harpsichordist Harriet Wingreen, and other top caliber players.
Tickets for the show are priced at $2.75 for students, all others $4.75.
After the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band's concert last Friday
night it appears that reports of
any generation gap have been
greatly exaggerated. Playing their
second school-year concert at
Stanford, this group of
supposedly "old" musicians,
whose average age is
approximately 65, reaffirmed the
universal appeal of well-played
New Orleans jazz and gave the
capacity crowd at Memorial
Auditorium two solid hours of
pure good times.
In an era where costuming and
pretentious showmanship tend to
dominate the concert scene,
Preservation Hall provides a
refreshing change. Wearing white
shirts and black ties, sitting in
straight backed wooden chairs on
a baie stage, their simplicity
becomes the keynote of the
evening, with nothing to dilute
the purity of the music.
The music itself deserves no
dilution. Despite the recent deaths
of co-leaders Billie and Dede
Pierce the band continues its
tradition of musical spontaneity
and professional excellence.

evening. His solo work is
consistently inventive, and
features long runs of exceptional
speed and clarity as well as some
awesome high notes.
Robinson's trombone handles
harmony and provides accents and
some timely sliding. Within this
structure each is free to stretch
out a little, giving the music its
vitality.
Credit must also be given to
drummer Cie Franzier. As one of
the last traditional New Orleans
drummers still performing, his
style is a masterpiece of simplicity
with inspiration. He consistently
punctuated melodic exchanges
with deft rim shots and his solos
featured a variety of sounds and
rapid rolls.
The rhythm section of Frazier,
tubist Allan Jaffe, and Frank
Dumon on banjo are primarily
responsible for the rhythmic
"swing" which gives Preservation

Hall's music its infectious quality.
But a Preservation Hall concert
is something more than just a
demonstration of exemplary
musicianship. It is an almost
undefinable atmosphere of joy
and life that these men
communicate.
Octogenarian Robinson would
tap his feet, clap and rise up to
dance, and the crowd would
immediately respond by clapping
in time with the music, whistling
and cheering for more. "Big Jim"
is certainly the liveliest 84 year
old currently performing.
The concert was divided in two
halves, with a 15-20 minute

intermission. Pacing was excellent
throughout both sets, with hot
footstompers like "Tiger Rag"
being balanced by slow dreamy
ballads and gentle gospel like
"Amen" and "This Little Light of
Mine."
While the faster numbers
probably receive more attention,
the slow songs are worthy of
particular notice. The
predominant image I visualize in a
Preservation Hall ballad is that of
a happy partier weaving slowly
home to bed. This provides a great
contrast to the contrast to the
jumping tunes normally associated
with New Orleans Jazz.

At the finish the crowd
immediately rose in a thundering
standing ovation, bringing them
back for their traditional encore,
"When the Saints Go Marching
In." The gritty vocal was supplied
by Percy Humphrey.
By now the crowd was
thoroughly caught by their spell
and spilled out into the aisles and
eventually up on the stage,
dancing and singing. The rear
stage curtain was raised, and soon
the band was entirely surrounded
by enthusiastic young people
enjoying Southern jazz as it was
meant to be.
Who ever said anything about a
generation gap?

SOUNDS OF OLD—The Preservation Hall Jazz Band carried on the
name of New Orleans Jazz in the finest tradition last Sunday when
they played for a capacity Memorial Auditorium audience. The band's
sounds consistently had the crowd cheering and stomping throughout
the performance. The band ended their performance among a mass of
people who went on stage to dance and talk with individual members.

SOLOISTS RETURN—The New York Chamber Soloists return to Stanford tonight as part of the Office
of Public Events Lively Arts season. The Soloists, who are returning after a year's absence from the
mid-peninsula, will be performing tonight at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Their repertoire covers
more than 250 works, with many compositions written especially for them. The group features oboist
Melvin Kaplan, tenor Charles Bressler, harpsichordist Harriet Wingreen, and other top caliber players.
Tickets for the show are priced at $2.75 for students, all others $4.75.
After the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band's concert last Friday
night it appears that reports of
any generation gap have been
greatly exaggerated. Playing their
second school-year concert at
Stanford, this group of
supposedly "old" musicians,
whose average age is
approximately 65, reaffirmed the
universal appeal of well-played
New Orleans jazz and gave the
capacity crowd at Memorial
Auditorium two solid hours of
pure good times.
In an era where costuming and
pretentious showmanship tend to
dominate the concert scene,
Preservation Hall provides a
refreshing change. Wearing white
shirts and black ties, sitting in
straight backed wooden chairs on
a baie stage, their simplicity
becomes the keynote of the
evening, with nothing to dilute
the purity of the music.
The music itself deserves no
dilution. Despite the recent deaths
of co-leaders Billie and Dede
Pierce the band continues its
tradition of musical spontaneity
and professional excellence.
They began with just a trio. Cie
Franzier on drums, Sing Miller on

piano and Percy Humphrey on
trumpet. From stage left entered
Willie Humphrey, weaving and
blowing some hot clarinet licks
that produced a spontaneous
burst of applause from the
audience.
Then from the opposite side of
the stage strutted "Big Jim"
Robinson, the 84 year old wonder
whose entrance sparked the
loudest cheers of all. They
finished the number and were
then joined by Allan Jaffe, tuba,
and Frank Dumon, banjo.
New Orleans' jazz rests heavily
on the interplay between the
three lead instruments, and in
this, Preservation Hall is
unmatched. Percy Humphrey's
trumpet carries the main melody,
generally unadorned, while
brother Willie dances an
incredibly lively clarinet around
the lines.

the most inspired solos of the
evening. His solo work is
consistently inventive, and

speed and clarity as well as some
