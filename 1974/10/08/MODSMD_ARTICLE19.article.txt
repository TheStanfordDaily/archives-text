## 'Nightstalker': Show Bites It 
### George Dobbins 
First, look in places of the dead. Equip yourself
with white candles, salt, needles and thread. Pour
salt in the mouth of your victim and sew the lips
tightly together. Then light the candles and place
them around the body.
That, dear friends, according to a program called
The Nightstalker, is how to kill a zombie. Indeed, it
must also be the method used to locate this show's
writers.
Not that one must be strange to work on this
series, but it certainly helps. Already The
Nightstalker has earned the Emmy for the weirdest
program of the season.
The plots (don't say plot to a dead person!) do
very definitely deal with dead people — creatures
risen from the grave, Jack the Ripper reincarnated
and all kinds of vampires, girl vampires, guy
vampires, you name the vampire.
A crude comparison between vampires and this
show is that vampires suck blood while The
Nightstalker simply — well, you get the idea. Just
like on the old Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,
the question here is: Which monster will it be this
week?
Perhaps the worst monster is the star of the
show, Darren McGavin. McGavin is generally an
energetic, convincing actor but in the season that
gives us Kodiak, Kojak and, in this series, Carl
Kolshak, McGavin got the bad end of the shtick.
Kolshak works for the Independent News Service.
Carrying a camera and tape recorder and clad in a
hat and white suit out of the thirties, he sees his job
as investigating the occult. This is fine, but his lines
are taking him right into the coffin. Right now,
we'd rather hear him coughin!
In the style of David Ross on McGavin's
previous Outsider series, Kolshak also narrates to
the viewer as the story progresses. The words
couldn't be any cornier: Of a woman who had a
flat tire, he says, "She cursed. She had no idea how
cursed her evening was."
To a woman who mistakes him for a termite
inspector, he comments, "Late I am but termite
inspector I am not although I have been known to
bug a few people." Yes — like everyone viewing the
show.
Kolshak is always in trouble with the law. One
detective perceptively tells him, "One of the
reasons I went into police work was to meet
interesting people. But you're not interesting.
You're just idiotic."
Another threatens, "If you continue to look
into this situation, you're going to find yourself
pounding a typewriter with casts up to your
shoulders." If only this show had a cast.

The only other series regular is Simon Oakland,
Kolshak's editor, who is basically recreating the
hard-nosed role he had on the now defunct Toma
series.
Kolshak aptly describes the editor as one who
would "turn Buddah into a chain smoker."
Oakland's lines are always different but their gyst is
the same: "What did he do? No, don't tell me the
consequences, just what did he do?" If only
someone could tell us — what does Oakland do for
this show?
In a recent interview, McGavin said the show
should not be taken seriously in any way. Why he
thinks anyone would do so is beyond us.
As TV Guide recently stated, the plots are to be
"taken with a grain of salt — and maybe a bag of
garlic." Not only are the characterizations
stereotyped; they are almost right out of Batman.
As Bob Wilkins once said about Creature Features,
"We believe in hiring the handicapped, but why do
they all have to work on this show?"
The dialogue is disgraceful. On a recent episode,
a gangster threatened as follows: "One of my
people gets knocked off, there's going to be
cocoanut milk all over the place." Apparently the
writers are drinking something more potent.
In the course of a typical plot, Kolshak plods
about in the manner of Columbo, puts facts
together and eventually cannot write a story either
because no one will let him or no evidence exists.
After a while, this becomes monotonous.
The plots have very little coherence. In the
episode, "The Vampire," about a vampire who also
worked as a prostitute (no comment), the scenes
took us from vampires to garages to transcendental
meditation to Kolshak's romantic life.
Although at times amusing, most of the humor
was silly. The highlight of the evening involved
Kolshak putting an electric shaver to a telephone so
that he didn't have to talk to his editor. Ha! Ha!
After watching this episode along with three
others and the pilot film (which was the best of the
lot), we are forced to agree with what Kolshak
stated upon leaving an interview: "A minute passed
and I felt no ill effects. I just felt stupid."
The Nightstalker is aptly titled. It pertains to
the chief writer of this show, who very shortly will
spend every waking hour looking for work.
And he, in a manner different from Kolshak,
will no doubt purposefully destroy all evidence that
this show, his creation, ever rose from the grave to
which it has returned.
The Nightstalker can be seen Fridays at 10 p.m. on
ABC (Channel 7).
