# Effects Of Diet, Drugs Studied
## Doctors Scrutinize Heart Disease

Proper diet and drugs could reduce the chances that the
nation's leading killer wilil strike, Stanford researchers say.
The Stanford Heart Disease Prevention Program has
teamed with the National Heart and Lung Institute to
research the two factors' effects on men with abnormally
high blood cholesterol level s, a symptom of heart failure.
Scientists have proven "beyond all reasonable doubt that
men with high levels of bio od cholesterol have an increased
risk of developing heart disoase," according to Dr. Michael
Stern, assistant professor (>f endocrinology at the Medical
Center and director of the Coronary Prevention Program.
"What is still not known, however, is whether or not
lowering the blood cholesi l ,erol-*ither through diet or
drugsâ€”will reduce this risk," Stern said.
Faculty and staff personnel are among the participants
in the program, which includes men between 35 and 59
with blood cholesterol levels of 275 milligrams or more per
100 milliliters of blood.
Stern estimated that between 50 and 60 men have been
given blood tests under the "Prevalence Study" to
determine the "frequency of abnormal cholesterol levels
and other related abnormalities," Stern said.
After the blood test, a dietiician counsels the patients on
ways to reduce their cholesterol count. The dietician tells
participants to limit their intake of animal fats, butter and
egg yolks. Patients also are encouraged to eat
polyunsaturated fats, whole gn in and fibrous foods such as
raw vegetables - all anti-cholesterol foods.
The local study is part of the nationwide program begun
last year to research the effects of lowered cholesterol levels
in the prime heart attack group.
Stern said the National Coronary Prevention Study
researches more "long-term" im plications in the treatment
of high cholesterol blood levels.
Stern and his staff check cholesterol levels in 400 men

each week while accepting only 20 further tests, he said.
Possible danger to the volunteers and lack of response to
preliminary tests are reasons for the high rejection rate.
Participants are studied for seven years and are split into
two sections: those taking a low cholesterol diet and
potent cholesterol-lowering drug and those
taking the same diet and placebo.
"Neither the clinic staff nor the participant will know
which treatment category a particular individual has been
assigned to," Stem said. "This information will be held by a
central date monitoring board."
After assignment of the patient to treatment, the clinic
doctor checks him at two-month intervals. The physician
measures cholesterol values at each visit.
The difference between the two groups in the incidence
of sudden death, development of heart disease and heart
attacks will determine the results of the study.
"This program offers to men who are at high risk of
developing coronary heart disease preventive treatment at
no cost," Stern said.
