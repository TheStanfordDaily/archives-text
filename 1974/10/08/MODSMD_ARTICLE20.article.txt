# With Mimi Farina At Frost
## Joan Baez Blends Politics, Music, Style 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
"Well, it's another miserable
cloudy day here in old Frost."
With that characteristic bit of
shy sarcasm, Joan Baez greeted a
full house in Frost Amphitheater
Sunday, kicking off her portion of
what is becoming an annual
campus event.
Preceded by her sister Mimi
Farina's weak but possible vocal
talents, Baez took the stage with a
presence that is some kind of
crazy cross between Gandhi and
Mae West. She began her set with
the '50s tune "Earth Angel,"
admonishing all the photographers
in the crowd to take their pictures
during that song and then sit
down.
"I've seen that shot a million
times; you're only gonna get my
chin," she advised the shutterbugs
zooming in from the orchestra pit.
"Right into the sun," she
scolded. "Real smart, huh? That's
Stanford."
She then began an Elvis Presley
imitation, "Honey Love," which
made the crowd roar. Baez, the
elegant figure in the long
burgundy gown, wisely spent the
first moments of her set putting
the audience at ease rather than
opening her attack with the
expected rhetoric of political
protest.

Baez's third song, "Blessed
Are," and the following number,
"Forever Young," calmed the
suntanned crowd and began to set
it up for the seriousness to
come, a recounting of Baez's
recent experiences on tour in
South America.
"It's worth going down for an
education," Baez explained. "I
advise you to cut your hair real
short." In contrast to the very
serious subject matter—a political
assasination every 19 hours in
Argentina, talk everywhere of
"when the revolution
starts"—Baez remains half-joking,
ironically telling her tale with
smiles and giggles and an easy
manner.
Obviously her political
opponents' absurdities amuse her,
and Baez's sense of humor in the
face of the atrocities she sees
around her gives a better chance
to communicate to an audience
than a more heavy-handed
approach would afford.
Still, the seriousness comes
through the lyrics of songs like
"Winds Of The Old Days,"
written in reply to reporters who
asked Baez for her opinion on
Bob Dylan's tour last spring.
Ghosts of my history will
follow me there.
And the winds of the old days

will blow through my hair.
The combination of dedication
to melancholy for the 1960s
marked not only Baez's material:
a 60s nostalgia may account for
the large crowds she as well as
Dylan attracts.
After a brief duet set with
sister Mimi, Baez returned to
perform the most lovely, most
serious part of the program.
"Love Song To A Stranger,"
brought, the crowd to total
silence, only to be balanced off by
a second reminiscent love song
which concluded that "love is a
pain in the ass."
"Joe Hill" and "Let It Be"
concluded the afternoon on a
religious level with many in the
crowd singing. As a final touch,
Mimi and Joan returned like two

flower goddesses and led the
crowd in a two part harmony on
"Amazing Grace."
It was indeed with amazing
grace that Joan Baez, radical
politician and lady of song,
blended her two identities Sunday
without compromising either.
