Boston Cops Rout Antibusing Mob
BOSTON — Police chased about 600 antibusing
demonstrators through the streets of South Boston
yesterday after a group of protesters stopped a
black man and beat him.
A police spokesman said a "regular melee"
erupted as officers moved in to break up the crowd
surrounding Andrea Jean-Louis, 31.
A spokesman for Mayor Kevin H. White said the
mayor had requested a meeting with U.S. District
Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity for 6 a.m. (PDT)
today to "apprise him of the current situation" in
the Boston public schools.
Garrity issued the court order which mandated
busing to achieve integration in Boston schools.
Police said Jean-Louis was driving through the
area when his car was stopped by traffic. As the
crowd approached, he left his car and ran, but the
demonstrators caught him before police could move
in to rescue him.
The white demonstrators apparently had been
waiting for buses carrying black children to leave a
middle school. The buses had been rerouted.
A Boston City Hospital spokesman said
Jean-Louis was treated and released. Police said he
had suffered head injuries.
Joseph E. Griffin, 33, of the South Boston
section, was arraigned later in South Boston district
court on a charge of assault and battery in
connection with the incident, police said. He was
released on $1000 bail.
Police said at least six others were arrested in
connection with the incident.
But* Admits Fault In Grain Deal
WASHINGTON — Agriculture Secretary Earl L.
Butz said yesterday he was partly to blame for any
misunderstanding which may have led the Soviet
Union to buy $500 million worth of com and wheat
when the U.S. supply was so tight.
Earlier, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
said bureaucratic misunderstanding may have
prompted the Soviets to place the large orders.
Those were suspended over the weekend as a result
of White House pressure.
"I think there were errors made," Butz said. "I
personally was not firm enough in my
representation" of the U.S. grain situation to Soviet
officials.
President Ford has rejected a suggestion that
Butz resign because of the aborted sale.
Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.) said over the
weekend that Butz was guilty of "gross
mismanagement" because the White House did
not know of the sales until the contracts were
signed.
Ford Unveils "Game Plan 9 Today
WASHINGTON — President Ford was said
yesterday to have ready for Congress an economic
program to be enacted as a whole. But opposition
already was building to one reported ingredient.

This, congressional sources said, would be a
proposed five percent increase in the tax paid by
corporations and moderate to high income
individuals. For personal taxpayers, reportedly the
surtax might affect those with incomes as low as
$7500 for single persons, $15,000 for couples.
This is to be packaged, the sources said, with an
increase in the investment credit to stimulate
building of productive facilities, especially by
utilities; an expanded job-creating program to
relieve unemployment, and perhaps a tax exemption
on the interest paid on savings deposited in
institutions financing home mortgages.
The White House kept tight secrecy on the
proposals Ford will unveil in a nationally televised
and broadcast appearance at a joint session of
Congress today at 1 p.m. (PDT). But Press Secretary
Ron Nessen said Ford will seek across the board
acceptance of more than a dozen economic
proposals.
There were predictions that Ford also will prod
Congress to act on a special tax on so-called windfall
profits of oil companies.
Delay Of Ford Pardon Testimony?
WASHINGTON — Members of the House
judiciary subcommittee were reported yesterday
heavily in favor of postponing President Ford's
historic testimony Thursday on his pardon of
former President Richard M. Nixon if the Watergate
cover-up jury has not been impaneled by then.
Rep. Wiley Mayne (R-Iowa) said he was the only
member at a subcommittee meeting yesterday
afternoon who objected strongly to any
postponement. He said other members wanted to
postpone it to Oct. 17 if the jury has not been
selected by tomorrow night.
Meanwhile, a White House spokesman said that
negotiations are still going on with Nixon over the
disposition of the formei president's tapes and
papers.
White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen said
talks were resumed last week after Special
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski raised some questions
over the agreement which was announced at the
time of Ford's pardon of Nixon.
That agreement gave Nixon custody of the
material, but would have assured government access
to the tapes for up to five years, when Nixon could
destroy them at will. If Nixon died, the tapes would
be destroyed immediately and in any case would be
destroyed in 1984.
Kissinger Expands Mideast Trip
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger has added three energy producing Arab
states to his Middle East trip, at the same time
claiming there's no link between Arab-Israeli
negotiations and the high cost of oil.
He told reporters yesterday at his first news
conference in nearly two months that he will stop in
Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Morocco in addition to
Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Israel.

Kissinger leaves tonight for the Middle East in his
latest effort to rejuvenate negotiations for a Middle
East settlement. He is now scheduled to return Oct.
15.
None of the three countries added is directly
involved in the Arab-Israeli situation, but each is
pivotal in Arab policymaking on the price and
supply of oil as well as related products such as
natural gas.
British Electioneering Winds Up
LONDON — Britain's election campaign neared
its climax yesterday with Labor Prime Minister
Harold Wilson rejecting Tory calls for an all-party
government to avert national catastrophe.
The calls for some sort of undefined coalition
under conservative leadership came from Wilson's
chief challenger, Edward Heath, who has hammered
the theme throughout the campaign as the only way
to save Britain from its economic crisis.
Britain's 40 million eligible voters troop to the
polls Thursday.
Just about every major poll makes Wilson's
Laborites runaway favorites to win.
U.S. Envoy's Kidnapers Get Offer
SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic —
Dominican President Joaquin BaJaguer offered safe
conduct out of the country last night to the six
kidnapers of American diplomat Barbara Hutchison
and six other persons.
In a 20-minute nationwide radio-television
speech, Balaguer said he was making the offer "in
the view of the fact that there were a certain
number of women being held as hostages" and that
efforts to arrive at another solution had taken too
much time.
The rebel group led by Rhadames Mendez Vargas
has been holding its captives in the Venezuelan
consulate since Sept. 27.
House Reasserts: No Turkish Aid
WASHINGTON — Rejecting a compromise
worked out with President Ford, the House voted
again yesterday to cut off U.S. military aid to
Turkey until Ford declares substantial progress has
been made in its withdrawal of troops from Cyprus.
The House, by an overwhelming 291-69 vote,
rejected a House-Senate compromise worked out
with Ford that called only for good faith efforts
toward a settlement.
Several Congressmen contended that Turkey
violated the law by using U.S. supplied military
equipment in its invasion and occupation of Cyprus.
