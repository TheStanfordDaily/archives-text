### 
ASSU Financial Manager Frank Olivieri yesterday
himself and reinstated six ASSU Senate
[candidates whom he disqualified Sunday.
The six candidates, all undergraduates, were originally
excluded from the race because their nominating
: petitions included signatures of graduate students.
The six are Beth Wood, Warner Session, Elena Rios,
| Lori Pryor, Eleanor Lynds and Kate Janeway.
An ASSU spokeswoman said Olivieri changed his
mind after agreeing with two of the candidates that the
j instructions for collecting signatures were ambiguous.
