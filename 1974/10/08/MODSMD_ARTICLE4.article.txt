# Willow Road Widening Explored
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
University land planning could be
affected by Palo Alto City Council
deliberations this week over a proposal
to widen and extend Willow Road and
a plan to rezone the Stanford
Industrial Park.
Tonight, the Council's Finance and
Public Works Committee will study a
plan to widen Willow to four lanes in
the area between the San Francisquito
Creek Bridge at the Oak Creek
Apartments, and El Camino. The plan
also proposes the extension of Willow
to connect Arboretum Road with El
Camino.
Willow currently is only two lanes
wide between the bridge and El
Camino.
Although Willow is on Stanford
land, it is part of the seven percent of
University land that is within Palo
Alto city limits.
Andrew Doty, director of
community relations for the
University, said the administration
favors extension of the road.
Improve Access
Doty noted that in its
recommendation of the project, the
city staff claimed that extension of
Willow would improve access to the
Hospital and the Shopping Center and
would relieve traffic cutting across the
corner of Campus Drive and Galvez
Street by Stanford Stadium.
Doty said extension of the road
would benefit the University
community as well as residents of Oak
Creek Apartments and downtown Palo
Alto by creating a more efficient
traffic flow.
The road's improvement also may
benefit faculty and staff members who
eventually might reside in an 800-to
1200-unit housing development
proposed in August by Robert
Augsburger, vice president for business
and finance. The development would
be constructed on the 45 acres now
fronting Willow, according to
Augsburger.
Rejection Advised
But Napthali Knox, director of the
city Planning Commission, said the
commission has advised the Council to
reject proposals for expanding Willow.
