# Willow Road Widening Explored
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
University land planning could be
affected by Palo Alto City Council
deliberations this week over a proposal
to widen and extend Willow Road and
a plan to rezone the Stanford
Industrial Park.
Tonight, the Council's Finance and
Public Works Committee will study a
plan to widen Willow to four lanes in
the area between the San Francisquito
Creek Bridge at the Oak Creek
Apartments, and El Camino. The plan
also proposes the extension of Willow
to connect Arboretum Road with El
Camino.
Willow currently is only two lanes
wide between the bridge and El
Camino.
Although Willow is on Stanford
land, it is part of the seven percent of
University land that is within Palo
Alto city limits.
Andrew Doty, director of
community relations for the
University, said the administration
favors extension of the road.
Improve Access
Doty noted that in its
recommendation of the project, the
city staff claimed that extension of
Willow would improve access to the
Hospital and the Shopping Center and
would relieve traffic cutting across the
corner of Campus Drive and Galvez
Street by Stanford Stadium.
Doty said extension of the road
would benefit the University
community as well as residents of Oak
Creek Apartments and downtown Palo
Alto by creating a more efficient
traffic flow.
The road's improvement also may
benefit faculty and staff members who
eventually might reside in an 800-to
1200-unit housing development
proposed in August by Robert
Augsburger, vice president for business
and finance. The development would
be constructed on the 45 acres now
fronting Willow, according to
Augsburger.
Rejection Advised
But Napthali Knox, director of the
city Planning Commission, said the
commission has advised the Council to
reject proposals for expanding Willow.
Knox said the commission feared
that the extension of the road would
increase traffic by encouraging use of
automobiles.
The extension and widening of
Willow would cost approximately $6.8
million, according to Doty.
Approximately 10 percent of the cost
would be financed by the city and the
remainder would be paid by residents
of a proposed assessment district
including property which would
benefit by extension of the road.
Discussion Tonight
The Council will discuss plans for
the creation of an assessment district
tonight, according to Charles
Dougherty, administrator of real
property for Palo Alto.
Harry Turner, manager of
management studies at the University
Accounting Office, said yesterday it is
impossible to guess how much of the
$6 million levied on the assessment
district would be paid by the
University.
Dougherty agreed, but said
extension of the road might add to
University revenues in the long run
because of increased business for
stores located on University land.
Condemnation
If the city extends Willow, it will
condemn surrounding Stanford land
and buy it from the University at
market price, Dougherty said.
Dougherty explained that by the
terms of Leland Stanford's founding
charter, the University is forbidden to
sell any of its more than 8000 acres. In
order to circumvent this dictum,
government authorities occasionally
condemn University land to construct
new roads.
The proposed changes in Willow are
part of a new "Comprehensive Plan"
developed by the city, according to
Knox, who described the plan as "a
precise setting of development and
public facility guidelines for now until
1990."
On Thursday night, the Council will
discuss rezoning vacant Stanford
Industrial Park land for residential use.
The University has requested that the

city not rezone any Stanford lands.
According to Doty, some city
officials claim that rezoning the lands
will help reduce traffic in the
Industrial Park, but Doty said the
decrease actually would be minimal.
Knox noted that although the
University originally expressed
concern about the rezoning plans
"some issues have now been made
moot because the Planning
Commission has backed off of
rezoning" some areas.
