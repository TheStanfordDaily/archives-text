# 'Live Oak' Loan Stirs New Round Of Debate
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Another round of controversy
flared yesterday over Live Oak,
Stanford's newest publishing venture,
when the Dean of Student Affairs'
Office revealed that the paper is asking
for a $2000 loan.
"We're not quite sure what to do
about it," said Dale Snape, assistant
dean of student affairs. "We have a
series of questions that we don't have
answers for."
Snape said Bill Weinstein, Live
Oak's editor and publisher, asked for
the loan Friday afternoon.
"It seems Live Oak has a cash flow
problem," Snape said. "It seems it has
accounts it can't expect payment for
for anything between 69 and 90 days."

Snape said he was investigating the
loan request and would make a
recommendation to the Campus
Affairs staff today or tomorrow.
Snape's office already loaned Live
Oak an interest-free $500 this summer,
not due until winter quarter.
Weinstein said he asked for the loan
only because ASSU Financial Manager
Frank Olivieri was discriminating
against his paper.
Weinstein said Olivieri refused to let
Live Oak use the ASSU Typesetting
Shop unless the paper banked with the
ASSU and paid its bills with ASSU
purchase orders.
Pay As You Go
The ASSU grants purchase orders
only if a group has enough money in
its account to cover the order; it does
not permit a group to spend
anticipated income.
"There wouldn't be any fuss if
Frank didn't make us pay in advance,"
Weinstein complained.
Weinstein said Live Oak was the
only customer required to use
purchase orders for work done at the
ASSU Typesetting Shop. Olivieri
confirmed it.
"It's my contention that they're
[Live Oak] a credit risk, a credit risk
with a capital C," Olivieri said. "They
have advertising. It's pretty
substantial. It's pretty voluminous.
"But we don't know what the
certainty of collectability is on those
ads."
No Reserve
Olivieri said that unlike other
publications, Live Oak does not have a
large cash reserve to tide it through
several issues.
Weinstein agreed, but said
advertising revenue due during the
next month would more than cover his
bills. He insisted the $2000, which
would be repaid to the University over
a period of nine months, was only
necessary to carry the paper until the
first advertising money came in.
Olivieri said he urged Snape not to
loan Live Oak the $2000 because he
didn't believe the publication was
financially sound. The ASSU Council
of Presidents also advised Snape
against the loan.
'Over ASSU's Head'
ASSU President Mike Herman said
the loan would amount to the
University "going over the head of the
ASSU" since Live Oak has applied for
funds from several ASSU agencies.
"I told him [Snape] he should wait
until either the student financial
manager or the ASSU Publications
Board gave some indication if they
were going to fund Live Oak," Herman
said.
Snape also consulted ASSU Senator
Rocky Barber, who advised him the
loan was a good idea. Barber couldn't
be reached for comment last night.
Weinstein said his newspaper would
be able to publish its third issue Friday
regardless of the decision on the loan,
but couldn't make up his mind about
the more distant future.
"This is merely an irritation in the
whole scheme of things," Weinstein
said at one point. But later he
predicted "if Frank Olivieri continues
his present policy— selective
discrimination—there will be no Live
Oak.
