# Med Center Lab Gives Drug, Poison Tests

### LINDA SCHMIDT 
Local victims of poisoning no
longer will have to be rushed 35 miles
to San Francisco for blood and urine
analyses now that a new laboratory at
the Stanford Medical Center has
opened.
Personnel in the Drug Assay Lab,
available 24 hours a day, can obtain
results from tests for suspected drug
overdose or poisoning in as little as
four hours, according to laboratory
director Dr. Sumner Kalman.
Doctors require information as
soon as possible on the amount and
type of substance involved in the
poisoning. "Dealing with a laboratory
in San Francisco is more expensive and
time consuming. A toxic screening
here at the Medical Center is really
needed," according to Dr. Michael
Eliastam, director of emergency
services.
Outward symptoms alone may not
allow determination of the type of
poisoning, he continued.
Another problem is the evasiveness
of some victims. "Patients who are
conscious may be reluctant to admit
what they took, especially if it was an
illegal narcotic," Eliastam said. "Some
may not know what they had; street
drugs can contain very strange

mixtures."
Identification Needed
Until the type and level of drug has
been identified, no specific antidote
can be administered.
In the interim, measures are taken
to stabilize patients and to prevent
their condition from worsening.
Followup tests to monitor drug
amounts in seriously poisoned patients
admitted to the hospital are done at
no extra charge.
The Drug Assay Lab also provides
blood and urine determinations of
certain clinical drugs, particularly
those with only a small variation
between a beneficial and a dangerous
dose. Drugs measured include those
used in treating heart disease, epilepsy
or other neurological disorders.
Barbiturates and sedatives also are
assayed.
Prescription Overdose
The lab also can monitor overdoses
of prescription drugs caused by
ineffective metabolism in patients.
"Every individual has a distinctive
metabolic personality that determines
how rapidly a drug is cleared from the
body," Kalman noted. "There can be a
ten-fold difference in the amount of
drug required by different people in
order to achieve the desired
therapeutic effect."
Dr. Dennis Clark, supervisor of the
laboratory, explained the need for
routine drug monitoring. A patient
with epilepsy, for example, is taking a
prescribed drug to control seizures.
The drug's effectiveness depends on
the patient's metabolism. The drug
could reach a toxic level in the
bloodstream before it helps prevent
attacks.
High Tolerance
Another patient may have an
unusually high tolerance for the drug,
and require more than the standard
amount to achieve control. "The
important thing," Kalman stressed, "is
to alert physicians to any drug levels
which are either too high or too low in
their patients so they can adjust
dosages accordingly."
At the request of the Children's
Hospital at Stanford, the laboratory is
now developing a reliable assay for
methotrexate, a potent anti-cancer
drug used to treat children with
leukemia. Developmental work is
being done on methods . for
determining overdoses of other drugs,
according to Clark.
Screening services such as the Med
Center's are relatively new, Kalman
pointed out. Improvements in analytic
techniques in recent years have made
the identification and determination
of certain drugs easier and faster.
Drugs Separated
The drugs are separated by gas
chromatography, using assays
developed primarily at the Med Center
laboratory.
Although the clinic originally only
expected to treat about 20 patients a
month, said Clark, the actual volume
of patients has been much higher. Last
month the clinic treated 40 patients.
The services of the laboratory are
available to physicians throughout the
Bay Area.
