# Med Center Lab Gives Drug, Poison Tests

Local victims of poisoning no
longer will have to be rushed 35 miles
to San Francisco for blood and urine
analyses now that a new laboratory at
the Stanford Medical Center has
opened.
Personnel in the Drug Assay Lab,
available 24 hours a day, can obtain
results from tests for suspected drug
overdose or poisoning in as little as
four hours, according to laboratory
director Dr. Sumner Kalman.
Doctors require information as
soon as possible on the amount and
type of substance involved in the
poisoning. "Dealing with a laboratory
in San Francisco is more expensive and
time consuming. A toxic screening
here at the Medical Center is really
needed," according to Dr. Michael
Eliastam, director of emergency
services.
Outward symptoms alone may not
allow determination of the type of
poisoning, he continued.
Another problem is the evasiveness
of some victims. "Patients who are
conscious may be reluctant to admit
what they took, especially if it was an
illegal narcotic," Eliastam said. "Some
may not know what they had; street
drugs can contain very strange

mixtures."
Identification Needed
Until the type and level of drug has
been identified, no specific antidote
can be administered.
In the interim, measures are taken
to stabilize patients and to prevent
their condition from worsening.
Followup tests to monitor drug
amounts in seriously poisoned patients
admitted to the hospital are done at
no extra charge.
The Drug Assay Lab also provides
blood and urine determinations of
certain clinical drugs, particularly
those with only a small variation
between a beneficial and a dangerous
dose. Drugs measured include those
used in treating heart disease, epilepsy
or other neurological disorders.
Barbiturates and sedatives also are
assayed.
Prescription Overdose
The lab also can monitor overdoses
of prescription drugs caused by
ineffective metabolism in patients.
"Every individual has a distinctive
metabolic personality that determines
how rapidly a drug is cleared from the
body," Kalman noted. "There can be a
ten-fold difference in the amount of
drug required by different people in
