# Demands State Reforms
## Gregorio Hits 'Big Money' 
### MARK FUNK 
Declaring that "even one person
can make a significant contribution to
the political process," State Sen. Arlen
Gregorio (D-San Mateo) yesterday
lashed out at "big money" currently
dominating California politics.
Gregorio, a four-year veteran of the
state Senate, is up for re-election for
the first time in the newly apportioned
10th District. The district includes
southern San Mateo County, part of
Gregorio's old constituency, and
northern Santa Clara County,
including Stanford.
Speaking to 10 students at the

International Center on electoral and
governmental reform, Gregorio, who
has been labeled a reformer in some
Sacramento circles, commented that
great headway had been made in
making the legislature more responsive
to the needs of the people. "We have
come quite a distance since 1970 when
I entered the Senate," he said.
The senator underscored his belief
that special interest groups "had come
between individuals and the
government." Gregorio claims that his
campaign organization has rejected
over $30,000 worth of contributions
from political pressure groups.
Money Not Involvement
"Too often people contribute
money to an organization and think
that this is becoming involved in the
political process," he said. "This is not
true." Gregorio said his people have
not accepted any contributions from
large organizations such as labor
unions, professional groups and
corporate management.
Gregorio mentioned his efforts to
expand funding of the state's alcoholic
rehabilitation program as an example
of interest group pressure in
Sacramento.
A 1972 Gregorio bill would have
placed an added tax on alcoholic
beverages to help fund the program.
"The bill was cut to pieces in
committee the first year and killed,"
he said.
Pressure
In 1973 it passed over Gregorio's
objection when the provision calling
for funding by taxation was struck and
amended to provide financing through
the general fund for 18 months. "It
passed because the alcohol industry
put pressure on legislators in the
committee to strike the tax. They
were the only people to object to the
bill," he said.
Gregorio has been persistent in his
attempts to spur colleagues toward
reform. Referring to a number of
reform bills he has submitted to the
Senate for consideration, he pointed
out that his efforts have resulted in
open committee meetings in the state
capital.
One such piece of legislation
allowed the public to sit in on

meetings of the state budget
committee.
The senator emphasized the need
for a unicameral legislature of 99
members. Stating his opposition to the
present bicameral set-up, Gregorio said
that in addition to saving California
taxpayers between "20 and 40 million
dollars a year," a unicameral system
would pare districts to a "more
manageable 200,000 constituents."
The Gregorio campaign is currently
pointing to a Nov. 5 showdown with
Republican James Tormey Jr., a
member of the San Mateo Community
College Board of Trustees.

ARLEN'S ARGUMENT—State Sen. Arlen Gregorio, a four-year veteran seeking
election to a newly apportioned district which includes Stanford, yesterday
argued here against accepting contributions from large special interest
organizations and criticized those who believe political involvement means
simply donating money to campaigns.
