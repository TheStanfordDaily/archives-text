The intersection in front of the Delta Upsilon fraternity
house has been a dangerous one since its creation this
summer. And last Thursday, that intersection was the scene
of one of the year's first bicycle-car collisions.
Fortunately, that accident was minor. However, it
conjured up memories of earlier bicycle accidents, notably
one during spring, 1973. That accident was fatal.
After that fatal crash, the hue and cry went out for strict
enforcement of bicycle traffic laws and improvement of
campus bike paths.
Bike paths were slightly upgraded in some parts of the
campus and the campus police did stop and warn bicyclists
â€” for a while. But now, consciousness about bike safety,
among police, motorists and bicycle riders themselves, seems
to have lapsed.
Clearly what is needed to prevent accidents is careful,
responsible bicycling and motoring. It is up to the individual
rider and driver to use the campus roadways safely.
Yet, realizing human nature, we feel that bicycle traffic
laws must be strictly enforced to make these laws credible
and obeyed. Bicyclists may not begin taking bike stop signs
seriously until the police begin regularly ticketing violators.
In addition, given the poor condition of many campus
roads, we feel a detailed traffic pattern study, including bike
routes, is necessary.
Last Thursday's accident prompted the installation of
stop signs at the intersection in front of D.U. the next day.
Perhaps a stop light further up Mayfield at the new Campus
Drive intersection is needed during peak traffic hours.
How many other unsafe intersections are possible
hazards?
Improvement of dangerous intersections and enforcement
of bike traffic laws should not wait for another accident . . .
or another editorial.
