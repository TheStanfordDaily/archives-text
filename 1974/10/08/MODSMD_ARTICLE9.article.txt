# War Goes On

This is another article about
Vietnam. What? Another article
about Vietnam? Yes, I know.
What a pain. There have been
articles about Vietnam in the
Daily for the last 20 years.
But you see the war still goes on
in Vietnam, and the repression
still goes on, and it's your fault.
While there are political
prisoners in countries all over the
world, and even though the
United States has done a great
deal to create and support some
of the most repressive and brutal
of right wing governments in
many of these countries, there is
one country that has suffered
more then all the others. There is
one country that has been
particularly blessed with
America's not so benign interest.
That country is the so called
Republic of South Vietnam.
These days Americans are
hearing all sorts of stories about
strange happenings in various
far-flung parts of the world. There
are tales of brutal torture
chambers that serve our giant ally
to the south, Brazil. These
chambers operate on a vast
spectrum of public enemies
ranging from nuns, through
college students, to communist
trade unionists. There are vague
intimiations that the worldwide
growth in torture has unfortunate
connections to U.S. foreign
policy. In recent years a number*
of American officials have been
assasinated because they have
been attributed with bringing
torture to previously less
aggressive police departments
(Uruguay, Guatamala). And there
is, of course, the long American
history of gross interference in
other countries' internal affairs,
the most recently revealed case
being Chile.

Yet even though Vietnam was
not America's first imperialistic
venture, and it certainly hasn't
proven to be the last, it has been
the worst. Not only did it turn
into America's largest and most
unpopular undeclared war but.it
also dragged hundreds of
thousands of young American
men onto the cutting edge of
repression.
Well,the boys have come home.
Not on their knees either. Maybe
without any knees. Maybe hooked
on heroin, or full of self-hatred,
but not on their knees. Now only
the experts remain. The political
costs of sending the boy next
door out to Southeast Asia to give
his blood, or conscience, or both
so that the Executive Branch of
the United States could decide on
who will rule Vietnam have grown
too high. One must make do with
dollars, teachers, and technicians.
Perhaps they will be enough.
Amnesty International calculates
that there are over 200,000
political prisoners in South
Vietnam (one of them is this
year's ASSU professor). Torture is
widespread and as they say in the
military: SOP (Standard
Operating Procedure). United
States aid still goes toward tiger
cages, prisons, police, and police
computers. Those hundreds of
thousands of idealogical police are
our police. After all we trained
them, we armed them, and we pay
them.
Since we are supplying over 80
percent of the South Vietnamese
budget it is difficult to deny our
complete responsibility for what
is happening there today this very
instant. South Vietnam is a fascist
state as repressive politically as
Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia.
South Vietnam is our 51st state.
