# President Presents Anti-Inflation Plans
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Warning
that inflation can "destroy our
country, our homes, our liberties,"
President Ford proposed yesterday a
broad-ranging anti-inflation package
that would combine selected tax cuts
and increases, special help for the
unemployed and new moves to
conserve energy.
in a nationally broadcast adciress
before a joint session of Congress,
Ford unveiled recommendations that
varied little from what had been
expected.
Ford asked Congress to impose a
temporary, one-year tax surcharge of
five percent on corporations and
middle- and upper-income taxpayers.
The President also sought a
liberalized, across-the-board
investment tax credit of 10 percent to
encourage expansion of factories and
businesses.
Public Service Jobs
To help the jobless as the economy
continues to slump — and living costs
rise — Ford proposed the creation of a
new "community improvement corps"
to provide public service jobs when
unemployment exceeds six percent
nationally. The current rate of 5.8
percent is expected to increase.
Under the Ford plan, the one-year
jobs program would automatically go
into effect in local labor markets with
high unemployment even if the
national average remained below six
percent. Grants for jobs would be
triggered when local rates exceeded
6.5 percent.
The President, in addition,
recommended an extra 13 weeks of
special unemployment insurance
benefits for those who have used up
their credits and 26 weeks of benefits
for those not now covered by a regular i
unemployment insurance program.
Treasury Revenues ]
These would be financed from ]
Treasury' revenues and not from taxes i
on employers.
Ford also specified that to be <
eligible for a public service job, an
individual would first have to exhaust
all unemployment benefits.
Treasury Secretary William E.
Simon told newsmen the one-year
surtax was expected to raise $4.7
billion — $2.6 billion from individuals
and $2.1 billion from corporations.
Corporations Benefit
Simon said the liberalized
investment tax credit would bring
corporations $2.7 billion a year in
benefits so the impact of the surtax on
them would be more than offset by
what would amount to companion tax
cuts.
The President produced no new
plan to lower taxes for the pooi but
instead endorsed a tax revision bill
now pending in the House Ways and
Means Committee that he said would
give the poor $1.6 billion of tax relief.
In the energy area, Ford fixed a
goal of reducing imports of foreign oil
by one million barrels a day by the
end of 1975. This would be
accomplished by increasing domestic
energy production and by conserving

oil.
To develop "a single national
energy policy and program," Ford
created a National Energy' Board
headed by Secretary of the Interior
Rogers C. B. Morton.
One of the President's major
proposals would set a 1980 target for
"eliminating oil-fired plants from the
nation's baseloaded electrical
capacity" by converting to coal and
uranium.
A fact sheet said the conversion
would be accomplished voluntarily or
the Preside i would seek legislation to
force it. •

broad-ranging anti-inflation package
that would combine selected tax cuts
and increases, special help for the
unemployed and new moves to
conserve energy.
in a nationally broadcast adciress
before a joint session of Congress,
Ford unveiled recommendations that
varied little from what had been
expected.
Ford asked Congress to impose a
temporary, one-year tax surcharge of
five percent on corporations and
middle- and upper-income taxpayers.
The President also sought a
liberalized, across-the-board
investment tax credit of 10 percent to
encourage expansion of factories and
businesses.
Public Service Jobs
To help the jobless as the economy
continues to slump — and living costs
rise — Ford proposed the creation of a
new "community improvement corps"
to provide public service jobs when
unemployment exceeds six percent
nationally. The current rate of 5.8
percent is expected to increase.
Under the Ford plan, the one-year
jobs program would automatically go
into effect in local labor markets with
high unemployment even if the
national average remained below six
percent. Grants for jobs would be
triggered when local rates exceeded
6.5 percent.
The President, in addition,
recommended an extra 13 weeks of
special unemployment insurance
benefits for those who have used up
their credits and 26 weeks of benefits
for those not now covered by a regular i
unemployment insurance program.
Treasury Revenues ]
These would be financed from ]
Treasury' revenues and not from taxes i
on employers.
Ford also specified that to be <
eligible for a public service job, an
individual would first have to exhaust
all unemployment benefits.
Treasury Secretary William E.
Simon told newsmen the one-year
surtax was expected to raise $4.7
billion — $2.6 billion from individuals
and $2.1 billion from corporations.
Corporations Benefit
Simon said the liberalized
investment tax credit would bring
corporations $2.7 billion a year in
benefits so the impact of the surtax on
them would be more than offset by
what would amount to companion tax
cuts.
The President produced no new
plan to lower taxes for the pooi but
instead endorsed a tax revision bill
now pending in the House Ways and
Means Committee that he said would
give the poor $1.6 billion of tax relief.
In the energy area, Ford fixed a
goal of reducing imports of foreign oil
by one million barrels a day by the
end of 1975. This would be
accomplished by increasing domestic
energy production and by conserving

oil.
To develop "a single national
energy policy and program," Ford
created a National Energy' Board
headed by Secretary of the Interior
Rogers C. B. Morton.
One of the President's major
proposals would set a 1980 target for
"eliminating oil-fired plants from the
nation's baseloaded electrical
capacity" by converting to coal and
uranium.
