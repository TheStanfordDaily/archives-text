# Stanford Must Cut $10 Million From Budget Over Three Years

### DON COX 
Budget cuts and other fiscal
reforms totaling approximately $10
million over the next three years will
be necessary to bring Stanford's
runaway budget under control,
Univeristy business and finance
officials told the Board of Trustees
yesterday.
With inflation driving expenses
upward and a sagging stock market
sapping endowment and gift income,
Stanford would face a $22 million
budget defecit in five years if no
corrective action were taken, predicts
a long-range financial forecast
presented to the Trustees.
"In order to bring long-range
financial equilibrium in reach,"
President Lyman said yesterday, the
University is embarking upon a budget
balancing program so "reasonable and
necessary increases in the cost of
maintaining the University from year
to year are matched by income
increases that are recurring and
dependable."
While the University hopes the flow
of income can be increased to some
degree, Vice Provost Ray Bacchetti
said yesterday that budget cuts would
be primarily responsible for bringing
expenses in line with income.
Busy
Bacchetti said Univeristy officials
will be busy during months ahead
attempting to determine where these
cuts can be made. He ruled out
across-the-board cuts as being a
"mindless" method to realize the
programs goals, "though that doesn't
mean it isn't a good way to begin."
Lyman said the cuts would entail
"difficult-to-make choices and
painful-to-implement actions. At the
end of this period of adjustment to
changing financial conditions,
Stanford will undoubtedly do less than
it does not.
"The only alternative is to try to do
everything now, and then to watch
helplessly while mediocrity overtakes
us.
"Our challenge will be to plan with
intelligence and conviction so that
Stanford in 1977-Ta remains one of
the handful of institutions where the
most talented faculty and the ablest
students can engage each other in
learning that is of inestimable social
value and human b> elit," he said.
He said the cuts do "not imply a
renunciation of all change or
improvement," but a reordering of

priorities which calls for financing of
improvements largely "by
reallocations within existing budgets,
rather than from incremental income."
Commission
To assist him and the University in
restoring a financial balance, Lyman
appointed a University Budget
Priorities Advisory Commission
chaired by University Press Director
Leon Seltzer.
The commission will review
critically the "causes and severity or
present and prospective budget
difficulties" and advise Lyman with
respect to "primary institutional
variables and relationships," Lyman
said. The commission will include two
students to be named in the near
future.
While the $22 million figure is a
good indication of the rate at which
expenses and income are becoming
unbalanced, Bacchetti said it was a
