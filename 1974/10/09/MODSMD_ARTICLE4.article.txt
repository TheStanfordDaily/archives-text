# City Council Committee Refuses To Support Willow Road Project
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
The Palo Alto City Council's
finance and Public Works Committee
failed to recommend to the Council
that Willow Road be widened and
extended as proposed by a city
planning staff report.
The city staff report supported the
widening of Willow Road by 90 feet,
making it a four-lane street, between
Arboretum Road and El Camino.
Traffic Engineer Ted Noguchi, who
presented the report to the committee,
said, "nearly 21,200 vehicles travel on
Willow Road everyday . . . leading to
increased air pollution in the area" and
traffic jams at rush hours.
However, Councilman Kirke
Comstock was "disturbed" that the
new road would destroy trees and
harm to the environment. He and Vice
Mayor Alan Henderson voted against
the recommendation. Councilmen
John Beahrs and John Berwald
supported it.
Proponents of the road-widening
emphasized the beneficial effect to
Palo Alto, and particularly to the
Stanford Shopping Center, which is
adjacent to Willow.
Lewis Lengfeld, president of the
Stanford Shopping Center Merchants'
Association, said, "The merchants
depend on Willow Road. For 20 years
this problem has been acute for us.
We'd like to invite anyone to try to
drive on Willow at 5 p.m."
Lengfeld predicted that a widening
of the road would encourage "our rich
clients from the hills" to the west to
frequent the shopping center. Palo
Alto is now "uninviting" to Portola
Valley and Woodside residents, he
said.
A University spokesman, Planning
Director James Nelson, supported the
Willow extension in light of Stanford's
"interest in return on its investment in
the Stanford Shopping Center. We
[the University] want people to go to
the shopping center," he said.
Nelson noted that tenants of the
shopping center would fund the

project since they "could afford it
with the increased business" after
completion of the road improvement.
Palo Alto Planning Director
Naphatli Knox said that any plan to
lessen the traffic burden on Willow
Road needed to be matched with a
similar extension of Stanford's
Campus Drive to Junipero Serra
Boulevard in the near future.

When asked by Council members if
the University would supplement any
Willow improvement in such a manner,
Nelson replied, "We (the University]
are faced with a $10 million deficit in
the next three years. We cannot
extend Campus Drive."
The City Council will discuss the
Willow Road extension proposal on
Oct. 29.
