# New Houses Get Tentative OK
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees voted
tentative approval yesterday to
plans to build three new Row
houses. Final approval and
appropriation of funds for the
construction of the houses must
await a detailed study of building
plans and financial arrangements.
Secretary to the University Fred
Glover said last night that "it would
be very hard to say" if the Board of
Trustees will vote in the future to
actually build the houses, estimated
to cost $1.5 million each.
"I don't want to prejudge what
the Board might decide," he said.
Glover said the procedure by
which the project is now referred to
the trustees' committees on
financial development and land and
buildings was the "common
procedure by which the Board

operates."
"The Board has voted general
approval of the concept of the
houses," he said. The trustees' i
committees will recommend to the
Board in the future whether the
houses should be built, he said.
The houses are the first stage of
a long-term undergraduate housing
project consisting of construction
of a total of 850 student housing
spaces costing $25 million.
Plans call for the new Row
houses to be built on Mayfield
Avenue across from the Beta Theta
Pi house. Each will accomodate
about 50 students.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs J
Larrv Horton has expressed
optimism in the past that the |
Trustees will approve construction
of the new Row houses.
