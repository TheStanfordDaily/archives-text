# Grading Study Released
## Student GPA: About 3.5 
### JIM WASCHER 
The grade point average of the
typical undergraduate student here is
3.55, according to a survey conducted
by a Faculty Senate panel which is
currently studying the grading system.
Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron,
chairman of the Ad Hoc Panel to
Study the Grading System, sampled
200 student grade reports from last
autumn quarter. Although he said the
sample was only "semi-random," he is
"sure that the results are reasonably
accurate."
A survey conducted two years ago
reported the typical undergrad's GPA
as 3.50.
Efron said pass and no-credit grades
did not figure in the grade point
average "in my way of reckoning."
The sample of last autumn's grades
also revealed that 39 percent of the
marks given to undergraduates were
As, 26 percent were Bs, seven percent
were Cs and the rest were divided
among the pass, no-credit and
incomplete option s.
Prioi to the faculty Senate's
decision to scrap the grades D and F
effective in autumn 1970, only 29

percent of all grades were As, 35
percent Bs, 16 percent Cs and three
percent Ds.
Grade Revision
The Efron panel is a subcommittee
of the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement.
When the Senate adopted a major
revision of the grading system in 1970,
"it said it would review its decision in
a few years," Efron said. "So this is an
automatically generated panel."
The 1970 revision also included
eliminating the University's prior
practice of reporting how many units a
student attempted each quarter, in
addition to the number he passed.
Prior to the revision, the University
could place a student on academic
probation or suspend him for
academic reasons if his grade point
average was too low. Now the
University determines a student's
academic standing by examining the
number of units he completes each
quarter.
Efron tin.* current grading
system offers "a record of
achievement rather than an historical
record of what a student has done."
Consideration
Although Efron wants to have a
report ready for the Senate within five
to six weeks, he acknowledged that "it
will probably take longer to
adequately consider all of the
information we have gathered since
last year."
The panel has surveyed faculty and
student opinion about the current
grading system and has also polled
deans of graduate schools around the
country to ask what impact the system
is having on students' chances for
admission to these graduate schools.
The returned survey forms have not
been tabulated.
In conversations carried on
independent of the survey itself, Efron

has found that many professors
"reacted with alarm" when told about
the typical undergraduate's GPA.
"What I want to know," Law Prof.
John Kaplan told the Daily, "is why
anyone bothers to cheat when
professors hand out As like sugar
candy."
Ducking Out
Efron believes that "barely any Cs
are given any more because that's the
worst grade now and professors feel
bad about giving it." He added that
"students often duck out of a course if
they see a C coming their way."
A 1974 Stanford graduate
acknowl°dged the point. "Whenever I
thought there was a chance I'd get a C
and 1 didn't need the class for my
major, I'd take a pass, an incomplete
or a no-credit.'
In his three years here after
transferring from another Pacific Eight
university, the alumnus said he
"ducked" a possible C on five or six
occasions.

In conversations carried on
independent of the survey itself, Efron

has found that many professors
"reacted with alarm" when told about
the typical undergraduate's GPA.
"What I want to know," Law Prof.
John Kaplan told the Daily, "is why
anyone bothers to cheat when
professors hand out As like sugar
candy."
Ducking Out
Efron believes that "barely any Cs
are given any more because that's the
worst grade now and professors feel
bad about giving it." He added that
"students often duck out of a course if
they see a C coming their way."
A 1974 Stanford graduate
acknowl°dged the point. "Whenever I
thought there was a chance I'd get a C
and 1 didn't need the class for my
major, I'd take a pass, an incomplete
or a no-credit.'
In his three years here after
transferring from another Pacific Eight
university, the alumnus said he
"ducked" a possible C on five or six
occasions.

Bradley Efron
The grade point average of the
typical undergraduate student here is
3.55, according to a survey conducted
by a Faculty Senate panel which is
currently studying the grading system.
Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron,
chairman of the Ad Hoc Panel to
Study the Grading System, sampled
200 student grade reports from last
autumn quarter. Although he said the
sample was only "semi-random," he is
"sure that the results are reasonably
accurate."
A survey conducted two years ago
reported the typical undergrad's GPA
as 3.50.
Efron said pass and no-credit grades
did not figure in the grade point
average "in my way of reckoning."
The sample of last autumn's grades
also revealed that 39 percent of the
marks given to undergraduates were
As, 26 percent were Bs, seven percent
were Cs and the rest were divided
among the pass, no-credit and
incomplete option s.
Prioi to the faculty Senate's
decision to scrap the grades D and F
effective in autumn 1970, only 29

percent of all grades were As, 35
percent Bs, 16 percent Cs and three
percent Ds.
Grade Revision
The Efron panel is a subcommittee
of the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement.
When the Senate adopted a major
revision of the grading system in 1970,
"it said it would review its decision in
a few years," Efron said. "So this is an
automatically generated panel."
The 1970 revision also included
eliminating the University's prior
practice of reporting how many units a
student attempted each quarter, in
addition to the number he passed.
Prior to the revision, the University
could place a student on academic
probation or suspend him for
academic reasons if his grade point
average was too low. Now the
University determines a student's
academic standing by examining the
number of units he completes each
quarter.
Efron tin.* current grading
system offers "a record of
achievement rather than an historical
record of what a student has done."
Consideration
Although Efron wants to have a
report ready for the Senate within five
to six weeks, he acknowledged that "it
will probably take longer to
adequately consider all of the
information we have gathered since
last year."
The panel has surveyed faculty and
student opinion about the current
grading system and has also polled
deans of graduate schools around the
country to ask what impact the system
is having on students' chances for
admission to these graduate schools.
The returned survey forms have not
been tabulated.
