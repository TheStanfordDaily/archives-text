# Editor Explains 'Women Sports' Focus
## 
### 
A magazine that deals exclusively
with the problems that face women in
sports is not practicing "reverse
sexism" Women Sports editor Rosalie
Wright said here yesterday.
She explained to 150 students in a
communications class that
Women Sports, a monthly magazine
published by Billie Jean and Larry
King, is "filling a need because nobody
else is filling it."
The first issue of Women Sports
appeared last June. Wright, with the
help of a small editorial staff, still
faces many of the problems that
plague many new specialized
publications, she said.
Citing the high mortality rate of
special interest manazines founded
during the past year. Wright said that
investors are reluctant to take the risk
of backing a new publication.
And advertisers take a wait-and-see
attitude until a magazine has been
publishing for more than six months,
she added.
Women Sports places few
restrictions on advertising, rejects only
ads which "reinforce a sexist
stereotype" she said.
Wright said she does not oppose
advertising for liquor or cigarettes.
Because Virginia Slims has provided
massive financial support for women's
tennis tournaments it would be
hypocritical to refuse their
advertisements, she explained.

She also said that the spiralling cost
of postage, paper and ink causes new
magazine publishing ventures to
founder.
Although some readers have
suggested that Women Sports be
renamed People Sports, Wright sees a
need for a specific examinaNof the
problems that face worn n a let. in
amateur and professional spor
At the same time, Women Sports
"can afford to have a sense of humor
because sports are fun," she said.
Although she describes the
magazine as "an outgrowth of the
women's liberation movement,"
Wright attempts to commission "the
best writing" from available freelance
contributors—men as well as women.
However, a male writer who allows
traditional chauvinist views to intrude
in an article may be unaware of his
patronizing tone, Wright said. When
that happens she diplomatically
suggests a rewrite. "Most really sincere
guys these days think I have a pretty
good point of view," she added.
The next major test of
Women Sports editorial quality will
come during a drive to obtain
subscription renewals, Wright said. She
claimed that readers want articles on
the "how to's" of buying equipment
or getting started in a sport, even
though "they are the least fun for a
writer to do."

JOCK TALK—WornenSport, a new magazine about—you guessed it—women and
athletics, has a lot of hurdles to leap, its editor Rosalie Wright said yesterday.
But none of them are that high.
