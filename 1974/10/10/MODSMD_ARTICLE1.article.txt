From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - President Ford
told a sun-drenched Rose Garden news
conference yesterday he hopes for
"some meaningful reduction in the
rate of inflation" by early next year
and does not beheve the country is
suffering from a recession.
In an outdoor question-and-answer
session with reporters, Ford also
declared that:
—Despite his wife's recent cancer
surgery, "I have seen nothing to
change" his inclination to run for
election in 1976;
Brezhnev Meeting
—"lf there is a reason" for him to
meet with Soviet leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev before a planned 1975
Washington summit, "I will certainly
consider it." White House officials say
a November meeting somewhere in the
Pacific is under consideration;
—He continues to oppose forced
busing to achieve racial balance in
schools, but thinks it of "maximum
importance that the citizens of Boston
respect the law" and that it will not be
necessary to send federal troops there
to deal with racial disturbances;
—He still hopes to find a
constitutional way to provide federal
aid to private and parochial schools
although the courts have frowned
upon the tax credit idea he long had
favored;
To Meet Mexican President
—He will meet Mexican President
Luis Echeverria on the border between
Arizona and that country on Oct. 21;
—A $50,000 gift by Vice President
Designate Nelson A. Rockefeller to
Henry A. Kissinger before he joined
the government was free of
impropriety, and the secretary of state
"deserves whatever good and

appropriate things I can say about
him;"
Ford fielded questions with ease
during the half-hour session, making a
departure from the customary news
conference format to encourage
reporters to ask follow-up questions.
The session was carried live by
television and radio.
Economy Dominates Session
The economy dominated the
session, with Ford arguing that his
proposed surtax would affect only 28
percent of all taxpayers and would
produce income that would stimulate
the slumping housing industry and
assist those hardest hit by inflation.
Responding to the first question of
the afternoon, Ford said, "I do not
think the United States is in a
recession. We do have economic
problems, but it is a very mixed
situation."
If Congress and the people respond
to the economic program he unveiled
Tuesday, Ford said, he is convinced
"We can have, hopefully early in 1975,
some meaningful reduction in the rate
of inflation."
Ford said if Congress grants his
request for a one-year, five percent
surcharge on income taxes for
corporations and middle and upper
income Americans, such measures
would not have to be extended
beyond 1975.
Only two questions were asked that
related to resigned President Richard
Nixon.
To one, Ford declined to discuss
further the unconditional pardon he
granted his predecessor, saying, "I
think it is most appropriate that I
defer any comment on that subject"
until testimony he is scheduled to give
to a House judiciary subcommittee
Oct. 17.
To another, Ford defended his
recommendation, sharply assailed in
Congress, that Nixon be provided with
$850,000 for a transition period.
