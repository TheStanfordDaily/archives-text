# South Boston And White 'Liberals'
## 
### Stephen Carter 
White parents were out en masse
protesting integration of "their" public
schools. Someone saw alone black man in his
car.
He cried, "There's one, get him!" After
that , according to the New York Times:
"The black man had locked the doors, but
the crowd pounded on the car and the
windshield. He jumped out and tried to run
down the sidewalk, and the crowd was after
him. A policeman fired three warning shots
in the air. The whites cursed him."
Everyone can identify the time and Dlace
at once, of course. Little Rock, Ark., in 1957.
with Governor Orval Faubus trying to block
the desegregation of Central High School,
right?
Wrong.
The time is now, and the place is South
Boston. The incident described was merely
one of many that have occurred since Federal
District Judge W. Arthur Garrity ordered
busing to eliminate segregation in Boston
schools.
Boston Tranquil?
To most of the nation, Boston has always
seemed a tranquil sort of place. After all,
Massachusetts alone among states went for
George McGovern in 1972. It is considered
perhaps the nation's main bastion of white
"liberalism," and it stands to reason that the
state capital and its environs would
exemplify this reputation.
In 1972, South Boston voters unseated
Louise Day Hicks, who was staunchly
opposed to integration, as their
representative in Congress; however, she lost
by a plurality of a mere two percentage

points. Most observers expect John Moakley,
who won in 1972, to repeat this November.
And in the 1972 presidential elections, the
9th Congressional District, which includes
South Boston, gave 59 percent of its vote to
McGovern a greater percentage than the
state of Massachusetts as a whole.
In short, the area appeared, up until now,
to be living up to its liberal reputation.
Protestors Arrested
Yet dozens of white protestors have been
arrested. On Tuesday, when only one black
student showed up for classes at South
Boston High School, eight persons, including
both black and white students and a black
teacher's aide, were injured.
Television and newspaper reporters have
been assaulted. Almost every school day has
produced another wild melee as members of
the Police Tactical Patrol Froce have
attempted (in that curious manner policemen
have) to keep order.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) was
booed and pelted with tomatoes by an angry
crowd, and no one could recall the last time
that happened to a Kennedy in
Massachusetts.
Late Tuesday, Boston Mayor Kevin White
called on Judge Garrity to provide 120
federal marshals to restore order; the police
can no longer do the job alone.
Not Southern Phenomenon
It's been years since protest of such
magnitude has erupted in the wake of a
school desegregation order. Of course most
Americans have associated such
demonstrations and indeed, the segregation
problem with the Southern states.

But study after study has shown the high
percentage of school districts desegregated in
the South, and the correspondingly low
percentage desegregated in the North.
What has been the result of desegregation
efforts in the North? Everyone remembers
the surprising victory by George Wallace in
the 1972 Michigan primary, in the wake of
school busing controversy there. And now we
have the South Boston protests.
Children's Rights
There has been some contention that the
Boston protestors are merely defending their
children's right to attend the schools nearest
(or "next-nearest," as the anti-busing
amendment currently before Congress has it)
their homes. But this does not ring true.
The protesters aren't massed in the black
neighborhoods, trying to stop the buses from
white neighborhoods. Nor are they forcibly
preventing buses from leaving South Boston
bearing white children. (Although, of course,
many parents, black and white, are keeping
their children home.)
The protestors are lining the streets of
South Boston, with what appears to be a
single purpose: keeping thier schools
"lily-white". (Remember that phrase?) The
efforts are directed at keeping blacks out. Or
as the demonstrator quoted earlier put it,
"There's one, get him!"
The theme, often expressed jokingly, is a
common one in White "liberal" society: "I'm
in favor of integration as long as it doesn't
happen on my block."
