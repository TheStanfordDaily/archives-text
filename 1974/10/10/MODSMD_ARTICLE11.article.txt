# Title IX And Athletic Opportunities
## 
### Meg Halloran 
The Stanford women, that's
women, are beginning to learn
how to use their big gun, Title IX
of the Education Amendments
Act of 1972. The law says simply:
"No person in the United
States shall on the basis of sex be
excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under
any education program or activity
receiving Federal financial
assistance."
In this case, involving athletics,
the Stanford men have: a nice big
crew team (80 turned out this
fall), a few "fours" (boats), seven
"eights" (bigger boats, two of
which, the best two, are tucked
safely away from the rigors of
practice in storage for the spring
racing season), $4500 in expense
funds from the University,
another bundle in alumni gifts
each year, space for the boats for
a token fee from Redwood City
and free maintenance for the
boats and their accoutrements.
The women' s crew "team"
with about 35 members, has:
none of the above. But with the
support of the Organization of
Stanford Athletes, these women
are beginning to ask questions.
They are going through the
appropriate channels and learning
how to use the legal muscle Title
IX gives them.
Meeting On Issue
On Oct. 3, the crew issue got as
far as a meeting between the
women interested in crew, and
Athletic Director Joseph Reutz, a
lawyer and loyal crew alumnus
named Ken Mitchell and the
student Steering Committee of
the men's crew team. Reutz began
the meeting by asking questions
about the numbers of men and
women interested in crew, the
facilities for each team, practice
times, etc.

Discussion proceeded on the
numerous "logistical" hurdles
preventing the women from
enjoying equal opportunity ( any
opportunity, to be specific) in
crew. Reutz commited himself to
fund-raising, the men commited
themselves to helping with the
women's weight training and
running and Mitchell commited
himself to an investigation of the
logistics.
Mid-cool, controlled discussion
somewhere, one woman says,
"Wait a minute! You're forgetting
the whole point. Paragraph 86.38
(3) in Title IX says:
'A recipient . . . shall not
discriminate on the basis of sex in
the provision of necessary
equipment or supplies for each
team, or in any other manner.'
"Right now, 80 men use all the
boats, and the women have
nothing. We want to be out in the
boats this fall, and it seems that
the only way this is going to
happen is to have the men cut
back their team."
Comment Causes Furor
A mild furor erupts among the
men.
"No, we couldn't do that.
Crew is a Tradition at Stanford. If
we cut back the team now, we'd
probably do really poorly in the
spring competitions.
"And if we did poorly in
competition, we'd probably upset
a lot of the alumni who are proud
of Stanford's crew, and then we
might lose their gifts!"
Reutz Agrees
Reutz concurred, adding:
"We certainly don't want, and
I'm sure the women don't want,
to reduce the ability of the crew
team to compete successfully.
There are a number of
considerations, but I'm sure we'll
be able to arrive at a solution to
the problem. I'm sure the women

don't want to see the men lose
their competitive status."
The women nodded. They
really didn't want to make the
men sacrifice something they have
enjoyed for so long.
But. . .then. . .still. . .the women
were nowhere.
Suddenly Mitchell gave birth to
a solution. We'll raise some money
now and order a few new boats
for delivery in the spring. That
way, the two good boats can be
released for use now (by the men)
and the women could use two
practice boats this fall! Eureka!
The solution limps a little, but it's
a start.
Other Sports?
Now if only something could
be done about the discrimination
going on right now in swimming,
track and basketball. At the new
DeGuerre pool complex, for
example, the men have a gneral
shower room, a team room with
lockers and a coaches' dressing
room, in which the new isokinetic
strength-building machine for
swimmers is housed. The women
have a general changing room with
showers. No lockers, no coahces'
dressing room, no access to the
isokinetic machine.
The men's track team works
out every afternoon in prime
practice time. The women's track
team practices on Tuesdays and
Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 12
p.m. prime class time.
The women play basketball in
the women's gym, where there is
no spectator space. The men play
in Maples, where there is room for
plenty of spectators.
Wasn't there a line in Title IX
somewhere about the availability
of equal athletic opportunities for
both sexes? Ah well, these things
take time, and well, in the end,
it's all in the game anyway. In
fact, play a little game right now.

Go back to the beginning of this
story and substitute "blacks" and
"whites" for "women" and
"men." Whose side holds up?
Title IX is new. The men are
jittery about the threats it poses
to their power and monopoly over
the athletic system at Stanford.
The women are unused to the
power that Title IX gives them to
claim their rights. The women
have just passed "go" and are on
square one. But they are bucking
the whole bureaucracy.
If you'd like to help, jojn the
Organization of Stanford
Athletes, the equal rights team.

Mid-cool, controlled discussion
somewhere, one woman says,
"Wait a minute! You're forgetting
the whole point. Paragraph 86.38
(3) in Title IX says:
'A recipient . . . shall not
discriminate on the basis of sex in
the provision of necessary

"Right now, 80 men use all the

nothing. We want to be out in the

back their team."
Comment Causes Furor
A mild furor erupts among the
men.
"No, we couldn't do that.
Crew is a Tradition at Stanford. If
we cut back the team now, we'd
probably do really poorly in the
spring competitions.
"And if we did poorly in
competition, we'd probably upset
a lot of the alumni who are proud
of Stanford's crew, and then we
might lose their gifts!"
Reutz Agrees
Reutz concurred, adding:
"We certainly don't want, and
I'm sure the women don't want,
to reduce the ability of the crew
team to compete successfully.
There are a number of
considerations, but I'm sure we'll
be able to arrive at a solution to
the problem. I'm sure the women

don't want to see the men lose
their competitive status."
The women nodded. They
really didn't want to make the
men sacrifice something they have
enjoyed for so long.
But. . .then. . .still. . .the women
were nowhere.
Suddenly Mitchell gave birth to
a solution. We'll raise some money
now and order a few new boats
for delivery in the spring. That
way, the two good boats can be
released for use now (by the men)
and the women could use two
practice boats this fall! Eureka!
The solution limps a little, but it's
a start.
Other Sports?
Now if only something could
be done about the discrimination
going on right now in swimming,
track and basketball. At the new
DeGuerre pool complex, for
example, the men have a gneral
shower room, a team room with
lockers and a coaches' dressing
room, in which the new isokinetic
strength-building machine for
swimmers is housed. The women
have a general changing room with
showers. No lockers, no coahces'
dressing room, no access to the
isokinetic machine.
The men's track team works
out every afternoon in prime
practice time. The women's track
team practices on Tuesdays and
Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 12
p.m. prime class time.
The women play basketball in
the women's gym, where there is
no spectator space. The men play
in Maples, where there is room for
plenty of spectators.
Wasn't there a line in Title IX
somewhere about the availability
of equal athletic opportunities for
both sexes? Ah well, these things
take time, and well, in the end,
it's all in the game anyway. In
fact, play a little game right now.

Go back to the beginning of this
story and substitute "blacks" and
"whites" for "women" and
"men." Whose side holds up?
Title IX is new. The men are
jittery about the threats it poses
to their power and monopoly over
the athletic system at Stanford.
The women are unused to the
power that Title IX gives them to
claim their rights. The women
have just passed "go" and are on
square one. But they are bucking
the whole bureaucracy.
If you'd like to help, jojn the
Organization of Stanford
Athletes, the equal rights team.

student in communications.)
The Stanford women, that's
women, are beginning to learn
how to use their big gun, Title IX
of the Education Amendments
Act of 1972. The law says simply:
"No person in the United
States shall on the basis of sex be
excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under
any education program or activity
receiving Federal financial
assistance."
In this case, involving athletics,
the Stanford men have: a nice big
crew team (80 turned out this
fall), a few "fours" (boats), seven
"eights" (bigger boats, two of
which, the best two, are tucked
safely away from the rigors of
practice in storage for the spring
racing season), $4500 in expense
funds from the University,
another bundle in alumni gifts
each year, space for the boats for
a token fee from Redwood City
and free maintenance for the
boats and their accoutrements.
The women' s crew "team"
with about 35 members, has:
none of the above. But with the
support of the Organization of
Stanford Athletes, these women
are beginning to ask questions.
They are going through the
appropriate channels and learning

released for use now (by the men)
and the women could use two
practice boats this fall! Eureka!
The solution limps a little, but it's
a start.
Other Sports?
Now if only something could
be done about the discrimination
going on right now in swimming,
track and basketball. At the new
DeGuerre pool complex, for
example, the men have a gneral
shower room, a team room with
lockers and a coaches' dressing
room, in which the new isokinetic
strength-building machine for
swimmers is housed. The women
have a general changing room with
showers. No lockers, no coahces'
dressing room, no access to the
isokinetic machine.
The men's track team works
out every afternoon in prime
practice time. The women's track
team practices on Tuesdays and
Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 12
p.m. prime class time.
The women play basketball in
the women's gym, where there is
no spectator space. The men play
in Maples, where there is room for
plenty of spectators.
Wasn't there a line in Title IX
somewhere about the availability
of equal athletic opportunities for
both sexes? Ah well, these things
take time, and well, in the end,
it's all in the game anyway. In
fact, play a little game right now.

Go back to the beginning of this
story and substitute "blacks" and
"whites" for "women" and
"men." Whose side holds up?
Title IX is new. The men are
jittery about the threats it poses
to their power and monopoly over
the athletic system at Stanford.
The women are unused to the
power that Title IX gives them to
claim their rights. The women
have just passed "go" and are on
square one. But they are bucking
the whole bureaucracy.
If you'd like to help, jojn the
Organization of Stanford
Athletes, the equal rights team.
(Meg Halloran is a graduate

The Stanford women, that's
women, are beginning to learn
how to use their big gun, Title IX
of the Education Amendments
Act of 1972. The law says simply:
"No person in the United
States shall on the basis of sex be
excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under
any education program or activity
receiving Federal financial
assistance."
In this case, involving athletics,
the Stanford men have: a nice big
crew team (80 turned out this
fall), a few "fours" (boats), seven
"eights" (bigger boats, two of
which, the best two, are tucked
safely away from the rigors of
practice in storage for the spring
racing season), $4500 in expense
funds from the University,
another bundle in alumni gifts
each year, space for the boats for
a token fee from Redwood City
and free maintenance for the
boats and their accoutrements.
The women' s crew "team"
with about 35 members, has:
none of the above. But with the
support of the Organization of
Stanford Athletes, these women
are beginning to ask questions.
They are going through the
appropriate channels and learning
how to use the legal muscle Title
IX gives them.
Meeting On Issue
On Oct. 3, the crew issue got as
far as a meeting between the
women interested in crew, and
Athletic Director Joseph Reutz, a
lawyer and loyal crew alumnus
named Ken Mitchell and the
student Steering Committee of
the men's crew team. Reutz began
the meeting by asking questions
about the numbers of men and
women interested in crew, the
facilities for each team, practice
times, etc.

Discussion proceeded on the
numerous "logistical" hurdles
preventing the women from
enjoying equal opportunity ( any
opportunity, to be specific) in
crew. Reutz commited himself to
fund-raising, the men commited
themselves to helping with the
women's weight training and
running and Mitchell commited
himself to an investigation of the
logistics.
Mid-cool, controlled discussion
somewhere, one woman says,
"Wait a minute! You're forgetting
the whole point. Paragraph 86.38
(3) in Title IX says:
'A recipient . . . shall not
discriminate on the basis of sex in
the provision of necessary
equipment or supplies for each
team, or in any other manner.'
"Right now, 80 men use all the
boats, and the women have
nothing. We want to be out in the
boats this fall, and it seems that
the only way this is going to
happen is to have the men cut
back their team."
Comment Causes Furor
A mild furor erupts among the
men.
"No, we couldn't do that.
Crew is a Tradition at Stanford. If
we cut back the team now, we'd
probably do really poorly in the
spring competitions.
"And if we did poorly in
competition, we'd probably upset
a lot of the alumni who are proud
of Stanford's crew, and then we
might lose their gifts!"
Reutz Agrees
Reutz concurred, adding:
"We certainly don't want, and
I'm sure the women don't want,
to reduce the ability of the crew
team to compete successfully.
There are a number of
considerations, but I'm sure we'll
be able to arrive at a solution to
the problem. I'm sure the women

don't want to see the men lose
their competitive status."
The women nodded. They
really didn't want to make the
men sacrifice something they have
enjoyed for so long.
But. . .then. . .still. . .the women
were nowhere.
Suddenly Mitchell gave birth to
a solution. We'll raise some money
now and order a few new boats
for delivery in the spring. That
way, the two good boats can be
released for use now (by the men)
and the women could use two
practice boats this fall! Eureka!
The solution limps a little, but it's
