						Bold Housing Step

Threats posed to the future of
independent housing at Stanford
by a realization of the University's
30-year-old discriminatory policy
toward women may turn out to
be blessings, after all.
Though provisions of Title IX
of the federal Educational
Amendments Act of 1972 were
originally thought to sound the
death knell for the only truly
independent houses remaining at
Stanford (fraternities), awareness
is growing that the changes which
must come to comply with the
law instead may provide for a
greater number of students to
escape from the dreaded housing
draw.
As word of the impending
crisis spread from the confines of
a "working group" formed by
Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton which saw no
alternative to assimilation of
remaining independent houses
into the draw, new ideas have
arisen. The 1944 ban on sororities
need not lead to a 1974 death of
their male counterparts.
Hope has been expressed by
many that this last vestige of
genuine diversity in Stanford's
housing system not now be
quashed. In fact, proponents of a
pluralistic residential alignment
see as an alternative to its demise
the expansion of the benefits of
independent living to new campus
groups.
Wilbur-Stern Alienation
Such an extension of the
amenities and responsibiliteis of
independence to other groups
under some valid intellectual,
academic or fraternal criteria in
keeping with the goals of the
University may, in fact, help solve
one of Stanford's greatest
problems: Wilbur-Stern alienation.
Much cynicism builds annually
in those trapped inside the stark
confines of some dormitories.
These are the persons Stanford
has forgotten. They have been
fortunate enough to gain a room
on campus, but have been
condemned by an impersonal
draw to life in an impersonal
boarding house.
In such halls are adjoining
residents often not neighbors but
simply competitors in the
classroom. And the classroom, in
turn, may be the only place in
which dorm residents feel a part
of Stanford.
Such is the tragedy of this
University. The mass of its
residential education program is
so unfulfilling that undergraduate
instruction here cannot hold a
candle to that at similarly
prestigious institutions such as
Harvard.
Can Take A Step
But now we can take a step
toward changing this sorry state.
We can provide a means for
those willing to put forth the
effort to escape the dorm rut and
win entry into a congenial setting.
We can allow living groups,
even those in dormitories if they
so desire, to form
self-perpetuating units apart from
the coldness of the housing
system. We can allow them to
select their members to insure
cohesiveness, and can exempt
them from the perils of draw
eviction to insure continuity.
In short, we can reassert our
commitment to residential
education by taking a bold step to
insure the future of independent
on-campus living.
The alternative is to destroy
the independent houses which
now exist and to incorporate
more students into a lottery
which is the yearly scourge of this
campus.
Let's not sanctify such an
abominable failure.
