## 80 Years Old And Still Cookin" Eating Clubs Rescue Dorm Diners 
### DANIEL GURNEY 
If you suspect that Tresidder's Ph.D.
burgers are concocted from the recycled
cellulose of old theses, and if you find the
entrees at Hie Commons to be
supernaturally uninspired, you are part of a
great Stanford tradition: poor food service.
Back in the days when the trolley car
ran down Palm Drive between Stanford
and Palo Alto, students could find nothing
worth eating to spread their butter on. So
they put it to use on the rails of the trolley
car, finding its superior lubricating qualities
good enough to make the trolley's wheels
spin.
Thus immobilized, the trolley made a
fine target for rotten food service eggs,
tomatoes, and prunes. Using notes
prepared by Inter-Club Council President
Steve Haggblade, University archivist Ralph
Hansen combined some Stanford history
with a history of the eating clubs last
Thursday in a talk before members of the
present day clubs.
Lousy Food
Thin, cold soup, stale bread, and tough
meat are not new to Stanford. Bland food
goes back to 1891, the year instruction
began here. By 1894, lousy food drove
students to create the first eating club on
the west coast, the Brookfarm Eating Club.
Brookfarm began the concept of eating
clubs at Stanford, which have operated
almost continuously since the turn of the
century. Besides serving decent food,
eating clubs offer their members a lasting
and active social group that occupies the
middle ground between dorm and frat life.
The University has never put decent
food service high on its list of priorities.
For example, Mrs. Leland Stanford decided
that Encina Hall needed a game room when
Encina men indulged in such antics as
snaking a firehose through the bannister,
watching it splinter as the hose filled and
straightened with water. 1898 she
converted the dining hall into a pool room.
Unmellow Yellow
This left Encina men with only one
source of on-campus food, the Stanford

Inn. Painted an outrageous yellow, the
Stanford Inn could serve only two-thirds of
the men living at Encina, although from
the records they left, it was probably never
full.
In 1910, one Encina man wrote, "To
the average outsider, the college man is a
care-free individual, whose only troubles
are summed up in three words
professors, girls, and income. However . ..
frequently beneath his calm and serene
exterior are harbored tribulations. . . .
"The most vital grievances which afflicts
the Encina man of Stanford today is the
same that has ever afflicted him since the
founding of the University the need for
eating houses near the Hall."
'Continual Prunes'
The men who could not stomach
"continual prunes" served at the Stanford
Inn formed eating clubs on College
Terrace, a mile away. Entirely student-run,
these clubs grew and prospered. Eating
clubs offered a group spirit that a cafeteria
food service could not imitate.
As an eating clubber wrote in 1910,
"Does it seem unnatural that a man should
prefer eating at his own club among
particular friends, where the friendly
kicking at the manager's efficiency, and an
occasional water fight . . . changes a
monotonous meal into a social gathering?"
The long walk to College Terrace proved
to be doubly inconvenient. Not only was it
time-consuming, but "when a mile walk is
given as an appetizer, the effect cannot be
overestimated. As soon as a man was seated
at the table ... he begins to annahilate the
supply of everything edible within reach.
'Startling Speed'
"And the speed with which the food is
consumed is indeed startling, especially
when a man had to think of getting back to
the chemistry building or some other far
away place in time for his next class." *
The eating clubs eventually found their
way on campus. In 1912 three eating clubs
were housed in a building called "Little
Quad" which stood on the ground now
used as Encina's parking lot. When it was

built in 1921, Encina Commons housed
four other eating clubs.
During WW 11, the Little Quad was
condemned and torn down. The three
homeless clubs decided to join forces with
the four in Encina, and they formed a
federation of seven clubs. These seven paid
for the present building which now houses
the clubs.
The clubs did not lose their autonomy
by moving on campus. Students still hire
the cooks, order the food, plan the menus,
and maintain the buildings and grounds.
First Dope Arrests
Being student run, the eating clubs have
been among the "progressive" forces on
campus. If it's new and if it's neat, the
eating clubs are doing it. The Stanford

police made their first on-campus
marihuana arrests at the Breakers Eating
Club in 1968. The charges were dropped,
however, when the judge ruled Breakers is
private property which police needed a
search warrant to enter.
The eating clubs were among the first
campus social organizations to go co-ed. El
Cuadro went co-ed in 1965, Breakers in
1966.
It's been eighty years since Stanford's
first eating club opened, and they are still
going strong. Los Arcos formed in 1901,
Breakers in 1910, and the others have been
operating since before WW I. They have a
longevity unknown to Stanford-operated
food services. But then, they serve good
food.

used as Encina's parking lot. When it was

built in 1921, Encina Commons housed
four other eating clubs.
During WW 11, the Little Quad was
condemned and torn down. The three
homeless clubs decided to join forces with
the four in Encina, and they formed a
federation of seven clubs. These seven paid
for the present building which now houses
the clubs.
The clubs did not lose their autonomy
by moving on campus. Students still hire
the cooks, order the food, plan the menus,
and maintain the buildings and grounds.
First Dope Arrests
Being student run, the eating clubs have
been among the "progressive" forces on
campus. If it's new and if it's neat, the
eating clubs are doing it. The Stanford

police made their first on-campus
marihuana arrests at the Breakers Eating
Club in 1968. The charges were dropped,
however, when the judge ruled Breakers is
private property which police needed a
search warrant to enter.
The eating clubs were among the first
campus social organizations to go co-ed. El
Cuadro went co-ed in 1965, Breakers in
1966.
It's been eighty years since Stanford's
first eating club opened, and they are still
going strong. Los Arcos formed in 1901,
Breakers in 1910, and the others have been
operating since before WW I. They have a
longevity unknown to Stanford-operated
food services. But then, they serve good

RELAXED DINING—Eating clubs, a feature on campus since 1912, offer members
less-structured, student-run meal programs and also serve as a social group.
If you suspect that Tresidder's Ph.D.
burgers are concocted from the recycled
cellulose of old theses, and if you find the
entrees at Hie Commons to be
supernaturally uninspired, you are part of a
great Stanford tradition: poor food service.
Back in the days when the trolley car
ran down Palm Drive between Stanford
and Palo Alto, students could find nothing
worth eating to spread their butter on. So
they put it to use on the rails of the trolley
car, finding its superior lubricating qualities
good enough to make the trolley's wheels
spin.
Thus immobilized, the trolley made a
fine target for rotten food service eggs,
tomatoes, and prunes. Using notes
prepared by Inter-Club Council President
Steve Haggblade, University archivist Ralph
Hansen combined some Stanford history
with a history of the eating clubs last
Thursday in a talk before members of the
present day clubs.
Lousy Food
Thin, cold soup, stale bread, and tough
meat are not new to Stanford. Bland food
goes back to 1891, the year instruction
began here. By 1894, lousy food drove
students to create the first eating club on
the west coast, the Brookfarm Eating Club.
Brookfarm began the concept of eating
clubs at Stanford, which have operated
almost continuously since the turn of the
century. Besides serving decent food,
eating clubs offer their members a lasting
and active social group that occupies the
middle ground between dorm and frat life.
The University has never put decent
food service high on its list of priorities.
For example, Mrs. Leland Stanford decided
that Encina Hall needed a game room when
Encina men indulged in such antics as
snaking a firehose through the bannister,
watching it splinter as the hose filled and
straightened with water. 1898 she
converted the dining hall into a pool room.
Unmellow Yellow
This left Encina men with only one
source of on-campus food, the Stanford

Inn. Painted an outrageous yellow, the
Stanford Inn could serve only two-thirds of
the men living at Encina, although from
the records they left, it was probably never
full.
In 1910, one Encina man wrote, "To
the average outsider, the college man is a
care-free individual, whose only troubles
are summed up in three words
professors, girls, and income. However . ..
frequently beneath his calm and serene
exterior are harbored tribulations. . . .
"The most vital grievances which afflicts
the Encina man of Stanford today is the
same that has ever afflicted him since the
founding of the University the need for
eating houses near the Hall."
'Continual Prunes'
The men who could not stomach
"continual prunes" served at the Stanford
Inn formed eating clubs on College
Terrace, a mile away. Entirely student-run,
these clubs grew and prospered. Eating
clubs offered a group spirit that a cafeteria
food service could not imitate.
As an eating clubber wrote in 1910,
"Does it seem unnatural that a man should
prefer eating at his own club among
particular friends, where the friendly
kicking at the manager's efficiency, and an
occasional water fight . . . changes a
monotonous meal into a social gathering?"
The long walk to College Terrace proved
to be doubly inconvenient. Not only was it
time-consuming, but "when a mile walk is
given as an appetizer, the effect cannot be
overestimated. As soon as a man was seated
at the table ... he begins to annahilate the
supply of everything edible within reach.
'Startling Speed'
"And the speed with which the food is
consumed is indeed startling, especially
when a man had to think of getting back to
the chemistry building or some other far
away place in time for his next class." *
The eating clubs eventually found their
way on campus. In 1912 three eating clubs
were housed in a building called "Little

are summed up in three words
professors, girls, and income. However . ..
frequently beneath his calm and serene
exterior are harbored tribulations. . . .
"The most vital grievances which afflicts
the Encina man of Stanford today is the
same that has ever afflicted him since the
founding of the University the need for
eating houses near the Hall."
'Continual Prunes'
The men who could not stomach
"continual prunes" served at the Stanford
Inn formed eating clubs on College
Terrace, a mile away. Entirely student-run,
these clubs grew and prospered. Eating
clubs offered a group spirit that a cafeteria
food service could not imitate.
As an eating clubber wrote in 1910,
"Does it seem unnatural that a man should
prefer eating at his own club among
particular friends, where the friendly
kicking at the manager's efficiency, and an
occasional water fight . . . changes a
monotonous meal into a social gathering?"
The long walk to College Terrace proved
to be doubly inconvenient. Not only was it
time-consuming, but "when a mile walk is
given as an appetizer, the effect cannot be
overestimated. As soon as a man was seated
at the table ... he begins to annahilate the
supply of everything edible within reach.
'Startling Speed'
"And the speed with which the food is
consumed is indeed startling, especially
when a man had to think of getting back to
the chemistry building or some other far
away place in time for his next class." *
The eating clubs eventually found their
way on campus. In 1912 three eating clubs
were housed in a building called "Little
Quad" which stood on the ground now
used as Encina's parking lot. When it was

built in 1921, Encina Commons housed
four other eating clubs.
During WW 11, the Little Quad was
condemned and torn down. The three
homeless clubs decided to join forces with
the four in Encina, and they formed a
federation of seven clubs. These seven paid
for the present building which now houses
the clubs.
The clubs did not lose their autonomy
by moving on campus. Students still hire
the cooks, order the food, plan the menus,
and maintain the buildings and grounds.
First Dope Arrests
Being student run, the eating clubs have
been among the "progressive" forces on
campus. If it's new and if it's neat, the
eating clubs are doing it. The Stanford

police made their first on-campus
marihuana arrests at the Breakers Eating
Club in 1968. The charges were dropped,
however, when the judge ruled Breakers is
private property which police needed a
search warrant to enter.
The eating clubs were among the first
campus social organizations to go co-ed. El
Cuadro went co-ed in 1965, Breakers in
1966.
It's been eighty years since Stanford's
first eating club opened, and they are still
going strong. Los Arcos formed in 1901,
Breakers in 1910, and the others have been
operating since before WW I. They have a
longevity unknown to Stanford-operated
food services. But then, they serve good
food.

RELAXED DINING—Eating clubs, a feature on campus since 1912, offer members
less-structured, student-run meal programs and also serve as a social group.
If you suspect that Tresidder's Ph.D.
burgers are concocted from the recycled
cellulose of old theses, and if you find the
entrees at Hie Commons to be
supernaturally uninspired, you are part of a
great Stanford tradition: poor food service.
Back in the days when the trolley car
ran down Palm Drive between Stanford
and Palo Alto, students could find nothing
worth eating to spread their butter on. So
they put it to use on the rails of the trolley
car, finding its superior lubricating qualities
good enough to make the trolley's wheels
spin.
Thus immobilized, the trolley made a
fine target for rotten food service eggs,
tomatoes, and prunes. Using notes
prepared by Inter-Club Council President
Steve Haggblade, University archivist Ralph
Hansen combined some Stanford history
with a history of the eating clubs last
Thursday in a talk before members of the
present day clubs.
Lousy Food
Thin, cold soup, stale bread, and tough
meat are not new to Stanford. Bland food
goes back to 1891, the year instruction
began here. By 1894, lousy food drove
students to create the first eating club on
the west coast, the Brookfarm Eating Club.
Brookfarm began the concept of eating
clubs at Stanford, which have operated
almost continuously since the turn of the
century. Besides serving decent food,
eating clubs offer their members a lasting
and active social group that occupies the
middle ground between dorm and frat life.
The University has never put decent
food service high on its list of priorities.
For example, Mrs. Leland Stanford decided
that Encina Hall needed a game room when
Encina men indulged in such antics as
snaking a firehose through the bannister,
watching it splinter as the hose filled and
straightened with water. 1898 she
converted the dining hall into a pool room.
Unmellow Yellow
This left Encina men with only one
source of on-campus food, the Stanford

Inn. Painted an outrageous yellow, the
Stanford Inn could serve only two-thirds of
the men living at Encina, although from
the records they left, it was probably never
full.
In 1910, one Encina man wrote, "To
the average outsider, the college man is a
care-free individual, whose only troubles
are summed up in three words
professors, girls, and income. However . ..
frequently beneath his calm and serene
