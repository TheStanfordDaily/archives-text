Why aren't there enough student tickets available for the UCLA
game? —C.B.
The football team is going to have to make it on its own Saturday
at UCLA. At least it can't expect much of a supportive rooting
section, according to Bette G. Robertson, ticket manager of the
Athletic Department.
Students only bought 400 tickets during registration which
prompted the ticket office to "assume students weren't interested,"
Robertson said. She saved nearly 600 additional tickets for students
but about 10 days ago she had to open the rest of the Stanford
section to those desiring reserved seats.
The sudden rush for tickets after the Michigan game was just too
late to alter the number of student tickets, according to Assoc.
Athletic Director Bob Young.
You can Still get a ticket, however, if you're willing to pay $7.00
for a reserved seat. Buy it today, though, because Robertson has to
return the unsold tickets to UCLA before the game.
Buy Big Game tickets now too because the same thing will happen
with the Berkeley tickets if you wait until the last minute, Robertson
urged.

Why weren't freshmen women who planned to participate in
intercollegiate sports allowed to have their physicals during
orientation like the freshmen men? —T.F. W.F.H.P.
Cowell Student Health Center couldn't fit the freshmen field
hockey players in is the blaring answer Bug discovered after
scrutinizing the schedule of physicals.
The varsity men's teams, who came back early, had their physicals
before orientation. Cowell expected 95 freshmen football and soccer
players Sept. 25 and 95 returning varsity women Sept. 26.
Cowell can't handle more than two sets of physicals per week,
according to registered nurse Jo Wells.
The freshmen women were probably postponed until the following
week as their files take longer to put together. The Athletic
Department doesn't know who the women are going to be, Wells sqid,
while the freshmen men are recruited.
Women's Athletic Dept. Chairman Pamela-Straitharn said including
an indicative card for varsity hopefuls in the acceptance letter was "an
idea" she would look into.
She also said women can't try out for teams before physicals for
insurance reasons. Cowell Director James B. McClenahan said some
teams did allow tryouts without previous physicals, however.

section, according to Bette G. Robertson, ticket manager of the
Athletic Department.
Students only bought 400 tickets during registration which
prompted the ticket office to "assume students weren't interested,"
Robertson said. She saved nearly 600 additional tickets for students
but about 10 days ago she had to open the rest of the Stanford
section to those desiring reserved seats.
The sudden rush for tickets after the Michigan game was just too
late to alter the number of student tickets, according to Assoc.
Athletic Director Bob Young.
You can Still get a ticket, however, if you're willing to pay $7.00
for a reserved seat. Buy it today, though, because Robertson has to
return the unsold tickets to UCLA before the game.
Buy Big Game tickets now too because the same thing will happen
with the Berkeley tickets if you wait until the last minute, Robertson
urged.

Why weren't freshmen women who planned to participate in
intercollegiate sports allowed to have their physicals during
orientation like the freshmen men? —T.F. W.F.H.P.
Cowell Student Health Center couldn't fit the freshmen field
hockey players in is the blaring answer Bug discovered after
scrutinizing the schedule of physicals.
The varsity men's teams, who came back early, had their physicals
before orientation. Cowell expected 95 freshmen football and soccer
players Sept. 25 and 95 returning varsity women Sept. 26.
Cowell can't handle more than two sets of physicals per week,
according to registered nurse Jo Wells.
The freshmen women were probably postponed until the following
week as their files take longer to put together. The Athletic
Department doesn't know who the women are going to be, Wells sqid,
while the freshmen men are recruited.
Women's Athletic Dept. Chairman Pamela-Straitharn said including
an indicative card for varsity hopefuls in the acceptance letter was "an
idea" she would look into.
She also said women can't try out for teams before physicals for
insurance reasons. Cowell Director James B. McClenahan said some
teams did allow tryouts without previous physicals, however.

Why aren't there enough student tickets available for the UCLA
game? —C.B.
The football team is going to have to make it on its own Saturday
at UCLA. At least it can't expect much of a supportive rooting
section, according to Bette G. Robertson, ticket manager of the
