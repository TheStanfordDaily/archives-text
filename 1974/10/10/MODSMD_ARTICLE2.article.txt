# 'Live Oak' Gets $500 Loan
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The University will loan Live Oak
enough money to pay for typesetting
the next two issues of the newspaper,
the Dean of Student Affairs' Office
said yesterday.
The loan, not to exceed $5OO,
represents a compromise, said Dale
Snape, assistant dean of student
affairs. Live Oak has asked for $2OOO.
"There was considerable debate"
among the Campus Affairs staff over
the loan, Snape said. "I would say the
staff agreed this is the best position to
take."
Snape said the staff was reluctant

to commit so much money to a
publication it considered a financial
risk. "But most people were not very
happy with the idea of just saying
right out 'we don't want anything to
do with it,' " he said.
Live Oak editor Bill Weinstein said
the paper would have plenty of money
once it collected for October
advertising, but until then cash would
be tight.
"Just say I'm very happy over it,"
he said last night. "Whatever
happened, I'm happy."
Weinstein said the loan would solve
his problem in obtaining credit frohi

the ASSU Typesetting Shop, but
indicated he still wasn't sure if the
paper had enough cash on hand to pay
printing costs.

"I don't know how much
advertising money has come in," he
said. "I know it's a substantial
amount... I can't say anything right
now. We're just living week to week."
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri, who opposed loaning Live
Oak anything, said he didn't think the
reduced loan would help the paper
very much.
"I don't think it would [get Live
Oak through its current problems]
unless Weinstein and his staff really
work super hard to impress the
businesses he has ads from to try to
speed up payment," Olivieri said.
"It's my feeling that $5OO is a good
amount of money," he added. "It's
not, however, enough to tide him
over."
Olivieri, who has repeatedly said he
considers Live Oak a bad credit risk,
said he'll keep a careful watch on the
paper's financial account with the
ASSU.
Interest Free
The $5OO loan is interest free and
must be repaid during this academic
year, Snape said. In two weeks the
campus affairs staff will reevaluate the
Financial picture and may be willing to
loan Live Oak more money if things
seem to be looking up, he said.
"We realize this is risky," Snape
said. "But it's a palatable risk."
The money for the loan will come
out of funds in the Dean of Student
Affairs Office, the same office that
loaned Live Oak $5OO this summer.
Live Oak is Stanford's newest
publication. Its next issue is scheduled
to appear Friday.

Weinstein said the loan would solve
his problem in obtaining credit frohi

the ASSU Typesetting Shop, but
indicated he still wasn't sure if the
paper had enough cash on hand to pay
printing costs.

"I don't know how much
advertising money has come in," he
said. "I know it's a substantial
amount... I can't say anything right
now. We're just living week to week."
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri, who opposed loaning Live
Oak anything, said he didn't think the
reduced loan would help the paper
very much.
"I don't think it would [get Live
Oak through its current problems]
unless Weinstein and his staff really
work super hard to impress the
businesses he has ads from to try to
speed up payment," Olivieri said.
"It's my feeling that $5OO is a good
amount of money," he added. "It's
not, however, enough to tide him
over."
Olivieri, who has repeatedly said he
considers Live Oak a bad credit risk,
said he'll keep a careful watch on the
paper's financial account with the
ASSU.
Interest Free
The $5OO loan is interest free and
must be repaid during this academic
year, Snape said. In two weeks the
campus affairs staff will reevaluate the
Financial picture and may be willing to
loan Live Oak more money if things
seem to be looking up, he said.
"We realize this is risky," Snape
said. "But it's a palatable risk."
The money for the loan will come
out of funds in the Dean of Student
Affairs Office, the same office that
loaned Live Oak $5OO this summer.
Live Oak is Stanford's newest
publication. Its next issue is scheduled
to appear Friday.
The University will loan Live Oak
enough money to pay for typesetting
the next two issues of the newspaper,
the Dean of Student Affairs' Office
said yesterday.
The loan, not to exceed $5OO,
represents a compromise, said Dale
Snape, assistant dean of student
affairs. Live Oak has asked for $2OOO.
"There was considerable debate"
among the Campus Affairs staff over
the loan, Snape said. "I would say the
staff agreed this is the best position to
take."
Snape said the staff was reluctant

to commit so much money to a
publication it considered a financial
risk. "But most people were not very
happy with the idea of just saying
right out 'we don't want anything to
do with it,' " he said.
Live Oak editor Bill Weinstein said
the paper would have plenty of money
once it collected for October
advertising, but until then cash would
be tight.
"Just say I'm very happy over it,"
he said last night. "Whatever
happened, I'm happy."
Weinstein said the loan would solve
his problem in obtaining credit frohi

the ASSU Typesetting Shop, but
indicated he still wasn't sure if the
paper had enough cash on hand to pay
