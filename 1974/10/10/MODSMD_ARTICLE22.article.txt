# Police To Enforce Bike Laws
## 
### 
Campus policemen will begin citing
bicyclists who commit traffic
violations, according to Marvin
Herrington, director of police services
Officers have already begun
warning bicyclists in an attempt to gel
"as much voluntary compliance | with
traffic regulations! as possible," said
Herrington
lie added that sheets listing the
four or five most common violations
will be handed out to bicyclists in an
effort to "raise consciousness."
Herrington said after a warning
period of a few weeks, officers will
begin issuing citations
Herrington pointed out that
bicyclists are subject to the regulations
of the California Vehicle (..'ode and can
he cited for the same violations as
motorists.
He listed the most common
violations as:
failure to stop and yield the
right of way to motorists when the
bicyclist is entering or crossing a road;

—speeding,
—riding on the left aide of the road
and
improper lighting on the front
and rear of bicycles ridden at night.
Herrington said that the bicycle
must be equipped with a white
headlight that is visible for 300 feet in
front of the bicycle and a red rear
reflector that can be seen at a distance
of 300 feet. Herrington mentioned
that a red light could also be used on
the back of a bicycle, but only in
addition to the reflector, not in place
of it.
Citations to bicyclists will probably
be for moving violations. These carry a
fine of from $l5 to $25, according to
a spokesperson for the traffic division
of the Palo Alto Municipal Court.
However, the violation does not go
down on the offender's Motor Vehicle
Record. This means that auto
insurance would not be affected by
any citations a person received while
bicycling.

Herrington said that there is a "big
move county-wide to improve bicycle
regulation."
"The National Safety Council and
the Santa Clara Safety Council are
both trying to control accidents before
they happen," he said.
