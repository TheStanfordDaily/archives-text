# CROW Receives Funding, Support
## Women's Center Organizes 
### SUE LUTTNER 
After two years of crystalization,
the Center for Research On Women
(CROW) is entering its first year as a
functioning organization receiving
University funding, Psychology Prof.
Eleanor Maccoby announced
yesterday.
CROW has an office at the Center
for Interdisciplinary Research in Polya
Hall, where three staff members
coordinate its activities.
Grants from the Ford Foundation,
the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation
and the University have enabled
CROW to initiate programs aimed at
its two main objectives: promotion
and support research on women and
improving the education of women
at Stanford.
Concrete Help
"A year ago, CROW was just an
idea in the minds of some
undergraduates," office coordinator
Cindy Davis said, but now it offers
concrete help for both students and
faculty interested in women at
Stanford and women's studies.
"The real energy has come from
students," Maccoby said, emphasizing
that the organization fills a need felt
by women who were "isolated in their
departments."
The Ford Foundation grant will be
used both to support existing research

groups and to initiate new research on
women-related topics. Faculty groups
already exist to plan studies on women
in the labor force, small group
functioning and the psychology and
biology of sex differences.
CROW encourages students, faculty
and staff with other ideas to contact
the center.
Resource Center
In addition to money, CROW will
also provide an inter-disciplinary
resource center and communication
with women's studies groups at other
campuses, research coordinator Peggy
Smith said.
One of the founders of CROW,
graduate student Sue Heck, explained
that this communication is necessary
to avoid duplication of effort and to
plan projects efficiently. A group
studying child care, for example, needs
the expertise of people in economics,
law and many other departments.
Matching Funds
The grant from the Clark
Foundation has provided matching
funds which academic departments
can use to help bring women scholars
to campus for seminars, workshops or
even a single lecture.
Matina Horner, president of
Radcliffe, and Pat Graham, vice
president of Radcliffe and dean of the
Radcliffe Institute, were the first

speakers brought to the University by
this program.
The grant also allows funds for
women who are giving seminars as part
of their candidacy for faculty position,
Smith added.
Task Force
Within CROW, several student task
forces are working to improve
education for University faculty and
students involved in research on
women. This series starts today, with a
talk by Asst. Psychology
Prof. Sandra Bern, who has
studied sex roles and androgyny.
Another group will form "area
committees," which will work with
academic departments on matters of
admissions, curriculum and guidance,
information coordinator Wendy
Martyna said. And another task force

is creating a "clearinghouse" for
women's resources.
These task forces are only the
initial plans, Martyna said, "Our ideas
are unlimited." She suggested that
future groups might plan a film series,
a speakers bureau within the entire
county and possibly a Bay Area
women's studies conference.
CROW "is not meant to be an ivory
tower organization," according to
Myra Strober, assistant professor at
the Graduate School of Business and
member of the CROW policy board.
She and Maccoby emphasized that
CROW hopes to relate research efforts
with practical applications in
education.

and the University have enabled
CROW to initiate programs aimed at
its two main objectives: promotion
and support research on women and
improving the education of women
at Stanford.
Concrete Help
"A year ago, CROW was just an
idea in the minds of some
undergraduates," office coordinator
Cindy Davis said, but now it offers
concrete help for both students and
faculty interested in women at
Stanford and women's studies.
"The real energy has come from
students," Maccoby said, emphasizing
that the organization fills a need felt
by women who were "isolated in their
departments."
The Ford Foundation grant will be
used both to support existing research

groups and to initiate new research on
women-related topics. Faculty groups
already exist to plan studies on women
in the labor force, small group
functioning and the psychology and
biology of sex differences.
CROW encourages students, faculty
and staff with other ideas to contact
the center.
Resource Center
In addition to money, CROW will
also provide an inter-disciplinary
resource center and communication
with women's studies groups at other
campuses, research coordinator Peggy
Smith said.
One of the founders of CROW,
graduate student Sue Heck, explained
that this communication is necessary
to avoid duplication of effort and to
plan projects efficiently. A group
studying child care, for example, needs
the expertise of people in economics,
law and many other departments.
Matching Funds
The grant from the Clark
Foundation has provided matching
funds which academic departments
can use to help bring women scholars
to campus for seminars, workshops or
even a single lecture.
Matina Horner, president of
Radcliffe, and Pat Graham, vice
president of Radcliffe and dean of the
Radcliffe Institute, were the first

speakers brought to the University by
this program.
The grant also allows funds for
women who are giving seminars as part
of their candidacy for faculty position,
Smith added.
Task Force
Within CROW, several student task
forces are working to improve
education for University faculty and
students involved in research on
women. This series starts today, with a
talk by Asst. Psychology
Prof. Sandra Bern, who has
studied sex roles and androgyny.
Another group will form "area
committees," which will work with
academic departments on matters of
admissions, curriculum and guidance,
information coordinator Wendy
Martyna said. And another task force

is creating a "clearinghouse" for
women's resources.
These task forces are only the
initial plans, Martyna said, "Our ideas
are unlimited." She suggested that
future groups might plan a film series,
a speakers bureau within the entire
county and possibly a Bay Area
women's studies conference.
CROW "is not meant to be an ivory
tower organization," according to
Myra Strober, assistant professor at
the Graduate School of Business and
member of the CROW policy board.
She and Maccoby emphasized that
CROW hopes to relate research efforts
with practical applications in
education.
