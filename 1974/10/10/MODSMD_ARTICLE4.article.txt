# Two Stanford Reps Included
## Students To Visit Ford 
### ANN AMIOKA 
Two students here are members of a special student
committee which will present its views on national and
student problems to President Ford this December.
The committee "hopes to present the ideas and opinions
of youth and students" tb the President, according to its
chairman, senior Mike Lopez.
Ford and House Speaker Carl B. Albert (D-Okla.)
sponsored the bipartisan congressional committee which
selected the students for the program from among summer
interns working on Capitol Hill.
The President indicated in a letter to Lopez that, by
consulting the student group, he seeks to "shorten the
lengths between the academic centers of the country' and
the government."
Specific Topics
Each of the six committee members is preparing a report
for Ford on a specific topic.
Lopez, an international relations major, will write on
foreign affairs, emphasizing a "reevaluation of our foreign
aid and military commitments." This would include cutting
back military aid to Southeast Asia and making a "closer
examination" of Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's
policies, some of which Lopez called not diplomatically
sound." .
Senior economics major Dan Rubin will discuss the
special concerns in the economic field that are unique to
students and young people in general," he said. Rubin spent
his junior year at the London School of Economics and
interned last summer with Congress' Joint Economic
Committee.
Middle-Income Students
Rubin is concerned that students from middle-income
families are getting "priced out" of colleges because their
families' incomes are too high to qualify the students for
aid, but not high enough to support students at college.
Rubin also plans to bring up the social security dilemma.
"A shrinking population will support our generation"
Rubin pointed out. Therefore, we will either receive less
than Social Security or pay a "massive sum."
"It's not certain that government is preparing for this
eventuality," Rubin said.

Denise Dillard, student body president at UC-Berkeley,
will report on job training and primary education for
blacks, chicanos and other minorities.
Prison reform and specific topics concerning the
environment will be handled by Josh Bolten of Princeton,
while Libby Lazarus of Harvard will discuss the
environment in general.
Michael Kaufman, a member of the board of directors of
the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard,
will report on education.
Better Reception
Both Lopez and Rubin agreed that Ford would give
them a better reception than former President Richard
Nixon might have. Rubin observed that the Ford
Administration has been "very open to all groups,"
including women, blacks and other minorities.
"I think they will be [open] to students too" Rubin
said.
Lopez agreed, saying he is "optimistic that we'll make a
good impression ... We have a group of high power people
... that is, academically superior ... a super group."
Rubin said which students go to Washington, D.C. didn't
matter as much the fact that there hre students going who
will begin what Rubin hopes will become "a dialogue
between the White House and young people in general."
Need For Ideas
Lopez stressed the need for other students to contribute
their ideas. "We want more than our opinion." Such
"input" would help in "identifying and dealing with
problems of national concern," said Lopez.
Lopez and Presidential Appointments Secretary William
Rustand have been negotiating the meeting originally
scheduled for the end of the summer. Rustand postponed
the get-together because more urgent matters merited the
President's more immediate attention.
"It was hard," admitted Lopez, "because the President's
schedule was always changing." However, a phone call from
Rustand has made the December meeting "about as definite
as anything with the White House can be," commented
Rubin.
