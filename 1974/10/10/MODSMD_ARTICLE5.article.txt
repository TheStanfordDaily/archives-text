# Frats May Bargain In Housing Dispute
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Fraternities "are in a position of
bargaining" with the University
regarding potential changes in their
draw-exemption status,
Inter-fraternity Council President
Michael Nilsson said last night.
We're not in a position "to divulge
what we'll accept," he added.
Nilsson's remarks came during a
meeting about the draw-exemption
status at Toyon Lounge attended by
75 people.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton outlined the complex
issues and Fielded questions about
possible alterations in the housing
system during this latest meeting.
Can Overrule
Though "University policy has
required" all coed residences to be in
the housing draw, there is "no reason
we cannot overrule what we've done in
the past," Horton said.
Last spring, Alpha Sigma Phi, a
coed fraternity within the draw,
requested to be exempt from the
draw, but their proposal was
unanimously turned down by the
Committee on Services to Students
(COSS).
In their First meeting this year,
members of COSS did not decide
Tuesday how to handle the issue,
Horton said. COSS will meet again
next Tuesday.
Mike Higgins, an alumnus of Theta
Delta Chi, outlined the importance of
fraternities maintaining their
draw-exemption status and selectivity
of future members.
No Continuity
"I don't think we [fraternities] will
be able to keep continuity" under the
draw system, Higgins said. He noted
that fraternities would undergo a 50
percent turnover each year under the
draw, rather than the 33 to 35 percent
rate they do now.
Higgins said that Theta Delta Chi,
because of the proportion of seniors in
the house, experienced 50 percent
turnover two years ago. "I don't think
we could have survived it two years in
a row," he added.
Nilsson and Higgins also pointed
out that fraternities within the draw,
such as Alpha Sigma Phi, were
generally not as strong as those outside
the draw.
Numerous questions arose regarding
the legality and possibility of granting
draw exemption privileges to only
single sex houses.
Illegal System
Iris Brest, an attorney in the
General Secretary's Office, said that
"it shouldn't be assumed that such a
system would be illegal" when Title IX
regulations are implemented early next
year.
Brest explained that single sex
University-run dormatories would be
allowed to exist, but "when you
introduce the social club element you
run into problems viewed differently
by different people."

She added that with fraternities and
sororities, it is "not the case of the
University saying it wants a single sex
dorm."
Horton has said that sororities
could be brought back.
Sororities were abolished in 1944
after being opposed by a majority of
the female students. Nilsson noted
that two coeds committed suicide,
apparently because of the social
pressure which developed because
many more females wanted to be in
sororities than spaces available.
Affects All Students
Horton continually emphasized
that the issue did not just affect
fraternity members, but all students,
because it would re-shape the direction
of the entire housing system.
Responding to a question about the
housing shortage, Horton said that it
"will have a significant impact for the
next decade."
Though the trustees recently
approved the concept of three new
Row houses, Horton noted that the
Board has "not approved the project's
funding."
He added that he was "not
confident" of getting 700 additional
spaces besides the Row houses because
the University "may not be able to
afford it."

draw-exemption status and selectivity
of future members.
No Continuity
"I don't think we [fraternities] will
be able to keep continuity" under the
draw system, Higgins said. He noted
that fraternities would undergo a 50
percent turnover each year under the
draw, rather than the 33 to 35 percent
rate they do now.
Higgins said that Theta Delta Chi,
because of the proportion of seniors in
the house, experienced 50 percent
turnover two years ago. "I don't think
we could have survived it two years in
a row," he added.
Nilsson and Higgins also pointed
out that fraternities within the draw,
such as Alpha Sigma Phi, were
generally not as strong as those outside
the draw.
Numerous questions arose regarding
the legality and possibility of granting
draw exemption privileges to only
single sex houses.
Illegal System
Iris Brest, an attorney in the
General Secretary's Office, said that
"it shouldn't be assumed that such a
system would be illegal" when Title IX
regulations are implemented early next
year.
Brest explained that single sex
University-run dormatories would be
allowed to exist, but "when you
introduce the social club element you
run into problems viewed differently
by different people."

She added that with fraternities and
sororities, it is "not the case of the
University saying it wants a single sex
dorm."
Horton has said that sororities
could be brought back.
Sororities were abolished in 1944
after being opposed by a majority of
the female students. Nilsson noted
that two coeds committed suicide,
apparently because of the social
pressure which developed because
many more females wanted to be in
sororities than spaces available.
Affects All Students
Horton continually emphasized
that the issue did not just affect
fraternity members, but all students,
because it would re-shape the direction
of the entire housing system.
Responding to a question about the
housing shortage, Horton said that it
"will have a significant impact for the
next decade."
Though the trustees recently
approved the concept of three new
Row houses, Horton noted that the
Board has "not approved the project's
funding."
He added that he was "not
confident" of getting 700 additional
spaces besides the Row houses because
the University "may not be able to
afford it."

BOTH SIDES NOW—Inter-fraternity Council President Mike Nilsson, left, and
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton discussed the draw-exemption
issue last night in Toy on lounge.
Fraternities "are in a position of
bargaining" with the University
regarding potential changes in their
draw-exemption status,
Inter-fraternity Council President
Michael Nilsson said last night.
We're not in a position "to divulge
what we'll accept," he added.
Nilsson's remarks came during a
meeting about the draw-exemption
status at Toyon Lounge attended by
75 people.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton outlined the complex
issues and Fielded questions about
possible alterations in the housing
system during this latest meeting.
Can Overrule
Though "University policy has
required" all coed residences to be in
the housing draw, there is "no reason
we cannot overrule what we've done in
the past," Horton said.
Last spring, Alpha Sigma Phi, a
coed fraternity within the draw,
requested to be exempt from the
draw, but their proposal was
unanimously turned down by the
Committee on Services to Students
(COSS).
In their First meeting this year,
members of COSS did not decide
Tuesday how to handle the issue,
Horton said. COSS will meet again
next Tuesday.
Mike Higgins, an alumnus of Theta
Delta Chi, outlined the importance of
