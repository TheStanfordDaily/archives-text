# Most Workers Pay First USE Monthly Dues
## 
### DON COX 
Despite some initial opposition,
most workers in the bargaining unit
represented by United Stanford
Employees (USE) paid their first
monthly union dues as required by
their new contract.
Out of the 1500 technical,
maintenance and service employees in
the unit, only two workers refused to
pay the July dues. The two were fired
by the University Friday in accordance
with its contractural obligations.
The contract signed in June
requires employees in the unit,
whether union members or not, to pay
union dues.
First Collection
Although dues are supposed to be
paid by the end of each month, USE
President Jim Berk said the union did
not move against individuals until now
because July was the first time dues
were collected. About 350 employees
had not complied by July 31.
"Many of the workers did not pay
because of misunderstandings," said
Berk. He said the union would not
wait as long in the future for workers
to comply.
Compliance will probably not be a
problem from now on, however, since
"80 to 95 percent of the workers"
have their dues automatically
deducted from their University pay
checks, he said.
University labor relations lawyer
Doug Barton said that he was
"unhappy" that the two workers had
to be Fired, but that "we had no
choice," because of contractural
obligations.
Knew Consequences
"We were very concerned to do
anything we possibly could to counsel
employees and to make sure they
knew the consequences if they did not
comply.
"I'm confident the two individuals
terminated made a conscious choice
and realized the consequence was
losing their jobs," Barton said.
The University had initially
opposed making non-union unit
members pay dues during contract
negotiations earlier this year because it
was "unfair." However, in the final
settlement, the University granted this
union demand for an agency shop.
NLRB Petition
Some unit members attempted to
petition the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) this spring to have the
agency shop clause removed from the
contract, but the members failed to
receive the support of other unit
members.
Barton said that some unit
members who were reluctant to pay
the required dues had inquired if the
University would be willing to pay the
dues for the workers. However, Barton
said it would have been illegal on a
number of grounds for the University
to do so.
The University might have been
guilty of appearing to discriminate in
favor of employees on the basis of
their union activity and violating
regulations prohibiting payments from
an employer to a union in certain
cases, Barton said.
