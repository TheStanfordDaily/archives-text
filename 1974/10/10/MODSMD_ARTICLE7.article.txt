Quote Misinterpreted
Editor:
A direct quote attributed to
me in Monday's Daily sports
section concerning the historical
perspective of the San Francisco
49ers was misinterpreted. I in no
way meant to criticize Jack
Christiansen's coaching abiltiy,
and apologize for any possible
misunderstanding.

More On The Draw
Editor:
The issue of draw-exempt
status in the University housing
system has been addressed with
fervor by those most immediately
affected. However, the equitable
handling of the housing shortage
problem requires that the best
interests of all Stanford students,
not just the (justifiably) vocal, be
considered.
Fraternities use University
buildings and/or land. What
special priority do their members
command over all the other
students who also desire an
attractive, enjoyable campus
residence? If one group gets
draw-exempt status, it is
reasonable to think that the other
frats and houses will want to be
exempted.
Some 800 students were
unassigned on Sept. 1. How many
more would be denied campus
housing if all these residences
were out of the Draw? Further,
the burden of scarce living
quarters would be shouldered
more often by the same
individuals.
Random chance appears the
fairest way to distribute this
hardship, whatever the method of
housing assignment.
Circumstances now require a
review of the present system. Its
replacement should insure, as
much as possible, that everybody
has an equal chance to live on
campus.

Editor:
In as much as I believe the
Daily to be basically a moral and
-ethical enterprise, I must assume
™that the knowledge of any
associated conduct inconsistent
with these basic principles would
_J)e of interest to you.
At this point, I gite the article
"Uh . . . Sick, Transition, Etc.,"
(Oct. 4). It is my firm belief that
the byline, "Greenwald, Cohn," is
extremely misleading and,
therefore, in need of an
explanation.
I did originally author an
article for submission to the
Daily. Prior to making the
determination to have it
published. I solicited the opinions
and criticisms of several people I
respect, including those of my
writing instructor. Having satisfied
myself with the quality of the
article, I gave it to Jeff Greenwald
(a Daily business staff member)
for delivery to the paper. I neither
saw nor heard anything more of
the article until the publication of
an entirely revised and
unintelligible version under the
title of "Uh . .. Sick Transition,
Etc."
It is quite apparent that
Greenwald, in order to gratify his
own ego, felt it necessary to
rewrite the article completely
without my consent or
knowledge. He thereby justified,
at least in his own mind, the
inclusion of his name on the
byline. As for the resultant article,
it is incomprehensible how
anyone but a well below-average
semi-literate high school student
could communiate at such a low
literary level. It lacked coherence
and meaningful content as well as

being completely devoid of
humor. About the only thing it
did accomplish was allowing Jeff
Greenwald the thrill of seeing his
name in print.
I realize that the Daily is not
directly responsible for the
occurrence of the previously
described events. I believe,
however, that you will be able to
appreciate the resentment I feel in
having my name associated with
the article in question. I,
therefore, would very much
appreciate your printing a copy of
this letter dedicating that portion
of the article I allegedly authored
to Jeff Greenwald's insecurities.

Greenwald's Defense
Editor:
The misunderstanding that has
arisen over the article "Uh, . ..
sick transition, etc." (Daily, Oct.
4) is actually one between Steven
Cohn and myself. While it is true
that the former had authored an
incomplete article which was in
need of editing, simplification and
clarification on many points,
Steven solicited my help to
rewrite the article. The article
lacked only cohesiveness and was
devoid of humor in only three
places: the beginning, the middle
and the end.
It was our mutual
understanding that the article
would be altered and that I would
complete and change the rather
bland and undirected literary
prose by Cohn wherever I felt
necessary, and I would also
receive credit on the by-line. The
very fact that Steven Cohn
solicited his teacher's help shows
his lack of confidence in his own
writing, and by extension does
make it incredible that he turned
to his friend, me, who has been on
the Daily staff for three years.
The fact that Cohn felt the
need to attack me is very
ungracious on his part. My time
and effort was spent in order to
help a friend get an article
published which would have
otherwise been round-filed
because of its poor quality and
grossly exaggerated foul humor.
This situation is similar to the
story of the lion who was in the
cage at the circus. A tiny mouse
chanced by the cage and the lion
cried out that he wanted to get
out, and how he hated being
caged up. The mouse reluctantly
complied. As soon as the lion
heard the latch on the cage click,
he bounded at the mouse and ate
him up.
I feel cheated, unappreciated
for my efforts and libeled by
Cohn. Should he wish to
apologize for his false accusations,
a simple verbal apology will be
acceptable. However, his future
written profoundities will have to
stand on their own (de)merits.

Arms Sales
Editor:
So now the United States is
selling arms to Chile, supposedly
for protection against a possible
attack by Peru. Isn't the shoe
likely to be on the other foot?
The Peruvian government is about
the only moderately leftist
example making alternatives to
traditional development strategies
viable in Latin America.
In Peru the rumor is that the
United States is arming Chile to
provoke an admittedly useless
conflict which nevertheless could
cause the downfall of the "leftist"
Peruvian government. I scoffed at
the early rumors of CIA
involvement in the Allende
overthrow that events should be
manipulated for a repeat
performance in Peru would not
surprise me now.

More On The Draw
Editor:
The issue of draw-exempt
status in the University housing
system has been addressed with
fervor by those most immediately
affected. However, the equitable
handling of the housing shortage
problem requires that the best
interests of all Stanford students,
not just the (justifiably) vocal, be
considered.
Fraternities use University
buildings and/or land. What
special priority do their members
command over all the other
students who also desire an
attractive, enjoyable campus
residence? If one group gets
draw-exempt status, it is
reasonable to think that the other
frats and houses will want to be
exempted.
Some 800 students were
unassigned on Sept. 1. How many
more would be denied campus
housing if all these residences
were out of the Draw? Further,
the burden of scarce living
quarters would be shouldered
more often by the same
individuals.
Random chance appears the
fairest way to distribute this
hardship, whatever the method of
housing assignment.
Circumstances now require a
review of the present system. Its
replacement should insure, as
much as possible, that everybody
has an equal chance to live on
campus.

In as much as I believe the

At this point, I gite the article
"Uh . . . Sick, Transition, Etc.,"
(Oct. 4). It is my firm belief that
the byline, "Greenwald, Cohn," is
extremely misleading and,
therefore, in need of an
explanation.
I did originally author an
article for submission to the
Daily. Prior to making the
determination to have it
published. I solicited the opinions
and criticisms of several people I
respect, including those of my
writing instructor. Having satisfied
myself with the quality of the
article, I gave it to Jeff Greenwald
(a Daily business staff member)
for delivery to the paper. I neither
saw nor heard anything more of
the article until the publication of
an entirely revised and
unintelligible version under the
title of "Uh . .. Sick Transition,
Etc."
It is quite apparent that
Greenwald, in order to gratify his
own ego, felt it necessary to
rewrite the article completely
without my consent or
knowledge. He thereby justified,
at least in his own mind, the
inclusion of his name on the
byline. As for the resultant article,
it is incomprehensible how
anyone but a well below-average
semi-literate high school student
could communiate at such a low
literary level. It lacked coherence
and meaningful content as well as

being completely devoid of
humor. About the only thing it
did accomplish was allowing Jeff
Greenwald the thrill of seeing his
name in print.
I realize that the Daily is not
directly responsible for the
occurrence of the previously
described events. I believe,
however, that you will be able to
appreciate the resentment I feel in
having my name associated with
the article in question. I,
therefore, would very much

Greenwald's Defense
Editor:
The misunderstanding that has
arisen over the article "Uh, . ..
sick transition, etc." (Daily, Oct.
4) is actually one between Steven
Cohn and myself. While it is true
that the former had authored an
incomplete article which was in
need of editing, simplification and
clarification on many points,
Steven solicited my help to
rewrite the article. The article
lacked only cohesiveness and was
devoid of humor in only three
places: the beginning, the middle
and the end.
It was our mutual
understanding that the article
would be altered and that I would
complete and change the rather
bland and undirected literary
prose by Cohn wherever I felt
necessary, and I would also
receive credit on the by-line. The
very fact that Steven Cohn
solicited his teacher's help shows
his lack of confidence in his own
writing, and by extension does
make it incredible that he turned
to his friend, me, who has been on
the Daily staff for three years.
The fact that Cohn felt the
need to attack me is very
ungracious on his part. My time
and effort was spent in order to
help a friend get an article
published which would have
otherwise been round-filed
because of its poor quality and
grossly exaggerated foul humor.
This situation is similar to the
story of the lion who was in the
cage at the circus. A tiny mouse
chanced by the cage and the lion
cried out that he wanted to get
out, and how he hated being
caged up. The mouse reluctantly
complied. As soon as the lion
heard the latch on the cage click,
he bounded at the mouse and ate
him up.
I feel cheated, unappreciated
for my efforts and libeled by
Cohn. Should he wish to
apologize for his false accusations,
a simple verbal apology will be
acceptable. However, his future
written profoundities will have to
stand on their own (de)merits.

More On The Draw
Editor:
The issue of draw-exempt
status in the University housing
system has been addressed with
fervor by those most immediately
affected. However, the equitable
handling of the housing shortage
problem requires that the best
interests of all Stanford students,
not just the (justifiably) vocal, be
considered.
Fraternities use University
buildings and/or land. What
special priority do their members
command over all the other
students who also desire an
attractive, enjoyable campus
residence? If one group gets
draw-exempt status, it is
reasonable to think that the other
frats and houses will want to be
exempted.
Some 800 students were
unassigned on Sept. 1. How many
more would be denied campus
housing if all these residences
were out of the Draw? Further,
the burden of scarce living
quarters would be shouldered
more often by the same
individuals.
Random chance appears the
fairest way to distribute this
hardship, whatever the method of
housing assignment.
Circumstances now require a
review of the present system. Its
replacement should insure, as
much as possible, that everybody
has an equal chance to live on
campus.

In as much as I believe the
Daily to be basically a moral and
-ethical enterprise, I must assume
™that the knowledge of any
associated conduct inconsistent
with these basic principles would
_J)e of interest to you.
At this point, I gite the article
"Uh . . . Sick, Transition, Etc.,"
(Oct. 4). It is my firm belief that
the byline, "Greenwald, Cohn," is
extremely misleading and,
therefore, in need of an
explanation.
I did originally author an
article for submission to the
Daily. Prior to making the
determination to have it
published. I solicited the opinions
and criticisms of several people I
respect, including those of my
writing instructor. Having satisfied
myself with the quality of the
article, I gave it to Jeff Greenwald
(a Daily business staff member)
for delivery to the paper. I neither
saw nor heard anything more of
the article until the publication of
an entirely revised and
unintelligible version under the
title of "Uh . .. Sick Transition,
Etc."
It is quite apparent that
Greenwald, in order to gratify his
own ego, felt it necessary to
rewrite the article completely
without my consent or
knowledge. He thereby justified,
at least in his own mind, the
inclusion of his name on the
byline. As for the resultant article,
it is incomprehensible how
anyone but a well below-average
semi-literate high school student
could communiate at such a low
literary level. It lacked coherence
and meaningful content as well as

being completely devoid of
humor. About the only thing it
did accomplish was allowing Jeff
Greenwald the thrill of seeing his
name in print.
I realize that the Daily is not
directly responsible for the
occurrence of the previously
described events. I believe,
however, that you will be able to
appreciate the resentment I feel in
having my name associated with
the article in question. I,
therefore, would very much
appreciate your printing a copy of
this letter dedicating that portion

Greenwald's Defense
Editor:
The misunderstanding that has
arisen over the article "Uh, . ..
sick transition, etc." (Daily, Oct.
4) is actually one between Steven
Cohn and myself. While it is true
that the former had authored an
incomplete article which was in
need of editing, simplification and
clarification on many points,
Steven solicited my help to
rewrite the article. The article
lacked only cohesiveness and was
devoid of humor in only three
places: the beginning, the middle
and the end.
It was our mutual
understanding that the article
would be altered and that I would
complete and change the rather
bland and undirected literary
prose by Cohn wherever I felt
necessary, and I would also
receive credit on the by-line. The
very fact that Steven Cohn
solicited his teacher's help shows
his lack of confidence in his own
writing, and by extension does
make it incredible that he turned
to his friend, me, who has been on
the Daily staff for three years.
The fact that Cohn felt the
need to attack me is very
ungracious on his part. My time
and effort was spent in order to
help a friend get an article
published which would have
otherwise been round-filed
because of its poor quality and
grossly exaggerated foul humor.
This situation is similar to the
story of the lion who was in the
cage at the circus. A tiny mouse
chanced by the cage and the lion
cried out that he wanted to get
out, and how he hated being
caged up. The mouse reluctantly
complied. As soon as the lion
heard the latch on the cage click,
he bounded at the mouse and ate
him up.
I feel cheated, unappreciated
for my efforts and libeled by
Cohn. Should he wish to
apologize for his false accusations,
a simple verbal apology will be
acceptable. However, his future
written profoundities will have to
stand on their own (de)merits.

likely to be on the other foot?
The Peruvian government is about
the only moderately leftist
example making alternatives to
traditional development strategies
viable in Latin America.
In Peru the rumor is that the
United States is arming Chile to
provoke an admittedly useless
conflict which nevertheless could
cause the downfall of the "leftist"
Peruvian government. I scoffed at
the early rumors of CIA
involvement in the Allende
overthrow that events should be
manipulated for a repeat
performance in Peru would not
surprise me now.
