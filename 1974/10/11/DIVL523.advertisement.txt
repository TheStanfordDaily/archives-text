City Root
By now you're probably
aware that Roots are not
like other kinds of footwear.
The heel is lower to give
you the natural kind of
•walk you'd get by going •
barefoot in sand. The arch
is supported, so if you
spend much time on your
feet you'll now spend it in
much greater comfort. The
rocker sole hefps spring
you off on each footstep,
so walking becomes a little
less work than it ever was
before.
You don't blow an
extraordinary
i idea i
on an '
ordinary
shoe.

But a big part of Roots*
success lies in not hou)
they're made, but hou;
well. Only the finest grade
Canadian hides are
selected These are hand
crafted into Roots, simply
because, for much of our
production, the most '
efficient machine is still the
human hand.
This is why, of all the,
reasons we could give you
for trying Roots, none
would fit quite so well as the
shoe itself.
