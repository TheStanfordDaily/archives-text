A PLAY BY DALE WASSERMAN
FROM THE NOVEL BY KEN KESEY
"There's as much energy in this play as I tried to
put in the book. They took up where I left off. I'm
amazed!"
Ken Kesey
"To get a novel onto the stage a price must be paid.
Not with 'Cuckoo's Nest.' The play is superb !"
Jack McDonough—Rolling Stone
"Hilarious and terrifying!"
Daily Californian
"The play is full of more life and vitality than
almost any other I've ever seen. It's like a psychic
energizer."
Rich Ogar—Berkeley Barb
"Humor, compassion and hatred. It evokes an
audience reaction unparalleled in my viewing
experience."
Lance Frederiksen—San Jose State
"Brilliant! Packed with the spirit of freedom and
freewheeling in its humor and disdain for the status
quo. I've seen it three times."
Marc Kaye—Stanford Daily
