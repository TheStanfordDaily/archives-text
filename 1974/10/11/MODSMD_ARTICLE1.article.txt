# Few Women Chosen For Faculty Here
## 
### BOB LOWE 
Stanford hired fewer female
professors in the 1973-74 academic
year than in the previous year and fell
far short of target goals established last
year by the Faculty Senate.
Vice Provost for Faculty
'Affirmative Action Arthur
Bienenstock told the Senate yesterday
that only 10 women were appointed
professors as opposed to 72 men.
However, nine women left the
University so the net increase in
positions held by women was only
t one.
In 1972-73, 13 women were
appointed oÂ»fessors while new male
professors totalled 72 (the women's
figure excludes four women who were
previously lecturers or research
associates and received appointments
k after special review.
Angry Comments
Bienenstock's report evoked angry
comments from various senators.
Psychology Prof. Eleanor Maccoby
said, "I find the report disappointing.
This is very slow progress, indeed."
Maccoby expressed concern that
' the University's financial plight might
create a "turning away from
affirmative action" as professorial
appointments are frozen or cut back.
Classics Prof. Ronald Mellor saidUhe
statistics were an "abysmal shoeing."
Goals
f The Faculty Senate, in 1973, set a
goal of hiring 20 percent women. The
percentage of women hired in 1973-74
was only 12.2 percent.
Bienenstock attributed the decline
in women hiring to a decrease in new
professors in the School of Humanities
' and Sciences and increases in areas
which have fewer women with
doctorates.
Last year, 33 new professors were
appointed in the School of Humanities
and Science is, compared to 52
appointed in 1972-73.
t But even among those
appointments the percentage of
women declined. In 1972-73, 18
percent of the Humanities and Science
professorial appointments went to
women. Last year that figure was 15.2
percent.
I Check
Bienenstock isn't directly in charge
of hiring women; professorial
appointments are made by individual
departments. However, he is supposed
to check on any hiring discrimination
and encourage departments to hire
more women.
Bienenstock said he was confident
that departments were "doing the job
[hiring] fairly."
In another matter, the Senate
approved a change in examination
policy, requiring that professors
inform students of unusual
examination schedules no later than
the end of the second week of the
quarter.
This will apply to instructors of,
classes with extraordinary meeting
times that don't fit into the normal
exam schedule. The rule also holds for
classes in which take-home tests,
papers or projects take the place of the
final exam.
Any change in the exam schedule
made after the first two weeks must be
"an option to the plan originally
announced by the instructor,"
according to the new policy.
The Senate also voted to ease
requirements for advanced standing
granted to freshman students at the
University who have completed college
courses prior to high school
graduation.
Previously, freshmen had to do B
work in those courses. The change in
requirements will give credit for C
work as is the case with transfer
students.
In reviewing a report from the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (CAAA), the Senate

deleted one portion which seemed to
indicate a dichotomy between
professors' work in undergraduate
education and work which helps them
get tenure.
The deleted section recommended
to President Richard Lyman that the
junior faculty Dinkelspiel Award not
be given in the future. .
The Dinkelspiel Award goes to
professors who make "contributions
to undergraduate teaching," according
to last year's CAA'A chairman,
Philosophy Prof. John L.
Mothershead.
Mothershead said the reasoning
behind the recommendation is that the
kinds of activities that help in
undergraduate teaching work against
activities helpful in getting tenure.
Mellor said that some departments
advise junior professors not to do
things that show "you are less
interested in things that matter."
The Senate deleted a section in the
CAAA report so the recommendation
won't officially go to Lyman.
The Senate also heard a new policy
for handling grievances which come up
under the Statement on Academic
Freedom approved last year by the
Senate. By taking no action against the
grievance policy, the Senate allowed
its implementation.
