# Few Women Chosen For Faculty Here
## 
### BOB LOWE 
Stanford hired fewer female
professors in the 1973-74 academic
year than in the previous year and fell
far short of target goals established last
year by the Faculty Senate.
Vice Provost for Faculty
'Affirmative Action Arthur
Bienenstock told the Senate yesterday
that only 10 women were appointed
professors as opposed to 72 men.
However, nine women left the
University so the net increase in
positions held by women was only
t one.
In 1972-73, 13 women were
appointed o»fessors while new male
professors totalled 72 (the women's
figure excludes four women who were
previously lecturers or research
associates and received appointments
k after special review.
Angry Comments
Bienenstock's report evoked angry
comments from various senators.
Psychology Prof. Eleanor Maccoby
said, "I find the report disappointing.
This is very slow progress, indeed."
Maccoby expressed concern that
' the University's financial plight might
create a "turning away from
affirmative action" as professorial
appointments are frozen or cut back.
Classics Prof. Ronald Mellor saidUhe
statistics were an "abysmal shoeing."
Goals
f The Faculty Senate, in 1973, set a
goal of hiring 20 percent women. The
percentage of women hired in 1973-74
was only 12.2 percent.
Bienenstock attributed the decline
in women hiring to a decrease in new
professors in the School of Humanities
' and Sciences and increases in areas
which have fewer women with
doctorates.
Last year, 33 new professors were
appointed in the School of Humanities
and Science is, compared to 52
appointed in 1972-73.
t But even among those
appointments the percentage of
women declined. In 1972-73, 18
percent of the Humanities and Science
professorial appointments went to
women. Last year that figure was 15.2
percent.
I Check
Bienenstock isn't directly in charge
of hiring women; professorial
appointments are made by individual
departments. However, he is supposed
to check on any hiring discrimination
and encourage departments to hire
more women.
Bienenstock said he was confident
that departments were "doing the job
