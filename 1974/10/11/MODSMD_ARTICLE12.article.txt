# Supernatural Hocus-Pocus Useless
## 
### Steven Lewis 
We live in dangerous times. You can be
sure of that because a growing number of
people are fleeing the real world for a
supernatural security blanket. The age of
nuclear weapons, overpopulation, pollution
and other threats to human survival has
spawned a bizarre assortment of proselytizers
who are cashing in on ignorance, fear and
conflict.
Whether these religious zealots represent
cults, such as Herbert W. Armstrong's
Worldwide Church of God, or popular
evangelists, such as Billy Graham, the
proponents of fundamentalist religion aren't
centrally concerned with practical solutions
for the world's problems. They are more
concerned with satisfying people's primtive
impulses for eternal life and simplicity.
Evangelists typically disregard an objective
search for and consideration of facts and,
instead, preach popular mythology. They
promote reasoning based on authority, which
is no reasoning at all.
Persons who are under the popular
delusion that words are things have a field
day when preachers talk about God, Satan,
heaven and love as if they were concrete,
observable objects. Beware of verbal
snowstorms in September. It is so much
easier to deal in popular myths derived from
a single source than to search for objective
truth.
There are actually people who believe that

the Bible is applicable to the nuclear age.
Hence, the Catholic Church continues to
impede the real world by its opposition to
contraceptives. The Bible is so full of
meaningless abstractions, surface
contradictions and black-white either-or logic
that it is more dangerous than applicable to
the 20th Century.
People who rip the Bible out of its
context to apply it to today are guilty of
deception. What did Jesus mean when he was
reported to have said, "Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's and unto God that
which is God's?" Modern scholarship
indicates Jesus wasn't saying "pay your
taxes," but he was telling the Jews "Don't
pay."
Throughout Jesus' lifetime the Jews were
in revolt against the Romans. A few Jews,
such as the high priests and landowners,
occupied high civil or religious positions as
puppets of the Romans. Most Jews, however,
were oppressed peasants who followed
countless messiahs, one of whom was Jesus,
in unsuccessful attempts to overthrow
Roman rule.
Didn't Preach Nonviolence
It is absurd to believe that Jesus preached
nonresistance if one examines the context of
Jesus' life. Strangely < in the Gospels alone
there is no evidence of the fact that Jesus
lived amid one of history's fiercest guerrilla
uprisings.

Why would the Romans and their puppet
Jews want Jesus put to death if he was
preaching peace and recognition of Roman
authority? Jesus must not have been
preaching nonresistance. He must have been
preaching what the Jewish peasants wanted
to hear revolt against the Romans.
About 40 years after Jesus' death, the
Jewish revolt was overcome by the Romans
and as a result, Jesus' militant message had to
be adapted to a changed environment.
Not all of Jesus' fiery comments could be
purged from the minds of his followers,
however. As a result, we have such
ambiguities as "Blessed are the peacemakers"
and "Think not that I am come to send peace
on earth, I come not to send peace but a
sword."
Evangelists, however, aren't concerned
with putting things in their proper
perspective and dealing pragmatically with
the real world. How ironic. The persons who
are least concerned with facts are admired
the most.
Instead of religious faith, let's be honest
about religion. Let's deal directly with the
real world. The problems we face are
awesome and if anything bails humanity out,
it will be ourselves and not supernatural
hocus-pocus.

Didn't Preach Nonviolence
It is absurd to believe that Jesus preached
nonresistance if one examines the context of
Jesus' life. Strangely < in the Gospels alone
there is no evidence of the fact that Jesus
lived amid one of history's fiercest guerrilla
uprisings.

Why would the Romans and their puppet
Jews want Jesus put to death if he was
preaching peace and recognition of Roman
authority? Jesus must not have been
preaching nonresistance. He must have been
preaching what the Jewish peasants wanted
to hear revolt against the Romans.
About 40 years after Jesus' death, the
Jewish revolt was overcome by the Romans
and as a result, Jesus' militant message had to
be adapted to a changed environment.
Not all of Jesus' fiery comments could be
purged from the minds of his followers,
however. As a result, we have such
ambiguities as "Blessed are the peacemakers"
and "Think not that I am come to send peace
on earth, I come not to send peace but a
sword."
Evangelists, however, aren't concerned
with putting things in their proper
perspective and dealing pragmatically with
the real world. How ironic. The persons who
are least concerned with facts are admired
the most.
Instead of religious faith, let's be honest
about religion. Let's deal directly with the
real world. The problems we face are
awesome and if anything bails humanity out,
it will be ourselves and not supernatural
hocus-pocus.

We live in dangerous times. You can be
sure of that because a growing number of
people are fleeing the real world for a
supernatural security blanket. The age of
nuclear weapons, overpopulation, pollution
and other threats to human survival has
spawned a bizarre assortment of proselytizers
who are cashing in on ignorance, fear and
conflict.
Whether these religious zealots represent
cults, such as Herbert W. Armstrong's
Worldwide Church of God, or popular
evangelists, such as Billy Graham, the
proponents of fundamentalist religion aren't
centrally concerned with practical solutions
for the world's problems. They are more
concerned with satisfying people's primtive
impulses for eternal life and simplicity.
Evangelists typically disregard an objective
search for and consideration of facts and,
instead, preach popular mythology. They
promote reasoning based on authority, which
is no reasoning at all.
Persons who are under the popular
delusion that words are things have a field
day when preachers talk about God, Satan,
heaven and love as if they were concrete,
observable objects. Beware of verbal
snowstorms in September. It is so much
easier to deal in popular myths derived from
a single source than to search for objective
truth.
There are actually people who believe that

the Bible is applicable to the nuclear age.
Hence, the Catholic Church continues to
impede the real world by its opposition to
contraceptives. The Bible is so full of
meaningless abstractions, surface
contradictions and black-white either-or logic
that it is more dangerous than applicable to
the 20th Century.
People who rip the Bible out of its
context to apply it to today are guilty of
deception. What did Jesus mean when he was
reported to have said, "Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's and unto God that
which is God's?" Modern scholarship
indicates Jesus wasn't saying "pay your
taxes," but he was telling the Jews "Don't
pay."
Throughout Jesus' lifetime the Jews were
in revolt against the Romans. A few Jews,
such as the high priests and landowners,
occupied high civil or religious positions as
puppets of the Romans. Most Jews, however,
were oppressed peasants who followed
countless messiahs, one of whom was Jesus,
in unsuccessful attempts to overthrow
Roman rule.
