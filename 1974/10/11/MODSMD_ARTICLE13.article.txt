# Intent Of ASSU Lecture Notes
## 
### Vic Petroff 
The primary intent of the
ASSU Lecture Note Service is to
avoid the unnecessarily
interrupted transmission of
information from the lecturer to
the student. Basically, the Service
will assist the student in
overcoming two typical problems.
The first evolves from the
difficulties inherent in the
mechanical aspects of the
lecturer-listener relationship. The
second concerns those obstacles
faced by the student innate to
broad, introductory courses,
where students are largely
unfamiliar with the terminology
of the subject matter and,
consequently, have not developed
sufficient skills to accurately
reflect the content of the course
in their notes.
In analyzing the mechanical
problem of the lecture situation,
the major problem lies in that the
student is often unable to keep
pace with the professor because
he must take the time to
transcribe the words which the
professor has just spoken. As a
result, the student misses
important details while writing
others down.
With a lecture note service in
operation, students would have
the increased opportunity to
listen more carefully, grasping the
main points of the lecture.
Furthermore, in many cases, it
would encourage a large amount
of class discussion.
Would Lessen Anxiety
Quite simply, to the extent
that complete lecture notes are
available to all, students are likely
to become less the anxiety ridden
stenographers and more the
participatory inquirers they
ideally should be.
Turning to the second
problem, dealing with large,
introductory courses, the obvious
handicap the average student faces
is that of interpretation. He is
invariably unfamiliar with the
premises and general direction of
the subject matter, and. therefore,
he encounters the problem of
selecting which lecture material
should be written down and
which should not. With a more
seasoned note-taker in the class,
provided by the Lecture Note
Service, this problem can be
substantially reduced.
It should be pointed out here
that Lecture Notes are by no
means intended to serve as a

substitute for the student's own
notes, but rather, as a supplement
to them. Lecture Notes would
serve as an additional reinforcer or
re-exposure to the material. In
addition, students may become
more critical listeners when taking
briefer, more concise notes.
Besides providing obvious
benefits for students, a lecture
note program would be
advantageous to lecturers as well.
The notes would provide an
outline of the material covered in
the course, which might be used
for evaluating the emphasis
certain aspects should receive in

future lectures, or in the
formation of a textbook or othei;
publications planned by the
professor.
Finally, with respect to the
classroom situation, the lecturer
would be able to cover more
material without waiting for
students to transcribe detailed
information, or he might choose
to open the classroom to more
give and take between himself and
his students.
Another advantageous aspect
of a lecture note program is that it
would provide a form of financial

aid for students. Those selected to
serve as note-takers will be paid
on a lecture-hour basis ranging
from $5.25 (undergraduate) to
$6.00 (graduate).
There appears to be a high level
of interest and desire on the part
of students, faculty, and
administrators in implementing a
lecture note service at Stanford.
This, in combination with the
advantages of the program just
enumerated, indicates sufficient
need for the establishment of such
a service at Stanford.
