# Poor Employee Relations
## 
### Betty Moreno 
On Dec. 6, 1973, under unfair
circumstances and without prior
notice, Richard K. Lazarus,
director of admissions at the
graduate school of business, fired
me. That same afternoon, Glenda
Jones of United Stanford
Employees union, two union
representatives and myself met
with you and the situation was
reversed. On the morning of Dec.
7, I was offered my job back and
accepted it. During this meeting,
it was decided that once back on
the job, I would with assistance
from Personnel Office seek a
transfer.
The conditions at the Graduate
School of Business remained the
same and in April, 1974, Ruth
Mogahdam was assigned as my
employee representative.
After numerous discussions,
Mogahdam and I decided that a
leave of absence, to take care of
personal business which had been
marring my attendance record,
would be of assistance in
obtaining a transfer. On May 9,
1974, Lazarus, his assistant Lyn
Nesbett, Mogahdam and I, met to
discuss the leave of absence which
was granted and scheduled to
begin June 1 and conclude July
31, 1974. I had one month to
settle my business and one month
to find a department to transfer
to.
In the first week of June, I was
notified that Maria Schnider

would handle my transfer. On
June 10, 1974, I had an interview
with Robert Langle that proved to
be unsuccessful in my gaining a
position with his staff. For the
duration of June I had no further
contact with Stanford. On July 1,
1974, I contacted the Personnel
office to once again find that my
case had been transfered back to
Mogahdam. On July 9, I again
spoke to Mogahdam and an
interview was arranged with
Micky Hamilton for July 16.
Another interview was arranged
for July 24, with Financial Aids
office. Both of these were also
unsuccessful in regaining
employment at Stanford.
Could Not Reach Mogahdam
During most of July, I called
Mogahdam daily and was told that
she was either with an interviewee
or that she was on the other line.
In any case, I was told that she
would return my call but she
never did. After the interview of
July 24, I did not hear from
Stanford until I called your office
in late August to complain about
this situation.
On Aug. 23, I was finally
contacted by Mogahdam, again an
interview was set up, this time for
Aug. 26 in the President's Office.
Because nearly a month had
passed without hearing from
Stanford, I was forced to seek
employment elsewhere. I cannot

express my surprise that such a
prestigious University can cause
such hardships to its employees.
I am wondering how many
other employees were put through
the same situation I was and did
nothing about it. At one time
while I was on leave, a fellow
union member questioned Paul
Wong of Personnel about the
status of my employment and was
told that it seemed as if I had
voluntarily quit. If this is what
Stanford considers "good
employee relations" then I do not
feel I can stay a member of
"Stanford Family" any longer.
Upon receipt of this letter, please
be advised that I quit Stanford
University.
(Betty Ann Moreno sent this
letter to Errul Sarpa, director of
personnel and employee relations
on Oct. 8, 1974.)
