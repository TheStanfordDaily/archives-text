# Beating Signup Sheets

### Rod Koon 
Fred Palmer was mad as hell.
He went in to sign up for
Philosophy 249 (Contemporary
Freedom as Seen Through the
Works of Jonathan P. Fillerbuster)
but 60 people had already
signed up for it and the limit was
thirty.
Fred was a Senior and this was
his last quarter at Stanford, so it
was now or ever for this course.
The circumstances called for
extreme action. The first class
meeting was set for 9 a.m.
Thursday, in 200Q in History
Corner. Everybody knew that you
had to show up for the first class
or there wasn't a snowball's
chance in hell of getting into it. In
fact, the class signup sheet had
stated* "You have to show up at
the first snowfall or there's not a
hell of a class to get into." Which
shows you haw fouled up signup
sheets get. 4^
t Since this is the ¥of dirty
s tricks and sabotage, Fred turned
his mind to think on these things.-
1 How could he narrow the class
1 down so that he could get in? He
1 thought first of a bomb threat at
* 9 a.m. to clear out the building, so
he'd be the only one in class for
sure. But then he figured that the
s professor wouldn't show up
) either, and besides, this form of
sabotage was a pre-med favorite,
and Fred was in humanities. He
' wanted to be more original.
| Sought Phone Numbers
Devising new tactics, he copied
the thirty names above him on the
1 waiting list, and went to the
student directory for phone
| numbers. Calling the first ten
• people, he explained in an
i official-sounding voice that
, Philosophy 249 had been
| cancelled. All ten, in true
Stanford tradition, accepted their
fate.
Encouraged by this success,
Fred called the next ten girls on
' the list. This time he pretended to
be a doctor at Cowell, informing
them that their pregnancy tests
had come back positive, and
they'd better come in for further
testing Thursday at 9 a.m. One
girl exclaimed, lf How could that
be!" She was told that in thjs age
of artificial insemination anything
was possible.
He figured that they all went
for it, and called up the next ten
men on the list. Each was
informed that his name had been
j received as one who might have
j contracted a particular social
y disease. One guy exclaimed, "How
J can that be!" He was also told
that in this age of artificial
I insemination anything was
possible.
With nearly all the bases
1 covered, Fred took a final step to
insure his success. He made up an
official-looking notice which read,
"PHILOSOPHY 249 MOVED TO
ROOM 61H." He put the sign up
at 8:30 thursday morning outside
200Q and hid behind a desk in the
hall until 30 people had read the
sign and moved on as the
instructions instructed.
Only Student There
At 8:50 a.m. he took the sign
door, and went into the
classroom. He was all alone. At
five minutes past nine, in true
professorial fashion, the professor
entered with blue cards and
syllabi bulging in his briefcase.
"Where is everyone?" he asked
in amazement.
"I guess no one v/ants to take
the class this quarter. I think a lot
of them are busy with Human
Sex." Fred hypothesized.
"Yes, but what classes are they
taking? the professor queried.
Fred talked on: "At least the
class won't be too big this time. I
remember when I first tried to get
into this class three years ago.
There was 400 other people with
the same idea. You walked into
class the first day, saw the masses,
and exclaimed, 'Are you kidding\
I'm not going to ceach a class
that's this big!™
"I've been crying to get into
the class ever since, but I've
always been too low on the
waiting list. Well, it looks like I
finally have my chance."
t
T he professor scanned
the nearly empty room, then
spoke, "Are you kidding ! I'm not
going to teach a class that's this
small!" With that comment, he 1
walked out of the room.
So there was Fred, all alone
again, quite disappointed to say
the least. He pulled out a Time
Schedule to look for another 9
a.m. class, as he mumbled to
himself something about the best *
laid plans of mice and men.

Stanford in 1974.)

At 8:50 a.m. he took the sign
door, and went into the
classroom. He was all alone. At
five minutes past nine, in true
professorial fashion, the professor
entered with blue cards and
syllabi bulging in his briefcase.
"Where is everyone?" he asked
in amazement.
"I guess no one v/ants to take
the class this quarter. I think a lot
of them are busy with Human
Sex." Fred hypothesized.
"Yes, but what classes are they
taking? the professor queried.
Fred talked on: "At least the
class won't be too big this time. I
remember when I first tried to get
into this class three years ago.
There was 400 other people with
the same idea. You walked into
class the first day, saw the masses,
and exclaimed, 'Are you kidding\
I'm not going to ceach a class
that's this big!™
"I've been crying to get into
the class ever since, but I've
always been too low on the
waiting list. Well, it looks like I
finally have my chance."

the nearly empty room, then
spoke, "Are you kidding ! I'm not
going to teach a class that's this
small!" With that comment, he 1
walked out of the room.
So there was Fred, all alone
again, quite disappointed to say
the least. He pulled out a Time
Schedule to look for another 9
a.m. class, as he mumbled to
himself something about the best *
laid plans of mice and men.

Fred Palmer was mad as hell.
He went in to sign up for
Philosophy 249 (Contemporary
Freedom as Seen Through the
Works of Jonathan P. Fillerbuster)
but 60 people had already
signed up for it and the limit was
thirty.
Fred was a Senior and this was
his last quarter at Stanford, so it
was now or ever for this course.
The circumstances called for
extreme action. The first class
meeting was set for 9 a.m.
Thursday, in 200Q in History
Corner. Everybody knew that you
had to show up for the first class
or there wasn't a snowball's
chance in hell of getting into it. In
fact, the class signup sheet had
stated* "You have to show up at
the first snowfall or there's not a
hell of a class to get into." Which
shows you haw fouled up signup
sheets get. 4^
t Since this is the ¥of dirty
s tricks and sabotage, Fred turned
his mind to think on these things.-
1 How could he narrow the class
1 down so that he could get in? He
1 thought first of a bomb threat at
* 9 a.m. to clear out the building, so
he'd be the only one in class for
sure. But then he figured that the
s professor wouldn't show up
) either, and besides, this form of
sabotage was a pre-med favorite,
and Fred was in humanities. He
' wanted to be more original.

Devising new tactics, he copied
the thirty names above him on the

student directory for phone

• people, he explained in an
i official-sounding voice that
, Philosophy 249 had been
| cancelled. All ten, in true
Stanford tradition, accepted their
fate.
Encouraged by this success,
Fred called the next ten girls on
' the list. This time he pretended to
be a doctor at Cowell, informing
them that their pregnancy tests
had come back positive, and
they'd better come in for further
testing Thursday at 9 a.m. One
girl exclaimed, lf How could that
be!" She was told that in thjs age
of artificial insemination anything
was possible.
He figured that they all went
for it, and called up the next ten
men on the list. Each was
informed that his name had been
j received as one who might have
j contracted a particular social
y disease. One guy exclaimed, "How
J can that be!" He was also told
that in this age of artificial
I insemination anything was
possible.
With nearly all the bases
1 covered, Fred took a final step to
insure his success. He made up an
official-looking notice which read,
"PHILOSOPHY 249 MOVED TO

sure. But then he figured that the
s professor wouldn't show up
) either, and besides, this form of
sabotage was a pre-med favorite,
and Fred was in humanities. He
' wanted to be more original.
| Sought Phone Numbers
Devising new tactics, he copied
the thirty names above him on the
1 waiting list, and went to the
student directory for phone
| numbers. Calling the first ten
• people, he explained in an
i official-sounding voice that
, Philosophy 249 had been
| cancelled. All ten, in true
Stanford tradition, accepted their
fate.
Encouraged by this success,
Fred called the next ten girls on
' the list. This time he pretended to
be a doctor at Cowell, informing
them that their pregnancy tests
had come back positive, and
they'd better come in for further
testing Thursday at 9 a.m. One
girl exclaimed, lf How could that
be!" She was told that in thjs age
of artificial insemination anything
was possible.
He figured that they all went
for it, and called up the next ten
men on the list. Each was
informed that his name had been
j received as one who might have
j contracted a particular social
y disease. One guy exclaimed, "How
J can that be!" He was also told
that in this age of artificial
I insemination anything was
possible.
With nearly all the bases
1 covered, Fred took a final step to
insure his success. He made up an
official-looking notice which read,
"PHILOSOPHY 249 MOVED TO
ROOM 61H." He put the sign up
at 8:30 thursday morning outside
200Q and hid behind a desk in the
hall until 30 people had read the
sign and moved on as the
instructions instructed.
Only Student There
At 8:50 a.m. he took the sign
door, and went into the
classroom. He was all alone. At
five minutes past nine, in true
professorial fashion, the professor
entered with blue cards and
syllabi bulging in his briefcase.
"Where is everyone?" he asked
in amazement.
"I guess no one v/ants to take
the class this quarter. I think a lot
of them are busy with Human
Sex." Fred hypothesized.
"Yes, but what classes are they
taking? the professor queried.
Fred talked on: "At least the
class won't be too big this time. I
remember when I first tried to get
into this class three years ago.
There was 400 other people with
the same idea. You walked into
class the first day, saw the masses,
and exclaimed, 'Are you kidding\
I'm not going to ceach a class
that's this big!™
"I've been crying to get into
the class ever since, but I've
always been too low on the
waiting list. Well, it looks like I
finally have my chance."
t
T he professor scanned
the nearly empty room, then
spoke, "Are you kidding ! I'm not
going to teach a class that's this
small!" With that comment, he 1
walked out of the room.
So there was Fred, all alone
again, quite disappointed to say
the least. He pulled out a Time
Schedule to look for another 9
a.m. class, as he mumbled to
himself something about the best *
laid plans of mice and men.

Stanford in 1974.)
Fred Palmer was mad as hell.
He went in to sign up for
Philosophy 249 (Contemporary
Freedom as Seen Through the
Works of Jonathan P. Fillerbuster)
but 60 people had already
signed up for it and the limit was
thirty.
Fred was a Senior and this was
his last quarter at Stanford, so it
was now or ever for this course.
The circumstances called for
extreme action. The first class
meeting was set for 9 a.m.
Thursday, in 200Q in History
Corner. Everybody knew that you
had to show up for the first class
or there wasn't a snowball's
chance in hell of getting into it. In
fact, the class signup sheet had
stated* "You have to show up at
the first snowfall or there's not a
hell of a class to get into." Which
shows you haw fouled up signup
sheets get. 4^
t Since this is the ¥of dirty
s tricks and sabotage, Fred turned
his mind to think on these things.-
1 How could he narrow the class
1 down so that he could get in? He
1 thought first of a bomb threat at
* 9 a.m. to clear out the building, so
he'd be the only one in class for
sure. But then he figured that the
s professor wouldn't show up
) either, and besides, this form of
sabotage was a pre-med favorite,
and Fred was in humanities. He
