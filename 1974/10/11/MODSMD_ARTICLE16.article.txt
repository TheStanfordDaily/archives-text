# Can You Believe It? GPA At 3,5-And ...
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
If you're planning to apply to law or
medical schools and your grade point average
is "something else," you still may have to
reassess your chances for admission.
A survey taken by a Faculty Senate panel
here has revealed that the typical
undergraduate has a 3.55 grade point average,
and that includes people who have no desire
whatsoever to go on to a professional school.
What this means, then, is that just about
every law or medical school applicant from
Stanford is going to have outstanding grades.
And that, in turn, indicates that admission
committees will have to look elsewhere for
criteria to judge applicants.
William T. Keogh, the law school's
associate dean for admissions, pointed out
that "it makes it somewhat difficult for all

law schools to determine what a grade point
really means" when almost everyone is doing
so well.
"The more we are faced with grades which
are difficult to understand," Keogh said, "the
more we're going to have to rely upon the
LSATs, which we don't want to do, and upon
such other factors as recommendations."
Vice Provost Robert Rosenzweig concurred
with Keogh's judgment, pointing out that "if
grades don't mean anything, admissions
committees are going to look for other means
to select among applicants."
According to' Rosenzweig, "anything that
looks like hard data is going to be given
disproportionate weight" in the committees'
deliberations.
So applicants will have to do even better
on the LSAT, the Medical College Admissions
Test (MCAT) and the Graduate Record
Examination (GRE) if they are to stand any
chance of being admitted.
Problem Worsens
What is most troubling about this situation
is that many students were already
complaining about the emphasis admissions
committees place on such purely statistical
criteria. Now the problem will only get worse,
especially since Stanford's GPA inflation is
part of a national phenomenon, according to
Graduate Division Dean Lincoln Moses.
Besides making it more difficult to get into
the professional schools, grade inflation may
also intensify the pressure upon
pre-professional students to do even better
grade-wise.
Law Prof. John Kaplan believes cheating
isn't as likely anymore because "professors
hand out As like sugar candy." But

Rosenzweig says "the fact that a lot of high
grades are given might increase the pressure on
students" to take any measures necessary to
get an A including cheating.
What To Do?
The question then arises: what can be done
about grade inflation? Statistics Prof. Bradley
Efron, who chairs the Faculty Senate's Ad
Hoc Panel to Study the Grading System,
thinks "a lot of people would be loath" to
give up the current grading system.
"The present system has some real
advantages to both the faculty and the

students in terms of flexibility and relieving
pressure," Efron stated. "I don't see any way
to change the system."
A possible alternative to scrapping
Stanford's grading system, which has no D or
F marks, would be to ask professors to
toughen their standards. "I can't believe that
students are that much smarter than they used
to be," Rosenzweig commented, "but if they
are, the standards should be stiffened."
Rosenzweig warned that this was purely a
faculty matter. Pressure on a professor
"comes best from among his colleagues rather

than from the administration," he stated.
Even when the administration recognizes a
particular professor's reputation as an easy
grader, Rosenzweig said there are "not very
many sanctions available in situations of that
kind."
Rosenzweig says he's never heard of a
situation where a professor has received
pressure from his peers to grade more strictly.
Nevertheless, at least two professors who
obtained some notoriety for teaching so-called
"micks" toughened their standards noticeably
last year, perhaps in response to such pressure.
