# 'Live Oak' Teete, Totters But Won't Go Over Edge
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Live Oak has made it through another
week, battered, bruised, but still breathing.
It's getting to be an old story.
Bill Weinstein's fledgling newspaper,
conceived in love last faf£ has weathered more
stormy weather than Noah's Ark during its
brief 10 months on earth. Life hasn't gotten
any easier lately.
Almost from the beginning Weinstein has
fought the ASSU Publications Board over
money and space for Live Oak. This summer
he added another major antagonist ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri who
jousted with Weinstein again this week. "
The latest issue was whether the Dean of
Student Affairs' Office should loan Live Oak
$2OOO to ease through an early financial
crunch. -
When?
The problem was not that Live Oak wasn't
selling enough advertising everyone agrees
the sales have been fine but when the
money will actually come in.
Advertisers usually take between 60 and 90
days to pay their bills and until that money
starts rolling in Live Oak doesn't have any
cash to pay bills. The paper needed credit
badly, and couldn't get it either from the
ASSU Typesetting Shop (which is under
Olivieri's control) or Nowels Publications,
where the actual printing is done.
When Olivieri stood firm on his decision to
refuse Live Oak credit ("they're a credit risk,
a credit risk with a capital C") Weinstein
sought a $2OOO loan from the University.
After some hemming and hawing, Stanford
agreed to put up enough money (about $500)
to pay for Live Oak's typesetting for the next
two weeks.
That's a major boon, but Weinstein and
Company are by no means home free. They've
still got to figure out how to come up with
the money to pay for printing, which is by far
their largest expense. Some money is coming
in from September advertising, but even
Weinstein admits he doesn't know if it will be
enough.
Won't Make It
Olivieri opposed the loan to Live Oak, and
he still predicts the publication won't make it
through the next few weeks. "His chances are
as good as the amount of credit Nowels
Publications is willing to give him," Olivieri
said.
Olivieri and several other campus figures
who have opposed Live Oak seemed to be
gloating just a little over the week's events.
It's not hard to understand why. Olivieri
predicted last month that Live Oak would
have cash flow problems of the sort it's
experiencing right now.
But the newspaper's management insisted
everything was fine. "As far as finances are
concerned, we are in Fat City" managing
editor Jan Agosti shrugged. "The question is
resolved simply by picking up the paper and
looking at it."
That was a far too blase attitude, and if
nothing else Live Oak should have learned
during the past week that the question is
much more complicated.

In away, nothing seems to have changed at
week's end. Live Oak is still admittedly short
of cash. Olivieri still says it will fold.
Weinstein still insists the money is coming in.
And Live Oak is still publishing.
Whether the last statement will still be true
in a few weeks is still open for speculation.
But those who bet against the feisty Weinstein
fly in the face of history. "I can count 15
times when we've been dead and buried," he
said in midweek. "And we're still here." In
the end, Live Oak's amazing ability to bounce
back will probably assert itself once again.

Live Oak has made it through another
week, battered, bruised, but still breathing.
It's getting to be an old story.
Bill Weinstein's fledgling newspaper,
conceived in love last faf£ has weathered more
stormy weather than Noah's Ark during its
brief 10 months on earth. Life hasn't gotten
any easier lately.
Almost from the beginning Weinstein has
fought the ASSU Publications Board over
money and space for Live Oak. This summer
he added another major antagonist ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri who
jousted with Weinstein again this week. "
The latest issue was whether the Dean of
Student Affairs' Office should loan Live Oak
$2OOO to ease through an early financial
crunch. -
When?
The problem was not that Live Oak wasn't
selling enough advertising everyone agrees
the sales have been fine but when the
money will actually come in.
Advertisers usually take between 60 and 90
days to pay their bills and until that money
starts rolling in Live Oak doesn't have any
cash to pay bills. The paper needed credit
badly, and couldn't get it either from the
ASSU Typesetting Shop (which is under
Olivieri's control) or Nowels Publications,
where the actual printing is done.
When Olivieri stood firm on his decision to
refuse Live Oak credit ("they're a credit risk,
a credit risk with a capital C") Weinstein
sought a $2OOO loan from the University.
After some hemming and hawing, Stanford
agreed to put up enough money (about $500)
to pay for Live Oak's typesetting for the next
two weeks.
That's a major boon, but Weinstein and
Company are by no means home free. They've
still got to figure out how to come up with
the money to pay for printing, which is by far
their largest expense. Some money is coming
in from September advertising, but even
Weinstein admits he doesn't know if it will be
enough.
Won't Make It
Olivieri opposed the loan to Live Oak, and
he still predicts the publication won't make it
through the next few weeks. "His chances are
as good as the amount of credit Nowels
Publications is willing to give him," Olivieri
said.
Olivieri and several other campus figures
who have opposed Live Oak seemed to be
gloating just a little over the week's events.
It's not hard to understand why. Olivieri
predicted last month that Live Oak would
have cash flow problems of the sort it's
experiencing right now.
But the newspaper's management insisted
everything was fine. "As far as finances are
concerned, we are in Fat City" managing
editor Jan Agosti shrugged. "The question is
resolved simply by picking up the paper and
looking at it."
That was a far too blase attitude, and if
nothing else Live Oak should have learned
during the past week that the question is
much more complicated.

In away, nothing seems to have changed at
week's end. Live Oak is still admittedly short
of cash. Olivieri still says it will fold.
Weinstein still insists the money is coming in.
And Live Oak is still publishing.
Whether the last statement will still be true
in a few weeks is still open for speculation.
But those who bet against the feisty Weinstein
