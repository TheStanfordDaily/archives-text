# ...Along With University Costs

The Board of Trustees reportedly was not
particulary surprised or depressed by a five
year forecast predicting a rocky financial
future for the University.
The study showed that with the
extrapolation of current figures, Stanford
might face a $22 million deficit in five years if
the gap between expenditures and income
goes unchecked.
This problem of expenses outgrowing
income is far from new. This was to be the
last year of the Budget Adjustment Program
(BAP), a program of financial reallocations
designed to bring the budget into balance.
However, the bottom fell out of the stock
market and the University lost over $2 million
in projected income for the 1973-74 fiscal
year. Through additional reallocations,
postponement of programs and hiring
practices, the $2 million deficit was reduced
to about $700,000 by the end of the 1973-74
fiscal year.
No Quick Solution
Stanford's financial woes persist, however,
and the programs of reallocations and
"holdbacks" cannot be expanded significantly
to cover the new projected deficit and bring
the budget quickly into balance.
There is not much you can do to make an
educational institution more economically
efficient. Small classes' and innovative
programs are by definition part of the
educational process.
There remains little in the way of
alternatives now except to bite the bullet and
begin making significant cuts in the actual
budget base. This means cutting programs,
administrative personnel and faculty, "the
meat" of the University.
Less People
Since most of the operating budget is in
the form of salaries and wages, there are going
to be fewer people working for Stanford
in the future.
In addition to cutting expenses, the
University will attempt to boost income
levels. This means a continual rise of tuition.
Thus cuts to be made are rather healthy
slices out of the present budget. The $lO
million to be cut over the next three years
represents 16 percent of the budgets affected.
The deficit spending that will be necessary
for the next few years until the budget is
(hopefully) balanced will come close to
wiping out the University's cash reserves.
Cut Expansion
In general, the University can no longer
support the expansion that has been typical in
the past decades.
Many critics single out this expansion as
the source of the present financial crunch.
Had the University concentrated on building
its endowment during the Sterling
administration instead of promoting great
expansion, it would not be in its current
plight, they argue.
More liberal investment policies prompted

by the bull stock market in the past years may
not have helped in the long run either.
There is some weight to the position that
higher education is no longer near the top of
society's priorities but has "moved nearer to
the middle of a much longer social agenda," as
President Lyman said.
There will probably be no more of the
uncontrolled expansion that has characterized
the University and the nation in the past.
Improvement can occur only at the expense

of older outdated projects or lower priority
commitments., Additions can come only with
simultaneous subtractions; an equilibrium
must be reached.
So in the past where the University has
sponsored almost everything without
question, it must now choose those programs
and ideas that are the most important. This
implies a new responsibility; a resonsibility to
see that past and proven wisdom is sustained
and that innovation is not neglected.
