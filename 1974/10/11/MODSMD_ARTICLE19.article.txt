# Some Minor Mistakes
## Lecture Note Plan Could Work 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN GLENN GARVIN 
ASSU President Mike Herman unveiled his
second big project last week. This one could
work, if some problems are cleared.
Herman proposed an ASSU Lecture Note
Service, designed to provide low-cost notes to
students. The theory's all right, but a few silly
mistakes combined with possible faculty
hostility could bring the whole thing
crashing down around his head.
Some of the classes Herman selected for
the service are not at all Suited for
standardized notes. And at least one professor
has indicated he may discourage students
from subscribing to the service.
Others don't go that far, but say they
aren't fully convinced of its worth.
Worried
Vic Petroff, the service's director, admits
he's worried about the faculty response to the
idea. Petroff sent out 16 letters to faculty
members last week, asking their permission to
operate the service in their classes. He won't
know if they approve until he contacts them
next week.
A quick Daily poll of eight of the
professors indicated there were no violent
objections to the service but a few doubted
a note-taking service would help their
students.
Physics Prof. Ewart Thomas said "in
general, the program is a good idea, but
probably not in my class. I follow the
textbook quite closely, and there is no need
to take notes except occasionally on the
examples I give."
Angles
Prof. Gordon Craig, chairman of the
History Department, said, "I have my doubts
as to what the pedagogical value of such a
program would be. I don't think the
advantages are as clearly defined as the ASSU
would like us to believe. There may be some
angles we haven't seen."
But Craig refused to mention any "angles,"
and said his opinion of the service could
change after he speaks with other people in
his department.
Biology Prof. Peter Ray said he approved
of the program for his classes, adding, "I'm

for anything which will help the students
learn."
Physics Prof. Alan Schwettman had no
objection to the service, but said there would
probably be no need for the notetaker to take
more than a page of notes at every lecture.
Worth It?
Whether such notes would be worth the $4
minimum charge per quarter is unclear. And
that brings up the question of financial
feasibility.
All of the 16 classes chosen for the
program had an enrollment of more than 200
last spring. The average number of student
subscribers in each class must be 57 for the
program to break even, according to the
service's business plan.
But two of the classes may have no
demand for the notes.
,One of these, Communication 2258, allows
students to listen to prominent speakers in

journalism/communication and file
one-paragraph evaluations. No tests, no notes,
one unit.
Another class which will no doubt have
demand problems is Biology 4Y, which "is a
series of labs, and comes with a detailed lab
manual" according to Prof. Ray. No notes
would be needed in the class, he added.
Where Are They?
So the 57 student subscribers needed from
each of these cliasses must be made up
elsewhere, and whether this can be done is
still up in the air .. . especially if professors
discourage their students from using the
service.
"Students taking their own notes does have
advantages," pointed out Biology Prof. John
Brauman. "First of all, it keeps them awake."
He added the ability to take notes is a valuable
one for students.
Although he would allow the service in his
class, Brauman said he may discourage his
students from using it.
Both Herman and Petroff hope the service
will attract a large number of pre-meds in the
natural sciences, where competition is stiff. "If
the program doesn't work here, it won't work
at all," Herman said.
That's probably true but unless there's
some degree of faculty acceptance and Petroff
straightens out the financial details, it won't
work anyway.
