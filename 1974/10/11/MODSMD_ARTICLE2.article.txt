These 10 candidates ran as a slate.
According to Elections
Commissioner Tom Fitzgerald, 2411
students voted during the two days of
balloting. Two hundred ballots were
sent overseas, and those returned will
be tabulated sometime next week,
making the results final, Fitzgerald
said.
There were 73 undergraduates and
11 graduate candidates.
Underwood, Toliver, Echaveste and

Harris were members of the ASSU
Senate last year. Echaveste ran on a
slate for the ASSU presidency last
spring, but finished second. Turner
was chairman of the ASSU Senate last
,year.
Fitzgerald emphasized that the
results were tentative and could
change. Tim Conway finished eleventh
with 275 votes, only one behind
Toliver.
Debbi Silton received 271 votes,
Jody Meisel and Mike Sumner both
received 268 votes. Usually few ballots
are returned from overseas, but
students tend to vote in blocks.
The graduate results are final,
however, because there are no
graduate students overseas. The only
graduate candidate to lose was Rocky
Barber, who served in the Senate since
his freshman year. He also headed an
ASSU presidential slate in April 1972.
Barber received 117 votes for senator.
The 20 senators will hold their first
meeting Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in
Room 75 of the Graduate School of
Business. ASSU President Mike
Herman said that the first order of
business will be to ratify the elections.
Meetings of the ASSU Senate are open
to the public.
Germane, Strnad, Silton and
Sumner were affiliated with the
Columbae House slate. Columbae is
the peace theme house. Their platform
included a statement of support for
fraternities and theme houses to be
exempt from the draw.
The 10 winning graduate students,
calling themselves the Graduate
Student Coalition, represent six
different schools and nine individual
departments.
The slate said it hopes to focus
attention on the issues of housing,
health care, a food co - op, child care,
the special needs of minority, foreign
and women students, single parents,
and cooperation between the ASSU
and Escondido Village.

the 10 highest vote-getters are:
Robert M. Nelson 194, Pieter
Winsemius 192, Sandra Dunn 180,
Janice L. Haney 180, Mike Lindsay
178, Deb Mukherjee 173, Ken Perry
169, Henry A. Harman 169, David
Harris 168 and William N. Hoke 165.
These 10 candidates ran as a slate.
According to Elections
Commissioner Tom Fitzgerald, 2411
students voted during the two days of
balloting. Two hundred ballots were
sent overseas, and those returned will
be tabulated sometime next week,
making the results final, Fitzgerald
said.
There were 73 undergraduates and
11 graduate candidates.
Underwood, Toliver, Echaveste and

Harris were members of the ASSU
Senate last year. Echaveste ran on a
slate for the ASSU presidency last
spring, but finished second. Turner
was chairman of the ASSU Senate last
,year.
Fitzgerald emphasized that the
results were tentative and could
change. Tim Conway finished eleventh
with 275 votes, only one behind
Toliver.
Debbi Silton received 271 votes,
Jody Meisel and Mike Sumner both
received 268 votes. Usually few ballots
are returned from overseas, but
students tend to vote in blocks.
The graduate results are final,
however, because there are no
graduate students overseas. The only
graduate candidate to lose was Rocky
Barber, who served in the Senate since
his freshman year. He also headed an
ASSU presidential slate in April 1972.
Barber received 117 votes for senator.
The 20 senators will hold their first
meeting Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in
Room 75 of the Graduate School of
Business. ASSU President Mike
Herman said that the first order of
business will be to ratify the elections.
Meetings of the ASSU Senate are open
to the public.
Germane, Strnad, Silton and
Sumner were affiliated with the
Columbae House slate. Columbae is
the peace theme house. Their platform
included a statement of support for
fraternities and theme houses to be
exempt from the draw.
The 10 winning graduate students,
calling themselves the Graduate
Student Coalition, represent six
different schools and nine individual
departments.
The slate said it hopes to focus
attention on the issues of housing,
health care, a food co - op, child care,
the special needs of minority, foreign
and women students, single parents,
and cooperation between the ASSU
and Escondido Village.
Tentative results are in for the
ASSU Senate elections.
