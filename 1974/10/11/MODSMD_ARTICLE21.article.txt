# McCloskey's New Image: Potentially Disastrous
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Despite recent conservative gestures, Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park), can't
seem to lose his liberal image.
Running for a fifth term in the 12th
Congressional District, which includes
Stanford, McCloskey appears likely to win
strong bipartisan support in his effort to
defeat Santa Clara County Mayor Gary
Gillmor.
McCloskey won national attention in the
early 1950s for his outspoken opposition to
the Indochina War. In a bid for the
Republican presidential nomination in 1972,
McCloskey so antagonized the mainline GOP
that he became persona non grata in most
Republican circles.
By 1973, McCloskey was so disgusted with
the Nixon Administraton that he changed his
voter registration to "decline to state."
Back In Their Arms Again
But with Gerald Ford in the White House,
McCloskey is very much a Republican again

and is taking an increasingly conservative
stand on many issues. Tacitly endorsed by
Ford last spring in his tough primary race
against right-wing businessman J. Gordon
Knapp, McCloskey has beei\ fulsome in his
praise for the President.
Even Ford's pardon of McCloskey's old
nemesis Richard Nixon brought only the
mildest expressions of discontent from
McCloskey and this protest occurred only
after his constituents registered outrage.
Some of McCloskey's critics claim that his
new attitude is based on the scare he received
last spring when Knapp came within one
percentage point of defeating him.
McCloskey, they contend, 'is mending his
political fences.
Little Change
But a more reasonable explanation is that
McCloskey's basic views and stands on the
issues have changed little. Elected in 1967 as a
moderate, McCloskey always retained his
middle of the road beliefs, but was stirred to
what was at first perceived as radicalisms by
two issues: the Indochinese war and the
dishonesty of the Nixon Administration.
With those two issues largely gone, his
inherent centrism seems more pronounced.
An example of this is the difference
between McCloskey and Gillmor on the issue
of national health insurance. McCloskey
strongly favors the Ford Administration's
version of the plan, which is relatively
inexpensive and favorable to insurance
companies. Gillmor supports the Kennedy
plan, which is costly and would place both/the
medical profession and the insurance
companies at more of a disadvantage.
McCloskey is more liberal than Gillmor on
those social measures which appeal to
prosperous progressives like legalized
abortion and abolition of the death penalty.
But on economic issues the balanced budget
is a case in point McCloskey is considerably
more conservative than Gillmor.
Furthermore, McCloskey has not
consistently supported equal rights for women
and has expressed pessimism about the success
of the volunteer army.
Come Home
Gillmor strategists are basing their hopes
on the possibility of McCloskey's liberal image
becoming so tarnished that Democratic voters
will return to the fold.
Stanford is expected to give McCloskey his
biennial landslide. Although many students
probably don't agree with McCloskey's new
conservatism, many students can't help being
loyal to him.
But even the most solid reputations can be
broken. If Gillmor strategists exploit
McCloskey's support for Ford, it is entirely
possible that Gillmor could carry the campus.
Many students are already expressing
disillusionment with McCloskey.
For some reason, Gillmor's campaign
managers seem reluctant to publicize their
candidate here. Wade Brummel, McCloskey's
campaign man press secretary, told the Daily
this week that Gillmor has no immediate plans
to appear on campus.
Meanwhile, McCloskey, a Stanford
alumnus, has made his usual round of
campaign appearances on campus and
maintains a strong student organization.
Although McCloskey appears strong, his
new conservatism could make him vulnerable
by* costing him liberal votes without gaining
him conservative ones. McCloskey may well
be beatable and if so, Gillmor's fear of the
Stanford campus could cost him the election.
