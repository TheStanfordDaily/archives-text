# Dead Or Alive?
## Newton Still Missing 
### 
OAKLAND (AP) A 17-year-old prostitute
clings to life with a bullet in her head, two other
women have been beaten, and an Oakland tailor
struggles to recover from skull fractures.
And Black Panther Leader Huey P. Newton is a
wanted man.
The cofounder of the militant Black Panther
party has been missing since Aug. 23, when he
forfeited $42,000 bail on charges in the violent
incidents, which occurred over a two-month period.
Newton's brother, his lawyer and friends say the
32-year-old revolutionary has been the target of
police harassment, plotting and possibly of an
assasination. The authorities say Newton may have
fled the San Francisco Bay Area and perhaps the
country, or could be dead.
"Huey has never missed a court date," said
Charles Garry, Newton's attorney since the Black
Panther's murder trials began in 1967. /
Foul Play
"That's why I say he's either the victim of foul
play or he's just said, 'the hell with it, I've had it,"
and left town.
"The state owes Huey 33 months of hard time
he spent in jail during the murder trial. You get to
the point where you're harassed, worked over and
pushed around you may not want to spend
another 33 months in prison to prove you're
innocent."
Newton was convicted in the policeman's death,
but that verdict was overturned on appeal. Two
more trials ended in hung juries and charges were
dropped.
Assault
He now is charged with three counts of assault
with a deadly weapon, two of battery and one of
false imprisonment.
His brother, Melvin, an instructor at Oakland's
Merritt College, said the disappearance "took us all
by surprise. We were completely unprepared for it.
"Huey lived with police surveillance, bugging
and harassment every day," said Mel Newton. "He
didn't make a special issue of it. It wouldn't have
kept him from making his court appearance that
day, but of course killing him may have.
Battle with Police
"There was a running battle between Huey and
the Oakland police. If he's been killed, my guess is
that they're behind it," he said in an interview.
Capt. Robert Bernard, chief investigator for the
Alameda County district attorney, said he believes
Newton either skipped bail or was killed by
dissident Panthers.
"You gotta remember that Newton wasn't very
popular with his own people anymore," said
Bernard, who has investigated Newton and other

Panthers since the mid-60s.
Cocaine Habit
"He had a big cocaine habit by the time he
disappeared and was shaking down local bar owners
and hookers to help support it.
"All that stuff about harassment is baloney, too.
Newton attracted cops because he was a violent
man - and he's not going to change."
â€¢ From November 1970 until he disappeared,
Newton lived in a 25th floor penthouse above
Oakland's Lake Merritt, paid for by the local
Panther chapter. It was said Newton feared
assassination by vengeful police or by members of
the more militant "international wing" of the party
led by fugitive Panther Eldridge Cleaver. Newton's
luxurious, $650-a-month apartment became his
prison.
"Huey considered being, on the street no
different then being in jail," said Garry.
Garry said Newton's penthouse was under
constant observation. He has copies of a purported
FBI file authorizing funds to rent a penthouse next
door to Newton and the use of bugs and wiretaps.
He also has copies of purported FBI directives to
agents to "cause dissension among Black Panther
Party officials leading to the destruction of the
party."
John Kelley, deputy special agent in charge in
San Francisco, said the FBI had "no special interest
in Huey Newton," but did not deny there was an
ongoing investigation.
"I can tell you we watch any organization with
trouble-makers in its membership."
"They think if they break Huey, the ipJSrty will
fold," said Garry. "There's a cop following Huey
every time he leaves the apartment. It's interesting
that when he gets shot at there's no cop around."
Police refused to comment on Garry's assertion.
The young woman whom Newton allegedly shot
is unnamed. She and the 57-year-old tailor Newton
allegedly assaulted in his apartment while being
fitted for a suit are in unnamed hospitals.
Police also refuse to say what evidence linking
Newton to the girl's shooting they found in
Newton's penthouse Aug. 17, the night the tailor
said he was beaten. It was his report that brought
police to the apartment.
Articles taken from the apartment include a
.357 magnum pistol and a .45-caliber automatic.
Police also confiscated Newton's passport.
Dist. Atty. Jensen won't talk about specifics in
the case because they are "evidentiary matters."
Bernard, who says he "broke down and cried"
when Newton's murder conviction was overturned,
said, "This time we've got him cold and he knows
it."
