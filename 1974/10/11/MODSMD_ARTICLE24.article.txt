Individual colleges should stop
trying to be all things to all
people, pledge themselves to
"truth in educational packaging"
and show self-confidence in
defining their own objectives,
President Richard W. Lyman said
yesterday.
He delivered a strong plea for
pluralism in a keynote address
prepared for the American
Council on Education's 57th
annual meeting, held at the Town
and Country Convention Center
in San Diego.
While higher education should
remain responsive to public needs,
it is "futile and self-destructive"
for individual institutions "to
spend our energies flailing around
for ways to become all things to
all people," he declared.
Administratbrs and educators
should learn to reject demands for
courses which do not fit their
school's objectives, he added.
Greater Condor
Calling for greater candor,
Lyman said student recruitment
literature shows "a marked
tendency toward inflated claims
and a studious avoidance of any
reference to shortcomings .. .We
ought to be as skeptical of jargon
and doubletalk in our own
pronouncements ... as we are of
other people's."
Higher education must concern
itself with ends, as well as means,
he added: "If there is corruption
in high places; if there is a
pervasive nastiness and antihuman
quality in too many of our
leisure-time pursuits; if there is a
shrinking of public spirit and a
dangerous degree of self-seeking
sterility in private aspirations in
America, while we do not bear the
whole responsibility, neither can
we disclaim our share .. . , -

"If it makes us uncomfortable
to admit this, and I believe it
does, then that in itself is a sign of
ill health in the educational
enterprise . ..
"Given the size of our money
problems alone, it is small wonder
if most of us college presidents
find it difficult to think beyond
sheer institutional survival as an
objective," Lyman said. "And given
the often brutal encroachment of
lay authorities upon academic
terrain ... as regents override
presidents and faculties,
legislatures override regents, and
the federal government and the
courts undertake to decide who
shall have tenure and how the
football team is to be fed, no
wonder that. .. most presidents
are wholly preoccupied with
preserving what they can of
institutional autonomy in
American higher education.
"But maybe among the reasons
why we see, on the part of
surrounding society, such
reluctance to provide our
institutions with adequate funding
and such eagerness to provide
unasked for guidance, is the fact
that we appear to be so uncertain
about our fundamental objectives,
let alone how we are going to
achieve them."
Responsiveness
The struggles of the late 1960s
stemmed from "our
responsiveness to earlier public
demands that caused us to
bureaucratize ourselves, to
outgrow our institutional
clothing, and appear to be eager
to help the government in all
those familiar nefarious schemes,
from the defoliation of Southeast
Asian forests to the dehumanizing
of subjects of behavioral research.
"And we're still at it, nervously
peering at the world around us, in

search of .. . anything that might
ingratiate us with the public, from
high school students to chairmen
of legislative committees."
"Total responsiveness,
tempered by bureaucracy and
professional protectiveness [is]
the worst of all possible worlds,"
Lyman said.
"We should be willing to
forego an opportunity now and
then ... focusing upon doing well
what [the institution is] doing
already, which—if you're like
most American colleges and
universities, is probably too much
as it is.
Lyman currently heads the
Commission on Federal Relations
of the American Association of
Universities, a group of more than
40 top graduate schools.

"Given the size of our money
problems alone, it is small wonder

let alone how we are going to

Responsiveness
The struggles of the late 1960s
stemmed from "our
responsiveness to earlier public
demands that caused us to
bureaucratize ourselves, to
outgrow our institutional
clothing, and appear to be eager
to help the government in all
those familiar nefarious schemes,
from the defoliation of Southeast
Asian forests to the dehumanizing
of subjects of behavioral research.
"And we're still at it, nervously
peering at the world around us, in

search of .. . anything that might
ingratiate us with the public, from
high school students to chairmen
of legislative committees."
"Total responsiveness,
tempered by bureaucracy and
professional protectiveness [is]
the worst of all possible worlds,"
Lyman said.
"We should be willing to
forego an opportunity now and
then ... focusing upon doing well
what [the institution is] doing
already, which—if you're like
most American colleges and
universities, is probably too much
as it is.

Individual colleges should stop
trying to be all things to all
people, pledge themselves to
"truth in educational packaging"
and show self-confidence in
defining their own objectives,
President Richard W. Lyman said
yesterday.
He delivered a strong plea for
pluralism in a keynote address
prepared for the American
Council on Education's 57th
annual meeting, held at the Town
and Country Convention Center
in San Diego.
While higher education should
remain responsive to public needs,
it is "futile and self-destructive"
for individual institutions "to
spend our energies flailing around
for ways to become all things to
all people," he declared.
Administratbrs and educators
should learn to reject demands for
courses which do not fit their
school's objectives, he added.
Greater Condor
Calling for greater candor,
Lyman said student recruitment
literature shows "a marked
tendency toward inflated claims
and a studious avoidance of any
reference to shortcomings .. .We
ought to be as skeptical of jargon
and doubletalk in our own
pronouncements ... as we are of
other people's."
Higher education must concern
itself with ends, as well as means,
he added: "If there is corruption
in high places; if there is a
pervasive nastiness and antihuman
quality in too many of our
leisure-time pursuits; if there is a
shrinking of public spirit and a
dangerous degree of self-seeking
sterility in private aspirations in
America, while we do not bear the
whole responsibility, neither can
we disclaim our share .. . , -
