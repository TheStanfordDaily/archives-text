# TGIF Parties Included
## Tresidder Offers New Programs 
### ELIZABETH POLLOCK 
The Tresidder Program Board's trips to
Disneyland and the Napa Valley last spring went
"super well," and this year's activities may be just
as good, according to Board member Marcie
Axelrad. Offerings so far include lectures, films,
more trips, a student art show, and three craft
classes.
Enrollment is still open for the jewelry, loom
weaving and leatherwork classes which start this
week and another board member, Rick Redman, will
start soliciting student art work for the art show
this week.
The board is also offering TGIF parties every
Friday afternoon and weekly films with lectures.
All of this quarter's speakers have been drawn from
University faculty, because they are "interesting
people," Axelrad said.
The board would like to offer two fishing trips
and a possible tour of the Hopkins Marine Station,
Redman said.

The board is "trying to involve Stanford
students in the Stanford corrtmunity," he
explained. "We all work on everything."
However, Axelrad noted, "We've really had a
problem with publicity."
To maintain the University's non-profit status,
Tresidder programs cannot be publicized
off-campus, and Axelrad said that "running all over
campus, putting things over the toilets," is not
much fun.
Other board members are Jamesetta Bunn,
sophomore; Karen Chang, senior and Cincy
Ellwood, sophomore. All members were selected
from a field of 20 applicants last February.
Under the direction of program manager Roger
Thacker, and Dan William, associate dean of
student affairs* the board will expand to five
committees this fall.
Each committee will be responsible for either
lectures and symposiums, crafts and workshops,
films and social events, cultural events, or trips and
recreational activities.
