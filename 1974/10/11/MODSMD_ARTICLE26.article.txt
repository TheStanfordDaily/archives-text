# Satellite Project Advice
## Profs To Aid Alaska 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Suggestions by a group of
Stanford engineering students for
a cheap and efficient satellite
communications system may well
help Alaska Gov. William A. Egan
evaluate alternatives to a proposed
RCA Corp. plan he finds
inadequate for the state's
communications needs.
Egan last week rejected the
RCA plan, proposing the state
contribute $lOO million for a
share of two satellites to be
launched next year, and their
ground receiving stations. The
system would provide badly
needed television and telephone
service to remote Alaskan towns
unreachable by any economic
ground communication system.
At Egan's request, two
Stanford professors last night flew

to Juneau, the state capital,
carrying with them satellite
systems analyses developed over
several years through their own
projects and work done by
engineering Ph.D. candidates.
Two Engineering 235 classes
also contributed research.
'Rip Off'
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Bruce Lusignan, one of the
instructors, called the RCA plan
"an unnecessary rip off" which
could cost Alaska three to five
times as much as the best
alternative found by Stanford
researchers.
He accused RCA of
anticipating necessary revenues of
$lOO million for a project with
identified expenditures requiring
just over $3O noting that
the company offered "no
coherent explanation of what that
large excess of money would be
used for."
Communication Prof. Ed
Parker, who accompanied
Lusignan, was not available for
comment yesterday.
An aide to Egan last week said
the Federal Communications
Commission had told RCA it
would not approve its entry into
the domestic satellite field until
the plan met approval of the
Alaska Public Utilities
Commission.
RCA had planned the satellites,
one of which would serve as a
back-up to transmit signals from
the East Coast to Alaska.
'Won't Work'
Even at a reduced price, the
RCA plan contains costly
unnecessary frills and proposals
that "just won't work because
they ignored some of the basic
laws of physics," Lusignan said.
He pointed to the proposed
RCA satellites to be orbited

25,000 miles from earth and
designed to transmit a television
signal of five watts. "Five watts is
just not enough power stations
will get a signal that looks at best .
like the worst channel in the Bay
Area," Lusignan said.
"If the satellite produced a
50-watt television signal, it could
use less sophisticated ground
receiving stations that cost much
less and receive high quality
signals," Lusignan said in referring
to the Stanford research.
"But they'd have to change
their satellite, and they just don't
want to do that."
Lusignan estimated that a
five-watt receiver station costs
around $lOO,OOO, the 50-watt
station costs only $5OOO.
He also claimed the Stanford
research could prove "the RCA
system has been created to
operate with much larger ground
systems than are necessary."
"Their same signal could be
obtained with smaller, less
expensive antennae and cheaper,
less powerful transmitters a
much less sophisticated system"
to accommodate Alaska's needs. !

Lusignan estimated that a
five-watt receiver station costs
around $lOO,OOO, the 50-watt
station costs only $5OOO.
He also claimed the Stanford
research could prove "the RCA
system has been created to
operate with much larger ground
systems than are necessary."
"Their same signal could be
obtained with smaller, less
expensive antennae and cheaper,
less powerful transmitters a
much less sophisticated system"
to accommodate Alaska's needs. !

Suggestions by a group of
Stanford engineering students for
a cheap and efficient satellite
communications system may well
help Alaska Gov. William A. Egan
evaluate alternatives to a proposed
RCA Corp. plan he finds
inadequate for the state's
communications needs.
Egan last week rejected the
RCA plan, proposing the state
contribute $lOO million for a
share of two satellites to be
launched next year, and their
ground receiving stations. The
system would provide badly
needed television and telephone
service to remote Alaskan towns
unreachable by any economic
ground communication system.
At Egan's request, two
Stanford professors last night flew

to Juneau, the state capital,
carrying with them satellite
systems analyses developed over
several years through their own
projects and work done by
engineering Ph.D. candidates.
Two Engineering 235 classes
also contributed research.
'Rip Off'
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Bruce Lusignan, one of the
instructors, called the RCA plan
"an unnecessary rip off" which
could cost Alaska three to five
times as much as the best
alternative found by Stanford
researchers.
He accused RCA of
anticipating necessary revenues of
$lOO million for a project with
identified expenditures requiring
just over $3O noting that
the company offered "no
coherent explanation of what that
large excess of money would be
used for."
Communication Prof. Ed
Parker, who accompanied
Lusignan, was not available for
comment yesterday.
An aide to Egan last week said
the Federal Communications
Commission had told RCA it
would not approve its entry into
the domestic satellite field until
the plan met approval of the
Alaska Public Utilities
Commission.
RCA had planned the satellites,
one of which would serve as a
back-up to transmit signals from
the East Coast to Alaska.
'Won't Work'
Even at a reduced price, the
RCA plan contains costly
unnecessary frills and proposals
that "just won't work because
they ignored some of the basic
laws of physics," Lusignan said.
He pointed to the proposed
RCA satellites to be orbited

25,000 miles from earth and
designed to transmit a television
signal of five watts. "Five watts is
just not enough power stations
will get a signal that looks at best .
like the worst channel in the Bay
Area," Lusignan said.
"If the satellite produced a
50-watt television signal, it could
use less sophisticated ground
receiving stations that cost much
less and receive high quality
signals," Lusignan said in referring
to the Stanford research.
"But they'd have to change
their satellite, and they just don't
want to do that."
Lusignan estimated that a
five-watt receiver station costs
around $lOO,OOO, the 50-watt
station costs only $5OOO.
He also claimed the Stanford
research could prove "the RCA
