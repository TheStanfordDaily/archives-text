# Harvest Time: Pickers, Growers
## 
### D. PAUL YEUELL 
Harvest begins before dawn in the
California North Coast vineyards of Napa,
Sonoma and Mendocino Counties,
Before anything else has begun to move
in the early-morning North Coast fog, the
pickers, almost entirely itinerant Mexicans,
have already begun dropping clumps of
grapes into wooden boxes.
"Cartas . .. cartas aqui," yell the pickers
as the first boxes of the day are filled with
fruit.
The California North Coast growers,
determined to develop a domestic market
of premium wines, are establishing
vineyards of Chardonnay, Cabernet, Pinot
Noir, Gewurz Traminer and other premium
grapes. The finest of these vineyards are on
mountainsides and are naturally irrigated.
But mountainside vineyards are more
difficult to harvest. Pickers in mountain
vineyards are paid nearly twice as much as
pickers in the San Joaquin Valley. Most of
the pickers in the North Coast Vineyards
are Mexicans, hired by a farm contractor.
Not all have visas.
During the harvest season, helicopters
commissioned by the Immigration Bureau
buzz the rugged Mendocino County
Mountains checking the vineyards to keep
tabs on the legal, and not-so-legal, workers.
The farm contractor, who gets the
pickers together with the growers, needs a
Social Security number from each of the
workers to stay square with Uncle Sam.
According to one Sonoma contractor, it's a
good bet that one-third of the Social
Security numbers are made up in the
vineyard.
No Union
The United Farm Workers (UFW) union
has not caught on in the North Coast
counties and probably never will, the
contractor said, since growers' associations

and some wineries have pension and
benefit programs that are more attractive
than the UFW's.
The Napa Valley Foundation, an
organization of Napa growers, provides a
pension plan and vacation pay for any
picker that handles a Napa Valley grape,
even if he is a foreigner on a short-term
work visa.
In the steep, hillside vineyards pickers
worry" the full vines like hairdressers,
cutting clumps of grapes. These wine
grapes vary in color from the Pinot Noir,
which is virtually black, to the Traminer,
which ranges from deep purple through red
and orange to yellow and green.
All In The Box
Everything goes into the picking boxes
grapes, stems, some leaves, insects, lizards,
a mouse now and then, a smear or two of
bird crap and maybe a sparrow's nest.
Then it all gets dumped into a truck and
the truck bumps its way down to the
winery followed by a cloud of honey-bees.
In the crusher at the winery, everything
goes to juice. The image of the happy
peasant stomping the grapes bare-footed is
rudely dispelled by a huge stainless steel
beast that crushes, separates, and extracts
the juice with shiny paddles, pumps and
pipes.
At this point, what will next year be a
clear, white premium dessert wine looks
like Mississippi Delta water.
Another stainless beast, surrounded by a
cloud of honey-bees, pumps the juice off
to the vintner and the skins and stems go
into a dump truck. The day's harvest is
now the winery's stock.
The bees swarm around his head
without stinging him as he puts down the
long rake, rests an arm on the stainless tub
and grinning, eats fat fistfuls of grapes, a
modern day Bacchus in faded overalls.
