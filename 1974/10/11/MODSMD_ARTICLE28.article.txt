# Educator Debates Women's Motivation

### MEG HALLORAN 
Women who succeed in higher
education are often graduates of
all-female high schools or colleges,
Dr. Patricia Graham, president of
the Radcliffe Institute and vice
president of Radcliffe College,
said Wednesday afternoon.
Talking on "Women in Higher
Education" in a program
sponsored by the Center for
Research on Women (CROW),
Graham said that until the
mid-60s, co-educational
institutions "never even pretended
to rank the advancement of
women among their priorities."
At single-sex high schools and
colleges, Graham said, a young
woman is more likely to benefit
from the support and counseling
professors tend to direct toward
men in co-ed schools. Also, a
young woman's "academic
experience can be isolated from
the other exciting experiences"
common to her age.
At co-ed universities, Graham
claimed, women have often been
channeled into sex-related
curricula such as home economics
and elementary education, and
frequently find it difficult to
transfer to other departments
when their interests change.
Although an internal support
system tends to make sorority
sisters high academic achievers,
members do not usually develop
success goals for subsequent life.
She pointed out that women
from immigrant families often

demonstrate the same success
patterns as women from single-sex
schools. A woman who has
experienced two social modes, she
explained, is apparently less likely
to accept and internalize the
"monolithic standards" of
subsidiary sex-roles for women in
the United States.
Fear Of Success
Graham, who is a professor of
the history of education at
Harvard, attributes the lack of
women leaders in higher
education to women's fear of the
"disastrous effects" of success.
One of these, she said, is the
reduced possibility of marriage as
a woman advances in academia.
For example, in the last 35
years, just over half the presidents
of the "Seven Sister" colleges
have been women. Graham said
that at the time of their
appointments, all of the men but
only two of the women were
married.
Mattina Horner, president of
Radcliffe College and co-speaker
at Wednesday's CROW program,
elaborated on the psychological
factors central to women's
avoidance of success.
Not Will To Fail
She emphasized that the
"motive to avoid success," the
subject of her widely
research, is not a "will to fail." "It
is precisely those women who
most want and who are most able
to succeed," she said, "who
encounter the greatest obstacles."
