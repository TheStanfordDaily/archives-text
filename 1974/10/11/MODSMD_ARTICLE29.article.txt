# Androgyny Defined As Third Sex Role
## 
### BARBARA LANE 
"Androgyny is a brand new
word in our culture"
Psychology Prof. Sandra
Bern said yesterday in the first of
a series of lectures sponsored by
the Center for Research On
Women (CROW).
In a lecture entitled
"Masculinity, Femininity,
Androgyny: Which One Is
Better?", Bern defined androgyny
as a combination of masculine and
feminine psychologies.
Bern is currently conducting
what she described as "the first
research in psychology talking
about sex roles in away assuming
there aren't only two." She
explained that a culture which
traditionally stereotypes
masculine and feminine
characteristics causes basic
problems.
Women who reveal
"masculine" qualities such as
independence and aggressiveness,
and men who exhibit the
"feminine" traits of tenderness or
sensitivity are labeled "misfits" in
our society. When changing
situations make different demands
on people, masculine and
feminine molds inhibit
appropriate reaction.
Bern is researching whether

sex-typing is harmful, and if
androgyny is a feasible goal.
Her preconceived notions
about Stanford as "an
avant-garde, liberal, self-contained
environment," made her
apprehensive about finding
traditionally sex-typed students,
Bern confessed. However, after
reviewing initial data, she
discovered that "there are plenty
of sex-typed people here." Her
tests show 35-40 percent of
sample clearly sex-typed, 30
percent androgynous and 5-10
percent sex-reversed.
Bern administered a set of tests
to Psychology 1 students to
determine if their outlook was
masculine, feminine or
androgynous, then tested the
subjects to determine if their
sex-typing restricted their activity.
One test required men
determined masculine to donon
sexually appropriate activities
such as mixing baby formula and
ironing napkins. Bern discovered
that performing feminine
activities consistently upset the
men and made them feel peculiar.
"There is a very big sex role
phenomenon in men," Bern
concluded, attributing it to
extreme cultural condemnation of
"sissies."
