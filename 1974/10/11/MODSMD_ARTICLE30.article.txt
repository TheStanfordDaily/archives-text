## Group Plays Old And New Songs Traffic Jams At Winterland 
### MICHELE FARRAR 
SAN FRANCISCO - The
capacity crowd jamming
Winterland Thursday night heard
Traffic perform a musical program
ranging from their earliest days to
the present, and saw a few
changes in band composition.
Traffic began with a short jam
featuring Jim Capaldi on drums
and a new black bass player
named Rosko Gee. Multi-talented
Steve Winwood joined in on organ
for their opener "Shootout at the
Fantasy Factory," which lacked
acoustical guitar accompaniment,
one of the songs' usual highlights.
Traffic also no longer had it's
bongo player, Reebop Kwaku
Baah, which detracts from their
rhythm.
However, their enormous
ability remains evident. During a
new number with strong bass
background called "Waling in the
Wind" and the title song of
Traffics' new album When the
Eagle Flies Winwood proved that
his keyboard talents are still as
superbly innovative as ever.
Flutist Chris Woods' soft,
melodious delivery on solos
during "Shootout" and "John
Barleycorn" provided a pleasant
addition to Winwoods' lilting
vocals. Capaldis' gentle harmony
with Winwoods' voice and guitar
on "John Barleycorn" was a
fitting testimony to their immense
composing and arranging abilities.
Traffics' first encore, "Low
Spark of High Heeled Boys"
featured Wood wailing away on
sax, as did "Dream Gerrard," a
new piece with especiatljT
prominent sax tempo. Gee broke
into a sustained, predictable bass
solo, and Winwood executed an
acoustic guitar jam in a more
hard-rock vein.
After an extended applause the
band returned for a second encore
of the old favorite "Heaven is in
Your Mind" and the classic "Dear
Mr. Fantasy."
Traffics' absence from the
American concert circuit stemmed

from the fact that Winwood, now
an ex-junkie, was required to
remain in England for about two
years. Their long awaited return
was definitely a welcome event.
Second billing to Traffic was a
British group called Lindisfarne,
who played one and a half hours
of mediocre rock tunes.
Songs such as "Here I Am" and
"Tow the Line" featured a lead
singer with unimaginative

delivery, accompanied by shouted
background vocals creating a loud,
monotone effect.
During the song "We Can Sleep
Together" two members of the
group executed a lengthy
harmonica and organ solo
something akin to an Irish jig.
Their best achievement was a short
a capella ditty called "We'll Pass
Around Beer" which inspired
negligible crowd reaction.

Eagle Flies Winwood proved that
his keyboard talents are still as
superbly innovative as ever.
Flutist Chris Woods' soft,
melodious delivery on solos
during "Shootout" and "John
Barleycorn" provided a pleasant
addition to Winwoods' lilting
vocals. Capaldis' gentle harmony
with Winwoods' voice and guitar
on "John Barleycorn" was a
fitting testimony to their immense
composing and arranging abilities.
Traffics' first encore, "Low
Spark of High Heeled Boys"
featured Wood wailing away on
sax, as did "Dream Gerrard," a
new piece with especiatljT
prominent sax tempo. Gee broke
into a sustained, predictable bass
solo, and Winwood executed an
acoustic guitar jam in a more
hard-rock vein.
After an extended applause the
band returned for a second encore
of the old favorite "Heaven is in
Your Mind" and the classic "Dear
Mr. Fantasy."
Traffics' absence from the
American concert circuit stemmed

from the fact that Winwood, now
an ex-junkie, was required to
remain in England for about two
years. Their long awaited return
was definitely a welcome event.
Second billing to Traffic was a
British group called Lindisfarne,
who played one and a half hours
of mediocre rock tunes.
Songs such as "Here I Am" and
"Tow the Line" featured a lead
singer with unimaginative

delivery, accompanied by shouted
background vocals creating a loud,
monotone effect.
During the song "We Can Sleep
Together" two members of the
group executed a lengthy
harmonica and organ solo
something akin to an Irish jig.
Their best achievement was a short
a capella ditty called "We'll Pass
Around Beer" which inspired
negligible crowd reaction.
SAN FRANCISCO - The
capacity crowd jamming
Winterland Thursday night heard
Traffic perform a musical program
ranging from their earliest days to
the present, and saw a few
changes in band composition.
Traffic began with a short jam
featuring Jim Capaldi on drums
and a new black bass player
named Rosko Gee. Multi-talented
Steve Winwood joined in on organ
for their opener "Shootout at the
Fantasy Factory," which lacked
acoustical guitar accompaniment,
one of the songs' usual highlights.
Traffic also no longer had it's
bongo player, Reebop Kwaku
Baah, which detracts from their
rhythm.
However, their enormous
ability remains evident. During a
new number with strong bass
background called "Waling in the
Wind" and the title song of
Traffics' new album When the
Eagle Flies Winwood proved that
his keyboard talents are still as
superbly innovative as ever.
