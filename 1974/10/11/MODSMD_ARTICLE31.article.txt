# Johnny Nash Creates True Jamaican Rhythm
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
SAN FRANCISCO - A lot of
American rock groups, hearing the
Jamaican sound, have journeyed
to Kingston to get in on the act.
The results have been less than
spectacular in most instances.
Elton John's "Come on Jamaica"
warned that groups should leave
Jamaican rhythms to the
Jamaicans.
After hearing Johnny Nash at
the Boarding House last Thursday,
one had to agree with Elton. Nash
and his Jamaican sound are hard
to mimic.
Nash, who's probably most
famous for his tune "I Can See
Clearly Now," which propelled
him from playing in dingy
Jamaican halls to Las Vegas,
proved that he's no fluke.
- The backup band, Gordon
DeWitt and Nature, had the
audience swaying to the powerful
Jamaican rhythms long before the
diminutive Nash ran onto the
stage. He hardly paused long
enough to take a breath, singing
nonstop.
Nash opened with "Pressure In
The World Is Bringing Me Down,"
the flip sidd of "I Can See Clearly
Now." But the small crowd
gathered in the intimate club
hadn't come to hear Nash sing

obscure songs and their response
was less than gracious.
Sensing this rift, he broke into
an obscene version of "Hold Me
Tight." Nash reworded the song
by taking out the words "rub it
on my belly" and replacing them
with "let me put it in your belly."
The ice was beginning to thaw,
but it was far from cracking.
Nash faces a very serious
problem. Everyone who comes to
hear him is only familiar with his
hit singles and when he tries to
deviate, the reaction is one of
shock.
So resigned to his fate, he
appeased the crowd with "I Can
See Clearly Now." You could hear
the ice break from the Boarding
House to Kingston, Jamaica.
With the crowd behind him,
Nash was able to sing a few
selections from his new album on
Epic Records, Celebrate Life. But
he had to intersperse them with
his hits to maintain the
intoxicating Jamaican mood
which filled the club.
Closing with another of his
hits, "You Can't Go Halfway, Got
To Go All The Way," was an
appropriate finale for a man who
has only come halfway to
stardom.
