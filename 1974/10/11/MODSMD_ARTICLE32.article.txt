# Hove Blue Can You Get?
## Soulful Jazz Stirs Paramount Sellout 
### Dan Forte 
OAKLAND Friday night's
sell-out jazz bash at the
Paramount Theater, Oct. 4,
offered an interesting comparison
of two styles, as played by two
very accomplished bands.
Representing the "older" of
the two styles was a jam session
composed of saxophonists Sonny
Stitt and Stanley Turrentine, and
guitarist Kenny Burrell, with
Spider Webb on drums, Chuck
Raney on bass, and Sonny Burke
on electric piano.
The Freddie Hubbard quintet
followed, with a more updated
sound, which often bordered on
soul.
Jam Evokes Novel Selection
The Stitt-Turrentine-Burrell set
stuck mostly to bop standards
from the 40s and 50s, while
Hubbard played mostly original
compositions from his recent High
Energy album on Columbia.
Although the "jam session"
was just that, an informal, solo
swapping get-together, it was
interesting to see that this group
seemed to have much more
direction than Hubbard and his
regular backup band, doing their
own material.
It was the first-ever meeting of
Stitt, Turrentine, and Burrell on
stage, and their performances
lived up to their respective
reputations.
Jazz Improvisation Rampant
The three were never at a loss
for ideas, and always sounded
fresh and lively. Their solos had
the spontaneous quality that
separates the good improvisers
from the mediocre in jazz.
The same was not always the
case with trumpeter Freddie
Hubbard and his band.
This was partly due to their
over-extended treatment of each
tune, to the point where almost
any musician, no matter how
inventive, would begin repeating
ideas.
It was also due in part to the

material itself, much of which had
no chord progressions or key
changes.
Solos Spotlight Individuals
Stitt, Turrentine, and Burrell
opened the evening with "Just
Friends," featuring the entire
sextet. Then each member, in
turn, was spotlighted for one
song.
Both Stitt and Turrentine
chose standard ballads as their
vehicles, Turrentine going first
with "Willow Weep For Me."
This contrasted greatly with
Stitt's interpretation of the classic
"Stardust."
While Turrentine's style is
basically blues, emphasizing

simplicity and a full-bodied tone,
Stitt is of the Charlie Parker
school, with a light, airy tone, and
a lot of notes.
Stitt Strikes Many Notes
Shortly before his death in
1955, Charlie Parker told Stitt,
"I'm leaving you the keys to the
kingdom." To this day, Stitt
comes closer than anyone in
sounding like the Bird.
After beginning with three
fine, exciting numbers, with no
breaks in between, Freddie
Hubbard's set tapered off
gradually to a comparatively dull
finale which came much too late.
The best selection of
Hubbard's 90 minute set was

"Black Mammie," a slow, very
bluesy trumpet solo.
At his best, Hubbard could
sound,very free, reminiscent of his
one-time colleague, the late John
Coltrane. At his worst, he
sounded empty.
Disappointing Conclusion
The show closed with Art
Blakey's "Crisis" and Stevie
Wonder's "Too High," both
representing the latter, with
Hubbard experimenting on an
electric trumpet.
While Hubbard's electronics
were much more tasteful than the
wah-wah gibberish retched up by
Miles Davis lately, his already fine
tone and subtleness were
unfortunately lost somewhere in
the amplifier.
An interesting, although
irritating, element which seems to
be cropping up at jazz concerts
these days is audience
participation. The Paramount was
"no exception to the trend.
Rowdy Crowd
What this amounts to is
exhibitionism. Not a single
Stanley Turrentine riff could get
by without it being answered by a
few "Ring on's," several "get
DOWN'S," and an occasional toot
on a police whistle.
When taken to its worst
extreme, we have the Monterey
Jazz Festival, where the talkers
outnumber the listeners, and the
music simply cannot be heard
even from the front row!
It's encouraging to see an
all-jazz lineup sell out a theater
the size of the plush Paramount.
But, sad as it may be, if you come
to listen, the best place will
inevitably be the smallest club
you can find.

The Stitt-Turrentine-Burrell set
stuck mostly to bop standards
from the 40s and 50s, while
Hubbard played mostly original
compositions from his recent High
Energy album on Columbia.
Although the "jam session"
was just that, an informal, solo
swapping get-together, it was
interesting to see that this group
seemed to have much more
direction than Hubbard and his
regular backup band, doing their
own material.
It was the first-ever meeting of
Stitt, Turrentine, and Burrell on
stage, and their performances
lived up to their respective
reputations.
Jazz Improvisation Rampant
The three were never at a loss
for ideas, and always sounded
fresh and lively. Their solos had
the spontaneous quality that
separates the good improvisers
from the mediocre in jazz.
The same was not always the
case with trumpeter Freddie
Hubbard and his band.
This was partly due to their
over-extended treatment of each
tune, to the point where almost
any musician, no matter how
inventive, would begin repeating
ideas.
It was also due in part to the

material itself, much of which had
no chord progressions or key
changes.
Solos Spotlight Individuals
Stitt, Turrentine, and Burrell
opened the evening with "Just
Friends," featuring the entire
sextet. Then each member, in
turn, was spotlighted for one
song.
Both Stitt and Turrentine
chose standard ballads as their
vehicles, Turrentine going first
with "Willow Weep For Me."
This contrasted greatly with
Stitt's interpretation of the classic
"Stardust."
While Turrentine's style is
basically blues, emphasizing

simplicity and a full-bodied tone,
Stitt is of the Charlie Parker
school, with a light, airy tone, and
a lot of notes.
Stitt Strikes Many Notes
Shortly before his death in
1955, Charlie Parker told Stitt,
"I'm leaving you the keys to the
kingdom." To this day, Stitt
comes closer than anyone in
sounding like the Bird.
After beginning with three
fine, exciting numbers, with no
breaks in between, Freddie
Hubbard's set tapered off
gradually to a comparatively dull
finale which came much too late.
The best selection of
Hubbard's 90 minute set was

"Black Mammie," a slow, very
bluesy trumpet solo.
At his best, Hubbard could
sound,very free, reminiscent of his
one-time colleague, the late John
Coltrane. At his worst, he
sounded empty.
Disappointing Conclusion
The show closed with Art
Blakey's "Crisis" and Stevie
Wonder's "Too High," both
representing the latter, with
Hubbard experimenting on an
electric trumpet.
While Hubbard's electronics
were much more tasteful than the
wah-wah gibberish retched up by
Miles Davis lately, his already fine
tone and subtleness were
unfortunately lost somewhere in
the amplifier.
An interesting, although
irritating, element which seems to
be cropping up at jazz concerts
these days is audience
participation. The Paramount was
"no exception to the trend.
Rowdy Crowd
What this amounts to is
exhibitionism. Not a single
Stanley Turrentine riff could get
by without it being answered by a
few "Ring on's," several "get
DOWN'S," and an occasional toot
on a police whistle.
When taken to its worst
extreme, we have the Monterey
Jazz Festival, where the talkers
outnumber the listeners, and the
music simply cannot be heard
even from the front row!
It's encouraging to see an
all-jazz lineup sell out a theater
the size of the plush Paramount.
But, sad as it may be, if you come
to listen, the best place will
inevitably be the smallest club
you can find.

The three were never at a loss
for ideas, and always sounded
fresh and lively. Their solos had
the spontaneous quality that
separates the good improvisers
from the mediocre in jazz.
The same was not always the
case with trumpeter Freddie
Hubbard and his band.
This was partly due to their
over-extended treatment of each
tune, to the point where almost
any musician, no matter how
inventive, would begin repeating
ideas.
It was also due in part to the

material itself, much of which had
no chord progressions or key
changes.
Solos Spotlight Individuals
Stitt, Turrentine, and Burrell
opened the evening with "Just
Friends," featuring the entire
sextet. Then each member, in
turn, was spotlighted for one
song.
Both Stitt and Turrentine
chose standard ballads as their
vehicles, Turrentine going first
with "Willow Weep For Me."
This contrasted greatly with
Stitt's interpretation of the classic
"Stardust."
While Turrentine's style is
basically blues, emphasizing

simplicity and a full-bodied tone,
Stitt is of the Charlie Parker
school, with a light, airy tone, and
a lot of notes.
Stitt Strikes Many Notes
Shortly before his death in
1955, Charlie Parker told Stitt,
"I'm leaving you the keys to the
kingdom." To this day, Stitt
comes closer than anyone in
sounding like the Bird.
After beginning with three
fine, exciting numbers, with no
breaks in between, Freddie
Hubbard's set tapered off
gradually to a comparatively dull
finale which came much too late.
The best selection of
Hubbard's 90 minute set was

"Black Mammie," a slow, very
bluesy trumpet solo.
At his best, Hubbard could
sound,very free, reminiscent of his
one-time colleague, the late John
Coltrane. At his worst, he
sounded empty.
Disappointing Conclusion
The show closed with Art
Blakey's "Crisis" and Stevie
Wonder's "Too High," both
representing the latter, with
Hubbard experimenting on an
electric trumpet.
While Hubbard's electronics
were much more tasteful than the
wah-wah gibberish retched up by
Miles Davis lately, his already fine
tone and subtleness were
unfortunately lost somewhere in
the amplifier.
An interesting, although
irritating, element which seems to
be cropping up at jazz concerts
these days is audience
participation. The Paramount was
"no exception to the trend.
Rowdy Crowd
What this amounts to is
exhibitionism. Not a single
Stanley Turrentine riff could get
by without it being answered by a
few "Ring on's," several "get
DOWN'S," and an occasional toot
on a police whistle.
When taken to its worst
extreme, we have the Monterey
Jazz Festival, where the talkers
outnumber the listeners, and the
music simply cannot be heard
even from the front row!
It's encouraging to see an
all-jazz lineup sell out a theater
the size of the plush Paramount.
But, sad as it may be, if you come
to listen, the best place will
inevitably be the smallest club
you can find.
