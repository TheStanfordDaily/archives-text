John Lennon
Walls and Bridges
Apple SW 3416
No one can accuse John
Lennon of not being imaginative.
His newest album has a novel, if
rather childish cover, featuring his
own drawings at age 11, and the
accompanying publicity for
reviewers is a clever rewrite of
publicity for Ringo's highly
successful solo album, to which all
former Beatles contributed.
On Walls and Bridges, Lennon
contents himself with
contributions from the likes of
Elton John and Harry Nilsson,
and such old standbys as Nicky
Hopkins, Jim Keltner and Klaus
Voorman, which isn't bad.
But imagination in
presentation can't make for a lack
of solid, enjoyable music. Lately,
Lennon's albums have
over-indulged in self-analysis,

becoming a chronicle of what's
happening in his life at the
expense of his music.
Everyone knows that John and
Yoko have broken up, and so he
sings about the loss on side one,
including how to get through the
night, how he's scared and unsure,
etc.
Side two is more resigned, a
recognition of his position in life
without Yoko, and a melancholy
discourse to his friends. The
arrangements are lush, the lyrics
spare, and the combined effect is
alternately touching and boring.
For a Lennonophile, it's
probably the former, but for
others, it's mostly the latter.

; Average White Band makes this
idea less preposterous than it
would ordinarily seem. On their
second album these white
Scotsmen put to good use the
experience gained by several of
the members from backing up
American soul acts on tour in the
British Isles.
The six man ensemble is
capable in all departments. The
lead vocals are split between Alan
Gorrie and Hamish Stuart, as are
bass and guitar duties.
Stuart's rich, easy falsetto
neatly complements Gorrie's
stronger, lower tones. Indeed, the
band's best efforts feature the two
together, Onnie Mclntyre's
rhythm guitar stands out on "Got
the Love" and churns constantly
throughout the album, combining
with the percussion work of
Robbie Mcintosh to provide the
others with a pulsating base.
Roger Ball's excellent brass
arrangements complete the
group's sound.
Many bands can imitate well.
Most do. What lifts this one from
that heap is a slight infusion of
British folk music. "You Got It"
brings to mind early Traffic, with
Alan Gorrie a bit reminiscent of a
younger Stevie Winwood. A.W.B.
need pay no homage, however;
their work is their own.
The band is tight, and their
only fault is, perhaps, a
consequence of that fact. Their
energy feels too restrained to be
completely satisfying. The cost of
their calculated precision is their
spontaneity.
At times, you wonder if
they're enjoying half as much
pleasure playing for you as they
want you to have listening to
them. This feeling disappears
entirely on "Work to Do," an
Isley Brothers tune (the only
non-original on the record).
The band is at its best here,
being cohesive, but not rigid,
learned, but not studied. A few
more like it, and they'll be
outstanding. As it is, they are a
damn'fine white band.

Velvet Underground and on his
own), it appears the previously
fertile well has run dry.

mediocre sound of Sally Can't

Capitol ST 11337

Dance it is evident that Reed is
just rehashing old grounds. Not in
the literal sense, mind you,
because all the material is newly
written; but in a creative sense the
album is trite.
The album opens with "Ride
Sally Ride," a lecture from Lou to
Sally on the evils of being a
whore. Despite some good horns,
the song is repetitive enough to be
boring, and that's tough to do
with a four minute song.
The following song, "Animal
Language," opens with a
promising guitar riff, but settles
into a ridiculous fable about a dog
and a cat that an eight year old
could have written.
Continuing with side one (must
I?), "Baby Face" is a slow ballad
with nothing to recommend it
except the way Reed talks his way
through it. The style is
reminiscent of Reed's "Walk on
the Wild Side," but fails because
the lyrics ("no, no, no, no, Baby
Face") are incapable of retaining
interest.
The final cut on the side is
entitled "N.Y. Stars," and
improves on the rest, but not by
much.
Side two is slightly better, but
only because "Kill Your Sons" is
a successful rip off of the Bowie
style and "Sally Can't Dance" has
a good rock beat.
The album's failure is not due
to the musicians. There are
enough good guitar lines and horn
playing to help Lou through the
often weak lyrics. In fact Reed's
voice sounds as good as it ever
has, but there is nothing on the
album worth singing.
The last time Lou Reed did
come up with worthwhile new
material was two and a half years
ago on Transformer. Since then he
has made a living off utilizing
average material and excellent
musicians (as on Lou Reed , and
Berlin ), and exciting new
arrangements of tunes he wrote
back when he was with the
Velvets (on Rock N' Roll
Animal).
Actually the best music he ever
wrote was back in those wild
days. So, while others may shout
"Reunite the Beatles," and "Bring
back Simon and Garfunkel," if
you hear about a Velvet
Underground revival, let me
know.

form a unit, the virtuoso surfaces
as a multi-textured music form,
not suitable for a high school
dance, but very suitable for
sit-down listening.
Let me describe the most
noticeable characteristics of their
sound, starting at the foundation.
The beat is handled quite
liberally throughout the disk
through contrasting approaches to
a single rhythm by the vocal and
instruments or between the
instruments themselves; in other

I can honestly say that I know
nothing of Gentle Giant's past,
but presently they have a
tremendously creative and musical
record on the market.
The group consists of Derek
Shulman, vocals and saxes; Ray
Shulman, bass, violin and vocals;
Kerry Minnear, keyboards, cello
and vocals; Gary Greene, guitars;
and John Weathers, percussion
and vocals.
My early impressions were that
none of the individuals are
virtuosos; indeed, they don't
muddle in showoffy solos. But
when the components combine to

words, large scale syncopations.
(On one cut, a 4/4 beat is so
disguised at first, one hardly
recognizes it.)
Yet, the cadences have a great
deal of drive/direction and attract
rather than repel the listener. The
composition of the album is
extremely clear and after one
listening, a discerning ear
discovers the patterns (much to
this reviewer's delight).
The vocals have a tonal quality
similar to that of Traffic, and
words are utilized as a rhythmic
and tonal device more than a
vehicle for message.

All of the cuts are great, but
one is particularly exciting. Side
two, cut one: "Cogs in Cogs" is a
fantastic musical illustration of its
title. To put it in familiar terms, it
has the qualities of the jumpiest
Jethro Tull and all the intensity of
Yes. Dig that!
The record is not really a
collection of songs, but the
conglomeration of eight creatively
coordinated pieces of
cosmic-rock. The music is
sometimes gentle, sometimes

arrogant and piercing; either way,
it's extremely palatable.
So if you're in the mood for
something imaginative, Gentle
Giant just released it.

Musicians who blend jazz and.
rock styles can take one of two
approaches: they can dabble in
both forms without stating any
new ideas, or they can try to
create a new music that draws on
both and adds something original.
Blood, Sweat & Tears, one of the
first "jazz-rock" groups to come
to prominence, seems to have
opted for dabbling on their new
album.
For Mirror Image , their seventh
album, Blood, Sweat & Tears
have gone through their
customary personnel changes. The
most important additions are jazz
trumpeter Tony Klatka and
vocalist Jerry LaCroix, formerly
with Edgar Winter's group.
Despite the new faces, however,
the group seems to have settled
into a rut of dull music.

Songs like "Hold on to Me"
and "Tell Me That I'm Wrong"
sound almost exactly like
Chicago's less distinguished tunes:
conservative brass arrangements,
few solos, so-so vocals and
meaningless lyrics.
Klatka's more accomplished
arrangements salvage "Look Up to
the Sky" and "Thinking of You,"
but although the compositions are
polished they generate very little
excitement.
LaCroix, who left the group
shortly after this album was cut,
splits the singing with Jerry
Fischer, but both sound alike and
both give the impression that
anyone who could sing in tune
could replace them without
detracting from the music.
The eleven-minute "Mirror
Image" suite might pass for jazz if
it weren't so unimaginative. Only
guitarist George Wadenius shows
any improvisational spark;
trombonist Dave Bargeron, by far
the group's most accomplished
musician, does not solo at all.
Even the limited promise shown
on the group's New Blood album
is absent here; there seems to be
nowhere to go for this group in its
present format.

YOKO, WHERE ARE YOU?—John Lennon, minus Yoko, has come
out with another solo album. Walls and Bridges contains a large
amount of introspective music written by Lennon. The album cover
and enclosed pamphlet contain drawings by Lennon done when he
was eleven years old.


BETTER THAN AVERAGE-Viewed as a "white soul band," the Scottish
has just put out an album of unique music. The group admits an indebtedness to New Orleans Jazz, but
claims a style that's all its own.
John Lennon
Walls and Bridges
Apple SW 3416
No one can accuse John
Lennon of not being imaginative.
His newest album has a novel, if
rather childish cover, featuring his
own drawings at age 11, and the
accompanying publicity for
reviewers is a clever rewrite of
publicity for Ringo's highly
successful solo album, to which all
former Beatles contributed.
On Walls and Bridges, Lennon
contents himself with
contributions from the likes of
Elton John and Harry Nilsson,
and such old standbys as Nicky
Hopkins, Jim Keltner and Klaus
Voorman, which isn't bad.
But imagination in
presentation can't make for a lack
of solid, enjoyable music. Lately,
Lennon's albums have
over-indulged in self-analysis,

becoming a chronicle of what's
happening in his life at the
expense of his music.
Everyone knows that John and
Yoko have broken up, and so he
sings about the loss on side one,
including how to get through the
night, how he's scared and unsure,
etc.
Side two is more resigned, a
recognition of his position in life
without Yoko, and a melancholy
discourse to his friends. The
arrangements are lush, the lyrics
spare, and the combined effect is
alternately touching and boring.
For a Lennonophile, it's
probably the former, but for
others, it's mostly the latter.

; Average White Band makes this
idea less preposterous than it
would ordinarily seem. On their
second album these white
Scotsmen put to good use the
experience gained by several of
the members from backing up
American soul acts on tour in the
British Isles.
The six man ensemble is
capable in all departments. The
lead vocals are split between Alan
Gorrie and Hamish Stuart, as are
bass and guitar duties.
Stuart's rich, easy falsetto
neatly complements Gorrie's
stronger, lower tones. Indeed, the
band's best efforts feature the two
together, Onnie Mclntyre's
rhythm guitar stands out on "Got
the Love" and churns constantly
throughout the album, combining
with the percussion work of
Robbie Mcintosh to provide the
others with a pulsating base.
Roger Ball's excellent brass
arrangements complete the
group's sound.
Many bands can imitate well.
Most do. What lifts this one from
that heap is a slight infusion of
British folk music. "You Got It"
brings to mind early Traffic, with
Alan Gorrie a bit reminiscent of a
younger Stevie Winwood. A.W.B.
need pay no homage, however;
their work is their own.
The band is tight, and their
only fault is, perhaps, a
consequence of that fact. Their
energy feels too restrained to be
completely satisfying. The cost of
their calculated precision is their
spontaneity.
At times, you wonder if
they're enjoying half as much
pleasure playing for you as they
want you to have listening to
them. This feeling disappears
entirely on "Work to Do," an
Isley Brothers tune (the only
non-original on the record).
The band is at its best here,
being cohesive, but not rigid,
learned, but not studied. A few
more like it, and they'll be
outstanding. As it is, they are a
damn'fine white band.

Capitol ST 11337

Dance it is evident that Reed is
just rehashing old grounds. Not in
the literal sense, mind you,
because all the material is newly
written; but in a creative sense the
album is trite.
The album opens with "Ride
Sally Ride," a lecture from Lou to
Sally on the evils of being a
whore. Despite some good horns,
the song is repetitive enough to be
boring, and that's tough to do
with a four minute song.
The following song, "Animal
Language," opens with a
promising guitar riff, but settles
into a ridiculous fable about a dog
and a cat that an eight year old
could have written.
Continuing with side one (must
I?), "Baby Face" is a slow ballad
with nothing to recommend it
except the way Reed talks his way
through it. The style is
reminiscent of Reed's "Walk on
the Wild Side," but fails because
the lyrics ("no, no, no, no, Baby
Face") are incapable of retaining
interest.
The final cut on the side is
entitled "N.Y. Stars," and
improves on the rest, but not by
much.
Side two is slightly better, but
only because "Kill Your Sons" is
a successful rip off of the Bowie
style and "Sally Can't Dance" has
a good rock beat.
The album's failure is not due
to the musicians. There are
enough good guitar lines and horn
playing to help Lou through the
often weak lyrics. In fact Reed's
voice sounds as good as it ever
has, but there is nothing on the
album worth singing.
The last time Lou Reed did
come up with worthwhile new
material was two and a half years
ago on Transformer. Since then he
has made a living off utilizing
average material and excellent
musicians (as on Lou Reed , and
Berlin ), and exciting new
arrangements of tunes he wrote
back when he was with the
Velvets (on Rock N' Roll
Animal).
Actually the best music he ever
wrote was back in those wild
days. So, while others may shout
"Reunite the Beatles," and "Bring
back Simon and Garfunkel," if
you hear about a Velvet
Underground revival, let me
know.

form a unit, the virtuoso surfaces
as a multi-textured music form,
not suitable for a high school
dance, but very suitable for
sit-down listening.
Let me describe the most
noticeable characteristics of their
sound, starting at the foundation.
The beat is handled quite
liberally throughout the disk
through contrasting approaches to
a single rhythm by the vocal and
instruments or between the
instruments themselves; in other

I can honestly say that I know
nothing of Gentle Giant's past,
but presently they have a
tremendously creative and musical
record on the market.
The group consists of Derek
Shulman, vocals and saxes; Ray
Shulman, bass, violin and vocals;
Kerry Minnear, keyboards, cello
and vocals; Gary Greene, guitars;
and John Weathers, percussion
and vocals.
My early impressions were that
none of the individuals are
virtuosos; indeed, they don't
muddle in showoffy solos. But
when the components combine to

words, large scale syncopations.
(On one cut, a 4/4 beat is so
disguised at first, one hardly
recognizes it.)
Yet, the cadences have a great
deal of drive/direction and attract
rather than repel the listener. The
composition of the album is
extremely clear and after one
listening, a discerning ear
discovers the patterns (much to
this reviewer's delight).
The vocals have a tonal quality
similar to that of Traffic, and
words are utilized as a rhythmic
and tonal device more than a
vehicle for message.

All of the cuts are great, but
one is particularly exciting. Side
two, cut one: "Cogs in Cogs" is a
fantastic musical illustration of its
title. To put it in familiar terms, it
has the qualities of the jumpiest
Jethro Tull and all the intensity of
Yes. Dig that!
The record is not really a
collection of songs, but the
conglomeration of eight creatively
coordinated pieces of
cosmic-rock. The music is
sometimes gentle, sometimes

arrogant and piercing; either way,
it's extremely palatable.
So if you're in the mood for
something imaginative, Gentle
Giant just released it.

Columbia KC 32925
Musicians who blend jazz and.
rock styles can take one of two
approaches: they can dabble in
both forms without stating any
new ideas, or they can try to
create a new music that draws on
both and adds something original.
Blood, Sweat & Tears, one of the
first "jazz-rock" groups to come
to prominence, seems to have
opted for dabbling on their new
album.
For Mirror Image , their seventh
album, Blood, Sweat & Tears
have gone through their
customary personnel changes. The
most important additions are jazz
trumpeter Tony Klatka and
vocalist Jerry LaCroix, formerly
with Edgar Winter's group.
Despite the new faces, however,
the group seems to have settled
into a rut of dull music.

Songs like "Hold on to Me"
and "Tell Me That I'm Wrong"
sound almost exactly like
Chicago's less distinguished tunes:
conservative brass arrangements,
few solos, so-so vocals and
meaningless lyrics.
Klatka's more accomplished
arrangements salvage "Look Up to
the Sky" and "Thinking of You,"
but although the compositions are
polished they generate very little
excitement.
LaCroix, who left the group
shortly after this album was cut,
splits the singing with Jerry
Fischer, but both sound alike and
both give the impression that
anyone who could sing in tune
could replace them without
detracting from the music.
The eleven-minute "Mirror
Image" suite might pass for jazz if
it weren't so unimaginative. Only
guitarist George Wadenius shows
any improvisational spark;
trombonist Dave Bargeron, by far
the group's most accomplished
musician, does not solo at all.
Even the limited promise shown
on the group's New Blood album
is absent here; there seems to be
nowhere to go for this group in its

customary personnel changes. The
most important additions are jazz
trumpeter Tony Klatka and
vocalist Jerry LaCroix, formerly
with Edgar Winter's group.
Despite the new faces, however,
the group seems to have settled
into a rut of dull music.

Songs like "Hold on to Me"
and "Tell Me That I'm Wrong"
sound almost exactly like
Chicago's less distinguished tunes:
conservative brass arrangements,
few solos, so-so vocals and
meaningless lyrics.
Klatka's more accomplished
arrangements salvage "Look Up to
the Sky" and "Thinking of You,"
but although the compositions are
polished they generate very little
excitement.
LaCroix, who left the group
shortly after this album was cut,
splits the singing with Jerry
Fischer, but both sound alike and
both give the impression that
anyone who could sing in tune
could replace them without
detracting from the music.
The eleven-minute "Mirror
Image" suite might pass for jazz if
it weren't so unimaginative. Only
guitarist George Wadenius shows
any improvisational spark;
trombonist Dave Bargeron, by far
the group's most accomplished
musician, does not solo at all.
Even the limited promise shown
on the group's New Blood album
is absent here; there seems to be
nowhere to go for this group in its
present format.

YOKO, WHERE ARE YOU?—John Lennon, minus Yoko, has come
out with another solo album. Walls and Bridges contains a large
amount of introspective music written by Lennon. The album cover
and enclosed pamphlet contain drawings by Lennon done when he
was eleven years old.


BETTER THAN AVERAGE-Viewed as a "white soul band," the Scottish
has just put out an album of unique music. The group admits an indebtedness to New Orleans Jazz, but
claims a style that's all its own.
John Lennon
Walls and Bridges
Apple SW 3416
No one can accuse John
Lennon of not being imaginative.
His newest album has a novel, if
rather childish cover, featuring his
own drawings at age 11, and the
accompanying publicity for
reviewers is a clever rewrite of
publicity for Ringo's highly
successful solo album, to which all
former Beatles contributed.
On Walls and Bridges, Lennon
contents himself with
contributions from the likes of
Elton John and Harry Nilsson,
and such old standbys as Nicky
Hopkins, Jim Keltner and Klaus
Voorman, which isn't bad.
But imagination in
presentation can't make for a lack
of solid, enjoyable music. Lately,
Lennon's albums have
over-indulged in self-analysis,

becoming a chronicle of what's
happening in his life at the
expense of his music.
Everyone knows that John and
Yoko have broken up, and so he
sings about the loss on side one,
including how to get through the
night, how he's scared and unsure,
etc.
Side two is more resigned, a
recognition of his position in life
without Yoko, and a melancholy
discourse to his friends. The
arrangements are lush, the lyrics
spare, and the combined effect is
alternately touching and boring.
For a Lennonophile, it's
probably the former, but for
others, it's mostly the latter.

; Average White Band makes this
idea less preposterous than it
would ordinarily seem. On their
second album these white
Scotsmen put to good use the
experience gained by several of
the members from backing up
American soul acts on tour in the
British Isles.
The six man ensemble is
capable in all departments. The
lead vocals are split between Alan
Gorrie and Hamish Stuart, as are
bass and guitar duties.
Stuart's rich, easy falsetto
neatly complements Gorrie's
stronger, lower tones. Indeed, the
band's best efforts feature the two
together, Onnie Mclntyre's
rhythm guitar stands out on "Got
the Love" and churns constantly
throughout the album, combining
with the percussion work of
Robbie Mcintosh to provide the
others with a pulsating base.
Roger Ball's excellent brass
arrangements complete the
group's sound.
Many bands can imitate well.
Most do. What lifts this one from
that heap is a slight infusion of
British folk music. "You Got It"
brings to mind early Traffic, with
Alan Gorrie a bit reminiscent of a
younger Stevie Winwood. A.W.B.
need pay no homage, however;
their work is their own.
The band is tight, and their
only fault is, perhaps, a
consequence of that fact. Their
energy feels too restrained to be
completely satisfying. The cost of
their calculated precision is their
spontaneity.
At times, you wonder if
they're enjoying half as much
pleasure playing for you as they
want you to have listening to
them. This feeling disappears
entirely on "Work to Do," an
Isley Brothers tune (the only
non-original on the record).
The band is at its best here,
being cohesive, but not rigid,
learned, but not studied. A few
more like it, and they'll be
outstanding. As it is, they are a
damn'fine white band.

The Power and the Glory'
Capitol ST 11337

Dance it is evident that Reed is
just rehashing old grounds. Not in
the literal sense, mind you,
because all the material is newly
written; but in a creative sense the
album is trite.
The album opens with "Ride
Sally Ride," a lecture from Lou to
Sally on the evils of being a
whore. Despite some good horns,
the song is repetitive enough to be
boring, and that's tough to do
with a four minute song.
The following song, "Animal
Language," opens with a
promising guitar riff, but settles
into a ridiculous fable about a dog
and a cat that an eight year old
could have written.
Continuing with side one (must
I?), "Baby Face" is a slow ballad
with nothing to recommend it
except the way Reed talks his way
through it. The style is
reminiscent of Reed's "Walk on
the Wild Side," but fails because
the lyrics ("no, no, no, no, Baby
Face") are incapable of retaining
interest.
The final cut on the side is
entitled "N.Y. Stars," and
improves on the rest, but not by
much.
Side two is slightly better, but
only because "Kill Your Sons" is
a successful rip off of the Bowie
style and "Sally Can't Dance" has
a good rock beat.
The album's failure is not due
to the musicians. There are
enough good guitar lines and horn
playing to help Lou through the
often weak lyrics. In fact Reed's
voice sounds as good as it ever
has, but there is nothing on the
album worth singing.
The last time Lou Reed did
come up with worthwhile new
material was two and a half years
ago on Transformer. Since then he
has made a living off utilizing
average material and excellent
musicians (as on Lou Reed , and
Berlin ), and exciting new
arrangements of tunes he wrote
back when he was with the
Velvets (on Rock N' Roll
Animal).
Actually the best music he ever
wrote was back in those wild
days. So, while others may shout
"Reunite the Beatles," and "Bring
back Simon and Garfunkel," if
you hear about a Velvet
Underground revival, let me
know.

form a unit, the virtuoso surfaces
as a multi-textured music form,
not suitable for a high school
dance, but very suitable for
sit-down listening.
Let me describe the most
noticeable characteristics of their
sound, starting at the foundation.
The beat is handled quite
liberally throughout the disk
through contrasting approaches to
a single rhythm by the vocal and
instruments or between the
instruments themselves; in other

I can honestly say that I know
nothing of Gentle Giant's past,
but presently they have a
tremendously creative and musical
record on the market.
The group consists of Derek
Shulman, vocals and saxes; Ray
Shulman, bass, violin and vocals;
Kerry Minnear, keyboards, cello
and vocals; Gary Greene, guitars;
and John Weathers, percussion
and vocals.
My early impressions were that
none of the individuals are
virtuosos; indeed, they don't
muddle in showoffy solos. But
when the components combine to

words, large scale syncopations.
(On one cut, a 4/4 beat is so
disguised at first, one hardly
recognizes it.)
Yet, the cadences have a great
deal of drive/direction and attract
rather than repel the listener. The
composition of the album is
extremely clear and after one
listening, a discerning ear
discovers the patterns (much to
this reviewer's delight).
The vocals have a tonal quality
similar to that of Traffic, and
words are utilized as a rhythmic
and tonal device more than a
vehicle for message.

All of the cuts are great, but
one is particularly exciting. Side
two, cut one: "Cogs in Cogs" is a
fantastic musical illustration of its
title. To put it in familiar terms, it
has the qualities of the jumpiest
Jethro Tull and all the intensity of
Yes. Dig that!
The record is not really a
collection of songs, but the
conglomeration of eight creatively
coordinated pieces of
cosmic-rock. The music is
sometimes gentle, sometimes

arrogant and piercing; either way,
it's extremely palatable.
So if you're in the mood for
something imaginative, Gentle
Giant just released it.

Musicians who blend jazz and.
rock styles can take one of two
approaches: they can dabble in
both forms without stating any
new ideas, or they can try to
create a new music that draws on
both and adds something original.
Blood, Sweat & Tears, one of the
first "jazz-rock" groups to come
to prominence, seems to have
opted for dabbling on their new
album.

The record is not really a

conglomeration of eight creatively
coordinated pieces of
cosmic-rock. The music is
sometimes gentle, sometimes

arrogant and piercing; either way,

So if you're in the mood for

Musicians who blend jazz and.
rock styles can take one of two
approaches: they can dabble in
both forms without stating any
new ideas, or they can try to
create a new music that draws on
both and adds something original.
Blood, Sweat & Tears, one of the
first "jazz-rock" groups to come
to prominence, seems to have
opted for dabbling on their new
album.
For Mirror Image , their seventh
album, Blood, Sweat & Tears
have gone through their
customary personnel changes. The
most important additions are jazz
trumpeter Tony Klatka and
vocalist Jerry LaCroix, formerly
with Edgar Winter's group.
Despite the new faces, however,
the group seems to have settled
into a rut of dull music.

Songs like "Hold on to Me"
and "Tell Me That I'm Wrong"
sound almost exactly like
Chicago's less distinguished tunes:
conservative brass arrangements,
few solos, so-so vocals and
meaningless lyrics.
Klatka's more accomplished
arrangements salvage "Look Up to
the Sky" and "Thinking of You,"
but although the compositions are
polished they generate very little
excitement.
LaCroix, who left the group
shortly after this album was cut,
splits the singing with Jerry
Fischer, but both sound alike and
both give the impression that
anyone who could sing in tune
could replace them without
detracting from the music.
The eleven-minute "Mirror
Image" suite might pass for jazz if
it weren't so unimaginative. Only
guitarist George Wadenius shows
any improvisational spark;
trombonist Dave Bargeron, by far
the group's most accomplished
musician, does not solo at all.
Even the limited promise shown
on the group's New Blood album
is absent here; there seems to be
nowhere to go for this group in its
present format.

YOKO, WHERE ARE YOU?—John Lennon, minus Yoko, has come
out with another solo album. Walls and Bridges contains a large
amount of introspective music written by Lennon. The album cover
and enclosed pamphlet contain drawings by Lennon done when he
was eleven years old.


BETTER THAN AVERAGE-Viewed as a "white soul band," the Scottish
has just put out an album of unique music. The group admits an indebtedness to New Orleans Jazz, but
claims a style that's all its own.
John Lennon
Walls and Bridges
Apple SW 3416
No one can accuse John
Lennon of not being imaginative.
His newest album has a novel, if
rather childish cover, featuring his
own drawings at age 11, and the
accompanying publicity for
reviewers is a clever rewrite of
publicity for Ringo's highly
successful solo album, to which all
former Beatles contributed.
On Walls and Bridges, Lennon
contents himself with
contributions from the likes of
Elton John and Harry Nilsson,
and such old standbys as Nicky
Hopkins, Jim Keltner and Klaus
Voorman, which isn't bad.
But imagination in
presentation can't make for a lack
of solid, enjoyable music. Lately,
Lennon's albums have
over-indulged in self-analysis,

becoming a chronicle of what's
happening in his life at the
expense of his music.
Everyone knows that John and
Yoko have broken up, and so he
sings about the loss on side one,
including how to get through the
night, how he's scared and unsure,
etc.
Side two is more resigned, a
recognition of his position in life
without Yoko, and a melancholy
discourse to his friends. The
arrangements are lush, the lyrics
spare, and the combined effect is
alternately touching and boring.
For a Lennonophile, it's
probably the former, but for
others, it's mostly the latter.

; Average White Band makes this
idea less preposterous than it
would ordinarily seem. On their
second album these white
Scotsmen put to good use the
experience gained by several of
the members from backing up
American soul acts on tour in the
British Isles.
The six man ensemble is
capable in all departments. The
lead vocals are split between Alan
Gorrie and Hamish Stuart, as are
bass and guitar duties.
Stuart's rich, easy falsetto
neatly complements Gorrie's
stronger, lower tones. Indeed, the
band's best efforts feature the two
together, Onnie Mclntyre's
rhythm guitar stands out on "Got
the Love" and churns constantly
throughout the album, combining
with the percussion work of
Robbie Mcintosh to provide the
others with a pulsating base.
Roger Ball's excellent brass
arrangements complete the
group's sound.
Many bands can imitate well.
Most do. What lifts this one from
that heap is a slight infusion of
British folk music. "You Got It"
brings to mind early Traffic, with
Alan Gorrie a bit reminiscent of a
younger Stevie Winwood. A.W.B.
need pay no homage, however;
their work is their own.
The band is tight, and their
only fault is, perhaps, a
consequence of that fact. Their
energy feels too restrained to be
completely satisfying. The cost of
their calculated precision is their
spontaneity.
At times, you wonder if
they're enjoying half as much
pleasure playing for you as they
want you to have listening to
them. This feeling disappears
entirely on "Work to Do," an
Isley Brothers tune (the only
non-original on the record).
The band is at its best here,
being cohesive, but not rigid,
learned, but not studied. A few
more like it, and they'll be
outstanding. As it is, they are a
damn'fine white band.

Capitol ST 11337

Dance it is evident that Reed is
just rehashing old grounds. Not in
the literal sense, mind you,
because all the material is newly
written; but in a creative sense the
album is trite.
The album opens with "Ride
Sally Ride," a lecture from Lou to
Sally on the evils of being a
whore. Despite some good horns,
the song is repetitive enough to be
boring, and that's tough to do
with a four minute song.
The following song, "Animal
Language," opens with a
promising guitar riff, but settles
into a ridiculous fable about a dog
and a cat that an eight year old
could have written.
Continuing with side one (must
I?), "Baby Face" is a slow ballad
with nothing to recommend it
except the way Reed talks his way
through it. The style is
reminiscent of Reed's "Walk on
the Wild Side," but fails because
the lyrics ("no, no, no, no, Baby
Face") are incapable of retaining
interest.
The final cut on the side is
entitled "N.Y. Stars," and
improves on the rest, but not by
much.
Side two is slightly better, but
only because "Kill Your Sons" is
a successful rip off of the Bowie
style and "Sally Can't Dance" has
a good rock beat.
The album's failure is not due
to the musicians. There are
enough good guitar lines and horn
playing to help Lou through the
often weak lyrics. In fact Reed's
voice sounds as good as it ever
has, but there is nothing on the
album worth singing.
The last time Lou Reed did
come up with worthwhile new
material was two and a half years
ago on Transformer. Since then he
has made a living off utilizing
average material and excellent
musicians (as on Lou Reed , and
Berlin ), and exciting new
arrangements of tunes he wrote
back when he was with the
Velvets (on Rock N' Roll
Animal).
Actually the best music he ever
wrote was back in those wild
days. So, while others may shout
"Reunite the Beatles," and "Bring
back Simon and Garfunkel," if
you hear about a Velvet
Underground revival, let me
know.

as a multi-textured music form,
not suitable for a high school
dance, but very suitable for
sit-down listening.

noticeable characteristics of their
sound, starting at the foundation.

liberally throughout the disk
through contrasting approaches to
a single rhythm by the vocal and
instruments or between the
instruments themselves; in other

I can honestly say that I know
nothing of Gentle Giant's past,

tremendously creative and musical
record on the market.
The group consists of Derek
Shulman, vocals and saxes; Ray
Shulman, bass, violin and vocals;
Kerry Minnear, keyboards, cello
and vocals; Gary Greene, guitars;
and John Weathers, percussion
and vocals.
My early impressions were that
none of the individuals are
virtuosos; indeed, they don't
muddle in showoffy solos. But
when the components combine to

words, large scale syncopations.
(On one cut, a 4/4 beat is so
disguised at first, one hardly
recognizes it.)
Yet, the cadences have a great
deal of drive/direction and attract
rather than repel the listener. The
composition of the album is
extremely clear and after one
listening, a discerning ear
discovers the patterns (much to
this reviewer's delight).
The vocals have a tonal quality
similar to that of Traffic, and
words are utilized as a rhythmic
and tonal device more than a
vehicle for message.

All of the cuts are great, but
one is particularly exciting. Side
two, cut one: "Cogs in Cogs" is a
fantastic musical illustration of its

fantastic musical illustration of its
title. To put it in familiar terms, it
has the qualities of the jumpiest

Yes. Dig that!
The record is not really a
collection of songs, but the
conglomeration of eight creatively
coordinated pieces of
cosmic-rock. The music is
sometimes gentle, sometimes

arrogant and piercing; either way,
it's extremely palatable.
So if you're in the mood for

Musicians who blend jazz and.
rock styles can take one of two
approaches: they can dabble in
both forms without stating any
new ideas, or they can try to
create a new music that draws on
both and adds something original.
Blood, Sweat & Tears, one of the
first "jazz-rock" groups to come
to prominence, seems to have
opted for dabbling on their new
album.
For Mirror Image , their seventh
album, Blood, Sweat & Tears
have gone through their
customary personnel changes. The
most important additions are jazz
trumpeter Tony Klatka and
vocalist Jerry LaCroix, formerly
with Edgar Winter's group.
Despite the new faces, however,
the group seems to have settled
into a rut of dull music.

Songs like "Hold on to Me"
and "Tell Me That I'm Wrong"
sound almost exactly like
Chicago's less distinguished tunes:
conservative brass arrangements,
few solos, so-so vocals and
meaningless lyrics.
Klatka's more accomplished
arrangements salvage "Look Up to
the Sky" and "Thinking of You,"
but although the compositions are
polished they generate very little
excitement.
LaCroix, who left the group
shortly after this album was cut,
splits the singing with Jerry
Fischer, but both sound alike and
both give the impression that
anyone who could sing in tune
could replace them without
detracting from the music.
The eleven-minute "Mirror
Image" suite might pass for jazz if
it weren't so unimaginative. Only
guitarist George Wadenius shows
any improvisational spark;
trombonist Dave Bargeron, by far
the group's most accomplished
musician, does not solo at all.
Even the limited promise shown
on the group's New Blood album
is absent here; there seems to be
nowhere to go for this group in its
present format.

YOKO, WHERE ARE YOU?—John Lennon, minus Yoko, has come
out with another solo album. Walls and Bridges contains a large
amount of introspective music written by Lennon. The album cover
and enclosed pamphlet contain drawings by Lennon done when he
was eleven years old.


BETTER THAN AVERAGE-Viewed as a "white soul band," the Scottish
has just put out an album of unique music. The group admits an indebtedness to New Orleans Jazz, but
claims a style that's all its own.
John Lennon
Walls and Bridges
Apple SW 3416
No one can accuse John
Lennon of not being imaginative.
His newest album has a novel, if
rather childish cover, featuring his
own drawings at age 11, and the
accompanying publicity for
reviewers is a clever rewrite of
publicity for Ringo's highly
successful solo album, to which all
former Beatles contributed.
On Walls and Bridges, Lennon
contents himself with
contributions from the likes of
Elton John and Harry Nilsson,
and such old standbys as Nicky
Hopkins, Jim Keltner and Klaus
Voorman, which isn't bad.
But imagination in
presentation can't make for a lack
of solid, enjoyable music. Lately,
Lennon's albums have
over-indulged in self-analysis,

becoming a chronicle of what's
happening in his life at the
expense of his music.
Everyone knows that John and
Yoko have broken up, and so he
sings about the loss on side one,
including how to get through the
night, how he's scared and unsure,
etc.
Side two is more resigned, a
recognition of his position in life
without Yoko, and a melancholy
discourse to his friends. The
arrangements are lush, the lyrics
spare, and the combined effect is
alternately touching and boring.
For a Lennonophile, it's
probably the former, but for
others, it's mostly the latter.

; Average White Band makes this
idea less preposterous than it
would ordinarily seem. On their
second album these white
Scotsmen put to good use the
experience gained by several of
the members from backing up
American soul acts on tour in the
British Isles.
The six man ensemble is
capable in all departments. The
lead vocals are split between Alan
Gorrie and Hamish Stuart, as are
bass and guitar duties.
Stuart's rich, easy falsetto
neatly complements Gorrie's
stronger, lower tones. Indeed, the
band's best efforts feature the two
together, Onnie Mclntyre's
rhythm guitar stands out on "Got
the Love" and churns constantly
throughout the album, combining
with the percussion work of
Robbie Mcintosh to provide the
others with a pulsating base.
Roger Ball's excellent brass
arrangements complete the
group's sound.
Many bands can imitate well.
Most do. What lifts this one from
that heap is a slight infusion of
British folk music. "You Got It"
brings to mind early Traffic, with
Alan Gorrie a bit reminiscent of a
younger Stevie Winwood. A.W.B.
need pay no homage, however;
their work is their own.
The band is tight, and their
only fault is, perhaps, a
consequence of that fact. Their
energy feels too restrained to be
completely satisfying. The cost of
their calculated precision is their
spontaneity.
At times, you wonder if
they're enjoying half as much
pleasure playing for you as they
want you to have listening to
them. This feeling disappears
entirely on "Work to Do," an
Isley Brothers tune (the only
non-original on the record).
The band is at its best here,
being cohesive, but not rigid,
learned, but not studied. A few
more like it, and they'll be
outstanding. As it is, they are a
damn'fine white band.

Capitol ST 11337

Dance it is evident that Reed is
just rehashing old grounds. Not in
the literal sense, mind you,
because all the material is newly
written; but in a creative sense the
album is trite.
The album opens with "Ride
Sally Ride," a lecture from Lou to
Sally on the evils of being a
whore. Despite some good horns,
the song is repetitive enough to be
boring, and that's tough to do
with a four minute song.
The following song, "Animal
Language," opens with a
promising guitar riff, but settles
into a ridiculous fable about a dog
and a cat that an eight year old
could have written.
Continuing with side one (must
I?), "Baby Face" is a slow ballad
with nothing to recommend it
except the way Reed talks his way
through it. The style is
reminiscent of Reed's "Walk on
the Wild Side," but fails because
the lyrics ("no, no, no, no, Baby
Face") are incapable of retaining
interest.
The final cut on the side is
entitled "N.Y. Stars," and
improves on the rest, but not by
much.
Side two is slightly better, but
only because "Kill Your Sons" is
a successful rip off of the Bowie
style and "Sally Can't Dance" has
a good rock beat.
The album's failure is not due
to the musicians. There are
enough good guitar lines and horn
playing to help Lou through the
often weak lyrics. In fact Reed's
voice sounds as good as it ever
has, but there is nothing on the
album worth singing.
The last time Lou Reed did
come up with worthwhile new
material was two and a half years
ago on Transformer. Since then he
has made a living off utilizing
average material and excellent
musicians (as on Lou Reed , and
Berlin ), and exciting new
arrangements of tunes he wrote
back when he was with the
Velvets (on Rock N' Roll
Animal).
Actually the best music he ever
wrote was back in those wild
days. So, while others may shout
"Reunite the Beatles," and "Bring
back Simon and Garfunkel," if
you hear about a Velvet
Underground revival, let me
know.

Velvets (on Rock N' Roll
Animal).
Actually the best music he ever
wrote was back in those wild
days. So, while others may shout
"Reunite the Beatles," and "Bring
back Simon and Garfunkel," if
you hear about a Velvet
Underground revival, let me
know.

form a unit, the virtuoso surfaces
as a multi-textured music form,
not suitable for a high school
dance, but very suitable for
sit-down listening.
Let me describe the most
noticeable characteristics of their
sound, starting at the foundation.
The beat is handled quite
liberally throughout the disk
through contrasting approaches to
a single rhythm by the vocal and
instruments or between the
instruments themselves; in other

I can honestly say that I know
nothing of Gentle Giant's past,
but presently they have a
tremendously creative and musical
record on the market.
The group consists of Derek
Shulman, vocals and saxes; Ray
Shulman, bass, violin and vocals;
Kerry Minnear, keyboards, cello
and vocals; Gary Greene, guitars;
and John Weathers, percussion
and vocals.
My early impressions were that
none of the individuals are
virtuosos; indeed, they don't
muddle in showoffy solos. But
when the components combine to

words, large scale syncopations.
(On one cut, a 4/4 beat is so
disguised at first, one hardly
recognizes it.)
Yet, the cadences have a great
deal of drive/direction and attract
rather than repel the listener. The
composition of the album is
extremely clear and after one
listening, a discerning ear
discovers the patterns (much to
this reviewer's delight).
The vocals have a tonal quality
similar to that of Traffic, and
words are utilized as a rhythmic
and tonal device more than a
vehicle for message.

All of the cuts are great, but
one is particularly exciting. Side
two, cut one: "Cogs in Cogs" is a
fantastic musical illustration of its
title. To put it in familiar terms, it
has the qualities of the jumpiest
Jethro Tull and all the intensity of
Yes. Dig that!
The record is not really a
collection of songs, but the
conglomeration of eight creatively
coordinated pieces of
cosmic-rock. The music is
sometimes gentle, sometimes

arrogant and piercing; either way,
it's extremely palatable.
So if you're in the mood for
something imaginative, Gentle
Giant just released it.

Musicians who blend jazz and.
rock styles can take one of two
approaches: they can dabble in
both forms without stating any
new ideas, or they can try to
create a new music that draws on
both and adds something original.
Blood, Sweat & Tears, one of the
first "jazz-rock" groups to come
to prominence, seems to have
opted for dabbling on their new
album.
For Mirror Image , their seventh
album, Blood, Sweat & Tears
have gone through their
customary personnel changes. The
most important additions are jazz
trumpeter Tony Klatka and
vocalist Jerry LaCroix, formerly
with Edgar Winter's group.
Despite the new faces, however,
the group seems to have settled
into a rut of dull music.

Songs like "Hold on to Me"
and "Tell Me That I'm Wrong"
sound almost exactly like
Chicago's less distinguished tunes:
conservative brass arrangements,
few solos, so-so vocals and
meaningless lyrics.
Klatka's more accomplished
arrangements salvage "Look Up to
the Sky" and "Thinking of You,"
but although the compositions are
polished they generate very little
excitement.
LaCroix, who left the group
shortly after this album was cut,
splits the singing with Jerry
Fischer, but both sound alike and
both give the impression that
anyone who could sing in tune
could replace them without
detracting from the music.
The eleven-minute "Mirror
Image" suite might pass for jazz if
it weren't so unimaginative. Only
guitarist George Wadenius shows
any improvisational spark;
trombonist Dave Bargeron, by far
the group's most accomplished
musician, does not solo at all.
Even the limited promise shown
on the group's New Blood album
is absent here; there seems to be
nowhere to go for this group in its
present format.

YOKO, WHERE ARE YOU?—John Lennon, minus Yoko, has come
out with another solo album. Walls and Bridges contains a large
amount of introspective music written by Lennon. The album cover
and enclosed pamphlet contain drawings by Lennon done when he
was eleven years old.


BETTER THAN AVERAGE-Viewed as a "white soul band," the Scottish
has just put out an album of unique music. The group admits an indebtedness to New Orleans Jazz, but
claims a style that's all its own.
