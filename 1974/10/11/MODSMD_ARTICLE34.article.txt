## Mem Aud Crowd Trips On Dead Film 
### George Powell 
Imagine working for over two years on a
movie without realizing any monetary gain.
Such is the dedication of a group of
filmmakers and Grateful Dead freaks, who
prefer to be known as Canis Major, who have
put together Sunshine Daydream , a film
about the Dead and their music.
Since the Dead have always been
associated with the beginnings of
psychedelia, the Ken Kesey-led acid tests and
other early phenomena that became the
"counter-culture" to the rest of America,
filming the Dead in action in Oregon at a
benefit for Kesey's Eugene dairy was only
fitting and proper.
What isn't fitting and proper are the
delays and the inaction on the part of the
Dead that has kept the film from commercial
release. According to Joaquin Villegas,
spokesman fo{ Canis Major, the Dead have
refused to sign a release authorizing
commercial distribution of the movie.
Accurate Portrayal
The Dead have seen the movie, however,
Villegas said, and "they haven't been the
same since." He thinks they were freaked out
by the accuracy of the cinematic portrayal,
and are consequently unsure of what action
to take toward the film.
What of the movie, which was given its
first public screening at Memorial
Auditorium last Saturday night, attracting
more customers than Stanford night at
Marine World? It succeeds in capturing the
easy ambience of the kind of crowd that
would show up for a free Dead concert on a
hot August day, but Sunshine Daydream

doesn't really show the musical versatility of
the Dead that well.
Head-trippy Songs
With the Kesey-acid test connection most
important in showing where the Dead come
from musically, much of the film's second
half is devoted to a long spacey version of
"Dark Star," one of the classic head-trippy
songs.
Sunshine Daydream uses an imaginative
animated sequence, all done with stills
clipped from National Geographic to
illustrate "Dark Star," which gives much of
the film's last 40 minutes a Yellow
Submarine- ish flavor. But when one isn't "in
the mood," long improvisational pieces like
"Dark Star" tend to get boring, although
aided by imaginative graphics to go with the
music.
Music Perfectly Suited
Even with an overly long "Dark Star"
sequence, the vibrant first half of the movie
makes up for any second half excesses.
The old footage of the Kesey days and
early acid tests is masterfully mixed in with
the Oregon benefit and as the Dead segue
from "China Cat Sunflower" to "I Know
You Rider," Neal Cassidy, the speediest bus
driver of all time, appears driving the Merry
Prankster bus named "Further" with classic
abandon. The music fits perfectly, and
anyone in the audience can see how it was to
be "on the bus" in the acid-augmented
mid-60s.
The footage of the people attracted to a
free Dead concert allows anyone to see how

it is to be a part of the crowd of Dead freaks.
From small children playing under the stage
to a naked man writhing on top of a pole in
time to the music, it's your typical crowd out
for a good time and a good tan in the Oregon
sun.
Bests of Breasts
At a brief intermission while reels were
being changed on the lone projector,
questions and comments were solicited from
the audience. In the best Flicks tradition,
someone called out, "There's sure a lot of tit
in this movie."
Yes, many nubile women's breasts were
getting a tan in the hot Oregon sun, and in
the first reel, breasts received a lot of
attention from the filmmakers.
The number of bare breasts did help to
convey the atmosphere of freedom and
openness at the benefit, but cramming almost
every bare bosom into a five-minute sequence
may be an overly pointed use of the
phenomenon.
San Jose Showing
Technically and aesthetically the film is
not yet the way its makers want it to be,
Villegas .said after the first show.. The
Stanford screening made enough money to
pay for a print of the film, and the next
showing, at San Jose State, will have a better
sound system, according to Villegas.
But finished or not, Sunshine Daydream
should be considered must viewing for all
Dead fans and budding filmmakers interested
in seeing how much can be done well on a
shoestring.

the mood," long improvisational pieces like
"Dark Star" tend to get boring, although
aided by imaginative graphics to go with the
music.
Music Perfectly Suited
Even with an overly long "Dark Star"
sequence, the vibrant first half of the movie
makes up for any second half excesses.
The old footage of the Kesey days and
early acid tests is masterfully mixed in with
the Oregon benefit and as the Dead segue
from "China Cat Sunflower" to "I Know
You Rider," Neal Cassidy, the speediest bus
driver of all time, appears driving the Merry
Prankster bus named "Further" with classic
abandon. The music fits perfectly, and
anyone in the audience can see how it was to
be "on the bus" in the acid-augmented
mid-60s.
The footage of the people attracted to a
free Dead concert allows anyone to see how

it is to be a part of the crowd of Dead freaks.
From small children playing under the stage
to a naked man writhing on top of a pole in
time to the music, it's your typical crowd out
for a good time and a good tan in the Oregon
sun.
Bests of Breasts
At a brief intermission while reels were
being changed on the lone projector,
questions and comments were solicited from
the audience. In the best Flicks tradition,
someone called out, "There's sure a lot of tit
in this movie."
Yes, many nubile women's breasts were
getting a tan in the hot Oregon sun, and in
the first reel, breasts received a lot of
attention from the filmmakers.
The number of bare breasts did help to
convey the atmosphere of freedom and
openness at the benefit, but cramming almost
every bare bosom into a five-minute sequence
may be an overly pointed use of the
phenomenon.
San Jose Showing
Technically and aesthetically the film is
not yet the way its makers want it to be,
Villegas .said after the first show.. The
Stanford screening made enough money to
pay for a print of the film, and the next
showing, at San Jose State, will have a better
sound system, according to Villegas.
But finished or not, Sunshine Daydream
should be considered must viewing for all
Dead fans and budding filmmakers interested
in seeing how much can be done well on a
shoestring.
Imagine working for over two years on a
movie without realizing any monetary gain.
Such is the dedication of a group of
filmmakers and Grateful Dead freaks, who
prefer to be known as Canis Major, who have
put together Sunshine Daydream , a film
about the Dead and their music.
Since the Dead have always been
associated with the beginnings of
psychedelia, the Ken Kesey-led acid tests and
other early phenomena that became the
"counter-culture" to the rest of America,
filming the Dead in action in Oregon at a
benefit for Kesey's Eugene dairy was only
fitting and proper.
What isn't fitting and proper are the
delays and the inaction on the part of the
Dead that has kept the film from commercial
release. According to Joaquin Villegas,
spokesman fo{ Canis Major, the Dead have
refused to sign a release authorizing
commercial distribution of the movie.
Accurate Portrayal
The Dead have seen the movie, however,
Villegas said, and "they haven't been the
same since." He thinks they were freaked out
by the accuracy of the cinematic portrayal,
and are consequently unsure of what action
to take toward the film.
What of the movie, which was given its
first public screening at Memorial
Auditorium last Saturday night, attracting
more customers than Stanford night at
Marine World? It succeeds in capturing the
easy ambience of the kind of crowd that
would show up for a free Dead concert on a
hot August day, but Sunshine Daydream

doesn't really show the musical versatility of
the Dead that well.
Head-trippy Songs
With the Kesey-acid test connection most
important in showing where the Dead come
from musically, much of the film's second
half is devoted to a long spacey version of
"Dark Star," one of the classic head-trippy
songs.
Sunshine Daydream uses an imaginative
animated sequence, all done with stills
clipped from National Geographic to
illustrate "Dark Star," which gives much of
the film's last 40 minutes a Yellow
Submarine- ish flavor. But when one isn't "in
the mood," long improvisational pieces like
"Dark Star" tend to get boring, although
aided by imaginative graphics to go with the
music.
