# Guitar, Trumpet Create Unique Sound
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
Larry Coryell's marvelous
guitar work is the outstanding
feature of the Eleventh House's
music, but the group is much,
more than just Coryell apeKliis
sidemen.
Playing their blend of jazz and
rock at the Great American Music
Hall Friday night, they showed
they are one of the tightest and
most creative ensembles now
performing.
Seemingly at home in any
musical style, Coryell has the
imagination to make each of his
solos a fascinating excursion. His
electric playing is heavily
influenced by rock, but his
fluency in the blues and his jazz
background make him one of only
two or three electric guitarists
with a uniquely personal style.
Friday's program showed how
well Coryell's style can be
incorporated into the framework
of a band.
Guitar-Trumpet Blending
Coryell's compositions "Ism"
and "Eleventh House Blues"
featured the band's most
distinctive sound: rapid-fire
unison passages with Coryell's
guitar and Steve Lawrence's
electric trumpet blending so
completely that the individual
sounds become indistinguishable.
Lawrence also provided some
tasteful and excellent solos on
trumpet and fluegelhorn that
complemented Coryell's work
well without sounding like an
attempt to copy the guitarist's
style.
Keyboard player Mike

Mandel's tunes "Adam Smasher"
and "Joyride," which appeared on
the group's first album, are two
very pretty rock tunes that
received fine renditions Friday.
Mandel plays his arsenal of
electric instruments with the
reserve that many keyboard
players lack. His synthesizer is
used mostly for accompaniment,
and his solos on electric piano and
clavinet were tastefully short and
free from the ear-splitting noise
that has proved a problem for
many electronic pianists.
Powerful Drumming
Drummer Alphonze Mouzon is
the Eleventh House's second star.
A jazz veteran who was often
rapped for being too loud when
he played with McCoy Tyner,
Mouzon has finally found the
perfect group for his powerful
drumming.
His compositions, notably
"The Funky Waltz" and the new
"Cover Girl," are unpretentiously
soulful and provide excellent
vehicles for Coryell's lightning-fast
runs up and down the fretboard.

Mouzon also contributed two
long solo pieces (both called
"Where I'm Drumming From")
that came close to being songs for
the drums. Using his well-tuned
tom-toms to state the "melody,"
Mouzon added blazing snare
passages and inspired cymbal
work to provide drum solos that
were, for a change, good music.
Outstanding Acoustic Guitar
Mandel's solo piece, which
employed playback from his
synthesizer as accompaniment for
his electric piano, was a curiously
uneven effort, but Coryell's
unaccompanied work on acoustic
guitar was a joy.
His playing is clean and fast

enough to rival any classical
guitarist's, but Coryell never lets
his technical skills interfere with
the musical content of his solos.
An acoustic concert by Coryell
would provide much interest by
itself; that his solo work forms
only a part of the Eleventh
House's repertory shows how
many styles are at the group's
command.
The Eleventh House's music
always seems to come across best
live, where they hold interest for
jazz and rock fans alike. The
group's concerts are a rare
opportunity to see a master
guitarist and a creative dummer
together in a fine electric band.

most creative ensembles now
performing.
Seemingly at home in any
musical style, Coryell has the
imagination to make each of his
solos a fascinating excursion. His
electric playing is heavily
influenced by rock, but his
fluency in the blues and his jazz
background make him one of only
two or three electric guitarists
with a uniquely personal style.
Friday's program showed how
well Coryell's style can be
incorporated into the framework
of a band.
Guitar-Trumpet Blending
Coryell's compositions "Ism"
and "Eleventh House Blues"
featured the band's most
distinctive sound: rapid-fire
unison passages with Coryell's
guitar and Steve Lawrence's
electric trumpet blending so
completely that the individual
sounds become indistinguishable.
Lawrence also provided some
tasteful and excellent solos on
trumpet and fluegelhorn that
complemented Coryell's work
well without sounding like an
attempt to copy the guitarist's
style.
Keyboard player Mike

Mandel's tunes "Adam Smasher"
and "Joyride," which appeared on
the group's first album, are two
very pretty rock tunes that
received fine renditions Friday.
Mandel plays his arsenal of
electric instruments with the
reserve that many keyboard
players lack. His synthesizer is
used mostly for accompaniment,
and his solos on electric piano and
clavinet were tastefully short and
free from the ear-splitting noise
that has proved a problem for
many electronic pianists.
Powerful Drumming
Drummer Alphonze Mouzon is
the Eleventh House's second star.
A jazz veteran who was often
rapped for being too loud when
he played with McCoy Tyner,
Mouzon has finally found the
perfect group for his powerful
drumming.
His compositions, notably
"The Funky Waltz" and the new
"Cover Girl," are unpretentiously
soulful and provide excellent
vehicles for Coryell's lightning-fast
runs up and down the fretboard.

Mouzon also contributed two
long solo pieces (both called
"Where I'm Drumming From")
that came close to being songs for
the drums. Using his well-tuned
tom-toms to state the "melody,"
Mouzon added blazing snare
passages and inspired cymbal
work to provide drum solos that
were, for a change, good music.
Outstanding Acoustic Guitar
Mandel's solo piece, which
employed playback from his
synthesizer as accompaniment for
his electric piano, was a curiously
uneven effort, but Coryell's
unaccompanied work on acoustic
guitar was a joy.
His playing is clean and fast

enough to rival any classical
guitarist's, but Coryell never lets
his technical skills interfere with
the musical content of his solos.
An acoustic concert by Coryell
would provide much interest by
itself; that his solo work forms
only a part of the Eleventh
House's repertory shows how
many styles are at the group's
command.
The Eleventh House's music
always seems to come across best
live, where they hold interest for
jazz and rock fans alike. The
group's concerts are a rare
opportunity to see a master
guitarist and a creative dummer
together in a fine electric band.
Larry Coryell's marvelous
guitar work is the outstanding
feature of the Eleventh House's
music, but the group is much,
more than just Coryell apeKliis
sidemen.
Playing their blend of jazz and
rock at the Great American Music
Hall Friday night, they showed
they are one of the tightest and
most creative ensembles now
performing.
