Hampton Hawes and Don Asher
Raise Up Off Me:
A Portrait of Hampton Hawes
Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, Inc., $7.95
The story of pianist Hampton Hawes is probably
not all that different from that of many other jazz
musicians. -
He certainly wasn't the first nor the last jazz
man to become addicted to heroin and
subsequently serve time for possession. His wasn't
the only career interrupted by a stint in the army
overseas. And the church background of Hawes'
family was similar to several of his peers' Charlie
Parker immediately comes to mind.
What sets Raise Up Off Me apart from the
multitude of other such biographies is the man
himself, his personality, captured expertly by Don
Asher, author of several jazz-oriented novels.
This book 179 pages which can easily be read
at one sitting represents five years worth of
interviews conducted by Asher. The result, related
in an as-told-to form, recounts Hawes'4s years in
and out of music.
Hawes was raised the son of a "jackleg
Presbyterian preacher" in Los Angeles, and he
formed a negative view of religion at an early age.
"I've never seen so many people turned around,
messed up, and disillusioned as I did when I was a
kid going to church."
While still in high school, Hawes was already a
full-time pianist in jazz and R & B bands. As for the
religion which he'd turned away from, Hawes says,
"I didn't meet God, or a facsimile of him, till years
later at the Hi-Dee-Ho Club, playing alto in the
Howard McGhee band."
Charlie Parker, possibly the greatest talent in the
history of American music, was a particularly
strong influence on Hawes as a young musician.
Hawes' recollections of "Bird" are nearly as
insightful as the full-scale biographies devoted to
the man. "Watched him line up and take down
eleven shots of whiskey, pop a handful of bennies,
then tie up, smoking a joint at the same time. He
sweated like a horse for five minutes, got up, put
on his suit, and a half hour later was on the stand
playing strong and beautiful."
Surprisingly, one of the most interesting sections
of the book involes Hawes' years in the army. A lot
can be said for "military intelligence" (a
contradiction in terms, as Groucho Marx once put
it) by the fact that they not only enlisted an
obvious drug addict, but then stationed him in the
Orient, a junkie's paradise. Naturally, Hawes spent
more than his share of time in the stockade.
He also served five years in Fort Worth for
possession of narcotics, and this is where Hawes'
story distinguishes itself from that of any other
jazz-junkie.
On August 16, 1963 Hawes received a
presidential pardon from John F. Kennedy.
"Wasn't no miracle. What happened was normal,
the kind of thing that's supposed to happen if the
person on the throne is watching the shop, doing
his job."
The best thing about this particular biography is
that it does not end with "Muhammed Jones died a
year later, addicted to everything from smack to

Baby Ruths, without a pot to piss in..
Far from it. Hampton Hawes is currently at the
peak of a new career, heading his own trio, gigging
all over the world. That, in itself, pretty much says
it all about Hampton Hawes, probably the biggest
comeback story in jazz history.

Charles E. Shaw and Sheldon Campbell
Snakes Of The American West
Alfred A. Knopf, $12.95
The unfortunate aversion that has through
history fated so many snakes to being cruelly
cleaved with the stroke of a shovel or smashed with
a rock will probably keep Snakes of the American
West off the bestseller list.
But this informative and very readable book will
intrigue anyone who has ever handled a back-yard
garter snake or stood fascinated before the snake
house at the zoo.
Written by two herpetologists (snake experts),
Charles E. Shaw and Sheldon Campbell, Snakes
deals first with snakes in general their adaptive
characteristics and their evolution and then
provides over 200 pages of literature on western
snakes and 70 color prints.
In short, the story of these little understood and
seldom seen reptiles is a case of amazing adaptive
economy.
According to Shaw and Campbell, snakes
evolved from lizard origins some 125 million years
ago. At this time, a divergence in the reptile world
saw some lizards venture underground while the
others remained terrestrial.
In the progression towards evolutionary
economy, these sub-terrestrial lizards discarded
eyelids, external ears and limbs and developed new
adaptations to suit underground living.
According to the authors then, rather than being
primitive, undeveloped organisms, snakes are an
advanced, highly specialized order of vertebrates. -
One exampe of this is the slender western Blind
Snake that can smell and consequently follow the
scent-marked trails of ants. Another example of
extraordinary-development are the Sand Swimmers
that glide through sand beneath the surface as if it
were water.
Possessing heat-sensing organs to locate
warm-blooded prey, an effective poison-delivery
system and a jaw that can unhinge to accommodate
a victim larger than the snake's head, the
rattlesnake represents a superb economical design
for survival. '
Shaw and Campbell endeavor to dispell the
myths that surround snakes. For example, they
insist that snakes in fact die when §omeone or
something does them in. They don't hang on until
sunset as one myth proposes.
But Shaw points out that a dead rattlesnake
ought to be handled judiciously, advice well taken
because I have seen the bloody stump of a
beheaded rattlesnake strike a friend of mine in the
wrist.
The authors close the book with an epitaph of
sorts. "Cars run over it; bulldozers root it out;
people kill it. Yet, in it remains something of
nature and something of beauty."
—D. Paul Yeuell
