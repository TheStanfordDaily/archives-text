## Cards Open At UCLA In 'Must Win' Contest 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The season starts in Los
Angeles tomorrow night and
Stanford's football team knows
very well it might end there.
"We've been improving for
three weeks," first-string
quarterback Mike Cordova said.
"This week, we'll have to be
improved."
The Cards' open pursuit of
what would be their third Pacific
Eight title in five years tomorrow
at UCLA. If Stanford wins its first
game, the team will have a clear
shot at USC for the
championship, barring unforeseen
collapse. If the Cards
lose ... well, last year, after
bowing 59-13 to the Bruins,
Stanford wouldn't have gone to
the Rose Bowl even if it had
beaten the Trojans.
And UCLA, despite being
tabbed as 11-point favorites, isn't
exactly overconfident. Coach
Dick Vermeil called Stanford the
prime challenger to USC, rating
his own Bruins one class lower.
Vermeil has called this "the
most important game we'll play
all season." His methods of
motivating his players are
somewhat strange: reports
indicate that the Bruins have been
holding brief practices all week.
Good Health
Stanford, meanwhile, has been
working especially hard,
something it can afford to do
since it enters the Pac-8 season in
remarkably good health. Dave
Walker, a reserve defensive end
who injured his knee and will be
out for the year, is the only

Cardinal who won't be able to
play.
UCLA, meanwhile, has been
somewhat crippled on defense.
Inside linebacker Frank
Manumaleuna, the Bruins'
freshman sensation in the 17-17
tie with Tennessee, has a
congenital neck problem and may
not play any more football. To
replace him, Fulton Kuykendall,
UCLA's Ail-American candidate,
has been moved from outside
linebacker inside.
Defensive tackle Pat Sweetland
is also out, while three other
defensive starters are just now
recovering from various injuries.
Great Offense
While the Bruins' defense has
its problems, the offense has been
superb. The team leads the league
in total offense, averaging 415
yards per game, about 65 percent
of them on the ground.
Vermeil has junked the
Wishbone except for short
yardage situations, and installed
the Veer-T, which utilizes two
split receivers on every play.
UCLA quarterback John
Sciarra gets to run a lot of options
off the veer offense, and has had
great success both running and
passing. Stanford's defense will
have to watch carefully before
they pursue. Various plays and

blocking assignments that are used
with the veer are designed to
confuse defenders.
UCLA's running backs this
year aren't exactly Kermit
Johnson and James McAlister. But
the averages of the three leading
ballcarriers, Russel Charles,
Wendell Tyler and Carl Zaby, are
similar to those of the Blair pair,
all exceeding the 5.0 yards per
carry mark.
Fumbles A Key
The key to Bruin offensive
success is just the same as it was last
ye ar f u m b 1 es. Fumbles
accounted in large measure for the
shocking 21-10 loss to lowa.
When the Bruins haven't lost the
football, their attack hasn't been
stopped.
Vermeil has warned his team
all week that "Stanford always
plays well in the Coliseum." And
playing at night shouldn't hurt the
team, either. The last time
Stanford played under the lights,
they beat USC en route to the
1972 Rose Bowl. And Cordova
prefers passing under the lights, as
he played his entire high school
career at night.
Those omens seem to point to
a Stanford victory. But many
people think that if Stanford
plays as well as it did last week
against Michigan, it won't take
anything supernatural to win.

READY FOR THE KlLL—Ever see a photo of Forrie Martin (49) where he didn't look like he was about
to kill someone? Well, this one, taken last week, isn't it. Forrie returns to Los Angeles Coliseum
tomorrow, site of his now-famous battle with Efren Herrera two years ago. In case you weren't around,
Forrie irritated Herrera so much the UCLA kicker booted him and was penalized. The next play, Herrera
was so concerned with Forrie he forgot to tackle the Stanford ballcarrier, who returned the kickoff for a
TD.

his own Bruins one class lower.
Vermeil has called this "the
most important game we'll play
all season." His methods of
motivating his players are
somewhat strange: reports
indicate that the Bruins have been
holding brief practices all week.
Good Health
Stanford, meanwhile, has been
working especially hard,
something it can afford to do
since it enters the Pac-8 season in
remarkably good health. Dave
Walker, a reserve defensive end
who injured his knee and will be
out for the year, is the only

Cardinal who won't be able to
play.
UCLA, meanwhile, has been
somewhat crippled on defense.
Inside linebacker Frank
Manumaleuna, the Bruins'
freshman sensation in the 17-17
tie with Tennessee, has a
congenital neck problem and may
not play any more football. To
replace him, Fulton Kuykendall,
UCLA's Ail-American candidate,
has been moved from outside
linebacker inside.
Defensive tackle Pat Sweetland
is also out, while three other
defensive starters are just now
recovering from various injuries.
Great Offense
While the Bruins' defense has
its problems, the offense has been
superb. The team leads the league
in total offense, averaging 415
yards per game, about 65 percent
of them on the ground.
Vermeil has junked the
Wishbone except for short
yardage situations, and installed
the Veer-T, which utilizes two
split receivers on every play.
UCLA quarterback John
Sciarra gets to run a lot of options
off the veer offense, and has had
great success both running and
passing. Stanford's defense will
have to watch carefully before
they pursue. Various plays and

blocking assignments that are used
with the veer are designed to
confuse defenders.
UCLA's running backs this
year aren't exactly Kermit
Johnson and James McAlister. But
the averages of the three leading
ballcarriers, Russel Charles,
Wendell Tyler and Carl Zaby, are
similar to those of the Blair pair,
all exceeding the 5.0 yards per
carry mark.
Fumbles A Key
The key to Bruin offensive
success is just the same as it was last
ye ar f u m b 1 es. Fumbles
accounted in large measure for the
shocking 21-10 loss to lowa.
When the Bruins haven't lost the
football, their attack hasn't been
stopped.
Vermeil has warned his team
all week that "Stanford always
plays well in the Coliseum." And
playing at night shouldn't hurt the
team, either. The last time
Stanford played under the lights,
they beat USC en route to the
1972 Rose Bowl. And Cordova
prefers passing under the lights, as
he played his entire high school
career at night.
Those omens seem to point to
a Stanford victory. But many
people think that if Stanford
plays as well as it did last week
against Michigan, it won't take
anything supernatural to win.

READY FOR THE KlLL—Ever see a photo of Forrie Martin (49) where he didn't look like he was about
to kill someone? Well, this one, taken last week, isn't it. Forrie returns to Los Angeles Coliseum
tomorrow, site of his now-famous battle with Efren Herrera two years ago. In case you weren't around,
Forrie irritated Herrera so much the UCLA kicker booted him and was penalized. The next play, Herrera
was so concerned with Forrie he forgot to tackle the Stanford ballcarrier, who returned the kickoff for a
TD.
The season starts in Los
Angeles tomorrow night and
Stanford's football team knows
very well it might end there.
"We've been improving for
three weeks," first-string
quarterback Mike Cordova said.
"This week, we'll have to be
improved."
The Cards' open pursuit of
what would be their third Pacific
Eight title in five years tomorrow
at UCLA. If Stanford wins its first
game, the team will have a clear
shot at USC for the
championship, barring unforeseen
collapse. If the Cards
lose ... well, last year, after
bowing 59-13 to the Bruins,
Stanford wouldn't have gone to
the Rose Bowl even if it had
beaten the Trojans.
And UCLA, despite being
tabbed as 11-point favorites, isn't
exactly overconfident. Coach

linebacker inside.
Defensive tackle Pat Sweetland
is also out, while three other
defensive starters are just now
recovering from various injuries.
Great Offense
While the Bruins' defense has
its problems, the offense has been
superb. The team leads the league
in total offense, averaging 415
yards per game, about 65 percent
of them on the ground.
Vermeil has junked the
Wishbone except for short
yardage situations, and installed
the Veer-T, which utilizes two
split receivers on every play.
UCLA quarterback John
Sciarra gets to run a lot of options
off the veer offense, and has had
great success both running and
passing. Stanford's defense will
have to watch carefully before
they pursue. Various plays and

blocking assignments that are used
with the veer are designed to
confuse defenders.
UCLA's running backs this
year aren't exactly Kermit
Johnson and James McAlister. But
the averages of the three leading
ballcarriers, Russel Charles,
Wendell Tyler and Carl Zaby, are
similar to those of the Blair pair,
all exceeding the 5.0 yards per
carry mark.
Fumbles A Key
The key to Bruin offensive
success is just the same as it was last
ye ar f u m b 1 es. Fumbles
accounted in large measure for the
shocking 21-10 loss to lowa.
When the Bruins haven't lost the
football, their attack hasn't been
stopped.
Vermeil has warned his team
all week that "Stanford always
plays well in the Coliseum." And
playing at night shouldn't hurt the
team, either. The last time
Stanford played under the lights,
they beat USC en route to the
1972 Rose Bowl. And Cordova
prefers passing under the lights, as
he played his entire high school
career at night.
Those omens seem to point to
a Stanford victory. But many
people think that if Stanford
plays as well as it did last week
against Michigan, it won't take
anything supernatural to win.

READY FOR THE KlLL—Ever see a photo of Forrie Martin (49) where he didn't look like he was about
to kill someone? Well, this one, taken last week, isn't it. Forrie returns to Los Angeles Coliseum
tomorrow, site of his now-famous battle with Efren Herrera two years ago. In case you weren't around,
Forrie irritated Herrera so much the UCLA kicker booted him and was penalized. The next play, Herrera
was so concerned with Forrie he forgot to tackle the Stanford ballcarrier, who returned the kickoff for a
TD.
