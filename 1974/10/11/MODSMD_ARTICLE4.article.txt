# Professors' Charges
## CIA 'Not Alone' In Chile Coup 
### DAVID SMITH 
"We shouldn't believe that the CIA
acted alone and that the rest of our
government was somehow innocent in
overthrowing Salvador Allende," San
Jose State Prof. Patricia Fagen told a
Bishop Auditorium crowd last night.
"The U.S. government's
'low-profile' economic policies played
just as important a role as the CIA
action in bringing down the Chilean
government, which was a model for
democracy," she added.
Fagen's remarks were part of a
four-person panel discussion on "Chile
and Vietnam: Lessons of American
Intervention." She and her husband,
Richard, a political science professor
here who also spoke last night, studied
in Chile during 1972 and 1973.
"It is really frightening to see how
the money was allotted in Chile,"
Patricia Fagen said." Even the. usual
policymakers were excluded; Henry
Kissinger, in connivance with Richard
Nixon, made virtually all the policy
decisions.
"Presumably only in totalitarian

countries are such far-ranging decisions
made in secret by one or two men,"
she noted.
The Fagens reported that CIA
intervention had played on
long-standing class tensions to produce
unrest. "The country was highly
vulnerable to outside interference,
especially since the army was the only
armed group in Chile," Richard Fagen
stated.
He added that he thought the
present military junta had the support
of less than 25 percent of the Chilean
people, but that "repression has been
so brutal and well organized that it
will be quite some time before the
resistance will be able to deal with it."
Patricia Fagen said that thousands
of leftists had been imprisoned and
killed under the present Chilean
government. "Under Allende there was
political influence placed on the
people, but there were no political
prisoners—one source did claim there
were two during his presidency."
Political science graduate student
Steve Thomas claimed that the policies
of President Nguyen Van Thieu's
South Vietnamese government are
quite similar to the Chilean junta's.
"There are 100 to 200 thousand
political prisoners in Vietnam," he
said.
"The Vietnamese police are
completely trained by the United
States," he said. "Now they are
creating a computerized central
records system to track every citizen
over 15, and the U.S. is financing
construction of prisons, interrogation
centers and 'tiger cages.' "
Noting that "90 percent of U.S. aid
to Vietnam doesn't go to health,
agriculture, or education," Thomas
added, "today's Vietnam is essentially
a U.S. creation, and its policies are thus
American policies."
David Barton, a former director of

the American Friends Service
Committee medical center in Quang
Ngai, said that he treated victims of
Vietnamese police torture virtually
every day.
"We saw injured patients—often
amputees—who were shackeled to
their beds," said Barton. "In the town
there were five or six CIA agents who
advised the special police that did the
torturing. We saw evidence of
electrical torture, and x-rays showed
signs of skull torture."
The panel discussion formed part of
the Stanford International Days of
Concern program, which will conclude
today with a White Plaza rally.
According to program sponsors, the
events were designed to point out the
issues of political prisoners and U.S.
support of "repressive regimes."

people, but that "repression has been
so brutal and well organized that it
will be quite some time before the
resistance will be able to deal with it."
Patricia Fagen said that thousands
of leftists had been imprisoned and
killed under the present Chilean
government. "Under Allende there was
political influence placed on the
people, but there were no political
prisoners—one source did claim there
were two during his presidency."
Political science graduate student
Steve Thomas claimed that the policies
of President Nguyen Van Thieu's
South Vietnamese government are
quite similar to the Chilean junta's.
"There are 100 to 200 thousand
political prisoners in Vietnam," he
said.
"The Vietnamese police are
completely trained by the United
States," he said. "Now they are
creating a computerized central
records system to track every citizen
over 15, and the U.S. is financing
construction of prisons, interrogation
centers and 'tiger cages.' "
Noting that "90 percent of U.S. aid
to Vietnam doesn't go to health,
agriculture, or education," Thomas
added, "today's Vietnam is essentially
a U.S. creation, and its policies are thus
American policies."
David Barton, a former director of

the American Friends Service
Committee medical center in Quang
Ngai, said that he treated victims of
Vietnamese police torture virtually
every day.
"We saw injured patients—often
amputees—who were shackeled to
their beds," said Barton. "In the town
there were five or six CIA agents who
advised the special police that did the
torturing. We saw evidence of
electrical torture, and x-rays showed
signs of skull torture."
The panel discussion formed part of
the Stanford International Days of
Concern program, which will conclude
today with a White Plaza rally.
According to program sponsors, the
events were designed to point out the
issues of political prisoners and U.S.
support of "repressive regimes."

in Chile were the victims of "brutal repression."

"We shouldn't believe that the CIA
acted alone and that the rest of our
government was somehow innocent in
overthrowing Salvador Allende," San
Jose State Prof. Patricia Fagen told a
Bishop Auditorium crowd last night.
"The U.S. government's
'low-profile' economic policies played
just as important a role as the CIA
action in bringing down the Chilean
government, which was a model for
democracy," she added.
Fagen's remarks were part of a
four-person panel discussion on "Chile
and Vietnam: Lessons of American
Intervention." She and her husband,
Richard, a political science professor
here who also spoke last night, studied
in Chile during 1972 and 1973.
"It is really frightening to see how
the money was allotted in Chile,"
Patricia Fagen said." Even the. usual
policymakers were excluded; Henry
Kissinger, in connivance with Richard
Nixon, made virtually all the policy
decisions.
"Presumably only in totalitarian

countries are such far-ranging decisions
made in secret by one or two men,"
she noted.
The Fagens reported that CIA
intervention had played on
long-standing class tensions to produce
unrest. "The country was highly
vulnerable to outside interference,
especially since the army was the only
armed group in Chile," Richard Fagen
stated.
He added that he thought the
present military junta had the support
of less than 25 percent of the Chilean
people, but that "repression has been
so brutal and well organized that it
will be quite some time before the
resistance will be able to deal with it."
