# This UCLA Quarterback Isn't Overrated
## John Sciarra Can Do It All 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
If you believed everything the press told
you about UCLA quarterbacks, you'd think
they've all suffered from a hereditary
arthritis condition afflicting only the
throwing arm.
In reality, UCLA has had several talented
passers, but their later failures have erased
the memories of their previous status. First,
it was Heisman Trophy winner Gary Beban,
whose passing ability was held in such high
regard by the pros that he was moved to
running back and wide receiver. Then there
was Dennis Dummit, who set 14 UCLA
passing records but was ignored in the 1971
National Football League draft. "How good
could he have been?" critics wondered.
The subsequent appearance of Pepper
Rodgers' run-oriented Wishbone offense just
about assured a continuation of the trend,
and John Sciarra (pronounced SHA-ra) was
the new victim.
But now the more balanced Veer offense
under new head coach Dick Vermeil has
replaced the Wishbone and Sciarra could be
the one to remove the stigma. If this season is
any indication, Sciarra is the one.
He leads the Pac-8 in total offense and
completion percentage (60 percent), has
already thrown for more yards than all of last
year, when he was UCLA's leading passer and
has averaged 9.02 yards per pass attempt
(anything over 8 is considered excellent).
Sciarra is also sixth in the Pac-8 in rushing,
averaging an impressive 5.6 yards per carry.
Need Time
"People thought I couldn't throw the
football," Sciarra said. "If you don't give a
guy a chance, you'll never know how he can
throw. You need to put time into it. The
only way to get any better is by practice and
we weren't getting any with the Wishbone. If
Joe Namath doesn't throw during practice,
you can't expect him to throw 65 percent."
The Wishbone disguised Sciarra's arm so
well, even Vermeil has been surprised. "I
wish I'd realized earlier that he could throw
as well as he can," Vermeil said, "because I'd
have done more things with the offense. He's
progressed much further than I thought he
would."
Above all, Vermeil likes Sciarra's intensity
and versatility. "He's a great athlete and
competitive as all hell. As for running and
passing [ability] I don't believe there's
another quarterback in the country with a
better combination."
The 5-foot-10, 178-pound quarterback is
also happy with his progress but modestly
feels he has a long way to go. "I'm nowhere

near a good passer. I consider myself an
average passer who's coming along. I hope I
can improve as the season goes on."
Third Year
Sciarra's integration into UCLA's program
has been rapid. Although only a junior, he's
in his third varsity year. As a freshman,
Sciarra led the team in punt and kickoff
returns and also played split end.
He continued to return punts as a
sophomore and started three games at
quarterback, establishing himself as the only
player in the country to combine those tasks.
Sciarra's punt returning days are over for the
time being, as Vermeil has decided his value
to the team is not worth the risk.
Unfortunately for UCLA, the Bruins don't

seem to be doing as well as Sciarra. Stanford
would be happy to assume their 2-1-1 record,
but UCLA performed impressively only in a
56-14 rout of Michigan State. A loss to lowa
and a mediocre, although winning effort
against Utah last week have given Sciarra
"mixed emotions" about the season.
Fumble Problems
"We played a fine game against Michigan
State," Sciarra said, "but besides that I
wouldn't say we've shown our potential.
Fumbles were the main reason we tied
Tennessee and lost to lowa. I hope we don't
have many more, knock on wood. We didn't
play real well against Utah. Their defense
confused us."
Sciarra then looked ahead to tomorrow
night's game with Stanford at the Los
Angeles Coliseum. He called Stanford "the
best team we've played so far," and that
includes Tennessee.
"Stanford has a fine team although i£s
record doesn't show it," Sciarra said. "We
know they have an exceptional defense and I
hope we'll be prepared."
There's more to John Sciarra than
football. In fact, he resents being referred to
only as an athlete.
Something Else
"Football isn't the only thing in life. It's
only one of many things that makes me
happy. Football alone can't make an
individual happy there's got to be
something else. I'd like to be known as a
'student-athlete' because I'm a student first
and an athlete second."
Unlike so many others, Sciarra has backed
up his statements with action. When not
running options last spring, he was running
for student office at UCLA. He was elected
"General Representative," serving as a middle
man between the students and UCLA's
Student Legislative Committee. He informs
the students of the workings of their
government and tries to get feedback.
A native of the Los Angeles area, Sciarra
graduated from Bishop Amat High where he
played with USC's Pat Haden and J.K.
McKay. In his senior year, Sciarra was named
Southern California's Player of the Year. He
chose UCLA because he felt it was strong in
his three criteria: academics, athletics, and
social environment, in that order.
"I've never second guessed my decision,"
Sciarra said. "I've loved it at UCLA. The
students are nice and those who run the
school are good people. I couldn't be
happier."
But a Rose Bowl wouldn't hurt, huh
John?

DOUBLE THREAT—UCLA quarterback
John Sciarra has to content himself with
being "only" one of the leading passers and
leading rushers in the Pac-8. Sciarra's coach,
Dick Vermeil, isn't letting him run back
punts and kickoffs this year. Wonder why?
