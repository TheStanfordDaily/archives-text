# Aide To The Masters, But
## UCLA's Vermeil His Own Man 
### CHRIS BAKER 
WESTWOOD— Pictures of four
brilliant pro football coaches-
John Ralston, George Allen,
Chuck Knox and Tommy
Prothro— hang on the wall in the
office of UCLA football coach
Richard Albert Vermeil.
Vermeil served as an assistant
coach under all of them, and it
shows. But he's still very much his
own man.
He's as much a positive thinker
as Ralston and Allen. But, unlike
them, he doesn't talk as if he's
always standing on a pulpit.
Knox makes every game his
Los Angeles Rams play into a
crusade against the potential
Super Bowl winner. Vermeil's
statements about his opponents
are similarly positive, but his
statements seem more sincere.
Former UCLA (currently San
Diego Charger) coach Prothro is
considered one of the most
brilliant football strategists

Vermeil is a great innovator, too,
but his Veer T offense is firmly
rooted in practicality.
His Own Man
But he's more than a
combination of these men. "Sure
I picked up something from all
the people I worked for. They've
all taught me lessons, but I'm my
own man," said Vermeil.
He told the Southern
California Sportswriters this week
that Stanford is the Bruins' most
important opponent. While his
statements evoked about as much
comment as Knox' cries, he has
good reason to take the Cards
seriously.
Vermeil's first collegiate
coaching assignment was under
John Ralston on the Farm
(1965-69). After tutoring the
freshman squad his first year, he
turned his attention to the
offensive backfield and passing
offense. A picture of one of his
pupils, Jim Plunkett, hangs on the

wall. "Some of the people up
there still haven't forgiven me for
leaving Stanford," said Vermeil.
He says that Ralston taught
him persistence. "The greatest
thing I learned from John was
that you have to be persistent.
Some of the guys he [Ralston)
had writing about him said that he
should have been fired. But there
he was a couple of years later
taking 'em to two Rose Bowls."
Displays Emotion
Vermeil, unlike his crosstown
rival John McKay, openly displays
his emotions. While McKay uses a
golf cart to tour the practice fields
at USC, Vermeil, who runs from
group to group, seems less
aloof.
Like McKay, Vermeil, who
served as an assistant coach for 10
years, puts a lot of responsibility
in the hands of his aides. "I like to
have good people around me and I
do I believe that you must give
your assistants a lot of
responsibility, but the final
decision rests with me," Vermeil
said.
McKay has said that UCLA
attracts the flashy individual.
While the Bruins may be the most
individualistic team in the Pac-8,
Vermeil runs a tight ship on the
practice field. "College football is
a game of concentration,"
Vermeil said. "This requires
discipline and I give it to 'em," he
added.
In This Together
Some have criticized him for
being cold. But early this season,
after the Bruins pulled off an
upset of sorts tying Tennessee, he
was anything but icy. He called
Tennessee coach Bill Battle "to
shoot the breeze."

A lot of college football
coaches would rather talk to a
drunk alum than to another head
coach, but not Vermeil. "We're all
in this together. After our games I
like to compare notes."
UCLA fans think they have
another Johnny Wooden in
Vermeil. A UCLA slogan says, "A
New Deal With Great Appeal,
Coach DickVermeil."One wonders
if the slogan is A more than a
pronunciation guide.
Vermeil puts this popularity
into perspective. "There's always
a great deal of enthusiasm when a
new man takes over. It happens
anywhere you go. I just hope I
can maintain it. I don't think it's
me. I do know that UCLA has a
darn good football team."

A lot of college football
coaches would rather talk to a
drunk alum than to another head
coach, but not Vermeil. "We're all
in this together. After our games I
like to compare notes."
UCLA fans think they have
another Johnny Wooden in
Vermeil. A UCLA slogan says, "A
New Deal With Great Appeal,
Coach DickVermeil."One wonders
if the slogan is A more than a
pronunciation guide.
Vermeil puts this popularity
into perspective. "There's always
a great deal of enthusiasm when a
new man takes over. It happens
anywhere you go. I just hope I
can maintain it. I don't think it's
me. I do know that UCLA has a
darn good football team."

WESTWOOD— Pictures of four
brilliant pro football coaches-
John Ralston, George Allen,
Chuck Knox and Tommy
Prothro— hang on the wall in the
office of UCLA football coach
Richard Albert Vermeil.
Vermeil served as an assistant
coach under all of them, and it
shows. But he's still very much his
own man.
He's as much a positive thinker
as Ralston and Allen. But, unlike
them, he doesn't talk as if he's
always standing on a pulpit.
Knox makes every game his
Los Angeles Rams play into a
crusade against the potential
Super Bowl winner. Vermeil's
statements about his opponents
are similarly positive, but his
statements seem more sincere.
Former UCLA (currently San
Diego Charger) coach Prothro is
considered one of the most
brilliant football strategists

Vermeil is a great innovator, too,
but his Veer T offense is firmly
rooted in practicality.
His Own Man
But he's more than a
combination of these men. "Sure
I picked up something from all
the people I worked for. They've
all taught me lessons, but I'm my
own man," said Vermeil.
He told the Southern
California Sportswriters this week
that Stanford is the Bruins' most
important opponent. While his
statements evoked about as much
comment as Knox' cries, he has
good reason to take the Cards
seriously.
Vermeil's first collegiate
coaching assignment was under
John Ralston on the Farm
(1965-69). After tutoring the
freshman squad his first year, he
turned his attention to the
offensive backfield and passing
offense. A picture of one of his
pupils, Jim Plunkett, hangs on the

wall. "Some of the people up
there still haven't forgiven me for
leaving Stanford," said Vermeil.
He says that Ralston taught
him persistence. "The greatest
thing I learned from John was
that you have to be persistent.
Some of the guys he [Ralston)
had writing about him said that he
should have been fired. But there
he was a couple of years later
taking 'em to two Rose Bowls."
Displays Emotion
Vermeil, unlike his crosstown
rival John McKay, openly displays
his emotions. While McKay uses a
golf cart to tour the practice fields
at USC, Vermeil, who runs from
group to group, seems less
aloof.
Like McKay, Vermeil, who
served as an assistant coach for 10
years, puts a lot of responsibility
in the hands of his aides. "I like to
have good people around me and I
do I believe that you must give
your assistants a lot of
responsibility, but the final
decision rests with me," Vermeil
said.
McKay has said that UCLA
attracts the flashy individual.
While the Bruins may be the most
individualistic team in the Pac-8,
Vermeil runs a tight ship on the
practice field. "College football is
a game of concentration,"
Vermeil said. "This requires
discipline and I give it to 'em," he
added.
In This Together
Some have criticized him for
being cold. But early this season,
after the Bruins pulled off an
upset of sorts tying Tennessee, he
was anything but icy. He called
Tennessee coach Bill Battle "to
shoot the breeze."

A lot of college football
