Unfortunately, it's still USC's league.
Much as I hate to admit it, the Trojans, who've been to the Rose
Bowl six out of the last eight years, are probably going to be there
again on Jan. 1.
Which is probably fortunate from the view of the Pacific Eight
conference, since, judging by performances in non-conference play,
USC is the only team that could possibly beat Ohio State.
The league hasn't been overwhelming so far, compiling a 12-17-2
record against tough non-conference foes. Tough, but. . . well,
everyone except California and Washington blew a game they should
have won somewhere in pre-season play.
It seems like emotion played a big part in many of those losses.
Emotion seems to have been a bigger factor than it used to be; maybe
that's because college teams are more even in- ability than they have
been.
So emotion, and how I think certain schools will react in different
games, plays a big part in these predictions. Here goes.
1. USC. The Trojans aren't going to lose any games up in the
Northwest through fumbles and bad defense. Their defense is too
good; in three games, opponents have only gotten 32 points. This isn't
John McKay s best team, but USC has proven it can win. Last year,
the Trojans were not as good a team as UCLA (look at comparative
scores in just about any game), but still went to Pasadena. That says
something about the kind of team USC has. We may hate 'em, but
we've got to respect 'em.
2. Stanford. The Cards have the talent to beat USC. But even if
they do, and also drop UCLA, Pasadena is a long way off. I'm not sure
Stanford knows how to win close games on bad days.
3. California. Mike White knows what he's doing, contrary to his
first two years as head coach, when he couldn't quite figure out why
his old John Ralston motivating techniques weren't working. The
Bears have the best offensive talent in the league. The team has shown
a lot more than has Stanford, but when the student body doesn't care,
and the team is ineligible for post-season play, a couple dull losses
may follow.
4. UCLA. Why so low? First, the Bruins are too banged up on
defense. Second, I'm not sure the veer isn't defensable. Most
importantly, if as I think will happen, Stanford wins tomorrow's
game, UCLA will mentally fold up. If the Bruins win, put
them second and Stanford fourth.
5. Washington State. The Cougars should win in the cold weather
of Pullman, maybe over Stanford. Jim Sweeney's a good coach and
even in years when he doesn't have anything on offense and little on
defense, his teams won't be embarrassed.
6. Oregon. The Ducks have, statistically at least, the best rushing
defense in the league. But realistically, a team that can only score 10
points against Northwestern is going to have its problems.
7. Washington. The Huskies- have done well in pre-season play,
heaven knows why. After'fhe Pac-8 skywriters tour, one sportswriter
said the Huskies "were the worst team I ever saw." But not quite.
8. Oregon State. Dee and Andros are dirty words in Corvallis these
days. Unless he can get his club up for Washington tomorrow, he may
never win another game in his coaching career, which isn't likely to
last too long.
