JV Football
Since USC and UCLA
cancelled their junior varsity
football programs, Stanford has
had to find two replacement
games to make up their four-game
card.
So, a second battle with Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo has been
added, at S.L.O. on Nov. 11. The
other replacement? None other
than that famous school, the
College of Siskiyous. Stanford will
travel to Weed for the game Oct.
25. The slogan for the game is
obvious: "Smoke Weed."
Get Your Tickets
If you were one of those who
were disappointed when you tried
to get UCLA student rooter
tickets, don't make the same
mistake and miss the Big Game.
Students and staff may pick up
their specially priced ducats any
day before Oct. 25. After that,
the Athletic Department cannot
guarantee tickets for. the Nov. 23
game at Berkeley. Prices are $3
for students, $3.50 for staff.
Some Results
Stanford's junior varsity soccer
team lost to Woodside Priory 3-2
Wednesday, losing on a
goal with 10 minutes to play.
Meanwhile, two women golfers,
Pat Cornet and Pam Palmieri, shot
76 and 80 respectively to lead
after one day of play at the
Tucker Invitational in
Albaquerque, New Mexico.
Seventeen schools have entered
two-woman teams. The addition
of Palmieri to the Stanford team
has given the Cardinals a one-two
combination that will be hard to
beat.
Surf Club
The Stanford Surf Club started
this year's weekly trips on an
ecological note last Sunday. After
a few hours of surfing at chilly
Moss Landing, the 10 club
members combed the beach
picking up trash and glass. John
Eaton, the club's president,
predicted that beach clean-up will
become a regular part of all surf
trips.
Plans to begin competition or
get-togethers with groups of
surfers at other colleges will be
discussed at the next meeting, as
yet unscheduled.
All students are invited to
participate in Surf Club activities
regardless of sex or experience.

Anyone interested should contact
Eaton (326-1254).
Managers Still Needed
Looking for an extra unit and
an interesting activity? The
football team is still in need of
managers. Anyone interested
should contact Alan Chock out on
the practice field any day at 2:30.
Soccer Game
Stanford's soccer team, 2-1-1
on the season, will play UCLA in
Los Angeles at 2 p.m. tomorrow.
The 6ruins were NCAA
runners-up last year, but Stanford
coach Fred Priddle thinks the
Cards can win on the heels of last
weekend's tie with nationally
ranked USF.
Basketball Arrives
It seems awfully early, but
coach Howie Dallmar will
welcome candidates for Stanford's
1974-75 basketball team to the
Arst ofAcial practice this Tuesday.
Heading the list of returnees
from last year's varsity is 7-foot
center Rich Kelley, who has twice
been named to the PaciAc Eight
All-Conference team. Starters Ed
Schweitzer (6-8 x / 2), Tim Patterson
(6-11) and Melvin Arterberry
(6-3 ! /2) are also back, along with
Scott Trobbe, Mark Gilberg, Ben
Bluitt, 4 all of whom started at
times the past two seasons.
Other returning varsity players
are Archie Dean, Mike Simons,
Rich Wohlstadter and Marty
Moroski.
The Cards open their season at
Maples Pavilion on Nov. 30
against Louisiana State.
