# Water Polo Goalie Coach
## Kajlich: Man Of Many Talents 
### R.H. KUSTEL 
Question: What college water polo team on the
West Coast currently enjoys the luxury of a
specialized goalie coach? (Hint: this former world
class player holds a degree in chemical engineering,
defected from Czechoslovakia in 1967 and is an
inventor, all rolled into one.)
Well, Stanford is fortunate enough to have
acquired the services of Anton Kajlich, a new and
fascinating tutor for the Cardinal goalie corps.
Anton's trek to Stanford was a long and
complex one, beginning in 1964 when a young man
by the name of Art Lambert (former U.S. Olympic
Coach and current Card headman) was sent by the
State Department to Czechoslovakia to learn more
about the Eastern European style of play which
had dominated international competition since the
19305.
While in Czechoslovakia, Lambert became
friends with Kajlich, a young Czech goalie, and
departed with an open offer of assistance should
Anton ever desire to come to America.
In 1967, fresh out of college with a degree in
chemical engineering, Anton contacted his old
friend Lambert, who was able to secure him an
athletic scholarship from Cal coach Pete Cutino.
Anton subsequently defected and spent 1968 at Cal
taking English and batting away Pac-8 opponents'
shots.
Floating Goals
The past five years, Anton has worked and
traveled across the world promoting one of his
inventions, the Abating goals currently used by
Stanford and many other water polo teams. While
promoting his business, Anton has played in five
countries the past two years, including Hungary the
summer before last.
There, "like all socialist countries," he was given

a full-paying job "for a few Hours a day," then
practiced water polo. This, he feels, is one reason
that the United States hasn't achieved parity with
the world's top teams (Yugoslavia, Hungary, and
Olympic Gold-Medalist USSR).
The problem, as he sees it, is that the U.S.'s top
players, "after finally gaining the ability and
experience necessary to compete on an
international level," graduate from college and are
forced by the pressures of the job market to
discontinue their water polo careers. He points out
that the top world teams have many players in the
30-31 age bracket, while the U.S. perennially fields
young teams, usually in the 20-21 age group.
Invaluable Aid
Cardinal coach Lambert has thus found Kajlich's
assistance valuable. Anton noted that goalies are
generally neglected "because the coach must be
concerned with so many other players."
This problem is alleviated with Anton's
presence, as Lambert is able to fully devote his
attention to the bulk of the squad without
worrying as much about the training or
conditioning of the man he chooses to fill a most
important position.
The goalies themselves are also impressed with
Kajlich's work. Chris Dorst, the current starting
goalie, feels that he "can't help but learn from a
man with his ability." The sophomore watched
Anton play on Concord's awesome ASU team this
summer (at 31, Anton proudly describes himself as
"the oldest active player in the U.S.) and calls him
"one of the best I've ever seen."
Anton is optimistic on the Cards' chances this
year, and feels that "Stanford is working so hard
under Lambert" that the team should be a serious
contender in the toughest conference in the
country.

ANTON'S WORKâ€”Chris Dorst, goalie for Stanford's water polo team, has played well thus far this year,
thanks largely to the work of goalie coach Anton Kajlich. Kajlich invented the floating goal used by
Stanford and many other schools.
