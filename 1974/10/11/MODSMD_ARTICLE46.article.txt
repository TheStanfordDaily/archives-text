## Zetes Win Battle 
### PETE BHATIA 
The defending IM football
champion Zetes used a strong
second half passing attack to
down the Theta Delts 25-12
Thursday afternoon in one of the
most physical IM games in recent
memory.
The Zetes trailed 12-6 at the
half after the Theta Delts scored
on TD's passed from Qtrartesback
Terry Pollock to Dave Bagshaw
and Brian Farrell. The Bagshaw
TD was a 50-yard pass play.
The Zetes have been long
known as a second-half team and
they proved it again Thursday as
they struck for three second half
touchdowns while shutting out
the Theta Delt air game.
The two key Zete scores came
on a 40-yard scramble by their
quarterback Ed Snate and a
five-yard TD pitch from Snate to
John Whitlinger (of tennis fame).
The game was marked by
fierce hitting and even a couple of
fights. Terry "Monterey Jack"
Alkana and Dave "Moaner"
Sultieanu figured prominently in
the Theta Delt barrage, while the
Zetes countered strongly with
defensive back Joe Block.
Business For Co well
After the game, representatives
of both teams proceeded to
Cowell Student Health Center
where they collected a total of 10
stitches, two ace bandages and a
pair of crutches.
Zete head coach and team
owner E. Y. Snowden was pleased
with his team's performance. He
called the game a fine victory and
credited his team's hard week of
practice with the fine
come-from-behind, second half
technique.
Theta Delt head coach Nerf
Tuthill was unavailable for
comment after the game. Another
notable absence was head

cheerleader Larry Horton.
