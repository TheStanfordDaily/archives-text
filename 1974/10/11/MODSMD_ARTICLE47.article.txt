# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
Unlike Stanford's football
team, our fearful forecaster
enters the Pacific Eight season
with a good record- 12 right,
one wrong, one tie— following
a 6-1 mark last week (missing
only North western's win over
Oregon).
But league play is a
different season, and our
forecaster remains fearful,
knowing that he could be 2-2
almost as easily as 4-0.
First, we'll take Stanford
over UCLA. The Bruins have
shown the same inconsistency
that plagued Stanford during
the non-conference season, but
if both teams play as well as
they can, Stanford should
squeak by on the basis of a
better defense.
\
USC visits the dying days of
Expo '74 in Spokane when
they play Washington State
tomorrow night. It'll be cold
up there, which may slow

down the Trojans' offense, but
the Cougars won't score much
either.
We've been having great
luck picking Cat, such as last
week at Illinois. And we'll do it
again for the Oregon game.
The Ducks have the weakest
pass defense in the league, and
Cat's passing attack should
prove unstoppable.
The winner of tomorrow's
Oregon State-Washington tilt
will be tied for first place,
which, judging from the
quality of the teams, will be
the last week in which it is. At
the beginning of the season,
when the Huskies barely beat
Cincinnati, Washington looked
worse. Now the Beavers have
recouped that honor.
