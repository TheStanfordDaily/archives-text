Justice Department To Defend Nixon?
WASHINGTON The Justice Department has offered
to continue representing former President Richard M.
Nixon and his three closest advisers in civil suits pending
against them, department officials acknowledged last night.
The offer was made in letters to attorneys for Nixon,
former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell, and former
presidential advisers H. R. Haldeman and John D.
Ehrlichman, according to Kevin Maroney, deputy assistant
attorney general for the department's criminal division.
"It's normal to represent a former official who is sued
for acts when he was an official of the government,"
Maroney said.
Maroney's boss, Assistant Atty. Gen. Henry E. Petersen,
sent the letters about two weeks ago.
A similar offer was made to continue representing
William C. Sullivan, a former FBI official named a
defendant in one of the pending cases, Maroney said.
He said some of the five men have accepted the offer but
declined to say which ones.
Maroney said the offer applies to five lawsuits now at
various stages in federal courts in several cities. The
plaintiffs in the suits were Jane Fonda, the Socialists
Workers party, John Sinclair, William Lake and Elmer
Davis.
The offer was not discussed with President Ford or other
White House officials, he added.
Mayor Threatens To Halt Integration
BOSTON Mayor Kevin H. White said yesterday that
he would not cooperate with further implementation of
school integration in this racially troubled city until the
federal government provides assistance in guaranteeing the
safety of school children.
White said he would not participate in further
integration until the federal government clarifies when it
will send in federal troops and U.S. marshals and agrees to
help pay for implementing the plan.
He made his statement at a news conference on the
first day that a force of 450 riot-equipped state and
metropolitan police began patrolling the city on orders
from Massachusetts Gov. Francis W. Sargent.
White also charged that President Ford during a news
conference in Washington on Wednesday was inflaming the
situation here.
In his news conference, Ford had said he did not think
the court ordered busing program here "was the best
solution to quality education in Boston."
Wholesale Pices Rise Slowly
WASHINGTON Wholesale prices in September
advanced at the slowest rate in 11 months, providing the
Ford administration with its best economic news since
taking office.
The government's Wholesale Price Index, reported
yesterday by the Labor Department, rose an adjusted

one-tenth of a percent last month. In absolute terms,
without adjustment for seasonal influences, the index
actually declined one-tenth of a percent.
While the report was encouraging, consumers can expect
sharp increases in the cost of living over the next few
months as a result of the near record July-August wholesale
price hikes which have yet to work their way into retail.
The latest wholesale price report also could prove to be a
one-month aberration since poor weather has hurt fall' grain
harvests, which could send farm prices climbing.
Over the past three months, wholesale prices have risen
at an adjusted annual rate of 35.2 percent.
House Passes Election Reform Bill
WASHINGTON Congress completed action yesterday
on a Watergate-triggered election bill designed to reduce the
influence of special interests and control the flow of
campaign money.
The bill, sent to President Ford for his signature by a
vote of 365-24 in the House, would finance the 1976
presidential election and nominating conventions with
public funds.
It would also apply strict limits to the amount of money
candidates for president and Congress can spend, and on
the contributions individuals and organizations can make to
their campaigns.
At the White House, Press Secretary Ron Nessen said
"no final decision has been mad 6 by the President whether
he will sign it or not." /
He said Congress had removed or softened some of the
provisions which Ford had objected to and thus "improved
chances the President will sign the bill." ,
Rep. Wayne Hays (D-Ohio), House manager of the bill,
said if its spending and contribution limits had been in
effect two years ago "Watergate never would have
happened."
Mills Explains Bizarre Episode
WASHINGTON Rep. Wilbur D. Mills said yesterday he
was trying to take care of a sick friend when his face was
cut, his car was stopped for speeding, and the friend, a
woman, jumped into the Washington Tidal Basin.
Mills offered that explanation in a written statement
after three days of seclusion and silence about the bizarre
incident which occurred early Monday morning.
The 65-year-old Arkanasas congressman, chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, said he was
"embarrassed and humiliated by the entire turn of
events ..."
The Mills statement said he and his companions had "a
few refreshments" Sunday night prior to the incident.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except patches of low clouds
night and morning. Slightly warmer days. Lows today in
mid 40s to mid 50s. Highs'today and tomorrow from mid

presidential election and nominating conventions with
public funds.
It would also apply strict limits to the amount of money
candidates for president and Congress can spend, and on
the contributions individuals and organizations can make to
their campaigns.
At the White House, Press Secretary Ron Nessen said
"no final decision has been mad 6 by the President whether
he will sign it or not." /
He said Congress had removed or softened some of the
provisions which Ford had objected to and thus "improved
chances the President will sign the bill." ,
Rep. Wayne Hays (D-Ohio), House manager of the bill,
said if its spending and contribution limits had been in
effect two years ago "Watergate never would have
happened."
Mills Explains Bizarre Episode
WASHINGTON Rep. Wilbur D. Mills said yesterday he
was trying to take care of a sick friend when his face was
cut, his car was stopped for speeding, and the friend, a
woman, jumped into the Washington Tidal Basin.
Mills offered that explanation in a written statement
after three days of seclusion and silence about the bizarre
incident which occurred early Monday morning.
The 65-year-old Arkanasas congressman, chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, said he was
"embarrassed and humiliated by the entire turn of
events ..."
The Mills statement said he and his companions had "a
few refreshments" Sunday night prior to the incident.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except patches of low clouds
night and morning. Slightly warmer days. Lows today in
mid 40s to mid 50s. Highs'today and tomorrow from mid
60s to upper 70s. Light winds.
Justice Department To Defend Nixon?
WASHINGTON The Justice Department has offered
to continue representing former President Richard M.
Nixon and his three closest advisers in civil suits pending
against them, department officials acknowledged last night.
The offer was made in letters to attorneys for Nixon,
former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell, and former
presidential advisers H. R. Haldeman and John D.
Ehrlichman, according to Kevin Maroney, deputy assistant
attorney general for the department's criminal division.
"It's normal to represent a former official who is sued
for acts when he was an official of the government,"
Maroney said.
Maroney's boss, Assistant Atty. Gen. Henry E. Petersen,
sent the letters about two weeks ago.
A similar offer was made to continue representing
William C. Sullivan, a former FBI official named a
defendant in one of the pending cases, Maroney said.
He said some of the five men have accepted the offer but
declined to say which ones.
Maroney said the offer applies to five lawsuits now at
various stages in federal courts in several cities. The
plaintiffs in the suits were Jane Fonda, the Socialists
Workers party, John Sinclair, William Lake and Elmer
Davis.
The offer was not discussed with President Ford or other
White House officials, he added.
Mayor Threatens To Halt Integration
BOSTON Mayor Kevin H. White said yesterday that
he would not cooperate with further implementation of
school integration in this racially troubled city until the
federal government provides assistance in guaranteeing the
safety of school children.
White said he would not participate in further
integration until the federal government clarifies when it
will send in federal troops and U.S. marshals and agrees to
help pay for implementing the plan.
He made his statement at a news conference on the
first day that a force of 450 riot-equipped state and
metropolitan police began patrolling the city on orders
from Massachusetts Gov. Francis W. Sargent.
White also charged that President Ford during a news
conference in Washington on Wednesday was inflaming the
situation here.
In his news conference, Ford had said he did not think
the court ordered busing program here "was the best
solution to quality education in Boston."
Wholesale Pices Rise Slowly
WASHINGTON Wholesale prices in September
advanced at the slowest rate in 11 months, providing the
Ford administration with its best economic news since
taking office.
The government's Wholesale Price Index, reported
yesterday by the Labor Department, rose an adjusted

one-tenth of a percent last month. In absolute terms,
without adjustment for seasonal influences, the index
actually declined one-tenth of a percent.
While the report was encouraging, consumers can expect
sharp increases in the cost of living over the next few
months as a result of the near record July-August wholesale
price hikes which have yet to work their way into retail.
The latest wholesale price report also could prove to be a
one-month aberration since poor weather has hurt fall' grain
harvests, which could send farm prices climbing.
Over the past three months, wholesale prices have risen
at an adjusted annual rate of 35.2 percent.
House Passes Election Reform Bill
WASHINGTON Congress completed action yesterday
on a Watergate-triggered election bill designed to reduce the
influence of special interests and control the flow of

help pay for implementing the plan.
He made his statement at a news conference on the
first day that a force of 450 riot-equipped state and
metropolitan police began patrolling the city on orders
from Massachusetts Gov. Francis W. Sargent.
White also charged that President Ford during a news
conference in Washington on Wednesday was inflaming the
situation here.
In his news conference, Ford had said he did not think
the court ordered busing program here "was the best
solution to quality education in Boston."
Wholesale Pices Rise Slowly
WASHINGTON Wholesale prices in September
advanced at the slowest rate in 11 months, providing the
Ford administration with its best economic news since
taking office.
The government's Wholesale Price Index, reported
yesterday by the Labor Department, rose an adjusted

one-tenth of a percent last month. In absolute terms,
without adjustment for seasonal influences, the index
actually declined one-tenth of a percent.
While the report was encouraging, consumers can expect
sharp increases in the cost of living over the next few
months as a result of the near record July-August wholesale
price hikes which have yet to work their way into retail.
The latest wholesale price report also could prove to be a
one-month aberration since poor weather has hurt fall' grain
harvests, which could send farm prices climbing.
Over the past three months, wholesale prices have risen
at an adjusted annual rate of 35.2 percent.
House Passes Election Reform Bill
WASHINGTON Congress completed action yesterday
on a Watergate-triggered election bill designed to reduce the
influence of special interests and control the flow of
campaign money.
The bill, sent to President Ford for his signature by a
vote of 365-24 in the House, would finance the 1976
presidential election and nominating conventions with
public funds.
It would also apply strict limits to the amount of money
candidates for president and Congress can spend, and on
the contributions individuals and organizations can make to
their campaigns.
At the White House, Press Secretary Ron Nessen said
"no final decision has been mad 6 by the President whether
he will sign it or not." /
He said Congress had removed or softened some of the
provisions which Ford had objected to and thus "improved
chances the President will sign the bill." ,
Rep. Wayne Hays (D-Ohio), House manager of the bill,
said if its spending and contribution limits had been in
effect two years ago "Watergate never would have
happened."
Mills Explains Bizarre Episode
WASHINGTON Rep. Wilbur D. Mills said yesterday he
was trying to take care of a sick friend when his face was
cut, his car was stopped for speeding, and the friend, a
woman, jumped into the Washington Tidal Basin.
Mills offered that explanation in a written statement
after three days of seclusion and silence about the bizarre
incident which occurred early Monday morning.
The 65-year-old Arkanasas congressman, chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, said he was
"embarrassed and humiliated by the entire turn of
events ..."
The Mills statement said he and his companions had "a
few refreshments" Sunday night prior to the incident.

night and morning. Slightly warmer days. Lows today in

Justice Department To Defend Nixon?
WASHINGTON The Justice Department has offered
to continue representing former President Richard M.
Nixon and his three closest advisers in civil suits pending
against them, department officials acknowledged last night.
The offer was made in letters to attorneys for Nixon,
former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell, and former
presidential advisers H. R. Haldeman and John D.
Ehrlichman, according to Kevin Maroney, deputy assistant
attorney general for the department's criminal division.
"It's normal to represent a former official who is sued
for acts when he was an official of the government,"
Maroney said.
Maroney's boss, Assistant Atty. Gen. Henry E. Petersen,
sent the letters about two weeks ago.
A similar offer was made to continue representing
William C. Sullivan, a former FBI official named a
defendant in one of the pending cases, Maroney said.
He said some of the five men have accepted the offer but
declined to say which ones.
Maroney said the offer applies to five lawsuits now at
various stages in federal courts in several cities. The
plaintiffs in the suits were Jane Fonda, the Socialists
Workers party, John Sinclair, William Lake and Elmer
Davis.
The offer was not discussed with President Ford or other
White House officials, he added.
Mayor Threatens To Halt Integration
BOSTON Mayor Kevin H. White said yesterday that
he would not cooperate with further implementation of
school integration in this racially troubled city until the
federal government provides assistance in guaranteeing the
safety of school children.
White said he would not participate in further
integration until the federal government clarifies when it
will send in federal troops and U.S. marshals and agrees to
help pay for implementing the plan.
He made his statement at a news conference on the
first day that a force of 450 riot-equipped state and
