# SLAC Prof Examines U.S. Decision-Making

### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
"We have the best informed federal
government in the world... but if
you look at the technical
decision-making in the last 20 years,
the record is very poor," said Martin
Perl, professor and researcher at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).
Speaking to more than 150 people
in Tresidder Union, Perl said "we
know the top decision-maker in the
Pentagon and the White House is a
frantic decision maker."
Perl outlined the Washington
decision-making process last night in
an hour speech that replaced a
scheduled talk by SLAC Director
Wolfgang Panofsky. Panofsky
unexpectedly was called to
Washington yesterday.
Under the current technical
decision-making process there are
influences besides the scientific
community, Perl said.
Information
"The wise decision-maker receives
all the information, and then, given all
the problems of the real world, he
makes the decision," he noted.
Influences of the real world include
international and domestic politics,
federal agency pressures and economic
pressures.
In short, Perl declared that the
"scientific community has no political
power."
Often times the scientific
community which gives advice to the
government can not argue with its
decisions, Perl said.
Classified
"In military matters the advice is
often classified. In non-military
matters the advice is often kept
confidential" he said.
In addition, an engineer or scientist
who goes to Washington to help in
technological decision-making after
becomes "socialized."
"They don't want to make any
trouble ... don't want to rock the
boat on the minor issues," Perl
observed.
The scientist thinks he maintains a
stronger position in the government
which allows him to participate in "big

decisions," but that is not true either,
Perl said.
Survival
In almost all countries today, Perl
said, "the scientific community
acquiesces to the position of the
government. The scientist thinks
"science is eternal, we will survive the
government."
And this doesn't help the
decision-making process, Perl
explained.
Perl called for "prolonged and
participatory technological
decision-making" which allows for
discussion in the public eye with
special interests from all sides getting
their turn."
