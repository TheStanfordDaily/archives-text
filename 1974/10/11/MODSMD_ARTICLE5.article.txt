# 'Chappie' Plans To Resume Publication Despite Debts
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
The Chaparral, Stanford's "dead"
humor magazine, will spring to life
Monday, said Mike Dornheim, who
claims to be the publication's editor.
Dornheim told the Daily last night
he'll distribute an issue of the
magazine Monday despite a
Publications Board vote that the
Chaparral has officially "ceased to
publish."
The Publications Board has refused
to seat Dornheim or his business \
manager on the Board. Normally both
are members of the Pub Board.
At a Publications Board meeting
last week, Dornheim and Mason
Blacher, a graduate student, submitted
separate proposals to revive the
Chaparral, which was closed down this
summer when it turned out to be over
$2OOO in debt.
Rather than giving control of the
publication to either Dornheim or
Blacher, the Publications Board ruled
that the Chaparral had "ceased to
publish." That action gave the Board
control of the Chaparral office space,
but did not resolve the controversy
over who the publication's new editor
would be.

"This is one hell of a surprise," said
Frank Olivieri, ASSU financial
manager. The Chaparral is "not
supposed to be printed until the issue
is resolved," said Olivieri. "It's
unbelievable what they're doing. I'm
dumbfounded."
Dornheim, plans to distribute 1600
copies of the 16-page, BV2 by 11 inch
publication. The printing is being done
in San Francisco for a total cost of
$5O, but Dornheim refused to discuss
the financing in detail.
Dornheim said he and Jim Hu, his
business manager, had a meeting "of a
conciliatory nature" with Blacher last
night.
Several Sources
Blacher has arranged to receive
funding from several sources in the
event that he is given control of the
Chaparral.
"Nothing happened," according to
Dornheim. He said Blacher is unwilling
to jeopardize his financial position by
working with people who are
associated with the old financially
shaky Chaparral. Dornheim worked
for the Chaparral last year. "I have my
track record and they have their's,"
said Blacher. "Their proposal is not
practical in my opinion, and their
attitude towards the awesome task of
resurrecting the Chaparral is, well,
naive."
According to Olivieri, Dornheim
had the Chaparral printed in San
Francisco because the ASSU had sent
letters to all of the printing companies
in the mid-peninsula warning them not
to accept printing jobs from Stanford
publications without an ASSU
purchase order for the cost.
"I'll wait until the Pub Board
meeting to take action, but I'll
definitely take action at that time,"
Olivieri said.
"I can't foresee any problem at
all," said Dornheim when asked about
Olivieri's statements. "Since I consider
myself to be the legitimate publisher, I
don't see any problems coming up."
More Money
Dornheim admitted the Chaparral
would definitely need more money to
produce any more issues. He plans to
hold a meeting Monday night for
people interested in working with him
on the Chaparral. "If we have a larger
staff, I think the Pub Board will lend

an ear," said Dornheim.
Dornheim also mentioned that
other members of the Publications
Board, including Jon Braun, editor of
the Stanford Aliyah, were working on
clarifying t'he definition of the "cease
to publish" portion of the
Publications Board bylaws, used to
freeze action on the Chaparral.
According to Rich Jaroslovsky,
chairman of the Publications Board,
the next meeting will be held some
time before the end of October.
"I hope the Pub Board will allow
Dornheim and myself to discuss the
relative merits of our proposals," said
Blacher, "something we were unable
to do -at the last meeting, thanks to
people like Dornheim supporter Bill
Evers."

publication to either Dornheim or
Blacher, the Publications Board ruled
that the Chaparral had "ceased to
publish." That action gave the Board
control of the Chaparral office space,
but did not resolve the controversy
over who the publication's new editor
would be.

"This is one hell of a surprise," said
Frank Olivieri, ASSU financial
manager. The Chaparral is "not
supposed to be printed until the issue
is resolved," said Olivieri. "It's
unbelievable what they're doing. I'm
dumbfounded."
Dornheim, plans to distribute 1600
copies of the 16-page, BV2 by 11 inch
publication. The printing is being done
in San Francisco for a total cost of
$5O, but Dornheim refused to discuss
the financing in detail.
Dornheim said he and Jim Hu, his
business manager, had a meeting "of a
conciliatory nature" with Blacher last
night.
Several Sources
Blacher has arranged to receive
funding from several sources in the
event that he is given control of the
Chaparral.
"Nothing happened," according to
Dornheim. He said Blacher is unwilling
to jeopardize his financial position by
working with people who are
associated with the old financially
shaky Chaparral. Dornheim worked
for the Chaparral last year. "I have my
track record and they have their's,"
said Blacher. "Their proposal is not
practical in my opinion, and their
attitude towards the awesome task of
resurrecting the Chaparral is, well,
naive."
According to Olivieri, Dornheim
had the Chaparral printed in San
Francisco because the ASSU had sent
letters to all of the printing companies
in the mid-peninsula warning them not
to accept printing jobs from Stanford
publications without an ASSU
purchase order for the cost.
"I'll wait until the Pub Board
meeting to take action, but I'll
definitely take action at that time,"
Olivieri said.
"I can't foresee any problem at
all," said Dornheim when asked about
Olivieri's statements. "Since I consider
myself to be the legitimate publisher, I
don't see any problems coming up."
More Money
Dornheim admitted the Chaparral
would definitely need more money to
produce any more issues. He plans to
hold a meeting Monday night for
people interested in working with him
on the Chaparral. "If we have a larger
staff, I think the Pub Board will lend

an ear," said Dornheim.
Dornheim also mentioned that
other members of the Publications
Board, including Jon Braun, editor of
the Stanford Aliyah, were working on
clarifying t'he definition of the "cease
to publish" portion of the
Publications Board bylaws, used to
freeze action on the Chaparral.
According to Rich Jaroslovsky,
chairman of the Publications Board,
the next meeting will be held some
time before the end of October.
"I hope the Pub Board will allow
Dornheim and myself to discuss the
relative merits of our proposals," said
Blacher, "something we were unable
to do -at the last meeting, thanks to
people like Dornheim supporter Bill
Evers."
The Chaparral, Stanford's "dead"
humor magazine, will spring to life
Monday, said Mike Dornheim, who
claims to be the publication's editor.
Dornheim told the Daily last night
he'll distribute an issue of the
magazine Monday despite a
Publications Board vote that the
Chaparral has officially "ceased to
publish."
The Publications Board has refused
to seat Dornheim or his business \
manager on the Board. Normally both
are members of the Pub Board.
At a Publications Board meeting
last week, Dornheim and Mason
Blacher, a graduate student, submitted
separate proposals to revive the
Chaparral, which was closed down this
summer when it turned out to be over
$2OOO in debt.
Rather than giving control of the
publication to either Dornheim or
Blacher, the Publications Board ruled
that the Chaparral had "ceased to
