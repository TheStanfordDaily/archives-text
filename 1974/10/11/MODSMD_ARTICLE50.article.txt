# Influenza Vaccine
## 
### 
Cowell Health Center is
providing influenza vaccine every
Tuesday and Friday from 1:30 to 4
p.m. through November 1. No
other immunizations are given at
these times.
Routine vaccination is not
recommended for healthy young
students because influenza vaccine
has been variably effective and its
effects relatively short-lived.
Annual vaccination is strongly
recommended for persons of all
ages who have heart disease of any
cause, chronic lung disease, chronic
kidney disease or diabetes.
Vaccination is also recommended
for those over age 65. The vaccine
should not be taken by anyone
allergic to eggs.
