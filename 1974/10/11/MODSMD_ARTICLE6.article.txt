# City Council Mulls Possible Park Sites
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
The Palo Alto City Council voted
last night to "identify sites west of
Alma" Street for a 20-acre park and
rejected plans to "add residential land
by selectively rezoning" vacant lands
now zoned for non-residential uses.
The city's "Comprehensive Plan" had
recommended both actions.
The plan specified that the site best
located to serve the area west of Alma
Street is in the middle of the Stanford
Industrial Park on vacant land under
lease to Varian and Hewlett-Packard.
However, Councilwoman Enid
Pearson said, "Stanford is not public
land. They have the right to use their
land as they wish, and that's the way it
should be."

The "Comprehensive Plan"
suggested that vacant areas of Stanford
land, among other parcels in Palo Alto,
be rezoned for residential uses. The
council rejected that option by a 4-4
vote.
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance,
wrote the council that "we [the
University] oppose this option [of the
'Comprehensive Plan'] because four of
the parcels identified ... are owned by
the University, and the University and
its leasees have long-standing plans for
use of three of these parcels."
The fourth parcel, on Willow Road,
is already zoned for residential
housing, "a designation we would like
to retain," Augsburger said.
Syntex Corp. Vice President Frank
Koch also objected to the rezoning
option as it affected land under the
company's Stanford lease. "We have
invested $27.5 million since 1963.
That figure doesn't include the $4.5
million lease to Stanford. The option
puts our investment in jeopardy,"
Koch said.
Augsburger said the Syntex "master
plan" shows "high quality,
campus-like use of the property.
Syntex is a responsible, valuable
member of the community, and you
[the City Council] would do a great
disservice by disregarding the plans [it
has] made in good faith and in
keeping with the long established
zoning."
A spokesman for College Terrace
residents supported the plan for a city
park at the Stanford Industrial Park.
"The site could be innovative and
could provide a good lunch spot" for
the 25,000 workers there, he said.
However, Councilman Richard
Rosenbaum was "skeptical" about the
use of Stanford Industrial Park, calling
the proposed plan "very expensive"
for Palo Alto.
Vice Mayor Alan Henderson said he
did not want to "nail" Stanford for
every empty parcel of its land.
The "Comprehensive Plan"
represents a list of "impact proposals"
to decide the future development and
growth of Palo Alto.

Rosenbaum was "skeptical" about the
use of Stanford Industrial Park, calling
the proposed plan "very expensive"
for Palo Alto.
Vice Mayor Alan Henderson said he
did not want to "nail" Stanford for
every empty parcel of its land.
The "Comprehensive Plan"
represents a list of "impact proposals"
to decide the future development and
growth of Palo Alto.
The Palo Alto City Council voted
last night to "identify sites west of
Alma" Street for a 20-acre park and
rejected plans to "add residential land
by selectively rezoning" vacant lands
now zoned for non-residential uses.
The city's "Comprehensive Plan" had
recommended both actions.
The plan specified that the site best
located to serve the area west of Alma
Street is in the middle of the Stanford
Industrial Park on vacant land under
lease to Varian and Hewlett-Packard.
However, Councilwoman Enid
Pearson said, "Stanford is not public
land. They have the right to use their
land as they wish, and that's the way it
should be."

The "Comprehensive Plan"
suggested that vacant areas of Stanford
land, among other parcels in Palo Alto,
be rezoned for residential uses. The
council rejected that option by a 4-4
vote.
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance,
wrote the council that "we [the
University] oppose this option [of the
'Comprehensive Plan'] because four of
the parcels identified ... are owned by
the University, and the University and
its leasees have long-standing plans for
use of three of these parcels."
The fourth parcel, on Willow Road,
is already zoned for residential
housing, "a designation we would like
to retain," Augsburger said.
Syntex Corp. Vice President Frank
Koch also objected to the rezoning
option as it affected land under the
company's Stanford lease. "We have
invested $27.5 million since 1963.
That figure doesn't include the $4.5
million lease to Stanford. The option
puts our investment in jeopardy,"
Koch said.
Augsburger said the Syntex "master
plan" shows "high quality,
campus-like use of the property.
Syntex is a responsible, valuable
member of the community, and you
[the City Council] would do a great
disservice by disregarding the plans [it
has] made in good faith and in
keeping with the long established
zoning."
A spokesman for College Terrace
residents supported the plan for a city
park at the Stanford Industrial Park.
"The site could be innovative and
could provide a good lunch spot" for
the 25,000 workers there, he said.
