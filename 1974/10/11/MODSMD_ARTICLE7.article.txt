# Laborites Win Easily In Britain
## 
### 
LONDON (AP) Prime Minister Harold
Wilson and his Labor party held a
commanding lead and appeared
headed for victory early today in
Britain's national elections. As vote
counting adjourned, the Laborites
were only 24 seats short of an absolute
majority with 142 contests still
undecided.
Wilson claimed he could not be
beaten. His chief opponent,
Conservative party leader Edward
Heath, refused to concede defeat,
however. He said, "We battle on!"
"I now look forward to forming my
fourth administration," Wilson said
after winning an impressive victory for
his own Commons seat.
Victory Predicted
All the pre-election polls had
predicted a clear-cut victory for him.
He had been heading a minority
government since narrowly outpolling
the Conservatives in last February's
elections.
With 493 of the 635 seats in the
House of Commons decided, Labor
had won 294 of them and needed at
least 318 for the absolute majority
Wilson wanted to put through his
leftist-oriented legislation —including a
tax-the-rich program and
nationalizations of some private
industry in his plan to fight the
inflation that has brought Britain into
economic crisis.
The Conservatives had 184 seats
and the middle-of-the-road Liberal
party of Jeremy Thorpe had five.
Other parties won eight seats.
Inflation Key Issue
The election was fought on the
issue of inflation, with the question of
continued membership in the
European Common Market secondary.
Wilson, Heath and Thorpe ran only
in their own home districts, each
seeking a seat in the Commons.
Voter turnout was reported lighter
than last Feb. 28 when no party won a
majority and Wilson took over on the
strength of support from other parties.
The turnout this time was reported
at about 71 percent of the nation's 40
million voters in contrast to 78.8
percent in February.
Bomb Threats
Election day was chilly and wet in
most of Britain. Bomb scares disrupted
traffic in Balfast, Northern Ireland. An
incendiary device went off in the
office of the right-wing National Front
in Birmingham, and Liberal and Labor
headquarters in London had to deal
with bomb hoaxes.
Police warned polling stations of
possible ballot-stuffing after
intercepting alleged Irish Republican
Army plans to bolster the vote for
candidates sympathetic to the IRA.
But voting was sluggish in Northern
Ireland where strict security was in
force.
"Fight Crisis"
After his victory in the Huyton
district of Lancashire, the 58-year-old
Wilson told newsmen: "Once this
election is over we all have a job to do
to fight this economic crisis."
Other Labor party leaders who
came out winners were Wilson's
deputy, Edward Short; Barbara Castle,
and Anthony Cresland, both members
of Wilson's administration.
Heath was re-elected in his district
of Sidcup near London, polling 18,991
votes to 11,448 for his Laborite
opponent.
Thorpe, 45, also won in his district.
Other prominent Laborite victors
were Chancellor of the Exchequer
Denis Healey and Home Secretary Roy
Jenkins.

Britain's national elections. As vote
counting adjourned, the Laborites
were only 24 seats short of an absolute
majority with 142 contests still
undecided.
Wilson claimed he could not be
beaten. His chief opponent,
Conservative party leader Edward
Heath, refused to concede defeat,
however. He said, "We battle on!"
"I now look forward to forming my
fourth administration," Wilson said
after winning an impressive victory for
his own Commons seat.
Victory Predicted
All the pre-election polls had
predicted a clear-cut victory for him.
He had been heading a minority
government since narrowly outpolling
the Conservatives in last February's
elections.
With 493 of the 635 seats in the
House of Commons decided, Labor
had won 294 of them and needed at
least 318 for the absolute majority
Wilson wanted to put through his
leftist-oriented legislation —including a
tax-the-rich program and
nationalizations of some private
industry in his plan to fight the
inflation that has brought Britain into
economic crisis.
The Conservatives had 184 seats
and the middle-of-the-road Liberal
party of Jeremy Thorpe had five.
Other parties won eight seats.
Inflation Key Issue
The election was fought on the
issue of inflation, with the question of
continued membership in the
European Common Market secondary.
Wilson, Heath and Thorpe ran only
in their own home districts, each
seeking a seat in the Commons.
Voter turnout was reported lighter
than last Feb. 28 when no party won a
majority and Wilson took over on the
strength of support from other parties.
The turnout this time was reported
at about 71 percent of the nation's 40
million voters in contrast to 78.8
percent in February.
Bomb Threats
Election day was chilly and wet in
most of Britain. Bomb scares disrupted
traffic in Balfast, Northern Ireland. An
incendiary device went off in the
office of the right-wing National Front
in Birmingham, and Liberal and Labor
headquarters in London had to deal
with bomb hoaxes.
Police warned polling stations of
possible ballot-stuffing after
intercepting alleged Irish Republican
Army plans to bolster the vote for
candidates sympathetic to the IRA.
But voting was sluggish in Northern
Ireland where strict security was in
force.
"Fight Crisis"
After his victory in the Huyton
district of Lancashire, the 58-year-old
Wilson told newsmen: "Once this
election is over we all have a job to do
to fight this economic crisis."
Other Labor party leaders who
came out winners were Wilson's
deputy, Edward Short; Barbara Castle,
and Anthony Cresland, both members
of Wilson's administration.
Heath was re-elected in his district
of Sidcup near London, polling 18,991
votes to 11,448 for his Laborite
opponent.
Thorpe, 45, also won in his district.
Other prominent Laborite victors
were Chancellor of the Exchequer
Denis Healey and Home Secretary Roy
Jenkins.
LONDON (AP) Prime Minister Harold
Wilson and his Labor party held a
