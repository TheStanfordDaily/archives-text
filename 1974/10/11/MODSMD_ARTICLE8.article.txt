## Open Files 
### 
While implications of the anti-secrecy provisions of the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 boggle
the minds of many University administrators, we feel that
the new law is a good thing.
Briefly stated, the disputed provisions allow a student (or
his parents, if he is under 18) to examine all material in his
file, and challenge any "inaccurate, misleading or otherwise
inappropriate data."
That most of this material such as achievement and
psychological test data and family background information
should be open for inspection is obvious. The need for
protection clearly outweighs any advantage in keeping such
data secret.
What administrators object to, however, is that the law
also opens recommendations to the eyes of the student.
Declassification, it is argued, makes recommendations
worthless, for educators will refuse to give negative
evaluations if they know the students may see them.
And it is also possible that admissions officers will make
dangerously secretive off-the-record phone calls to
recommendation writers seeking the "real story" on a
candidate.
These arguments may have some validity, and we do not
welcome any law that might decrease the importance of one
of the few subjective criteria currently used for admission to
undergraduate and graduate programs.
We feel, however, that recommendations will still be
valid. Honest educators will not change poor evaluations
into glowing ones simply because the candidate may see the
letter.
If they do, they are violating a fundamental standard of
education: the student's right to hear honest, forthright
criticism and praise from his teachers.
The new law protects the outstanding candidate for
admission from malicious and defamatory remarks which
could immediately disqualify him.
Finally, as a general principal, we feel that agencies which
decide on a candidate's acceptability for a school, job or
loan, should make all material used in the decision-making
process available to the candidate.
Most of us agree with the law which allows people to
examine their own credit file. We think that the new law
affords the same protection to the student. We hope that
candidates for jobs such as President of the University,
groundskeeper, Daily business manager or any other
Stanford position will receive the same protection.
