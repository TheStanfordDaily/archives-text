With some surprise I read Dean
James Gibbs' statement in the
Sept. 30 Daily that the
"Stanford-in-Stanford" plan of
local residential education had not
attracted faculty backing and,
indeed, that the authors of the
plan, Mike Herman and Tom
Glenn, had committed a strategic
error by not consulting faculty
members before making a bid for
administrative support.
It is for Herman and Glenn to
wrestle with the charge of
strategic error. It is for me to
place in the record the fact that I,
as a faculty member, was
consulted by the authors and
happily gave my support to the
basic idea of their form of
residential education. It is, in
essence, a good idea, one with
definite advantages for both the
faculty and the students involved.
I cannot imagine such a
program evolving without some
real administrative headaches and
some financial burdens. So it has
always been with such proposals.
But those problems, I hoped,
would in due course be resolved
by the authors and the
appropriate administrative
officers.
After all, it would have been
presumptuous for me to speak at
any length about their solution of
those problems. By the same

token, it seems incorrect for Dean
Gibbs to make presumptions
about the attitudes of faculty
members such as myself.

I found the article by Viae
Kershner about USE's Jim Berk
(Daily, Oct. 7) offensive and
distasteful, and it showed, I think,
that the writer lacks sensitivity to
the workers of the University and
their problems. The flippant note
of the entire piece and the quote
by Don Cox indicate that the
Daily staff looks at the labor
movement at Stanford in a
superior way, as something to not
quite be taken seriously but it is
by workers.
Also, a great majority of the
very exclusive breed, "The
Stanford Graduate," will
themselves in time become
workers with the same aspirations
and needs as the workers that now
make Stanford University
function.
You may agree or disagree
about Jim's personality, but it
remains that the union under his
leadership won a contract far
beyond what most members
familiar with the problems
involved would have imagined.

(Daily, Oct. 7) offensive and
distasteful, and it showed, I think,
that the writer lacks sensitivity to
the workers of the University and
their problems. The flippant note
of the entire piece and the quote
by Don Cox indicate that the
Daily staff looks at the labor
movement at Stanford in a
superior way, as something to not
quite be taken seriously but it is
by workers.
Also, a great majority of the
very exclusive breed, "The
Stanford Graduate," will
themselves in time become
workers with the same aspirations
and needs as the workers that now
make Stanford University
function.
You may agree or disagree
about Jim's personality, but it
remains that the union under his
leadership won a contract far
beyond what most members
familiar with the problems
involved would have imagined.

With some surprise I read Dean
James Gibbs' statement in the
Sept. 30 Daily that the
"Stanford-in-Stanford" plan of
local residential education had not
attracted faculty backing and,
indeed, that the authors of the
plan, Mike Herman and Tom
Glenn, had committed a strategic
error by not consulting faculty
members before making a bid for
administrative support.
It is for Herman and Glenn to
wrestle with the charge of
strategic error. It is for me to
place in the record the fact that I,
as a faculty member, was
consulted by the authors and
happily gave my support to the
basic idea of their form of
residential education. It is, in
essence, a good idea, one with
definite advantages for both the
faculty and the students involved.
I cannot imagine such a
program evolving without some
real administrative headaches and
some financial burdens. So it has
always been with such proposals.
But those problems, I hoped,
would in due course be resolved
by the authors and the
appropriate administrative
officers.
After all, it would have been
presumptuous for me to speak at
any length about their solution of
those problems. By the same

token, it seems incorrect for Dean
Gibbs to make presumptions
about the attitudes of faculty
members such as myself.
