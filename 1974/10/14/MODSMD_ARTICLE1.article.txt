# Stanford Student's Wife Found Slain In Church
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
The wife of a Stanford student was
murdered and molested in Memorial
Church early yesterday morning.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
investigators said Arlis Perry, 19,
apparently died of a knife wound in
the back of the head. Her body was
discovered by a security guard who
was opening the church for services at
about 5:45 a.m. Sheriff's Lt. Robert
Bartoo said there are currently no
suspects in the case.
The guard, Steve Crawford of the
Stanford Police Department, told
investigators he closed and locked all
doors in the church at about 11:45
p.m. Saturday. However, he said that
when he returned to open the church
yesterday, the door on the west side of
the church was unlocked, although
there were no visible signs of forced
entry.
He found Mrs. Perry's body at the
rear of the east transept, near the altar,
of the church.
Kelly Views Body
Dean of the Chapel Robert G. H.
Kelly, contacted by police early
yesterday morning, said he viewed the
body to see if he could help identify
it.
He said the woman was lying face
-up on the floor, and was nude from
the waist down. One three-foot long
candle had been forced up her vagina,
while another was pushed up her
blouse and between her breasts.
An autopsy was performed on the
body in San Jose yesterday afternoon,
and results were expected to be
released today. These may show

whether Mrs. Perry had been raped,
whether the candle sticks were
inserted before or after she died and
whether bruise marks reportedly
found on her neck resulted from
strangulation.
Wife Of Student
Mrs. Perry was the wife of Bruce
Perry, 19, a sophomore premedical
student. They had been married in
Bismarck, N.D., less than two months
ago, and had lived in an apartment in
Quillen House, Escondido Village.
Perry said through a spokesman
that he and his wife had been walking
on campus late Saturday night, and
that they had parted ways when she
went on to the church, where they
often went both together and

separately to meditate.
At 3 a.m. and again at 6:55 a.m.,
police said, Perry called the
department to report his wife missing.
"It wasn't unusual for her to be at
church," Perry said yesterday. "It
wasn't unusual for her to be at church,
except that she was killed."
Caldles Removed
Kelly said that except for the
missing candles, the pulpit of the
church didn't appear to be in disarray.
He said the candlesticks appeared to
have been carefully removed from the
candleholders and not broken off, as if
in haste. Lt. Bartoo added that there
didn't appear to have been any violent
struggle.

CHURCH MURDER — Santa Clara County officials remove the body of Arlis Perry, discovered in Memorial Church early
yesterday. Perry, wife of Stanford sophomore Bruce Perry, had been sexually molested. The door to the church in the
background was found unlocked by the security guard who found the body at 5 a.m.
Kelly said he could draw no
conclusions as to whether the killing
had been "ritualistic." At a press
conference in San Jose, Bartoo said
the possibility that the killing had
been a sort of "black mass" ceremony
was one of several theories being
examined.
Mrs. Perry was about 5'6" tall and
110 pounds, with blonde hair. She was

wearing blue jeans, a tan short-sleeve
sweater, dark brown jacket and
sandals.
Mrs. Perry had been employed as a
receptionist at the Palo Alto law firm
of Spaeth, Blase, Valentine and Kleir.

Dean of the Chapel Robert G. H.
Kelly, contacted by police early
yesterday morning, said he viewed the
body to see if he could help identify
it.
He said the woman was lying face
-up on the floor, and was nude from
the waist down. One three-foot long
candle had been forced up her vagina,
while another was pushed up her
blouse and between her breasts.
An autopsy was performed on the
body in San Jose yesterday afternoon,
and results were expected to be
released today. These may show

whether Mrs. Perry had been raped,
whether the candle sticks were
inserted before or after she died and
whether bruise marks reportedly
found on her neck resulted from
strangulation.
Wife Of Student
Mrs. Perry was the wife of Bruce
Perry, 19, a sophomore premedical
student. They had been married in
Bismarck, N.D., less than two months
ago, and had lived in an apartment in
Quillen House, Escondido Village.
Perry said through a spokesman
that he and his wife had been walking
on campus late Saturday night, and
that they had parted ways when she
went on to the church, where they
often went both together and

separately to meditate.
At 3 a.m. and again at 6:55 a.m.,
police said, Perry called the
department to report his wife missing.
"It wasn't unusual for her to be at
church," Perry said yesterday. "It
wasn't unusual for her to be at church,
except that she was killed."
Caldles Removed
Kelly said that except for the
missing candles, the pulpit of the
church didn't appear to be in disarray.
He said the candlesticks appeared to
have been carefully removed from the
candleholders and not broken off, as if
in haste. Lt. Bartoo added that there
didn't appear to have been any violent
struggle.

CHURCH MURDER — Santa Clara County officials remove the body of Arlis Perry, discovered in Memorial Church early
yesterday. Perry, wife of Stanford sophomore Bruce Perry, had been sexually molested. The door to the church in the
background was found unlocked by the security guard who found the body at 5 a.m.
Kelly said he could draw no
conclusions as to whether the killing
had been "ritualistic." At a press
conference in San Jose, Bartoo said
the possibility that the killing had
been a sort of "black mass" ceremony
was one of several theories being
examined.
Mrs. Perry was about 5'6" tall and
110 pounds, with blonde hair. She was

wearing blue jeans, a tan short-sleeve
sweater, dark brown jacket and
sandals.
Mrs. Perry had been employed as a
receptionist at the Palo Alto law firm
of Spaeth, Blase, Valentine and Kleir.

While police searched for clues
inside the church this morning, Dean
Kelly held services outside, where a
baby was baptized.
The wife of a Stanford student was
murdered and molested in Memorial
Church early yesterday morning.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
investigators said Arlis Perry, 19,
apparently died of a knife wound in
the back of the head. Her body was
discovered by a security guard who
was opening the church for services at
about 5:45 a.m. Sheriff's Lt. Robert
Bartoo said there are currently no
suspects in the case.
The guard, Steve Crawford of the
Stanford Police Department, told
investigators he closed and locked all
doors in the church at about 11:45
p.m. Saturday. However, he said that
when he returned to open the church
yesterday, the door on the west side of
the church was unlocked, although
there were no visible signs of forced
entry.
He found Mrs. Perry's body at the
rear of the east transept, near the altar,
of the church.
