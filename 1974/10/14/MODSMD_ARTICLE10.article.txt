# Athletic Programs Benefit University
## 
### Jim Wascher 
Last Friday, Live Oak paraphrased
Economics Prof. Ronald I. McKinnon as
saying the "University should not fritter
away money or managerial talent on
tangential projects like intercollegiate
athletics." Whom is McKinnon trying to kid?
Had McKinnon (or the Live Oak reporter)
bothered to do even the most basic kind of
research, he would have found that the
Department of Physical Education and
Athletics is virtually self-sufficient, receiving
University funding only for such projects as
intramurals and faculty and staff recreation.
"No University money at all goes to
intercollegiate athletics here," according to
Assoc. Athletic Director Robert G. Young.
And the general funds that do go to IM's and
other projects simply don't cover the cost of
these activities.
Young says "the difference between what
the University gives us and what these
programs cost is made up with intercollegiate
athletic money."
Money Well Spent
I really don't think this can be called
frittering away money. And the deeper I
looked into the matter, the less I could
believe that McKinnon had even a
rudimentary knowledge of what he was
talking about.
It seems that the Athletic Department is

one of two divisions within the University
which pays its own utility bills, maintains its
own buildings and facilities and pays its own
personnel without any financial assistance
from the University. Not even the Economics
Department has managed to do that.
Farther down in the Live Oak article,
McKinnon appears to hedge his hastily
offered opinion. No longer wailing about
wasted money, he merely says that he
doesn't think "the University mines the
sports program for revenues."
Money Offers
The truth is that the University doesn't
need to "mine" the sports program at all. In
fact, the Athletic Department freely offers
some of its money to the University from
time to time.
For example, the success of the football
program in the mid-1980s attracted so much
gift money to the Athletic Department that
it used part of its surplus to fully fund the
construction of Branner Hall. What other
University department has ever built a
dormitory for the students?
What's more, University officials believe
that the traditional quality of intercollegiate
athletic teams here has produced a significant
number of unrestricted donations to the
University.

General Secretary Daryl H. Pearson says
the intercollegiate sports program "very
definitely increases the flow of unrestricted
money to the University." While citing the
impossibility of quantifying sports' impact
on gift giving, Pearson points out that it is
"another means of maintaining people's
interest in the University and getting them to
learn more about it."
National Attention
Athletic Director Joseph H. Ruetz,
himself a former fundraiser for the
University, points out that the national
attention Stanford's athletic teams receive
provides an added impetus to fundraising.
"Just try having our Economics
Department debate UCLA's in the Coliseum
and see what kind of crowd they draw,"
Ruetz suggests.
Finally, Live Oak spoke of McKinnon
blandly asserting that "the intercollegiate
sports program is a drag upon the educational
activities of the University." Few would deny
that most P.E. classes are far from strenuous,
academically speaking, but that doesn't
necessarily mean that intercollegiate athletes
don't learn anything of value from their
participation in the program.

University department has ever built a
dormitory for the students?
What's more, University officials believe
that the traditional quality of intercollegiate
athletic teams here has produced a significant
number of unrestricted donations to the
University.

General Secretary Daryl H. Pearson says
the intercollegiate sports program "very
definitely increases the flow of unrestricted
money to the University." While citing the
impossibility of quantifying sports' impact
on gift giving, Pearson points out that it is
"another means of maintaining people's
interest in the University and getting them to
learn more about it."
National Attention
Athletic Director Joseph H. Ruetz,
himself a former fundraiser for the
University, points out that the national
attention Stanford's athletic teams receive
provides an added impetus to fundraising.
"Just try having our Economics
Department debate UCLA's in the Coliseum
and see what kind of crowd they draw,"
Ruetz suggests.
Finally, Live Oak spoke of McKinnon
blandly asserting that "the intercollegiate
sports program is a drag upon the educational
activities of the University." Few would deny
that most P.E. classes are far from strenuous,
academically speaking, but that doesn't
necessarily mean that intercollegiate athletes
don't learn anything of value from their
participation in the program.

Last Friday, Live Oak paraphrased
Economics Prof. Ronald I. McKinnon as
saying the "University should not fritter
away money or managerial talent on
tangential projects like intercollegiate
athletics." Whom is McKinnon trying to kid?
Had McKinnon (or the Live Oak reporter)
bothered to do even the most basic kind of
research, he would have found that the
Department of Physical Education and
Athletics is virtually self-sufficient, receiving
University funding only for such projects as
intramurals and faculty and staff recreation.
"No University money at all goes to
intercollegiate athletics here," according to
Assoc. Athletic Director Robert G. Young.
And the general funds that do go to IM's and
other projects simply don't cover the cost of
these activities.
Young says "the difference between what
the University gives us and what these
programs cost is made up with intercollegiate
athletic money."
Money Well Spent
I really don't think this can be called
frittering away money. And the deeper I
looked into the matter, the less I could
believe that McKinnon had even a
rudimentary knowledge of what he was
talking about.
It seems that the Athletic Department is

one of two divisions within the University
which pays its own utility bills, maintains its
own buildings and facilities and pays its own
personnel without any financial assistance
from the University. Not even the Economics
Department has managed to do that.
Farther down in the Live Oak article,
McKinnon appears to hedge his hastily
offered opinion. No longer wailing about
wasted money, he merely says that he
doesn't think "the University mines the
sports program for revenues."
Money Offers
The truth is that the University doesn't
need to "mine" the sports program at all. In
fact, the Athletic Department freely offers
some of its money to the University from
time to time.
For example, the success of the football
program in the mid-1980s attracted so much
gift money to the Athletic Department that
it used part of its surplus to fully fund the
construction of Branner Hall. What other
University department has ever built a
dormitory for the students?
