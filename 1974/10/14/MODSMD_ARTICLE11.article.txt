# Tours Program
## 
### France XXIX 
Who would throw away the
opportunity to live and study in
the midst of a beautiful French
city on the Loire River?
As the current group at the
Stanford Overseas Center in
Tours, we have become most
concerned about the possible
closing of this campus. The
problem lies in the fact that
Stanford University is losing
$20,000 this quarter due to
under-enrollment there are
twenty-eight students living in a
facility designed to accomodate
eighty. We feel that, in part, the
reason for the lack of
participation is that this campus
has been grossly under-rated at
the Stanford campus in Palo Alto.
Actually, this campus has
many unique advantages, in terms
6f its academic program and its
location. We can recommend the
teaching and administrative staff
at Tours as being extremely
well-qualified in their respective
fields, as well as sympathetic to
the needs of American students in
France. The classes are designed
not only to acquaint us with the
French language, but with the
French culture, literature, and
way of life as well. We also have
the option of taking courses at the
University of Tours, which is
adjacent to our campus. The
academic program is oriented to
students with varied levels of
proficiency in the French
language. As a matter of fact,
there is no longer a language
requirement for acceptance into
the program.
Tours is located only 150 miles
from Paris, yet has the advantage
of being a smaller city. The
French spoken here is known as
being the purest in the country,
another factor making Tours
much more accurately
representative of France. The
Center is located in the middle of
the chateaux and wine-producing
region, one of the most beautiful
areas in all of France.
We are enthusiastic enough
about this campus to recommend
it highly to other students. We
strongly feel that it would be an
unfortunate mistake and a loss to
the University to close down this
campus. Hopefully we have been
able to generate some interest in
the Stanford Campus at Tours.

able to generate some interest in
the Stanford Campus at Tours.
