# Farm Workers Struggle For Basic Liberties
## 
### Chris Coleman 
As yet another harvest season
enters its last month in the grape
fields of California, the now
familiar cries of "Viva la Huelga!"
and "Viva la Causa!" continue to
spread across the supermarkets of
North America. For over
one hundred years, beginning with
the starved and powerless
American Indians as the first farm
labor force, farmworkers have
been struggling to escape from the
bonds of poverty and exploitation
in order to enjoy the same rights
and benefits of other Americans.
At last, farmworkers have a
tangible, concrete means to end
their sweatshop working
conditions coupled with
insufficient wages. They have
organized a union, the United
Farm Workers of America, and are
now striving to obtain contracts
from the growers. As expected,
they have met stiff opposition
these multi-millionaires. Time and
again, the growers, with their
puppet politicians, security
guards, labor contractors and
money have used violence, racism
and the recruiting of scab labor
from other groups of poor people
principally from Mexico in
attempts to quell union activities.
Boycott
But the workers continue to
fight, and in response, have taken
the issue to the cities of America
in the form of a boycott on table
grapes, non-union head lettuce,
and all Gallo, Franzia and Guild
wines. The consumers of America
now have the chance to use their
economic pressure to obtain
justice and dignity for the people
that put the food on their tables.
In what is essentially a civil
rights movement, farmworkers
have been trying to secure, first,
free secret-ballot elections to
determine which union, if any,
they want to represent them. The
growers, in collusion with the
International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, oppose any such
elections.
In addition to the right to
choose their own union,
farmworkers are also fighting for:
the elimination of prejudicial
and irregular hiring procedures as

currently practiced by labor
contractors;
decent wages (under the
National Labor Relations Act of
1947, minimum wages were first
established for all laborers except
field workers);
decent housing in place of
labor camps;
an adequate medical plan
(the infant mortality rate among
migrant workers is 125 percent
higher than the national average;
the accident rate is 300 percent
higher; the life expectancy for
migrants is 49 years);
the enforcement of a
"waiting period" before workers
are allowed to enter the fields
after pesticide spraying;
the end to the abuses of
child labor (one out of every four
farmworkers is a child under 16

years of age). None of these needs
are adequately fulfilled by
Teamster contracts.
Grape Strike
Over twenty years ago, Cesar
Chavez began organizing
farmworkers to fulfill these
dreams. There have been many
strikes and boycotts since those
first brave huelgistas of the United
Farm Workers called a grape strike
in 1965 in Delano, Calif. Today,
despite the countless attempts by
growers and the Teamsters to
destroy this union, the United
Farm Workers continue to use
nonviolent, democratic means in
demanding economic justice for
field laborers. They have, as in the
successful boycott of 1969-70,
taken their cause to the
consumers of America. They are
asking every American to raise his

or her social conscience by not
buying products from growers
who remain rich while ignoring
the welfare of those who do their
work.
And, the workers show no
signs of giving up. In fact, strikes
are spreading to other crops. For
example, in just this past summer,
workers have gone on strike and
asked for U.F.W. representation in
the lemon fields of Arizona, in the
cotton fields of Georgia, in the
tomato fields of the
Sacramento-San Joaquin valleys,
and even in the mushroom plant
at nearby Morgan Hill.
Restless Workers
These workers have been
waiting for over a hundred years
for their share of America. All
across the fields of this country,
they continue to grow restless and

are now asking, "When is Cesar
coming?".
This historical movement is
more than just a struggle for
better wages. It is a struggle for
dignity and respect. Moreover, it
is clearly related to many of
America's foremost problems:
racism, poverty, environmental
pollution, and urban crowding
and decay. Let us not prolong the
wait of a people who have
experienced far too much agony
and poverty for one lifetime. And,
as Cesar Chavez has said, "History
is on our side... We have no
alternative but victory."
May the farmworkers of
America one day sing "De
Colores" amidst the laughter and
joy of their children.

signs of giving up. In fact, strikes
are spreading to other crops. For
example, in just this past summer,
workers have gone on strike and
asked for U.F.W. representation in
the lemon fields of Arizona, in the
cotton fields of Georgia, in the
tomato fields of the
Sacramento-San Joaquin valleys,
and even in the mushroom plant
at nearby Morgan Hill.
Restless Workers
These workers have been
waiting for over a hundred years
for their share of America. All
across the fields of this country,
they continue to grow restless and

are now asking, "When is Cesar
coming?".
This historical movement is
more than just a struggle for
better wages. It is a struggle for
dignity and respect. Moreover, it
is clearly related to many of
America's foremost problems:
racism, poverty, environmental
pollution, and urban crowding
and decay. Let us not prolong the
wait of a people who have
experienced far too much agony
and poverty for one lifetime. And,
as Cesar Chavez has said, "History
is on our side... We have no
alternative but victory."
May the farmworkers of
America one day sing "De
Colores" amidst the laughter and
joy of their children.
(Chris Coleman is an
undergraduate.)
As yet another harvest season
enters its last month in the grape
fields of California, the now
familiar cries of "Viva la Huelga!"
and "Viva la Causa!" continue to
spread across the supermarkets of
North America. For over
one hundred years, beginning with
the starved and powerless
American Indians as the first farm
labor force, farmworkers have
been struggling to escape from the
bonds of poverty and exploitation
in order to enjoy the same rights
and benefits of other Americans.
At last, farmworkers have a
tangible, concrete means to end
their sweatshop working
conditions coupled with
insufficient wages. They have
organized a union, the United
Farm Workers of America, and are
now striving to obtain contracts
from the growers. As expected,
they have met stiff opposition
these multi-millionaires. Time and
again, the growers, with their
puppet politicians, security
guards, labor contractors and
money have used violence, racism
and the recruiting of scab labor
from other groups of poor people
principally from Mexico in
attempts to quell union activities.
Boycott
But the workers continue to
fight, and in response, have taken
the issue to the cities of America
in the form of a boycott on table
grapes, non-union head lettuce,
and all Gallo, Franzia and Guild
wines. The consumers of America
now have the chance to use their
economic pressure to obtain
justice and dignity for the people
that put the food on their tables.
In what is essentially a civil
rights movement, farmworkers
have been trying to secure, first,
free secret-ballot elections to
determine which union, if any,
they want to represent them. The
growers, in collusion with the
International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, oppose any such
elections.
In addition to the right to
choose their own union,
farmworkers are also fighting for:
the elimination of prejudicial
and irregular hiring procedures as

currently practiced by labor
contractors;
decent wages (under the
National Labor Relations Act of
1947, minimum wages were first
established for all laborers except
field workers);
decent housing in place of
labor camps;
an adequate medical plan
(the infant mortality rate among
migrant workers is 125 percent
higher than the national average;
the accident rate is 300 percent
higher; the life expectancy for
migrants is 49 years);
the enforcement of a
"waiting period" before workers
are allowed to enter the fields
after pesticide spraying;
the end to the abuses of
child labor (one out of every four
farmworkers is a child under 16

years of age). None of these needs
are adequately fulfilled by
Teamster contracts.
Grape Strike
Over twenty years ago, Cesar
Chavez began organizing
farmworkers to fulfill these
dreams. There have been many
strikes and boycotts since those
first brave huelgistas of the United
Farm Workers called a grape strike
in 1965 in Delano, Calif. Today,
despite the countless attempts by
growers and the Teamsters to
destroy this union, the United
Farm Workers continue to use
nonviolent, democratic means in
demanding economic justice for
field laborers. They have, as in the
successful boycott of 1969-70,
taken their cause to the
consumers of America. They are
asking every American to raise his

or her social conscience by not
buying products from growers
who remain rich while ignoring
the welfare of those who do their
work.
And, the workers show no
signs of giving up. In fact, strikes
are spreading to other crops. For

the accident rate is 300 percent
higher; the life expectancy for
migrants is 49 years);
the enforcement of a
"waiting period" before workers
are allowed to enter the fields
after pesticide spraying;
the end to the abuses of
child labor (one out of every four
farmworkers is a child under 16

years of age). None of these needs
are adequately fulfilled by
Teamster contracts.
Grape Strike
Over twenty years ago, Cesar
Chavez began organizing
farmworkers to fulfill these
dreams. There have been many
strikes and boycotts since those
first brave huelgistas of the United
Farm Workers called a grape strike
in 1965 in Delano, Calif. Today,
despite the countless attempts by
growers and the Teamsters to
destroy this union, the United
Farm Workers continue to use
nonviolent, democratic means in
demanding economic justice for
field laborers. They have, as in the
successful boycott of 1969-70,
taken their cause to the
consumers of America. They are
asking every American to raise his

or her social conscience by not
buying products from growers
who remain rich while ignoring
the welfare of those who do their
work.
And, the workers show no
signs of giving up. In fact, strikes
are spreading to other crops. For
example, in just this past summer,
workers have gone on strike and
asked for U.F.W. representation in
the lemon fields of Arizona, in the
cotton fields of Georgia, in the
tomato fields of the
Sacramento-San Joaquin valleys,
and even in the mushroom plant
at nearby Morgan Hill.
Restless Workers
These workers have been
waiting for over a hundred years
for their share of America. All
across the fields of this country,
they continue to grow restless and

are now asking, "When is Cesar
coming?".
This historical movement is
more than just a struggle for
better wages. It is a struggle for
dignity and respect. Moreover, it
is clearly related to many of
America's foremost problems:
racism, poverty, environmental
pollution, and urban crowding
and decay. Let us not prolong the
wait of a people who have
experienced far too much agony
and poverty for one lifetime. And,
as Cesar Chavez has said, "History
is on our side... We have no
alternative but victory."
May the farmworkers of
America one day sing "De
Colores" amidst the laughter and
joy of their children.

As yet another harvest season
enters its last month in the grape
fields of California, the now
familiar cries of "Viva la Huelga!"
and "Viva la Causa!" continue to
spread across the supermarkets of
North America. For over
one hundred years, beginning with
the starved and powerless
American Indians as the first farm
labor force, farmworkers have
been struggling to escape from the
bonds of poverty and exploitation
in order to enjoy the same rights
and benefits of other Americans.
At last, farmworkers have a
tangible, concrete means to end
their sweatshop working
conditions coupled with
insufficient wages. They have
organized a union, the United
Farm Workers of America, and are
now striving to obtain contracts
from the growers. As expected,
they have met stiff opposition
these multi-millionaires. Time and
again, the growers, with their
puppet politicians, security
guards, labor contractors and
money have used violence, racism
and the recruiting of scab labor
from other groups of poor people
principally from Mexico in
attempts to quell union activities.
Boycott
But the workers continue to
fight, and in response, have taken
the issue to the cities of America
in the form of a boycott on table
grapes, non-union head lettuce,
and all Gallo, Franzia and Guild
wines. The consumers of America
now have the chance to use their
economic pressure to obtain
justice and dignity for the people
that put the food on their tables.
In what is essentially a civil
rights movement, farmworkers
have been trying to secure, first,
free secret-ballot elections to
determine which union, if any,
they want to represent them. The
growers, in collusion with the
International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, oppose any such
elections.
In addition to the right to
choose their own union,
farmworkers are also fighting for:
the elimination of prejudicial
and irregular hiring procedures as

currently practiced by labor
contractors;
decent wages (under the
National Labor Relations Act of
1947, minimum wages were first
established for all laborers except
field workers);
decent housing in place of
labor camps;
an adequate medical plan
(the infant mortality rate among
migrant workers is 125 percent
higher than the national average;
the accident rate is 300 percent
higher; the life expectancy for
migrants is 49 years);
the enforcement of a
"waiting period" before workers
are allowed to enter the fields
after pesticide spraying;
the end to the abuses of
child labor (one out of every four
farmworkers is a child under 16

years of age). None of these needs
are adequately fulfilled by
