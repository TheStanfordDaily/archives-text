# UC Board of Regents Needs Reform
## 
### Robert Bacon 
SACRAMENTO Help the University of
California? Who, me?
Yes, you. The Stanford community will
have an opportunity to help improve "that
other University" by voting YES on
Proposition 4 at the November 5 general
election.
Proposition 4 will make several major
changes in the structure of the Regents, the
governing board of UC. Since UC belongs to
all the people of California even those who
attend, "work at, or have graduated from
Stanford these changes require approval of
a state Constitutional amendment by the
voters.
Proposition 4 will shorten the terms of
Regents from 16 to 12 years, increase the
number of Regents appointed from the
general public, permit the selection of one
student and one faculty member as Regents
and establish an advisory committee to assist
future governors in selecting Regents.
The UC Regents are sadly in need of
reform. UC suffers because Regents terms
are unduly long, because the Regents are not
representative of the state's population as a
whole or of the "consumers" of UC
education, and because there are too many
politicians on the Board.
The present 16-year terms mean that the

two Regents appointed this past spring will
still be on the Board in 1990, when today's
preschoolers will make up the undergraduate
student body. Twelve-year terms may still
seem long (Stanford trustees serve for 10
years), but they are a decided improvement.
Proposition 4 will also change the
schedule of appointments. A governor will
not name any Regents during the first year
after being elected, unless a Regent dies or
resigns in mid-term.
This will reduce the temptation to reward
key campaign supporters with a seat on the
Board regardless of their qualifications. For
example, Governor Reagan's first appointee
to the Regents was H.R. Haldeman.
Proposition 4 would also add the
Vice-President of the Alumni Association to
the Regents. This would increase to two the
number of Regents chosen by the alumni.
This is a far cry from the eight Stanford
trustees elected by the alumni, but an
improvement.
It would also permit the Regents to
include, for one-year terms, a faculty
member of UC or another university, and a
UC student. While admittedly it is difficult
for one person to adequately represent either
of these large and diverse groups, they
presently have no official spokesman among

the Regents.
The fact that most of the appointive
Regents are conservative, wealthy white men
over 50, is due in large part to the
appointment policies of the incumbent
governor.
But if Proposition 4 passes, it would be
more difficult for any future governor to
make such homogeneous appointments.
Future governors would be required to
consult with an advisory committee including
state legislators, an alumnus, a faculty
member, a student and members of the
general public, before nominating Regents.
Prop. 4, while not imposing a quota
system, states that "Regents shall be able
persons broadly reflective of the economic,
cultural and social diversity of the state,
including ethnic minorities and women."
Proposition 4 won't change the Regents
overnight; it won't make them a perfect
governing board, something with which no
university has ever been blessed.
What it will do is make the Regents more
representative of the 21 million Californians
who are UC's "owners." It will also give UC's
students, faculty and alumni a greater voice
in the operation of their institution.
