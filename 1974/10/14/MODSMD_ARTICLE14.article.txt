## At Ecology Action-Syntex Corporation Gardens Organic Methods Quadruple Crop Yields 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
An author with a B.A. in political science
from Yale, a professional systems analyst and
former business manager for Stanford's
libraries: these are the attributes of a
backyard vegetable gardener named John
Jeavons.

But Jeavons, a soft-spoken, full-bearded
man, isn't your run-of-the-mill gardener. He
grows vegetables with less energy, water and
fertilizer than the average American farmer
and produces at least four times the crop.
How does he do it? With the
Bio-dynamic/French Intensive Method of

Organic Horticulture which combines raised
vegetable beds, continuous growth methods
and close and companion planting to create
some astonishing results.
Ecology Action
Jeavons' garden isn't behind his house. The
land he tills is part of three and 3/4 acres
behind Syntex Corporation in the Stanford
Industrial Park. Syntex provided the land to
Ecology Action, a non-profit Palo Alto
organization, at no cost along with all the
water the plants can drink. The reason— to
study the French Intensive farming, and allow
people in the area to learn its techniques.
Jeavons is on the Ecology Action Board of
Directors and is in charge of this project.
Already more than 150 people have staked
out 100 square foot plots on the property.
Their incentive? Well, it's free, and Ecology
Action provides the tools, the water and the
instruction.
But there's more than that. It's a chance to
grow 200 to 500 pounds of fruits and
vegetables a year for yourself and all you do is
the gardening.
Free Fertilizer
You might have to buy some fertilizer, but
if you go to some horse stable, as Jeavons
suggests, you can pick that up free too.
It's hot and sunny on this knoll behind the
University, and Jeavons is giving a tour of the
garden to some interested people. First he
takes them to the research section.
Square patches of zuchini,' squash,
cucumbers, strawberries and other vegetables
grow in the raised beds ... all flourishing.
Fantastic Yield
"When we first started farming here,"
Jeavons says casually, "after the first six
months we were producing 5.5 times the
national average for zuchini. Now, two years
later, we are producing 13 to 15 times the
amount and it's still going up.
Hmmm ... sprouting some aphids here."
Jeavons bends down and lifts up the
underside of a French cabbage leaf. The
tourists peer down in earnest.
"In our second year here," Jeavons tells

the group, "we were producing seven times
the national average for green beans."
Strawberries, Beans
But facts and figures are not the only
things Jeavons tells his eager pupils. There are
family secrets: strawberries and green beans
produce better when grown together; onions
stunt the growth of green beans; dwarf
marigolds, parsley, and borage plants help
fight insects in tomato beds.
Perhaps the hardest and most important
step in this method of farming, Jeavons says,
is preparation of the raised beds.
"Unless you are lucky enough to have
loose soil, proparing a raised bed takes a lot of
work—as much as 6 to 12 hours for a 100
square foot bed," Jeavons says.
The double-digging which produces raised
beds requires turning the soil at least a foot
deep, he adds.
Chamomile Tea
Jeavons hands his students chamomile
flowers to smell, and tells them they make a
wonderful tea. He gives them red flowers from
pineapple sage that smells like pineapple.
In his brown corderoys, his shirt with
Indian designs sewn on in colorful thread, and
his dirty brown moccasins, Jeavons doesn't
look like a board of directors member, or a
former University administrator for that
matter. But Jeavons has not left the real
world.
"About five million people will die of
starvation next year," he states flatly. "We
seem to think that because things have been
groovy in the past, that they will be groovy
tomorrow. That's not true."
World Problem
Jeavons warns that the shortage of fruits
and vegetables is going to become an
"outrageous" problem, and that unless new
methods of farming are developed, farmers
won't be able to keep up with the
skyrocketing population.
Jeavons notes that with all the research
America's agri-businesses are doing, they only
increase their production by about 1 percent a
year. In the first year, Jeavons says food
production on the Syntex property shot up at

least 100 percent.
The garden land is not the most arable
either—just alkaline clay dug up from the
foundation of the Syntex building. But by
adding water, pot ash and wood ash and horse
manure to the soil the farmers increased the
nutriment content.
'No Money'
When asked why U.S. agri-businesses don't
study this farming method, Jeavons says, "It
could be they won't make as much money.
No pesticides, no machinery, no chemicals,
not a lot they can control. Nothing they can
make money on, just food."
But apparently, lots of money can be made
on the food. Although American farmers
make $3-4,000 per acre a year, John estimates
they could make $3O-40,000 per acre with
French Intensive methods.
John says he still has three to five years of .
research to do, and maybe in that time, things
will get so bad the agriculture business will
start looking at the new techniques.
Winning Wheat
"We don't have the figures on grains yet,"
he notes. "We grew some wheat, but haven't
had time to analyze the protein content. I
suspect we'll get twice the average yield and
maybe a.lot more."
In the meantime, there are poeple on the
mid-peninsula to teach, and maybe they will
spread the word. To help, Jeavons has written
a simple book "How To Grow More
Vegetables Than You Ever Thought Possible
On Less Land Than You Can Imagine."
Jeavons' lecture is over, and everyone
returns to his office, a six-foot high metal tool
shed. Already five or six people from the
group are signing up for a plot of land. Maybe
these businessman, housewives and students
will be the farmers of the future, producing
their own fruits and vegetables in backyard
plots.
The sun is setting, but it's still hot. A dog
lies asleep in the shade of the shed. From the
hillside, you can see Hoover Tower,
supposedly a symbol of all that learning going c
on at the University. What's going on here
seems just as important if not more so.

look like a board of directors member, or a
former University administrator for that
matter. But Jeavons has not left the real
world.
"About five million people will die of
starvation next year," he states flatly. "We
seem to think that because things have been
groovy in the past, that they will be groovy
tomorrow. That's not true."
World Problem
Jeavons warns that the shortage of fruits
and vegetables is going to become an
"outrageous" problem, and that unless new
methods of farming are developed, farmers
won't be able to keep up with the
skyrocketing population.
Jeavons notes that with all the research
America's agri-businesses are doing, they only
increase their production by about 1 percent a
year. In the first year, Jeavons says food
production on the Syntex property shot up at

least 100 percent.
The garden land is not the most arable
either—just alkaline clay dug up from the
foundation of the Syntex building. But by
adding water, pot ash and wood ash and horse
manure to the soil the farmers increased the
nutriment content.
'No Money'
When asked why U.S. agri-businesses don't
study this farming method, Jeavons says, "It
could be they won't make as much money.
No pesticides, no machinery, no chemicals,
not a lot they can control. Nothing they can
make money on, just food."
But apparently, lots of money can be made
on the food. Although American farmers
make $3-4,000 per acre a year, John estimates
they could make $3O-40,000 per acre with
French Intensive methods.
John says he still has three to five years of .
research to do, and maybe in that time, things
will get so bad the agriculture business will
start looking at the new techniques.
Winning Wheat
"We don't have the figures on grains yet,"
he notes. "We grew some wheat, but haven't
had time to analyze the protein content. I
suspect we'll get twice the average yield and
maybe a.lot more."
In the meantime, there are poeple on the
mid-peninsula to teach, and maybe they will
spread the word. To help, Jeavons has written
a simple book "How To Grow More
Vegetables Than You Ever Thought Possible
On Less Land Than You Can Imagine."
Jeavons' lecture is over, and everyone
returns to his office, a six-foot high metal tool
shed. Already five or six people from the
group are signing up for a plot of land. Maybe
these businessman, housewives and students
will be the farmers of the future, producing
their own fruits and vegetables in backyard
plots.
The sun is setting, but it's still hot. A dog
lies asleep in the shade of the shed. From the
hillside, you can see Hoover Tower,
supposedly a symbol of all that learning going c
on at the University. What's going on here
seems just as important if not more so.

Action garden at Syntex Corporation on Page

pounds of vegetables a year to grow on 100
square feet of soil.
An author with a B.A. in political science
from Yale, a professional systems analyst and
former business manager for Stanford's
libraries: these are the attributes of a
backyard vegetable gardener named John
Jeavons.

But Jeavons, a soft-spoken, full-bearded
man, isn't your run-of-the-mill gardener. He
grows vegetables with less energy, water and
fertilizer than the average American farmer
and produces at least four times the crop.
How does he do it? With the
Bio-dynamic/French Intensive Method of

Organic Horticulture which combines raised
vegetable beds, continuous growth methods
and close and companion planting to create
some astonishing results.
Ecology Action
Jeavons' garden isn't behind his house. The
land he tills is part of three and 3/4 acres
behind Syntex Corporation in the Stanford
Industrial Park. Syntex provided the land to
Ecology Action, a non-profit Palo Alto
organization, at no cost along with all the
water the plants can drink. The reason— to
study the French Intensive farming, and allow
people in the area to learn its techniques.
Jeavons is on the Ecology Action Board of
Directors and is in charge of this project.
Already more than 150 people have staked
out 100 square foot plots on the property.
Their incentive? Well, it's free, and Ecology
Action provides the tools, the water and the
instruction.
But there's more than that. It's a chance to
grow 200 to 500 pounds of fruits and
vegetables a year for yourself and all you do is
the gardening.
Free Fertilizer
You might have to buy some fertilizer, but
if you go to some horse stable, as Jeavons
suggests, you can pick that up free too.
It's hot and sunny on this knoll behind the
University, and Jeavons is giving a tour of the
garden to some interested people. First he
takes them to the research section.
Square patches of zuchini,' squash,
cucumbers, strawberries and other vegetables
grow in the raised beds ... all flourishing.
Fantastic Yield
"When we first started farming here,"
Jeavons says casually, "after the first six
months we were producing 5.5 times the
national average for zuchini. Now, two years
later, we are producing 13 to 15 times the
amount and it's still going up.
Hmmm ... sprouting some aphids here."
Jeavons bends down and lifts up the
underside of a French cabbage leaf. The
tourists peer down in earnest.
"In our second year here," Jeavons tells

the group, "we were producing seven times
the national average for green beans."
Strawberries, Beans
But facts and figures are not the only
things Jeavons tells his eager pupils. There are
family secrets: strawberries and green beans
produce better when grown together; onions
stunt the growth of green beans; dwarf
marigolds, parsley, and borage plants help
fight insects in tomato beds.
Perhaps the hardest and most important
step in this method of farming, Jeavons says,
is preparation of the raised beds.
"Unless you are lucky enough to have
loose soil, proparing a raised bed takes a lot of
work—as much as 6 to 12 hours for a 100
square foot bed," Jeavons says.
The double-digging which produces raised
beds requires turning the soil at least a foot
deep, he adds.
Chamomile Tea
Jeavons hands his students chamomile
flowers to smell, and tells them they make a
wonderful tea. He gives them red flowers from
pineapple sage that smells like pineapple.
In his brown corderoys, his shirt with
Indian designs sewn on in colorful thread, and
his dirty brown moccasins, Jeavons doesn't
look like a board of directors member, or a
former University administrator for that
matter. But Jeavons has not left the real

grows vegetables with less energy, water and
fertilizer than the average American farmer
and produces at least four times the crop.
How does he do it? With the
Bio-dynamic/French Intensive Method of

Organic Horticulture which combines raised
vegetable beds, continuous growth methods
and close and companion planting to create
some astonishing results.
Ecology Action
Jeavons' garden isn't behind his house. The
land he tills is part of three and 3/4 acres
behind Syntex Corporation in the Stanford
Industrial Park. Syntex provided the land to
Ecology Action, a non-profit Palo Alto
organization, at no cost along with all the
water the plants can drink. The reason— to
study the French Intensive farming, and allow
people in the area to learn its techniques.
Jeavons is on the Ecology Action Board of
Directors and is in charge of this project.
Already more than 150 people have staked
out 100 square foot plots on the property.
Their incentive? Well, it's free, and Ecology
Action provides the tools, the water and the
instruction.
But there's more than that. It's a chance to
grow 200 to 500 pounds of fruits and
vegetables a year for yourself and all you do is
the gardening.
Free Fertilizer
You might have to buy some fertilizer, but
if you go to some horse stable, as Jeavons
suggests, you can pick that up free too.
It's hot and sunny on this knoll behind the
University, and Jeavons is giving a tour of the
garden to some interested people. First he
takes them to the research section.
Square patches of zuchini,' squash,
cucumbers, strawberries and other vegetables
grow in the raised beds ... all flourishing.
Fantastic Yield
"When we first started farming here,"
Jeavons says casually, "after the first six
months we were producing 5.5 times the
national average for zuchini. Now, two years
later, we are producing 13 to 15 times the
amount and it's still going up.
Hmmm ... sprouting some aphids here."
Jeavons bends down and lifts up the
underside of a French cabbage leaf. The
tourists peer down in earnest.
"In our second year here," Jeavons tells

the group, "we were producing seven times
the national average for green beans."
Strawberries, Beans
But facts and figures are not the only
things Jeavons tells his eager pupils. There are
family secrets: strawberries and green beans
produce better when grown together; onions
stunt the growth of green beans; dwarf
marigolds, parsley, and borage plants help
fight insects in tomato beds.
Perhaps the hardest and most important
step in this method of farming, Jeavons says,
is preparation of the raised beds.
"Unless you are lucky enough to have
loose soil, proparing a raised bed takes a lot of
work—as much as 6 to 12 hours for a 100
square foot bed," Jeavons says.
The double-digging which produces raised
beds requires turning the soil at least a foot
deep, he adds.
Chamomile Tea
Jeavons hands his students chamomile
flowers to smell, and tells them they make a
wonderful tea. He gives them red flowers from
pineapple sage that smells like pineapple.
In his brown corderoys, his shirt with
Indian designs sewn on in colorful thread, and
his dirty brown moccasins, Jeavons doesn't
look like a board of directors member, or a
former University administrator for that
matter. But Jeavons has not left the real
world.
"About five million people will die of
starvation next year," he states flatly. "We
seem to think that because things have been
groovy in the past, that they will be groovy
tomorrow. That's not true."
World Problem
Jeavons warns that the shortage of fruits
and vegetables is going to become an
"outrageous" problem, and that unless new
methods of farming are developed, farmers
won't be able to keep up with the
skyrocketing population.
Jeavons notes that with all the research
America's agri-businesses are doing, they only
increase their production by about 1 percent a
year. In the first year, Jeavons says food
production on the Syntex property shot up at

least 100 percent.
The garden land is not the most arable
either—just alkaline clay dug up from the
foundation of the Syntex building. But by
adding water, pot ash and wood ash and horse
manure to the soil the farmers increased the
nutriment content.
'No Money'
When asked why U.S. agri-businesses don't
study this farming method, Jeavons says, "It
could be they won't make as much money.
No pesticides, no machinery, no chemicals,
not a lot they can control. Nothing they can
make money on, just food."
But apparently, lots of money can be made
on the food. Although American farmers
make $3-4,000 per acre a year, John estimates
they could make $3O-40,000 per acre with
French Intensive methods.
John says he still has three to five years of .
research to do, and maybe in that time, things
will get so bad the agriculture business will
start looking at the new techniques.
Winning Wheat
"We don't have the figures on grains yet,"
he notes. "We grew some wheat, but haven't
had time to analyze the protein content. I
suspect we'll get twice the average yield and
maybe a.lot more."
In the meantime, there are poeple on the
mid-peninsula to teach, and maybe they will
spread the word. To help, Jeavons has written
a simple book "How To Grow More
Vegetables Than You Ever Thought Possible
On Less Land Than You Can Imagine."
Jeavons' lecture is over, and everyone
returns to his office, a six-foot high metal tool
shed. Already five or six people from the
group are signing up for a plot of land. Maybe
these businessman, housewives and students
will be the farmers of the future, producing
their own fruits and vegetables in backyard
plots.
The sun is setting, but it's still hot. A dog
lies asleep in the shade of the shed. From the
hillside, you can see Hoover Tower,
supposedly a symbol of all that learning going c
on at the University. What's going on here
seems just as important if not more so.

tomorrow. That's not true."
World Problem
Jeavons warns that the shortage of fruits
and vegetables is going to become an
"outrageous" problem, and that unless new
methods of farming are developed, farmers
won't be able to keep up with the
skyrocketing population.
Jeavons notes that with all the research
America's agri-businesses are doing, they only
increase their production by about 1 percent a
year. In the first year, Jeavons says food
production on the Syntex property shot up at

least 100 percent.
The garden land is not the most arable
either—just alkaline clay dug up from the
foundation of the Syntex building. But by
adding water, pot ash and wood ash and horse
manure to the soil the farmers increased the
nutriment content.
'No Money'
When asked why U.S. agri-businesses don't
study this farming method, Jeavons says, "It
could be they won't make as much money.
No pesticides, no machinery, no chemicals,
not a lot they can control. Nothing they can
make money on, just food."
But apparently, lots of money can be made
on the food. Although American farmers
make $3-4,000 per acre a year, John estimates
they could make $3O-40,000 per acre with
French Intensive methods.
John says he still has three to five years of .
research to do, and maybe in that time, things
will get so bad the agriculture business will
start looking at the new techniques.
Winning Wheat
"We don't have the figures on grains yet,"
he notes. "We grew some wheat, but haven't
had time to analyze the protein content. I
suspect we'll get twice the average yield and
maybe a.lot more."
In the meantime, there are poeple on the
mid-peninsula to teach, and maybe they will
spread the word. To help, Jeavons has written
a simple book "How To Grow More
Vegetables Than You Ever Thought Possible
On Less Land Than You Can Imagine."
Jeavons' lecture is over, and everyone
returns to his office, a six-foot high metal tool
shed. Already five or six people from the
group are signing up for a plot of land. Maybe
these businessman, housewives and students
will be the farmers of the future, producing
their own fruits and vegetables in backyard
plots.
The sun is setting, but it's still hot. A dog
lies asleep in the shade of the shed. From the
hillside, you can see Hoover Tower,
supposedly a symbol of all that learning going c
on at the University. What's going on here
seems just as important if not more so.

An author with a B.A. in political science
from Yale, a professional systems analyst and
former business manager for Stanford's
libraries: these are the attributes of a
backyard vegetable gardener named John
Jeavons.

But Jeavons, a soft-spoken, full-bearded
man, isn't your run-of-the-mill gardener. He
grows vegetables with less energy, water and
fertilizer than the average American farmer
and produces at least four times the crop.
How does he do it? With the
Bio-dynamic/French Intensive Method of

Organic Horticulture which combines raised
vegetable beds, continuous growth methods
and close and companion planting to create
some astonishing results.
Ecology Action
Jeavons' garden isn't behind his house. The
land he tills is part of three and 3/4 acres
behind Syntex Corporation in the Stanford
Industrial Park. Syntex provided the land to
Ecology Action, a non-profit Palo Alto
organization, at no cost along with all the
water the plants can drink. The reason— to
study the French Intensive farming, and allow
people in the area to learn its techniques.
Jeavons is on the Ecology Action Board of
Directors and is in charge of this project.
Already more than 150 people have staked
out 100 square foot plots on the property.
Their incentive? Well, it's free, and Ecology
Action provides the tools, the water and the
instruction.
But there's more than that. It's a chance to
grow 200 to 500 pounds of fruits and
vegetables a year for yourself and all you do is
the gardening.
Free Fertilizer
You might have to buy some fertilizer, but
if you go to some horse stable, as Jeavons
suggests, you can pick that up free too.
It's hot and sunny on this knoll behind the
University, and Jeavons is giving a tour of the
garden to some interested people. First he
takes them to the research section.
Square patches of zuchini,' squash,
cucumbers, strawberries and other vegetables
grow in the raised beds ... all flourishing.
Fantastic Yield
"When we first started farming here,"
Jeavons says casually, "after the first six
months we were producing 5.5 times the
national average for zuchini. Now, two years
later, we are producing 13 to 15 times the
amount and it's still going up.
Hmmm ... sprouting some aphids here."
Jeavons bends down and lifts up the
underside of a French cabbage leaf. The
tourists peer down in earnest.
"In our second year here," Jeavons tells

the group, "we were producing seven times
the national average for green beans."
Strawberries, Beans
But facts and figures are not the only
things Jeavons tells his eager pupils. There are
family secrets: strawberries and green beans
produce better when grown together; onions
stunt the growth of green beans; dwarf
marigolds, parsley, and borage plants help
fight insects in tomato beds.
Perhaps the hardest and most important
step in this method of farming, Jeavons says,
is preparation of the raised beds.
"Unless you are lucky enough to have
loose soil, proparing a raised bed takes a lot of
work—as much as 6 to 12 hours for a 100
square foot bed," Jeavons says.
The double-digging which produces raised
beds requires turning the soil at least a foot
deep, he adds.
Chamomile Tea
Jeavons hands his students chamomile
flowers to smell, and tells them they make a
wonderful tea. He gives them red flowers from
pineapple sage that smells like pineapple.
In his brown corderoys, his shirt with
Indian designs sewn on in colorful thread, and
his dirty brown moccasins, Jeavons doesn't
look like a board of directors member, or a
former University administrator for that
matter. But Jeavons has not left the real
world.
"About five million people will die of
starvation next year," he states flatly. "We
seem to think that because things have been
groovy in the past, that they will be groovy
tomorrow. That's not true."
