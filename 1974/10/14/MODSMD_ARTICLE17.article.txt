# Pac-8 Roundup
## Amazing California Keeps Rolling Along 
### 
Vince Ferragamo must be
wondering who up there hates
him. The ex-Cal quarterback
became fed up with Cal's futility
and its de-emphasis on football
last year and transferred to
Nebraska, where a loss is grounds
for a day of mourning.
So while the fifth-ranked
Cornhuskers were being upset by
Missouri Saturday, Cal won its
fourth consecutive game,
annihilating Oregon, 41-10.
The victory gave the Bears the
best record in the Pac-8 (4-1) and
avenged last year's loss to Oregon
by the almost identical score of
41-10.
Running back Chuck Muncie
led the Bears, rushing for 126
yards in 20 carries. The versatile
junior stole the show by running
46 yards for the touchdown,
throwing a 10-yard TD pass and
catching an 11-yard scoring toss.
Steve Bartkowski, the Pacific
Eight's leading passer, completed
10-17 passes for 183 yards,
including a 70-yard TD bomb to
sprinter Wesley Walker.
Oregon's Rick Kane, a
sophomore running back from
Pleasanton, gained 138 yards on
18 carries. So much for Duck
highlights.
Poor Washington State. The
last two weeks the Cougars have
faced top-ranked Ohio State and
seventh-ranked USC and have
responded with losses of 42-7 and
54-7, respectfully. After holding
Ohio State's Archie Griffin to 196
yards two Saturdays ago, WSU
had to contend with SC's
Anthony Davis, who gained 189
yards in little more than two
quarters of play.
In winning its 15th straight
Pac-8 game, USC rolled up 485
yards, 462 on the ground, in total
offense. Third-string fullback
Ricky Bell was the game's second
leading rusher with 77 yards on
just three carries. Fifty-nine of
those yards came on a
fourth-quarter TD run.
Quarterback Pat Haden found it
necessary to throw only nine
times, completing two to J.K.
McKay.
Washington State finally scored
in the last period behind
third-string quarterback John
Hopkins (no, he's not a university
in Maryland). Hopkins threw an
eight-yard TD pass to Carl
Barschig to conclude an 80-yard
drive in which Hopkins completed
eight of nine passes.
USC's record against
Washington State now stands at
31-4-4.
In a game considered
something less than crucial to the
"Run for the Roses," Oregon
State scored 17 points in the
fourth quarter to defeat
Washington, 23-9, in Corvallis.
The win was the Beavers' first of
the year and gives Washington the
privilege, at - least for now, of
being the worst team in the Pac-8.
The Beavers scored the decisive
touchdown after Washington gave
up the ball on fourth down at
Oregon State's 41 yard line with
three minutes to go. Critical runs
of 10 and 22 yards by Ray Taroli
highlighted the 59-yard drive
which resulted in Dick Maurer's
two-yard TD dive with 1:06 left
in the game.

13 of 28 passes for 126 yards and rushing for 72 yards on 13 carries. Linebacker Gordy Riegel, who made 14 unassisted tackles and assisted on
five others, was named defensive player of the game.

Washington State finally scored
in the last period behind
third-string quarterback John
Hopkins (no, he's not a university
in Maryland). Hopkins threw an
eight-yard TD pass to Carl
Barschig to conclude an 80-yard
drive in which Hopkins completed
eight of nine passes.
USC's record against
Washington State now stands at
31-4-4.
In a game considered
something less than crucial to the
"Run for the Roses," Oregon
State scored 17 points in the
fourth quarter to defeat
Washington, 23-9, in Corvallis.
The win was the Beavers' first of
the year and gives Washington the
privilege, at - least for now, of
being the worst team in the Pac-8.
The Beavers scored the decisive
touchdown after Washington gave
up the ball on fourth down at
Oregon State's 41 yard line with
three minutes to go. Critical runs
of 10 and 22 yards by Ray Taroli
highlighted the 59-yard drive
which resulted in Dick Maurer's
two-yard TD dive with 1:06 left
in the game.

10 yoo OF THE GAME — Stanford quarterback Mike Cordova (16) was elected offensive player of the game Saturday night after completing
13 of 28 passes for 126 yards and rushing for 72 yards on 13 carries. Linebacker Gordy Riegel, who made 14 unassisted tackles and assisted on
five others, was named defensive player of the game.
Vince Ferragamo must be
wondering who up there hates
him. The ex-Cal quarterback
became fed up with Cal's futility
and its de-emphasis on football
last year and transferred to
Nebraska, where a loss is grounds
for a day of mourning.
So while the fifth-ranked
Cornhuskers were being upset by
Missouri Saturday, Cal won its
fourth consecutive game,
annihilating Oregon, 41-10.
The victory gave the Bears the
best record in the Pac-8 (4-1) and
avenged last year's loss to Oregon
by the almost identical score of
41-10.
Running back Chuck Muncie
led the Bears, rushing for 126
yards in 20 carries. The versatile
junior stole the show by running
46 yards for the touchdown,
throwing a 10-yard TD pass and
catching an 11-yard scoring toss.
Steve Bartkowski, the Pacific
Eight's leading passer, completed
10-17 passes for 183 yards,
including a 70-yard TD bomb to
sprinter Wesley Walker.
Oregon's Rick Kane, a
sophomore running back from
Pleasanton, gained 138 yards on
18 carries. So much for Duck
highlights.
Poor Washington State. The
last two weeks the Cougars have
faced top-ranked Ohio State and
seventh-ranked USC and have
responded with losses of 42-7 and
54-7, respectfully. After holding
Ohio State's Archie Griffin to 196
yards two Saturdays ago, WSU
had to contend with SC's
Anthony Davis, who gained 189
yards in little more than two
quarters of play.
In winning its 15th straight
Pac-8 game, USC rolled up 485
yards, 462 on the ground, in total
offense. Third-string fullback
Ricky Bell was the game's second
leading rusher with 77 yards on
just three carries. Fifty-nine of
those yards came on a
fourth-quarter TD run.
Quarterback Pat Haden found it
necessary to throw only nine
times, completing two to J.K.
McKay.
