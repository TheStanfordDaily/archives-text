## Cards Come From Ahead, Tie UCLA 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
LOS ANGELES It happened
again.
It's beginning to look like
whatever mysterious demon
which possessed the miracle
Oakland Raiders a few years back
has reversed all its spells and put
them on the Stanford Cardinals,
who stand 0-3-2.
This time it was at UCLA
Saturday night, when, for the
fifth time in five games, Stanford
came-from-ahead to not win. It
took a last-second field goal for
the Bruins, who looked flat most
of the game, to gain a 13-13 tie in
the conference opener.
It looked like a win, the one
which would springboard
Stanford into serious contention
for the league crown. Stanford
held a 13-10 lead and the ball
with time running out in the
fourth quarter.
The Cardinal drive hit a snag
with fourth and one on the UCLA
22, and less than three minutes to
play. Eschewing the field goal, the
Cards gambled on making a first
down that would clinch it right
there.
Bad Luck
Quarterback Mike Cordova,
who'd run well all night, took the
ball on his hip and slipped for a
loss of one. <4 You do that in
L.A.," coach Jack Christiansen
said after the game, giving a shrug
that meant "what can you do
when you're unlucky?"
So it was UCLA's ball. The
Bruins frittered away a minute or
so, then zoomed downfield on a
28-yard run by Wendell Tyler
through the Stanford line. A pass
from John Sciarra to Raymond
Burks gave UCLA the ball on the
Stanford 14.
Meanswhile, the Bruins did
everything possible to run out of
time. Somehow, they either lost a
time out or their coaches couldn't
count.
Anyway, the clock ran down as
Sciarra hurriedly tried to line his
team up and throw one out of
bounds. Sciarra finally
succeeded— with one second left.
Some Stanford fans will argue
that he never did throw it out
before the game ended, but.. .
At The Gun
Brett White, an inconsistent
Bruin kicker, comes in and—of
course— boots a 37-yard field goal
which makes it 13-13 at the gun.
Of course, just to tie in the
Coliseum—where the Cards have
lost nine of the last 11 decisions
shows that the team played a
pretty good football game.
Stanford had taken a lead on
two first half touchdowns. The
first TD was a 13 play, 78 yard
march where everything called
seemed to work. Unfortunately,
Mike Langford missed the point
after touchdown so it was only
6-0. One could blame Langford
for the tie, but it would be unfair,
since the extra point
would have completely changed
UCLA's strategy.
Aerial Show
After UCLA regained the lead,
9-6, Stanford came back with a
display of Guy Genjamin's passing

prowess. Benjamin came in the
game after Cordova was shaken up
in the second quarter. Aided by a
pass interference, Benjamin led
the team to a quick touchdown,
hitting six of seven aerials.
Next series, Cordova was in
again. "He's our starter and unless
he's hurt or playing badly I'm
going to play him," Chris said.
Cordova didn't play badly. He
hit 13 of 28 oasses. gained 72
yards rushing, wasn't intercepted,
didn't fumble, didn't do anything
stupid. In fact, he was voted
offensive player of the game,
though fans of Tyler howled at
the selection.
But still, it's a fact that
Stanford did not score another
point. The offense moved the ball,
but was unable to score in the
second half.
Defense Tough
Meanwhile, the defense
allowed yards, but not points.
After a shaky start, the unit dug
in and stopped every Bruin drive.
The secondary covered well, the
line and linebackers, while not
pursuing fast enough to stop
UCLA's numerous sweeps, made
the big plays.
One big play came early in the
fourth quarter, when Gordy
Riegel conked Sciarra out of the
game for awhile by an admittedly
rough, but clean, tackle.
Sciarra's replacement, Jeff
Dankworth, couldn't move the
club and the Bruins, on that drive,
were stymied.
Riegel played like a wild man,
getting 14 unassisted tackles. He
was voted defensive player of the
game, an honor he also won last
year in the Coliseum for his play
during the 27-26 loss to USC.
All in all, as Sciarra said,
"Stanford's probably the best
winless team in the country."
The week, the team will have
to figure out why.

Cardinal Notes: UCLA's crowd
of 45,937 was one of the deadest
congregations ever seen ... On
the Stanford side, the cheerleaders
continued to have their problems
rousing support, which led to a
third quarter tirade about how the
fans were harming their team.
An observer said, "I object to
giving someone license to scream
at the audience. Before Saturday
night I simply didn't want the
cheerleaders in. Now I want them
out."
The Los Angeles Coliseum does
not allow women in its press box,
but Sports Information Director
Gary Cavalli made sure his
assistant, Nancy Peterson, got
inside.
Stanford's rushing game netted
176 yards, by far the best
performance of the year.
Cordova's scrambles boosted the
totals, but Scott Laidlaw was the
leading ground gainer, getting 74
yards for an average of 4.1 .
What effect will this all have on
the Rose Bowl? Well, in the
unlikely event that both teams
win the rest of their games, UCLA
would probably go to Pasadena on
the basis of a better
non-conference record.

THE WHOLE STORY The Los Angeles Coliseum scoreboard looked good to Cardinal fans at this point
Saturday night, but all UCLA needed was that one fateful second to spoil Stanford's upset hopes.
