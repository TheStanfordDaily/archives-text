# Title IX Interpretation
## Frats Seek Legal Advice 
### BONNY RODDEN 
A legal assistant will advise the
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
whether or not it should
counsel to provide advice on the
proposed regulations to Title IX of the
Federal Education Admendments Act
of 1972, IFC President Michael
Nilsson said yesterday.
Nilsson remarked that the national
organization of Theta Delta Chi will
send Gus Felice, former Theta Delt
national officer, to an inter-fraternity
alumni council meeting tonight.
Felice emphasized he is merely
advising the council.
"At this time I'm not ready to be
termed legal counsel for the
Inter-Fraternity Council," Felice
commented. However, he did say, "If
it looks like it is serious enough, I'd be
interested in working on the case."
Not A Lawyer
Felice mentioned he is not a lawyer
because he has not received the results
from the state law board examinations
he took after graduating from law
school this year.
If the council decides to employ a
certified legal counsel, IFC Vice
President Steve Hansen said he would
expect the lawyer to advise the council
on possible ways the proposed
regulations could be changed.
However, the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)
will not accept, written comments on
the regulations after tomorrow.
Hansen said the lawyer should also
review existing laws which might
possibly counteract University
lawyers' interpretation of Title IX.
Present System Illegal
Title IX declares that an institution
cannot receive federal funds if it
contributes to an organization which
chooses its membership on the basis of
sex.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry N. Horton, the
present University housing system is

illegal because men in fraternities are
exempt from the draw but no woman
has the same privilege.
Under one of the proposals for an
alternative housing system, fraternities
would be brought into the draw. Many
fraternity members fear the adoption
of this proposal would destroy their
concept of fraternities.
Alternative Systems
A number of fraternity members
have proposed alternative systems to

Horton. Hansen said he would expect
the lawyer to determine the legal
feasibility of these proposals.
If the legal counsel considers one of
the proposals legal, Hansen said he
hopes that lawyer could "convince the
University lawyers that our proposals
satisfy the regulations."
Hansen also said the lawyer would
investigate past legal action pertaining
to the fraternity which University
lawyers consider irrelevant.
He mentioned that a study by the
national organization of the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity noted that the federal
Higher Education Act of 1965 could
protect fraternities and sororities from
inclusion under the provisions of Title
IX.
However, the University lawyers
—Jim Siena, Iris Brest and George
Gregory—said they have never heard of
this interpretation of the act.

Retaining legal counsel is not the
only step the fraternities have taken to
fight the University interpretation of
Title IX. A council of seven fraternity
members has been organized to
compile members' proposals for a new
housing system.
Also, University oficials and
fraternity members are drafting
together a letter which will inform
fraternity alumni of the housing
system dilemna.
