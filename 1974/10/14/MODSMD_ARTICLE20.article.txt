# On Monday Morning
## The 						Coliseum Cobra 
### Tim Ferguson 
LOS ANGELES—Personally, I like watching football in the
Coliseum. The neighborhood isn't the greatest and driving is a hassle,
but once inside the forboding concrete bowl, the feeling is pure
"big-time."
My only problem with the place is that I usually depart with my
heart in my throat and tears in my eyes. My favorites usually lose in
this enclave, usually in the final seconds. And usually they're the
Stanford Cardinals.
I hear lore of some veneipous cobra in the Coliseum which recoils
to strike with the cruelty of fate against helpless Stanford. "I don't
know whether we're snakebitten in the Coliseum or official bitten or
what," a stoic Jack Christiansen said Saturday night. On reflection, I
can find only the "or what" plausible.
I was more of a Dennis Dummit-UCLA fan when first I saw
Stanford in L.A. in 1969. But watching Jim Plunkett rally his Indians
in a seesaw struggle with the favored USC Trojans was enough to
convert me.
My joy was unbridled when Steve Horowitz booted a 37-yard field
goal with 1:'03 remaining to put the Indians ahead, 24-23.
John Ralston and his crew were pretty confident they were going
to get their first win over hated SC since 1958. But the Trojans had a
quarterback named Jimmy Jones, who, for all his foibles, had a knack
for last-minute heroics. He did this night, hitting receivers on clutch
passes during a tense final march.
With his team devoid of time-outs and the final second ticking off
the clock, Ron Ayala kicked a 34-yard field goal over the west post,
exactly as Chris Limahelu would do with three seconds left four years
later.
Many Stanford players collpased on the field in shock before
sadness enveloped them. This was snakebite No. 1 and they weren't
ready for it. I blamed "luck."
But a funny thing happened in the Rose Bowl-decider against
UCLA a year later. Poise speared the cobra.
Dummit rallied the Bruins, suffering from an equally painful Rose
Bowl drought, to a 7-6 fourth quarter lead. But Plunkett and
Horowitz were not rattled. Stanford marched dramatically up the
field a 30-yard winning field goal.
Mike Simone clenched a rose in his teeth amid the locker room
jumble. His Thunderchickens had proved their mettle, and would
again Jan. 1 against Ohio State. They were masters of their fate.
Rain pounded the Coliseum in 1971, but was nothing compared to
the pounding Stanford would apply to USC. The snake was forced

into hiding when Don Bunce and
company zoomed to a 33-10 lead
before a last-minute USC
touchdown.
The humiliation was a rare one
for the Trojans, and caustic
comments by Stanford players
afterward would earn the lasting
enmity of John McKay—to the
tune of "2000 points" a year
later.
The Cardinals were all but out
of the Rose Bowl race when they
faced UCLA in 1972.
Coliseum observers called the
game one of the wildest ever
there, one that just couldn't end
when the Cards took a 23-21
fourth quarter lead. Instead, Mark
Harmon performed another
miracle, and UCLA scored a
touchdown as time ran out to
keep the Bruins' Rose hopes alive.
Once again, the snakebite. Or
last-minute befuddlement on
defense, which occurred again in
the Coliseum last fall.
A ridiculous 26-point underdog
to USC, Stanford shocked 63,806
fans with diminutive Rod Garcia's
powerful toe. Leading 26-17 with
3:10 remaining, the Cards ate the
big one again.
Pat Haden found a new
receiver, tight end Jim
Obradovich, who found the
sideline to save precious . time.
And Lynn Swann drew a 42-yard
interference call against Jim
Kaffen. After a touchdown, the
Trojans were set up for a
33-second march to the
Limahelu clincher.
Shock again. The snake again?
I suspect poise might have more
to do with it.
How is poise instilled in a
young football team? That's one
for Jack Christiansen—l don't
know Let's hope somebody finds
out before Nov. 9, when that
cobra's likely to visit its favorite
victim once again.

LOS ANGELES—Personally, I like watching football in the
Coliseum. The neighborhood isn't the greatest and driving is a hassle,
but once inside the forboding concrete bowl, the feeling is pure
"big-time."
My only problem with the place is that I usually depart with my
heart in my throat and tears in my eyes. My favorites usually lose in
this enclave, usually in the final seconds. And usually they're the
Stanford Cardinals.
I hear lore of some veneipous cobra in the Coliseum which recoils
to strike with the cruelty of fate against helpless Stanford. "I don't
know whether we're snakebitten in the Coliseum or official bitten or
what," a stoic Jack Christiansen said Saturday night. On reflection, I
can find only the "or what" plausible.
I was more of a Dennis Dummit-UCLA fan when first I saw
Stanford in L.A. in 1969. But watching Jim Plunkett rally his Indians
in a seesaw struggle with the favored USC Trojans was enough to
convert me.
My joy was unbridled when Steve Horowitz booted a 37-yard field
goal with 1:'03 remaining to put the Indians ahead, 24-23.
John Ralston and his crew were pretty confident they were going
to get their first win over hated SC since 1958. But the Trojans had a
quarterback named Jimmy Jones, who, for all his foibles, had a knack
for last-minute heroics. He did this night, hitting receivers on clutch
passes during a tense final march.
With his team devoid of time-outs and the final second ticking off
the clock, Ron Ayala kicked a 34-yard field goal over the west post,
exactly as Chris Limahelu would do with three seconds left four years
later.
Many Stanford players collpased on the field in shock before
sadness enveloped them. This was snakebite No. 1 and they weren't
ready for it. I blamed "luck."
But a funny thing happened in the Rose Bowl-decider against
UCLA a year later. Poise speared the cobra.
Dummit rallied the Bruins, suffering from an equally painful Rose
Bowl drought, to a 7-6 fourth quarter lead. But Plunkett and
Horowitz were not rattled. Stanford marched dramatically up the
field a 30-yard winning field goal.
Mike Simone clenched a rose in his teeth amid the locker room
jumble. His Thunderchickens had proved their mettle, and would
again Jan. 1 against Ohio State. They were masters of their fate.
Rain pounded the Coliseum in 1971, but was nothing compared to
the pounding Stanford would apply to USC. The snake was forced

into hiding when Don Bunce and
company zoomed to a 33-10 lead
before a last-minute USC
touchdown.
The humiliation was a rare one
for the Trojans, and caustic
comments by Stanford players
afterward would earn the lasting
enmity of John McKay—to the
tune of "2000 points" a year
later.
The Cardinals were all but out
of the Rose Bowl race when they
faced UCLA in 1972.
Coliseum observers called the
game one of the wildest ever
there, one that just couldn't end
when the Cards took a 23-21
fourth quarter lead. Instead, Mark
Harmon performed another
miracle, and UCLA scored a
touchdown as time ran out to
keep the Bruins' Rose hopes alive.
Once again, the snakebite. Or
last-minute befuddlement on
defense, which occurred again in
the Coliseum last fall.
A ridiculous 26-point underdog
to USC, Stanford shocked 63,806
fans with diminutive Rod Garcia's
powerful toe. Leading 26-17 with
3:10 remaining, the Cards ate the
big one again.

Obradovich, who found the

My only problem with the place is that I usually depart with my
heart in my throat and tears in my eyes. My favorites usually lose in
this enclave, usually in the final seconds. And usually they're the
Stanford Cardinals.
I hear lore of some veneipous cobra in the Coliseum which recoils
to strike with the cruelty of fate against helpless Stanford. "I don't
know whether we're snakebitten in the Coliseum or official bitten or
what," a stoic Jack Christiansen said Saturday night. On reflection, I
can find only the "or what" plausible.
I was more of a Dennis Dummit-UCLA fan when first I saw
Stanford in L.A. in 1969. But watching Jim Plunkett rally his Indians
in a seesaw struggle with the favored USC Trojans was enough to
convert me.
My joy was unbridled when Steve Horowitz booted a 37-yard field
goal with 1:'03 remaining to put the Indians ahead, 24-23.
John Ralston and his crew were pretty confident they were going
to get their first win over hated SC since 1958. But the Trojans had a
quarterback named Jimmy Jones, who, for all his foibles, had a knack
for last-minute heroics. He did this night, hitting receivers on clutch
passes during a tense final march.
With his team devoid of time-outs and the final second ticking off
the clock, Ron Ayala kicked a 34-yard field goal over the west post,
exactly as Chris Limahelu would do with three seconds left four years
later.
Many Stanford players collpased on the field in shock before
sadness enveloped them. This was snakebite No. 1 and they weren't
ready for it. I blamed "luck."
But a funny thing happened in the Rose Bowl-decider against
UCLA a year later. Poise speared the cobra.
Dummit rallied the Bruins, suffering from an equally painful Rose
Bowl drought, to a 7-6 fourth quarter lead. But Plunkett and
Horowitz were not rattled. Stanford marched dramatically up the
field a 30-yard winning field goal.
Mike Simone clenched a rose in his teeth amid the locker room
jumble. His Thunderchickens had proved their mettle, and would
again Jan. 1 against Ohio State. They were masters of their fate.
Rain pounded the Coliseum in 1971, but was nothing compared to
the pounding Stanford would apply to USC. The snake was forced

into hiding when Don Bunce and
company zoomed to a 33-10 lead
before a last-minute USC
touchdown.
The humiliation was a rare one
for the Trojans, and caustic
comments by Stanford players
afterward would earn the lasting
enmity of John McKay—to the
tune of "2000 points" a year
later.
The Cardinals were all but out
of the Rose Bowl race when they
faced UCLA in 1972.
Coliseum observers called the
game one of the wildest ever
there, one that just couldn't end
when the Cards took a 23-21
fourth quarter lead. Instead, Mark
Harmon performed another
miracle, and UCLA scored a
touchdown as time ran out to
keep the Bruins' Rose hopes alive.
Once again, the snakebite. Or
last-minute befuddlement on
defense, which occurred again in
the Coliseum last fall.
A ridiculous 26-point underdog
to USC, Stanford shocked 63,806
fans with diminutive Rod Garcia's
powerful toe. Leading 26-17 with
3:10 remaining, the Cards ate the
big one again.
Pat Haden found a new
receiver, tight end Jim
Obradovich, who found the
sideline to save precious . time.
And Lynn Swann drew a 42-yard
interference call against Jim
Kaffen. After a touchdown, the
Trojans were set up for a
33-second march to the
Limahelu clincher.
Shock again. The snake again?
I suspect poise might have more
to do with it.
How is poise instilled in a
young football team? That's one
for Jack Christiansen—l don't
know Let's hope somebody finds
out before Nov. 9, when that
cobra's likely to visit its favorite
victim once again.

to do with it.

LOS ANGELES—Personally, I like watching football in the
Coliseum. The neighborhood isn't the greatest and driving is a hassle,
but once inside the forboding concrete bowl, the feeling is pure
"big-time."
My only problem with the place is that I usually depart with my
heart in my throat and tears in my eyes. My favorites usually lose in
this enclave, usually in the final seconds. And usually they're the
Stanford Cardinals.
I hear lore of some veneipous cobra in the Coliseum which recoils
to strike with the cruelty of fate against helpless Stanford. "I don't
know whether we're snakebitten in the Coliseum or official bitten or
what," a stoic Jack Christiansen said Saturday night. On reflection, I
can find only the "or what" plausible.
I was more of a Dennis Dummit-UCLA fan when first I saw
Stanford in L.A. in 1969. But watching Jim Plunkett rally his Indians
in a seesaw struggle with the favored USC Trojans was enough to
convert me.
My joy was unbridled when Steve Horowitz booted a 37-yard field
goal with 1:'03 remaining to put the Indians ahead, 24-23.
John Ralston and his crew were pretty confident they were going
to get their first win over hated SC since 1958. But the Trojans had a
quarterback named Jimmy Jones, who, for all his foibles, had a knack
for last-minute heroics. He did this night, hitting receivers on clutch
passes during a tense final march.
With his team devoid of time-outs and the final second ticking off
the clock, Ron Ayala kicked a 34-yard field goal over the west post,
exactly as Chris Limahelu would do with three seconds left four years
later.
Many Stanford players collpased on the field in shock before
sadness enveloped them. This was snakebite No. 1 and they weren't
ready for it. I blamed "luck."
But a funny thing happened in the Rose Bowl-decider against
UCLA a year later. Poise speared the cobra.
Dummit rallied the Bruins, suffering from an equally painful Rose
Bowl drought, to a 7-6 fourth quarter lead. But Plunkett and
Horowitz were not rattled. Stanford marched dramatically up the
field a 30-yard winning field goal.
Mike Simone clenched a rose in his teeth amid the locker room
jumble. His Thunderchickens had proved their mettle, and would
again Jan. 1 against Ohio State. They were masters of their fate.
Rain pounded the Coliseum in 1971, but was nothing compared to
the pounding Stanford would apply to USC. The snake was forced

into hiding when Don Bunce and
company zoomed to a 33-10 lead
before a last-minute USC
touchdown.
The humiliation was a rare one
for the Trojans, and caustic
comments by Stanford players
afterward would earn the lasting
enmity of John McKay—to the
tune of "2000 points" a year
later.
The Cardinals were all but out
of the Rose Bowl race when they
faced UCLA in 1972.
Coliseum observers called the
game one of the wildest ever
there, one that just couldn't end
when the Cards took a 23-21
fourth quarter lead. Instead, Mark
Harmon performed another
miracle, and UCLA scored a
touchdown as time ran out to
keep the Bruins' Rose hopes alive.
Once again, the snakebite. Or
last-minute befuddlement on
defense, which occurred again in
the Coliseum last fall.
A ridiculous 26-point underdog
to USC, Stanford shocked 63,806
fans with diminutive Rod Garcia's
powerful toe. Leading 26-17 with
3:10 remaining, the Cards ate the
big one again.
Pat Haden found a new
receiver, tight end Jim
Obradovich, who found the
sideline to save precious . time.
And Lynn Swann drew a 42-yard
interference call against Jim
Kaffen. After a touchdown, the
Trojans were set up for a
33-second march to the
Limahelu clincher.
Shock again. The snake again?
I suspect poise might have more
to do with it.
