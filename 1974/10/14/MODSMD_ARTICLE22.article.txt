# Dodgers Even World Series
## A's Prove They Aren't Invincible 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
LOS ANGELES—With one blazing
pickoff throw, Los Angeles Dodger reliever
Mike Marshall cut down not only Herb
Washington but the myth that the Oakland
A's never make a mistake in an important
game.
Before that fateful throw, it looked as if
the A's, despite being throttled by Dodger
pitching, might eke out their second
straight win in the World Series— a win
that would have all but insured their third
straight championship.
Now, following the Dodgers' 3-2 win
yesterday, the series is even going back to
Oakland, where it'll resume tomorrow
evening.
Having seen two runs come across in the
ninth, the throng of 55,989 at Dodger
Stadium had to be worried, with
Washingtomon first and only one out.
The fear was bolstered by the local
media gods— broadcaster Vince Scully and
columnist Jim Murray— who'd spent much
of their time telling fans how the local
heroes didn't measure up to the
experienced A's when the chips were down
Saturday. The A's won 3-2 despite
being outhit 11-6.
A's The Winner
Before the second game, the attitudes of
the two clubs also led to the seemingly
inescapable conclusion that the A's were
the winners.

The Oakland players took the game
seriously, whomping batting practice
pitches solemnly. The players were edgy,
not answering controversial questions in
fear of the wrath of Charles 0. Finley. The
manager, Alvin Park, was talking about
baseball strategy, while Gene Tenace
practiced bunting. The impression was that
of a team which studied fundamental
baseball, one that left its collection of egos
in the clubhouse.
Some of the Dodger players, on the
other hand, didn't seem to know there was
a World Series going on. Davey Lopes was
the zaniest, starting a brief game of
stickball during batting practice that other
players eagerly joined. Other Dodgers
played with the A's mascot, Charlie 0.,
risking kicks in the pants that the mule's
namesake regularly gave his charges.
One of those players, Tom Paciorek,
was asked by a fan "Are you going to play
today?" He said "No, we want to win."
And then there was skipper Walter Alston,
who sat in the dugout, issuing some of the
biggest yawns ever seen.
In A Series?
The atmosphere that seemed to indicate
that L.A. didn't quite know what to do in
a World Series was bolstered by a blown
line in the National Anthem, loose security
and some nutty fans who threw Frisbees.
In A World Series?
Once the game started, it was apparent

that, whether they actually did win or not,
the Dodgers were the superior team on this
day.
Their ace, Don Sutton, who had won his
last 10 decisions, outpitched Vida Blue.
Sutton, for the first six innings, allowed
but one hit, while Blue, despite great stuff,
struggled.
In the sixth, with L.A. ahead only 1-0,
Joe Ferguson smacked a fastball 430 feet
with a man aboard and some writers began
typing their stories.
(Ferguson, thus far the star of the series,
will probably move from right field, where
he made one of the great throws in Series
history Saturday, to catcher tomorrow.)
A's Come Back
But true to form, the A's came back.
Shuffling four pinch-something-or-others in
the eighth, Dark managed to load the bases

with one out. It looked like a great spot for
the A's to magically get back in the game.
But Steve Garvey dug a throw out of the
dirt to complete a double play and save
two runs.
Garvey, who's batting .444 for the
Series, said the catch "was probably my
toughest ever." Dark called it "the biggest
play of the game."
Maybe so. But in the ninth came the
next big one. Refusing to give up, the A's
put men on second and third with none
out.
Didn't Fold
Exit Sutton and enter Marshall. Surely,
with the best reliever (or is it just "the best
pitcher") in the league on the mound, the
A's would collapse.
But they didn't. Joe Rudi smacked a
two-run single, and the tying run was at
first with no one out.
After a strikeout of Tenace, Dark put in
designated whirlwind Herb Washington to
steal second and set up the tying run.
Marshall stepped off the rubber a couple of
times, and suddenly fired to Garvey, who
easily made the tag on the stunned
Washington.
The last out was anti-climatic. The A's
had beaten themselves, and maybe from
now on, it'll be a series of the two greatest
teams in baseball rather than of some cagey
old pros teaching some talented kids how
to play the game.

HMMM—Stanford forward Jim Melamed (right) stares off in the
distance, apparently at a soccer ball cleared by the San Francisco
State College fullback on his left. The Cards beat SFS last Tuesday,
1-0, but were shut out by UCLA Saturday, 4-0.
