# Poloists Break Even In Pac-8 Openers
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
Brett White's field goal at the Coliseum Saturday night wasn't the
only last-second Stanford disaster this weekend. Earlier Saturday, the
Cardinal water polo team lost 5-4 to the Bruins on a goal that was
disallowed by the official with five seconds remaining.
The loss gave Stanford a split in the opening weekend of Pacific
Eight play. Friday, the Cards defeated USC, 6-4, in a game that even
Ripley wouldn't have believed.
Against a 1-0 Bruin team, Stanford was outscored in the first and
third quarters, 3-1 and 2-1.
"In these quarters they forced us into their styleâ€” a slow,
methodical type of playing. That's why they outscored us," said
coach Art Lambert. The Cardinals seemed to regain their fast and
mobile play in the second and fourth quarters, however, and blanked

the Bruins 1-0 in both periods.
With five seconds remaining,
though, the Cardinals had their
wings clipped as the tying goal
was refused due to a penalty.
"It was a really bad break for
us," Lambert understated.
John Roberts provided the
bulk of the Stanford scoring with
two goals, as the Cardinals scored
once each quarter.
The previous day across town,
the Cardinals met a USC Trojan
team in a game that Lambert still
cannot believe.
"I was glad to leave USC. They
had an indoor pool with a shallow
end, a terrible referee and a clock
that was totally messed up," said
a disbelieving Lambert.
According to Lambert, what is
even more unbelievable is that the
Trojans are protesting the game
because of their own poor
conditions. Despite this, however,
two goals by Paul Clark and Dean
Anderson and a goal apiece by
Rick Purcell and Roberts
preserved the Stanford victory.
The Cardinals, who are now in
second place behind UCLA in the
Pac-8 race with a 1-1 league
record, host DeAnza Junior
College Friday and California
Saturday at 4 p.m. and 10 a.m.,
respectively. California is the
defending NCAA water polo
champion.
"DeAnza will mainly be a game
to sharpen our skills," Lambert
said. "We're going to have to get
psyched up for this game so that
we know we can compete with
them. If we play our type of
game, we ought to be able to."
