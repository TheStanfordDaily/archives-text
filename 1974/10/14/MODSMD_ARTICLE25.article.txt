# Walls Come Tumbling Down
## Bruin Booters Blank Cards 
### DAN PYNE 
The Stanford soccer team's
hopes of establishing itself as a
major Western soccer power were
slightly punctured Saturday, as
the Cardinals were bombed by
UCLA, 4-0, in Los Angeles.
Following impressive play
against San Jose State and the
University of San Francisco, the
Cardinals were ranked seventh
regionally. A victory over
fourth-ranked UCLA would have
solidified their regional standing,
and possibly given them a national
berth. But the walls, as they say,
came tumbling down.
"We just kind of fell
apart," said head coach Fred
Priddle after the game. "We
started to dominate right at the
beginning, but we kept giving the
ball away. We just weren't
thinking."
The Bruins scored early on a
shot from the left side of the
Stanford penalty area in the third
minute of play, and again, two
minutes later, from the right side.
Overpowered
"We let them overpower us,"
Priddle said, "It was as though
they had us mesmerized; we were
in a daze all game."
He paused, then added, "It just
wasn't our day ..."
Indeed it wasn't. Phil Wright
was thrown out of the game for
arguing with the referees in the
first half, and then, after
continuing to protest from the
sidelines, was told to leave the
field. Mike Kellogg was ejected
early in the second half for a
minor fisticuff with a UCLA
player.
"The reffing," explained
Priddle, "was pretty bad."
UCLA's third goal was scored
at 40 minutes into the first
period, giving the Bruins a 3-0
halftime lead. The Cardinal
defense stiffened in the second

half, but the Bruins managed to
push in a fourth goal with 15
minutes remaining in the match.
Momentum
"They just got their
momentum going," said Priddle,
"and we couldn't stop it. I still
thought we had a chance to win at
the half, even though we were
down by three."
The game statistics looked
bleak for the Cardinals. UCLA
had 21 shots on goal to Stanford's
7; the Bruins had 11 corner kicks,
the Cardinals 1. Card goalkeeper
Bruce Mosbacher had eight saves,
giving up in this game more goals

than have been scored against him
all year.
It was Stanford's sixth straight
loss to UCLA, and the first time
the Bruins have shut them out.
Priddle said that the Cardinal
booters "played their hearts out,"
but it was just one of those days.
"This will probably take us out of
the top 10," he added, "but we
can get back up there with a good
showing in our next three games."
The Cardinals play Canada
College Wednesday, Santa Clara in
the Menlo Invitational on
Thursday, and the California
Saturday morning.
