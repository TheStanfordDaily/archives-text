SAN DIEGO Quarterback Ken
Stabler hit Bob Moore with a
four-yard, fourth quarter touchdown

victory over the San Diego Chargers
yesterday.

the most of little offense and a
suddenly solid defense, turned two

Baseball
LOS ANGELES - The New York
Mets' long quest for power-hitting Joe
Torre finally ended yesterday when
they acquired the veteran slugger from
the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for
pitchers Ray Sadecki and Tommy
Moore.
The Mets have been on Torre's trail
for several seasons, but the price has
always been too high to suit New
York. Now, it seems, Torre's price may
have become too high to suit the
Cardinals.
A veteran of 14 major league

seasons, the Brooklyn-born Torre, 34,
earns approximately $150,000 a year.
His ample salary and his age may have
been factors in arranging the deal.
He batted .282 with 11 home runs
and 70 runs batted in for the Cardinals
in 1974 and has a career total of 240
homers.
Golf
INZAI, Japan Gene Littler,
playing in the rain, fired a
two-under-par 69 yesterday and won
the $300,000 Pacific Master golf
tournament with a 279 total, five
strokes ahead of runner-up Bert
Yancey.
Littler collected $65,000 for the
victory, golf's biggest prize. Yancey
was runner-up for the second straight
year after a final round 73 and a
72-hole total of 284. Hsieh Yung-Yo of
Taiwan was third with 72-285.
