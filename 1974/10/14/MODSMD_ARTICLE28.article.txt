Senate Panel May Recall Rockefeller
WASHINGTON Vice President-designate Nelson A.
Rockefeller may be recalled before the Senate Rules
Committee to answer questions about his cash gifts to
various people and about a book considered derogatory to a
one-time opponent for the New York governorship.
Sen. Howard Cannon's press secretary, Barbara Dahlke,
said last night Cannon, chairman of the committee which
held confirmation hearings on Rockefeller's nomination,
told her the hearing may be re-opened.
She quoted Cannon (D-Nev.) as saying, "There's a good
likelihood that the Rules Committee will recall Mr.
Rockefeller." And she said "more than likely questioning
will be on the gifts and the books."
She also said Cannon told her committee would not
vote on confirmation before December.
Dahlke said she did not know whether Cannon had any
timetable in mind for recalling Rockefeller. She also said
she didn't know whether he had talked with other
committee members.
In New York, Rockefeller, stung by reports that he had
been "less than candid" in reporting his almost $2 million
in gifts to friends and political associates, insisted he now
had told all he had been officially asked.
His office had no immediate comment on the possibility
of reopening the hearings.
"I have responded totally to the requests of both
committee chairmen," he said.
Rockefeller had been asked by Cannon to list gifts made
to public officials and associates between 1957 and 1974.
Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.), chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, had asked for similar information.
Rockefeller seemed particularly bitter about a report
that "Rockefeller interests" had arranged a $50,000 loan
for L. Judson Morhouse, a former New York State official.
The report, broadcast by NBC, said Morhouse bought
stock with the money and made a profit of over $lOO,OOO.
Crowd Marches For Integration
BOSTON A crowd estimated by police at 500 to 600
people, mostly blacks, marched yesterday from the city's
Roxbury section to the Boston Common for a rally to
support school integration.
The 45-minute march about a mile in length
proceeded under heavy police watch without trouble and
was followed by a motorcade of about 70 cars, many of
them flying large balloons with "Black is Beautiful" printed
in white letters.
The march and rally were authorized by the city last
Friday in permits issued to the Massachusetts Black Caucus.
At the head of the parade was a large banner that said
"Save Your Bricks to Build Your Community."
Another sign said "Stop Violence, Start Learning."
The march and rally came a month after Boston schools
began integrating black and white pupils under a
court-ordered busing plan.
On Saturday night, Gov. Francis W. Sargent said he had
received assurances from President Ford that federal troops
will be available if local law enforcement authorities cannot
maintain order during the integration.
Sargent said the pledge came in a 15-minute telephone
conversation with the President on Saturday night. He said
Ford told him he'd been following the Boston situation
"very closely" and was "upset and distressed."
Resignation 'Won't Affect Trial'
WASHINGTON The resignation of Leon Jaworski as
special Watergate prosecutor is expected to have no effect
on the Watergate cover-up case which goes to public trial in
U.S. District court here today.
In resigning Saturday, effective Oct. 25, Jaworski said
that his work was largely finished.

He recommended that his deputy, Henry S. Ruth Jr., be
named to succeed him.
A White House spokesman said Atty. Gen. William B.
Saxbe will select a replacement for Jaworski before Oct. 25,
after thorough consultation with President Ford.
White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen said Ford feels
deep gratitude to Jaworski for his service.
'The President realizes that Mr. Jaworski accepted this
appointment at a very critical time and he accepted the
appointment at extreme personal sacrifice to himself,"
Nessen said.
Gallup Poll: Ford Popularity Drops
PRINCETON, N.J. President Ford's approval rating
has dropped 21 percentage points since he took office,
according to the Gallup Poll.
The survey shows half of those questioned saying they
approve of the way Ford is handling his job, 28 percent
disapproving and 22 percent expressing no opinion.
The current rating represents the sharpest decline for
any President in his first two months in office.
In a poll taken just after Ford took office in August, 71
percent said they approved of the way Ford was assuming
the nation's leadership. Only 3 percent said they
disapproved, and 26 percent said they were undecided.
Ford's rating fell off five percentage points between the
first poll and one taken early in September.
The latest poll was taken after Ford pardoned former
President Nixon on Sept. 8 and before Ford presented his
economic program to Congress a month later.
Kissinger: New Agreement with Israel
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger said yesterday he has reached agreement with
Israeli leaders on "the principles and procedures" toward
the next stage of Middle East peace negotiations.
U.S. officials said Kissinger hoped to have peace
negotiations under way by the end of the year.
Kissinger announced the agreement in a statement at
Jerusalem airport before flying here for talks with Saudi
leaders.
He met with King Faisal to seek his support at the Arab
summit meeting in Morocco scheduled for later this month,
and to emphasize the severe repercussions of a continuing
price production squeeze on the consuming countries.
He stressed that economic disorder on a global scale was
not in Saudi Arabia's best interest, according to Kissinger's
aides.
Ed Sullivan Dies At 72
NEW YORK Ed Sullivan, whose "really big show"
reigned on Sunday night television for more than two
decades, died last night at Lenox Hill hospital, officials said.
He was 72.
Sullivan, who brought the variety program to the air in
1948 and who introduced such entertainers as Dean Martin,
Jerry Lewis and Jackie Gleason, also was a Broadway gossip
columnist for the New York Daily News.
His stiff manner, his halting delivery and his habit of
pronouncing his show as "shew" made Sullivan, as master of
ceremonies, as much a personality as the guest entertainers
and variety acts themselves.
His show left the CBS television network in 1972 after
being cancelled. Sullivan's wife Sylvia died in 1973.
