# Econ Research Bureau Opens
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
The National Bureau of Economic
Research, Inc. recently opened its
West Coast office here.
The office is located on Junipero
Serra Boulevard, adjacent to the
Center for Advanced Study in
Behavioral Sciences.
A non-profit economic research
unit, "its purpose is to deal with
furnishing background theories and
analysis for economics
decision-making," said Prof. Sherman
Maisel of Berkeley, co-head of the
Stanford office. "We are an
empirically oriented organization."
Maisel said the bureau researches
specific areas of economics, gathering
facts which later are published under
its auspices. Some 500 titles have been
published by the group to date.
No 'Think Tank'
He points out, though, that the
bureau should not be labeled a "think
tank. We do not accept contracts to
study specific problems."
According to Maisel, the office here
was formed in order to decentralize
the primarily East Coast operation and
to allow more West Coast professors to
become involved in its research. The
bureau located here because of the
University's research facilities and its
"general intellectual atmosphere,"
Maisel indicated.
Another factor in the institute's
decision to locate here was the
University's donation of the land and
its offer to finance the building.
The building was gradually finished
last winter, enabling most of the staff
to move in July 1.
Professorial Staff
Right now, most of the office's
staff is composed of Stanford
professors, headed by Maisel and
Stanford Professor Victor Fuchs. They
remain at the University while working
on bureau projects, said Maisel. He

expects to have a permanent staff of
40 people when fully in operation.
Graduate students often help in the
research being conducted, he added.
Maisel hopes that the staff will
continue to expand and diversify as
the office becomes more established.
Nationally, the bureau consists of
five branch offices. Two other major
offices are located in Cambridge, Mass.
and New York City, with two smaller
offices in Washington, D.C. and New
Haven, Conn.
John R. Meyers, a former professor
at Harvard, has served as the group's
president since 1968, succeeding

Arthur Burns, currently chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board.
Moses Abramovitz, a professor here
and former chairman of the
Economics Department, was elected
vice chairman of the bureau's board of
directors at a meeting held in
conjunction with the opening of the
office here. He first worked for the
bureau through the original New York
office a number of years ago.
Funded through government
agencies, private donations,
foundations and the sale of its reports,
the bureau's budget currently is $6
million.
