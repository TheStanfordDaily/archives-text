# Police Find No Evidence To Link Campus Killings
## 
### 
The murder of 19-year-old Arlis
Perry yesterday morning was the
fourth homicide here in less than two
years, and the third involving a young
woman out alone.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
investigating officers said yesterday
they had nothing to link the Perry
murder to the earlier slayings,
although for the moment they weren't
totally ruling out that possibility.
So far, none of the four murders,
extending back to February 1973,
have been solved.
Leslie Marie Perlov, a 21-year-old

Stanford graduate and Palo Alto law
librarian, was found strangled to death
on Feb. 16, 1973, in the foothills
behind campus. She had disappeared
after work on Feb. 13, and her car was
found parked near the entrance to the
Old Quarry just off Old Page Mill
Road.
Just a little over a year ago, on
Sept. 11, 1973, physics student David
S. Levine was brutally stabbed to
death between 1 and 3 a.m. on a
walkway just east of Meyer
Undergraduate Library.
Like the others, that case has never
been officially solved. But police have
never ruled out a theory propounded
by San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto
that the murder was the work of a cult
called the Death Angels that was also
supposedly responsible for the
so-called Zebra street killings in San
Francisco.
A December 1973 murder at
UC-Berkeley that closely resembled
the Levine slaying was also linked to
the Death Angels but, as in the Levine
case, no one was ever brought to trial.
On March 24 of this year, Janet
Ann Taylor, 21, was strangled while
hitchhiking back to her La Honda
home after visiting a friend on the
campus. Her body was discovered
early next morning in a roadside ditch
on Sand Hill Road about three miles
from campus. Taylor, a former Canada
College student, was the daughter of
Chuck Taylor, former Stanford
athletic director.
Investigators have never linked any
of the campus slayings with each
other, although they did admit to
certain "similarities" between the
Perlov and Taylor murders.
The incidence of homicide on
campus has apparently turned sharply
upward recently, along with that of
other serious crimes. Stanford Police
Department figures show that only
one murder occurred here between
1967 and 1973, when Dr. Leslie
Kulhanek was shot to death at the
Medical Center in 1969 by a gunman
who later surrendered.

the Levine slaying was also linked to
the Death Angels but, as in the Levine
case, no one was ever brought to trial.
On March 24 of this year, Janet
Ann Taylor, 21, was strangled while
hitchhiking back to her La Honda
home after visiting a friend on the
campus. Her body was discovered
early next morning in a roadside ditch
on Sand Hill Road about three miles
from campus. Taylor, a former Canada
College student, was the daughter of
Chuck Taylor, former Stanford
athletic director.
Investigators have never linked any
of the campus slayings with each
other, although they did admit to
certain "similarities" between the
Perlov and Taylor murders.
The incidence of homicide on
campus has apparently turned sharply
upward recently, along with that of
other serious crimes. Stanford Police
Department figures show that only
one murder occurred here between
1967 and 1973, when Dr. Leslie
Kulhanek was shot to death at the
Medical Center in 1969 by a gunman
who later surrendered.
The murder of 19-year-old Arlis
Perry yesterday morning was the
fourth homicide here in less than two
years, and the third involving a young
woman out alone.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
investigating officers said yesterday
they had nothing to link the Perry
murder to the earlier slayings,
although for the moment they weren't
totally ruling out that possibility.
So far, none of the four murders,
extending back to February 1973,
have been solved.
Leslie Marie Perlov, a 21-year-old

Stanford graduate and Palo Alto law
librarian, was found strangled to death
on Feb. 16, 1973, in the foothills
behind campus. She had disappeared
after work on Feb. 13, and her car was
found parked near the entrance to the
Old Quarry just off Old Page Mill
Road.
Just a little over a year ago, on
Sept. 11, 1973, physics student David
S. Levine was brutally stabbed to
death between 1 and 3 a.m. on a
walkway just east of Meyer
Undergraduate Library.
Like the others, that case has never
been officially solved. But police have
never ruled out a theory propounded
by San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto
that the murder was the work of a cult
called the Death Angels that was also
supposedly responsible for the
so-called Zebra street killings in San
Francisco.
A December 1973 murder at
UC-Berkeley that closely resembled
the Levine slaying was also linked to
the Death Angels but, as in the Levine
case, no one was ever brought to trial.
