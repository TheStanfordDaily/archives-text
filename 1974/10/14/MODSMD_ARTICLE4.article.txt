# Richardson Asks Halt To GOP Spats
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Republicans must avoid inner-party quarrels
about irrelevant issues if they hope to forge an
electoral majority, former Atty. Gen. Elliot
Richardson declared in Palo Alto Saturday.
"Republicans still fight among themselves about'
problems that ceased to be important 15 years ago,"
Richardson stated at a press conference at Rickey's
Hyatt House. "If we stopped doing this, we
Republicans could become the majority party."
Speaking later at a $lOO a plate dinner given by
the Santa Clara County United Republican Finance
Committee, Richardson explained that although
governmental leaders long ago accepted the need to
support social welfare programs, many Republicans
still argue that the government should eschew all
such programs.
"Bury Factionalism"
"We must bury forever the factionalism . .. that
reached its bitterest stage in this state," Richardson
said.
Endorsing the bid of Rep. Paul N.McCloskey, Jr.
(R-Menlo Park) for a fifth term in Congress,
Richardson said that if the GOP is to survive, it
must welcome the presence of controversial
Republican liberals such as McCloskey in the party.
"We need people who will disagree with us but
who will tell us the truth," Richardson said. "It is
more important to have men of integrity than
people we agree with."
A 'Resurgence'
Richardson asserted that the "beginning of
Republican resurgence" will occur when men such

as McCloskey are supported by all elements in the
party.
Citing the basic agreement between Republicans
and Democrats on such issues as national health
program, Richardson stated that the only issues that
remain concern the means for solving social

problems.
At the press conference, Richardson praised the
work of Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski in helping to establish the independence of
that office. Jaworski resigned Saturday, effective
Oct. 25.
Richardson resigned as attorney general in
October 1973 when President Nixon ordered him to
fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox.
Independence Major Hurdle
"The major hurdles have been cleared,"
Richardson said in reference to the Special
Prosecutor's job. "The most fundamental hurdle
was to establish the independence of the office.
That is no longer an issue.
"The assertion of independence meant that
evidence couldn't be withheld by the executive
branch. The toughest issue—how to proceed against
the former president— has been removed by the
pardon."
Richardson noted that the power of President
Ford to pardon Nixon "is so clear that to challenge
that proposition would be beyond the pale."
Refuting the contention that a President can
pardon only people convicted of a crime,
Richardson stated that if the Founding Fathers had
meant that, they would have explicitly said so in the
Constitution.
Richardson said he guessed that the Special
Prosecutors Office will continue in operation for a
long time because of appeals growing out of the
Watergate convictions.

A 'Resurgence'
Richardson asserted that the "beginning of
Republican resurgence" will occur when men such

as McCloskey are supported by all elements in the
party.
Citing the basic agreement between Republicans
and Democrats on such issues as national health
program, Richardson stated that the only issues that
remain concern the means for solving social

problems.
At the press conference, Richardson praised the
work of Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski in helping to establish the independence of
that office. Jaworski resigned Saturday, effective
Oct. 25.
Richardson resigned as attorney general in
October 1973 when President Nixon ordered him to
fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox.
Independence Major Hurdle
"The major hurdles have been cleared,"
Richardson said in reference to the Special
Prosecutor's job. "The most fundamental hurdle
was to establish the independence of the office.
That is no longer an issue.
"The assertion of independence meant that
evidence couldn't be withheld by the executive
branch. The toughest issue—how to proceed against
the former president— has been removed by the
pardon."
Richardson noted that the power of President
Ford to pardon Nixon "is so clear that to challenge
that proposition would be beyond the pale."
Refuting the contention that a President can
pardon only people convicted of a crime,
Richardson stated that if the Founding Fathers had
meant that, they would have explicitly said so in the
Constitution.
Richardson said he guessed that the Special
Prosecutors Office will continue in operation for a
long time because of appeals growing out of the
Watergate convictions.

Republicans must avoid inner-party quarrels
about irrelevant issues if they hope to forge an
electoral majority, former Atty. Gen. Elliot
Richardson declared in Palo Alto Saturday.
"Republicans still fight among themselves about'
problems that ceased to be important 15 years ago,"
Richardson stated at a press conference at Rickey's
Hyatt House. "If we stopped doing this, we
Republicans could become the majority party."
Speaking later at a $lOO a plate dinner given by
the Santa Clara County United Republican Finance
Committee, Richardson explained that although
governmental leaders long ago accepted the need to
support social welfare programs, many Republicans
still argue that the government should eschew all
such programs.
"Bury Factionalism"
"We must bury forever the factionalism . .. that
reached its bitterest stage in this state," Richardson
said.
Endorsing the bid of Rep. Paul N.McCloskey, Jr.
(R-Menlo Park) for a fifth term in Congress,
Richardson said that if the GOP is to survive, it
must welcome the presence of controversial
Republican liberals such as McCloskey in the party.
"We need people who will disagree with us but
who will tell us the truth," Richardson said. "It is
more important to have men of integrity than
people we agree with."
