# Paralytics Endure Difficulty Of Readjustment
## 
### BOB LOWE First Of Three Parts 
By this time next year about 10,000 previously
able-bodied Americans will be paralyzed due to spinal cord
injuries sustained in accidents ranging from car wrecks to
diving in shallow pools.
Whether they are paraplegic paralyzed from the waist
down or quadriplegic, with some impairment of the
upper body, these people will begin the long task of
adjusting to a new life style.
Thrown suddenly into a mobile world without the use of
their legs, spinal cord injury victims must adjust
psychologically as well as physically.
Young Male Victims
Mike Thomas, 25, broke his back last April when the car
in which he was riding "wrapped around a telephone pole."
Like the vast majority of spinal cord injury victims,
Thomas is male and under the age of 30. Young men are
often considered the most likely victims because they are
the most active group in our society and take far more risks
than anyone else.
Thomas is a patient in the Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital's new Spinal Cord Injury Center.
He described the weeks following his accident as "sheer
hell." For a month he couldn't even lift his head off his
bed.
Initial Despair
Actually, Thomas is very lucky. Although he fractured
his spine, he didn't sever his spinal cord completely. In a
few months he will probably walk again.
But for several weeks, Thomas knew the initial despair of
those who are suddenly paralyzed.
"For a month all I could do was move one toe," he said.
"I didn't think I'd ever be able to walk again."
Thomas said he was depressed to the point of sincerely
wanting his own death. Then suddenly he started having
more movement in his feet.
Thomas now hopes to soon have 100 percent recovery.
He has only to wait for his back to heal before he will try
to walk.

Thomas is the lucky one-out-of-ten spinal injury victim
who will recover much of the use of his legs, according to
Dr. Inder Perkash, director of the new center and an
instructor at the Medical Center.
But for each Mike Thomas there are nine others who
must adjust to a new life.
Vince Edson is one of them.
Edson, 24, was paralyzed from the waist down three
years ago after an accident aboard a Navy ship off the coast
of Vietnam.
He was sucked into a giant jet intake "something like
a giant vacuum cleaner," he said.
Tossed around inside the intake, Edson fractured his
spine and received severe liver lacerations. The vacuum
inside the intake collapsed his lungs.
Initially Depressed
A physical therapist at the new Palo Alto center,
Richard Ferdinand, said that almost all spinal cord injury
victims "initially are very depressed."
"After that, some guys totally reject it," he added.
"They deny that they are paralyzed and are even
euphoric."
Some of the victims become hostile, blaming themselves
and others for what happened, Ferdinand said. "Some, like
those injured in brawls, can be very vengeful."
First Question
Ferdinand said the first question the spinal injury victim
asks is, "Will I ever walk again?"
But just as important as walking to the young paraplegic
or quadriplegic is whether or not he can have sex again,
Ferdinand added.
"It's at least as big a concern as walking," Ferdinand
said. "But it's something they won't talk about."
"They will make references to it like saying, 'My
girlfriend's coming next weekend and I can't wait to get her
in bed.' They want a response from you but they don't
want to come right out and ask you."
'Reasonably Good Sex Life'
Perkash said paraplegics and quadriplegics can have a
"reasonably good sex life."

But he added that the men must be "retrained and have
a different type of satisfaction."
Paralyzed men are capable of having an erection, he said,
but because they usually have no feeling below the waist,
the satisfaction derived from sex is mainly psychological.
Many paraplegics and quadriplegics also have trouble
ejaculating, making sexual reproduction difficult.
Control Of Body Functions
Another big physical problem for the paralyzed is
control over bowel and bladder functions. At first the body
doesn't rid itself of wastes, making catheterization and the
use of drugs necessary, Perkash said.
In catheterization a tube is passed through the uretha to
drain the bladder.
But though recently developed processes the spinal cord
can be made to assume control of bowel and bladder
functions even though it is severed from the brain.
A few months after treatment begins paraplegics and
quadriplegics can have relatively normal bowel and bladder
functions. More important, they learn to take care of those
functions by themselves a big step in establishing a
non-dependent style of life.
Technology has overcome many obstacles for the
paralyzed. Motorized wheelchairs and hand-driven cars
solve much of the mobility problem.
Stumbling Blocks
But hundreds of day-to-day activities, formerly routine,
must now be relearned. Putting on a pair of pants and
brushing teeth become stumbling blocks for someone who
can't use his hands or legs.
Transferring from bed to wheelchair, and wheelchair to
car must be learned. Paraplegics must begin to rely on their
arms and shoulders.
But for the quadriplegic and extent of arm and hands
functioning is vitally important. If he lacks the strength to
move from bed to wheelchair, the quadriplegic may never
be independent and will probably require daily care for the
rest of his life.

doesn't rid itself of wastes, making catheterization and the
use of drugs necessary, Perkash said.
In catheterization a tube is passed through the uretha to
drain the bladder.
But though recently developed processes the spinal cord
can be made to assume control of bowel and bladder
functions even though it is severed from the brain.
A few months after treatment begins paraplegics and
quadriplegics can have relatively normal bowel and bladder
functions. More important, they learn to take care of those
functions by themselves a big step in establishing a
non-dependent style of life.
Technology has overcome many obstacles for the
paralyzed. Motorized wheelchairs and hand-driven cars
solve much of the mobility problem.
Stumbling Blocks
But hundreds of day-to-day activities, formerly routine,
must now be relearned. Putting on a pair of pants and
brushing teeth become stumbling blocks for someone who
can't use his hands or legs.
Transferring from bed to wheelchair, and wheelchair to
car must be learned. Paraplegics must begin to rely on their
arms and shoulders.
But for the quadriplegic and extent of arm and hands
functioning is vitally important. If he lacks the strength to
move from bed to wheelchair, the quadriplegic may never
be independent and will probably require daily care for the
rest of his life.

PARALYZED PATIENT—Mark Turpine, a patient at the
Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital's new Spinal
Cord Injury Center, strengthens his arms and hands in an
exercise prepared by a center therapist. Turpine fractured
his neck in a diving accident.
By this time next year about 10,000 previously
able-bodied Americans will be paralyzed due to spinal cord
injuries sustained in accidents ranging from car wrecks to
diving in shallow pools.
Whether they are paraplegic paralyzed from the waist
down or quadriplegic, with some impairment of the
upper body, these people will begin the long task of
adjusting to a new life style.
Thrown suddenly into a mobile world without the use of
their legs, spinal cord injury victims must adjust
psychologically as well as physically.
Young Male Victims
Mike Thomas, 25, broke his back last April when the car
in which he was riding "wrapped around a telephone pole."
Like the vast majority of spinal cord injury victims,
Thomas is male and under the age of 30. Young men are
often considered the most likely victims because they are
the most active group in our society and take far more risks
than anyone else.
Thomas is a patient in the Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital's new Spinal Cord Injury Center.
He described the weeks following his accident as "sheer
hell." For a month he couldn't even lift his head off his
bed.
Initial Despair
Actually, Thomas is very lucky. Although he fractured
his spine, he didn't sever his spinal cord completely. In a
few months he will probably walk again.
But for several weeks, Thomas knew the initial despair of
those who are suddenly paralyzed.
"For a month all I could do was move one toe," he said.
"I didn't think I'd ever be able to walk again."
Thomas said he was depressed to the point of sincerely
wanting his own death. Then suddenly he started having
more movement in his feet.
Thomas now hopes to soon have 100 percent recovery.
He has only to wait for his back to heal before he will try
to walk.

Thomas is the lucky one-out-of-ten spinal injury victim
who will recover much of the use of his legs, according to
Dr. Inder Perkash, director of the new center and an
instructor at the Medical Center.
But for each Mike Thomas there are nine others who
must adjust to a new life.
Vince Edson is one of them.
Edson, 24, was paralyzed from the waist down three
years ago after an accident aboard a Navy ship off the coast
of Vietnam.
He was sucked into a giant jet intake "something like
a giant vacuum cleaner," he said.
Tossed around inside the intake, Edson fractured his
spine and received severe liver lacerations. The vacuum
inside the intake collapsed his lungs.
Initially Depressed
A physical therapist at the new Palo Alto center,
Richard Ferdinand, said that almost all spinal cord injury
victims "initially are very depressed."
"After that, some guys totally reject it," he added.
"They deny that they are paralyzed and are even
euphoric."
Some of the victims become hostile, blaming themselves
and others for what happened, Ferdinand said. "Some, like
those injured in brawls, can be very vengeful."
First Question
Ferdinand said the first question the spinal injury victim
asks is, "Will I ever walk again?"
But just as important as walking to the young paraplegic
or quadriplegic is whether or not he can have sex again,
Ferdinand added.
"It's at least as big a concern as walking," Ferdinand
said. "But it's something they won't talk about."
"They will make references to it like saying, 'My
girlfriend's coming next weekend and I can't wait to get her
in bed.' They want a response from you but they don't
want to come right out and ask you."
'Reasonably Good Sex Life'
Perkash said paraplegics and quadriplegics can have a
"reasonably good sex life."

But he added that the men must be "retrained and have
a different type of satisfaction."
Paralyzed men are capable of having an erection, he said,
but because they usually have no feeling below the waist,
the satisfaction derived from sex is mainly psychological.
Many paraplegics and quadriplegics also have trouble
ejaculating, making sexual reproduction difficult.
Control Of Body Functions
Another big physical problem for the paralyzed is
control over bowel and bladder functions. At first the body
doesn't rid itself of wastes, making catheterization and the
use of drugs necessary, Perkash said.

victims "initially are very depressed."
"After that, some guys totally reject it," he added.
"They deny that they are paralyzed and are even
euphoric."
Some of the victims become hostile, blaming themselves
and others for what happened, Ferdinand said. "Some, like
those injured in brawls, can be very vengeful."
First Question
Ferdinand said the first question the spinal injury victim
asks is, "Will I ever walk again?"
But just as important as walking to the young paraplegic
or quadriplegic is whether or not he can have sex again,
Ferdinand added.
"It's at least as big a concern as walking," Ferdinand
said. "But it's something they won't talk about."
"They will make references to it like saying, 'My
girlfriend's coming next weekend and I can't wait to get her
in bed.' They want a response from you but they don't
want to come right out and ask you."
'Reasonably Good Sex Life'
Perkash said paraplegics and quadriplegics can have a
"reasonably good sex life."

But he added that the men must be "retrained and have
a different type of satisfaction."
Paralyzed men are capable of having an erection, he said,
but because they usually have no feeling below the waist,
the satisfaction derived from sex is mainly psychological.
Many paraplegics and quadriplegics also have trouble
ejaculating, making sexual reproduction difficult.
Control Of Body Functions
Another big physical problem for the paralyzed is
control over bowel and bladder functions. At first the body
doesn't rid itself of wastes, making catheterization and the
use of drugs necessary, Perkash said.
In catheterization a tube is passed through the uretha to
drain the bladder.
But though recently developed processes the spinal cord
can be made to assume control of bowel and bladder
functions even though it is severed from the brain.
A few months after treatment begins paraplegics and
quadriplegics can have relatively normal bowel and bladder
functions. More important, they learn to take care of those
functions by themselves a big step in establishing a
non-dependent style of life.
Technology has overcome many obstacles for the
paralyzed. Motorized wheelchairs and hand-driven cars
solve much of the mobility problem.
Stumbling Blocks
But hundreds of day-to-day activities, formerly routine,
must now be relearned. Putting on a pair of pants and
brushing teeth become stumbling blocks for someone who
can't use his hands or legs.
Transferring from bed to wheelchair, and wheelchair to
car must be learned. Paraplegics must begin to rely on their
arms and shoulders.
But for the quadriplegic and extent of arm and hands
functioning is vitally important. If he lacks the strength to
move from bed to wheelchair, the quadriplegic may never
be independent and will probably require daily care for the
rest of his life.

PARALYZED PATIENT—Mark Turpine, a patient at the
Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital's new Spinal
Cord Injury Center, strengthens his arms and hands in an
exercise prepared by a center therapist. Turpine fractured
his neck in a diving accident.
By this time next year about 10,000 previously
able-bodied Americans will be paralyzed due to spinal cord
injuries sustained in accidents ranging from car wrecks to
diving in shallow pools.
Whether they are paraplegic paralyzed from the waist
down or quadriplegic, with some impairment of the
upper body, these people will begin the long task of
adjusting to a new life style.
Thrown suddenly into a mobile world without the use of
their legs, spinal cord injury victims must adjust
psychologically as well as physically.
Young Male Victims
Mike Thomas, 25, broke his back last April when the car
in which he was riding "wrapped around a telephone pole."
Like the vast majority of spinal cord injury victims,
Thomas is male and under the age of 30. Young men are
often considered the most likely victims because they are
the most active group in our society and take far more risks
than anyone else.
Thomas is a patient in the Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital's new Spinal Cord Injury Center.
He described the weeks following his accident as "sheer
hell." For a month he couldn't even lift his head off his
bed.
Initial Despair
Actually, Thomas is very lucky. Although he fractured
his spine, he didn't sever his spinal cord completely. In a
few months he will probably walk again.
But for several weeks, Thomas knew the initial despair of
those who are suddenly paralyzed.
"For a month all I could do was move one toe," he said.
"I didn't think I'd ever be able to walk again."
Thomas said he was depressed to the point of sincerely
wanting his own death. Then suddenly he started having
more movement in his feet.
Thomas now hopes to soon have 100 percent recovery.
He has only to wait for his back to heal before he will try
to walk.

Thomas is the lucky one-out-of-ten spinal injury victim
who will recover much of the use of his legs, according to
Dr. Inder Perkash, director of the new center and an
instructor at the Medical Center.
But for each Mike Thomas there are nine others who
must adjust to a new life.
Vince Edson is one of them.
Edson, 24, was paralyzed from the waist down three
years ago after an accident aboard a Navy ship off the coast
of Vietnam.
He was sucked into a giant jet intake "something like
a giant vacuum cleaner," he said.
Tossed around inside the intake, Edson fractured his
spine and received severe liver lacerations. The vacuum
inside the intake collapsed his lungs.
