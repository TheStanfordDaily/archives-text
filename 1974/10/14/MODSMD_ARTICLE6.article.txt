### 
Crew For Women?
Editor:
The two recent Daily articles
concerning the Stanford Crew
were both apparently written
from the women's point of view.
As a competing member of the
team, I feel obligated to describe
our status accurately.
The Stanford Crew is a club
sport. As such, it is separate from
the Athletic Department and is
run by its participating members.
We receive $4500 each year from
the University. Last year, with
alumni donations, our total
income was about $9OOO, not
even enough to cover our
maintenance and travel expenses.
We have no money to pay our
coaches or purchase new racing
shells. We pay (out of our own
pockets) much of our travelling
budget, which includes away races
and daily trips to the boathouse,
which was built in Redwood City
by Stanford oarsmen with
Stanford 'funds. All of this
requires a large time commitment
beyond the amount devoted to
workouts and conditioning. Only
through this extra effort have we
been able to compete successfully
with teams whose budgets are
much larger than ours.
The women are certainly
justified in wanting their own
rowing program. But they are
unrealistic to think that they can
have it on the spur of the
moment. The men are in the
middle of a full program run by
people who have invested much
time over the past one to three
years, and it is unfair to ask us to
sacrifice these years of
commitment to a program unless
we can be assured that the
women's program will be
self-sufficient, financially stable,
and active. The women will have
to find solid financial support,
since half of the allocation to the
men, $2250, would be insufficient
to develop a competitive program.
They will also have to find
someone to donate a year's time
to coaching. Neither of these
problems will be solved overnight.
I am not saying I am against a
women's crew. I honestly believe
that they would benefit our crew
association and rowing in general.
But I would like to see a women's
program initiated in such away
that it will survive and not fizzle
out due to hasty organization.

Rascism Ignored?
Editor:
I read with interest John
Blundell's article "Powell:
Britain's New Messiah?" (Daily
Oct. 9.) I was more than slightly
surprised that the only reference
to Powell's extremely racist views
on non-white immigration was "a
series of controversial speeches on
immigration." To me this is the
same as someone writing about

George Wallace's politics anc
making a passing mention to his
"controversial views on race."
Does Mr. Blundell consider
Powell's racist views unimportant?

In his October 11th Daily
article entitled "Few Women
Chosen For Faculty Here", Bob
Lowe did not write of one
important analysis which I
presented at the Faculty Senate.
That analysis showed that
advanced degree award statistics
imply that women appointees
could be expected to form 13.5%,
9.9% and 10.4% of the new
faculty appointees of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, the
School of Medicine, and the
University, respectively. The
actual percentages of new
appointees who are women are
15.2%, 14.3% and 12.2%,
respectively. Thus, one or two
more women were appointed than
would have been anticipated on
the basis of the advanced degree
statistics. It was this analysis
which led me to conclude that we
appear to have achieved a
situation in which women have
true equal opportunity in the
appointment process.

Housing Proposal
Editor:
I would like to protest the
tentative OK given the new Row
houses. I know the place they are
thinking of building them. I
would rather see concrete there.
The University should consider
limiting expansion. From my
understanding, for each of the last
three years fifty high school
students have accepted and have
attended Stanford that weren't
expected to accept or to attend.
Has the Admissions Office
considered revising their statistics?
Has the Admissions Office
considered using waiting lists
instead of statistics? Has the
Administration considered
stabilizing enrollment?
If enrollment did stabilize,
there would be no need for new
housing. The money allocated for
new housing could be used to
improve present residences and
replace old ones. And if a housing
crunch did reoccur, I think it
would be «a neat idea to try
subsidizing professors and
administrators who board
students.
I realize that these suggestions
are old hat to whomever it is who
considers the options, but I would
appreciate feedback about why
the suggestions were rejected.

In his October 11th Daily
article entitled "Few Women
Chosen For Faculty Here", Bob
Lowe did not write of one
important analysis which I
presented at the Faculty Senate.
That analysis showed that
advanced degree award statistics
imply that women appointees
could be expected to form 13.5%,
9.9% and 10.4% of the new
faculty appointees of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, the
School of Medicine, and the
University, respectively. The
actual percentages of new
appointees who are women are
15.2%, 14.3% and 12.2%,
respectively. Thus, one or two
more women were appointed than
would have been anticipated on
the basis of the advanced degree
statistics. It was this analysis
which led me to conclude that we
appear to have achieved a
situation in which women have
true equal opportunity in the
appointment process.

Housing Proposal
Editor:
I would like to protest the
tentative OK given the new Row
houses. I know the place they are
thinking of building them. I
would rather see concrete there.
The University should consider
limiting expansion. From my
understanding, for each of the last
three years fifty high school
students have accepted and have
attended Stanford that weren't
expected to accept or to attend.
Has the Admissions Office
considered revising their statistics?
Has the Admissions Office
considered using waiting lists
instead of statistics? Has the
Administration considered
stabilizing enrollment?
If enrollment did stabilize,
there would be no need for new
housing. The money allocated for
new housing could be used to
improve present residences and
replace old ones. And if a housing
crunch did reoccur, I think it
would be «a neat idea to try
subsidizing professors and
administrators who board
students.
I realize that these suggestions
are old hat to whomever it is who
considers the options, but I would
appreciate feedback about why
the suggestions were rejected.

Crew For Women?
Editor:
The two recent Daily articles
concerning the Stanford Crew
were both apparently written
from the women's point of view.
As a competing member of the
team, I feel obligated to describe
our status accurately.
The Stanford Crew is a club
sport. As such, it is separate from
the Athletic Department and is
run by its participating members.
We receive $4500 each year from
the University. Last year, with
alumni donations, our total
income was about $9OOO, not
even enough to cover our
maintenance and travel expenses.
We have no money to pay our
coaches or purchase new racing
shells. We pay (out of our own
pockets) much of our travelling
budget, which includes away races
and daily trips to the boathouse,
which was built in Redwood City
by Stanford oarsmen with
Stanford 'funds. All of this
requires a large time commitment
beyond the amount devoted to
workouts and conditioning. Only
through this extra effort have we
been able to compete successfully
with teams whose budgets are
much larger than ours.
The women are certainly
justified in wanting their own
rowing program. But they are
unrealistic to think that they can
have it on the spur of the
moment. The men are in the
middle of a full program run by
people who have invested much
time over the past one to three
years, and it is unfair to ask us to
sacrifice these years of
commitment to a program unless
we can be assured that the
women's program will be
self-sufficient, financially stable,
and active. The women will have
to find solid financial support,
since half of the allocation to the
men, $2250, would be insufficient
to develop a competitive program.
They will also have to find
someone to donate a year's time
to coaching. Neither of these
problems will be solved overnight.
I am not saying I am against a
women's crew. I honestly believe
that they would benefit our crew
association and rowing in general.
But I would like to see a women's
program initiated in such away
that it will survive and not fizzle
out due to hasty organization.

team, I feel obligated to describe
our status accurately.
The Stanford Crew is a club
sport. As such, it is separate from
the Athletic Department and is
run by its participating members.
We receive $4500 each year from
the University. Last year, with
alumni donations, our total
income was about $9OOO, not
even enough to cover our
maintenance and travel expenses.
We have no money to pay our
coaches or purchase new racing
shells. We pay (out of our own
pockets) much of our travelling
budget, which includes away races
and daily trips to the boathouse,
which was built in Redwood City
by Stanford oarsmen with
Stanford 'funds. All of this
requires a large time commitment
beyond the amount devoted to
workouts and conditioning. Only
through this extra effort have we
been able to compete successfully
with teams whose budgets are
much larger than ours.
The women are certainly
justified in wanting their own
rowing program. But they are
unrealistic to think that they can
have it on the spur of the
moment. The men are in the
middle of a full program run by
people who have invested much
time over the past one to three
years, and it is unfair to ask us to
sacrifice these years of
commitment to a program unless
we can be assured that the
women's program will be
self-sufficient, financially stable,
and active. The women will have
to find solid financial support,
since half of the allocation to the
men, $2250, would be insufficient
to develop a competitive program.
They will also have to find
someone to donate a year's time
to coaching. Neither of these
problems will be solved overnight.
I am not saying I am against a
women's crew. I honestly believe
that they would benefit our crew
association and rowing in general.
But I would like to see a women's
program initiated in such away
that it will survive and not fizzle
out due to hasty organization.

Rascism Ignored?
Editor:
I read with interest John
Blundell's article "Powell:
Britain's New Messiah?" (Daily
Oct. 9.) I was more than slightly
surprised that the only reference
to Powell's extremely racist views
on non-white immigration was "a
series of controversial speeches on
immigration." To me this is the
same as someone writing about

George Wallace's politics anc
making a passing mention to his
"controversial views on race."
Does Mr. Blundell consider
Powell's racist views unimportant?

In his October 11th Daily
article entitled "Few Women
Chosen For Faculty Here", Bob
Lowe did not write of one
important analysis which I
presented at the Faculty Senate.
That analysis showed that
advanced degree award statistics
imply that women appointees
could be expected to form 13.5%,
9.9% and 10.4% of the new
faculty appointees of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, the
School of Medicine, and the
University, respectively. The
actual percentages of new
appointees who are women are
15.2%, 14.3% and 12.2%,
respectively. Thus, one or two
more women were appointed than
would have been anticipated on
the basis of the advanced degree
statistics. It was this analysis
which led me to conclude that we
appear to have achieved a
situation in which women have
true equal opportunity in the
appointment process.

Housing Proposal
Editor:
I would like to protest the
tentative OK given the new Row
houses. I know the place they are
thinking of building them. I
would rather see concrete there.
The University should consider
limiting expansion. From my
understanding, for each of the last
three years fifty high school
students have accepted and have
attended Stanford that weren't
expected to accept or to attend.
Has the Admissions Office
considered revising their statistics?
Has the Admissions Office
considered using waiting lists
instead of statistics? Has the
Administration considered
stabilizing enrollment?
If enrollment did stabilize,
there would be no need for new
housing. The money allocated for
new housing could be used to
improve present residences and
replace old ones. And if a housing
crunch did reoccur, I think it
would be «a neat idea to try
subsidizing professors and
administrators who board
students.
I realize that these suggestions
are old hat to whomever it is who
considers the options, but I would
appreciate feedback about why
the suggestions were rejected.
