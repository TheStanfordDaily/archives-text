If You're Concerned
About The
Energy Crisis...
We've Got Something
In Common.
We saw it coming and we saw it as a challenge. That's why we're
involved in a number of major projects to find/develop
new and supplemental sources of supply, includ
ing coal gasification; importation of liquefied | |
natural gas from Alaska, Africa and Russia; ,1 i
massive hydro-fracing to accelerate produc- I
tion from tight, gas-bearing*strata. If you I HjflL | I
see the energy problem as a challenge, J i
then we have something to talk about. Jfl
(We are an equal opportunity employer,

ful work opportunities for minority and
