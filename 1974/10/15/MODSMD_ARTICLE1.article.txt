Acting ASSU Elections
Commissioner Tom Fitzgerald
yesterday disqualified five candidates
in the ASSU Senate election last'
Thursday for campaign violations.
The five included two candidates,
Chip Underwood and Derek Toliver,
who had tentatively finished in the top
10 and thereby been elected to the
Senate. Final results are pending until
votes from overseas campuses arrive.
"I will recommend their
disqualification to the Senate and the
Senate will act on it," said Fitzgerald.
He indicated the Senate can uphold or
overturn his decision.
"I would hope that they would
support my position because the acts
were apparent violations of the rules
handed to the candidates and it
wouldn't be fair to other candidates if
they were overlooked," he said.
Illegal Acts
Fitzgerald said the five "were being
disqualified specifically for hanging
campaign literature in unauthorized
locations like the Bookstore,
classrooms and trees."
Underwood said he was being
disqualified for hanging a sign from a
tree.
"I haven't decided if I will appeal.
There are some things to check out?"
he said. Toliver indicated he "would
appeal.

Besides Underwood and Toliver,
Chip Weiland, Pete Truex and Louis
Montoya were disqualified.
Other Disqualifications?
Fitzgerald warned that more
candidates might be disqualified if
they did not comply with campaign
rules dictating the removal and
cleanup of campaign literature and
posters by the second Friday after the
election.
If the Underwood and Toliver
disqualifications are upheld by the
Senate, Tim Conway and Debbi Silton,
the next largest vote getters, would
tentatively be elected.
"It will be a very interesting
finish," said Fitzgerald noting that
Conway held only a four-vote lead
over Silton who held a slim lead
herself. Overseas votes are expected
late in the week.
Senate Meeting Postponed
The ASSU Senate meeting
scheduled for tonight was postponed
one week while final election results
were determined.
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer
said the new Senate— minus the
candidates disqualified by Fitzgerald
would vote to uphold or overturn the
decision to disqualify them.
Mayer said he did not know of any
previous election in which candidates
were disqualified.
