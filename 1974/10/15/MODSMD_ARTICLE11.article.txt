# Hayek's Theory Of Depressions
## 
### Bill Evers 
On Oct. 9 the Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economic Science was awarded jointly to
Friedrich A. von Hayek and Gunnar Myrdal.
Because Hayek's work in economics,
especially his analysis of inflation and
depression, is less well known in the U.S.
than Myrdal's work, this column will
concentrate on Hayek's contribution.
Hayek brought the "Austrian School"
theory of the business cycle (inflation and
depression; boom and bust) to the
English-speaking world when he came from
Vienna to teach at the London School of
Economics in the early 19305.
Hayek was "one of the few experts to
predict the economic crash of 1929," as the
New York Times correctly noted in reporting
on his Nobel Prize, and in the 1930s Hayek
and his fellow Austrian Ludwig von Mises
propounded a theory of depressions that was
catching on with young English and
American economists.
But after the publication of Lord Keynes'
General Theory in 1936, the Keynesian
paradigm came to dominate the economics
profession. The Austrian paradigm, which
had never been refuted successfully, was
neglected and forgotten after the onset of
Keynesian hegemony.
Hayek's business cycle theory is called
"Austrian" because it grows directly out of
the theoretical tradition developed by
economists like Menger, Wieser,
Boehm-Bawerk, and Mises, all of whom were
from Austria.
Divergence
It is usually described as the "monetary
over-investment" theory because it traces the
business cycle to a divergence between the

market rate of interest ii practice and the
natural rate of interest.

Hayek is following economist Knut
Wickesell in distinguishig between the
"money rate" or actual 'market rate of
interest" as influenced bybank action and
government monetary poby on the one
hand and the "natural rat of interest" on
the other. The natural rati was defined by
Wicksell as "that rate at wich the demand
for loan capital just equa the supply of
savings."
As Gottfriend Haberler rtes, the central
theme of all over-invesnent theories,
including Hayek's, is the oveilevelopment of
industries which produce proicers' goods or
capital goods in relation to industries
producing consumers' goods.
The principal intruding eleent, according
to Hayek, in the otherise smoothly
functioning market system i the tendency
toward elasticity in the edit system of
fractional-reserve banking. Cret is expanded
by banks if, as Mises at Murray N.
Rothbard have emphasized, le government
imposes a banking system i which 100
percent reservers are not mntained. The
credit expansion keeps the :tual rate of
interest on the market below le natural rate
of interest.
Elasticity
The "elasticity of the volume of
circulating money" enables cital (that is,
investments in producers' pds for
example, in machines that mal final goods
for consumers) to be formed tich cannot
maintain its value.
As wages are bid up uring the
inflationary period, the wageurners will

spend on consumption. They will reassert the
natural proportion between producers' goods
and consumers' goods the proportion that
existed before the credit expansion artifically
raised the demand for producers' goods while
not really diminishing the demand for
consumers' goods.
As this situation of malinvestment is
revealed an economic crisis ensues. Runs on
the banks may occur as their customers lose
confidence in the overextended banks'ability
to return deposits.
Unprofitable Investments

The money rate of interest will, in
Hayek's words, "rise again to its natural level
and thus render unprofitable (temporarily, at
least) those investments which were created
with the aid of additional credit." Thus,
Hayek believes that during the "bust" period
of the cycle, the system is properly
liquidating the malinvestments made on the
basis of wrong signals sent to businessmen by
the artificial credit expansion. The depression
is a period of necessary readjustment.
What is the policy prescription that
follows if Austrian theory is right and one
then wishes to avoid depressions and
inflations? The correct policy is adherance to
the gold standard to inhibit government
inflation of money supply; 100 percent
reserve banking to prevent artificial credit
expansion; and absolutely no government
intervention in the economy during
depressions, otherwise the depression will
deepen and be prolonged instead of being a
short readjustment period.
