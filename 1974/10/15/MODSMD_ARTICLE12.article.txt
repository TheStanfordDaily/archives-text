# On British Politics And Character
## 
### John Blundell 
The British are probably the
most difficult people in the world
to understand. We have no written
constitution and Noel Coward
equated us with mad dogs. We
spend all our time abroad
explaining the rules of cricket to
the natives and air our time at
home talking about the weather.
The British Broadcasting
Company recently launched a TV
series on how foreign residents in
the United Kingdom view us. The
timing of the program has been
rather unfortunate just after
pub closing time on Sunday night
and the program has come close
to being interpreted as a comedy
by the viewing public.
Politically, we have the Mother
of Parliaments, a rectangular
affair, whose members have a
particularly high divorce rate. The
rectangular shape of the House of
Commons along with our- simple
majority voting system is blamed
by many for our predominantly
two-party system. Although there
is no gap in the spectrum of
opinions, the fact that the
Government faces the Opposition
does lead to a great deal of
polarization.
This does not deter other
parties from putting up
candidates. In the recent General
Election, approximately 50
different parties fielded
candidates. Only two parties had a
chance of forming the new
government and only another half
dozen will have representatives at
Westminster.
Small Groups
Aside from the Liberals, Welsh,
Scottish and Ulster parties the
most prominent small group is the
National Front. Formed in the
late 60s by a coalition of the
British National Party and the
League of Empire Loyalists, they
have recently achieved some
respectability. Gone are the days
of Trafalgar Square
demonstrations when Colin

Jordan, the "Fuehrer of Great
Britain," praised Hitler and
vilified the Jews while his
supporters chanted , "Sieg Heil"
and "Juden Raus."

In February, the Front fielded
54 candidates and polled 75,000
votes. This time they had 90
candidates standing under the
slogan of "Make Britain GREAT
again," its main policies being to
leave the European Common
Market, repatriate immigrants and
get tough with unions and
criminals.
For Tory leader Heath, the
most embarassing fringe party is
an Independent Mrs. Thatcher
For Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher
being the former Conservative
Education Minister. They fought
only one seat Bexley and
Sidcup Heath's own! Mr. Heath,
however, is used to strange
opposition. In the '7O election an
imaginative candidate changed his
name by deed poll to E.R.G.
Heath and stood as an
Independent Conservative against
the real E.R.G. Heath, Official
Conservative.
The growing number of
Independent Labour candidates is
causing a certain amount of worry
at Transport House, the Labour
Headquarters. First Dick Taverne
and then Eddie Milne resigned
from the Labour Party and were
successfully returned as
independent socialists. On the far
left, the most famous of the
candidates was actress Vanessa
Redgrave who stood in North East
London for the Workers
Revolutionary Party. But she won
only 575 votes while the Labour
candidate garnered 22,000.
To continentals, the strangest
facet of our electoral system is
that one does not have to have
any connection with a
constituency to become one of its
parliamentary candidates, and one
can stand in any number of
constituencies at the same time.

Tom KeCand Charles Deakin
have forri the Campaign for a
More Pr>erous Britain and
together iy stand in over 20
seats arouithe country shades
of Marsh; Boulanger and the
French 3rtepublic, except that
whereas lilanger won nearly
half the se in France, Keen and
Deakin rtainly lost their
deposit in iry seat (i.e. 10,000
dollars in.otal). In Britain,
anyone caiun for Parliament,
but he lost small deposit if he
fails to least one-eighth of
the vote.
Wjd Dollars
One oft wonders why so
many pee throw away
thousands dollars to collect a
handful of > s . After all, even if
by some fli chance they were
victorious t would find the
hours appal and the working
conditions daceful.

The motivation of small party
candidates seems to be based
around one issue which is very
important to the individuals
concerned. In Essex, the People
and Agrarian Party consists of two
retired gentleman who are
disturbed about the Compulsory
Purchase order , scheme under
which Local Authorities can buy
any land they want. Women's
Rights, the environment and
immigration are ideal issues for
the small party, while the old
chestnut of putting the "great"
back into Britain is not the sole
prerogative of the National Front.
Even the big two adopted
similar slogans: "Britain will win
with Labour" and "Put Britain
First." It will be fascinating to see
now whether or not Britain really
will win with Labour.

For Tory leader Heath, the
most embarassing fringe party is
an Independent Mrs. Thatcher
For Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher
being the former Conservative
Education Minister. They fought
only one seat Bexley and
Sidcup Heath's own! Mr. Heath,
however, is used to strange
opposition. In the '7O election an
imaginative candidate changed his
name by deed poll to E.R.G.
Heath and stood as an
Independent Conservative against
the real E.R.G. Heath, Official
Conservative.
The growing number of
Independent Labour candidates is
causing a certain amount of worry
at Transport House, the Labour
Headquarters. First Dick Taverne
and then Eddie Milne resigned
from the Labour Party and were
successfully returned as
independent socialists. On the far
left, the most famous of the
candidates was actress Vanessa
Redgrave who stood in North East
London for the Workers
Revolutionary Party. But she won
only 575 votes while the Labour
candidate garnered 22,000.
To continentals, the strangest
facet of our electoral system is
that one does not have to have
any connection with a
constituency to become one of its
parliamentary candidates, and one
can stand in any number of
constituencies at the same time.

Tom KeCand Charles Deakin
have forri the Campaign for a
More Pr>erous Britain and
together iy stand in over 20
seats arouithe country shades
of Marsh; Boulanger and the
French 3rtepublic, except that
whereas lilanger won nearly
half the se in France, Keen and
Deakin rtainly lost their
deposit in iry seat (i.e. 10,000
dollars in.otal). In Britain,
anyone caiun for Parliament,
but he lost small deposit if he
fails to least one-eighth of
the vote.
Wjd Dollars
One oft wonders why so
many pee throw away
thousands dollars to collect a
handful of > s . After all, even if
by some fli chance they were
victorious t would find the
hours appal and the working
conditions daceful.

The motivation of small party
candidates seems to be based
around one issue which is very
important to the individuals
concerned. In Essex, the People
and Agrarian Party consists of two
retired gentleman who are
disturbed about the Compulsory
Purchase order , scheme under
which Local Authorities can buy
any land they want. Women's
Rights, the environment and
immigration are ideal issues for
the small party, while the old
chestnut of putting the "great"
back into Britain is not the sole
prerogative of the National Front.
Even the big two adopted
similar slogans: "Britain will win
with Labour" and "Put Britain
First." It will be fascinating to see
now whether or not Britain really
will win with Labour.

London School of Economics.)
The British are probably the
most difficult people in the world
to understand. We have no written
constitution and Noel Coward
equated us with mad dogs. We
spend all our time abroad
explaining the rules of cricket to
the natives and air our time at
home talking about the weather.
The British Broadcasting
Company recently launched a TV
series on how foreign residents in
the United Kingdom view us. The
timing of the program has been
rather unfortunate just after
pub closing time on Sunday night
and the program has come close
to being interpreted as a comedy
by the viewing public.
Politically, we have the Mother
of Parliaments, a rectangular
affair, whose members have a
particularly high divorce rate. The
rectangular shape of the House of
Commons along with our- simple
majority voting system is blamed
by many for our predominantly
two-party system. Although there
is no gap in the spectrum of
opinions, the fact that the
Government faces the Opposition
does lead to a great deal of
polarization.
This does not deter other
parties from putting up
candidates. In the recent General
Election, approximately 50
different parties fielded
candidates. Only two parties had a
chance of forming the new
government and only another half
dozen will have representatives at
Westminster.
Small Groups
Aside from the Liberals, Welsh,
Scottish and Ulster parties the
most prominent small group is the
National Front. Formed in the
late 60s by a coalition of the
British National Party and the
League of Empire Loyalists, they
have recently achieved some
respectability. Gone are the days
of Trafalgar Square
demonstrations when Colin

Jordan, the "Fuehrer of Great
Britain," praised Hitler and
vilified the Jews while his
supporters chanted , "Sieg Heil"
and "Juden Raus."

In February, the Front fielded
54 candidates and polled 75,000
votes. This time they had 90
candidates standing under the
slogan of "Make Britain GREAT
again," its main policies being to
leave the European Common
Market, repatriate immigrants and
get tough with unions and
criminals.

candidates seems to be based
around one issue which is very
important to the individuals
concerned. In Essex, the People
and Agrarian Party consists of two
retired gentleman who are
disturbed about the Compulsory
Purchase order , scheme under
which Local Authorities can buy
any land they want. Women's
Rights, the environment and
immigration are ideal issues for
the small party, while the old
chestnut of putting the "great"
back into Britain is not the sole
prerogative of the National Front.
Even the big two adopted
similar slogans: "Britain will win
with Labour" and "Put Britain
First." It will be fascinating to see
now whether or not Britain really
will win with Labour.

The British are probably the
most difficult people in the world
to understand. We have no written
constitution and Noel Coward
equated us with mad dogs. We
spend all our time abroad
explaining the rules of cricket to
the natives and air our time at
home talking about the weather.
The British Broadcasting
Company recently launched a TV
series on how foreign residents in
the United Kingdom view us. The
timing of the program has been
rather unfortunate just after
pub closing time on Sunday night
and the program has come close
to being interpreted as a comedy
by the viewing public.
Politically, we have the Mother
of Parliaments, a rectangular
affair, whose members have a
particularly high divorce rate. The
rectangular shape of the House of
Commons along with our- simple
majority voting system is blamed
by many for our predominantly
two-party system. Although there
is no gap in the spectrum of
opinions, the fact that the
Government faces the Opposition
does lead to a great deal of
polarization.
This does not deter other
parties from putting up
candidates. In the recent General
Election, approximately 50
different parties fielded
candidates. Only two parties had a
chance of forming the new
government and only another half
dozen will have representatives at
Westminster.
Small Groups
Aside from the Liberals, Welsh,
Scottish and Ulster parties the
most prominent small group is the
National Front. Formed in the
late 60s by a coalition of the
British National Party and the
League of Empire Loyalists, they
have recently achieved some
respectability. Gone are the days
of Trafalgar Square
demonstrations when Colin

Jordan, the "Fuehrer of Great
Britain," praised Hitler and
vilified the Jews while his
supporters chanted , "Sieg Heil"
and "Juden Raus."

In February, the Front fielded
54 candidates and polled 75,000
votes. This time they had 90
candidates standing under the
slogan of "Make Britain GREAT
again," its main policies being to
leave the European Common
Market, repatriate immigrants and
get tough with unions and
criminals.
For Tory leader Heath, the
most embarassing fringe party is
an Independent Mrs. Thatcher
For Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher
being the former Conservative
Education Minister. They fought
only one seat Bexley and
Sidcup Heath's own! Mr. Heath,
however, is used to strange
opposition. In the '7O election an
imaginative candidate changed his
name by deed poll to E.R.G.
Heath and stood as an
Independent Conservative against
the real E.R.G. Heath, Official
Conservative.
The growing number of
Independent Labour candidates is
causing a certain amount of worry
at Transport House, the Labour
Headquarters. First Dick Taverne
and then Eddie Milne resigned
from the Labour Party and were
successfully returned as
independent socialists. On the far
left, the most famous of the
candidates was actress Vanessa
Redgrave who stood in North East
London for the Workers
Revolutionary Party. But she won
only 575 votes while the Labour
candidate garnered 22,000.
To continentals, the strangest
facet of our electoral system is
that one does not have to have
any connection with a
constituency to become one of its
parliamentary candidates, and one
can stand in any number of
constituencies at the same time.

Tom KeCand Charles Deakin
have forri the Campaign for a
More Pr>erous Britain and
together iy stand in over 20
seats arouithe country shades
of Marsh; Boulanger and the
French 3rtepublic, except that
whereas lilanger won nearly
half the se in France, Keen and
Deakin rtainly lost their
deposit in iry seat (i.e. 10,000
dollars in.otal). In Britain,
anyone caiun for Parliament,
but he lost small deposit if he
fails to least one-eighth of
the vote.
Wjd Dollars
One oft wonders why so
many pee throw away
thousands dollars to collect a
handful of > s . After all, even if
by some fli chance they were
victorious t would find the
hours appal and the working
conditions daceful.
