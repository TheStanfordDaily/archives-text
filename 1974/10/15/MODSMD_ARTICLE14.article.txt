Bias Charged
Editor:
I would like to make some
comments about the coverage of
the Joan Baez concert in the
article "Joan Baez Blends Politics,
Music, Style" (Daily, Oct. 8).
Joan Baez spoke with an equal
amount of force about the
farmworkers and then sang the
song "De Colores," but the writer
gives no coverage of this in the
article, and does write about
Argentina. Is this because the
issue of stoop labor, and poor
wages the farmworker who
picks your food is too close to
home to cover in the newspaper,
and Argentina is far enough away
to make reference to?
In an article entitled "Joan
Baez Blends Politics, Music,
Style" there should be full
coverage of the politics of
something so obvious as the
farmworker issue. The only
organized political faction at the
concert was the United
Farmworkers (UFW) Support
Committee with our "Boycott
Grapes, Lettuce and Gallo Wines"
picket signs at the gates, and our
red, union flags we waved gently
as she sang our song "De
Colores."

The news coverage of a "good"
newspaper should be unbiased,
therefore we look forward to
better coverage in the future for
the benefit and education of all
Stanford students and readers of
the Daily.

Was Music Stolen?
Editor:
Glenn Garvin seems to have
missed the point in his letter
objecting to Joan Hinman's
statement that whites stole 50s
rock V roll from blacks.
"Doing another version of a
song does not constitute theft" as
long as proper royalties are paid
to composers. White artists, in
hundreds failed to and still fail
to pay royalties to black
composers whose songs they
covered. The most obvious, and
probably most famous example is
that of Arthur Crudup, composer
of "That's Alright, Mama," and
"My Baby Left Me" (among many
others), songs which helped
launch Elvis Presley's career, and
songs for which Presley, with his
millions, failed to pay Crudup
(who died penniless last March) a
cent.
You can be sure that when
Peter, Paul and Mary recorded
"Blowin' in the Wind," that
Albert Grossman, Dylan's
manager, saw to it that Dylan got
every cent that was coming to
him. Colonel Parker didn't show
quite that kind of concern for
Crudup, I'm afraid. Have Jtfre
crossed the boundaries of 'your
definition of theft yet, Mr.
Garvin?

Black music got airplay on
"black" AM radio stations; it was
not programmed on "white"
stations primarily because of the
conservative musical ideas of
those in control of the stations,
ideas which sometimes bordered
on fear. It was not until these
stations, and the major,
white-oriented record companies
realized that there was a bit of
money to be made from blues and
rock that they gave it the
attention it deserved.
There are literally hundreds of
black artists with stories similar to
Crudup's: Robert Wilkins, St.
Louis Jimmy, Howling Wolf, Big
Mama Thornton, Leadbelly,
Mississippi John Hurt, Professor
Longhair, etc.
It would be useless, I think, to
argue about whether Peter
Townsend's or Robin Trower's
(and who do you think he sounds
like?) guitar-playing is a "cultural
advance" on that of Muddy
Waters or Hubert Sumlin or even
8.8. King. But both in terms of
general feeling as well as in
specific musical and lyrical
content, the foundations of rock
'n' roll are essentially and
fundamentally blues, and rhythm
and blues. Whites certainly made
adaptations and contributions
major ones but we also made
most of the money and to judge
by recent comments continue
to try to make off with the
musical credit as well.
Even though much of this may
have been legally sanctioned, I'm
afraid, Mr. Garvin, that we must
rightfully call it theft.
