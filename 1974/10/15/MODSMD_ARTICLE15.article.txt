## A 						Viet Vet Adapts To Paraplegia 
### BOB LOWE Second of Three Parts 
The Army drafted Russ Paige seven years ago, trained
him to be a helicopter pilot and sent him to fight in
Vietnam.
Five years ago Paige returned home a paraplegic
paralyzed from the waist down as a result of a
helicopter crash.
For a time Paige was bitter and blamed everything from
himself to the war for his fate. He even blamed the
mechanics whose job it was to service the helicopter
engine that failed.
Now Paige accepts his fate stoically. "I knew the risks
even before I went to Vietnam," he says.
He has adjusted fairly well to life in a wheelchair. He
lives alone in a big white frame house in Hayward and
takes care of himself. •
Outpatient
Paige, 33, vis one of several thousand Vietnam veterans
who returned from the war paraylzed. He is one of 53
outpatients at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration
Hospital's new Spinal Cord Injury Center and visits the
center about once a week for treatment of a kidney
ailment.
Paige is a large man with big arms and shoulders which
have developed through the years of reliance on his upper
body. He is good looking with strong features that go well
with his shaved head. His words and carriage speak of a
fiercely independent man who wants to rely on no one but

himself.
Paige's house has no special devices to make life easier
for him, aside from a hydraulic lift which raises him the
seven feet from ground level to his porch.
This wasn't always the case. "At one time I went the
whole route," Paige says. "I had a raised toilet and
everything."
Unneeded Devices
But Paige found he didn't need the extra help and some
of the devices were inconvenient for his guests so he kept
only the lift which allows him access to the house.
Paige has no particular love for he Army, nor does he
blame it for his injury. But he feels the Vietnam War was a
"complete waste of money" and that it was fought out of
economic motivations.
In 1969 Paige was piloting a Cobra helicopter gunship
and flying cover for a small reconnaissance copter.
One of his engines failed and Paige had to crash.
Because he was the helicopter's commander Paige decided
to give his co-pilot, who sat in front of him, the better
chance for survival.
The copter hit the ground tail first. Paige fractured his
spine, paralyzing him for life, and his co-pilot suffered
spinal shock from which he later recovered.
Strapped In
"I was strapped into my seat and I saw a patch of grass
somewhere underneath me so I tried to get out," Paige
recalls.
"I undid my seat belt and tried to get out but I

couldn't. I figured my foot must be caught so I looked
down but it was free."
It was then that Paige started thinking that he was
paralyzed. He knew he couldn't move anything below his
waist but he didn't know if the paralysis was permanent.
A few weeks later he was in an Army hospital in Japan.
"In Japan a doctor told me, 'By the way, you're never
going to walk again, I guess they told you that,' " Paige
says. "They hadn't told me anything befdre that."
Purple Heart
Paige says that while he was injured, he had to fight for
the Purple Heart he felt he deserved.
"There I was lying cut in half and they didn't want to
give it to me because it was an engine malfunction," he
says. "They gave it to other guys who cut their fingers
doing K.P."
Characteristically, Paige made enough noise so that he
got his Purple Heart.
Paige recuperated in a spinal cord injury center in Long
Beach, California where he made the physical adjustments
necessary to lead an independent life. But when he left the
center the adjustment process began all over again.
'Much Longer'
"People at the V.A. say it takes a year to adjust," he
says. "It takes much longer than that. You can function
after a year but the adjustment really begins when you get
out."
"You have to get so that you can just go up to people
and talk with them while they're standing up and you're
sitting down."
Paige said that he is "rehabilitated" in his own
definition of the word because he "doesn't think of
himself as being different."
He views the adjustment process he has made as similar
to the adjustment everyone must make when they realize
their limitations.
Acceptance
"Everyone has to accept their niche in society. I've
learned to accept mine just like everyone else," he says.
But Paige said that being in a wheelchair requires a
different kind of thinking. "I feel sorry for people in
wheelchairs because they can't take things seriously
without ending up in a psychiatric ward," he says.
Paige explained that those who are paralyzed "don't
look at things absolutely."
"If I were to say that walking was normal, I would have
to admit to myself that I'm abnormal. The walking world
just isn't my world."
% Helpful
The public generally is very helpful to Paige. Of those
who are afraid of him because he's in a wheelchair, Paige
says, "I don't care about them anyway."
Occasionally, people are too helpful.
One old woman was so persistant in coming to Paige's
aid that he couldn't ward her off.
"She said, 'Sonny, let me help you,' and I couldn't stop
her from helping me put my wheelchair into my car," Paige
says. "She ended up screwing up the car and the chair."
Paige doesn't feel it necessary to work in order to
adjust to the rest of the world and he is content to live off
the pension he receives from the government.
Part of the money Paige receives is a $6O monthly
payment from the Army "because they assume I can't
have sex."
Just As Well
He indicated that paraplegics and quadriplegics are
overly concerned with their ability to have sex. "You can
satisfy a woman just as well .. . maybe even better," he
says.
Paige defends his independence fiercely and says he has
to keep his mother, who lives near by, from doing too
much for him. By choice he spends much of his time
alone.
In spite of his outward hardness, Paige seems to have
some regret for the way fate has guided his life.
He sits in front of his huge living room window that
looks out on a busy commercial street.
Folding his hands in front of him and resting his elbows
on the arms of his wheelchair, Paige contemplates the busy
wofld that scurries past beneath his feet.
