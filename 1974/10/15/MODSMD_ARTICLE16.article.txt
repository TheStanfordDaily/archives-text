Why are the windows in UGLY so dirty? When is the last time they
have been washed? —S.S.
Studying for hours in Meyer Library the bored student looks out
the window for a refreshing view of blue sky and green grass. All he
can see is scurrying people rushing through the murky film towards
massive buildings.
A plot by professors to make students see the world through
brown-colored glass so they will return to their books out of
desperation?
No, the problem is money. Becuase the windows are so high a
ladder can't reach them and a window washer needs to stand in a
cherry picker a truck with an hydraulic arm that can lift a person to
the windows, according to Phil Leighton, chief administrator in the
Main Library.
Andy Anderson, Plant Services grounds and custodial manager, said
the windows are only washed once every two years. According to his
chart, they were washed in 1972 so they should be washed again this
December.
When the reachable windows are washed, the window washers are
paid over $6 per hour and are given a premium of at least 25 cents per
hour if they work at heights over 18 feet.
John S. Lynd, an architect who helped design Meyer, said the
architects discussed window washing problems with University
administrators before the building plans were completed.
"Everybody knew what they were getting into," Lynd remarked.
He commented that the ramps and columns near the windows were
specifically constructed so a cherry picker could be maneuvered close,
to the building.
Lynd said operable windows would have been easier to wash but
also more expensive.
"It was a priority for dollars," he concluded.
Why must a guest pay $3 for a Food Service dinner when students
only receive 75 cents for missing the same meal? —H.S.
Again the answer is money. Uniyersity Food Service Manger
Maxine Anderson said high overhead and labor costs explain the cost
of a guest's meal.
She remarked that guests essentially pay for the cooks and utilities
which absorb more of the Food Service money than the actual food.
The rebate money, on the other hand, only,covers the cost of the.
food.
She noted that the Food Service only gives rebates for social
functions involving a minimum of 15 persons. She said the group must
notify the Food Service a week in advance to save the cost of buying
unnecessary food.
Asked if the students would receive a $3 rebate if they notified the
Food Service in advance to expect a large group of guests, Anderson
retorted, "You wouldn't expect a restaurant to change its prices,
would you?"
She added that the Food Service still loses money on the rebates,
they do give.
The only reason the Food Service gives them, Anderson said, is to
encourage group activities which are an integral part of the residential
education program.

Who ripped out the answer section in the back of the Chemistry 132
workbooks before the students bought them? Why did they do it?
-K.L.
Chemistry professors teaching the class, Leonard M. Stephenson
and Richard H. Eastman, asked the Bookstore to rip out the answers
in the back of Spectro Exercise In Structure Determination of
Organism Compounds, Bookstore textbook manager Jim Arnold said.
According to Eastman, the professors asked the publisher to
exclude the answer section in the book before the Bookstore received
them, but the publisher left the answers in some of the books.
"It was a real goof on the part of the publisher," Eastman
remarked.
Eastman explained that the answers "absolutely wipe out [the
possibility of] the student doing the problems oh his own."
Eastman said he realized many math books have the answers in the
back but he declared that chemistry answers are intrinsically different..
With chemistry problems, "once you see the answer you have the
solution," he said.
The purpose of the problem, he added, is to have the students find
the solutions on their own. Those students who bought books with
answers, will just be "educationally deprived," Eastman said.
