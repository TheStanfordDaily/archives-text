# Budget Cuts Endanger Detente, Zumwalt Says
## 
### JAN PEPPER 
Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt,
former U.S. chief of naval
operations, yesterday cautioned
against cutting the defense budget
so low that the U.S.-Soviet
detente becomes endangered.
Zumwalt, featured speaker at a
luncheon honoring emeritus
provost Frederick E. Terman,
voiced concern that "incentives
have not been brought along at a
pace necessary" for the U.S. to
get a better deal in the next round
of Strategic Arms Limitations
Talks (SALT).
Although in current dollars the
defense department is spending
more, "each year we have spent a
smaller fraction of the GNP on
defense," Zumwalt told the
audience at Rickey's Hyatt House.
'Hard-Headed'
Calling the Soviets
"hard-headed" in seeking to
further their national objective of
"remaking alliances throughout
the world," Zumwalt warned that
the Soviet policy may lead to
U.S.â€”Soviet confrontations.
He cited that the Russians have
reduced the number of
confrontations in Europe, but
instead aided the Arab attack of
Israel in October, 1973.
Although they were "not
brilliant enough to know how that
would come out," the Soviets
were quite content with the oil
embargo that resulted from the
1973 Mideast conflict, Zumwalt
contended.
Zumwalt said he hoped that

detente will produce the trade,
technological exchanges and
"patterns of behavior more in line
with our aspirations." But he
cautioned against further
congressional reductions in the
defense budget, urging "sufficient
support for defense programs so
detente can survive."
'Outstanding Service'
Terman, now adviser to
President Richard Lyman, was
honored for his "outstanding
service" to the electronics
industry and the community.
Jack Wheatley, president of the
Stanford Area Council of the Boy
Scouts, presented Terman with
the "Good Scout Award" in the
ceremonies sponsored by the
Peninsula electronics industry.
Former U.S. Deputy Secretary
of Defense David Packard called
Terman a "very great influence in
electronics engineering, not only
in Palo Alto and the United
States, but in other countries as
well.
"I owe a very great debt of
gratitude to Dr. Terman," said
Packard, a former University
trustee. Packard said Terman
encouraged him to establish the
multi-million dollar
Hewlett-Packard Company with
former University trustee William
Hewlett in 1939.
Terman joined the faculty here,
in 1925 as an electrical
engineering professor and retired
in 1965 as vice president and
provost.
His achievements include the
authorship of the first text in
electronics, Radio Engineering.
