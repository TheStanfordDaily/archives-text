# No Suspects Yet In Murder Case
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Sheriff's officials investigating the
Sunday murder of a student's
19-year-old wife said the slaying was
"probably committed by one person,"
but said they still have no prime
suspects in the case.
Meanwhile, a coroner's report
confirmed that Arlis Perry died as the
result of a knife would to the back of
the head. The body of Mrs. Perry,
newlywed wife of sophomore
premedical student Bruce Perry, was
discovered in Memorial Church by a
security guard who was opening the
church for Sunday services.
A Santa Clara County Sheriff's
spokesman told the Daily yesterday
that the case was "definitely a sex
murder," but said there is "no
evidence to support" theories and
media reports of a ritualistic "black
mass" slaying. Mrs. Perry was found
nude from the waist down, and had
been molested with two three-foot
altar candles. v
Stanford officials yesterday offered
a $lO,OOO reward for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of
Mrs. Perry's assailant, while sheriff's
officials and Stanford police continued
to check reports and possible leads in
the case.
Died Around Midnight
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said the Police Deartment
has received numerous calls from
people who think they may have seen
or heard something at the church
either late Saturday night or early
Sunday morning. The coroner's report
said Mrs. Perry died at about midnight.
Lt. James Burleson, heading the
sheriff's investigation, said it appeared
Mrs. Perry was killed at the scene
where her body was discovered,
although there was little blood there
because of the nature of the wound.
Bruise marks found on Mrs. Perry's
neck may also have been the result of
a strangulation attempt, another
county officer said.
Six sheriff's detectives were on
campus yesterday, and that number
may be increased today. The murder
weapon hasn't yet been found, and
police have described it only as "a

sharp narrow object."
Inconclusive
There were also still no indications
yesterday as to whether Mrs. Perry had
been raped and whether she was
molested before or after she died.
Preliminary autopsy results on those
questions were termed inconclusive.
Mrs. Perry had been reported
missing by her husband at 3 a.m. and
again at 6:55 a.m. Sunday. They had
parted company late Saturday night,
and Mrs. Perry apparently went to the
church to meditate, as she had done
previously.
At about 11:45 p.m., security
guard Steve Crawford of the Stanford
Police Department locked up the
church for the night. Niemeyer said
investigators now think both Mrs.
Perry and her assailant were inside the
church at the time.
"If you look at the layout of the
church, with all its alcoves and stairs
and lofts, it's certainly possible that
someone could easily stay inside" and
avoid detection by the guard,
Niemeyer said.
No Forced Entry
When Crawford returned at about
5:45 a.m., he found the door on the
west side of the church unlocked, with
no sign of forced entry. He found Mrs.
Perry's body at the rear of the east
transept of the church.
Investigators from both the county
sheriff's office and Stanford Police
Department have issued appeals to
anyone who might have seen or heard
anything at or near the church
between about 11:30 p.m. Saturday
and 5 a.m. Sunday. "We're asking
anyone who heard or saw anything, no
matter how insignificant it might have
seemed at the time, to contact us,"
Niemeyer said.
He asked people to contact
Stanford Lt. Walt Konar at 497-3444.
Sheriff's detectives also asked
friends familiar with Mrs. Perry's
behavior patterns to contact them at
either the Stanford Police number or
at 299-2211 in San Jose.
Dean of the Chapel Robert G. H.
Kelly also announced that memorial
services for Mrs. Perry will be held
tonight at 7:30 in Memorial Church.

because of the nature of the wound.
Bruise marks found on Mrs. Perry's
neck may also have been the result of
a strangulation attempt, another
county officer said.
Six sheriff's detectives were on
campus yesterday, and that number
may be increased today. The murder
weapon hasn't yet been found, and
police have described it only as "a

sharp narrow object."
Inconclusive
There were also still no indications
yesterday as to whether Mrs. Perry had
been raped and whether she was
molested before or after she died.
Preliminary autopsy results on those
questions were termed inconclusive.
Mrs. Perry had been reported
missing by her husband at 3 a.m. and
again at 6:55 a.m. Sunday. They had
parted company late Saturday night,
and Mrs. Perry apparently went to the
church to meditate, as she had done
previously.
At about 11:45 p.m., security
guard Steve Crawford of the Stanford
Police Department locked up the
church for the night. Niemeyer said
investigators now think both Mrs.
Perry and her assailant were inside the
church at the time.
"If you look at the layout of the
church, with all its alcoves and stairs
and lofts, it's certainly possible that
someone could easily stay inside" and
avoid detection by the guard,
Niemeyer said.
No Forced Entry
When Crawford returned at about
5:45 a.m., he found the door on the
west side of the church unlocked, with
no sign of forced entry. He found Mrs.
Perry's body at the rear of the east
transept of the church.
Investigators from both the county
sheriff's office and Stanford Police
Department have issued appeals to
anyone who might have seen or heard
anything at or near the church
between about 11:30 p.m. Saturday
and 5 a.m. Sunday. "We're asking
anyone who heard or saw anything, no
matter how insignificant it might have
seemed at the time, to contact us,"
Niemeyer said.
He asked people to contact
Stanford Lt. Walt Konar at 497-3444.
Sheriff's detectives also asked
friends familiar with Mrs. Perry's
behavior patterns to contact them at
either the Stanford Police number or
at 299-2211 in San Jose.
Dean of the Chapel Robert G. H.
Kelly also announced that memorial
services for Mrs. Perry will be held
tonight at 7:30 in Memorial Church.
