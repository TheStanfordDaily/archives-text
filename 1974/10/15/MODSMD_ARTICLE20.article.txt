## Laine Displays Awesome Singing 
### DAN FORTE 
Having never seen nor heard Cleo Laine perform, I was
a bit skeptical of the astronomical praises that seemingly
every review has lauded upon her.
How could anyone live up to such titles as "The
World's Greatest Voice," able to outsing a piano?
Now, having seen Cleo Laine's performance in
Memorial Auditorium, Thursday night, what can I possibly
say that will convince the other cynics as I was convinced?
In Awe
There are a great many performers whom I have seen,
enjoyed and admired, but only a very few that I was truly
in awe of. Off the top of my natural, I would name Duke
Ellington and Jimi Hendrix as "awesome talents" in
person.
Cleo Laine is now without a doubt a member of the
club. Keep in mind that everything I have and will say in
this article is n.ot exaggeration, but rather understatement.
Having heard only a finite number of singers up to this
point, I must limit myself to declaring Cleo Laine the best
all-around vocalist I've come across.
Unfamiliar With Dankworth
At this juncture, I must further humble myself by
confessing that before Thursday I hadn't heard John
Dankworth either, and, in fact, didn't know what
instrument he played. Laine and Dankworth's successes,
however huge, are a fairly recent phenomena to this
country.
Dankworth is in fact Cleo's husband (both are from
England), and an excellent clarinet-alto saxophonist.
His quartet preceeded Laine with "Here's That Rainy

Day," with Dankworth playing pure Charlie Parker in both
tone and phraseology.
Opener A Stand-Out
It would be useless for me to attempt to choose Miss
Laine's "best song." But, her opening tune, "Anyplace I
Hang My Hat," serving as my first introduction to her
voice, seems to stand out.
Beginning the song a capella Laine had the sell-out
crowd in the palm of her hand even before the band had
joined in. The very striking songstress has a stage presence
and emotional delivery that is totally convincing.
She can do just about anything with her multi-colored
voice, and was not afraid to show it off to the fullest. Her
range must be five octaves, but the best thing about her
miraculous ability is that it never sounds like vocal
gymnastics, it always helps the song.
The material covered in the two-part program ranged
from blues to Noel Coward to e.e. cummings. Most of it,
though, was jazz oriented.
Cleo Laine can take a song like Bacharach's "The World
Is A Circle," a perfectly inept piece of music, and make it
sound good. She could probably do the same if you
handed her an algebra text and said "sing it."
When singing along with her husband's sax, as on
"Birdsong," the clarity of their respectively beautiful
tones was uncanny.
Famous Jazz Songs
The jazz numbers included Duke's "Perdido,"
Gershwin's "That Certain Feeling" and "Fascinatin'
Rhythm." "I Love You, Porgy" (also by Gershwin) was
especially beautiful.

Pianist Paul Hart switched to violin, emulating
Stephane Grappelly, for "Bluest Kind Of Blues" which
was actually Django Reinhardt's "Juages" with lyrics.
Laine belted out a couple of fine blues, Bessie Smith's
"Gimme A Pigfoot," and "Unlucky Woman," written by
jazz critic ("Right on") Leonard Feather.
Big Clarinet Solo
The latter received the most applause of the entire 1
show, largely as a result of Dankworth's high-energy solo ;
on clarinet.
Cleo Laine is not a "jazz singer" per se in that she ;
does all types of material. But, she is a jazz singer as far as ;
the evident blues influences, and the "swing" she packs -
into each number.
And on those terms, though it may be a bit
embarrassing to admit, this West Indian-British stylist is
the world's number one jazz singer, male or female.
America has no one who can match her. Not Ella, not *
anybody.
We may as well get used to the fact that those cats
across the Atlantic can sing and play "our music," jazz and
blues, as well as we ourselves can.
There is a vast difference between the way we view
American music and the way it is looked at by those
removed from it. To them it's not just entertainment, it's
an art form, and is respected as such.
Perhaps the greatest jazz musician ever, Charlie Parker,
died an unknown to most of his own country. But, in
Europe he was a god to some, and an artist to all. John
Dankworth is clearly an example of one of his many
disciples.
