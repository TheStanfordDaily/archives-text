Prosecution Begins Cover-Up Trial
WASHINGTON Asst. Special Prosecutor Richard
Ben-Veniste laid out his case against the five Watergate
cover-up defendants yesterday, declaring he will prove an
illegal conspiracy among "the most powerful men in the
government of the United States."
He said the plan to cover up the break-in at Democratic
National Committee headquarters more than two years ago
"involved the participation of even the President himself."
The 31-year-old prosecutor, speaking from a lectern only
a few feet from the jury box, said former President Richard
M. Nixon was willing to sacrifice a close aide to save himself
and closer associates when the cover-up was unraveling.
Quoting from an April 19, 1973, White House tape,
Ben-Veniste said Nixon believed that if former White House
Counsel John W. Dean were turned over to Watergate
prosecutors, they might not try and make a case against
presidential aides H.R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman
or Nixon himself.
On the tape, Nixon said Haldeman and Ehrlichman
should "give the investigators an hors d'oeuvres [Dean]
maybe they won't come back for the main course," the
prosecutor said.
Revelations On Rocky Raise Questions
WASHINGTON Disclosures about Nelson A.
Rockefeller's political philanthropy have created a dilemma
for congressional Democrats: if they approve him for vice
president in 1974, can they criticize his ethics in the 1976
campaign?
Democratic leaders want to make sure they have fully
checked the former New York governor's background
before giving him what amounts to a congressional seal of
approval.
Sen. Howard W. Cannon (D-Nev.) indicated Sunday the
Senate Rules Committee probably will recall Rockefeller
for further questioning.
Serious ethical questions have arisen tending to mar the
"clean" image Rockefeller had when he was nominated.
These include the disclosures that he gave nearly $l.B
million in gifts to present and former aides, and
Rockefeller's admission that his brother financed a 1970
campaign book attacking Arthur Goldberg, his opponent
that year for governor.
Goldberg said yesterday that Rockefeller owes the
American people an apology for the derogatory book.
FBI Moves Search For Patty Hearst
CHICAGO The FBI is now centering its search for
Patricia Hearst in Santa Barbara, the Chicago Tribune said it
has learned.
The report in yesterday's editions of the newspaper said
two members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, with
whom Hearst presumably is traveling, have friends and
relatives in the Santa Barbara area.
It said the FBI learned recently that the two, William
and Emily Harris, had spent several days in the area late last
year.

The Tribune said a retired supervisor of Santa Barbara's
Bureau of Vital Statistics has identified a photograph of
Mrs. Harris as that of a woman who spent two days last
year going over birth and death records.
The information may have been used to obtain phony
drivers licenses and other identification.
The Tribune said that officially the FBI maintains it is
continuing its main search in the Los Angeles area.
Ford Vetoes Cutoff Of Turkish Aid
WASHINGTON In his first major confrontation with
Congress, President Ford yesterday vetoed a measure to cut
off U.S. arms aid to Turkey, declaring the ban would dash
hopes for a Cyprus peace settlement.
House leaders arranged a vote today on the move to
override the veto. The measure had been enacted by a
lopsided vote, but Democratic leaders acknowledged
chances of over-riding the President's action were slim. A
two-thirds vote is necessary to override a veto.
The resolution would cut off U.S. aid to Turkey until
Ford can certify substantial progress toward a settlement
on reduction or withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus.
Kissinger Gels Pledge From Sadat
CAIRO, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat assured
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger yesterday that he will
try to gain support for interim agreements with Israel at the
upcoming Arab summit.
Kissinger obtained the pledge at Sadat's residence near
here, flew to Damascus for a tough three-hour session with
Syrian President Hafez Assad, then went on to Algeria.
In other developments, the United Nations General
Assembly in New York voted overwhelmingly yesterday to
allow the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which
coordinates the activities of Arab guerrilla groups, to take
part in debate on Palestine.
Only Israel, the United States, Boliviaand the Dominican
Republic voted against the resolution, which passed 105-4
with 20 abstentions.
The invitation to the PLO for the debate, which begins
Nov. 7 and is expected to last two weeks, asks it to act as
"the representative of the Palestinian people."
UÂ£. Got Unused Building For Nixon
WASHINGTON Federal officials, at White House
insistence, earlier this year traded $27 million in productive
property for a massive, unused building so that former
President Richard M. Nixon could store records near his
San Clemente, Calif., home, the Washington Post said
today.
The General Services Administration acquired the squat,
pyramid-shaped building at Laguna Niguel, Calif., 10 miles
north of San Clemente, from Rockwell International Corp.,
a major defense contractor, the newspaper reported in
today's editions.
In exchange, the Post said, the government gave
Rockwell buildings in El Segundo and Canoga Park, Calif.
Bomb Blasts Big Tokyo Company
TOKYO A bomb exploded yesterday in the offices of
the giant trading firm, Mitsui and Co., injuring 16 persons,
including five policemen who had been alerted by
telephoned threats and were searching for the device.
It was the second big Japanese corporation to be
bombed in six weeks. On Aug. 30 an explosion in front of
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. offices killed eight persons
and injured more than 300.
Released Hostage Arrives In Miami
MIAMI, Fla. American diplomat Barbara Hutchison
arrived in the United .States yesterday, saying she has no
qualms about returning next week to her job in the
Dominican Republic, where she was held captive by
pre-communist kidnapers for 12 days.
"It was sort of a fluke-type of kidnaping anyway, and I
get the choice of going back there or somewhere else. But I
love the country and there are many things I still play to do
there."
