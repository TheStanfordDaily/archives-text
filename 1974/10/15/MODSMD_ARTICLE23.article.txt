# Visiting Journalists Enjoy Respite From That Newsroom Pressure
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
Thirteen journalists from all over
the country are auditing classes here
on the ninth session of the Stanford
Professional Journalism Fellows
Program.
The journalists—lo from the print
media and three from broadcasting
have taken nine-month
leaves-of-absence to study fields
outside journalism.
"There is a great need for
continuing education for
journalists," says Harry Press, the
program's managing director.
"Journalists have to break away from
deadline pressure and take a deeper
look at the humanities, sciences and
themselves."
Press selected the
journalists—most of whom have been
working professionally for at least"
five years—from a pool of 90
applicants. "I chose them on the
basis of past achievements, including
unusually in-depth news stories and
broadcasts, and their potential for
contribution to the field after they
leave the program," he said.
Endowments
Twelve of the fellowships are
funded by the National Endowment
for the Humanities (NEH), and one
by the Knight Foundation.
Noting that only two of this
year's fellowships are held by women,
Press emphasized, "I'm eager to get
more women in the program. That is
likely to happen considering the
great numbers , of women now
entering the field."
In addition to auditing courses,
the journalists attend weekly
seminars led by faculty members and
speakers from outside the university.
Fie|d Trips
They also will take field trips
during the course of the academic
year, including one in November to
the Center for the Study of
Democratic Institutions in Santa
Barbara, and one in March to Canada
for a week of seminars with Canadian
government, education and

communications leaders.
Press noted that many journalists
at first have difficulty adjusting to
academic life. "This is an entirely
different kind of work from the
deadline pressure work of journalism.
It's often traumatic for them to
make the switch, because when they
get here, suddenly there's no one to
report to."
But many of the journalists had a
different view. "After writing about
Watergate for two years, it's an
incredible luxury to face a week
where you don't have to write
anything," said Arthur Zich, 39,
Newsweek associate editor for
national affairs, "It sounds corny,
but you don't realize the tremendous
opportunities there are in school
until you go back to it after working
professionally. This place is an
intellectual cornucopia."
'Better History Perspective'
Lynne Millar, 33, news editor of
the Houston Post, echoed Zich's
thoughts. "Many fellows feel an
almost desperate need to take
advantage of everything possible in
nine months." Citing law and
political science courses—two of the
six she is auditing—Millar added," "I
came here to get a better perspective
on history, because as news editor, I
have to decide what goes on the
front page. Studying the importance
of historical events will make that
decision better."
Howard Lett, 41, news and public
affairs director of WDJX in Jackson,
Miss., feels that his study of American
and European literature will benefit
him personally as well as
professionally.
"Literature is one of the best
mirrors of the human condition. My
focus right now is on the problem of
death and dying, which is just
beginning to be discussed openly in
the media and in day-to-day life/'
Lett said. "My studies might result in
a series of programs for WDJX
documentary, or simply my own
personal growth."

Robert Olmos 43, a reporter for
the Portland Oregonian, is currently
studying political science,
philosophy, history, English and
Spanish in order to improve his
coverage of farmworkers issues in
Oregon. "Thsi program is giving me
an opportunity to expand my mind
in different directions so my
reporting will be more in-depth when
I get back to work," he said.
Program Criticized
Olmos criticized the program,
however, for isolating journalism
fellows from the student body.
"When we first got here, it would
have been nice to have had more
person-to-person contact with other
students for advice on courses and
general social interchange. To a
certain extent, we're separated from
the student body."
But Zich disagreed. "Most of my
intellectual companionship comes
from students and professors here.
I'm getting something out of the
purely academic environment, while
fellow students are learning from my
experierice in journalism, which
imparts a 'sense of reality' to
academic discussion."
Other journalists in the program
are:
—Dave Bonner, 34, editor and
publisher of the Powell Tribune in
Powell. Wyo.;
—George Goodman, 35, reporter
for the New York Times;
—John Hollahan, 37, public affairs
director of WWVT Public TV in
Morgan town, W.Va.;

Thirteen journalists from all over
the country are auditing classes here
on the ninth session of the Stanford
Professional Journalism Fellows
Program.
The journalists—lo from the print
media and three from broadcasting
have taken nine-month
leaves-of-absence to study fields
outside journalism.
"There is a great need for
continuing education for
journalists," says Harry Press, the
program's managing director.
"Journalists have to break away from
deadline pressure and take a deeper
look at the humanities, sciences and
themselves."
Press selected the
journalists—most of whom have been
working professionally for at least"
five years—from a pool of 90
applicants. "I chose them on the
basis of past achievements, including
unusually in-depth news stories and
broadcasts, and their potential for
contribution to the field after they
leave the program," he said.
Endowments
Twelve of the fellowships are
funded by the National Endowment
for the Humanities (NEH), and one
by the Knight Foundation.
Noting that only two of this
year's fellowships are held by women,
Press emphasized, "I'm eager to get
more women in the program. That is
likely to happen considering the
great numbers , of women now
entering the field."
In addition to auditing courses,
the journalists attend weekly
seminars led by faculty members and
speakers from outside the university.
Fie|d Trips
They also will take field trips
during the course of the academic
year, including one in November to
the Center for the Study of
Democratic Institutions in Santa
Barbara, and one in March to Canada
for a week of seminars with Canadian
government, education and

communications leaders.
Press noted that many journalists
at first have difficulty adjusting to
academic life. "This is an entirely
different kind of work from the
deadline pressure work of journalism.
It's often traumatic for them to
make the switch, because when they
get here, suddenly there's no one to
report to."
But many of the journalists had a
different view. "After writing about
Watergate for two years, it's an
incredible luxury to face a week
where you don't have to write
anything," said Arthur Zich, 39,
Newsweek associate editor for
national affairs, "It sounds corny,
but you don't realize the tremendous
opportunities there are in school
until you go back to it after working
professionally. This place is an
intellectual cornucopia."
'Better History Perspective'
Lynne Millar, 33, news editor of
the Houston Post, echoed Zich's
thoughts. "Many fellows feel an
almost desperate need to take
advantage of everything possible in
nine months." Citing law and
political science courses—two of the
six she is auditing—Millar added," "I
came here to get a better perspective
on history, because as news editor, I
have to decide what goes on the
front page. Studying the importance
of historical events will make that
decision better."
Howard Lett, 41, news and public
affairs director of WDJX in Jackson,
Miss., feels that his study of American
and European literature will benefit
him personally as well as
professionally.
"Literature is one of the best
mirrors of the human condition. My
focus right now is on the problem of
death and dying, which is just
beginning to be discussed openly in
the media and in day-to-day life/'
Lett said. "My studies might result in
a series of programs for WDJX
documentary, or simply my own
personal growth."

Robert Olmos 43, a reporter for
the Portland Oregonian, is currently
studying political science,
philosophy, history, English and
Spanish in order to improve his
coverage of farmworkers issues in
Oregon. "Thsi program is giving me
an opportunity to expand my mind
in different directions so my
reporting will be more in-depth when
I get back to work," he said.
Program Criticized
Olmos criticized the program,
however, for isolating journalism
fellows from the student body.
"When we first got here, it would
have been nice to have had more
person-to-person contact with other
students for advice on courses and
general social interchange. To a
certain extent, we're separated from
the student body."
But Zich disagreed. "Most of my
intellectual companionship comes
from students and professors here.
I'm getting something out of the
purely academic environment, while
fellow students are learning from my
experierice in journalism, which
imparts a 'sense of reality' to
academic discussion."
Other journalists in the program
are:
—Dave Bonner, 34, editor and
publisher of the Powell Tribune in
Powell. Wyo.;
—George Goodman, 35, reporter
for the New York Times;
—John Hollahan, 37, public affairs

Thirteen journalists from all over
the country are auditing classes here
on the ninth session of the Stanford
Professional Journalism Fellows
Program.
The journalists—lo from the print
media and three from broadcasting
have taken nine-month
leaves-of-absence to study fields
outside journalism.
"There is a great need for
continuing education for
journalists," says Harry Press, the
program's managing director.
"Journalists have to break away from
deadline pressure and take a deeper
look at the humanities, sciences and
themselves."
Press selected the
journalists—most of whom have been
working professionally for at least"
five years—from a pool of 90
applicants. "I chose them on the
basis of past achievements, including
unusually in-depth news stories and
broadcasts, and their potential for
contribution to the field after they
leave the program," he said.
Endowments
Twelve of the fellowships are
funded by the National Endowment
for the Humanities (NEH), and one
by the Knight Foundation.
Noting that only two of this
year's fellowships are held by women,
Press emphasized, "I'm eager to get
more women in the program. That is
likely to happen considering the
great numbers , of women now
entering the field."
In addition to auditing courses,
the journalists attend weekly
seminars led by faculty members and
speakers from outside the university.
Fie|d Trips
They also will take field trips
during the course of the academic
year, including one in November to
the Center for the Study of
Democratic Institutions in Santa
Barbara, and one in March to Canada
for a week of seminars with Canadian
government, education and

communications leaders.
Press noted that many journalists
at first have difficulty adjusting to
academic life. "This is an entirely
different kind of work from the
deadline pressure work of journalism.
It's often traumatic for them to
make the switch, because when they
get here, suddenly there's no one to
report to."
But many of the journalists had a
different view. "After writing about
Watergate for two years, it's an
incredible luxury to face a week
where you don't have to write
anything," said Arthur Zich, 39,
Newsweek associate editor for
national affairs, "It sounds corny,
but you don't realize the tremendous
opportunities there are in school
until you go back to it after working
professionally. This place is an
intellectual cornucopia."
'Better History Perspective'
Lynne Millar, 33, news editor of
the Houston Post, echoed Zich's
thoughts. "Many fellows feel an
almost desperate need to take
advantage of everything possible in
nine months." Citing law and
political science courses—two of the
six she is auditing—Millar added," "I
came here to get a better perspective
on history, because as news editor, I
have to decide what goes on the
front page. Studying the importance
of historical events will make that
decision better."
Howard Lett, 41, news and public
affairs director of WDJX in Jackson,
Miss., feels that his study of American
and European literature will benefit
him personally as well as
professionally.
"Literature is one of the best
mirrors of the human condition. My
focus right now is on the problem of
death and dying, which is just
beginning to be discussed openly in
the media and in day-to-day life/'
Lett said. "My studies might result in
a series of programs for WDJX
documentary, or simply my own
personal growth."

Robert Olmos 43, a reporter for
the Portland Oregonian, is currently
studying political science,
philosophy, history, English and
Spanish in order to improve his
coverage of farmworkers issues in
Oregon. "Thsi program is giving me
an opportunity to expand my mind
in different directions so my
reporting will be more in-depth when
I get back to work," he said.
Program Criticized
Olmos criticized the program,
however, for isolating journalism
fellows from the student body.
"When we first got here, it would
have been nice to have had more
person-to-person contact with other
students for advice on courses and
general social interchange. To a
certain extent, we're separated from
the student body."
But Zich disagreed. "Most of my
intellectual companionship comes
from students and professors here.
I'm getting something out of the
purely academic environment, while
fellow students are learning from my
experierice in journalism, which
imparts a 'sense of reality' to
academic discussion."
Other journalists in the program
are:
—Dave Bonner, 34, editor and
publisher of the Powell Tribune in
Powell. Wyo.;
—George Goodman, 35, reporter
for the New York Times;
—John Hollahan, 37, public affairs
director of WWVT Public TV in
