## 
### BONNY RODDEN MARK VAN ALLEN 
Zeta Psi alumnus Jack Ditz accused
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
N. Horton last night of using Title IX
of the Federal Educational
Admendments Act of 1972 as "a
shield and support" to ending the
fraternity system at Stanford.
Ditz summarized the prevalent view
of fraternity alumni at a Stanford
Fraternity Alumni Council meeting.
Horton emphasized once again that

the current controversy over the
housing system is "not a review of the
fraternity system. What we are doing is
reviewing the entire housing system."
Horton explained to nearly 75
fraternity alumni that the University
discriminates against women because
men in fraternities against women
because men in fraternities have
draw-exempt status but no women
share the same privilege.
Policy
He remarked that the University

will have to lange the current
housing system because University
policy forbids ccrimination against
sex. He said itle IX is merely
"background" tche issue.
Horton menaned a number of
proposals whichave been considered
as alternatives tthe present housing
system, include a proposal which
would bring frarnities into the draw.
While Hortofielded questions on
the housing pricament, a fraternity
alumnus aske him if reviving
sororities on capus would solve the
dilemma.
Title L Stipulation
Horton citea proposed regulation
in Title IX rtiich could possibly
prevent the liversity from assisting
any organizati which discrimination
on the basis Just as fraternities
discriminate ainst women sororities
do so agait men, Horton has
explained at ler meetings.
Delta Ujon Alumni President

University asted the fraternities.
George Tregory, associate legal
counsel toie General Secretary's
Office, ans\ed Coonan, saying that
the Unive;y lawyers "are not
exactly sunow Stanford stands in
this regard.
Unisity Construction
Gregorymentioned that some
lawyers consider University
constructicof the fraternity cluster
houses asniversity assistance. He
added tharaternity alumni donated
money t<the University for the

construction of fraternities.
Horton also remarked that building
sororities on campus would "take
time." He ,did not expect that any
could be completed before 1977.
Horton noted that most other
universities with fraternities on
campus also have sororities unlike
Stanford. Therefore, they provide the
same privileges to both sexes, Horton
said.
Horton emphasized that the
University's priorities lie in finding a
housing system which is
"educationally sound" and which will
be acceptable for the next decade.
