# Parking Problem Grows; Policy Under Evaluation
## 
### BARBARA WIEBE MARTHA ADAMS 
Parking at Stanford is now "the
second or third worst problem on
campus," says Charles Meyers,
chairman of the Committee on Land
and Building Development.
Student car-owners here were not
required to pay a customary $lO
vehicle registration fee to obtain
parking stickers during fall quarter
registration.
Stanford Police Department Capt.
William Wullschleger said the fee for
vehicle registration, which includes a
parking permit, was suspended
temporarily to allow the University
time to restructure its parking permit
policy.

Some Escondido Village residents
have criticized the old policy, which
requires people who live on campus to
pay for a parking sticker while
off-campus residents park for free. The
old policy requires that only students
pay for vehicle registration. Faculty
and staff members are not charged for
vehicle registration or parking permits.
Problem Studies
The Committee on Land Building
Development and its subcommittee on
parking - and transportation are
currently studying the parking
problem, Meyers said.
Asst. Food Research Prof. Scott
Pearson, who chairs the subcommittee,
said he couldn't speculate on what the
new parking policy will be. The
committee will hold its initial meeting
within the next two weeks. A second
meeting, sometime in November, will
be open to the public,Pearson said.
But subcommittee member Dan
De Young, director of services
operations, said University officials are
talking about a policy that would
require all students, faculty and staff
to pay a registration fee in order to get
a parking sticker.
Wullschleger added that the fees
will probably be collected in January.
Revenues 'Lost'
Oscar Nelson, the University's
master planner, said revenues not
collected this quarter will be accepted
as "lost." But there weren't a lot of
revenues to lose, he said, because
many students had neglected to pay
the fees.
Nelson said there are fewer parking
places on campus this year—an

estimated 12,000 spaces for 13,800
registered cars.
"We have lots of space on campus,"
Nelson said, "but it's not where
everyone wants it." He said lots near
the men's and women's tennis courts
are prime parking areas that are rarely
full.
According to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington, the most common

parking violation on campus is parking
in a lot designated for special permits
without the proper sticker. Students
frequently park in spaces marked
"staff" or "reserve," said Herrington,
but occasionally, it happens the other
way around.
Drivers also create parking spaces
wherever they can find enough room
for a car, regardless of whether or not
it's a legal space, Herrington added.

parking stickers during fall quarter
registration.
Stanford Police Department Capt.
William Wullschleger said the fee for
vehicle registration, which includes a
parking permit, was suspended
temporarily to allow the University
time to restructure its parking permit
policy.

Some Escondido Village residents
have criticized the old policy, which
requires people who live on campus to
pay for a parking sticker while
off-campus residents park for free. The
old policy requires that only students
pay for vehicle registration. Faculty
and staff members are not charged for
vehicle registration or parking permits.
Problem Studies
The Committee on Land Building
Development and its subcommittee on
parking - and transportation are
currently studying the parking
problem, Meyers said.
Asst. Food Research Prof. Scott
Pearson, who chairs the subcommittee,
said he couldn't speculate on what the
new parking policy will be. The
committee will hold its initial meeting
within the next two weeks. A second
meeting, sometime in November, will
be open to the public,Pearson said.
But subcommittee member Dan
De Young, director of services
operations, said University officials are
talking about a policy that would
require all students, faculty and staff
to pay a registration fee in order to get
a parking sticker.
Wullschleger added that the fees
will probably be collected in January.
Revenues 'Lost'
Oscar Nelson, the University's
master planner, said revenues not
collected this quarter will be accepted
as "lost." But there weren't a lot of
revenues to lose, he said, because
many students had neglected to pay
the fees.
Nelson said there are fewer parking
places on campus this year—an

estimated 12,000 spaces for 13,800
registered cars.
"We have lots of space on campus,"
Nelson said, "but it's not where
everyone wants it." He said lots near
the men's and women's tennis courts
are prime parking areas that are rarely
full.
According to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington, the most common

parking violation on campus is parking
in a lot designated for special permits
without the proper sticker. Students
frequently park in spaces marked
"staff" or "reserve," said Herrington,
but occasionally, it happens the other
way around.
Drivers also create parking spaces
wherever they can find enough room
for a car, regardless of whether or not
it's a legal space, Herrington added.
Parking at Stanford is now "the
second or third worst problem on
campus," says Charles Meyers,
chairman of the Committee on Land
and Building Development.
Student car-owners here were not
required to pay a customary $lO
vehicle registration fee to obtain
parking stickers during fall quarter
