# Committee Of Fifteen To Convene
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The Committee of Fifteen (C-.15), the group charged for
the last three years with formulating a new University
judicial system, will meet tomorrow night for the first time
this year.
University President Richard Lyman, who requested the
meeting, expressed doubt that a new proposal for a
different type of university judicial system will be accepted
by the committee.
Lyman noted that "a lot of good people have put a lot
of hours in on the project already, and no new proposal has
come out of it."
However, ASSU President Mike Herman said, "I am
optimistic that a proposal can be agreed to by the end of
winter quarter if the committee can agree that there are
weaknesses in the system."
Herman Request
Lyman said he has called the meeting "to review the

current system" at the request of Herman.
Lyman said Herman told him that the issue was of great
concern to him and that Herman would push for a student
referendum reconvene the committee if Lyman did not
request it.
The committee can only be reconvened by student
petition or referendum, by a majority vote of the faculty
senate, or at the request of the University president.
, Complex Proposal
Herman has- submitted a "very complex" three-page
proposal to the members of the C-15, Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Dale Snape said.
The proposal is an amended version to a proposal that
was voted down by the students early last year, according
to Snape.
However, Snape said that Herman submitted the
proposal as a "taking off point" for committee discussion.
