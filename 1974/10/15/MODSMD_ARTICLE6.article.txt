# Gnarled Old Eucalyptus May Be Energy Source
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Imagine the sweet-smelling, bark-shedding,
seemingly useless eucalyptus tree as a significant
source of energy when our oil supply runs dry, and
you might well reach the same conclusions as did a
comprehensive energy study here.
* Some 75 students and 25 professors from various
academic backgrounds have nearly completed a
nine-month examination of future energy
alternatives from technological, economical,
environmental, and political viewpoints.
Their surprising findings indicate that eucalypti
grown on large plantations on the West Coast and in
*• the Southeast could be converted to pipeline gas
and electricity to satisfy as much as 20 percent of
the United States' huge energy appetite in the year
2020.
And, the whole process would cost slightly
less than the similar conversion of coal, considered
one of the most economical substitutes to oil.
The Federal Energy Office may be interested.
Government officials have already examined an
advance copy of the study, which came out of an
Engineering 235 class.
Hopes Research Influenced
Mechanical Engineering Prof. William Reynolds,
one of the project's organizers, says he hopes the
report will influence government-funded research by
diverting money into non-petroleum fuel study and
development.
A detailed report of the study, to be completed
probably by December, will be sent to scientists and
political leaders.
Large foreign countries suffering from the
increasingly large import-export deficit caused by the
the rising price of oil will also be listening intently.
Possible Grower
Tropical Brazil, for example, contains the large
area and the right climate to produce enough

eucalypti to supply its own energieeds, with
plenty left over for exporting. WI the Arabs
boast oil czars, the Brazilians could t eucalyptus
kings.
The conversion of eucalyptus vd to natural
gas is hardly a newfangled prcs involving
dangerously unpredictable chemic It closely
resembles the gasification of coal.
Basically, a giant cooker contain no oxygen
heats up chips of the eucalyf, producing
methane.
Synthetic Gas
Methane, is a synthetic :ural gas of
pipeline quality. A derivative of meie, methanol,
produces a gasoline substitute whkould power a
car 60 percent as far per gallon aslay's oil-based
gasoline, estimates Assoc. Elect! Engineering
Prof. Bruce Lusignan, director of tlroject.
A close examination of thnany gnarled
eucalypti towering over the camjhere indicates
why the energy group selected tree over all
others as a raw material source of gy.
Eucalypti are extremely hartrequiring only
small amounts of water and relate unfertile soil.
Chances of a "bad crop" are thusic6d.
Rapid Growth
They also grow at a rapid that they
could provide a steady supply energy. Randy
Livingston, a senior in mechal engineering,
estimates that it would take a eyptus only five
to eight years to reach a size fble for cutting.
And the same tree stump can nerate three to
eight times before it must be rejd.
Using eucalypti for energy' not be such a
radical idea. "After all," saproject director
Lusignan, "it's wood. It's wh<f power systems
used to be based on. Now >try is advanced
enough to make it a viable sour' energy."

But eucalypti provide but one of many potential
energy sources which the report evaluates. In other
major conclusions, the group found that:
—Garbage from major urban centers could
provide an economically and environmentally
attractive energy source when converted to low
energy gas for electricity generation, or when
upgraded for pipeline gas consumption.
—Coal converted to gas for electric power
generation is less costly for home heating than
electricity from nuclear energy;
(Group member Livingston emphasized that this
conclusion contradicts statements by "many of the
large electrical and nuclear companies who are
advocating an all-nuclear economy for the U.S.")
—Solar energy converted to electricity is not as
economically feasible as that from nuclear or coal
conversion because of the large cost of reflectors
and the difficulty of storing the energy to match
solar cycles with consumption cycles.
—Geothermal energy for example, from
geysers is much cheaper than coal or nuclear
energy for electricity, but is very limited
geographically and in quantity. The study
encouraged the development of geothermal plants.
—Hydroelectric dams produce electricity
comparable in price to that of nuclear or coal
powered plants. Only when constructed to serve
other needs, such as flood control and water
storage, would dams show an economic advantage
over other sources.
But the study notes that all these energy
alternatives could meet but a small portion of future
United States needs. It stresses that "the growth in
per capita consumption of energy must slow down
and stop during the next decades.
"There is no way the environment can continue
to support the rise in energy consumption the
United States has enjoyed since World War II."

eucalypti towering over the camjhere indicates
why the energy group selected tree over all
others as a raw material source of gy.
Eucalypti are extremely hartrequiring only
small amounts of water and relate unfertile soil.
Chances of a "bad crop" are thusic6d.
Rapid Growth
They also grow at a rapid that they
could provide a steady supply energy. Randy
Livingston, a senior in mechal engineering,
estimates that it would take a eyptus only five
to eight years to reach a size fble for cutting.
And the same tree stump can nerate three to
eight times before it must be rejd.
Using eucalypti for energy' not be such a
radical idea. "After all," saproject director
Lusignan, "it's wood. It's wh<f power systems
used to be based on. Now >try is advanced
enough to make it a viable sour' energy."

But eucalypti provide but one of many potential
energy sources which the report evaluates. In other
major conclusions, the group found that:
—Garbage from major urban centers could
provide an economically and environmentally
attractive energy source when converted to low
energy gas for electricity generation, or when
upgraded for pipeline gas consumption.
—Coal converted to gas for electric power
generation is less costly for home heating than
electricity from nuclear energy;
(Group member Livingston emphasized that this
conclusion contradicts statements by "many of the
large electrical and nuclear companies who are
advocating an all-nuclear economy for the U.S.")
—Solar energy converted to electricity is not as
economically feasible as that from nuclear or coal
conversion because of the large cost of reflectors
and the difficulty of storing the energy to match
solar cycles with consumption cycles.
—Geothermal energy for example, from
geysers is much cheaper than coal or nuclear
energy for electricity, but is very limited
geographically and in quantity. The study
encouraged the development of geothermal plants.
—Hydroelectric dams produce electricity
comparable in price to that of nuclear or coal
powered plants. Only when constructed to serve
other needs, such as flood control and water
storage, would dams show an economic advantage
over other sources.
But the study notes that all these energy
alternatives could meet but a small portion of future
United States needs. It stresses that "the growth in
per capita consumption of energy must slow down
and stop during the next decades.
"There is no way the environment can continue
to support the rise in energy consumption the
United States has enjoyed since World War II."

EVER BURN A TREE? —Although an energy study here finds eucalyptus trees
a possible source of raw materials necessary to produce badly needed natural gas
and electricity, don't bet that these towering beauties on campus will be the first
to go.
Imagine the sweet-smelling, bark-shedding,
seemingly useless eucalyptus tree as a significant
source of energy when our oil supply runs dry, and
you might well reach the same conclusions as did a
comprehensive energy study here.
* Some 75 students and 25 professors from various
academic backgrounds have nearly completed a
nine-month examination of future energy
alternatives from technological, economical,
environmental, and political viewpoints.
Their surprising findings indicate that eucalypti
grown on large plantations on the West Coast and in
*• the Southeast could be converted to pipeline gas
and electricity to satisfy as much as 20 percent of
the United States' huge energy appetite in the year
2020.
And, the whole process would cost slightly
less than the similar conversion of coal, considered
one of the most economical substitutes to oil.
The Federal Energy Office may be interested.
Government officials have already examined an
advance copy of the study, which came out of an
Engineering 235 class.
Hopes Research Influenced
Mechanical Engineering Prof. William Reynolds,
one of the project's organizers, says he hopes the
report will influence government-funded research by
diverting money into non-petroleum fuel study and
development.
A detailed report of the study, to be completed
probably by December, will be sent to scientists and
political leaders.
Large foreign countries suffering from the
increasingly large import-export deficit caused by the
the rising price of oil will also be listening intently.
Possible Grower
Tropical Brazil, for example, contains the large
area and the right climate to produce enough

eucalypti to supply its own energieeds, with
plenty left over for exporting. WI the Arabs
boast oil czars, the Brazilians could t eucalyptus
kings.
The conversion of eucalyptus vd to natural
gas is hardly a newfangled prcs involving
dangerously unpredictable chemic It closely
resembles the gasification of coal.
Basically, a giant cooker contain no oxygen
heats up chips of the eucalyf, producing
methane.
Synthetic Gas
Methane, is a synthetic :ural gas of
pipeline quality. A derivative of meie, methanol,
produces a gasoline substitute whkould power a
car 60 percent as far per gallon aslay's oil-based
gasoline, estimates Assoc. Elect! Engineering

EVER BURN A TREE? —Although an energy study here finds eucalyptus trees
a possible source of raw materials necessary to produce badly needed natural gas
and electricity, don't bet that these towering beauties on campus will be the first
to go.
Imagine the sweet-smelling, bark-shedding,
seemingly useless eucalyptus tree as a significant
source of energy when our oil supply runs dry, and
you might well reach the same conclusions as did a
comprehensive energy study here.
* Some 75 students and 25 professors from various
academic backgrounds have nearly completed a
nine-month examination of future energy
alternatives from technological, economical,
environmental, and political viewpoints.
Their surprising findings indicate that eucalypti
grown on large plantations on the West Coast and in
*• the Southeast could be converted to pipeline gas
and electricity to satisfy as much as 20 percent of
the United States' huge energy appetite in the year
2020.
And, the whole process would cost slightly
less than the similar conversion of coal, considered
one of the most economical substitutes to oil.
The Federal Energy Office may be interested.
Government officials have already examined an
advance copy of the study, which came out of an
Engineering 235 class.
Hopes Research Influenced
Mechanical Engineering Prof. William Reynolds,
one of the project's organizers, says he hopes the
report will influence government-funded research by
diverting money into non-petroleum fuel study and
development.
A detailed report of the study, to be completed
probably by December, will be sent to scientists and
political leaders.
Large foreign countries suffering from the
increasingly large import-export deficit caused by the
the rising price of oil will also be listening intently.
Possible Grower
Tropical Brazil, for example, contains the large
area and the right climate to produce enough

eucalypti to supply its own energieeds, with
plenty left over for exporting. WI the Arabs
boast oil czars, the Brazilians could t eucalyptus
kings.
The conversion of eucalyptus vd to natural
gas is hardly a newfangled prcs involving
dangerously unpredictable chemic It closely
resembles the gasification of coal.
Basically, a giant cooker contain no oxygen
heats up chips of the eucalyf, producing
methane.
Synthetic Gas
Methane, is a synthetic :ural gas of
pipeline quality. A derivative of meie, methanol,
produces a gasoline substitute whkould power a
car 60 percent as far per gallon aslay's oil-based
gasoline, estimates Assoc. Elect! Engineering
Prof. Bruce Lusignan, director of tlroject.
A close examination of thnany gnarled
eucalypti towering over the camjhere indicates
why the energy group selected tree over all
others as a raw material source of gy.
Eucalypti are extremely hartrequiring only
small amounts of water and relate unfertile soil.
Chances of a "bad crop" are thusic6d.
Rapid Growth
They also grow at a rapid that they
could provide a steady supply energy. Randy
Livingston, a senior in mechal engineering,
estimates that it would take a eyptus only five
to eight years to reach a size fble for cutting.
And the same tree stump can nerate three to
eight times before it must be rejd.
Using eucalypti for energy' not be such a
radical idea. "After all," saproject director
Lusignan, "it's wood. It's wh<f power systems
used to be based on. Now >try is advanced
enough to make it a viable sour' energy."

But eucalypti provide but one of many potential
energy sources which the report evaluates. In other
major conclusions, the group found that:
—Garbage from major urban centers could
provide an economically and environmentally
attractive energy source when converted to low
energy gas for electricity generation, or when
upgraded for pipeline gas consumption.
—Coal converted to gas for electric power
generation is less costly for home heating than
electricity from nuclear energy;
(Group member Livingston emphasized that this
conclusion contradicts statements by "many of the
large electrical and nuclear companies who are
advocating an all-nuclear economy for the U.S.")
—Solar energy converted to electricity is not as
economically feasible as that from nuclear or coal
conversion because of the large cost of reflectors
and the difficulty of storing the energy to match
solar cycles with consumption cycles.
—Geothermal energy for example, from
geysers is much cheaper than coal or nuclear
energy for electricity, but is very limited
geographically and in quantity. The study
encouraged the development of geothermal plants.
—Hydroelectric dams produce electricity
comparable in price to that of nuclear or coal
powered plants. Only when constructed to serve
other needs, such as flood control and water
storage, would dams show an economic advantage
over other sources.
But the study notes that all these energy
alternatives could meet but a small portion of future
United States needs. It stresses that "the growth in
per capita consumption of energy must slow down
and stop during the next decades.
"There is no way the environment can continue
to support the rise in energy consumption the
United States has enjoyed since World War II."
