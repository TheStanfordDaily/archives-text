# Goals Of UFW
## 
### John Badger Smith 
D. Paul Yeuell's article in
Friday's Daily ("Harvest Time:
Pickers, Growers") contains a
number of deceptive and untrue
statements regarding farm labor in
California, particularly in respect
fo the United Farm Workers
Union (UFW).
At one point, he quotes a farm
labor contractor's claim that the
union has not caught on and
probably never will in the north
coast counties.. First of all, this is
simply not true. The UFW has
two contracts in the Napa Valley
at Christian Brothers and
Inglenook and workers at nine
other large wineries in the area
have repeatedly petitioned for
Union recognition.
Even so, it is not surprising
that a contractor would make
such a claim. One of the union's
primary goals is the elimination of
the labor contractor system which
has tyrannized farm workers for
Hundreds of years. For example,
Yeuell chuckles at Mexican
workers tricking Uncle Sam with
false Social Security numbers. I
wonder if he has ever considered
what happens to the part of the
workers' paychecks which gets
deducted for Social Security. In
many cases, in fattens the
contractors' pockets.
Labor contractors hold almost
complete control over the workers
in the fields. They can and do fire
workers without legitimate cause
or deduct outrageous sums from
paychecks for "services" poorly
delivered, if at all (like
transportation in unsafe buses).
Unions have replaced labor
contractors with worker-run
hiring halls in virtually all other
U.S. industries, and will do so in
agriculture, "one Sonoma
contractor's" wishful thinking
notwithstanding.
Yeuell defends the contractors'
point of view with a claim that
workers prefer such grower
programs as a Napa Valley
pension plan to a union of their
own. Such pension plans are fine
if you happen to work and live
long enough to receive them, but
they don't do much for workers

like one whole crew which was
recently fired at a Napa Valley
vineyard after ten years of steady
work for no better reason than
that somebody decided they were
too old. These workers, mostly in
their 40s, received no "pension
benefits."
UFW union workers, however,
have built their own pension plan
independent of the often fickle
good will of growers. They have
also developed a comprehensive
medical plan for farm worker
families, and use of dangerous
pesticides is controlled on union
ranches a point of as much
interest to consumers as to
workers. In addition, the union
has implemented grievance
procedures to insure the worker's
voice will be heard, and has
educated workers to government
services beyond what the union
itself can provide, while growers
have often sought to deny
workers even the right to vote.
Farm workers in California, in
fact, have very few rights when it
comes to union organizing. There
are no binding secret ballot
elections for farm workers to
decide on union representation,
nor are there guarantees against
harassment and firing of union
activists. Local courts and police,
as well as the Immigration Bureau,
which Yeuell naively pictures as
benevolently buzzing around the
vineyards "keeping tabs" on the
workers, are more than happy to
oblige growers by intimidating
and removing any individual
workers who are courageous
enough to demand their civil right
to organize freely.
Yeuell correctly dispels the
bucolic myth of peasants
tromping around on the grapes to
make wine. California's wineries
are 20th Century businesses using
advanced science and technology.
It is a pity to see Yeuell and his
beloved industry still mired in the
feudal age when it comes to the
rights of workers to share in the
wealth they create.

contractor's" wishful thinking
notwithstanding.
Yeuell defends the contractors'
point of view with a claim that
workers prefer such grower
programs as a Napa Valley
pension plan to a union of their
own. Such pension plans are fine
if you happen to work and live
long enough to receive them, but
they don't do much for workers

like one whole crew which was
recently fired at a Napa Valley
vineyard after ten years of steady
work for no better reason than
that somebody decided they were
too old. These workers, mostly in
their 40s, received no "pension
benefits."
UFW union workers, however,
have built their own pension plan
independent of the often fickle
good will of growers. They have
also developed a comprehensive
medical plan for farm worker
families, and use of dangerous
pesticides is controlled on union
ranches a point of as much
interest to consumers as to
workers. In addition, the union
has implemented grievance
procedures to insure the worker's
voice will be heard, and has
educated workers to government
services beyond what the union
itself can provide, while growers
have often sought to deny
workers even the right to vote.
Farm workers in California, in
fact, have very few rights when it
comes to union organizing. There
are no binding secret ballot
elections for farm workers to
decide on union representation,
nor are there guarantees against
harassment and firing of union
activists. Local courts and police,
as well as the Immigration Bureau,
which Yeuell naively pictures as
benevolently buzzing around the
vineyards "keeping tabs" on the
workers, are more than happy to
oblige growers by intimidating
and removing any individual
workers who are courageous
enough to demand their civil right
to organize freely.
Yeuell correctly dispels the
bucolic myth of peasants
tromping around on the grapes to
make wine. California's wineries
are 20th Century businesses using
advanced science and technology.
It is a pity to see Yeuell and his
beloved industry still mired in the
feudal age when it comes to the
rights of workers to share in the
wealth they create.

D. Paul Yeuell's article in
Friday's Daily ("Harvest Time:
Pickers, Growers") contains a
number of deceptive and untrue
statements regarding farm labor in
California, particularly in respect
fo the United Farm Workers
Union (UFW).
At one point, he quotes a farm
labor contractor's claim that the
union has not caught on and
probably never will in the north
coast counties.. First of all, this is
simply not true. The UFW has
two contracts in the Napa Valley
at Christian Brothers and
Inglenook and workers at nine
other large wineries in the area
have repeatedly petitioned for
Union recognition.
Even so, it is not surprising
that a contractor would make
such a claim. One of the union's
primary goals is the elimination of
the labor contractor system which
has tyrannized farm workers for
Hundreds of years. For example,
Yeuell chuckles at Mexican
workers tricking Uncle Sam with
false Social Security numbers. I
wonder if he has ever considered
what happens to the part of the
workers' paychecks which gets
deducted for Social Security. In
many cases, in fattens the
contractors' pockets.
Labor contractors hold almost
complete control over the workers
in the fields. They can and do fire
workers without legitimate cause
or deduct outrageous sums from
paychecks for "services" poorly
delivered, if at all (like
transportation in unsafe buses).
Unions have replaced labor
contractors with worker-run
hiring halls in virtually all other
U.S. industries, and will do so in
agriculture, "one Sonoma
contractor's" wishful thinking
notwithstanding.
