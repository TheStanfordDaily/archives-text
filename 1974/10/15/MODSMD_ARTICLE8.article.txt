In "Harvest Time" (Daily, Oct.
11), D. Paul Yeuell, while
contemplating his "modern day
Bacchus in faded overalls," passes
over the plight of the United
Farmworkers (UFW) with an
arrogance matched in scope only
by the inaccuracy with which he
quickly describes the UFW's
situation.
Whom does Mr. Yeuell
approach when he wishes to
obtain information about the
UFW? Does he speak with some
of the workers, or try to catch the
UFW side of the picture? No, Mr.
Yeuell speaks to a labor
contractor, who assures him that
the reason the union has not
"caught on" in the north coast
counties is that the growers are
offering more attractive benefit
programs than the UFW.
For Mr. D. Paul Yeuell's
information, labor contractors by
and large rate highly as enemies of
the UFW. Labor contractors are
responsible for the rounding up of
scab labor in the face of
farmworker strikes, scab labor
drawn in large measure from a
pool of illegal aliens brought from
Mexico by the promise of good
pay and decent conditions

contractors' - promises, false
promises.
The actions of labor
contractors are aimed at
undermining UFW support by
creating the illusion that the UFW
has not "caught on" and Mr.
Yeuell has bought the whole bill
of goods. And this is despite his
passing notice of illegal workers.
Perhaps Mr. Yeuell was too
intrigued with the Immigration
Bureau helicopter to take thought
to what was happening under his
nose.
One of the UFW's major
demands is the creation of union
hiring halls to replace labor
contractors. The halls would
ensure that workers were hired on
the basis of seniority and
individual need, not on the basis
of grower capriciousness and
insensitivity to the needs and
desires of farm workers.
Mr. Yeuell has shown that
some insensitivity in his article,
which fosters an erroneous
impression of the UFW's
situation. The union needs
support, not the indifference
shown in this article.

Perhaps Mr. Yeuell was too
intrigued with the Immigration
Bureau helicopter to take thought
to what was happening under his
nose.
One of the UFW's major
demands is the creation of union
hiring halls to replace labor
contractors. The halls would
ensure that workers were hired on
the basis of seniority and
individual need, not on the basis
of grower capriciousness and
insensitivity to the needs and
desires of farm workers.
Mr. Yeuell has shown that
some insensitivity in his article,
which fosters an erroneous
impression of the UFW's
situation. The union needs
support, not the indifference
shown in this article.
