# Professor Paul Flory Receives 1974 Nobel Prize In Chemistry
## 
### DON COX 
Chemistry Prof. Paul J. Flory was
awarded the 1974 Nobel Prize in
chemistry yesterday for his pioneering
research in the chemistry and physics
of large molecules.
Flory is the seventh faculty
member here to receive the prize. And
he is the first Stanford recipient since
Chemistry Prof. Linus Pauling was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 12
years ago.
When awakened early this morning
at his Portola Valley home, Flory said
he was "overwhelmed, highly honored
and humbled." He said he has not yet
received official notification from the
Nobel Prize committee.
Flory was cited "for his
fundamental achievements, both
theoretical and experimental, in the
physical chemistry of
macromolecules"-the substance of
modern plastics and many biological
compounds. He receives a cash award
of $120,000.

He declined to take all of the credit
for his discoveries. "When I think of

the hundreds and thousands of people
working in this field, I feel it's a bit
unfair for one person to be singled out
for recognition for advances in the
science of macromolecules in recent
years," Flory said.
Though Flory was engaged in basic
research and not practical applications,
of his findings, he said his work is
enabling the development of a fiber of
"unprecedented strength."
"There are fibers on the horizon, I
understand from my friends in
industry, that may reach three times
the strength of nylon—approaching the
hardness of steel but about six times
lighter in weight," he said.
Distinguished Researcher
Flory first entered the
macromolecular field as a member of
the research team under Dr. Wallace
Carothers of duPont whose original
investigations led to the discovery of
mylon.

He is a graduate of Manchester
College in Indiana and received his
Ph.D. from Ohio State University in
1934. Earlier this year, Flory received
the 1974 Priestly medal, the highest
honor in American chemistry.
In honoring Flory, the Nobel
Academy said, "For nearly 40 years
that Flory has been active as a research
• scientist, the chemistry of
macromolecules has developed from
what, theoretically speaking, was a
primitive discipline , to the highly
advanced science of today.
"All this time Flory has remained
the leading researcher in this field and
this demonstrates his exceptional
standing as a scientist."
New Concepts
Flory mapped the structure and
behavior of macromolecular chains by
introducing new concepts of an ideal
temperature state and a universal
constant for macromolecular
properties, both named after him.
He was also the first to discover
how a growing molecule chain can

transmit its growing power to another
and then stop growing itself.
One of his books, Principles of
Polymer Chemistry, is regarded as a
classic in the field, while another, on
the mechanism of chain molecules, has
been translated into Russian and
Japanese.
Flory, holder of the J.G.
Jackson-C.J.Wood endowed chair, has
a wife and three children. His son, Paul
Jr., who recently earned his doctorate

at the California Institute of
Technology, is now studying at the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm,
Sweden where the award was
announced.
Although he will retire at the end
of next summer, Flory has accepted
two visiting professorships— orie at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in the fall; and another at the
Technical University in Zurich,
Switzerland the following spring.

the research team under Dr. Wallace
Carothers of duPont whose original
investigations led to the discovery of
mylon.

He is a graduate of Manchester
College in Indiana and received his
Ph.D. from Ohio State University in
1934. Earlier this year, Flory received
the 1974 Priestly medal, the highest
honor in American chemistry.
In honoring Flory, the Nobel
Academy said, "For nearly 40 years
that Flory has been active as a research
• scientist, the chemistry of
macromolecules has developed from
what, theoretically speaking, was a
primitive discipline , to the highly
advanced science of today.
"All this time Flory has remained
the leading researcher in this field and
this demonstrates his exceptional
standing as a scientist."
New Concepts
Flory mapped the structure and
behavior of macromolecular chains by
introducing new concepts of an ideal
temperature state and a universal
constant for macromolecular
properties, both named after him.
He was also the first to discover
how a growing molecule chain can

transmit its growing power to another
and then stop growing itself.
One of his books, Principles of
Polymer Chemistry, is regarded as a
classic in the field, while another, on
the mechanism of chain molecules, has
been translated into Russian and
Japanese.
Flory, holder of the J.G.
Jackson-C.J.Wood endowed chair, has
a wife and three children. His son, Paul
Jr., who recently earned his doctorate

at the California Institute of
Technology, is now studying at the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm,
Sweden where the award was
announced.
Although he will retire at the end
of next summer, Flory has accepted
two visiting professorships— orie at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in the fall; and another at the
Technical University in Zurich,
Switzerland the following spring.

NOBEL WINNER-Chemistry Prof. Paul J. Flory, 1974 Nobel Prize winner in
chemistry, said he was "overwhelmed, highly honored and humbled when he
learned of the award. Flory is the first Stanford recipient of a Nobel prize since
Chemistry Prof. Linus Pauling 12 years ago.
Chemistry Prof. Paul J. Flory was
awarded the 1974 Nobel Prize in
chemistry yesterday for his pioneering
research in the chemistry and physics
of large molecules.
Flory is the seventh faculty
member here to receive the prize. And
he is the first Stanford recipient since
Chemistry Prof. Linus Pauling was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 12
years ago.
When awakened early this morning
at his Portola Valley home, Flory said
he was "overwhelmed, highly honored
and humbled." He said he has not yet
received official notification from the
Nobel Prize committee.
Flory was cited "for his
fundamental achievements, both
theoretical and experimental, in the
physical chemistry of
macromolecules"-the substance of
modern plastics and many biological
compounds. He receives a cash award
of $120,000.
Shares Credit
He declined to take all of the credit
for his discoveries. "When I think of

the hundreds and thousands of people
working in this field, I feel it's a bit
unfair for one person to be singled out
for recognition for advances in the
science of macromolecules in recent
years," Flory said.
Though Flory was engaged in basic
research and not practical applications,
of his findings, he said his work is
enabling the development of a fiber of
"unprecedented strength."
"There are fibers on the horizon, I
understand from my friends in
industry, that may reach three times
the strength of nylon—approaching the
hardness of steel but about six times
lighter in weight," he said.
