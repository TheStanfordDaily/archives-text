# Frenchman's Terrace Not Doomed
## 
### William Ross 
The recent furor over student housing has
eclipsed discussion of the tremendous need
for more faculty and staff housing. The
University Administration, however, is still
quite cognizant of the dearth of employe
housing and is still struggling to implement
plans for Frenchman's Terrace.
The development would be built on
Stanford land with funds provided by the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD). In return for the use of
its land, the University insists upon allocating
half of the units to Stanford employees,
contending that the project would
accommodate faculty and staff members who
must presently commute long distances to
their jobs at Stanford-
Almost from its inception in 1968, the
plan has encountered an endless series of
difficulties. Initially opposed by fiscal
conservatives, the project won support from
the Board of Trustees in 1970 but was soon
embroiled in a battle with local residents.
Most vocal was the College Terrace
Resident's Association, which claimed that
the nearby project would overcrowd adjacent
schools, parks and streets. Palo Alto city
planners endorsed the project, and the City
Council voted to rezone the land on which it
would be built. But many prominent Palo
Alto citizens opposed the project.
1972 Moratorium
In late 1972 the Nixon Administration
declared a moratorium on funds for projects
such as Frenchman's Terrace. The project
hung in abeyance for several months until the
freeze on funds was lifted.
Shortly after the removal of the
moratorium, James Price, HUD area director,
announced that he would probably oppose
the project. Price objected to the University's
insistence on placing priorities on unit

allocations. The University wanted to reserve
50 percent of the units to Stanford
employees, 25 percent to employees of firms
located on Stanford land and open only 25
percent of the spaces to the general public.
Although the University has since agreed
to drop the 25 percent allocation for
employees for firms located on its land,
Stanford has adamantly clung to its proposal
to allocated 40 percent of the units to
market priced* housing, 40 percent to
moderate income federally financed housing
hnd 20 percent to low income housing.
Meanwhile, when Stanford asked the city
to annex the 20 acreas on which the project
would be located so that the city would
provide its municipal services, some council
members notably Enid Pearson claimed
that the University was trying to impose a
trouble-ridden project on the Â£ity- While the
University protested that it couldn't afford
to provide city services for the project,
council members threatened to refuse
annexation.
NAACP Suit
Nathanial Colley, an attorney for the
National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP), filed suit
challenging the project's legality.
Although Colley later withdrew the suit,
admitting that most NAACP officials
opposed the action, the suit fanned old
grievances.
But throughout the spring, Alan
Maremont, executive director of the
Midpeninsula Housing Corporation of the
Urban Coalition labored diligently to
persuade HUD to accept the project on
Stanford's terms and begin construction.
Maremont, Frenchman's Terrace's most vocal
supporter outside of the Stanford
Administration, died of leukemia on Sept. 1.

Maremont's death renewed speculation
that Frenchman's Terrace was finally
doomed. But with Frenchman's Terrace's
record for surviving adversity, it would seem
premature to assume that it will never be
built.
Although inflation has caused each delay
to increase thy project's cost, Urban
Coalition officials believe that the project is
still financially feasible.
Wayne Smith, acting director of the
Midpeninsula Housing Corporation, stated
last week that he hopes HUD will approve
the project in the near future. Assuming that
the University will persuade a majority of the
city council to annex the land, Frenchman's
Terrace might finally be reaching the end of
its treacherous planning stage.
Hopefully, HUD will allow Stanford to
retain the occupancy restrictions. The
University is providing its land and expertise
for the project and deserves the right to give
its employees special priorities.
Even Price's counsel, Dirk Murphy, admits
that there are no legal barriers to the
restrictions. As for the controversial price
levels, Robert Augsburger, University vice
president forbusiness and finance rightly notes
that the restrictions are necessary in order to
prevent the housing units from becoming
overpriced. None of the units would be on
the ghetto level foreseen by the projects
opponents. Frenchman's
Terrace is proof of the University's basic
commitment to ameliorating housing
shortages. It is also an example of how the
best intentions can be thwarted by
ineluctable circumstances.
