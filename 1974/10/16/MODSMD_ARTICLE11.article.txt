# Student Input On Housing Sought
## 
### Cecile Herold 
Last week, the ASSU
Committee on Services to
Students (COSS) met formally for
the first time. Perhaps you didn't
know a committee on student
services exists. As an introduction,
then, we are the group which
oversees, by maintaining,
improving or initiating, any
non-curricular services provided
for the students by the University,
including housing and the food
service.
In early October, in a
committee orientation talk,
President Richard Lyman warned
all ASSU committees of a chief
hazard of committee work:
getting off to a late start. Often
committees don't flex their
muscles to develop authoritative,
constructive momentum until
April or May.
Realistically, our committee
.will have its problems, but I don't
believe this hesitation to begin
work will be among them: we
have been cast straightaway into
the University housing issue.
Our responsibility in studying
the housing system was
underscored in the COSS meeting
last week when Larry Horton,
associate dean of student affairs,
said, "There is no student who
does not have a vested interest in
this matter. In fact, every
University group is affected
faculty-at-large, house fellows,
alumni, parents, theme house
representatives, fraternities and
men and women students."
Not Just Frats
Horton also emphasized that
COSS is not reviewing the
fraternity system, but all
residential arrangements which
comprise Stanford housing.
Our revised program must
insure equal treatment of women,

but it need not insure the
longevity of the draw. We have
the opportunity to create an
entirely new housing plan with
entirely new policies.
The final recommendation of
COSS or a subcommittee of COSS
may influence University living
for the next decade. The decision
is too significant to be made
without adquate repesentation of
the University groups involved.
"Adequate" is when we can say
we honestly believe everyone has
had a chance to put forth an idea
on the issue. Please understand
that the meetings Horton is
holding at various locations

throughout campus are for
information and participation, not
for show.
Communication The Key
The key to COSS' success in
outlining the new program will be
thorough but rapid
communication.
Interaction of the committee
with the students depends upon
our outgoingness to tap proposals
and the incomingness of student
opinion. Background of the
Stanford Housing System plus a
large binder of statements entitled
Review of the Stanford
Residential System to Insure
Equal Treatment of Women are

open to the public in the Housing
Office ?t Old Union.
In solving our present issue, we
are met with the question, "Can
an institution of Stanford's size
communicate effectively?" It
must. Communication leads to
information, information to
soundness of decision. With
communication, the program we
recommend might be better than
adequate, incorporating the values
of understanding, forethought,
practicality and imagination.
