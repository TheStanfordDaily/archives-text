# Christianity Not Useless'
## 
### Robert Schier 
Steven Lewis misses the whole
point of Christianity, which he
describes as supernatural
hocus-pocus, useless in today's
world (Daily, Oct. 11). He claims
that Christian evangelists take
advantage of people's fears and
their desire for peace, security and
eternal life, while neglecting the
problems of reality.
Instead, he urges men to be
more actively involved in
eliminating the obvious problems
of society, and decries Christians
for their supposed neglect in this
area. Finally, the author attempts
to prove that Jesus Christ was a
thwarted revolutionary who was
executed for inciting rebellion.
Unfortunately, Lewis is in
error both in his ideas and the facts
he presents. Christians are
condemned for trying to satisfy
the primitive impulses and needs

which men feel must somehow be
met. But isn't that just what
humanists and others try to do?
Isn't the end of both groups the
same, and only the means of
attaining it different?
Jesus shows men how to draw
close to and know God. An
inevitable side effect of this is
happiness and peace and eternal
life. Christ came not to outwardly
overthrow governments, but to
destroy the human nature by
which man has made himself
miserable.
No Anti-Roman Statements
The absence of fiery
anti-Roman statements indicates
not that they have been purged by
his followers, but simply that
Jesus issued none. (One of
the Twelve was a turncoat tax
collector, anotner patriotic
Zealot.) Sure he came to change

nations and civilizations and to
eliminate evil and injustice. But he
accomplishes this by altering the
people themselves, so that
through them, society will
become more perfect.
Christ states, "Set your hearts
on His kingdom first, and on His
righteousness, and all these other
things will be given you as well."
By working in and through men,
God changes the world.
No one knows better
the problems of the world than a
Christian. Far from being the
recluses that Steven * Lewis
describes, Christians actively work
for a better world, all the while
knowing that the only way to
lasting inner and outer peace is
God.
