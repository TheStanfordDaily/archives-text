# Who Built Union?
## 
### Julia Harvey 
Who built the union at
Stanford? Unionization was
initiated by a group of blue collar
workers largely in the physical
plant, who formed the Stanford
Employees Association (SEA).
Gains were made but the
membership remained static.
Feeling the need for expert help
but fearful of the AFL, the SEA
affiliated with a "respectable"
independent organization, the
CSEA. The decision was
manipulated from the top and
proved unwise.
During this time, the "radical
left" was totally preoccupied with
the anti-war movement on
campus. The blue collar workers
were largely ignored.
However, it became apparent
that the support of organized
workers would greatly help the
anti-war activities on campus.
Therefore the peace activists who
worked at Stanford, moved into
the SEA en masse in order to
change its direction and take
control. These tactics were
resisted and resented and SEA
(foolishly) reacted by suspending
the new union activists.
SEA Split
The organization split, with
SEA retaining the blue collar
workers and a handful of white
collar and intellectual workers
forming United Stanford
Employees (USE). The division
was a setback for all. Yet this
enabled the group in USE to carry
on an educational campaign
resulting in activity that won many
grievances for workers.
Again a small group of blue
collar workers, rejecting both USE
and SEA as inadequate to the task
of winning major concessions,
reached out to the Teamsters
Union. They wanted a big, strong
organization to solve their
economic problems. Discussion
and activity blossomed out
and unionization realistically
became the order of the day for
the first tjme on campus.
The Teamsters applied to the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) for a hearing. At first
USE leadership scoffed at the
power of the NLRB hearing or
election to affect union
organization and was reluctant to
participate. But finally realizing it
would be isolated, USE intervened
in the hearings and as a result had
a place on the ballot for elections.
New Union Needed?
There was never any doubt
that the Teamsters would not win
the endorsement of a majority of
workers in the barganing unit.
Again, a year later, some blue
collar workers took the initiative
to explore joining the AFL and
held meetings with different
union organizations. But USE
leadership almost unanimously
opposed affiliation and feared
giving up its independence to a
bureaucratic AFL.
It soon became evident that
joining the AFL was popular
among workers and that USE
might lose its own members to the
AFL. The leadership was forced
to reconsider and it rapidly rushed
to affiliate with the
Service Employees International
(SEIU), an AFL member union.
The SEIU sent in a core of
experienced organizers who
worked diligently to break down
antagonisms between groups,
thereby helping to unify and build
USE. Today few can deny that
unification of the workers, the
organization of the strike, the
break through in negotiations
through the medium of "secret
high level negotiators" and the
final signing of the contract would
not have been accomplished
without the inspirational,
financial and organizational help
of the SEIU.
Who built the Union? Many
interacting forces, individuals and
groups. It was the blue collar
workers with their gut reactions
to their needs wha spearheaded us
correctly in the direction of union
organization and the AFL. It was
the dedicated white collar and
intellectual workers who used
their experiences and know-how
to concretize the organization.
USE must continue to extend
its organization for maximum
effectiveness. At the same time,
steps must be taken to prevent
the building of a bureaucratic
machine. Power to control must
be limited and proscribed or it
will be manipulated to serve those
in power.
Democracy always exists for
those in power, therefore rank
and file caucuses have proven
useful in other unions to
adequately bring the issues
forward for discussion and action.
In the long run, democracy can
only be accomplished through the
active participation of an
informed membership.

Who built the union at
Stanford? Unionization was
initiated by a group of blue collar
workers largely in the physical
plant, who formed the Stanford
Employees Association (SEA).
Gains were made but the
membership remained static.
Feeling the need for expert help
but fearful of the AFL, the SEA
affiliated with a "respectable"
independent organization, the
CSEA. The decision was
manipulated from the top and
proved unwise.
During this time, the "radical
left" was totally preoccupied with
the anti-war movement on
campus. The blue collar workers
were largely ignored.
However, it became apparent
that the support of organized
workers would greatly help the
anti-war activities on campus.
Therefore the peace activists who
worked at Stanford, moved into
the SEA en masse in order to
change its direction and take
control. These tactics were
resisted and resented and SEA
(foolishly) reacted by suspending
the new union activists.
SEA Split
The organization split, with
SEA retaining the blue collar
workers and a handful of white
collar and intellectual workers
forming United Stanford
Employees (USE). The division
was a setback for all. Yet this
enabled the group in USE to carry
on an educational campaign
resulting in activity that won many
grievances for workers.
Again a small group of blue
collar workers, rejecting both USE
and SEA as inadequate to the task
of winning major concessions,
reached out to the Teamsters
Union. They wanted a big, strong
organization to solve their
economic problems. Discussion
and activity blossomed out
and unionization realistically
became the order of the day for
the first tjme on campus.
The Teamsters applied to the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) for a hearing. At first
USE leadership scoffed at the
power of the NLRB hearing or
election to affect union
organization and was reluctant to
participate. But finally realizing it
would be isolated, USE intervened
in the hearings and as a result had
a place on the ballot for elections.
New Union Needed?
There was never any doubt
that the Teamsters would not win
the endorsement of a majority of
workers in the barganing unit.
Again, a year later, some blue
collar workers took the initiative
to explore joining the AFL and
held meetings with different
union organizations. But USE
leadership almost unanimously
opposed affiliation and feared
giving up its independence to a
bureaucratic AFL.
It soon became evident that
joining the AFL was popular
among workers and that USE
might lose its own members to the
AFL. The leadership was forced
to reconsider and it rapidly rushed
to affiliate with the
Service Employees International
(SEIU), an AFL member union.
The SEIU sent in a core of
experienced organizers who
worked diligently to break down
antagonisms between groups,
thereby helping to unify and build
USE. Today few can deny that
unification of the workers, the
organization of the strike, the
break through in negotiations
through the medium of "secret
high level negotiators" and the
final signing of the contract would
not have been accomplished
without the inspirational,
financial and organizational help
of the SEIU.
Who built the Union? Many
interacting forces, individuals and
groups. It was the blue collar
workers with their gut reactions
to their needs wha spearheaded us
correctly in the direction of union
organization and the AFL. It was
the dedicated white collar and
intellectual workers who used
their experiences and know-how
to concretize the organization.
USE must continue to extend
its organization for maximum
effectiveness. At the same time,
steps must be taken to prevent
the building of a bureaucratic
machine. Power to control must
be limited and proscribed or it
will be manipulated to serve those
in power.
