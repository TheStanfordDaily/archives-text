## Spinal Cord Center Gives Treatment, Inspiration 
### BOB LOWE Last of Three Parts 
The spinal cord injury victim who suddenly
becomes a quadriplegic, paralyzed from the
neck down, has a myriad of special needs
ranging from surgery to keep him alive to
special counseling to help him adjust to a new
sexual life..
The new Spinal Cord Injury Center at the
Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital is
trying to meet all of those needs, mending the
broken bodies and spirits of servicemen and
veterans.
The center, which opened in June, serves
quadriplegics and paraplegics paraylzed
from the waist down from all over the
northwest region of the country.
Director of the center Dr. Inder Perkash,
who also holds a faculty appointment at the
Stanford Medical Center, said there's a big

need for spinal injury centers.
Only 2500 Beds
He estimates that 10,000 Americans
receive spinal cord injuries each year, but
there are only 2500 beds in spinal injury
centers throughout the nation.
The centers have the big advantage of
offering the various and specialized facilities
that spinal patients require.
Spinal cord injuries once were considered
fatal or near-terminal.
"More than 60 percent of World War II
veterans with spinal cord injuries ultimately
died of urinary tract infections and failures,"
Perkash said. »
Near Normal
"Today the paraplegic can expect to live a
near normal lifespan and have a realtively
productive life."
A medical breakthrough a few years ago,

which Perkash contributed to, has helped end
urinary tract infection.
The new process is called intermittent
catheterization and trains the paraplegic's
body to take care of its bladder functions
without catheterization.
In catheterization a tube is passed through
the uretha to drain the bladder. Until
recently, the catheter was left in place for
long periods of time in paralyzed patients,
often resulting in infection.
Now patients are taught to catheterize
themselves. The frequency of catheterization
is reduced gradually with increased
spontaneous voiding.
Patterns Established
Perkash said the process "establishes
patterns to the spinal cord" and fairly normal
functioning is possible. Eventually
catheterization becomes unnecessary.
Intermittent catheterization is only one
way that the center aids the paralyzed.
Facilities and experts ranging from
neurosurgeons and urologists to psychologists
and physical therapists help the patients make
many difficult adjustments.
Patients enter the center in all phases of
recovery. Some arrive hours after the injury
while others are referred to the center weeks
later.
Recently a veteran fractured his spine in a
motorcycle accident on Page Mill Road, about
two miles from the center. Within two hours
he was being cared for at the center. Usually,
however, the spinal cord injury victim doesn't
reach the center that quickly.
Car Accident
Mike Thomas, 25, fractured his spine in a
car accident in Florida. He spent the next four
months in the orthopedics ward of a Florida
military hospital.
"It was the kind of place where guys would
come in with broken arms and leave after two
days," Thomas said.
For Thomas, seeing other men come and
go, it was a frustrating experience which left
him very depressed.
Now a patient at the center, Thomas says
he feels fortunate when he sees other patients
much worse off than he. He considers himself
very lucky when he didn't completely sever

his spinal cord and will walk again one day.
An Inspiration
Most of the patients at the center will
always be confined to a wheelchair. But being
in a place with other spinal cord injury victims
is an inspiration and perhaps, is the center's
greatest asset.
Patients see other paraplegics and
quadriplegics learning how to transfer from
bed to wheelchair or learning how to drive a
car by hand controls.
The example setting must have good
effects because the morale at the center is
extremely high.
Technology plays a big role in aiding the
paralyzed. New inventions constantly make
life easier for the patient who can't walk.
Environmental Controls
Several beds at the center are equipped
with environmental controls controls that a
person can operate as long as he can use his
mouth.
By blowing or sucking on a plasic tube
placed near his mouth, the patient can control
the volume and channel selection on a nearby
television, raise and lower parts of his bed and
call a nurse, among other things.
Motorized wheelchairs, completely
controlled by the mouth, also have been
invented and Perkash says that soon a
typewriter will be developed that operates on
the blowing and sucking concept.
The occupational therapy department at
the center concentrates on developing new
devices to meet the individual needs of
patients.
Feeds Himself
One patient, injured in an auto accident, has
movement only in his head and slight
movement in one arm. Therapists developed a
special device so that he can feed himself.
Essentially, the device consists of an
overhead frame which holds two large springs.
The springs attach to the patient's arm, lifting
enough weight so that he can move it.
An extra long spoon enables him to feed
himself inspite of the arm's limited range of
movement.
The center also treats around 60
outpatients who come periodically four
routine tests or for medical problems that
aren't too serious.

Perkash said the Veterans Administration
will expand the spinal cord injury center soon,
doubling its capacity.
In two more years Perkash plans to develop
an outpatient service at the Stanford Medical
Center. He also hopes to have a sharing
program with Stanford so non-veterans can
benefit from the center's facilities.

"It was the kind of place where guys would
come in with broken arms and leave after two
days," Thomas said.
For Thomas, seeing other men come and
go, it was a frustrating experience which left
him very depressed.
Now a patient at the center, Thomas says
he feels fortunate when he sees other patients
much worse off than he. He considers himself
very lucky when he didn't completely sever

his spinal cord and will walk again one day.
An Inspiration
Most of the patients at the center will
always be confined to a wheelchair. But being
in a place with other spinal cord injury victims
is an inspiration and perhaps, is the center's
greatest asset.
Patients see other paraplegics and
quadriplegics learning how to transfer from
bed to wheelchair or learning how to drive a
car by hand controls.
The example setting must have good
effects because the morale at the center is
extremely high.
Technology plays a big role in aiding the
paralyzed. New inventions constantly make
life easier for the patient who can't walk.
Environmental Controls
Several beds at the center are equipped
with environmental controls controls that a
person can operate as long as he can use his
mouth.
By blowing or sucking on a plasic tube
placed near his mouth, the patient can control
the volume and channel selection on a nearby
television, raise and lower parts of his bed and
call a nurse, among other things.
Motorized wheelchairs, completely
controlled by the mouth, also have been
invented and Perkash says that soon a
typewriter will be developed that operates on
the blowing and sucking concept.
The occupational therapy department at
the center concentrates on developing new
devices to meet the individual needs of
patients.
Feeds Himself
One patient, injured in an auto accident, has
movement only in his head and slight
movement in one arm. Therapists developed a
special device so that he can feed himself.
Essentially, the device consists of an
overhead frame which holds two large springs.
The springs attach to the patient's arm, lifting
enough weight so that he can move it.
An extra long spoon enables him to feed
himself inspite of the arm's limited range of
movement.
The center also treats around 60
outpatients who come periodically four
routine tests or for medical problems that
aren't too serious.

Perkash said the Veterans Administration
will expand the spinal cord injury center soon,
doubling its capacity.
In two more years Perkash plans to develop
an outpatient service at the Stanford Medical
Center. He also hopes to have a sharing
program with Stanford so non-veterans can
benefit from the center's facilities.

The spinal cord injury victim who suddenly
becomes a quadriplegic, paralyzed from the
neck down, has a myriad of special needs
ranging from surgery to keep him alive to
special counseling to help him adjust to a new
sexual life..
The new Spinal Cord Injury Center at the
Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital is
trying to meet all of those needs, mending the
broken bodies and spirits of servicemen and
veterans.
The center, which opened in June, serves
quadriplegics and paraplegics paraylzed
from the waist down from all over the
northwest region of the country.
Director of the center Dr. Inder Perkash,
who also holds a faculty appointment at the
Stanford Medical Center, said there's a big

need for spinal injury centers.
Only 2500 Beds
He estimates that 10,000 Americans
receive spinal cord injuries each year, but
there are only 2500 beds in spinal injury
centers throughout the nation.
The centers have the big advantage of
offering the various and specialized facilities
that spinal patients require.
Spinal cord injuries once were considered
fatal or near-terminal.
"More than 60 percent of World War II
veterans with spinal cord injuries ultimately
died of urinary tract infections and failures,"
Perkash said. »
Near Normal
"Today the paraplegic can expect to live a
near normal lifespan and have a realtively
productive life."
A medical breakthrough a few years ago,

which Perkash contributed to, has helped end
urinary tract infection.
The new process is called intermittent
catheterization and trains the paraplegic's
body to take care of its bladder functions
without catheterization.
In catheterization a tube is passed through
the uretha to drain the bladder. Until
recently, the catheter was left in place for
long periods of time in paralyzed patients,
often resulting in infection.
Now patients are taught to catheterize
themselves. The frequency of catheterization
is reduced gradually with increased
spontaneous voiding.
Patterns Established
Perkash said the process "establishes
patterns to the spinal cord" and fairly normal
functioning is possible. Eventually
catheterization becomes unnecessary.
Intermittent catheterization is only one
way that the center aids the paralyzed.
Facilities and experts ranging from
neurosurgeons and urologists to psychologists
and physical therapists help the patients make
many difficult adjustments.
Patients enter the center in all phases of
recovery. Some arrive hours after the injury
while others are referred to the center weeks
later.
Recently a veteran fractured his spine in a
motorcycle accident on Page Mill Road, about
two miles from the center. Within two hours
he was being cared for at the center. Usually,
however, the spinal cord injury victim doesn't
reach the center that quickly.
Car Accident
Mike Thomas, 25, fractured his spine in a
car accident in Florida. He spent the next four
months in the orthopedics ward of a Florida
military hospital.
"It was the kind of place where guys would

For Thomas, seeing other men come and

therapist.
The spinal cord injury victim who suddenly
becomes a quadriplegic, paralyzed from the
neck down, has a myriad of special needs
ranging from surgery to keep him alive to
special counseling to help him adjust to a new
sexual life..
The new Spinal Cord Injury Center at the
Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital is
trying to meet all of those needs, mending the
broken bodies and spirits of servicemen and
veterans.
The center, which opened in June, serves
quadriplegics and paraplegics paraylzed
from the waist down from all over the
northwest region of the country.
Director of the center Dr. Inder Perkash,
who also holds a faculty appointment at the
Stanford Medical Center, said there's a big

need for spinal injury centers.
Only 2500 Beds
He estimates that 10,000 Americans
receive spinal cord injuries each year, but
there are only 2500 beds in spinal injury
centers throughout the nation.
The centers have the big advantage of
offering the various and specialized facilities
that spinal patients require.
Spinal cord injuries once were considered
fatal or near-terminal.
"More than 60 percent of World War II
veterans with spinal cord injuries ultimately
died of urinary tract infections and failures,"
Perkash said. »
Near Normal
"Today the paraplegic can expect to live a
near normal lifespan and have a realtively
productive life."
A medical breakthrough a few years ago,

which Perkash contributed to, has helped end
urinary tract infection.
The new process is called intermittent
catheterization and trains the paraplegic's
body to take care of its bladder functions
without catheterization.
In catheterization a tube is passed through
the uretha to drain the bladder. Until
recently, the catheter was left in place for
long periods of time in paralyzed patients,
often resulting in infection.
Now patients are taught to catheterize
themselves. The frequency of catheterization
is reduced gradually with increased
spontaneous voiding.
Patterns Established
Perkash said the process "establishes
patterns to the spinal cord" and fairly normal
functioning is possible. Eventually
catheterization becomes unnecessary.
Intermittent catheterization is only one
way that the center aids the paralyzed.
Facilities and experts ranging from
neurosurgeons and urologists to psychologists
and physical therapists help the patients make
many difficult adjustments.
Patients enter the center in all phases of
recovery. Some arrive hours after the injury
while others are referred to the center weeks
later.
Recently a veteran fractured his spine in a
motorcycle accident on Page Mill Road, about
two miles from the center. Within two hours
he was being cared for at the center. Usually,
however, the spinal cord injury victim doesn't
reach the center that quickly.
Car Accident
Mike Thomas, 25, fractured his spine in a
car accident in Florida. He spent the next four
months in the orthopedics ward of a Florida
military hospital.
"It was the kind of place where guys would
come in with broken arms and leave after two
days," Thomas said.
For Thomas, seeing other men come and
go, it was a frustrating experience which left
him very depressed.
Now a patient at the center, Thomas says
he feels fortunate when he sees other patients
much worse off than he. He considers himself
very lucky when he didn't completely sever

his spinal cord and will walk again one day.
An Inspiration
Most of the patients at the center will
always be confined to a wheelchair. But being
in a place with other spinal cord injury victims
is an inspiration and perhaps, is the center's
greatest asset.
Patients see other paraplegics and
quadriplegics learning how to transfer from
bed to wheelchair or learning how to drive a
car by hand controls.
The example setting must have good
effects because the morale at the center is
extremely high.
Technology plays a big role in aiding the
paralyzed. New inventions constantly make
life easier for the patient who can't walk.
Environmental Controls
Several beds at the center are equipped
with environmental controls controls that a
person can operate as long as he can use his
mouth.
By blowing or sucking on a plasic tube
placed near his mouth, the patient can control
the volume and channel selection on a nearby
television, raise and lower parts of his bed and
call a nurse, among other things.
Motorized wheelchairs, completely
controlled by the mouth, also have been
invented and Perkash says that soon a
typewriter will be developed that operates on
the blowing and sucking concept.
The occupational therapy department at
the center concentrates on developing new
devices to meet the individual needs of
patients.
Feeds Himself
One patient, injured in an auto accident, has
movement only in his head and slight
movement in one arm. Therapists developed a
special device so that he can feed himself.
Essentially, the device consists of an
overhead frame which holds two large springs.
The springs attach to the patient's arm, lifting
enough weight so that he can move it.
An extra long spoon enables him to feed
himself inspite of the arm's limited range of
movement.
The center also treats around 60
outpatients who come periodically four
routine tests or for medical problems that
aren't too serious.

Perkash said the Veterans Administration
will expand the spinal cord injury center soon,
doubling its capacity.
In two more years Perkash plans to develop
an outpatient service at the Stanford Medical
Center. He also hopes to have a sharing
program with Stanford so non-veterans can
benefit from the center's facilities.
