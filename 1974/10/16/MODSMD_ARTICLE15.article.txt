# ASSU 'Course Review' Seeks Permanent Office
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The quality of this year's ASSU Course Review
will decline if it doesn't get an office somewhere
soon, say editors Cliff Schireson and Valerie Tonat.
Without filing cabinets and a central location,
"We can only do so much," said Schireson, the
humanities editor.
The editors have already had to break the
Course Review's standing promise to let anyone
look at its files on request.
Files Scattered
With files scattered between an ASSU office,
several dorm rooms and his car, getting to the
records has been nearly impossible, Schireson
explained.
"We haven't been able to meet the requests" for
last year's data, said social sciences editor Tonat.
The Course Review's predicament is "basically
Jim Friend's fault," she said. The former ASSU vice
president (who graduated last year and is now in
South America) promised last year's editors that
they would get space in the Storke Publications
building, said ASSU Vice President Ann Carter.
Proper Channels
Apparently, "negotiations for space weren't
made through proper channels," Carter said. ASSU
Course Review files were ousted from the ASSU
Tresidder offices at the end of June to make room
for the Action Research Liaison Office (ARLO).
The future of the Course Review has become
tied to that of Live Oak and the Chaparral,
publications which are trying to get or retain space
in Storke. If Live Oak is given space in Storke, the
Course Review will inherit Live Oak's offices at the
old Alpha Sig fraternity house. But Carter said she
is attempting to get the Course Review installed at
Storke.
As a final alternative, said Carter, the Course
Review can have temporary space in her office, but

the editors will have to find another permanent
place to work in.
'Best Alternative'
Carter calls Storke the "best alternative" for the
Course Review because the supplies and lay-out
tables are there.
However, ASSU Publications Board Chairman
Rich Jaroslovsky said the Review's chances of
getting an office there "aren't so good" because
"there isn't any permanent space in Storke to
give."
He pointed out that Live Oak is ahead of the
Course Review in its request for half of the
Chaparral's office space, while the other half will
probably be retained by Chaparral.
The decision over who gets the space will be
made within two weeks at the next Publications
Board meeting, Jaroslovsky said.
Meanwhile, Course Review editors will have
other problems to contend with, including the
resignation of sciences editor Stuart Bursten.
Bursten said he would "fill in as long as they need
me" but added that he doesn't have the time to be
an editor. His resignation took effect yesterday.
$lOOO Debt
The Course Review also owes over $lOOO to the.
ASSU, but when the Review is paid by the
bookstore and advertisers, it will have more than
enough to pay its debt, according to Carter. Carter
said she has sent notices to the advertisers and
expects payment by the end of the month.
Tonat and Schireson will now begin sorting
questionnaires circulated last spring quarter, and
deciding from the preliminary class lists which
courses will be reviewed this quarter.
"We're confident that we'll get something," said
Schireson. "I'm not really that picky ... if I could
do it here [in my room] I would."
