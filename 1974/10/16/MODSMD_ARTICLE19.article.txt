# Five Coeds Write Women's 'Guide'
## 
### VALERIE DOW 
A new publication is
circulating the campus somewhat
surreptitiously this fall. It is not
underground press. It's simply a
limited edition of the first Guide
for Stanford Women.
The Guide provides a directory
for the myriad of organizations
and services available to women
through the University
surrounding community, but it
also aims at inspiring women to
make use of these resources.
The 40-page booklet lists
information sources for "the
academic woman," available legal
and political aid, employment and
health services and tips on basic
"survival" (e.g. safety precautions,
automobile repair, rape crisis
center, etc.)
The Guide is the creation of
five undergraduate and graduate
women students: Terry Borchers,
Barbara Brown, Cynthia Davis,
Debra Herman, and Wendy Scott.
Davis, a senior, explained, "We
felt there were problems we as
women students were facing and
we were all frustrated by not
knowing about these resources
until it was too late."
'Guide's' Purpose
The cover of the Guide is
emblazoned with large black print
depicting five situations faced by
women in which the booklet
could be used: "You've seen your
advisor six times and he still
doesn't know your
name ... you're three weeks
late ... you want to play lacrosse
but there's no women's
team . .. your bike has a flat
tire ... you need a job but the ads
say 'male preferred.' "
From there the Guide launches
its effort to cut down regrets
caused by 20/20 hindsight and to
expedite the process of learning to
function effectively in the
University.
The five women began the
project last spring and worked to
compile information throughout
the summer.
The Guide has proved

enlightening for the University as
well as for women students. Leah
Kaplan, assistant to the dean of
student affairs, said she feels the
booklet has pointed out some
important needs of women
students particularly in areas of
academic advising and career
counseling.
Resources Cited
The section on academics is
very helpful in listing resource
people within each department,
she commented.
Kaplan, whose specific concern
is women students, praised the
orientation of the Guide for
"making it easier for women to
reach out and meet some of their
own needs."
The Guide, as a
student-initiated project, gained
financial support from a variety of
offices in the University, among
them the ASSU, the dean of
undergraduate studies, dean of
graduate studies, campus affairs,
committee for education and
employment of women and
residential education.
Publishing costs prevented
printing one copy for each woman
student. The Guide was given to
freshmen and transfer women in
registration packets as well as to
members of the residence staff.
Additional copies are available at
Kaplan's office on the third floor
of Old Union and the Center for
Research on Women (CROW) in
Polya Hall.
Reaction
Reaction to the Guide has been
favorable. Freshman women have
said the information has been
reassuring and good to have for
future reference. Upperclass
women commented that they
were pleased with the Guide 's
practical and academic utility.
Questionnaires will be
circulated to evaluate the Guide in
the spring, Guide authors said.
Both the editors and financial
supporters of the Guide said they
hope that other students will
revise and continue the women's
handbook in the future.

eucalyptus trees near the intersection of Panama Street and Campus

Reaction
Reaction to the Guide has been
favorable. Freshman women have
said the information has been
reassuring and good to have for
future reference. Upperclass
women commented that they
were pleased with the Guide 's
practical and academic utility.
Questionnaires will be
circulated to evaluate the Guide in
the spring, Guide authors said.
Both the editors and financial
supporters of the Guide said they
hope that other students will
revise and continue the women's
handbook in the future.

STUMPED—The University has begun removal of several dead
eucalyptus trees near the intersection of Panama Street and Campus
Drive near the Medical Center. The trees are considered hazardous to
passersby because they overhang the street.
A new publication is
circulating the campus somewhat
surreptitiously this fall. It is not
underground press. It's simply a
limited edition of the first Guide
for Stanford Women.
The Guide provides a directory
for the myriad of organizations
and services available to women
through the University
surrounding community, but it
also aims at inspiring women to
make use of these resources.
The 40-page booklet lists
information sources for "the
academic woman," available legal
and political aid, employment and
health services and tips on basic
"survival" (e.g. safety precautions,
automobile repair, rape crisis
center, etc.)
The Guide is the creation of
five undergraduate and graduate
women students: Terry Borchers,
Barbara Brown, Cynthia Davis,
Debra Herman, and Wendy Scott.
Davis, a senior, explained, "We
felt there were problems we as
women students were facing and
we were all frustrated by not
knowing about these resources
until it was too late."
'Guide's' Purpose
The cover of the Guide is
emblazoned with large black print
depicting five situations faced by
women in which the booklet
could be used: "You've seen your
advisor six times and he still
doesn't know your
name ... you're three weeks
late ... you want to play lacrosse
but there's no women's
team . .. your bike has a flat
tire ... you need a job but the ads
say 'male preferred.' "
From there the Guide launches
its effort to cut down regrets
caused by 20/20 hindsight and to
expedite the process of learning to
function effectively in the
University.
The five women began the
project last spring and worked to
compile information throughout
the summer.
The Guide has proved

enlightening for the University as
well as for women students. Leah
Kaplan, assistant to the dean of
student affairs, said she feels the
booklet has pointed out some
important needs of women
students particularly in areas of
academic advising and career
counseling.
Resources Cited
The section on academics is
very helpful in listing resource
people within each department,
she commented.
Kaplan, whose specific concern
is women students, praised the
orientation of the Guide for
"making it easier for women to
reach out and meet some of their
own needs."
The Guide, as a
student-initiated project, gained
financial support from a variety of
offices in the University, among
them the ASSU, the dean of
undergraduate studies, dean of
graduate studies, campus affairs,
committee for education and
employment of women and
residential education.
Publishing costs prevented
printing one copy for each woman
student. The Guide was given to
freshmen and transfer women in
registration packets as well as to
members of the residence staff.
Additional copies are available at
Kaplan's office on the third floor
of Old Union and the Center for
Research on Women (CROW) in
Polya Hall.
