# Lyman Discusses Budget
## Marginal Costs To Be Cut 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The University is attempting to
trim its existing budget in order to
combat a projected $22 million deficit
for the next five years, President
Richard Lyman said yesterday.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman said he doesn't
know how much emergency cutting is
required, but added the University will
eliminate as many peripheral expenses
as possible.
Expenses like filling empty staff
positions and purchasing new
stationary may be deferred, but the
University will eventually have to
formulate long-range financial
readjustment programs Lyman said.
Lyman said it takes a long time to
decide which programs can be cut. If
the University slices its programs
hastily, it may have regrets later if the
deficit is less than anticipated, Lyman
said.

Not Endowments
Lyman repeated his previous
assertion that the University will do
everything possible to avoid dipping
into its endowment fund in order to
pay expenses. "Every dollar taken out
of reserves is a dollar lost for future
years," he said.

Although Lyman acknowledged
that the University's financial position
is "a grimmer picture than we thought
it would be," he noted that Stanford's
problems "closely parallel" the
dilemma of other major private
universities.
When asked if the University's
ability to attract top faculty members
has been impaired by its financial
problems, Lyman said no problems
exist in the area of faculty
recruitment.
"There is no reason to conclude
that we have a problem," Lyman said.
"Our competitive situation has never
been better than it is now."
Not Insignificant
Although Lyman said the
opportunities for hiring women are
limited by financial difficulties, he said
Stanford has made progress in hiring
women "that is by no means
insignificant."
Lyman explained that many of the
most qualified women have already
been hired by Stanford, and there is
little remaining talent on which to
draw.
"It is extremely unlikely that the
old pace can be maintained
indefinitely," Lyman said.

He added the University has no
intentions of setting quotas for the
hiring of women.
Lyman dismissed as overly
"simple" the possibility that the
housing shortage and the financial
deficit could be erased by reducing
admissions.
Less Tuition
"The most immediate impact
would be to reduce tuition
payments—the biggest source of
University income," Lyman declared.
He added it would be hard to reduce
expenses in proportion to the number
of students who would be eliminated.
Lyman opposed a proposal made
by Economics Prof. Ronald I.
McKinnon that the budget could be
cut by reducing the athletic program.
"Intercollegiate sports pay for
themselves and a little bit more,"
Lyman declared. "It wouldn't be to
our advantage to cut it."
Lyman also discussed the proposed
ASSU lecture note service, noting that
he has no particular opposition to the
program.
"I don't see a dire threat to the
academic exercise," Lyman stated. But
he said there is some value in taking
notes, recalling that as a student,
he learned more by takingnotes because
he was forced to quickly decide which
material was most important.

that we have a problem," Lyman said.
"Our competitive situation has never
been better than it is now."
Not Insignificant
Although Lyman said the
opportunities for hiring women are
limited by financial difficulties, he said
Stanford has made progress in hiring
women "that is by no means
insignificant."
Lyman explained that many of the
most qualified women have already
been hired by Stanford, and there is
little remaining talent on which to
draw.
"It is extremely unlikely that the
old pace can be maintained
indefinitely," Lyman said.

He added the University has no
intentions of setting quotas for the
hiring of women.
Lyman dismissed as overly
"simple" the possibility that the
housing shortage and the financial
deficit could be erased by reducing
admissions.
Less Tuition
"The most immediate impact
would be to reduce tuition
payments—the biggest source of
University income," Lyman declared.
He added it would be hard to reduce
expenses in proportion to the number
of students who would be eliminated.
Lyman opposed a proposal made
by Economics Prof. Ronald I.
McKinnon that the budget could be
cut by reducing the athletic program.
"Intercollegiate sports pay for
themselves and a little bit more,"
Lyman declared. "It wouldn't be to
our advantage to cut it."
Lyman also discussed the proposed
ASSU lecture note service, noting that
he has no particular opposition to the
program.
"I don't see a dire threat to the
academic exercise," Lyman stated. But
he said there is some value in taking
notes, recalling that as a student,
he learned more by takingnotes because
he was forced to quickly decide which
material was most important.
The University is attempting to
trim its existing budget in order to
combat a projected $22 million deficit
for the next five years, President
Richard Lyman said yesterday.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman said he doesn't
know how much emergency cutting is
required, but added the University will
eliminate as many peripheral expenses
as possible.
Expenses like filling empty staff
positions and purchasing new
stationary may be deferred, but the
University will eventually have to
formulate long-range financial
readjustment programs Lyman said.
Lyman said it takes a long time to
decide which programs can be cut. If
the University slices its programs
hastily, it may have regrets later if the
deficit is less than anticipated, Lyman
said.

Not Endowments
Lyman repeated his previous
assertion that the University will do
everything possible to avoid dipping
into its endowment fund in order to
pay expenses. "Every dollar taken out
of reserves is a dollar lost for future
years," he said.

Although Lyman acknowledged
that the University's financial position
is "a grimmer picture than we thought
it would be," he noted that Stanford's
problems "closely parallel" the
dilemma of other major private
universities.
When asked if the University's
ability to attract top faculty members
has been impaired by its financial
problems, Lyman said no problems
exist in the area of faculty
recruitment.
"There is no reason to conclude
that we have a problem," Lyman said.
"Our competitive situation has never
been better than it is now."
