# Text Of Lyman Letter On Title IX
## 
### 
Honorable Casper Weinberger
Secretary

330 Independence Avenue, S.W.
Washington, D.C. 20003
Dear Cap:
My staff has, on my behalf, reviewed the
proposed regulations which would implement
Title IX of the Higher Education Amendments
of 1972. We have also participated in a review of
them through the Association of American
Universities, and we join in that Association's
comments.

| Among those comments is one which I find of
I particular concern. That is the one which points
I up the importance of your Department's
| recognizing that the burden of maintaining
I records which prove non-discrimination is a
most considerable one, and that absent a specific
I charge an institution should not be called upon
to do so. The cost of compliance with federal
regulations now is telling, and especially so in
| these times of financial stringency. To be
required to institute yet another system for
| monitoring such things as admission tests and
criteria would be an unwarranted and
unnecessary burden.
| I am persuaded that yet another
section-by-section analysis of these regulations,
- of which I am sure you are getting a
considerable number is not necessary. I have no
doubt that every problem perceived in them by
| thoughtful persons in higher education has been
or will be cited to you. Despite the burden it
will place on you I cannot urge you too strongly
| to give these comments your careful attention.
| The concern I wish to emphasize is that I see in
. these proposals efforts by federal policy-makers

to reach into the educational process to a degree
not called for in order to meet the requirements
of the law. Let me cite two examples, one minor
and one of considerable import.

To take the minor one, Section 86.21(c)(4)
forbids a university from making pre-admission
inquiries into marital status. I assume that this
prohibition is founded on the belief that in some
instances married women are the victims of
discrimination. But if an institution with limited
housing available wishes to make sure that it
doesn't overburden its student body with
married students of either sex, should it not be
allowed to inquire prior to admission so long as
it doesn't use what it learns in a discriminatory
way? I can't see why not.

Now to the issue of considerable import. Section
86.38(b) would require us annually to
determine, using a method acceptable to the
Director of the Office of Civil Rights, "in what
sports members of each sex would desire to
compete." This obviously raises a host of
practical problems which are being brought to
your attention. What troubles me even more is
the fact that this represents a suggestion that
there shall be federally mandated ways of
arriving at institutional decisions. If this is
required for deciding which athletic programs to
offer, it is equally applicable to other programs
or courses. The prospect of the government's
dictating to institutions the processes by which
they must decide which programs to offer and in
what amount, is one that should be as troubling
to you as it is to us.
I feel most strongly that the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare is restricted to
looking at the consequences of the actions of
institutions covered by the law, and that it
should not and cannot look at how it was
decided to take those actions. These two

examples barely begin to cover the concerns
which we feel about these proposals. Their
impact on such things as athletics, the right of
students to form voluntary single-sex
organizations, and the benefits for part-time
employees are all being brought to your
attention. I note them only as two of the more
notable examples of where the regulations
exceed the reach of the law they are meant to
implement.
There is one other issue of considerable moment
here at Stanford. Our interpretation of the
regulations places the fraternity system here in
jeopardy. We believe that student living groups
should be allowed to choose to be single-sex so
long as the quantity and quality of housing
available to each sex is proportionate, and that
the regulations should be appropriately amended
so as to permit this.
The length, complexity and uncertain impact of
these regulations, and what I know to be the
depth of concern which they have raised in the
higher education community, prompt me to a
suggestion. That is, that they should be
reconsidered in light of all of the comments
which you are receiving, published again (with
appropriate revisions) for yet another round of
comments.
I suspect that this prospect is one which you and
your staff would not relish. But at issue here are
numerous issues of major concern. Rules such as
these, which would have a profound impact on
important aspects of the educational community
and processes should be subject to the closest
and most careful scrutiny by all concerned. The
consequences of error are much greater, I
believe, than the consequences of delay.
Sincerely,

exceed the reach of the law they are meant to
implement.
There is one other issue of considerable moment
here at Stanford. Our interpretation of the
regulations places the fraternity system here in
jeopardy. We believe that student living groups
should be allowed to choose to be single-sex so
long as the quantity and quality of housing
available to each sex is proportionate, and that
the regulations should be appropriately amended
so as to permit this.
The length, complexity and uncertain impact of
these regulations, and what I know to be the
depth of concern which they have raised in the
higher education community, prompt me to a
suggestion. That is, that they should be
reconsidered in light of all of the comments
which you are receiving, published again (with
appropriate revisions) for yet another round of
comments.
I suspect that this prospect is one which you and
your staff would not relish. But at issue here are
numerous issues of major concern. Rules such as
these, which would have a profound impact on
important aspects of the educational community
and processes should be subject to the closest
and most careful scrutiny by all concerned. The
consequences of error are much greater, I
believe, than the consequences of delay.

Dear Cap:
My staff has, on my behalf, reviewed the
proposed regulations which would implement
Title IX of the Higher Education Amendments
of 1972. We have also participated in a review of
them through the Association of American
Universities, and we join in that Association's
comments.

| Among those comments is one which I find of
I particular concern. That is the one which points
I up the importance of your Department's
| recognizing that the burden of maintaining
I records which prove non-discrimination is a
most considerable one, and that absent a specific
I charge an institution should not be called upon
to do so. The cost of compliance with federal
regulations now is telling, and especially so in
| these times of financial stringency. To be
required to institute yet another system for
| monitoring such things as admission tests and
criteria would be an unwarranted and
unnecessary burden.
| I am persuaded that yet another
section-by-section analysis of these regulations,
- of which I am sure you are getting a
considerable number is not necessary. I have no
doubt that every problem perceived in them by
| thoughtful persons in higher education has been
or will be cited to you. Despite the burden it
will place on you I cannot urge you too strongly
| to give these comments your careful attention.
| The concern I wish to emphasize is that I see in
. these proposals efforts by federal policy-makers

to reach into the educational process to a degree
not called for in order to meet the requirements
of the law. Let me cite two examples, one minor
and one of considerable import.

To take the minor one, Section 86.21(c)(4)
forbids a university from making pre-admission
inquiries into marital status. I assume that this
prohibition is founded on the belief that in some
instances married women are the victims of
discrimination. But if an institution with limited
housing available wishes to make sure that it
doesn't overburden its student body with
married students of either sex, should it not be
allowed to inquire prior to admission so long as
it doesn't use what it learns in a discriminatory
way? I can't see why not.

Now to the issue of considerable import. Section
86.38(b) would require us annually to
determine, using a method acceptable to the
Director of the Office of Civil Rights, "in what
sports members of each sex would desire to
compete." This obviously raises a host of
practical problems which are being brought to
your attention. What troubles me even more is
the fact that this represents a suggestion that
there shall be federally mandated ways of
arriving at institutional decisions. If this is
required for deciding which athletic programs to
offer, it is equally applicable to other programs
or courses. The prospect of the government's
dictating to institutions the processes by which
they must decide which programs to offer and in
what amount, is one that should be as troubling
to you as it is to us.
I feel most strongly that the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare is restricted to
looking at the consequences of the actions of
institutions covered by the law, and that it
should not and cannot look at how it was
decided to take those actions. These two

examples barely begin to cover the concerns
which we feel about these proposals. Their
impact on such things as athletics, the right of
students to form voluntary single-sex
organizations, and the benefits for part-time
employees are all being brought to your
attention. I note them only as two of the more
notable examples of where the regulations
exceed the reach of the law they are meant to
implement.

determine, using a method acceptable to the
Director of the Office of Civil Rights, "in what
sports members of each sex would desire to
compete." This obviously raises a host of
practical problems which are being brought to
your attention. What troubles me even more is
the fact that this represents a suggestion that
there shall be federally mandated ways of
arriving at institutional decisions. If this is
required for deciding which athletic programs to
offer, it is equally applicable to other programs
or courses. The prospect of the government's
dictating to institutions the processes by which
they must decide which programs to offer and in
what amount, is one that should be as troubling
to you as it is to us.
I feel most strongly that the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare is restricted to
looking at the consequences of the actions of
institutions covered by the law, and that it
should not and cannot look at how it was
decided to take those actions. These two

examples barely begin to cover the concerns
which we feel about these proposals. Their
impact on such things as athletics, the right of
students to form voluntary single-sex
organizations, and the benefits for part-time
employees are all being brought to your
attention. I note them only as two of the more
notable examples of where the regulations
exceed the reach of the law they are meant to
implement.
There is one other issue of considerable moment
here at Stanford. Our interpretation of the
regulations places the fraternity system here in
jeopardy. We believe that student living groups
should be allowed to choose to be single-sex so
long as the quantity and quality of housing
available to each sex is proportionate, and that
the regulations should be appropriately amended
so as to permit this.
The length, complexity and uncertain impact of
these regulations, and what I know to be the
depth of concern which they have raised in the
higher education community, prompt me to a
suggestion. That is, that they should be
reconsidered in light of all of the comments
which you are receiving, published again (with
appropriate revisions) for yet another round of
comments.
I suspect that this prospect is one which you and
your staff would not relish. But at issue here are
numerous issues of major concern. Rules such as
these, which would have a profound impact on
important aspects of the educational community
and processes should be subject to the closest
and most careful scrutiny by all concerned. The
consequences of error are much greater, I
believe, than the consequences of delay.

Secretary
Health, Education and Welfare
330 Independence Avenue, S.W.

Dear Cap:
My staff has, on my behalf, reviewed the
proposed regulations which would implement
Title IX of the Higher Education Amendments
of 1972. We have also participated in a review of
them through the Association of American
Universities, and we join in that Association's
comments.

| Among those comments is one which I find of
I particular concern. That is the one which points
I up the importance of your Department's
| recognizing that the burden of maintaining
I records which prove non-discrimination is a
most considerable one, and that absent a specific
I charge an institution should not be called upon
to do so. The cost of compliance with federal
regulations now is telling, and especially so in
| these times of financial stringency. To be
required to institute yet another system for
| monitoring such things as admission tests and
criteria would be an unwarranted and
unnecessary burden.
| I am persuaded that yet another
section-by-section analysis of these regulations,
- of which I am sure you are getting a
considerable number is not necessary. I have no
doubt that every problem perceived in them by
| thoughtful persons in higher education has been
or will be cited to you. Despite the burden it
will place on you I cannot urge you too strongly
| to give these comments your careful attention.
| The concern I wish to emphasize is that I see in
. these proposals efforts by federal policy-makers

to reach into the educational process to a degree
not called for in order to meet the requirements
of the law. Let me cite two examples, one minor
and one of considerable import.

To take the minor one, Section 86.21(c)(4)
forbids a university from making pre-admission
inquiries into marital status. I assume that this
prohibition is founded on the belief that in some
instances married women are the victims of
discrimination. But if an institution with limited
housing available wishes to make sure that it
doesn't overburden its student body with
married students of either sex, should it not be
allowed to inquire prior to admission so long as
it doesn't use what it learns in a discriminatory
way? I can't see why not.

Now to the issue of considerable import. Section
86.38(b) would require us annually to
determine, using a method acceptable to the
Director of the Office of Civil Rights, "in what
sports members of each sex would desire to
compete." This obviously raises a host of
practical problems which are being brought to
your attention. What troubles me even more is
the fact that this represents a suggestion that
there shall be federally mandated ways of

or courses. The prospect of the government's

they must decide which programs to offer and in
what amount, is one that should be as troubling
