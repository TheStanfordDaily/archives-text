## Head Tackling: Too Risky Or Necessary To Football? 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Unlike the head coaches of
California and San Jose State,
Stanford's Jack Christiansen
doesn't approve of players using
their heads to tackle.
Many coaches teach players to
stick helmets into the ballcarrier's
midsection. But this practice is
under fire because of danger to
both the tackier and the offensive
man.
An ABC-TV special report,
aired Monday night, showed films
of two high school players dying
immediately upon making head
tackles which severed their spinal
cords. ABC also interviewed
players whose reliance on the
coach's methods led to paraplegia
rather than stardom.
Defenders of head tackling say
that tacklers won't be hurt if they
use their foreheads. But
Christiansen disagrees.
"It's natural that players are
going to duck their heads before
they tackle no matter what
they're taught." Christiansen
pointed to the back of his head.
"When you hit right there, you
can get damage to the spinal cord."
Safer Method
Christiansen says shoulder
tackling is just as effective as head
tackling, and has his players use
the safer shoulder method. He
doesn't frown on blocking with
the helmet, however, since impact
at the line of scrimmage, at low
speeds, has relatively low risk.
"It's just like a car. If I bang into
a car parked just ahead of me
nothing's going to happen, but if
we're both going at 60 miles an
hour..."
Both Cal's Mike White and
SJS's Darryl Rogers, interviewed
yesterday, said they approved of
head tackling. "You have to make
the head the starting point,"
White said. "That way, if the
ballcarrier goes one way, you
won't miss him.

"What people don't realize is
that 80 percent of the time, if you
have your tackier aim his head at
the guy's numbers, it'll end up
with one shoulder or the other
[hitting the ballcarrier] instead of
the head," White said.
Rogers agreed. "Every kid who
plays this game knows there's a
risk. We teach the kids to hit with
the forehead so they can get ahold
of the man."
Another Risk
Besides the risk to the tackier,
use of the helmet as an offensive,
rather than protective, weapon
can lead to injuries to the person
who is hit. Stanford quarterback
Mike Cordova had to be taken out
of the game for awhile Saturday
when he got a helmet in the
sternum, and is still a little sore.
Some head tackling is
prohibited because it can injure a
ballcarrier. The rulebook penalizes
spearing, which it defines as "a
deliberate and malicious use of
the head and helmet in an attempt

to punish an opponent after his
momentum is stopped."
Christiansen says that the rule
is too weak, because officials
seldom see malicious intent. He
wants the rule to be changed to
read "Spearing is a deliberate use
of the head and helmet in an
attempt to punish an opponent,"
whether or not his momentum is
stopped.
The other two major Bay Area
coaches don't agree. While Rogers
says that "spearing could be more
enforced," White's analysis sounds
as if he would favor loosening,
rather than tightening the rule.
White's View
"I don't consider it spearing if
the ballcarrier is still trying to get
loose. A tackier should be able to
hit the man. That's part of the
game." White added, however, that
he opposes any use of the helmet
that is specifically designed to
injure an opponent.
One case in which White
probably would say "no spearing"

and Christiansen certainly would
say "spearing," occured in the
Michigan game. Scott Laidlaw was
hit by a helmet after he was
stopped but before the whistle. In
this instance, there was no
penalty.
It seems that little can
motivate a change in the rules,
even though the ABC program
cited a study that said 93.3
percent of football's internal
injuries are caused by the helmet.
In fact, the only reason
coaching associations have
considered rule changes is because
of suits against coaches and
schools by parents of players
injured by head tackles. Previous
suits o.f this type however, have
been thrown out of court.
So little change seems possible.
And Christiansen, somewhat
bitterly, says he's told chief
officials that if one of his players
is ever seriously injured because of
a head tackle, he'll invite them
down to explain to the parents.
