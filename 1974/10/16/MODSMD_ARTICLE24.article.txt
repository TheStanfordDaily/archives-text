## Football Fortunes Decline 
### Mark Paul 
(Editor's Note: Mark Paul, a 1970 graduate, has
followed Stanford football for nine years. His
viewpoint does not necessarily represent the
opinion of the Daily sports staff. While in some
ways we disagree, we feel that since Paul's
comments are similar to those expressed by several
other fans, they represent a significant viewpoint
and should be heard. This is the'first of two parts.
The conclusion, dealing primarily with the Stanford
offense, will be printed Friday.)
Only three years ago John Ralston and his
Stanford football team marched proudly off the
Rose Bowl gridiron after their second consecutive
victory over a powerful Big Ten opponent.
Playing with their own entertaining combination
of reckless abandon and well-drilled precision, the
underdog Cardinals, by humbling the best team in
Ohio State's history and overtaking an equally
fearsome Michigan squad, had accomplished what
few football experts thought possible.
Today, Jack Christiansen's Cardinals, perhaps
the finest group of athletes ever assembled at
Stanford, are winless after their first five games.
The team which reported to fall drills in high spirit
and top physical shape is now bitter and
demoralized. As Brad Williams noted after the San
Jose game, "Something's wrong."
How has the football program which such a
short time ago turned out Rose Bowl winners fallen
on such hard times?
The key to John Ralston's success at Stanford
was his recognition that Stanford and its athletes
required different coaching techniques and
different styles of play than most big-time football
institutions.
Stanford football players, unlike those at most
schools, represent a fairly reliable cross section of
the male student population. Few wrap themselves
totally in the stereotypical football player role and
many take their studies seriously.
Shared Most Concerns
In the late 60s and early 70s this meant that
many football players shared with their fellow
students the concerns and attitudes widespread on
the campus. Athletes participated in peace marches
and sit-ins, smoked dope, dropped acid,
experimented with new life styles and questioned
the value of big-time collegiate sports.
Though Ralston had no sympathy for his
players' concerns and habits, he was willing to
tolerate them. Learning that he could command
their attention and loyalties only while they were
on the practice field, he used this limited time
effectively and did not make the impossible
demand that his players live only for football.
He tolerated long hair. He allowed the players to
set their own hours during the weeks before the
Michigan Rose Bowl. And not surprisingly, he
earned the grudging respect of the team. Though
few of them were comfortable with his Dale
Carnegie enthusiasm and his oppressive optimism,
the players grew to respect him for doing his job
well and letting them do theirs.
Bizarre Teams
By the normal standards of big-time football,
Ralston's teams were bizarre. The Cardinals won
the games they couldn't possibly win and lost the
ones they couldn't lose. The defensive line in the
Rose Bowl years, an antic group known as the
Thunderchickens, substituted on its own initiative.
Players on the field boogied with the band. The
offense used trick plays and lived by the pass. And
as often as not, the players had fun.
So did the fans. Ralston's teams were exciting to
watch even when they lost, and they kept the

stadium full. In an era when college students were
occupied with important political concerns,
Stanford students went to football games, not
because they took the game seriously, but because
the football team and the band shared the mood of
the rest of the campus.
Mood Shift
The mood of the football program has now
changed. At first glance there appears to be no
ready explanation for the shift. Jack Christiansen,
the Cardinal mentor, 1 seems on the surface to be
well suited to the task. An ex-professional defensive
star and head coach with a low-key manner, he
emphasizes execution, leaving aside the rah-rah and
fake emotional appeals that are the stock-in-trade
of many coaches in the college ranks.
But behind Christiansen's quiet facade hides a
strong desire to build Stanford into an efficient
football machine. While he stands impassively on
the practice field, arms folded across his chest,
watching his players run through their drills, the
assistant coaches do the heavy work of turning
Stanford into a miniature USC.
Increasingly the manner of the coaches is
domineering and the tone abusive. Players should
think more about football, less about classes.
Football, they seem to tell their charges, is
everything; scholarship athletes, they imply, owe
everything to the coaches and the football program.
Along with this desire for a big-time football
program goes a distrust of and a remoteness from
the athletes, particularly those who do not Fit the
stereotype of the "jock."
No Leadership
Unlike Ralston, Christiansen does not cultivate
or encourage leadership within the squad. Nor does
he provide his own personal leadership. For
example, quarterback Guy Benjamin had to seek
out Christiansen the Tuesday before the Illinois
game to find out if he would start.
Quarterbacks practice the entire week with only
the most rudimentary idea of what the game plan
will be.
These faults might be excused or overlooked by
players and fans if the coaching were a model of
efficiency and organization. Sadly, it is not.
Stanford's wretched punting game is directly
attributable to a coaching failure.
After having seen Tom Lynn's poor performance
last fall, the coaching staff had ample time to
recruit or develop a new punter. Instead they have
left Lynn with the punting job, a heavy burden
which apparently he doesn't wish to carry.
Stanford was clearly outcoached by Penn State's
Joe Paterno in a game the Cardinals could have
won, and several times in the subsequent games, the
team has been confused, wasting important time
outs, and been seemingly unprepared for maneuvers
by its opponents.
Bitter Feelings
These failures of the Christiansen regime have
created bitter feelings among the players. Many
players resent the verbal abuse dished out by some
of the assistant coaches and the implication that
they are at Stanford only by the good grace of the
Athletic Department.
Others feel their talents are being ignored
because they do not have the proper "attitude."
By failing to learn the key to John Ralston's
success while he served him as an assistant coach,
Christiansen faces the possibility of losing the
respect of what promised to be one of Stanford's
best teams.
