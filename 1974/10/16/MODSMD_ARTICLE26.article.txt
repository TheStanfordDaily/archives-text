# A's Ta 2-1 Lead Over L.A. In Series
## 
### Associated Press 
OAKLAND - The
rambunctious Oakland A's lead
baseball's 71st World Series
because a ball that Reggie Jackson
hit 15 feet last night did almost as
much damage as a couple of Los
Angeles Dodger home runs.
Jackson's squibbler broke off
catcher Joe Ferguson's glove for a
third-inning error that led to a
pair of unearned runs and helped
the A's to a 3-2 victory over the
Dodgers in the third game of the
Series. v
Oakland's sluggish offense
managed a mere five hits and the
Dodgers had seven, including huge
home runs by Bill Bunckner in the
eighth and Willie Crawford in the
ninth.
But the A's, as usual, found a
way to win.
"Some way, we seem to score
enough runs," said Manager Alvin
Dark after the third straight 3-2
game in this pitching-dominated
battle for baseball's world
championship.
Today's Game
The A's lead the classic two
games to one with Game Four set
for 5:30 p.m., PDT today.
Catfish Hunter earned his
fourth career World Series victory
with late-inning help from reliever
Rollie Fingers as the A's scored
just enough runs to win.
Two of those runs came in the
third inning, courtesy of some
daring baserunning by Bill North
and Ferguson's costly error.
North, hitless in 20
bat, stroked a one-out single.
"How about that?" the A's center
fielder said exultantly. "I've
finally got a World Series batting
average."
Cey Hey
With Bert Campaneris at bat,
North, who stole 54 bases during
the regular season, took off for
second. Campy swung and sent a
shot down the third base line.
Ron Cey dove for the ball and
made a dazzling stop.
Cey jumped to his feet and
threw out Campaneris, but North,
displaying some headsup
baserunning, kept right on going
and slid head first into third base.
Los Angeles starter A1
Downing, the retread left-hander,
who won just five games during
the regular season, seemed
unnerved by North's bit of daring.
He walked Sal Bando on a 3-2
pitch and then fell behind 3-1
against Jackson.
Meanwhile off the playing
field, an Oakland group sued
Charles 0. Finely yesterday,
saying he was negotiating to move
the A's to Seattle and asking a
court to enjoin him from doing
so.
The group composed of
about 20 A's fans, an Alameda
County supervisor and the
Alameda County Central Labor
Council said Finley had failed
to promote the team in an effort
to drive attendance down.
County Supervisor Tom Bates
said that if the A's are moved in
violation of their lease with the
Oakland Coliseum, it would cost
county taxpayers millions of
dollars and would cost the area
considerably more in loss or
prestige.
Finley, asked for comment on
the suit, said: "All of this is a
crock of shit."
