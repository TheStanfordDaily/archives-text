## Dodgers' Marshall Is An Ass 
### Glenn Garvin 
Mike Marshall is an ass. If we start with
this basic assumption, then we can explain a
great deal.
Like, for instance, why he refused to
speak to reporters after Sunday's World
Series game. Like why he refuses to sign
autographs for kids. Like why sportswriters
hate him.
A few years ago, when Marshall was just
another crummy pitcher getting bombed
regularly for the Seattle Pilots, he had time
to sign autographs and attend neighborhood
clinics on baseball.
Offbeat Guy
Back then.nobody thought much at all
about Marshall. He was just sort of an offbeat
guy, a baseball player who read books once
in a while. Big deal.
. Something's happened during the last
couple of years, though. The biggest change
is that Marshall is pitching a lot better. The
second thing is that he's discovered a pitching
method whereby he can play almost every
day. He appeared in over 100 games for Los
Angeles this year.
And now, instead of a pitcher, Marshall is
a kinesiologist. Now instead of reading a
book here and there he's a hot shot college
professor after a Ph.D. in physical education.
And now instead of teaching little kids how

to play baseball he refuses to sign pictures for
them.
It's amazing what success will do for a
guy.
Impossible
It's impossible to interview Marshall these
days without getting a lot of intellectualized
crap thrown back in your face. That is, you
get it if Marshall is in a sociable mood.
Normally he just says "no comment!"
For instance, Marshall played a key role in
Sunday's Los Angeles victory. With a narrow
3-2 lead in the ninth inning, he picked
Oakland pinch-running specialist Herb
Washington off first base to throw cold water
on an Oakland rally.
That alone was enough reason for writers
to want to interview him. But to make it an
even better story, it turned out Washington
took a class from Marshall at Michigan State
last winter. You know, the old "pupil didn't
learn everything" angle.
Washington was willing to talk about it,
even though as the game's goat he had every
reason not to want to. But Marshall, a hero,
refused to go to the interview room.
Didn't Bother
Presumably he was off reading some
Dostoevsky, or some similar uplifting
material, and didn't have time to bother with

the hacks who make their living telling fans
about Mike Marshall.
It was just one more typical example of
Marshall's snobbery. He won't sign
autographs, he says, because his
performance should stand by itself. Try
explaining that to an eight-year old kid. Mike
Marshall won't sign his name for you because
baseball's naturalism and the stark poetry of
competition would be diluted by something
as base as signing an autograph.
Oh sure.
Misguided Snobbery
Marshall, having mastered control of his
body and applying this mastery to baseball,
thinks he has proved that he's smarter than
everyone else associated with the game
players, sportswriters, fans. But he seems to
have forgotten that what he's doing is really
nothing more than entertainment.
Mike Marshall's ability to appear in 100
games a year wouldn't mean a damn thing if
there weren't people willing to pay to see
him do it. And if he thinks their interest is
proof of their stupidity, well, then, pity Mike
Marshall. Because what must he think of
himself a man who has dedicated his life to
performing for morons? We'll probably never
know the depth of his self-contempt.
But rude, snobbish stunts like the one
Sunday give us a pretty good hint.

Misguided Snobbery
Marshall, having mastered control of his
body and applying this mastery to baseball,
thinks he has proved that he's smarter than
everyone else associated with the game
players, sportswriters, fans. But he seems to
have forgotten that what he's doing is really
nothing more than entertainment.
Mike Marshall's ability to appear in 100
games a year wouldn't mean a damn thing if
there weren't people willing to pay to see
him do it. And if he thinks their interest is
proof of their stupidity, well, then, pity Mike
Marshall. Because what must he think of
himself a man who has dedicated his life to
performing for morons? We'll probably never
know the depth of his self-contempt.
But rude, snobbish stunts like the one
Sunday give us a pretty good hint.
Mike Marshall is an ass. If we start with
this basic assumption, then we can explain a
great deal.
Like, for instance, why he refused to
speak to reporters after Sunday's World
Series game. Like why he refuses to sign
autographs for kids. Like why sportswriters
hate him.
A few years ago, when Marshall was just
another crummy pitcher getting bombed
regularly for the Seattle Pilots, he had time
to sign autographs and attend neighborhood
clinics on baseball.
Offbeat Guy
Back then.nobody thought much at all
about Marshall. He was just sort of an offbeat
guy, a baseball player who read books once
in a while. Big deal.
. Something's happened during the last
couple of years, though. The biggest change
is that Marshall is pitching a lot better. The
second thing is that he's discovered a pitching
method whereby he can play almost every
day. He appeared in over 100 games for Los
Angeles this year.
And now, instead of a pitcher, Marshall is
a kinesiologist. Now instead of reading a
book here and there he's a hot shot college
professor after a Ph.D. in physical education.
And now instead of teaching little kids how

to play baseball he refuses to sign pictures for
them.
It's amazing what success will do for a
guy.
Impossible
It's impossible to interview Marshall these
days without getting a lot of intellectualized
crap thrown back in your face. That is, you
get it if Marshall is in a sociable mood.
Normally he just says "no comment!"
For instance, Marshall played a key role in
Sunday's Los Angeles victory. With a narrow
3-2 lead in the ninth inning, he picked
Oakland pinch-running specialist Herb
Washington off first base to throw cold water
on an Oakland rally.
That alone was enough reason for writers
to want to interview him. But to make it an
even better story, it turned out Washington
took a class from Marshall at Michigan State
last winter. You know, the old "pupil didn't
learn everything" angle.
Washington was willing to talk about it,
even though as the game's goat he had every
reason not to want to. But Marshall, a hero,
refused to go to the interview room.
Didn't Bother
Presumably he was off reading some
Dostoevsky, or some similar uplifting
material, and didn't have time to bother with

the hacks who make their living telling fans
about Mike Marshall.
It was just one more typical example of
Marshall's snobbery. He won't sign
autographs, he says, because his
performance should stand by itself. Try
explaining that to an eight-year old kid. Mike
Marshall won't sign his name for you because
baseball's naturalism and the stark poetry of
competition would be diluted by something
as base as signing an autograph.
Oh sure.
