# Tradition To Help Women Swimmers
## 
### JEFF LITTLE 
If tradition can be considered a
valid source of incentive in
athletics, this year's women's
swim team will have more going
for it than the pure talent and
enthusiasm head coach Betsy
Weeks says has already been
displayed by this years' squad
The Cards, champions of the
Northern California
Interscholastic Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) for the past
two years, will be trying to extend
their string to three and establish
a tradition of their own tomorrow
when they open their league
season against Chico State and
San Jose State in a 3 p.m. meet at
the DeGuerre pools.
Weeks is pleased with the
turnout of 26 natators,
explaining. .. this year's squad
has greater depth than last year's,
which will give us more strength
in a all events."
Last year's varsity, according
to Weeks, suffered from a lack of
depth and team cohesiveness.
Despite these problems, the team
went undefeated in conference
action last year and finished a
very respectable 12th in the
92-team AIAW Nationals.
Trying to improve upon last
year's performance is a squad
Weeks characterizes as "... a very
hard working, enthusiastic and
cohesive group of girls, all very
excited about the coming season."
It is also a young team, with the
preponderance of talent residing
in freshman and sophomore
members.
Team Stars
Leading the team is senior Mei
Ong. A member of the 1972
Malaysian Olympic Team, and a
veteran of the AIAW Nationals,
Mei will handle the 50- and
100-yard backstroke events.
Joining Ong is sophomore
Vicki Hays. Vicki holds the
AIAW record in the 50
breaststroke, as well as all
conference, pool and school
marks for the breaststroke. She

notched a silver medal during the
1972 World Aquatics
Championships in Yugoslavia in
the 200.
Along with Ong, another
veteran of international
competition. Hays is regarded as
one of the team leaders, and helps
stabilize some of the younger, less
experienced swimmers.
Other Stars
Also returning are junior Kathy
Heinze, a consistent placer ithe
AIAW 100 butterfly and 100
individual medley events, and
sophomore Nan Leuschel, who
earned her slot in the 50-yard
freestyle at the nationals through
nothing but "pure, hard work"
according to Miss Weeks.
Ann Brodell and Janet Stewart
lead a strong contingent of
freshmen. They will help out in
the distance freestyle events, a
longtime weak spot in the Card
lineup, and Stewart should also
pick up points in the 200
individual medley and butterfly
events. Both qualified for the
AAU Nationals held this
summer in Concord, California.
Liz Lambert is also expected to
do well. Liz will compliment
Vicki Hayes in the breaststroke, as
well as see some action in the 100
and 200 yard individual medley.
Very Pleased
Everyone on the squad is
looking to dethrone the defending
national champs, Arizona State.
Weeks is extremely pleased with
the direction the women's swim
program is taking, citing the
availability of the DeGuerre Swim
Complex to the team, as well as
increased practice hours.
She feels that organizations
such as the Organization of
Stanford Women Athletes are a
good thing, but is not looking for
instant equality with the men's
program.
This year's team promises to be
the most exciting and successful
one in years. It's well worth your
going out to see it.

Vicki Hayes in the breaststroke, as
well as see some action in the 100
and 200 yard individual medley.
Very Pleased
Everyone on the squad is
looking to dethrone the defending
national champs, Arizona State.
Weeks is extremely pleased with
the direction the women's swim
program is taking, citing the
availability of the DeGuerre Swim
Complex to the team, as well as
increased practice hours.
She feels that organizations
such as the Organization of
Stanford Women Athletes are a
good thing, but is not looking for
instant equality with the men's
program.
This year's team promises to be
the most exciting and successful
one in years. It's well worth your
going out to see it.
If tradition can be considered a
valid source of incentive in
athletics, this year's women's
swim team will have more going
for it than the pure talent and
enthusiasm head coach Betsy
Weeks says has already been
displayed by this years' squad
The Cards, champions of the
Northern California
Interscholastic Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) for the past
two years, will be trying to extend
their string to three and establish
a tradition of their own tomorrow
when they open their league
season against Chico State and
San Jose State in a 3 p.m. meet at
the DeGuerre pools.
Weeks is pleased with the
turnout of 26 natators,
explaining. .. this year's squad
has greater depth than last year's,
which will give us more strength
in a all events."
Last year's varsity, according
to Weeks, suffered from a lack of
depth and team cohesiveness.
Despite these problems, the team
went undefeated in conference
action last year and finished a
very respectable 12th in the
92-team AIAW Nationals.
Trying to improve upon last
year's performance is a squad
Weeks characterizes as "... a very
hard working, enthusiastic and
cohesive group of girls, all very
excited about the coming season."
It is also a young team, with the
preponderance of talent residing
in freshman and sophomore
members.
Team Stars
Leading the team is senior Mei
Ong. A member of the 1972
Malaysian Olympic Team, and a
veteran of the AIAW Nationals,
Mei will handle the 50- and
100-yard backstroke events.
Joining Ong is sophomore
Vicki Hays. Vicki holds the
AIAW record in the 50
breaststroke, as well as all
conference, pool and school
marks for the breaststroke. She

notched a silver medal during the
1972 World Aquatics
Championships in Yugoslavia in
the 200.
Along with Ong, another
veteran of international
competition. Hays is regarded as
one of the team leaders, and helps
stabilize some of the younger, less
experienced swimmers.
Other Stars
Also returning are junior Kathy
Heinze, a consistent placer ithe
AIAW 100 butterfly and 100
individual medley events, and
sophomore Nan Leuschel, who
earned her slot in the 50-yard
freestyle at the nationals through
nothing but "pure, hard work"
according to Miss Weeks.
Ann Brodell and Janet Stewart
lead a strong contingent of
freshmen. They will help out in
the distance freestyle events, a
longtime weak spot in the Card
lineup, and Stewart should also
pick up points in the 200
individual medley and butterfly
events. Both qualified for the
AAU Nationals held this
summer in Concord, California.
Liz Lambert is also expected to
do well. Liz will compliment
Vicki Hayes in the breaststroke, as
well as see some action in the 100
and 200 yard individual medley.
