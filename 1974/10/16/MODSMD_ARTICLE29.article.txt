Haig Lobbied For Pardon?
CHICAGO President Ford will testify that he
was asked eight days before Richard M. Nixon left
the White House if he would pardon Nixon in the
event of a resignation, the Chicago Tribune said in
this morning's editions.
Quoting White House sources, the newspaper said
Alexander M. Haig Jr., Nixon's chief of staff, posed
a hypothetical question about the pardon to Ford,
who then was vice president.
If Nixon did resign, Haig asked, would he receive
a full pardon and escape criminal prosecution, the
newspaper said.
President Ford will tell the House judiciary
subcommittee tomorrow, however, that he made no
promises to Haig and refused to make a deal
involving Nixon's resignation, the Tribune said.
News reports last month said Haig had persuaded
Ford to grant the pardon, but the White House has
steadfastly denied any such role.
When Deputy White House Press Secretary John
Hushen was asked whether Haig had urged Ford to
grant the pardon, Hushen said, "No, A1 Haig's role is
described to me ... as basically neutral. He was
certainly in favor of the pardon, but he did not
lobby for it."
Massachusetts Mobilizes Guard
BOSTON â€”Gov. Francis W. Sargent mobilized
the National Guard yesterday and asked President
Ford to send federal troops to help end racial
troubles in Boston.
Ford rejected the plea, saying federal troops
should only be used as a "last resort."
Sargent told newsmen he "regretted" the
President's decision.
He said Ford apparently "sees his responsibility
differently than I do. I don't want the situation to
get beyond our control. And that's why I asked for
limited, specialized personnel... to have the federal
presence in Boston."
In calling for federal aid Sargent had cited
"stabbings, stonings and disorders" in schools
yesterday, the latest in a monthlong series of
disruptions. Most disorders were in the
predominantly white section of Hyde Park.
Rocky Wants Hearings Reopened
WASHINGTON Nelson A. Rockefeller has
called for immediate hearings by the two
congressional committees probing his nomination as
vice president, saying he is being tried in the press
without a chance to present all the facts.
Rockefeller aides said the former New York
governor telephoned Senate Rules Committee
Chairman Howard W. Cannon (D-Nev.) in Las Vegas
and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter W.
Rodino Jr. (D-N.J.) in Washington yesterday.
He urged Cannon to reconvene the Senate
hearings this morning "if possible and certainly
before the end of the week," aides said.
A spokesman for Cannon said no hearings were
planned for today and the senator had made no

plans to meet with the committee.
A spokesman for Rockefeller said earlier that
Cannon agreed to poll his committee on whether a
resumption of hearings would be possible this week.
Meanwhile in Sacramento Sen. Alan Cranston
(D-Calif.) said yesterday he discussed Nelson
Rockfeller's nomination as vice president with Gov.
Ronald Reagan and received an unenthusiastic
response.
Reagan, a Republican, denied an hour later that
he had discussed the Rockefeller nomination with
the Democratic senator.
Cranston told a capitol news conference that
when he asked Reagan about Rockefeller, "He said
something pleasant but it was not an enthusiastic
endorsement."
Cranston said he had been polling California GOP
leaders for their reaction to the Rockefeller
nomination and found that a majority of them
opposed it.
Ford Maps 12 Anti-Inflation Steps
KANSAS CITY, Mo. President Ford outlined a
12-point voluntary program last night for Americans
to become inflation fighters and energy savers and
warned Congress he may propose tougher measures
if it balks at his economic proposals.
In a national radio-television speech at the
Future Farmers of America convention, the
President called on citizens to postpone unnecessary
borrowing, save more, shop for bargains and drive
more slowly.
He declared that "a great citizens' mobilization
has begun" in the wake of his economic proposals
to Congress a week ago but chided law makers and
other critics for their lukewarm response to his
proposals.
Ehrlichman 4 A Victim Of Deceit 9
WASHINGTON John D. Ehrlichman's lawyer
portrayed the one-time White House aide yesterday
as a victim of the deceit of former President Richard
M. Nixon and John W. Dean 111.
"Richard Nixon deceived, misled, lied to and
used John Ehrlichman to cover up his own
knowledge and his own activities," said William
Frates in his opening argument at the Watergate
cover-up trial.
Frates said Nixon was "covering up to save his
own neck."
Frates was the first defense attorney to make an
opening statement in the trial of five former Nixon
administration and campaign aides charged with
conspiring to block the investigation of the break-in
at Democratic national headquarters in, the
Watergate building on June 17,1972.
David G. Bress, attorney for former Asst. Atty.
Gen. Robert C. Mardian, followed Frates and
described his client as "very minimally involved in
the evidence in this case."
House Sustains Turkey Aid Veto
WASHINGTON House and administration

leaders reached a compromise quickly yesterday on
legislation vetoed by President Ford that would ban
U.S. military aid to Turkey.
The agreement came hours after the House
sustained President Ford's veto of a bill to cut off
aid immediately to Turkey.
The compromise delays the cutoff until Dec. 10.
Efforts to end U.S. military aid automatically any
time the Ankara government sends equipment to its
occupation forces on Cyprus was rejected by the
committee.
The House and Senate hope to vote out the
compromise resolution today.
The compromise is contained in an emergency
spending resolution needed by x some * federal
agencies.
Both the original Turkish aid cutoff and
emergency spending resolution died when the House
failed to override Ford's veto. The House vote was
223 to 135, 16 votes short of the two thirds needed
to override.
House Appropriations Committee Chairman
George H. Mahon (D-Tex.) said the committee
rejected the proposed prohibition against Turkey
supplying arms to its Cyprus forces primarily
because Congress has no way to monitor such
supplies.
Kissinger Gains Arab Assurances
RABAT, Morocco Henry Kissinger headed
home yesterday with assurances from several key
Arab leaders that they will back his Middle East
peace strategy and try to stave off another hike in
oil prices.
The latest to give such support was Houari
Boumedienne, the president of Algeria and one of
the most influential and radical Arab leaders, U.S.
officials reported.
Earlier assurances came from Egypt's President
Anwar Sadat and King Faisal of Saudi Arabia.
After a three-hour meeting with Boumedienne on
Monday night, Kissinger reported, "I told him of
some of the positive trends I have found. His advice
was very helpful and his attitude very
understanding."
U.S. officials consider the fiery Algerian
president's support a major development in the
American effort to arrange talks between Israel and
two of its moderate Arab neighbors, Egypt and
Jordan.
Boumedienne's conciliatory attitude on oil
prices, meanwhile, was said to be based on
Kissinger's alarm that the quadrupled increase is
having a devastating effect on third world countries.
