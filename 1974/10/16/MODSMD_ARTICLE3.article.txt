# Police Investigate Killing; Three Witnesses Sought
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Investigators are looking for three
people they think were inside
Memorial Church Saturday night
shortly before 19-year-old Arlis Perry
was murdered and sexually molested
there.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Capt.
Frank Mosunic, chief of detectives,
said police hope at least one of the
three saw the victim in the church, and
might be able to provide information
about others there shortly before it
closed at about 11:45 p.m.
The body of Mrs. Perry, wife of
sophomore premedical student
Bruce Perry, was discovered at about
5:45 a.m. Sunday by a security guard
opening the church for morning
services. The guard became suspicious
when he found an open door on the
west side of the church.
Perry had reported his wife missing
at 3 a.m. and again at 6:55 a.m.
Sunday. Yesterday, Stanford police
officials confirmed that the guard had
checked the church shortly after the 3
a.m. call, and that the door had been
closed and locked at that time.

That might indicate that
someoneâ€”possibly the killer-was
inside the church between 3 a.m. and
5:45 a.m., police said. A coroner's
report earlier this week placed the
time of Mrs. Perry's death ai around
midnight.
Search Continues
Meanwhile, the investigators
continued their search for what they
termed the "sexual psychopath" who
murdered Mrs. Perry.
The police said they still had no
suspects in the case, but spent most of
yesterday checking out information
and leads supplied by people who
think they might have seen or heard

something suspicious at or near the
church.
They said that several people who
were in the church shortly before
closing have already come forward.
The three other persons who were also
in the church have not yet contacted
police, but investigators hope they can
shed more light on the investigation.
Information Needed
Two of the three were described as
while males, one about 5-feet-6 with
blond hair, the other about 5-10 with
brown hair. The third person was
described only as a white female.
The officers asked that these three,
or anyone else with possible
information, contact either Stanford
Lt. Walt Konar at 497-3444 or the
sheriff's detective bureau at 299-2211.
Despite the lack of suspects, Lt.
Konar said he thinks the investigation
"is moving along well." Stanford and
Santa Clara officials met yesterday
morning to review physical evidence in
the case, some of which is being sent
to Washington, D.C., for analysis.
No Burns
The investigators now say they have
pretty much ruled out the
possibility that the killing was
"ritualistic" murder, and flatly denied
reports in the San Jose Mercury that
burns were found on Mrs. Perry's
body.
They also say evidence indicates
that Mrs. Perry was probably killed
quickly. The coroner's report said
she died from a knife wound in the
head, although some evidence of
strangulation was also found.
Memorial services were held for
Mrs. Perry in Memorial Church last
night. She will be buried in Bismarck,
N.D., where both she and her husband
attended school. The couple had been
married less than two months.
