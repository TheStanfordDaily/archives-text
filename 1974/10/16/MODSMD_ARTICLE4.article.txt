# First Issue Of New 'Chaparral9 Leaves Questions Unanswered
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
"I think it's sort of a cruddy issue
myself," said Mike Dornheim, editor
of the "unofficial" Chaparral which
appeared on campus Monday.
"People around here say it was
good, because I live here," he said. "I
didn't think it was especially good.
Some of the articles lacked coherence.
This was mostly due to the fact that it
was put out in a week."
Although the Publications Board
refused to seat Dornheim and his
financial manager, Jim Hu, as
representatives of the Chaparral, they
printed an issue and called it the
Chaparral anyway.

Graduate student Mason Blacher
has also submitted a proposal to the
Publications Board for reviving the
Chaparral, but has refused to take
further action without Pub Board
sanction. Blacher has access to
$lO,OOO in funding if given control of
the publication.
The theme of the new Chaparral's
first issue was "Fiscal Responsibility."
Concern
"I hope the management is more
concerned about the economic state
than the lead editorial indicated," said
Dale Snape, assistant dean of student
affairs. Snape would like to see
Dornheim and Blacher work together

on the Chaparral. Referring to a
meeting at which Dornheim and
Blacher failed to reach an agreement
to cooperate, Snape feels that "we are
sort of at an impasse that will take a
fair amount of energy to figure out."
"The biggest problem," said Snape,
"comes down to the lack of foresight
in the rules of the Pub Board." The
Publications Board ruled earlier that
the Chaparral had "ceased to publish."
Under its bylaws, the Board takes
control of a non-functioning
publication's space in the Storke
Student Publication Building.
This action was taken in an attempt
to freeze publication of the Chaparral
until a new editor could be chosen.
Several members of the Publications
Board are presently attempting to
rewrite and clarify the bylaws on this
point.
Finances
Dornheim and Hu have refused to
reveal details of the publication's
finances. "If the Chaparral is going to
be published without advertising,
either someone is making the ASSU a
big gift, or some publisher is getting
burned," concluded Snape.
"Our friends at the 'new' Chaparral
have a zero funding base," said Frank
Olivieri, ASSU financial manager. "As
far as I'm concerned, I'd be 100
percent against Dornheim getting
funds." Olivieri said Blacher's proposal
is more viable since "there are $lO,OOO
coming from outside sources."
Blacher indicated that there may be

a meeting of the Hammer and Coffin
Society, a group affiliated with the
Chaparral, in the near future. The
meeting would include both members
of the society and the trustees of a
fund earmarked for use by the
Chaparral.
"I hope these people will meet as a
body and resolve once and for all who
is legitimate, and relay this decision to
the Pub Board," said Olivieri.
"Dornheim made a gross, but in the
final analysis, funny, attempt at a
magazine. The $64 question is whether
or not the trustees will buy it."
Publications Board Chairman Rich
Jaroslovsky said the Chaparral
question will be discussed at a meeting
tentatively planned for next week.
Members who have been rewriting the
bylaws will present possible
alternatives to existing laws at that
time.
