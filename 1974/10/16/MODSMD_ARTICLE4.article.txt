"I think it's sort of a cruddy issue
myself," said Mike Dornheim, editor
of the "unofficial" Chaparral which
appeared on campus Monday.
"People around here say it was
good, because I live here," he said. "I
didn't think it was especially good.
Some of the articles lacked coherence.
This was mostly due to the fact that it
was put out in a week."
Although the Publications Board
refused to seat Dornheim and his
financial manager, Jim Hu, as
representatives of the Chaparral, they
printed an issue and called it the
Chaparral anyway.

Graduate student Mason Blacher
has also submitted a proposal to the
Publications Board for reviving the
Chaparral, but has refused to take
further action without Pub Board
sanction. Blacher has access to
$lO,OOO in funding if given control of
the publication.
The theme of the new Chaparral's
first issue was "Fiscal Responsibility."
Concern
"I hope the management is more
concerned about the economic state
than the lead editorial indicated," said
Dale Snape, assistant dean of student
affairs. Snape would like to see
Dornheim and Blacher work together

on the Chaparral. Referring to a
meeting at which Dornheim and
Blacher failed to reach an agreement
to cooperate, Snape feels that "we are
sort of at an impasse that will take a
fair amount of energy to figure out."
"The biggest problem," said Snape,
"comes down to the lack of foresight
in the rules of the Pub Board." The
Publications Board ruled earlier that
the Chaparral had "ceased to publish."
Under its bylaws, the Board takes
control of a non-functioning
publication's space in the Storke
Student Publication Building.
