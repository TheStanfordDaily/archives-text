# Lyman Files Answer To HEW's Title IX
## 
### JOHN FREED 
President Richard Lyman filed a
formal response yesterday to the
controversial Title IX
anti-sex-discrimination rules proposed
by the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare (HEW).
The regulations, designed to
implement Title IX of the federal

Education Amendments of 1972, have
touched off debate over the future of
the fraternity system and over the
administration of athletic and
academic programs here.
In a letter to Caspar Weinberger,
Secretary of HEW, Lyman said that
the proposed action "places the
fraternity system here in jeopardy"
and could lead to "the government's
dictating to institutions the processes
by which they must decide which
programs to offer."
Lyman criticized three specific
parts of the proposed rules:
—regulations which would
effectively destroy Stanford's

independent fraternity system;
—a regulation requiring the
University to take an annual survey of
what sports men and women here
want to compete in, which could
result in federal interference with
internal University decision-making
procedures;
—a prohibition on asking the
marital status of an applicant to the
University during the admissions
process.
Frat 'Discussions'
On the fraternity issue, Lyman
commented yesterday on KZSU's
Campus Conference that
"discussions," rather than
"bargaining," would continue with the
frats.
" 'Bargaining' implies that you have
two [conflicting] interests. We're not
an interest counter to the fraternity
system ... we're [just] trying to solve
the housing shortage," Lyman
remarked.
James Siena, legal adviser to the
president, would not say whether the
University plans to sue the federal
government for the fraternities it the
proposed regulations are approved.
"It depends on what the
government does, ultimately," Siena
commented.
Original Intent
Siena noted that the original
legislation passed by Congress allows
for single-sex living groups, such as
fraternities, but that HEW's proposed
regulations apparently go beyond what
Congress intended.
"We believe that the legislation
does provide for single-sex housing,
and we believe that this should be at
the option of the living groups
involved. The regulations might be
construed to forbid this," Siena
explained.

"[The proposal] forbids University
assistance—'assistance' undefined—to
groups which discriminate on the basis
of sex. I think the regulations, as
currently drafted, would forbid the
continuation of the fraternity system.
We don't believe the legislation
[passed by Congress] goes that far,"
Siena elaborated.
