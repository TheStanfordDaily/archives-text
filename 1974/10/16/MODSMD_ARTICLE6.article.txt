# Law Professor Examines Ethics
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
"Watergate has brought a storm of criticism on
the professional lawyer," but "we have a long way
to go before we achieve even a minimal enforcement
of the ideals of the profession," Law Prof. Barbara
Babcock said last night.
Speaking to fewer than 200 people in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, Babcock said saw schools should place
work on the conflict between a lawyer's
professional role and his moral obligations in
criminal and civic cases.
Babcock, who directed the Public Defender's
Service for the District of Columbia for 10 years,
cited several examples to show that professional
ethics differ greatly from personal ethics.
Witness
In one case involving a liquor store robbery, a
defense attorney knew the location of a valuable
witness for the prosecution's case, but the
prosecution lawyers did not.
A conflict of interests arose between the defense
attorney's duty to the court and his "paramount
duty" to his client, Babcock explained.
Babcock, who has handled defenses in over 200
criminal cases, said the Lawyer's Code of
Professional Responsibility calls for the lawyer to
represent his client "zealously, but at the same time
not to conceal what he is required by law to reveal."
In another example, Babcock told of a
psychopathic murderer who revealed to his lawyers
where two additional victims were buried.
'Wrong'
On the one hand, the lawyers should have
reported the other crimes because "concealment of
the other murders seems wrong," Babcock said.
However, if the lawyers revealed the client's
secrets, they would be destroying the "trust and
confidence" relationship, Babcock noted.
"Lawyers deal every day with problems like

these ... alone, without the guidance of society or
the system," she said.
During her one-hour speech, Babcock, a Yale
Law School graduate, cited a three-year study
conducted by a committee of the American Bar
Association under the direction of former Chief
Justice Tom Clark, in which lawyer's discipline
procedures were termed "scandalous."
Not Prosecuted
Lawyers across the country are often not
prosecuted for federal income tax evasion "unless
they happen to be a former vice president," she
said.
The study also showed that lawyers often fail to
cooperate or appear in cases against other lawyers,
and that state disciplinary agencies often do not
have the money, staff or management to take
required action.
The same study pointed to other problems,
Babcock said, including lawyers who are disbarred
and take their practice to another part of the
country, and lawyers who are convicted of serious
crime but not disciplined until after an appeal is
made.
'Awesome'
"It is an awesome thing ... the total machinery
of the society is organized against the
individual.. . and the very accusation of crime is
damning," Babcock said.
"We have given the individual one person, the
defense lawyer, whose total commitment is to the
accused," she added.
It is the duty of the system to provide legal
service to the defendant whether he can afford it or
not, she said. A lawyer must be a "wise counselor"
and "a learned friend," Babcock noted.
She said a defense lawyer must engage in "hand
holding and counseling" besides legal defense, and
at the same time remain "selfless."

Babcock teaches civil procedure and a course in
sex discrimination, "Woman and the Law." She is
co-author of a book: Sex Discrimination: Causes
and Remedies.

Babcock's speech was the first in the University's
Tuesday Evening Lecture Series. Upcoming speakers
in the series will be Political Science Prof. Robert
Ward, who will speak on U.S. relations with Japan,
and Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi who will discuss
birth control for humans and insects.
