Hits Sensationalism
Editor:
I strongly object to the
sensationalism of Monday's lead
story by Christine Douglas about
the murder in Memorial Church.
I cannot imagine the purpose
served by the description of the
victim as she was seen by Dean
Robert G.H. Kelly. In fact, I
believe such a description is a
disservice to its readers. It could
only aggravate the grief of the
friends and relatives of Arlis
Perry, and the rest of the Stanford
community, already thoroughly
shocked by the crime itself.
Although a newspaper enjoys
the right to disseminate
information freely, it should not
ignore its concommitant
responsibility to use intelligent
discretion.

Student 'Police': Clowns?
Editor:
At the recent Michigan game I
had the pleasure of being rousted
from a "saved" seat on the
50-yard line by a bunch of infants
calling themselves the Student
Police, and attempting to zone off
50 to 60 seats for themselves,
their keg and their friends.
Whom are these clowns trying
to fool?
What do they do to deserve
such privileges? And how much
ASSU money goes into
subsidizing this bullshit?
If "reserved" student section
seats are indeed a "fringe benefit"
of this activity, I would think
50-yard line, halfway up, is a bit
extravagant, if not piggish. Those
of us who come early and wait for
the gates to open in order to get
good seats resent this boorish
abuse of a rather dubious
"privilege."
When rousted I was told I
"didn't know who I was fucking
with." Please enlighten me.

Dorm Life Not So Bad

Editor:
Tim Ferguson's article in the
Oct. 10 Daily ("A Bold Housing
Step") proposing an alternative to
the present housing system
contains statements that require
rebuttal.
The merits of his proposal,
vague as it is in this presentation,
are not at issue here. The
argument which Ferguson would
appear to be using in support of
his position, however, is rather
obtuse and deserves to be
answered.
Ferguson proposes a solution
to a problem that he terms
"Wilbur-Stern alientation."
Students assigned to these
dormitories, he says, are tragically
"condemned" to "life in an
impersonal boarding house"
where "residents are not
neighbors, but simply competitors
in the classroom." It follows that
"the classroom may be the only
place in which dorm residents feel
part of Stanford." These
statements are simply untrue;
they display some degree of
insensitivity and lack of insight.
Ferguson has implied that a
student assigned to Wilbur or
Stern is doomed to social failure,
that an atmosphere exists in these
dormitories which causes people
to become permanent strangers.
He does the dormitories, and
more importantly, their residents,
a disservice by supposing they are
"impersonal boarding houses"
holding neighbors who can't relate
to each other. To the contrary,
they can be every bit as enjoyable,
stimulating, and "fulfilling" as
any other living situation, even
those at a fraternity or
"prestigious institutions such as
Harvard." What matters is not the
living quarters but the people.
What a fulfilling residential
program requires is students who
have some feeling besides apathy.
Apathy is not unique to Wilbur or

Sterm; to imply, as Ferguson
does, that the housing draw is
responsible for student apathy is
to be far off the mark.
It is true that the physical
living conditions in Wilbur and
Stem are something less than
desirable, but it is hard to see that
Ferguson's proposal could remedy
this situation. It is also true that
one may not desire to spend four
years in Wilbur or Stem, but then
it is perhaps undesirable to spend
all of your undergraduate years in
any one living situation.
Lest it be thought that I have
been brainwashed by an
Approaching Stanford, I should
say that I lived in Burbank of
Stem Hall for three years. I
enjoyed those years, and I made
many friends whom I would not
have met elsewhere.
Ferguson, as I understand it,
was a resident of Branner, and
from there he moved to a
fraternity. It would seem difficult
for him to have formed any
accurate conception of the living
situation in Wilbur or Stem; that
he did not has been borne out by
his article.

Set The Example
Editor:
President Richard Lyman, in
his speech to the American
Council on Education,
reprimanded other universities for
"studious avoidance of any
reference to shortcomings" in
recruitment literature. Such
statements can only .be seen as
rhetoric and hypocrisy when one
assesses the present policies of
Stanford's admissions office.
The on-campus housing shortage is
one of Stanford's major
"shortcomings." I find it
inconceivable that the Stanford
administration has inadvertently,
overlooked this major problem
when printing recruitment
literature. Could it possibly be
"studious avoidance" at work?
I suggest that Lyman impose
his lofty ideals of total and candid
communication on his own Dean
Fred Hargadon. Prospective
freshmen must be fully informed
of the housing shortage (which
one day might confront them),
annual increases in tuition,
cutbacks in the food service, etc.
Until such a policy is established,
Lyman should stop throwing
stones from glass offices.

On Title IX
Editor:
Meg Halloran's article on Title
IX and athletic opportunity raises
a few interesting questions. Does
the Stanford Crew receive federal
financial assistance? If so, why? It
would seem a good place to start
trimming the federal budget if it
does receive federal aid.
If not, how does Title IX apply
to the principal of equal
opportunity for both sexes,
toward which the Athletic
Department would seem to be
moving? Hopefully, the strength
of the Organization of Stanford
Athletes is in its membership
rather than in irrelevant statutes.

To Gain Tenure .. .
Editor:
Why not abolish undergraduate
teaching if doing it well is
preventing junior faculty from
getting tenure?
We could let future freshman
applicants have a bargain price on
a diploma, a transcript with a
3.55 average and a four-year
subscription to the class
note-taking service.
Then the professors could
concentrate a lot more of their
time on advancing their research
and achieving job security. After
all, first things first.
