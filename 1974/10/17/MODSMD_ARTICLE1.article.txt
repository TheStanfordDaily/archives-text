# Prosecutors Claim Nixon Can Testify
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Watergate
prosecutors said yesterday that "clear
and convincing evidence" is lacking
that former President Richard M.
Nixon is too sick to testify at the
Watergate cover-up trial.
They urged U.S. District Court
? Judge John J. Sirica to send three
doctors to examine Nixon.
But, while asking that Sirica turn
down Nixon's request to be excused,
the prosecutors said they will not
insist on the former president's
appearance as a prosecution witness.
* Nixon has been subpoenaed by
both the government and John D.
Ehrlichman, one of the five defendants
charged with conspiring to obstruct
justice in the Watergate case.
Ehrlichman's lawyers said that if
Nixon cannot testify want him
*to give a deposition that can be
introduced as evidence in the trial.
Hear Arguments
Sirica indicated he is thinking of
appointing a panel of doctors to
examine Nixon and said he would hear
arguments today on Nixon's efforts to
* have the subpoenas quashed.
The government's memorandum
was filed as the government's first
witness, John W. Dean 111,
testifying. x
Dean discussed the first weeks after
the June 17, 1972, break-in at
i Democratic headquarters at the
Watergate complex when, according to
his testimony, the first efforts were
made to help the Watergate burglars
financially.
Play Tapes
With Dean there to authenticate
4 them, prosecutors plan today to play
' the first of the White House tapes for
the jury of nine women and three
men.
Dean detailed his own efforts at
trying to stop an FBI investigation
into the source of funds found on the
Watergate burglars and of trying
* unsuccessfully to get funds for the
defendants, then in jail, from the CIA.
The efforts were made at the behest
of Nixon's two top aides
Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman
Dean said.
In the early hours of his testimony
that may take a week or longer to
complete, Dean involved all but
former Nixon campaign attorney
Kenneth W. Parkinson in the early
discussions that concerned how
Watergate and the defendants should
be handled.
One of the reasons the government
subpoenaed the former president was
to authenticate some 26 tape
recordings where the conversation
involves Nixon and either Haldeman,
Ehrlichman or both.
The prosecutors said, "Mr. Nixon is
not a neutral or detached witness. He
has been formally accused of
participating in the conspiracy for
which defendants are standing trial,
and it would be only natural for him
to seek to avoid an obligation to
testify."
