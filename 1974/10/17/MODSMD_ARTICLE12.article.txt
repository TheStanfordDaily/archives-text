# The 						Courses At White House U.
## 
### Bruce Kadden 
Ever since that fateful June, 1972, day
when five men were arrested for breaking
into the headquarters of the Democratic
National Committee, facts have been slowly
unraveling that tell of the corruption in the
Oval Office.
Two questions that may never be
answered are how so many people became
involved in such a sinister scheme, and how
they were trained to carry out various aspects
of the burglary and coverup.
One of my friends once jokingly
mentioned the possibility of college training
for high government officials. At the time I
laughed it off, but the more I think about it,
the more I begin to imagine what type of
courses might be offered.
So to share with the readers this class-ified
information, I now present a condensed
version of Courses and Degrees for White
House U.

Ever since that fateful June, 1972, day
when five men were arrested for breaking
into the headquarters of the Democratic
National Committee, facts have been slowly
unraveling that tell of the corruption in the

answered are how so many people became
involved in such a sinister scheme, and how
they were trained to carry out various aspects
of the burglary and coverup.
One of my friends once jokingly
mentioned the possibility of college training
for high government officials. At the time I
laughed it off, but the more I think about it,
the more I begin to imagine what type of
courses might be offered.
