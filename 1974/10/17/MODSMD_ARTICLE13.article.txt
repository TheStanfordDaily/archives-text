# Prop. 14 Bad For Public Colleges
## 
### Robert Bacon 
SACRAMENTO - The
November general election ballot
will provide several opportunities
for friends of higher education to
help the public colleges and
universities of California.
One of them is to vote NO on
Prop. 14.
Prop. 14 would make the
President pro tempore of the
State Senate an ex-officio Trustee
of the State University and
College system. It would be a step
in the wrong direction.
Higher education has suffered
greatly in recent years from the
application of excessive political
pressure. Specifically, the
presence of large numbers of
elected officials on the governing
boards of colleges and universities
has made the campuses
political footballs. When that
happens, the students, faculty,
and staff are the losers.
The Trustees, who administer
the 19-campus State University
and College system (San Jose
State, San Francisco State, etc.),
now consist of 16 private citizens
nominated by the Governor and
confirmed by the State Senate
and five ex-officio members.
Current Trustee Set-Up
The Governor, the Lieutenant
Governor, the Speaker of the
Assembly, the State
Superintendent of Public
Instruction and the system's
Chancellor currently serve
ex-officio. Prop. 14 would amend
the State Constitution to add the
President pro tern as a sixth
ex-officio Trustee.

What makes it especially
bizarre is that the State
Constitution nowhere specifies
the full membership of the
Trustees. The only mention is a
provision similar to Prop. 14,

enacted four years ago, requiring
that the Speaker be among the
Trustees.
That provision and Prop. 14
are attempts to put increased
politicization of the colleges into
the Constitution, where it cannot
be repealed except by popular
vote.
The voters acquiesced in 1970
to the addition of the Speaker.
They should not make a similar
mistake this year.
One Of 40
The President pro tern is oqe of
40 Senators, chosen to his post by
majority vote of his colleagues.
Recent contests for the position
have been characterized by
blatapt political horsetrading and
logrolling.
Needless to say, expertise in
higher education matters is not a
key factor in the Senators'
decision.
Whether one agrees or disagrees

with the politics of the incumbent
President pro tern, Sen. James
Mills (D-San Diego), is irrelevant,
because Prop. 14 will be locked
into the State Constitution and
will remain long after Mills has
left the political scene.
The last decade has seen
numerous elected officials in this
and other states vent their
frustrations on colleges and
universities, putting political
expediency ahead of the best
interests of the faculty and
students.
Chosen For Post
One may not always agree with
the decisions of the lay Trustees
chosen by the Governor and
confirmed by the State Senate,
but the fact remains that they
were chosen specifically for the
higher education post.
Once chosen, they do not have
to v constantly please the State

Senate or any constituents back
home in one of 40 Senate
districts. They are free to make
decisions according to what they
think is best for the institutions
under their direction.
The State University and
Colleges, along with the rest of
public higher education, have
been drawn into the political
sphere largely by the presence of
politicians on their governing
boards.
Prop. 14 would further inject
politics into education by placing
another politician on the Trustees.
The public interest is'better served
by having a layer of interested lay
Trustees between the people's
representatives and the people's
colleges and universities.
Vote NO on Prop. 14 on
November 5.
