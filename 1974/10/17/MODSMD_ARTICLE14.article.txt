# Coverage 'Too Explicit'
## 
### McPheeters, Bagshaw 
This is in reference to the
Daily's recent coverage of the
murder in Memorial Church. We
firmly believe that your reporting
has been unnecessarily detailed
and explicit with regard to the
circumstances surrounding Mrs.
Perry's attack.
It is true that other Bay Area
papers have printed equally
descriptive accounts. However, a
clear distinction exists between
the Stanford Daily and these
other papers in that your paper is
not sold on newsstands and does

not depend upon grim and gory
shock value to increase or
maintain its circulation.
The knowledge that there is a
murderer on the loose who has
killed at Stanford should suffice
in keeping other people alert to
the danger that exists.
Compounding this knowledge
with an explanation of the
frightful acts committed by the
murderer serve little function
other than satisfying the morbid,
prying curiosities of pathetic
minds.

We have arrived at our opinion
by wondering how each of us
would feel if Mrs. Perry had been
our sister, wife or friend. The
gruesome details of her attack are
a personal and painful burden for
her loved ones to bear and are
simply not a public concern. We
feel that the Stanford Daily, as a
part of Mrs. Perry's community,
should have been sensitive to this
issue.
