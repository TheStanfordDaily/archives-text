### Merritt Ruhlen 
So Leon Jaworski has stepped
down as "special prosecutor,"
mission accomplished. That
mission was, of course, the
destruction of the American
judicial system as it had
previously been conceived.

Jaworski assumed his role after
then-President Nixon fired the
first Special Prosecutor, Archibald
Cox, who, much to Nixon's
chagrin, actually intended to
prosecute those who had broken
the law, including the President
himself. Nixon obviously took
great care in his second
appointment (as he would later in
appointing Jerry Ford), making
sure that the new Prosecutor
would be a "team player," one of
the boys.
A few Senators pointed out the
absurdity of allowing the
"investigatee" to appoint the
"investigator." Sen. Mike
Mansfield even threatened a
special Congressional Prosecutor,
should Nixon appointee prove
unsatisfactory, but that turned
out to be merely the empty
rhetoric of a Congress already
suffering from terminal
impotency.

Let's review what Jaworski
accomplished in less than a year in
office. His first task was to
prevent the indictment of
President Nixon. When the
Watergate Grand Jury wanted to
indict Nixon, Jaworski refused to
allow it. While lawyers differed on
the question of whether a sitting
President could be indicted before
impeachment, here as elsewhere
Jaworski decided that he alone
would determine what the law
was, preferring not to rely on a
possibly unfavorable court ruling.
Kleindienst Not Convicted
Jaworski's second job was to
prevent the conviction of former
Attorney General Richard
Kleindienst for perjury. There was
no question Kleindienst had
committed perjury before a
Senate Committee. Any trial on
that charge would surely have
resulted in a conviction,
disbarment, and a jail sentence.
Jaworski's solution to this
problem was to allow Kleindienst
to plead guilty to a misdemeanor
rather than perjury, which is a
felony. The sentencing judge gave
Kleindienst a one-month
suspended sentence and praised
him as an "honorable',' man.
With Nixon's resignation on
Aug. 8, following on the heels of
his confession that he had been
involved in the cover-up from the
start, any impediment to a Nixon
indictment was removed. Did
Jaworski then move to indict, as
the Grand Jury had urged months
before? Of course not. He
"stonewalled" it for an entire
month until the other pawn in
Nixon's brilliant end-game, Jerry
Ford, issued a full pardon for all
crimes (unspecified) committed
by Nixon while in office.
At this point Jaworski could
have tested the legality of the
Ford pardon in court, as New
York University Law Professor
Leroy Clark urged him to do. But
as had been his custom Jaworski
decided that he alone would
determine what the law was; with
the cover-up so close to
completion, it would have been
foolhardy to risk an unfavorable
court ruling.
'Minor' Characters
With such egregious examples
as these, one tends to forget the
fate of the minor Watergate
characters: (1) L. Patrick Gray,
former FBI chief, who confessed
to the destruction of evidence.
Not even indicted; (2) Matthew
Byrne, judge in the Ellsberg trial,
who failed to report Ehrlichman's
attempted bribe. Not even
indicted; (3) the giant
corporations who funded the
1972 Nixon campaign with illegal
contributions. They were allowed
to "give themselves up" and pay a
paltry fine of $lO,OOO.
In less than a year the
Nixon-Jaworski-Ford cabal has
succeeded in establishing, not
only in practice, but on paper, a
dual system of justice. If you are
poor, and steal food because you
are hungry, you will still go to jail.
But if you are the President (or
Vice President, or Attorney
General, etc.) you may commit
any crime you please. It is most
unlikely you will be caught unless
you are so arrogant as to
tape-record your crimes.
But even if you are caught, you
will suffer nothing harsher than
forced retirement to a mansion
(purchased with the spoils of your
crimes) and a million dollar pension
provided, that is, that you have
been careful in choosing a "team
player" as your Vice President.

President could be indicted before
impeachment, here as elsewhere
Jaworski decided that he alone
would determine what the law
was, preferring not to rely on a
possibly unfavorable court ruling.
Kleindienst Not Convicted
Jaworski's second job was to
prevent the conviction of former
Attorney General Richard
Kleindienst for perjury. There was
no question Kleindienst had
committed perjury before a
Senate Committee. Any trial on
that charge would surely have
resulted in a conviction,
disbarment, and a jail sentence.
Jaworski's solution to this
problem was to allow Kleindienst
to plead guilty to a misdemeanor
rather than perjury, which is a
felony. The sentencing judge gave
Kleindienst a one-month
suspended sentence and praised
him as an "honorable',' man.
With Nixon's resignation on
Aug. 8, following on the heels of
his confession that he had been
involved in the cover-up from the
start, any impediment to a Nixon
indictment was removed. Did
Jaworski then move to indict, as
the Grand Jury had urged months
before? Of course not. He
"stonewalled" it for an entire
month until the other pawn in
Nixon's brilliant end-game, Jerry
Ford, issued a full pardon for all
crimes (unspecified) committed
by Nixon while in office.
At this point Jaworski could
have tested the legality of the
Ford pardon in court, as New
York University Law Professor
Leroy Clark urged him to do. But
as had been his custom Jaworski
decided that he alone would
determine what the law was; with
the cover-up so close to
completion, it would have been
foolhardy to risk an unfavorable
court ruling.
'Minor' Characters
With such egregious examples
as these, one tends to forget the
fate of the minor Watergate
characters: (1) L. Patrick Gray,
former FBI chief, who confessed
to the destruction of evidence.
Not even indicted; (2) Matthew
Byrne, judge in the Ellsberg trial,
who failed to report Ehrlichman's
attempted bribe. Not even
indicted; (3) the giant
corporations who funded the
1972 Nixon campaign with illegal
contributions. They were allowed
to "give themselves up" and pay a
paltry fine of $lO,OOO.
In less than a year the
Nixon-Jaworski-Ford cabal has
succeeded in establishing, not
only in practice, but on paper, a
dual system of justice. If you are
poor, and steal food because you
are hungry, you will still go to jail.
But if you are the President (or
Vice President, or Attorney
General, etc.) you may commit
any crime you please. It is most
unlikely you will be caught unless
you are so arrogant as to
tape-record your crimes.
But even if you are caught, you
will suffer nothing harsher than
forced retirement to a mansion
(purchased with the spoils of your
crimes) and a million dollar pension
provided, that is, that you have
been careful in choosing a "team
player" as your Vice President.
(Merritt Ruhlen is a research
associate in the linguistics
department.)
So Leon Jaworski has stepped
down as "special prosecutor,"
mission accomplished. That
mission was, of course, the
destruction of the American
judicial system as it had
previously been conceived.

Jaworski assumed his role after
then-President Nixon fired the
first Special Prosecutor, Archibald
Cox, who, much to Nixon's
chagrin, actually intended to
prosecute those who had broken
the law, including the President
himself. Nixon obviously took
great care in his second
appointment (as he would later in
appointing Jerry Ford), making
sure that the new Prosecutor
would be a "team player," one of
the boys.
A few Senators pointed out the
absurdity of allowing the
"investigatee" to appoint the
"investigator." Sen. Mike
Mansfield even threatened a
special Congressional Prosecutor,
should Nixon appointee prove
unsatisfactory, but that turned
out to be merely the empty
rhetoric of a Congress already
suffering from terminal
impotency.

Let's review what Jaworski
accomplished in less than a year in
office. His first task was to
prevent the indictment of

Ford, issued a full pardon for all
crimes (unspecified) committed
by Nixon while in office.
At this point Jaworski could
have tested the legality of the
Ford pardon in court, as New
York University Law Professor
Leroy Clark urged him to do. But
as had been his custom Jaworski
decided that he alone would
determine what the law was; with
the cover-up so close to
completion, it would have been
foolhardy to risk an unfavorable
court ruling.
'Minor' Characters
With such egregious examples
as these, one tends to forget the
fate of the minor Watergate
characters: (1) L. Patrick Gray,
former FBI chief, who confessed
to the destruction of evidence.
Not even indicted; (2) Matthew
Byrne, judge in the Ellsberg trial,
who failed to report Ehrlichman's
attempted bribe. Not even
indicted; (3) the giant
corporations who funded the
1972 Nixon campaign with illegal
contributions. They were allowed
to "give themselves up" and pay a
paltry fine of $lO,OOO.
In less than a year the
Nixon-Jaworski-Ford cabal has
succeeded in establishing, not
only in practice, but on paper, a
dual system of justice. If you are
poor, and steal food because you
are hungry, you will still go to jail.
But if you are the President (or
Vice President, or Attorney
General, etc.) you may commit
any crime you please. It is most
unlikely you will be caught unless
you are so arrogant as to
tape-record your crimes.
But even if you are caught, you
will suffer nothing harsher than
forced retirement to a mansion
(purchased with the spoils of your
crimes) and a million dollar pension
provided, that is, that you have
been careful in choosing a "team
player" as your Vice President.
