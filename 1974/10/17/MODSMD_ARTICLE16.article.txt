## Oktoberfest Draws Drunken Revelers 
### 
(Editor's Note: The following description of the 1974
Oktoberfest reached the Daily from the typewriter of
Rock Hutton, a communications undergraduate currently
hanging out in the pubs around Stanford-In-Britain. He
warns that "This text may still be incoherent with the
spirits of the Oktoberfest," and on that we have to agree
with him.)
By ROCK HUTTON
MUNICH The American with middle class budget
usually enters Munich by leaving its train station barn.
From there, no need for direction each year between
approximately Sept. 21 and Oct. 6.
Just trail the hoardes of culture-lovers to the right and
down a few blocks, careful to elude the Audis and avoid
the barf splotches on the sidewalks young hedonist,
you're bound for the Oktoberfest. The beer drinker's
festival.
Knee-length gray socks, knickers and sweaters, felt
caps, full dresses with lacey white blouses Bavarian
costumes whip in and out of the animated gossip on
Munich's street corners.
Bavarians Outnumbered
The whole world rejoices in the Oktoberfest. It's the
biggest collection of kids this side of Disney World and the
poor Bavarians are outnumbered many times by an alien
collage of tens of thousands. Perhaps beer is the liaison
between cultures.
Hie Muenchners are ready for us, however they
usally speak another language and half of them have
ccditioned their tongues and ears to the American
diect.
The party breaks out every day around noon and
ftks off every evening at 10:30 or so early, but still
pty of time for beer and revelry afficionados to blow
ir minds. You'll stumble onto a bawdy, rather
ap-looking amusement park., Look for the garlanded
h over the entrance: Willkommen zum Oktoberfest, it
s.
Never mind the amusement rides who wants to do
/thing but walk with a bellyfull of beer? Drink some. At
„*ee and a half Deutsche marks ($l.lO American style) a
»in from the Hofbrau House or the Pauliner Thomasbrau
>lds a liter and rates as one of the cheapest rip-offs in
unich. If you're hungry, the roast chicken and pretzels
) an admirable job of coating your stomach before you
ink.
Passport, Trayekrs Cheques
So lose yourself in the crowd (the forces of altruism
ill help you remember where your youth hostel is later),
sep a hand on your passport and travelers cheques, and
snounce your prudish heritage.
The 20 breweries at the Oktoberfest dispense their best
iside gigantic barns that compare with the train station

behemoth. Picnic tables on the landing out front serve
elder Munich sophisticates nursing their beer, smiling but
no doubt wearied by years of youth-festing.
Inside the building you peer through wide-open entries
framed by vendors, and its like looking through a gate out
into a baseball stadium from the concession stand during
the World Series a blaze of hazy light, amorphous
humanity milling wildly and a euphoric din.
It swallows you blinking, without your wits. There are
tables covered by hilarious people as far as the eye can see
on a concrete floor under an astrodome ceiling. Perched
on a stand in the middle, a rowdy band with shining horns
belts out a medley of tunes, mixing its own Bavarian folk
songs with"V7ue Espana " and "Home on the Range."
Cooperative Frauleins
Finding a seat is a task, but sit anywhere and flag down
the nearest Fraulein. She will not necessarily be beautiful
but she'll be big and cooperative. Stout women with
biceps swollen from years of stein-carrying (as many as six
at a time), any fraulein looks an odds-on favorite against
Stillwell in the trenches.
Big, rambunctious people they are, those Bavarians.
They leap animately into flesh out of Breugel's paintings.
They're boisterous: they laugh and sing as the band
resumes playing, they swing their dancing butts in the aisles
and on tabletops. Nothing like this could happen in the
uptight states.
Talk. Any 'fester will talk to you if you don't make the
effort. Still, it's remarkable what a couple of liters can do
to loosen your own tongue and bridge the language chasm.
Even with your pidgin German, better be discreetly
prepared to explain to that sweet Hamburg family that
you can't spend a week with them (they're often offended
if you can't) but you will drop them a postcard.
Aussies, New Zealanders
Some of your most memorable exchanges will come
with the Britishers, Aussies and, New Zealanders flooding
the Hofbrau House. Nice chicks accompany them and they
share your language but not your lifestyle. You're bloody
decent people, they'll tell you, and it's only your
middle-aged cigar-chomping businessmen on the plunder
abroad that give you a bad name.
Don't neglect the Germans though, especially the
families with small children. It does a hell of a lot for your
diplomatic self-image and you'll be treated to the sight of
indefatigable first graders chugging a full stein Jesus!
They must have been weaned on the stuff.
It all takes a patient, receptive eye on your part. Try to
understand. The women walking hand-in-hand and those
grown men strolling arm-in-arm aren't "lesbos" and
"faggots"; they just have a few less inhibitions than does
the Brooklyn cab driver in the company of friends.
And girls, you're going to be pinched, ogled, and

solicited not only by the French and Italian casonovas
but by fiftyish German patriarchs making the scene with
their wives. Grit your teeth and take it in stride.
No Stereotypes
The Oktoberfest is a wonderful place to get drunk.
Better yet, it's a wonderful place to experience people.
Stereotypes are scrapped the German males aren't all
blond, blue-eyed Adonises nor are they brooding ogres
with the bad taste of the second war lingering in their
mouths. Nor are we all seething American imperialists.
Call it a transnational camaraderie. People are genuinely
interested in others and it doesn't matter where in the hell
you're from. The farther away, the better.
An Australian named Bryan almost sobered me my last
night at the Oktoberfest.
"Rocky," he shouted in my ear above the merriment,
"What's the matter with you, trying to write about this?
Isn't it plain that you can never recapture something like
this in words without spoiling it?"
Then, sympathizing with my journalistic intent, "Ah,
but I guess your ambitions can only be called noble."
"Yes," I belched. "You're absolutely right... if I think
I know what you said."
