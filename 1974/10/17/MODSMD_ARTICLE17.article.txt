Does the University check out people who solicit donations to
charitable organizations outside the Post Office? Do they have to
display a permit or a license so the prospective donor will know if the
solicitations are certified? —T.O.
"Yes and no and no," Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale Snape
replied when Bug confronted him at first.
Snape went on to say that occasionally the University will ask
solicitors to register with Police Services and the police will check
their credentials. However, he emphasized this is by no means a
mandatory procedure.
"White Plaza we consider public," Snape added, remarking that
everyone has a right to solicit contributions there.
Tlie University will not protect those who don't want to "get
ripped off," Snape remarked. "People just have to get used to their
[the solicitors'] aggressive nature."
However, "if people object to someone manhandling them," Snape
said the University would step in.
Snape mentioned that the police have never found anyone who
wasn't listed with the organization they purported to represent.
Snape stated that soliciting in dorms "is completely forbidden."

How are student I.D. numbers assigned? They don't seem to be
alphabetical. —R.B.G.
If you're worried Stanford ordered the I.D. numbers according to
I.Q. or weight or even order in which 1 the Admissions Office accepted
you, have no fear.
"There is no significance to the order of the numbers," Assist.
Registrar Edna Nigh declared in regards to Autumn quarter freshmen's
numbers.
The Registrar's Offipe allots a block of numbers to the freshmen,
Nigh said. The freshmen who accepted Stanford are taken off the
applicant list and put on a new list under no specific pattern, Nigh
added.
A computer then assigns the freshmen a number out of the block.
Other admissions offices give lists of new students to the
Registrar's Office according to the order they agreed to come to
Stanford, Assist. Machine Liaison Beth Solomon said. Their numbers
are assigned by hand.
Nigh said that the first three digits of the I.D. number represent the
quarter and year a student matriculates. So if your I.D. card number is
172 you started Stanford autumn quarter, 1972.
The second and third numbers can't be less than 71 because the
whole procedure started spring quarter, 1972.

Nigh said. The freshmen who accepted Stanford are taken off the
applicant list and put on a new list under no specific pattern, Nigh
added.
A computer then assigns the freshmen a number out of the block.
Other admissions offices give lists of new students to the
Registrar's Office according to the order they agreed to come to
Stanford, Assist. Machine Liaison Beth Solomon said. Their numbers
are assigned by hand.
Nigh said that the first three digits of the I.D. number represent the
quarter and year a student matriculates. So if your I.D. card number is
172 you started Stanford autumn quarter, 1972.
The second and third numbers can't be less than 71 because the
whole procedure started spring quarter, 1972.

Does the University check out people who solicit donations to
charitable organizations outside the Post Office? Do they have to
display a permit or a license so the prospective donor will know if the
solicitations are certified? —T.O.
"Yes and no and no," Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale Snape
replied when Bug confronted him at first.
Snape went on to say that occasionally the University will ask
solicitors to register with Police Services and the police will check
their credentials. However, he emphasized this is by no means a
mandatory procedure.
"White Plaza we consider public," Snape added, remarking that
everyone has a right to solicit contributions there.
Tlie University will not protect those who don't want to "get
ripped off," Snape remarked. "People just have to get used to their
[the solicitors'] aggressive nature."
However, "if people object to someone manhandling them," Snape
said the University would step in.
Snape mentioned that the police have never found anyone who
wasn't listed with the organization they purported to represent.
Snape stated that soliciting in dorms "is completely forbidden."

How are student I.D. numbers assigned? They don't seem to be
alphabetical. —R.B.G.
If you're worried Stanford ordered the I.D. numbers according to
I.Q. or weight or even order in which 1 the Admissions Office accepted
you, have no fear.
