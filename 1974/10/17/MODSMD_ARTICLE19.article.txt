# British Blamed For Violence In Ireland
## 
### JAN PEPPER 
"The underlying reason for
violence in Ireland is the presence
of the British," according to
Anthony Heffernan, joint general
secretary of Sinn Fein, the
political party of the Official Irish
Republican Army.
Addressing about 50 people
Tuesday afternoon at the
International Center, Heffernan
sought to "counteract" the
reports received here about the
Irish developments reports he
charged are usually written from
the British perspective.
He blamed the British for
provoking much of the violence
through the use of the Special Air
Services (SAS), the Emergency
Provisions Act and the mere
presence of British troops in
Northern Ireland.
"The British are guilty of
horrifying atrocities against the
Irish," he said. The British SAS,
which is used to "engage in
murder and terror," kills Catholics
and blames the Protestants for it
and vice versa. "Religion is used
to keep the Irish people divided"
through the British tactic of
"divide and conquer," he
continued.
Through the use of "American
made rubber bullets, a favorite of
the British army," he claimed that
many people, including children,
have been maimed and blinded.
The Emergency Provisions Act,
enacted in 1972, which takes the
place of the previous Special
Powers Act, "gives the British
government power to do almost

anything they want in Ireland...
Only the names have been
changed to make it sound less
offensive," he said.
In 1971, through this act, the
British introduced internment
without trial. Out of a population
of VA million Northern Irish, over
4000 people have been interned,
Heffernan said, and 1100 violent
deaths have occurred.
At present, between 600 and
700 Protestants and Catholics are
being held without trial or charge.
"Every working class family has
been affected in some way"by
the jailing and the violence, he
said.
Strongly emphasizing the
disassociation of the Provisional
IRA from the Official IRA,
Heffernan blamed part of the
trouble on the "Provo's" tactics.
This right-wing group has
"severely retarded the cause of
Irish unity" by carrying out
civilian bombings, he charged.
Heffernan stressed that the
official IRA retaliates against the
British army when the army kills
Irishmen, but does not retaliate
against civilians.
"We are Republicans. We jye
Socialists... A United Social
Ireland" would provide e
solution to the problem accordijr
to the IRA's philosophy, s$
Heffernan.
Heffernan, 25, will contin
his United States tour on behi
of Sinn Fein. He hopes to recer <5
more support from U.S. Iris
Republican Clubs as he present
the Official IRA view of the Iris
situation.
