# Prof: More 'Grad Grubbing'
## High GPA Surprises Many 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
When a survey conducted by a
Faculty Senate panel reported last
week that the grade point average of
the typical undergraduate here is 3.55,
some people seemed surprised.
Sociology Prof. Sanford M.
Dornbusch said he was surprised
because "I don't grade that high."
Dornbusch did say, however, that
"students are working harder and
there's a lot more 'grade grubbing'
going on" which could lead to higher
grades.
But student effort is not the only
reason grades are so high, said Assoc.
History Prof. David Kennedy, who
pointed to a "moral atmosphere"

among students and professors.
"There is this idea going around
that any grade other than an A has to
be explained by the professor, and
that's ridiculous," he said.
'Ludicrous' Situation
Terming the current situation
"ludicrous," Kennedy said, "it's gone
too far. I've thought something should
be done about it for a long time. The
whole purpose of grades is being
destroyed."
Kennedy, who is considered by
many students to be a hard grader,
said he was "slightly embarrassed,
because my grades are not spread as
widely as perhaps they should be."
On the other hand, Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Dale Snape said he was
not surprised because he knew of a
survey conducted two years ago which
showed the typical undergraduate's
GPA to be 3.50.
"It's All Relative"
Snape tended to play down the
importance of the increase, noting
"anyone who takes grade point
averages into account knows it's all
relative."
Student reaction to the GPA level
was mixed. ASSU President Mike
Herman said he thought the study was
"an accurate reflection of the grade
point average at Stanford," but some
students said they didn't think the
survey was so accurate.
"I always wondered why my GPA
was so high," Susan Luttner, a senior
majoring in communication, said,
adding that she was "suspicious of the
survey's accuracy."
Another student who wished to
remain anonymous complained

bitterly about the survey, theorizing
that it was "a faculty plot to get
students to work harder."
"If I took this thing seriously, it
would really make me feel like I'm a
dummy," the student said.
Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron,
chairman of the Ad Hoc Panel to
Study the Grading System, said the
survey included the grade reports of
200 students from last autumn
quarter.
'Semi-Random'
Although he said the sample was
only "semi-random," he said he was
"sure that the results are reasonably
accurate."
The pass and no-credit grades did
not figure in the grade point average
"in my way of reckoning," Efron said.
The Efron panel is a sub-panel of
the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement.
The survey of last autumn quarter's
grades also showed that 39 percent of
the marks received by undergraduates
were A's, 26 percent B's, 7 percent C's
and the rest split among the pass,
no-credit and incomplete options.
