## 'Movin' On' Tracks Along 
### George 
Believe it or not, we critics do
not set out to attack everything
we review. Nowhere is it written,
"Bear thy Bic ballpoint and be
prepared to kill." Ah, but we live
by such an axiom, you say.
Let us now set the facts
straight: we only attack shows
that are thoughtless or superficial
and obviously put on solely to fill
air time. It is that simple. In
response to the many who picture
us kicking dogs for sheer pleasure
and who can't fathom a touch of
warmth within us, we now present
.a surprise: a review of a television
program in which the program
isn't attacked.
The series is called "Movin'
On." It is the story of two
truckdrivers and the adventures
they have while traveling across
the country. If this is all a show
has going for it, then it merits
attack.
But this series explores human
relationships with a sense of
humor and an element of concern.
Although it is not a great series,
we certainly respect its
whole-souled effort and
recommend it to anyone seeking
better than average television.
Trucker Relations
As with the old "Cannonball"
series in the late 50s, the premise
of this show is that the
relationships between two
truckers and the people they meet
can be valuable to them and the
viewer.
The friendship between the
two drivers, is as intriguing as the
characters themselves. Claude
Akins, a veteran actor ("They
could do a season with my pilots"),
portrays Sonny Pruett, gypsy
trucker, who, according to an
NBC press release is "ready to
fight at the drop of a tire iron."
Other Actor
He is joined by relative
television newcomer Frank
Converse (formerly of "NYPD"
and "Coronet Blue"), as Will
Chandler, Harvard Law School
dropout, disenchanted with the
"unholy war" and seeking to "get
my head straight."
Characters with these divergent
backgrounds could easily turn
cornball. Worse yet, they could
become Jack Webb propaganda
machines. But the inevitable has
not happened. They have
remained real, believable people
and on television in 1974 or
anytime for that matter, that is an
achievement.
Granted, sometimes they, like
real people, are dull; but more
often then not, they are likable.
We particularly like their
humorous interactions with one
another. We are amused by the
scene of a girl opening Will's
suitcase and pulling out the
bottom of a girl's bathing suit,
thus causing Sonny to comment,
"Will, all this time you never
told me."
Certainly Not Comedy
Don't get the impression that
this show is a comedy certain
moments provide good comic
relief, but for the most part, the
stories are serious and they do
make an honest attempt to
explore character. Even better is
the fact that the stories, in the

manner of the very successful and
still good "Gunsmoke," are not all
built around Sonny and Will.
Often, the focus is taken off of
them to show us a rebel truck
driver furious at the world
because he is dying of cancer or
the problematic partnership of a
group of convicts. We like this
show because it doesn't simply
tell us that people are good or
bad; it tries to tell us why they are
what they are.
We did tell you that we don't
consider this show great and we
don't. "The Waltons" approaches
greatness in character
development because it eliminates
the rough edges. This series still
has some.
Problems
For one thing, the cheap,
trashy background music and even
the title theme have got to go.
Another major problem is that the
writers of this show frequently try
to stretch a half-hour to a full
hour and the program reeks of
being padded. This was evident in

the recent episode, "The Trick is
to Stay Alive," about criminals
who hijak the truck and force
Sonny and Will to drive for them.
This episode stretched the plot to
the point of containing cheap
scenes of the truck on the road
and superfluous killing to make the
plot sensational. This is obvious
commercialism and it could
destroy a decent show.
On the whole, the program has
a great deal of potential. We have
seen what its characters and
writers can do at their best as well
as their worst.
If the trend toward
over-commercialization of this
series persists, then "Movin On"
should indeed take the advice
offered by its title. We hope this
will not have to be the case. We
hope that the show's writers will
take TV Guide's pre-season
warning concerning its future:
"There are dangerous curves
ahead and look out for
plotholes."
'Movin On' can be seen Thursdays
at 10 p.m. on NBC (Channel 4).
