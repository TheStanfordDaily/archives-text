# Ballet Performance Marked By Boring Choreography
## 
### CHRISTINE SHERRY 
Boring choreography and an
embarrasing level of technical
ability characterized the Pacific
Ballet performance last Friday
evening at Memorial Auditorium.
Three disappointing works, all by the
company's artistic director John
Pasqualetti, seemed fragmented,
lacking direction and cluttered with
purposeless repetition of trite
phrases.
Apollo, the evening's opener,
lacked purpose, design and unity.
One had a difficult time grasping
any sustained awareness of form;
the stage engulfed the dancers,
and spatial patterns were either
weak, unpleasant or nonexistent.
The choreography lacked
motivation; arms and legs moved
randomly, without a feeling of
strength or center, and transitions
were blurred.
John Loschmann as Apollo was
attractive, but he dances without
authority, lacking the power and
assurance so necessary to the role.
Deborah Frates, Jackie Tertrou
and Susan Alleluia as the Muses
did little more than wander
aimlessly around the stage; neither
a collective entity nor readily
distinguishable individuals, their
movements seemed studied and
difficult and their relation to
Apollo was poorly defined and
poorly integrated.
Awkward Pairings
Partnering also seemed
awkward; lack of technical
expertise prevented the dancers
from moving with ease and
fluidity.
Rhapsody in Blue, with
Catherine Prior and Jeff
Sherwood was a slight
improvement, but only very
slight. Again, choreography was
weak, consisting of little more
than Bejart-like grande
battements and countless hip

undulations.
Unlike most of the company's
dancers, Prior has a certain degree
of presence and appeal. She is
vivacious, perhaps overly so; her
carriage and facial expression are
often exaggerated to the point of
being ludicrous. Sherwood is a
bland performer who goes
through the motions without
enthusiasm.
Dancing Not Up To Music
What was disturbing about
Rhapsody in Blue was that the
dancing seemed at odds musically,
and that the movement was often
lost in the power of the Gershwin
score. Pasqualetti seems to have a
great deal of difficulty in keeping
his music and choreography on a
roughly equal artistic level; the
extremeley familiar scores he
selects can only be balanced by
choreography that is highly
original and imaginative.
The final offering Romeo and
Juliet, showed promise with some
very nice group patterns, but the
work suffered by being neither
purely literal nor purely abstract.
There were hints of an illicit
liason between Romeo and
Tyblat, but Pasqualetti never got
the drama out of his head and
onto the stage, and a distinctive
point of view or resolve never
crystallized.
'Empty Shell'
The result was confusing; lack
of clear motivation again reduced
the dancing to an empty shell.
Pasqualetti's main problem seems
to be a lack of conviction; he
gropes for movements to express a
feeling but seldom succeeds and
lapses into the standard and
unimaginative. The dancing once
again was mechanical, the energy
level static.
In the last few months, dance
in the Bay Area has shown
remarkable promise. Carlos

Carjaval's experiments with a
blending of religious and folk
styles has had exciting results, as
evidenced by a recent
performance in Grace Cathedral.
Norbert Vesak's version of the
Bernstein Mass was widely
regarded as a brilliant
accomplishment, and both the
San Francisco Dance Theater and
the Footloose Compnay have yet
to gain recognition for their
admirable innovations.
Unfortunately, Pacific Ballet
does not seem open to much
constructive growth. Pasqualetti,
like Lew Christensen of the San
Francisco Ballet, lacks the courage
to experiment freely in his
choreography, and his occasional
good efforts are lost in too much
padding.
