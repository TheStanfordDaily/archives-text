Ford Hits GOP Campaign Trail
WASHINGTON President Ford mounted a
four-state political rescue mission for embattled
Republican candidates yesterday, saying "more than
anything else, we need a Congress willing to fight
inflation." '
The President warned that sweeping Democratic
victories next month could produce a "legislative
dictatorship." He said that danger will be increased
if too many voters stay home "or blindly penalize
good Republican candidates for the misdeeds of
others."
Speaking at a fund-raising dinner in Indianapolis,
Ind., Ford said GOP candidates were needed in
Congress as "inflation-fighters" to help pass his
economic program and cure big government and
deficit spending.
Ford returned to Washington early this morning
after appearances in Missouri, South Dakota,
Nebraska and Indiana.
On the plane to the capital, Press Secretary Ron
Nessen said Ford "was happy with his crowds and
his reception all day."
"He feels he can have an effect" on the election
outcome, Nessen said.
In Indianapolis, Ford urged support for his
proposed five percent surtax on individual incomes,
despite open opposition to it from the Indiana
Republicans for whom he was campaigning.
Boston Mayor Blasts Guardsmen
BOSTON The National Guard will remain on
alert in the despite criticism by Mayor
Kevin H. White that it comprises "an inept,
incompetent, ill-equipped, undisciplined or
undertrained militia."
Gen. Vahan Vartanian, adjutant general of the
Massachusetts National Guard, said his troops would
remain in the city as long as they are needed. He
said the men are well trained and well equipped.
"I take my order from the governor; he is the
commander-in-chief," Vartanian said.
Gov. Francis W. Sargent ordered the guard
mobilized Tuesday following a disturbance at Hyde
Park High School in which eight white students
were hospitalized, one with a severe stab wound.
Sargent also asked President Ford to send in federal
troops, but the request was denied.
Attendance at Hyde Park High School, the scene
of trouble Tuesday, was off sharply. About 250
policemen patrolled outside the high school and in
its corridors. One youth was arrested on charges of
assaulting a police officer.
Ford Testifies On Pardon Today
WASHINGTON Democratic members of the
House Judiciary subcommittee that will question
President Ford about his pardon of Richard M.
Nixon say they are not expecting to learn anything
new.
The limited time available for questioning, the
narrow scope of the inquiry and a reluctance to put
a president on the grill will prevent any deep
probing of the issue, in their view.
Ford's unprecedented appearance, a voluntary
act on his part, will be broadcast and televised,
starting at 7 a.m. PDT today.
The hearing will center on 14 questions raised by
Reps. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) and John Conyers

(D-Mich.) in formal resolutions directing the House
to seek the answers from executive branch.
Ford's decision is seen by the two senior
Democrats on the subcommittee as a shrewd
political move designed to overcome the generally
unfavorable public reaction to the pardon.
Rocky Hearings Reopen Nov. 13
WASHINGTON Senate Rules Committee
Democrats, rejecting a plea by Nelson A.
Rockefeller for a chance to testify immediately, said
yesterday the panel would reopen its hearings on
Rockefeller's vice presidential nomination Nov. 13.
Chairman Howard A. Cannon (D-Nev.)
announced the committee schedule after saying that
Nov. 13 was the earliest date his panel could meet.
Congress reconvenes Nov. 18 from an election
recess.
Rockefeller, who said he wanted to explain issues
raised over his nomination, said in a terse statement:
"I regret that I won't have a proper forum for at
least another month."
Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott said
Cannon had not consulted him or any other
Republicans on the Rules Committee and that he
was "extremely disappointed" by the chairman's
announcement.
Scott said Rockefeller had been denied "a decent
and early opportunity for him to balance the grossly
unbalanced public accounts" of allegations against
him.
Ford May Veto Turkish Aid Again
WASHINGTON President Ford is leaning in
the direction of a second veto of legislation to cut
off military aid to Turkey, Press Secretary Ron
Nessen said last night.
Earlier yesterday, Congress voted to suspend aid
to Turkey Dec. 10 or sooner if Turkey sends any
more U.S. arms to its invasion force in Cyprus.
Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott (R-Pa.)
said the President by this morning would veto the
money bill to which the ban was attached.
"His basic reason is the reason he vetoed the
other one," that it would "undennine delicate
negotiations," Nessen said.
The House failed Tuesday by 16 votes to muster
the two-thirds vote necessary to override
President Ford's veto of a bill which would have cut
off aid to Turkey immediately.
The White House agreed informally to an
amendment to permit the President to ignore the
aid cutoff until Dec. 10 if he determined it would
"further negotiations for a peaceful resolution of
Cyprus conflict."
A veto would force the House Appropriations
Committee to draft a third continuing resolution in
an effort to break the stalemate.
U.S. Acts To Curb Loan Defaults
WASHINGTON The government moved
yesterday to curb defaults on federally insured
college student loans, which have cost taxpayers an
estimated $252 million.
Among a series of proposals, the U.S. Office of
Education threatened to "limit, suspend or
terminate" participation by certain lending and
educational institutions failing to obey the new
restrictions.
The nine-year old guaranteed student loan

program provides up to $2500 a year for college and
vocational study. The loans are insured by the
federal government or guaranteed by state and
private non-profit agencies.
About 4 million students have received more
than $7 billion since the program began.
The General Accounting Office told Congress last
month that one out of every four student borrowers
could be expected to default.
Veto For Increased GI Benefits?
WASHINGTON President Ford is considering
vetoing increases in GI education benefits voted by
Congress last week as inflationary, White House
sources said yesterday.
Sen. Vance Hartke (D-Ind.) chairman of the
Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, said he has told
the White House that if there is a veto there will be
a major effort in Congress to override it.
The legislation provides 23 percent increases for
most veterans who are students, a figure Ford has
said is too high. He suggested 18 to 19 percent as
coming nearer to making up for cost-of-living
increases.
Leftists Challenge Peron's Rule
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina Leftist guerrillas
have stolen the remains of former President Pedro
E. Aramburu in a bold new challenge to the
government of President Isabel Peron, police said
yesterday.
The defiance of Peron comes at a time when her
administration is struggling to cope with a rash of
killings and kidnapings by extremists of both right
and left. Since early July more than 100 persons
have died in political violence.
Irish Inmates Release Hostages
ARMAGH, Northern Ireland Women inmates
of Armagh Prison held a prison warden and three
women prison guards hostage for 14 hours
yesterday before voluntarily releasing them
unharmed early today, prison officials said.
The prisoners wanted sympathetic politicians and
the International Red Cross to visit the wrecked
Maze prison, scene of a fierce riot Tuesday, "and
come back and tell us our men are safe and not
being ill-treated."
The Armagh siege was the latest of a series of
disorders to hit Northern Ireland in protest against
the jailinf of suspected terrorists without trial.
A's Win, Lead Series 3-1
OAKLAND Pinch-hitter Jim Holt stroked a
two-run single, highlighting a four-run Oakland rally
that carried the A's to a 5-2 victory over the Los
Angeles Dodgers in last night's fourth game of the
World Series.
The triumph gave the A's a 3-1 edge in the
best-of-seven series. The American League
champions will try to nail down their third straight
world title in the fifth game, which starts at 5:30
p.m., PDT, today.
Today's Weather

Ford Hits GOP Campaign Trail
WASHINGTON President Ford mounted a
four-state political rescue mission for embattled
Republican candidates yesterday, saying "more than
anything else, we need a Congress willing to fight
inflation." '
The President warned that sweeping Democratic
victories next month could produce a "legislative
dictatorship." He said that danger will be increased
if too many voters stay home "or blindly penalize
good Republican candidates for the misdeeds of
others."
Speaking at a fund-raising dinner in Indianapolis,
Ind., Ford said GOP candidates were needed in
Congress as "inflation-fighters" to help pass his
economic program and cure big government and
deficit spending.
Ford returned to Washington early this morning
after appearances in Missouri, South Dakota,
Nebraska and Indiana.
On the plane to the capital, Press Secretary Ron
Nessen said Ford "was happy with his crowds and
his reception all day."
"He feels he can have an effect" on the election
outcome, Nessen said.
In Indianapolis, Ford urged support for his
proposed five percent surtax on individual incomes,
despite open opposition to it from the Indiana
Republicans for whom he was campaigning.
Boston Mayor Blasts Guardsmen
BOSTON The National Guard will remain on
alert in the despite criticism by Mayor
Kevin H. White that it comprises "an inept,
incompetent, ill-equipped, undisciplined or
undertrained militia."
Gen. Vahan Vartanian, adjutant general of the
Massachusetts National Guard, said his troops would
remain in the city as long as they are needed. He
said the men are well trained and well equipped.
"I take my order from the governor; he is the
commander-in-chief," Vartanian said.
Gov. Francis W. Sargent ordered the guard
mobilized Tuesday following a disturbance at Hyde
Park High School in which eight white students
were hospitalized, one with a severe stab wound.
Sargent also asked President Ford to send in federal
troops, but the request was denied.
Attendance at Hyde Park High School, the scene
of trouble Tuesday, was off sharply. About 250
policemen patrolled outside the high school and in
its corridors. One youth was arrested on charges of
assaulting a police officer.
Ford Testifies On Pardon Today
WASHINGTON Democratic members of the
House Judiciary subcommittee that will question
President Ford about his pardon of Richard M.
Nixon say they are not expecting to learn anything
new.
The limited time available for questioning, the
narrow scope of the inquiry and a reluctance to put
a president on the grill will prevent any deep
probing of the issue, in their view.
Ford's unprecedented appearance, a voluntary
act on his part, will be broadcast and televised,
starting at 7 a.m. PDT today.
The hearing will center on 14 questions raised by
Reps. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) and John Conyers

(D-Mich.) in formal resolutions directing the House
to seek the answers from executive branch.
Ford's decision is seen by the two senior
Democrats on the subcommittee as a shrewd
political move designed to overcome the generally
unfavorable public reaction to the pardon.
Rocky Hearings Reopen Nov. 13
WASHINGTON Senate Rules Committee
Democrats, rejecting a plea by Nelson A.

yesterday the panel would reopen its hearings on
Rockefeller's vice presidential nomination Nov. 13.
Chairman Howard A. Cannon (D-Nev.)
announced the committee schedule after saying that
Nov. 13 was the earliest date his panel could meet.
Congress reconvenes Nov. 18 from an election
recess.
Rockefeller, who said he wanted to explain issues
raised over his nomination, said in a terse statement:
"I regret that I won't have a proper forum for at
least another month."
Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott said
Cannon had not consulted him or any other
Republicans on the Rules Committee and that he
was "extremely disappointed" by the chairman's
announcement.
Scott said Rockefeller had been denied "a decent
and early opportunity for him to balance the grossly
unbalanced public accounts" of allegations against
him.
Ford May Veto Turkish Aid Again
WASHINGTON President Ford is leaning in
the direction of a second veto of legislation to cut
off military aid to Turkey, Press Secretary Ron
Nessen said last night.
Earlier yesterday, Congress voted to suspend aid
to Turkey Dec. 10 or sooner if Turkey sends any
more U.S. arms to its invasion force in Cyprus.
Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott (R-Pa.)
said the President by this morning would veto the
money bill to which the ban was attached.
"His basic reason is the reason he vetoed the
other one," that it would "undennine delicate
negotiations," Nessen said.
The House failed Tuesday by 16 votes to muster
the two-thirds vote necessary to override
President Ford's veto of a bill which would have cut
off aid to Turkey immediately.
The White House agreed informally to an
amendment to permit the President to ignore the
aid cutoff until Dec. 10 if he determined it would
"further negotiations for a peaceful resolution of
Cyprus conflict."
A veto would force the House Appropriations
Committee to draft a third continuing resolution in
an effort to break the stalemate.
U.S. Acts To Curb Loan Defaults
WASHINGTON The government moved
yesterday to curb defaults on federally insured
college student loans, which have cost taxpayers an
estimated $252 million.
Among a series of proposals, the U.S. Office of

terminate" participation by certain lending and
educational institutions failing to obey the new
restrictions.
The nine-year old guaranteed student loan

program provides up to $2500 a year for college and
vocational study. The loans are insured by the
federal government or guaranteed by state and
private non-profit agencies.
About 4 million students have received more

Sen. Vance Hartke (D-Ind.) chairman of the

the White House that if there is a veto there will be
a major effort in Congress to override it.
The legislation provides 23 percent increases for
most veterans who are students, a figure Ford has
said is too high. He suggested 18 to 19 percent as
coming nearer to making up for cost-of-living
increases.
Leftists Challenge Peron's Rule
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina Leftist guerrillas
have stolen the remains of former President Pedro
E. Aramburu in a bold new challenge to the

the International Red Cross to visit the wrecked
Maze prison, scene of a fierce riot Tuesday, "and

of Armagh Prison held a prison warden and three
women prison guards hostage for 14 hours

come back and tell us our men are safe and not
being ill-treated."
The Armagh siege was the latest of a series of

Ford Hits GOP Campaign Trail
WASHINGTON President Ford mounted a
four-state political rescue mission for embattled
Republican candidates yesterday, saying "more than
anything else, we need a Congress willing to fight
inflation." '
The President warned that sweeping Democratic
victories next month could produce a "legislative
dictatorship." He said that danger will be increased
if too many voters stay home "or blindly penalize
good Republican candidates for the misdeeds of
others."
Speaking at a fund-raising dinner in Indianapolis,
Ind., Ford said GOP candidates were needed in
Congress as "inflation-fighters" to help pass his
economic program and cure big government and
deficit spending.
Ford returned to Washington early this morning
after appearances in Missouri, South Dakota,
Nebraska and Indiana.
On the plane to the capital, Press Secretary Ron
Nessen said Ford "was happy with his crowds and
his reception all day."
"He feels he can have an effect" on the election
outcome, Nessen said.
In Indianapolis, Ford urged support for his
proposed five percent surtax on individual incomes,
despite open opposition to it from the Indiana
Republicans for whom he was campaigning.
Boston Mayor Blasts Guardsmen
BOSTON The National Guard will remain on
alert in the despite criticism by Mayor
Kevin H. White that it comprises "an inept,
incompetent, ill-equipped, undisciplined or
undertrained militia."
Gen. Vahan Vartanian, adjutant general of the
Massachusetts National Guard, said his troops would
remain in the city as long as they are needed. He
said the men are well trained and well equipped.
"I take my order from the governor; he is the
commander-in-chief," Vartanian said.
Gov. Francis W. Sargent ordered the guard
mobilized Tuesday following a disturbance at Hyde
Park High School in which eight white students
were hospitalized, one with a severe stab wound.
Sargent also asked President Ford to send in federal
troops, but the request was denied.
Attendance at Hyde Park High School, the scene
of trouble Tuesday, was off sharply. About 250
policemen patrolled outside the high school and in
its corridors. One youth was arrested on charges of
assaulting a police officer.
Ford Testifies On Pardon Today
WASHINGTON Democratic members of the
House Judiciary subcommittee that will question
President Ford about his pardon of Richard M.
Nixon say they are not expecting to learn anything
new.
The limited time available for questioning, the
narrow scope of the inquiry and a reluctance to put
a president on the grill will prevent any deep
probing of the issue, in their view.
Ford's unprecedented appearance, a voluntary
act on his part, will be broadcast and televised,
starting at 7 a.m. PDT today.
The hearing will center on 14 questions raised by
Reps. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) and John Conyers

(D-Mich.) in formal resolutions directing the House
to seek the answers from executive branch.
Ford's decision is seen by the two senior
Democrats on the subcommittee as a shrewd
political move designed to overcome the generally
unfavorable public reaction to the pardon.

Democrats, rejecting a plea by Nelson A.

announced the committee schedule after saying that
Nov. 13 was the earliest date his panel could meet.
Congress reconvenes Nov. 18 from an election
recess.
Rockefeller, who said he wanted to explain issues
raised over his nomination, said in a terse statement:
"I regret that I won't have a proper forum for at

Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott said
Cannon had not consulted him or any other
Republicans on the Rules Committee and that he
was "extremely disappointed" by the chairman's
announcement.
Scott said Rockefeller had been denied "a decent
and early opportunity for him to balance the grossly
unbalanced public accounts" of allegations against
him.
Ford May Veto Turkish Aid Again
WASHINGTON President Ford is leaning in
the direction of a second veto of legislation to cut
off military aid to Turkey, Press Secretary Ron
Nessen said last night.
Earlier yesterday, Congress voted to suspend aid
to Turkey Dec. 10 or sooner if Turkey sends any
more U.S. arms to its invasion force in Cyprus.
Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott (R-Pa.)
said the President by this morning would veto the
money bill to which the ban was attached.
"His basic reason is the reason he vetoed the
other one," that it would "undennine delicate
negotiations," Nessen said.
The House failed Tuesday by 16 votes to muster
the two-thirds vote necessary to override
President Ford's veto of a bill which would have cut
off aid to Turkey immediately.
The White House agreed informally to an
amendment to permit the President to ignore the
aid cutoff until Dec. 10 if he determined it would
"further negotiations for a peaceful resolution of
Cyprus conflict."
A veto would force the House Appropriations
Committee to draft a third continuing resolution in
an effort to break the stalemate.

educational institutions failing to obey the new

Veto For Increased GI Benefits?
WASHINGTON President Ford is considering

Congress last week as inflationary, White House
sources said yesterday.
Sen. Vance Hartke (D-Ind.) chairman of the
Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, said he has told
the White House that if there is a veto there will be
a major effort in Congress to override it.
The legislation provides 23 percent increases for
most veterans who are students, a figure Ford has
said is too high. He suggested 18 to 19 percent as
coming nearer to making up for cost-of-living
increases.

Veto For Increased GI Benefits?
WASHINGTON President Ford is considering
vetoing increases in GI education benefits voted by
Congress last week as inflationary, White House
sources said yesterday.
Sen. Vance Hartke (D-Ind.) chairman of the
Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, said he has told
the White House that if there is a veto there will be
a major effort in Congress to override it.
The legislation provides 23 percent increases for
most veterans who are students, a figure Ford has
said is too high. He suggested 18 to 19 percent as
coming nearer to making up for cost-of-living
increases.
Leftists Challenge Peron's Rule
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina Leftist guerrillas
have stolen the remains of former President Pedro
E. Aramburu in a bold new challenge to the
government of President Isabel Peron, police said
yesterday.
The defiance of Peron comes at a time when her
administration is struggling to cope with a rash of
killings and kidnapings by extremists of both right
and left. Since early July more than 100 persons
have died in political violence.
Irish Inmates Release Hostages
ARMAGH, Northern Ireland Women inmates
of Armagh Prison held a prison warden and three
women prison guards hostage for 14 hours
yesterday before voluntarily releasing them
unharmed early today, prison officials said.
The prisoners wanted sympathetic politicians and
the International Red Cross to visit the wrecked
Maze prison, scene of a fierce riot Tuesday, "and
come back and tell us our men are safe and not
being ill-treated."
The Armagh siege was the latest of a series of
disorders to hit Northern Ireland in protest against
the jailinf of suspected terrorists without trial.

Ford Hits GOP Campaign Trail
WASHINGTON President Ford mounted a
four-state political rescue mission for embattled
Republican candidates yesterday, saying "more than
anything else, we need a Congress willing to fight
inflation." '
The President warned that sweeping Democratic
victories next month could produce a "legislative
dictatorship." He said that danger will be increased
if too many voters stay home "or blindly penalize
good Republican candidates for the misdeeds of
others."
Speaking at a fund-raising dinner in Indianapolis,
Ind., Ford said GOP candidates were needed in
Congress as "inflation-fighters" to help pass his
economic program and cure big government and
deficit spending.
Ford returned to Washington early this morning
after appearances in Missouri, South Dakota,
Nebraska and Indiana.
On the plane to the capital, Press Secretary Ron
Nessen said Ford "was happy with his crowds and
his reception all day."
"He feels he can have an effect" on the election
outcome, Nessen said.
In Indianapolis, Ford urged support for his
proposed five percent surtax on individual incomes,
despite open opposition to it from the Indiana
Republicans for whom he was campaigning.
Boston Mayor Blasts Guardsmen
BOSTON The National Guard will remain on
alert in the despite criticism by Mayor
Kevin H. White that it comprises "an inept,
incompetent, ill-equipped, undisciplined or
undertrained militia."
Gen. Vahan Vartanian, adjutant general of the
Massachusetts National Guard, said his troops would
remain in the city as long as they are needed. He
said the men are well trained and well equipped.
"I take my order from the governor; he is the
commander-in-chief," Vartanian said.
Gov. Francis W. Sargent ordered the guard
mobilized Tuesday following a disturbance at Hyde
Park High School in which eight white students
were hospitalized, one with a severe stab wound.
Sargent also asked President Ford to send in federal
troops, but the request was denied.
Attendance at Hyde Park High School, the scene
of trouble Tuesday, was off sharply. About 250
policemen patrolled outside the high school and in
its corridors. One youth was arrested on charges of
assaulting a police officer.
Ford Testifies On Pardon Today
WASHINGTON Democratic members of the
House Judiciary subcommittee that will question
President Ford about his pardon of Richard M.
Nixon say they are not expecting to learn anything
new.
The limited time available for questioning, the
narrow scope of the inquiry and a reluctance to put
a president on the grill will prevent any deep
probing of the issue, in their view.
Ford's unprecedented appearance, a voluntary
act on his part, will be broadcast and televised,
starting at 7 a.m. PDT today.
The hearing will center on 14 questions raised by
Reps. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) and John Conyers

(D-Mich.) in formal resolutions directing the House
to seek the answers from executive branch.
Ford's decision is seen by the two senior
Democrats on the subcommittee as a shrewd
political move designed to overcome the generally
unfavorable public reaction to the pardon.
Rocky Hearings Reopen Nov. 13
WASHINGTON Senate Rules Committee
Democrats, rejecting a plea by Nelson A.
Rockefeller for a chance to testify immediately, said
yesterday the panel would reopen its hearings on
Rockefeller's vice presidential nomination Nov. 13.
Chairman Howard A. Cannon (D-Nev.)
announced the committee schedule after saying that
Nov. 13 was the earliest date his panel could meet.
Congress reconvenes Nov. 18 from an election
recess.
Rockefeller, who said he wanted to explain issues
raised over his nomination, said in a terse statement:
"I regret that I won't have a proper forum for at
least another month."
Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott said
Cannon had not consulted him or any other
Republicans on the Rules Committee and that he
was "extremely disappointed" by the chairman's
announcement.
Scott said Rockefeller had been denied "a decent
and early opportunity for him to balance the grossly
unbalanced public accounts" of allegations against
him.
Ford May Veto Turkish Aid Again
WASHINGTON President Ford is leaning in
the direction of a second veto of legislation to cut
off military aid to Turkey, Press Secretary Ron
Nessen said last night.
Earlier yesterday, Congress voted to suspend aid
to Turkey Dec. 10 or sooner if Turkey sends any
more U.S. arms to its invasion force in Cyprus.
Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott (R-Pa.)
said the President by this morning would veto the
money bill to which the ban was attached.
"His basic reason is the reason he vetoed the
other one," that it would "undennine delicate
negotiations," Nessen said.
The House failed Tuesday by 16 votes to muster
the two-thirds vote necessary to override
President Ford's veto of a bill which would have cut
off aid to Turkey immediately.
The White House agreed informally to an
amendment to permit the President to ignore the
aid cutoff until Dec. 10 if he determined it would
"further negotiations for a peaceful resolution of
Cyprus conflict."
A veto would force the House Appropriations
Committee to draft a third continuing resolution in
an effort to break the stalemate.
U.S. Acts To Curb Loan Defaults
WASHINGTON The government moved
yesterday to curb defaults on federally insured
college student loans, which have cost taxpayers an
estimated $252 million.
Among a series of proposals, the U.S. Office of
Education threatened to "limit, suspend or
terminate" participation by certain lending and
educational institutions failing to obey the new
restrictions.
The nine-year old guaranteed student loan

program provides up to $2500 a year for college and
vocational study. The loans are insured by the
federal government or guaranteed by state and
private non-profit agencies.
About 4 million students have received more
than $7 billion since the program began.
The General Accounting Office told Congress last
month that one out of every four student borrowers
could be expected to default.
