Check Designing Contest
The ASSU will be offering a $2OO
first prize in an upcoming contest to
design a new logo for ASSU checks,
Asst. Financial Manager Jeff
Greenwald said yesterday.
All students are eligible to
participate. There will also be a second
prize of $5O, a third prize of $25 and
fourth and fifth prizes of free Sunday
Flicks passes for winter quarter.
The contest has grown out of the
desire of the ASSU to replace its
present logo, described as "rotten" by
Greenwald.
The present design features eight
Indians in a row on whose backs are
printed the letters S-T-A-N-F-O-R-D.
The submitted designs should
"portray imagination and originality"
as well as "something of Stanford,"
Greenwald noted.
Deadline for submitting designs to
the ASSU is Dec. 10, with winners
announced three days later. The ASSU
business staff will judge the entries.
