# Nine Firms Submit Bids For TMU Food Service
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
Nine private companies have
submitted proposals for operating
Tresidder Union's food service, but
only the proposal of TDS,
Inc., the present contractor,
â€¢* was a "positive response," Tresidder
General Manager Gordon Starr said
yesterday.
The University invited the nine
firms to propose plans for taking over
all of Tresidder's food operations,
including the cafeteria (now called
* "the Transition"), Coffee House,
catering service, Encina Commons and
a new pub.
According to Starr, the bids
submitted by the eight companies
other than TDS were "extremely

sketchy. All eight were willing to look
at our package, but they all wanted
the University to incur some of the
financial risk for their operations," he
said.
"They all alluded to the high risks
involved, especially in making capital
improvements," he added. Tresidder
food services have been losing money
for four years, first under University
control and then after being taken
over by TDS.
Unenthusiastic Response
Starr said that because of the
unenthusiastic response of the nine
bidders, the University is giving strong
consideration to hiring out each of the
Tresidder operations to separate
contractors. "We might let one
company handle the catering, another
the pub and a third the commons," he
stated.
"Right now we are also considering
changing the existing services
considerably, for example, by bringing
in a McDonald's franchise to replace
the Transition, or putting in a
spaghetti operation, keeping Marcel's
[the pastry counter] and the Coffee
House and adding an ice cream
franchise," said Starr.
He noted that similar plans of
dividing the services among a number
of established firms had worked well
at both the University of Cincinnati
and Ohio State University.
Another plan under consideration
would involve retaining TDS under a
long-term lease and reducing the
number of food services on campus.
"Much of the space now taken up by
eating, places could be allotted for
academic services instead," Starr
added.
Starr said that the "shooting
direction" for the Tresidder food
programs would be decided in the next
two to four weeks, after University
officials meet with representatives of
the present management and the
ASSU.
The ultimate decision, according to
Starr, will be made by Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons.
Declining Service
"Our decision to solicit proposals
was the result of about four years of
declining service," said Starr. "Over
the past two years the decline hasn't
been as fast, but obviously we need

quite a few improvements soon."
The University Food Service
managed the Tresidder operations
until the 1972-73 school year, when
Tresidder had a deficit of over
$200,000. TDS took over in June of
last year, but the Tresidder operations
continued to lose customers and
money. This summer, the Tresidder
cafeteria became "the Transition," a
fast-food operation.
