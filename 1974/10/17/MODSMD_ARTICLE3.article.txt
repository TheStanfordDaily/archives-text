# Nine Firms Submit Bids For TMU Food Service
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
Nine private companies have
submitted proposals for operating
Tresidder Union's food service, but
only the proposal of TDS,
Inc., the present contractor,
•* was a "positive response," Tresidder
General Manager Gordon Starr said
yesterday.
The University invited the nine
firms to propose plans for taking over
all of Tresidder's food operations,
including the cafeteria (now called
* "the Transition"), Coffee House,
catering service, Encina Commons and
a new pub.
According to Starr, the bids
submitted by the eight companies
other than TDS were "extremely

sketchy. All eight were willing to look
at our package, but they all wanted
the University to incur some of the
financial risk for their operations," he
said.
"They all alluded to the high risks
involved, especially in making capital
improvements," he added. Tresidder
food services have been losing money
for four years, first under University
control and then after being taken
over by TDS.
Unenthusiastic Response
Starr said that because of the
unenthusiastic response of the nine
bidders, the University is giving strong
consideration to hiring out each of the
Tresidder operations to separate
