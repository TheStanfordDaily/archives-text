# Murder Spurs Late Night Fears

### JOAN HINMAN STEVE HEFTER 
Outside the Church, rustling leaves jar the night silence.
* Passersby quiet their own footsteps and look back into the
darkness.
No one is there.
On other Tuesday nights Memorial Church was a place
of pilgrimage for prayer and meditation. This Tuesday only
a few students walk anywhere on campus—fewer still enter
the Church.
i "I don't like to walk alone at night, but I have no
choice" says th§ graduate student walking alone behind the
Church on her way back to Crothers Hall.
"I lived in New York City for 18 years and I know
better than to go into a building alone at night," she
declares in defense of her solitary travel, yet she swerves
away from strangers she passes.
, Outside Dinkelspiel, two women stop briefly before
parting to return home—one on foot to Manzanita Park, the
other by bike to Guthrie House .
'Hard To Relate To'
The Guthrie resident says she'll continue to travel alone
oy bike, "out of convenience, out of habit." She finds
Saturday night's murder "hard to relate to because it's not
part of personal experience."
* Echoing her friend's detachment, the woman from
Manzanita Park admits anxiety about walking alone, but
notes, "In a while I'll probably have thrust this to the back
of my mind."
She thinks aloud, "I used to look on this whole place as
a haven where you don't have to worry about people
coming in from the outside and disrupting the established
•order."
Work Of An Outsider
The idea that the disruption was the work of an outsider
•s shared by a worker at the Coffee House, who says she
doesn't think the killer is "our typical little brand of
wierdo."
Still, workers at the Coffee House are no longer allowed
bus dishes in from the Tresidder patio at night. Female
workers are getting rides home from work.
"I liked walking home at night," protests one girl behind
the counter, recalling quieter times.
A worker at Meyer Library has also changed the way she

gets home after midnight. "I didn't hear about the murder
until about 11:30 last night," she explains, "and I
immediately called someone to give me a ride home."
At 11:30 p.m., a woman walks out of Building 200
accompanied by two males. "They came from the dorm to
walk me back," she says of her two friends.
The three are all freshmen from Lagunita and they admit
that their image of Stanford has changed since Saturday
night.
'Not Isolated'
"You realize you're not isolated from the world," the
woman concludes.
One of the men nods, and adds, "When I called home,
my father told me not to walk by the Church late at night."
The Church. For all the fears expressed by late night
campus travelers, the Church becomes the focal point.
"Of all the murders in the area, this one hit home," says
a woman who is getting a ride home from Meyer. Somehow
the Church has become central to the mechanics of fear,
and distance from the Church provides some illusion of
safety for many students.
"Things like this happen all the time," says a resident of
Roble who works until midnight behind the desk at Meyer.
"I mean, when it's my tum to go, I'll go," she concludes
with a fatalistic shrug.
'Too Much Hass'e'
Asked if shp has considered having someone walk her
home from the library, one woman replies simply, "It's too
much hassle."
This is Stanford on the Tuesday night following the
murder of Arlis Perry—a combination of resignation and
paranoia, callousness and cautiousness. The persevering
facade cracks like a stray twig underfoot.
Across the quad from Memorial Church a lone security
guard makes his rounds. He locks doors to empty
classrooms and patrols the darkness with a flashlight.
"They've tightened things up since Saturday," he says while
shutting another window.
Walking outside, he stares at the open doors of Memorial
Church. The house of worship is still and silence pervades
rows of empty pews.
The security guard looks up at the moonless sky. "Nice
night, huh?" he asks with ironic sincerity.
No one answers. No one is there.
