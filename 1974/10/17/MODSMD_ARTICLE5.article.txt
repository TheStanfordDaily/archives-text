# Lyman To Visit China As Education Delegate
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
President Richard W. Lyman will
visit the People's Republic of China
for three weeks next month along with
a delegation of 13 other college and
university presidents.
Sponsored by the National
Committee on U.S.—China Relations,
the delegation will be hosted by the
Chinese People's Institute for Foreign
Affairs. Roger W. Heyns, president of
the American Council on Education
and former UC-Berkeley chancellor,
heads the group.
This is the first delegation of higher
education officials to visit the People's
Republic. "We hope to understand a
little better the structure and
functioning of education in the
People's Republic and to see how it
relates to the rest of their society,"
said Lyman.
"Of course in a three-week period

you can't become an expert!" He
explained that the delegation will "see
a variety of things in addition to our
special interests."
Besides Lyman and Heyns, other
members of the delegation include
Presidents William G. Bowen of
Princeton; Harold Enarson of Ohio
State; Robben Fleming of Michigan;
Martha Peterson of Barnard; Nathan
Pusey, emeritus of Harvard; John D.
Rockefeller IV, of West Virginia
Wesley an; Granville Sawyer of Texas
Southern; Howard Swearer of
Carleton; Charles E. Young, chancellor
of UCLA; Merle Goldman of the
Boston University History
Department; and Jan Berris of the
national committee staff.
Rockefeller's wife, Sharon, is a
member of Stanford's Board of
Trustees.
Coordinating Visits
The national committee has been
coordinating visits between China and
the United States since 1966. "We
hope to improve, on a systematic
basis, relations between the two
countries in all areas," explained
Political Science Prof. John W. Lewis,
vice chairman of the committee's
board of directors. "We want to
increase a general understanding where
for 25 years there was no
understanding," he added.
The committee was instrumental in
bringing China's table tennis team to
the United States, and particularly to
Stanford. Last year, the committee
and the National Education
Association co-sponsored a visit to
China by a delegation of secondary
educators.
Although there are "lots of
groups," according to Lewis, traveling
between the two countries, the
national committee is almost alone in
coordinating exchanges outside those
of the National Committee of Sciences
and the Trade Council.
Recommends Delegation
The committee, funded by private
foundations such as Carnegie, Ford
and Rockefeller, recommends specific
delegations for national exchange to
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
"In areas like President Lyman's
delegation, we can do a job where no
one else is able to do it," said Lewis. A
senior delegation of university
presidents he added, "is essential if

you are seriously going to talk about
educational relations between the two
countries."
The committee, according to Lewis,
strove to create a delegation of
presidents from different types of
schools large and small, private and
public.
Brief Prior Visit
Lyman, who visited China briefly
29 years ago when he was with the
armed forces, said the opportunity "is
sufficiently rare not to be turned
down lightly ... This is not an ideal
time to be away, but ideal times don't
come very often. Provost William F.
Miller will be Acting President as
normal."
The delegation will fly to Peking via
Tokyo winding up at Canton and
leaving through Hong Kong.
