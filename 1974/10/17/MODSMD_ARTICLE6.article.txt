# Chem Dept. Gets Grant For Building
## 
### 
The Seely G. Mudd Fund of Los
Angeles has donated $2.5 million
toward construction of a new
chemistry building here, it was
announced yesterday.
The new structure, expected to cost
$9 million, will be named the Seely G. /
Mudd Chemistry Building. Mudd was a
student here for two years and served
as a member of the Board of Trustees
from 1946 to 1954.
Under the terms of his will, the
trustees of the Mudd Fund have
expended $22 million toward the cost
of 15 buildings at colleges and
universities around the country.
During his lifetime, Mudd himself
donated more than $8 million for
professorships, scholarships and
buildings here and elsewhere.
The University plans to house its
entire undergraduate chemistry
program as well as some of its graduate
activity in the building. Undergraduate
course enrollments in chemistry have
nearly doubled in the last five years.
A structure to replace the current
70-year-old chemistry building is one
of the goals of the $3OO million
Campaign for Stanford, which began
in April 1972. Earlier in the Campaign,
Syntex (U.S.A.) committed $1 million
toward construction of the new
chemistry facility.
"The generous grant from the
Mudd Fund takes us a long step closer
to a much needed new home for
chemistry," President Richard Lyman
said. "We look forward to housing one
of Stanford's truly distinguished
departments in facilities appropriate to
its faculty and students."
The structure will contain 16
teaching laboratories, each designed to
permit close supervision and individual
instruction for 18 undergraduates. It
will also house laboratories and
instrument rooms for 70 graduate
students, plus faculty offices, lecture
halls, classrooms and a lounge.
Approximately half the freshman
class now enrolls in chemistry.
Laboratory facilities are strained to
their utmost to accommodate them, a
University spokesman said yesterday.
