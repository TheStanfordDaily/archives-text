# Egalitarian Marriages Can Succeed, Bems Say
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
Sandra and Daryl Bern told a group
of women last night that after nine
years as a married couple with
individual careers, they still believe
"sex roles are not God-given."
The Bems. both psychology
professors, explained they decided to
have an egalitarian marriage because
traditional sex roles would have cut
short Sandra's promising career.
"It's something that really isn't
strange today," she said. But nine
years ago when they married, "people
thought we were peculiar."
Daryl emphasized that no
relationship, except perhaps marriage
for a male in the traditional
male-female relationship, can survive if
a career takes priority over everything
else. The Bems' original intent in
approaching egalitarianism was to
balance their career goals, he said.
Flexible Identities
Sandra warned, "There is
something potentially narrowing about
a career role, just as there is something
narrowing about a housewife role."
The focus of the women's
movement should be to make personal
identities more flexible, not to
"masculinize" everyone into the roles
now demanded of men, she said.
Despite warnings that an egalitarian
relationship would not work for a
couple with children, the Bems said
they have been parents for seven
months without any sex role
complications.
They have set up a cooperative
system to share responsibility for their
daughter, Emily.
Babies are "fantastic fun," Sandra
said, "But it's nice not to have to do it
all the time."
'Executive Parents'
Daryl said that they have developed
an "executive parent" system. The
actual diapering and feeding does not
take as much energy as being
responsible for getting the diapering
and feeding done, he explained.
So they alternate days as the
"responsible" parent, in order that
each of them has a chance to care for

the baby and a chance to play with
her, Sandra said. She enjoys her time
with Emily, both the care and the
play, probably because she does not
have to worry about her all the time,
she said.
Daryl and Sandra hire a woman to
care for Emily three days and two
mornings a week. This private
solution, Daryl admitted, is an
"elitist" approach, which they can
afford because they are both
professors here.
The real need, they said, is for
adequate day-care centers, so that
wives in lower-income families can be
relieved of full-time child care.

CAREER COUPLEâ€”Sandra and Daryl Bern attribute their flourishing individual
careers as Stanford psychology professors to nine years of "egalitarian"
marriage. The couple discussed their marriage last night at a meeting sponsored
by the Women's Center.
