I would like to reply briefly to
Linda Morales' charge of bias
(Daily, Oct. 15) in my review of
the Joan Baez concert.
I have personally supported the
United Farm Workers throughout
the past eight years. However, it is
out of the question to give "full
coverage" of the farm workers
issue within the context of what is
essentially an objective review of
an entertainment event.
I find the charge that I
mentioned oppression in
Argentina because it was an issue
far removed from Stanford and
therefore safe to discuss
absolutely ridiculous. Indeed, the
"issue of stoop labor and poor
wages" at home is important, but
I thirk most people in this
community arc fully aware of that
issue.
However, far worse oppression
than you can imagine is going on
in Argentina and Brazil, and I
found it significant that Baez
talked at length about her
experiences in South America.
The illusion that oppression only
exists here in California, or that
corporate exploitation in the
United States isn't also occuring
in dependent coutries worldwide
is a myth that sorely needs
exploding.

To help alleviate the housing
shortage last year, the housing

office decided to stuff some
triples in Branner (among others)
with four students. After
sufficient protest by those
affected and a thorough
investigation (with accompanying
delay) by Horton's Heroes, a
refund on housing cost was
justifiably granted, satisfying
everyone.
Come 1974 and, lo and behold,
a few rooms in Branner are still
being stuffed. One would think
that the refund would be
automatic. Yet "according to a
spokesman for" Sue Espinosa in
the housing office (as they say) no
refund has been offered!
To those being crammed into
triples this year, a precedent was
set last year, and if you're willing
to fight the bureaucracy and
stubborness of Horton's Heroes,
you could pick up some extra
bucks.
And to our usually efficient
and equitable housing office (or
whomever they deem it necessary
to pass the buck to), tsk, tsk, tsk.

conservation (Daily, Oct. 2) why
are there no recycling efforts
coming from his office and why
doesn't he replace all the metal

issue.
However, far worse oppression
than you can imagine is going on
in Argentina and Brazil, and I
found it significant that Baez
talked at length about her
experiences in South America.
The illusion that oppression only
exists here in California, or that
corporate exploitation in the
United States isn't also occuring
in dependent coutries worldwide
is a myth that sorely needs
exploding.

To help alleviate the housing
shortage last year, the housing

office decided to stuff some
triples in Branner (among others)
with four students. After
sufficient protest by those
affected and a thorough
investigation (with accompanying
delay) by Horton's Heroes, a
refund on housing cost was
justifiably granted, satisfying
everyone.
Come 1974 and, lo and behold,
a few rooms in Branner are still
being stuffed. One would think
that the refund would be
automatic. Yet "according to a
spokesman for" Sue Espinosa in
the housing office (as they say) no
refund has been offered!
To those being crammed into
triples this year, a precedent was
set last year, and if you're willing
to fight the bureaucracy and
stubborness of Horton's Heroes,
you could pick up some extra
bucks.
And to our usually efficient
and equitable housing office (or
whomever they deem it necessary
to pass the buck to), tsk, tsk, tsk.

If Dan DeYoung is so
concerned with energy
conservation (Daily, Oct. 2) why
are there no recycling efforts
coming from his office and why
doesn't he replace all the metal
cans in the vendor machines with
glass bottles?

Reply On Baez

I would like to reply briefly to
Linda Morales' charge of bias
(Daily, Oct. 15) in my review of
the Joan Baez concert.
I have personally supported the
United Farm Workers throughout
the past eight years. However, it is
out of the question to give "full
coverage" of the farm workers
issue within the context of what is
essentially an objective review of
an entertainment event.
I find the charge that I
mentioned oppression in
Argentina because it was an issue
far removed from Stanford and
therefore safe to discuss
absolutely ridiculous. Indeed, the
"issue of stoop labor and poor
wages" at home is important, but
I thirk most people in this
community arc fully aware of that
issue.
