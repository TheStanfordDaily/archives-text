# State Of Fear
## 
### Gloria Goodale 
This column relates to the
murder and possible rape of Arlis
Perry last weekend. Although I
realize that the less said, the more
quickly the pain will heal, I do
feel the need to say something.
My response Monday morning,
one shared by many males and
females with whom I spoke, was
that of being shocked out of an
average ability to phase out world
atrocities. This happened on our
campus, in our church, to the wife
of a young member of our
community. We have to see the
real significance and mental threat
of this action. Its significance lies
in the fact that it would happen,
here, in Memorial Church, and the
mental threat is to the women and
men on campus.
The recent, widely publicized
case of Inez Garcia (a 30-year-old
Chicano woman who killed the
man who she says helped to rape
her) and the less publicized
immediately subsequent case of a
17-year-old girl who did the same,
are examples of women who did
not buckle to the pressure to let
rape continue unrecognized.
It is incredible to me that rape
exists today as such a part of our
society as it does. It is known that
the vast majority of rapes are
never even reported as opposed to
almost every other sort of crime,
and of those that are, very few are
ever resolved.
Different Situation
The publicity received in the
two previously mentioned cases
Was due to a subsequent murder,
not to the secondary fact of rape.
In many murder cases of females,
the fact of sexual molestation is a
story byline. Rape and the
significance of its lack of
recognition is extremely
important.

Rape constitutes the grossest
form of attack possible upon a
woman. It is an embodiment of
some of the basic sicknesses which
threaten peaceful coexistence.
Brutal aggression, physical and
mental coercion, patriarchal and
perverse self assertion. To all of
which murder and condonement
of war as a means to an end, are,
not surprisingly, concomitant.
It is a shock to have all this
take place not only on campus
but in church. I have spent not
only quiet meditative hours, but
have also danced in and created in
Memorial Church. Now, there is a
very real possibility of fear of
being alone, of being in church, of
walking at night at all. And I
refuse to accept this.
Hatred and fear are very
closely related and the specific
hatred of rape cannot be denied.
It is hatred of woman. And for
women to accept fear means
acceptance of the hatred of
woman implicit in a society that
would quasi condone rape by
glorification of the values it
embodies and vilification of what
it attacks, woman. I will not
accept the self hatred and fear for
myself imposed by that warlike
society.
Fear only self propogates and
that fear would further cripple the
spiritual state of both women and
men. That is not to say that I will
not be watchful or careful. I will.
But in the light of this horrible
denial of both woman and life, I
want to affirm not only for
myself, but for Bruce Perry and
the whole community affected,
our value for life, woman and
man.
