AKADAMA MAMA ASKS,
PLACE A FACE ON THE PUMPKIN
OR WHATEVER.
Been getting some heavy mail lately SAI
and since it merits a personal answer Re<
rather than a media one this is a good fro.
opportunity to have a kinda soft, low key ice
multi-contest. Next to a down nome holi- PL
day turkey stuffing or a live Christmas grs
tree decorated without any store bought bol
glop, I've always enjoyed the wherewithal am
of creativity that goes into a Halloween m
pumpkin. So if you place a face on the
little pumpkin to your right, I'll have a
sculptor friend pick out a few of her favor
ites and sculpt them up. Then if I can
borrow a decent camera I'll send the lucky
few some choice shots of their sculpted
pumpkin and statuesque sculptor.
There will also be small
but well thought out prizes for:
1. Give me another word for |^|
overly competitive a word J|JJi I j
to use in this frail world we I|H . |h]W
2. Does laughter travel Jjlj L
faster than the speed of M kf fo/m ill
sound? (In as few words m

3. The shortest list of bev- PLUM
erages that really don t | «

And in closing, to
paythe bills here are a
couple of prize Akadama
