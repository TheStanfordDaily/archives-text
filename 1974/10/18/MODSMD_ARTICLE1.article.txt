# McCloskey, Gillmor Debate Immediate National Issues
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Amnesty, congressional
reorganization and national health
insurance emerged last night as the
major issues in the debate here
between Rep. Paul N. McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) and Santa Clara Mayor
Gary Gillmor, congressional
candidates.
The two are vying for the seat in
the 12th District, which inqludes
Stanford.
Speaking at Annenberg Auditorium
to an audience of about 150 students,
McCloskey defended his seven-year
record in Congress and pleaded for the
opportunity to grapple with
congressional reform in the next
Congress.
Gillmor noted his accomplishments
as mayor and called for an expansion
of federal social welfare programs.
'Appalled And Amazed'
Declaring himself "appalled and
amazed at Ford's middle class plan"
for fighting inflation, Gillmor claimed
that only radical tax reform, a national
food policy and a crack-down on
corporate profits can "meet the needs
of real human beings."
McCloskey countered Gillmor's
contentions by stating that nothing
can be done about inflation until
Congress makes itself an effective
instrument for opposing conservative
executive policies.
McCloskey spoke of the need to
end the congressional seniority system,
claiming elderly Democratic
committee chairmen have effectively
delayed action on energy, tax reform
and health reform.
Gillmor agreed that the seniority
system should be abandoned, but said
since the Democrats will probably
control the next Congress, "new blood
in the Democratic aisle "would be a
more effective means of achieving the
reform."

"Baloney"
Gillmor and McCloskey differed
sharply on the issue of the balanced
budget. Gillmor called the balanced
budget "old baloney that won't put
food on the table," while McCloskey

stated that when Congress
overspends, "it abdicates its power to
control priorities and the President can
cut the budget wherever he pleases."
McCloskey and Gillmor also
disagreed about amnesty. Gillmor said
he supports conditional amnesty
because "it isn't asking too much to
have people work for their country for
a few years" when other men have
died for it.
But McCloskey said he supports
total amnesty since the nation
"shouldn't treat young people more
harshly than it has treated its leading
citizens [Nixon and Agnew] who in my
opinion committed much worse
offenses."
Gillmor attacked McCloskey's
support of the Ford Administration,
noting that Ford opposed civil rights,
minimum wages and public works
during his years in congress and is
implementing a similarly conservative
philosophy as President.

McCloskey said he disagrees with
Ford on amnesty, the Nixon pardon
and the surtax. But he defended Ford
as a "completely honest man" who
can be persuaded to liberalize his
policies.
Gillmor's weakest moment in the
debate came when McCloskey noted
that Gillmor had supported the federal
loan to the Lockheed Corporation.
McCloskey voted against the measure
despite the presence of thousands of
Lockheed employees in the district.
Gillmor was unable to answer
McCloskey's statement except to
admit that he supported the Lockheed
loan.
Gillmor scored his strongest point
against McCloskey when he pointed
out that despite his outspoken
advocacy of women's rights,
McCloskey voted against the Equal
Rights Amendment. McCloskey did
not respond to Gillmor's remark.

Gillmor in a debate staged last night in Annenberg Auditorium. The two are running for the 12th Congressional District
seat to be decided next month.
The candidates also disagreed about
abortion. McCloskey said he favors
legalized abortion while Gillmor said
he would favor a constitutional
amendment to allow the states to
decide their own abortion policies.
McCloskey spoke of his experience
during his four terms in Congress and
reminded the audience that he was an
early opponent of the Vietnamese war
and an early advocate of Nixon's
impeachment.
Gillmor stressed his 10 years in
Santa Clara politics, claiming that he
has extended the park system,
educational facilities and senior citizen
programs.
