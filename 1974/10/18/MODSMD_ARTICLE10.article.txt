# Civil Liberties Still Endangered

### Bruce Amundson 
Everyone knows about the biggest
bungled burglary in the history of this
nation. That of course is Watergate. However,
few Americans are aware of the nearly 100
other break-ins which the Nixon
administration may have had a hand in which
remain unsolved.
While these break-ins are linked to Nixon
only through circumstantial evidence, they
appear to have taken place under the Huston
Plan which amalgamated the FBI, the CIA,
the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency), the
NSA (national Security Agency) and the
counter-intelligence agencies of the Army,
Navy and Air Force. Under the plan these
agencies, some of which are prohibited by
law from participation in domestic
intelligence collection, were used to gather
information on individuals and organizations
considered to be enemies of the Nixon
administration.
The suspicious thing about all of these
break-ins is that no money or material items
were ever taken. Only files that could be used
against people were opened or missing. Nor
was there any attempt to hide the fact that
an office or home had been broken into.
Some of these unsolved mysteries include:
—The break-in of Humberto
Diaz-Casanueva's apartment. Diaz-Casanueva

was the wife of the new Chilean ambassador
to the United Nations and discovered that
her husband's papers mostly poems had
been examined in the burglary. Nothing was
thought about the break-in until a week later
when Javier Urrutia, chief of the Chilean
Development Corporation, discovered his
official papers had been rifled during a
weekend break-in at his apartment. He and
Diaz-Casanueva had been partners in
negotiations with the U.S. government and
businessmen abut the Allende government's
takeover of U.S.-owned businesses in Chile.
—The breaking into of the Chilean
Embassy where drawers were forced open
and papers dealing with Chile's military
purchases were examined. Also, the homes of
several Chilean officials were broken into
about the same time.
The burglaries of the homes and offices of
Chilean officials is particularly disturbing
considering the questioned involvement of
the CIA in that country prior to Allende's
downfall. A memorandum from General
Vernon Walters, deputy director of the CIA,
seems to tie these domestic operations to the
ClA's involvement in Chile. Walters, in his
"Memorandum for Record" dated June 28,
1972, states "He (Dean) believed that Barker
had been involved in a clandestine entry into
the Chilean embassy."

What leads one to suspect that these were
not simply pranks or harassment is that the
break-ins dealt with such important people
and occurred at key times. The involvement
into the affairs of Chilean officials is
disturbing enough. But when people such as
Lefcourt, Dan Rather and Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist are burglarized, then we are close
to having our very own SS or KGB.
And the American people will never know
the answer to who was behind these break-ins
because those who could do something about
them are either too lazy or scared to do so.
Of course, President Ford's pardoning of
Richard Nixon didn't help things either since
it wouldn't do much good to prosecute
someone when the leader is allowed to go
free.
Nor are we completely free from future
break-ins. The Huston Plan was never
officially ended although everyone agrees it is
highly illegal. President Ford could very
easily use a similar plan, especially with
everyone letting down their guard because
Nixon is out of the White House.
The cost of freedom is truly eternal
vigilance.

Everyone knows about the biggest
bungled burglary in the history of this
nation. That of course is Watergate. However,
few Americans are aware of the nearly 100
other break-ins which the Nixon
administration may have had a hand in which
remain unsolved.
While these break-ins are linked to Nixon
only through circumstantial evidence, they
appear to have taken place under the Huston
Plan which amalgamated the FBI, the CIA,
the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency), the
NSA (national Security Agency) and the
counter-intelligence agencies of the Army,
Navy and Air Force. Under the plan these
agencies, some of which are prohibited by
law from participation in domestic
intelligence collection, were used to gather
information on individuals and organizations
considered to be enemies of the Nixon
administration.
The suspicious thing about all of these
break-ins is that no money or material items
were ever taken. Only files that could be used
against people were opened or missing. Nor
was there any attempt to hide the fact that
an office or home had been broken into.
Some of these unsolved mysteries include:
—The break-in of Humberto
Diaz-Casanueva's apartment. Diaz-Casanueva

was the wife of the new Chilean ambassador
to the United Nations and discovered that
her husband's papers mostly poems had
been examined in the burglary. Nothing was
thought about the break-in until a week later
when Javier Urrutia, chief of the Chilean
Development Corporation, discovered his
official papers had been rifled during a
weekend break-in at his apartment. He and
Diaz-Casanueva had been partners in
negotiations with the U.S. government and
businessmen abut the Allende government's
takeover of U.S.-owned businesses in Chile.
—The breaking into of the Chilean
Embassy where drawers were forced open
and papers dealing with Chile's military
purchases were examined. Also, the homes of
several Chilean officials were broken into
about the same time.
The burglaries of the homes and offices of
Chilean officials is particularly disturbing
considering the questioned involvement of
the CIA in that country prior to Allende's
downfall. A memorandum from General
Vernon Walters, deputy director of the CIA,
seems to tie these domestic operations to the
ClA's involvement in Chile. Walters, in his
"Memorandum for Record" dated June 28,
1972, states "He (Dean) believed that Barker
had been involved in a clandestine entry into
the Chilean embassy."

What leads one to suspect that these were
not simply pranks or harassment is that the
break-ins dealt with such important people
and occurred at key times. The involvement
into the affairs of Chilean officials is
disturbing enough. But when people such as
Lefcourt, Dan Rather and Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist are burglarized, then we are close
to having our very own SS or KGB.
And the American people will never know
the answer to who was behind these break-ins
because those who could do something about
them are either too lazy or scared to do so.
Of course, President Ford's pardoning of
Richard Nixon didn't help things either since
it wouldn't do much good to prosecute
someone when the leader is allowed to go
free.
Nor are we completely free from future
break-ins. The Huston Plan was never
officially ended although everyone agrees it is
highly illegal. President Ford could very
easily use a similar plan, especially with
everyone letting down their guard because
Nixon is out of the White House.
The cost of freedom is truly eternal
vigilance.
