# Christiansen A 'Player's Coach'
## 
### Gory Cavalli 
Mark Paul's column, "Football
Fortunes Decline," in
Wednesday's Daily showed little
knowledge or understanding of
Stanford football.
Perhaps the most ill-conceived
part of the column was the
section portraying Stanford's
coaches as ogres who bully the
players and criticize them for
spending any time on their
studies. Paul claims their goal is to
turn Stanford into a "miniature
USC," that "the manner of the
coaches is domineering and the
tone abusive" and that there is a
"distrust of and a remoteness
from the athletes, particularly
those who do not fit the
stereotype of the 'jock.' "
Without getting into a
point-by-point rebuttal of these
and other charges, the best way to
refute these claims is to simply let
Stanford's football players
comment.
Stanford All-American
defensive end Pat Donovan, a B+
student in mechanical engineering,
says:
A 'Player's Coach'
"Coach Christiansen is a
player's coach who would never
brow-beat the team for personal
status. Everything he wants is for
the players. He looks at football
as something that makes boys into
men, so he wants his staff to
motivate rather than coerce. It's
important to Coach Chris for us
to enjoy what we're doing.
"People here respect you for
being a person," Pat goes on.
"Football and school at Stanford
are closely knit. In both, there is a
lot of freedom. You don't have to
be the norm or meet a standard.
You can excel. Students and
athletes alike are giver,
responsibility, assuming they can
handle it. I'm just as happy when
a friend of mine'makes Phi Beta
Kappa as my friends were when I
made All-American."
Star safety Doc Blanchard is
another who doesn't fit the jock
stereotype.
"You can't be scared of
contact, but if hitting is your

purpose, it's got to get old, even
to the most aggressive players. All
of us at Stanford hate to see
anybody get hurt, but it's just a
necessary evil. Actually, in the
business world you see people out
to hurt opponents more than you
do on a football field.
World Won't End
"I know the world isn't over
because we lose a game," Doc
says. "That belief doesn't take
away from my desire to win or
from the intensity of my play. In
fact it helps. You have to be
thankful you have the ability to
play at all."
Secondary coach George
Seifert says of the same
Blanchard: "He's the type of guy
I'd like to have my boy grow up
to be, and that's the highest
compliment you can pay
anyone."
Doug Single, a player on John
Ralson's 1972 Rose Bowl team
and now head JV coach at
Stanford, has been a part of
football here for several years.
"Chris gives the game back to
the kids and puts football in the
proper perspective," Single says.
"It's not a life or death situation.
All the assistant coaches here
realize that the players come first
at all times. This is brought out in
their recruiting as well as their
coaching."
Game Not Everything
Rather than preach "football is
everything," as Paul claims in his
column, the Stanford coaches
permitted star linebacker Forrie
Martin to miss most of spring
practice this year to attend his
pre-med labs. Every spring, at
least a half dozen players miss
spring ball because of overseas
study. Few, if any other, football
programs encourage academic
pursuits to the extent Stanford
does.
Communication between the
players and coaches has been
further facilitated this year by the
formation of a Stanford Football
Council, comprised of Coach
Christiansen and one player
representative from each position

on the team.
"It's a positive, mature
approach to handling situations
such as curfew and dress code,"
Christiansen says. "Actually, all
the suggestions the council has
made have been very positive."
Stanford no longer has bed
checks and curfews for the
football team, as it did in the
Ralston era. The result is self
discipline, according to equipment
man Doc Marvin, who is probably
closer to the Stanford players
than anyone.
Sneaking Out 'Fun'
"When Coach Ralston used to
run bed checks, a lot of players
would sneak out afterwards
because it was fun," Doc says.
"Now there aren't any bed
checks, and the players don't
sneak out much anymore. It's no
fun, because they're not breaking
any rules."
A few other inaccuracies in
Paul's column should be pointed
out. He claims Stanford
quarterbacks "practice the entire
week with only the most
rudimentary idea of what the
game plan will be." This is
ludicrous. In fact, at least two and
sometimes all three varsity
quarterbacks are intensely
involved in game plan
preparations all week.

Arm-chair quarterbacks
frequently criticize coaches for
not sticking with a player and
making a change too quickly. In
this instance, Paul complains that
the Stanford coaches have not
replaced punter Tom Lynn. Yet
Lynn's punting has improved in
the past two games. At UCLA, the
"hang time" on his punts
improved so much that UCLA had
minus yardage on its punt returns
for the game.
But aside from the
inaccuracies, the most glaring
problem of Paul's article was the
self-contradiction. For all the
pronouncements about
"questioning the value of big time
collegiate sports," the simple fact
remains that the column would
never have been written if
Stanford had a winning record
this year. Despite one of the most
brutal schedules in the country, it
still may.
