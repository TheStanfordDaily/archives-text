# Vote Yes On 17
## 
### Yeuell, Gordon 
The editorial "No on
Proposition 17," which appeared
in Sunday's San Francisco
Chronicle, reflects a distressing
attitude in its application not only
to the Stanislaus River issue, but
also to the future exploitation of
natural resources.
The editorial argued ostensibly
that a "no" vote on Proposition
17, the Save-The-River
proposition on November's ballot,
will be a "positive expression of
support" for a new flat-water
recreation site and a "vast increase
of hydroelectric power."
Special interest groups,
according to the editorial, are
sponsoring the opposition to the
construction of the New Melones
Dam.
This simplistic,
anthropocentric point of view
argues that this is a question of
which special interest groups
should be supported—Whitewater
enthusiasts or dam-building fund
recipients.
Tries To Separate
The editorial attempts to
separate the idea of "saving the
river" from opposing the New
Melones Dam. In the editorial,
"saving the river" actually means
converting it to a flat-water
reservoir for "powerboating,
swimming and fishing."
Presently, there are 11
major flat-water recreational
reservoirs within 30 miles of
the proposed New Melones site.
The reservoir of the New Don
Pedro Dam, which is only seven
miles from the site of the New
Melones reservoir, is comparable
in size to the proposed reservoir.
In their fact sheets, the Army
Corps of Engineers projects four
million visitor days (one visitor
times one day equals one visitor
day) a year for the proposed
reservoir. But, according to a
correspondence from the
recreational director of the New
Don Pedro project to the Friends
of the River, the New Don Pedro
reservoir registered only 242,000
visitor days for the fiscal year of
1974. In other words, the Don
Pedro reservoir, only seven miles
away, is far from realizing its
recreatiorial potential.
Policy Needs Examination
The policy of damming
white-water rivers for
Hydroelectric power needs to be
examined in a long-term
perspective. Recently, two-thirds
of the federal dam projects in the
state of California were
abandoned by their sponsors.
Unfortunately, the New Melones
was not among them.
The enormous costs involved in
a single hydroelectric project like
the New Melones Dam (projected
by the Corps to be over $250
million) represent far more than
that appropriated by Congress
during the fiscal year of 1974 for
the development of new energy
sources.
Yet it is clear that these
alternate sources solar,
geothermal, ocean thermal
gradient and tidal represent
more realistic solutions to the
future's energy needs than does
one dam which will be silted-up
and essentially useless within one
hundred years.
In an era in which we have seen
pictures of the earth taken by
astronauts, we have come to
realize that the fate of this planet
is more and more in our hands.
It took billions of years to
"build" the Stanislaus River. The
delicate riparian ecology has
played its quiet drama for
hundreds of millions of years. The
New Melones Dam will inundate
all of this for less than one
hundred years' use.
We recommend a "Yes" vote
on Proposition 17.

Melones reservoir, is comparable
in size to the proposed reservoir.
In their fact sheets, the Army
Corps of Engineers projects four
million visitor days (one visitor
times one day equals one visitor
day) a year for the proposed
reservoir. But, according to a
correspondence from the
recreational director of the New
Don Pedro project to the Friends
of the River, the New Don Pedro
reservoir registered only 242,000
visitor days for the fiscal year of
1974. In other words, the Don
Pedro reservoir, only seven miles
away, is far from realizing its
recreatiorial potential.
Policy Needs Examination
The policy of damming
white-water rivers for
Hydroelectric power needs to be
examined in a long-term
perspective. Recently, two-thirds
of the federal dam projects in the
state of California were
abandoned by their sponsors.
Unfortunately, the New Melones
was not among them.
The enormous costs involved in
a single hydroelectric project like
the New Melones Dam (projected
by the Corps to be over $250
million) represent far more than
that appropriated by Congress
during the fiscal year of 1974 for
the development of new energy
sources.
Yet it is clear that these
alternate sources solar,
geothermal, ocean thermal
gradient and tidal represent
more realistic solutions to the
future's energy needs than does
one dam which will be silted-up
and essentially useless within one
hundred years.
In an era in which we have seen
pictures of the earth taken by
astronauts, we have come to
realize that the fate of this planet
is more and more in our hands.
It took billions of years to
"build" the Stanislaus River. The
delicate riparian ecology has
played its quiet drama for
hundreds of millions of years. The
New Melones Dam will inundate
all of this for less than one
hundred years' use.
We recommend a "Yes" vote
on Proposition 17.
(D. Paul Yeuell and Shelly S.
Gordon are undergraduates.)
The editorial "No on
Proposition 17," which appeared
in Sunday's San Francisco
Chronicle, reflects a distressing
attitude in its application not only
to the Stanislaus River issue, but
also to the future exploitation of
natural resources.
The editorial argued ostensibly
that a "no" vote on Proposition
17, the Save-The-River
proposition on November's ballot,
will be a "positive expression of
support" for a new flat-water
recreation site and a "vast increase
of hydroelectric power."
Special interest groups,
according to the editorial, are
sponsoring the opposition to the
construction of the New Melones
Dam.
This simplistic,
anthropocentric point of view
argues that this is a question of
which special interest groups
should be supported—Whitewater
enthusiasts or dam-building fund
recipients.
Tries To Separate
The editorial attempts to
separate the idea of "saving the
river" from opposing the New
Melones Dam. In the editorial,
"saving the river" actually means
converting it to a flat-water
reservoir for "powerboating,
swimming and fishing."
Presently, there are 11
major flat-water recreational
reservoirs within 30 miles of
the proposed New Melones site.
The reservoir of the New Don
Pedro Dam, which is only seven
miles from the site of the New
Melones reservoir, is comparable
in size to the proposed reservoir.
In their fact sheets, the Army
Corps of Engineers projects four
million visitor days (one visitor
times one day equals one visitor
