# Perry Murder: The Scene Is Frighteningly Families
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The scenario was becoming tragically,
frighteningly familiar. For the fourth time in
less than two years, police were faced with a
murder at Stanford.
To be sure, the latest tragedy didn't
resemble the previous three in several key
respects. But there were similarities: a person
out alone, a sudden killer, police without
suspects.
This time, the victim was Arlis Perry, 19,
the newlywed wife of a sophomore premed.
Her half-nude body was discovered Sunday
morning by a security guard in Memorial
Church, where she had gone to meditate
shortly before midnight Saturday night.
A coroner's report said she had been
stabbed in the back of the head, sexually
molested and possibly strangled.
Psychopathic
Investigators say they think the killing was
the work of a sexual psychopath, and though

they have no suspects yet, they're not ready
to place the Perry murder in the "unsolved"
category along with the earlier campus
murders of Leslie Perlov, David Levine and
Janet Taylor.
•Santa Clara County Sheriff's Capt. Frank
Mosunic, chief of detectives, said he's hopeful
that once physical evidence in the case is
analyzed at the FBI labs in Washington,
investigators will have the clues they need to
track down the assailant. "That physical
evidence is the key to the case," he said.
To be sure, though, the investigators are
continuing to analyze bits and pieces of
information from people in or near the church
between 11:30 p.m. Saturday, when Perry
went to the church, and 5:45 a.m. Sunday,
when her body was found.
Both Inside Church
That process hasn't been easy. Right now,
the police think that both Perry and the killer
were inside the church when a security guard
closed and locked it at about 11:45 p.m.
Saturday. The coroner placed Perry's death at
between midnight and 12:30.
At about 3 a.m., Perry's husband Bruce
who has been flatly ruled out as a suspect
called police to report her missing. The guard
checked all church doors, according to
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington, and
found them all locked—but at 5:45, he found
one of the previously locked doors unlocked
and ajar.
That could indicate, said Capt. Mosunic,
that the killer remained in the church for
more than three hours after killing Perry.
Whether that's true, and if so why, the police
can't say.
Media reaction to the tragedy was swift,
overblown and often erroneous. To be sure,

the Daily's first story on the killing \
criticized by some for an allegedly
specific" description of Perry's body (editors
replied that it was better to print all the facts
to defuse any possible speculation
from more vague reports). J .
Major Offenders
But far and away, area television stations
and a couple of newspapers were the major
offenders.
One source of confusion was a wire service ;
report quoting Dean of the Chapel Robert 1
G.H. Kelly as calling the murder "ritualistic I
and satanic." That quote, which supposedly
came second-hand from a radio reporter, was
fueled by police reluctance at first to rule out
any theory.
Contacted later, Kelly denied he ever made
the remark but the denial didn't receive
nearly the circulation the original quote did,
and it took some news organizations several
days to correct their stories.
Similarly, several organizations reported
that Perry had been tortured, although there
was no sign of a struggle and police now think
she was killed quickly.
"Torture Slaying In Campus Chapel,"
screamed the Palo Alto Times, while the San
Jose Mercury chimed in with "Victim
Tortured Young Wife's Body Found In
Church." KGO-TV's Channel Seven News
Scene reported the killing Sunday night with
the single word "TORTURE" superimposed
on the screen above the anchorman's head.
But the faulty coverage could not detract
from the tragedy of the situation, nor from
the need to track down the killer. After four
unsolved homicides, Stanford is a decidedly
grimmer place than the country club most
students chose to attend.

came second-hand from a radio reporter, was
fueled by police reluctance at first to rule out
any theory.
Contacted later, Kelly denied he ever made
the remark but the denial didn't receive
nearly the circulation the original quote did,

days to correct their stories.
Similarly, several organizations reported
that Perry had been tortured, although there
was no sign of a struggle and police now think
she was killed quickly.
"Torture Slaying In Campus Chapel,"
screamed the Palo Alto Times, while the San
Jose Mercury chimed in with "Victim
Tortured Young Wife's Body Found In
Church." KGO-TV's Channel Seven News
Scene reported the killing Sunday night with
the single word "TORTURE" superimposed
on the screen above the anchorman's head.
But the faulty coverage could not detract
from the tragedy of the situation, nor from
the need to track down the killer. After four
unsolved homicides, Stanford is a decidedly
grimmer place than the country club most
students chose to attend.
The scenario was becoming tragically,
frighteningly familiar. For the fourth time in
less than two years, police were faced with a
murder at Stanford.
To be sure, the latest tragedy didn't
resemble the previous three in several key
respects. But there were similarities: a person
out alone, a sudden killer, police without
suspects.
This time, the victim was Arlis Perry, 19,
the newlywed wife of a sophomore premed.
Her half-nude body was discovered Sunday
morning by a security guard in Memorial
Church, where she had gone to meditate
shortly before midnight Saturday night.
A coroner's report said she had been
stabbed in the back of the head, sexually
molested and possibly strangled.
Psychopathic
Investigators say they think the killing was
the work of a sexual psychopath, and though

they have no suspects yet, they're not ready
to place the Perry murder in the "unsolved"
category along with the earlier campus
murders of Leslie Perlov, David Levine and
Janet Taylor.
•Santa Clara County Sheriff's Capt. Frank
Mosunic, chief of detectives, said he's hopeful
that once physical evidence in the case is
analyzed at the FBI labs in Washington,
investigators will have the clues they need to
track down the assailant. "That physical
evidence is the key to the case," he said.
To be sure, though, the investigators are
continuing to analyze bits and pieces of
information from people in or near the church
between 11:30 p.m. Saturday, when Perry
went to the church, and 5:45 a.m. Sunday,
when her body was found.
Both Inside Church
That process hasn't been easy. Right now,
the police think that both Perry and the killer
were inside the church when a security guard
closed and locked it at about 11:45 p.m.
Saturday. The coroner placed Perry's death at
between midnight and 12:30.
At about 3 a.m., Perry's husband Bruce
who has been flatly ruled out as a suspect
called police to report her missing. The guard
checked all church doors, according to
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington, and
found them all locked—but at 5:45, he found
one of the previously locked doors unlocked
and ajar.
That could indicate, said Capt. Mosunic,
that the killer remained in the church for
more than three hours after killing Perry.
Whether that's true, and if so why, the police
can't say.
Media reaction to the tragedy was swift,
overblown and often erroneous. To be sure,

the Daily's first story on the killing \
criticized by some for an allegedly
specific" description of Perry's body (editors
replied that it was better to print all the facts
to defuse any possible speculation
from more vague reports). J .
