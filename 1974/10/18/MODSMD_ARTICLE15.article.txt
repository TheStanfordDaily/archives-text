# Fraternity Questions Not Answered By Lyman's Response To Title IX
## 
### JOHN FREED 
When President Richard Lyman filed a
formal response this week to the Title IXanti
sex discrimination regulations suggested by
the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW), he left untouched a host of
questions on the future of Stanford's
fraternities.
Lyman specifically objected to a provision
of the proposed Title IX rules which would
permit single-sex dormitories to be operated
by the University, but would forbid
University assistance to independent
fraternities or sororities. James Siena, legal
adviser to Lyman, explained:
"[The proposal] permits single-sex
housing; it forbids Univesity 'assistance'
'assistance' undefined to groups which
discriminate on the basis of sex."
An HEW fact sheet accompanying the
proposed regulations lifted three modes of
illegal "assistance such groups. If the
University is caught providing any of the
three, it could lose all its federal money.
Three Modes
The three modes of "assistance" are:
—a group receiving "support" from the
University;
—a group receiving housing from the
University;
—a group operating "in connection with
the University's education program or
activity."
Larry Horton, associate dean of student
affairs for residential education, claimed the
fraternities receive all three types of
University aid and if they aren't cut off,
Stanford will lose its federal funding.
"There's no doubt in my mind that the
fraternity system meets all three standards,"
Horton said.
Lyman's Tuesday letter to HEW did not

address itself to current discussions between
the University and the fraternities. However,
Horton remarked that the nature of the
discussions would be unchanged by Lyman's
letter.
In his meetings with frats, Horton says he
has tried to clarify a "subtle distinction"
between two different parts of Title IX.
Briefly stated, the sections would say:
. —first, that single-sex dormitories are
permitted, but fraternities and sororities are
not. This is the section Lyman and others
have objected to, saying that the regulation
removes freedom of choice on the part of
students.
—that roughly the same amounts and types
of housing must be available for men and
women, in proportion to their numbers on
campus. This section of the regulations has
been supported by policy statements of the
Trustees forbidding discrimination by sex.
Discussions
It is to this second point that discussions
between the University and the fraternities
have been directed.
Lyman summarized the different aspects of
the situation in his letter to HEW.
"We believe that student living groups
should be allowed to choose to be single-sex
so long as the quantity and quality of housing
available to each sex is proportionate,"
Lyman wrote.
Michael Nilsson, president of the
Inter-Fraternity Council, was optimistic that
the language of Lyman's letter may change
the tone of the University's continuing
dialogue with the fraternities.
"I think Larry [Horton] has realized there
is more to the situation than he thought,"
Nilsson commented. "I think he's beginning
to realize that there are ' far-reaching
consequences to changing the present

fraternity system."
But ever since last January, when Alpha Sig
started the whole ball rolling by proposing a
coed draw-exempt fraternity, Horton has
maintained that the frat system cannot
continue in its existing form.
"The status quo is contrary both to
University policy and to the law of the land,"
Horton said. "It cannot continue unchanged."

—that roughly the same amounts and types
of housing must be available for men and
women, in proportion to their numbers on
campus. This section of the regulations has
been supported by policy statements of the
Trustees forbidding discrimination by sex.
Discussions
It is to this second point that discussions
between the University and the fraternities
have been directed.
Lyman summarized the different aspects of
the situation in his letter to HEW.
"We believe that student living groups
should be allowed to choose to be single-sex
so long as the quantity and quality of housing
available to each sex is proportionate,"
Lyman wrote.
Michael Nilsson, president of the
Inter-Fraternity Council, was optimistic that
the language of Lyman's letter may change
the tone of the University's continuing
dialogue with the fraternities.
"I think Larry [Horton] has realized there
is more to the situation than he thought,"
Nilsson commented. "I think he's beginning
to realize that there are ' far-reaching
consequences to changing the present

fraternity system."
But ever since last January, when Alpha Sig
started the whole ball rolling by proposing a
coed draw-exempt fraternity, Horton has
maintained that the frat system cannot
continue in its existing form.
"The status quo is contrary both to
University policy and to the law of the land,"
Horton said. "It cannot continue unchanged."
When President Richard Lyman filed a
formal response this week to the Title IXanti
sex discrimination regulations suggested by
the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW), he left untouched a host of
questions on the future of Stanford's
fraternities.
Lyman specifically objected to a provision
of the proposed Title IX rules which would
permit single-sex dormitories to be operated
by the University, but would forbid
University assistance to independent
fraternities or sororities. James Siena, legal
adviser to Lyman, explained:
"[The proposal] permits single-sex
housing; it forbids Univesity 'assistance'
'assistance' undefined to groups which
discriminate on the basis of sex."
An HEW fact sheet accompanying the
proposed regulations lifted three modes of
illegal "assistance such groups. If the
University is caught providing any of the
three, it could lose all its federal money.
Three Modes
The three modes of "assistance" are:
—a group receiving "support" from the
University;
—a group receiving housing from the
University;
—a group operating "in connection with
the University's education program or
activity."
Larry Horton, associate dean of student
affairs for residential education, claimed the
fraternities receive all three types of
University aid and if they aren't cut off,
Stanford will lose its federal funding.
"There's no doubt in my mind that the
fraternity system meets all three standards,"
Horton said.
Lyman's Tuesday letter to HEW did not

address itself to current discussions between
the University and the fraternities. However,
Horton remarked that the nature of the
discussions would be unchanged by Lyman's
letter.
In his meetings with frats, Horton says he
has tried to clarify a "subtle distinction"
between two different parts of Title IX.
Briefly stated, the sections would say:
. —first, that single-sex dormitories are
permitted, but fraternities and sororities are
not. This is the section Lyman and others
have objected to, saying that the regulation
removes freedom of choice on the part of
students.

of housing must be available for men and
