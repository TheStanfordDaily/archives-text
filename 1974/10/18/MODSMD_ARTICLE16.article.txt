# Women And Faculty:
## Statististics Don't Tell The Story 
### BOB LOWE 
Stanford's newly appointed female
professors comprise only 12.2 percent of all
professors hired last year. That figure
compares poorly with the proportion of
women professors appointed in the two
previous years and with the 20 percent goal
set by the Faculty Senate last year.
But these statistics barely hint at the
complex bundle of conflicting moral, legal
and social issues surrounding the hiring of
female faculty.
Arthur Bienenstock, vice provost for
faculty affirmative action, points out that
while the latest percentage figure falls far
short of the Senate's ideal goal, it is in line
with the percentage of doctoral degrees
received by women.
Bienenstock estimated that based purely
on national percentages of advanced degrees
conferred on women, Stanford was expected
to hire 10.4 percent women professors. He
interprets the University's 12.2 percent figure
as evidence that departments aren't
discriminating on the basis of sex.

Furthermore, Bienenstock says that
departments are actively seeking women who
will make good professors. But in many cases,
especially in business and science oriented
fields, qualified women aren't available.
Not everyone is convinced that lack of
qualified women is the entire problem.
Academic Secretary Eric Hutchinson said
that some male bias probably still exists.
This is particularly true when the economy
is doing badly and people with advanced
degrees are unemployed, he added. In that
situation members of a department might
decide the man needs the job more than the
woman, Hutchinson said.
But scarcity of qualified women
undoubtedly plays a large role in the problem
of hiring more female professors. It also brings
together two conflicting pressures.
On one hand, much of the Stanford
community favors the appointment of more
female professors.
However, it appears that the only way to
dramatically boost the percentage of female

professors is through reverse discrimination, a
controversial policy which could raise legal
questions.
The University's proportion of female
professors to total professors is eight percent.
This seems low when considering the large and
increasing proportion of women
undergraduates here.
Most people agree a female professor will
enhance the environment and education at the
University, if she has the same qualifications
as a male rival.
Some people argue that if the
qualifications of two applicants a man and
woman are equivalent, the woman sho'
be selected. But applicants rarely ' '
identical qualifications. j
So the questions arise: What if the \
is slightly less qualified than the man'
she be selected because her sex ma., /0/B
more effective and enhances education ai yf
University? Upfeg. j/
Individual departments must gi â‚¬
