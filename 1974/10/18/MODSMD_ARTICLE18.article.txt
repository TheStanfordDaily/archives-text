Rod Stewart
Smiler

Mercury SRML-1017
Why is Rod Stewart grinning
about his first release in over two
years? Maybe he's just listened to
several of the better cuts on
Smiler. Another possibility is that
he's pondering the fact that his
fans still have to pay the full rate
for the rest of the album.
Rod's fifth solo effort is a
mixed bag. At his best he can pen
and sing a ballad with anyone in
the business. On the other hand,
as this most recent work proves,
he is quite capable of providing
mediocre renditions of inadequate
material. His instrumental support
varies albng the same range.
"Sweet Little Rock V Roller,"
which opens the first side, is not
impressive. There are few rock
acts that haven't recorded a
Chuck Berry standard. Rod is no
exception, and adds nothing new
here. His back-up musicians
follow this lead, proving they can
copy 50s licks as well as anybody.
"Let Me Be Your Car," an
Elton John/Bernie Taupin
composition is a bit better due to
the presence of the Memphis
Horns, a brass section that adds
class and punch to this well
performed, but simple and
derivative collection of double

entendre lyrics and repetitive
musical figures.
Elton, the Liberace of rock 'n'
roll, accompanies on piano and
shares the vocals. We'll rate it
high, because you can dance to it.
Thanks, Elton.
On his last album, Rod was
quite successful with Sam Cooke's
"Twisting the Night Away." He
attempts, in vain, to repeat that
triumph with a medley of two
more Cooke songs. He starts out
robustly enough with "Bring it on
Home" but, by the time he
reaches into "You Send Me" he
has been foiled by a string section
mixed up so strongly that one
cannot help noticing the clash
between Rod's gravel utterances
and the silky smooth violins.
Cooke's voice was perfect for this
sort of treatment. Stewart's is not.
From the same era as the above
comes "(You make me feel like) A
Natural Man," adapted from the
Goffin/King/Vexler classic. Rod is
strong here, singing with both
inspiration and delicacy. Again,
the Memphis Horns add to the
arrangement, with tasteful
support from the back-up band.
Especially noteworthy is Marty
Quittention's acoustic guitar
work.
Stewart struts through three of
his own compositions on Smiler.
"Farewell," "Sailor" and "Dixie
Toot" continue Rod's tradition of
verse filled with catchy one liners.
On "Dixie Toot," which is
concerned with "having a good
time," he proclaims "[l'll] wear a
skirt, be a flirt if I want." This
spirit is reinforced musically by a
New Orleans jazz ensemble.
The best of the three is

"Farewell," a ballad written in
collaboration with Quittenton,
who co-authored "Maggie May."
It tells the familiar tale of leaving
home for fame, fortune, and the
freedom of the road. Rod's
confident tone makes the tune
convincing.
The album's masterpiece is
"Mine for Me," a Paul McCartney
love song. Stewart glides through
this work with deftly calculated
portions of tenderness and
authority, turning from one to
another at the appropriate
moments, and at times
interpreting with both tones. He
paces himself perfectly
throughout, subtly easing the song
to its close. It is this level of
mastery that makes the man a
star. If only he could maintain
this height, Smiler would be an
album of the same stature.
For you fans of the
inconsequential, there are four
other cuts on the LP. Two are
instrumentals with a total playing
time of 2:02. A third is Dylan's
"A Girl From the North
Country," performed in a
lackluster manner. Johnny Cash
did it much better.
The fourth is a throw-away
rock, most notable for the fact
that everyone performing wants
to set down the rhythm, but no

one wants to carry the melody.
The back-up band referred to
throughout the review consists of
permutations of all the Faces but
Ronnie Lane, Mr. John, Chris
Barbers Jazz Band ("Dixie
Toot?'), the Memphis House and
all the folks who brought you his
previous four albums. Standing
out amont the latter are Pete
Sears (piano), Rick Gretch
(violin), Dick Powell (violin), and
Spike Heatly (bass).

Jorma Kaukonen
with Tom Hobson A

Quah „
Grunt Records BFL 1-0209
Jorma Kaukonen's guitar
playing days with Jefferson
Airplane and Hot Tuna are far
from over, but on Quah, his first
more or less solo album, he leaves
his stratocaster and cosmic
consciousness behind and picks
and sings some acoustic blues. If
your favorite song on Hot Tuna's
more recent album
Phosphorescent Rat, was "Sally,
Where'd You Get Your Liquor
From?," then this is the album for
you.

With the able assistance of
Tom Hobson, this non-electric
effort is altogether successful,
combining original folk/blues
tunes with traditional
arrangements in a very satisfying
collection. Kaukonen's voice,
laid-back and uncommercialized,

is the perfect complement to his
experienced guitar playing.
Quah's first side is
Kaukonen-heavy, but there is a
full dose of fun blues to offset his
sometimes over-serious lyrical
themes. Four cuts are distinctively
Kaukonen, lyrically and
instrumentally: "Genesis," "Song
For The North Star," "I'll Let
You Know Before I Leave" and
"Flying Clouds."
Side two kicks off with Rev.
Gary Davis' "I Am The Light Of
This World" and closes with the
lone Kaukonen song, "Hamar
Promenade," Tom Hobsone takes
vocals chores on two cuts, Gordon
Jenkin's "Blue Prelude" and his
own funny "Sweet Hawaiian
Sunshine" complete with
"tropical" dobro. Perhaps the best
song on the album is Blind Arthur
Blakes' "Police Dog Blues," a
straight-forward blues number
with hot guitar licks.
Quah is well-paced and plays
off the traditional arrangements
and more contemporary cuts
excellently. One good acoustic
blues guitarist in this world of
high-energy electronics is a relief,
two of them playing side by side
is great.
Whether blazing away with Hot
Tuna or alone on a bar-stool in a
San Francisco nightclub, Jorma
Kaukonen is a highly unsung
leader in the American
rock/blues music scene. But as
he sings in Rev. Gary Davis' "I'll
Be All Right:"

"If trouble comes,
I don't pay no mind,
I'll be all right someday.
Deep in my heart, I do believe
I'll be all right, someday."

Portsmouth Sinfonia
Portsmouth Sinfonia Plays
the Popular Classics
Columbia KC 33049
Not since the off-key warblings
of Mrs. Miller has there been a
recording group like the
Portsmouth Sinfonia, a group of
50 or so Englishmen and women
who play classical music with
musual enthusiasm and almost no
ability.
The word "rendition" takes on
new meaning as this strictly
amateur group renders well
known classics on both sides of
this record in a not-to-be
forgotten manner.

For example, the Portsmouth
Sinfonia's version of the "Blue
Danube Waltz" sounds about as
ponderous and ludicrous as a
hippopotamus fart at a Boston
Pops concert. And what the
Sinfonia does with "Also Sprach
Zarathustra" has to be heard to be
believed. It's enough to make apes
wish they had never seen the
monolith.
"The Nutcracker Suite," "The
William Tell Overture" and
"Beethoven's Fifth," among other
favorites, are given original,
teeth-grinding, chalk-over
blackboard treatments
guaranteed to make you laugh, set
you on edge, or both. However,
long doses of this record are
recommended only for stereo
masochists, or to send people
home when it's time to end the
party.

Not since the off-key warblings
of Mrs. Miller has there been a
recording group like the
Portsmouth Sinfonia, a group of
50 or so Englishmen and women
who play classical music with
musual enthusiasm and almost no
ability.
The word "rendition" takes on
new meaning as this strictly
amateur group renders well
known classics on both sides of
this record in a not-to-be
forgotten manner.

For example, the Portsmouth
Sinfonia's version of the "Blue
Danube Waltz" sounds about as
ponderous and ludicrous as a
hippopotamus fart at a Boston
Pops concert. And what the
Sinfonia does with "Also Sprach
Zarathustra" has to be heard to be
believed. It's enough to make apes
wish they had never seen the
monolith.
"The Nutcracker Suite," "The
William Tell Overture" and
"Beethoven's Fifth," among other
favorites, are given original,
teeth-grinding, chalk-over
blackboard treatments
guaranteed to make you laugh, set
you on edge, or both. However,
long doses of this record are
recommended only for stereo
masochists, or to send people

Rod Stewart
Smiler

Mercury SRML-1017
Why is Rod Stewart grinning
about his first release in over two
years? Maybe he's just listened to
several of the better cuts on
Smiler. Another possibility is that
he's pondering the fact that his
fans still have to pay the full rate
for the rest of the album.
Rod's fifth solo effort is a
mixed bag. At his best he can pen
and sing a ballad with anyone in
the business. On the other hand,
as this most recent work proves,
he is quite capable of providing
mediocre renditions of inadequate
material. His instrumental support
varies albng the same range.
"Sweet Little Rock V Roller,"
which opens the first side, is not
impressive. There are few rock
acts that haven't recorded a
Chuck Berry standard. Rod is no
exception, and adds nothing new
here. His back-up musicians
follow this lead, proving they can
copy 50s licks as well as anybody.
"Let Me Be Your Car," an
Elton John/Bernie Taupin
composition is a bit better due to
the presence of the Memphis
Horns, a brass section that adds
class and punch to this well
performed, but simple and
derivative collection of double

entendre lyrics and repetitive
musical figures.
Elton, the Liberace of rock 'n'
roll, accompanies on piano and
shares the vocals. We'll rate it
high, because you can dance to it.
Thanks, Elton.
On his last album, Rod was
quite successful with Sam Cooke's
"Twisting the Night Away." He
attempts, in vain, to repeat that
triumph with a medley of two
more Cooke songs. He starts out
robustly enough with "Bring it on
Home" but, by the time he
reaches into "You Send Me" he
has been foiled by a string section
mixed up so strongly that one
cannot help noticing the clash
between Rod's gravel utterances
and the silky smooth violins.
Cooke's voice was perfect for this
sort of treatment. Stewart's is not.
From the same era as the above
comes "(You make me feel like) A
Natural Man," adapted from the
Goffin/King/Vexler classic. Rod is
strong here, singing with both
inspiration and delicacy. Again,
the Memphis Horns add to the
arrangement, with tasteful
support from the back-up band.
Especially noteworthy is Marty
Quittention's acoustic guitar
work.
Stewart struts through three of
his own compositions on Smiler.
"Farewell," "Sailor" and "Dixie
Toot" continue Rod's tradition of
verse filled with catchy one liners.
On "Dixie Toot," which is
concerned with "having a good
time," he proclaims "[l'll] wear a
skirt, be a flirt if I want." This
spirit is reinforced musically by a
New Orleans jazz ensemble.
The best of the three is

"Farewell," a ballad written in
collaboration with Quittenton,
who co-authored "Maggie May."
It tells the familiar tale of leaving
home for fame, fortune, and the
freedom of the road. Rod's
confident tone makes the tune
convincing.
The album's masterpiece is
"Mine for Me," a Paul McCartney
love song. Stewart glides through
this work with deftly calculated
portions of tenderness and
authority, turning from one to
another at the appropriate
moments, and at times
interpreting with both tones. He
paces himself perfectly
throughout, subtly easing the song
to its close. It is this level of
mastery that makes the man a
star. If only he could maintain
this height, Smiler would be an
album of the same stature.
For you fans of the
inconsequential, there are four
other cuts on the LP. Two are
instrumentals with a total playing
time of 2:02. A third is Dylan's
"A Girl From the North
Country," performed in a
lackluster manner. Johnny Cash
did it much better.
The fourth is a throw-away
rock, most notable for the fact
that everyone performing wants
to set down the rhythm, but no

one wants to carry the melody.
The back-up band referred to
throughout the review consists of
permutations of all the Faces but
Ronnie Lane, Mr. John, Chris
Barbers Jazz Band ("Dixie
Toot?'), the Memphis House and
all the folks who brought you his
previous four albums. Standing
out amont the latter are Pete
Sears (piano), Rick Gretch

Jorma Kaukonen's guitar
playing days with Jefferson
Airplane and Hot Tuna are far
from over, but on Quah, his first
more or less solo album, he leaves
his stratocaster and cosmic
consciousness behind and picks
and sings some acoustic blues. If
your favorite song on Hot Tuna's
more recent album
Phosphorescent Rat, was "Sally,
Where'd You Get Your Liquor
From?," then this is the album for
you.

With the able assistance of
Tom Hobson, this non-electric
effort is altogether successful,
combining original folk/blues
tunes with traditional
arrangements in a very satisfying
collection. Kaukonen's voice,
laid-back and uncommercialized,

is the perfect complement to his
experienced guitar playing.
Quah's first side is
Kaukonen-heavy, but there is a
full dose of fun blues to offset his
sometimes over-serious lyrical
themes. Four cuts are distinctively
Kaukonen, lyrically and
instrumentally: "Genesis," "Song
For The North Star," "I'll Let
You Know Before I Leave" and
"Flying Clouds."
Side two kicks off with Rev.
Gary Davis' "I Am The Light Of
This World" and closes with the
lone Kaukonen song, "Hamar
Promenade," Tom Hobsone takes
vocals chores on two cuts, Gordon
Jenkin's "Blue Prelude" and his
own funny "Sweet Hawaiian
Sunshine" complete with
"tropical" dobro. Perhaps the best
song on the album is Blind Arthur
Blakes' "Police Dog Blues," a
straight-forward blues number
with hot guitar licks.
Quah is well-paced and plays

Grunt Records BFL 1-0209
Jorma Kaukonen's guitar
playing days with Jefferson
Airplane and Hot Tuna are far
from over, but on Quah, his first
more or less solo album, he leaves
his stratocaster and cosmic
consciousness behind and picks
and sings some acoustic blues. If
your favorite song on Hot Tuna's
more recent album
Phosphorescent Rat, was "Sally,
Where'd You Get Your Liquor
From?," then this is the album for
you.

With the able assistance of
Tom Hobson, this non-electric
effort is altogether successful,
combining original folk/blues
tunes with traditional
arrangements in a very satisfying
collection. Kaukonen's voice,
laid-back and uncommercialized,

is the perfect complement to his
experienced guitar playing.
Quah's first side is
Kaukonen-heavy, but there is a
full dose of fun blues to offset his
sometimes over-serious lyrical
themes. Four cuts are distinctively
Kaukonen, lyrically and
instrumentally: "Genesis," "Song
For The North Star," "I'll Let
You Know Before I Leave" and
"Flying Clouds."
Side two kicks off with Rev.
Gary Davis' "I Am The Light Of
This World" and closes with the
lone Kaukonen song, "Hamar
Promenade," Tom Hobsone takes
vocals chores on two cuts, Gordon
Jenkin's "Blue Prelude" and his
own funny "Sweet Hawaiian
Sunshine" complete with
"tropical" dobro. Perhaps the best
song on the album is Blind Arthur
Blakes' "Police Dog Blues," a
straight-forward blues number
with hot guitar licks.
Quah is well-paced and plays
off the traditional arrangements
and more contemporary cuts
excellently. One good acoustic
blues guitarist in this world of
high-energy electronics is a relief,
two of them playing side by side
is great.
Whether blazing away with Hot
Tuna or alone on a bar-stool in a
San Francisco nightclub, Jorma
Kaukonen is a highly unsung
leader in the American
rock/blues music scene. But as
he sings in Rev. Gary Davis' "I'll
Be All Right:"

"If trouble comes,
I don't pay no mind,
I'll be all right someday.
Deep in my heart, I do believe

Not since the off-key warblings
of Mrs. Miller has there been a
recording group like the
Portsmouth Sinfonia, a group of
50 or so Englishmen and women
who play classical music with
musual enthusiasm and almost no
ability.
The word "rendition" takes on
new meaning as this strictly
amateur group renders well
known classics on both sides of
this record in a not-to-be
forgotten manner.

For example, the Portsmouth
Sinfonia's version of the "Blue
Danube Waltz" sounds about as
ponderous and ludicrous as a
hippopotamus fart at a Boston
Pops concert. And what the
Sinfonia does with "Also Sprach
Zarathustra" has to be heard to be
believed. It's enough to make apes
wish they had never seen the
monolith.
"The Nutcracker Suite," "The
William Tell Overture" and
"Beethoven's Fifth," among other
favorites, are given original,
teeth-grinding, chalk-over
blackboard treatments
guaranteed to make you laugh, set
you on edge, or both. However,
long doses of this record are
recommended only for stereo
masochists, or to send people

Rod Stewart
Smiler

Mercury SRML-1017
Why is Rod Stewart grinning
about his first release in over two
years? Maybe he's just listened to
several of the better cuts on
Smiler. Another possibility is that
he's pondering the fact that his
fans still have to pay the full rate
for the rest of the album.
Rod's fifth solo effort is a
mixed bag. At his best he can pen
and sing a ballad with anyone in
the business. On the other hand,
as this most recent work proves,
he is quite capable of providing
mediocre renditions of inadequate
material. His instrumental support
varies albng the same range.
"Sweet Little Rock V Roller,"
which opens the first side, is not
impressive. There are few rock
acts that haven't recorded a
Chuck Berry standard. Rod is no
exception, and adds nothing new
here. His back-up musicians
follow this lead, proving they can
copy 50s licks as well as anybody.
"Let Me Be Your Car," an
Elton John/Bernie Taupin
composition is a bit better due to
the presence of the Memphis
Horns, a brass section that adds
class and punch to this well
performed, but simple and
derivative collection of double

entendre lyrics and repetitive
musical figures.
Elton, the Liberace of rock 'n'
roll, accompanies on piano and
shares the vocals. We'll rate it
high, because you can dance to it.
Thanks, Elton.
On his last album, Rod was
quite successful with Sam Cooke's
"Twisting the Night Away." He
attempts, in vain, to repeat that
triumph with a medley of two
more Cooke songs. He starts out
robustly enough with "Bring it on
Home" but, by the time he
reaches into "You Send Me" he
has been foiled by a string section
mixed up so strongly that one
cannot help noticing the clash
between Rod's gravel utterances
and the silky smooth violins.
Cooke's voice was perfect for this
sort of treatment. Stewart's is not.
From the same era as the above
comes "(You make me feel like) A
Natural Man," adapted from the
Goffin/King/Vexler classic. Rod is
strong here, singing with both
inspiration and delicacy. Again,
the Memphis Horns add to the
arrangement, with tasteful
support from the back-up band.
Especially noteworthy is Marty
Quittention's acoustic guitar
work.
Stewart struts through three of
his own compositions on Smiler.
"Farewell," "Sailor" and "Dixie
Toot" continue Rod's tradition of
verse filled with catchy one liners.
On "Dixie Toot," which is
concerned with "having a good
time," he proclaims "[l'll] wear a
skirt, be a flirt if I want." This
spirit is reinforced musically by a
New Orleans jazz ensemble.
The best of the three is

"Farewell," a ballad written in
collaboration with Quittenton,
who co-authored "Maggie May."
It tells the familiar tale of leaving
home for fame, fortune, and the
freedom of the road. Rod's
confident tone makes the tune
convincing.
The album's masterpiece is
"Mine for Me," a Paul McCartney
love song. Stewart glides through
this work with deftly calculated
portions of tenderness and
authority, turning from one to
another at the appropriate
moments, and at times
interpreting with both tones. He
paces himself perfectly
throughout, subtly easing the song
to its close. It is this level of
mastery that makes the man a
star. If only he could maintain
this height, Smiler would be an
album of the same stature.
For you fans of the
inconsequential, there are four
other cuts on the LP. Two are
instrumentals with a total playing
time of 2:02. A third is Dylan's
"A Girl From the North
Country," performed in a
lackluster manner. Johnny Cash
did it much better.
The fourth is a throw-away
rock, most notable for the fact
that everyone performing wants
to set down the rhythm, but no

one wants to carry the melody.
The back-up band referred to

more Cooke songs. He starts out
robustly enough with "Bring it on
Home" but, by the time he
reaches into "You Send Me" he
has been foiled by a string section
mixed up so strongly that one
cannot help noticing the clash
between Rod's gravel utterances
and the silky smooth violins.
Cooke's voice was perfect for this
sort of treatment. Stewart's is not.
From the same era as the above
comes "(You make me feel like) A
Natural Man," adapted from the
Goffin/King/Vexler classic. Rod is
strong here, singing with both
inspiration and delicacy. Again,
the Memphis Horns add to the
arrangement, with tasteful
support from the back-up band.
Especially noteworthy is Marty
Quittention's acoustic guitar
work.
Stewart struts through three of
his own compositions on Smiler.
"Farewell," "Sailor" and "Dixie
Toot" continue Rod's tradition of
verse filled with catchy one liners.
On "Dixie Toot," which is
concerned with "having a good
time," he proclaims "[l'll] wear a
skirt, be a flirt if I want." This
spirit is reinforced musically by a
New Orleans jazz ensemble.
The best of the three is

"Farewell," a ballad written in
collaboration with Quittenton,
who co-authored "Maggie May."
It tells the familiar tale of leaving
home for fame, fortune, and the
freedom of the road. Rod's
confident tone makes the tune
convincing.
The album's masterpiece is
"Mine for Me," a Paul McCartney
love song. Stewart glides through
this work with deftly calculated
portions of tenderness and
authority, turning from one to
another at the appropriate
moments, and at times
interpreting with both tones. He
paces himself perfectly
throughout, subtly easing the song
to its close. It is this level of
mastery that makes the man a
star. If only he could maintain
this height, Smiler would be an
album of the same stature.
For you fans of the
inconsequential, there are four
other cuts on the LP. Two are
instrumentals with a total playing
time of 2:02. A third is Dylan's
"A Girl From the North
Country," performed in a
lackluster manner. Johnny Cash
did it much better.
The fourth is a throw-away
rock, most notable for the fact
that everyone performing wants
to set down the rhythm, but no

one wants to carry the melody.
The back-up band referred to
throughout the review consists of
permutations of all the Faces but
Ronnie Lane, Mr. John, Chris
Barbers Jazz Band ("Dixie

Jorma Kaukonen's guitar
playing days with Jefferson
Airplane and Hot Tuna are far
from over, but on Quah, his first
more or less solo album, he leaves
his stratocaster and cosmic
consciousness behind and picks
and sings some acoustic blues. If
your favorite song on Hot Tuna's
more recent album
Phosphorescent Rat, was "Sally,
Where'd You Get Your Liquor
From?," then this is the album for
you.

With the able assistance of
Tom Hobson, this non-electric
effort is altogether successful,
combining original folk/blues
tunes with traditional
arrangements in a very satisfying
collection. Kaukonen's voice,
laid-back and uncommercialized,

is the perfect complement to his
experienced guitar playing.
Quah's first side is
Kaukonen-heavy, but there is a
full dose of fun blues to offset his
sometimes over-serious lyrical
themes. Four cuts are distinctively
Kaukonen, lyrically and
instrumentally: "Genesis," "Song
For The North Star," "I'll Let
You Know Before I Leave" and
"Flying Clouds."
Side two kicks off with Rev.
Gary Davis' "I Am The Light Of
This World" and closes with the
lone Kaukonen song, "Hamar
Promenade," Tom Hobsone takes
vocals chores on two cuts, Gordon
Jenkin's "Blue Prelude" and his
own funny "Sweet Hawaiian
Sunshine" complete with
"tropical" dobro. Perhaps the best
song on the album is Blind Arthur
Blakes' "Police Dog Blues," a
straight-forward blues number
with hot guitar licks.
Quah is well-paced and plays
off the traditional arrangements
and more contemporary cuts
excellently. One good acoustic
blues guitarist in this world of
high-energy electronics is a relief,
two of them playing side by side
is great.
Whether blazing away with Hot
Tuna or alone on a bar-stool in a
San Francisco nightclub, Jorma
Kaukonen is a highly unsung
leader in the American
rock/blues music scene. But as
he sings in Rev. Gary Davis' "I'll
Be All Right:"

"If trouble comes,
I don't pay no mind,
I'll be all right someday.
Deep in my heart, I do believe
I'll be all right, someday."

Not since the off-key warblings
of Mrs. Miller has there been a
recording group like the
Portsmouth Sinfonia, a group of
50 or so Englishmen and women
who play classical music with
musual enthusiasm and almost no
ability.
The word "rendition" takes on
new meaning as this strictly
amateur group renders well
known classics on both sides of
this record in a not-to-be
forgotten manner.

For example, the Portsmouth
Sinfonia's version of the "Blue
Danube Waltz" sounds about as
ponderous and ludicrous as a
hippopotamus fart at a Boston
Pops concert. And what the
Sinfonia does with "Also Sprach
Zarathustra" has to be heard to be
believed. It's enough to make apes
wish they had never seen the
monolith.
"The Nutcracker Suite," "The
William Tell Overture" and
"Beethoven's Fifth," among other
favorites, are given original,
teeth-grinding, chalk-over
blackboard treatments
guaranteed to make you laugh, set
you on edge, or both. However,
long doses of this record are
recommended only for stereo
masochists, or to send people
home when it's time to end the

Smiler

Mercury SRML-1017
Why is Rod Stewart grinning
about his first release in over two
years? Maybe he's just listened to
several of the better cuts on
Smiler. Another possibility is that
he's pondering the fact that his
fans still have to pay the full rate
for the rest of the album.
Rod's fifth solo effort is a
mixed bag. At his best he can pen
and sing a ballad with anyone in
the business. On the other hand,
as this most recent work proves,
he is quite capable of providing
mediocre renditions of inadequate
material. His instrumental support
varies albng the same range.
"Sweet Little Rock V Roller,"
which opens the first side, is not
impressive. There are few rock
acts that haven't recorded a
Chuck Berry standard. Rod is no
exception, and adds nothing new
here. His back-up musicians
follow this lead, proving they can
copy 50s licks as well as anybody.
"Let Me Be Your Car," an
Elton John/Bernie Taupin
composition is a bit better due to
the presence of the Memphis
Horns, a brass section that adds
class and punch to this well
performed, but simple and
derivative collection of double

entendre lyrics and repetitive
musical figures.
Elton, the Liberace of rock 'n'
roll, accompanies on piano and
shares the vocals. We'll rate it
high, because you can dance to it.
Thanks, Elton.
On his last album, Rod was
quite successful with Sam Cooke's
"Twisting the Night Away." He
attempts, in vain, to repeat that
triumph with a medley of two
more Cooke songs. He starts out
robustly enough with "Bring it on

"The Nutcracker Suite," "The
William Tell Overture" and
"Beethoven's Fifth," among other
favorites, are given original,
teeth-grinding, chalk-over
blackboard treatments
guaranteed to make you laugh, set
you on edge, or both. However,
long doses of this record are
recommended only for stereo
masochists, or to send people
home when it's time to end the
party.
