# The 						World Of Cinema
## Movie Depends On Reynolds 
### George Powell 
In his checkered career as a
director, Robert Aldrich hasn't
shied away from controversial
treatment of everyday topics. He
has had some hits ( old age
Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,
war The Dirty Dozen) and some
misses (Hollywood The Legend
of Lylah Clare, gangsters The
Grissom Gang) but has never
made a movie without at least a
few brilliant moments.
'The Longest Yard, 'does have its
moments, but it is largely a movie
that Burt Reynolds carries by
himself. Aldrich and producer A1
Ruddy, who also devised the
story, must have had Reynolds in
mind when they were looking for
a star who could be a believable

quarterback for a team of
prisoners who play a team of
guards.
Without Reynolds and the
excellent action sequences of the
game itself, the film would have
been little more than an
elongated, wry joke on America's
obsession with football and
winning.
Instead, Aldrich, by using
Reynolds and a large group of
former professional and college
football players (Ray Nitschke,
Joe Kapp, Sonny Sixkiller and
Ernie Wheelwright, to name a
few) has created a mythical game
that captures the imagination of
the audience nearly as well as the
real thing.
The first third of the film sets
up the situation for the climactic
game between the guards and the
prisoners, as football-crazy
warden Eddie Albert looks for a
good tune-up for his semi-pro
team. Reynolds is forced into
organizing a team of prisoners to
oppose the guards, since he is a
former famous football star who
is in jail for shaving points
(although the first part of the film
makes it look like he is in jail for
car theft and resisting arrest).
• But that has little effect on the
final third of the movie, the game.
Reynolds is there and he's the
prisoners' quarterback. The fact
that another retired
player-cum-crook just hanpens to
be around to helD him with

coaching chores is another gap
that Aldrich leaves unfilled.
Everything points to the game,
with the byplay between prisoner
Reynolds and warden Albert
adding all kinds of overtones
about power, corruption and
dignity to the eventual outcome.
Reynolds is perfect as the glib,
cocky ex-jock, who takes care of
himself first. Albert seemed to
draw inspiration for his role from
Richard Nixon and Vinee
Lombardi, who were both
obsessed with football and the
exercise of power.
But Albert is mainly a foil for
Reynolds' wit and poses a moral
dilemma to be overcome. Thesie
two factors are well-mixed by
Aldrich in some of the roughest
football sequences outside of a
real game. The rest of the film is a
pastiche of Dirty Dozen type
camaraderie between prisoners,
with Aldrich fooling around in a J
serio-comic manner with almost
every macho-oriented cliche I
before the climactic contest.
The ending, which won't be
revealed here, is as pulse-pounding
as any recent Stanford Cardinal
game in the LA Coliseum. Using
this game-generated excitement,
Aldrich has put together another
entertaining film, while taking
some good licks at the
win-at-any-cost school of football.
1 The Longest Yard, rated R, is
currently playing at the Palo Alto
Square I.

with his son, Merle, and John Fahey. The performance should provide
a full night of strumming and picking. Tickets for the performances
are priced at $3.50.

WHAT'S UP DOC?—A concert in Memorial Auditorium tomorrow
night, that's what. Pictured above is Doc Watson who is appearing
with his son, Merle, and John Fahey. The performance should provide
a full night of strumming and picking. Tickets for the performances
are priced at $3.50.
In his checkered career as a
director, Robert Aldrich hasn't
shied away from controversial
treatment of everyday topics. He
has had some hits ( old age
Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,
war The Dirty Dozen) and some
misses (Hollywood The Legend
of Lylah Clare, gangsters The
Grissom Gang) but has never
made a movie without at least a
few brilliant moments.
'The Longest Yard, 'does have its
moments, but it is largely a movie
that Burt Reynolds carries by
himself. Aldrich and producer A1
Ruddy, who also devised the
story, must have had Reynolds in
mind when they were looking for
a star who could be a believable

quarterback for a team of
prisoners who play a team of
guards.
Without Reynolds and the
excellent action sequences of the
game itself, the film would have
been little more than an
elongated, wry joke on America's
obsession with football and
winning.
Instead, Aldrich, by using
Reynolds and a large group of
former professional and college
football players (Ray Nitschke,
Joe Kapp, Sonny Sixkiller and
Ernie Wheelwright, to name a
few) has created a mythical game
that captures the imagination of
the audience nearly as well as the
real thing.
The first third of the film sets
up the situation for the climactic
game between the guards and the
prisoners, as football-crazy
warden Eddie Albert looks for a
good tune-up for his semi-pro
team. Reynolds is forced into
organizing a team of prisoners to
oppose the guards, since he is a
former famous football star who
is in jail for shaving points
(although the first part of the film
makes it look like he is in jail for
car theft and resisting arrest).
• But that has little effect on the
final third of the movie, the game.
Reynolds is there and he's the
prisoners' quarterback. The fact
that another retired
player-cum-crook just hanpens to
be around to helD him with

coaching chores is another gap
that Aldrich leaves unfilled.
Everything points to the game,
with the byplay between prisoner
Reynolds and warden Albert
adding all kinds of overtones
about power, corruption and
dignity to the eventual outcome.
Reynolds is perfect as the glib,
cocky ex-jock, who takes care of
himself first. Albert seemed to
draw inspiration for his role from
Richard Nixon and Vinee
Lombardi, who were both
obsessed with football and the
exercise of power.
But Albert is mainly a foil for
Reynolds' wit and poses a moral
dilemma to be overcome. Thesie
two factors are well-mixed by
Aldrich in some of the roughest
football sequences outside of a
real game. The rest of the film is a
pastiche of Dirty Dozen type
camaraderie between prisoners,
with Aldrich fooling around in a J
serio-comic manner with almost
every macho-oriented cliche I
before the climactic contest.
