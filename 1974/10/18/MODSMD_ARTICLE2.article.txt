# COSS 'Weighty Force'
## Subcommittee To Study Housing 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Within two weeks tbe— ASSU
Nominations Committee will appoint a
Committee On Student Services
(COSS) housing subcommittee which
will have "an extremely weighty
force" in choosing a new housing
system, according to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry N. Horton.
COSS Chairman Suzi Harmatz said
COSS members decided earlier this
week to form the subcommittee
"regardless of the immediate housing
issue." Harmatz added that the
subcommittee would also consider
resident assistant (RA) selection and
the validity of educational residential
programs.
However, Harmatz stated that the
subcommittee's immediate goal will be
to review the housing system and
make a recommendation to Horton.
Horton will accept
recommendations from a number of
groups, including the COSS
subcommittee and Row and Fraternity
House Director Norman Robinson
before proposing a final housing
system to Dean of Student Affairs
James W. Lyons.
Review
President Richard W. Lyman and
the Board of Trustees will review
Horton's recommendation before the
final decision is made.
Horton emphasized the influence of
the subcommittee's proposal. Harmatz
said Horton's fraternity and dormitory

discussions show he has made an effort
to learn student opinions of the
various housing proposals.
She added that she now expects
Horton to listen to the subcommittee.
"I can hardly see him flatly denying
[the subcommittee's]
recommendation. If he did, it would
cause a student outrage."
Harmatz said the subcommittee
would consist of three students, one
faculty or staff member and two COSS
members.
Student Applications
The ASSU Nominations Committee
will choose the three students from
applications submitted by members of
the general student body. The
applications will be available Monday
in the ASSU office.
ASSU President Mike Herman, who
chairs the Nominations Committee,
emphasized that "no particular special
interest group would be represented"
when the committee chooses the
subcommittee members.
Herman said he wanted a "broad
cross-section" of women and men,
fraternity and non-fraternity members,
and minorities represented on the
committee.
Pressure
He mentioned that there has been a
lot of pressure on him to place
fraternity members on the
subcommittee. "The fraternities are an
important group but not the most
important group," Herman remarked.

However, Harmatz said if the
committee members feel a certain
group has not been represented on the
subcommittee, COSS has the right to
make final subcommittee
appointments. She specifically
mentioned that the Committee on
Education and Employment of
Women and the Intra-Fraternity
Council should definitely be
represented.
Other members of the
subcommittee will be selected by the
particular group they represent. The
Faculty Senate will also choose a
representative.
Harmatz said she hoped one
student and one faculty or staff
member would fill the two slots
allocated to COSS members. Horton is
an ex-officio member of the
subcommittee.

member would fill the two slots
allocated to COSS members. Horton is
an ex-officio member of the
subcommittee.
Within two weeks tbe— ASSU
Nominations Committee will appoint a
Committee On Student Services
(COSS) housing subcommittee which
will have "an extremely weighty
force" in choosing a new housing
system, according to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry N. Horton.
COSS Chairman Suzi Harmatz said
COSS members decided earlier this
week to form the subcommittee
"regardless of the immediate housing
issue." Harmatz added that the
subcommittee would also consider
resident assistant (RA) selection and
the validity of educational residential
programs.
However, Harmatz stated that the
subcommittee's immediate goal will be
to review the housing system and
make a recommendation to Horton.
Horton will accept
recommendations from a number of
groups, including the COSS
subcommittee and Row and Fraternity
House Director Norman Robinson
before proposing a final housing
system to Dean of Student Affairs
James W. Lyons.
Review
President Richard W. Lyman and
the Board of Trustees will review
Horton's recommendation before the
final decision is made.
Horton emphasized the influence of
the subcommittee's proposal. Harmatz
said Horton's fraternity and dormitory

discussions show he has made an effort
to learn student opinions of the
various housing proposals.
She added that she now expects
Horton to listen to the subcommittee.
"I can hardly see him flatly denying
[the subcommittee's]
recommendation. If he did, it would
cause a student outrage."
Harmatz said the subcommittee
would consist of three students, one
faculty or staff member and two COSS
members.
Student Applications
The ASSU Nominations Committee
will choose the three students from
applications submitted by members of
the general student body. The
applications will be available Monday
in the ASSU office.
ASSU President Mike Herman, who
chairs the Nominations Committee,
emphasized that "no particular special
interest group would be represented"
when the committee chooses the
subcommittee members.
Herman said he wanted a "broad
cross-section" of women and men,
fraternity and non-fraternity members,
and minorities represented on the
committee.
Pressure
He mentioned that there has been a
lot of pressure on him to place
fraternity members on the
subcommittee. "The fraternities are an
important group but not the most
important group," Herman remarked.

However, Harmatz said if the
committee members feel a certain
group has not been represented on the
subcommittee, COSS has the right to
make final subcommittee
appointments. She specifically
mentioned that the Committee on
Education and Employment of
Women and the Intra-Fraternity
Council should definitely be
represented.
Other members of the
subcommittee will be selected by the
particular group they represent. The
Faculty Senate will also choose a
representative.
Harmatz said she hoped one
student and one faculty or staff
member would fill the two slots
allocated to COSS members. Horton is

subcommittee.
