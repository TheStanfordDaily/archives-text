## Against Washington Tomorrow Now Or Never For Cards 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
!At exactly halftime tomorrow,
■Stanford will be midway through
Bts 1974 football season,
■ according to the schedule. But
I unless the Cards are on top one
| half later, the season will be over.
Stanford now stands at 0-3-2,
I but still hopes for a conference
[ championship that seems more
elusive every week. The Cardinals
are coming off the most
disappointing game of the year, a
tie with UCLA in the
conference opener.
In an effort to pull things
together, coach Jack Christiansen
held a meeting with his seniors
Wednesday. While no
earth-shaking revelations came out
of the council, players said they
i appreciated Chris' openness in
discussing decisions he has made,
such as the choice to start Mike
Cordova at quarterback.
The Cardinals enter the 1:30
p.m. contest (for which over
40,000 people are expected) as
; «-10-point favorites. But the real
odds on the game might be closer
than these.
Stanford's running game, last
4 in the conference already, is
further set back this week by
, injuries. Scott Laidlaw, who
played his finest game of the year
last week, has bruised ribs and will

play with pain. Ron Inge, who
sprained a shoulder, will probably
see little more than spot duty.
Pass Defense
So the weapon by which
Stanford must attack is the air.
And the Huskies are strong in pass
defense, allowing only 32
completions of the 80 passes
thrown against them.
The big name on defense for
Washington is tackle Dave Pear, a
6-foot-3, 255-pound senior who's
tabbed as an All-America
candidate, though that distinction
seems meaningless after the poor
performance of San Jose State's
Dave Wasick against the Cards.
On offense, Husky coach Jim
Owens has been accused of trying
to make his team into something
it is not—a running team. Owens
installed the Veer-T offense
before the season started. But
Washington doesn't seem to win
when it runs, as the Huskies tried
to do in last week's 23-9 loss to
Oregon State.
More Throwing
"I don't know why Jim didn't
pass more," said Sports
Information Director Don
Bernstein. Bernstein predicted,
"We will throw a lot against
Stanford."
The man doing the throwing is
junior Chris Rowland. Rowland's

Faculty-staff and student
non-reserved basketball tickets are
now on sale at the Department of
Athletics ticket office. Tickets for
the complete 11-game home
schedule are $9.

hit on only 46 of 99 passes, but
has led the club well. His backup,
Denny Fitzoatrick, doesn't pass
especially well, b"t can run the
veer better than Rowland.
The Huskies have one top
runner, halfback Willie Hendricks,
who's averased 5.4 yards
carry.
But many pnopln think th»t if
Owens is to save his iob, he'll have
to use the airwaves to do it. The
Husky offensive line isn't even as
big as Stanford's, and hasn't
blown many people out this year.
Good Punting
Washington's other big strength
is punting. Skip Boyd kicks the
ball a high, and consistent, 44
yards. Last season, Boyd's punting
almost beat Stanford on a rainy
day in Seattle, but a missed field
goal attempt by Boyd helped lose
the game 23-14. The new place
kicker, Jay Robbins, hasn't been
much better, hitting only two of
seven.
Bernstein isn't optimistic about
the Huskies' chances. "We
probably don't have enough to
stay in the ballgame with a team
like Stanford," he said Tuesday,
half joking.
But if the Huskies played as
they did against lowa State, when
they won 31-28, or Texas A&M,
when they lost 28-15, they'll be in
the game.
Besides, it would be
presumptuous for Stanford right
now to predict that anybody
couldn't stay in the game with
them.

On offense, Husky coach Jim
Owens has been accused of trying
to make his team into something
it is not—a running team. Owens
installed the Veer-T offense
before the season started. But
Washington doesn't seem to win
when it runs, as the Huskies tried
to do in last week's 23-9 loss to
Oregon State.
More Throwing
"I don't know why Jim didn't
pass more," said Sports
Information Director Don
Bernstein. Bernstein predicted,
"We will throw a lot against
Stanford."
The man doing the throwing is
junior Chris Rowland. Rowland's

schedule are $9.

hit on only 46 of 99 passes, but
has led the club well. His backup,
Denny Fitzoatrick, doesn't pass
especially well, b"t can run the
veer better than Rowland.
The Huskies have one top
runner, halfback Willie Hendricks,
who's averased 5.4 yards
carry.
But many pnopln think th»t if
Owens is to save his iob, he'll have
to use the airwaves to do it. The
Husky offensive line isn't even as
big as Stanford's, and hasn't
blown many people out this year.
Good Punting
Washington's other big strength
is punting. Skip Boyd kicks the
ball a high, and consistent, 44
yards. Last season, Boyd's punting
almost beat Stanford on a rainy
day in Seattle, but a missed field
goal attempt by Boyd helped lose
the game 23-14. The new place
kicker, Jay Robbins, hasn't been
much better, hitting only two of
seven.
Bernstein isn't optimistic about
the Huskies' chances. "We
probably don't have enough to
stay in the ballgame with a team
like Stanford," he said Tuesday,
half joking.
But if the Huskies played as
they did against lowa State, when
they won 31-28, or Texas A&M,
when they lost 28-15, they'll be in
the game.
Besides, it would be
presumptuous for Stanford right
now to predict that anybody
couldn't stay in the game with
them.
!At exactly halftime tomorrow,
■Stanford will be midway through
Bts 1974 football season,
■ according to the schedule. But
I unless the Cards are on top one
| half later, the season will be over.
Stanford now stands at 0-3-2,
I but still hopes for a conference
[ championship that seems more
elusive every week. The Cardinals
are coming off the most
disappointing game of the year, a
tie with UCLA in the
conference opener.
In an effort to pull things
together, coach Jack Christiansen
held a meeting with his seniors
Wednesday. While no
earth-shaking revelations came out
of the council, players said they
i appreciated Chris' openness in
discussing decisions he has made,
such as the choice to start Mike
Cordova at quarterback.
The Cardinals enter the 1:30
p.m. contest (for which over
40,000 people are expected) as
; «-10-point favorites. But the real
odds on the game might be closer
than these.
Stanford's running game, last
4 in the conference already, is
further set back this week by
, injuries. Scott Laidlaw, who
played his finest game of the year
last week, has bruised ribs and will

play with pain. Ron Inge, who
sprained a shoulder, will probably
see little more than spot duty.
Pass Defense
So the weapon by which
Stanford must attack is the air.
And the Huskies are strong in pass
defense, allowing only 32
completions of the 80 passes
thrown against them.
The big name on defense for
Washington is tackle Dave Pear, a
6-foot-3, 255-pound senior who's
tabbed as an All-America
candidate, though that distinction
seems meaningless after the poor
performance of San Jose State's
Dave Wasick against the Cards.
