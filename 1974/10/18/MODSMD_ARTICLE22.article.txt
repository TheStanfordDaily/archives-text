It is a tribute to the skill of Stanford's
football players that, after such a disastrous
start, many ordinarily sober folks still believe
that the Cardinals can win the Pacific-8
championship. But unless coach Jack
Christiansen moves quickly to correct the
mistakes he has made in running the Stanford
offense, such touching loyalty will go for
naught.
Contrary to the opinion of many fans, it
has been the offense, not the defense, which
has been most responsible for Stanford's
losses this season.
Though it is regrettable that in four of its
five games the Cardinals have given up crucial
points in the fourth quarter, no defense can
be realistically expected to hold off potent
teams such as Penn State, UCLA, and
Michigan after having played much of the
game inside its own territory.
Turnovers, poor punting and the inability
of the offense to move and control the
football have forced the defense to play
under great pressure.
Stanford's failure to score is due in large
part to the unimaginative offense
Christiansen has used this fall. Like most
professional football teams, Stanford uses a
split-T formation which relies on power
running and drop-back passing.
But unlike successful pro teams such as
Los Angeles, Miami, and Oakland, Stanford
has never had the players to outmuscle its
opponents at the line of scrimmage.
Football giants like USC, Ohio State, and
Michigan can recruit scores of huge linemen
and powerful runners, but Stanford has had
to adapt the pro-style offense to its limited
pool of talent.
Though it took John Ralston several years
to learn this lesson, he had great success

when he de-emphasized the straight-ahead
running game, added some deception and
told his quarterbacks to throw the football.
With Jim Plunkett and Don Bunce at the
helm, Stanford became one of the nation's
most explosive teams.
Unlike Ralston, Christiansen persists in
believing Stanford can run the football
straight at, and through, its opponents. The
results of the first five games suggest
differently.
Again this year, Stanford is last in the
Pacific Eight in rushing offense. It is easy for
the coaches to blame the offensive line for
this poor performance, but there are good
reasons to believe that the fault lies equally
with the game plan.
The Stanford playbook so far this season
contains only a limited selection of running
plays. These include several inside blasts
behind drive blocking, a quick pitch, a trap
play added for the UCLA game and the
quarterback option.

Stanford has used few trap plays, no
misdirection and virtully no deception. Only
pass-action plays such as draws and screens
have given running backs a chance to show
their talents. So predictable has the ground
attack become that opponents, both strong
and weak, have been able to anticipate and
defeat the offensive thrust.
Christiansen though continues to believe
in the straight ahead running game. He
believes, however, against all logic and hope.
Stanford's personnel, as good as they are, will
never be able to overpower a Penn State,
Michigan, UCLA or USC.
Christiansen might be rescued from his
folly if he would field a top-notch passer. A
quarterback with an accurate arm might be
able to maintain ball control by converting

the third-and-long situations the running
game creates and march the team into scoring
position.
Instead, Christiansen has chosen to start
his third best quarterback, Mike Cordova. He
could hardly have made a more unfortunate
choice.
While Cordova's rocket passes bounce off
the hands of receivers or dig divots in the
turf, on the bench sits Stanford's best passer,
Guy Benjamin. Benjamin, like Cordova, a
sophomore, was promised a shot at the
starting position.
Christiansen did not live up to that
promise. Though Benjamin completed 11 of
15 passes for 128 yards and a touchdown in
the first half against Illinois, Christiansen
noticed only two costly errors and
substituted Cordova, whose inept play iced
the victory for the Illini.
If the Illinois game left any doubts about
who was the superior quarterback, the UCLA
game resolved them. Coming off the bench
after Cordova was shaken up, Benjamin
completed six or seven passes for 58 yards
and a touchdown against a UCLA defense
which was anticipating the pass.
Against the same team, Cordova managed
only 13 completions in 28 attempts.
Christiansen says that Cordova will be his
quarterback until he gets hurt or plays badly.
This is small comfort to Stanford fans,
since by most standards, Cordova has played
himself out of the number one job. He is
sustained only by Christiansen's stubborness.
So far the coaching staff has blamed the
players for Stanford's poor showing. But
coaches make mistakes too. Most players still
admire Christensen and Norb Hecker, the
defensive coordinator. But this admiration
will not survive a season of coaching failures.
If the coaches expect the team to heed
their criticisms of failures on the field, the
players must be assured that Christensen has
the grace and dignity to admit and correct
the mistakes that have caused this season's
disasters.
