# Scotchers Seek Third League Title
## 
### CHARLIE WHEELER 
Winning is a tradition of the
Stanford women's field hockey
team. For the past two years, the
Cardinals have been undefeated
NCIAC champions.
The squad begins the defense
of its title tomorrow at Cal
State-Hay ward, followed by its
home opener against a strong
team from Cal State-Chico
Wednesday.
The varsity has seven returning
players from last year's team.
They will be aided by several
members of last season's JV team,
as well as three freshmen.
Defense should be one of the
Cardinals' storng points. Junior
goalkeeper Betsy Morris, senior
fullback Susie Schatzman and
junior fullback Dee Gates have
played together for the past two
seasons. They can hardly improve
on last year, however, since they
only allowed three goals during
the entire season.
Captain Must Lead
In field hockey, more than in
other sports, a captain must lead
her team, because coaching from
the sidelines and substitution are
not permitted during the game.
Senior right wing Cappy Coleman
and senior center half Janell
Edman were practically
unanimous choices of their
teammates as co-captains.
Rounding out the returning

varsity players from last season
are sophomore center forward
Kathy Levinson and junior Lyse
Strnad.
Senior Barb Tyler, juniors Ann
Walker and Jane Schultz and
sophomore Carol Ferguson all
have moved up from last year's JV
squad. They are joined by
freshmen Sukie Jackson,
Killefer and Jane Soyster.

Strongest Ever
Schoof feels this year's junior
varsity team could be the
strongest ever fielded at Stanford.
Like the varsity, the JV team has
14 members, of whom 11 play in
any given game. The squad is
captained by sophomore Connie
Butler. Six freshmen, a transfer
student and several members of
last year's JV team make up the
squad.
The strongest opposition the
Cards will face in the weeks ahead
is expected to come from Chico
and then San Jose State, in the
season finale here at Stanford.
The Spartans were the only team
to defeat Stanford in the NCI AC
pre-season tournament, winning
1-0 in a shortened game. Other
conference teams who could give
the field hockey team trouble
include Sacramento State and
UC-Davis.
All these games (except
Sacramento State) will be played
at Stanford. The home field ma>
be a disadvantage, however, as the
turf is in less thatn optima
condition. At least one member oi
the team has suffered a leg injury
though not serious, by stepping ir
a hole left by an IM footbal
player. Schoof hopes IM team
will avoid the field in the future

THE COACH? Bert Baldacinni is this year's varsity soccer coach,
but is still under head coach Fred Priddle. The situation, to say the
least, is confusing.
