# Who's The Real Soccer Coach?
## 
### DOUG STERNE 
Where is Bud Collier to ask,
"Would the real Stanford soccer
coach please stand up?" Among
the panelists, only Orson Bean
might guess that the Cardinal
team, is currently being led by a
schizoid partnership.
Over the past 25 years, Fred
Priddle has established himself as
Stanford's resident soccer coach.
His knowledge about managing
the team's tight budget and his
ability to paste together schedules
with top-notch teams are
invaluable. Yet Priddle's approach
to on-the-field direction belongs
to the era of Knute Rockne and
the Gipper, as he'll tell you.
"Fifteen years ago I could have
brought the whole team into this
small room, sat them down and
given them a real pep talk,"
Priddle says, realizing those days
are gone.
After Stanford's 4-0 loss to
UCLA, Priddle told the team,
"The first 10 times we had the
ball we simply gave it away.
You've got to fight to get the ball
back."
Player reaction to this
statement ranged from talking to
yawning as the coach's comment
fell far short of a cosmic
revelation.

Baldacinni's Era
And so, having reached the era
of the liberated athlete, the
one-time head groundskeeper has
relinquished some of his coaching
duties to a younger man named
Bert Baldacinni.
Baldacinni's own ability at
playing the game he was voted
the Peninsula Soccer League's
MVP in 1973 has enabled him
to provide first hand instruction
to the squad while working out
with them. Robby Robb, a
midfielder for the Cards and the
man responsible for recruiting
Baldacinni, gives the new coach

credit for "bringing the team
together."
Robb also says, "Bert can
take people aside and help them
with their individual techniques in
a very mellow way. We're able to
respect him as a coach, player
and friend."
Pass-And-Support
With a de-emphasis on
morale-boosting tirades,
Baldacinni stresses a
"pass-and-support" system of
soccer which includes three-man
passing units. And though he
applies his playing knowledge to
the improvement of individual
skills, Baldacinni places a great
deal of importance on "the
development of team play."
Faced with a dichotomy of
coaching styles, the Stanford
soccer team tends to opt for the
more modern version.

"Players have to build a certain
respect for each other on the
field," says Baldacinni. Charlie
Hall, a Card fullback, does not
believe that this type of mutual
respect is possible under the
guidance of Priddle because "Fred
has no definite conception of
what he wants from a player."
Adds rightwinger Jimmy
Mulamed, "If the team is to get
moving, it will be under Bert."
Co-Leader
In spite of this kind of
compliment, Baldacinni finds it
difficult to take full hold of the
reigns in his somewhat
paradoxical position as
"co-leader," under Priddle.
Because he "lacks official
recognition," according to
midfielder Marty Glickfeld,
Baldacinni can only tease players
about their mistakes.

Though the easy-going rookie
coach handles most drills and
scrimmages in practice, Priddle
makes all game substitutions. But
Baldacinni, who paints houses and

attends night classes when he's
not working with his players,
doesn't like to force the issue.
He's not interested in "jumping
on Priddle's case" because, he
explains, "If it wasn't for Fred,
there wouldn't be a soccer
program here."
At any rate, regardless of this
high-wire coaching act, the Card
booters have produced. The team
has already beat, tied and
marginally lost to such
nationally ranked teams as

Westmont, USF and San Jose
State. As for the future, only time**
will tell whether two heads are
better than one.

Kickers: The team right now is
in the throes of a terrible slump,
generating, no offense and getting
minimal defense ahead of goalie
Bruce Mosbacher. Wednesday,
they lost 4-0 to Canada College,
while yesterday, they bowed 3-0
to Santa Clara in the opening
round of the Menlo Invitational.
