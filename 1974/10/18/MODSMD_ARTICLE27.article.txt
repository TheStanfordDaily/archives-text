# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
Things didn't go so well for
our fearful forecaster last
week. His Stanford Cardinals
managed to tie instead of win,
and the Washington Huskies
completely collapsed. The
resultant 2-1-1 record put our
season reocrd at 15-2-2.
We think we might be able
to fatten that win column this
week. It's North-South time in
the Pacific Eight, which means
that the four California
crushers play the four
Northwest nothings, to use a
hackneyed expression. The
nothings won't come up with
anything.
USC-Oregon is nothing
short of a joke. The other three;
games could conceivably go
either way.
Washington State visits
UCLA. After last week, we
don't see UCLA as being much
a threat, because Dick Vermeil

does not seem like the
brightest coach of all time. But
UCLA could be coached by
Joe Kuharich and beat
punch less WSU.
Cat goes up to Oregon State
in what's billed as the battle
for first place. Neither team
will be up in first for long, but
we look for Cat to reach those
heady heights and move into
the AP's top 20 next week.
Finally, in the home game,
winless Stanford goes after
one. Despite a shortage of
running backs, the Cardinals
ought to over-power
Washington. Any team that
can't beat OSU can't beat
Stanford.
Predictions
USC 39, Oregon 7
UCLA 28, Washington St. 14
California 30, Oregon St. 24
Stanford 24, Washington 7
