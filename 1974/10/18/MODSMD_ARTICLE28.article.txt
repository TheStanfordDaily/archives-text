Nixon May Testify Soon
WASHINGTON Richard M. Nixon's lawyer said
yesterday the former president will probably be healthy
enough to testify at the Watergate cover-up trial in three
weeks or a month.
After hearing the optimistic report from Herbert J.
Miller, the attorney, U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica put
off any decision on Nixon's testimony for three weeks,
pending a new medical report.
Sirica said he preferred Nixon to make "an appearance
in open court," instead of answering questions under oath
at his San Clemente, Calif., estate.
VP's Wife Undergoes Breast Surgery
NEW YORK In an all but unbelievable coincidence,
Vice President-designate Nelson A. Rockefeller's wife,
Happy, had a cancerous breast removed yesterday just three
weeks after President Ford's wife underwent a similar
operation.
Doctors said preliminary examination indicated the
cancer had not spread, which would give Mrs. Rockefeller a
90 percent chance of recovery.
Rockefeller indicated that his wife's discovery of a
telltale lump in her breast was accelerated by the wide
publicity surrounding the removal Sept. 28 of Mrs. Betty
Ford's right breast. 1
Nixon Suit Seeks To Obtain Tapes
WASHINGTON Former President Richard M. Nixon
filed suit yesterday seeking to force the government to give
him possession and control of millions of tapes and
documents accumulated during his five-and-one-half years
in the White House. â™¦
Nixon alleged that the government has failed to live up
to an agreement for the swift transfer of his presidential
materials to California.
"Such records are still located at the White House and,
despite requests, have not at this time been sent to the
former president," the suit said.
Named as defendants are Arthur F. Sampson, head of the
General Services Administration; Philip W. Buchen, counsel
to President Ford; and H. Stuart Knight, director of the
Secret Service.
Nixon asked the court to order the three defendants not
to produce or disclose any of the presidential materials to
anyone other than himself.
On Sept. 6 Nixon and Sampson signed an agreement in
which the former president agreed to house all his
presidential materials with the GSA in facilities near
Nixon's San Clemente, Calif., home.
The suit alleged that Buchen interfered with Nixon's
rights under the agreement when he agreed not to transfer
any of the material without the prior approval of the
Special Watergate Prosecutor. Buchen's agreement with the

prosecutors was reached on Sept. 9.
House Compromises On Turkish Aid
WASHINGTON The head-to-head impasse between
President Ford and Congress over cutting off U.S. military
aid to Turkey was broken yesterday with approval of a new
compromise reportedly acceptable to Ford.
It was passed overwhelmingly by the House and then by
the Senate within hours after the House failed by only two
votes to override Ford's second veto of a congressional
Turkish aid cutoff.
The House approved the new compromise 101 to 33,
and the Senate sent it to Ford by voice vote.
The new compromise delays cutoff of the Turkish aid
until Dec. 10, providing Turkey sends no more
"implements of war" to its occupations forces on Cyprus,
does not enlarge these forces and continues to observe the
present cease-fire. The measure Ford vetoed earlier would
have cut off aid if Turkey sent any kind of equipment to
the Cyprus forces.
The compromise passed the House with little debate
after leaders announced it would not be vetoed by Ford.
Richard Burton To Wed Princess
LONDON Richard Burton said yesterday he plans to
marry Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia, a relative of the
British royal family and an old friend of Elizabeth Taylor.
"We are going to get married as soon as it is practicably
possible," the Welsh actor told newsmen outside his
London home.
"We have known each other casually for several years
and we met again three weeks ago," said Burton, divorced
from Miss Taylor in June after a stormy, 10-year marriage.
Daughter of Prince Paul of Yugoslavia and Princess Olga
of Greece, Princess Elizabeth is a second cousin of the heir
to the British throne, Prince Charles.
Oakland Takes World Series
OAKLAND The Oakland A's won their third
consecutive World Series championship last night, beating
the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-2 in the fifth game of the
baseball series.
The A's won the series four games to one, and,
ironically, in four of the five games the final score was 3-2.
Owned by controversial Charles O. Finley, the A's
started their championship string by beating Cincinnati in
seven games in 1972. Last year they defeated the New York
Mets, also in seven games.
