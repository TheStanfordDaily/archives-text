# FBI Report Awaited In Killing
## 
### 
Investigators in the Arlis Perry
murder case are awaiting word from
the FBI laboratories in Washington,
which are analyzing physical evidence
in the case.
They say they still have no
suspects.
Mrs. Perry was found dead in
Memorial Church early Sunday
morning. She had been molested with
two long altar candles that are among
the evidence sent to Washington.
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Capt.
Frank Mosunic said police hope to
have at least some preliminary reports
by today or early next week.
Stanford police Lt. Walt Konar gave
assurances yesterday that campus
security is being improved in the wake
of the murder. Night-time patrols,
including the use of plainclothesmen,
have been strengthened, he said.
Konar and Leah Kaplan, associate
dean of students, cited several safety
precautions those on or near the
campus should take late at night.
Fire alarms can be used to bring
help in an emergency. "If you feel that
you're being threatened, pull that
hook," Konar said, adding that
campus police and firemen would
respond to the alarm within two
minutes.
Students of either sex should try to
walk in groups late at night or at least

alert someone that they'll be on
campus alone, Konar said. He noted
that in the great majority of homicides
similar to the Perry murder, the victim
was alone. He suggested that students
living off-campus stay on well-traveled
roads if they ride or walk home.
Konar also urged victims of
previously unreported assaults in the
area to volunteer information on those
assaults. He believes they may hold a
key to the murderer's identity. Konar
also reiterated appeals for any
information bearing on the case.
Konar pledged "absolute
confidentiality" for those providing
tips and suggested that individuals

could provide information either
through an intermediary or
anonymously, if they wish.
Meanwhile, Bruce Perry, a
sophomore premedical student and
husband of the victim, has reportedly
left Stanford and returned to his
Bismarck, N.D., home.
Perry, who was never considered a
serious suspect in the case, passed a
polygraph test earlier this week that
positively eliminated him.
Reports said Perry didn't plan to
return to Stanford. He left shortly
after attending a memorial service for
his wife of two months in Memorial
Church earlier this week.
