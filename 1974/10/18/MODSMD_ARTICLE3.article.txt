# Chances Improving For Journalist Thai
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Nguyen Huu Thai, a South
Vietnamese journalist who has
accepted an invitation to fill the
ASSU's Guest Professorship, is now
one step closer to winning the privilege
of leaving South Vietnam.
A former political prisoner of the
Saigon government, Thai was recently
given his formal discharge from that
country's armed forces. Jim Regan,
chairman of the committee to invite
Thai to Stanford, explained:
"We've won two victories now, in
getting him released from jail and
discharged from the military. The next
victory we would seek is getting him
an exit visa."
In a letter dated Oct. 8, Thai said
he has no chance of winning an exit
visa.
"I made some attempts to get an
exit visa from the Ministry of Interior.
But only mentioning my name, these
people refuse already [to consider a
visa application]," Thai wrote. "It's
hopeless to get a visa."
Pessimistic
David Marr, director of the
Indochina Resource Center in
Berkeley and the recipient of Thai's
letter, was also pessimistic.
"I'm not personally optimistic that
he'll get a visa. It depends so much on
the political situation—how well
Stanford presents its case through
congressional contacts, and how
[Nguyen] Thieu [president of South
Vietnam] views the situation in
Vietnam. I wouldn't say his chances
are 50-50," Marr remarked.
Regan says his committee's next
move will be to write back to Thai.
"In our letter to Thai, there are two
things to be brought out. One, the
level of interest by the Stanford

community suggests we could try one
more effort to get official U.S. support
for the exit visa. And, we would ask
Thai if he thought it was worth it.
Entrance Visa
"Two, I am going to make again a
request I made of Thai over the
summer for an attestation of
journalistic expertise signed by the
editor of Dien Tin [the largest
newspaper opposing the Thieu
government]. This would be needed
for an entrance visa to this country,"
Regan elaborated.
Meanwhile, the committee will
contact Representatives Paul N.
McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park), Bella
Abzug (D-N.Y.) and Donald M. Fraser
(D-Minn.), who aided efforts to free
Thai while he was imprisoned.
Regan said that Thai's letter was
good news, since it indicates that Thai
now feels free to communicate with
Americans. In mid-July, Thai
suspended correspondence because he
felt his life was in danger.
"The letter is extremely
encouraging and very satisfying news,"
Regan stated. "If his request to be
discharged were denied, he might have
been sent to some frontier outpost.
Also, the letter gives us a chance to
ask our congressional friends to talk to
the State Department and the Ministry
of Interior in Saigon."
Though the chances of Thai's being
sent to a battlefront outpost have been
reduced, he is by no means completely
safe, Marr explained.
"Nobody in the Third Force is safe
as long as conditions under Thieu
remain unchanged," Marr said. "There
were three American newsmen who
were beaten up about four or five days
ago. The police have roughed up
others—they put a Buddhist nun in the
hospital."

Americans. In mid-July, Thai
suspended correspondence because he
felt his life was in danger.
"The letter is extremely
encouraging and very satisfying news,"
Regan stated. "If his request to be
discharged were denied, he might have
been sent to some frontier outpost.
Also, the letter gives us a chance to
ask our congressional friends to talk to
the State Department and the Ministry
of Interior in Saigon."
Though the chances of Thai's being
sent to a battlefront outpost have been
reduced, he is by no means completely
safe, Marr explained.
"Nobody in the Third Force is safe
as long as conditions under Thieu
remain unchanged," Marr said. "There
were three American newsmen who
were beaten up about four or five days
ago. The police have roughed up
others—they put a Buddhist nun in the
hospital."
Nguyen Huu Thai, a South
Vietnamese journalist who has
accepted an invitation to fill the
ASSU's Guest Professorship, is now
one step closer to winning the privilege
of leaving South Vietnam.
A former political prisoner of the
Saigon government, Thai was recently
given his formal discharge from that
country's armed forces. Jim Regan,
chairman of the committee to invite
Thai to Stanford, explained:
"We've won two victories now, in
getting him released from jail and
discharged from the military. The next
victory we would seek is getting him
an exit visa."
In a letter dated Oct. 8, Thai said
he has no chance of winning an exit
visa.
"I made some attempts to get an
exit visa from the Ministry of Interior.
But only mentioning my name, these
people refuse already [to consider a
visa application]," Thai wrote. "It's
hopeless to get a visa."
Pessimistic
David Marr, director of the
Indochina Resource Center in
Berkeley and the recipient of Thai's
letter, was also pessimistic.
"I'm not personally optimistic that
he'll get a visa. It depends so much on
the political situation—how well
Stanford presents its case through
congressional contacts, and how
[Nguyen] Thieu [president of South
Vietnam] views the situation in
Vietnam. I wouldn't say his chances
are 50-50," Marr remarked.
Regan says his committee's next
move will be to write back to Thai.
"In our letter to Thai, there are two
things to be brought out. One, the
level of interest by the Stanford

community suggests we could try one
more effort to get official U.S. support
for the exit visa. And, we would ask
Thai if he thought it was worth it.
Entrance Visa
"Two, I am going to make again a
request I made of Thai over the
summer for an attestation of
journalistic expertise signed by the
editor of Dien Tin [the largest
newspaper opposing the Thieu
government]. This would be needed
for an entrance visa to this country,"
Regan elaborated.
Meanwhile, the committee will
contact Representatives Paul N.
McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park), Bella
Abzug (D-N.Y.) and Donald M. Fraser
(D-Minn.), who aided efforts to free
Thai while he was imprisoned.
Regan said that Thai's letter was
good news, since it indicates that Thai
now feels free to communicate with
Americans. In mid-July, Thai
suspended correspondence because he
felt his life was in danger.

encouraging and very satisfying news,"
Regan stated. "If his request to be
