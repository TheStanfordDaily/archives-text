# Ford Says 'No Deal' Involved In Pardon
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Ford, in an unprecedented personal
appearance before a congressional
panel, said yesterday "there was no
deal, period, under no circumstances,"
in his pardon of former President
Richard M. Nixon.
Ford said that he granted the
pardon for the benefit of the nation,
not Nixon, and he is convinced he did
the right thing at the right time.
Ford said he hoped by coming
before the House judiciary
subcommittee and giving his account
of the pardon personally he had "at
least cleared the air" of the rumors
and suspicions that have circulated
about the pardon since he announced
it Sept. 8.
But most subcommittee members
said they still regarded many questions

as unanswered, and Chairman William
Hupgate (D-Mo.) said further hearings,
with other witnesses, might be held
after the November elections.
Rep. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.), author
of one of the articles of impeachment,
said more witnesses had to be called,
particularly former White House Chief
of Staff Alexander M. Haig, before
Congress and the nation could be
certain there was no deal involved in
the pardon.
Before submitting to brief
questioning by the subcommittee
members, Ford read for 45 minutes
from a prepared statement in which he
recounted to a nationwide radio-TV
audience the steps leading up to the
pardon.
He said a pardon was first
mentioned to him by Haig at a
meeting Aug. 1, a week before Nixon
resigned, as one of six courses of
action being considered in the White
House. The meeting was prompted by
the discovery that a tape Nixon had
been withholding from the courts
contained damaging evidence of his
knowledge of the Watergate cover-up,
Ford said.
Ford said the subject of a pardon
for Nixon was not brought up again
until his first news conference as
President on Aug. 28, when he was
advised to prepare for questions about
it. The questions came and Ford said
he would not make any decision until
he saw what the special prosecutor and
the courts would do.
Other than seeking assurances that
Nixon would accept a pardon, he set
no conditions on it, he said,
specifically not requesting a
confession. In answer to a question
later, he said he felt the acceptance of
the pardon was an admission of guilt
by Nixon. Â»
