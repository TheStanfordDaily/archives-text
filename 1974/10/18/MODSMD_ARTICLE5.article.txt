# Lyman Asks For Remedies
## C-15 Reviews Judicial Panel 
### 
Senior Kathy Cunningham was
elected chairman of the Committee of
15 (C-15) Wednesday in a closed
meeting of the group.
The C-15 was created by President
Richard Lyman in 1971 to devise a
new student judicial system.
The current system, the Campus
Judicial Panel, is an "interim" body
which has operated for three years
because the C-15 has been unable to
devise a replacement that satisfies
students, faculty and administrators.
The student body has never voted
to approve the CJP, which features a
voting majority of faculty members.
Meeting
Lyman called a meeting of the C-15
this week for the first time since 1973
after ASSU President Mike Herman
asked him to reconvene the group.
Lyman asked the C-15 "to review
the current [student judicial] system"
and recommend changes to remedy
any weaknesses it finds.
' "Some members of the committee
have been skeptical" about their
chances of coming up with an
acceptable alternative, Cunningham
said. "But we all realize we have a job
to do."
Cunningham, who said the group
chose her as sole spokesman, indicated
C-15 meetings in the immediate future
will be closed. "Having them open to
the press and public might be
detrimental to our inquiries,"
Cunningham said. She denied the
meetings were closed to prevent
student-faculty polarization, which has
occurred in the past.
"Everything that comes up now
will come out in the . future,"
Cunningham promised. She refused to
discuss any new proposals for a
judicial system.
At least one new proposal has been
submitted to the C-15. Herman, a
member of the committee, said last
week he was proposing an amended
version of a plan voted down by
students last autumn quarter.
That plan featured an eight-member
judicial body: four randomly selected
students, three teachers elected by the
Faculty Senate, and a chairman from
the law school who would vote only to
break a tie.
Majority
The student majority could have
been dissolved at any time by a two
thirds vote of the ASSU or Faculty
Senates, or by President Lyman.
Herman's new version of the plan is

"very complex" according to Dale
Snape, assistant dean of student affairs
and a member of the C-15. Snape said
it would act as "a taking off point" for
committee discussion.
Last spring student members of the
C-15 proposed a system that would
have created an all-student advisory
board. The board, after hearing a case,
would have made recommendations to
a dean.
But the C-15 never met to consider
the proposial.
Cunningham said the next two
meetings—not yet scheduled— will be
devoted to talking with past and
present members of the CJP. She said
the committee also plans to encourage

past "defendants and complainants" in
the University judicial system to send
in written statements" to shed some
light on the workings of the CJP.
The members of the C-15 are:
Susan Mackin, senior; Carol Mattax,
junior; M. Scott Smith, sophomore;
Randy Smith, law student; Mike
Herman, senior; Kathy Cunningham,
senior; Education Prof. Edward Begle;
Law Prof. William Cohen; Business
Prof. Harold Leavitt; English Prof.
Anne Mellor; Engineering Prof.
William Nix; Radiology Prof. Leslie
Zatz; Asst. Dean of Students Dale
Snape; Staff Associate Diane Harrison;
and James Siena, legal adviser to the
president.
