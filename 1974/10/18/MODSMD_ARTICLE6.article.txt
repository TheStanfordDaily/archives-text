# Degler Defends Women's History
## 
### CYNTHIA CIMA 
"Traditional history has been
concerned with men,, while speaking
grandly of 'people,' said History Prof.
Carl Degler last night in Tresidder
Union.
Degler's lecture, "Is There a History
of Women?" was part of the Themes
in Contemporary America lecture
series sponsored by the Tresidder
Program Board.
"Their [women's] past cannot be
subsumed under the history of men,"
Degler said. "They are different in
both roles and physiology."
Different Roles
The fact that the roles of men and
women have been differentiated
according to sex throughout history is
justification for the study of women's
history, according to Degler.
"Women have a different impact on
history, and history affects them
differently than it does men," Degler
said.
Degler cited new areas of interest in
the study of history which are directly
or indirectly related to women's
history â€”"the family, the working force,
reform movements, education, aspects
of social history."
History
Speaking to an audience of about
200 mostly women Degler
explained "there are people, many of
whom are historians, who do not
believe there is a history of women.
"They say that women have already
been depicted in history, as wives,
mothers, mistresses, or even as writers,
artists and reformers. But they have

been viewed almost as appendages to
men's history, been almost as men,
and compared to men's standards."
"Social changes that improve the
position of men often act the opposite
on women," Degler said, citing the rise
of the labor movement as an example.
"For many years organized labor
excluded women members and when
they were allowed in, it was in a
position clearly inferior.
"Even in the Socialist movement,
which proclaimed equality, there was a
sexual division of labor. Women were
expected to provide the food and
clean up after the meetings," Degler
said.
The "untold stories" of women's
history may drastically alter
conventional views of the past,
according to Degler.
"Whole historical interpretations of
a given event will have to be adjusted
to account for the influence of and on
women," he said, adding that women
as a "minority" in history are in the
unique position of accounting for half
of the population.
Little-Known
Degler offered some little-known
facts about women and abortions in
the 19th century to illustrate his
contention that history affects women
differently than men.
"The fertility rate in the United
States dropped 50 percent between
1800 and 1900. Some methods of
controlling births were obviously being
used," Degler said.
Abortion was the most effective
means of birth control during those

times, since the other most widely
used method, withdrawal, was so
dependent on the male, Degler said.
Even in the 1890s male doctors
were complaining that their female
patients felt no guilt at all about
having abortions, he said.
According to Degler, statistics
indicate that 75 to 90 percent of
criminal abortions during the late 19th
century were performed on married
women.
