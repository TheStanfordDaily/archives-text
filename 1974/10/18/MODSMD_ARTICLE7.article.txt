Head Tackling
Editor:
I read the Daily article on head
tackling (Oct. 16) with
considerable emotion. I was
particularly angered by San Jose
State's coach Darryl Rogers, who
said:
"Every kid who plays this
game knows there's an element of
risk. We teach the kids to hit with
the forehead so they can get ahold
of the man."
In view of the risks involved, it
would not be unfair to paraphrase
Roger's statement thus:
"It's not important if one of
my kids breaks his neck and dies.
The important thing is to stop the
man so that we can win games."
I am certainly glad that Coach
Christiansen does not share this
attitude.

Exorcist-Like Coverage
Editor:
On the front page of Monday's
Daily appears the paragraph:
"Dean of the Chapel Robert
G.H. Kelly, contacted by police
early yesterday morning, said he
viewed the body to see if he could
help identify it. He said the
woman was lying face up on the
floor, and was nude from the
waist down. One three-foot long
candle had been forced up her
vagina, while another was pushed
up her blouse and between her
breasts."
Wouldn't it have been
sufficient to report that she had
been molested? Is this kind of
sensational reporting really
necessary or appropriate? I can not
understand the motives of
either the reporter or the editors
who put this graphic description
in the paper. Why not expand the
story to a novel, like the Exorcist?

Biology Courses
Editor:
I'm rather upset and basically
disappointed with Stanford's
biology department. It's sad that
some occurrences are so difficult
to avoid and solve but please
follow the logic of the problem.
A professor wants to go on
leave and merits it. That's fine,
except he happens to teach two
courses which are needed by some
400 Stanford pre-meds to enter
med school. These students, those
now in Bio 21, can't possibly take
the courses, namely Bio 110 and
108 (vertebrate biology and
organismal development) until
completion of the 21, 22, 23 and
24 core has been accomplished,
which means they have to wait
until next year to do this.
But next year 110 and 108
aren't to be offered. OK, take
both as a senior you say. But
then, they don't plan to offer
108, only 110, with 108 being
offered the following year, when
these students "should" be in
their first year of med school.
This year's freshman class, who
would by then be juniors, would
also be unable to take these
courses, since 110 is a prerequisite
for 108, and 108 is the one being
offered. But they couldn't take
110 the previous year, because
they were busy with 21, 22, 23
and 24, which are the prerequisites
for 110 and could, of course, only
be taken then.
As a result, students attending
what is said to be one of the
country's best undergraduate
schools with a strong preparatory
program won't receive adequate
background both to succeed in
med school and maybe even to be
accepted.
Now I don't like that at all. I
think Dr. Normal Wessels should
take his leave; I don't deny him
the privilege as he probably
deserves it. But is it really so
impossible to find a respectable
replacement to instruct these
subjects? One professor said that
the biology department is
thinking about this but they'd
rather not teach a course than
teach it badly. Granted. But I still

can't believe that the department
head is the only one capable of
teaching them. I don't think the
department has looked hard
enough.
I write this mainly to inform
the current Bio 21 students and
those intending to take this course
because few, very few, know this
is happening. Where does this
leave us? Be aware of the
possibilities and think about it.
Put pressure on the department
because really, sometimes I think
some people don't care enough
about whether you receive the
education you need.

Pub Board Dispute
Editor:
Up until now, I have avoided
making my personal views on the
Chaparral dispute and attendant
controversies public, in the hope
that the Pub Board members
would be able to reach a fair and
equitable solution on their own.
Unfortunately, it has become
increasingly apparent that this is
not to be.
The fact of the matter is that
in this case, the Pub Board's
power is limited to determining
what publication has the right to
occupy that space in the Storke
Building. At its last meeting, the
board voted that the Chaparral
has ceased to publish, which is not
only untrue but irrelevant. The
question posed was not, "Is it
publishing?" but "Who ought to
have control of it?"
If the • board feels itself
competent to tell the University it
thinks one group or the other
should have control of the
Chaparral, then the board should
do so. If the board does not feel
competent to do so, it should get
the hell out of the issue and let
the ASSU, the University and the
competing groups slug it out. I
strongly oppose any attempt to
increase the Board's authority in
midstream through a rule change.
Not only will that fail to aid in
the solution of this problem, but
it will vest far more power in the
board than it has shown itself
capable of handling.
Right now, I am sick to death
of the foolishness displayed by all
parties concerned, the Pub Board
included. While this battle
continues, publications and
groups with a legitimate need for
space must make do with either
makeshift offices or no offices at
all, while the Chaparral office
remains vacant. The Publications
Board has a responsibility to do
something. The question of space
for the Live Oak and the Course
Review are urgent issues that must
be taken up now. While perhaps
not as immediate a problem, the
Women's News Service also needs
space, and I find it impossible to
justify the continuing debate over
the Chaparral when there is so
much else that needs to be done.

Coverage 'Degrading'
Editor:
In regard to your recent
coverage of the Memorial Church
murder of Arlis Perry, I seriously
question the necessity of
publicizing the bizarre details
involved in Mrs. Perry's death.
The Daily is to be commended
for its efforts to play down the
aspect of sexual molestation;
however I strongly feel that
further discretion should have
been used. The fact that she was
murdered is tragic enough in
itself; publishing such details only
serves to degrade the victim and
adds humiliation to the grief,
already suffered by loved ones.
Sunday morning Mrs. Perry
became the victim of a senseless
and tragic murder. Must she also
become the victim of further
degradation via the media? I think
not.

both as a senior you say. But
then, they don't plan to offer
108, only 110, with 108 being
offered the following year, when
these students "should" be in
their first year of med school.
This year's freshman class, who
would by then be juniors, would
also be unable to take these
courses, since 110 is a prerequisite
for 108, and 108 is the one being
offered. But they couldn't take
110 the previous year, because
they were busy with 21, 22, 23
and 24, which are the prerequisites
for 110 and could, of course, only
be taken then.
As a result, students attending
what is said to be one of the
country's best undergraduate
schools with a strong preparatory
program won't receive adequate
background both to succeed in
med school and maybe even to be
accepted.
Now I don't like that at all. I
think Dr. Normal Wessels should
take his leave; I don't deny him
the privilege as he probably
deserves it. But is it really so
impossible to find a respectable
replacement to instruct these
subjects? One professor said that
the biology department is
thinking about this but they'd
rather not teach a course than
teach it badly. Granted. But I still

can't believe that the department
head is the only one capable of
teaching them. I don't think the
department has looked hard
enough.
I write this mainly to inform
the current Bio 21 students and
those intending to take this course
because few, very few, know this
is happening. Where does this
leave us? Be aware of the
possibilities and think about it.
Put pressure on the department
because really, sometimes I think
some people don't care enough
about whether you receive the
education you need.

Pub Board Dispute
Editor:
Up until now, I have avoided
making my personal views on the
Chaparral dispute and attendant
controversies public, in the hope
that the Pub Board members
would be able to reach a fair and
equitable solution on their own.
Unfortunately, it has become
increasingly apparent that this is
not to be.
The fact of the matter is that
in this case, the Pub Board's
power is limited to determining
what publication has the right to
occupy that space in the Storke
Building. At its last meeting, the
board voted that the Chaparral
has ceased to publish, which is not
only untrue but irrelevant. The
question posed was not, "Is it
publishing?" but "Who ought to
have control of it?"
If the • board feels itself
competent to tell the University it
thinks one group or the other
should have control of the
Chaparral, then the board should
do so. If the board does not feel
competent to do so, it should get
the hell out of the issue and let
the ASSU, the University and the
competing groups slug it out. I
strongly oppose any attempt to
increase the Board's authority in
midstream through a rule change.
Not only will that fail to aid in
the solution of this problem, but
it will vest far more power in the
board than it has shown itself
capable of handling.
Right now, I am sick to death
of the foolishness displayed by all
parties concerned, the Pub Board
included. While this battle
continues, publications and
groups with a legitimate need for
space must make do with either
makeshift offices or no offices at
all, while the Chaparral office
remains vacant. The Publications
Board has a responsibility to do
something. The question of space
for the Live Oak and the Course
Review are urgent issues that must
be taken up now. While perhaps
not as immediate a problem, the
Women's News Service also needs
space, and I find it impossible to
justify the continuing debate over
the Chaparral when there is so
much else that needs to be done.

Coverage 'Degrading'
Editor:
In regard to your recent
coverage of the Memorial Church
murder of Arlis Perry, I seriously
question the necessity of
publicizing the bizarre details
involved in Mrs. Perry's death.
The Daily is to be commended
for its efforts to play down the
aspect of sexual molestation;
however I strongly feel that
further discretion should have
been used. The fact that she was
murdered is tragic enough in
itself; publishing such details only
serves to degrade the victim and
adds humiliation to the grief,
already suffered by loved ones.
Sunday morning Mrs. Perry
became the victim of a senseless
and tragic murder. Must she also
become the victim of further
degradation via the media? I think
not.

Head Tackling
Editor:
I read the Daily article on head
tackling (Oct. 16) with
considerable emotion. I was
particularly angered by San Jose
State's coach Darryl Rogers, who
said:
"Every kid who plays this
game knows there's an element of
risk. We teach the kids to hit with
the forehead so they can get ahold
of the man."
In view of the risks involved, it
would not be unfair to paraphrase
Roger's statement thus:
"It's not important if one of
my kids breaks his neck and dies.
The important thing is to stop the
man so that we can win games."
I am certainly glad that Coach
Christiansen does not share this
attitude.

Exorcist-Like Coverage
Editor:
On the front page of Monday's
Daily appears the paragraph:
"Dean of the Chapel Robert
G.H. Kelly, contacted by police
early yesterday morning, said he
viewed the body to see if he could
help identify it. He said the
woman was lying face up on the
floor, and was nude from the
waist down. One three-foot long
candle had been forced up her
vagina, while another was pushed
up her blouse and between her
breasts."
Wouldn't it have been
sufficient to report that she had
been molested? Is this kind of
sensational reporting really
necessary or appropriate? I can not
understand the motives of
either the reporter or the editors
who put this graphic description
in the paper. Why not expand the
story to a novel, like the Exorcist?

I'm rather upset and basically
disappointed with Stanford's
biology department. It's sad that
some occurrences are so difficult
to avoid and solve but please
follow the logic of the problem.
A professor wants to go on
leave and merits it. That's fine,
except he happens to teach two
courses which are needed by some
400 Stanford pre-meds to enter
med school. These students, those
now in Bio 21, can't possibly take
the courses, namely Bio 110 and
108 (vertebrate biology and
organismal development) until
completion of the 21, 22, 23 and

Building. At its last meeting, the
board voted that the Chaparral
has ceased to publish, which is not
only untrue but irrelevant. The
question posed was not, "Is it
publishing?" but "Who ought to
have control of it?"
If the • board feels itself
competent to tell the University it
thinks one group or the other
should have control of the
Chaparral, then the board should
do so. If the board does not feel
competent to do so, it should get
the hell out of the issue and let
the ASSU, the University and the
competing groups slug it out. I
strongly oppose any attempt to
increase the Board's authority in
midstream through a rule change.
Not only will that fail to aid in
the solution of this problem, but
it will vest far more power in the
board than it has shown itself
capable of handling.
Right now, I am sick to death
of the foolishness displayed by all
parties concerned, the Pub Board
included. While this battle
continues, publications and
groups with a legitimate need for
space must make do with either
makeshift offices or no offices at
all, while the Chaparral office
remains vacant. The Publications
Board has a responsibility to do
something. The question of space
for the Live Oak and the Course
Review are urgent issues that must
be taken up now. While perhaps
not as immediate a problem, the
Women's News Service also needs
space, and I find it impossible to
justify the continuing debate over
the Chaparral when there is so
much else that needs to be done.

Coverage 'Degrading'
Editor:
In regard to your recent
coverage of the Memorial Church
murder of Arlis Perry, I seriously
question the necessity of
publicizing the bizarre details
involved in Mrs. Perry's death.
The Daily is to be commended
for its efforts to play down the
aspect of sexual molestation;
however I strongly feel that
further discretion should have
been used. The fact that she was
murdered is tragic enough in
itself; publishing such details only
serves to degrade the victim and
adds humiliation to the grief,
already suffered by loved ones.
Sunday morning Mrs. Perry
became the victim of a senseless
and tragic murder. Must she also
become the victim of further
degradation via the media? I think
not.

Head Tackling
Editor:
I read the Daily article on head
tackling (Oct. 16) with
considerable emotion. I was
particularly angered by San Jose
State's coach Darryl Rogers, who
said:
"Every kid who plays this
game knows there's an element of
risk. We teach the kids to hit with
the forehead so they can get ahold
of the man."
In view of the risks involved, it
would not be unfair to paraphrase
Roger's statement thus:
"It's not important if one of
my kids breaks his neck and dies.
The important thing is to stop the
man so that we can win games."
I am certainly glad that Coach
Christiansen does not share this
attitude.

Exorcist-Like Coverage
Editor:
On the front page of Monday's
Daily appears the paragraph:
"Dean of the Chapel Robert
G.H. Kelly, contacted by police
early yesterday morning, said he
viewed the body to see if he could
help identify it. He said the
woman was lying face up on the
floor, and was nude from the
waist down. One three-foot long
candle had been forced up her
vagina, while another was pushed
up her blouse and between her
breasts."
Wouldn't it have been
sufficient to report that she had
been molested? Is this kind of
sensational reporting really
necessary or appropriate? I can not
understand the motives of
either the reporter or the editors
who put this graphic description
in the paper. Why not expand the
story to a novel, like the Exorcist?

Biology Courses
Editor:
I'm rather upset and basically
disappointed with Stanford's
biology department. It's sad that
some occurrences are so difficult
to avoid and solve but please
follow the logic of the problem.
A professor wants to go on
leave and merits it. That's fine,
except he happens to teach two
courses which are needed by some
400 Stanford pre-meds to enter
med school. These students, those
now in Bio 21, can't possibly take
the courses, namely Bio 110 and
108 (vertebrate biology and
organismal development) until
completion of the 21, 22, 23 and
24 core has been accomplished,
which means they have to wait
until next year to do this.
But next year 110 and 108
aren't to be offered. OK, take
both as a senior you say. But
then, they don't plan to offer
108, only 110, with 108 being
offered the following year, when
these students "should" be in
their first year of med school.
This year's freshman class, who
would by then be juniors, would
also be unable to take these
courses, since 110 is a prerequisite
for 108, and 108 is the one being
offered. But they couldn't take
110 the previous year, because
they were busy with 21, 22, 23
and 24, which are the prerequisites
for 110 and could, of course, only
be taken then.
As a result, students attending
what is said to be one of the
country's best undergraduate
schools with a strong preparatory
program won't receive adequate
background both to succeed in
med school and maybe even to be
accepted.
Now I don't like that at all. I
think Dr. Normal Wessels should
take his leave; I don't deny him
the privilege as he probably
deserves it. But is it really so
impossible to find a respectable
replacement to instruct these
subjects? One professor said that
the biology department is
thinking about this but they'd
rather not teach a course than
teach it badly. Granted. But I still

can't believe that the department
head is the only one capable of
teaching them. I don't think the
department has looked hard
enough.
I write this mainly to inform
the current Bio 21 students and
those intending to take this course
because few, very few, know this
is happening. Where does this
leave us? Be aware of the
possibilities and think about it.
Put pressure on the department
because really, sometimes I think
some people don't care enough
about whether you receive the
education you need.

Pub Board Dispute

Up until now, I have avoided

Chaparral dispute and attendant

that the Pub Board members

increasingly apparent that this is
not to be.

particularly angered by San Jose
State's coach Darryl Rogers, who
said:
"Every kid who plays this
game knows there's an element of
risk. We teach the kids to hit with
the forehead so they can get ahold
of the man."
In view of the risks involved, it
would not be unfair to paraphrase
Roger's statement thus:
"It's not important if one of
my kids breaks his neck and dies.
The important thing is to stop the
man so that we can win games."
I am certainly glad that Coach
Christiansen does not share this
attitude.

Exorcist-Like Coverage
Editor:
On the front page of Monday's
Daily appears the paragraph:
"Dean of the Chapel Robert
G.H. Kelly, contacted by police
early yesterday morning, said he
viewed the body to see if he could
help identify it. He said the
woman was lying face up on the
floor, and was nude from the
waist down. One three-foot long
candle had been forced up her
vagina, while another was pushed
up her blouse and between her
breasts."
Wouldn't it have been
sufficient to report that she had
been molested? Is this kind of
sensational reporting really
necessary or appropriate? I can not
understand the motives of
either the reporter or the editors
who put this graphic description
in the paper. Why not expand the
story to a novel, like the Exorcist?

Biology Courses
Editor:
I'm rather upset and basically
disappointed with Stanford's
biology department. It's sad that
some occurrences are so difficult
to avoid and solve but please
follow the logic of the problem.
A professor wants to go on
leave and merits it. That's fine,
except he happens to teach two
courses which are needed by some
400 Stanford pre-meds to enter
med school. These students, those
now in Bio 21, can't possibly take
the courses, namely Bio 110 and
108 (vertebrate biology and
organismal development) until
completion of the 21, 22, 23 and
24 core has been accomplished,
which means they have to wait
until next year to do this.
But next year 110 and 108
aren't to be offered. OK, take
both as a senior you say. But
then, they don't plan to offer
108, only 110, with 108 being
offered the following year, when
these students "should" be in
their first year of med school.
This year's freshman class, who
would by then be juniors, would
also be unable to take these
courses, since 110 is a prerequisite
for 108, and 108 is the one being
offered. But they couldn't take
110 the previous year, because
they were busy with 21, 22, 23
and 24, which are the prerequisites
for 110 and could, of course, only
be taken then.
As a result, students attending
what is said to be one of the
country's best undergraduate
schools with a strong preparatory
program won't receive adequate
background both to succeed in
med school and maybe even to be
accepted.
Now I don't like that at all. I
think Dr. Normal Wessels should
take his leave; I don't deny him
the privilege as he probably
deserves it. But is it really so
impossible to find a respectable
replacement to instruct these
subjects? One professor said that
the biology department is
thinking about this but they'd
rather not teach a course than
teach it badly. Granted. But I still

can't believe that the department
head is the only one capable of
teaching them. I don't think the
department has looked hard
enough.
I write this mainly to inform
the current Bio 21 students and
those intending to take this course
because few, very few, know this
is happening. Where does this
leave us? Be aware of the
possibilities and think about it.
Put pressure on the department
because really, sometimes I think
some people don't care enough
about whether you receive the
education you need.

Pub Board Dispute
Editor:
Up until now, I have avoided
making my personal views on the
Chaparral dispute and attendant
controversies public, in the hope
that the Pub Board members
would be able to reach a fair and
equitable solution on their own.
Unfortunately, it has become
increasingly apparent that this is
not to be.
The fact of the matter is that
in this case, the Pub Board's
power is limited to determining
what publication has the right to
occupy that space in the Storke
Building. At its last meeting, the
board voted that the Chaparral
has ceased to publish, which is not
only untrue but irrelevant. The
question posed was not, "Is it
publishing?" but "Who ought to
have control of it?"
If the • board feels itself
competent to tell the University it
thinks one group or the other
should have control of the
Chaparral, then the board should
do so. If the board does not feel
competent to do so, it should get
the hell out of the issue and let
the ASSU, the University and the
competing groups slug it out. I
strongly oppose any attempt to
increase the Board's authority in
midstream through a rule change.
Not only will that fail to aid in
the solution of this problem, but
it will vest far more power in the
board than it has shown itself
capable of handling.
Right now, I am sick to death
of the foolishness displayed by all
parties concerned, the Pub Board
included. While this battle
continues, publications and
groups with a legitimate need for
space must make do with either
makeshift offices or no offices at
all, while the Chaparral office
remains vacant. The Publications
Board has a responsibility to do
something. The question of space
for the Live Oak and the Course
Review are urgent issues that must
be taken up now. While perhaps
not as immediate a problem, the
Women's News Service also needs
space, and I find it impossible to
justify the continuing debate over
the Chaparral when there is so
much else that needs to be done.

Coverage 'Degrading'
Editor:
In regard to your recent
coverage of the Memorial Church
murder of Arlis Perry, I seriously
question the necessity of
publicizing the bizarre details
involved in Mrs. Perry's death.
The Daily is to be commended
for its efforts to play down the
aspect of sexual molestation;
however I strongly feel that
further discretion should have
been used. The fact that she was
murdered is tragic enough in
itself; publishing such details only
serves to degrade the victim and
adds humiliation to the grief,
already suffered by loved ones.
Sunday morning Mrs. Perry
became the victim of a senseless
and tragic murder. Must she also
become the victim of further
degradation via the media? I think
not.
