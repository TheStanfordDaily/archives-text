GUESS WHO'S
COMING
TO DINNER?
You. If you'd like to, that is. We have some
mouth-watering temptations that will insure
that, having succumbed once, you're likely to
want to do it again. Like,
* a succulent lamb chop with mint jelly,
* a delicately seasoned three - egg omelette,
a heap of crisp, golden-brown fried chicken,
* a tender, juicy, grilled-to-perfection STEAK.
Well, you can have those things - right here on
campus. THE COMMONS has extended its hours
to serve you dinner as well as breakfast and lunch.
THE COMMONS
