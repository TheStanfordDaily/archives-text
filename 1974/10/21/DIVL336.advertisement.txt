At NSA, our success depends on yours.
Engineers will find work which is performed
nowhere else ~ devices and systems are
constantly being developed which are in
advance of any outside the Agency. As an
Agency engineer, you will carry out research,
design, development, testing and evaluation
of sophisticated, large-scale crypto
communications and EDP devices using the
latest equipment for advanced research
within NSA s fully instrumented laboratories.
Computer Scientists participate in systems
analysis and systems programming related to
advanced scientific and operational
applications. Software design and develop
ment is included, as well as support in hard
ware design, development and modification
Mathematicians define, formulate, and solve
complex communications-related problems
Statistical mathematics, matrix algebra, and
combinatorial analysis are but a few of the
tools applied by Agency mathematicians.
Opportunities for contributions in computer
sciences and theoretical research are also
offered.
Linguists are engaged in a wide variety of
translation, transcription, analysis and
documentation projects Fluency in speaking
is not essential, but knowledge of idiomatic,
colloquial and dialectal variations is desirable
Experience in Slavic. Near Eastern, and
Oriental languages is particularly valuable.

may even train you in an entirely new
language.
At NSA, we are responsible for designing
and developing secure/invulnerable
communications and EDP systems to transmit,
receive and analyze much of our nation s most
vital information The advancing technologies
applied in this work are such that they will
frequently take you beyond the known and
accepted boundaries of knowledge.
Consequently, your imagination and resource
fulness are essential qualifications for
success
