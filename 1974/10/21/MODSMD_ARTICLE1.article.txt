# Ex-POW Attempts To Oust McGovern
## Vietnam War Issue Resurfaces In South Dakota Senate Race 
### JIM WASCHER News Analysis 
George McGovern is spending most of his time these
days trying to make the voters of South Dakota forget that
he ran for President two years ago. McGovern's opponent in
his bid for re-election to the Senate is doing his best to help
them remember.
Acknowledging that his bid for the presidency had done
"widespread damage" to him at home, McGovern says "I
never mention that election publicly in South Dakota.
People here would regard it as rubbing their noses in it."
But the South Dakota senatorial race this year is
essentially a mini-referendum on the main issue raised by
McGovern during his 1972 campaign: the war in Vietnam.
This is almost predictable since his opponent is retired Air
Force Lt. Col. Leo K. Thorsness, who spent six years in a
North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp.
And Thorsness remembers the numerous times he and
other POWs were forced by their captors to listen to
McGovern's anti-war speeches. "The Viet Cong repeated
over and over that time and American sentiment were on
their side," Thorsness recalls, "and we couldn't holler back
across that ocean for the protesters to stop."
But McGovern holds a slightly different view of his own
role in the last years of the war. Thorsness says that shortly
after he was repatriated, McGovern told him: "You know,
of course, Colonel, if it hadn't been for me, you and your
friends would still be in prison."
Campaign Issues
Aside from the "new politics" issue of the war, however,
the McGovern-Thorsness contest has centered on such "old
politics" concerns as campaign spending, experience and

basic ideology.
Thorsness charges that the McGovern campaign has
"spent about $2.5 million. What it amounts to, is he's
trying to buy his Senate seat." McGovern, on the other
hand says "no one's going to buy an election in South
Dakota."
A McGovern aide concedes that the senator will spend as
much as $1.5 million in his effort to win a third term. The
Thorsness campaign is expected to spend $500,000.
Previously, the most a single candidate had spent in a South
Dakota senatorial race was $419,000.

For his part, McGovern has pointed an accusing finger at
the sources of Thorsness' campaign funds. A UPI analysis
compiled earlier this month indicated that nearly all of the
31 contributions of $lOOO or more that Thorsness had
received from individuals had come from out of state.
As of Sept. 1, McGovern had received only 10
contributions of over $lOOO from individualsâ€”in state or
out. (He did, however, receive $340,000 in surplus funds
from various 1972 state presidential campaign committees.)
In addition to campaign financing, McGovern has
emphasized his seniority on the Senate Agriculture
Committee, where he is second in line for the chairmanship.
Since nearly one-fourth of South Dakota's populace is on
the farm, McGovern says "We need all the horses we can get
on the Agriculture Committee."
While Thorsness admits that "seniority is important," he

says "it depends on what you do with what you have.
Senator McGovern is the third biggest spender in the United
States Senate."
Basically, Thorsness believes that McGovern's
"philosophy and the state of South Dakota's philosophy
are not the same." The ex-POW is "in a hurry to get to
Washington because there are so many bills I must vote
against."
A 23-year veteran of the Air Force, Thorsness resigned
his commission a year ago to challenge McGovern. While in
the service, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, the
Distinguished Flying Cross and the Silver Star. He flew 93
bombing missions over North Vietnam before being shot
down in 1967. Thorsness' daughter, Dawn, is a Stanford
sophomore who has taken fall quarter off to campaign for
her father.
McGovern Favored
At this point, observers rate McGovern as the favorite in
the race, despite a 27,000-voter edge for the Republicans in
party registration.
Thorsness, who led early in the campaign, appears to
have been hurt by President Ford's pardon of Richard
Nixon, by Ford's role in scrapping a grain and corn sale to
the Soviet Union and by the President's proposal for a five
percent income tax surcharge on the middle and upper
classes.
McGovern lost the presidential race in South Dakota,
trailing Richard Nixon by 55-45 percent margin. But, even
if South Dakotans didn't want to see George in the White
House, it now seems that they will tolerate him in the
Senate for six more years.
