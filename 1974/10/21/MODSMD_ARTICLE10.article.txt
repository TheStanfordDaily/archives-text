# Republicans Need Paul McCloskey
## 
### Rich Jaroslovsky 
This week's Political Idiocy Award goes to
the campaign of Santa Clara Mayor Gary
Gillmor, the Democratic nominee to oppose
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park)
in the 12th Congressional District.
The Gillmor campaign earned the award
by virtue of an article in its campaign
newsletter distributed on campus this
weekend. The article is headlined,
"Republicans Need Gillmor To Save Two
Party System." It goes downhill from there.
Now, you might think that in the middle
of what could be an historic Democratic
sweep, the last thing a good Republican
wanting to save his party should do would be
to vote Democratic. Ah, but then you would
be wrong, say the Gillmorites.
The newsletter quotes a radio executive
named Keith Scott, who is "proud" of the
fact he's voted Republican in every election
since 1952, about his formation of a group
called "Republicans for Gillmor." Mr. Scott,
it seems, is exercised because McCloskey
keeps getting Democratic voters (mostly
Stanford students) to reregister Republican
for the primaries and vote for him over
"legitimate" (read "conservative")
Republicans like Royce Cole (in 1972) and J.
Gordon Knapp (this year).
New Voters
Because McCloskey keeps attracting these
new voters tp the party, says Mr. Scott, he is

somehow thwarting "a true two party
system." Thus, to get rid of McCloskey and
purge his turncoats from the party, he
reasons, "real" Republicans ought to vote for
Gillmor this year. The "real" Republicans
can then, presumably, nominate one of their
own, and turn around and oust Gillmor in
1976. This last statement isn't included in
the article— after all, it is Gillmor's
newsletter— but it's implicit.
There are a few problems with Mr. Scott's
analysis, though. For example, it doesn't
seem to matter too much to him that a fair
number of those new Republicans stay
Republican— in fact, it seems, that's one of
the problems. The types of people
McCloskey has attracted into the party don't
hold Mr. Scott's right-wing views.
Conservative Control
He isn't so much worried about the
survival of the two party system as he is
about the conservative wing's; control over
the Republican Party. Horror of horrors,
McCloskey has attracted some new blood into
the party— and that new blood is diluting the
impact of the conservatives.
Perhaps more amusing is Mr. Scott's
implicit hope that "legitimate Republicans"
could beat Gillmor, or almost any other
Democrat, in this district. Fact of the matter
is that not only Gillmor, but every other
Democratic primary candidate, was pulling
for the "legitimate Republican" Knapp to

dump McCloskey in the Republican primary
this year.
Another Democratic candidate, who later
lost to Gillmor, analyzed it this way during
the primary: "The reason this district is
Republican, has stayed Republican, is
because of Pete McCloskey period. Any
conservative Republican that beats him is
gonna get his ass kicked in November by any
Democrat. The reason I'm running is because
Knapp might beat McCloskey. If Knapp wins,
I'm as good as elected right now. If McCloskey
wins the primary, I roll over and play dead.
It's about as simple as that."
As William Ross has pointed out (Daily,
Oct. 11), the second point isn't necessarily
true, since McCloskey has both moved a bit
rightward and lost his biggest "liberal"
issues—Nixon and Vietnam.
But Gillmor has appeared unable or
unwilling to take advantage of McCloskey's
situation, and instead of mounting a real
campaign has put forward half-witted pap
like "Republicans for Gillmor." Mr. Scott's
sour-grapes, cut-off-the-nose-to-spite-the-face
effort can at least be understood as a feeble
attempt to rationalize a visceral dislike of
McCloskey. Gillmor's campaign, for giving
circulation to Mr. Scott's views, can only be
laughed at for its stupidity.
