# Governor Race Offers Real Choice
## 
### Rachelle Marshall 
If you read the papers, the race
for governor between Edmund G.
Brown, Jr. and Houston Flournoy
seems a lackluster affair, with a
pipesmoking, middle-aged
moderate Flournoy on one side
and an arrogant young moderate
Brown on the other, and no great
difference between them on the
issues. Republicans, desperately in
need of a GOP governor during
the 1976 presidential primaries,
are promoting their Candidate as
detached and professorial, above
party labels and untouched by
Watergate.

In fact, however, the
gubernatorial campaign presents
voters with a crucial choice. There
are profound differences between
the two candidates and all they
stand for. Two of Flournoy's
most ardent supporters are former
Stanford Trustee David Packard
and Gov. Ronald Reagan, both of
whom Flournoy has welcomed on ;
the campaign trail. Packard was
Nixon's deputy secretary of
defense during the period when
the -U.S. was dropping more
bombs on Vietnam in a month
than Germany dropped on
England during all of World War
11.

He stuck by Nixon almost as
long as Rabbi Korff only a few
months ago he took full page ads
in newspapers across the country
attacking those who "scream for
impeachment" for endangering
the security of the United States.
Lately he has warned that unless
Flournoy is elected, the state will
take a "disastrous" turn to the
left.

Packard has also called Reagan
"the greatest governor in my
memory." While Flournoy was
serving as state comptroller under
Reagan, Reagan was
systematically waging war against
the poor, the elderly, the
handicapped and the very young.
He regularly vetoed
appropriations for crippled
children, tax relief and benefits

for the old and disabled, school
lunch programs, anti-smog
legislation, programs for the
educationally handicapped,
establishment of a state public
defender, aid to prisoners and the
mentally retarded, unemployment
benefits for farm workers and day
care centers for migrant children.
In 1973 he eliminated the entire
$250,000 budget for the Coastline
Conservation Commission but flew
around the west in a personal jet
that cost the taxpayers $525 an
hour.
Ruling Fought

For months Reagan fought
against a court ruling that ordered
an increase in aid to dependent
children for the first time since
1966. He then authorized a new
form for welfare recipients
composed of 19 pages of
questions. But he happily signed a
bill to increase race track revenues
by $8.3 million a year.
Reagan's term as governor has
been a record of indifference to
the needs of ordinary people and
cruelty to those most in need of
help. With Flournoy we might
well have four more years of such
callousness. Reagan recently
assured reporters that he and
Flournoy see eye to eye: "He has
expressed his agreement with the
philosophy of our
administration," Reagan said, and
Flournoy did not demur.
Name Recognition

Flournoy has accused Brown
of circumventing the issues but in
fact the opposite is true. Brown's
name did not hurt him in the
primaries Jbut a major factor in his
election victory was his steadfast
support of Proposition 9, the
measure to curb the power of
lobbyists and open campaign
contributions to public scrutiny.
Labor unions threatened to
withhold their support but Brown
fought hard for passage of the
proposition, the only major
politician of either party to do so.
Fortunately he and Common
Cause, the People's Lobby

carried the measure to one of the
most lopsided victories in
California history.
Currently Brown is facing
down the construction unionfc and
southern California agri-business
which has contributed heavily to
Flournoy by opposing the
damming of the Stanislaus River.
He has challenged the oil industry
by calling for an end to the oil
depletion allowance and faster
development . of geothermal
energy. He has promised to
remove Reagan's political hacks
and oil company executives from
the Air Resources Board and to
replace them with people
committed to preserving the
environment. He has also
promised to make the Public
Utilities Commission and the
Dept. of Consumer Affairs

responsive to public rather than
private interests.
As California secretary of state,
Brown functioned with efficiency
and integrity. He prosecuted
violators of existing election laws
and supported measures to enable
more, people to vote. He has an
old fashioned belief that
democracy will work if fairness
and honesty can be preserved. His
record is one of concern for good
government? and opposition to the
kind of official corruption that
led to Watergate. Brown's election
won't bring the millenium to
California; it' will bring a measure
of compassion, a determination to
solve pressing problems, and a
dedication to honest and open
government in Sacramento.
