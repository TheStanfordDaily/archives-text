# Grades Impede Learning
## 
### Kevin Brannon 
Being a "typical" 3.55 student, I am rather
puzzled over the recent controversy concerning
Stanford grade point averages. The Ad Hoc Panel
examined 200 grade reports from one quarter and
determined that the typical Stanford GPA is 3.55.
So what?

It would seem to me that these results ought to
be examined in the light of relativity. I don't need a
survey to inform me that I am not an exceptionally
successful student on the basis of my GPA. Judging
from the experiences of my acquaintances, I am
pretty average. However, I do consider those whose
grades are appreciably better to be more successful,
at least in attaining high marks. Common sense
would seem to rule out deciding that because the
average value is high, grades are not an indication of
performance. Within Stanford, GPA's do vary and
can be used to show whatever it is that they are
supposed to show.
Look Beyond GPA
Outside of Stanford, I doubt that Stanford
GPA's are any less meaningful than those of other
schools. Each of us could have attended a
university where a 4.0 GPA would be fairly easily
attainable. Had I attended MIT, for example, my
freshman grades would have been sealed even from
myself, unless I wanted to hassle considerable red

tape to see them. Anyone seeking an idea of the
academic quality of a university needs to look
beyond the GPA's of its students. Likewise, anyone
seeking an idea of the academic ability of a student
needs to look beyond his GPA.
Validity Questioned
How valid are these GPA's in any case? Even if
D's and Fs were reinstated and "grade grubbing"
tactics such as Pass/No Pass options were
eliminated we would still retain the problems of
easy-grading professors and tough-grading ones,
bright sections and dull ones, and easy classes and
difficult ones. I see this diversity as positive and
desirable. I look forward to taking Prof. Kennedy's
20th century American history course this spring,
in part because of his challenging policy on grades.
But such a policy would hardly be fitting in a class
such as the Math Workshop, which endeavors to
remove all pressure from those who have difficulty
in mathmatics.
Even in the best of circumstances, grades are
often an impediment to true learning and our
mixed system certainly has major flaws. But
positive action for learning will not come about by
putting more emphasis on grades.

tape to see them. Anyone seeking an idea of the
academic quality of a university needs to look
beyond the GPA's of its students. Likewise, anyone
seeking an idea of the academic ability of a student
needs to look beyond his GPA.
Validity Questioned
How valid are these GPA's in any case? Even if
D's and Fs were reinstated and "grade grubbing"
tactics such as Pass/No Pass options were
eliminated we would still retain the problems of
easy-grading professors and tough-grading ones,
bright sections and dull ones, and easy classes and
difficult ones. I see this diversity as positive and
desirable. I look forward to taking Prof. Kennedy's
20th century American history course this spring,
in part because of his challenging policy on grades.
But such a policy would hardly be fitting in a class
such as the Math Workshop, which endeavors to
remove all pressure from those who have difficulty
in mathmatics.
Even in the best of circumstances, grades are
often an impediment to true learning and our
mixed system certainly has major flaws. But
positive action for learning will not come about by
putting more emphasis on grades.

Being a "typical" 3.55 student, I am rather
puzzled over the recent controversy concerning
Stanford grade point averages. The Ad Hoc Panel
examined 200 grade reports from one quarter and
determined that the typical Stanford GPA is 3.55.
So what?

It would seem to me that these results ought to
be examined in the light of relativity. I don't need a
survey to inform me that I am not an exceptionally
successful student on the basis of my GPA. Judging
from the experiences of my acquaintances, I am
pretty average. However, I do consider those whose
grades are appreciably better to be more successful,
at least in attaining high marks. Common sense
would seem to rule out deciding that because the
average value is high, grades are not an indication of
performance. Within Stanford, GPA's do vary and
can be used to show whatever it is that they are
supposed to show.
Look Beyond GPA
Outside of Stanford, I doubt that Stanford
GPA's are any less meaningful than those of other
schools. Each of us could have attended a
university where a 4.0 GPA would be fairly easily
attainable. Had I attended MIT, for example, my
freshman grades would have been sealed even from
myself, unless I wanted to hassle considerable red

tape to see them. Anyone seeking an idea of the
academic quality of a university needs to look
beyond the GPA's of its students. Likewise, anyone
seeking an idea of the academic ability of a student
needs to look beyond his GPA.
