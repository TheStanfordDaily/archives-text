# Ideals Live On

### Gunther Nagel 
Murder in Memorial Church is
a horrible reminder that even the
House of the Lord is not an 1
inviolable sanctuary for prayer
and contemplation. The brave
efforts of numberless men and
women of good will and the
marvels of scientific achievement
have not eradicated the demon of
evil from the earth.
Despite present sorrow, this is
not the time to despair.
Unfortunately, human nature has
not changed and probably never
will, but its positive side can and
should be encouraged and no one
is better qualified to tell us how
than our own Jane Stanford.
After her husband's death in
1893 it was Jane's religious faith
that gave her the strength to
continue building and keep the
doors of the University open, in
spite of the twin destructive
forces of financial panic and a
government suit of over $l5
million against the Stanford
estate.
Essential Place
Always in the forefront of Jane
Stanford's mind was the essential
place religion should hold in the
education of youth; yet it must be
voluntary on the students' part
and inspired by example, not rote.
The keystone of this goal was the
Memorial Church. After visiting
the newly finished Chapel in
September 1902 Benjamin Ide
Wheeler, president of the
University of California, told Mrs.
Stanford: "... It is a direct
contribution to the influences
which make for good in the great
community of which we are all
members ..."
In reply Mrs. Stanford wrote:
" ... In thinking of it and the
University at large, I cannot but
feel that the education which the
students are receiving is
secondary, if a religious and
spiritual influence is not exerted
over them all to develop the soul
germ which lies dormant in so
many ..." -
To her friend, J.C. Branner,
professor of geology, she was
more explicit: sound principles
and decency were more important
than any amount of learning
"That, Mr, Branner," Jane
declared, "is why I am so much
more interested in the church on
the campus than I am in your
precious rocks."
Central Location
Jane Stanford placed the
Church in the central position on
the Quad because she believed
that the ethical and spiritual
foundations of the University
were more essential than its
material needs. <
Today the world is faced with
twin perils financial disaster and
moral collapse, of which the latter
is by far the most ominous.
But, it would be cowardly to
give up. We at Stanford, both old
and young, can do our part by
rededicating ourselves to the
ideals which Jane Stanford so
splendidly willed us.
