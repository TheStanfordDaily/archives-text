## Five Months Later, All's Quiet At 1466 54th St. But Neighbors Still Remember The SLA Shootout 
### GLENN GARVIN 
LOS ANGELES It was quiet along 54th
Street last week. The distant cries of children,
playing in a recreation center across Compton
Avenue, echoed faintly in the background.
But that was all.
Most of the folks along 54th Street were
more interested in what the Dodgers were up
to in the World Series, just like nearly
everyone else in Southern California.
And the few who looked out their
windows and saw three strangers standing
amid the sunlit ruins of the house at 1466
54th Street probably thought nothing of it.
That's probably the most obvious way
54th jStreet has changed. Because five months
ago a group of strangers in that same house
attracted a great deal of attention so much
that it finally got back to the Los Angeles
Police Department.
And the police, on a warm, sunny May day
much like the one last week, eventually ended
up trading thousands of rounds of gunfire
with the strangers and finally blew up the
house on 54th Street.
Now, walking through the wreckage of the
house, it's hard to believe that six members of
the Symbionese Liberation Army died there.
Or that they were ever there to begin with.
"It's so small, so small," one visitor
murmured as she looked at the burned,
littered foundation which is just about all
that's left of the house.
Perhaps Deliberate
Sometime during the gunfight last May, the
house caught on fire: perhaps a hot tear gas
canister touched off some ammunition,
perhaps a Molotov cocktail inside the house
was hit by gunfire, or perhaps (as some 54th
Street residents say) the police deliberately set
the tiny structure ablaze.
Whatever result was the
same: the house burned to the ground.
Visitors now can look at the broken remnants
of a front wall, a few charred beams, and a
foundation ankle-deep in torn-off remnants of
Polaroid snapshots, the legacy of the hundreds
of sightseeing tourists who come to take
pictures of the house.

That's all there is.
In the warm sunlight, what's left of 1466
54th Street looks just about like any other
house that was torn down. But a closer look
around the neighborhood gives away its
bloody secret.

The houses on either side were also gutted
by flames; now they stand, burned-out hulks
of tombstones for the SLA. They even bear
epithets, written, apparently, by
neighborhood admirers. On one house there is
a poem, carefully written in white paint:

Another wall features a terse testament to
the terror and awe the tiny group inspired: It
took 500 cops SLA.
Littered, Painted
Inside, the houses are littered with wine
bottles and spray-painted boasts of
neighborhood gangs. Broken kitchen utensils
and shattered plumbing fixtures are scattered
everywhere.
The previous tenants left in a hurry.
The rest of the block has its scars, too.
Several houses are pockmarked with
bulletholes. Down Compton Avenue someone
has painted a seven-headed cobra, symbol of
the SLA.
But despite the very visible evidence of
what happened on 54th Street, people are
beginning to forget.
"Some people still haven't seen that," one
man told a friend, gesturing toward the
remnants of the house where the SLA
members died. "And it's been a year now."
A visitor reminded him it was barely five
months since the shootout.
"Seems like a lot longer," he said,
scratching his head in puzzlement.
"A whole lot of people still come,
especially on Sunday," he said. "They're just
sight-seeing. Folks come out here on the
sidewalk and sell things to 'em. They didn't
know those white girls was in there," he
added, switching topics suddenly to police

and the shootout.
"You don't treat millionaires' daughters
like that. They thought everyone inside was
Negro."
A police car cruised slowly down 54th
Street, turned, and pulled alongside the
visitors. "Come to see the burned-out house?"
one patrolman inquired. After a moment of
chit-chat, he drove on with parting words of
encouragement: "Hope you beat UCLA."
"To protect and to serve," said the side of
his car.
A block down Compton Avenue, sightseers
can buy a souvenir SLA keychain, with a tiny
photo of the shootout inside. Some 34
different photos are available, explained M.L.
Leverette, owner of the photo shop.
"We still do a fair business," Leverette said.
"We sold quite a few right at the time it
happened."
'Baked Bodies'
Enlargements of the photos are plastered
to Leverette's huge picture windows facing
the street. Captions speak colorfully of
"baked bodies" and "steamed flesh."
Leverette shot the pictures himself.
"I was the only one to get the whole
story," he assured his patrons. "None of the
news photographers got anything like what I
got .... There's a lot of things that I didn't
do that I don't understand now. Like why
didn't I shoot a few hundred feet of sound
film?"
Leverette plans to package his photos in a
book, which he says will be "the only
documented story of what actually
happened."
"You won't be able to miss it," he said.
"It'll be the only book to say documented on
it."
Leverette got his pictures, he said, because
he was at the house waiting when police came.
"I knew they [the SLA] were there before
the police knew it. But I didn't want to get
involved, you know," he said.
On Compton Avenue a neon sign over the
Pentcostal Apostolic Faith Church blinks
"Jesus Saves." Across 54th Street from the
burned-out houses a dog lies sleeping in the
sun. From inside a few houses comes the low
murmur of the World Series game.
And on 54th Street, life goes on.

The SLA had a lot to say
did ya get the message? they left today.
The world's in struggle between rich and
poor,
this fact we can't ignore.
The politicians all get their way,
no matter what the people say.
The leaders of the country are mostly
corrupt,
to the needs of the people their ears are
shut.
Fillin' their pockets as fast as they can,
they won 't even listen to the workin' man.
They got so much money but they're never
content,
lam talkin' about the government.

LIFE GOES ON It's been five months since the shootout on 54th Street, even longer since
Patty Hearst's kidnaping caused constant media attention at the Hearst home (above). Now, all
is quiet at Hillsborough and on 54th Street.
