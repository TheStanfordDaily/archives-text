# Ex-ASSU VP Runs For Congress
## 
### BOB MOULTON 
If there is such a thing as the
idealism of youth, then former
ASSU vice president and Stanford
alumnus Adam Levin appears to
be a master of it. Barely 25, Levin
is the Democratic candidate for
Congress in the 12th
Congressional District of Union
County, N.J.
By winning the Democratic
primary in June with 83 percent
of the vote, he has become the
third youngest person ever to run
for Congress.
Levin is running against
42-year-old incumbent Matthew
Rinaldo, a liberal Republican,
who was first elected in 1972.
Also three conservative
Republicans are running as
Independents.
Levin, former chairman of the
ASSU Board of Special Events, is
enthusiastic about his chances.
"I'm dead even with Rinaldo now
and there's 30 percent
undecided," he said last week.
Disaffection With Ford
"The great disaffection with
Ford's leadership is helping
considerably," he added. "There
is a serious anti-incumbency spirit,
and people are ecstatic if you
don't promise them anything.
"The race will be a squeaker;
I'll probably win by one percent,"
he predicted.
Levin said that the three
independents in the race will aid
his chances of . winning "because
they can only cut further into the
strength of my opponent."
The district contains 80,000
Democrats, 70,000 Republicans
and 110,000 Independents.
Levin, who calls Rinaldo "the

master of the press release," cited
several major differences between
them.
"My opponent is against public
financing of campaigns, bi-lingual
education and has a very poor
record when it comes to the
welfare of senior citizens and the
poor," he said.
Although he said Rinaldo has
stressed "openness," Levin said he
finds it ironic that his opponent
has "refused to debate, disclose
his private holdings or take a real
stand on any issue."
Since unemployment is eight
percent statewide and 9.1 percent
in his district, Levin said he
believes the state of the economy
is the critical issue of the
campaign.
Number One Enemy
"The number one enemy is not
inflation, but recession," he said.
"I support a current bill by Rep.
Rodino which would concentrate
flood relief and other public
works projects into areas where
there is more than seven percent
unemployment."
Levin, who considers himself a
moderate, opposes any surtax for
those earning less than $25,000.
He said he would combat
recession by limiting oil depletion
allowances and by forbidding oil
companies to recover 90 percent
of their drilling expenses when
they strike oil.
Levin claimed that eliminating
*the intangible drilling expense
alone would increase federal
treasury revenues by $4 billion.
In addition, Levin said he
would cut the military budget by
$5-10 billion, enforce anti-trust
laws, place substantial taxes on

banks, oil companies and
corporations and have the federal
government take control of the
railroads.
Among other issues, Levin
supports "speedy" ratification of
the Equal Rights Amendment, the
Supreme Court's decision on
abortion, national health care
insurance, more mass
transportation funding and
conditional amnesty for draft
resisters.
He said, however, he was very
opposed to the complete pardon,
calling it a "corruption of the
judicial process."
Levin termed the amnesty
question "a real toughie," because
most veterans are violently
opposed to unconditional

amnesty.
"It took courage for most
C.O.'s to complete their
alternative service, so asking the
others to do up to two years of
similar work is not unfair," Levin
said.
"I would, however, like to see
all the dishonorable discharges
subject to an honest and searching
review," he added. "I'm
concerned with the exiles being
discriminated against by future
employers."
Levin estimated his personal
wealth at $300,000 and said he is
strongly committed to campaign
reforms.
"The current laws are a
travesty because they don't deal
with extreme abuses of the

franking privilege," he said.
Levin's political career began in
1968, when he became a field
worker for Robert Kennedy's
presidential bid.
Levin was widely known
for a series of spring rock concerts
he organized through the Special
Events Board.
University Vice President for
Development Ken Cuthbertson, a
long-time friend, said, "Adam
always had a political sensitivity
to the big issues. He is quite bright
and has always expressed a
concern for the whole of society.
Adam is a most generous person,
as his gift of Levin Field to the
University in 1972 demonstrates."
Levin gave $20,000 to the
University for the field.
