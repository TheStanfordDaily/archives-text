# Tormey, Gregorio Vie For State Senate Seat
## 
### MARK FUNK 
In a race which has been significant
so far for its lack of important
campaign issues, the Arlen
Gregorio-James Tormey Jr. contest for
the state Senate is finally beginning to
heat up.
Incumbent Gregorio (D-San
Mateo), a four-year veteran of the
state Senate, is running for the first
time in the re-apportioned 10th
Senatorial District, which includes
parts of San Mateo and Santa Clara
counties. His legislative record includes
initiating more than 70 bills which
have become law. In his campaign, he
is calling for radical overhaul of the
state government.
Republican Tormey, a San Mateo
lawyer and member of the San Mateo
Community College Board of Trustees,
is running against Gregorio's record.
Tormey has accused Gregorio of
"playing politics" with the state labor
code as it applies to state school
personnel and reneging on campaign
pledges to return financial
contributions made by special-interest
groups.
Unicameral Legislature
Gregorio and Tormey are farthest
apart politically on the issue of a
unicameral state legislature. The
concept, which Gregorio has presented
before a Senate committee, was
endorsed recently by Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Edmund G.
Brown Jr.
Gregorio's plan calls for a single
legislative body of 99 members. Each

member would represent 200,000
persons. Currently, each state senator
represents 500,000 constituents, more
than a U.S. congressman does. At
present, Nebraska is the only state
with a unicameral legislature.
"Not only will a unicameral
legislature cut down on the size of our
districts, but it will save state
taxpayers almost $4O million a year,"
Gregorio claims.
Gregorio also says this type of
legislature would expedite legislation.
