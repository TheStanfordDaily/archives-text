# Tormey, Gregorio Vie For State Senate Seat
## 
### MARK FUNK 
In a race which has been significant
so far for its lack of important
campaign issues, the Arlen
Gregorio-James Tormey Jr. contest for
the state Senate is finally beginning to
heat up.
Incumbent Gregorio (D-San
Mateo), a four-year veteran of the
state Senate, is running for the first
time in the re-apportioned 10th
Senatorial District, which includes
parts of San Mateo and Santa Clara
counties. His legislative record includes
initiating more than 70 bills which
have become law. In his campaign, he
is calling for radical overhaul of the
state government.
Republican Tormey, a San Mateo
lawyer and member of the San Mateo
Community College Board of Trustees,
is running against Gregorio's record.
Tormey has accused Gregorio of
"playing politics" with the state labor
code as it applies to state school
personnel and reneging on campaign
pledges to return financial
contributions made by special-interest
groups.
Unicameral Legislature
Gregorio and Tormey are farthest
apart politically on the issue of a
unicameral state legislature. The
concept, which Gregorio has presented
before a Senate committee, was
endorsed recently by Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Edmund G.
Brown Jr.
Gregorio's plan calls for a single
legislative body of 99 members. Each

member would represent 200,000
persons. Currently, each state senator
represents 500,000 constituents, more
than a U.S. congressman does. At
present, Nebraska is the only state
with a unicameral legislature.
"Not only will a unicameral
legislature cut down on the size of our
districts, but it will save state
taxpayers almost $4O million a year,"
Gregorio claims.
Gregorio also says this type of
legislature would expedite legislation.

"Right now, we have jealousies
plaguing the Assembly and the Senate.
Good bills are being killed. We are
having trouble getting good legislation
through," he explains.
Tormey counters that men, not
legislative institutions, are the key to
good legislation: "I don't hear too
many people criticizing the basic
institutions of state government, just
the people in it.
"We need a two-leveled legislature,"
Tormey adds. "One assembly has to
hear the daily, relevant needs of the
people. It must' be responsible to
them. The other must occupy itself
with long-range planning for both
business and government. If we
squelch that system, man will revolt."
Streamlining
Gregorio has authored many bills
intended to streamline existing state
governmental institutions. The bills
call for open committee meetings,
mandatory roll call voting and full
disclosure of financial holdings for
public officials.
Gregorio has also sponsored
campaign reform legislation which he
says will lessen the influence of
special-interest money in elections.
When Gregorio decided to run again
earlier this year, he said his
organization would not accept
contributions from special-interest
groups.
Tormey charges Gregorio with
accepting contributions from members
of the San Francisco Opera Company.
The Company recently received funds

from a committee on fine arts of
which Gregorio is chairman.
Garden Party
As evidence, Tormey cites a
$25-a-couple garden party for
Gregorio at which an Opera Company
soprano, Jacquelyn Benson, sang.
"The senator is a hypocrite,"
Tormey claims. "Either that, or his
staff is running the show, which is a
possibility.
Gregorio laughs at the accusation,
saying that Benson came to the party

because "she believes in some of the
things we are working for." He says
tickets were sold by his campaign
staff, not through members of the
Opera Company.
Tormey's campaign has been
directed toward Gregorio's stand on
educational issues. He has attacked
Gregorio's voting record in education.
He has criticized Gregorio's support of
a bill which Tormey contends "allows
school personnel the right to strike in
the public schools." The bill, A83245,
died in committee.
