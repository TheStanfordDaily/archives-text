# Hoover Institution Senior Fellows Criticize Economic Summit Results
## 
### 
Two Hoover Institution senior fellows, Thomas
G. Moore and Rita Ricardo Campbell, expressed
disappointment at the outcome of President Ford's
economic "summit meetings" which they attended.
Moore, whose suggestions for change drew wide
support among fellow economists, said much of the
momentum for relief from inflation may be lost as
a result of the President's proposals.
Instead of moving to deregulate transportation,
with a potential annual saving of $4 to $8 billion,
Ford asked Congress to appoint a commission to
study the problem, Moore noted.
Campbell, who attended the minisummit on
health and welfare, expressed regret that the
President disregarded the advice of professional
economists at this session.

Economists, unaffiliated with provider or
consumer groups, agreed on a variety of measures,
such as relaxing licensing requirements for

paramedics, Campbell noted.
But the welfare lobby, doctors and hospital
administrators, career government bureaucrats and
consumer groups strongly resisted any proposals
which would cut any dollars out of health,
education and welfare programs, she said.
Campbell added that the pressure generated by
the welfare lobby at this minisummit was directly
responsible for the President's proposal to ask
middle- and upper-income groups to bear the brunt
of the anti-inflation fight.
Moore, a former staff economist with the
President's Council of Economic Advisers, said that
while economists tended to agree on
micro-economic problems, they tended to disagree
on macro-economic programs, such as the proper
level of the money supply and its impact on
unemployment.
