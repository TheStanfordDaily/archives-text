## Dog Days May Be Over At Last-Cards Win 
### TIM FERGUSON 
The Indian Summer had receded behind a
depressing blanket of gray, the crowd size had
shrunk from previous highs as the team remained
winless and the opponents were the once-proud but
now uninviting Washington Huskies.
Signs around Stanford Stadium Saturday
pointed to the dog days of Cardinal football.
Hardly did they foreshadow what occurred.
Capitalizing on breaks for the first time this season,
Stanford soundly trounced Washington, 34-17, to
stake firm claim as a Rose Bowl contender.
All six Cardinal scores came after Husky
miscues, of which there were plenty. Washington
fumbled five times, losing two, and threw four
interceptions. Penalties were rampant in a game
Washington coach Jim Owens called "ragged."
First error by the visitors came on their opening
drive, when quarterback Denny Fitzpatrick, a
surprise starter, fumbled on his own 48. Linebacker
Gordy Riegel recovered to set up Stanford's first
TD drive.
Quarterback Mike Cordova went immediately to
the air, hitting Eric Test for 13 yards. Three plays
later, tight end Brad Williams drew a pass
interference call at the Husky 10, which led to
Scott Laidlaw's one-yard touchdown dive on
third-and-goal.
Played 'On Guts'
Laidlaw, who had missed last week's practices
with rib bruises, "played on guts more than
anything," Card coach Jack Christiansen said.
Stanford's leading rusher picked up 34 yards on 10
carries, second on the team to Sig Ostrom. Ostrom
had his best game of the season with 14 rushes for
52 yards.
On their next drive, the Cardinals used a key
personal foul call to gain a first down on the Husky
31. Cordova immediately found Bill Singler two
steps in front of his defender for a touchdown toss.
The play, and the game as well, effectively
demonstrated Cordova's competence at a time
when many were questioning it. The big
quarterback completed 23 of 37 for 284 yards and
three touchdowns and, according to Christiansen,
called 75 percent of Stanford's plays. He was
named offensive player-of-the-game for the third
time this season.
"Mike did a good job today," said tight end
Williams. "He was a lot calmer in there. He had
complete control of everything."
Moderate Praise
Coach Chris, who stood by Cordova as others
called for his replacement, was more moderate in
praise. "I thought Cordova threw well most of the
time. He tends to stand in the pocket too long,
then when he gets out he throws off balance
sometimes. Those are times he grips the ball too
tight and throws ... like a pitching machine."
Owens blamed his decimated pass defense on
the lack of an effective rush. "We've been able to
get pretty good pressure this season but Cordova
could have lit a cigar back there a couple times.
They ran some good routes, but you certainly have
to pressure any good passer."
The first of two interceptions by defensive
player-of-the-game Paul Skrabo put the Cards on
their own 41 late in the second quarter, after
Washington had moved within 14-7. A 10-play
drive ended with tight end Ted Pappas snagging a
10-yard TD throw just 21 seconds before the half.
Rare Interception
Washington's first drive of the second half ended
in just three piays. Middle guard Drew Palin gained
a rare interception when the ball bounced off a
Card defender.
"All of a sudden it popped up and I was right
there," said Palin. "It's a lineman's dream, but I
wish they would have given me some room to run
it." The not-so-fleet Palin lost three yards.
Stanford moved from the Washington 41 to a
32-yard field boal by Mike Langford.
Chris Rowland replaced Fitzpatrick at
quarterback for the Huskies, and after two failed
Washington drives the Cards made their first big
mistake.

Running back Don Stevenson fumbled at the
Stanford 19 on his first play in the game. Rowland
scored on a keeper two plays later.
Dave Tenn then fumbled on the Card 28 while
returning the ensuing kickoff. The Huskies were
stifled and could get only a 39-yard Steve Robbins
field goal, bringing them within 24-17.
"It got a little scary there when Washington
came back," Christiansen said. "We put some kids
in we wanted to have a chance to play. Stevenson
was nervous and fumbled the ball. We probably
shouldn't haye given him the ball on the first play."
But Ray Anderson put an end to the Huskies
when he sprung by Stevenson's block, returned the
next kickoff from his own end zone to the
Washington 13. Cordova passed to Test for a
touchdown three plays later.
As the Cards marched inexorably toward their
first victory, one Washington fan expressed the
hopelessness of the Husky faithful. Dick Crews,
assistant to UW's director of development, said,
"This is like dissecting a cadaver."
For Christiansen's Cards, the season still is very
much alive. "We'd like to think we can play with
anyone," said Chris. "We've thought that all along.
We just haven't proved it."
While the Cards still may not have proved
exactly that, they have at least shown they can win
a football game. And that's a mighty big start.

Cardinal Notes: Husky fullback Robin Earl, a
sophomore whom Stanford tried to recruit, gained
104 yards Saturday. At 6-4, 255, "he's as big as
[Roger] Stillwell," Christiansen said ... Owens,
whose 18-year coaching career may be near its end,
was near tears when reviewing the game with
reporters. After the interview, he retreated to
solitude a crushed man . . . "77% and benched"
read a sign under the scoreboard, referring to
Stanford's most dissatisfied QB .

Mike Cordova ...
His Best Game


It was a rough Saturday at Stanford Stadium as 198 yards in
penalties were assessed during the Cards' win over Washington.
Below, a Stanford player fumbles (though after the whistle) upon
being crunched by Dan Lloyd (50) and Mark Kreutz (26). Above,
