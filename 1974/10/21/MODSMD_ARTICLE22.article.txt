# Washington Unimpressed By Cards
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
When Michigan beat Stanford
two weeks ago, the prevailing
mood of the Stanford locker
room was that the Wolverines
weren't all that good.
Washington players, after their
34-17 loss to Stanford Saturday,
expressed similar sentiments
about their conquerors.
The Husky defense found little
of excellence in the Card
offense—other than quarterback
Mike Cordova. For example,
cornerback Roberto Jourdan said,
"Their receivers were
slow—especially Test. Singler's all
right speed-wise. But there was
nobody we really had to worry
about."

Defensive end Eugene Sanders
said "All they have is that
quarterback [Cordova]. Other
than that their guards got off well
up front, that's about it."
And weak safety A1 Burleson,
who led the Huskies with nine
tackles, summed up the prevailing
mood: "Stanford really wasn't
that good. Cordova's a good
quarterback, but the others didn't
impress me. But then again we
didn't impress too many people
either."

More disturbing than these
put-downs are the accusations
levied by defensive tackle Dave
Pear, touted as a All-American
candidate. Pear was put out of the
game with a leg injury, and was
bitter about it. "I was rushing
center and being triple-teamed
when I was injured. One of their
guards gave me a cheap shot, but I
don't know who it was."

The Husky offense, which
rolled up 371 yards, wasn't
impressed, either. "Stanford ain't
nothing," guard Charles Jackson
said bluntly.

Jackson, who battled
All-Americans Roger Stillwell and
Pat Donovan in the trenches, was
not exactly impressed with the
pair. "We figured we had a pretty
good offensive line and we
weren't scared of their line. I
don't know who made them
[Stillwell and Donovan]
All-Americans/ I think they're
overrated as hell."

Fullback Robin Earl, who
netted 104 yards for a 6.1
average, added, "I don't think
their defensive line was that
good."

If Stanford isn't that good,
why did it win? Husky coach Jim
Owens had an answer. "I thought
both teams played well in streaks.
Our team hung in there but that
kickoff return [Ray Anderson's
87 yarder in the third quarter]
took the strength out of our
resurgence."

Although Anderson's return
inspired the Cards, he wasn't
happy with his performance. "I
think everyone found out I'm not
too fast. I wasn't too happy with
it, I felt I should have gone all the
way," Anderson said.
