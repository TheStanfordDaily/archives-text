# Pac-8 Roundup
## Favored Cal Schools Almost Fall 
### 
The Pacific Eight's teams from
California, who were expected to
breeze against opponents from the
hinterlands of the Northwest, all
won this Saturday.
But they certainly had to work
to do it.
Both UCLA and California
needed last quarter defensive
brilliancies to save their wins,
while USC, though not as
seriously threatened, had a tough
time getting past Oregon.
UCLA, playing its second L.A.

Coliseum night game in a row,
again pulled out one of those
miracles that must be part of the
Coliseum lease.
With a new quarterback, John
Hopkins, at the helm, Washington
State stayed close to the Bruins
throughout. In the final stanza,
WSU, trailing 17-13, had a
first-and-goal on the UCLA one.
Four times WSU rushed up the
middle. Four times it failed. So
UCLA pulled the game out to
extend its winning streak over the

Cougars to eight games.
California, meanwhile, barely
salvaged a 17-14 win over Oregon
State. The Bears' "Bart" offense
broke down in the seoend half at
Corvallis so the Bears stayed close
throughout the game.
OSU drove to the California
seven yard line with 23 seconds
left and a fourth-and-goal. The
Beavers unsuccessfully tried a
field goal which would have tied
the game. But Cal was penalized
for roughing the kicker.
With the ball now on the four,
OSU decided to go for the win.
But Cal's Paul Von Der Maider
stopped the play cold, and Cal
had five straight wins for the first
time since 1952.
The Bears, though ineligible for
TV or the Rose Bowl, are still tied
for the league lead.
That other team tied for the
lead, USC, beat Oregon in Eugene
16-7 on the strength of three
Chris Limahelu field goals. The
Trojans had little other offense,
aside from Anthony Davis, who
gained 160 yards in 38 carries.
Oregon's rookie coach, Don
Read, expressed satisfaction at the
performance of his defense. USC
mentor John McKay, meanwhile,
said "If we play that badly we
don't have the right to go to any
kind of bowl."

In this week's Pac-8 action,
Stanford travels to Washington
State, UCLA visits California,
Oregon meets Washington in
Seattle and USC hosts Oregon
State.

Corvallis so the Bears stayed close
throughout the game.
OSU drove to the California
seven yard line with 23 seconds
left and a fourth-and-goal. The
Beavers unsuccessfully tried a
field goal which would have tied
the game. But Cal was penalized
for roughing the kicker.
With the ball now on the four,
OSU decided to go for the win.
But Cal's Paul Von Der Maider
stopped the play cold, and Cal
had five straight wins for the first
time since 1952.
The Bears, though ineligible for
TV or the Rose Bowl, are still tied
for the league lead.
That other team tied for the
lead, USC, beat Oregon in Eugene
16-7 on the strength of three
Chris Limahelu field goals. The
Trojans had little other offense,
aside from Anthony Davis, who
gained 160 yards in 38 carries.
Oregon's rookie coach, Don
Read, expressed satisfaction at the
performance of his defense. USC
mentor John McKay, meanwhile,
said "If we play that badly we
don't have the right to go to any
kind of bowl."

The Pacific Eight's teams from
California, who were expected to
breeze against opponents from the
hinterlands of the Northwest, all
won this Saturday.
But they certainly had to work
to do it.
Both UCLA and California
needed last quarter defensive
brilliancies to save their wins,
while USC, though not as
seriously threatened, had a tough
time getting past Oregon.
UCLA, playing its second L.A.

Coliseum night game in a row,
again pulled out one of those
miracles that must be part of the
Coliseum lease.
With a new quarterback, John
Hopkins, at the helm, Washington
State stayed close to the Bruins
throughout. In the final stanza,
WSU, trailing 17-13, had a
first-and-goal on the UCLA one.
Four times WSU rushed up the
middle. Four times it failed. So
UCLA pulled the game out to
extend its winning streak over the

Cougars to eight games.
California, meanwhile, barely
salvaged a 17-14 win over Oregon
State. The Bears' "Bart" offense
broke down in the seoend half at
Corvallis so the Bears stayed close
throughout the game.
OSU drove to the California
seven yard line with 23 seconds
