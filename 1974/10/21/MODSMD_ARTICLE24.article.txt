# Cal Beats Stanford Poloists
## 
### BOB KUSTEL 
With one NCAA championship
under its belt already, California's
water polo team appears
unstoppable in its march
toward number two as Cal rolled
over a tough Stanford team
Saturday, 11-7.
Led by Dean Anderson, the
Cards threatened to upset the
awesome Bears. The aggressive
senior scored one goal and made a
sparkling assist to Stan Johnson in
the first quarter, which ended in a
2-2 deadlock.
But the brutal Bears outscored
Stanford 4-1 in the second quarter
and never looked back, going into
the locker, room at the half
leading 6-3.
Anderson added two more
goals in the second half, while
John Paul Roberts, Tom Elson,
and Rick Johannsen rounded out
the scoring with one each.'
"We just coughed up the ball
too many times," said coach Art
Lambert, "and our passes were
off, too." An improvement in
ball-handiing is undoubtably a key
to future Cardinal success, and
they hope to improve on it for
next week's return match with
UCLA. '
Pete Cutino, the Bears' amiable
head coach, praised Stanford's
effort, noting that the team had
"improved 300 percent" since
Cal's 9-2 rout over the Cards two
weeks ago in the Northern
California Tournament. He. of
course, knows that his is the team
to beat, and rates Stanford as the
fourth best team in the country,
preceeded by UC-Irvine and
UCLA.

How did Cal manage ,-ttf "put
together such a truly awesome
waterpolo power? The Bears
boast, at. last count, eight
Ail-Americans, ("We don't put
too much emphasis on that,"
notes Cutino) and several
world-class players.
"Unfortunately, it didn't come
overnight," says Cutino. "We've
put an awful lot of work into our
program."
The work has certainly paid
off, and there appears to be no
end in sight. Besides a group of
red-shirts which could probably
beat any team in the country,
three talented freshmen (two of
whom scored goals on Saturday)
add a most important factor of
depth to the Cal team.
For the Cards, each game is
crucial in their bid to make the
NCAA Championships, especially
next Friday's matchup with
UCLA (5-4 victors over the Cards
last week in Los Angeles).
The home pool advantage
should help Stanford, who
desperately need a victory over
the Bruins to have any hope at all
of earning a berth in the
championships.
