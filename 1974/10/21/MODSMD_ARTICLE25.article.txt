# Harriers Second To Cal
## Sandoval Wins Stanford Meet 
### MIKE SHEPHERD 
Tony Sandoval's 200 yard
victory led Stanford to a second
place finish in the Stanford
Invitational Saturday at the golf
course. California took first place
in the meet, placing six runners in
the top 20, paced by Brad Duffey
who took second in 29:21.6.
The scoring went: California
45, Stanford 54, Oregon State 66,
West Valley Track Club 79 and
San Jose State 113.
Sandoval's first place finish in
28:56.6 was backed up by the
other two members of the big
three, Mark McConnell and Jack
Bellah who finished fifth and
sixth with times of 29:41 and
29:42 respectively.
After these three, however, the
best Stanford could do was 21st,
verifying Bellah's comment before

the race that "We need fourth and
fifth men."
Coach Marshall Clark was
"very pleased with our overall
performance" pointing out that,
"Oregon State is a fine established
team." One of the keys to Oregon
State's success is Greg Kimball,
probably the best freshman
runner on the West Coast. He is
hampered by a severe case of
tendonitis in his ankle, and
probably should not have run. He
finished 60th in the meet and was
hobbling as he crossed the finish
line.
Stanford has improved over the
past few weeks, beating the West
Valley team it lost to in the
season opener, but still has
finished a close second two meets
in a row. Sandoval ran an
excellent race Saturday, especially

in the middle legs, slowing down
only on the final mile. His
performance was even more
impressive, as he is just coming off
a foot injury.
The top three runners have
proven their ability to run with
anybody, but in order for the
team to do well in the big meets
later in the season, a couple of
runners will have to emerge from
the pack.
It might be Frank Boutin, who
has run suprisingly well this year,
or Art Brown, or freshman Stacy
Geiken, but the help must come
from someone to make Stanford a
serious contender in the Pacific
Eight.
