# A 						Long Week For Booters
## 
### DAN PYNE 
Halftime at the Menlo
Invitational soccer tournament.
Stanford is down 1-0 to Santa
Clara. A referee and a balding,
middle-aged spectator stand in
front of the bleachers, each with
one foot up on the first row of
seats. The ref removes his black
cap and shakes his head.
"These guys got shellacked
yesterday by Canada," he says.
"Stanford?"
"Four-nothing."
"To CanadaV The bald man
shakes his head.
"And UCLA beat them last
Saturday. Same score."
"Stanford's supposed to be
pretty good. Whafs happened to
them?"
BERKELEY It had been a
long week before Stanford played
the California soccer team here
Saturday, and the Cardinals
received no reprieve. With the
help of what is beginning to look
like a plague of strange officiating,
the Stanford booters lost to Cal
2-1.
At Canada College on
Wednesday, the Cardinals were
expected to get back on the
winning track after losing to
UCLA last weekend. Something
backfired; and the Cardinals lost
4-0.
"The sky fell in," said head
coach Fred Priddle. Stanford
outshot Canada 19-15, he said,
but "our shots were just not as
hard as they should have been."
To make matters worse, the
Cardinals lost the services of Jim
Melame'd, who went out with a
sprained ankle.
SCU 3, Stanford 0
Priddle promised a "shake-up"
for Thursday's game with Santa
Clara. He kept his work, moving
Phil Wright back on defense,
putting Glenn Cristofori and Skip
Pfeiffer on the forward line, and
shifting people in and out all
game.
Stanford still did not generate
a scoring offense, displayed
somewhat less than awesome
defense, and lost, 3-0.
Varsity coach Bert Baldacinni
offered no excuses.

"Santa Clara has a good team."
He paused, then added, "When
Stanford starts actively recruiting
soccer players it will be able to
beat teams like UCLA and Santa
Clara."
All of Santa Clara's goals came
on short shots, the first a head-in,
the second from the right side of
the penalty area, and the third a
break-away up the middle.
Stanford 2, Menlo 1
In the consolation game against
Menlo on Friday, something was
done, the Cardinal offense and
defense came alive and won the
game, 2-1.
Both goals were unassisted;
Glenn Cristofori scored the first,
and Bob Bonaparte put in the
second.
Santa Clara, meanwhile, was
trounced by USF in the
championship game, 5-2.
Cal 2, Stanford 1
At Berkeley, Stanford looked
good. The first period was
scoreless, and although Cal had
eight shots and the .field was
lumpy, Stanford played a solid,
ball-control game.
In the second half, the Cardinal
defense, led by Wright, Mack
Taylor, Robby Robb and Marty
Glickfield, all but eliminated the
Cal offense, allowing only two
shots. ' Unfortunately, both of
them were goals.

The first, a shot set up by a
ball deflected across the front of
goal, was early in the period.
Stanford came right back. Taylor
lofted a free kick into the Cal
penalty area and Robb headed the
ball perfectly into the right side of
the goal, tying the game at 1-1.
Then, late in the period,
Stanford was called for an
extremely questionable pushing
penalty, and Cal was awarded a
direct free penalty shot. They
scored. Stanford tried but could
not score again, and that, as they
say, was the ball game.
"They [the Cardinals]
deserved to win," said Baldacinni
afterward. "They played
extremely well. You just can't
fight the referees, that's all. The
same thing happened to us against
USF." In that game, the Cardinals
were leading 2-1 when a pushing
penalty call almost identical to
Saturday's allowed USF to tie.
The Cardinals had five shots on
goal while Card goalie Bruce
Mosbacher had six saves. The
heart of the game, however, lies in
29 penalties called against the
Cards, to 19 against Cal.
"It was the penalties that killed
us," Priddle said quietly. "There's
nothing we can do about that."
Stanford plays UC-Davis
tomorrow, here, on the Harry
Maloney soccer field at 4 p.m.
