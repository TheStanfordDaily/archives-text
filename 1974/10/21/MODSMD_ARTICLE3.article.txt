# Frenchman's Terrace In Trouble
## HUD Holds Back Housing Aid 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Frenchman's Terrace, a proposed 225-unit housing
project for Stanford employees, may yet be denied funding
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), according to Dirk Murphy, legal counsel for HUD's
regional office.
"We haven't come to a point yet where we can make a
definitive statement," Murphy said. "We're still studying
the project."
Frenchman's Terrace would be built on Stanford land
within Palo Alto city limits with HUD funds. The Urban
Coalition would manage the project.
Murphy said that the regional HUD office has not
changed its affilation attitude since February, when area
director James Price objected to the project because
Stanford insisted on allocating half of the units to Stanford
employees and one-fourth to employees of firms located on
University land.

Last summer, the University abandoned its insistence
that 25 percent of the units be allocated to employees of
firms on its land, but Murphy said that other features of the
project still bother HUD officials. He noted that HUD has
decided to allow the University to retain its 50 percent
priority for employees.
The University insists that 40 percent of the units be
allocated to market-priced housing, 40 percent to
moderate-priced housing and 20 percent to low-income
housing.
Murphy emphasized that such restrictions are legal under
Section 236 of the National Housing Act of 1965, but that
HUD may decide that they are not acceptable in particular
cases.
Murphy termed the occupancy priorities "an open issue"
and said that HUD " is in the posture to conduct
discussions with Stanford on the issue."
Last week, Robert Moulton, acting director of the
Midpeninsula Housing Corporation, told the Daily that he
hopes to arrange conferences between the University and
HUD officials.
Moulton said that the remaining point of contention
between HUD and the University involves the exact
percentages of the income-level allocations.
He explained that HUD officials fear that the project
includes so many low-income units that it would become
stigmatized as a low-income project, thus making it harder
to manage.
The University is amenable to bargaining with HUD on
the income allocations, according to John Breedlove,
Stanford manager of land resources.
"We would be happy to talk with HUD anytime," he
declared.
Moulton expressed disappointment in the delay of plans
for the project, which was first proposed inl96B.After
opposition from local residents, the plan was stalled in
1972 when the Nixon Administration placed a moratorium
on funds for projects such as Frenchman's Terrace.
Moulton said the project was particularly hindered by

the death in September of Alan Maremont, director of the
Midpeninsula Housing Corporation and one of the plan's
staunchest defenders.
Although Moulton is temporarily serving in tl>e position
held by Marmeont, he explained that other dutijes prevent
him from devoting more than two days a week to the job.
There is no certainty that Palo Alto will agree to annex
the land on which Frenchman's Terrace would be built,
Moulton said. Residents of the area still object to the
project, and this spring 500 residents of nearby l Pine Hill
sent a petition to University President Richard Lyman
opposing the project.
The University claims that it cannot afford to provide
municipal services to the project and contends that
annexation must be a prerequisite for construction of the
project.
Moulton said that the main worry of the Frenchman's
Terrace supporters is that inflation will make the project
financially infeasible.
He explained that the project, which would cost
approximately $6 million, is still financially viable. Because
of rising costs, however, every delay reduces the possibility
of implementing the plan.

within Palo Alto city limits with HUD funds. The Urban
Coalition would manage the project.
Murphy said that the regional HUD office has not
changed its affilation attitude since February, when area
director James Price objected to the project because
Stanford insisted on allocating half of the units to Stanford
employees and one-fourth to employees of firms located on
University land.

Last summer, the University abandoned its insistence
that 25 percent of the units be allocated to employees of
firms on its land, but Murphy said that other features of the
project still bother HUD officials. He noted that HUD has
decided to allow the University to retain its 50 percent
priority for employees.
The University insists that 40 percent of the units be
allocated to market-priced housing, 40 percent to
moderate-priced housing and 20 percent to low-income
housing.
Murphy emphasized that such restrictions are legal under
Section 236 of the National Housing Act of 1965, but that
HUD may decide that they are not acceptable in particular
cases.
Murphy termed the occupancy priorities "an open issue"
and said that HUD " is in the posture to conduct
discussions with Stanford on the issue."
Last week, Robert Moulton, acting director of the
Midpeninsula Housing Corporation, told the Daily that he
hopes to arrange conferences between the University and
HUD officials.
Moulton said that the remaining point of contention
between HUD and the University involves the exact
percentages of the income-level allocations.
He explained that HUD officials fear that the project
includes so many low-income units that it would become
stigmatized as a low-income project, thus making it harder
to manage.
The University is amenable to bargaining with HUD on
the income allocations, according to John Breedlove,
Stanford manager of land resources.
"We would be happy to talk with HUD anytime," he
declared.
Moulton expressed disappointment in the delay of plans
for the project, which was first proposed inl96B.After
opposition from local residents, the plan was stalled in
1972 when the Nixon Administration placed a moratorium
on funds for projects such as Frenchman's Terrace.
Moulton said the project was particularly hindered by

the death in September of Alan Maremont, director of the
Midpeninsula Housing Corporation and one of the plan's
staunchest defenders.
Although Moulton is temporarily serving in tl>e position
held by Marmeont, he explained that other dutijes prevent
him from devoting more than two days a week to the job.
There is no certainty that Palo Alto will agree to annex
the land on which Frenchman's Terrace would be built,
Moulton said. Residents of the area still object to the
project, and this spring 500 residents of nearby l Pine Hill
sent a petition to University President Richard Lyman
opposing the project.
The University claims that it cannot afford to provide
municipal services to the project and contends that
annexation must be a prerequisite for construction of the
project.
Moulton said that the main worry of the Frenchman's
Terrace supporters is that inflation will make the project
financially infeasible.
He explained that the project, which would cost
approximately $6 million, is still financially viable. Because
of rising costs, however, every delay reduces the possibility
of implementing the plan.
Frenchman's Terrace, a proposed 225-unit housing
project for Stanford employees, may yet be denied funding
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), according to Dirk Murphy, legal counsel for HUD's
regional office.
"We haven't come to a point yet where we can make a
definitive statement," Murphy said. "We're still studying
the project."
Frenchman's Terrace would be built on Stanford land
within Palo Alto city limits with HUD funds. The Urban
