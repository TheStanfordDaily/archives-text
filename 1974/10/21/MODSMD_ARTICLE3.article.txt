# Frenchman's Terrace In Trouble
## HUD Holds Back Housing Aid 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Frenchman's Terrace, a proposed 225-unit housing
project for Stanford employees, may yet be denied funding
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), according to Dirk Murphy, legal counsel for HUD's
regional office.
"We haven't come to a point yet where we can make a
definitive statement," Murphy said. "We're still studying
the project."
Frenchman's Terrace would be built on Stanford land
within Palo Alto city limits with HUD funds. The Urban
Coalition would manage the project.
Murphy said that the regional HUD office has not
changed its affilation attitude since February, when area
director James Price objected to the project because
Stanford insisted on allocating half of the units to Stanford
employees and one-fourth to employees of firms located on
University land.

Last summer, the University abandoned its insistence
that 25 percent of the units be allocated to employees of
firms on its land, but Murphy said that other features of the
project still bother HUD officials. He noted that HUD has
decided to allow the University to retain its 50 percent
priority for employees.
The University insists that 40 percent of the units be
allocated to market-priced housing, 40 percent to
moderate-priced housing and 20 percent to low-income
housing.
Murphy emphasized that such restrictions are legal under
Section 236 of the National Housing Act of 1965, but that
HUD may decide that they are not acceptable in particular
cases.
Murphy termed the occupancy priorities "an open issue"
and said that HUD " is in the posture to conduct
discussions with Stanford on the issue."
