Rockfeller Admits $50,000 Gift To Kissinger
NEW YORK Nelson A. Rockefeller said yesterday he gave Henry A.
Kissinger $50,000 to help make it possible for the present secretary of state to
join President Nixon's administration as top national security adviser.
The gift, made in 1969, was among almost $2 million in presents to political
and other associates which have caused a furor in consideration of Rockefeller's
confirmation as vice president.
Asked last night how he assessed his chances of being confirmed, Rockefeller
replied, "I'm confident that the members of Congress are going to do the right
thing for the people of this country, whatever that is."
As for the gift to Kissinger, Rockefeller said he gave it to him "because he's
my friend.
"He worked for me for 14 years. He was going to Washington. I loved the
guy. I respected the guy. I was in a position to help him and I did," he said.
Group Plans To Challenge Nixon's Right To Tapes
WASHINGTON A group of educators, journalists, historians and political
scientists plans to file suit in federal court today to prevent the government from
surrendering to former President Richard M. Nixon any materials from his
administration.
The suit, to be filed against Arthur F. Sampson, head of the General Services
Administration, and Secret Service director H. Stuart Knight, asks for an order
temporarily restraining them from implementing an agreement giving Nixon his
tapes and documents.
The Ford administration, on request of Special Watergate Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski, already has said for now that none of the materials will be handed over
to the former President.
Meanwhile Nixon, whose aide Ronald Ziegler says wants the materials to
write his memoirs, has filed suit in federal court asking that custody of the
materials be given to him.
A hearing on Nixon's suit has been scheduled for today before U.S. District
Judge Charles R. Richey, who is expected to handle the other suit to be filed
today.
Lawyers To Attack Dean Testimony
WASHINGTON Defense lawyers get their chance this week to attack the
testimony of former White House Counsel John W. Dean 111 at the Watergate
cover-up trial.
The prosecutors expect to conclude their questioning of Dean today or
tomorrow at the latest.
Early in his testimony, Dean corrected the one error that caused him trouble
when he was a witness before the Senate Watergate committee.
At the committee hearing in June, 1973, Dean had told of meeting with
Herbert W. Kalmbach, Nixon lawyer and fundraiser, at the Mayflower Hotel in
Washington. They discussed the need to raise money for the Watergate break-in
defendants. f
Dean gave the committee a detailed account of their conversation. But there
was one flaw: he had the wrong hotel.
Dean actually had met Kalmbach at the Mayflower Coffee Shop in the
Statler-Hilton Hotel.
When he described that meeting at the cover-up trial, he was careful to give
the correct location.
UJS. May Aid India In 'Food For Peace' Plan
WASHINGTON India may get U.S. grain soon under a new Food for Peac
agreement, the First such aid in more than three years, but government officials
say they cannot estimate how much.
A new food aid package has not been disclosed but it could be settled when
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger visits India later this month.
But Andrew J. Mair, coordinator of Food for Peace in the State Department,
said he was sure an agreement with India was in the offing.
"The question is a figure of how much we'll supply," Mair said.
Wheat traditionally has been the food grain most available under the
20-year-old Food for Peace Program. But huge export drains the past two years
and a reduced U.S. crop this year have put a cramp in remaining supplies.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow with patchy night and morning fog or low clouds
along the coast. Slightly warmer days. Lows tonight in the upper 40s to low 50s.
Highs today and tomorrow in the 60s along the coast and into the 70s inland.
West to northwest winds 10 to 15 mph afternoons.
