# Alumni Executive Panel Seats Student Delegate
## 
### ANN HOFFMAN 
The Stanford Alumni Association
has reversed a long-standing rule and
named a student member to its
Executive Board.
Senior Class President Lise Pfeiffer
attended meetings of the Alumni
Board last week as a full, active
member. She views her role as one of a
liaison between students and the
Board.
"Sitting at the meetings, I realized
how important student input is. Unless

alumni have children attending school
here, they are not completely aware,"
Pfeiffer remarked.
A recent amendment to the
association's bylaws names the senior
class president each year as an
ex-officio member of the 24-member
Alumni Board.
Pfeiffer's Role
Alumni Association Director Tom
Newell said that Pfeiffer's
appointment will promote the major
functions of the 38,000-member
group, which are "to promote the
interests' of Stanford University, to
establish a mutually beneficial
relationship between the University
and its alumni."
"The Board felt we could do a
better job if we had a student as a
full-time member of the Board,"
Newell concluded.
Of last week's meetings, Pfeiffer
said that Board members particularly
wanted to know what students
thought of the Alumni Association.
She told them that students who are
uninformed about the association
usually have a negative, stereotyped
image of an organization devoted
basically to reunions.
Alumni Activities
Believing this stereotype is
unfounded, Pfeiffer points out that
the association offers such worthwhile
services as continuing education
programs for alumni, sponsored
throughout the country, and an

extensive publications program that
includes Stanford Magazine and The
Portable Stanford.
Pfeiffer will serve on three Board
committees—Student Services,
Membership and Clubs. Newell
foresees her position on the Student
Services committee as the most
influential.
In the area of student services,
Pfeiffer feels that the Alumni
Association can provide career
counseling sessions for students
through small, informal meetings with
alumni. Similar meetings have been
held before, and several are already
planned for this year. Pfeiffer would
like to expand the range of topics
discussed at the meetings.
Chief Concern
Pfeiffer's primary concern is
increasing student-alumni contact both
academically and socially.
Pfeiffer will help plan a dinner and
dance for seniors and alumni at the
Stanford Court Hotel, before the Big
Game against UC-Berkeley. She will
also be organizing "career meetings"
where students may discuss business,
public relations and community work
with knowledgable alumni.
Last week, she told the members of
the Student Services Committee that
the most important thing alumni could
do for students would be to sponsor
job intern programs. "This is where
alumni can do the most, any alumnus
in any city," she said.

also be organizing "career meetings"
where students may discuss business,
public relations and community work
with knowledgable alumni.
Last week, she told the members of
the Student Services Committee that
the most important thing alumni could
do for students would be to sponsor
job intern programs. "This is where
alumni can do the most, any alumnus
in any city," she said.
The Stanford Alumni Association
has reversed a long-standing rule and
named a student member to its
Executive Board.
Senior Class President Lise Pfeiffer
attended meetings of the Alumni
Board last week as a full, active
member. She views her role as one of a
liaison between students and the
Board.
"Sitting at the meetings, I realized
how important student input is. Unless

alumni have children attending school
here, they are not completely aware,"
Pfeiffer remarked.
A recent amendment to the
association's bylaws names the senior
class president each year as an
ex-officio member of the 24-member
Alumni Board.
Pfeiffer's Role
Alumni Association Director Tom
Newell said that Pfeiffer's
appointment will promote the major
functions of the 38,000-member
group, which are "to promote the
interests' of Stanford University, to
establish a mutually beneficial
relationship between the University
and its alumni."
"The Board felt we could do a
better job if we had a student as a
full-time member of the Board,"
Newell concluded.
Of last week's meetings, Pfeiffer
said that Board members particularly
wanted to know what students
thought of the Alumni Association.
She told them that students who are
uninformed about the association
usually have a negative, stereotyped
image of an organization devoted
basically to reunions.
Alumni Activities
Believing this stereotype is
unfounded, Pfeiffer points out that
the association offers such worthwhile
services as continuing education
programs for alumni, sponsored
throughout the country, and an

extensive publications program that
includes Stanford Magazine and The
Portable Stanford.
Pfeiffer will serve on three Board
committees—Student Services,
Membership and Clubs. Newell
foresees her position on the Student
Services committee as the most
influential.
In the area of student services,
Pfeiffer feels that the Alumni
Association can provide career
counseling sessions for students
through small, informal meetings with
alumni. Similar meetings have been
held before, and several are already
planned for this year. Pfeiffer would
like to expand the range of topics
discussed at the meetings.
Chief Concern
Pfeiffer's primary concern is
increasing student-alumni contact both
academically and socially.
Pfeiffer will help plan a dinner and
dance for seniors and alumni at the
Stanford Court Hotel, before the Big
Game against UC-Berkeley. She will
also be organizing "career meetings"
where students may discuss business,
public relations and community work
with knowledgable alumni.
