Stanford has the potential of being a model for a
"multi-ethnic" and "international" educational
experience, says Cecilia Preciado/Burciaga, assistant
to the president and the provost for chicano affairs.
Burciaga, who has been with the University for
three months, noted that there is "a lot of talent"
here.
It is the "responsibility of the students," said
Burciaga, "to be whatever they're going to be.
Whatever they choose, I think they are going to be
models."
Since coming to the University, "I've
grown... in awareness, experience," Burciaga
stated. "It's just now that I feel as though I belong."
Priorities Decided
The hardest part of her new job was "to decide
my priorities," she said. Burciaga recalled getting
very involved in finding vans for a chicano group to
go to Soledad, only to find out that it wasn't her
job.
Burciaga envisions her office as an information
center. She sees her "mission" as "implementing
programs and ideas that students might have," with
hers as "the umbrella office to help bring all the
ideas from dreams to realities."
One such dream is of a Chicano cultural center.
"Casa Zapata is a beautiful theme house ... a model
theme houss," Burciaga said. "But we need a
cultural center tnat includes more than just the
living aspect."
Cultural Center Needed
With many chicano interest-groups such as
MECHA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de
Aztlan), the chicano fellows, the "Ballet Folklorico
at Stanford" and the "beginnings of a theater
group," there is a need for "a comprehensive
center," Burciaga concluded.
Another plan is for a chicano research center for
women, which would involve colleges throughout

the nation. Several chicanas at each university
would contact their counterparts, "get together
talents, research needs in their area," and thereby
form a "talent bank" where women could get in
touch with others working on similar projects.
On the national level, the center would seek
research funding. Burciaga emphasized that this
would be an "organized effort" and,would involve
"coordinating activities."
Chicano Acceptance
Another goal for Burciaga is seeing chicanos
accepted as "professional staff members" rather
than "chicano specialists."
"As long as we're 'assets to' and seen as
'attachments to—we haven't really arrived," she
explained.
Burciaga described the chicano community here
as "a strong, solid, visible group" with a lot of peer
pressure.
This year "the chicano community seems to be
yelling for organization," Burciaga commented.
Students now see themselves as "being here for a
short time" and want to take action, she said.
'Goals, Objectives'
She commented that she was "waiting for the
students to 'get it together' and formulate goals and
objectives for the year." However, "if they don't
come, I'll go to them," she added.
Because she is being appointed to many
committees, with more work and more meetings,
Burciaga is finding that her heavy schedule of
meetings has forced her to keep an appointment
book for the first time in her life. Nevertheless,
"students should feel frefe to drop in," she said.
Burciaga added that she has been "trying to get
the pulse of the community" and is "grateful to
students who just drop by." Burciaga has also been
to several dorms to talk and eat with students. She
said she plans to start advising students next year.

"One of the beautiful things about Stanford is
that it brings together chicanos from all over,"
Burciaga remarked. Thus, the chicano community
here combines a variety of experiences from across
the nation. "That's positive . . . you don't get that
at a state university," said Burciaga.
Faculty and staff members are "in general
exceedingly happy and impressed," with Burciaga,
said James Leckie, assistant professor in civil
engineering.
Leckie was a member of the interim executive
committee which kept Burciaga's office open in the
year between the departure of former chicano
affairs adviser Salvador Sanchez and Burciaga's
appointment.
Of Burciaga, Leckie said he was "quite impressed
with her performance, .energy and intelligence." He
also expressed "a lot of confidence in her getting
things done and handling problems as they come
up."
Another member of the interim committee, Chris
Sierra, a graduate student in political science,
worked with Burciaga during the summer. "I was
amazed at how quickly she picked up on things,"
Sierra commented.
'Very Receptive'
Sierra said she thinks Burciaga "has the interests
and needs of the chicano community at heart," and
is "very receptive."
Burciaga, 29, was an investigator of alleged civil
rights violations in various California, Texas, and
New Mexico school districts for the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission. She contributed to a recent six-volume
study on Mexican-American education and was also
a consultant to the National Endowment for the
Humanities.
A native of Chino, Calif. Burciaga graduated
from California State University, Fullerton, holds a
master's degree from UC-Riverside and taught "ugh
school for three years in Chino.
