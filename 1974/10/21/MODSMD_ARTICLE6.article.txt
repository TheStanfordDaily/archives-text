Response On Marshall 1
Editor: '
I'm compelled to file this <
response to Glenn Garvin's '
unthinking attack on Mike 1
Marshall in his "Pro Prognosis" '
column (Daily, Oct. 16). 1
Marshall's viewpoints on his i
sport, which Garvin dismisses as
"intellectualized crap," are, in
fact, in keeping with theP
philosophy of athletics which this
University is always expounding:
namely, an avoidance of
overemphasis.
Marshall's current studies at
Michigan State toward a doctorate
in physiology (not physical
education)' are an example of a
man living his beliefs. And so is
his refusal to sign autographs,
much as it attracts Garvin's
vitriol.
The star Dodger reliever refuses
to affix his signature on programs
thrust at him by envious
youngsters not because he feels
such a response to be beneath his
dignity, but because doing so
would be contrary to the lesson
he wants those youngsters to
learn.
His message is simply this:
don't idolize me. Don't regard a
simple baseball game as the
fulfillment of life's goal.
And Marshall is right.
Hero worship of sports figures
serves no valid purpose. Any
evaluation of athletic contests
above what they should be,
pastimes, is damaging to the
growth of an individual.
Marshall is an iconoclast in an
athletic world of win-it-all
fanatics. He, like many members
of the Oakland A's he now
opposes, *is the thinking man's
athlete. Such performers
recognize that their on-the-field
activites comprise a business. It is
their occupation, and they
perform to the best of their
abilities. But it is not their life.

I would like to correct one
item of information in the
otherwise accurate (and
appreciated) letter from the
students currently at Stanford in
France, (Daily, Oct. 15). There is
still priority in selection to go to
Stanford-in-France given to
students who have had two or
more quarters of college level
study of French language.
If spaces are available, students
with less than two quarters college
level study of French are

considered and in some special
cases are permitted to study
overseas. It should be emphasized
that a large majority of the
students who have studied in
Tours very strongly feel that two
quarters of French is the
minimum a student should have in
order to be able to take full
advantage of the opportunities
presented there.

Editor:
Having choked on my
breakfast while reading Glenn
Garvin's ridiculous article on Mike
Marshall, I cannot let such
impetuous babbling go
unchallenged.
If Garvin's burning distaste for
anyone with a brain is typical of
most sportswriters, then
Marshall's refusal to give an
interview seems quite
understandable. Wouldn't most
poeple scoff at such questions as
"Gee whiz, Mike, how'd you do
it," after hearing them 10 dozen
times a season? On the other
hand, Marshall does give an
occasional interview and one need
only read those published this last
summer in Sport and Sports
Illustrated to form an opinion
quite different from Garvin's.
Secondly, it is to Marshall's
credit that he refuses to give
autographs. If anything, he is
doing a service to the younger
baseball fans by teaching them
that there are other things more
significant to sports and life than
a name scribbled on a piece of
paper.
It is unfortunate that Garvin
has nothing better to do than
criticize someone who has
developed his intellect and
profession to the point that
Marshall has. Obviously, Garvin is
one of those "hacks" to whom
Marshall has nothing to say. And
why not?

Editor:
Contrary to Prof.
Bienenstock's letter (Daily, Oct.
14.) neither affirmative action nor
appointments to the faculty are
subject to the restriction of the
number of applicants from an
advanced degree poll. Although
this usually serves as a basis by
which professional achievements
are recognized and faculty
appointments made, there are no
University requirements that
appointments to the faculty
should be evaluated on this
criterion alone.
Prof. Bienenstock's rationale is
an inadequate justification for
Stanford's unsatisfactory record
in appointing more women and
minority members to the faculty.

I would like to correct one
item of information in the
otherwise accurate (and
appreciated) letter from the
students currently at Stanford in
France, (Daily, Oct. 15). There is
still priority in selection to go to
Stanford-in-France given to
students who have had two or
more quarters of college level
study of French language.
If spaces are available, students
with less than two quarters college
level study of French are

considered and in some special
cases are permitted to study
overseas. It should be emphasized
that a large majority of the
students who have studied in
Tours very strongly feel that two
quarters of French is the
minimum a student should have in
order to be able to take full
advantage of the opportunities
presented there.

Marshall Defended
Editor:
Having choked on my
breakfast while reading Glenn
Garvin's ridiculous article on Mike
Marshall, I cannot let such
impetuous babbling go
unchallenged.
If Garvin's burning distaste for
anyone with a brain is typical of
most sportswriters, then
Marshall's refusal to give an
interview seems quite
understandable. Wouldn't most
poeple scoff at such questions as
"Gee whiz, Mike, how'd you do
it," after hearing them 10 dozen
times a season? On the other
hand, Marshall does give an
occasional interview and one need
only read those published this last
summer in Sport and Sports
Illustrated to form an opinion
quite different from Garvin's.
Secondly, it is to Marshall's
credit that he refuses to give
autographs. If anything, he is
doing a service to the younger
baseball fans by teaching them
that there are other things more
significant to sports and life than
a name scribbled on a piece of
paper.
It is unfortunate that Garvin
has nothing better to do than
criticize someone who has
developed his intellect and
profession to the point that
Marshall has. Obviously, Garvin is
one of those "hacks" to whom
Marshall has nothing to say. And
why not?

Contrary to Prof.
Bienenstock's letter (Daily, Oct.
14.) neither affirmative action nor
appointments to the faculty are
subject to the restriction of the
number of applicants from an
advanced degree poll. Although
this usually serves as a basis by
which professional achievements
are recognized and faculty
appointments made, there are no
University requirements that
appointments to the faculty
should be evaluated on this
criterion alone.
Prof. Bienenstock's rationale is
an inadequate justification for
Stanford's unsatisfactory record
in appointing more women and
minority members to the faculty.

Response On Marshall 1
Editor: '
I'm compelled to file this <
response to Glenn Garvin's '
unthinking attack on Mike 1
Marshall in his "Pro Prognosis" '
column (Daily, Oct. 16). 1
Marshall's viewpoints on his i
sport, which Garvin dismisses as
"intellectualized crap," are, in
fact, in keeping with theP
philosophy of athletics which this
University is always expounding:
namely, an avoidance of
overemphasis.
Marshall's current studies at
Michigan State toward a doctorate
in physiology (not physical
education)' are an example of a
man living his beliefs. And so is
his refusal to sign autographs,
much as it attracts Garvin's
vitriol.
The star Dodger reliever refuses
to affix his signature on programs
thrust at him by envious
youngsters not because he feels
such a response to be beneath his
dignity, but because doing so
would be contrary to the lesson
he wants those youngsters to
learn.
His message is simply this:
don't idolize me. Don't regard a
simple baseball game as the
fulfillment of life's goal.
And Marshall is right.
Hero worship of sports figures
serves no valid purpose. Any
evaluation of athletic contests
above what they should be,
pastimes, is damaging to the
growth of an individual.
Marshall is an iconoclast in an
athletic world of win-it-all
fanatics. He, like many members
of the Oakland A's he now
opposes, *is the thinking man's
athlete. Such performers
recognize that their on-the-field
activites comprise a business. It is
their occupation, and they
perform to the best of their
abilities. But it is not their life.

Bad Record
Editor:
Contrary to Prof.
Bienenstock's letter (Daily, Oct.
14.) neither affirmative action nor
appointments to the faculty are
subject to the restriction of the
number of applicants from an
advanced degree poll. Although
this usually serves as a basis by
which professional achievements
are recognized and faculty
appointments made, there are no
University requirements that
appointments to the faculty
should be evaluated on this
criterion alone.
Prof. Bienenstock's rationale is
an inadequate justification for
Stanford's unsatisfactory record
in appointing more women and
minority members to the faculty.

Response On Marshall 1
Editor: '
I'm compelled to file this <
response to Glenn Garvin's '
unthinking attack on Mike 1
Marshall in his "Pro Prognosis" '
column (Daily, Oct. 16). 1
Marshall's viewpoints on his i
sport, which Garvin dismisses as
"intellectualized crap," are, in
fact, in keeping with theP
philosophy of athletics which this
University is always expounding:
namely, an avoidance of
overemphasis.
Marshall's current studies at
Michigan State toward a doctorate
in physiology (not physical
education)' are an example of a
man living his beliefs. And so is
his refusal to sign autographs,
much as it attracts Garvin's
vitriol.
The star Dodger reliever refuses
to affix his signature on programs
thrust at him by envious
youngsters not because he feels
such a response to be beneath his
dignity, but because doing so
would be contrary to the lesson
he wants those youngsters to
learn.
His message is simply this:
don't idolize me. Don't regard a
simple baseball game as the
fulfillment of life's goal.
And Marshall is right.
Hero worship of sports figures
serves no valid purpose. Any
evaluation of athletic contests
above what they should be,
pastimes, is damaging to the
growth of an individual.
Marshall is an iconoclast in an
athletic world of win-it-all
fanatics. He, like many members
of the Oakland A's he now
opposes, *is the thinking man's
athlete. Such performers
recognize that their on-the-field
activites comprise a business. It is
their occupation, and they
perform to the best of their
abilities. But it is not their life.

Whatever happened to Quinn
Mayer, Ann Carter and Len
Mackey? Did Mike Herman, the
one and only ASSU president, fire
them? Or were they put on his
ticket merely to help him get
elected and do nothing else?

I would like to correct one
item of information in the
otherwise accurate (and
appreciated) letter from the
students currently at Stanford in
France, (Daily, Oct. 15). There is
still priority in selection to go to
Stanford-in-France given to
students who have had two or
more quarters of college level
study of French language.
If spaces are available, students
with less than two quarters college
level study of French are

considered and in some special
cases are permitted to study
overseas. It should be emphasized
that a large majority of the
students who have studied in
Tours very strongly feel that two
quarters of French is the
minimum a student should have in
order to be able to take full
advantage of the opportunities
presented there.

Marshall Defended
Editor:
Having choked on my
breakfast while reading Glenn
Garvin's ridiculous article on Mike
Marshall, I cannot let such
impetuous babbling go
unchallenged.
If Garvin's burning distaste for
anyone with a brain is typical of
most sportswriters, then
Marshall's refusal to give an
interview seems quite
understandable. Wouldn't most
poeple scoff at such questions as
"Gee whiz, Mike, how'd you do
it," after hearing them 10 dozen
times a season? On the other
hand, Marshall does give an
occasional interview and one need
only read those published this last
summer in Sport and Sports
Illustrated to form an opinion
quite different from Garvin's.
Secondly, it is to Marshall's
credit that he refuses to give
autographs. If anything, he is
doing a service to the younger
baseball fans by teaching them
that there are other things more
significant to sports and life than
a name scribbled on a piece of
paper.
It is unfortunate that Garvin
has nothing better to do than
criticize someone who has
developed his intellect and
profession to the point that
Marshall has. Obviously, Garvin is
one of those "hacks" to whom
Marshall has nothing to say. And
why not?
