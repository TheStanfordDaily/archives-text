## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The 29-year-old wife of a University

night was kidnaped, taken to the
foothills near Page Mill Road and
1 molested by apian who later fled on
foot, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
department confirmed yesterday.
Sheriff's Capt. Frank Mosunic
emphasized that the woman had not
been raped, but he said she was taken
to the Stanford Hospital emergency
1 > room and treated for shock. She was
released later that night, he said.
Both Mosunic and Undersheriff
Tom Rosa quickly denied a
connection between the kidnaping and
the Oct. 13 murder of Arlis Perry in
Memorial Church.
• f Stop Sign
Mosunic said the woman had
stopped at a stop sign at the
intersection of Bowdoin Street and
Pine Hill Road about 8 p.m. when the
man jumped into her car through the
unlocked passenger side door.
* The man ordered her to drive to
Page Mill Road and commanded her to
stop V/ 2 miles south of Moody Road,
Mosunic said. He then forced her out
of the car.
She broke away from the mair, but
he caught up with her and the two of
t them slid down an embankment,
according to the police report.
Tied Down
The man then forced her to strip,
and took her belt. He ordered her to
lie on the ground and tied her hands to
a fallen tree, Mosunic said.
I The woman made no mention of a
weapon being used, he added.
The man fondled her for several
minutes, then left on foot leaving her
tied, the captain said.
Collapsed
She managed to free herself and
. climb up the side of the road, but she
collapsed there, still naked.
A passing motorist saw the woman's
body and called the Sheriff's office
about 10 p.m., reporting her as dead,
according to Mosunic.
Another couple passing by a few
minutes later saw the woman,
■ determined that she was only
unconscious and stayed with her until
police arrived.
Description
The Sheriffs Office has no
immediate suspects, but Mosunic
offered this description of the
V woman's assailant:
A male Caucasian in his early 30s,
5-foot-10, dark brown or black hair,
rough olive complexion, weighing 170
pounds, wearing a long red, green and
blue flannel shirt and blue jeans.
Mosunic said he did not see "a
V definite connection" between this
abduction and Perry murder. There
was "no similarity" between the two
incidents, he said, but he added that
he could not positively rule out a
connection.
Mosunic urged all women on
campus to keep their car doors locked
and look in the back seat for
unwanted passengers before driving
away.

A passing motorist saw the woman's
body and called the Sheriff's office
about 10 p.m., reporting her as dead,
according to Mosunic.
Another couple passing by a few
minutes later saw the woman,
■ determined that she was only
unconscious and stayed with her until
police arrived.
Description
The Sheriffs Office has no
immediate suspects, but Mosunic
offered this description of the
V woman's assailant:
A male Caucasian in his early 30s,
5-foot-10, dark brown or black hair,
rough olive complexion, weighing 170
pounds, wearing a long red, green and
blue flannel shirt and blue jeans.
Mosunic said he did not see "a
V definite connection" between this
abduction and Perry murder. There
was "no similarity" between the two
incidents, he said, but he added that
he could not positively rule out a
connection.
Mosunic urged all women on
campus to keep their car doors locked
and look in the back seat for
unwanted passengers before driving
away.
