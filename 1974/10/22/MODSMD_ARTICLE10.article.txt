# Does Cohesive Elite Rule America?

Cohesiveness (New York: Harper & Row,
1974), 250 pages, $7.95.
This new book by Domhoff is a somewhat
unusual admixture of high-society anecdotes
spiced with local color, serious sociological
theorizing, and listings of the
interconnections of those he is studying. But
the content of the book speaks directly to
important problems in social theory.
American society is, I would argue,
becoming somewhat feudalized. It is
organized more and more around status
rather than contract and is characterized by
economic decisions having more and more of
a political rather than a market-oriented
nature.
In this situation, the background,
attitudes, and degree of unity of those in
charge becomes valuable data for those
interested in politics. Domhoff is interested
in who was responsible for the development
of contemporary American state monopoly
capitalism. This has been the subject of three
books Domhoff has written and one he
co edited.
Domhoff argues that there is a caste that
rules America. Domhoff's concept of such
castes is very reminiscent of Max Weber's
concept of status groups. In the status order,
according to Weber, people are grouped by
their prestige and their life-style.
Similarly, in all Domhoff's books, the

emphasis is both on power and on the
cohesiveness of the powerful, based on their
shared life-styles.
Domhoff's approach to analyzing who was
responsible for the growth of the American
Leviathan is a non-Marxist approach.
Neither for Domhoff nor for sociologist C.
Wright Mills, Domhoff's intellectual mentor,
is the power of the ruling class based directly
and narrowly, as it is in Marxian doctrine, on
the decision-making relations resulting from
the ownership of property in the realm of
production.
The central thesis of Domhoff's Bohemian
Grove book is that informal, face-to-face
relationships between the powerful rich gives
them a cohesiveness as a group that is
necessary in working together to control the
society.
The thesis is spun out in three steps in his
chapter entitled "Do Bohemians, Rancheros
and Roundup Riders Rule America?"
First, Domhoff contends that institutions
like the Bohemian Grove retreat (a two week
gathering of influential men in an
encampment along the Russian River in
northern California) facilitate social ties
among a nation-wide set of powerful
individuals. "Once formed, these groups
become another avenue by which the
cohesiveness of the upper class is
maintained." Domhoff provides some
testimonial evidence for the operation of this
cohesion effect.

Second, Domhoff contends certain
business groups like the Council of Foreign
Relations, the Committee for Economic
Development, the Business Council, and the
National Municipal League, perform the
important tasks of policy-articulation and
consensus-building in corporate liberal
America.
Third, Domhoff contends that there is a
large overlapping of membership in
government and corporate leadership, in the
business policy planning groups, and in the
social retreats like the Bohemian Grove. His
appendix of over one hundred pages in this
book is designed to display that overlap.
But why care at all about the high-society
retreats? As Domhoff himself notes, "retreats
are held by just about every group you can
think of scouts, ministers, students,
athletes, musicians and even cheerleaders."
What is important is that the retreats of
members of the governing caste bind the
participants together. Whereas pluralist
sociologists and political scientists see
dischord and disharmony when they look at
political and business elites, eventually these
elite groups do seem to unite to back
national policy. Domhoff sees the retreats as
a sort of social lubrication that helps make
such ultimate consensus possible.

responsible for the growth of the American
Leviathan is a non-Marxist approach.
Neither for Domhoff nor for sociologist C.
Wright Mills, Domhoff's intellectual mentor,
is the power of the ruling class based directly
and narrowly, as it is in Marxian doctrine, on
the decision-making relations resulting from
the ownership of property in the realm of
production.
The central thesis of Domhoff's Bohemian
Grove book is that informal, face-to-face
relationships between the powerful rich gives
them a cohesiveness as a group that is
necessary in working together to control the
society.
The thesis is spun out in three steps in his
chapter entitled "Do Bohemians, Rancheros
and Roundup Riders Rule America?"
First, Domhoff contends that institutions
like the Bohemian Grove retreat (a two week
gathering of influential men in an
encampment along the Russian River in
northern California) facilitate social ties
among a nation-wide set of powerful
individuals. "Once formed, these groups
become another avenue by which the
cohesiveness of the upper class is
maintained." Domhoff provides some
testimonial evidence for the operation of this
cohesion effect.

Second, Domhoff contends certain
business groups like the Council of Foreign
Relations, the Committee for Economic
Development, the Business Council, and the
National Municipal League, perform the
important tasks of policy-articulation and
consensus-building in corporate liberal
America.
Third, Domhoff contends that there is a
large overlapping of membership in
government and corporate leadership, in the
business policy planning groups, and in the
social retreats like the Bohemian Grove. His
appendix of over one hundred pages in this
book is designed to display that overlap.
But why care at all about the high-society
retreats? As Domhoff himself notes, "retreats
are held by just about every group you can
think of scouts, ministers, students,
athletes, musicians and even cheerleaders."
What is important is that the retreats of
members of the governing caste bind the
participants together. Whereas pluralist
sociologists and political scientists see
dischord and disharmony when they look at
political and business elites, eventually these
elite groups do seem to unite to back
national policy. Domhoff sees the retreats as
a sort of social lubrication that helps make
such ultimate consensus possible.

Cohesiveness (New York: Harper & Row,

This new book by Domhoff is a somewhat
unusual admixture of high-society anecdotes
spiced with local color, serious sociological
theorizing, and listings of the
interconnections of those he is studying. But
the content of the book speaks directly to
important problems in social theory.
American society is, I would argue,
becoming somewhat feudalized. It is
organized more and more around status
rather than contract and is characterized by
economic decisions having more and more of
a political rather than a market-oriented
nature.
In this situation, the background,
attitudes, and degree of unity of those in
charge becomes valuable data for those
interested in politics. Domhoff is interested
in who was responsible for the development
of contemporary American state monopoly
capitalism. This has been the subject of three
books Domhoff has written and one he
co edited.
Domhoff argues that there is a caste that
rules America. Domhoff's concept of such
castes is very reminiscent of Max Weber's
concept of status groups. In the status order,
according to Weber, people are grouped by
their prestige and their life-style.
Similarly, in all Domhoff's books, the

emphasis is both on power and on the
cohesiveness of the powerful, based on their
shared life-styles.
