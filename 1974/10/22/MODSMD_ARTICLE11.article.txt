# Fraternities Should Lose Draw Exemptions
## 
### Chris Elms 
It is always sad to see the
spectacle of a privileged group
trying desperately to justify the
perpetuation of its privilege. Such
a spectacle is presently being
made at Stanford.
At issue is the Draw-exempt
status enjoyed by 12 all-male
fraternities. Exemption from the
Draw means two things: that
present residents get to select new
Residents, and that once selected,
residents are guaranteed a place in
the house until graduation.
It is no longer legal for Draw
exemption to be given exclusively
to all-male fraternities. Either a
number of coed houses must be
given exemptions, or the
fraternities must give up theirs.
Some arguments made by
those who oppose the forfeiture
of fraternity Draw exemptions are
not terribly interesting and can be
dispensed with quickly. I include
in the category the argument that
since they have always had the
privilege of exemption they
should continue to have it.
Another relatively uninteresting
argument runs: alumni donors
selflessly did the University a
favor by funding the construction
of fraternity houses on campus.
They did so with the expectation
that the houses would be
draw-exempt, and out of gratitude
their expectation ought to be
fulfilled.
Rejoinders
Two rejoinders to this
argument will suffice. First, the
donors get large tax deductions
for their gifts the benefits of
the gifts, in other words, were
mutual. Second, I believe that
whatever decision is made
regarding the Draw exemption
issue should be made solely on the
basis of what is best for the
University, and not at all on the
basis of what will make alumni
happiest.
A more worthwhile argument
against the abolition of fraternity
privilege states that it is crucial
that Stanford preserve a variety of
options in its housing system. To

take away the fraternities' Draw
exemption would elminate the
fraternity option from the range
of housing choices. Why would
this be the case? Fraternity
members argue that without the
three-year residency guarantee,
continuity within the house
would be impossible, and because
without the absolute power to
select new residents the
fratnerities would not be sure that
the right kind of individuals will
be present to carry on the spirit of
the house.
I question this argument. The
assertion that the death of

fraternities will result from Draw
inclusion is false. If the fraternity
continues to exist in name and if
it has a reasonable number of
fraternity-type activities, it will
still attract the same people it
would attract were it exempt.
Death Knell?
However, having said this I
hasten to add that under one of
the proposals presently being
considered by the Housing Office
it would be possible for a house to
be within the Draw and still
exercise a large measure of
selectivity over applicants. This
would be done by allowing the

house to rank-order the names on
its priority list, effectively
insuring that the house could
admit whomever it wished out of
all applicants above the general
University cutoff. The same
proposal also includes an
opportunity for any house to
guarantee the 75 percent of the
residents who wish to return may
do so. This is, of course, not the
100 percent continuity presently
enjoyedâ€” hardly a "death knell."
When cornered, the defender
of fraternity privilege will make
one other argument. He will
concede that destruction of

fraternities may not be inevitable
without Draw exemption, but
state that a diminution of their
quality would be a certainty if
they were brought under the
Draw.
To this I must answer:
obviously any house would be a
better place to live in with a Draw
exemption. However, I question
whether we ought to place a
higher value on the quality of
individual "showcase" houses
than we do on the principal of
equal access to on-campus spaces.
