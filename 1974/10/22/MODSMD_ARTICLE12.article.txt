# Surtax Fuels Inept Bureaucracy
## 
### Anthony Harrigan 
President Ford really stumbled in
proposing a five percent surcharge on
corporations and families with gross incomes
of $15,0000 or more. If enacted into law, the
surcharge would put more billions into the
hands of the federal bureaucracy.
The way to fight inflation is to deprive the
federal bureaucrats of money, not give them
additional funds.
Much of the money raised by the
surcharge would be spent on the creation of
the Community Improvements Corps, a new
make-work agency for the unemployed. This
is the New Deal Works Projects
Administration (WPA) program under
another name. Let's not go back to vintage
boondoggles.
It is dismaying that the President, who has
spoken so eloquently about the need to fight
inflation, doesn't realize that the fight can't
be won by creating another federal agency or
by placing a new tax burden on employers
and other productive citizens.
As for creating public service jobs to
counter a recession, that simply places a
heavier burden on those who are employed
or who provide jobs in a community. We
have been this route before in this country
and it hasn't led anywhere. We simply must
not go back to New Deal, pump-priming
economics with its make-work programs and
soak-the-productive philosophy.

Now is the time to cut taxes on business
and to slash federal budgets of federal
agencies. As Rep. Floyd D. Spence (R-S.C.),
said, "The people need a reduction in taxes."
The Daily Oklahoman in Oklahoma City
made a great deal of sense the other day
when it noted editorially that "taxing the
money out of citizens" pockets and into the
Treasury does not take it out of circulation
that was always a wartime rationale for
higher taxes. The federal government today
puts it back into circulation faster than it can
take it away from the citizens."
Ford's speech was lacking in such
common sense economics. Clearly, he is
getting the wrong advice more of the same
old liberal economic advice that got this
country into a jam in the Kennedy, Johnson
and Nixon administrations.
If the President and the Congress want to
bring inflation under control, they will have
to deal sternly with the union monopoly
which drives up prices in every industry. The
President and the Congress also need to hit at
the widespread welfarism and parasitism
manifested in the food stamp program which
provides a subsidy for more than 12 million
Americans every month.
The Executive and Legislative Branches
must abandon reliance on super-regulation of
industry and price controls on natural gas,
for instance, which restricts development of

this needed energy resource.
But all that requires vision and fortitude.
And accurate understanding of our national
situation is lacking in the White House and
the Congress, as is determination to fight the
union bosses and oppose the demands of
career welfarists.
Ford shouldn't bear all the blame, of
course. Congress has been unwilling to
abolish the foreign aid program, which is
utterly inexcusable in the light of the
country's financial plight.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.) urges
federal make-work programs on a colossal
scale, plus new federal subsidies for housing
all without any consideration as to how
these programs will be funded.
The country's trouble is short-sighted or
uninformed legislators and public officials
who prefer politics as usual to abandonment
of the federal government's giant edifice of
subsidies, regulations and spending programs.
The important question is: do the voters
recognize sound economic advice when they
hear it? For a generation or more, Americans
have been told that government can tax and
spend its way out of any difficulty. They
may not understand that excessive taxation
and deficit spending means the ruin of the
United States and every family in it.

If the President and the Congress want to
bring inflation under control, they will have
to deal sternly with the union monopoly
which drives up prices in every industry. The
President and the Congress also need to hit at
the widespread welfarism and parasitism
manifested in the food stamp program which
provides a subsidy for more than 12 million
Americans every month.
The Executive and Legislative Branches
must abandon reliance on super-regulation of
industry and price controls on natural gas,
for instance, which restricts development of

this needed energy resource.
But all that requires vision and fortitude.
And accurate understanding of our national
situation is lacking in the White House and
the Congress, as is determination to fight the
union bosses and oppose the demands of
career welfarists.
Ford shouldn't bear all the blame, of
course. Congress has been unwilling to
abolish the foreign aid program, which is
utterly inexcusable in the light of the
country's financial plight.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.) urges
federal make-work programs on a colossal
scale, plus new federal subsidies for housing
all without any consideration as to how
these programs will be funded.
The country's trouble is short-sighted or
uninformed legislators and public officials
who prefer politics as usual to abandonment
of the federal government's giant edifice of
subsidies, regulations and spending programs.
The important question is: do the voters
recognize sound economic advice when they
hear it? For a generation or more, Americans
have been told that government can tax and
spend its way out of any difficulty. They
may not understand that excessive taxation
and deficit spending means the ruin of the
United States and every family in it.
(Anthony Harrigan is executive vice president
of the U.S. Industrial Council.)
President Ford really stumbled in
proposing a five percent surcharge on
corporations and families with gross incomes
of $15,0000 or more. If enacted into law, the
surcharge would put more billions into the
hands of the federal bureaucracy.
The way to fight inflation is to deprive the
federal bureaucrats of money, not give them
additional funds.
Much of the money raised by the
surcharge would be spent on the creation of
the Community Improvements Corps, a new
make-work agency for the unemployed. This
is the New Deal Works Projects
Administration (WPA) program under
another name. Let's not go back to vintage
boondoggles.
It is dismaying that the President, who has
spoken so eloquently about the need to fight
inflation, doesn't realize that the fight can't
be won by creating another federal agency or
by placing a new tax burden on employers
and other productive citizens.
As for creating public service jobs to
counter a recession, that simply places a
heavier burden on those who are employed
or who provide jobs in a community. We
have been this route before in this country
and it hasn't led anywhere. We simply must
not go back to New Deal, pump-priming
economics with its make-work programs and
soak-the-productive philosophy.

Now is the time to cut taxes on business
and to slash federal budgets of federal
agencies. As Rep. Floyd D. Spence (R-S.C.),
said, "The people need a reduction in taxes."
The Daily Oklahoman in Oklahoma City
made a great deal of sense the other day
when it noted editorially that "taxing the
money out of citizens" pockets and into the
Treasury does not take it out of circulation
that was always a wartime rationale for
higher taxes. The federal government today
puts it back into circulation faster than it can
take it away from the citizens."
Ford's speech was lacking in such
common sense economics. Clearly, he is
getting the wrong advice more of the same
old liberal economic advice that got this
country into a jam in the Kennedy, Johnson
and Nixon administrations.
