At the same time as the Soviet
press was greeting with adulation
the Moscow meeting sponsored by
Stanford Research Institute of the
heads of leading capitalist
corporations, on opposite pages
cartoons savagely attacking such
corporations appeared.. Typical
was one entitled, "The Noose of
Social Partnership." The enslaved
worker supports the fat capitalist,
who harvests the profits.
The ambivalent Soviet attitude
reflects the reassurances of the
Soviets are spreading that among
the faithful that detente with
capitalism is simply a temporary
tactic in the historic struggle
between two systems. It also
reflects divisions and doubts in the
Soviet leadership.
Ignorance
Conversely, what is behind the
pro -detente proclamations of U.S.
business leaders? Largely, it is the
result of ignorance of the total
picture and concentration on
deals which benefit corporations.
This is mixed with a belief that
deals are better than a nuclear
war, a believe shared by Soviet
leaders. Some US. business leaders
also rightly calculate that the
Soviets will stop criticizing U.S.
countries or enterprises with
which they can make
opportunistic deals.
Thus, the Brazilian junta,
which is excoriated by Western
liberals, is never criticized in the
Soviet press, whereas Peking is the
object of daily attacks. The Bank
of America, which the Soviet
press previously depicted as, a
monster, is now referred to in
congenial terms. In Soviet
judgment, the sheep are the
corporations which have made
deals with Moscow, the goats are
those who have not. Goats
become sheep by making a deal.
Issues
The issues involved are
extremely complex. For example,
the nuclear weapons problem is
such that only a few specialists
can talk knowledgeably; and
many seasoned diplomats admit
that they are bewildered. Yet
both sides live in ignorance which
is not bliss. The Soviets know
only the party line which the
propaganda machine hammers
into them day and night. In the
United States the business
community wheels and deals, and
in our universities there is an
incredible lack of expertise on
contemporary Soviet affairs.
There are some excellent U.S.
correspondents in Moscow, but
the public is so obsessed with
Watergate that Moscovy is beyond
its limited ken.

into them day and night. In the
United States the business
community wheels and deals, and
in our universities there is an
incredible lack of expertise on
contemporary Soviet affairs.
There are some excellent U.S.
correspondents in Moscow, but
the public is so obsessed with
Watergate that Moscovy is beyond
its limited ken.

At the same time as the Soviet
press was greeting with adulation
the Moscow meeting sponsored by
Stanford Research Institute of the
heads of leading capitalist
corporations, on opposite pages
cartoons savagely attacking such
corporations appeared.. Typical
was one entitled, "The Noose of
Social Partnership." The enslaved
worker supports the fat capitalist,
who harvests the profits.
The ambivalent Soviet attitude
reflects the reassurances of the
Soviets are spreading that among
the faithful that detente with
capitalism is simply a temporary
tactic in the historic struggle
between two systems. It also
reflects divisions and doubts in the
Soviet leadership.
Ignorance
Conversely, what is behind the
pro -detente proclamations of U.S.
business leaders? Largely, it is the
result of ignorance of the total
picture and concentration on
deals which benefit corporations.
This is mixed with a belief that
deals are better than a nuclear
war, a believe shared by Soviet
leaders. Some US. business leaders
also rightly calculate that the
Soviets will stop criticizing U.S.
countries or enterprises with
which they can make
opportunistic deals.
Thus, the Brazilian junta,
which is excoriated by Western
liberals, is never criticized in the
Soviet press, whereas Peking is the
object of daily attacks. The Bank
of America, which the Soviet
press previously depicted as, a
monster, is now referred to in
congenial terms. In Soviet
judgment, the sheep are the
corporations which have made
deals with Moscow, the goats are
those who have not. Goats
become sheep by making a deal.
Issues
The issues involved are
extremely complex. For example,
the nuclear weapons problem is
such that only a few specialists
can talk knowledgeably; and
many seasoned diplomats admit
that they are bewildered. Yet
both sides live in ignorance which
is not bliss. The Soviets know
only the party line which the
propaganda machine hammers
into them day and night. In the
United States the business
community wheels and deals, and
in our universities there is an
incredible lack of expertise on
contemporary Soviet affairs.
There are some excellent U.S.
correspondents in Moscow, but
the public is so obsessed with
Watergate that Moscovy is beyond
its limited ken.
