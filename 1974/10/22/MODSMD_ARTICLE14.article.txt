# 800 Patients 'Exist' At Agnews Hospital
## 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
Agnews State Hospital only 20 minutes
south on Highway 101 is a world away
from Stanford.
In the west end of the hospital people
lump on swings and climb on jungle gyms
but they are not children.
Agnews is a facility for the mentally
retarded. Currently patients range from the
severely retarded and physically handicapped
requiring close and continuing supervision, to
those capable of habitation, with
intelligence levels of moderate to borderline
retardation.
At its peak, Agnews houses 4400 patients
including both the mentally ill and the
retarded, but over the years, facilities for the
mentally ill have been phased out.
Only 800 patients live here now, aged
from 15 months to over 80 years.
Deserted Grounds
Except for a man pushing a wheelbarrel
full of leaves, the grounds seem deserted.
Large, homely, concrete buildings, one after
another, occupy spacious and manicured
lawns.
It's very quiet outside, but once inside,
the eerie calm disappears.
The first ward is referred to as the "lowest
functioning ward," by the community liaison
representative, Guard Darran. The stench of
medicine overpowers; the overhead light
fixtures glare.
Behind a locked door at the end of the
corridor is a room filled with about 30
diapered bodies, but only one of them is a
child. The rest are adults. All are grossly
disfigured.

Most of the patients lie side by side on
one large pad on the floor in the center of
the room unable to move or to change
position. Those who can move are kept in a
crib so that they can't get away.
The walls are bare. Some mobiles hang
from the ceiling. The television is on, but
people stare blankly into space. Most lack
any awareness whatsoever.
At 3:30 p.m., two women enter, pick the
bodies up from the floot,and put them on
carts. It's dinner time.
In the day room of another ward, there is
more activity. The 26 males here, aged from
45 to 75, are classified as "hybrids," with
I.Q.'s above 20. They all have some degree of
mobility, but many have hearing, speech and
vision impairments.
Bustling Room
At 4 p.m. the room is bustling. The two
psychiatric technicians rotate shifts at 3:30;
the patients inspect the new faces.
The additional presence of two female
reporters causes an unexpected stir.
The men are curious, and they display an
interest in the newcomers. Some come up
and shake hands, some say hello, others make
gestures, and the rest just look.
One patient asks, "Do you love me?"
'Compulsive Cleaner'
Another trails the reporters through their
tour of the ward, closing every door behind
them, and picking up everything in sight.
"He's a compulsive cleaner," says Ray
Stevens, psychiatric technician.
The ward is clean, but institutional. Once
again, the walls are painted a nondescript
green, and they are bare. The dormitories

look like barracks 10 beds and 10 lockers
line the walls.
Bathrooms resemble the wards with toilets
along one wall and sinks along another. There
are no urinals, Stevens said, because patients
might play in them.
Actually, there's not much else to do here.
Typical Day
Days begin at 6:30 a.m. with breakfast at
7. Patients dress and clean themselves and
make their beds. They provide stool
specimens and submit to other examinations
for lab work until noon.
After lunch they "relax" until 4 p.m.
when they receive medications. They "relax"
again until dinner is served in the cafeteria at
5:30 p.m., and at 9 they go to bed.
Arts and crafts classes exist "if you can do
it," said Stevens. There are speech classes for
those who can be taught to speak, and for
some there is sensory development.
Losing Out
"There isn't something for everyone,"
explained Stevens. "The ones that can do the
least are losing out."
Special activities like sing-alongs and
movies are planned two or three nights each
week.
Do patients enjoy the activities?
"They go," Stevens said.
On Sundays patients go to church, and
attendance is large.
Darrah explained, "The retarded are very
unusual in that sense. At levels of retardation
where you can't even talk to them, they
relate to that [spiritual activities]. It seems
to be instinctual."
