Is there a Western Union office in the Bay Area
with 24-hour service for sending 2000-word
telegrams late at night? Or is there some place
nearby with a Xerox machine which can transmit
facsimiles long distance ? —G.G.
Either you write profuse letters late at night to a
distant and impatient lover or you are a journalist
who procrastinates. Whatever your problem uh
... occupation —be prepared to drive far from
Stanford.
If you're stubborn you can go to 734 Market
St., San Francisco or 468 19th St., Oakland at any
time of the day or night for walk-in service.
Be prepared to spend some money too. That
lengthy loveletter would cost you $165.45 if you
sent it to New York City and wanted it to arrive
the same day. If you're not worried the passionate
words will melt the telegram too quickly, send a
night letter which will arrive the next working day.
That only costs $60.50 to New York.
Of course, you could decide to publish the
loveletter and send it to a New York magazine or
newspaper. Then you could send it 'press rate'
$88.34 for day press or $44.17 for night press. You
journalists can just use that rate to begin with.
As long as you're willing to spend all that
money, why don't you call New York City. It costs
35 cents for the first minute between 11 p.m. and 8
a.m. and 20 cents for ever minute thereafter.
If you are well-organized enough to get your
letter ready to send during working hours, go to the
Bookstore between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.,
Monday through Saturday to fill out a form. That
2000-word telegram may take you a few pages
though.

If you'd prefer to use the closest facsimile
service, go to De Harts Copy Service, 10835 North
Wolf Rd., Cupertino from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. You
would have to pay $5 for the first page and $4 for
each additional one.

Bug Me Update:
For those of you who matriculated here prior to
1971 and feel "stripped of your identity" because
of a statement in this column Oct. 17, Bug
apologizes. v
The sentence read "The second and third
numbers (of an 1.D.) can't be less than 71 because
the whole procedure started spring quarter, 1972."
According to Assist. Machine Liaison Beth
Solomon, the I.D. number system started spring
quarter, 1971-72. The I.D. numbers of students
who matriculated before then correspond to the
quarter and year they arrived here. In other words,
if you came here in autumn quarter, 1963 and
you're still around, your number should start with
163.
Bug has done some more research regarding a
question answered Sept. 24, "Is there some kind of
transportation from Stanford to the San Francisco
airport, San Jose airport? —A.L.S."
Airporter buses leave from the Cardinal Hotel on
Ramona and Hamilton Streets for the San
Franicsco airport at 11:25 a.m., 5:10 p.m. and
10:20 p.m. Buses for San Jose leave at 8:50 a.m.
and 8:35 p.m. The trip costs $1.95 to San
Francisco. and $2.10 to San Jose. Buses for Palo
Alto leave San Francisco at 8:15 a.m. and 8 p.m.
and leave San Jose at 10:35 a.m. and 9:30 p.m.
