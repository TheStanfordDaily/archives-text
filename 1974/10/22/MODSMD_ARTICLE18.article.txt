## Rodin Opening: 'Almost Too Much' Guitarists Play Fine Music 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Anyone who went to Memorial
Auditorium last Friday night to
see one classical guitar concert
would have been surprised . . r
pleasantly surprised. There were
at least four separate little
concerts and as the night wore on
they got better.
First, a bushy haired Pepe
Romero walked on the stage. He
seemed nervous at first and so did
the audience. They coughed
through most of his first piece,
Sarabande by Bach.
But by the time bespectacled*
Pepe finished the very difficult
"Variations on a Theme" from
Mozart's Die Zauberfloete, both
he and the audience had settled
down and were concentrating on
the music.
Then it was Pepe's brother
Angel's turn to play the guitar.
Dressed like his brother in a white
ruffled shirt, black pants and a
coat with tails, Angel began his
performance by announcing in a
heavy Spanish accent that he was
changing his program.
He played his first piece, an
easy old standard called
"Romanza" perfectly. He next
launched into "Recuerdos De La
Alhambra" by Francisco Tarrega,

a well-known piece that
hypnotized the audience.
When Angel finished his
repertoire, still another Romero
brother, C'elin, walked quietly
onto the stage. He played
"Sonatina" by Torroba.
After Celin took his bows, the
proud father, Celedonio, strutted
onto the stage.
Like a circus ringleader, he
raised his hands over his head. He
threw kisses to the audience, and
began by flawlessly playing
another well-known and popular
piece, "Leyenda" by Isaac
Albeniz.
Celedonio finished his little
concert with two of his own
pieces which combined flamenco
and classical techniques to show

that he understood the full range
of the instrument.
The audience clapped and
cheered enthusiastically.
But this was just the
intermission. When the audience
sat down again, all the Romeros
took the stage.
All of the sons watched their
father for the signal to start, and
when he gave it, they played the
"Concerto in D major for Four
Guitars" by Georg Philipp
Telemann. They seemed to really
be enjoying themselves as they
kept throwing the melody back
and forth between them.
When the program was
completed the cheering audience
brought the Romeros back for
two encores.

concerts and as the night wore on
they got better.
First, a bushy haired Pepe
Romero walked on the stage. He
seemed nervous at first and so did
the audience. They coughed
through most of his first piece,
Sarabande by Bach.
But by the time bespectacled*
Pepe finished the very difficult
"Variations on a Theme" from
Mozart's Die Zauberfloete, both
he and the audience had settled
down and were concentrating on
the music.
Then it was Pepe's brother
Angel's turn to play the guitar.
Dressed like his brother in a white
ruffled shirt, black pants and a
coat with tails, Angel began his
performance by announcing in a
heavy Spanish accent that he was
changing his program.
He played his first piece, an
easy old standard called
"Romanza" perfectly. He next
launched into "Recuerdos De La
Alhambra" by Francisco Tarrega,

a well-known piece that
hypnotized the audience.
When Angel finished his
repertoire, still another Romero
brother, C'elin, walked quietly
onto the stage. He played
"Sonatina" by Torroba.
After Celin took his bows, the
proud father, Celedonio, strutted
onto the stage.
Like a circus ringleader, he
raised his hands over his head. He
threw kisses to the audience, and
began by flawlessly playing
another well-known and popular
piece, "Leyenda" by Isaac
Albeniz.
Celedonio finished his little
concert with two of his own
pieces which combined flamenco
and classical techniques to show

that he understood the full range
of the instrument.
The audience clapped and
cheered enthusiastically.
But this was just the
intermission. When the audience
sat down again, all the Romeros
took the stage.
All of the sons watched their
father for the signal to start, and
when he gave it, they played the
"Concerto in D major for Four
Guitars" by Georg Philipp
Telemann. They seemed to really
be enjoying themselves as they
kept throwing the melody back
and forth between them.
When the program was
completed the cheering audience
brought the Romeros back for
two encores.

Anyone who went to Memorial
Auditorium last Friday night to
see one classical guitar concert
would have been surprised . . r
pleasantly surprised. There were
at least four separate little
concerts and as the night wore on
they got better.

Romero walked on the stage. He
seemed nervous at first and so did
the audience. They coughed
through most of his first piece,
Sarabande by Bach.
