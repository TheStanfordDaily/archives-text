## 'Friends And Lovers' Needs Both 
### George Dobbins 
As a general rule, beware of television programs that include an
unknown "star" as part of their title. That often indicates that such
shows are trying to sell more than they can offer. And, as with "Paul
Sand In Friends and Lovers," it means that they are less than
first-rate.
This show has received much critical praise. Prior to the start of the
new season, it was billed as a potential blockbuster. But after viewing
several episodes, we fail to see why.
The show concerns the exploits of a Boston Symphony basist.
named Robert Dreyfuss, played by (you guessed it) Paul Sand. (We're
not sure who the devil he is either, and no, he's not one of the Beach
Boys.) Fortunately, he is a decent actor sort of a Waspish Richard
Benjamin.
Sandpaper
Sadly for him, he is given scripts that even Richard Benjamin
wouldn't use for sandpaper.
In the manner of the other Mary Tyler Moore Productions (her
show, "Bob Newhart" and even the new "Rhoda"), this series
attempts to present comically touching relationships between
characters. Most of the stories are not only touching but strangling
driving their point into the viewer.
The dialogue thrives on sentimentality, no, oversentimentality. At
the end of one episode, a conversation between Dreyfus and his father
concerning a loan goes like this:
"You've given me so much. Can't you take back just a little?"
"If I take that check maybe it means you don't need me
anymore. Maybe it means I need you."
"We need each other."
Indeed, this is nice, but by the same token, this show is supposed
to be a comedy not a soap opera. Perhaps dialogue like this would get

by if the show had any real comedy. But jokes about "frozen pop-up
omelettes" and "TVdinners during the golden age of radio" just don't
make it. We can even hear the live studio audience straining to laugh.
This series lacks the sharp wit of the other MTM productions
because its characters themselves lack sharpness. And that is its biggest
problem. Nowhere do we find a Ted Baxter or a Rhoda Morgenstern
or a Lou Grant. Instead, we find an unfunny brother (Michael Pataki)
who has no clear character, an equally dull wife (Penny Marshall) and
a soporific orchestra manager (Dick Wesson) who even looks nasty
when he smiles. These people are simply nondescript.
Funny Fred
The only really promising character is Fred, the German violinist
who speaks like Henry Kissinger and actually says funny things. We
like when someone tells him that many musicians come from Europe
and he responds, "Lots of placekickers, too." We like when he
comments, "I love my parents and I'm especially happy knowing
they're happy too in Vienna." Unfortunately, the majority of
characters here do not differentiate themselves as Fred does.
We certainly will not believe that musicians are neither as
interesting nor as funny asTV newsmen, single girls and psychiatrists.
We will only believe that scriptwriters who have Dreyfus running
around between girlfriends, family and performances while cheap
violin music plays in the background simply haven't given thought to
providing this show with great characters.
The solutions to this problem are many. Perhaps we should give
this series more time to expand its characterizations. Perhaps its
writers should cut down the number of characters and present those
remaining in more depth. Or perhaps Paul Sand should remove his
name from the marquis, realizing that if the trend of "Friends And
Lovers" persists, he may shortly be looking for both at the
department of human resources.
"Paul Sand In Friends And Lovers " can be seen Saturdays at 8:30
p.m. on CBS (Channel 5).
