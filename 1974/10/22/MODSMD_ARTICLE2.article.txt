# Rising Inflation Not Solved By Controls, Shultz Says

### DAN PYNE 
Former Treasury Secretary George
P. Shultz stressed yesterday that wage
and price controls do not solve the
problem of rising inflation.
Shultz, also a former secretary of
labor and now a professor of
management and public policy at the
Graduate School of Business here,
spoke in Bishop Auditorium.
"The most powerful aspect of wage
and price controls is the effect they
have on fiscal and monetary policy,"
Shultz said. "Politicians feel that
making an attempt at fighting inflation
through controls justifies a loosening
of monetary and fiscal policy."
He explained that these
expansionary tactics serve only to
negate any benefit obtained through
the use of controls.
"This is the real problem with
controls," he added. "It shows why the
countries that use controls the least
have the lowest inflation. West
Germany is a good example."
Anti-Inflation Programs
Shultz described the "life cycle of

control" as it evolved during the recent
anti-inflationary programs between
1971 and 1974.
The first step, he said, was an
increasing concern over rising inflation.
"The public called for government to
step in and do something. Business
wanted wage controls. Labor wanted
price and profit controls. But everyone
wanted some kind of control."
This prompted consideration of a
control plan by the Administration,
but "talk about controls, and hint of
the President's favoring
control... brings about an immediate
price response," Shultz explained.
'Escalate Inflation'
"So you have to start with a price
freeze. If you try to formulate a plan
first public anticipation will escalate
inflation," he continued.
Shultz went on to explain that even
freezes can cause trouble, if they last
too long. "Make sure it appears
transitory," he said. "A freeze over any
extended period of time causes
distortions in the economy."
The market becomes transfigured,
and as a result people begin to find
loopholes in the system, Shultz said.
"The economy is so vast and so
complicated that you can't control it
from Washington," he remarked,
adding that in the application of the
controls some businesses become
unprofitable, and a scarcity of goods
results.
Evasion Of Rules
This scarcity is followed by an
evasion of the rules, as people find
ways around the controls and "go
about doing what they were doing
before," Shultz said.
"You begin to realize that although
the controls delay inflation somewhat,
they are a wasting asset," he added.
"Then you have to disengage."
This disengaging process, according
to Shultz, can be accomplished three
ways. The first, a "blow-up", occurs
when the public revolts against the
controls, refusing to abide by them.
The second method of
disengagement involves
"self-administration;" allowing each
private unit to apply the regulations to

itself. Shultz said that this was the
method used in Phase Three of former
President Richard M. Nixon's
economic game plan. However, because
inflation increased after
self-administration was begun, a third
plan was needed.
Sectional Controls
The government installed a type of
sectional control, holding one
commodity's prices down while
allowing another one to escape
restriction, then moving to another
commodity, and so on through the
market. This tactic, Shultz said, "was
reasonably successful."
And yet, Shultz added, removing
controls does not completely solve the
problem. "It's kind of a continuing
process I'm afraid."
"The fact that there were wage and
price controls creates a situation where
people are both afraid of and
anticipating inflation, creating another
price crisis, starting the cycle all over
again," he said.
Shultz pointed out that another
problem is that wage and price controls
are directed toward the larger units in
the market for political reasons.
"There is a lot of political mileage
to be made in taking on the big boys
and shouting them down, whether it
makes any economic sense or not."

George P. Shultz
Former Treasury Secretary George
P. Shultz stressed yesterday that wage
and price controls do not solve the
problem of rising inflation.
Shultz, also a former secretary of
labor and now a professor of
management and public policy at the
Graduate School of Business here,
spoke in Bishop Auditorium.
"The most powerful aspect of wage
and price controls is the effect they
have on fiscal and monetary policy,"
Shultz said. "Politicians feel that
making an attempt at fighting inflation
through controls justifies a loosening
of monetary and fiscal policy."
He explained that these
expansionary tactics serve only to
negate any benefit obtained through
the use of controls.
"This is the real problem with
controls," he added. "It shows why the
countries that use controls the least
have the lowest inflation. West
Germany is a good example."
Anti-Inflation Programs
Shultz described the "life cycle of

control" as it evolved during the recent
anti-inflationary programs between
1971 and 1974.
The first step, he said, was an
increasing concern over rising inflation.
"The public called for government to
step in and do something. Business
wanted wage controls. Labor wanted
price and profit controls. But everyone
wanted some kind of control."
This prompted consideration of a
control plan by the Administration,
but "talk about controls, and hint of
the President's favoring
control... brings about an immediate
price response," Shultz explained.
'Escalate Inflation'
"So you have to start with a price
freeze. If you try to formulate a plan
first public anticipation will escalate
inflation," he continued.
Shultz went on to explain that even
freezes can cause trouble, if they last
too long. "Make sure it appears
transitory," he said. "A freeze over any
extended period of time causes
distortions in the economy."
The market becomes transfigured,
and as a result people begin to find
loopholes in the system, Shultz said.
"The economy is so vast and so
complicated that you can't control it
from Washington," he remarked,
adding that in the application of the
controls some businesses become
unprofitable, and a scarcity of goods
results.
Evasion Of Rules
This scarcity is followed by an
evasion of the rules, as people find
ways around the controls and "go
about doing what they were doing
before," Shultz said.
"You begin to realize that although
the controls delay inflation somewhat,
they are a wasting asset," he added.
"Then you have to disengage."
This disengaging process, according
to Shultz, can be accomplished three
ways. The first, a "blow-up", occurs
when the public revolts against the
controls, refusing to abide by them.
The second method of
disengagement involves
"self-administration;" allowing each
private unit to apply the regulations to

itself. Shultz said that this was the
method used in Phase Three of former
President Richard M. Nixon's
economic game plan. However, because
inflation increased after
self-administration was begun, a third
plan was needed.
Sectional Controls
The government installed a type of
sectional control, holding one
commodity's prices down while
allowing another one to escape
restriction, then moving to another
commodity, and so on through the
market. This tactic, Shultz said, "was
reasonably successful."
And yet, Shultz added, removing
controls does not completely solve the
problem. "It's kind of a continuing
process I'm afraid."
"The fact that there were wage and
price controls creates a situation where
people are both afraid of and
anticipating inflation, creating another
price crisis, starting the cycle all over
again," he said.
Shultz pointed out that another
problem is that wage and price controls
are directed toward the larger units in
the market for political reasons.
"There is a lot of political mileage
to be made in taking on the big boys
and shouting them down, whether it
makes any economic sense or not."
