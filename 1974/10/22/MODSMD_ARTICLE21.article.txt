Mexican Summit Concludes
TUBAC, Ariz. Mexican President Luis
Echeverria bluntly told President Ford
yesterday that if the United States wants a share
of Mexico's newly discovered oil deposits, it will
have to pay the current high world market price.
Concluding a day of border-straddling summit
talks, Ford and Echeverria appeared at a joint
news conference at a country club dining room
and made these other disclosures:
—Mexico has given up hope of negotiating a
new treaty with the United States on migrant
farm workers, but insists that the Mexican
workers' rights be observed while they are in the
United States;
—Ford's opposition to formal recognition of
Cuba remains unchanged, with the U.S.
President saying, "Since there is no change in
the attitude of Cuba, we certainly have to
maintain our attitude ..."
—The United States is dropping its
opposition to a proposed United Nations charter
provision initiated by Echeverria on the
economic rights and duties of nations.
The two presidents met first in the border
city of Nogalesi then helicoptered to the
mountain town of Magdalena de Kino in Mexico
before flying to this desert resort south of
Tucson to conclude their talks and hold the
joint news conference.
The first question was on the recently
discovered oil deposits in southern Mexico and
whether the two presidents had discussed
American access to the deposits.
"Si," Echeverria responded in Spanish,
adding through a translator that "Mexico sells to
whoever wants to buy oil at the market price in
the world market."
He disclosed for the first time that Mexican
oil already is flowing to the Latin American
nations, Uruguay and Brazil, as well as the
United States and Israel.
He skirted a direct answer on the size of the
new oil find but said more than one-third of
Mexico's current daily production of 635,000
barrels "comes from only a few wells" in the
region of the new strike.
Dean Testifies On Mitchell
WASHINGTON - John W. Dean 111 testified
yesterday that he and other senior White House
aides decided in March 1973 that to solve their
Watergate problems, John N. Mitchell would
have to admit his guilt for the break-in at the
Democratic National Committee.
Dean said on his fourth day on the witness

stand at the Watergate cover-up trial that the
idea lapsed when neither H.R. Haldeman nor
John D. Ehrlichraan proposed to Mitchell that
he take blame as planned.
Mitchell, a former attorney general,
Haldeman and Ehrlichman are among five
defendants at the trial.
Dean said a meeting on March 22,1973, was
called where either Ehrlichman or Haldeman
was to suggest that Mitchell "step forward and
account for activities prior to June 17."
The original Watergate burglars were caught
at Democratic National Committee headquarters
on June 17,1972.
In answer to questions from prosecutor
James F. Neal, Dean testified that he and other
White House officials were hopeful "that would
eliminate investigation of activities after June
17."
Earlier, Dean testified that he had proposed
on March 21 that Mitchell "admit his guilt" for
the break-in.
Meanwhile, the jury heard a sixth White
House tape in which former President Richard
M. Nixon declares on the afternoon of March
22, "We're going to protect our people, if we
can."
The jurors heard Nixon say in a flat
emotionless tone to Mitchell:
"I want you all to stonewall it, let them
plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up or
anything else, if it'll save it save the plan.
That's the whole point."
Jaworski Anticipates Charges
WASHINGTON - Special Watergate
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski indicated yesterday
he expects more charges will be brought in cases
still under investigation by his office.
In an interview, Jaworski declined to discuss
specific areas where new charges might be
expected. He did say that investigations of
illegal campaign contributions and the ITT
anti-trust case are "not yet completed."
Jaworski was asked if he would pursue an
investigation against an individual who already
had been convicted in another Watergate case.
"The fact that he is convicted in one
Watergate case does not mean he is not going to
be charged in another," the prosecutor replied.
Jaworski refused to discuss a specific
possibility, the case of former Atty. Gen. John
N. Mitchell, one of five defendants in the
Watergate cover-up trial.
It is understood that one of the matters
under investigation by the prosecutor's ITT task

force is Mitchell's testimony about the merger
before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mitchell testified at the hearings of the
nomination of Richard G. Kleindienst to be
attorney general. As a result of their testimony
at those hearings, charges were brought against
both Kleindienst and former California Lt. Gov.
Ed Reinecke.
Kleindienst pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge of failing to testify fully. Reinecke was
convicted to one count of perjury.
The charges against both men were based on
their testimony about ITT, which was the main
issue raised at the confirmation hearings.
Extortionist Demands $1 Million
SEATTLE Power companies said yesterday
that beefed-up security measures can provide no
ultimate defense against an extortionist who has
demanded $1 million to stop sabotaging power
transmission towers.
"There aren't enough people in the society to
stand guard on all the towers in all their
locations," Don Hodel, chief of the Bonneville
Power Administration, (BPA) told a news
conference.
The dynamite blasts are still viewed as
threatening a possible blackout in the Portland
area. But the BPA, a federal agency that
distributes power throughout the Northwest,
has warned all area utilities to the possible
sabotage.
"Any electric system anywhere is
vulnerable," said Mike Sharar, a spokesman for
Seattle City Light, a publicly owned utility that
was one of those alerted by the BPA.
Neither Hodel nor Sharar would give specific
details about how security has been increased
since explosions at power towers began Sept.
26. Hodel said his agency has increased flights
over lines and ground patrols and security at
other facilities. He said hunters and other
citizens have been enlisted to aid the security
effort.
Eleven BPA transmission lines in Oregon have
been damaged by dynamite blasts, causing an
estimated $150,000 damage. Five of the blasts
occurred last Wednesday and the BPA received a
letter Friday in Portland demanding the $1
million.
Woman Sentenced For Murder
MONTEREY Inez Garcia was sentenced to
five years to life in prison yesterday for the
slaying of a man she said helped to rape her.
Feminist supporters protested and shouted
"Free Inez."

Women in the crowded courtroom screamed
in anger when Monterey County Superior Court
Judge Stanley Lawson imposed sentence on the
handcuffed defendant. They cited the case as an
example of how women are treated in rape
cases.
Garcia, 30, was convicted of second-degree
murder Oct. 4 in the slaying of Miguel Jiminez
of Soledad. She admitted on the stand that she
killed Jiminez, saying he had held her down
while another man raped her. She said she had
no regrets.
Her attorney, Charles Garry, said he would
appeal.
About 200 supporters jammed the small
courtroom and the hallway outside. Several
feminist groups had attended the trial and
promised demonstrations here and in other
cities to coincide with the sentencing.
Trial Begins For Guardsmen
CLEVELAND, Ohio Prospective jurors
were warned yesterday against being influenced
by prejudice, publicity or sympathy as trial
began for eight former Ohio National Guardmen
indicted in the 1970 Kent State University
shootings.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge Frank J.
Battisti told prospective jurors that "because of
the publicity this case has received, some of you
probably have read, heard or seen something"
about it.
But that alone wouldn't warrant dismissal
from the jury, he said, adding that they would
be disqualified if they felt the publicity left
them unable to render a fair and impartial
verdict.
Battisti said he expected the trial to last
about six weeks but that jurors would not be
sequestered. He said court would be in session
four days a week.
The eight ex-Guardmen are charged with
wilfully assaulting and intimidating four persons
killed and another nine who were wounded
during the May 4, 1970 confrontation between
Guardmen and students protesting U.S. military
involvement in Cambodia.
The defendants also were charged with
depriving the victims of their constitutional
rights by firing at or near them and the crowd of
demonstrators.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Warm afternoon
temperatures but cool nights. Lows tonight mid
40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow 70s

estimated $150,000 damage. Five of the blasts
occurred last Wednesday and the BPA received a
letter Friday in Portland demanding the $1
million.
Woman Sentenced For Murder
MONTEREY Inez Garcia was sentenced to
five years to life in prison yesterday for the
slaying of a man she said helped to rape her.
Feminist supporters protested and shouted
"Free Inez."

Women in the crowded courtroom screamed
in anger when Monterey County Superior Court
Judge Stanley Lawson imposed sentence on the
handcuffed defendant. They cited the case as an
example of how women are treated in rape
cases.
Garcia, 30, was convicted of second-degree
murder Oct. 4 in the slaying of Miguel Jiminez
of Soledad. She admitted on the stand that she
killed Jiminez, saying he had held her down
while another man raped her. She said she had
no regrets.
Her attorney, Charles Garry, said he would
appeal.
About 200 supporters jammed the small
courtroom and the hallway outside. Several
feminist groups had attended the trial and
promised demonstrations here and in other
cities to coincide with the sentencing.
Trial Begins For Guardsmen
CLEVELAND, Ohio Prospective jurors
were warned yesterday against being influenced
by prejudice, publicity or sympathy as trial
began for eight former Ohio National Guardmen
indicted in the 1970 Kent State University
shootings.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge Frank J.
Battisti told prospective jurors that "because of
the publicity this case has received, some of you
probably have read, heard or seen something"
about it.
But that alone wouldn't warrant dismissal
from the jury, he said, adding that they would
be disqualified if they felt the publicity left
them unable to render a fair and impartial
verdict.
Battisti said he expected the trial to last
about six weeks but that jurors would not be
sequestered. He said court would be in session
four days a week.
The eight ex-Guardmen are charged with
wilfully assaulting and intimidating four persons
killed and another nine who were wounded
during the May 4, 1970 confrontation between
Guardmen and students protesting U.S. military
involvement in Cambodia.
The defendants also were charged with
depriving the victims of their constitutional
rights by firing at or near them and the crowd of
demonstrators.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Warm afternoon
temperatures but cool nights. Lows tonight mid
40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow 70s

Mexican Summit Concludes
TUBAC, Ariz. Mexican President Luis
Echeverria bluntly told President Ford
yesterday that if the United States wants a share
of Mexico's newly discovered oil deposits, it will
have to pay the current high world market price.
Concluding a day of border-straddling summit
talks, Ford and Echeverria appeared at a joint
news conference at a country club dining room
and made these other disclosures:
—Mexico has given up hope of negotiating a
new treaty with the United States on migrant
farm workers, but insists that the Mexican
workers' rights be observed while they are in the
United States;
—Ford's opposition to formal recognition of
Cuba remains unchanged, with the U.S.
President saying, "Since there is no change in
the attitude of Cuba, we certainly have to
maintain our attitude ..."
—The United States is dropping its
opposition to a proposed United Nations charter
provision initiated by Echeverria on the
economic rights and duties of nations.
The two presidents met first in the border
city of Nogalesi then helicoptered to the
mountain town of Magdalena de Kino in Mexico
before flying to this desert resort south of
Tucson to conclude their talks and hold the
joint news conference.
The first question was on the recently
discovered oil deposits in southern Mexico and
whether the two presidents had discussed
American access to the deposits.
"Si," Echeverria responded in Spanish,
adding through a translator that "Mexico sells to
whoever wants to buy oil at the market price in
the world market."
He disclosed for the first time that Mexican
oil already is flowing to the Latin American
nations, Uruguay and Brazil, as well as the
United States and Israel.
He skirted a direct answer on the size of the
new oil find but said more than one-third of
Mexico's current daily production of 635,000
barrels "comes from only a few wells" in the
region of the new strike.
Dean Testifies On Mitchell
WASHINGTON - John W. Dean 111 testified
yesterday that he and other senior White House
aides decided in March 1973 that to solve their
Watergate problems, John N. Mitchell would
have to admit his guilt for the break-in at the
Democratic National Committee.
Dean said on his fourth day on the witness

stand at the Watergate cover-up trial that the
idea lapsed when neither H.R. Haldeman nor
John D. Ehrlichraan proposed to Mitchell that
he take blame as planned.
Mitchell, a former attorney general,
Haldeman and Ehrlichman are among five
defendants at the trial.
Dean said a meeting on March 22,1973, was
called where either Ehrlichman or Haldeman
was to suggest that Mitchell "step forward and
account for activities prior to June 17."
The original Watergate burglars were caught
at Democratic National Committee headquarters
on June 17,1972.
In answer to questions from prosecutor
James F. Neal, Dean testified that he and other
White House officials were hopeful "that would
eliminate investigation of activities after June
17."
Earlier, Dean testified that he had proposed
on March 21 that Mitchell "admit his guilt" for
the break-in.
Meanwhile, the jury heard a sixth White
House tape in which former President Richard
M. Nixon declares on the afternoon of March
22, "We're going to protect our people, if we
can."
The jurors heard Nixon say in a flat
emotionless tone to Mitchell:
"I want you all to stonewall it, let them
plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up or
anything else, if it'll save it save the plan.
That's the whole point."
Jaworski Anticipates Charges
WASHINGTON - Special Watergate
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski indicated yesterday
he expects more charges will be brought in cases
still under investigation by his office.
In an interview, Jaworski declined to discuss
specific areas where new charges might be
expected. He did say that investigations of
illegal campaign contributions and the ITT
anti-trust case are "not yet completed."
Jaworski was asked if he would pursue an
investigation against an individual who already
had been convicted in another Watergate case.
"The fact that he is convicted in one
Watergate case does not mean he is not going to
be charged in another," the prosecutor replied.
Jaworski refused to discuss a specific
possibility, the case of former Atty. Gen. John
N. Mitchell, one of five defendants in the
Watergate cover-up trial.
It is understood that one of the matters
under investigation by the prosecutor's ITT task

force is Mitchell's testimony about the merger
before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mitchell testified at the hearings of the
nomination of Richard G. Kleindienst to be
attorney general. As a result of their testimony
at those hearings, charges were brought against
both Kleindienst and former California Lt. Gov.
Ed Reinecke.
Kleindienst pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge of failing to testify fully. Reinecke was
convicted to one count of perjury.
The charges against both men were based on
their testimony about ITT, which was the main
issue raised at the confirmation hearings.
Extortionist Demands $1 Million
SEATTLE Power companies said yesterday
that beefed-up security measures can provide no
ultimate defense against an extortionist who has
demanded $1 million to stop sabotaging power
transmission towers.
"There aren't enough people in the society to
stand guard on all the towers in all their
locations," Don Hodel, chief of the Bonneville
Power Administration, (BPA) told a news
conference.
The dynamite blasts are still viewed as
threatening a possible blackout in the Portland
area. But the BPA, a federal agency that
distributes power throughout the Northwest,
has warned all area utilities to the possible
sabotage.
"Any electric system anywhere is
vulnerable," said Mike Sharar, a spokesman for
Seattle City Light, a publicly owned utility that
was one of those alerted by the BPA.
Neither Hodel nor Sharar would give specific
details about how security has been increased
since explosions at power towers began Sept.
26. Hodel said his agency has increased flights
over lines and ground patrols and security at
other facilities. He said hunters and other
citizens have been enlisted to aid the security
effort.
Eleven BPA transmission lines in Oregon have
been damaged by dynamite blasts, causing an
estimated $150,000 damage. Five of the blasts
occurred last Wednesday and the BPA received a
letter Friday in Portland demanding the $1

he expects more charges will be brought in cases
still under investigation by his office.
In an interview, Jaworski declined to discuss
specific areas where new charges might be
expected. He did say that investigations of
illegal campaign contributions and the ITT
anti-trust case are "not yet completed."
Jaworski was asked if he would pursue an
investigation against an individual who already
had been convicted in another Watergate case.
"The fact that he is convicted in one
Watergate case does not mean he is not going to
be charged in another," the prosecutor replied.
Jaworski refused to discuss a specific
possibility, the case of former Atty. Gen. John
N. Mitchell, one of five defendants in the
Watergate cover-up trial.
It is understood that one of the matters
under investigation by the prosecutor's ITT task

force is Mitchell's testimony about the merger
before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mitchell testified at the hearings of the
nomination of Richard G. Kleindienst to be
attorney general. As a result of their testimony
at those hearings, charges were brought against
both Kleindienst and former California Lt. Gov.
Ed Reinecke.
Kleindienst pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge of failing to testify fully. Reinecke was
convicted to one count of perjury.
The charges against both men were based on
their testimony about ITT, which was the main
issue raised at the confirmation hearings.
Extortionist Demands $1 Million
SEATTLE Power companies said yesterday
that beefed-up security measures can provide no
ultimate defense against an extortionist who has
demanded $1 million to stop sabotaging power
transmission towers.
"There aren't enough people in the society to
stand guard on all the towers in all their
locations," Don Hodel, chief of the Bonneville
Power Administration, (BPA) told a news
conference.
The dynamite blasts are still viewed as
threatening a possible blackout in the Portland
area. But the BPA, a federal agency that
distributes power throughout the Northwest,
has warned all area utilities to the possible
sabotage.
"Any electric system anywhere is
vulnerable," said Mike Sharar, a spokesman for
Seattle City Light, a publicly owned utility that
was one of those alerted by the BPA.
Neither Hodel nor Sharar would give specific
details about how security has been increased
since explosions at power towers began Sept.
26. Hodel said his agency has increased flights
over lines and ground patrols and security at
other facilities. He said hunters and other
citizens have been enlisted to aid the security
effort.
Eleven BPA transmission lines in Oregon have
been damaged by dynamite blasts, causing an
estimated $150,000 damage. Five of the blasts
occurred last Wednesday and the BPA received a
letter Friday in Portland demanding the $1
million.
Woman Sentenced For Murder
MONTEREY Inez Garcia was sentenced to
five years to life in prison yesterday for the
slaying of a man she said helped to rape her.
Feminist supporters protested and shouted
"Free Inez."

Women in the crowded courtroom screamed
in anger when Monterey County Superior Court
Judge Stanley Lawson imposed sentence on the
handcuffed defendant. They cited the case as an
example of how women are treated in rape
cases.
Garcia, 30, was convicted of second-degree
murder Oct. 4 in the slaying of Miguel Jiminez
of Soledad. She admitted on the stand that she
killed Jiminez, saying he had held her down
while another man raped her. She said she had
no regrets.
Her attorney, Charles Garry, said he would
appeal.
About 200 supporters jammed the small
courtroom and the hallway outside. Several
feminist groups had attended the trial and
promised demonstrations here and in other
cities to coincide with the sentencing.
Trial Begins For Guardsmen
CLEVELAND, Ohio Prospective jurors
were warned yesterday against being influenced
by prejudice, publicity or sympathy as trial
began for eight former Ohio National Guardmen
indicted in the 1970 Kent State University
shootings.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge Frank J.
Battisti told prospective jurors that "because of
the publicity this case has received, some of you
probably have read, heard or seen something"
about it.
But that alone wouldn't warrant dismissal
from the jury, he said, adding that they would
be disqualified if they felt the publicity left
them unable to render a fair and impartial
verdict.
Battisti said he expected the trial to last
about six weeks but that jurors would not be
sequestered. He said court would be in session
four days a week.
The eight ex-Guardmen are charged with
wilfully assaulting and intimidating four persons
killed and another nine who were wounded
during the May 4, 1970 confrontation between
Guardmen and students protesting U.S. military
involvement in Cambodia.
The defendants also were charged with
depriving the victims of their constitutional
rights by firing at or near them and the crowd of
demonstrators.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Warm afternoon
temperatures but cool nights. Lows tonight mid
40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow 70s

Mexican Summit Concludes
TUBAC, Ariz. Mexican President Luis
Echeverria bluntly told President Ford
yesterday that if the United States wants a share
of Mexico's newly discovered oil deposits, it will
have to pay the current high world market price.
Concluding a day of border-straddling summit
talks, Ford and Echeverria appeared at a joint
news conference at a country club dining room
and made these other disclosures:
—Mexico has given up hope of negotiating a
new treaty with the United States on migrant
farm workers, but insists that the Mexican
workers' rights be observed while they are in the
United States;
—Ford's opposition to formal recognition of
Cuba remains unchanged, with the U.S.
President saying, "Since there is no change in
the attitude of Cuba, we certainly have to
maintain our attitude ..."
—The United States is dropping its
opposition to a proposed United Nations charter
provision initiated by Echeverria on the
economic rights and duties of nations.
The two presidents met first in the border
city of Nogalesi then helicoptered to the
mountain town of Magdalena de Kino in Mexico
before flying to this desert resort south of
Tucson to conclude their talks and hold the
joint news conference.
The first question was on the recently
discovered oil deposits in southern Mexico and
whether the two presidents had discussed
American access to the deposits.
"Si," Echeverria responded in Spanish,
adding through a translator that "Mexico sells to
whoever wants to buy oil at the market price in
the world market."
He disclosed for the first time that Mexican
oil already is flowing to the Latin American
nations, Uruguay and Brazil, as well as the
United States and Israel.
He skirted a direct answer on the size of the
new oil find but said more than one-third of
Mexico's current daily production of 635,000
barrels "comes from only a few wells" in the
region of the new strike.
Dean Testifies On Mitchell
WASHINGTON - John W. Dean 111 testified
yesterday that he and other senior White House
aides decided in March 1973 that to solve their
Watergate problems, John N. Mitchell would
have to admit his guilt for the break-in at the
Democratic National Committee.
Dean said on his fourth day on the witness

stand at the Watergate cover-up trial that the
idea lapsed when neither H.R. Haldeman nor
John D. Ehrlichraan proposed to Mitchell that
he take blame as planned.
Mitchell, a former attorney general,
Haldeman and Ehrlichman are among five
defendants at the trial.
Dean said a meeting on March 22,1973, was
called where either Ehrlichman or Haldeman
was to suggest that Mitchell "step forward and
account for activities prior to June 17."
The original Watergate burglars were caught
at Democratic National Committee headquarters
on June 17,1972.
In answer to questions from prosecutor
James F. Neal, Dean testified that he and other
White House officials were hopeful "that would
eliminate investigation of activities after June
17."
Earlier, Dean testified that he had proposed
on March 21 that Mitchell "admit his guilt" for
the break-in.
Meanwhile, the jury heard a sixth White
House tape in which former President Richard
M. Nixon declares on the afternoon of March
22, "We're going to protect our people, if we
can."
The jurors heard Nixon say in a flat
emotionless tone to Mitchell:
"I want you all to stonewall it, let them
plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up or
anything else, if it'll save it save the plan.
That's the whole point."

The first question was on the recently
discovered oil deposits in southern Mexico and
whether the two presidents had discussed
American access to the deposits.
"Si," Echeverria responded in Spanish,
adding through a translator that "Mexico sells to
whoever wants to buy oil at the market price in
the world market."
He disclosed for the first time that Mexican
oil already is flowing to the Latin American
nations, Uruguay and Brazil, as well as the
United States and Israel.
He skirted a direct answer on the size of the
new oil find but said more than one-third of
Mexico's current daily production of 635,000
barrels "comes from only a few wells" in the
region of the new strike.
Dean Testifies On Mitchell
WASHINGTON - John W. Dean 111 testified
yesterday that he and other senior White House
aides decided in March 1973 that to solve their
Watergate problems, John N. Mitchell would
have to admit his guilt for the break-in at the
Democratic National Committee.
Dean said on his fourth day on the witness

stand at the Watergate cover-up trial that the
idea lapsed when neither H.R. Haldeman nor
John D. Ehrlichraan proposed to Mitchell that
he take blame as planned.
Mitchell, a former attorney general,
Haldeman and Ehrlichman are among five
defendants at the trial.
Dean said a meeting on March 22,1973, was
called where either Ehrlichman or Haldeman
was to suggest that Mitchell "step forward and
account for activities prior to June 17."
The original Watergate burglars were caught
at Democratic National Committee headquarters
on June 17,1972.
In answer to questions from prosecutor
James F. Neal, Dean testified that he and other
White House officials were hopeful "that would
eliminate investigation of activities after June
17."
Earlier, Dean testified that he had proposed
on March 21 that Mitchell "admit his guilt" for
the break-in.
Meanwhile, the jury heard a sixth White
House tape in which former President Richard
M. Nixon declares on the afternoon of March
22, "We're going to protect our people, if we
can."
The jurors heard Nixon say in a flat
emotionless tone to Mitchell:
"I want you all to stonewall it, let them
plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up or
anything else, if it'll save it save the plan.
That's the whole point."
Jaworski Anticipates Charges
WASHINGTON - Special Watergate
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski indicated yesterday
he expects more charges will be brought in cases
still under investigation by his office.
In an interview, Jaworski declined to discuss
specific areas where new charges might be
expected. He did say that investigations of
illegal campaign contributions and the ITT
anti-trust case are "not yet completed."
Jaworski was asked if he would pursue an
investigation against an individual who already
had been convicted in another Watergate case.
"The fact that he is convicted in one
Watergate case does not mean he is not going to
be charged in another," the prosecutor replied.
Jaworski refused to discuss a specific
possibility, the case of former Atty. Gen. John
N. Mitchell, one of five defendants in the
Watergate cover-up trial.
It is understood that one of the matters
under investigation by the prosecutor's ITT task

force is Mitchell's testimony about the merger
before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mitchell testified at the hearings of the
nomination of Richard G. Kleindienst to be
attorney general. As a result of their testimony
at those hearings, charges were brought against
both Kleindienst and former California Lt. Gov.
Ed Reinecke.
Kleindienst pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge of failing to testify fully. Reinecke was
convicted to one count of perjury.
The charges against both men were based on
their testimony about ITT, which was the main
issue raised at the confirmation hearings.
Extortionist Demands $1 Million
SEATTLE Power companies said yesterday
that beefed-up security measures can provide no
ultimate defense against an extortionist who has
demanded $1 million to stop sabotaging power
transmission towers.
"There aren't enough people in the society to
stand guard on all the towers in all their
locations," Don Hodel, chief of the Bonneville
Power Administration, (BPA) told a news
conference.
The dynamite blasts are still viewed as
threatening a possible blackout in the Portland
area. But the BPA, a federal agency that
distributes power throughout the Northwest,
has warned all area utilities to the possible
sabotage.
"Any electric system anywhere is
vulnerable," said Mike Sharar, a spokesman for
Seattle City Light, a publicly owned utility that
was one of those alerted by the BPA.
Neither Hodel nor Sharar would give specific
details about how security has been increased
since explosions at power towers began Sept.
26. Hodel said his agency has increased flights
over lines and ground patrols and security at
other facilities. He said hunters and other
citizens have been enlisted to aid the security
effort.
Eleven BPA transmission lines in Oregon have
been damaged by dynamite blasts, causing an
estimated $150,000 damage. Five of the blasts
occurred last Wednesday and the BPA received a
letter Friday in Portland demanding the $1
million.
Woman Sentenced For Murder
MONTEREY Inez Garcia was sentenced to
five years to life in prison yesterday for the
slaying of a man she said helped to rape her.
Feminist supporters protested and shouted
"Free Inez."

Women in the crowded courtroom screamed
in anger when Monterey County Superior Court
Judge Stanley Lawson imposed sentence on the
handcuffed defendant. They cited the case as an
example of how women are treated in rape
cases.
Garcia, 30, was convicted of second-degree
murder Oct. 4 in the slaying of Miguel Jiminez
of Soledad. She admitted on the stand that she
killed Jiminez, saying he had held her down
while another man raped her. She said she had
no regrets.
Her attorney, Charles Garry, said he would
appeal.
About 200 supporters jammed the small
courtroom and the hallway outside. Several
feminist groups had attended the trial and
promised demonstrations here and in other
cities to coincide with the sentencing.
Trial Begins For Guardsmen
CLEVELAND, Ohio Prospective jurors
were warned yesterday against being influenced
by prejudice, publicity or sympathy as trial
began for eight former Ohio National Guardmen
indicted in the 1970 Kent State University
shootings.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge Frank J.
Battisti told prospective jurors that "because of
the publicity this case has received, some of you
probably have read, heard or seen something"
about it.
But that alone wouldn't warrant dismissal
from the jury, he said, adding that they would
be disqualified if they felt the publicity left
them unable to render a fair and impartial
verdict.
Battisti said he expected the trial to last
about six weeks but that jurors would not be
sequestered. He said court would be in session
four days a week.
The eight ex-Guardmen are charged with
wilfully assaulting and intimidating four persons
killed and another nine who were wounded
during the May 4, 1970 confrontation between
Guardmen and students protesting U.S. military
involvement in Cambodia.
The defendants also were charged with
depriving the victims of their constitutional
rights by firing at or near them and the crowd of
demonstrators.

Mexican Summit Concludes
TUBAC, Ariz. Mexican President Luis
Echeverria bluntly told President Ford
yesterday that if the United States wants a share
of Mexico's newly discovered oil deposits, it will
have to pay the current high world market price.
Concluding a day of border-straddling summit
talks, Ford and Echeverria appeared at a joint
news conference at a country club dining room
and made these other disclosures:
—Mexico has given up hope of negotiating a
new treaty with the United States on migrant
farm workers, but insists that the Mexican
workers' rights be observed while they are in the
United States;
—Ford's opposition to formal recognition of
Cuba remains unchanged, with the U.S.
President saying, "Since there is no change in
the attitude of Cuba, we certainly have to
maintain our attitude ..."
—The United States is dropping its
opposition to a proposed United Nations charter
provision initiated by Echeverria on the
economic rights and duties of nations.
The two presidents met first in the border
city of Nogalesi then helicoptered to the
mountain town of Magdalena de Kino in Mexico
before flying to this desert resort south of
Tucson to conclude their talks and hold the
joint news conference.
The first question was on the recently
discovered oil deposits in southern Mexico and
whether the two presidents had discussed
American access to the deposits.
"Si," Echeverria responded in Spanish,
adding through a translator that "Mexico sells to
whoever wants to buy oil at the market price in
the world market."
He disclosed for the first time that Mexican
oil already is flowing to the Latin American
nations, Uruguay and Brazil, as well as the
United States and Israel.
He skirted a direct answer on the size of the
new oil find but said more than one-third of
Mexico's current daily production of 635,000
barrels "comes from only a few wells" in the
region of the new strike.

were warned yesterday against being influenced
by prejudice, publicity or sympathy as trial
began for eight former Ohio National Guardmen
indicted in the 1970 Kent State University
shootings.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge Frank J.
Battisti told prospective jurors that "because of
the publicity this case has received, some of you
probably have read, heard or seen something"
about it.
But that alone wouldn't warrant dismissal
from the jury, he said, adding that they would
be disqualified if they felt the publicity left
them unable to render a fair and impartial
verdict.
Battisti said he expected the trial to last
about six weeks but that jurors would not be
sequestered. He said court would be in session
four days a week.
The eight ex-Guardmen are charged with
wilfully assaulting and intimidating four persons
killed and another nine who were wounded
during the May 4, 1970 confrontation between
Guardmen and students protesting U.S. military
involvement in Cambodia.
The defendants also were charged with
depriving the victims of their constitutional
rights by firing at or near them and the crowd of
demonstrators.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Warm afternoon
temperatures but cool nights. Lows tonight mid
40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow 70s
to mid 80s.
