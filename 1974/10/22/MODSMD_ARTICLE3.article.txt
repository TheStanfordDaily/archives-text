# Peace And Freedom Aspirant
## Candidate Hits Federal Intrusion 
### JOHN FREED 
The Peace and Freedom Party's
candidate for governor, Elizabeth
Keathley, took big government to task
last night in an appearance here.
Speaking to a group of about 20
students in the Soto House lounge,
Keathley lashed out against
government's intrusion into citizens'
daily lives.
A self-described "anarchist" and
"libertarian," the Candidate traced her
political philosophy to her early work
with the United Farm Workers and
Amnesty International.
"I became involved with a great
many socialists in those days. Even
though these people were anti-war and
pro-civil-liberties or so they
said—they kept trying to run my life
for me. So I became an anarchist," she
explained.
Keathley, 21, who calls herself "a
feminist writer," supports individual
civil rights, a non-interventionist
foreign policy and pure capitalism
without governmental interference.
Laetrile Ban
As an example of federal
interference with the free market, she
cited the policy of the Food and Drug
Administratis! (FDA) banning the use
of Laetrile for treatment of cancer
victims.
"The FDA outlawed Laetrile. There
is some evidence that it does arrest
some cases of cancer; there is some
evidence that it does not arrest some
cases of cancer. But the FDA doesn't
give us that choice. We can buy
Vitamin B-17, however, which is the
same substance as Laetrile, but no one
can tell you how much to use to arrest
a case of cancer," she remarked.
She called for immediate repeal of
so-called "victimless crime" laws,

including those prohibiting
prostitution and drug abuse. She
argued that governmental control does
nothing to stem the use of dangerous
drugs or to reduce the frequency of
prostitution, and the prohibitions
force organized crime to satisfy desires
in these fields.
'Black Market Trade'
"Syndicated crime depends on
black market trade to keep operating,"
Keathley noted. She added that many
violent crimes are committed by
persons who must pay exhorbitant
prices on the black market to buy
drugs.
"The chief of police in Los Angeles
says that 80 to 90 percent of violent
crimes there are caused by junkies and
the like supporting their habits," she
said.
During a question-and-answer
period, an onlooker asked Keathley
how she could justify running for
governor if she wanted to abolish
government.
Doesn't Expect Victory
"I have no problems running," she
responded. "I would just have some
problems taking office." She added
that she did not expect to win the
governorship.
"I have the right to run," Keathley
explained, "but I'm not going to be
elected."
Keathley then launched into a
discussion of specific aspects of her
political philosophy, including her
views on:
—education ("Public schools should
be abolished.");
—pollution ("I cannot trust any
government to stop polluters.) and;
—safety of nuclear reactors ("Has

the government ever made anything
safe for us? The government makes
decisions on the basis of politics, not
safety.").
Opposes Public Education
She defended her position opposing
public education in a free-for-all
debate during which one-third of the
spectators left the room to continue a
related discussion.
"We now have a system that is very
expensive and tries to inculcate the
values of the power structure," she
claimed. When asked how the poor
could afford education, she
responded:
"Parents could use the money they
would have paid in taxes to hire a
private tutor or send their kids to a
'free school.' The present system is
extremely inefficient."

"The chief of police in Los Angeles
says that 80 to 90 percent of violent
crimes there are caused by junkies and
the like supporting their habits," she
said.
During a question-and-answer
period, an onlooker asked Keathley
how she could justify running for
governor if she wanted to abolish
government.
Doesn't Expect Victory
"I have no problems running," she
responded. "I would just have some
problems taking office." She added
that she did not expect to win the
governorship.
"I have the right to run," Keathley
explained, "but I'm not going to be
elected."
Keathley then launched into a
discussion of specific aspects of her
political philosophy, including her
views on:
—education ("Public schools should
be abolished.");
—pollution ("I cannot trust any
government to stop polluters.) and;
—safety of nuclear reactors ("Has

the government ever made anything
safe for us? The government makes
decisions on the basis of politics, not
safety.").
Opposes Public Education
She defended her position opposing
public education in a free-for-all
debate during which one-third of the
spectators left the room to continue a
related discussion.
"We now have a system that is very
expensive and tries to inculcate the
values of the power structure," she
claimed. When asked how the poor
could afford education, she
responded:
"Parents could use the money they
would have paid in taxes to hire a
private tutor or send their kids to a
'free school.' The present system is
extremely inefficient."
The Peace and Freedom Party's
candidate for governor, Elizabeth
Keathley, took big government to task
last night in an appearance here.
Speaking to a group of about 20
students in the Soto House lounge,
Keathley lashed out against
government's intrusion into citizens'
daily lives.
A self-described "anarchist" and
"libertarian," the Candidate traced her
political philosophy to her early work
with the United Farm Workers and
Amnesty International.
"I became involved with a great
many socialists in those days. Even
though these people were anti-war and
pro-civil-liberties or so they
said—they kept trying to run my life
for me. So I became an anarchist," she
explained.
Keathley, 21, who calls herself "a
feminist writer," supports individual
civil rights, a non-interventionist
foreign policy and pure capitalism
without governmental interference.
Laetrile Ban
As an example of federal
interference with the free market, she
cited the policy of the Food and Drug
Administratis! (FDA) banning the use
of Laetrile for treatment of cancer
victims.
"The FDA outlawed Laetrile. There
is some evidence that it does arrest
some cases of cancer; there is some
evidence that it does not arrest some
cases of cancer. But the FDA doesn't
give us that choice. We can buy
Vitamin B-17, however, which is the
same substance as Laetrile, but no one
can tell you how much to use to arrest
a case of cancer," she remarked.
She called for immediate repeal of
so-called "victimless crime" laws,

including those prohibiting
prostitution and drug abuse. She
argued that governmental control does
nothing to stem the use of dangerous
drugs or to reduce the frequency of
prostitution, and the prohibitions
force organized crime to satisfy desires
in these fields.
'Black Market Trade'
"Syndicated crime depends on
black market trade to keep operating,"
Keathley noted. She added that many
violent crimes are committed by
persons who must pay exhorbitant
prices on the black market to buy
drugs.
"The chief of police in Los Angeles
says that 80 to 90 percent of violent
crimes there are caused by junkies and
the like supporting their habits," she
said.
