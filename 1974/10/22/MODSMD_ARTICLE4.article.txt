# Pub Board Action On 'Chappie' Urged
## 
### 
Mike Dornheim, editor of the
"unofficial" Stanford Chaparral,
praised a statement by ASSU
Publications Board Chairman Rich
Jaroslovsky which urged the board to
take immediate action on the
controversy concerning the humor
magazine.
Jaroslovsky recommended in a
letter to the Daily that the board
either take action or "get the hell out
of the issue and let the ASSU, the
University and the competing groups
slug it out."
The Pub Board must decide which
publication has the right to the office
space in the Storke Student
Publications Building which was made
available when the Chaparral ceased to
publish this fall, Jaroslovsky said.

Jaroslovsky opposed the Pub Board
taking any more authority than it
already has, but pointed out that
valuable space in the Storke Building is
being wasted as long as the issue
remains unsettled. Until now,
Jaroslovsky had refused to comment
on the controversy.
Problems began this summer when
ASSU Financial Manager, Frank
Olivieri refused the Chaparral staff
access to their office because of debts
to Atherton Advertising and alleged
misuse of office space.
Unavailable Editor
At that time, Olivieri could not
reach Chaparral editor Mark Lee to
question him on the magazine's
financial status.
Due to Lee's unavailability this fall,

Mike Dornheim assumed the position
as Chaparral editor. He and his
financial manager, Jim Hu, printed a
news sheet last week, labeling it the
Chaparral although the Pub Board had
refused to seat the two students as
representatives of the magazine.
Graduate student Mason Blacher
has also submitted a proposal to the
Pub Board for reviving the Chaparral
but has refused to take further action
without Pub Board sanction.
Blacher Sympathetic
Blacher said he "sympathized" with
Jaroslovsky's demand for the Board's
immediate action. "I would hope that
a decision could be made within the
Pub Board," Blacher remarked.
Blacher sees little use in having the
decision left up to the ASSU or any
other authority. "Involving more
people in the decision," said Blacher,
will simply cause "more delay and
confusion,"
Dornheim reported that he had
been told Jaroslovsky would resign as
board chairman if the board decided
to take control of the editorship.
Jaroslovsky claims he has made "no
statements to that effect," and that it
is "not a realistic possibility" that the
board will take such authority.
'Ceased To Publish'
Meanwhile several board members
have been trying to rewrite and clarify
the board's standing rules. They are
concentrating on the clause concerning
a publication's having "ceased to
publish," which the board applied to
the Chaparral.
"My feeling is that the business
about 'ceasing to publish' will be ruled
out of order," said Jon Braun, editor
of the Stanford Aliyah.
Members of the Pub Board have
stated they would still like to see
Dornheim and Blacher reach an
agreement over the editorship of the
Chaparral without the ruling of a
University organization.
"I'm convinced that Dornheim
wants a humor magazine," said
Blacher, but "I'm not sure he knows
how to go about putting one
together."
