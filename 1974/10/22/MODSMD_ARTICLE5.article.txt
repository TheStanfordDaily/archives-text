# Liberal Mavericks Vie In New York Senate Race
## 
### GLENN KRAMON News Analysis 
Ramsey Clark's opponents were not surprised
when the candidate they labeled a radical maverick
received less than one percent of the New York
Democratic Convention's vote for the senatorial
nomination last June.
But the former U.S. Attorney General's
supporters collected enough petition signatures to
put him on the Democratic ballot anyway. After an
overwhelming primary victory last month, he is now
challenging incumbent Republican Jacob K. Javits,
often called a liberal maverick in his own right.
Javits, who has held his Senate seat for 18 years,
openly criticized the Nixon Administration's
policies in Southeast Asia and on the domestic
front. But he has always remained faithful to Nixon
and other Republican candidates.
In a low-key Texas drawl which often disguises a
passionate, highly patriotic rhetoric, Clark has
criticized Javits as a "consummate practitioner of
the old politics" who has "compromised with his
party leadership and failed to take a forthright
position on Watergate."
Without mentioning the disparity in their ages
Javits is 70, Clark only 46 Clark repeatedly has
stressed Javits' old-line ties, harping in recent weeks
on a $15,000 campaign contribution the senator
received from Vice President designate and former
New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller.
'Conflict Of Interest'
Charging Javits with a gross conflict of interest
for accepting the contribution even though the
senator may vote on Rockefeller's nomination,
Clark has emphasized his own campaign promise to
refuse any gift over $lOO.
Javits has denied the conflict of interest and
asserts that his heavier campaign spending he
hopes to raise $1.2 million compared to Clark's
$700,000 is necessary because his Washington

responsibilities limit his campaign appearances.
Defense spending has become another key issue
in a state in which politicians have long demanded
more domestic funds to fight poverty in New York
City, where almost half of the state's 18.5 million
citizens live.
Javits has charged that a $25 billion reduction in
the defense budget urged by Clark would force the
U.S. to become "a politically undermanned Fortress
America." The senator, who has previously voted
for cuts in the Pentagon budget, says he would work
for cuts of about $lO billion.
Tax Reduction
Clark insists that the large defense cuts would
allow a reduction in taxes as well as funding for
domestic and foreign aid programs. For example, he
suggests a U.S. commitment of $2 billion annually
for 10 years to a Mideast Development Agency "a
kind of T.V.A." to fight health and economic
problems of warring Middle Eastern nations. He has
also urged strict wage and price controls.

With an eye on the heavy Jewish vote in New York,
expected to be about 15 percent of the total in the
state, both candidates have made an issue out of the
Mideast situation.
Ironically, both have vehemently supported
increased moral, financial and military aid for Israel.
But Javits claims that Clark has also advocated
creation of an independent Palestinian state on the
west bank of the Jordan River, a charge Clark has
called an oversimplification of a complex position.
Javits has accused Clark of suddenly supporting
Israel when he needs Jewish votes; Clark has
retorted, "I don't think you have to be Jewish to
love Israel."

Clark has also called for broad changes in
congressional procedures now dominated by"a
politics of caution and self-interest." He says that
committee members or party caucuses should elect
chairmen or leaders on the basis of qualifications,
not seniority.
He calls for "open" proceedings and an increase
in congressional staffs to provide members with
adequate information.
According to the latest Newsday-Gannett poll,
Clark is gaining, trailing Javits' 39 percent tally by
only seven percent.
Conservative Party candidate Barbara Keating,
the wife of a Marine Corps major killed in Vietnam,
has campaigned mostly in more conservative areas
upstate, and was favored by nine percent of those
polled. Clark's aides say she could be a big factor in
the race by taking a big chunk out of Javits'
support.
Good Vote-Getter
But Javits has always proved to be a good
vote-getter in New York because he holds the
Republican vote and grabs a good number of
normally Democratic Jewish voters. His margins of
victory have increased with every Senate election he
has won he took a plurality of more than one
million last time around.
And it is likely that Javits will win again. Some
critics claim his productivity has been limited by his
alienation from the White House and from
Republican leaders in the state capital as well as by
his lack of membership on powerful domestic Senate
committees. However, many voters may fear Clark
is untested and too extreme in his views.
But there's always the chance that a combination
of Watergate, Javits' age, and Clark's image of
integrity could produce one of the biggest upsets in
recent years.

on a $15,000 campaign contribution the senator
received from Vice President designate and former
New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller.
'Conflict Of Interest'
Charging Javits with a gross conflict of interest
for accepting the contribution even though the
senator may vote on Rockefeller's nomination,
Clark has emphasized his own campaign promise to
refuse any gift over $lOO.
Javits has denied the conflict of interest and
asserts that his heavier campaign spending he
hopes to raise $1.2 million compared to Clark's
$700,000 is necessary because his Washington

responsibilities limit his campaign appearances.
Defense spending has become another key issue
in a state in which politicians have long demanded
more domestic funds to fight poverty in New York
City, where almost half of the state's 18.5 million
citizens live.
Javits has charged that a $25 billion reduction in
the defense budget urged by Clark would force the
U.S. to become "a politically undermanned Fortress
America." The senator, who has previously voted
for cuts in the Pentagon budget, says he would work
for cuts of about $lO billion.
Tax Reduction
Clark insists that the large defense cuts would
allow a reduction in taxes as well as funding for
domestic and foreign aid programs. For example, he
suggests a U.S. commitment of $2 billion annually
for 10 years to a Mideast Development Agency "a
kind of T.V.A." to fight health and economic
problems of warring Middle Eastern nations. He has
also urged strict wage and price controls.

With an eye on the heavy Jewish vote in New York,
expected to be about 15 percent of the total in the
state, both candidates have made an issue out of the
Mideast situation.
Ironically, both have vehemently supported
increased moral, financial and military aid for Israel.
But Javits claims that Clark has also advocated
creation of an independent Palestinian state on the
west bank of the Jordan River, a charge Clark has
called an oversimplification of a complex position.
Javits has accused Clark of suddenly supporting
Israel when he needs Jewish votes; Clark has
retorted, "I don't think you have to be Jewish to
love Israel."

Clark has also called for broad changes in
congressional procedures now dominated by"a
politics of caution and self-interest." He says that
committee members or party caucuses should elect
chairmen or leaders on the basis of qualifications,
not seniority.
He calls for "open" proceedings and an increase
in congressional staffs to provide members with
adequate information.
According to the latest Newsday-Gannett poll,
Clark is gaining, trailing Javits' 39 percent tally by
only seven percent.
Conservative Party candidate Barbara Keating,
the wife of a Marine Corps major killed in Vietnam,
has campaigned mostly in more conservative areas
upstate, and was favored by nine percent of those
polled. Clark's aides say she could be a big factor in
the race by taking a big chunk out of Javits'
support.
Good Vote-Getter
But Javits has always proved to be a good
vote-getter in New York because he holds the
Republican vote and grabs a good number of
normally Democratic Jewish voters. His margins of
victory have increased with every Senate election he
has won he took a plurality of more than one
million last time around.
And it is likely that Javits will win again. Some
critics claim his productivity has been limited by his
alienation from the White House and from
Republican leaders in the state capital as well as by
his lack of membership on powerful domestic Senate
committees. However, many voters may fear Clark
is untested and too extreme in his views.
But there's always the chance that a combination
of Watergate, Javits' age, and Clark's image of
integrity could produce one of the biggest upsets in
recent years.

MAVERICK—Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark, a transplanted Texan, is
opposing Sen. Jacob K. Javits in his bid for a third term in the U.S. Senate
representing New York.
Ramsey Clark's opponents were not surprised
when the candidate they labeled a radical maverick
received less than one percent of the New York
Democratic Convention's vote for the senatorial
nomination last June.
But the former U.S. Attorney General's
supporters collected enough petition signatures to
put him on the Democratic ballot anyway. After an
overwhelming primary victory last month, he is now
challenging incumbent Republican Jacob K. Javits,
often called a liberal maverick in his own right.
Javits, who has held his Senate seat for 18 years,
openly criticized the Nixon Administration's
policies in Southeast Asia and on the domestic
front. But he has always remained faithful to Nixon
and other Republican candidates.
In a low-key Texas drawl which often disguises a
passionate, highly patriotic rhetoric, Clark has
criticized Javits as a "consummate practitioner of
the old politics" who has "compromised with his
party leadership and failed to take a forthright
position on Watergate."

for cuts of about $lO billion.
Tax Reduction
Clark insists that the large defense cuts would
allow a reduction in taxes as well as funding for
domestic and foreign aid programs. For example, he
suggests a U.S. commitment of $2 billion annually
for 10 years to a Mideast Development Agency "a
kind of T.V.A." to fight health and economic
problems of warring Middle Eastern nations. He has
also urged strict wage and price controls.

With an eye on the heavy Jewish vote in New York,
expected to be about 15 percent of the total in the
state, both candidates have made an issue out of the
Mideast situation.
Ironically, both have vehemently supported
increased moral, financial and military aid for Israel.
But Javits claims that Clark has also advocated
creation of an independent Palestinian state on the
west bank of the Jordan River, a charge Clark has
called an oversimplification of a complex position.
Javits has accused Clark of suddenly supporting
Israel when he needs Jewish votes; Clark has
retorted, "I don't think you have to be Jewish to
love Israel."

Clark has also called for broad changes in
congressional procedures now dominated by"a
politics of caution and self-interest." He says that
committee members or party caucuses should elect
chairmen or leaders on the basis of qualifications,
not seniority.
He calls for "open" proceedings and an increase
in congressional staffs to provide members with
adequate information.
According to the latest Newsday-Gannett poll,
Clark is gaining, trailing Javits' 39 percent tally by
only seven percent.
Conservative Party candidate Barbara Keating,
the wife of a Marine Corps major killed in Vietnam,
has campaigned mostly in more conservative areas
upstate, and was favored by nine percent of those
polled. Clark's aides say she could be a big factor in
the race by taking a big chunk out of Javits'
support.
Good Vote-Getter
But Javits has always proved to be a good
vote-getter in New York because he holds the
Republican vote and grabs a good number of
normally Democratic Jewish voters. His margins of
victory have increased with every Senate election he
has won he took a plurality of more than one
million last time around.
And it is likely that Javits will win again. Some
critics claim his productivity has been limited by his
alienation from the White House and from
Republican leaders in the state capital as well as by
his lack of membership on powerful domestic Senate
committees. However, many voters may fear Clark
is untested and too extreme in his views.
But there's always the chance that a combination
of Watergate, Javits' age, and Clark's image of
integrity could produce one of the biggest upsets in
recent years.

MAVERICK—Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark, a transplanted Texan, is
opposing Sen. Jacob K. Javits in his bid for a third term in the U.S. Senate
representing New York.
Ramsey Clark's opponents were not surprised
when the candidate they labeled a radical maverick
received less than one percent of the New York
Democratic Convention's vote for the senatorial
nomination last June.
But the former U.S. Attorney General's
supporters collected enough petition signatures to
put him on the Democratic ballot anyway. After an
overwhelming primary victory last month, he is now
challenging incumbent Republican Jacob K. Javits,
often called a liberal maverick in his own right.
Javits, who has held his Senate seat for 18 years,
openly criticized the Nixon Administration's
policies in Southeast Asia and on the domestic
front. But he has always remained faithful to Nixon
and other Republican candidates.
In a low-key Texas drawl which often disguises a
passionate, highly patriotic rhetoric, Clark has
criticized Javits as a "consummate practitioner of
the old politics" who has "compromised with his
party leadership and failed to take a forthright
position on Watergate."
Without mentioning the disparity in their ages
Javits is 70, Clark only 46 Clark repeatedly has
stressed Javits' old-line ties, harping in recent weeks
on a $15,000 campaign contribution the senator
received from Vice President designate and former
New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller.
'Conflict Of Interest'
Charging Javits with a gross conflict of interest
for accepting the contribution even though the
senator may vote on Rockefeller's nomination,
Clark has emphasized his own campaign promise to
refuse any gift over $lOO.
Javits has denied the conflict of interest and
asserts that his heavier campaign spending he
hopes to raise $1.2 million compared to Clark's
$700,000 is necessary because his Washington

responsibilities limit his campaign appearances.
Defense spending has become another key issue
in a state in which politicians have long demanded
more domestic funds to fight poverty in New York
City, where almost half of the state's 18.5 million
citizens live.
Javits has charged that a $25 billion reduction in
the defense budget urged by Clark would force the
U.S. to become "a politically undermanned Fortress
America." The senator, who has previously voted
for cuts in the Pentagon budget, says he would work
for cuts of about $lO billion.
