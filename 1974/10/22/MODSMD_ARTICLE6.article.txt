There are numerous womens'
groups and lectures on campus.
Their unifying theme usually is to
end sexual inequality. Yet these
are among the most
discriminatory groups on campus.
While other special interest
„ groups invite all interested people
' to their meetings and activities,
women's groups often invite only
women. Although women would
still form a majority at these
meetings if an invitation was
extended to the entire Stanford
community , this is no reason to
' exclude males.
On Oct. 16, several special
interest groups announced
meetings in the Daily. The Asian
Students Coordinating Committee
wrote, "All old members and
interested people invited to
attend." The Premedical Society
wrote, "All are welcome, to hear
presentation about the medical
profession." The Gay People's
Union wrote, "A special invitation
is extended to interested people
currently not attending GPU
functions." And for their lecture,
the Women's groups wrote, "All
women welcome and encouraged
to attend."
Sandra and Daryl Bern were the
main speakers at the womens'
meeting and they spoke on
egalitarian marriages. Since
marriages involve both
'sexes, not just females, there was
•no reason to exclude males,
"instead it would clearly have been
•to everyone's advantage to have
all interested people invited.
Iln the future I hope womens'
groups will change their invitation

Mark Paul ... Who? Maybe I
have tentatively established a
better win-loss record.
Someday, maybe I will exert as
positive an influence on my
players and will receive as much
of their respect ... maybe I will
learn to take as genuine an
interest in their welfare and
individual growth ... maybe I will
learn to prepare as thoroughly for
each event ... maybe I will learn
to be as good a competitor, and
yet be able to keep all
competition in its proper
perspective ... maybe I will learn
to become as good a person,
teacher and a representative of
athleteics and of Stanford ... as
"Coach Chris" and his excellent

I would like to reply to the
disparaging remarks made by
Vance Thorn concerning the
Student Police and their functions
at our home football game
(Daily, Oct. 16.)
I am confined to a wheelchair
and have been for the past two
years. When I arrive at the
stadium to attend a game there
are always student police waiting
to wheel me to my seat. After the
game is over they always return to
help me leave.
These fine young men perform
a valuable function. Certainly
they deserve to be applauded
rather than degraded for their
efforts.

Mark Paul ... Who? Maybe I
have tentatively established a
better win-loss record.
Someday, maybe I will exert as
positive an influence on my
players and will receive as much
of their respect ... maybe I will
learn to take as genuine an
interest in their welfare and
individual growth ... maybe I will
learn to prepare as thoroughly for
each event ... maybe I will learn
to be as good a competitor, and
yet be able to keep all
competition in its proper
perspective ... maybe I will learn
to become as good a person,
teacher and a representative of
athleteics and of Stanford ... as
"Coach Chris" and his excellent
staff!

I would like to reply to the
disparaging remarks made by
Vance Thorn concerning the
Student Police and their functions
at our home football game
(Daily, Oct. 16.)
I am confined to a wheelchair
and have been for the past two
years. When I arrive at the
stadium to attend a game there
are always student police waiting
to wheel me to my seat. After the
game is over they always return to
help me leave.
These fine young men perform
a valuable function. Certainly
they deserve to be applauded
rather than degraded for their
efforts.

There are numerous womens'
groups and lectures on campus.
Their unifying theme usually is to
end sexual inequality. Yet these
are among the most
discriminatory groups on campus.
While other special interest
„ groups invite all interested people
' to their meetings and activities,
women's groups often invite only
women. Although women would
still form a majority at these
meetings if an invitation was
extended to the entire Stanford
community , this is no reason to
' exclude males.
On Oct. 16, several special
interest groups announced
meetings in the Daily. The Asian
Students Coordinating Committee
wrote, "All old members and
interested people invited to
attend." The Premedical Society
wrote, "All are welcome, to hear
presentation about the medical
profession." The Gay People's
Union wrote, "A special invitation
is extended to interested people
currently not attending GPU
functions." And for their lecture,
