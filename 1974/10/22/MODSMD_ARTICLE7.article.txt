# On Tuition At UC
## 
### Robert Bacon 
SACRAMENTO - Tuition!
•Like the weather, everyone talks
;about it, but nobody ever seems
;to do anything about it.
• Somebody's trying to do
•something about the tuition at the
University of California, but what
'they want to do isn't wise, and it's
'up to all the people of California
!to stop them.
I Proposition 16 on the
general election ballot
!would give the State Legislature
;the power to set UC's tuition, a
•power which currently rests with
;the UC Regents.
' It is generally assumed that if
46 passes, the Legislature will
Isoon lower tuition, which
stands at $2OO per
Iquarter for resident
and $220 per
Quarter for resident graduate
(Read those figures and
pveep!)
But the merits of such a
reduction are not the question at
"issue. Proposition 16 would give
!the Legislature the power to raise
!as well as to lower tuition, not
Ijust in 1975 but for an indefinite
"time, until the voters again amend
;the State Constitution.
Possibilities

■ Consider the possibiliites. In
4964, the Mario Savio "free
'speech" movement arose at
'.UC-Berkeley about a month
before the November election. In
4970, campuses were convulsed
by opposition to the invasion of
Cambodia, about a month before
the primary election. Two years
'ago, the campuses reacted to the,
'mining of Haiphong harbor less
[Than a month before the primary
flection.
At each of those times, public

sentiment against higher
education in general and against
the University of California in
particular was windespread and
virulent. If the Legislature had
had the power to increase UC
tuition, the temptation to win
votes by "punishing" the students
with a tuition increase just before
the election would have been
great indeed.
As it was, tution-setting power
was vested in the UC Regents,
who, whatever else may be said of
them, did not have to face the
voters at the impending election
and so had no such incentive to
make political hay at the expense
literally of the students.
Damage
The amount of damage which
has been done to higher education
in recent years by politicians
playing politics with the campuses
is very great. History could repeat
itself.
Every tution increase would
put the benefits of education at a
major university beyond the reach
of thousands of qualified young
men and women. With
Proposition 16 in the
Constitution, every rise in public
feeling against UC could easily be
reflected by such a rise in tuition.
A vote of NO on Proposition
16 to keep the power to set UC
tution in the hands of the Regents
and a YES vote on Proposition
4 to increase the diversity of
the Regents will best protect a
strong University of California not
subject to the shifting winds of
partisan politics.

■ Consider the possibiliites. In
4964, the Mario Savio "free
'speech" movement arose at
'.UC-Berkeley about a month
before the November election. In
4970, campuses were convulsed
by opposition to the invasion of
Cambodia, about a month before
the primary election. Two years
'ago, the campuses reacted to the,
'mining of Haiphong harbor less
[Than a month before the primary
flection.
At each of those times, public

sentiment against higher
education in general and against
the University of California in
particular was windespread and
virulent. If the Legislature had
had the power to increase UC
tuition, the temptation to win
votes by "punishing" the students
with a tuition increase just before
the election would have been
great indeed.
As it was, tution-setting power
was vested in the UC Regents,
who, whatever else may be said of
them, did not have to face the
voters at the impending election
and so had no such incentive to
make political hay at the expense
literally of the students.
Damage
The amount of damage which
has been done to higher education
in recent years by politicians
playing politics with the campuses
is very great. History could repeat
itself.
Every tution increase would
put the benefits of education at a
major university beyond the reach
of thousands of qualified young
men and women. With
Proposition 16 in the
Constitution, every rise in public
feeling against UC could easily be
reflected by such a rise in tuition.
A vote of NO on Proposition
16 to keep the power to set UC
tution in the hands of the Regents
and a YES vote on Proposition
4 to increase the diversity of
the Regents will best protect a
strong University of California not
subject to the shifting winds of
partisan politics.
