What is a BIRKENSTOCK?
The distinguishing feature
of the Birkenstock sandal
is the molded footprint
contour. It was inspired by
observing the natural
function of the foot on
soft earth. A yielding
surface supports the arch
of the foot and invites the
gripping action of the toes.
The ' patented footprint
contour is composed of
highly elastic cork. It
becomes flexible with
body warmth and molds
itself to yo.ur feet
becoming more "your
own" with every step you
take.
