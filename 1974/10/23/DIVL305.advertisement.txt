A Man For
Othersâ€”
A Foreign
Missionary
Priest
That's what a Columban Father
is. He's a man who cares...and
a man who shares...a man who
reaches out to missions in Asia
and Latin America...to share the
Good News that Jesus truly
cares for them. He's a man who
commits his life totally to others
so they can live their lives as
God intended. Being a
COLUMBAN FATHER
is a tough challenge...but if you
think you have what it takes and
are a Catholic young man, 17 to
26, write today for our
