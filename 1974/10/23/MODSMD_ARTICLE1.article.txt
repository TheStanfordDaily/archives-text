# ASSU Council Of Presidents Presses Ahead On Promises
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The ASSU Council of Presidents
passed the midpoint of its
administration last Friday, and "has
yet to throw anything out" of its
booklet of campaign promises, said
President Mike Herman.
Herman attributed this success in
keeping campaign promises to the
forethought that went into writing the
platform. ,
"We gave considerable thought and
planning ... to the feasibility and
possibility for . success" of the
programs proposed, given the "relative
lack of strength" of the ASSU and the
limits one-year term, he said.
Herman noted that the Council of
Presidents has been "looked down on"
in the past for not fulfilling its
campaign promises. "I feel very
definitely that the proposals we ran on
are of top priority," Herman stated.
"I feel a very strong obligation" to
fulfill the promises, he added.
Promises, Projects
The Council of Presidents is
spending most of its time trying to
implement its campaign program,
Herman said. However, it is
working on other projects.
Vice Presidents Len Mackey and
Ann Carter have been trying to secure
space for the ASSU record sales co-op
in the bookstore. Mackey said
negotiations are still in progress, and
that no agreements have been reached
so far.
Mackey also heads the Policy Board
of the Legal Counseling Office located
in the Firehouse. Herman said Mackey
might serve as the council's
representative in future housing policy

discussions with Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton.
However, Mackey said he hasn't talked
to Horton since last summer.
Events Listing
Carter has been working with Mary
Franich, editor of The Bulletin, a
listing of weekly campus events, which
appeared for the first time this week.
The Bulletin's biggest problem is that
it "has no track record," said Carter.
"We want people to realize that
students are reading it... We want

people who haven't put things in to
put them in," said Carter.
Carter is also in charge of the
Course Review, which has tentatively
been offered an office adjoining the
Quad offices in the Storke
Publications building, she revealed.

members every week.
The committee has met with the
architects once, and is conducting a
survey of student preferences on
matters such as parking space, room
sizes and recreational areas. The
committee will present its proposals to
the Board of Trustees next month.
The administrators have been "very
receptive" to the committee's
recommendations, while the
committee has been "very realistic" in
its proposals, Carter reported.
Vice president Quinn Mayer will
send out a survey next week to sample
"on-campus student interest in
creating a new bus line that would
come right to the dorm residences."
It would be a "convenient, cheap
way to get off campus regardless of
the weather," said Mayer. He said he
expected "particular interest" from

students who either bike or walk to
most places. He predicted even
students with cars would travel by bus
to save gas.
Mayer is also working with the
policy board of the Action Research
Liason Office. A computer
information retrieval system providing
"instant access" to faculty members,
students and committees needing
research information has been installed
for ARLO by a grad student, Mayer
said.

administration last Friday, and "has
yet to throw anything out" of its
booklet of campaign promises, said
President Mike Herman.
Herman attributed this success in
keeping campaign promises to the
forethought that went into writing the
platform. ,
"We gave considerable thought and
planning ... to the feasibility and
possibility for . success" of the
programs proposed, given the "relative
lack of strength" of the ASSU and the
limits one-year term, he said.
Herman noted that the Council of
Presidents has been "looked down on"
in the past for not fulfilling its
campaign promises. "I feel very
definitely that the proposals we ran on
are of top priority," Herman stated.
"I feel a very strong obligation" to
fulfill the promises, he added.
Promises, Projects
The Council of Presidents is
spending most of its time trying to
implement its campaign program,
Herman said. However, it is
working on other projects.
Vice Presidents Len Mackey and
Ann Carter have been trying to secure
space for the ASSU record sales co-op
in the bookstore. Mackey said
negotiations are still in progress, and
that no agreements have been reached
so far.
Mackey also heads the Policy Board
of the Legal Counseling Office located
in the Firehouse. Herman said Mackey
might serve as the council's
representative in future housing policy

discussions with Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton.
However, Mackey said he hasn't talked
to Horton since last summer.
Events Listing
Carter has been working with Mary
Franich, editor of The Bulletin, a
listing of weekly campus events, which
appeared for the first time this week.
The Bulletin's biggest problem is that
it "has no track record," said Carter.
"We want people to realize that
students are reading it... We want

people who haven't put things in to
put them in," said Carter.
Carter is also in charge of the
Course Review, which has tentatively
been offered an office adjoining the
Quad offices in the Storke
Publications building, she revealed.

members every week.
The committee has met with the
architects once, and is conducting a
survey of student preferences on
matters such as parking space, room
sizes and recreational areas. The
committee will present its proposals to
the Board of Trustees next month.
The administrators have been "very
receptive" to the committee's
recommendations, while the
committee has been "very realistic" in
its proposals, Carter reported.
Vice president Quinn Mayer will
send out a survey next week to sample
"on-campus student interest in
creating a new bus line that would
come right to the dorm residences."
It would be a "convenient, cheap
way to get off campus regardless of
the weather," said Mayer. He said he
expected "particular interest" from

students who either bike or walk to
most places. He predicted even
students with cars would travel by bus
to save gas.
Mayer is also working with the
policy board of the Action Research
Liason Office. A computer
information retrieval system providing
"instant access" to faculty members,
students and committees needing
research information has been installed
for ARLO by a grad student, Mayer
said.
The ASSU Council of Presidents
passed the midpoint of its
administration last Friday, and "has
