# ASSU Council Of Presidents Presses Ahead On Promises
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The ASSU Council of Presidents
passed the midpoint of its
administration last Friday, and "has
yet to throw anything out" of its
booklet of campaign promises, said
President Mike Herman.
Herman attributed this success in
keeping campaign promises to the
forethought that went into writing the
platform. ,
"We gave considerable thought and
planning ... to the feasibility and
possibility for . success" of the
programs proposed, given the "relative
lack of strength" of the ASSU and the
limits one-year term, he said.
Herman noted that the Council of
Presidents has been "looked down on"
in the past for not fulfilling its
campaign promises. "I feel very
definitely that the proposals we ran on
are of top priority," Herman stated.
"I feel a very strong obligation" to
fulfill the promises, he added.
Promises, Projects
The Council of Presidents is
spending most of its time trying to
implement its campaign program,
Herman said. However, it is
working on other projects.
Vice Presidents Len Mackey and
Ann Carter have been trying to secure
space for the ASSU record sales co-op
in the bookstore. Mackey said
negotiations are still in progress, and
that no agreements have been reached
so far.
Mackey also heads the Policy Board
of the Legal Counseling Office located
in the Firehouse. Herman said Mackey
might serve as the council's
representative in future housing policy

discussions with Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton.
However, Mackey said he hasn't talked
to Horton since last summer.
Events Listing
Carter has been working with Mary
Franich, editor of The Bulletin, a
listing of weekly campus events, which
appeared for the first time this week.
The Bulletin's biggest problem is that
it "has no track record," said Carter.
"We want people to realize that
students are reading it... We want

people who haven't put things in to
put them in," said Carter.
Carter is also in charge of the
Course Review, which has tentatively
been offered an office adjoining the
Quad offices in the Storke
Publications building, she revealed.

Advisory Committee to the Dean of
