# A 						GOP Minority? It's A Tradition!
## 
### William Ross 
Opinion surveys generally indicate that a
majority of Americans don't know which
political party controls Congress. Perhaps this
explains in part why the Democrats appear
likely to win a landslide in upcoming
Congressional elections.
If the nation's government seems
unresponsive to problems such as inflation, it
is logical to blame the Republican
Administration unless one first examines the
record of the Democratic Congress. But
millions of voters apparently assume that
GOP incumbency in the presidency means
that the GOP also controls Capitol Hill. This
is an unfortunate illusion.
While the performance of the Republican
Administration during the past five years has
been dismal, the record of the Democratic
Congress is little better. Yet, barring a drastic
realignment, Democrats will indefinitely
maintain their congressional majority.
For 36 of the past 40 years and for all of
-the past 20 years, Democrats have controlled
Congress, bemocrats have enjoyed a Senate
majority since 1933 except for an interlude
in 1953-55; they have controlled the House
since 1931 except for the periods of 1947-49
and 1953-55.
U.S. Almost Unique
Single party control of a national
legislative body for virtually 40 years is a
situation unknown to all major western
democracies except Sweden and the United
States.

France, Germany, Canada, Australia and
Italy, for example, have all experienced
changes in the legislative control of the
government during the past 20 years. In Great
Britain, the continuance in office of the
Conservatives for the almost unprecedented
period of 13 years convinced many voters in
1964 to support Labour. But almost no one
in this country seems to notice or care that
one party has monopolized Congress for
decades.
The division of executive and legislative
duties in this country and the frequent GOP
presidential victories have considerably
ameliorated the effect of persistant
Democratic / congressional majorities.
Furthermore, as the late Prof. David M. Potter
noted in his book, The South and the
Concurrent Majority, an informal coalition of
southern Democrats and national
Republicans have exerted their will on the
nation since the New Deal.
Government Weakened?
But the very fact that one party has
continually maintained a majority in
Congress has weakened the effectiveness of
representative government.
After 40 years in power, the Democrats,
entrenched in their positions, are hostile to
any attempt to reorganize congress to enable
it to deal efficiently with national problems.
For example:
—The existing committee system, adopted
in 1946, is so antiquated that work is often
duplicated and badly coordinated. At the

height of the energy crisis, 24 committees
were investigating the problem. But the most
recent session of Congress failed to accept
the recommendations of the committee on
congressional reform led by Rep. Richard
Boiling (D-Mo.) and Rep. David Martin
(R-Neb.). The reform was thwarted by
Democratic committee chairmen who sought
to protect their fiefdoms.
Reactionary Caucus
—The Democratic Caucus, which often
forces members to vote the party line, is also
clearly reactionary; Republicans allow free
votes. But the Caucus system remains largely
unchallenged. Democrats also are probably
more amenable to the seniority system than
are the Republicans.
—Surrender of power to the executive
during the last few decades so harshly
criticized by liberal Democrats was
accomplished by Democratic Congresses.
With the unpleasant record of recent
Republican presidential administrations,
there is no reason to assume that a GOP
Congress would benefit the nation overall.
But a Republican majority would almost
certainly reorganize Congress, making it more
responsive to the present-day legislative
needs. National problems could be dealt with
more efficiently and effectively. After 20
years in opposition, the Republicans at least
deserve a chance to try.

situation unknown to all major western
democracies except Sweden and the United
States.

France, Germany, Canada, Australia and
Italy, for example, have all experienced
changes in the legislative control of the
government during the past 20 years. In Great
Britain, the continuance in office of the
Conservatives for the almost unprecedented
period of 13 years convinced many voters in
1964 to support Labour. But almost no one
in this country seems to notice or care that
one party has monopolized Congress for
decades.
The division of executive and legislative
duties in this country and the frequent GOP
presidential victories have considerably
ameliorated the effect of persistant
Democratic / congressional majorities.
Furthermore, as the late Prof. David M. Potter
noted in his book, The South and the
Concurrent Majority, an informal coalition of
southern Democrats and national
Republicans have exerted their will on the
nation since the New Deal.
Government Weakened?
But the very fact that one party has
continually maintained a majority in
Congress has weakened the effectiveness of
representative government.
After 40 years in power, the Democrats,
entrenched in their positions, are hostile to
any attempt to reorganize congress to enable
it to deal efficiently with national problems.
For example:
—The existing committee system, adopted
in 1946, is so antiquated that work is often
duplicated and badly coordinated. At the

height of the energy crisis, 24 committees
were investigating the problem. But the most
recent session of Congress failed to accept
the recommendations of the committee on
congressional reform led by Rep. Richard
Boiling (D-Mo.) and Rep. David Martin
(R-Neb.). The reform was thwarted by
Democratic committee chairmen who sought
to protect their fiefdoms.
Reactionary Caucus
—The Democratic Caucus, which often
forces members to vote the party line, is also
clearly reactionary; Republicans allow free
votes. But the Caucus system remains largely
unchallenged. Democrats also are probably
more amenable to the seniority system than
are the Republicans.
—Surrender of power to the executive
during the last few decades so harshly
criticized by liberal Democrats was
accomplished by Democratic Congresses.
With the unpleasant record of recent
Republican presidential administrations,
there is no reason to assume that a GOP
Congress would benefit the nation overall.
But a Republican majority would almost
certainly reorganize Congress, making it more
responsive to the present-day legislative
needs. National problems could be dealt with
more efficiently and effectively. After 20
years in opposition, the Republicans at least
deserve a chance to try.

Opinion surveys generally indicate that a
majority of Americans don't know which
political party controls Congress. Perhaps this
explains in part why the Democrats appear
likely to win a landslide in upcoming
Congressional elections.
If the nation's government seems
unresponsive to problems such as inflation, it
is logical to blame the Republican
Administration unless one first examines the
record of the Democratic Congress. But
millions of voters apparently assume that
GOP incumbency in the presidency means
that the GOP also controls Capitol Hill. This
is an unfortunate illusion.
While the performance of the Republican
Administration during the past five years has
been dismal, the record of the Democratic
Congress is little better. Yet, barring a drastic
realignment, Democrats will indefinitely
maintain their congressional majority.
For 36 of the past 40 years and for all of
-the past 20 years, Democrats have controlled
Congress, bemocrats have enjoyed a Senate
majority since 1933 except for an interlude
in 1953-55; they have controlled the House
since 1931 except for the periods of 1947-49
and 1953-55.
