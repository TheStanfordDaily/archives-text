# Murder, Safety And The Institution
## 
### Heck, Schement 
We all felt horror over the senseless loss of
life which occurred at Stanford just over a
week ago. We gri&ve for the loved ones of
Arlis Perry. And we reflect on the role of the
institution at the center of our community.
What might it do to preserve life and sustain
trust?
Stanford projects the image of an
intellectual community. But a community of
scholars is not immune from the problems
existing in the larger society. Stanford does
not project the image of a community faced
with these problems.
We believe the University must act to
dispel the belief that life and limb are safe
within the confines of this institution. And,
we believe the University must take the
initiative in creating an environment that
minimizes risk to life and limb.
First, we ask the University to publicize
the "facts of life" about safety, danger and
crime as they are. Stanford is not New York,

Chicago or Los Angeles. We do not expect to
walk with the same fears here as there. But
there are murders, rapes, assaults and other
crimes on campus. Staff, students, faculty
and families need to be reminded of this fact.
Not once, in the aftermath of a crime, but
continually.
The University can direct our attention to
the facts at the beginning of each year by
providing incoming students and their
families with accurate and complete
information about the potential dangers and
the necessary safety precautions. And, it can
remind community members throughout the
year of the need to exercise continual
caution.
Secondly, the University must explore
ways to reduce risk on campus. We offer
several suggestions. Hotline emergency
phones could be installed at strategic points
across campus. A volunteer walkie talkie

escort service could be established. A plain
clothes beat might be initiated. Bike and
cross-campus walk paths could be designated
for night use, and then illuminated. Individual
schools and dormitories can be asked to
develop safety measures. Undergraduates
should view Nobody's Victim. Ways of
reaching graduate students need to be
developed.
There are no guarantee? the University can
make on the side of safety and life.
Ultimately, each individual must assume
responsibility for his/her well being. But the
University can exercise leadership in
presenting the facts and in providing
actively, continually safeguards against the
risks of living and working at Stanford.

the "facts of life" about safety, danger and
crime as they are. Stanford is not New York,

Chicago or Los Angeles. We do not expect to
walk with the same fears here as there. But
there are murders, rapes, assaults and other
crimes on campus. Staff, students, faculty
and families need to be reminded of this fact.
Not once, in the aftermath of a crime, but
continually.
The University can direct our attention to
the facts at the beginning of each year by
providing incoming students and their
families with accurate and complete
information about the potential dangers and
the necessary safety precautions. And, it can
remind community members throughout the
year of the need to exercise continual
caution.
Secondly, the University must explore
ways to reduce risk on campus. We offer
several suggestions. Hotline emergency
phones could be installed at strategic points
across campus. A volunteer walkie talkie

escort service could be established. A plain
clothes beat might be initiated. Bike and
cross-campus walk paths could be designated
for night use, and then illuminated. Individual
schools and dormitories can be asked to
develop safety measures. Undergraduates
should view Nobody's Victim. Ways of
reaching graduate students need to be
developed.
There are no guarantee? the University can
make on the side of safety and life.
Ultimately, each individual must assume
responsibility for his/her well being. But the
University can exercise leadership in
presenting the facts and in providing
actively, continually safeguards against the
risks of living and working at Stanford.

We all felt horror over the senseless loss of
life which occurred at Stanford just over a
week ago. We gri&ve for the loved ones of
Arlis Perry. And we reflect on the role of the
institution at the center of our community.
What might it do to preserve life and sustain
trust?
Stanford projects the image of an
intellectual community. But a community of
scholars is not immune from the problems
existing in the larger society. Stanford does
not project the image of a community faced
with these problems.
We believe the University must act to
dispel the belief that life and limb are safe
within the confines of this institution. And,
we believe the University must take the
initiative in creating an environment that
minimizes risk to life and limb.
First, we ask the University to publicize
the "facts of life" about safety, danger and
crime as they are. Stanford is not New York,

Chicago or Los Angeles. We do not expect to
walk with the same fears here as there. But
there are murders, rapes, assaults and other
crimes on campus. Staff, students, faculty
