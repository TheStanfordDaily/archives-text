# Affirmative Action: Bad Numbers?
## 
### Matilda Butler-Paisley 
Arthur Bienenstock's defense
of the Stanford affirmative action
program (Daily, Oct. 18) is based
on bad numbers and worse logic.
Do women constitute 10.4
percent of all current recipients of
the doctorate that is, the
faculty recruiting pool? The
National Academy of Sciences
reports that women constituted
18 percent of all doctorate
recipients in the latest tabulated
year, fiscal 1973 (33,727 total,
6,082 women). Thus, by
Stanford's own criterion for
affirmative action, faculty
appointments in the past year
continued to discriminate against
women. (Only 12.2 percent of
professorial appointments last
year were women.)
What is the logic of Stanford's
criterion that faculty
appointments should only reflect
current proportions of women
and men in the recruiting pool?
By this criterion, an entire
generation of faculty turnover will
be needed to "balance" sex
proportions in the faculty as a
whole, and that "balance" will
always reflect obsolete averages of
women and men in each field.
Because of past discrimination,
there is in fact a large recruiting

pool of qualified women.
Stanford could easily adopt a
compensatory criterion. For
example, 50 percent of all new
professorial appointments could
be women, so that some balance
would be achieved in the faculty
as a whole within 20 years.
Should Demand Accounting
After observing the recruiting
process in one department, I can
understand why affirmative action
progressed so little in the past
year. Stanford women should
demand from each department an
accounting of affirmative action

contacts made for each new
appointment and promotion in
the past year.
Stanford women are beginning
to realize that a number of
"pressure points" exist for making
affirmative action honest. Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 is powerful because of
Stanford's dependence on federal
contracts. We have not yet
organized ourselves to place
pressure on senators,
congressmen, federal contract
administrators, and the Office of
Federal Contract Compliance.

A new "pressure point" for
some departments is Title IX of
the Education Amendment of
1972. Educational opportunity
for women is unequal if they have
few women faculty to work with
and to observe as career models.
In the Communication
, Department, for example, half of
all students are women, but no
woman has ever served on the
regular faculty.

progressed so little in the past
year. Stanford women should
demand from each department an
accounting of affirmative action

contacts made for each new
appointment and promotion in
the past year.
Stanford women are beginning
to realize that a number of
"pressure points" exist for making
affirmative action honest. Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 is powerful because of
Stanford's dependence on federal
contracts. We have not yet
organized ourselves to place
pressure on senators,
congressmen, federal contract
administrators, and the Office of
Federal Contract Compliance.

A new "pressure point" for
some departments is Title IX of
the Education Amendment of
1972. Educational opportunity
for women is unequal if they have
few women faculty to work with
and to observe as career models.
In the Communication
, Department, for example, half of
all students are women, but no
woman has ever served on the
regular faculty.

lecturer in the Communication
Department.)
Arthur Bienenstock's defense
of the Stanford affirmative action
program (Daily, Oct. 18) is based
on bad numbers and worse logic.
Do women constitute 10.4
percent of all current recipients of
the doctorate that is, the
faculty recruiting pool? The
National Academy of Sciences
reports that women constituted
18 percent of all doctorate
recipients in the latest tabulated
year, fiscal 1973 (33,727 total,
6,082 women). Thus, by
Stanford's own criterion for
affirmative action, faculty
appointments in the past year
continued to discriminate against
women. (Only 12.2 percent of
professorial appointments last
year were women.)
What is the logic of Stanford's
criterion that faculty
appointments should only reflect
current proportions of women
and men in the recruiting pool?
By this criterion, an entire
generation of faculty turnover will
be needed to "balance" sex
proportions in the faculty as a
whole, and that "balance" will
always reflect obsolete averages of
women and men in each field.
Because of past discrimination,
there is in fact a large recruiting

pool of qualified women.
Stanford could easily adopt a
compensatory criterion. For
example, 50 percent of all new
professorial appointments could
be women, so that some balance
would be achieved in the faculty
as a whole within 20 years.
Should Demand Accounting
After observing the recruiting
process in one department, I can
understand why affirmative action
progressed so little in the past
year. Stanford women should
demand from each department an
accounting of affirmative action

contacts made for each new
appointment and promotion in
the past year.
