Contrary to the statement in
the Oct. 18 Daily, the Committee
of 15 was formed in 1965 with
the approval of the Student
Legislature, the Academic Council
and the President, who then was
Wallace Sterling.
Another item which warrants
clarification is the Daily's
coverage of President Lyman's
comments on KZSU concerning
faculty affirmative action.
One paragraph in the Daily
read as follows: "Lyman
explained that many of the most
qualified women have already
been hired by Stanford, and there
is little remaining talent on which
to draw."
The KZSU tape records the
President as follows: "It's
recognized all over that the
financial difficulties of higher
education in general inevitably
will slow the process of
affirmative action in the sense
that the number of vacancies you
can fill with women or minority
candidates will be less if there are
fewer vacancies overall. .. .
"Certainly there seems an
overwhelming likelihood of slow
progress. I don't know what one
can do about that other than the
tackling of the financial
difficulties as strenuously as one
can... .
"I do think, however, the
progress there [i.e., at Stanford!
has been by no means
insignificant and I think we
warned certainly I've said it on
many occasions after the
successes in hiring and appointing
women in particular to the faculty
a year ago were announced that it
was extremely unlikely that that
pace could be maintained
indefinitely.
"Many colleges had the
experience, when they got down
to a serious effort on this
problem, of considerable. success
at first, because we were opening
up a problem area and taking
advantage of a talent which was
then available, which was since
appointed, and so on. .. .
"It's still the case we're doing
reasonably well with the limited
opportunities we have but they
certainly are limited by financial
difficulties."

Murder 'A Public Concern'
Editor:
A number of readers have
objected to your "overly explicit"
coverage of the recent murder at
Stanford. McPheeters and
Bagshaw (Daily, Oct. 17) state
that this crime, though a
"burden" for the friends of Arlis
Perry, is "simply not a public
concern."
I would like, therefore, to
commend the Daily for its
"explicit" coverage. It is only
through such reporting that the
American people can be made
.aware of the fundamental sickness
which now pervades our society.
Had the story been dealt with
simply as "another murder at
Stanford," it would have been
largely ignored by most people.
Murder has become such a
banality in our culture that it no
longer warrants our attention.
What is even more tragic is that
bizarre senseless murders have also
become commonplace. Perhaps
the shocking and grotesque details
of this latest crime will force
people to reconsider the state of
contemporary American society,
in which homocide is
omnipresent, crooks appoint
Presidents and the senseless
slaughter in Vietnam continues
with our support under a new
code-name, "Peace with/Honor."
Unless the Perry murder, or
that of any individual, becomes a
matter of "public conern," and
not simply a "burden" to her
friends, the quality of our society
is not likely to improve.

Murder 'A Public Concern'
Editor:
A number of readers have
objected to your "overly explicit"
coverage of the recent murder at
Stanford. McPheeters and
Bagshaw (Daily, Oct. 17) state
that this crime, though a
"burden" for the friends of Arlis
Perry, is "simply not a public
concern."
I would like, therefore, to
commend the Daily for its
"explicit" coverage. It is only
through such reporting that the
American people can be made
.aware of the fundamental sickness
which now pervades our society.
Had the story been dealt with
simply as "another murder at
Stanford," it would have been
largely ignored by most people.
Murder has become such a
banality in our culture that it no
longer warrants our attention.
What is even more tragic is that
bizarre senseless murders have also
become commonplace. Perhaps
the shocking and grotesque details
of this latest crime will force
people to reconsider the state of
contemporary American society,
in which homocide is
omnipresent, crooks appoint
Presidents and the senseless
slaughter in Vietnam continues
with our support under a new
code-name, "Peace with/Honor."
Unless the Perry murder, or
that of any individual, becomes a
matter of "public conern," and
not simply a "burden" to her
friends, the quality of our society
is not likely to improve.

Contrary to the statement in
the Oct. 18 Daily, the Committee
of 15 was formed in 1965 with
the approval of the Student
Legislature, the Academic Council
and the President, who then was
Wallace Sterling.
Another item which warrants
clarification is the Daily's
coverage of President Lyman's
comments on KZSU concerning
faculty affirmative action.
One paragraph in the Daily
read as follows: "Lyman
explained that many of the most
qualified women have already
been hired by Stanford, and there
is little remaining talent on which
to draw."
The KZSU tape records the
President as follows: "It's
recognized all over that the
financial difficulties of higher
education in general inevitably
will slow the process of
affirmative action in the sense
that the number of vacancies you
can fill with women or minority
candidates will be less if there are
fewer vacancies overall. .. .
"Certainly there seems an
overwhelming likelihood of slow
progress. I don't know what one
can do about that other than the
tackling of the financial
difficulties as strenuously as one
can... .
