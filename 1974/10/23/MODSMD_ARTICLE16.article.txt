## Carol Doda After 10 Years As Queen Of Broadway 
### STEVE HEFTER 
Three middle-aged men sit and ogle in the
front row. The room is dark.
Busty barmaids with halter tops and hot
pants shuttle drinks to the dozen or so
spectators and the three piece band grinds out
some barroom striptease.
On stage, Carol Doda is topless. Forty-four
inches of the most famous mammary glands
Mother Nature and men of science have ever
produced are on display.

The music swells.
Carol strokes the microphone and slowly
brings it to her glossy-red lips. "Sit back and
relax," she suggests with an impudent wiggle
in her voice, "and don't turn the knobs; cause
it hurts."
The First
For 10 years people, have been coming to
San Francisco's Condor Club to see Carol
Doda. She was America's first topless dancer
and a decade later her silicone-injected breasts

still perform tricks just like a well-trained dog.
For Five shows, six nights a week, the
famed twosome jerk and jiggle and bounce in
time to the music. They sway from side to
side along the piano top and coyly hide
behind a penoir.
After the show, enscounced in a plush
black leather chair in the basement office of
the Condor, Carol talks about what it was like
the first night. "I felt shy for a minute and I
thought 'Can I really go down there
without a top on?' But then I thought, 'I
really don't know any other way of breaking
into show business.'
'Very Naive'
"I was very naive. I was only 20 years old
at the time and I was very stupid," she laughs.
"But I just knew that I had the incentive to
do it and the feeling, you know. I wanted to
do something."
Six months after she started topless, Carol
had silicone injections which built her up
from 34 inches to 44 inches.
"It didn't change me as a performer,"
Carol notes, "It just enhanced the act so to
speak. I find lots of people like to look at
them."
Carol describes her act as entertainment.
"I'm an entertainer. I'm not a stripper. I strip
in my act, but I also sing and also dance and
also talk to the audience."
She adds with emphasis, "I like to make
people happy, and if I can make people happy
it gives me a thrill."
Sensual Vibratons
"I'm very aware of what I'm doing up
there. You have to be. A lot of it's sensual and
happy vibrations," she says smiling.
In recent years, Carol notes that the show's
"become a family show. More couples, more
families and a lot of long hairs have come
here."
"At one time," she shrugs, "I thought it
was just for businessmen."
Carol sinks low in her chair. Her amply
endowed frame is swathed in a temporary
restraining blouse and the cleavage is
well-defined. She shakes some
platinum-blonde hair from her face and thinks
back on how her career began.
Sinatra's Showgirls
"When I was 12 I thought I wanted to be a
showgirl," she giggles. "I read this funny book

about Frank Sinatra, and these showgirls were
in this magazine with him, and that impressed
me.
"I started here (the Condor) at 17 as a
cocktail waitress and began dancing when I
was 20. But people don't know that," she
confides, "because you're not supposed to
work in an alcoholic place under the age of
21."
Today, Carol Doda enjoys the laurels that
come with hard work. She marches in parades,
poses for nude magazines and does station
breaks and editorials for Channel 36 in San
Jose.
Not Always Nude
Television provides Carol with a change.
"I myself don't feel like being nude on
television," she says. "I like to be diversified. I
don't want to be nude everywhere I go and in
everything I do."
Carol smiles as she looks ahead to the
future. "I'm preparing for big night clubs in
Las Vegas. I want to sing, dance and tell jokes.
You know, I've taken voice lessons for eight
years," she concludes.
Though her act may offend some women's
liberationists, Carol reacts, "I've helped
women's liberation by taking off my clothes. I
mean, they don't wear bras any more, do
they?" She continues, "Being liberated is
being free in your own mind. They're free to
take their own clothes off.
"Everybody's an individual as far as I'm
concerned."
Rowdy Customer
Carol Doda gets up. She's got another show
in 10 minutes and has to get ready. As she
prepares to go on stage she talks of a problem
she had the night before with a rowdy
customer.
"This guy comes on stage," she explains,
"We have panties on you know, and I was in
my act and he came up and kissed me on my
panties. Instead of freaking out, I just looked
at him and said, 'l'm sorry I had my pants
on!' And then I he was really drunk and
then I said,' she rolls her voice, "That's what
you call a half-assed job."
The band strikes up and the stage lights go
out. Carol Doda bears her breasts for the
second time this night, the 30th time this
week and about the 15,000 th time in the last
10 years.

easy to see why it came out the way it did.

do it and the feeling, you know. I wanted to
do something."
Six months after she started topless, Carol
had silicone injections which built her up
from 34 inches to 44 inches.
"It didn't change me as a performer,"
Carol notes, "It just enhanced the act so to
speak. I find lots of people like to look at
them."
Carol describes her act as entertainment.
"I'm an entertainer. I'm not a stripper. I strip
in my act, but I also sing and also dance and
also talk to the audience."
She adds with emphasis, "I like to make
people happy, and if I can make people happy
it gives me a thrill."
Sensual Vibratons
"I'm very aware of what I'm doing up
there. You have to be. A lot of it's sensual and
happy vibrations," she says smiling.
In recent years, Carol notes that the show's
"become a family show. More couples, more
families and a lot of long hairs have come
here."
"At one time," she shrugs, "I thought it
was just for businessmen."
Carol sinks low in her chair. Her amply
endowed frame is swathed in a temporary
restraining blouse and the cleavage is
well-defined. She shakes some
platinum-blonde hair from her face and thinks
back on how her career began.
Sinatra's Showgirls
"When I was 12 I thought I wanted to be a
showgirl," she giggles. "I read this funny book

about Frank Sinatra, and these showgirls were
in this magazine with him, and that impressed
me.
"I started here (the Condor) at 17 as a
cocktail waitress and began dancing when I
was 20. But people don't know that," she
confides, "because you're not supposed to
work in an alcoholic place under the age of
21."
Today, Carol Doda enjoys the laurels that
come with hard work. She marches in parades,
poses for nude magazines and does station
breaks and editorials for Channel 36 in San
Jose.
Not Always Nude
Television provides Carol with a change.
"I myself don't feel like being nude on
television," she says. "I like to be diversified. I
don't want to be nude everywhere I go and in
everything I do."
Carol smiles as she looks ahead to the
future. "I'm preparing for big night clubs in
Las Vegas. I want to sing, dance and tell jokes.
You know, I've taken voice lessons for eight
years," she concludes.
Though her act may offend some women's
liberationists, Carol reacts, "I've helped
women's liberation by taking off my clothes. I
mean, they don't wear bras any more, do
they?" She continues, "Being liberated is
being free in your own mind. They're free to
take their own clothes off.
"Everybody's an individual as far as I'm
concerned."
Rowdy Customer
Carol Doda gets up. She's got another show
in 10 minutes and has to get ready. As she
prepares to go on stage she talks of a problem
she had the night before with a rowdy
customer.
"This guy comes on stage," she explains,
"We have panties on you know, and I was in
my act and he came up and kissed me on my
panties. Instead of freaking out, I just looked
at him and said, 'l'm sorry I had my pants
on!' And then I he was really drunk and
then I said,' she rolls her voice, "That's what
you call a half-assed job."
The band strikes up and the stage lights go
out. Carol Doda bears her breasts for the
second time this night, the 30th time this
week and about the 15,000 th time in the last
10 years.

SOLITUDE—Amid rows of empty seats, a
Stadium groundskeeper prepares for the
next onslaught of Stanford football fans. A
victory this weekend at Washington State
could cause those seats to fill fast for the
Cards' next home game against Oregon
State.
Three middle-aged men sit and ogle in the
front row. The room is dark.
Busty barmaids with halter tops and hot
pants shuttle drinks to the dozen or so
spectators and the three piece band grinds out
some barroom striptease.
On stage, Carol Doda is topless. Forty-four
inches of the most famous mammary glands
Mother Nature and men of science have ever
produced are on display.

The music swells.
Carol strokes the microphone and slowly
brings it to her glossy-red lips. "Sit back and
relax," she suggests with an impudent wiggle
in her voice, "and don't turn the knobs; cause
it hurts."
The First
For 10 years people, have been coming to
San Francisco's Condor Club to see Carol
Doda. She was America's first topless dancer
and a decade later her silicone-injected breasts

still perform tricks just like a well-trained dog.
For Five shows, six nights a week, the
famed twosome jerk and jiggle and bounce in
time to the music. They sway from side to
side along the piano top and coyly hide
behind a penoir.
After the show, enscounced in a plush
black leather chair in the basement office of
the Condor, Carol talks about what it was like
the first night. "I felt shy for a minute and I
thought 'Can I really go down there
without a top on?' But then I thought, 'I
really don't know any other way of breaking
into show business.'
'Very Naive'
"I was very naive. I was only 20 years old
at the time and I was very stupid," she laughs.
"But I just knew that I had the incentive to

Today, Carol Doda enjoys the laurels that
come with hard work. She marches in parades,
poses for nude magazines and does station

Television provides Carol with a change.
"I myself don't feel like being nude on
television," she says. "I like to be diversified. I
don't want to be nude everywhere I go and in

Carol smiles as she looks ahead to the
future. "I'm preparing for big night clubs in
Las Vegas. I want to sing, dance and tell jokes.
You know, I've taken voice lessons for eight
years," she concludes.
Though her act may offend some women's
liberationists, Carol reacts, "I've helped
women's liberation by taking off my clothes. I
mean, they don't wear bras any more, do
they?" She continues, "Being liberated is
being free in your own mind. They're free to
take their own clothes off.
"Everybody's an individual as far as I'm
concerned."
Rowdy Customer
Carol Doda gets up. She's got another show
in 10 minutes and has to get ready. As she
prepares to go on stage she talks of a problem
she had the night before with a rowdy
customer.
"This guy comes on stage," she explains,
"We have panties on you know, and I was in
my act and he came up and kissed me on my
panties. Instead of freaking out, I just looked
at him and said, 'l'm sorry I had my pants
on!' And then I he was really drunk and
then I said,' she rolls her voice, "That's what
you call a half-assed job."
The band strikes up and the stage lights go
out. Carol Doda bears her breasts for the
second time this night, the 30th time this
week and about the 15,000 th time in the last
10 years.

SOLITUDE—Amid rows of empty seats, a
Stadium groundskeeper prepares for the
next onslaught of Stanford football fans. A
victory this weekend at Washington State
could cause those seats to fill fast for the
Cards' next home game against Oregon
State.
Three middle-aged men sit and ogle in the
front row. The room is dark.
Busty barmaids with halter tops and hot
pants shuttle drinks to the dozen or so
spectators and the three piece band grinds out
some barroom striptease.
On stage, Carol Doda is topless. Forty-four
inches of the most famous mammary glands
Mother Nature and men of science have ever
produced are on display.

The music swells.
Carol strokes the microphone and slowly
brings it to her glossy-red lips. "Sit back and
relax," she suggests with an impudent wiggle
in her voice, "and don't turn the knobs; cause
it hurts."
The First
For 10 years people, have been coming to
San Francisco's Condor Club to see Carol
Doda. She was America's first topless dancer
and a decade later her silicone-injected breasts

still perform tricks just like a well-trained dog.
For Five shows, six nights a week, the
famed twosome jerk and jiggle and bounce in
time to the music. They sway from side to
side along the piano top and coyly hide
behind a penoir.
After the show, enscounced in a plush
black leather chair in the basement office of
the Condor, Carol talks about what it was like
the first night. "I felt shy for a minute and I
thought 'Can I really go down there
without a top on?' But then I thought, 'I
really don't know any other way of breaking
into show business.'
'Very Naive'
"I was very naive. I was only 20 years old
at the time and I was very stupid," she laughs.
"But I just knew that I had the incentive to
do it and the feeling, you know. I wanted to
do something."
Six months after she started topless, Carol
had silicone injections which built her up
from 34 inches to 44 inches.
"It didn't change me as a performer,"
Carol notes, "It just enhanced the act so to
speak. I find lots of people like to look at
them."
Carol describes her act as entertainment.
"I'm an entertainer. I'm not a stripper. I strip
in my act, but I also sing and also dance and
also talk to the audience."
She adds with emphasis, "I like to make
people happy, and if I can make people happy
it gives me a thrill."
Sensual Vibratons
"I'm very aware of what I'm doing up
there. You have to be. A lot of it's sensual and
happy vibrations," she says smiling.
In recent years, Carol notes that the show's
"become a family show. More couples, more
families and a lot of long hairs have come
here."
"At one time," she shrugs, "I thought it
was just for businessmen."
Carol sinks low in her chair. Her amply
endowed frame is swathed in a temporary
restraining blouse and the cleavage is
well-defined. She shakes some
platinum-blonde hair from her face and thinks
back on how her career began.
Sinatra's Showgirls
"When I was 12 I thought I wanted to be a
showgirl," she giggles. "I read this funny book

about Frank Sinatra, and these showgirls were
in this magazine with him, and that impressed
me.
"I started here (the Condor) at 17 as a

was 20. But people don't know that," she
