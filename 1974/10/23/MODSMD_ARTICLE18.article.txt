# Researcher To Study Drug Addiction Cause
## 
### RIV WEBER 
Richard E. Clark, research
associate at the Stanford Center
for Research and Development in
Teaching (SCRDT), will begin
investigating correlations between
the psychology of problem solving
and drug addiction in teenagers
under a $52,000 grant from the
United States National Institute
on Drug Abuse.
Clark's research, currently
entangled in legal complications
surrounding the right of
confidentiality, will center around
teenagers who underwent
"problem-identification training"
by Stanford psychologists four
years ago.
Solution Training
The training curriculum was
"intended to help children look
for pertinent information and
question easy solutions,"
according to Joan E. Sieber, head
trainer in the original program.
Seiber, now a psychology
professor at California State
University at Hayward, developed
the "problem-identification"
curriculum for fourth, fifth and
sixth graders from three Bay Area
schools.
The original research group
believed that elementary school
children tend to choose quick
solutions to problems instead of
searching for information. They
also tend to yield to peer pressure,
which often proves harmful, the
researchers speculated.
Resisting Abuse
Clark has expanded these
conceptions in problem solving to
include the development of
attitudes toward drugs. He has
theorized that students who have
been trained to explore all
solutions might be more reluctant
to seek the easy solutions that
drugs appear to offer.
In testing this hypothesis,
Clark's team will locate and
interview as many of the original

students as possible.
Clark noted a circular
evolution in the development of
opinions in children.
Younger children often
dogmatically lecture their parents
about the evils of drugs, such as
cigarettes and liquor, he said.
Recurring Dogmatism
But by the end of the seventh
grade, their attitudes become less
dogmatic and they begin to
consider different points of view.
Attitudes of peers are very
important at this stage, Clark said.
By the tenth or eleventh grade,
these same subjects become
dogmatic again, he concluded,
adding that there appears to be a
"180 degree" turn in their
attitudes.
Clark said he hopes to train
students to accept uncertainty
and thereby soften dogmatism.
His training devices include video
tapes of model children playing
specified roles and analysis of
many parts of a problem "to
generate assumptions of how to
solve it."
Productively Uncertain
Ideally, students will learn to
be "productively uncertain,"
which may minimize trauma
during adolescence.
Should this training technique
prove effective in helping students
resist the temptations of drug
abuse, Clark said he will seek
additional federal funds.
Clark said he hopes to have all
the interviews completed by
December, with results beginning
to appear in January.
Strict laws protecting the
confidentiality rights of students,
parents and the school districts
has already greatly delayed the
research, Clark said.
Clark said students will have
the right to withdraw from the
study, read the transcripts of the
interviews and even request that
the transcripts be destroyed.
