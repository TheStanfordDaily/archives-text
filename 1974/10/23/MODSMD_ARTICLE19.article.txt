# Guide To Alternative Campus Eateries
## 
### STEPHEN WALT 
If you're convinced that the
Tresidder Transition's "PhD
burger" really deserved to flunk
out, and the Food Service has
started recycling the chicken salad
with the jello, you may be seeking
alternative ways to fill that aching
void inside. Here are some
on-campus possibilities:
Law School Lounge
The Friendly Law School
Lounge, operated by the Law
Students' Association, is located
in the Law School basement near
the History Corner of the Quad. If
the crowd of patrons between
classes is any indication, the
Lounge is well geared to student
needs. There are couches and
chairs for anyone desiring a
prolonged stay.

The fare is just what you'd
expect: Coffee and other
beverages, candy, pastries,
cigarettes and fruit. The
atmosphere is relaxed. There's no
uptight security; guests are
trusted.
Prices are reasonable and
quality acceptable. The Law
School Lounge is open weekdays
only, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Business School Lounge
Located in the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) next to
Memorial Auditorium, the
Business School Lounge resembles
the Law School Lounge in setup.
The GSB Lounge seems geared
for more lengthy stops and/or
studying, though; there are plenty
of tables with generally less
cramped conditions. The snack
bar features packaged sandwiches
and assorted beverages, open
Monday through Friday, from7:3o
a.m. until 4:30 p.m.
Education School Snack Bar
The Education School Snack
Bar in the basement of Cubberley
Auditorium is operated by an
independent delicatessen
company which leases the space.
Accordingly, the many varieties of
hot and cold sandwiches and
cheeses available have a more
delicatessen-like character.
Yogurt and pastries
complement a wide selection of
beverages as well. The
management is especially proud of
its fresh coffee at 15 cents a cup.
Because the actual lounge space i£
limited, the Education School
Lounge is probably most suited to
provide a quick snack on campus.
People's Teahouse
For those with nighttime
munchies, the People's Teahouse
may be just the answer. Located
next to Madera House lounge in
Wilbur Hall, this student-run
establishment offers Oriental
cuisine at reasonable prices
(although higher than last year)
and in adequate surroundings.
House specialities include Char
siu Bao (this you gotta try!),
various flavors of Ramen noodle
soug, and assorted teas. A brief
stop here could tide you through
an all-nighter. Open 9 p.m. to
midnight every night of the week.
Encina Commons
This place is a real sleeper,
suffering from an undeserved lack
of publicity. TDS Inc., the same
company that manages Tresidder's
Transition, operates The

Commons. The staff emphasizes
that they are different, though,
and they make a convincing case
for themselves.
There is a wide offering of
breakfast, lunch, and dinner
items, all quite reasonably priced
and of acceptable quality,
approximately on the level of a
standard walk-in, sit-down, short
order restaurant.
Hot entrees are cooked on the
premises, rather than being
pre-packaged as at Tresidder.
The Commons has recently
instituted hot dinners; for
example, a lamb chop with a
choice of vegetable and salad, all
for $2.10.
• The atmosphere is very
pleasant, not impersonally large,
with wood paneling and bright
covered tables. Open for breakfast
7 to 11 a.m., lunch 11 a.m. to 3
p.m., hot dinners 5 to 7 p.m.,
fountain and snacks throughout.
Tresidder Coffeehouse
A traditional Friday night

hangout on campus, the
Coffeehouse offers the most
intimate surroundings, available,
and some of the best food. It's
expensive, though, and prices just
went up again. The Coffeehouse
sells several varieties of coffee
along with Italian sodas, natural
cider and milk. Also featured are
made-to-order sandwiches and
assorted pastries. Truly fine
cheesecake is served in small
portions.
In addition, chess players are
bound to get a game from
someone. Other intellectually
oriented visitors may want to try
their hand at the computerized
"Galaxy Game."
The Coffeehouse occasionally
presents informal entertainment
and is located in Tresidder Union,
adjacent to the bowling alley.
Open Monday through Thursday
11 a.m. to midnight; Friday 11
a.m. to 1 a.m.; Saturday noon to
1 a.m.; Sunday noon to midnight.

suffering from an undeserved lack
of publicity. TDS Inc., the same
company that manages Tresidder's
Transition, operates The

Commons. The staff emphasizes
that they are different, though,
and they make a convincing case
for themselves.
There is a wide offering of
breakfast, lunch, and dinner
items, all quite reasonably priced
and of acceptable quality,
approximately on the level of a
standard walk-in, sit-down, short
order restaurant.
Hot entrees are cooked on the
premises, rather than being
pre-packaged as at Tresidder.
The Commons has recently
instituted hot dinners; for
example, a lamb chop with a
choice of vegetable and salad, all
for $2.10.
• The atmosphere is very
pleasant, not impersonally large,
with wood paneling and bright
covered tables. Open for breakfast
7 to 11 a.m., lunch 11 a.m. to 3
p.m., hot dinners 5 to 7 p.m.,
fountain and snacks throughout.
Tresidder Coffeehouse
A traditional Friday night

hangout on campus, the
Coffeehouse offers the most
intimate surroundings, available,
and some of the best food. It's
expensive, though, and prices just
went up again. The Coffeehouse
sells several varieties of coffee
along with Italian sodas, natural
cider and milk. Also featured are
made-to-order sandwiches and
assorted pastries. Truly fine
cheesecake is served in small
portions.
In addition, chess players are
bound to get a game from
someone. Other intellectually
oriented visitors may want to try
their hand at the computerized
"Galaxy Game."
The Coffeehouse occasionally
presents informal entertainment
and is located in Tresidder Union,
adjacent to the bowling alley.
Open Monday through Thursday
11 a.m. to midnight; Friday 11
a.m. to 1 a.m.; Saturday noon to
1 a.m.; Sunday noon to midnight.

UNCOMMON?—It may not be very crowded, but the Encina
Commons is one of the few places on campus with a wide offering of
breakfast, lunch and dinner items, all quite reasonably priced.
If you're convinced that the
Tresidder Transition's "PhD
burger" really deserved to flunk
out, and the Food Service has
started recycling the chicken salad
with the jello, you may be seeking
alternative ways to fill that aching
void inside. Here are some
on-campus possibilities:
Law School Lounge
The Friendly Law School
Lounge, operated by the Law
Students' Association, is located
in the Law School basement near
the History Corner of the Quad. If
the crowd of patrons between
classes is any indication, the
Lounge is well geared to student
needs. There are couches and
chairs for anyone desiring a
prolonged stay.

The fare is just what you'd
expect: Coffee and other
beverages, candy, pastries,
cigarettes and fruit. The
atmosphere is relaxed. There's no
uptight security; guests are
trusted.
Prices are reasonable and
quality acceptable. The Law
School Lounge is open weekdays
only, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Business School Lounge
Located in the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) next to
Memorial Auditorium, the
Business School Lounge resembles
the Law School Lounge in setup.
The GSB Lounge seems geared
for more lengthy stops and/or
studying, though; there are plenty
of tables with generally less
cramped conditions. The snack
bar features packaged sandwiches
and assorted beverages, open
Monday through Friday, from7:3o
a.m. until 4:30 p.m.
Education School Snack Bar
The Education School Snack
Bar in the basement of Cubberley
Auditorium is operated by an
independent delicatessen
company which leases the space.
Accordingly, the many varieties of
hot and cold sandwiches and
cheeses available have a more
delicatessen-like character.
Yogurt and pastries
complement a wide selection of
beverages as well. The
management is especially proud of
its fresh coffee at 15 cents a cup.
Because the actual lounge space i£
limited, the Education School
Lounge is probably most suited to
provide a quick snack on campus.
People's Teahouse
For those with nighttime
munchies, the People's Teahouse
may be just the answer. Located
next to Madera House lounge in
Wilbur Hall, this student-run
establishment offers Oriental
cuisine at reasonable prices
(although higher than last year)
and in adequate surroundings.
House specialities include Char
siu Bao (this you gotta try!),
various flavors of Ramen noodle
soug, and assorted teas. A brief
stop here could tide you through
an all-nighter. Open 9 p.m. to
midnight every night of the week.

classes is any indication, the
Lounge is well geared to student
needs. There are couches and
chairs for anyone desiring a
prolonged stay.

The fare is just what you'd
expect: Coffee and other
beverages, candy, pastries,
cigarettes and fruit. The
atmosphere is relaxed. There's no
uptight security; guests are
trusted.
Prices are reasonable and
quality acceptable. The Law
School Lounge is open weekdays
only, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Business School Lounge
Located in the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) next to
Memorial Auditorium, the
Business School Lounge resembles
the Law School Lounge in setup.
The GSB Lounge seems geared
for more lengthy stops and/or
studying, though; there are plenty
of tables with generally less
cramped conditions. The snack
bar features packaged sandwiches
and assorted beverages, open
Monday through Friday, from7:3o
a.m. until 4:30 p.m.
Education School Snack Bar
The Education School Snack
Bar in the basement of Cubberley
Auditorium is operated by an
independent delicatessen
company which leases the space.
Accordingly, the many varieties of
hot and cold sandwiches and
cheeses available have a more
delicatessen-like character.
Yogurt and pastries
complement a wide selection of
beverages as well. The
management is especially proud of
its fresh coffee at 15 cents a cup.
Because the actual lounge space i£
limited, the Education School
Lounge is probably most suited to
provide a quick snack on campus.
People's Teahouse
For those with nighttime
munchies, the People's Teahouse
may be just the answer. Located
next to Madera House lounge in
Wilbur Hall, this student-run
establishment offers Oriental
cuisine at reasonable prices
(although higher than last year)
and in adequate surroundings.
House specialities include Char
siu Bao (this you gotta try!),
various flavors of Ramen noodle
soug, and assorted teas. A brief
stop here could tide you through
an all-nighter. Open 9 p.m. to
midnight every night of the week.
Encina Commons
This place is a real sleeper,
suffering from an undeserved lack
of publicity. TDS Inc., the same
company that manages Tresidder's
Transition, operates The

Commons. The staff emphasizes
that they are different, though,
and they make a convincing case
for themselves.
There is a wide offering of
breakfast, lunch, and dinner
items, all quite reasonably priced
and of acceptable quality,
approximately on the level of a
standard walk-in, sit-down, short
order restaurant.
Hot entrees are cooked on the
premises, rather than being
pre-packaged as at Tresidder.
The Commons has recently
instituted hot dinners; for
example, a lamb chop with a
choice of vegetable and salad, all
for $2.10.
• The atmosphere is very
pleasant, not impersonally large,
with wood paneling and bright
covered tables. Open for breakfast
7 to 11 a.m., lunch 11 a.m. to 3
p.m., hot dinners 5 to 7 p.m.,
fountain and snacks throughout.
Tresidder Coffeehouse
A traditional Friday night

hangout on campus, the
Coffeehouse offers the most
intimate surroundings, available,
and some of the best food. It's
expensive, though, and prices just
went up again. The Coffeehouse
sells several varieties of coffee
along with Italian sodas, natural
cider and milk. Also featured are
made-to-order sandwiches and
assorted pastries. Truly fine
cheesecake is served in small
portions.
In addition, chess players are
bound to get a game from
someone. Other intellectually
oriented visitors may want to try
their hand at the computerized
"Galaxy Game."
The Coffeehouse occasionally
presents informal entertainment
and is located in Tresidder Union,
adjacent to the bowling alley.
Open Monday through Thursday
11 a.m. to midnight; Friday 11
a.m. to 1 a.m.; Saturday noon to
1 a.m.; Sunday noon to midnight.

UNCOMMON?—It may not be very crowded, but the Encina
Commons is one of the few places on campus with a wide offering of

If you're convinced that the
Tresidder Transition's "PhD
burger" really deserved to flunk
out, and the Food Service has
started recycling the chicken salad
with the jello, you may be seeking
alternative ways to fill that aching
void inside. Here are some
on-campus possibilities:
