# Five Disqualified In ASSU Election
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
The ASSU Senate last night upheld
an elections commission report
disqualifying five candidates from the
Senate race for violating campaign
regulations, and later elected Lee
Rosenbaum as its new chairman.
After approving the election results
by an 18-2 vote, the Senate deadlocked
at 10-10 on the disqualification issue.
Temporary Senate Chairman Quinn
Mayer, ASSU vice president, cast the
deciding vote in favor of
disqualification.
The report, written by Elections
Commissioner Thomas A. Fitzgerald,
cited illegal campaign literature
posting by the five candidates: Chip
Underwood, Derek Toliver, Chip
Weiland, Peter Truex and Louie
Montoya.
Underwood and Toliver were
elected as senator and as first alternate
respectively in the ASSU elections
held less than two weeks ago.
Rosenbaum served as the Senate's
parliamentarian in the last session.
ASSU Preisdent Mike Herman said
"Rosenbaum is an excellent choice for
the job." The Senate elected graduate
student Janice Haney as vice chairman.
During the debate on the elections
disqualification, Underwood denied
placing his campaign posters on

classroom doors and on trees against
ASSU regulations.
"The exact rule [in the ASSU
by-laws] says 'posted on trees' and
mine was 15 feet away from any tree,"
Underwood said.
Fitzgerald then said he found
another Underwood campaign poster
on the door of Room 300. Underwood
also denied that charge.
Toliver also denied the allegations
against him. "I did not put my posters
on the Bookstore. There's no proof
that I was responsible, and I was not,"
Toliver said.
Herman feared the Senate might set
a "bad precedent" if the candidates
were not disqualified. "It's important
that we take a stand right now. We
have to prevent these election
violations in the future," he said.
Fitzgerald will present a full report
on the ASSU elections to the Senate
next week. The Senate directed him
by a 13-3 vote to investigate further
the disqualification issue.
In other action, the Senate voted to
split air fare expenses with the Council
of Presidents in sending ASSU Sen.
Kevin McDermott to a conference on
tuition in private colleges and
universities. The conference will be
held in Claremont next week.
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri reported the collection of over
$BO,OOO in student fee assessments
autumn quarter. About $BOOO will be
reimbursed to students "if past
experience proves correct," Olivieri
said.
Olivieri also announced that the
ASSU "Check Design Contest" has
been cancalled for lack of interest. The
ASSU had offered $2OO to the winner.
Here is the new, official list of
undergraduate senators as determined
by the elections commission (the 10
graduate positions remain unchanged):
Tom "Tuna" Price 453
Kevin McDermott 414
Maria Echaveste 382
Lyse Strnad 366

by an 18-2 vote, the Senate deadlocked
at 10-10 on the disqualification issue.
Temporary Senate Chairman Quinn
Mayer, ASSU vice president, cast the
deciding vote in favor of
disqualification.
The report, written by Elections
Commissioner Thomas A. Fitzgerald,
cited illegal campaign literature
posting by the five candidates: Chip
Underwood, Derek Toliver, Chip
Weiland, Peter Truex and Louie
Montoya.
Underwood and Toliver were
elected as senator and as first alternate
respectively in the ASSU elections
held less than two weeks ago.
Rosenbaum served as the Senate's
parliamentarian in the last session.
ASSU Preisdent Mike Herman said
"Rosenbaum is an excellent choice for
the job." The Senate elected graduate
student Janice Haney as vice chairman.
During the debate on the elections
disqualification, Underwood denied
placing his campaign posters on

classroom doors and on trees against
ASSU regulations.
"The exact rule [in the ASSU
by-laws] says 'posted on trees' and
mine was 15 feet away from any tree,"
Underwood said.
Fitzgerald then said he found
another Underwood campaign poster
on the door of Room 300. Underwood
also denied that charge.
Toliver also denied the allegations
against him. "I did not put my posters
on the Bookstore. There's no proof
that I was responsible, and I was not,"
Toliver said.
Herman feared the Senate might set
a "bad precedent" if the candidates
were not disqualified. "It's important
that we take a stand right now. We
have to prevent these election
violations in the future," he said.
Fitzgerald will present a full report
on the ASSU elections to the Senate
next week. The Senate directed him
by a 13-3 vote to investigate further
the disqualification issue.
In other action, the Senate voted to
split air fare expenses with the Council
of Presidents in sending ASSU Sen.
Kevin McDermott to a conference on
tuition in private colleges and
universities. The conference will be
held in Claremont next week.
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri reported the collection of over
$BO,OOO in student fee assessments
autumn quarter. About $BOOO will be
reimbursed to students "if past
experience proves correct," Olivieri
said.
Olivieri also announced that the
ASSU "Check Design Contest" has
been cancalled for lack of interest. The
ASSU had offered $2OO to the winner.
