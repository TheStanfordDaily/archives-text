# Teacher Cites Jung's Ideas About Psyche
## 
### 
Psychologist Carl Jung was
"ahead of his time" with the
belief that all people should have
both feminine and masculine
principles in their psyches, teacher
and family counselor Jeanne
Shutes said at the YWCA Tuesday
sandwich series yesterday.
The feminine principle is
concerned with relationship or
ideal, according to Jung, and the
masculine principle is concerned
with reason and discrimination.
Shutes said the . goal of
development is to balance both
principles in one's consciousness.
This development of
consciousness usually starts after a
confrontation which makes the
person recognize a need or lack of
awareness in herself, she said.
"Women tend to fall into a
'compassion trap,' " she said,
where they are distracted by
compassions and demands. While
caught in this "trap" women
usually are not free to pursue
their own development.
Shutes also discussed Jung's
notion of "collective ideal," in
which women surrender to
society's norms.
"To be a woman and to be out
of the collective ideal has not
been easy," she said.
Shutes holds an M.A. degree in
counseling and works at the Palo
Alto Adult Education Center
teaching a course on women in
literature. She has also been a
family counselor for the First
Congregational Church.
