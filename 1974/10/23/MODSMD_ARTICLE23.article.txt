# Author Says Engineers Will Kill Wild River
## 
### D. PAUL YEUELL 
Martin Huevelmans, author of
The River Killers, a book about
the Army Corps of Engineers, last
Friday claimed the Corps is
"writing another scenario for
another river-killing" on the
Stanislaus River.
Speaking to a small crowd on
the Tresidder patio, Huevelmans
characterized the Corps as
"masters of deceit" and said he
has found "no truth" in Corps
statements after 10 years of
investigation.
Although he admitted he was
not fully informed on the
Stanislaus River issue, he charged
that the New Melones Dam
Project slated for the river has all
the appearances of another Corps
"boondoggle."
State Prop. 17 on the Nov. 5
ballot seeks to halt Corps

construction of the dam. ,
Huevelmans said resolution of
the Stanislaus River issue hinges
on whether or not "you believe
what the Corps of Engineers is
telling you.
"It is customary for the Corps
to falsify their reports" to insure
that projects win approval,
Huevelmans said.
Pointing to a publication from
the General Accounting Office as
documentation, Huevelmans
accused the Corps of falsifying
figures in a report to Congress to
secure passage of the Sprewrells
Bluff Dam Project on the Flint
River in Georgia.
The Corps is forced to arrange
Congressional approval and
funding of profit-making projects
to support a massive bureaucracy,
Huevelmans said.
The Civil Works branch of the
Corps alone consists of 25
offices and 30,000 civilian
employees and is guided chiefly
by "military engineers" rather
than civil engineers, according to
Huevelmans.
These military engineers are
trained to "kill and destroy"
rather than to build public works,
he claimed.
"The American landscape lies
tattered and trampled beneath the
marching feet of the implacable
Corps of Engineers," he wrote in
his book.
The Army Corps of Engineers
was first commissioned for public
works in 1924 to remove
obstructions from the Ohio River.
The Corps has since grown into a
vast, powerful federal agency.
