## Hooters Outplay UC-Davis But Manage To Lose, 2-1 
### DAN PYNE 
A breakaway shot with two
minutes remaining in the game
left the Stanford soccer team with
its fifth loss in six games, as
UC-Davis edged the Cardinal
booters 2-1 yesterday.
Down 1-0, Stanford played an
inspired second half but was
unable to score more than once.
UC-Davis had only two shots in
the second period, while the
Cardinals shot 11 times.
"We played well," varsity
coach Bert Baldacinni said after
the game. "We outshot them; we
outplayed them in the second
half. Our shots went off the

crossbar and bounced off of
people... we controlled the
second half."
The first half was evenly
matched, both teams taking three
shots. Stanford looked a little
sluggish, and threw away passes
on offensive drives. But late in the
period a Davis forward pressed the
Cardinal defense, dribbled to the
side of two defensemen and
scored on a shot from the edge of
the penalty area.
Stanford goalie Bruce
Mosbacher said it was inevitable.
"It's the same problem we've been
having all year... if you give
someone that much time to shoot

they're going to score."
In the second half Stanford
took control of the ball and the
game, but were unable to get their
shots in the net. Mac Taylor
scored midway in the period,
driving a shot into the left side of
the Davis goal. Stanford kept the
pressure on Davis and appeared to
be in scoring position several more
times but did not score again.
Then, in the 43rd minute,
Donny Briggs, a 9.8 sprinter, took
a pass at midfield, outraced
fullback Phil Wright to the
penalty area, and somehow
chipped the ball over Mosbacher
for Davis' winning goal.
Briggs had four breakaways in
the game, two in the second half,
but Mosbacher came out of the
goal to break up the first three.
As a Stanford spectator put it
after Briggs's third attempt, "That
guy is fast as he 11..." Mosbacher
said it felt like the guy was
running at him all game.
Thus, a new trend begins in
Stanford soccer. Against Cal and
UC-Davis the Cardinals outplayed
their opponents but did not win.
Perhaps things will get
straightened out, and Stanford
will both outplay its opponent
and win, against Chico State this
Friday. The Cardinals are home
again next Tuesday at 4 p.m.,
playing Sacramento State.
