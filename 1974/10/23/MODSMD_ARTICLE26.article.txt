## Dark's Returning (Thank The Lord) 
### Glenn Garvin 
I hired him once before, I fired him, now
* I've hired him again, and I'll fire him again.
Only one man in the world could have
spoken those words, and if you guessed Jack
Christiansen on the subject of Mike Cordova,
well, you ought to get 15 yards for
unsportsmanlike conduct. It was really—you
guessed it—Charlie Finley on the subject of
* Alvin Dark.
Actually that statement is one of the few
things Finley has ever said that you can
completely rely on. There can be no doubt
whatsoever in the minds of rational men that
Charlie Finley will fire Alvin Dark sooner or
later.
Charlie Finley, whatever his other skills,
has always been pretty good at firing men
who manage his Oakland Athletics; so good,
in fact, that 13 of them have come and gone
during the past 15 seasons. Dark, who just
signed for next year, is on his second tour of
duty, having lasted a year-and-a-half in 1966
and 1967.
Dark was axed in 1967 for inciting his
team to write a public letter attacking Finley
(according to one story) or for refusing to
fire a player who Finley said used obscenities
(according to another).. Really, it doesn't
matter; he would have gotten it sooner or
later for something: chewing gum in public,
V drinking from the executive water fountain,
or failing to wash his hands after going to the
bathroom. Charlie gets them all sooner or
later.
Whatever it was Dark did, Finley
apparently decided that since it had been
seven years, the statute of limitations was up.
After Dick Williams quit last year, he called
up Dark. Bingo, Dark was a major leaguer
again. For a while.
Just how long this stint will last was a
constant subject of speculation this summer.

Bay Area sportswriters, when they got bored
watching and Athletics beating the hell out
of everyone, could always write a great
column about how Charlie and threatened his
manager again last night for failing to provide
enough mustard for the clubhouse hot dogs,
or whatever.
"If you don't start playing aggressive
baseball, I'll kick ass out of here," Charlie
screamed routinely last May. "We won two
years without you, and we can win again
without you."
Gee, Charlie.
Strange Philosophy
Actually, there are a lot of good reasons
to kick Dark out of baseball. Try this one for
starters: "The past few years I've tried to
think of how Jesus Christ would handle
ballplayers" Dark said when someone asked
how he intended to run the club last spring.
Clearly anyone who is willing to say such
a thing in public—in front of live, adult
witnesses—has a tenuous grip on reality at
best. But it didn't stop there.
"If Mr. Finley says this will be done, it
will be done," Dark once said about Finley's
interference with the team. "The Bible
teaches you to listen to your boss." His most
frequent advice, to anyone with any problem
from a hangnail to a divorce, was "I am a
poor sinner and nothing at all, but Jesus
Christ is my all and all."
When players hinted that this sort of thing
was not exactly their idea of dynamic
leadership, Dark replied: "Great peace have
they which love thy law, and nothing shall
offend them."
Not Interesting
Statements like these should be enough to
convince almost anyone that Dark's cranium
has turned to mush. But his greatest crime is
simply that he isn't very interesting any

more.
In the old days, when he managed the
Giants, Dark was lots of fun. He regularly
threw tantrums in the clubhouse, and once
hurled an entire buffet table loaded with
food at a player who miffed him. And he
openly lived with an airline stewardess, even
though he was married to someone else. This
last episode ended his tenure with Horace
Stoneham's club.
Alas, that Dark is no more the new one is
a cross between Billy Graham and the Hardy
Boys, spouting homilies until it makes you
want to throw up.
He Won
However: he won. And when you look at
the team he did it with, well, maybe it would
have taken Jesus Christ, or at'least the Pope,
to have done it. The only hitting the
Athletics did this year was on each other
they are probably the only major league team
in history to beat up their number one
reliever the day before the World Series.
The Oakland club is the 1 world's largest
traveling insane asylum. Right fielder Reggie
Jackson, for instance, once said "I'd rather
hit than have sex." Not only is the man
clearly out of his mind, he's probably
celibate considering his batting average last
year.
For Alvin Dark to take over a defending
world champion, after the departure of an
extremely popular manager, steer a clear
course between a team of fools and an owner
with the brain of a porpoise, and
it's too much to believe. And he even won
the World Series in five games, something
Dick Williams could never do.
So Alvin Dark will be back next year—for
a while. He deserves it, even if he doesn't
win. Because all things considered, managing
the Athletics is its own punishment.

Charlie Finley, whatever his other skills,
has always been pretty good at firing men
who manage his Oakland Athletics; so good,
in fact, that 13 of them have come and gone
during the past 15 seasons. Dark, who just
signed for next year, is on his second tour of
duty, having lasted a year-and-a-half in 1966
and 1967.
Dark was axed in 1967 for inciting his
team to write a public letter attacking Finley
(according to one story) or for refusing to
fire a player who Finley said used obscenities
(according to another).. Really, it doesn't
matter; he would have gotten it sooner or
later for something: chewing gum in public,
V drinking from the executive water fountain,
or failing to wash his hands after going to the
bathroom. Charlie gets them all sooner or
later.
Whatever it was Dark did, Finley
apparently decided that since it had been
seven years, the statute of limitations was up.
After Dick Williams quit last year, he called
up Dark. Bingo, Dark was a major leaguer
again. For a while.
Just how long this stint will last was a
constant subject of speculation this summer.

Bay Area sportswriters, when they got bored
watching and Athletics beating the hell out
of everyone, could always write a great
column about how Charlie and threatened his
manager again last night for failing to provide
enough mustard for the clubhouse hot dogs,
or whatever.
"If you don't start playing aggressive
baseball, I'll kick ass out of here," Charlie
screamed routinely last May. "We won two
years without you, and we can win again
without you."
Gee, Charlie.
Strange Philosophy
Actually, there are a lot of good reasons
to kick Dark out of baseball. Try this one for
starters: "The past few years I've tried to
think of how Jesus Christ would handle
ballplayers" Dark said when someone asked
how he intended to run the club last spring.
Clearly anyone who is willing to say such
a thing in public—in front of live, adult
witnesses—has a tenuous grip on reality at
best. But it didn't stop there.
"If Mr. Finley says this will be done, it
will be done," Dark once said about Finley's
interference with the team. "The Bible
teaches you to listen to your boss." His most
frequent advice, to anyone with any problem
from a hangnail to a divorce, was "I am a
poor sinner and nothing at all, but Jesus
Christ is my all and all."
When players hinted that this sort of thing
was not exactly their idea of dynamic
leadership, Dark replied: "Great peace have
they which love thy law, and nothing shall
offend them."
Not Interesting
Statements like these should be enough to
convince almost anyone that Dark's cranium
has turned to mush. But his greatest crime is
simply that he isn't very interesting any

more.
In the old days, when he managed the
Giants, Dark was lots of fun. He regularly
threw tantrums in the clubhouse, and once
hurled an entire buffet table loaded with
food at a player who miffed him. And he
openly lived with an airline stewardess, even
though he was married to someone else. This
last episode ended his tenure with Horace
Stoneham's club.
Alas, that Dark is no more the new one is
a cross between Billy Graham and the Hardy
Boys, spouting homilies until it makes you
want to throw up.
He Won
However: he won. And when you look at
the team he did it with, well, maybe it would
have taken Jesus Christ, or at'least the Pope,
to have done it. The only hitting the
Athletics did this year was on each other
they are probably the only major league team
in history to beat up their number one
reliever the day before the World Series.
The Oakland club is the 1 world's largest
traveling insane asylum. Right fielder Reggie
Jackson, for instance, once said "I'd rather
hit than have sex." Not only is the man
clearly out of his mind, he's probably
celibate considering his batting average last
year.
For Alvin Dark to take over a defending
world champion, after the departure of an
extremely popular manager, steer a clear
course between a team of fools and an owner
with the brain of a porpoise, and
it's too much to believe. And he even won
the World Series in five games, something
Dick Williams could never do.
So Alvin Dark will be back next year—for
a while. He deserves it, even if he doesn't
win. Because all things considered, managing
the Athletics is its own punishment.
I hired him once before, I fired him, now
* I've hired him again, and I'll fire him again.
Only one man in the world could have
spoken those words, and if you guessed Jack
Christiansen on the subject of Mike Cordova,
well, you ought to get 15 yards for
unsportsmanlike conduct. It was really—you
guessed it—Charlie Finley on the subject of
* Alvin Dark.
Actually that statement is one of the few
things Finley has ever said that you can
completely rely on. There can be no doubt
whatsoever in the minds of rational men that
Charlie Finley will fire Alvin Dark sooner or
later.

later for something: chewing gum in public,
V drinking from the executive water fountain,
or failing to wash his hands after going to the
bathroom. Charlie gets them all sooner or
later.
Whatever it was Dark did, Finley
apparently decided that since it had been
seven years, the statute of limitations was up.
After Dick Williams quit last year, he called
up Dark. Bingo, Dark was a major leaguer
again. For a while.
Just how long this stint will last was a
constant subject of speculation this summer.

Bay Area sportswriters, when they got bored
watching and Athletics beating the hell out
of everyone, could always write a great
column about how Charlie and threatened his
manager again last night for failing to provide
enough mustard for the clubhouse hot dogs,
or whatever.
"If you don't start playing aggressive
baseball, I'll kick ass out of here," Charlie
screamed routinely last May. "We won two
years without you, and we can win again
without you."
Gee, Charlie.
Strange Philosophy
Actually, there are a lot of good reasons
to kick Dark out of baseball. Try this one for
starters: "The past few years I've tried to
think of how Jesus Christ would handle
ballplayers" Dark said when someone asked
how he intended to run the club last spring.
Clearly anyone who is willing to say such
a thing in public—in front of live, adult
witnesses—has a tenuous grip on reality at
best. But it didn't stop there.
"If Mr. Finley says this will be done, it
will be done," Dark once said about Finley's
interference with the team. "The Bible
teaches you to listen to your boss." His most
frequent advice, to anyone with any problem
from a hangnail to a divorce, was "I am a
poor sinner and nothing at all, but Jesus
Christ is my all and all."
When players hinted that this sort of thing
was not exactly their idea of dynamic
leadership, Dark replied: "Great peace have
they which love thy law, and nothing shall
offend them."
Not Interesting
Statements like these should be enough to
convince almost anyone that Dark's cranium
has turned to mush. But his greatest crime is
simply that he isn't very interesting any

more.
In the old days, when he managed the
Giants, Dark was lots of fun. He regularly
threw tantrums in the clubhouse, and once
hurled an entire buffet table loaded with
food at a player who miffed him. And he
openly lived with an airline stewardess, even
though he was married to someone else. This
last episode ended his tenure with Horace
Stoneham's club.
Alas, that Dark is no more the new one is
a cross between Billy Graham and the Hardy
Boys, spouting homilies until it makes you
want to throw up.
He Won
However: he won. And when you look at
the team he did it with, well, maybe it would
have taken Jesus Christ, or at'least the Pope,
to have done it. The only hitting the
Athletics did this year was on each other
they are probably the only major league team
in history to beat up their number one
reliever the day before the World Series.
The Oakland club is the 1 world's largest
traveling insane asylum. Right fielder Reggie
Jackson, for instance, once said "I'd rather
hit than have sex." Not only is the man
clearly out of his mind, he's probably
celibate considering his batting average last
year.
For Alvin Dark to take over a defending
world champion, after the departure of an
extremely popular manager, steer a clear
course between a team of fools and an owner
with the brain of a porpoise, and
it's too much to believe. And he even won
the World Series in five games, something
Dick Williams could never do.
So Alvin Dark will be back next year—for
a while. He deserves it, even if he doesn't
win. Because all things considered, managing
the Athletics is its own punishment.
I hired him once before, I fired him, now
* I've hired him again, and I'll fire him again.
Only one man in the world could have
spoken those words, and if you guessed Jack
Christiansen on the subject of Mike Cordova,
well, you ought to get 15 yards for
unsportsmanlike conduct. It was really—you
guessed it—Charlie Finley on the subject of
* Alvin Dark.
Actually that statement is one of the few
things Finley has ever said that you can
completely rely on. There can be no doubt
whatsoever in the minds of rational men that
Charlie Finley will fire Alvin Dark sooner or
later.
Charlie Finley, whatever his other skills,
has always been pretty good at firing men
who manage his Oakland Athletics; so good,
in fact, that 13 of them have come and gone
during the past 15 seasons. Dark, who just
signed for next year, is on his second tour of
duty, having lasted a year-and-a-half in 1966
and 1967.
Dark was axed in 1967 for inciting his
team to write a public letter attacking Finley
(according to one story) or for refusing to
fire a player who Finley said used obscenities
(according to another).. Really, it doesn't
matter; he would have gotten it sooner or
later for something: chewing gum in public,
V drinking from the executive water fountain,
or failing to wash his hands after going to the
