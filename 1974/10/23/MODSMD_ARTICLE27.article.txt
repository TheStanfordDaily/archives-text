## Christiansen An Excellent Coach 
### Viae Kershner 
So that you don't waste five minutes in
Prof. Chace and Kennedy's class reading
something with which you violently disagree,
I'll start with my conclusion: that Jack
Christiansen is about as good a football coach
as Stanford in 1974 could possibly have.
Coach Chris has a team that has blown a
couple games to be 1-3-2. For that reason
alone, he has been the target of the ire of
alumni, columnists and the Band, which as
always serves as the most clever
manifestation of Stanford student
skepticism.
But I think Chris is doing a good job. My
argument has three parts; that Chris inherited
a mess from which he still suffers; that he is a
good football coach, despite what the
quarterback situation might lead you to
believe; and that he is the type of man we
want coaching our school's football team.
Wilting Petals
When Christiansen took over after the
second Rose Bowl, he inherited little but
wilting petals. The team had lost 13 starters
from the year before. The 1971 freshman
squad was one of the poorest excuses for a
football team ever put on the field. In an era
when no freshmen could play varsity, the
team got killed week after week— 37-0 by
USC, 40-0 by Cal. v
So, whatever talent Chris has managed to
squeeze out of that year's class (this year's
seniors) he's done himself.
Players such as Jim Kaffen say the reason
Mike White (who was offered the Stanford
head job when John Ralston resigned) went
to Cal was that White thought the Bears had
a much, much better team.
So Ralston and White left, taking with
them four assistant coaches. The loss of six
men gave Christiansen practically no one to
help him recruit.
By the time he hastily put together a staff,
the recruiting season of 1972 was lost. Out of
that year comes this year's junior class. You
know how many juniors started last week?
Exactly one— Geb Church.
So Christiansen now has a group of seniors
he pieced together himself and a bunch of
j spirited, but not too talented, juniors. With
the material Stanford has now, I don't know
how anyone believed our publicity
! department when it mumbled about a Rose
Bowl. On paper, USC 2000, Stanford 0 seems
like a good prediction.
But despite the sympathetic "No" answer
Dean of Rejections Fred Hargadon keeps
giving Chris, he's put together good
back-to-back recruiting years. Let's wait till
his freshmen and sophomores grow up before
we knock Christiansen for wasting talent.
Before jumping to parts two and three,
here are two more questions.
1) In nine years of coaching, how many
times did Ralston have winning in conference
records?
2) Compared to other schools, what does

Stanford spend for recruiting?
Answer to question 1 is three years— 1969
through 1971. The rest of the time, Ralston
couldn't win, probably because he didn't get
talent into school, either.
Answer to question 2 is that Stanford is
not only dead last in recruiting budgets
amont the Pac-8 schools, but spends only
about half as much as its nearest competitor,
USC. John McKay gets a lot of talent for
only $39,000, less than the six other teams
spend. Christiansen gets a similar amount of
talent, dollar for dollar, with a token
$20,000.
Coaching Ability
OK, before you think I'm grilling you like
Professor Horn, let's talk about the
quarterback situation and Chris' general
coaching ability.
Chris knows quarterbacks. Jim Plunkett
gives him a lot of credit for helping him
develop into a superstar.
At the beginning of this year, Chris was
convinced Mike Cordova was the best of the
three QB's having studied numerous films
and seeing practices. But rather than give
Mike the job, Chris decided to take another
look at all of them. He did, in the four
non-conference games, and caught hell for it.
The Pac-8 season began. Everyone
clamored for Chris to make a choice before
his switching around ruined our Rose Bowl
chances. He did. Maybe you don't think it
was the right choice, and maybe I don't
either.
But Chris gave them all chances, and then
started the one he thought best. Cordova's
showing Saturday gives evidence he may have
been right. I can't tell yet. But he's the

coach, and he made what he knew would be
an unpopular choice— without violating any
promises.
Public opinion polls are fun. Dick Nixon
used them to decide his strategy. Should we
expect our coaches to follow his lead?
Proven Ability
In general, the coaches' competence was
proven by last season's 7-4 record. With an
offense that bordered on the metaphysical,
Stanford still managed to beat every team it
could have been expected to, losing only to
four top-10 teams.
This year, things haven't been so good,
but the Cards have still beaten the point
spread their last three games. Point spreads
aren't wins, but bookies usually assess
potential pretty well.
Chris and his aides have made the most of
their players, with the exception of the
defensive linemen. And I'm confident Norb
Hecker, one of college football's best
assistants, will come in and straighten out
that particular mess.
Our Kind Of Guy
On to the final point, that Chris is the
type of man we want coaching our football
team. As Stanford students, we wouldn't like
coaches who slapped players around and
treated them like kids.
Chris doesn't. The quotes unearthed by
Gary Cavalli (see Friday's Daily) illustrate
this well.
Chris tells players like James Lofton that,
sure, if they want to go out for track instead
of spring football, go ahead. If Gordy Riegel
wants to go to Europe and he and several
other people want to play rugby and Gary
Anderson wrestles and gets hurt, Chris
doesn't scream. And if Jerry Waldvogel wants
to miss an occasional practice with a lab and
Forrie Martin can't make the game with
Hawaii because of schoolwork, that's OK
too.
Chris lets his players go tieless on road
trips and have long hair all the time. Sure, he
doesn't want players smoking cigarettes or
joints in his face, or popping off to the press
about strategy, but isn't that reasonable?
Unlike the man himself, some assistants
do yell at players. But compared to some of
Ralston's assistants, or what coaches at most
other schools do, even Hudson Houck is a
nice guy.
Christiansen isn't perfect, of course. His
strategy is wrong, sometimes. His relations
with alumni and media are frequently
strained, and, though he tries, he can't always
communicate with his players.
But all in all, he's done a pretty damn
good job. Just about everyone wanted to fire
Ralston in his sixth non-winning league
season, 1968. And it even took Dick Gould
six years to lead the tennis team to a league
crown.
Doesn't Jack Christiansen deserve at least
half that many years?

Answer to question 2 is that Stanford is
not only dead last in recruiting budgets
amont the Pac-8 schools, but spends only
about half as much as its nearest competitor,
USC. John McKay gets a lot of talent for
only $39,000, less than the six other teams
spend. Christiansen gets a similar amount of
talent, dollar for dollar, with a token
$20,000.
Coaching Ability
OK, before you think I'm grilling you like
Professor Horn, let's talk about the
quarterback situation and Chris' general
coaching ability.
Chris knows quarterbacks. Jim Plunkett
gives him a lot of credit for helping him
develop into a superstar.
At the beginning of this year, Chris was
convinced Mike Cordova was the best of the
three QB's having studied numerous films
and seeing practices. But rather than give
Mike the job, Chris decided to take another
look at all of them. He did, in the four
non-conference games, and caught hell for it.
The Pac-8 season began. Everyone
clamored for Chris to make a choice before
his switching around ruined our Rose Bowl
chances. He did. Maybe you don't think it
was the right choice, and maybe I don't
either.
But Chris gave them all chances, and then
started the one he thought best. Cordova's
showing Saturday gives evidence he may have
been right. I can't tell yet. But he's the

coach, and he made what he knew would be
an unpopular choice— without violating any
promises.
Public opinion polls are fun. Dick Nixon
used them to decide his strategy. Should we
expect our coaches to follow his lead?
Proven Ability
In general, the coaches' competence was
proven by last season's 7-4 record. With an
offense that bordered on the metaphysical,
Stanford still managed to beat every team it
could have been expected to, losing only to
four top-10 teams.
This year, things haven't been so good,
but the Cards have still beaten the point
spread their last three games. Point spreads
aren't wins, but bookies usually assess
potential pretty well.
Chris and his aides have made the most of
their players, with the exception of the
defensive linemen. And I'm confident Norb
Hecker, one of college football's best
assistants, will come in and straighten out
that particular mess.
Our Kind Of Guy
On to the final point, that Chris is the
type of man we want coaching our football
team. As Stanford students, we wouldn't like
coaches who slapped players around and
treated them like kids.
Chris doesn't. The quotes unearthed by
Gary Cavalli (see Friday's Daily) illustrate
this well.
Chris tells players like James Lofton that,
sure, if they want to go out for track instead
of spring football, go ahead. If Gordy Riegel
wants to go to Europe and he and several
other people want to play rugby and Gary
Anderson wrestles and gets hurt, Chris
doesn't scream. And if Jerry Waldvogel wants
to miss an occasional practice with a lab and
Forrie Martin can't make the game with
Hawaii because of schoolwork, that's OK
too.
Chris lets his players go tieless on road
trips and have long hair all the time. Sure, he
doesn't want players smoking cigarettes or
joints in his face, or popping off to the press
about strategy, but isn't that reasonable?
Unlike the man himself, some assistants
do yell at players. But compared to some of
Ralston's assistants, or what coaches at most
other schools do, even Hudson Houck is a
nice guy.
Christiansen isn't perfect, of course. His
strategy is wrong, sometimes. His relations
with alumni and media are frequently
strained, and, though he tries, he can't always
communicate with his players.
But all in all, he's done a pretty damn
good job. Just about everyone wanted to fire
Ralston in his sixth non-winning league
season, 1968. And it even took Dick Gould
six years to lead the tennis team to a league
crown.
Doesn't Jack Christiansen deserve at least
half that many years?


Jack Christiansen
So that you don't waste five minutes in
Prof. Chace and Kennedy's class reading
something with which you violently disagree,
I'll start with my conclusion: that Jack
Christiansen is about as good a football coach
as Stanford in 1974 could possibly have.
Coach Chris has a team that has blown a
couple games to be 1-3-2. For that reason
alone, he has been the target of the ire of
alumni, columnists and the Band, which as
always serves as the most clever
manifestation of Stanford student
skepticism.
But I think Chris is doing a good job. My
argument has three parts; that Chris inherited
a mess from which he still suffers; that he is a
good football coach, despite what the
quarterback situation might lead you to
believe; and that he is the type of man we
want coaching our school's football team.
Wilting Petals
When Christiansen took over after the
second Rose Bowl, he inherited little but
wilting petals. The team had lost 13 starters
from the year before. The 1971 freshman
squad was one of the poorest excuses for a
football team ever put on the field. In an era
when no freshmen could play varsity, the
team got killed week after week— 37-0 by
USC, 40-0 by Cal. v
So, whatever talent Chris has managed to
squeeze out of that year's class (this year's
seniors) he's done himself.
Players such as Jim Kaffen say the reason
Mike White (who was offered the Stanford
head job when John Ralston resigned) went
to Cal was that White thought the Bears had
a much, much better team.
So Ralston and White left, taking with
them four assistant coaches. The loss of six
men gave Christiansen practically no one to
help him recruit.
By the time he hastily put together a staff,
the recruiting season of 1972 was lost. Out of
that year comes this year's junior class. You
know how many juniors started last week?
Exactly one— Geb Church.
So Christiansen now has a group of seniors
he pieced together himself and a bunch of
j spirited, but not too talented, juniors. With
the material Stanford has now, I don't know
how anyone believed our publicity
! department when it mumbled about a Rose
Bowl. On paper, USC 2000, Stanford 0 seems
like a good prediction.
But despite the sympathetic "No" answer
Dean of Rejections Fred Hargadon keeps
giving Chris, he's put together good
back-to-back recruiting years. Let's wait till
his freshmen and sophomores grow up before
we knock Christiansen for wasting talent.
Before jumping to parts two and three,
here are two more questions.
1) In nine years of coaching, how many
times did Ralston have winning in conference
records?
2) Compared to other schools, what does

Stanford spend for recruiting?
Answer to question 1 is three years— 1969
through 1971. The rest of the time, Ralston
couldn't win, probably because he didn't get
talent into school, either.
Answer to question 2 is that Stanford is
not only dead last in recruiting budgets

Forrie Martin can't make the game with
Hawaii because of schoolwork, that's OK
too.
Chris lets his players go tieless on road
trips and have long hair all the time. Sure, he
doesn't want players smoking cigarettes or
joints in his face, or popping off to the press
about strategy, but isn't that reasonable?
Unlike the man himself, some assistants
do yell at players. But compared to some of
Ralston's assistants, or what coaches at most
other schools do, even Hudson Houck is a
nice guy.
Christiansen isn't perfect, of course. His
strategy is wrong, sometimes. His relations
with alumni and media are frequently
strained, and, though he tries, he can't always
communicate with his players.
But all in all, he's done a pretty damn
good job. Just about everyone wanted to fire
Ralston in his sixth non-winning league
season, 1968. And it even took Dick Gould
six years to lead the tennis team to a league
crown.
Doesn't Jack Christiansen deserve at least
half that many years?


Jack Christiansen
So that you don't waste five minutes in
Prof. Chace and Kennedy's class reading
something with which you violently disagree,
I'll start with my conclusion: that Jack
Christiansen is about as good a football coach
as Stanford in 1974 could possibly have.
Coach Chris has a team that has blown a
couple games to be 1-3-2. For that reason
alone, he has been the target of the ire of
alumni, columnists and the Band, which as
always serves as the most clever
manifestation of Stanford student
skepticism.
But I think Chris is doing a good job. My
argument has three parts; that Chris inherited
a mess from which he still suffers; that he is a
good football coach, despite what the
quarterback situation might lead you to
believe; and that he is the type of man we
want coaching our school's football team.
Wilting Petals
When Christiansen took over after the
second Rose Bowl, he inherited little but
wilting petals. The team had lost 13 starters
from the year before. The 1971 freshman
squad was one of the poorest excuses for a
football team ever put on the field. In an era
when no freshmen could play varsity, the
team got killed week after week— 37-0 by
USC, 40-0 by Cal. v
So, whatever talent Chris has managed to
squeeze out of that year's class (this year's
seniors) he's done himself.
Players such as Jim Kaffen say the reason
Mike White (who was offered the Stanford
head job when John Ralston resigned) went
to Cal was that White thought the Bears had
a much, much better team.
So Ralston and White left, taking with
them four assistant coaches. The loss of six
men gave Christiansen practically no one to
help him recruit.
By the time he hastily put together a staff,
the recruiting season of 1972 was lost. Out of
that year comes this year's junior class. You
know how many juniors started last week?
Exactly one— Geb Church.
So Christiansen now has a group of seniors
he pieced together himself and a bunch of
j spirited, but not too talented, juniors. With
the material Stanford has now, I don't know
how anyone believed our publicity
! department when it mumbled about a Rose
Bowl. On paper, USC 2000, Stanford 0 seems
like a good prediction.
But despite the sympathetic "No" answer
Dean of Rejections Fred Hargadon keeps
giving Chris, he's put together good
back-to-back recruiting years. Let's wait till
his freshmen and sophomores grow up before
we knock Christiansen for wasting talent.
Before jumping to parts two and three,
here are two more questions.
1) In nine years of coaching, how many
times did Ralston have winning in conference
records?
2) Compared to other schools, what does

Stanford spend for recruiting?
Answer to question 1 is three years— 1969
through 1971. The rest of the time, Ralston
couldn't win, probably because he didn't get
talent into school, either.
Answer to question 2 is that Stanford is
not only dead last in recruiting budgets
amont the Pac-8 schools, but spends only
about half as much as its nearest competitor,
USC. John McKay gets a lot of talent for
only $39,000, less than the six other teams
spend. Christiansen gets a similar amount of
talent, dollar for dollar, with a token
$20,000.
Coaching Ability
OK, before you think I'm grilling you like
Professor Horn, let's talk about the
quarterback situation and Chris' general
coaching ability.
Chris knows quarterbacks. Jim Plunkett
gives him a lot of credit for helping him
develop into a superstar.
At the beginning of this year, Chris was
convinced Mike Cordova was the best of the
three QB's having studied numerous films
and seeing practices. But rather than give
Mike the job, Chris decided to take another
look at all of them. He did, in the four
non-conference games, and caught hell for it.
The Pac-8 season began. Everyone
clamored for Chris to make a choice before
his switching around ruined our Rose Bowl
chances. He did. Maybe you don't think it
was the right choice, and maybe I don't
either.
But Chris gave them all chances, and then
started the one he thought best. Cordova's
showing Saturday gives evidence he may have
been right. I can't tell yet. But he's the

coach, and he made what he knew would be
an unpopular choice— without violating any
promises.
Public opinion polls are fun. Dick Nixon
used them to decide his strategy. Should we
expect our coaches to follow his lead?
Proven Ability
In general, the coaches' competence was
proven by last season's 7-4 record. With an
offense that bordered on the metaphysical,
Stanford still managed to beat every team it
could have been expected to, losing only to
four top-10 teams.
This year, things haven't been so good,
but the Cards have still beaten the point
spread their last three games. Point spreads
aren't wins, but bookies usually assess
potential pretty well.
Chris and his aides have made the most of
their players, with the exception of the
defensive linemen. And I'm confident Norb
Hecker, one of college football's best
assistants, will come in and straighten out
that particular mess.
Our Kind Of Guy
On to the final point, that Chris is the
type of man we want coaching our football
team. As Stanford students, we wouldn't like
coaches who slapped players around and
treated them like kids.
Chris doesn't. The quotes unearthed by
Gary Cavalli (see Friday's Daily) illustrate
this well.
Chris tells players like James Lofton that,
sure, if they want to go out for track instead
of spring football, go ahead. If Gordy Riegel
wants to go to Europe and he and several
other people want to play rugby and Gary
Anderson wrestles and gets hurt, Chris
doesn't scream. And if Jerry Waldvogel wants
to miss an occasional practice with a lab and
Forrie Martin can't make the game with
Hawaii because of schoolwork, that's OK
too.
Chris lets his players go tieless on road

Exactly one— Geb Church.
So Christiansen now has a group of seniors
he pieced together himself and a bunch of
j spirited, but not too talented, juniors. With
the material Stanford has now, I don't know
how anyone believed our publicity
! department when it mumbled about a Rose
Bowl. On paper, USC 2000, Stanford 0 seems
like a good prediction.
But despite the sympathetic "No" answer
Dean of Rejections Fred Hargadon keeps
giving Chris, he's put together good
back-to-back recruiting years. Let's wait till
his freshmen and sophomores grow up before
we knock Christiansen for wasting talent.
Before jumping to parts two and three,
here are two more questions.
1) In nine years of coaching, how many
times did Ralston have winning in conference
records?
2) Compared to other schools, what does

Stanford spend for recruiting?
Answer to question 1 is three years— 1969
through 1971. The rest of the time, Ralston
couldn't win, probably because he didn't get
talent into school, either.
Answer to question 2 is that Stanford is
not only dead last in recruiting budgets
amont the Pac-8 schools, but spends only
about half as much as its nearest competitor,
USC. John McKay gets a lot of talent for
only $39,000, less than the six other teams
spend. Christiansen gets a similar amount of
talent, dollar for dollar, with a token
$20,000.
Coaching Ability
OK, before you think I'm grilling you like
Professor Horn, let's talk about the
quarterback situation and Chris' general
coaching ability.
Chris knows quarterbacks. Jim Plunkett
gives him a lot of credit for helping him
develop into a superstar.
At the beginning of this year, Chris was
convinced Mike Cordova was the best of the
three QB's having studied numerous films
and seeing practices. But rather than give
Mike the job, Chris decided to take another
look at all of them. He did, in the four
non-conference games, and caught hell for it.
The Pac-8 season began. Everyone
clamored for Chris to make a choice before
his switching around ruined our Rose Bowl
chances. He did. Maybe you don't think it
was the right choice, and maybe I don't
either.
But Chris gave them all chances, and then
started the one he thought best. Cordova's
showing Saturday gives evidence he may have
been right. I can't tell yet. But he's the

coach, and he made what he knew would be
an unpopular choice— without violating any
promises.
Public opinion polls are fun. Dick Nixon
used them to decide his strategy. Should we
expect our coaches to follow his lead?
Proven Ability
In general, the coaches' competence was
proven by last season's 7-4 record. With an
offense that bordered on the metaphysical,
Stanford still managed to beat every team it
could have been expected to, losing only to
four top-10 teams.
This year, things haven't been so good,
but the Cards have still beaten the point
spread their last three games. Point spreads
aren't wins, but bookies usually assess
potential pretty well.
Chris and his aides have made the most of
their players, with the exception of the
defensive linemen. And I'm confident Norb
Hecker, one of college football's best
assistants, will come in and straighten out
that particular mess.
Our Kind Of Guy
On to the final point, that Chris is the
type of man we want coaching our football
team. As Stanford students, we wouldn't like
coaches who slapped players around and
treated them like kids.
Chris doesn't. The quotes unearthed by
Gary Cavalli (see Friday's Daily) illustrate
this well.
Chris tells players like James Lofton that,
sure, if they want to go out for track instead
of spring football, go ahead. If Gordy Riegel
wants to go to Europe and he and several
other people want to play rugby and Gary
Anderson wrestles and gets hurt, Chris
doesn't scream. And if Jerry Waldvogel wants
to miss an occasional practice with a lab and
Forrie Martin can't make the game with
Hawaii because of schoolwork, that's OK
too.
Chris lets his players go tieless on road
trips and have long hair all the time. Sure, he
doesn't want players smoking cigarettes or
joints in his face, or popping off to the press
about strategy, but isn't that reasonable?
Unlike the man himself, some assistants
do yell at players. But compared to some of
Ralston's assistants, or what coaches at most
other schools do, even Hudson Houck is a
nice guy.
Christiansen isn't perfect, of course. His
strategy is wrong, sometimes. His relations
with alumni and media are frequently
strained, and, though he tries, he can't always
communicate with his players.
But all in all, he's done a pretty damn
good job. Just about everyone wanted to fire
Ralston in his sixth non-winning league
season, 1968. And it even took Dick Gould
six years to lead the tennis team to a league
crown.
Doesn't Jack Christiansen deserve at least
half that many years?


Jack Christiansen
So that you don't waste five minutes in
Prof. Chace and Kennedy's class reading
something with which you violently disagree,
I'll start with my conclusion: that Jack
Christiansen is about as good a football coach
as Stanford in 1974 could possibly have.
Coach Chris has a team that has blown a
couple games to be 1-3-2. For that reason
alone, he has been the target of the ire of
alumni, columnists and the Band, which as
always serves as the most clever
manifestation of Stanford student
skepticism.
But I think Chris is doing a good job. My
argument has three parts; that Chris inherited
a mess from which he still suffers; that he is a
good football coach, despite what the
quarterback situation might lead you to
believe; and that he is the type of man we
want coaching our school's football team.
Wilting Petals
When Christiansen took over after the
second Rose Bowl, he inherited little but
wilting petals. The team had lost 13 starters
from the year before. The 1971 freshman
squad was one of the poorest excuses for a
football team ever put on the field. In an era
when no freshmen could play varsity, the
team got killed week after week— 37-0 by
USC, 40-0 by Cal. v
So, whatever talent Chris has managed to
squeeze out of that year's class (this year's
seniors) he's done himself.
Players such as Jim Kaffen say the reason
Mike White (who was offered the Stanford
head job when John Ralston resigned) went
to Cal was that White thought the Bears had
a much, much better team.
So Ralston and White left, taking with
them four assistant coaches. The loss of six
men gave Christiansen practically no one to
help him recruit.
By the time he hastily put together a staff,
the recruiting season of 1972 was lost. Out of
that year comes this year's junior class. You
know how many juniors started last week?
Exactly one— Geb Church.
So Christiansen now has a group of seniors
he pieced together himself and a bunch of
j spirited, but not too talented, juniors. With
the material Stanford has now, I don't know
how anyone believed our publicity
