# Cardinals To Practice In S.F. Park
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Most Bay Area sports fans
think Candlestick Park isn't good
for anything.
But Stanford has found a use
for the astroturf icebox. The
Cardinal football team plans to
practice there tomorrow, in order
to prepare for Saturday's game on
the freezing artificial surface of
Clarence D. Martin Stadium in

Pullman, Wash.
The Cards are doing everything
possible to ensure they come out
of the Washington State game
with their championship hopes
intact. While the Cougars are only
1-5 on the year, their narrow
17-13 loss to UCLA last Saturday
has to make Stanford fans worry.
Card coach Jack Christiansen
did have one piece of good news
yesterday at the Northern
California Football Writers'
Luncheon as the team prepares
for the game in the Palouse. His
team is in fairly good physical
condition, probably as good as
could be expected after six games.
Only defensive back Rich
Waters is listed as "doubtful" for
the game. Waters sprained his
ankle Saturday. If Waters can't
play, freshman John Pigott will
make the trip in his place.
Running back Ron Inge is
expected to make it, after being
held out of last week's game with
a slight shoulder Separation. He's
listed behind Sig Ostrom, who had
his best game of the year
Saturday.
Washington State is apparently
in worse shape than Stanford. In
particular, the Cougars are hurt by
the loss of fullback Andrew Jones
for the season, Jones, who
suffered a shoulder separation
more serious than that of Inge last
Saturday, may miss the rest of the
season.
WSU's two outstanding
offensive linemen, center Geoff
Reece and guard Steve
Ostermann, have both been
injured this year, but will play
Saturday.
Reece is called "one of the best
centers in the country, and many
rank him as the best," by his
coach, Jim Sweeney. Early in the
year, he broke his right hand, so
learned to snap with his left. Now
he's back snapping on the
starboard side again.
WSU's defense ranks last in the
Pacific Eight, but has been tough
against the pass, ranking third in
the league, so Mike Cordova will
have a tough test. Cordova was
named Pac-8 offensive player of
the week yesterday.

Luncheon as the team prepares
for the game in the Palouse. His
team is in fairly good physical
condition, probably as good as
could be expected after six games.
Only defensive back Rich
Waters is listed as "doubtful" for
the game. Waters sprained his
ankle Saturday. If Waters can't
play, freshman John Pigott will
make the trip in his place.
Running back Ron Inge is
expected to make it, after being
held out of last week's game with
a slight shoulder Separation. He's
listed behind Sig Ostrom, who had
his best game of the year
Saturday.
Washington State is apparently
in worse shape than Stanford. In
particular, the Cougars are hurt by
the loss of fullback Andrew Jones
for the season, Jones, who
suffered a shoulder separation
more serious than that of Inge last
Saturday, may miss the rest of the
season.
WSU's two outstanding
offensive linemen, center Geoff
Reece and guard Steve
Ostermann, have both been
injured this year, but will play
Saturday.
Reece is called "one of the best
centers in the country, and many
rank him as the best," by his
coach, Jim Sweeney. Early in the
year, he broke his right hand, so
learned to snap with his left. Now
he's back snapping on the
starboard side again.
WSU's defense ranks last in the
Pacific Eight, but has been tough
against the pass, ranking third in
the league, so Mike Cordova will
have a tough test. Cordova was
named Pac-8 offensive player of
the week yesterday.

Most Bay Area sports fans
think Candlestick Park isn't good
for anything.
But Stanford has found a use
for the astroturf icebox. The
Cardinal football team plans to
practice there tomorrow, in order
to prepare for Saturday's game on
the freezing artificial surface of
Clarence D. Martin Stadium in

Pullman, Wash.
The Cards are doing everything
possible to ensure they come out
of the Washington State game
with their championship hopes
intact. While the Cougars are only
1-5 on the year, their narrow
17-13 loss to UCLA last Saturday
has to make Stanford fans worry.
Card coach Jack Christiansen
did have one piece of good news

California Football Writers'
Luncheon as the team prepares
