# Democrats Respond To Ford
## 'Sacrifices Must Be Shared' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Speaking
for Congressional Democrats, Sen.
Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine) urged
President Ford last night to use his
"jawboning" powers to dampen wage
and price increases.
If jawboning and other bargaining
efforts fail, Muskie said, "mandatory
action must bfe taken."
Muskie also said that business must
share the sacrifices required to fight
inflation and boost the economy.
In a speech prepared for broadcast
on NBC-TV in response to Ford's
address to a Future Farmers of
America convention last week, Muskie
said:
"If the President wants Americans
to eat less, drive less and demand less,
he should be prepared to ask some of
them to charge less."
Inflationary Surge
His speech came a few hours after

the government reported that rising
prices for food, clothing and mortgage
rates pushed the cost of living up
another 1.2 percent in September,
making the last 12 months the worst
inflationary surge since 1947. Prices in
September were reported 12.1 percent
higher than a year earlier.
Muskie, chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee, said Ford should
do some hard bargaining "to
dampen price and wage increases that
are about to occur."
The roll-back on automobile price
increases was a small but worthy
start," he said, referring to Ford's
criticism that proceeded General
Motors' reduction of its 1975 price
hikes.
Loosen Money
Muskie urged the Federal Reserve
Board to ease its tight-money policy so
as to assure a flow of credit at

reasonable rates to the housing
industry and small business.
Instead of Ford's proposed five
percent tax surcharge on middle and
upper-middle and upper-income
Americans, Muskie suggested increases
in the minimum tax law, to make sure
everybody pays a share of the tax
burden.
"There is no economic justification
for taxing the buying power of middle
Americans at a time when we are in a
serious national recession," he added.
Payroll Tax Cut
The senator said a temporary cut in
payroll taxes would increase the
buying power of Americans and
reduce the incentive of labor unions to
press for ever-higher wage settlements.
And Muskie called on Ford to spell
out before the Nov. 5 election just
what federal budget cuts he has in
mind.
