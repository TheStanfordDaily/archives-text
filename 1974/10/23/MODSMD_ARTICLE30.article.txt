Dean Reveals Cover-Up Activity
WASHINGTON John W. Dean 111 testified yesterday he shredded two
notebooks needed for the original Watergate break-in trial to cover up White
House involvement in the burglary of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
While the disclosure about the notebooks was not new, Dean said for the first
time that he knew about the burglary in April or May 1972, nearly a year
before President Nixon said he learned of it.
Dean said he destroyed the notebooks, "conscious I was destroying material
relating to another problem in the White House."
And he admitted helping raise money for the defendants in the Watergate
break-in "in order to keep the mouth of these people shut." It was done, Dean
said, with the assent of John D. Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman, Nixon's top
aides.
Ehrlichman and Haldeman, along with former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell,
Robert C. Mardian and Kenneth W. Parkinson, are defendants in the trial,
charged with conspiring to obstruct justice.
After five days on the witness stand, testifying emotionlessly against his
former colleagues Dean was questioned for the first time by the defense lawyers.
The prosecution finished with Dean by playing the sixth White House tape of
the trial a conversation between Dean and Nixon on April 16,1973, when the
Watergate scandal neared the breaking point.
Giants Swap Bonds; Rams Trade Hadl
NEW YORK Three National Football League quarterbacks and two major
league baseball outfielders were traded yesterday in a series of surprising
professional sports transactions.
Baseball's inter-league trading period got off to an impressive start when the
New York Yankees sent Bobby Murcer to the San Francisco Giants for Bobby
Bonds in an exchange of two of the game's biggest stars.
The two outfielders, both perennial All-Stars, went in a one-for-one swap
negotiated during the playoffs and World Series.
John Hadl, All-Pro quarterback of the Los Angeles Rams, was traded to the
Green Bay Packers for five National Football League draft choices, including
first-round choices in 1975 and 1976. The New York Giants acquired
quarterback Craig Morton from Dallas and sent quarterback Norm Snead to the
San Francisco 49ers.
In exchange for Morton, the Giants surrendered their No. 1 draft choice for
1975 to Dallas. New York received two high draft choices, one for 1975 and the
other for 1976, from the 49ers in exchange for Snead.
Inflation Surges As Retail Prices Rise
WASHINGTON Inflation surged ahead in September as retail prices rose
another 1.2 percent, the Labor Department reported yesterday.
The increase pushed consumer prices 12.1 percent higher than a year earlier,
the sharpest increase in any 12-month period since 1947.
Retail prices increased across most of the economy last month with food,
clothing and mortgage interest rates leading the way. A few items declined,
notably gasoline and fresh fruits and vegetables.
President Ford's economic advisers have predicted that retail prices will
continue rising at a rate of about one percent a month through the end of the
year, and that there would be no significant easing of inflation until sometime
next year.
The year already is destined to go down as the worst peacetime inflationary
year on record. Retail prices have climbed 9.7 percent so far this year, surpassing
last year's rise of 8.8 percent, which was the worst since 1947.
Campaign Contributions Down From '72 Level
WASHINGTON Incumbent officeholders are raising three times as much
money as their challengers this year, but total contributions to congressional
candidates are lower than in 1972, Common Cause reported yesterday.
The lobby also said it found such special interest groups as labor unions and
business organizations were playing a much larger financial role than they did
two years ago.
In a study of candidates' campaign spending reports, Common Cause said
that Democratic candidates for contested seats including incumbents and
non-incumbents had received more than $22 million by .Sept. 1. Their
Republican opponents had been given slightly more than $l6 million. That was a
reversal of the 1972 pattern, when Republican led Democrats.
The organization said the change was an effect of Watergate.
Doctors Nearing Elimination Of Smallpox
NEW DELHI, India Doctors directing a massive war on smallpox -say they
are nearing a final victory that would wipe the disease from the earth.
An international campaign to track down the scourge and halt its spread has
drastically reduced the number of cases in India and the three other
countries—Ethiopia, Pakistan and Bangladesh still afflicted by the ancient and
deadly disease.
The dros has been so dramatic over the last three months and the remaining
pockets of infection so reduced that specialists predict they can eliminate the
disease altogether by early next year. ',
Once gone, smallpox would be unlikely to return, since it can be
communicated only by human beings. Health authorities say such a victory
would mark the first time a widespread disease has been eradicated from the
world.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except fog and low clouds near the coast extending
inland night and mornings. Little temperature change. Lows tonight in upper 40s
to low 50s. Highs both days in the 60s near the coast to the 70s inland. Westerly

negotiated during the playoffs and World Series.
John Hadl, All-Pro quarterback of the Los Angeles Rams, was traded to the
Green Bay Packers for five National Football League draft choices, including
first-round choices in 1975 and 1976. The New York Giants acquired
quarterback Craig Morton from Dallas and sent quarterback Norm Snead to the
San Francisco 49ers.
In exchange for Morton, the Giants surrendered their No. 1 draft choice for
1975 to Dallas. New York received two high draft choices, one for 1975 and the
other for 1976, from the 49ers in exchange for Snead.
Inflation Surges As Retail Prices Rise
WASHINGTON Inflation surged ahead in September as retail prices rose
another 1.2 percent, the Labor Department reported yesterday.
The increase pushed consumer prices 12.1 percent higher than a year earlier,
the sharpest increase in any 12-month period since 1947.
Retail prices increased across most of the economy last month with food,
clothing and mortgage interest rates leading the way. A few items declined,
notably gasoline and fresh fruits and vegetables.
President Ford's economic advisers have predicted that retail prices will
continue rising at a rate of about one percent a month through the end of the
year, and that there would be no significant easing of inflation until sometime
next year.
The year already is destined to go down as the worst peacetime inflationary
year on record. Retail prices have climbed 9.7 percent so far this year, surpassing
last year's rise of 8.8 percent, which was the worst since 1947.
Campaign Contributions Down From '72 Level
WASHINGTON Incumbent officeholders are raising three times as much
money as their challengers this year, but total contributions to congressional
candidates are lower than in 1972, Common Cause reported yesterday.
The lobby also said it found such special interest groups as labor unions and
business organizations were playing a much larger financial role than they did
two years ago.
In a study of candidates' campaign spending reports, Common Cause said
that Democratic candidates for contested seats including incumbents and
non-incumbents had received more than $22 million by .Sept. 1. Their
Republican opponents had been given slightly more than $l6 million. That was a
reversal of the 1972 pattern, when Republican led Democrats.
The organization said the change was an effect of Watergate.
Doctors Nearing Elimination Of Smallpox
NEW DELHI, India Doctors directing a massive war on smallpox -say they
are nearing a final victory that would wipe the disease from the earth.
An international campaign to track down the scourge and halt its spread has
drastically reduced the number of cases in India and the three other
countries—Ethiopia, Pakistan and Bangladesh still afflicted by the ancient and
deadly disease.
The dros has been so dramatic over the last three months and the remaining
pockets of infection so reduced that specialists predict they can eliminate the
disease altogether by early next year. ',
Once gone, smallpox would be unlikely to return, since it can be
communicated only by human beings. Health authorities say such a victory
would mark the first time a widespread disease has been eradicated from the
world.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except fog and low clouds near the coast extending
inland night and mornings. Little temperature change. Lows tonight in upper 40s

Dean Reveals Cover-Up Activity
WASHINGTON John W. Dean 111 testified yesterday he shredded two
notebooks needed for the original Watergate break-in trial to cover up White
House involvement in the burglary of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
While the disclosure about the notebooks was not new, Dean said for the first
time that he knew about the burglary in April or May 1972, nearly a year
before President Nixon said he learned of it.
Dean said he destroyed the notebooks, "conscious I was destroying material
relating to another problem in the White House."
And he admitted helping raise money for the defendants in the Watergate
break-in "in order to keep the mouth of these people shut." It was done, Dean
said, with the assent of John D. Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman, Nixon's top
aides.
Ehrlichman and Haldeman, along with former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell,
Robert C. Mardian and Kenneth W. Parkinson, are defendants in the trial,
charged with conspiring to obstruct justice.
After five days on the witness stand, testifying emotionlessly against his
former colleagues Dean was questioned for the first time by the defense lawyers.
The prosecution finished with Dean by playing the sixth White House tape of
the trial a conversation between Dean and Nixon on April 16,1973, when the
Watergate scandal neared the breaking point.

money as their challengers this year, but total contributions to congressional
candidates are lower than in 1972, Common Cause reported yesterday.
The lobby also said it found such special interest groups as labor unions and
business organizations were playing a much larger financial role than they did
two years ago.
In a study of candidates' campaign spending reports, Common Cause said
that Democratic candidates for contested seats including incumbents and
non-incumbents had received more than $22 million by .Sept. 1. Their
Republican opponents had been given slightly more than $l6 million. That was a
reversal of the 1972 pattern, when Republican led Democrats.
The organization said the change was an effect of Watergate.
Doctors Nearing Elimination Of Smallpox
NEW DELHI, India Doctors directing a massive war on smallpox -say they
are nearing a final victory that would wipe the disease from the earth.
An international campaign to track down the scourge and halt its spread has
drastically reduced the number of cases in India and the three other
countries—Ethiopia, Pakistan and Bangladesh still afflicted by the ancient and
deadly disease.
The dros has been so dramatic over the last three months and the remaining
pockets of infection so reduced that specialists predict they can eliminate the
disease altogether by early next year. ',
Once gone, smallpox would be unlikely to return, since it can be
communicated only by human beings. Health authorities say such a victory
would mark the first time a widespread disease has been eradicated from the
world.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except fog and low clouds near the coast extending
inland night and mornings. Little temperature change. Lows tonight in upper 40s
to low 50s. Highs both days in the 60s near the coast to the 70s inland. Westerly

Dean Reveals Cover-Up Activity
WASHINGTON John W. Dean 111 testified yesterday he shredded two
notebooks needed for the original Watergate break-in trial to cover up White
House involvement in the burglary of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
While the disclosure about the notebooks was not new, Dean said for the first
time that he knew about the burglary in April or May 1972, nearly a year
before President Nixon said he learned of it.
Dean said he destroyed the notebooks, "conscious I was destroying material
relating to another problem in the White House."
And he admitted helping raise money for the defendants in the Watergate
break-in "in order to keep the mouth of these people shut." It was done, Dean
said, with the assent of John D. Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman, Nixon's top
aides.
Ehrlichman and Haldeman, along with former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell,
Robert C. Mardian and Kenneth W. Parkinson, are defendants in the trial,
charged with conspiring to obstruct justice.
After five days on the witness stand, testifying emotionlessly against his
former colleagues Dean was questioned for the first time by the defense lawyers.
The prosecution finished with Dean by playing the sixth White House tape of
the trial a conversation between Dean and Nixon on April 16,1973, when the
Watergate scandal neared the breaking point.
Giants Swap Bonds; Rams Trade Hadl
NEW YORK Three National Football League quarterbacks and two major
league baseball outfielders were traded yesterday in a series of surprising
professional sports transactions.
Baseball's inter-league trading period got off to an impressive start when the
New York Yankees sent Bobby Murcer to the San Francisco Giants for Bobby
Bonds in an exchange of two of the game's biggest stars.
The two outfielders, both perennial All-Stars, went in a one-for-one swap
negotiated during the playoffs and World Series.
John Hadl, All-Pro quarterback of the Los Angeles Rams, was traded to the
Green Bay Packers for five National Football League draft choices, including
first-round choices in 1975 and 1976. The New York Giants acquired
quarterback Craig Morton from Dallas and sent quarterback Norm Snead to the
San Francisco 49ers.
In exchange for Morton, the Giants surrendered their No. 1 draft choice for
1975 to Dallas. New York received two high draft choices, one for 1975 and the
other for 1976, from the 49ers in exchange for Snead.
Inflation Surges As Retail Prices Rise
WASHINGTON Inflation surged ahead in September as retail prices rose
another 1.2 percent, the Labor Department reported yesterday.
The increase pushed consumer prices 12.1 percent higher than a year earlier,
the sharpest increase in any 12-month period since 1947.
Retail prices increased across most of the economy last month with food,
clothing and mortgage interest rates leading the way. A few items declined,
notably gasoline and fresh fruits and vegetables.
President Ford's economic advisers have predicted that retail prices will
continue rising at a rate of about one percent a month through the end of the
year, and that there would be no significant easing of inflation until sometime
next year.
The year already is destined to go down as the worst peacetime inflationary
year on record. Retail prices have climbed 9.7 percent so far this year, surpassing
last year's rise of 8.8 percent, which was the worst since 1947.
