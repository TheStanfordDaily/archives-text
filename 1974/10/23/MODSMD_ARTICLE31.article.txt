# Horton Says Housing Funds Short
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Fund-raising priorities in the $3OO
million Campaign for Stanford don't
reflect the current campus housing
shortage and Larry Horton,
associate dean of student affairs,
admitted yesterday he hasn't done
anything about it.
Questioned on KZSU's Campus
Conference , Horton said he recognized
the necessity of reevaluating priorities
set down by the Board of Trustees for
the University's five-year fund-raising
effort. But he admitted he has "not
personally talked to anyone" about
diverting more of that $3OO million to
student housing construction.
Plans for a $2O million library still
hold priority over housing, Horton
said. He noted that only $3 million of

the Campaign goal has been earmarked
for housing, although construction of
three new Row houses and a 700-unit
housing complex near Lagunita will
cost the University an estimated $25
million.
When the campaign was organized,
there was no apparent need for more
housing, Horton said.
Draw Dilemma
He also fielded questions on the
housing draw controversy.
Horton reiterated President Richard
W. Lyman's previous statement that
the University is not engaging in
"collective bargaining" with the
fraternities.
Horton said he eventually hopes to
devise a housing system that will
please everyone students, faculty,

staff and administration.
No Preference
Horton discussed several proposed
housing systems but said he has no
preference for one system over
another.
"I don't think I can really make
that judgement yet," he said.
Horton said he will not opt for a
housing system which "increases
discrimination in one sector so that
another sector benefits."
He said some of the proposed
systems have faults. Bringing back
sororities to campus would force a
reversal of the 1944 Board of Trustees
decision to ban sororities from
Stanford, he said.
Discrimination Ban
Horton consistently has opposed

sororities on the grounds that they
violate a proposed regulation of Title
IX of the federal Education
Admendments Act of 1972. That
provision states that a university
cannot receive federal funds if it assists
an organization which discriminates on
the basis of sex.
During the radio interview,
however, Horton said the University
should be more concerned with the
question, "what sort of residential
organization do we want at Stanford?
and less concerned with Title IX.
Equal access to campus housing
should be a "primary consideration,"
Horton said.
Horton also said there was a
possibility a decision on a new housing
system would not be announced until
next year, although he said it was
more likely the decision would be
made this year.

Horton also said there was a
possibility a decision on a new housing
system would not be announced until

Fund-raising priorities in the $3OO
million Campaign for Stanford don't
reflect the current campus housing
shortage and Larry Horton,
associate dean of student affairs,
admitted yesterday he hasn't done
anything about it.
Questioned on KZSU's Campus
Conference , Horton said he recognized
the necessity of reevaluating priorities
set down by the Board of Trustees for
the University's five-year fund-raising
effort. But he admitted he has "not
personally talked to anyone" about
diverting more of that $3OO million to
student housing construction.
Plans for a $2O million library still
hold priority over housing, Horton
said. He noted that only $3 million of

the Campaign goal has been earmarked
for housing, although construction of
three new Row houses and a 700-unit
housing complex near Lagunita will
cost the University an estimated $25
million.
When the campaign was organized,
there was no apparent need for more
housing, Horton said.
Draw Dilemma
He also fielded questions on the
housing draw controversy.
Horton reiterated President Richard
W. Lyman's previous statement that
the University is not engaging in
"collective bargaining" with the
fraternities.
Horton said he eventually hopes to
devise a housing system that will
please everyone students, faculty,

staff and administration.
No Preference
Horton discussed several proposed
housing systems but said he has no
preference for one system over
another.
"I don't think I can really make
that judgement yet," he said.
Horton said he will not opt for a
housing system which "increases
discrimination in one sector so that
another sector benefits."
He said some of the proposed
systems have faults. Bringing back
sororities to campus would force a
reversal of the 1944 Board of Trustees
decision to ban sororities from
Stanford, he said.
Discrimination Ban
Horton consistently has opposed

sororities on the grounds that they
violate a proposed regulation of Title
IX of the federal Education
Admendments Act of 1972. That
provision states that a university
cannot receive federal funds if it assists
an organization which discriminates on
the basis of sex.
During the radio interview,
however, Horton said the University
should be more concerned with the
question, "what sort of residential
organization do we want at Stanford?
and less concerned with Title IX.
Equal access to campus housing
should be a "primary consideration,"
Horton said.
Horton also said there was a
possibility a decision on a new housing
system would not be announced until
next year, although he said it was
more likely the decision would be
made this year.
