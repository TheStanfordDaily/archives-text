Drake To Lecture On Africa
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake
will discuss "Political and Historical
Linkages between Africa and Black
Diaspora" tonight at 7 p.m. in the
Olivo-Magnolia Lounge. The talk is
part of the Black Student Cultural
Center Lecture Series.
CORRECTION
In yesterday's Daily, several
remarks attributed to Publications
Board Chairman Rich Jaroslovsky
were incorrectly reported. Jaroslovsky
said in a letter to the Daily last week
that the Pub Board has been asked to
decide who ought to have control of
the Chaparral, not what publications
should have the use of its office space.
In addition, he said, the Board's vote
that the Chaparral has ceased to
publish is "irrelevant" to the situation.
