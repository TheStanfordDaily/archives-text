# Police Release Composite Picture Of Kidnap Suspect
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Police yesterday released a
composite picture of the man they say
kidnaped the wife of a Stanford
employee on campus Sunday night
and assaulted her.
The suspect was described as a
white male, about 30 years old,
5-foot-10, weighing about 170 pounds
and a stocky build. He has an olive
complexion, unusually large pores and
was last seen wearing jeans and a plaid
shirt.
Meanwhile, police flatly denied a
television report that the suspect has
been linked to three unsolved campus
murders, including the stabbing death
of Arlis Perry in Memorial Church a
week and a half ago.
Stanford Police Lt. Walt Konar said
the investigators "would sure like to
talk to the guy," but there is no
evidence that the assault is linked to
the murders. "We just can't rule
anything out yet," he said.
San Francisco station KPIX made
the report on its 7 p.m. newscast
yesterday.
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's
office identified the victim of the
Sunday night assault as Judy Adams,
29, the wife of Terence Adams of the
University's personnel department.
The name was not immediately
released by authorities, but was
reported by several local television
stations yesterday.
The suspect apparently forced his
way into her car while she was stopped
at the intersection of Bowdoin and

Pine Hill streets on campus about 8
p.m. Sunday.
He forced Mrs. Adams to drive into
the foothills behind campus, and later
fled on foot. The woman was not
raped, police said.
She was found by passers-by and
taken to Stanford Hospital, where she
was treated for shock and released.
Konar said police are seeking
information on Mrs. Adams' assailant,
and asked that anyone who might have
seen the suspect, or who might have
any other information concerning
either the assault or the murders
contact him at 497-3444. He said all
information would be followed up.
Konar also suggested that anyone
reluctant to contact the police directly
can contact the Daily at 497-4632.
