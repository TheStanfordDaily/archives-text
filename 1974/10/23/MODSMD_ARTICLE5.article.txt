# Eagleton Faces Conservative Challenge
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON News Analysis 
Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton has been campaigning
confidently in Missouri this fall. In fact he's been almost
cocky, dismissing as inconsequential most charges made by
his Republican opponent, former Congressman Thomas B.
Curtis.
"I just let my record speak for itself," says Eagleton,
seeking his second term in the Senate after a short-lived
vice-presidential bid in 1972. "I don't pay much attention
to Mr. Curtis."
But Eagleton, who currently holds a significant lead over
Curtis in polls conducted by both parties, may be secretly
worried about several questions as the campaign enters its
final weeks.

This is the first time Eagleton has run in a
non-presidential election year, and his opponent's analysis
of voting patterns shows that in such years the rural vote,
where Curtis is strongest, is up, and the urban vote, where
Eagleton is strongest, is down.
The Republicans also point out that Missouri voters may
have shifted considerably to the right since Eagleton
narrowly defeated Curtis in the 1968 Senate race. "The
major difference in this campaign and the last," says Curtis,
is that now "I can go up to people and say I'm a
conservative and get a favorable reaction."
But the most intriguing and possible most significant
question involves the impact of Eagleton's 1972 disclosure

that he underwent psychiatric counseling and shock
treatments in the early '6os.
Initially, Curtis promised not to bring up Eagleton's
mental health problems as a campaign issue. He told the
Daily in late August that psychiatric treatment is irrelevant
in a Senate campaign.
"I didn't make an issue out of it in 1968 when it was
just rumors, and I'm not making an issue out of it now,"
Curtis said. "It doesn't really have a bearing on a person in
a deliberative body there are a lot of kooks in the Senate
who do a fine job."
Position Reversed
But Curtis has reversed his position in recent weeks,
insisting that Eagleton make his medical records public. By
not releasing the records, Curtis charged, Eagleton "has
encouraged a sympathy vote to develop based upon . ..
[the] assumption that the illness was not one which was
liable to recur."
Eagleton has remained opposed to full disclosure of his
medical records, although he admits that his removal from
the Democratic ticket in 1972 may have aroused some
sympathy among Missourians.
"Politically, it's been a blessing in disguise," Eagleton
said. "I have an enormous amount of name and face
recognition that I didn't have before. Quite frankly,
because McGovern is so unpopular in Missouri, the fact that
I was dumped from his ticket has helped me."
Eagleton insists, however, that he isn't actively soliciting
the sympathy vote. "I'm not making any special play," he
said, "but I'm living, I'm campaigning. I can't just go hide."
Curtis charges that Eagleton has been hiding "his
extreme liberal image from the public now that election

time is near."
Curtis is fond of pointing out that Eagleton's voting
record, as measured by the liberal Americans For
Democratic Action (ADA) and the AFL-CIO Committee on
Political Education (COPE), is one of the highest liberal
ratings of any senator in the nation even higher than Sen.
George McGovern's (D-S.D.).
"Eagleton's voting record in the Senate," concludes a
Curtis campaign brochure, "is one of extreme liberalism,
reflecting his advocacy of big government bureaucracy and
big government spending, making him directly responsible
for our horrendous inflation and the burgeoning increase in
federal control over our lives."
Curtis, who served 18 years in the House of
Representatives before running against Eagleton in 1968,
promises a policy of fiscal responsibility and reduced
government spending. "Every item on the budget should be
scrutinized," he said, adding that "some programs even
good programs will have to be put on the shelf until we
can afford them."
Power Plays
The power of the federal government should be used
"sparingly and carefully," he said. "The error of liberals is
that they think all programs have to be initiated through
the federal government.
"But you can accomplish the most in our society
through the private efforts of individuals... If you're
trying to solve a social problem, you don't go to the federal
government first."
Eagleton, who called Curtis "The Abominable No-man"
in 1968 for his negative voting record in Congress, argues
that "social problems simply can't all be solved through
private philanthropy."
And despite many votes in favor of expensive social

programs, Eagleton maintains that he is far from a reckless
spender.
Budget Moves
He boasts that he offered more amendments to cut the
budget than any other senator on the Appropriations
Committee, and also emphasizes his approval of a $lO
billion federal budget cut, trimming primarily from defense,
foreign aid, space, public works and interior.
Still, Eagleton seems to be moving slightly to the right.
Last week he said he could support Alabama Gov. George
Wallace if Wallace were the Democratic presidential or
vice-presidential nominee in 1976. And he favors only
"conditional amnesty" for draft evaders.
Eagleton's moderate positions may have developed from
a fear that Missouri voters are in fact leaning toward more
conservative stands a potentially disastrous situation for
Eagleton if there are as many undecided voters as Curtis
predicts.
Conservative Mistakes
Curtis, though, has his own reservations. While
hammering away at his conservative philosophy, he admits
that "my biggest problem are my allies. Most conservatives
are stupid. They won't do their homework and that's why
they're always losing arguments to the liberal intellectuals."
Curtis has definitely done his homework, but it remains
to be seen whether he can overtake the more charismatic
Eagleton by Nov. 5. He is being considerably outspent by
Eagleton, and it seems unlikely that a late comeback can be
successful without massive media exposure.
Curtis, though, refuses to acknowledge Eagleton's
apparent edge. "I wouldn't have gotten into the race if I
didn't think I could beat him," he said. "I think Missouri
voters will illustrate a national trend by electing a fiscal
conservative over a representative of the liberal,
big-spending wing of the Democratic party."
