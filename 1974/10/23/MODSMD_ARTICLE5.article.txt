# Eagleton Faces Conservative Challenge
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON News Analysis 
Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton has been campaigning
confidently in Missouri this fall. In fact he's been almost
cocky, dismissing as inconsequential most charges made by
his Republican opponent, former Congressman Thomas B.
Curtis.
"I just let my record speak for itself," says Eagleton,
seeking his second term in the Senate after a short-lived
vice-presidential bid in 1972. "I don't pay much attention
to Mr. Curtis."
But Eagleton, who currently holds a significant lead over
Curtis in polls conducted by both parties, may be secretly
worried about several questions as the campaign enters its
final weeks.

This is the first time Eagleton has run in a
non-presidential election year, and his opponent's analysis
of voting patterns shows that in such years the rural vote,
where Curtis is strongest, is up, and the urban vote, where
Eagleton is strongest, is down.
The Republicans also point out that Missouri voters may
have shifted considerably to the right since Eagleton
narrowly defeated Curtis in the 1968 Senate race. "The
major difference in this campaign and the last," says Curtis,
is that now "I can go up to people and say I'm a
conservative and get a favorable reaction."
But the most intriguing and possible most significant
question involves the impact of Eagleton's 1972 disclosure

that he underwent psychiatric counseling and shock
treatments in the early '6os.
Initially, Curtis promised not to bring up Eagleton's
mental health problems as a campaign issue. He told the
Daily in late August that psychiatric treatment is irrelevant
in a Senate campaign.
"I didn't make an issue out of it in 1968 when it was
just rumors, and I'm not making an issue out of it now,"
Curtis said. "It doesn't really have a bearing on a person in
a deliberative body there are a lot of kooks in the Senate
who do a fine job."
Position Reversed
But Curtis has reversed his position in recent weeks,
insisting that Eagleton make his medical records public. By
not releasing the records, Curtis charged, Eagleton "has
encouraged a sympathy vote to develop based upon . ..
[the] assumption that the illness was not one which was
liable to recur."
Eagleton has remained opposed to full disclosure of his
medical records, although he admits that his removal from
the Democratic ticket in 1972 may have aroused some
sympathy among Missourians.
"Politically, it's been a blessing in disguise," Eagleton
said. "I have an enormous amount of name and face
recognition that I didn't have before. Quite frankly,
because McGovern is so unpopular in Missouri, the fact that
I was dumped from his ticket has helped me."
Eagleton insists, however, that he isn't actively soliciting
the sympathy vote. "I'm not making any special play," he
said, "but I'm living, I'm campaigning. I can't just go hide."
Curtis charges that Eagleton has been hiding "his
extreme liberal image from the public now that election
