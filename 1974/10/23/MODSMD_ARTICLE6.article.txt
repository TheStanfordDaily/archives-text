# Rape Victims 'Helpless,' Doctor Says

### SUE LUTTNER 
The major psychological effect of
rape is a feeling of helplessness by the
victim, psychiatrist Dr. Mimi Silbert
told a group of women last night at
the first community meeting of the
Palo Alto Police Department Rape
Grant Project.
Unfortunately "the entire judicial
process emphasizes this feeling," she
said. But with increased community
understanding and the help of support
groups, Silbert added, rape need not
be as traumatic as it has traditionally
been.
The Palo Alto Police Department is
in the second month of its federally
funded rape study. Although the Palo
Alto rape rate is very close to the
national average 43 reported cases
per 100,000 women—the Santa Clara
County rate is approximately 60 cases
per 100,000 women.
Officer Kate Talbot said that the
treatment of rape victims by legal and
medical examiners is improving, but
admitted that many women still object
to current procedures.
Study Objectives
The objectives of the rape study,
she said, are first to determine why
women do not report rapes, and then
to revise the treatment of rape victims
and improve investigation techniques.
A certain number of women will
simply not want to tell authorities
about a traumatic experience like rape,
Talbot said. She hopes to increase the
rate of reporting by improving
procedures.
Although many women see no
reason to report the crime, their
evidence is important to police, Talbot
emphasized. "We find that rapists
generally attack more than once," she
explained. She encouraged victims to
at least call in a description of the
rapist, even if they do not want to
