# Rape Victims 'Helpless,' Doctor Says
## 
### SUE LUTTNER 
The major psychological effect of
rape is a feeling of helplessness by the
victim, psychiatrist Dr. Mimi Silbert
told a group of women last night at
the first community meeting of the
Palo Alto Police Department Rape
Grant Project.
Unfortunately "the entire judicial
process emphasizes this feeling," she
said. But with increased community
understanding and the help of support
groups, Silbert added, rape need not
be as traumatic as it has traditionally
been.
The Palo Alto Police Department is
in the second month of its federally
funded rape study. Although the Palo
Alto rape rate is very close to the
national average 43 reported cases
per 100,000 women—the Santa Clara
County rate is approximately 60 cases
per 100,000 women.
Officer Kate Talbot said that the
treatment of rape victims by legal and
medical examiners is improving, but
admitted that many women still object
to current procedures.
Study Objectives
The objectives of the rape study,
she said, are first to determine why
women do not report rapes, and then
to revise the treatment of rape victims
and improve investigation techniques.
A certain number of women will
simply not want to tell authorities
about a traumatic experience like rape,
Talbot said. She hopes to increase the
rate of reporting by improving
procedures.
Although many women see no
reason to report the crime, their
evidence is important to police, Talbot
emphasized. "We find that rapists
generally attack more than once," she
explained. She encouraged victims to
at least call in a description of the
rapist, even if they do not want to
report their own names.
Attorney Joanne Brown, a
consultant for the study, reviewed
court procedure in rape cases, calling
the treatment of rape victims "one of
the basic injustices of the criminal
justice system."
Prosecution of an accused rapist,
she said, is taken out of the victim's

hands as soon as she identifies her
attacker. A district attorney reviews
the police report, and then has
independent control over where the
case goes.
"He doesn't want to try a losing
case," she explained, so he only files
cases that he's sure he can win. To
make this decision, he reviews the
socio-economic backgrouna of the

victim, and the victim's criminal
history, as well as the actual evidence.
These factors are important, Brown
said, because "the main defense is
often to discredit the victim."
But even if the police have provided
a tight case, "plea bargaining might
intervene," especially if the rapist was
not violent, she added. Judges often
encourage "deals" between the district
attorney and the defense attorney
because it lightens the court case load,
she said.
Women who are hesitant to call
authorities immediately can call
Women Against Rape (WAR) at
493-7273, WAR representative Jacquie
Reynolds said. Their main objectives
are to educate the community and to
provide support for rape victims,
according to Reynolds.
"What we're trying to fight is the
myth that a woman is doing something
wrong when she gets raped," Reynolds
explained. This attitude not only
increases the victim's guilt feelings, she
said, but also decreases public concern
with the problem. •
