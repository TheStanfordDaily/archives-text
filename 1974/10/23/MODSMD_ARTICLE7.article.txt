## editorials Jerry Brown 
### 
For the first time in many years, neither the Democrats nor the
Republicans have nominated a totally objectionable candidate for
governor of California. The Republicans have put forward state
Controller Houston I. Flournoy, the first GOP moderate to be
nominated in 20 years, while the Democrats have nominated
Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown, Jr., the able and dynamic son
of the popular former governor and a proven reformer in his own
right. Thus, for the first time in many years, a race can be decided on
the merits of a candidate rather than the failings of his opponent.
On the balance, the Daily finds Brown the better candidate. He has
established an impressive record of accomplishment in a relatively
short time, and we look forward to that kind of leadership in the
state's highest office for the next four years.
Although Jerry Brown has only held state office for four years, his
political experience extends well beyond that. His record is that of a
man who has stood up for what he believes in. In the early 19605, well
before it became popular, Brown spoke out for civil rights. In the
middle 60s, when conventional wisdom dictated otherwise, Brown
spoke out against the Vietnam War, and served as Southern California
Vice Chairman of the McCarthy Presidential campaign. In the late 60s,
he stood up for Cesar Chavez in the farmworkers' struggle.
Since moving to Sacramento in 1970, Brown has established a
record of activism and accomplishment unmatched by any other state
official. He turned the traditionally somnolent secretary of state's
office into a tough enforcer of election campaign laws, and
anticipated the so-called "post-Water gate morality" by a good two
years through his crackdown on corporate campaign contributions
and other illegal maneuverings.
As governnor, Brown offers reform from eight years of the
backward Reagan ism that has ballooned the state's budget while
cutting its services, damaged and downgraded the state educational
system and ignored human needs while catering to the rich and
powerful. That kind of reform is what California needs in 1974.
Flournoy is a capable man who has generally handled his
controller's job well for the past eight years, and in other times might
have made a highly attractive candidate. But he is still too wedded to
the Reaganites, to the wealthy conservatives who control the
Republican Party's checkbooks. When he had the chance to break the
strings by opposing Reagan's controversial tax initiative last year, he
couldn't or wouldn't do so. The best we could expect from Flournoy
would be a slow, cautious loosening of some of the ties binding the
state not the kind of widespread reform we need.
