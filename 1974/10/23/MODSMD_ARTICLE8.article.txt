# No Endorsement
## 
### 
Examining the records of both incumbent Rep. Paul N. McCloskey
Jr.and Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor, the Daily cannot offer its
endorsement to either candidate for the 12th District congressional
seat.
In the past, the Daily has supported McCloskey on the basis of his
early opposition to the Vietnam War, his early move for the
impeachment of Richard M. Nixon, his voting record on
environmental issues and his general appeal as a dissenting voice
within the Republican Party.
Unfortunately, we are now forced to note McCloskey's apparent
shifts toward a more conservative stance. While McCloskey
forthrightly opposed many of former President Nixon's objectionable
policies, he has failed to demonstrate the same critical insights with
regard to President Ford's administration.
In environmental matters, McCloskey has neatly expressed
generalized opposition to the immediate construction of nuclear
reactors along the California coast; however, he has also stated that
strip mining coal from the Great Plains offers the best, most accessible
relief to the nation's energy problems. It is exactly this sort of
environmental provincialism that destroys the chance for
comprehensive solutions.
With regard to women's rights, we note that McCloskey originally
voted against the Equal Rights Amendment despite public stands in
favor of women's rights.
McCloskey's shifts of position might not be so appalling if he had
not drawn heavily on Stanford's support in his June primary campaign
against Gordon Knapp. McCloskey and his campaigners persuaded
students to register Republican to keep the party's greatest minority
voice in office.
This McCloskey strategy seems particularly ironic in light of his
own endorsements of conservative Republicans for local and state
offices over liberals within his own party.
We acknowledge the delicate balance, that McCloskey must
maintain to keep both liberal supporters and conservative financers
happy. However, flashy liberal stands on issues of the past do not
replace a vigorously liberal voting record or nullify support for a
questionable president.
On the other hand, we do not find Gary Gillmor to be an
acceptable alternative to McCloskey. While Gillmor has taken some
favorable environmental stands, we question his knowledge of
national affairs. We are also disturbed by several Gillmor positions,
including his refusal to support unconditional amnesty for draft
evaders, his opposition to a national law legalizing abortion and his
stand in favor of capital punishment.
