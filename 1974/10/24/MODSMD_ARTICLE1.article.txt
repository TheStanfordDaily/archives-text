# New Leads In Murder Investigation
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
A Santa Clara County Sheriff's
official said that FBI analysis of
evidence from the campus murder of
Arlis Perry has turned up information
that "may prove potentially very
helpful" in solving the case.
Capt. Frank Mosunic, chief of
detectives, wouldn't release details of
the new information. But, he said, it
could prove highly important if it
can't be traced to anyone with
legitimate access to Memorial Church.
Perry, the 19-year-old wife of a
, Stanford undergraduate, was murdered
and molested in the church late on the
evening of Sept. 12. A security guard
opening the church for worship
services early the next morning
discovered Perry's body.
Meanwhile, police appear to have
cleared up at least one aspect of public
confusion about the case concerning
how and when the murderer
apparently left the church.
According to police reports, Perry's
husband reported her missing at about
3 a.m. Sunday, and told authorities he
felt she might still be inside the
church, where she had gone to
meditate shortly before it closed at
about midnight.
Examined External Doors
The security guard who had closed
the church, Steve Crawford, was
dispatched shortly after the 3 a.m. call
to check out the husband's hunch. He
examined the church's external doors,
and found that they all appeared
locked.
Police had reported that Crawford
found one of the doors ajar when he
came to open the church at 5:45 a.m.
thus leading to speculation that the
killer might have still been inside the
building between 3 and 5:45. (The
coroner placed Perry's time of death
between midnight and 12:30.)
However, Lt. Walt Konar of the
Stanford Police said that's not
, necessarily true. According to Konar,
the door found open was not an
exterior one, but an interior door on
the building's west side which is
normally locked up at night.
Forcible Exit
Konar noted that although no door
in the church showed signs of forcible
entry , this interior door showed signs
of forcible exit. Police theorize that
the killer was inside the church, along
with Perry, when it was closed for the
night. After the murder, he apparently
pushed against the interior door until
it cracked and the lock sprung open.
The killer was then able to open the
exterior door by operating a dead-bolt
lock.
The exterior door, which has an
automatic closing mechanism, shut
after the murderer left. Konar said it

appeared to be locked when the guard
checked it at 3 a.m.
An examination of the interior
door shows at least two large cracks
that police say were the result of the
killer's escape. Since the murder, all
locks have been replaced and the
building has been rekeyed.
Erroneous T.V. Report
Meanwhile yesterday, police
reiterated that a Tuesday television
report linking the Sunday night

kidnaping and assault of a Stanford
employee's wife with the Perry murder
was erroneous.
The report was attributed to
Mosunic, who said he was apparently
misquoted. He said the station, KPIX
in San Francisco, had apologized to
him but apparently didn't broadcast a
retraction.
Stanford Police and Sheriff's
officials said they received numerous
calls from people who think they saw
the assailant throughout the Bay Area.
They said they are currently following
up those reports.

the door found open was not an
exterior one, but an interior door on
the building's west side which is

Forcible Exit
Konar noted that although no door
in the church showed signs of forcible
entry , this interior door showed signs
of forcible exit. Police theorize that
the killer was inside the church, along
with Perry, when it was closed for the
night. After the murder, he apparently
pushed against the interior door until
it cracked and the lock sprung open.
The killer was then able to open the
exterior door by operating a dead-bolt
lock.

Erroneous T.V. Report
Meanwhile yesterday, police
reiterated that a Tuesday television
report linking the Sunday night

kidnaping and assault of a Stanford
employee's wife with the Perry murder
was erroneous.
The report was attributed to
Mosunic, who said he was apparently
misquoted. He said the station, KPIX
in San Francisco, had apologized to
him but apparently didn't broadcast a
retraction.
Stanford Police and Sheriff's
officials said they received numerous
calls from people who think they saw
the assailant throughout the Bay Area.
They said they are currently following
up those reports.
A Santa Clara County Sheriff's
official said that FBI analysis of
evidence from the campus murder of
Arlis Perry has turned up information
that "may prove potentially very
helpful" in solving the case.
Capt. Frank Mosunic, chief of
detectives, wouldn't release details of
the new information. But, he said, it
could prove highly important if it
can't be traced to anyone with
legitimate access to Memorial Church.
Perry, the 19-year-old wife of a
, Stanford undergraduate, was murdered
and molested in the church late on the
evening of Sept. 12. A security guard
opening the church for worship
services early the next morning
discovered Perry's body.
Meanwhile, police appear to have
cleared up at least one aspect of public
confusion about the case concerning
how and when the murderer
apparently left the church.
According to police reports, Perry's
husband reported her missing at about
3 a.m. Sunday, and told authorities he
felt she might still be inside the
church, where she had gone to
meditate shortly before it closed at
about midnight.
Examined External Doors
The security guard who had closed
the church, Steve Crawford, was
dispatched shortly after the 3 a.m. call
to check out the husband's hunch. He
examined the church's external doors,
and found that they all appeared
locked.
Police had reported that Crawford
found one of the doors ajar when he
came to open the church at 5:45 a.m.
thus leading to speculation that the
killer might have still been inside the
building between 3 and 5:45. (The
coroner placed Perry's time of death
between midnight and 12:30.)
