# On Four Precious Years Of Youth'
## 
### Normon Wessells 
This letter is in response to
comments concerning my courses,
Biology 108 and 110, and
premedical training (Daily, Oct.
18).
First, the letter is a perfect
example of premedical
misconceptions. Biology 108 and
110 are electives. Those courses
are not required for
entry into medical school or for a
major in biological sciences or
human biology. The demand of a
few medical schools for a course
in developmental biology (e.g.,
108) can be met by taking
Biology 106, Cell Development,
from Prof. Green; the overlap of
106 and 108 is intentional and
was designed in part to cover the
sabbatical leave situation.
Students currently in Biology 21
or Human Biology 2A will be able
to take Biology 110 in autumn
and 108 in winter of their senior
year.
Second, it cannot be
emphaiszed enough that there is
no best major or set of courses
that will favor one's chances of
admission to medical school. The
statistics show that a major in
philosophy or English is as
beneficial as one in biological
sciences or chemistry.
A single year of biology, with
lab, will suffice for the best
medical schools. The required
courses that count are organic
chemistry, physics, mathematics,
and the year in biology not
special advanced courses such as
110 and 108.
Student Input Sought
The decision not to offer
Biology 110 next year was made
following solicitation of advice
from our department's
Undergraduate Affairs Committee
(students sit on that committee),
after student* opinions were
obtained. Despite the committee
recommendation, attempts are
being made to find a high quality
teacher for 110 next year. I
continue to feel that no course is
better than a mediocre course

when we are discussing electives.
Obviously, an undergraduate
might ask: Couldn't someone else
in Stanford's Biology Department
do it? The response is no. We are
too thinly populated; our
vertebrate biologists are already
teaching in our core curriculum or
in human biology. One cannot in
good conscience ask a junior
faculty member to jeopardize his
or her chances for tenure by
assuming responsibility for a huge
undergraduate course for just one
year. Undergraduates should
realize that a fact of life at
Stanford is that the basic science
departments are extraordinarily

small in size; one consequence is
problems during sabbatical years.
Last, I would comment on the
term "strong preparatory
program," with respect to
premedical studies at Stanford.
That view of our courses is what is
most disturbing about the
attitudes of a small segment of
premedical students. Such people
give the impression that they are
not here to be educated; Stanford
is just a way-station leading to the
golden gates of medicine.
Biology 110, like many courses
at Stanford, is not taught with
medical school in mind; it is there
to show a student how fish swim

or bats fly or humans see it is
designed to expand one's view and
appreciation of the world,
irrespective of future careers or
goals.
To view undergraduate years
merely as a route to professional
school is, I believe, the worst
waste of this University's
resources and of four precious
years of youth. Moreover, that
view subverts the most essential
ingredient of what faculty who
care about undergraduate
education are attempting to do.

care about undergraduate
education are attempting to do.
(Norman Wessells is chairman of
the biology department.)
This letter is in response to
comments concerning my courses,
Biology 108 and 110, and
premedical training (Daily, Oct.
18).
First, the letter is a perfect
example of premedical
misconceptions. Biology 108 and
110 are electives. Those courses
are not required for
entry into medical school or for a
major in biological sciences or
human biology. The demand of a
few medical schools for a course
in developmental biology (e.g.,
108) can be met by taking
Biology 106, Cell Development,
from Prof. Green; the overlap of
106 and 108 is intentional and
was designed in part to cover the
sabbatical leave situation.
Students currently in Biology 21
or Human Biology 2A will be able
to take Biology 110 in autumn
and 108 in winter of their senior
year.
Second, it cannot be
emphaiszed enough that there is
no best major or set of courses
that will favor one's chances of
admission to medical school. The
statistics show that a major in
philosophy or English is as
beneficial as one in biological
sciences or chemistry.
A single year of biology, with
lab, will suffice for the best
medical schools. The required
courses that count are organic
chemistry, physics, mathematics,
and the year in biology not
special advanced courses such as
110 and 108.
Student Input Sought
The decision not to offer
Biology 110 next year was made
following solicitation of advice
from our department's
Undergraduate Affairs Committee
(students sit on that committee),
after student* opinions were
obtained. Despite the committee
recommendation, attempts are
being made to find a high quality
teacher for 110 next year. I
continue to feel that no course is
better than a mediocre course

when we are discussing electives.
Obviously, an undergraduate
might ask: Couldn't someone else
in Stanford's Biology Department
do it? The response is no. We are
too thinly populated; our
vertebrate biologists are already
teaching in our core curriculum or
in human biology. One cannot in
good conscience ask a junior
faculty member to jeopardize his
or her chances for tenure by
assuming responsibility for a huge
undergraduate course for just one
year. Undergraduates should
realize that a fact of life at
Stanford is that the basic science
departments are extraordinarily

small in size; one consequence is
problems during sabbatical years.
Last, I would comment on the
term "strong preparatory
program," with respect to
premedical studies at Stanford.
That view of our courses is what is
most disturbing about the
attitudes of a small segment of
premedical students. Such people
give the impression that they are
not here to be educated; Stanford
is just a way-station leading to the
golden gates of medicine.
Biology 110, like many courses
at Stanford, is not taught with
medical school in mind; it is there
to show a student how fish swim

or bats fly or humans see it is
designed to expand one's view and
appreciation of the world,
irrespective of future careers or
goals.
To view undergraduate years
merely as a route to professional
school is, I believe, the worst
waste of this University's
resources and of four precious
years of youth. Moreover, that
view subverts the most essential
ingredient of what faculty who
care about undergraduate
education are attempting to do.
