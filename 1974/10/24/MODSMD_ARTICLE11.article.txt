# A 						'Study' Of Professors
## 
### Crowe, O'Laughlin 
At the beginning of the school
year, a man called David
Ehrenfeld began soliciting student
interviewers through the Stanford
student placement service for a
study of Stanford professors.
Patricia Crowe, a graduate student
in anthropology, responded to the
ad. Initial contact was by
telephone and subsequent contact
was to be through a series of
mailed "exams," although Crowe
later met Ehrenfeld when she
suggested dropping off her first
exam in person.
The study was initially
explained as being research in
social psychology, specifically on
cognitive dissonance and peer
group pressure as it related to
professorial belief systems. In
fact, the questions discussed by
the "exams," in personal
discussion with Ehrenfeld, and by
the prospective questions for
professors were largely political;
Ehrenfeld later stated that the
subject of his study was
indoctrination.
Ehrenfeld said that he had
engaged a number of students to

work on the project last year, and
that he planned to hire six to
eight interviewers to work
throughout the fall term at the
rate of six dollars per hour six
hours per week. At that rate, the
cost of student interviewers alone
would be over $lOOO per month.
At first Ehrenfeld refused to
identify the source of his funds.
Later, Crowe told him that she
could not participate in the study
because of doubts about the
funding and the fact that she had
been instructed to say anything
she wished to professors about the
study as long as she got the
answers to the questions.
Ehrenfeld said that the funds
were his own and that the
research project was part of a 20
year study of his.
Crowe informed Ehrenfeld
again of the various resrvations
she had about the project and
added that she was not in a
position to verify his statements
which at that point seemed
doubly suspect, since he was
willing to lie to his subjects. She
suggested that he contact the

Committee on Human Subjects
(which must approve all research
at or through Stanford if it
involves human subjects), and
gave him a copy of the standard
research approval application
form.
We certainly hope that
Ehrenfeld has contacted the
Committee, but in the meantime
we think that it is importnat for
Stanford students and faculty to
be aware that such a study
apparently is already in progress
and has been for some time. We
would particularly like to alert
student interviewers to the
possible political implications of
their involvement in the project.
If Ehrenfeld is who he claims
to be, there is the issue of social
science research ethics. If he is
other than what he claims to be,
there is a very real possibility of
political repression and of the
violation of fundamental civil
rights and academic freedom.
