I would like to point out an
error of fact in your Oct. 21
article regarding the State Senate
race between incumbent Arlen
Gregorio and James Tormey, Jr.
Tormey either stated or the
Daily interpreted his remarks to
imply that a committee chaired
by Gregorio was responsible for a
grant to the San Francisco Opera.
This is not true.
Gregorio does chair the Joint
Committee on the Arts, but this
Committee does not have any
money to give away. The sole role
of the Joint Committee on'the
Arts is to examine the future role
of state support of the arts and to
recommend legislation in this
area.
The grant received by the San
Francisco Opera was received
from the California Arts
Commission; a body appointed by
the Governor and an agency of
which Gregorio has been critical.
Any inference that there is
some type of "special interest,"
quid pro quo , relationship here is
180 degrees off-base.

Alan Galbut (letter, Oct. 16)
has doubtless found that it's easier
to charge someone with "rhetoric
and hypocrisy" when one is not
too careful about how one quotes
the accused. In my talk to the
American Council on Education I
said:
"We should pledge ourselves to
Truth in Educational Packaging.
As anyone knows who has
recently tried to help a son or
daughter choose a college to
attend, our literature tends to be
uniform, and characterized by a
marked tendency towards inflated
claims and a studious avoidance of
any reference to shortcomings, or
even limitations upon what we
provide." (Italics added.)
To Galbut this translates as my
having "reprimanded other
universities," and constitutes
"throwing stones from glass
offices." Could it be that he, too,
could use a few lessons in the uses
and abuses of rhetoric?

I have become slightly irritated
with the numerous complaints of
overly coverage of
the Perry murder, although I
appreciate their sincerity.
Granted, good taste is generally
out the window by the time an
occurence such as this is
described, but what is more
important is that the community
be shocked.
A bizarre sex murder discreetly
reported does not have the same
impact as one fully revealed, and
what we need is impact! Even
after the previous murders in the
area, women continue to
hitch-hike alone; one of those
interviewed after the Perry
murder said it was "hard to relate
to because it's not part of my
personal experience." Is this what
we want, more "personal
experiences" of this nature?
Maybe the thought of the more
grisly aspects involved will keep
another student from being
careless. Maybe it will spark more
protective training courses. I don't
want a community of scared
rabbits, but I would like to see
students cautiously and
deliberately minimizing the risks
of assault.
Friends and relatives of Arlis
Perry have suffered deeply, and I
admit that detailed newspaper
accounts must exacerbate the
wounds, but wouldn't they want
this type of tragedy never to
happen again? If the phrase
"three-foot candle" running
through her mind keeps another
student froip crossing campus at
midnight and thereby saves her
life, then it was worth printing.

I would like to point out an
error of fact in your Oct. 21
article regarding the State Senate
race between incumbent Arlen
Gregorio and James Tormey, Jr.
Tormey either stated or the
Daily interpreted his remarks to
imply that a committee chaired
by Gregorio was responsible for a
grant to the San Francisco Opera.
This is not true.
Gregorio does chair the Joint
Committee on the Arts, but this
Committee does not have any
money to give away. The sole role
of the Joint Committee on'the
Arts is to examine the future role
of state support of the arts and to
recommend legislation in this
area.
The grant received by the San
Francisco Opera was received
from the California Arts
Commission; a body appointed by
the Governor and an agency of
which Gregorio has been critical.
Any inference that there is
some type of "special interest,"
quid pro quo , relationship here is
180 degrees off-base.

Alan Galbut (letter, Oct. 16)
has doubtless found that it's easier
to charge someone with "rhetoric
and hypocrisy" when one is not
too careful about how one quotes
the accused. In my talk to the
American Council on Education I
said:
"We should pledge ourselves to
Truth in Educational Packaging.
As anyone knows who has
recently tried to help a son or
daughter choose a college to
attend, our literature tends to be
uniform, and characterized by a
marked tendency towards inflated
claims and a studious avoidance of
any reference to shortcomings, or
even limitations upon what we
provide." (Italics added.)
To Galbut this translates as my
having "reprimanded other
universities," and constitutes
"throwing stones from glass
offices." Could it be that he, too,
could use a few lessons in the uses
and abuses of rhetoric?

I have become slightly irritated
with the numerous complaints of
overly coverage of
the Perry murder, although I
appreciate their sincerity.
Granted, good taste is generally
out the window by the time an
occurence such as this is
described, but what is more
important is that the community
be shocked.
A bizarre sex murder discreetly
reported does not have the same
impact as one fully revealed, and
what we need is impact! Even
after the previous murders in the
area, women continue to
hitch-hike alone; one of those
interviewed after the Perry
murder said it was "hard to relate
to because it's not part of my
personal experience." Is this what
we want, more "personal
experiences" of this nature?
Maybe the thought of the more
grisly aspects involved will keep
another student from being
careless. Maybe it will spark more
protective training courses. I don't
want a community of scared
rabbits, but I would like to see
students cautiously and
deliberately minimizing the risks
of assault.
Friends and relatives of Arlis
Perry have suffered deeply, and I
admit that detailed newspaper
accounts must exacerbate the
wounds, but wouldn't they want
this type of tragedy never to
happen again? If the phrase
"three-foot candle" running
through her mind keeps another
student froip crossing campus at
midnight and thereby saves her
life, then it was worth printing.
