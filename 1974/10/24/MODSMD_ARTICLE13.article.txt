## Edgar Mitchell Probes Psychic Spaces 
### JOAN HINMAN 
"Those people are ignoring j this view.
They're ignoring purpose. It's almost an
insane society. It's almost like lemmings
rushing to the sea."
For Edgar Mitchell, the sixth man to
walk on the moon, that is the view of
humanity brought back from his mission as
lunar module pilot for Apollo 14.
Speaking with incredible tranquility,
Mitchell describes what he repeatedly calls
"the little blue planet earth" as seen from
deep space:
"It was as though the whole universe
were available to me. I knew that this was a
purposeful universe and that man had a
place in it."
Psychic Research
The Apollo 14 flight gave Mitchell the
insight to 'recognize his present place in the
universe, that of founder and president of
the Institute of Noetic Sciences, a
non-profit Palo Alto corporation noted for
its work in psychic research.
Although the switch from astronaut to
psychic researcher has been played up in
the media with some unsubtle "see, he
really freaked out in space" overtones,
Mitchell became interested in psychic
phenomena before his Apollo mission.
He states that he was, "probably as
pragmatic and classically oriented an
anyone," but that at an early age he
became "disturbed by the dichotomy
between science and religion."
Obtaining a doctorate of science in
aeronautics and astronautics from
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1964, Mitchell was continually aware of

the disdain with which many scientists
viewed psychic research.
'No-No Field'
Nonetheless, he explains that shortly
before his Apollo mission, "pretty much
out of desperation I began looking at this
no-no field of parapsychology."
In fact, Mitchell conducted his own
telepathy experiment with receivers on
earth from the moon which he says was
successful at a probability of 3000 to one.
Through research that has taken place
since his 1971 Apollo mission, Mitchell
states that the same experiment could be
done now using slightly different means
with much better results.
"For example, we know now that the
higher the emotional content of the target
material, the better the transmission,"
Mitchell explains. Altered states of
consciousness also seem to increase psychic
receptiveness.
Global Consciousness
Mitchell calls the altered state he
experienced in space "instant global
conciousness. He starts thinking of
himself as a planetary citizen," says
Mitchell of the astronaut's changed
viewpoint.
Even the pictures brought back by the
Apollo crews of the blue earth have had
"an electrifying effect on the people of the
world," according to Mitchell.
"Historians will mark the change in
conciousness of the specie on the planet
earth from the Apollo days," he states.
Totally Normal
Yet the entire point of Mitchell's
research is inquiry into the possibility that

altered states of conciousness are totally
natural and always available to any
member of the human race.
"Great seers, mystics if you will, have
been having their peak experiences and
altered states of thousands of years, long
before we went into space," he explains.
"These kind of experiences run rampant
through the specie."
On a personal level, Mitchell claims that
he can return to the conciousness he
obtained in space, "almost at will. One has
to practice relaxation and meditative
techniques. It's a discipline like anything
else."
Mitchell believes strongly that the global
conciousness he experienced in space must
be integrated into human institutions if
mankind is to survive.
'Crying Need'
"The crying need now is to understand
ourselves as human beings," he explains.
"Natural disaster used to be the bane of
human existence. Now we deal with
manmade disaster."
Despite our highly advanced
technology, "we can't get along with each
other."
Although he believes that ideally every
human being should be able to experience
global conciousness, Mitchell also says, "I
don't think we have time for a grassroots
movement."
For this reason he is presently
concentrating his personal efforts on
national and world leadership because he
wants to contact "those in a position to
really do something."
Mitchell believes that "corporate

survival" is the reason behind the fact that
large companies are becoming increasingly
interested in his work. He is presently in
consultation with a major oil company
which he says is interested in "not only
human resources, but planetary resources
as well."
On the individual level, Mitchell calls
meditation, "very viable, however there are
some pitfalls.
"There are some qualms about unguided
meditation. People can get into
subconciousness and wander around like
lost souls. We've seen quite a few
casualties."
However, he feels that, "we'll just have
to suffer with the casualties until we find a
better way of doing things."
Admitting that there is no guarantee as
to the value of his research, Mitchell offers
a haunting analogy.
"A man holding a rifle is being charged
by a lion. He's going to just pull the trigger,
because if he checks first to see if the gun
is loaded, he's had it. It's all over.
"I think the human race is about in that
situation right now."
