Why was a certain hand-painted banner at the Washington football
game taken down from beneath the scoreboard by game officials?
Were they following someone's orders? —D.K. and W.L.
A voice from the press box told the red-coat officials to remove the
"77% AND BENCHED" sign, according to Peter G. Kmetovic,
stadium operations manager.
Although no one seems to know whom the mysterious voice
belonged to, Athletic Director Joseph H. Ruetz said he would have
ordered the banner to be taken down if he had seen it.
People come to the stadium "to see a football game not to engage
in character assassinations," Ruetz proclaimed.
The University has a policy that no one can display banners
without prior permission from officials, Assoc. Administration
Director Robert G. Young stated.
Kmetovic, Young and Ruetz thought the matter had nothing to do
with free speech. A football game is a sports event, Kmetovic added,
not an excuse to propagandize the fans.

Is there any place on campus where one can go to look up the
backgrounds of professors where they were educated, where they
have taught, the topic of their theses? —C.H.
If you think your professor is a fraud don't check the University
Archives to look up his or her record. According to Ron Elving,
assistant to the archivist, professors write their own answers to archive
questionnaires regarding recent prizes they have won, etc.
Not all the files are complete as some faculty members don't
respond, but the Archives do have files of all the professors who have
ever taught here.
If you're more interested in reading articles about your professors
and learning more details about them, go to News and Publications
behind Encina Hall or the Medical Center news bureau for Medical
School faculty.
The files at both bureaus are basically used for the press but they
are accessible to students who ask for assistance.
