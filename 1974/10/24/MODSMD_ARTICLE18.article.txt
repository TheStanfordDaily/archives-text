Defense Says Sirica Is 'Unfair'
WASHINGTON - The judge at the Watergate
coverup trial was accused of being palpably unfair
by a defense lawyer yesterday during a
fist-pounding, shouting argument out of the jury's
hearings.
The dispute between U.S. District Judge John J.
Sirica and John J. Wilson both in their 70s and
long-time acquaintances lasted only a few minutes,
and the issue later was resolved amicably.
It came as Wilson, representing H.R. Haldeman,
was cross-examining the lead-off government witness,
former White House counsel John W. Dean 111, and
comparing his testimony at the Senate Watergate
hearings with tape recordings played for the jury
earlier.
Later, the attorney for defendant John N.
Mitchell got Dean to admit he was willing to place
blame for the Watergate break-in on Mitchell, a
former attorney general, although he had no direct
evidence that Mitchell authorized the burglary,
which occurred June 17, 1972.
By day's end, Mitchell's lawyer had not finished
his cross-examination of Dean, on the witness stand
for the sixth day. Lawyers for the other three
defendants, John D. Ehrlichman, Robert C. Mardian
and Kenneth W. Parkinson also are expected to
cross examine him.
New Special Prosecutor Named
WASHINGTON - Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe
appointed Henry S. Ruth to succeed Leon Jaworski
as the special Watergate prosecutor, it was
announced yesterday.
Ruth, who has been the deputy prosecutor since
the special force was created in May 1973, takes
over the top job on Saturday.
Jaworski is resigning after a year as head of the
prosecution force to return to private law practice
in Texas.
Asked if he would contest the pardoning of
former President Richard M. Nixon, Ruth said he
did not want to comment on that and added, "I
have a lot of work to do."
Saxbe said he selected Ruth after discussing the
appointment with President Ford, with Democratic
and Republican leaders of the House and Senate,
and the chairman and ranking minority members of

the judiciary committees of both houses.
'UJS. Should Set Energy Example'
BONN, Germany West German Finance
Minister Hans Apel says the United States must set
an effective example to its Western allies and start
cutting back on petroleum use as a means of
stabilizing oil prices.
He suggested that Western industrial countries
form a solid bloc to deal with the price crisis.
Otherwise, Apel said in an interview, prices could
continue rising to a point of economic catastrophe
and this could lead to military conflict.
"When nations are hopeless, everything might
happen ..." he said. "But we have not yet reached
that stage; on the contrary we are far away from
there."
Meanwhile, in Washington the chief White House
spokesman said President Ford will seek tougher
measures if voluntary energy conservation programs
don't succeed, and raised the possibility of clamping
a dollar limit on oil imports.
Umbrella Energy Agency Debuts
WASHINGTON - A new federal research agency
created to develop all energy sources is starting to
atomic power and coal.
In the Energy Reorganization Act signed, on Oct.
11, establishing the Energy Research and
Development Administration (ERDA), Congress
cited solar energy as a candidate for priority
development.
In contrast, of the 7,124 employes assigned to
the new agency, only 49 are working on solar
energy, geothermal energy, advanced auto engines
and other new concepts.
To construct ERDA, Congress took apart the
28-year-old Atomic Energy Commission but so
much of AEC was transferred to ERDA that atomic
programs appear to utilize about 99 percent of its
manpower.
Kissinger Negotiates With USSR
MOSCOW - Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger arrived in the Soviet Union yesterday to
try to settle on guidelines for a new treaty limiting
offensive nuclear weapons.
If Kissinger succeeds in his mission, the
guidelines would be ratified by President Ford and

Leonid I. Brezhnev at a short summit next month,
probably in the Soviet far east.
The 3V2 day visit by Kissinger is considered a
major test of Soviet interest in a nuclear arms pact
and in detente generally.
Simon Aide: TJ.S. In Recession'
WASHINGTON An administration economic
adviser said yesterday the nation appears headed for
a sharp but short recession and called for further
easing of the government's tight money policies.
"I think we are probably in the early stages of
what could turn out to be V-type recession," said
Paul W. McCracken, an adviser to Treasury
Secretary William E. Simon.
McCracken's assessment of the economy's
performance came in an interview and contrasted
with previous administration assertions that the
economy is moving sideways rather than dropping
into a recession.
GOP Sets Campaign Price Tag
WASHINGTON The Republican National
Committee estimates it will spend at least $750,000
this year on political activities of the White House,
including President Ford's recent campaign trips.
Neither the White House nor the GOP
committee, however, could estimate what portion
of the $750,000 would be used for the trips
themselves.
Ford has campaigned in a dozen states for
Republicans running for Congress.

preference to Los Angeles, reportedly by a vote of

It also gave unanimous approval to Lake Placid,
the only candidate for the Winter Games.

Kissinger Negotiates With USSR
MOSCOW - Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger arrived in the Soviet Union yesterday to
try to settle on guidelines for a new treaty limiting
offensive nuclear weapons.
If Kissinger succeeds in his mission, the
guidelines would be ratified by President Ford and

Leonid I. Brezhnev at a short summit next month,
probably in the Soviet far east.
The 3V2 day visit by Kissinger is considered a
major test of Soviet interest in a nuclear arms pact
and in detente generally.
Simon Aide: TJ.S. In Recession'
WASHINGTON An administration economic
adviser said yesterday the nation appears headed for
a sharp but short recession and called for further
easing of the government's tight money policies.
"I think we are probably in the early stages of
what could turn out to be V-type recession," said
Paul W. McCracken, an adviser to Treasury
Secretary William E. Simon.
McCracken's assessment of the economy's
performance came in an interview and contrasted
with previous administration assertions that the
economy is moving sideways rather than dropping
into a recession.
GOP Sets Campaign Price Tag
WASHINGTON The Republican National
Committee estimates it will spend at least $750,000
this year on political activities of the White House,

of the $750,000 would be used for the trips
themselves.
Ford has campaigned in a dozen states for
Republicans running for Congress.

Defense Says Sirica Is 'Unfair'
WASHINGTON - The judge at the Watergate
coverup trial was accused of being palpably unfair
by a defense lawyer yesterday during a
fist-pounding, shouting argument out of the jury's
hearings.
The dispute between U.S. District Judge John J.
Sirica and John J. Wilson both in their 70s and
long-time acquaintances lasted only a few minutes,
and the issue later was resolved amicably.
It came as Wilson, representing H.R. Haldeman,
was cross-examining the lead-off government witness,
former White House counsel John W. Dean 111, and
comparing his testimony at the Senate Watergate
hearings with tape recordings played for the jury
earlier.
Later, the attorney for defendant John N.
Mitchell got Dean to admit he was willing to place
blame for the Watergate break-in on Mitchell, a
former attorney general, although he had no direct
evidence that Mitchell authorized the burglary,
which occurred June 17, 1972.
By day's end, Mitchell's lawyer had not finished
his cross-examination of Dean, on the witness stand
for the sixth day. Lawyers for the other three
defendants, John D. Ehrlichman, Robert C. Mardian
and Kenneth W. Parkinson also are expected to
cross examine him.
New Special Prosecutor Named
WASHINGTON - Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe
appointed Henry S. Ruth to succeed Leon Jaworski
as the special Watergate prosecutor, it was
announced yesterday.
Ruth, who has been the deputy prosecutor since
the special force was created in May 1973, takes
over the top job on Saturday.
Jaworski is resigning after a year as head of the
prosecution force to return to private law practice
in Texas.
Asked if he would contest the pardoning of
former President Richard M. Nixon, Ruth said he
did not want to comment on that and added, "I
have a lot of work to do."
Saxbe said he selected Ruth after discussing the
appointment with President Ford, with Democratic
and Republican leaders of the House and Senate,
and the chairman and ranking minority members of

the judiciary committees of both houses.
'UJS. Should Set Energy Example'
BONN, Germany West German Finance
Minister Hans Apel says the United States must set

cutting back on petroleum use as a means of

He suggested that Western industrial countries
form a solid bloc to deal with the price crisis.
Otherwise, Apel said in an interview, prices could
continue rising to a point of economic catastrophe

"When nations are hopeless, everything might
happen ..." he said. "But we have not yet reached
that stage; on the contrary we are far away from

Meanwhile, in Washington the chief White House

The dispute between U.S. District Judge John J.
Sirica and John J. Wilson both in their 70s and
long-time acquaintances lasted only a few minutes,
and the issue later was resolved amicably.
It came as Wilson, representing H.R. Haldeman,
was cross-examining the lead-off government witness,
former White House counsel John W. Dean 111, and
comparing his testimony at the Senate Watergate
hearings with tape recordings played for the jury
earlier.
Later, the attorney for defendant John N.
Mitchell got Dean to admit he was willing to place
blame for the Watergate break-in on Mitchell, a
former attorney general, although he had no direct
evidence that Mitchell authorized the burglary,
which occurred June 17, 1972.
By day's end, Mitchell's lawyer had not finished
his cross-examination of Dean, on the witness stand
for the sixth day. Lawyers for the other three
defendants, John D. Ehrlichman, Robert C. Mardian
and Kenneth W. Parkinson also are expected to
cross examine him.
New Special Prosecutor Named
WASHINGTON - Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe
appointed Henry S. Ruth to succeed Leon Jaworski
as the special Watergate prosecutor, it was
announced yesterday.
Ruth, who has been the deputy prosecutor since
the special force was created in May 1973, takes
over the top job on Saturday.
Jaworski is resigning after a year as head of the
prosecution force to return to private law practice
in Texas.
Asked if he would contest the pardoning of
former President Richard M. Nixon, Ruth said he
did not want to comment on that and added, "I
have a lot of work to do."
Saxbe said he selected Ruth after discussing the
appointment with President Ford, with Democratic
and Republican leaders of the House and Senate,
and the chairman and ranking minority members of

the judiciary committees of both houses.
'UJS. Should Set Energy Example'
BONN, Germany West German Finance
Minister Hans Apel says the United States must set
an effective example to its Western allies and start
cutting back on petroleum use as a means of
stabilizing oil prices.
He suggested that Western industrial countries
form a solid bloc to deal with the price crisis.
Otherwise, Apel said in an interview, prices could
continue rising to a point of economic catastrophe
and this could lead to military conflict.
"When nations are hopeless, everything might
happen ..." he said. "But we have not yet reached
that stage; on the contrary we are far away from
there."
Meanwhile, in Washington the chief White House
spokesman said President Ford will seek tougher
measures if voluntary energy conservation programs
don't succeed, and raised the possibility of clamping
a dollar limit on oil imports.
Umbrella Energy Agency Debuts
WASHINGTON - A new federal research agency
created to develop all energy sources is starting to
atomic power and coal.
In the Energy Reorganization Act signed, on Oct.
11, establishing the Energy Research and
Development Administration (ERDA), Congress
cited solar energy as a candidate for priority
development.
In contrast, of the 7,124 employes assigned to
the new agency, only 49 are working on solar
energy, geothermal energy, advanced auto engines
and other new concepts.
To construct ERDA, Congress took apart the
28-year-old Atomic Energy Commission but so
much of AEC was transferred to ERDA that atomic
programs appear to utilize about 99 percent of its
manpower.
Kissinger Negotiates With USSR
MOSCOW - Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger arrived in the Soviet Union yesterday to
try to settle on guidelines for a new treaty limiting
offensive nuclear weapons.
If Kissinger succeeds in his mission, the
guidelines would be ratified by President Ford and

Leonid I. Brezhnev at a short summit next month,
probably in the Soviet far east.
The 3V2 day visit by Kissinger is considered a
major test of Soviet interest in a nuclear arms pact
and in detente generally.
Simon Aide: TJ.S. In Recession'
WASHINGTON An administration economic
adviser said yesterday the nation appears headed for
a sharp but short recession and called for further
easing of the government's tight money policies.
"I think we are probably in the early stages of
what could turn out to be V-type recession," said
Paul W. McCracken, an adviser to Treasury
Secretary William E. Simon.
McCracken's assessment of the economy's
performance came in an interview and contrasted
with previous administration assertions that the
economy is moving sideways rather than dropping
into a recession.
GOP Sets Campaign Price Tag
WASHINGTON The Republican National
Committee estimates it will spend at least $750,000
this year on political activities of the White House,
including President Ford's recent campaign trips.
Neither the White House nor the GOP
committee, however, could estimate what portion
of the $750,000 would be used for the trips
themselves.
Ford has campaigned in a dozen states for
Republicans running for Congress.
