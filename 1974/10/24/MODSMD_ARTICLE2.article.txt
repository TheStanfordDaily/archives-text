# New Test Aids Heart Transplants
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Medical School researchers have
developed a new blood test that may
make heart transplants safer by
helping detect graft rejection in
transplant patients.
Assoc. Surgery Prof. Eugene Dong
Jr. announced earlier this week that
the test had proved successful in
predicting organ disfunction and
possible rejection up to five days
before prediction by previous
methods.
Dong, faculty sponsor for the
research team, told the Daily
yesterday that the test was "no
'breakthrough' " but "just another
step in the evolution in making heart
transplants safer."
The test aids doctors in diagnosing
rejection in its earliest stages and thus
lessens the need for medication to
reverse rejection, according to the
research.
The drugs now used to counter the
body's immune reaction to grafts are
"fairly toxic," Dong said, and these
drugs often predispose patients to
infections and malignancies.
'MRLB Assay'
The new blood test, developed by
fourth-year medical student Randall
Morris, is called the modified reactive
leukocyte blastogenesis (MRLB) assay.
Morris, the senior author of the test
research paper, proposed that doctors
examine immune cell (or leukocyte)
division as soon as it begins by
monitoring DNA synthesis. The
immune cells spark the tissue rejection
process.
There is a "good correlation
between a rise in the leukocyte count
and the old tests we used," Dong said.

Doctors have used electrocardiogram
readings and biopsy results as the main
detectors of transplant rejection.
A 'Good Clue'
Dong characterized MRLB assay
results as a "good clue" to rejection,
adding that only biopsy, or surgical
removal and examination of actual
tissue, is a "definitive test" of graft
rejection.
"But you just can't perform a
biopsy every day," he explained,
because of the amount of heart tissue
needed.
Blood tests were conducted on 12

patients who were observed for 45 to
75 days after the transplant and there
were 18 instances of rejection, Dong
said.
Small Number Of Tests
He admitted that the tests were
conducted on a "relatively small
number of patients," but stressed that
the test results were statistically
significant.
Dong commented that the
researchers concentrated on heart
transplants because Stanford Hospital
emphasizes heart transplants rather
than that of other organs.
According to the researchers'
report, "This test should be applicable
in diagnosing rejection of transplanted
organs other than the heart. However,
more experience with the test would
be needed before determining the

ultimate benefit to patients."
Report Co-Authors
Along with Morris, co-authors of
the research paper include human
biology major Charlene Struthers, who
participated in technical aspects of the
research; Asst. Surgery Profs. Randall
Griepp and Edward Stinson, who
monitored the patients and performed
necessary surgery; Dr. Margaret
Billingham, the pathologist who read
test biopsies, and world-famous
Surgery Prof. Norman Shumway.
The researchers originally presented
their findings Monday at the meeting
of the American College of Surgeons
in Miami Beach.
Stanford Medical Center, one of the
pioneers in the heart transplant field,
has 26 surviving transplant patients.
Seventy-seven persons have received
new hearts here.
In addition to the new blood test,
Stanford surgeons helped develop the
bioptome, a device which aids the
biopsy procedure and has
"substantially improved the survival
chances of patients with new hearts,"
according to Shumway.
Dong commented, "There's no
question that our research into
rejection has helped tremendously in
the care of patients."

question that our research into
rejection has helped tremendously in
the care of patients."
Medical School researchers have
developed a new blood test that may
make heart transplants safer by
helping detect graft rejection in
transplant patients.
Assoc. Surgery Prof. Eugene Dong
Jr. announced earlier this week that
the test had proved successful in
predicting organ disfunction and
possible rejection up to five days
before prediction by previous
methods.
Dong, faculty sponsor for the
research team, told the Daily
yesterday that the test was "no
'breakthrough' " but "just another
step in the evolution in making heart
transplants safer."
The test aids doctors in diagnosing
rejection in its earliest stages and thus
lessens the need for medication to
reverse rejection, according to the
research.
The drugs now used to counter the
body's immune reaction to grafts are
"fairly toxic," Dong said, and these
drugs often predispose patients to
infections and malignancies.
'MRLB Assay'
The new blood test, developed by
fourth-year medical student Randall
Morris, is called the modified reactive
leukocyte blastogenesis (MRLB) assay.
Morris, the senior author of the test
research paper, proposed that doctors
examine immune cell (or leukocyte)
division as soon as it begins by
monitoring DNA synthesis. The
immune cells spark the tissue rejection
process.
There is a "good correlation
between a rise in the leukocyte count
and the old tests we used," Dong said.

Doctors have used electrocardiogram
readings and biopsy results as the main
detectors of transplant rejection.
A 'Good Clue'
Dong characterized MRLB assay
results as a "good clue" to rejection,
adding that only biopsy, or surgical
removal and examination of actual
tissue, is a "definitive test" of graft
rejection.
"But you just can't perform a
biopsy every day," he explained,
because of the amount of heart tissue
needed.
Blood tests were conducted on 12

patients who were observed for 45 to
75 days after the transplant and there
were 18 instances of rejection, Dong
said.
Small Number Of Tests
He admitted that the tests were
conducted on a "relatively small
number of patients," but stressed that
the test results were statistically
significant.
Dong commented that the
researchers concentrated on heart
transplants because Stanford Hospital
emphasizes heart transplants rather
than that of other organs.
According to the researchers'
report, "This test should be applicable
in diagnosing rejection of transplanted
organs other than the heart. However,
more experience with the test would
be needed before determining the

ultimate benefit to patients."
Report Co-Authors
Along with Morris, co-authors of
the research paper include human
biology major Charlene Struthers, who
participated in technical aspects of the
research; Asst. Surgery Profs. Randall
Griepp and Edward Stinson, who
monitored the patients and performed
necessary surgery; Dr. Margaret
Billingham, the pathologist who read
test biopsies, and world-famous
Surgery Prof. Norman Shumway.
The researchers originally presented
their findings Monday at the meeting
of the American College of Surgeons
in Miami Beach.
Stanford Medical Center, one of the
pioneers in the heart transplant field,
has 26 surviving transplant patients.
Seventy-seven persons have received
new hearts here.
In addition to the new blood test,
Stanford surgeons helped develop the
bioptome, a device which aids the
biopsy procedure and has
"substantially improved the survival
chances of patients with new hearts,"
according to Shumway.
Dong commented, "There's no
