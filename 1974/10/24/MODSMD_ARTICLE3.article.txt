# Nixon Enters Hospital For Further Testing

### 
LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -
Former President Richard M. Nixon
was readmitted to Memorial Hospital
Medical Center last night for further
treatment of his left leg. Nixon's
doctor said if the treatment proves
ineffective, surgery may be required.
Nixon's readmittance to the
hospital came less than three weeks
after he was released from his first
hospital treatment for phlebitis, an
inflammation of the veins.
Dr. John C. Lungren, Nixon's
longtime personal physician, said the
decision to readmit Nixon to the
hospital for further diagnostic tests
was made after oral medication proved
ineffective for treatment of the
problem.
Lungren said tests earlier in the
evening revealed blockages of blood
vessels resulting in a "near
total... blockage of blood flow" in
Nixon's left thigh.
He said a number of new blood
clots were found in Nixon's left leg,
but cautioned that "these clots could
be old or fresh."
Lungren said the inadequacy of the
anticoagulation drugs had reached the
point "where I was beginning to feel a
paradoxical effect; that is, an inability
to properly anticoagulate with oral
medication."
The doctor emphasized that if the
hospital was incapable of proving
adequate anticoagulation orally, "then
the possibility of surgical intervention
must be considered."
The doctor did not indicate what
surgical procedures might be involved.
A hospital spokesman said Nixon
may be released in a few days.

During Nixon's hospitalization in
September, diagnostic tests
determined that a portion of the blood
clot caused by the phlebitis in his left
leg had traveled to his right lung.
Lungren said that through a lung
scan yesterday it was determined that
the clot in Nixon's right lung was
stable and "there was no evidence of
any new involvement."
Hospital spokeswoman Karen
Krantz said Nixon was admitted about
three hours after he arrived from his
San Clemente home. She said she did
not know whether the decision to
admit Nixon was made before or after
he arrived or how long he would be
staying.
Jack Weiblen, hospital vice
president, said Nixon returned to the
hospital in this seaside industrial city
for a "repeat diagnostic test." He did
not elaborate.
Weiblen said Nixon was limping
slightly when he reported to the
hospital at about 6:10 p.m. PDT.
"It was planned earlier in the day,"
Weiblen said. "It was not an
emergency."
Nixon apparently made the 50-mile
trip to Long Beach from his home at
San Clemente by car. It was not
immediately known if any members of
his family accompanied him.
Krantz said Nixon entered the large
hospital through the same rear service
entrance used when he was
hospitalized in September.
Weiblen and Krantz said Lungren,
would be administering the tests.

A hospital spokesman said Nixon
may be released in a few days.

During Nixon's hospitalization in
September, diagnostic tests
determined that a portion of the blood
clot caused by the phlebitis in his left
leg had traveled to his right lung.
Lungren said that through a lung
scan yesterday it was determined that
the clot in Nixon's right lung was
stable and "there was no evidence of
any new involvement."
Hospital spokeswoman Karen
Krantz said Nixon was admitted about
three hours after he arrived from his
San Clemente home. She said she did
not know whether the decision to
admit Nixon was made before or after
he arrived or how long he would be
staying.
Jack Weiblen, hospital vice
president, said Nixon returned to the
hospital in this seaside industrial city
for a "repeat diagnostic test." He did
not elaborate.
Weiblen said Nixon was limping
slightly when he reported to the
hospital at about 6:10 p.m. PDT.
"It was planned earlier in the day,"
Weiblen said. "It was not an
emergency."
Nixon apparently made the 50-mile
trip to Long Beach from his home at
San Clemente by car. It was not
immediately known if any members of
his family accompanied him.
Krantz said Nixon entered the large
hospital through the same rear service
entrance used when he was
hospitalized in September.
Weiblen and Krantz said Lungren,
would be administering the tests.
LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -
Former President Richard M. Nixon
was readmitted to Memorial Hospital
Medical Center last night for further
treatment of his left leg. Nixon's
doctor said if the treatment proves
ineffective, surgery may be required.
Nixon's readmittance to the
hospital came less than three weeks
after he was released from his first
hospital treatment for phlebitis, an
inflammation of the veins.
Dr. John C. Lungren, Nixon's
longtime personal physician, said the
decision to readmit Nixon to the
hospital for further diagnostic tests
was made after oral medication proved
ineffective for treatment of the
problem.
Lungren said tests earlier in the
evening revealed blockages of blood
vessels resulting in a "near
total... blockage of blood flow" in
Nixon's left thigh.
He said a number of new blood
clots were found in Nixon's left leg,
but cautioned that "these clots could
be old or fresh."
Lungren said the inadequacy of the
anticoagulation drugs had reached the
point "where I was beginning to feel a
paradoxical effect; that is, an inability
to properly anticoagulate with oral
medication."
The doctor emphasized that if the
hospital was incapable of proving
adequate anticoagulation orally, "then
the possibility of surgical intervention
must be considered."
The doctor did not indicate what
surgical procedures might be involved.
A hospital spokesman said Nixon
may be released in a few days.
