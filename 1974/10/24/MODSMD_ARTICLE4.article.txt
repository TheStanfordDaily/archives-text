# Closson: 'Research Damages Advising'
## 
### JOHN BIGELOW First of Two Parts 
Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies B. Michael Closson says that
despite numerous improvements and
alterations in recent years, the
undergraduate advising system is being
damaged by the University's emphasis
on research rather than on teaching.
Pointing to the research-oriented
nature of the University as one source
of difficulty, Closson said, "Advisors
just don't have the time or initiative
to devote to advising, because they are
rewarded with promotions and
recognition while their efficacy as
teachers is all but ignored."
This "system of rewards and
sanctions" is a grave obstruction to
every facet of undergraduate
education at Stanford, Closson adds.
"Advising is part of teaching, and
because teaching is downgraded,
advising is downgraded," he says.

Closson suggests that if the
University intends to be a research
institution rather than a liberal arts
school, the Admissions Office should
"observe truth in packaging. They
should tell prospective applicants that
they have to look out for themselves,
they have to be self-motivated, and
that they won't get much help here in
the way of advising."
That's closer to reality, he
contends, than giving the applicant the
impression that he can easily
develop one-to-one relationships with
professors here. "I'd love to have a
liberal arts college, but that's not what
we are," he laments.
Would Prefer Reforms
Closson, however, would prefer
University reforms to improve on a
student's experience rather than
abandoning the liberal arts image.
Elizabeth Meyer, asst. director of
the academic information center

(AIC), which coordinates
undergraduate advising, calls being an
advisor a "thankless job." All advisors
are volunteers, and receive no
compensation for their efforts.
Others point to problems on a
smaller level. "The advisor's role is
seen very differently by different
people," says Sylvia Larsen, asst.
director of admissions and a freshman
advisor herself. She thinks personal
interaction with her advisees is of
utmost importance. In addition, she is
disturbed by accounts of students
never even seeing their advisors. "I see
the system as being successful, but I
think some advisors should take a
more personal role. It's important to
go beyond the academic experience."
Role Is Academic
Civil Engineering Prof. Henry
Parker, however, sees his role as
academic in nature. "All we do is
make sure students don't close doors,"
he says, pointing out he feels his
responsibility is to give sound advice
concerning academic careers.
The Administration has tried to
adjust this lack of uniformity. For
example, advisor workshops were held
before registration this fall, and
advisors were offered a little advice
themselves. Assoc. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Mason Yearian,
coordinated the event, and feels it was
successful. "I'm certain we'll do it
next year," he says. The workshop
focused on "typical" problems of both
the student and the advisor.
Yearian is involved in yet another
project to reform the advising system.
He hopes to increase communication
between his office and the various
departmental advising committees.
Autonomous Advising Systems
At present, once a atudent declares
a major he is assigned a new advisor by
the department. The departmental
advising systems are autonomous of
Yearian's office and both their
inconsistency in method and their
tendency to aim advising efforts
exclusively toward their own
upperclass majors are hindrances,
according to Yearian.
Due to the autonomy of the
departments, Yearian's only choice is
to wait for the various departments to
invite him over to parlay. He voiced a
plea to each department to do as Asst.
Economics Prof. Bruce Owen did last
Friday. He invited Yearian over to
discuss departmental advising in the
first of what Yearian hopes will be a
series of such meetings.
The problems he perceives in some
departmental programs include a belief
on the part of some that facts are the
most important concerns in advising
and the indifference toward
prospective majors.
"Underclassmen without a major
have less expertise in getting questions
answered, but often the departments
neglect to offer them advice. We
would hope they'll set up something
that would be of benefit to
prospective majors."

he says, pointing out he feels his
responsibility is to give sound advice
concerning academic careers.
The Administration has tried to
adjust this lack of uniformity. For
example, advisor workshops were held
before registration this fall, and
advisors were offered a little advice
themselves. Assoc. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Mason Yearian,
coordinated the event, and feels it was
successful. "I'm certain we'll do it
next year," he says. The workshop
focused on "typical" problems of both
the student and the advisor.
Yearian is involved in yet another
project to reform the advising system.
He hopes to increase communication
between his office and the various
departmental advising committees.
Autonomous Advising Systems
At present, once a atudent declares
a major he is assigned a new advisor by
the department. The departmental
advising systems are autonomous of
Yearian's office and both their
inconsistency in method and their
tendency to aim advising efforts
exclusively toward their own
upperclass majors are hindrances,
according to Yearian.
Due to the autonomy of the
departments, Yearian's only choice is
to wait for the various departments to
invite him over to parlay. He voiced a
plea to each department to do as Asst.
Economics Prof. Bruce Owen did last
Friday. He invited Yearian over to
discuss departmental advising in the
first of what Yearian hopes will be a
series of such meetings.
The problems he perceives in some
departmental programs include a belief
on the part of some that facts are the
most important concerns in advising
and the indifference toward
prospective majors.
"Underclassmen without a major
have less expertise in getting questions
answered, but often the departments
neglect to offer them advice. We
would hope they'll set up something
that would be of benefit to
prospective majors."


B. Michael Closson
Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies B. Michael Closson says that
despite numerous improvements and
alterations in recent years, the
undergraduate advising system is being
damaged by the University's emphasis
on research rather than on teaching.
Pointing to the research-oriented
nature of the University as one source
of difficulty, Closson said, "Advisors
just don't have the time or initiative
to devote to advising, because they are
rewarded with promotions and
recognition while their efficacy as
teachers is all but ignored."
This "system of rewards and
sanctions" is a grave obstruction to
every facet of undergraduate
education at Stanford, Closson adds.
"Advising is part of teaching, and
because teaching is downgraded,
advising is downgraded," he says.

Closson suggests that if the
University intends to be a research
institution rather than a liberal arts
school, the Admissions Office should
"observe truth in packaging. They
should tell prospective applicants that
they have to look out for themselves,
they have to be self-motivated, and
that they won't get much help here in
the way of advising."
That's closer to reality, he
contends, than giving the applicant the
impression that he can easily
develop one-to-one relationships with
professors here. "I'd love to have a
liberal arts college, but that's not what
we are," he laments.
Would Prefer Reforms
Closson, however, would prefer
University reforms to improve on a
student's experience rather than
abandoning the liberal arts image.
