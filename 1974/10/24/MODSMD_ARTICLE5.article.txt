# Watergate Dims Dominick's Senate Hopes
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS News Analysis 
Colorado voters are giving credence to the
contention that Watergate has changed the
course of American politics.
Gary Hart, 36, manager of the 1972
McGovern campaign and an incarnation of the
"New Politics" is favored to defeat popular,
two-term Sen. Peter H. Dominick in a state
noted for its ruralism Republicanism and
conservatism.
Various national media and Dominick
partisans insist that Hart has tailored his views
to fit Colorado's political temperament and
claim that most voters are unaware of Hart's ties
to McGovern.
But Hart's aides vigorously deny that their
candidate has "abandoned abrasive liberal
ideology" to don a "bland moderate facade" as
columist Rowland Evans has charged. They
contend that Hart never entirely agreed with
McGovern and is finding Watergate weary
Colorado citizens receptive to ideas
misunderstood two years ago.

With Dominick trailing by 14 points,
according to a recent Denver Post survey, GOP
strategists are emphasizing Hart's youth, alleged
political inexperience, and McGovern
connections. They also note that he won only
38 percent of the State Democratic primary
vote.
Hart, a Kansas native, has resided in Colorado
only since 1968 and, according to the careful
calculations of Dominick publicists, has spent
only 4V2 years actually within the state. Dominick
is emphasizing this fact heavily.
Dominick also accuses Hart of ignoring the
senator's liberal legislative record. Dominick
points out that he has sponsored Senate bills for
vocational training and bilingual programs and
has urged the Environmental Protection Agency
to monitor extraction of Colorado's oil shale.

While commending Dominick's progressive
proposals, Hart contends that his opponent
hasn't gone nearly far enough. He has attacked
Dominick's environmental record, noting that
the incumbent supported the Allen
Amendment, which gutted the federal strip
mining bill.
Emphasizes Poor Ratings
Hart also,emphasizes that the Environmental
Defense Fund has given Dominick low ratings of
33 percent, 11 percent and six percent over the
last three years.
As an Interior Department employee, Hart
authored the first Clean Air Act, a fact he is
repeating on his forays throughout the state.
Hart has also stresses those positions on
which he claims McGovern was wrongly labelled
a radical. Most notably, he has attacked the
welfare system, calling for more jobtraining
programs and proposing a "national job bank"
to help people find employment.
Economic Proposals
In addition to urging cuts in the defense
budget, Hart advocates restoration of a truly
competitive market system by breaking up
conglomerates.
Dominick counters Hart's economic
proposals by pointing out that he is the ranking
Republican on the Senate's powerful new
Budget Committee. The committee will
coordinate Congress' appropriations activities
and, according to Dominick, will act as a major
restraint on inflation.
Claiming that he is in a better position than
any Senate Republican to effectively grapple
with inflation, Dominick is telling voters that it
would be unwise to unseat such a powerful
figure.
Attacks Bond Loopholes
Dominick has also attacked Hart's plan to cut
loopholes on municiple bond interest.
Dominick's aides claim that 85 mayors have
written to Dominick headquarters expressing
fear that Hart's proposal would bankrupt
Colorado towns.
Political intrigue has figured as only a minor
issue in the campaign. During the primary, Hart
emphasized Dominick's nebulous ties to the

so-called "milk fund," handing out cartons at
the state Democratic convention.
As chairman of the Republican Senatorial
Campaign Committee in 1972, Dominick
received contributions from milk producers, an
action that involved no illegality. He later gave
some of the unused funds to Nixon re election
committee finance chairman Maurice Stans, but
•reported the transaction.
Special Prosecutor Investigating
After an investigation of the matter, Hart
turned his information over to the Watergate
Special Prosecutor's Office, where the case is
still pending, according to William Holen, a Hart
aide.
Because no wrong-doing by Dominick has
ever been proven, Hart has largely dropped the
issue.
Dominick, an advocate of conditional
amnesty for deserters and draft evaders, has
accused Hart of deceiving voters about his stand
on amnesty. Hart says he supports conditional
amnesty, but Dominick claims that he
supported blanket amnesty until he ran for the
Senate. Hart denies the charge, claiming that he
disagreed with McGovern's call in 1972 for total
amnesty. But Hart's protests have left organized
veterans' groups largely unconvinced and several
veterans' leaders are working hard to re-elect
Dominick.
Heavy Media Campaign
In order to over come his apparent electoral
disadvantage, Dominick plans to spend about
$400,000 in a heavy media campaign. Hart
hopes to raise and spend a maximum of
$200,000. According to some sources, Hart is
having trouble soliciting money from organized
labor because union leaders regard him as a
certain victor.
Hart, in stumping the state, is speaking to
small groups, especially in rural areas
traditional Republican strongholds. Both
candidates are struggling to win over the state's
large block of independent voters. Dominick is
relying heavily upon name recognition and 12
years of Senate service to help him on election
day.
The thrust in the last days of the Dominick

campaign is the charge that if elected, Hart will
abandon the moderacy of his campaign and join
Colorado Sen. Floyd Haskell as a voice of the
new liberalism.
Perhaps Dominick's main worry is not that
Colorado voters won't believe the charge, but
rather that they don't care if Hart is a liberal.
