Alan Cranston

We strongly urge the re-election of Alan Cranston to the United
States Senate. We believe that Cranston has done a remarkable job for
a freshman legislator, and unquestionably deserves a chance to
continue in office. He was labeled as one of the five most effective
members of the Senate by Ralph Nader's Congress Project in 1972.
We can only begin to list the number of worthwhile things
Cranston has done during his first term. He has supported increased
federal aid to education, and believes that the federal government
should pay up to one-third of a student's educational costs.
He has introduced legislation to blockfurther oil drilling along the
California coast from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border.
In the area of housing, Cranston was co-author of the
Cranston-Brooke Housing Act just signed into law which makes
available $lO billion in federally backed mortgages for low- and
medium-cost housing. This bill will allow the construction of many
new low- and medium-cost homes.
In 1970, the senator co-authored the first legislation ever to pass
the Senate to cut off funds for the Vietnam War. He has consistently
been in favor of scaling down American military commitments
overseas, and as one of the leading advocates of trimming the
Pentagon's budget, he has argued that "the negotiation thorugh
strength approach is discredited by both experience and by common
sense."
Cranston has also been a vocal supporter of national health
insurance, and was one of the first backers of Cesar Chavez and the
migrant farm workers.
In stark contrast to Cranston, his opponent, state Sen. H. L.
Richardson (R-Arcadia), has a completely regressive record.
Richardson is a former member of the John Birch Society and has
taken a very hard line on law and order. He boasts that he was the
leader of the initiative to restore the death penalty passed by
California voters in 1972, and was a principal co-author of California's
new death penalty law. He has advocated greater amounts of hard
labor for California prisoners, claiming that "nothing helps cure a sick
mind more than a tired body."
Richardson has voted against every appropriations measure to aid
education in the state, including votes against funding for the
University of California system.
On the subject of the economy, Richardson said he would even
accept a depression as away of straightening out the imbalances and
imperfections in our present economic system.
He has been in the forefront of anti-busing activity in the state, and
has argued that the best way to solve the energy crisis would be to
leave the oil companies completely unregulated.
Finally, Richardson wants to maintain an extravagant military
budget so that Russia and China will be "deterred from their plans for
world domination."
The issues are clear. The choice is clear. There is no question that
Alan Cranston deserves to be re-elected.

William Norris

We urge voters to support Democrat William Norris in his bid to
unseat incumbent Republican Evelle J. Younger in the attorney
general race.
Younger's tenure has been marked by attempts at
headline-grabbing in his attacks on terrorist activities. One such
report, "Terrorism in California" used scare tactics, while grossly
exaggerating terrorist activity within the state.
Recenlty, Younger predicted "an era of superviolence" by terrorist
groups, commencing during the nation's 200th birthday celebration.
Such comments only spread fear and do little to combat crime.
Younger has constantly sought measures that would prevent
certain criminals from receiving probation, based on the crime. He has
also supported the death penalty and criminal penalties for victimless
crimes.
Norris, on the other hand, opposes the death penalty and supports
decriminalization of "crimes" involving consenting adults.
Specifically, Norris supports repeal of laws which govern private
sexual conduct, ban possession of marijuana and prohibit
noncommercial gambling among friends.
He also favors treating drunkenness through detoxificiation
programs rather than as criminal matters and removing all but serious
traffic violations from the criminal courts.
All of these measures would save time and money, which could be
used more effectively to combat other crimes.

William Bagley

In the race for state controller, we endorse William Bagley,
republican assemblyman from Marin County.
During his tenure in the state legislature, Bagley has accomplished a
great deal, particularly in areas oÂ£ tax reform. Just as important, he
has been one of the few Republican officials who have come through
eight years of Reganism with their principles still intact. Bagley has
shown himself to be a man of integrity and competence two virtues
that are to be especially treasured in the state's chief fiscal officer.
Bagley's Democratic opponent, Assemblyman Kenneth Cory of
Orange County, parlayed a generally unjustified slogan and a
questionable campaign financing apparatus into his party's
nomination. His self-appointed appellation of "The Man the Oil
Companies Fear Most," along with the fact that two wealthy
supporters established a half-million dollar war chest for him, are
hardly qualifications for the office he seeks.
William Bagley is the kind of Republican the state could use more
of. We think he will make an honest, responsible controller.
