# On Ford's Failure To Plan Ah ead
## 
### Stephen Carter 
When Gerald Ford, the newly appointed
President of the United States, finished his
uninspiring economic address to Congress, he
took off his WIN (for "Whip Inflation Now")
button and gave it to the House doorman, a
long time friend.
Not long thereafter, Sen. Charles Percy
(R-Ill.) asked the White House if he could
have one, to wear during a television
appearance. After all, hadn't the President
suggested that every American wear one?
Unfortunately, the White House didn't
have any more. So the President asked the
surprised doorman to return the button,
which he then lent to Percy. Then Percy, too,
had to return it, so that President Ford could
wear the button during his press conference.
It seems the White House had the buttons
on order, but they just hadn't come in. Now
that several hundred thousand of the buttons
have arrived, labor leaders are refusing to
wear them, and are urging the rank-and-file
to do the same. Seems the buttons weren't
prepared at a union shop.
The incident of the White House WIN
button merely illustrates a recurring theme in
the Ford administration: a failure to plan
ahead.
Strong Support Early
Shortly after Ford came into office in
August, the first public opinion polls came
out. Depending on which figures you
hccepted, something from 71 to 76 percent
of the American people approved of the way
Ford "handled his job." Undoubtedly, these
people would have been hard pressed to
come up with something Ford had done.
After an uneventful opening month, Ford
pardoned former President Nixon early on a
Sunday morning. Although many have
charged the pardon was part of a deal, the
evidence of that is scanty at best. All the
pardon really was, was unjust and stupid.
Gerald Ford, allegedly a sophisticated and
experienced politician, had made the first of
several gross political blunders. He expected

opposition he didn't expect to drop 30
percentage points in the next polls. A
staunch conservative with views in keeping
with those of the former Nixon advisors
whom he has refused to dismiss, Ford
undoubtedly really thought he could "put
Watergate behind us."
So without consulting the Special
Prosecutor's office, and after a token and
superficial memorandum of opinion from the
Justice Department, the President extended
the pardon, saying he had considered the
former President's health as well'as the
country's well-being.
Concerned For Nation?
But when Ford made his "historic"
appearance before a Congressional
subcommittee last week undoubtedly
hoping that the occasion's significance would
blunt the impact of whatever he might say
he retracted this statement, explaining that
the good of the nation had been his only
concern.
As the Nixon administration had
discovered sometime before, failure-to plan
ahead often renders statements
"inoperative."
Ford probably had his "earned re-entry"
plan which the news media inexplicably
insists on calling "conditional amnesty"
ready at the same time as the pardon. But
after one set of adverse reactions, he must
have feared another setback.
When the firestorm died down, Ford
announced the plan. This, too, met with
criticism from all sides. The conservatives
who believed dying for Nguyen Van Thieu
more important than standing up for beliefs
called it too lenient; the liberals who saw a
good campaign issue building called it too
harsh. Again, the reputedly astute politician
had blundered.
Nomination An Insult
The nomination of Nelson Rockefeller for
the Vice Presidency was an insult and should
have been treated as such. However, his

actions concerning Attica and his fight for
New York's ridiculous drug law had
apparently been forgotten.
But newspapers and broadcast media,
after their initial praise and fawning, have
finally gotten around to the investigative
work which, especially after Watergate, is
supposed to be their forte. Thus,
Rockefeller's enormous gifts to such
"friends" as Henry Kissinger and William
Ronan, as well as to New York State have
belatedly been revealed.
Did Ford fail, a la George McGovern, to
make an attempt to discover anything in his
potential Vice President's background which
might cause political embarassment and is
he now behind the nominee "1000 percent"?
Not 'Politically Sophisticated'?
Of course, it could be that Ford is not so
politically sophisticated after all.
Could it be that his original election in
1948 came not as a tribute to Jerry Ford, the
politician, but to Jerry Ford, the Michigan
football star? Could the ever-popular Sen.
Arthur Vandenberg's endorsement which
was simply a part of the latter's efforts to
defeat Ford's opponent, Bartel Jonkman, a
troubling member of the Foreign Relations
Committee have been decisive?
And could it be that Ford's ascension to
the Minority Leader spot in 1965 was more a
measure of respect for Bob Griffin, Mel
Laird, Charles Goodell and the other leaders
of the movement which had dumped former
leader Charley Halleck of Indiana, than for
Ford himself?
Could it be that his apparently
outstanding political record is actually one of
jumping on the bandwagon and not one
involving political foresight? His
"achievements" thus far would seem to say
"yes."

surprised doorman to return the button,
which he then lent to Percy. Then Percy, too,
had to return it, so that President Ford could
wear the button during his press conference.
It seems the White House had the buttons
on order, but they just hadn't come in. Now
that several hundred thousand of the buttons
have arrived, labor leaders are refusing to
wear them, and are urging the rank-and-file
to do the same. Seems the buttons weren't
prepared at a union shop.
The incident of the White House WIN
button merely illustrates a recurring theme in
the Ford administration: a failure to plan
ahead.
Strong Support Early
Shortly after Ford came into office in
August, the first public opinion polls came
out. Depending on which figures you
hccepted, something from 71 to 76 percent
of the American people approved of the way
Ford "handled his job." Undoubtedly, these
people would have been hard pressed to
come up with something Ford had done.
After an uneventful opening month, Ford
pardoned former President Nixon early on a
Sunday morning. Although many have
charged the pardon was part of a deal, the
evidence of that is scanty at best. All the
pardon really was, was unjust and stupid.
Gerald Ford, allegedly a sophisticated and
experienced politician, had made the first of
several gross political blunders. He expected

opposition he didn't expect to drop 30
percentage points in the next polls. A
staunch conservative with views in keeping
with those of the former Nixon advisors
whom he has refused to dismiss, Ford
undoubtedly really thought he could "put
Watergate behind us."
So without consulting the Special
Prosecutor's office, and after a token and
superficial memorandum of opinion from the
Justice Department, the President extended
the pardon, saying he had considered the
former President's health as well'as the
country's well-being.
Concerned For Nation?
But when Ford made his "historic"
appearance before a Congressional
subcommittee last week undoubtedly
hoping that the occasion's significance would
blunt the impact of whatever he might say
he retracted this statement, explaining that
the good of the nation had been his only
concern.
As the Nixon administration had
discovered sometime before, failure-to plan
ahead often renders statements
"inoperative."
Ford probably had his "earned re-entry"
plan which the news media inexplicably
insists on calling "conditional amnesty"
ready at the same time as the pardon. But
after one set of adverse reactions, he must
have feared another setback.
When the firestorm died down, Ford
announced the plan. This, too, met with
criticism from all sides. The conservatives
who believed dying for Nguyen Van Thieu
more important than standing up for beliefs
called it too lenient; the liberals who saw a
good campaign issue building called it too
harsh. Again, the reputedly astute politician
had blundered.
Nomination An Insult
The nomination of Nelson Rockefeller for
the Vice Presidency was an insult and should
have been treated as such. However, his

actions concerning Attica and his fight for
New York's ridiculous drug law had
apparently been forgotten.
But newspapers and broadcast media,
after their initial praise and fawning, have
finally gotten around to the investigative
work which, especially after Watergate, is
supposed to be their forte. Thus,
Rockefeller's enormous gifts to such
"friends" as Henry Kissinger and William
Ronan, as well as to New York State have
belatedly been revealed.
Did Ford fail, a la George McGovern, to
make an attempt to discover anything in his
potential Vice President's background which
might cause political embarassment and is
he now behind the nominee "1000 percent"?
Not 'Politically Sophisticated'?
Of course, it could be that Ford is not so
politically sophisticated after all.
Could it be that his original election in
1948 came not as a tribute to Jerry Ford, the
politician, but to Jerry Ford, the Michigan
football star? Could the ever-popular Sen.
Arthur Vandenberg's endorsement which
was simply a part of the latter's efforts to
defeat Ford's opponent, Bartel Jonkman, a
troubling member of the Foreign Relations
Committee have been decisive?
And could it be that Ford's ascension to
the Minority Leader spot in 1965 was more a
measure of respect for Bob Griffin, Mel
Laird, Charles Goodell and the other leaders
of the movement which had dumped former
leader Charley Halleck of Indiana, than for
Ford himself?
Could it be that his apparently
outstanding political record is actually one of
jumping on the bandwagon and not one
involving political foresight? His
"achievements" thus far would seem to say
"yes."

When Gerald Ford, the newly appointed
President of the United States, finished his
uninspiring economic address to Congress, he
took off his WIN (for "Whip Inflation Now")
button and gave it to the House doorman, a
long time friend.
Not long thereafter, Sen. Charles Percy
(R-Ill.) asked the White House if he could
have one, to wear during a television
appearance. After all, hadn't the President
suggested that every American wear one?

button merely illustrates a recurring theme in
the Ford administration: a failure to plan
ahead.
Strong Support Early
Shortly after Ford came into office in
August, the first public opinion polls came
out. Depending on which figures you
hccepted, something from 71 to 76 percent
of the American people approved of the way
Ford "handled his job." Undoubtedly, these
people would have been hard pressed to
come up with something Ford had done.
After an uneventful opening month, Ford
pardoned former President Nixon early on a
Sunday morning. Although many have
charged the pardon was part of a deal, the
evidence of that is scanty at best. All the
pardon really was, was unjust and stupid.
Gerald Ford, allegedly a sophisticated and
experienced politician, had made the first of
several gross political blunders. He expected

opposition he didn't expect to drop 30
percentage points in the next polls. A
staunch conservative with views in keeping
with those of the former Nixon advisors
whom he has refused to dismiss, Ford
undoubtedly really thought he could "put
Watergate behind us."
So without consulting the Special
Prosecutor's office, and after a token and
superficial memorandum of opinion from the
Justice Department, the President extended
the pardon, saying he had considered the
former President's health as well'as the
country's well-being.
Concerned For Nation?
But when Ford made his "historic"
appearance before a Congressional
subcommittee last week undoubtedly
hoping that the occasion's significance would
blunt the impact of whatever he might say
he retracted this statement, explaining that
the good of the nation had been his only
concern.
As the Nixon administration had
discovered sometime before, failure-to plan
ahead often renders statements
"inoperative."
Ford probably had his "earned re-entry"
plan which the news media inexplicably
insists on calling "conditional amnesty"
ready at the same time as the pardon. But
after one set of adverse reactions, he must
have feared another setback.
When the firestorm died down, Ford
announced the plan. This, too, met with
criticism from all sides. The conservatives
who believed dying for Nguyen Van Thieu
more important than standing up for beliefs
called it too lenient; the liberals who saw a
good campaign issue building called it too
harsh. Again, the reputedly astute politician
had blundered.
Nomination An Insult
The nomination of Nelson Rockefeller for
the Vice Presidency was an insult and should
have been treated as such. However, his

actions concerning Attica and his fight for
New York's ridiculous drug law had
apparently been forgotten.
But newspapers and broadcast media,
after their initial praise and fawning, have
finally gotten around to the investigative
work which, especially after Watergate, is
supposed to be their forte. Thus,
Rockefeller's enormous gifts to such
"friends" as Henry Kissinger and William
Ronan, as well as to New York State have
belatedly been revealed.
Did Ford fail, a la George McGovern, to
make an attempt to discover anything in his
potential Vice President's background which
might cause political embarassment and is
he now behind the nominee "1000 percent"?
Not 'Politically Sophisticated'?
Of course, it could be that Ford is not so
politically sophisticated after all.
Could it be that his original election in
1948 came not as a tribute to Jerry Ford, the
politician, but to Jerry Ford, the Michigan
football star? Could the ever-popular Sen.
Arthur Vandenberg's endorsement which
was simply a part of the latter's efforts to
defeat Ford's opponent, Bartel Jonkman, a
troubling member of the Foreign Relations
Committee have been decisive?
And could it be that Ford's ascension to
the Minority Leader spot in 1965 was more a
measure of respect for Bob Griffin, Mel
Laird, Charles Goodell and the other leaders
of the movement which had dumped former
leader Charley Halleck of Indiana, than for
Ford himself?
Could it be that his apparently
outstanding political record is actually one of
jumping on the bandwagon and not one
involving political foresight? His
"achievements" thus far would seem to say
"yes."

When Gerald Ford, the newly appointed
President of the United States, finished his
uninspiring economic address to Congress, he
took off his WIN (for "Whip Inflation Now")
button and gave it to the House doorman, a
long time friend.
Not long thereafter, Sen. Charles Percy
(R-Ill.) asked the White House if he could
have one, to wear during a television
appearance. After all, hadn't the President
suggested that every American wear one?
Unfortunately, the White House didn't
have any more. So the President asked the
surprised doorman to return the button,
which he then lent to Percy. Then Percy, too,
had to return it, so that President Ford could
wear the button during his press conference.
It seems the White House had the buttons
on order, but they just hadn't come in. Now
that several hundred thousand of the buttons
have arrived, labor leaders are refusing to
wear them, and are urging the rank-and-file
to do the same. Seems the buttons weren't
prepared at a union shop.
