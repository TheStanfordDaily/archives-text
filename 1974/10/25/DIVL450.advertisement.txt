AKADAMA MAMA ASKS,
PLACE A FACE ON THE PUMPKIN
OR WHATEVER.
Been getting some heavy mail lately
and since it merits a personal answer
rather than a media one this is a good
opportunity to.have a kinda soft, low key
multi-contest. Next to a down home holi
day turkey stuffing or a live Christmas
tree decorated without any store bought
glop, I've always enjoyed the wherewithal
of creativity that goes into a Halloween
pumpkin. So if you place a face on the
little pumpkin to your right, I'll have a
sculptor friend pick out a few of her favor
ites and sculpt them up. Then if I can
borrow a decent camera I'll send the lucky
few some choice shots of their sculpted
pumpkin and statuesque sculptor.
There will also be small
but well thought out prizes for: H
