The Beogram 3000
One part of a system developed to
reproduce sound as it is.
The Beogram 3000 is an integrated, automatic
turntable offering utter simplicity of operation
and elegant, understated design. All functions
are handled by a single master control: the
choice of record size automatically selects the
correct speed (33 or 45 rpm), a slight touch of
the center disk places the stylus tip in the first
groove of the record. When the selection is
completed, the tone arm automatically returns
to its rest position and shuts off the unit.
The tone arm pivots on hardened steel bear
ings for low horizontal friction. An ingenious
system of inclined planes automatically applies
the correct amount of anti-skating force as the
tone arm travels across the record. A pendulum
suspension system isolates the stylus from
external vibrations a,rid acoustic feedback.
As a turntable must operate in concert with
the cartridge, the Beogram 3000 has been engi
neered to utilize Bang & Olufsen cartridges. The
integration of tone arm and cartridge provides a
lower dynamic mass, thus reducing the force
required to move the stylus tip, and eliminates
unwanted resonances. Bang & Olufsen car
tridges have been acknowledged as being
among the world's finest.
