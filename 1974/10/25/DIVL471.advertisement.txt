ATTENTION: ALL SHOPLIFTERS,
THEIVES. RIPOFF ARTISTS. CUSTOMERS - BOTH REAL & POTENTIAL. AS YOU KNOW WE SELL OUR
£3 77
RECORDS FOR " * &AT THAT PRICE OUR PROFIT MARGIN IS TO SAY THE LEAST
NOT THE BIGGEST IN THE WORLD. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE REAL SAVINGS IS PASSED ONTO
YOU, JOE CUSTOMER. NOW, WHEN WE ARE RIPPED OFF (& WE HAVE BEEN) WE ARE FORCED TO
THINK OF RAISING OUR PRICES TO COVER THE COST OF BEING RIPPED OFF, & EVEN MORE
DRASTIC, WE THINK OF CLOSING OUR DOORS & SAYING GOODBYE TO BEAUTIFUL REDWOOD CITY
(FACT: 9 OF 10 NEW SMALL BUSINESSES THAT OPEN iN THIS HERE U.S. OF A. FAIL WITHIN ONE
YEAR. SOURCE: sba) WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS. IN FACT, WE LI KE IT HERE. WE ARE REALLY
TRYING TO HELP YOU PEOPLE FIGHT INFLATION. HENCE THE $3.77 INSTEAD OF $4.66 LIKE AT
OTHER RECORD STORES (WHO SHALL GO NAMELESS BUT I WONDER WHERE THEY COULD BE, & I
HOPE THAT I DON'T SLIP ON A BANANA PEEL NEAR HOOVER TOWER. PS - I WONDER WHERE I CAN
GET A DISCOUNT??) BUT (I AM SERIOUS) IF WE DO GET RIPPED OFF, THEN WE WILL CLOSE, & YOU
WILL BE FORCED TO DRIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE, PAY A HIGHER PRICE & WONDER WHY REDWOOD
CITY CAN'T SUPPORT A RECORD STORE. OR IN OTHER WORDS TO YOU POTENTIAL RIPOFF ARTISTS
BOTH REAL & POTENTIAL (TWICE IN ONE LINE, SHOULDN'T DO THAT) YOU MERELY CUT YOUR
OWN THROAT & THAT OF EVERYONE ELSE. "(WE MUST ALL HANG TOGETHER OR WE WILL HANG
SEPARATELY" - BEN FRANKLIN 1776). THANKS - D.J. RECORDS
