PEACE CORPS
CUTS THE RED TAPE
How? By "pre-slotting" a new way of placing Volunteers in
the Peace Corps, being introduced at Stanford for the first time
next week.
What it means is this: by the time your interview with the
Peace Corps / VISTA recruiter-placement officer is over, you'll
know whether the Peace Corps can use you, what specific job
assignment is available that fits your background and skill,
where it is, what you'd be doing, and when you'd start. And the
decision would be made then and there {subject to your
references checking out) not after three to five months of red
tape and paper shuffling in Washington.
"Pre-slotting" is being tried on an experimental basis for
Peace Corps programs in twelve Latin-American countries
only. If it works (and it has worked for VISTA), it will be ex
panded to 51 other countries. Meanwhile, if you're interested in
one of these other countries, you can still apply in the regular
way (you'll know within six to eight weeks whether you've been
accepted, then a month prior to your availability date you'll get
details on the program you're being invited to).
The following are some of the skills being "pre-slotted":
* Marine Biology
Accounting
Business Administration
Physical Education
Special Education
* Chemistry
Architecture
* Engineering (Civil, Chem., Elec., Ind.)
Library Science
Social Work
Psychology
Urban Design
Nursing
( * Included some university level teaching
positions requiring an M.A. or Ph.D.)
Contact the Placement Office for an interview appointment if
you're interested in a Peace Corps "pre-slotted" assignment.
Or, if you just want to know more about Peace Corps or VISTA
in general, stop by the booth in White Plaza next week.
