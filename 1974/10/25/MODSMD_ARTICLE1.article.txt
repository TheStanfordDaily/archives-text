# Ex-Astronaut Mitchell Urges Mind Expansion
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
Only a greatly increased
understanding of the human mind's
capacity can save society from total
collapse or a takeover by an
authoritarian leadership witljin'"the
next two centuries, parapsychological
researcher and former Apollo
astronaut Edgar Mitchell told an
overflow Bishop Auditorium crowd
last night.
"We are trying to confront sudden,
constant change with ideals of the
human mind that have been around
for more than two thousand years in
Judeo-Christian society," he said.
"I think there is more to life than
something that can be explained by
putting one molecule on top of
another," he continued. "But science
can't tell us what it is ? and philosophy
and theology simply haven't kept up
with progress."
Mitchell, who became the sixth
man to step on the moon's surface
during the 1971 Apollo 14 mission,
said he founded the Institute of Noetic
Sciences in Palo Alto when he
considered "the vast untapped wisdom
and knowledge that exist within us."
The ex-astronaut said that a paper
recently published in the British
scientific magazine Nature gives "good
statistical evidence" that extra-sensory
channels of perception exist.
"The ESP experiments that we did
in space, in which we used standard
visual signals, produced results that
had a one-in-3000 chance of occuring
at random, but we don't use those
techniques any more," Mitchell stated.
Mitchell discounted recent
suggestions that psychics like Uri
Geller actually perform no more than
standard magician's tricks. "If you
don't let magicians get their hands on
what they're working with, they can't
use any tricks," he noted.

"I do believe that practicing
psychics like Geller do use sleight of
hand to please their audiences,"
said. "Most of our experimental results
can be duplicated by a few tricks, but
the important thing is that they can be
produced solely by channels of
perception.
"I like to use the statement of a
fellow worker in parapsychology," he
added. "She says, 'God sleeps in the
minerals, awakes in the plants, walks
in the animals and thinks in man.' "

considered "the vast untapped wisdom
and knowledge that exist within us."
The ex-astronaut said that a paper
recently published in the British
scientific magazine Nature gives "good
statistical evidence" that extra-sensory
channels of perception exist.
"The ESP experiments that we did
in space, in which we used standard
visual signals, produced results that
had a one-in-3000 chance of occuring
at random, but we don't use those
techniques any more," Mitchell stated.
Mitchell discounted recent
suggestions that psychics like Uri
Geller actually perform no more than
standard magician's tricks. "If you
don't let magicians get their hands on
what they're working with, they can't
use any tricks," he noted.

"I do believe that practicing
psychics like Geller do use sleight of
hand to please their audiences,"
said. "Most of our experimental results
can be duplicated by a few tricks, but
the important thing is that they can be
produced solely by channels of
perception.
"I like to use the statement of a
fellow worker in parapsychology," he
added. "She says, 'God sleeps in the
minerals, awakes in the plants, walks
in the animals and thinks in man.' "

SPACED OUT—Ex-astronaut Edgar Mitchell spoke to a packed house at Bishop
Auditorium last night, declaring that "there is more to life than something that
can be explained by putting one molecule on top of another."
Only a greatly increased
understanding of the human mind's
capacity can save society from total
collapse or a takeover by an
authoritarian leadership witljin'"the
next two centuries, parapsychological
researcher and former Apollo
astronaut Edgar Mitchell told an
overflow Bishop Auditorium crowd
last night.
"We are trying to confront sudden,
constant change with ideals of the
human mind that have been around
for more than two thousand years in
Judeo-Christian society," he said.
"I think there is more to life than
something that can be explained by
putting one molecule on top of
another," he continued. "But science
can't tell us what it is ? and philosophy
and theology simply haven't kept up
with progress."
Mitchell, who became the sixth
man to step on the moon's surface
during the 1971 Apollo 14 mission,
said he founded the Institute of Noetic
Sciences in Palo Alto when he
considered "the vast untapped wisdom
and knowledge that exist within us."
