# B-1 -- A Bomber For Limited War

Extensive military support for the Thieu
Government ✓in South Vietnam, CIA
intervention in Chile and massive sales of
arms to Iran are not isolated incidents of
American involvement in foreign countries.
Rather, they are interconnected examples of
certain patterns which are beginning to
develop in the execution of American foreign
policy after Vietnam.
These operations represent the more
subtle hand of U.S. imperialism. However,
one should not be deceived into thinking that
the makers of foreign policy in this country
have substituted the fine art of persuasion for
the brutal use of raw military power.
Gunboat diplomacy is not dead, it has just
been technically improved. In fact, one could
not be deceived if he looked closely at the
newest dream plane of the Air Force, the B-l
bomber.
The B-l bomber is a supersonic manned
warplane designated to replace the B-52.
Defense Department planners publicly
proclaim that the bomber is being
constructed in order to beef up the nation's
arsenal of security defense weapons, in other
words, as a deterrent to Soviet military
power.
However, their arguments are shot
through with fallacies. The B-52, it has been
estimated, can remain operational for
another 20 years. A replacement is
unnecessary. The Soviet Union presently
maintains an arsenal of strategic bombers
about one-third the size of that of the United
States and shows little sign of attempting to
catch up.

Furthermore, in an age of intercontinental
ballistic missies, a manned bomber for
strategic warfare is obsolete. In the time it
would take the B-1 bomber to reach the
Soviet Union and deliver a payload of nuclear -
weapons, both sides could already have
launched several rounds of missiles.
Bombing The Third World
The Air Force intends the B-1 bomber for ■
a somewhat different use. This new airplane
is seen by logistics experts as the ideal
weapon for use in limited wars such as
Vietnam.
Ranking generals have publicly gloated
that the B-1 bomber could have "buffaloed
the North Vietnamese defenses entirely"
during the Christmas bombing of Hanoi in
1972. The smaller, lighter B-1 could have
flown under the North Vietnamese radar
screens, increasing destruction and reducing
loses. The prospect of the U.S. unleashing
this new weapon on an insurgent Third World
country some time in the future is indeed
frightening.
U.S. policy planners envision the. B-1
bomber as the third line of defense against
the rise of unfriendly governments in Third
World countries. Should the CIA and the
native police forces fail to keep the lid on
domestic dissent and if U.S.-supported armies
fall prey to guerilla forces, the B-1 bomber
can be called in as a last resort. Its awesome
power can be unleashed with very little loss
of American lives and with little
corresponding outcry of citizen dissent.
American military strategists learned
many painful lessons from the Vietnam War.

The 40,000 American deaths and no victory
discredited the validity of infantry combat
with guerilla forces. American strategic
objectives were more successfully achieved
by means such as the CIA sponsored
overthrow of Prince Sihounouk in Cambodia
and, most importantly, by the massive
bombing of the Plain of Jars in Laos.
Political Control
The Plain of Jars was an area of land
inhabited by peasants under the control of
the Pathet Lao, the Laotian Communist
party. In an attempt to reduce the political
control of the Pathet Lao over native
popultions, U.S. air power was unleashed to
make the unfriendly territory literally
uninhabitable. Peasant villages were
destroyed and their residents forced into
refugee camps controlled by the
Pro-American faction in Laos. The bombing
of the Plain of Jars represents a new concept
in warfare, a new method of political control,
executed by sophisticated technological
weapons which fly high in the sky.
The B-l bomber is a technical advance
over the type of plane used in the air attack
of Laos. Its addition to the arsenal of
weaponry puts other countries on notice that
U.S. military might stands behind our
attempts to control their internal political
affairs. Should this new weapon of death be
completed, it will stand as a symbol of the
post-Vietnam years.
