# Media Stereotypes Exploit Women
## 
### Terri Bore hers 
A feature article on an
athlete's balls (that's right, you
read the word correctly, balls)
ensconced in a soft, white jock
strap suspended from his
taut,swarthy waist, or on a
swimmer's cock and balls swaying
back and forth, so barely visible
and coyly hid beneath his speedo,
as he walks to the starting block,
would clearly be in bad-taste and
would not be printed in any
"respectable" publication in the
country. Neither would an article
be printed which focused on an
Asian woman's beautifully
almond. shaped, slanted eyes, or
the cute curve of a black man's
prominent lips which subtly fold
into his well-shaped, but
large-nostrilled, flattened nose.
The Daily feature on Carol
Doda of Oct. 23 has got to be, bar
none, the most disgusting,
exploitative and amateurish article
I have ever read.
Any article that so overtly and
naively focuses on, and describes,
an attribute which in this society
has ybeen seized upon to
distinguish one class from another
(in this case, mammary glands) is
inexcusable. If the article is
supposed to be humorous, which I
don't think the tone consistently
implies, it is about as funny as a
good, swift kick in the crotch.
One might do a feature article
on a male dean but one would not
include a description of his
genitalia. He may not make a
living off of his genitalia as does
Carol Doda off of her mammary
glands, but it is much more
instructive to look at the culture
which "pays" for her behavior
than to look at her "famed
twosome."
Individual Identities
To a large extent women's
individual identities have been
granted them, by men, according
to their physical characteristics.
("That one over there must be
36-24-36!", or, "Did you see the
pair of legs on that one?" Notice
we are still "broads" or "that
bunch of chicks over there,"
unless we have 44-inch tits, or
well-shaped thighs to distinguish
one of us from another.)
Women who choose not to
define themselves, or not to be

defined in this way, struggle daily
to combat this kind of sexual
privatization to enhance their
feelings of self worth in a society
that does not readily reward
women except as sexual objects,
housewives, mothers or other
underpaid or unpaid workers.
Carol Doda is but a particular
manifestation of a male
dominated and identified culture
which exploits people on the basis
of sex and/or class. The exploited
classes are allowed to express their
identities, and to support
themselves, or be supported, only
in ways which cater to and do not
threaten their male oppressors.
Since men are in the positions
of power in this society, they have
the choice of whether to define
themselves, and/or make a living
by their genitalia or other physical
characteristics. Because of their
physical characteristics, women
are oppressed, exploited and
defined as a class and clearly do

not have the same choice.
Lack Of Coverage
The Daily often rationalizes its
lack of coverage of women's
events, such as the women's
Resource Fair or women's
athletics, by saying it doesn't have
enough space. If other women at
Stanford were getting at least
eqba! coverage the Doda article
might have been less offensive
(not withstanding the particular
sexist emphasis on her breasts and
panties).
A member of the Daily staff
also stated the article was
included because there is campus
interest in such a story. How can
one reasonably rationalize, by
citing interest, a story describing
Doda's breasts as two -well-trained
dogs whereas there would be no
story, and therefore no
rationalization, although there
might be interest, about the size
and manipulations of some male
professor's penis?

Affirmative and compensatory
treatment of women by the media
is long overdue. If cultural
stereotypes and sexual
privatization are continually
thrown in people's faces, the
chances for them to learn to see
each other as individuals and
persons in their own right,
regardless of sex, race, creed or
color, will be made infinitely
more difficult.
To say that women's athletics
or features on various women
working at this University are not
as newsworthy as a San Francisco
night club performer is a
monumental cop-out. More and
responsible coverage can, first of
all, help inform the public of what
women without 44-inch breasts
are doing, and secondly, may also
help to create interest in their
activities.
