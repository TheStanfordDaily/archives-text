More On Student Police
Editor:
This note is in response to a
question raised by Vance Thom in
the Oct. 16 Daily. Apparently,
Thom was among other spectators
ousted from their seats before the
Michigan-Stanford football game
by a group of "Student Police."
These ushers are employed by
the Athletic Department and are
under its sole jurisdiction. They
are in no way related to the ASSU
Student Police.
The ASSU Student Police are
employed at ASSU functiops (e.g.
Sunday Flicks, lectures, etc.).
Grievances with ushers at athletic
events should be taken to the
Athletic Department.

Justify 'Sordid Details'
Editor :
I would really like to hear
Christine Douglas and Mark
Simonian justify their respective
decisions to include in their
articles all the sordid details
accompanying the crimes they
were assigned to cover. If a
woman is murdered (Daily, Oct.
14) or molested (Daily, Oct. 22),
isn't it sufficient to say that, and
spare the reader any
comprehensive, graphic
description of exactly what
happened?
What of any real value does the
Daily gain by printing such
things? Surely, there is a place for
either responsibility, sensibility or
discretion in journalism.
Unfortunately, these are virtues
the Daily has yet to acquire.

Statistics
Endorses Gregorio
Editor :
Last year, over 95,000
Californians were arrested on
marijuana charges. Most of them
were first-offenders charged with
possession of a small quantity of
marijuana for their own personal
use. Under existing California law,
all persons arrested for possession
of as little as one marijuana
cigarette receive permanent felony
arrest records arid face up to 10
years in state prison for first
offense.
Stanford students and other
citizens seeking a more rational
and humane approach to
marijuana use have the
opportunity to return to the
California Legislature one of the
legislators who has been at the
forefront of the battle to change
the marijuana laws, Sen. Arlen
Gregorio.
An early backer of the 1972
California Marijuana Initiative
(Prop. 19), Gregorio has served as
the Senate floor leader of
legislation aimed at reducing the
penalties for marijuana possession.
In 1972 and 1974, Gregorio
succeeded in getting such
legislation passed by the
conservative state Senate, only to
have it subsequently vetoed by
Governor Reagan.
With k new governor coming
in, and hopefully some changes in
the composition of the legislature,
meaningful reform of the
marijuana laws is possible ih 1975.
Sen. Arlen Gregorio, who seeks
re-election on Nov. 5, is
committed to such reform, and
deserves the support of all voters
who believe that felony penalties
and state prison sentences for
marijuana users should be
repealed. NORML urges
progressive voters to return Arlen
Gregorio to the state Senate.
