# On Money And Stanford Summers
## 
### Brad Cornell 
To those administrators who
are again decrying the financial
condition of the University
where were you last August?
That's the time when most of the
expensive buildings are locked
tight and dazed graduate students
are the only people to be seen.
Admittedly, I am being slightly
unfair. Stanford does have a
summer session (of sorts) that
ends in mid-August. In fact, if you
look through the summer
catalogue you will find courses
listed with the same computer
number as regular term courses;
the similarity ends there.
Summer courses, which are
jammed into eight weeks, are
often taught by visiting faculty,
who see a summer in Palo Alto as
a much needed vacation, and
attended by a hodge-podge of
bored graduate students and
eastern high schoolers.
If you have the time, glance at
the academic calendar; you will
discover that of the 52 weeks in a

year, 15 weeks (or 29 percent of
the time) are devoted to vacation.
Another eight weeks (15 percent)
are allocated to "summer school."
The 29 weeks reserved for actual
operation of the University are
divided between instruction, 25
weeks (48 percent), exams, 3
weeks (six percent) and
commencement, one week (two
percent).
Inefficient Use
No private business not even
the most successful could
dream of using its capital
(buildings, land and research
facilities) so inefficiently. The
questfon is : can the University
change?
One administrator I spoke with
said students would never accept a
12 month academic schedule; 25
percent could never be enticed
into attending school in the
summer. He forgets the
advantages that an effective
summer session would offer
students the opportunity to

attend school for two years and
work for a year before returning
to finish up in a fourth year, for
example. I might also note that
people in all other walks of life
are capable of functioning on a 12
month schedule.
Financially, year round
operation would make possible a
25 percent increase in enrollment
without any expansion of the
University's capital a small
increase in the maintenance force
and perhaps a 10 percent
expansion of the faculty.
Benefits would accrue not only
to Stanford (in the form of
increased tuition payments and
more efficient use of capital) but
to society as a whole, because 25
percent more students could
profit from the educational
environment of America's top
institutions.
In my years at Stanford, I have
never been able to find out why
continual cessation of activity is
necessary for 'the successful

functioning of the University. It
leaves one with a doubt :why
should I donate to an institution
that is currently so well off that it
can afford to close up shop 29
percent of the year and run
half-time another 15 percent of
the year? Maybe Standard Oil
needs my money more.
