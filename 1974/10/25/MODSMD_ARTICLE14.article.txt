# Frank Olivieri
## Is The ASSU Financial Manager Using Power-Or Abusing It? 
### GLENN GARVIN 
A few years ago Jim Croce recorded a song
called Bad, Bad Leroy Brown with a refrain
that ended: "Badder than old King Kong,
meaner than a junkyard dog."
Many critics and some friends of
ASSU Financial Manager Frank Olivieri might
contend the song applies to him.
In recent weeks it's been impossible to pick
up a newspaper without reading Frank
Olivieri's name somewhere. When he speaks,
people listen; what Frank Olivieri says or
does makes a great deal of difference.
His prominence is in marked contrast to
the role financial managers have played in
recent years; who, for example, remembers
Dave Martin or Sara Moore? But Olivieri's
name and picture are familiar to almost
anyone who reads any campus publication.
Hate, Admiration
Fame has its price. Many people at
Stanford particuarly those involved in
publications hate him. Others fear him.
Most admire him, albeit grudgingly.
"He is one tough son of a bitch," says one
who has opposed Olivieri often. "He has the
guts of a lion tamer."
"And the soul of an SS trooper," adds
another.
Olivieri earned his reputation with a series of
tough moves against groups he said were financially
unreliable.
Printing Bill
His most spectacular ploy, and the one
which has provoked the most criticism, came
last July when Olivieri discovered the
Chaparral owed a $2194 printing bill and had
only $330 in its account.
Olivieri ordered a freeze on the Chaparral's
account with the ASSU and rekeyed the
magazine's office doors so the staff couldn't
get into the building.
Chaparral staffers said the rekeying
operation was a vicious abuse of power.

Olivieri said it was absolutely necessary.
"The driving force behind changing the
locks on the Chappie was that I had received a
report that the Chappie staff was using the
office for sleeping quarters and that [Editor
Mark] Lee had granted space to a publication
put together by non-students but not
affiliated, with Stanford," he
said.
Tax-Exempt
As University administrators point out, the
use of University office space by non-student
groups could endanger Stanford's tax-exempt
status.
The Chaparral had been in debt many
times before, Olivieri's opponents said. And
certainly other publications' staffers had slept
in the Storke building from time to time. If
such actions didn't require rekeying offices
then, why was it so much worse now?
Later the same month, Olivieri accused the

management of Live Oak, Stanford's newest
newspaper, of trying to "rip off the Stanford
community" and recommended that the
Publications Board deny it space in the Storke
Building and cut off a promised $l5OO
stipend.
"I'm trying to restructure and reorganize
the Publications Board so that we eliminate
publications that are apt to get into the red,"
Olivieri said.
No Space Or Money
The Pub Board took his advice and refused
to give Live Oak either space or money. And
Olivieri went further, denying the paper credit
at the ASSU Typesetting Shop and forcing its
management to seek loans from the
University.
"They're a credit risk, a credit risk with a
capital C," he said.
Live Oak's editor, Bill Weinstein, bitterly
accused Olivieri of "selective discrimination."

But that didn't get him any more credit and
after a couple of issues, Live Oak began to
have economic troubles when advertisers
didn't pay their bills fast enough.
Just as Olivieri predicted.
No Whip-Cracking â€¢
Much of the reason that Olivieri's actions
are so shocking is that the ASSU has usually
lacked a financial manager willing to crack the
whip when necessary. A few years ago the
Publications Board found out just how
expensive that lack can be when gross
financial mismanagement left the Quad
$lO,OOO in debt.
Nor has it been uncommon in recent times
for the Pub Board to bail the Chaparral out of
a hole at the end of the year. With a financial
manager who took drastic, Olivieri-type action
some of that money could have been saved.
Still, Olivieri sometimes seems to be
stepping out of bounds. When the Chaparral
staff published an issue two weeks ago to
disprove a Pub Board decision ruling the
magazine dead, Olivieri was outraged.
The Chaparral was "not supposed to be
printed until the issue is resolved," he told
reporters.
How Olivieri had any authority to make
such a decision was unclear to even his most
rabid supporters.
"Olivieri doesn't know how to separate
finances, where he simply approves or
disapproves ASSU purchase orders, from
questions about who should control
publications which are none of his
business," said Bill Evers, associated with
several publications during the last few years.
"One thing you should realize, though, is
that Frank doesn't deal in personalities," one
observer cautioned. "He's made all these
decisions without any regard for the people
involved ... he made a lot of the decisions on
Live Oak before he ever met Bill Weinstein.
He's only been at Stanford a year."
That's true, and perhaps it's also true that
the ASSU can use a hard-liner like Olivieri to
whip its finances into shape. But few would
disagree with one sympathetic member of the
Pub Board.
"Sometimes he just goes too far ... I think
sometimes even the people who agree with
him would like to strangle him."
