# South Vietnam Frees Nguyen Huu Thai-But It's Still A Long Way To Stanford
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Nguyen Huu Thai moved a step closer to
the United States this month, but he's still a
long, long way from filling an offered ASSU
Guest Professorship,
to In fact, the recent news that Thai was
released from the South Vietnamese army
didn't slow the ASSU's search for an
alternative guest professor one bit.
The board which controls the guest
professorship would still like Thai to fill it,
but until he wins an exit visa from South
Vietnam it will go on looking for someone
else, according to board member Kevin
O'Grady.
The board's search has lasted almost one
month. However, information about Chileans
who could take the position should be
available within the week via Political Science
Prof. Richard C. Fagen, according to O'Grady.
** Winter-Spring
"We've been trying to get someone to
teach winter and spring quarters, and we've
been considering bringing in a Chilean scholar.
Prof. Fagen has a contact in Chile who should
have information within a week," O'Grady
noted.
||s Jim Regan, chairman of the Committee to
Invite Thai to Stanford, said Thai's discharge
from South Vietnam's armed forces was an
insignificant hurdle to leap compared to Thai's
winning an exit visa from his country.
"The next victory we would seek is getting
him [Thai] an exit visa. He has put this in
perspective by saying his chances are nil,"
Regan explained.
Since Thai has been unable to get a visa,
Regan delayed informing members of the
Guest Professorship Board that Thai was
released from the army.
No Big Change
"I haven't talked to the members of the
board yet," Regan said. "The latest
i development, while it slightly improves the
) chances for Thai's getting here, won't change
i the situation for the Guest Professorship
Board that much."

While chances for Thai's receiving an exit
visa from South Vietnam are slim,
preparations are already underway for
securing an entrance visa to the U.S. for him.
The Immigration and Naturalization
Service requires a statement that Thai is an
experienced journalist, according to Regan.
Thai has worked for Dien Tin, the largest
newspaper opposing the regime of South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Thieu.
"I am going to [ask] Thai ... for an
attestation of journalistic expertise signed by
the editor of Dien Tin. This would be needed
for an entrance visa to this country," Regan
said.
Congressional Help
Contacts are being reestablished with
members of Congress who have previously
helped efforts to free Thai when he was held
prisoner by Thieu. They include
Representatives Paul N. McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) and Donald M.
Fraser (D-Minn.).

The members of Congress had previously
been asked to postpone agitating for Thai's
release from the military, because Thai felt
that his life was in danger.
Thai wrote a letter explaining his situation
in Saigon to David Marr, director of the
Indochina Resource Center in Berkeley. Marr
said Thai's eventual exit from South Vietnam
will depend on political pressures.
"I'm not personally optimistic that he'll
get a visa. It depends so much on the political
situation how well Stanford presents its
case through congressional contacts, and how
Thieu views the situation in Vietnam," Man
said.
Thai's letter, dated Oct. 8, summed up the
situation:
"I made some attempts to get an exit visa
from the Ministry of Interior. But only
mentioning my name, these people refuse
already [to consider a visa application]," Thai
wrote. "It's hopeless to get a visa."

that his life was in danger.
Thai wrote a letter explaining his situation
in Saigon to David Marr, director of the
Indochina Resource Center in Berkeley. Marr
said Thai's eventual exit from South Vietnam
will depend on political pressures.
"I'm not personally optimistic that he'll
get a visa. It depends so much on the political
situation how well Stanford presents its
case through congressional contacts, and how
Thieu views the situation in Vietnam," Man
said.
Thai's letter, dated Oct. 8, summed up the
situation:
"I made some attempts to get an exit visa
from the Ministry of Interior. But only
mentioning my name, these people refuse
already [to consider a visa application]," Thai
wrote. "It's hopeless to get a visa."

Nguyen Huu Thai moved a step closer to
the United States this month, but he's still a
long, long way from filling an offered ASSU
Guest Professorship,
to In fact, the recent news that Thai was
released from the South Vietnamese army
didn't slow the ASSU's search for an
alternative guest professor one bit.
The board which controls the guest
professorship would still like Thai to fill it,
but until he wins an exit visa from South
Vietnam it will go on looking for someone
else, according to board member Kevin
O'Grady.
The board's search has lasted almost one
month. However, information about Chileans
who could take the position should be
available within the week via Political Science
Prof. Richard C. Fagen, according to O'Grady.
** Winter-Spring
"We've been trying to get someone to
teach winter and spring quarters, and we've
been considering bringing in a Chilean scholar.
Prof. Fagen has a contact in Chile who should
have information within a week," O'Grady
noted.
||s Jim Regan, chairman of the Committee to
Invite Thai to Stanford, said Thai's discharge
from South Vietnam's armed forces was an
insignificant hurdle to leap compared to Thai's
winning an exit visa from his country.
"The next victory we would seek is getting
him [Thai] an exit visa. He has put this in
perspective by saying his chances are nil,"
Regan explained.
Since Thai has been unable to get a visa,
Regan delayed informing members of the
Guest Professorship Board that Thai was
released from the army.
No Big Change
"I haven't talked to the members of the
board yet," Regan said. "The latest
i development, while it slightly improves the
) chances for Thai's getting here, won't change
i the situation for the Guest Professorship
Board that much."

While chances for Thai's receiving an exit
visa from South Vietnam are slim,
preparations are already underway for
securing an entrance visa to the U.S. for him.
The Immigration and Naturalization
Service requires a statement that Thai is an
experienced journalist, according to Regan.
Thai has worked for Dien Tin, the largest
newspaper opposing the regime of South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Thieu.
"I am going to [ask] Thai ... for an
attestation of journalistic expertise signed by
the editor of Dien Tin. This would be needed
for an entrance visa to this country," Regan
said.
Congressional Help
Contacts are being reestablished with
members of Congress who have previously
helped efforts to free Thai when he was held
prisoner by Thieu. They include
Representatives Paul N. McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) and Donald M.
Fraser (D-Minn.).

The members of Congress had previously
been asked to postpone agitating for Thai's
release from the military, because Thai felt
that his life was in danger.
