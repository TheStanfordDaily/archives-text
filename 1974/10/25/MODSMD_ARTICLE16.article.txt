# ‘Alive And Kicking’
## CROW Finally Gets Off Ground 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
Stanford's answer to a women's studies
program, the Center for Research on Women
(CROW), is starting with faculty support and
efficient organization even if it lacks
specific research programs so far.
"It's like a two-week-old baby," explained
policy board member Sue Heck, "You can't
say much except that it's alive and kicking."
Research coordinator Peggy Smith said
that CROW, will not really know if it is
effective until February or March. But the
staff has built a structure to catch and direct
any research ideas that faculty and students
have.
Although the policy board knew last spring
that CROW would receive a University grant
this fall, the funding started only a month
ago. And efforts to design research, explained
Eleanor Maccoby, policy board chairman and
psychology professor, started only two weeks
ago.
List
Interested faculty have been defining areas
for future study for several months, Smith
said that she expects to have a definite list of
who is planning what studies by the end of
the month.
CROW will not initiate research or give
grants directly to projects. Instead, it will
promote research on women by providing
interdepartmental communication and "seed
money" to projects still in need of an outside
grant. After a research team has clearly
defined its study, it is expected to apply for
research grants elsewhere, Maccoby said.
Research not related directly to University

programs, especially projects through the
Center for Interdisciplinary Research, also
depend heavily on outside funding, said
Patricia Devaney, assistant to the vice provost.
CROW is classified under CIR in the
University structure.
Seed Money
The $20,000 University grant was seed
money, Devaney explained. What the group
asked for last year was a place to work and
funds to coordinate its plans.
But if CROW wants to pay its staff next
year, it must find another source of income,
since the University has made no promises
past 1975.
Maccoby warned "all research funding is
problematical," but CROW staff members said
that, in general, they expect little trouble
finding money for next year.
The interdisciplinary organization of
CROW is preferable to a women's studies
department, Maccoby said, because interest in
women's studies already exists. Given the
strong departmental structure and orientation
of University professors, she explained, the
real need is for a group of people "to focus
the intellectual interests already on campus."
Education Prof. David Tyack said the only
way to build a strong program for women's
research is through existing departments, since
new departments are often unstable. "Power
tends to be established," he explained, so that
"the minute budgets get tight, out goes a new
institute."
Tyack proclaimed not only the strategic
power of an interdepartmental set-up like
CROW now has, but also the practicality of

getting faculty from different fields together.
Sex role research, for example, has
implications for several different departments,
he said.
Extensive inter-departmental
communication is necessary in many studies
on women, Heck said. A study of child care
centers, for example, should include
representatives from law, economics,
sociology and education.
Information coordinator Wendy Martyna
said that CROW's efforts to arrange meetings
across department lines have already achieved
some success. When English Prof. Barbara
Gelpi first heard Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern
at a CROW lecture, the two faculty members
discovered that they were both studying
androgyny.
Without the CROW communication
network, Martyna said, they could have
continued working separately without even
reading each other's research.
Two benefits of a separate department,
which CROW does not have, are the ability to
offer a degree in women's studies and the
chance to offer classes on women's studies.
Maccoby says these drawbacks are
insignificant. "Suppose you have a BA in
women's studies, what does it qualify you
for?" she asked.
Although CROW has not yet developed
specific course plans, she added, classes could
be offered as Undergraduate Specials or
through SWOPSI. The main point is to
provide a vehicle to meet women's studies
needs, Maccoby said, not to create a new
department.
