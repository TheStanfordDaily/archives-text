# Frenchman's Housing Plan Still A Mess
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Frenchman's Terrace is the epitome of the
complexities and complications inherent in
governmental decisions.
The proposed 25-unit Frenchman's
Terrace housing project would be built on
Stanford land, annexed to Palo Alto,
managed by the Urban Coalition and built
with funds provided by the federal
government through the Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Six years after Stanford proposed the
project as a response to the faculty-staff
housing shortage, plans for Frenchman's
Terrace are still in limbo. Hindered by myriad
problems for five years, the plan was finally
ready for approval by HUD's regional office in
San Francisco early this year.
As of this week, James Price, HUD's area
director, is still "studying" the plan. He
remains undecided about whether or not to
recommend construction of the project to
HUD potentates in Washington.
Priorities
According to Dirk Murphy, legal counsel to
HUD, Price is worried about priorities for low
income occupants. But this is the same
concern expressed by Price last February.
Apparently Price is either extremely busy
with other matters or he has pigeon-holed the
project, hoping that it will die of neglect
and/or rising construction costs.
Price says Stanford's insistence on
allocating housing units to Stanford
employees is acceptable now that the
University has dropped its request to allot 25
percent of the spaces for employees of firms
located on Stanford land.
But Price is wary of Stanford's
income-level priorities. The University wants
40 percent of the units rented or sold at
market prices, 40 percent at moderate prices
and 20 percent at low-income levels. Federal
funding plans would differ according to the
price levels.
Price's main reservation about the
proposed income allocations doesn't seem to
involve their expense but rather the viability
of the project as a living center under the
existing ratio. /
Ghetto?
HUD officials insist upon studying the
price levels with the utmost care. They point
out that allocating too many of the units to
low and moderate prices might stigmatize the
project as a ghetto for the poor, discouraging
the affluent from entering the project.
The latest stalling of the plan recalls other
times when the project seemed imperiled.
When it was first proposed, wealthy nearby
residents protested, claiming that ft would
bring lower class people into the area. Later,
the San Francisco Chronicle attacked
Frenchman's Terrace as a "luxury housing
project." The charge was echoed later by an
Oakland attorney who filed suit against the
project, claiming it would divert funds from
more worthwhile projects.
Frenchman's Terrace seemed doomed in
1972 when the Nixon administration declared
a moratorium on funds for projects such as
Frenchman's Terrace. Later, it was criticized
by some Palo Alto City Council members who
insisted the University was trying to "shuck
Frenchman's Terrace off on the city" by
requesting annexation.
The University insists it cannot afford to
provide municipal services for the project;
annexation must be a prerequisite for its
construction. Although the city would
probably annex Frenchman's Terrace despite
opposition from a few council members,
history shows that with Frenchman's Terrace,
nothing is for sure.
Meanwhile, the costs of constructing the
project are rising and the $400,000 HUD
would pay the government for a 99-year lease
on the land is worth less and less.
Almost everyone agrees that Frenchman's
Terrace is a much needed answer to the
housing shortage among the Stanford faculty
and staff. Hopefully, the University and the
Urban Coalition can persuade HUD to start
serious discussions about the project's future.

Frenchman's Terrace is the epitome of the
complexities and complications inherent in
governmental decisions.
The proposed 25-unit Frenchman's
Terrace housing project would be built on
Stanford land, annexed to Palo Alto,
managed by the Urban Coalition and built
with funds provided by the federal
government through the Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Six years after Stanford proposed the
project as a response to the faculty-staff
housing shortage, plans for Frenchman's
Terrace are still in limbo. Hindered by myriad
problems for five years, the plan was finally
ready for approval by HUD's regional office in
San Francisco early this year.
As of this week, James Price, HUD's area
director, is still "studying" the plan. He
remains undecided about whether or not to
recommend construction of the project to
HUD potentates in Washington.
Priorities
According to Dirk Murphy, legal counsel to
HUD, Price is worried about priorities for low
income occupants. But this is the same
concern expressed by Price last February.
Apparently Price is either extremely busy
with other matters or he has pigeon-holed the
project, hoping that it will die of neglect
and/or rising construction costs.
Price says Stanford's insistence on
allocating housing units to Stanford
employees is acceptable now that the
University has dropped its request to allot 25
percent of the spaces for employees of firms
located on Stanford land.
But Price is wary of Stanford's
income-level priorities. The University wants
40 percent of the units rented or sold at
market prices, 40 percent at moderate prices
and 20 percent at low-income levels. Federal
funding plans would differ according to the
price levels.
Price's main reservation about the
proposed income allocations doesn't seem to
involve their expense but rather the viability
of the project as a living center under the
existing ratio. /
Ghetto?
HUD officials insist upon studying the
price levels with the utmost care. They point
out that allocating too many of the units to
low and moderate prices might stigmatize the
project as a ghetto for the poor, discouraging
the affluent from entering the project.
The latest stalling of the plan recalls other
times when the project seemed imperiled.
When it was first proposed, wealthy nearby
residents protested, claiming that ft would
bring lower class people into the area. Later,
the San Francisco Chronicle attacked
Frenchman's Terrace as a "luxury housing
project." The charge was echoed later by an
Oakland attorney who filed suit against the
project, claiming it would divert funds from
more worthwhile projects.
Frenchman's Terrace seemed doomed in
1972 when the Nixon administration declared
a moratorium on funds for projects such as
Frenchman's Terrace. Later, it was criticized
by some Palo Alto City Council members who
insisted the University was trying to "shuck
Frenchman's Terrace off on the city" by
requesting annexation.
The University insists it cannot afford to
provide municipal services for the project;
annexation must be a prerequisite for its
construction. Although the city would
probably annex Frenchman's Terrace despite
opposition from a few council members,
history shows that with Frenchman's Terrace,
nothing is for sure.
Meanwhile, the costs of constructing the
project are rising and the $400,000 HUD
would pay the government for a 99-year lease
on the land is worth less and less.
Almost everyone agrees that Frenchman's
Terrace is a much needed answer to the
housing shortage among the Stanford faculty
and staff. Hopefully, the University and the
Urban Coalition can persuade HUD to start
serious discussions about the project's future.
