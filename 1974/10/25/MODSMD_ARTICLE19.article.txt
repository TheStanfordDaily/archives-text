# Latin Women Type-Cast, Grad Explains
## 
### 
"Latin American women are
traditionally type-cast as passive
retiring ladies whose role in the
history of their country was
negligible," Meri Knaster, former
graduate student in Latin
American Studies, said Wednesday
night.
Knaster, recipient of a Ford
Foundation grant administered by
the University, is currently
working on a bibliography of
Latin American women.
She gave a preview of her work
by describing several aggressive,
enterprising women who contrast
the traditional stereotype of Latin
American women.
Manuela Saenz, Simon
Bolivar's lover, is one important
figure in the independence
movement in Latin America,
Knaster said.
Saenz was eventually exiled
from her country because of
scandalous, subversive and
"masculine behavior," she said.
During her lecture
co-sponsored by the Committee
for Research on Women (CROW)
and the Center for Latin
American Studies, Knaster also
described the difficulties she
encountered when she began her
bibliography.
There were no experts on
literature about Latin American
women, an "appalling dearth" of
relevant classes and inadequate
library resources at the University,
Knaster said.
The bibliography to be
published this spring includes
items on "solid research" and
personal impressions, she said.
"Women don't fit neatly into
structures set up by social
scientist," she explained. "There
is a necessity to open ourselves to
other, perhaps unorthodox and 1
innovative methods."
By combining various
approaches, she said her result will
be "a multi-focused view of
women."
