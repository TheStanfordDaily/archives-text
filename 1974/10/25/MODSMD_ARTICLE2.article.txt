# Faculty Senators Decry 'Grade Inflation' Trend
## 
### BOB LOWE 
Faculty Senate members decried
"grade inflation" yesterday and some
senators suggested the University alter
parts of its existing grading system.
The Senate's response followed
Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron's
preliminary report on the University's
grading system.
Efron, chairman of the Ad Hoc
Panel to Study the Grading System,
confirmed Daily reports that an
unweighted survey he conducted
found that the average undergraduate
grade point average is around 3.55 and
that 39 percent of all grades handed
out are A's.
President Richard W. Lyman told
the Senate that "grade inflation" is a
problem at many schools and named
Harvard and Cornell as two other
private schools where GPAs are*
skyrocketing.
Tests Worth More
He said this trend might create
problems for graduate schools in the
selection of students and cause
"increased reliance on tests ... like
rhe GRE [Graduate Record Exam]."
Other senators expressed
reservations about the existing grading
and class registration systems and
suggested possible changes.
Dean of Humanities and Science
Halsey Royden said presently allowing
students to drop classes throughout
the quarter costs the University
money.
"In light of the economic situation,
they [Efron's committee] should look
at the cost of having students shuffling
in and out of classes."

Royden said a strict time limitation
on dropping and adding classes would
reduce teaching and registration costs.
Dean of the School of Engineering
William Kays said that the average
GPA varies from department to
department.
Juniors and seniors in engineering
have an average of 3.3, he said. Other
math and science departments have
students with average GPAs which are
"similarly low," he added.
The Ad Hoc Panel to Study the
Grading System will continue its study
and hopes to present its findings and
recommendations to the Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (CAAA) near the end of
autumn quarter.
Major Changes
The CAAA, after changing or
approving the panel's report, will send
it to the Faculty Senate for approval.
The panel's findings and
recommendation may result in major
changes in the grading system.
In another matter, Lyman told the
Senate that the University may get a
180-day reprieve from a new federal
law which will open students'
confidential files.
The law, known as the Buckley
Amendment after its author, Sen.
James Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.), allows
students access to their own files
which hold confidential letters and
other materials presently inaccessible.
Lyman said he learned at a recent
meeting of the Association of
American Universities that the
implementation of the law may be
postponed for 180 days while the bill

undergoes "more thoughtful writing."
Only One Day
Lyman added that the law becomes
effective Nov. 19. Congress convenes
Nov. 18 and will, therefore, have only
one day to approve the postponement
legislation.
The Senate also discussed
University budget modifications to
counter an expected $lO million
deficit over the next three years.
A commission will study the budget
and recommend modifications to the
University administration.
Physics Prof. Dirk Walecka urged


Bradley Efron
that the University "rethink its goals"
before deciding upon budget cuts.
"That must be done with faculty
input," he said.
Lyman tried to allay fears of
inadequate faculty involvement in
setting budgetary priorities. "No one's
going to wake up and read in the Daily
that his department's been shot out
from under him," he said.
The Committee on Libraries
reported to the Senate that funding
for the new proposed library "seems
highly doubtful."
Cost for the proposed library is
now estimated at over $3O million
much higher than originally estimated
the committee's report said.
Lyman attributed the increased
cost to higher construction prices and
higher interest rates which make loans
more expensive.
