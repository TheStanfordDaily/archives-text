# Library Gifts Up Despite Tax Act
## 
### LINDA SCHMIDT 
The Income Tax Reform Act
of 1969, which nullified Richard
Nixon's $576,000 tax deduction
for donation of his
vice-presidential papers, has
apparently not noticeably
affected the rate of donations to
Stanford libraries.
The act prohibits public and
literary figures from claiming
deductions larger than the actual
cost of donating their writings to
the library.
Florian Shasky, chief of the
department of special collections,
said that recently, "contributions
have improved not only with
books, but also with papers."
He made special mention of
several recent book gifts,
including a collection of 17th
century Emblem books and
several first editions of famous
authors.
Donation Level
The arrival of two small
collections of papers at the
Special Collections Department is
also imminent, Shasky noted. He
said he was optimistic that the
donation level will remain high.
The Special Collections
Department deals with the works
of literary figures, trying to get a
rounded picture of them by
compiling all drafts, galleys and
publishing correspondence.
W. Glenn Campbell, director of

Hoover Institution, said that the
situation was "fine. We had a
good program of acquisition
before and in the last two or three
months, it's been even better."
Many Collections
The Institution has 3000
collections or sets of papers
dealing with 20th century world
revolution and peace. It receives
between 70 and 90 new
collections annually and is
soliciting several hundred others.
Campbell also believes that the
deduction reform provisions are
not a major consideration for
to Hoover.
Most of those contributing are
prominent statesmen, diplomats,
military figures and journalists
"who never really felt they should
get money for something they
created while in the public's
service," Campbell said last
summer.
Patricia Palmer, who works in
the Special Collections
Department, said last summer that
donations were down about 25
percent. "I know of at least three
good ones that have not come in

the past year because of the law,"
she said.
Palmer said Congress may
amend the act, but noted that the
problem is where to draw the line
in allowing deductions. She said
that authors should be able to
deduct for their donations, but
that the papers of a public official
should belong to the public.

said that recently, "contributions
have improved not only with
books, but also with papers."
He made special mention of
several recent book gifts,
including a collection of 17th
century Emblem books and
several first editions of famous
authors.
Donation Level
The arrival of two small
collections of papers at the
Special Collections Department is
also imminent, Shasky noted. He
said he was optimistic that the
donation level will remain high.
The Special Collections
Department deals with the works
of literary figures, trying to get a
rounded picture of them by
compiling all drafts, galleys and
publishing correspondence.
W. Glenn Campbell, director of

Hoover Institution, said that the
situation was "fine. We had a
good program of acquisition
before and in the last two or three
months, it's been even better."
Many Collections
The Institution has 3000
collections or sets of papers
dealing with 20th century world
revolution and peace. It receives
between 70 and 90 new
collections annually and is
soliciting several hundred others.
Campbell also believes that the
deduction reform provisions are
not a major consideration for
to Hoover.
Most of those contributing are
prominent statesmen, diplomats,
military figures and journalists
"who never really felt they should
get money for something they
created while in the public's
service," Campbell said last
summer.
Patricia Palmer, who works in
the Special Collections
Department, said last summer that
donations were down about 25
percent. "I know of at least three
good ones that have not come in

the past year because of the law,"
she said.
Palmer said Congress may
amend the act, but noted that the
problem is where to draw the line
in allowing deductions. She said
that authors should be able to
deduct for their donations, but
that the papers of a public official
should belong to the public.

STONED AGAlN—Actually this plaid-shirted man is not high. He's
Ben Fong-Torres, senior editor of Rolling Stone, speaking to
Communication 225A on the "inner workings" of his publication.
The Income Tax Reform Act
of 1969, which nullified Richard
Nixon's $576,000 tax deduction
for donation of his
vice-presidential papers, has
apparently not noticeably
affected the rate of donations to
Stanford libraries.
The act prohibits public and
literary figures from claiming
deductions larger than the actual
cost of donating their writings to
the library.
Florian Shasky, chief of the
department of special collections,
said that recently, "contributions
have improved not only with
books, but also with papers."
