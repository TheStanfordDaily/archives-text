# 'Rolling Stone' Senior Editor Says His Publication 'Walks The Line'

### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
The most interesting aspect of
covering the volatile rock music
world is in exploring "what
sudden success does to the artist
and all of the people around
him," Rolling Stone senior editor
Ben Fong-Torres said Tuesday.
He cited Creedence Clearwater
Revival as an example of a group
unable to live up to its own high
expectations after initial success.
Fong-Torres said the group
became disillusioned when it
wasn't accepted as "the new
Beattles."
By studying popular music and
the people involved artists,
management and fans a writer
can also gain an insight into
American society, Fong-Torres
told the Communication 225A
class.
The way musicians achieve
popularity "tells us a lot about
America [and] its needs at a
certain time in history," he said.
Fong-Torres also spoke about
the "inner workings" of Rolling

Stone, a periodical that mainly
contains articles on rock
musicians and music, but more
recently on political events. Â«
Rolling Stone has always
walked the line," Fong-Torres
said.
It has been neither
underground nor overground,
newspaper nor magazine, musical
nor social journal, but rather a
combination of all these, he
explained.
Founder-Editor
And it has always most closely
reflected the interests of its
founder-editor, Jann Wenner,
Fong-Torres added, saying, "it
comes down to it being Jann's
trip."
Asked about Wenner's current,
strong interest in politics and
Rolling Stone's extensive political
coverage, Fong-Torres revealed
that Wenner is considering the
possibility of establishing a
separate magazine entitled,
Politics.
Fong-Torres also assured the
audience that Rolling Stone's
writer from "Gonzo Journalism,"
Hunter Thompson, is every bit as
wild as Thompson claims.
Freak Power Candidate
Among his numerous exploits,
Thompson ran as the "Freak
Power Candidate" for sheriff of
Aspen, Colorado, on a platform
advocating free mescaline for the
public. Thompson is the "worst
problem" but also "just about the
best writer at Rolling Stone,"
Fong-Torres said.

Fong-Torres also described his
path to becoming, according to
Esquire , "one of the heavy 100 of
rock."
He said his journalistic interests
began in school when he started
reading Mad and Dig. He also
wrote satires of his junior high
school newspaper.
College Paper
He arrived on the San
Francisco State campus in the
mid-60s, a time of great change in
society and colleges, he said. As
editor and columnist for the
school newspaper, he wrote about
these changes.
After graduation he worked as
an "all-night announcer for
muzak," in addition to holding a
phone company job. His
association with Rolling Stone
started when he wrote a free-lance
article on the making of Dick
Clark's movie about
Haight-Ashbury during the 60s.
