## How Blue Can You Get? Nowhere Near Blue Enough 
### Dan Forte 
SAN FRANCISCO It is a sad irony that in its own country,
America's only indigenous music is largely unappreciated and almost
completely misunderstood.
Despite its title, The Evolution of the Blues has very little to do
with blues, and that which is presented gives a very distorted picture.
The show, now enjoying an extended run at the On Broadway
Theater, is the child of jazz singer-lyricist-critic Jon Hendricks,
resulting from a presentation he made at the 1961 Monterey Jazz
Festival.
Hendricks says the assignment festival host Jimmy Lyons asked
him to write "something about the blues" caused him to do a lot of
"soul searching."
Well, soul searching is fine, but Hendricks needs to do some
researching.
If anything, Evolution illustrates the development of jazz, no blues
(there is a difference), but still not very adequately. More than that, it
represents Jon Hendricks, and serves as a platform for his many
talents.
The precious few blues numbers included in the play (about six out
of more than 30 tunes) are all in the uptown, bordering-on-jazz,
Jon-Hendricks vein.
The production completely skips over rural blues, an evolution in
itself. Hendricks would have his audience believe that the beginnings
of blues occurred in a single city, New Orleans, and served as no more
than a transition between spirituals and jazz.
To set things straight: the first-ever jazz bands came out of New
Orleans, beginning with Buddy Bolden. But, it was never (still isn't) a
town where much blues was played, except that turned out by the
Dixieland blowers.
Blues didn't begin in the "sinful cities" Hendricks spoke of; it
began in the fields, invented by the sharecroppers, plowhands, and,
even further back, the slaves, as field hollers and work songs.
Hendricks' idea of a work song is the Cannonball Adderly hit
"Work Song," a jazz tune about a work song.
The stage of Evolution is set in the inside of a church, and the play
begins and ends with gospel music. In fact, nearly half of the play is
gospel singing and preaching.
Big Bill Broonzy once said, "Blues is a steal from spirituals," when
asked the inevitable what-are-the-blues-and-where-did-they-come-from
question.
Certainly, blues' debt to sacred music cannot be denied, but
Hendricks seems to present one at the expense of the other.
Fortunately, the gospel singing is by far the most well done, most
enjoyable element of the play.
While he is a shoddy historian, Hendricks is a beautiful singer, and
Verlin Sandles comes through with a fine version of "Just A Closer
Walk With Thee."
The real show stealer, though, was Elnah Jordan, who Hendricks
discovered singing outdoors at The Cannery.
Easily the most moving part of the play is her powerful rendition
of "I Told Jesus" which is no less than incredible.
Other, less appropriate, musical forms presented included: an
African dance, a West Indian number, and a bossa nova.
But, the most uncalled for segment a downright atrocity was
"Camptown Races" (doo-dah) which has absolutely nothing to do
with the blues or black culture. Here Hendricks (who, by the way, is
black) seems to have been taken in by the old "happy darkie" image
many whites once pictured.
Interspersed between songs was Hendricks' poetic rap, with nearly
everything rhyming. "New York, New York, a city so nice they had to

name it twice."
He introduced one of the rare blues tunes of the show, "C.C.
Rider," with a manufactured story of how the term came to be.
According to Hendricks, "C.C." was a cutdown way of saying
"circuit," in reference to the south's travelling preachers, circuit
riders.
In actuality, the song derives from "Easy Rider" ("see what you
have done"), a term describing an especially good sexual partner.
The rest of the play was made up of jazz numbers, played quite
ably by the Vernon Alley Trio, with pianist Larry Vuckovitch,
drummer Lenny Mc√ürowne, and Alley on bass fiddle, aided by gospel
organist Melvin Seals.
The highlight of Hendricks' singing was his tribute to Louis
"Satchmo" Armstrong, with a fabulous rendition of "When It's
Sleepy Time Down South."
The only tribute to any blues performer was Elnah Jordan's
impersonation of Bessie Smith singing "T'ain't Nobody's Business."
Hendricks's even somehow manages to avoid mentioning the city
of Chicago, a veritable blues mecca for years and years.
Wasn't the original assignment to write something about the bluest
Performance-wise, most of Evolution of the Blues was high-quality
entertainment. Historically, it's a crying shame.
Hendricks has blown a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to actually
turn people on to the blues while educating them.
What about Muddy Waters, Otis Spann, and Little Walter? What
about 8.8. King, Albert King, and Sonny boy Williamson? What about
Robert Johnson, Son House, and Blind Lemon Jefferson? What about
the blues?
