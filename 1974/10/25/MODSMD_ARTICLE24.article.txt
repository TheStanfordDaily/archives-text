# Rodin Exhibit Displays Emotion, Life
## 
### D. PAUL YEUELL 
The collectin of Rodin sculpture, a recent
donation to the Stanford Museum by B.
Gerald Cantor, opened to the public
Saturday. This show, designed by Stanford
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, includes 90 pieces,
several photographs of Rodin, his salon and
his sculpture and literature (describing
Rodin's casting techniques, his life and his
work.
Auguste Rodin, who died in 1917 at the
age of 77, was a key personality in sculpture
and drawing of the last century. Rising out of
a heavy training in traditional sculpture and
painting, Rodin married classical craft with a
free expressive hand.
The intention of the Stanford Rodin
show, according to Elsen, is to educate. The
sculpture is deliberately arranged to suggest
the way that Rodin played with forms and
composition.
Emotional Sculpture
One arrangement is a table of five bronze
sculptures, all of which are nude studies of
women. These sculptures, which include
"Iris, Messenger of the Gods, "Earth" and
"Study for Polyphemus," demonstrate

Rodin's break with traditional posture in
sculpture.
Rodin saw that emotion could be
expressed not only by facial configuration
but also by the parts of the body. Rodin
drew his forms from models who struck
boldly expressive poses, making his figures
not only extremely animate but also
dangerously immodest for his time.
In "Iris, Messenger of the Gods," where
the incomplete female figure stretches her
legs wide like a dancer, attention is drawn
away from her face to her lower torso.
Erotic Subjects
Of the many nude studies in this
collection, the most exciting deal with the
theme of lesbianism. "Illusions Received by
Earth," "Metamorphosis of Ovid" and "The
Triumph of Youth" are expressions of
lesbian passion.
To protect these erotic works from
censorship, Rodin legitimized them by giving
them titles that linked them to either Greek
mythology or European history.
Another arrangement, which includes
"Centauress," "Danai de" and
"Andromeda," shows how Rodin played
with composition. Here one can see how

Rodin brought forms together in different
combinations to create new themes.
A very striking example of this is "Large
Clenched Left Hand with Figure." In this
sculpture, Rodin brought together a massive
study of a hand for "The Burghers of Calais"
and the writhing woman's figure from the
"Centauress."
Seen in the context of the "Burghers," the
massive hand embodies the bitter anguish of
the six French citizens of Calais who
surrender themselves to the English king,
Edward 111.
But seen in the other composition, "Large
Clenched Hand with Figure," tremendous
power and strength are expressed in the
massive hand.
The composition with the woman's figure
creates a powerful force between the two
where the hand, perhaps that of God, seems
to at once terrify and attract the suffering
woman.
This exhibit includes many other exciting
works like a study of Rodin's "Balzac," with
a series of eerie moonlight photographs taken
in 1911 by Alfred Stieglitz, two copies of
"The Kiss" (one gilded) and a moving
arrangement of the "Burghers of Calais."
