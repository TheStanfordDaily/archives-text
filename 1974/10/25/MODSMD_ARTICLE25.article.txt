# Watsons Get Crowd
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Doc and Merle Watson, who
have done more than their share
to spread the popularity of
country music in the past few
years, undoubtedly made a few
more converts Saturday night as
they played to two sellout crowds
in Mem Aud.
Doc Watson, who has been
blind since birth and picking the
guitar almost as long, was one of
the principals of the three-record
set Will the Circle Be Unbroken,
one of the largest-selling albums in
Nashville's history. He is a master
of many styles of country music
from bluegrass and old-timey
ballads to western swing and
rhythm and blues, but his special
forte is fast, melodic, "hot"
flat-picking.
Father-Son Team
Doc's son Merle helped out on
guitar, slide guitar and banjo.
Never one to steal the spotlight,
Merle sits back quietly most of
the time, until Doc says "Pick it
purty now, Merle," whereupon he
does just that. Michael Coleman,
like the Watsons a North Carolina
product, accompanies them on
electric bass.

The Watson's set for the
second show Saturday night
included songs by many of their
favorite songwriters, including
Jimmie Rodgers, the Carter
Family and Utah Phillips, plus a
few originals. They opened with
"Way Downtown," followed by a
talking blues called "Doc's
Talkin.' "
Flat-Picking, Harmony
Merle played some of his best
slide guitar on a couple of Jimmie
Rodgers tunes, "T For Texas" and
"The Mississippi and You."
Coleman backed up Doc's vocals
on "The Wabash Cannonball,"
and Doc and Merle took turns
flat-icking on "Salt Creek,"
complete with some tasty dual
guitar harmonies.
A Carter tune, which Doc
explained had been recorded once
as "Cannonball" and once as
"Solid Gone," followed. Someone
in the audience requested a ballad,
so Doc responded with a nice one
called "Rovin' on a Winter
Night."
Not Just Bluegrass
Some of Doc's best picking
came on another requested tune,
"Black Mountain Rag," a fiddle

tune which has become a
bluegrass standard. Suddenly the
mood shifted to a very
urban-bluesy "St. James
Infirmary," which surprised many
in the audience. Merle's guitar
leads were part of the pleasant
surprise, and showed that he
hasn't just been listening to the
country boys.
Doc sang another request,
"Tennessee Stud," then
introduced a couple of friends
who sat in for the rest of the
show. With Joe Smothers on
guitar and washboard and
Courtney Johnson on banjo, they
played Utah Phillips' "Rock Salt
and Nails" and, with Merle
switching to Banjo, "Old Joe
Clarke." They finished up with
"Mama Don't Allow" (no guitar
pickin', no banjo pickin', no
washboard playin', etc.), with
everybody taking some solo time.
As an encore, Doc recalled his
days with Jack Williams' Western
swing band in the 50s. He began
with a verse or two of a slow
waltz, then broke into "Blue
Suede Shoes."
Fahey Followed
The Watsons were preceded by
acoustic guitarist John Fahey,
whose music befuddles anyone
trying to give it a label (including
critics!). Basically, Fahey is a
guitarist of excellent technique
whose music shows influences of
classical, traditional American and
various non-Western styles of
music.
His selections were oftert loose
medleys of distinct tunes he has
recorded, linked together with
improvisation and other
connective tissue. He might, for
example, switch suddenly from a
fairly conventional blues to an
Oriental-sounding dissonant
passage and back again, or from a
very complex rhythm to ragtime.
Inconsistent Combination
Fahey played part of his set on
a Hawaiian guitar with slide, with
inconsistent results. Some of the
slide work was very melodic and
accessible, but it occasionally
grew repetitive. Once or twice it
sounded like a series of exercises
in right-hand technique.
But lapses into tedium were
the exception rather than the rule,
and Fahey impressed many in the
audience who had never heard a
guitarist of his technical expertise
and musical imagination.
A one-man act, Dr. Lovecraft's
Magical Medicine Show, warmed
up the crowd with a combination
of medicine-show fast talk, sleight
of hand and occasional suggestive
comments toward his volunteers
from the audience.

Doc's son Merle helped out on
guitar, slide guitar and banjo.
Never one to steal the spotlight,
Merle sits back quietly most of
the time, until Doc says "Pick it
purty now, Merle," whereupon he
does just that. Michael Coleman,
like the Watsons a North Carolina
product, accompanies them on
electric bass.

The Watson's set for the
second show Saturday night
included songs by many of their
favorite songwriters, including
Jimmie Rodgers, the Carter
Family and Utah Phillips, plus a
few originals. They opened with
"Way Downtown," followed by a
talking blues called "Doc's
Talkin.' "
Flat-Picking, Harmony
Merle played some of his best
slide guitar on a couple of Jimmie
Rodgers tunes, "T For Texas" and
"The Mississippi and You."
Coleman backed up Doc's vocals
on "The Wabash Cannonball,"
and Doc and Merle took turns
flat-icking on "Salt Creek,"
complete with some tasty dual
guitar harmonies.
A Carter tune, which Doc
explained had been recorded once
as "Cannonball" and once as
"Solid Gone," followed. Someone
in the audience requested a ballad,
so Doc responded with a nice one
called "Rovin' on a Winter
Night."
Not Just Bluegrass
Some of Doc's best picking
came on another requested tune,
"Black Mountain Rag," a fiddle

tune which has become a
bluegrass standard. Suddenly the
mood shifted to a very
urban-bluesy "St. James
Infirmary," which surprised many
in the audience. Merle's guitar
leads were part of the pleasant
surprise, and showed that he
hasn't just been listening to the
country boys.
Doc sang another request,
"Tennessee Stud," then
introduced a couple of friends
who sat in for the rest of the
show. With Joe Smothers on
guitar and washboard and
Courtney Johnson on banjo, they
played Utah Phillips' "Rock Salt
and Nails" and, with Merle
switching to Banjo, "Old Joe
Clarke." They finished up with
"Mama Don't Allow" (no guitar
pickin', no banjo pickin', no
washboard playin', etc.), with
everybody taking some solo time.
As an encore, Doc recalled his
days with Jack Williams' Western
swing band in the 50s. He began
with a verse or two of a slow
waltz, then broke into "Blue
Suede Shoes."
Fahey Followed
The Watsons were preceded by
acoustic guitarist John Fahey,
whose music befuddles anyone
trying to give it a label (including
critics!). Basically, Fahey is a
guitarist of excellent technique
whose music shows influences of
classical, traditional American and
various non-Western styles of
music.
His selections were oftert loose
medleys of distinct tunes he has
recorded, linked together with
improvisation and other
connective tissue. He might, for
example, switch suddenly from a
fairly conventional blues to an
Oriental-sounding dissonant
passage and back again, or from a
very complex rhythm to ragtime.
Inconsistent Combination
Fahey played part of his set on
a Hawaiian guitar with slide, with
inconsistent results. Some of the
slide work was very melodic and
accessible, but it occasionally
grew repetitive. Once or twice it
sounded like a series of exercises
in right-hand technique.
But lapses into tedium were
the exception rather than the rule,
and Fahey impressed many in the
audience who had never heard a
guitarist of his technical expertise
and musical imagination.
A one-man act, Dr. Lovecraft's
Magical Medicine Show, warmed
up the crowd with a combination
of medicine-show fast talk, sleight
of hand and occasional suggestive
comments toward his volunteers
from the audience.
Doc and Merle Watson, who
have done more than their share
to spread the popularity of
country music in the past few
years, undoubtedly made a few
more converts Saturday night as
they played to two sellout crowds
in Mem Aud.
Doc Watson, who has been
blind since birth and picking the
guitar almost as long, was one of
the principals of the three-record
set Will the Circle Be Unbroken,
one of the largest-selling albums in
Nashville's history. He is a master
of many styles of country music
from bluegrass and old-timey
ballads to western swing and
rhythm and blues, but his special
forte is fast, melodic, "hot"
flat-picking.

Rodgers tunes, "T For Texas" and
"The Mississippi and You."
Coleman backed up Doc's vocals
on "The Wabash Cannonball,"
and Doc and Merle took turns
flat-icking on "Salt Creek,"
complete with some tasty dual
guitar harmonies.
A Carter tune, which Doc
explained had been recorded once
as "Cannonball" and once as
"Solid Gone," followed. Someone
in the audience requested a ballad,
so Doc responded with a nice one
called "Rovin' on a Winter
Night."
Not Just Bluegrass
Some of Doc's best picking
came on another requested tune,
"Black Mountain Rag," a fiddle

tune which has become a
bluegrass standard. Suddenly the
mood shifted to a very
urban-bluesy "St. James
Infirmary," which surprised many
in the audience. Merle's guitar
leads were part of the pleasant
surprise, and showed that he
hasn't just been listening to the
country boys.
Doc sang another request,
"Tennessee Stud," then
introduced a couple of friends
who sat in for the rest of the
show. With Joe Smothers on
guitar and washboard and
Courtney Johnson on banjo, they
played Utah Phillips' "Rock Salt
and Nails" and, with Merle
switching to Banjo, "Old Joe
Clarke." They finished up with
"Mama Don't Allow" (no guitar
pickin', no banjo pickin', no
washboard playin', etc.), with
everybody taking some solo time.
As an encore, Doc recalled his
days with Jack Williams' Western
swing band in the 50s. He began
with a verse or two of a slow
waltz, then broke into "Blue
Suede Shoes."
Fahey Followed
The Watsons were preceded by
acoustic guitarist John Fahey,
whose music befuddles anyone
trying to give it a label (including
critics!). Basically, Fahey is a
guitarist of excellent technique
whose music shows influences of
classical, traditional American and
various non-Western styles of
music.
His selections were oftert loose
medleys of distinct tunes he has
recorded, linked together with
improvisation and other
connective tissue. He might, for
example, switch suddenly from a
fairly conventional blues to an
Oriental-sounding dissonant
passage and back again, or from a
very complex rhythm to ragtime.
Inconsistent Combination
Fahey played part of his set on
a Hawaiian guitar with slide, with
inconsistent results. Some of the
slide work was very melodic and
accessible, but it occasionally
grew repetitive. Once or twice it
sounded like a series of exercises
in right-hand technique.
But lapses into tedium were
the exception rather than the rule,
and Fahey impressed many in the
audience who had never heard a
guitarist of his technical expertise
and musical imagination.
A one-man act, Dr. Lovecraft's
Magical Medicine Show, warmed
up the crowd with a combination
of medicine-show fast talk, sleight
of hand and occasional suggestive
comments toward his volunteers
from the audience.
