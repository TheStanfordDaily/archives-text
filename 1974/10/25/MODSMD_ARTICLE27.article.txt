## Odessa File: 'Simplistic Action Film' 
### George Powell 
The journalist as secret agent. Certainly a fascinating and
provocative topic for 1974, particularly if it comes from a best-selling
novel like The Odessa File.
The movie made from the novel concerns Peter Miller, a freelance
journalist of unusual integrity, who in 1963 takes on the remnants of
Hitler's SS, the dangerous Odessa, who are going to help Nasser
destroy Israel.
As director Ronald Neame interprets the Fredrick Forsythe novel,

the good and bad guys become caricatures, with Miller, portrayed by
Jon Voight with a believable German accept, dogged in his
determination to track down the evil Eduard Roschmann, the evil SS
concentration camp head, who murdered thousands of Jews through
his orders.
Roschmann is portrayed by Maxmillian Schell, an actor of immense
talent, who so overplays his part as a covert Nazi who is found out that
he dominates the last few minutes of the movie as completely as John
Wayne dominates any Western.
Suspense And Humor
The total effect director Neame succeeds in creating is a sort of
suspenseful, unintentionally funny Film, with equal parts that
condescend to the audience's lowest level and well-thought-out action
scenes, which gives the film a crazy dichotomy, suspenseful and silly
at the same time.
Voight is good as the freelance journalist investigating the death of
an old Jew and how it ties in with the Odessa, a super-secret but
powerful organization of former SS members, who are still working to
eradicate Jews.
But as a secret agent, infiltrating Odessa Voight seems less
believeable, particularly in a fight scene with a deadly assassin. But
enough of the plot. What matters is the action, and for the most part
that's well done, making up somewhat for the pedantic approach the
script takes to Nazi guilt for the killing of Jews.
Feeble Rationalization
What Schell as Roschmann is forced to say seems both silly and
self-serving but perhaps peoples' ears are more attuned to that sort
of feeble rationalization in the post-Watergate atmosphere, so there's
an over-reaction from the audience to such utterances.
Over-reaction or not, the fact remains that The Odessa File makes a
rather simplistic action film, with the intellectual content of a
Gainseburger. For a reviewer to say that is made much harder by the
realization that director Neame is a fine example of an English
gentleman in the best sense of the word, so to condemn his film is
akin to verbally slapping him in the face.
Commercial Considerations
Neame, who appeared at a press conference after a screening of
The Odessa File at the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley, admitted that
the film was made with purely commercial considerations in mind. He
freely said that his current effort was more along the lines of The
Poseidon Adventure , which he also directed, rather than the
artistically rewarding, but financially unsuccessful movies like Tunes
of Glory or The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.
He promised, however, that his next film would be of more appeal
to critics and afficianados, and was so open in defense of his concept
for The Odessa File without being obnoxious or dogmatic, that he had
won most of the film buffs over by the end of the half-hour press
conference.
Stale And Shallow
So the critic is faced with the impossible task of wanting to say
nice things about the movie but having to admit that it is stale and
shallow at the same time. It's easier for Germans and English to work
together, as they did for The Odessa File, than for critics to bridge
those mutually exclusive tendencies.
If a summary is possible, Neame can be damned with faint praise
for making another film that should exhibit equal parts of box-office
vitality and intellectual vacuousness.
"The Odessa File," rated PG, is currently playing at the Menlo
Theater.

destroy Israel.
As director Ronald Neame interprets the Fredrick Forsythe novel,

the good and bad guys become caricatures, with Miller, portrayed by
Jon Voight with a believable German accept, dogged in his
determination to track down the evil Eduard Roschmann, the evil SS
concentration camp head, who murdered thousands of Jews through
his orders.
Roschmann is portrayed by Maxmillian Schell, an actor of immense
talent, who so overplays his part as a covert Nazi who is found out that
he dominates the last few minutes of the movie as completely as John
Wayne dominates any Western.
Suspense And Humor
The total effect director Neame succeeds in creating is a sort of
suspenseful, unintentionally funny Film, with equal parts that
condescend to the audience's lowest level and well-thought-out action
scenes, which gives the film a crazy dichotomy, suspenseful and silly
at the same time.
Voight is good as the freelance journalist investigating the death of
an old Jew and how it ties in with the Odessa, a super-secret but
powerful organization of former SS members, who are still working to
eradicate Jews.
But as a secret agent, infiltrating Odessa Voight seems less
believeable, particularly in a fight scene with a deadly assassin. But
enough of the plot. What matters is the action, and for the most part
that's well done, making up somewhat for the pedantic approach the
script takes to Nazi guilt for the killing of Jews.
Feeble Rationalization
What Schell as Roschmann is forced to say seems both silly and
self-serving but perhaps peoples' ears are more attuned to that sort
of feeble rationalization in the post-Watergate atmosphere, so there's
an over-reaction from the audience to such utterances.
Over-reaction or not, the fact remains that The Odessa File makes a
rather simplistic action film, with the intellectual content of a
Gainseburger. For a reviewer to say that is made much harder by the
realization that director Neame is a fine example of an English
gentleman in the best sense of the word, so to condemn his film is
akin to verbally slapping him in the face.
Commercial Considerations
Neame, who appeared at a press conference after a screening of
The Odessa File at the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley, admitted that
the film was made with purely commercial considerations in mind. He
freely said that his current effort was more along the lines of The
Poseidon Adventure , which he also directed, rather than the
artistically rewarding, but financially unsuccessful movies like Tunes
of Glory or The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.
He promised, however, that his next film would be of more appeal
to critics and afficianados, and was so open in defense of his concept
for The Odessa File without being obnoxious or dogmatic, that he had
won most of the film buffs over by the end of the half-hour press
conference.
Stale And Shallow
So the critic is faced with the impossible task of wanting to say
nice things about the movie but having to admit that it is stale and
shallow at the same time. It's easier for Germans and English to work
together, as they did for The Odessa File, than for critics to bridge
those mutually exclusive tendencies.
If a summary is possible, Neame can be damned with faint praise
for making another film that should exhibit equal parts of box-office
vitality and intellectual vacuousness.
"The Odessa File," rated PG, is currently playing at the Menlo

DEADLY CONFRONTATION—Jon Voigt stares down at his prey in
this scene from the suspense thriller, The Odessa File. Based on
carefully documented research, The Odessa File is the story of a
German journalist (Voigt) whose search for a former Nazi officer
leads him to the file of a secret organization, the Odessa, which really
existed. The screenplay is based on the novel by Frederick Forsyth.
The journalist as secret agent. Certainly a fascinating and
provocative topic for 1974, particularly if it comes from a best-selling
novel like The Odessa File.
The movie made from the novel concerns Peter Miller, a freelance
journalist of unusual integrity, who in 1963 takes on the remnants of
Hitler's SS, the dangerous Odessa, who are going to help Nasser
destroy Israel.
