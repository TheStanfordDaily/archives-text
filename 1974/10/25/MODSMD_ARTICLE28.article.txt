# Kirk Demonstrates Instrument Mastery
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
For mastery of virtually any
reed instrument and command of
musical styles from slave chants to
contemporary jazz, no musician
can match Rahsaan Roland Kirk.
Playing only a small part of his
huge repertoire, Kirk made one of
his late sets last week at Keystone
Korner a unique musical odyssey.
Kirk's first number, a blues in
which he took a rare turn on
piano, displayed the formidable
talents of his five-man backup
group, the Vibration Society.
Then regular pianist Ron Burton
took over and Kirk picked up his
flute to blow a brilliant version of
Miles Davis' "All Blues."
Rahsaan's flute work is full of
surprises: his tone can change
from delicate and lyrical to
piercing and whistling. His fast,
breathy passages punctuated by
grunts proved the highlight of
"All Blues": indeed Kirk's
self-developed breathing
techniques (which he calls his
"miracle") allow him to play
longer and faster uninterrupted
passages than any other jazzman,
and he takes full advantage of his
abilities.
Next Kirk produced a small,
straight horn that looked and
sounded like a primitive precursor
of the soprano sax, and proceeded
with an exotic number called
"Coltrane Came Through." Kirk
evoked echoes of Coltrane's
famous rendition of "My Favorite
Things" and afterwards explained
that the late saxaphonist had
given him the small horn

personally.
Kirk mused for a minute on his
friendship with Coltrane, then
picked up his tenor sax and
played a few bars of pure soul.
The band chanted a primitive
work song, punctuated by shouts
and whistles, which served as a
prelude to a long tenor solo by
Kirk. His tenor style is powerful
and very soulful; even if the tenor
were his only horn, he would have
to be acknowledged as one of the
most formidable reedmen around.
For a final surprise, Kirk began
to sing an earthy "Down By The
Riverside" that had everyone in
the audience clapping. He then
produced his clarinet and played a
joyful New Orleans-style solo. As
the blind Kirk, preceeded by his
tambourine player, marched
through the audience wailing
away on his clarinet, it was like a
trip to Preservation Hall with a
very knowledgeable guide.
The only disappointment with
Kirk's set was that he didn't have
time to do some of the other
things he does so well. He has the
highly unusual ability to play two
different sax solos at the same
time, and he also plays two
other horns, called the manzello
and the stritch, which no one else
has even tried to play. Their
sound is something like an alto
sax's, but hardly identical.
Rahsaan can't really be called
an innovative trendsetter, because
no one else could hope to do half
of what he does. He could, I am
sure, match any jazzman on any
reed.
