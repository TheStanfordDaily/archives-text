# English Prof Evaluates Role Of 'Women Poets'
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
As soon as a woman poet publishes
her work, she finds that she is
evaluated as "a woman poet," not just
"a poet," English Prof. Diane
Middlebrook said last night at the
Tresidder "Themes in Contemporary
America" lecture series.
Quoting a male poet and critic,
Middlebrook outlined the objections
usually levied against women's poetry,
including "a lack of range," an
obsession with trivia and a refusal to
face the realities of life.
Most female poets were married
and began a domestic life at a very
young age, she pointed out, and the
home is "on the whole not considered

a broad enough experience for art."
Middlebrook reviewed the
development of "confessional" and
"myth-making" poetry in America
over the last 20 years. Women, she
said, have contributed and should
continue to contribute to these
developing forms.
'Confessional' Poetry
Confessional poetry, she
emphasized, is "not interested in
forgiveness, or even in telling the
truth," in spite of its misleading name.
The word confessional, which often
has a less respectable reputation than
more traditional forms of poetry,
implies that the poet is going to "tell
us something we shouldn't know,"
then hope for forgiveness,
Middlebrook said.
Instead, she described confessional
poetry as an "undisplaced
acknowledgment of human
despair... at the very least
diminishing to human dignity."
She read from Sylvia Plath, who
jarred her readers effectively by
describing remote reactions to
motherhood instead of the more
pleasant emotions that people like to
read about. This technique,
Middlebrook warned, can result in
simply "bad mannerisms," but has
been used effectively.
'Myth-Making'
The "myth-making" poets have
been re-creating the classic prototypes
of the past, Middlebrook explained.
The discovery that men and women
today are like men and women have
been for thousands of years, she said,
"simplistic as it is," has led to some
excellent modern poetry.
But while male poets have been
re-making these stories, women have
been converting the stories "to see
what's in it for them."
Middlebrook read Ann Sexton's
poem, "The Frog Prince," based on a
Grimm's fairy tale. Seen from the
virgin princess' point of view, the
poem is "about something I think men
never realized it was about,"
Middlebrook explained.

America" lecture series.
Quoting a male poet and critic,
Middlebrook outlined the objections
usually levied against women's poetry,
including "a lack of range," an
obsession with trivia and a refusal to
face the realities of life.
Most female poets were married
and began a domestic life at a very
young age, she pointed out, and the
home is "on the whole not considered

a broad enough experience for art."
Middlebrook reviewed the
development of "confessional" and
"myth-making" poetry in America
over the last 20 years. Women, she
said, have contributed and should
continue to contribute to these
developing forms.
'Confessional' Poetry
Confessional poetry, she
emphasized, is "not interested in
forgiveness, or even in telling the
truth," in spite of its misleading name.
The word confessional, which often
has a less respectable reputation than
more traditional forms of poetry,
implies that the poet is going to "tell
us something we shouldn't know,"
then hope for forgiveness,
Middlebrook said.
Instead, she described confessional
poetry as an "undisplaced
acknowledgment of human
despair... at the very least
diminishing to human dignity."
She read from Sylvia Plath, who
jarred her readers effectively by
describing remote reactions to
motherhood instead of the more
pleasant emotions that people like to
read about. This technique,
Middlebrook warned, can result in
simply "bad mannerisms," but has
been used effectively.
'Myth-Making'
The "myth-making" poets have
been re-creating the classic prototypes
of the past, Middlebrook explained.
The discovery that men and women
today are like men and women have
been for thousands of years, she said,
"simplistic as it is," has led to some
excellent modern poetry.
But while male poets have been
re-making these stories, women have
been converting the stories "to see
what's in it for them."
Middlebrook read Ann Sexton's
poem, "The Frog Prince," based on a
Grimm's fairy tale. Seen from the
virgin princess' point of view, the
poem is "about something I think men
never realized it was about,"
Middlebrook explained.
As soon as a woman poet publishes
her work, she finds that she is
evaluated as "a woman poet," not just
"a poet," English Prof. Diane
Middlebrook said last night at the
Tresidder "Themes in Contemporary
America" lecture series.
