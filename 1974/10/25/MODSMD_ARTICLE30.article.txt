# ACT Opener A Bit Bizarre

### DAVID W. MOYER 
The American Conservatory
Theatre opened its ninth season in
San Francisco with a production
of Richard 111 that featured the
forces of white versus black, weak
versus strong and bad against
worse. Director William Ball
played insistently upon a theme
of melodrama, with recurrent
contrapuntal strains (I use the
word advisedly) of bizarreness.
The bloody and inevitable climb
of Richard, Duke of Clarence, to
the throne became a fantasy of
evil on the Geary stage.
Elements of melodrama
abounded in Ball's interpretation
of this popular history. TTie play's
first scene found Richard
emerging from the bowels of the
stage "hell" to the Elizabethans
the very devil incarnate. He and
his henchmen wore black and grey
throughout; his virtuous
counterparts were clad in
gleaming white. The weapons on
evil's side were ringed with snakes;
those of the good guys had gold
stars.
Even the blocking (the
characters' arrangement on stage)
was straight from 19th century
melodrama, with perfectly
choreographed little groupings of
the opposing factions of the
court.
All of this melodrama deprived
the stage of real people. This
unreality was exacerbated by
Robert Fletcher's amazing
costuming. The bizarre wardrobe,
including such items as a bright
strawberry wig which extended
two feet on either side of
Elizabeth's head, was not without
some purpose.
The baroque and gaudily
tasteless fashions underscored the
decadence of the greedy court and
served as an explanation for
though not a justification of
Richard's bitter hatred and
murderous deed. Club-footed and
hunchbacked, "Deformed,
unfinish'd, sent before my time/
Into this breathing world, scarce
half made up," Richard is
ill-suited to a world of vanity.
Dispossessed thus, he vows: "I
am determined to prove a villain/
And hate the idle pleasures of
these days."
Randall Duk Kim in the role of
Richard did indeed prove a villain
but he was equally determined to
prove a living and breathing
human being. His performance
was superb. He played a variety of
moods and emotions and owned
them all; he was particularly adept
at playing Richard the dissembler
(read: actor). Richard's partner in
evil, the Duke of Buckingham
(Raye Birk), was another oasis of

plausibility in this morass of
melodrama.
Richard's unwavering realism,
when compared to the stilted
melodrama of the rest of the cast
as per the director's orders one
should add has the uncanny
effect of making Richard almost
sympathetic. This is a villain who
has killed his own brother, and
two young and innocent nephews
on his way to the crown, and yet
one is not exultant when the
knight in white armor, Richmond,
kills him in battle.
Why are we not cheering for
the virtuous prince (his vanity in
this production aside)? It is
because the victor is made of only
cardboard, as glittering as it may
be, while the vanquished is flesh
and blood and we recognize him

as thoroughly despicable as he
is as one of our own kind.
For this reason the production,
though powerful in its use of
broad strokes of primary colors, is
ultimately off balance. It seems
there is a bit too much bizarreness
for bizarreness' sake. I cite
another self-proclaimed critic's
sage advice: "that you o'erstep
not the modesty of nature; for
anything so overdone is from the
purpose of playing, whose end,
both at the first and now, was and
is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror
up to nature."
Randall Duk Kim has no doubt
read this same critic, but the
mirror to which he refers must be
held by the cast as a whole in
order to make the play totally
successful.
