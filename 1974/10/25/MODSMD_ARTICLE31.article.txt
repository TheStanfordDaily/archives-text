## Pass Interference: Stanford's Nemesis 
### CHRIS BAKER 
If anyone ever writes a book
entitled "Beating the Stanford
Football Team Made Easy," at
least half of it would have to be
devoted to methods of drawing
pass interference calls against Card
defensive backs in the closing
moments of the game.
This year, Penn State and San
Jose State have used this
technique to mount last quarter
comebacks against the Cards.
Stanford has been cited for pass
interference six times in all; in
every game except Washington.
The strategy is well worn. Two
years ago against California, two
crucial fourth quarter pass
interference calls helped the
Golden Bears pull off a 24-21
upset of Stanford.
Probably the most famous
application occurred last year
against USC, when Card halfback
Jim Kaffen was cited for pass
interference in another, crucial
fourth quarter situation, a call
which helped the Trojans pull off
one of their Coliseum miracles.
Tight Calls
Kaffen, now an assistant JV
coach, says "Last year it
happened to me once [USC] and

this year the trend has continued.
I'm not sure if they're looking
more for pass interference or
what, but the pass interference
calls they have made are really
tight calls," Kaffen said.
Kaffen explained that most of
the pass interference calls this
year have come when Stanford
players were behind the receiver
and reached in front to bat the
ball away. "Maybe we're just in
too good a position," he said.
Stanford has had the Pacific
Eight's best pass defense for the
past three seasons. Are Pac-8
officials watching the Cards more
carefully because of this?
"It's kind of funny," Kaffen
said. "We're not getting the same
calls offensively that we are
defensively, and we are primarily
a passing team."
But he didn't blame the
officials. "I won't say that they're
leveling on Stanford just because
we've been noted for the best pass
defense in the Pac-8 for the last
two or three years but you get
kind of wary."
Troubled Waters
Both crucial calls against the
Cards this year were called against
halfback Rich Waters.

Immediately after being cited for
interfering with San Jose State
wide receiver Ike Mcßee, Waters
was indignant, saying "it wasn't
close. I was pissed."
Since then, he appears to have
mellowed somewhat. "Well I guess
most of those calls have been
correct. The one against Kelly
Walker [UCLA] was a bummer
call ... I still feel that I didn't
interfere with him [Mcßee].When
it's that close it's basically a
judgment call."
"They do seem to be calling
pass interference a little bit
closer/' defensive backfield coach
George Seifert said. "But at the
same time there have been three
of them that have been pass
interference."
Closer Watch
Seifert said that the secondary
will be watched even more closely
because there have been so many
pass interference calls against the
Cards. "Now possibly people are
saying, 'Hey, watch those
' Stanford defensive backs because
they have been getting awfully
close to receivers.' So we might
have a bit of a reputation for that
right now and they're going to be
watching us even closer."
He said that the inexperience
of the secondary might be a
reason for the number of
interference calls this year. But
free safety Doc Blanchard, the
most experienced member of the
secondary, disagreed in part. "I

got called for it too [Michigan].
Experience does help a little in
close situations because you know
what you can't do," Blanchard
said.
Head coach Jack Christiansen
was an All-Pro defensive back six
times with the Detroit Lions. As
an assistant to coach John Ralston
in 1971, his defensive backs led
the Pac-8 in pass defense.
Chris thinks the calls have gone
both ways. "We've had some that
were definitely pass interference.
But in my opinion as a biased
coach, I would say that some of
them were not pass interference.
But at the point the official saw
'em he declared them pass
interference."
Walker, who was cited for
interference against UCLA, said "I
don't know whether they've
gotten a new rule or what. But it
seems that as soon as the ball hits
the person then they're calling it
even if you have a good shot at
him.
"It seems like the refs are
seeing what has happened and
then throwing the flag. If it was
really pass interference, he'd call
it right as the ball was being
thrown," Walker said.
Walker offered an analysis of
why Stanford is called for pass
interference late in the game. "At
the end of the game we're playing
more man-to-man and
we're playing them even closer so
we're trying that much harder."

coach, says "Last year it
happened to me once [USC] and

this year the trend has continued.
I'm not sure if they're looking
more for pass interference or
what, but the pass interference
calls they have made are really
tight calls," Kaffen said.
Kaffen explained that most of
the pass interference calls this
year have come when Stanford
players were behind the receiver
and reached in front to bat the
ball away. "Maybe we're just in
too good a position," he said.
Stanford has had the Pacific
Eight's best pass defense for the
past three seasons. Are Pac-8
officials watching the Cards more
carefully because of this?
"It's kind of funny," Kaffen
said. "We're not getting the same
calls offensively that we are
defensively, and we are primarily
a passing team."
But he didn't blame the
officials. "I won't say that they're
leveling on Stanford just because
we've been noted for the best pass
defense in the Pac-8 for the last
two or three years but you get
kind of wary."
Troubled Waters
Both crucial calls against the
Cards this year were called against
halfback Rich Waters.

Immediately after being cited for
interfering with San Jose State
wide receiver Ike Mcßee, Waters
was indignant, saying "it wasn't
close. I was pissed."
Since then, he appears to have
mellowed somewhat. "Well I guess
most of those calls have been
correct. The one against Kelly
Walker [UCLA] was a bummer
call ... I still feel that I didn't
interfere with him [Mcßee].When
it's that close it's basically a
judgment call."
"They do seem to be calling
pass interference a little bit
closer/' defensive backfield coach
George Seifert said. "But at the
same time there have been three
of them that have been pass
interference."
Closer Watch
Seifert said that the secondary
will be watched even more closely
because there have been so many
pass interference calls against the
Cards. "Now possibly people are
saying, 'Hey, watch those
' Stanford defensive backs because
they have been getting awfully
close to receivers.' So we might
have a bit of a reputation for that
right now and they're going to be
watching us even closer."
He said that the inexperience
of the secondary might be a
reason for the number of
interference calls this year. But
free safety Doc Blanchard, the
most experienced member of the
secondary, disagreed in part. "I

got called for it too [Michigan].
Experience does help a little in
close situations because you know
what you can't do," Blanchard
said.
Head coach Jack Christiansen
was an All-Pro defensive back six
times with the Detroit Lions. As
an assistant to coach John Ralston
in 1971, his defensive backs led
the Pac-8 in pass defense.
Chris thinks the calls have gone
both ways. "We've had some that
were definitely pass interference.
But in my opinion as a biased
coach, I would say that some of
them were not pass interference.
But at the point the official saw
'em he declared them pass
interference."
Walker, who was cited for
interference against UCLA, said "I
don't know whether they've
gotten a new rule or what. But it
seems that as soon as the ball hits
the person then they're calling it
even if you have a good shot at
him.
"It seems like the refs are
seeing what has happened and
then throwing the flag. If it was
really pass interference, he'd call
it right as the ball was being
thrown," Walker said.
Walker offered an analysis of
why Stanford is called for pass
interference late in the game. "At
the end of the game we're playing
more man-to-man and
we're playing them even closer so
we're trying that much harder."

RIGHT AND WRONG—Last year against California, Stanford defensive backs Randy Poltl (36) and Doc
Blanchard (29) effectively stopped an unidentified Golden Bear receiver without having pass interference
called. This year, Card defensive backs have continually been victimized by untimely yellow flags.
If anyone ever writes a book
entitled "Beating the Stanford
Football Team Made Easy," at
least half of it would have to be
devoted to methods of drawing
pass interference calls against Card
defensive backs in the closing
moments of the game.
This year, Penn State and San
Jose State have used this
technique to mount last quarter
comebacks against the Cards.
Stanford has been cited for pass
interference six times in all; in
every game except Washington.
The strategy is well worn. Two
years ago against California, two
crucial fourth quarter pass
interference calls helped the
Golden Bears pull off a 24-21
upset of Stanford.
Probably the most famous
application occurred last year
against USC, when Card halfback
Jim Kaffen was cited for pass
interference in another, crucial
fourth quarter situation, a call
which helped the Trojans pull off
one of their Coliseum miracles.

we've been noted for the best pass
defense in the Pac-8 for the last
two or three years but you get
kind of wary."
Troubled Waters
Both crucial calls against the
Cards this year were called against
halfback Rich Waters.

Immediately after being cited for
interfering with San Jose State
wide receiver Ike Mcßee, Waters
was indignant, saying "it wasn't
close. I was pissed."
Since then, he appears to have
mellowed somewhat. "Well I guess
most of those calls have been
correct. The one against Kelly
Walker [UCLA] was a bummer
call ... I still feel that I didn't
interfere with him [Mcßee].When
it's that close it's basically a
judgment call."
"They do seem to be calling
pass interference a little bit
closer/' defensive backfield coach
George Seifert said. "But at the
same time there have been three
of them that have been pass
interference."
Closer Watch
Seifert said that the secondary
will be watched even more closely
because there have been so many
pass interference calls against the
Cards. "Now possibly people are
saying, 'Hey, watch those
' Stanford defensive backs because
they have been getting awfully
close to receivers.' So we might
have a bit of a reputation for that
right now and they're going to be
watching us even closer."
He said that the inexperience
of the secondary might be a
reason for the number of
interference calls this year. But
free safety Doc Blanchard, the
most experienced member of the
secondary, disagreed in part. "I

got called for it too [Michigan].
Experience does help a little in
close situations because you know
what you can't do," Blanchard
said.
Head coach Jack Christiansen
was an All-Pro defensive back six
times with the Detroit Lions. As
an assistant to coach John Ralston
in 1971, his defensive backs led
the Pac-8 in pass defense.
Chris thinks the calls have gone
both ways. "We've had some that
were definitely pass interference.
But in my opinion as a biased
coach, I would say that some of
them were not pass interference.
But at the point the official saw
'em he declared them pass
interference."
Walker, who was cited for
interference against UCLA, said "I
don't know whether they've
gotten a new rule or what. But it
seems that as soon as the ball hits
the person then they're calling it
even if you have a good shot at
him.
"It seems like the refs are
seeing what has happened and
then throwing the flag. If it was
really pass interference, he'd call
it right as the ball was being
thrown," Walker said.
Walker offered an analysis of
why Stanford is called for pass
interference late in the game. "At
the end of the game we're playing
more man-to-man and
we're playing them even closer so
we're trying that much harder."

RIGHT AND WRONG—Last year against California, Stanford defensive backs Randy Poltl (36) and Doc
Blanchard (29) effectively stopped an unidentified Golden Bear receiver without having pass interference
called. This year, Card defensive backs have continually been victimized by untimely yellow flags.
If anyone ever writes a book
entitled "Beating the Stanford
Football Team Made Easy," at
least half of it would have to be
devoted to methods of drawing
pass interference calls against Card
defensive backs in the closing
moments of the game.
This year, Penn State and San
Jose State have used this
technique to mount last quarter
comebacks against the Cards.
Stanford has been cited for pass
interference six times in all; in
every game except Washington.
The strategy is well worn. Two
years ago against California, two
crucial fourth quarter pass
interference calls helped the
Golden Bears pull off a 24-21
upset of Stanford.
Probably the most famous
application occurred last year
against USC, when Card halfback
Jim Kaffen was cited for pass
interference in another, crucial
fourth quarter situation, a call
which helped the Trojans pull off
one of their Coliseum miracles.
Tight Calls
Kaffen, now an assistant JV
coach, says "Last year it
happened to me once [USC] and

this year the trend has continued.
I'm not sure if they're looking
more for pass interference or
what, but the pass interference
calls they have made are really
tight calls," Kaffen said.
Kaffen explained that most of
the pass interference calls this
year have come when Stanford
players were behind the receiver
and reached in front to bat the
ball away. "Maybe we're just in
too good a position," he said.
Stanford has had the Pacific
Eight's best pass defense for the
past three seasons. Are Pac-8
officials watching the Cards more
carefully because of this?
"It's kind of funny," Kaffen
said. "We're not getting the same
calls offensively that we are
defensively, and we are primarily
a passing team."
But he didn't blame the
officials. "I won't say that they're
leveling on Stanford just because
we've been noted for the best pass
defense in the Pac-8 for the last
two or three years but you get
kind of wary."
