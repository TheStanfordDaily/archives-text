# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
Our fearful forecaster got
lucky last week, picking all
four Pacific Eight games
correctly, and hitting the
17-point Stanford-
Washington spread on the
nose. Our record is now
19-2-2 (shucks, folks, it's
nothing).
This weekend, that loss
column may burgeon
skyward, though, as we've got
three games that are slim
pickings.
Our own Cards travel by
plane and bus to Pullman,
and if they want a berth in
the Rose Bowl, they'll have
to win. We think the curse of
the Pa louse, also known as
the Washington State defense,
will hold it dose for awhile,
but in the end, Stanford will
win.
They're going berserk in
Berkeley, and not because
Tim Leary may be getting out

of jail. It's the football team.
Cat-UCLA should be one of
the finest games of the year,
with two potent offenses
facing talented, but crippled,
defenses. We've been picking
the Bears all year, and see no
reason to stop now.
The third dose game is
Oregon and Washington.
There isn't much to say about
this one, except that Oregon,
on the strength of a good
showing against USC, might
be better. The big news will
come after the game, when
the Washington Daily's sports
editor, Miss Chris Swan son,
plans to enter the Husky
locker room. Our prediction:
she won't make it .. . past
the security guard, that is.
