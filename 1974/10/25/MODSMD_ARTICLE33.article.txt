# Pullman Goes Wild On Saturdays
## Cards Battle Palouse Curse 
### PETE BHATIA 
(Editor's Note: The author is one of the few lifelong Pullman
residents ever to leave town.)
In the late 19th century, a cattleman by the name of Bolin Farr
camped overnight at the fork of three streams of the Palouse River in
southeast Washington.
A few years later Farr had founded there a small community
known as Three Forks. The community was essentially a stop-over for
cattle drives and a center for the area's growing farm trade.
Today, that town is known as Pullman, and nothing much has
changed except the cows are all in barns at a state university founded
there in 1890. Stanford's football team visits this exciting place for
tomorrow's 1:30 game with Washington State, broadcast on KSFO
(560 AM).
Today, Pullman is a "thriving" city of 20,000 (14,000 of whom are
students), built on four hillls, located in the midst of the world's
richest wheat producing area, the Palouse Empire. There is not much
to do in Pullman. The nearest city is Spokane, site of Expo '74, some
75 miles away.
Pastimes
People in Pullman either 1) drink or 2) watch television. Playboy
reported a few years back that the combined student bodies of
Washington State and the University of Idaho (eight miles away in
Moscow, Idaho) consume more beer per capita than any other groups
in the U.S.

Because of the lack of things to
do, not many top grade athletes
have come to old Wazzu (as some
students call WSU), and for many
years the Cougs have been the
doormat of the Pac-8 in just
about every sport.
Then in the late 60s magical
things began to happen. A man
named Marv Harshman built up a
good basketball program with
mammoths from Montana and
good in-state players. The result
was a regular screaming group of
5000 alcoholics in ancient Bohler

Gym on the Pullman campus.
Now, the Cougs play basketball
in a beautiful new coliseum which
seats 12,000 maniacs. The only
problem is that Harshman left for
the greener pastures of that
Seattle school more money and
a better program. Basketball went
back'to the "bad ol' days."
1 Luck Of The Irish
However, in 1968, just prior to
the departure of Harsh, a miracle
occurred.A smiling Irishman, with
a grin that could make Larry
Horton join a fraternity, came
riding a cloud over the mountains
from Montana and gave the
"Curse of the Palouse" new life
this time in the unlikely sport of
football.
This cheerleading cherub, who
goes by the moniker of Jim
Sweeney, promised the starving
Pullmanites a great future (that
means Rose Bowl) and the crazed
multitude raised their bottles high
to salute the new hero.
For Stanford, the Cougs have
always been a tough number.
Sweeney has always been able to
coax those previously missing
top-grade athletes to Pullman.
His teams have featured hard
driving backs including current
starting pros Bernard Jackson of
Cincinnati and Ken Grandberry of
Chicago mixed with sound
passing. But the forte of a
Sweeney team has always been a
hard-nosed animal defense.

Animal. A football word. A
key reason why the "Curse of the
Palouse" has plagued Stanford.
Sweeney's teams are tough.
However, his players, compared
to Stanford's, aren't too bright.
They are insulted by the fact
Stanford players major in pre-med
or engineering instead of P.E. or
recreation.
Sweeney, a psychological
master, plays on this and gets his
teams up by reading them
newspaper clippings,
manufacturing quotes and
cheerleading. Unfortunately for
the Cards, it works.
Two years ago, in coach Jack
Christiansen's first year, the
Card's marched into Pullman's
Martin Stadium and were
demolished 27-13 by the Cougs
before a sellout crowd. You can
imagine the bottles were flying in
jubilation that day.
The previous year, 1971, the
Don Bunce-led Ralstonites fell
24-23 on a last-second Don Weet
field goal in Stanford Stadium.
There were good years though,
like last year's 45-14 win at
Stanford and Jim Plunkett's
senior campaign, 1970, when the
Cards squashed the Cougs 63-14
in Spokane.
The origin of the curse for
Stanford fans dates back to earlier
years. From 1958-64 WSU beat
the Indians seven consecutive
times at both locations, with
many of those losses complete
runaways in Pullman. Currently,
Wazzu holds the series edge
16-13-1.
Washington State rarely gets to
use its curse, though. Due to the
demands of the big-money
football schools on their schedule
the Cougs play only two or three
games a year in their own
stadium. The remainder are
played in Spokane's larger Joe
Albi Stadium, or more recently at
UW's Husky Stadium in Seattle. >
Thus, when the "normal"
schools (Stanford, Cal, Oregon,
Oregon State) come to play in
Pullman's 22,000 seat stadium,
the town goes crazy. The nights
before and after the game the
town, particularly the students, is
involved in one big tailgate party.
During the game, there is not a
sober fan in the place at least
on the student side.
From this environment comes
"the curse." No one, but no one,
wins in Pullman, except the home
team. In fact, since the opening of
the rebuilt stadium two seasons
ago, the Cougars are undefeated in
Pullman.
The Cougs this week, after
playing Ohio State, USC and
UCLA the last three weeks, are
hungry for a win. Their only win
this season was in the "Battle of
the Palouse" against traditional
rival Idaho.
However, despite the curse,
Jim Sweeney's theatrics and
Stanford's dismal season up to
now, the Cards are seven-point
favorites Saturday. And on paper,
at least, there can be no doubt
that Stanford has the better
football team.
