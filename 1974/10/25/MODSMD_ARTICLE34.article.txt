# Anderson Leads Charge
## Poloists’ Key Game Today 
### BOB KUSTEL 
The fate of Stanford's water polo teams could
V well be decided by the outcome of this afternoon's
crucial battle with southland rival UCLA.
The two teams are vying for a single berth in the
upcoming NCAA Championships, and the Bruins,
by virtue of their 5-4 win over.theXards two weeks
ago in Los Angeles, could smother Stanford's
chances with a win in the 3 p.m. encounter at
V DeGuerre Pools.
Card coach Art Lambert is well aware of the
importance of this game, and feels that in order to
win the Cards will have to force UCLA to "play our
game." He notes that they did this successfully
only in spurts in Los Angeles, and hopes for some
"consistency" against the talented Bruins,
y One player Lambert feels will help the team
maintain consistency is senior Dean Anderson,
who, according to Lambert, "keeps things going
with his mobility and aggressiveness." Anderson
starred in last Saturday's loss to Cal, scoring three
goals and turning in two fine assists.
"Aggressive" is a peculiar way to describe the
Anderson, who, at least out of the water,
is considered by nearly all of his teammates to be
"mellowest dude out there."
Anderson's seemingly carefree nature might lead
one to suspect a personality conflict with the
excitable Lambert.
Not so, emphasizes Anderson, who feels that

although "boisterous during the game, Lambert is
one of the most sincere persons I know."
Dean has great respect for Lambert's coaching
knowledge and ability, and credits him with the
improvement of Stanford's water polo program. He
rates Stanford's chances in the NCAA's "as good as
anybody's," except, of course, Cal. But he says
even the Bears are "by no means unbeatable."
It would be an understatement to say that
Anderson has been a key figure in Stanford's
aquatic program in his four years here. An
All-American freestyler the past three swim
seasons, last year he accomplished the relatively
rare feat of being named All-American in both
water polo and swimming.
Anderson will graduate this year with a degree in
Communications, and hopes to return next year
enrolled in the School of Education STEP
program. Beyond that, he sees coaching as a
possibility.
The Cards' back is to the wall this afternoon,
but led by Anderson, they will hopefully maintain
the consistency they have lacked all season long.
Saturday Stanford will play another team that
has already beaten it once as the Cards take on Cal
Poly-Pomona at 10 a.m. in the Junior
College pool. Pomona edged the Cards 7-6 in the
second game of the season, but the much-improved
Cards should have considerably fewer problems
this time.

THE MELLOWEST DUDE—Senior Dean Anderson, described by teammates as "the mellowest dude out
there," takes advice from coach Art Lambert. Anderson, an All-American in both swimming and water
polo, will lead the Card poloists in their big game against UCLA today.
The fate of Stanford's water polo teams could
V well be decided by the outcome of this afternoon's
crucial battle with southland rival UCLA.
The two teams are vying for a single berth in the
upcoming NCAA Championships, and the Bruins,
by virtue of their 5-4 win over.theXards two weeks
ago in Los Angeles, could smother Stanford's
chances with a win in the 3 p.m. encounter at
V DeGuerre Pools.
Card coach Art Lambert is well aware of the
importance of this game, and feels that in order to
win the Cards will have to force UCLA to "play our
game." He notes that they did this successfully
only in spurts in Los Angeles, and hopes for some
"consistency" against the talented Bruins,
y One player Lambert feels will help the team
maintain consistency is senior Dean Anderson,
who, according to Lambert, "keeps things going
with his mobility and aggressiveness." Anderson
starred in last Saturday's loss to Cal, scoring three
goals and turning in two fine assists.
"Aggressive" is a peculiar way to describe the
Anderson, who, at least out of the water,
is considered by nearly all of his teammates to be
"mellowest dude out there."
Anderson's seemingly carefree nature might lead
one to suspect a personality conflict with the
excitable Lambert.
Not so, emphasizes Anderson, who feels that

although "boisterous during the game, Lambert is
one of the most sincere persons I know."
Dean has great respect for Lambert's coaching
knowledge and ability, and credits him with the
improvement of Stanford's water polo program. He
rates Stanford's chances in the NCAA's "as good as
anybody's," except, of course, Cal. But he says
even the Bears are "by no means unbeatable."
It would be an understatement to say that
Anderson has been a key figure in Stanford's
aquatic program in his four years here. An
All-American freestyler the past three swim
seasons, last year he accomplished the relatively
rare feat of being named All-American in both
water polo and swimming.
Anderson will graduate this year with a degree in
Communications, and hopes to return next year
enrolled in the School of Education STEP
program. Beyond that, he sees coaching as a
possibility.
The Cards' back is to the wall this afternoon,
but led by Anderson, they will hopefully maintain
the consistency they have lacked all season long.
Saturday Stanford will play another team that
has already beaten it once as the Cards take on Cal
Poly-Pomona at 10 a.m. in the Junior
College pool. Pomona edged the Cards 7-6 in the
second game of the season, but the much-improved
Cards should have considerably fewer problems
this time.
