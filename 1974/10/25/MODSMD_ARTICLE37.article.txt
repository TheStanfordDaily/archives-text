# Spotlight On Women This Week
## Hockey Team Still Unbeaten 
### CHARLIE WHEELER 
Stanford's field hockey motto
should read: "But you know
we're gonna get you!"
Chico State learned this
first-hand in the Cards' home
opener on Wednesday afternoon.
After a slow first half, Stanford
regrouped and pulled away to a
4-1 victory. The win raised the
Cards' season and conference
record to 2-0.
During the opening period, it
looked as if the final score would
be reversed. Chico used a new
offense which disorganized the
Stanford defense. Only the strong
play of goalkeeper Betsy Morris
and a liberal dose of good luck
kept the visitors from scoring in
the first half. Stanford led 1-0 at
the half on a goal scored by junior
Ann Walker.
Walker and Kathy Levinson
exchanged positions in the front
line at the start of the second half
and the change revitalized the
Cards' offense. Three goals were
scored in rapid succession. Anne
Killefer knocked the first in.
Levinson followed with her third
tally of the season and Lyse
Strnad finished the day's scoring
for Stanford.
The junior varsity game was in
many ways a replay of the varsity
match. After a somewhat
disorganized and scoreless first
half, a change in the Stanford
front line sparked an offensive
explosion for a 3-0 victory over
the Chico JV squad.
Freshman Cheryl Johnston
entered the game at halftime and
scored after only two minutes of
play. Her goal gave the JV team a
momentum it never lost.
