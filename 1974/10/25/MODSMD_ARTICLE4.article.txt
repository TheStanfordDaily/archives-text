# But Problems Inspire Alternatives
## Officials Support Advising Structure 
### JON BIGELOW Second of Two Parts 
Despite serious implementation problems, most
University administrators who work with the
undergraduate academic advising program agree the
program's basic structure is adequate.
As it stands now, the system is divided into three
parts: the freshman in-residence program, the
program for undeclared sophomores, and the
departmental programs, which are more or less
autonomous.
A strong point of the system, according to G.
Robert Hamrdla, director of the Academic
Information Center (AlC),is the freshman program.
Having all the freshmen together in one place(the
dorms) allows the adviser and the student easier
access to one another, and permits better
structuring.
For instance, Hamrdla himself is an adviser with
several freshman advisees living in Toyon. The
resident fellow there has appointed one of his
resident staff members to each adviser with advisees
in Toyon, so that Hamrdla can utilize the staff
member as a constant liaison with the student.
Practical
One practical application of this is the ability to
the staff member to arrange adviser-advisee dinners
and functions. Part of the resident fellow's job

description is to assist the advisers.
"The skeleton of the freshman system is good
though I think it has more potential than we are
currently exploiting," Hamrdla says.
Greater problems are encountered when dealing
with sophomores who haven't chosen their majors.
"Decisions for majors are often very poorly thought
out," claims Asst. Dean of Undergraduate Studies B.
Michael Closson.
Sometimes students choose majors which have
light requirements or to be better prepared for law
school. "Decisions are too often made by default.
Students should explore their options," he says.
'Facts'
Closson adds that advisers should be utilized to
combat this problem: "Students just use faculty for
facts sometimes. That's the wrong way. They
[advisers] should be mature adults that students can
talk to."
Often, students contribute to their own
confusion. Many shy away from seeking advice;
sometimes the student feels he already "knows the
ropes," Hamrdla says.
This is true especially among sophomores, he
notes, and these are the very people who often need
advice the most. In addition, sophomores are not
found clustered in residences, so that structuring
like that in the freshman program is difficult to

achieve.
Many voice the opinion that such students are
beyond helping. "Students only get advice if they
want it," says Engineering Prof. Henry Parker, a
long-time participant in the advising program.
The prevalent belief is that many of the problems
with the advising system lie equally with the
students and faculty. As Closson notes, "the reason
that advising is so poorly thought of is that our
expectations are too idealistic."
Idealistic or not, hopes for improved advising
have prompted various proposals for alterations in
the system. A small storm is brewing on the horizon
over one proposal in particular.
SCIRE Director Alice Supton and the SCIRE
policy board are contemplating creation of a task
force to look into the feasibility of "peer advising,"
that is, the use of students as advisers.
Their contention is that faculty members are
often too busy or too estranged from the student's
world to give advice where it is needed.
Centralized Office
Supton envisions a centralized peer advising
office, where students might go to talk with fellow
students knowledgeable in different areas to
investigate career possibilities in various fields. She
hopes the task force will focus on the departmental
