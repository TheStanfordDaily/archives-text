### 
The women's golf team got off
to a good start yesterday, winding
up two shots behind in the team
competition of the Stanford
Women's Collegiate Invitational
golf tournament on the Stanford
course.
Under overcast skies,
Stanford's Pam Palmieri shot a 80
to tie her for the lead in the
individual competition with
Robin Walton of Arizona State.
Pat Cornet's 85 combined
with teammate Palmieri to put the
Stanford team just two shots
behind Arizona State, the leaders.
The Arizona State team put on
a powerful performance with
players finishing the first round
tied for first, third and fourth.
"With the players bunched the
way they are, its anybody's
ballgame," Stanford Coach Carroll
Diaz said after the round.
Seventeen players have scores
from 80 to 88, she noted, an
especially significant figure since
the well-trapped, tree-lined
Stanford layout is ranked by Golf
Digest as one of the nation's 100
toughest courses.
Even if it rains, Diaz said
today's final round will get
underway at 9 a.m.
Surprised that her team did so
well yesterday, Diaz is expecting
lower scores in today's round.
"That's what usually happens,"
she said.
Sixteen teams from 11 schools
are represented in the
competition, including Northern
California entries UC-Davis,
Sacramento State, Cal and San
Francisco State.
