Sirica Advises Jury On John Dean
WASHINGTON U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica
yesterday described John W. Dean 111, the prosecution's
chief witness in the Watergate cover-up trial, as less than a
"lily-white angel in this case."
As the jurors listened, Sirica said it is up to them to
decide what parts of Dean's testimony to believe.
On a day marked by several heated exchanges among
prosecution and defense lawyers quarreling over Dean's
credibility on the stand, Sirica said: "I doq't think anyone
is trying to paint this gentleman as a lily-white angel in this
case.
"Let's be frank about it, he has already confessed to
what he did," Sirica added.
Assistant Special Prosecutor James S. Neal then chipped
in,"And he's paying for it."
As the 18th day of the trial closed, Watergate
prosecutors disclosed that their next witness will be
convicted Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt.
At one point during the defense cross-examination of
Dean, and after an exchange among lawyers, Sirica said he
was worried about the mood inside his courtroom.
"I consider this a serious case and I don't want this case
to have what I call a carnival atmosphere to it."
Ford Blasts Democratic Congress
CHICAGO Blaming a Democratic "legislative
dictatorship" for the nation's economic ills, President Ford
campaigned yesterday in lowa and Illinois for a Congress
that will support his domestic and foreign policies.
In a pair of lowa speeches, Ford sought to soothe
unhappy farmers. And he reopened his attack on the
Democratic-controlled Congress, accusing it of
"undermining our foreign relations with handcuff-like
restrictions."
From Des Moines, Ford was heading for Melvin, 111.,

population 492, and a fairgrounds celebration honoring
retiring House Republican whip Leslie Arends. Then it was
on to Chicago for a Republican fund-raising banquet.
At each stop in his 15-hour campaign day, Ford pressed
his effort to stave off predicted major Democratic gains in
Congress.
"Some of the friends in the opposition seem to think
that what is needed is a veto-proof Congress." Ford told
1000 persons at a $5O-a-plate luncheon in Des Moines.
"The fact of the matter is that it was heavy Democratic
majorities over the years which helped create most of the
problems we are faced with today."
Nixon May Need Phlebitis Surgery
LONG BEACH, Calif.—Richard M. Nixon was reported
yesterday to be depressed and in severe pain as his doctor
weighed whether surgery is needed to combat the former
president's phlebitis.
Dr. John C. Lungren said the decision on whether Nixon
will need surgery will depend on whether
hospital-administered anticoagulant drugs are successful in
treating the inflamed veins which have painfully swollen
Nixon's left leg.
In phlebitis surgery, the inflamed veins are often tied
off.
"He came in last night for tests and didn't expect to
stay," a source close to Nixon said. "They told him it was a
very dangerous situation, and when they told him this he
became very depressed and grumpy."
Soviets Promise Effort Toward Detente
MOSCOW Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
received a new commitment to detente yesterday after
opening talks with Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
"Further and big successes require efforts and vigorous
efforts on both sides," Foreign Minister Andrei A.
Gromyko declared in a luncheon toast. "We are prepared to
make those efforts."
Kissinger, who surveyed the Middle East and prospects
for wider trade in a three-hour session with Brezhnev,
returned to the Kremlin in early evening for a second
round.
The three-and-a-half day Kissinger visit is expected to set
the stage for a short summit meeting between Brezhnev and
President Ford around Thanksgiving to approve guidelines
for a new treaty limiting offensive nuclear weapons.
U.S. officials described the first meeting as "very cordial,
very friendly." There was no word of concrete results,
however.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy today. Mostly fair tonight and tomorrow
with occasional cloudiness. Lows tonight in the upper 40s
to mid 50s. Highs both days in the 60s to low 70s.

Soviets Promise Effort Toward Detente
MOSCOW Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
received a new commitment to detente yesterday after
opening talks with Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
"Further and big successes require efforts and vigorous
efforts on both sides," Foreign Minister Andrei A.
Gromyko declared in a luncheon toast. "We are prepared to
make those efforts."
Kissinger, who surveyed the Middle East and prospects
for wider trade in a three-hour session with Brezhnev,
returned to the Kremlin in early evening for a second
round.
The three-and-a-half day Kissinger visit is expected to set
the stage for a short summit meeting between Brezhnev and
President Ford around Thanksgiving to approve guidelines
for a new treaty limiting offensive nuclear weapons.
U.S. officials described the first meeting as "very cordial,
very friendly." There was no word of concrete results,
however.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy today. Mostly fair tonight and tomorrow
with occasional cloudiness. Lows tonight in the upper 40s
to mid 50s. Highs both days in the 60s to low 70s.
Sirica Advises Jury On John Dean
WASHINGTON U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica
yesterday described John W. Dean 111, the prosecution's
chief witness in the Watergate cover-up trial, as less than a
"lily-white angel in this case."
As the jurors listened, Sirica said it is up to them to
decide what parts of Dean's testimony to believe.
On a day marked by several heated exchanges among
prosecution and defense lawyers quarreling over Dean's
credibility on the stand, Sirica said: "I doq't think anyone
is trying to paint this gentleman as a lily-white angel in this
case.
"Let's be frank about it, he has already confessed to
what he did," Sirica added.
Assistant Special Prosecutor James S. Neal then chipped
in,"And he's paying for it."
As the 18th day of the trial closed, Watergate
prosecutors disclosed that their next witness will be
convicted Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt.
At one point during the defense cross-examination of
Dean, and after an exchange among lawyers, Sirica said he
was worried about the mood inside his courtroom.
"I consider this a serious case and I don't want this case
to have what I call a carnival atmosphere to it."
Ford Blasts Democratic Congress
CHICAGO Blaming a Democratic "legislative
dictatorship" for the nation's economic ills, President Ford
campaigned yesterday in lowa and Illinois for a Congress
that will support his domestic and foreign policies.
In a pair of lowa speeches, Ford sought to soothe
unhappy farmers. And he reopened his attack on the
Democratic-controlled Congress, accusing it of
"undermining our foreign relations with handcuff-like
restrictions."
From Des Moines, Ford was heading for Melvin, 111.,

population 492, and a fairgrounds celebration honoring
retiring House Republican whip Leslie Arends. Then it was
on to Chicago for a Republican fund-raising banquet.
At each stop in his 15-hour campaign day, Ford pressed
his effort to stave off predicted major Democratic gains in
Congress.
"Some of the friends in the opposition seem to think
that what is needed is a veto-proof Congress." Ford told
1000 persons at a $5O-a-plate luncheon in Des Moines.
"The fact of the matter is that it was heavy Democratic
majorities over the years which helped create most of the
problems we are faced with today."
Nixon May Need Phlebitis Surgery
LONG BEACH, Calif.—Richard M. Nixon was reported
yesterday to be depressed and in severe pain as his doctor
weighed whether surgery is needed to combat the former
president's phlebitis.
Dr. John C. Lungren said the decision on whether Nixon
will need surgery will depend on whether
hospital-administered anticoagulant drugs are successful in
treating the inflamed veins which have painfully swollen
Nixon's left leg.
In phlebitis surgery, the inflamed veins are often tied
off.
"He came in last night for tests and didn't expect to
stay," a source close to Nixon said. "They told him it was a
very dangerous situation, and when they told him this he
became very depressed and grumpy."
