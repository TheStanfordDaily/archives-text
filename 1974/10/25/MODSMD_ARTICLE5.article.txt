# Kansas Voters May Betray GOP Candidate Dole
## 
### DON COX 
When a liberal Democrat runs against a
conservative incumbent Republican in Kansas,
the result has always been a foregone
conclusion. Until now.
In a state where Richard Nixon polled 61
percent of the vote in 1960 and Barry
Goldwater drew over 45 percent in 1964, it is
hard to believe that Sen. Robert Dole is in a
real horse race with his Democratic challenger,
Congressman William Roy.
As a freshman senator, Dole made a
political name for himself as a loyal defender
of Richard Nixon's policies. His reward was
the Republican national chairmanship.
But Dole's stepping stone to national
prominence has become a political millstone
and he has been only partially successful in
putting distance between himself and
Watergate.

( "I get asked once a night about Watergate
as if I directed the whole scenario," Dole
complains. Dole and the Republican National
Committee were cleared by the Senate
Watergate Committee of any involvement in
the illegal activities of the Committee for the
Re-Election of the President,
j While Roy denies he has made Watergate an
issue in the race, he did say "many people
think Sen. Dole, as Republican national
chairman, knew or should have known about
Watergate." But he adds "I have no reason to
believe Sen. Dole knew."
Roy admits the backlash of public opinion
from Watergate significantly aided his
; campaign, but he has nonetheless

"soft-pedaled" the issue.
Kansas Republicans are unhappy that Dole
took the chairmanship and preoccupied
himself with party concerns instead of his
constituents. Dole insists "it is the best thing
that ever happened happened in a long time
in the state of Kansas. We have been able to
open more doors properly as a result of being
the chairman."

Roy has been hammering away at this sore
spot. "I think Kansans deserve a senator who
will serve their state and their nation, our state
and our nation, rather than choosing to serve
his party," he has said repeatedly.
Dole, 51, has complained about President
Ford undercutting him. Republicans were
encouraged when Ford took over, but then
"along came the pardon of Nixon and
amnesty."
"I don't need any more help of that kind
before November," he said.
A witty, slashing campaigner in previous
elections, Dole has toned down his abrasive
technique and gone on the defensive. He says
Roy has misrepresented his voting record and
accuses Roy of mudslinging.
Mud
One of Dole's television spots shows a
poster of smiling Bob Dole as a hand slings a
glob of "Watergate" and "antifarm" mud at
the poster while a voice-over identifies the
slinger as Roy.
Roy insists that his campaign is concerned
with issues, not personalities.
To the Kansas farmers Roy says that Dole
voted against Kansas agriculture when he
opposed an appropriations bill including farm
program funds.
Dole says he was attempting to curb
government spending as part of the fight on
inflation. He takes pains to point out that he
will be the senior Republican on the Senate
Agriculture Committee if re-elected.
'Majority Member'
Roy says "Kansas needs a majority member
of the committee."
Roy, a lawyer and a physician who
specialized in obstetrics and gynecology, is a
strong proponent of health care legislation and
programs "for the less fortunate." He claims

Dole has voted against Medicare and social
security.
He's also in an interesting position in regard
to the abortion issue in the campaign as a
physician he has performed legal abortions.
Roy says he is personally against abortions but
thinks the law should be neutral on the
subject.
Dole is a strong advocate of a

constitutional amendment prohibiting
abortion.
No Amnesty
Dole was an opponent of Ford's amnesty
plan. He said he would have opposed amnesty
"as long as there are evaders who are living the
life of luxury in other countries and thumbing
their noses at America." Roy supported a
Ford-style conditional amnesty.
Roy, 48, is completing his second term in
the House. Republicans have been trying to
depict Roy as a liberal, left-wing congressman
and claim he would owe his election to
AFL-CIO President George Meany.
Political analysts and recent polls have
placed Roy and Dole neck and neck as
election day approaches. Dole has made up
some ground on Roy.
"It's a tight race and I guess I am a little bit
behind," said Dole, who has never lost in 10
races starting with his election to the state
House of Representatives 25 years ago.
Shift
A victory by Roy could signal a voter shift
away from the old Republican line and toward
a more independent affiliation, observers say.
Roy shares this view.
"Bob Dole is a symbol of a certain type of
politics, a type of politics that should
disappear from the face of the earth," Roy
said.
Whether the Kansas voters are indeed going
to condemn Dole's politics, and whether a
victory for Roy can be interpreted that way,
remains to be seen.
But the emerging Republican majority that
was forecast with Richard Nixon's landslide
re-election two years ago seems to resemble
more closely an emerging independent
majority that Democrats hope to woo into
their camp over the next 10 years.

This is the last of five articles examining
key Senate races across the country.

prominence has become a political millstone
and he has been only partially successful in

complains. Dole and the Republican National
Committee were cleared by the Senate
Watergate Committee of any involvement in
the illegal activities of the Committee for the
Re-Election of the President,
j While Roy denies he has made Watergate an
issue in the race, he did say "many people

Roy admits the backlash of public opinion
from Watergate significantly aided his

"soft-pedaled" the issue.
Kansas Republicans are unhappy that Dole
took the chairmanship and preoccupied
himself with party concerns instead of his
constituents. Dole insists "it is the best thing
that ever happened happened in a long time
in the state of Kansas. We have been able to
open more doors properly as a result of being
the chairman."

Roy has been hammering away at this sore
spot. "I think Kansans deserve a senator who
will serve their state and their nation, our state
and our nation, rather than choosing to serve
his party," he has said repeatedly.
Dole, 51, has complained about President
Ford undercutting him. Republicans were
encouraged when Ford took over, but then
"along came the pardon of Nixon and
amnesty."
"I don't need any more help of that kind

A witty, slashing campaigner in previous
elections, Dole has toned down his abrasive
technique and gone on the defensive. He says
Roy has misrepresented his voting record and
accuses Roy of mudslinging.
Mud
One of Dole's television spots shows a
poster of smiling Bob Dole as a hand slings a
glob of "Watergate" and "antifarm" mud at
the poster while a voice-over identifies the
slinger as Roy.
Roy insists that his campaign is concerned
with issues, not personalities.
To the Kansas farmers Roy says that Dole
voted against Kansas agriculture when he
opposed an appropriations bill including farm
program funds.
Dole says he was attempting to curb
government spending as part of the fight on
inflation. He takes pains to point out that he
will be the senior Republican on the Senate
Agriculture Committee if re-elected.
'Majority Member'
Roy says "Kansas needs a majority member
of the committee."
Roy, a lawyer and a physician who
specialized in obstetrics and gynecology, is a
strong proponent of health care legislation and
programs "for the less fortunate." He claims

Dole has voted against Medicare and social
security.
He's also in an interesting position in regard
to the abortion issue in the campaign as a
physician he has performed legal abortions.
Roy says he is personally against abortions but
thinks the law should be neutral on the
subject.
Dole is a strong advocate of a

constitutional amendment prohibiting
abortion.
No Amnesty
Dole was an opponent of Ford's amnesty
plan. He said he would have opposed amnesty
"as long as there are evaders who are living the
life of luxury in other countries and thumbing
their noses at America." Roy supported a
Ford-style conditional amnesty.
Roy, 48, is completing his second term in
the House. Republicans have been trying to
depict Roy as a liberal, left-wing congressman
and claim he would owe his election to
AFL-CIO President George Meany.
Political analysts and recent polls have
placed Roy and Dole neck and neck as
election day approaches. Dole has made up
some ground on Roy.
"It's a tight race and I guess I am a little bit
behind," said Dole, who has never lost in 10
races starting with his election to the state
House of Representatives 25 years ago.
Shift
A victory by Roy could signal a voter shift
away from the old Republican line and toward
a more independent affiliation, observers say.
Roy shares this view.
"Bob Dole is a symbol of a certain type of
politics, a type of politics that should
disappear from the face of the earth," Roy
said.
Whether the Kansas voters are indeed going
to condemn Dole's politics, and whether a
victory for Roy can be interpreted that way,
remains to be seen.
But the emerging Republican majority that
was forecast with Richard Nixon's landslide
re-election two years ago seems to resemble
more closely an emerging independent
majority that Democrats hope to woo into
their camp over the next 10 years.

key Senate races across the country.


Robert Dole


William Roy
When a liberal Democrat runs against a
conservative incumbent Republican in Kansas,
the result has always been a foregone
conclusion. Until now.
In a state where Richard Nixon polled 61
percent of the vote in 1960 and Barry
Goldwater drew over 45 percent in 1964, it is
hard to believe that Sen. Robert Dole is in a
real horse race with his Democratic challenger,
Congressman William Roy.
As a freshman senator, Dole made a
political name for himself as a loyal defender
of Richard Nixon's policies. His reward was
the Republican national chairmanship.
But Dole's stepping stone to national
prominence has become a political millstone
and he has been only partially successful in

Roy admits the backlash of public opinion
from Watergate significantly aided his
; campaign, but he has nonetheless

"soft-pedaled" the issue.
Kansas Republicans are unhappy that Dole
took the chairmanship and preoccupied
himself with party concerns instead of his
constituents. Dole insists "it is the best thing
that ever happened happened in a long time
in the state of Kansas. We have been able to
open more doors properly as a result of being
the chairman."

Roy has been hammering away at this sore
spot. "I think Kansans deserve a senator who
will serve their state and their nation, our state
and our nation, rather than choosing to serve
his party," he has said repeatedly.
Dole, 51, has complained about President
Ford undercutting him. Republicans were
encouraged when Ford took over, but then
"along came the pardon of Nixon and
amnesty."
"I don't need any more help of that kind
before November," he said.
A witty, slashing campaigner in previous
elections, Dole has toned down his abrasive
technique and gone on the defensive. He says
Roy has misrepresented his voting record and
accuses Roy of mudslinging.
Mud
One of Dole's television spots shows a
poster of smiling Bob Dole as a hand slings a
glob of "Watergate" and "antifarm" mud at
the poster while a voice-over identifies the
slinger as Roy.
Roy insists that his campaign is concerned
with issues, not personalities.
To the Kansas farmers Roy says that Dole
voted against Kansas agriculture when he
opposed an appropriations bill including farm
program funds.
Dole says he was attempting to curb
government spending as part of the fight on
inflation. He takes pains to point out that he
will be the senior Republican on the Senate
Agriculture Committee if re-elected.
'Majority Member'
Roy says "Kansas needs a majority member
of the committee."
Roy, a lawyer and a physician who
specialized in obstetrics and gynecology, is a
strong proponent of health care legislation and
programs "for the less fortunate." He claims

Dole has voted against Medicare and social
security.
He's also in an interesting position in regard
to the abortion issue in the campaign as a
physician he has performed legal abortions.
Roy says he is personally against abortions but
thinks the law should be neutral on the
subject.
Dole is a strong advocate of a

constitutional amendment prohibiting
abortion.
No Amnesty
Dole was an opponent of Ford's amnesty
plan. He said he would have opposed amnesty
"as long as there are evaders who are living the
life of luxury in other countries and thumbing
their noses at America." Roy supported a
Ford-style conditional amnesty.
Roy, 48, is completing his second term in
the House. Republicans have been trying to
depict Roy as a liberal, left-wing congressman
and claim he would owe his election to
AFL-CIO President George Meany.
Political analysts and recent polls have
placed Roy and Dole neck and neck as
election day approaches. Dole has made up
some ground on Roy.
"It's a tight race and I guess I am a little bit
behind," said Dole, who has never lost in 10
races starting with his election to the state
House of Representatives 25 years ago.
Shift
A victory by Roy could signal a voter shift
away from the old Republican line and toward
a more independent affiliation, observers say.
Roy shares this view.
"Bob Dole is a symbol of a certain type of
politics, a type of politics that should
disappear from the face of the earth," Roy
said.
Whether the Kansas voters are indeed going
to condemn Dole's politics, and whether a
victory for Roy can be interpreted that way,
remains to be seen.
But the emerging Republican majority that
was forecast with Richard Nixon's landslide
re-election two years ago seems to resemble
more closely an emerging independent
majority that Democrats hope to woo into
their camp over the next 10 years.

This is the last of five articles examining
key Senate races across the country.


Robert Dole


William Roy
When a liberal Democrat runs against a
conservative incumbent Republican in Kansas,
the result has always been a foregone
conclusion. Until now.
In a state where Richard Nixon polled 61
percent of the vote in 1960 and Barry
Goldwater drew over 45 percent in 1964, it is
hard to believe that Sen. Robert Dole is in a
real horse race with his Democratic challenger,
Congressman William Roy.
As a freshman senator, Dole made a
political name for himself as a loyal defender
of Richard Nixon's policies. His reward was
the Republican national chairmanship.
But Dole's stepping stone to national
prominence has become a political millstone
and he has been only partially successful in
putting distance between himself and
Watergate.

( "I get asked once a night about Watergate
as if I directed the whole scenario," Dole
complains. Dole and the Republican National
Committee were cleared by the Senate
Watergate Committee of any involvement in
the illegal activities of the Committee for the
Re-Election of the President,
j While Roy denies he has made Watergate an
issue in the race, he did say "many people
think Sen. Dole, as Republican national
chairman, knew or should have known about
Watergate." But he adds "I have no reason to
believe Sen. Dole knew."
