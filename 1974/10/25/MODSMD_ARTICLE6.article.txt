Mervyn Dymally

For lieutenant governor, we endorse state Sen. Mervyn Dymally
(D-L.A.) over semi-incumbent John Harmer, who was appointed by
Gov. Ronald Reagan Oct. 4 to fill the term of convicted perjurer Ed
Reinecke.
Dymally has had a distinguished record of accomplishment in his
seven years in the state Senate. He supported every major piece of
social legislation to come out of the Senate. He authored the Early
Childhood Education Act and co-authored the state's new campaign
disclosure law.
Harmer, who until his appointment by Reagan was a state senator,
opposed such concepts as implementation of the Serrano decision to
provide equal education funding, low interest government housing
loans, reduction of marijuana penalties and bilingual education. He
favors the death penalty and has authored several unsuccessful bills
against pornography.
Dymally has consistently voted for social progress in California,
while his opponent's support for such measures has been almost
totally absent. We think Dymally will make a far more effective
lieutenant governor.

Jess Unruh

For the office of state treasurer, we endorse Democratic nominee
Jess Unruh over Republican John Kehoe.
For years, Unruh was one of the most imposing figures in state
government, first as speaker of the Assembly and then as the
Democratic gubernatorial nominee four years ago. Stories about "Big
Daddy" are numerous, and some approach legendary status: Unruh
literally locking recalcitrant legislators in chambers to force a vote,
Unruh stalking the halls of the legislature buttonholing support,
Unruh carrying his gubernatorial campaign directly to the front doors
of Reagan's moneyed backers.
But all too often overlooked is the fact that Unruh used his
colorful tactics to fight for the benefit of the people. For example,
one of the toughest consumer credit laws in the nation is the
California statute that bears his name. Despite his "Big Daddy"
nickname, the state legislature was notably free from scandal during
the time he was speaker, and he headed Sen. Robert Kennedy's 1968
presidential campaign in the state.
His opponent, Kehoe, is a Reagan aide best known for his
lackluster administration of the State Department of Consumer
Affairs. Californians would be doing themselves a favor by returning
Jess Unruh to Sacramento, where he can once again fight for their
interests.

March Fong

We endorse Assemblywoman March Fong (D-Oakland) for
secretary of state.
In her tenure in the state assembly, Fong has shown an ability to
fight for less glamorous, but nevertheless important issues. Beyond her
successful effort to prohibit pay toilets in public buildings, Fong has
continually been concerned with health care, education,
environmental protection, consumer affairs, prison reform, family
planning, tax reform and equal rights for women.
Fong has said she will enforce campaign disclosure laws toughly
and actively supports further campaign reform measures, including
spending limitations and public financing of elections.
Her opponent, Republican Brian Van Camp, opposes public
campaign financing and limitations of overall campaign spending.
Fong's record and positions show that she is the best candidate to
carry on the role of an active secretary of state.
