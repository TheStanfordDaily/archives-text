We invite you to experience it. Come see for your
self how Hewlett-Packard's exclusive ENTERtkey lets
you "speak" with total consistency to their scientific
pocket-sized calculators.
It's one reason their HP-45 is the most powerful
pre-programmed scientific pocket-sized calculator ever
built and their HP-35 is the runner-up. Here are three
more reasons.
1. The HP-45 is pre-programmed to handle 44
arithmetic, trigonometric and logarithmic functions and
data manipulations beyond (+, -, x, -O.The HP-35
handles 22.
2. The HP-45 stores constants in nine Addressable
Memory Registers and has a "Last X" Register for error
correction.The HP-35 has one Addressable Memory
Register.
3. Both display 10 digits in fixed-decimal or scien
tific notation and automatically position the decimal
point throughout a 200-decade range.
If you're looking for unprecedented calculating
power for your money, by all means see and test these
instruments. The HP-45 costs just $325; the HP-35 just
$225. Both are on display at our place. Come on in.
And bring a stubborn problem.
