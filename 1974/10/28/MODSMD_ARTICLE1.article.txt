# More Tests Needed For Nixon's Leg

LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -
Sophisticated tests will be performed
on former President Richard M. Nixon
this week to determine if new clots are
forming in his leg a condition that
would probably, require surgery, his
physician said yesterday.
Even if surgery on the
1 phlebitis-ridden leg is ruled out, Nixon
will require close medical supervision
for many months, a consulting doctor
said. This may prohibit Nixon from
testifying at the Watergate cover-up
trial.
Dr. John C. Lungren said that if
'surgery is not necessary on the deep
veinous system of Nixon's left leg,
which was said to be "99 and 44/100
percent clotted," he can probably
leave the hospital at the end of the
week.
Possible Surgery
' "We don't propose to do anything
further unless we have indications of
active clotting," Lungren said at a
news conference. "Then we would
probably go to surgery."
He said Nixon was now responding
to hospital treatment and was not in
"'any undue pain." He said Nixon is no
longer bleeding from the gums as a
side effect to his anticoagulation
treatment.
Nixon has been subpoenaed by
both the defense and prosecution in
the Watergate trial in Washington,
r D.C., of five v fbrmer political
associates.
Legal Implications
Although Lungren refused to
discuss the political or legal
consequences of Nixon's health, he
said, "Mr. Nixon at some point will be
, available for court proceedings.
"I cannot say when. Over the long
haul I'm sure he'll be available."
The Watergate special prosecutor's
office said it will have no comment on
the latest developments.
'Unquestionable Clots'
Dr. Wiley Barker, a consultant in
v the case, said the former president has
"unquestionable clots in several veins
of the left leg."
Nixon will have to undergo "close
medical supervision for a protracted
length of time, and by protracted
length of time I mean many months,"
'said Barker, of the UCLA medical
school.
One of the tests planned for Nixon
is a radioactive fibrinogen uptake test.
This involves extracting a quantity of
fibrinogen, the key blood component
which causes clotting, then "tagging"
"it with a radioactive material and
reinjecting it into the bloodstream.
Fibrinogen
By observing the activity of the
fibrinogen with radiation-sensing
instruments, the doctors will have a
better idea of whether new clots are
, forming.
Nixon aide Ronald Zeigler said in a
