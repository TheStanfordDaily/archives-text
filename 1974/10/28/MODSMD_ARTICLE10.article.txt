# Explicit Facts Crush Falsehoods
## 
### Jim Wascher 
During the past two weeks, several readers
have written in asking how Daily reporters
could "justify" publishing the "sordid
details" of the Perry murder and the Adams
abduction.

Frankly speaking, it was their job as
journalists to discover—and print—every
relevant, piece of information about those
crimes. Whether the Daily is covering a
murder or an ASSU Senate meeting, its
readers have the right to learn from the paper
precisely what happened.
But, one reader argues, "publishing such
details only serves to degrade the victim and
adds humiliation to the grief already suffered
by loved ones."
If journalists were to accept this as a
logical reason for withholding information,
the public never would have known about
the Watergate affair. After all. hadn't H.R.
Haideman, John Ehrlichman,
and—yes—Richard Nixon suffered enough
degradation after the first few stories
appeared about the scandal? And what of
their families and friends?
Question Of Discretion
Another letter pleaded for the Daily to
"spare the reader any description of exactly
what happened." That's fine just to say, but
if our reporters did decide to exercise this

sort of "discretion," how far should they
carry it?
Should they avoid publishing the name of
any crime victim or suspect, or any figure
involved in a scandal, in order to lessen their
humiliation? Who will write in to defend us
when we cross that fine line between
so-called discretion and covering up?
What it comes down to, then, is that a
certain number of our readers are afraid of
the truth. "Don't tell us anything that we
don't want to know," they seem to be
saying.
Perhaps these readers would have
preferred an incomplete, vague story about
the murder or the abduction. This would
have allowed people to spread malicious,
panic-mongering rumors about the crimes
without any refutation.
Danger Of Rumors
On the day after Judy Adams' abduction,
a well-meaning friend told me that Adams
had been kidnaped "right by the DU
house" -and Delta Upsilon is a lot closer to
all of us on campus than is the actual
location of the abduction.
If our reporter knew what had happened,
why should he have permitted even the
well-intentioned among us to fuel
unnecessarily students' paranoia and

suspicions?
Incendiary rumors—possibly quite
degrading to both the victims and their loved
ones -would have been the rule had the Daily
not published all of the information it had
obtained about both crimes.
Exposition Needed
In addition to helping scotch these rumors
before they even started, I believe that a full
exposition of the facts in these cases may
keep us from having to report on yet another
grisly episode.
If telling as much of the truth as we know
has made men and women on this .campus
just a little bit more cautious each night, then
I think the Daily's reporters have done an
admirable job.

"Surely there is a place for either
responsibility, sensibility or descretion in
journalism," one reader wrote last week. I
couldn't agree with him more.
By publishing the "sordid details" of the
Perry and Adams cases, the Daily reporters
met each of these criteria as tactfully as was
possible under difficult circumstances. For
this, they should be commended, rather than
attacked.

Perhaps these readers would have
preferred an incomplete, vague story about
the murder or the abduction. This would
have allowed people to spread malicious,
panic-mongering rumors about the crimes
without any refutation.
Danger Of Rumors
On the day after Judy Adams' abduction,
a well-meaning friend told me that Adams
had been kidnaped "right by the DU
house" -and Delta Upsilon is a lot closer to
all of us on campus than is the actual
location of the abduction.
If our reporter knew what had happened,
why should he have permitted even the
well-intentioned among us to fuel
unnecessarily students' paranoia and

suspicions?
Incendiary rumors—possibly quite
degrading to both the victims and their loved
ones -would have been the rule had the Daily
not published all of the information it had
obtained about both crimes.
Exposition Needed
In addition to helping scotch these rumors
before they even started, I believe that a full
exposition of the facts in these cases may
keep us from having to report on yet another
grisly episode.
If telling as much of the truth as we know
has made men and women on this .campus
just a little bit more cautious each night, then
I think the Daily's reporters have done an
admirable job.

"Surely there is a place for either
responsibility, sensibility or descretion in
journalism," one reader wrote last week. I
couldn't agree with him more.
By publishing the "sordid details" of the
Perry and Adams cases, the Daily reporters
met each of these criteria as tactfully as was
possible under difficult circumstances. For
this, they should be commended, rather than
attacked.

During the past two weeks, several readers
have written in asking how Daily reporters
could "justify" publishing the "sordid
details" of the Perry murder and the Adams
abduction.

Frankly speaking, it was their job as
journalists to discover—and print—every
relevant, piece of information about those
crimes. Whether the Daily is covering a
murder or an ASSU Senate meeting, its
readers have the right to learn from the paper
precisely what happened.
But, one reader argues, "publishing such
details only serves to degrade the victim and
adds humiliation to the grief already suffered
by loved ones."
If journalists were to accept this as a
logical reason for withholding information,
the public never would have known about
the Watergate affair. After all. hadn't H.R.
Haideman, John Ehrlichman,
and—yes—Richard Nixon suffered enough
degradation after the first few stories
appeared about the scandal? And what of
their families and friends?
Question Of Discretion
Another letter pleaded for the Daily to
"spare the reader any description of exactly
what happened." That's fine just to say, but
if our reporters did decide to exercise this

sort of "discretion," how far should they
carry it?
Should they avoid publishing the name of
any crime victim or suspect, or any figure
involved in a scandal, in order to lessen their
humiliation? Who will write in to defend us
when we cross that fine line between
so-called discretion and covering up?
What it comes down to, then, is that a
certain number of our readers are afraid of
the truth. "Don't tell us anything that we
don't want to know," they seem to be
saying.
