# McCloskey Upholds GOP Dissent
## 
### Lorry Shapiro 
The Oct. 23 Daily editorial
refusing to endorse a candidate in
the 12th Congressional District
race consists of little more than a
collection of untrue and
unsubstantiated claims.
The Daily alleges that since it
last endorsed Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr. for the
Republican primary in June, he
has moved in a conservative
direction.
The Daily holds up
McCloskey's vote against the
Equal Rights Amendment as
evidence, somehow forgetting that
this occurred in 1971. Also, the
editorial does not mention that
McCloskey was opposed only to
the provisions for debate of the
bill, not its substance, and that he
voted for the measure in its final
form.
Since its passage, he has
actively supported the efforts of
Common Cause to get the
Amendment ratified by the
needed two-thirds of the states.
Another indication of his
"conservatism,"' says the Daily, is
McCloskey's support. of Ford.
This is far from the truth.
McCloskey criticized the Nixon
pardon, calling it a "mistake"
because "it sets a dual standard of
justice."
McCloskey was referring to
another issue of which he has
been critical of Ford, amnesty for
Vietnam draft resisters. As a result
of the Agnew plea bargain and
Nixon pardon, McCloskey has
taken a more liberal, not
conservative stand. Once an
advocate of conditional amnesty,
he now favors allowing the
resisters to come home with no
strings attached.
Won't Endorse Ford
Furthermore, at the Stanford
debate on Oct. 17, McCloskey
refused to endorse- Ford for the
1976 Republican presidential
nomination. If the choice were
between former Atty. Gen. Elliot
Richardson and Ford, the
congressman told the audience, he
would support Richardson.

What is remarkable about
McCloskey's willingness to oppose
the President is that Ford was a
major factor in his closely fought
primary victory last spring. Ford's
endorsement of McCloskey on a
visit to the district during the
closing weeks of the campaign is
viewed by many observers as the
key to McCloskey's victory.
The Daily has thus fabricated
this myth of McCloskey growing
conservative and abandoning his
independence.

But what is particularly
distressing about this editorial is
the assertion that McCloskey's
"flashy liberal stands on issues of
the past do not replace a
vigorously liberal voting record."
Fundamentally Republican
There is no denying that
McCloskey is fundamentally a
Republican and frequently votes
as such. But to label his early
opposition to Vietnam and
equally early and unpopular
support for the impeachment of
Richard Nixon as "flashy liberal
views" reveals a total
misunderstanding of McCloskey's
record as a congressman.
In 1972 he entered the New
Hampshire Republican
presidential primary as a lone
voice of dissent towards the
Republicans' Vietnam policy. The
Party reacted bitterly to this act

of insurrection and his defeat
became a major party priority.
The only thing that saved him
from losing his own congressional
primary that year was that in a
three-man race the two other
contestants split the
anti-McCloskey vote.
Job On The Line
A little more than a year later,
McCloskey again put his job on
the line by becoming the first
congressman to call for Nixon's
impeachment. And he continued
talking about impeachment
throughout his 1974 primary
campaign, despite the fact that 70
percent of the Republicans in his
district were opposed to it.
Moreover. McCloskey has
consistently taken other stands
unpopular in most of his district,
opposing capital punishment,
favoring decriminalization of

marijuana, and supporting a
woman's right to have an
abortion.
The Daily talks of McCloskey
walking a "delicate balance" to
iceep "both liberal supporters and
conservative financiers happy." It
is common knowledge however
that he has never compromised his
ideals for anyone, not even for his
own re-election.
As the Daily noted in its strong
endorsements of . him during last
spring's primary campaign:
"McCloskey is a man of fiercely
demonstrated -integrity,
independence and courage. Those
are rare words in this sorry time;
they apply to McCloskey as to
few others in Congress."
The Daily has a very short
memory.
