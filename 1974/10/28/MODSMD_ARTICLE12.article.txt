# On Trustees And Elitism
## 
### Michael Korff 
During the last couple of weeks the Daily has
printed several articles by Robert Bacon concerning
various higher education propositions facing the
California voters in November. Most of Bacon's
recommendations concerning the various
propositions reflect a fear of "political"
interference in public post-secondary education in
California.
He therefore opposes Prop. 14 which would add
the President Pro Tempore of the State Senate to
the Board of Trustees of the California State
University and Colleges (SCUS), and he opposes
Prop. 16 which would transfer to the State
Legislature the authority—and responsibility—for
instituting tuition at the University of California
(UC).
Political interference is, of course, something
which all of us who have lived through the
controversies surrounding Clark Kerr, Eldridge
Cleaver, and Angela Davis—to name just a few—are
concerned about. But the bugaboo of political
interference has frightened some people into
fearing legislative responsibility for public
postsecondary education in this state.
It's a funny kind of an elitist position which
suggests that we should place public higher
education in the hands of a board exempt from
responsibility to an electorate. So long as this is a
democracy we should accept the theory that the
people speak through their representatives. I
remind Bacon that the very legislature whose
political interference he fears is controlled by
lawyers; apparently he has enough faith in the legal
profession that he has chosen to study at UC Davis'
Martin Luther King Hall of Law.
I think Bacon should take more time to consider
the origin of the various propositions (and the
numerous laws which already have been signed into
law). They are the result of extensive hearings and
deliberations by the Legislature's special Joint
Committee on Postsecondary Education headed by
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos.

Vasconcellos—also a lawyer—and his committee
have worked hard to broaden the base of
post-secondary education in this state, to insure
that it is more responsive to the needs of the
people, to maintain the very quality about which
Bacon is so concerned.

As for the four propositions facing us in
November which result from the Vasconcellos
Committee, I hope Bacon will reconsider his stands.
Prop. 3 would permit the new Post-secondary
Education Commission to appoint its top four
officers outside of normal civil service procedures.
Prop. 4—with which Bacon agrees—would
shorten UC Regent terms and insure that the Board
is more representative of the people.
Bacon fears Prop. 14 would add political
interference; instead it would help to make the
Board more responsive to the thinking of the
legislators and through them, the people.
Prop. 16 would give to the Legislature the power
to determine the level of tuition at UC. This is an
important responsibility. It is one which the
Legislature already has in the California community
colleges and the CSUC. Bacon stipulates that it is
likely that should this proposition pass the
Democratic-controlled legislature will likely reduce
the current student charges at UC, the only
segment of California public post secondary
education which currently has "tuition."
Although he favors the lowering of tuition,
Bacon is afraid that the legislature might yield to
public pressure and raise tuition at some future
date. In a representative democracy legislators are
indeed subject to a certain extent to public
opinion. Unless Bacon wishes to set up an academic
oligarchy where public higher education is removed
from the public which supports it, then perhaps it's
not so bad that the University become more
responsive to public opinion.
