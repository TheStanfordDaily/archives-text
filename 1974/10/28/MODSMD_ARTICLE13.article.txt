On Disqualifications
Editor:
Regarding Philip Feder's article
(Daily, Oct. 23), "Five
Disqualified in ASSU Election," I
first would like to congratulate
Feder for what, in my estimation,
is the finest reporting of an ASSU
Senate meeting in the past three
years.
However, in the course of the
article, a quotation was attributed
to me, the content of which was
that I "feared the Senate might
set a bad precedent if the
candidates were not disqualified."
This is unquestionably untrue.
In the context of the Senate
debate, I was responding to the
motion by a graduate senator to
table the disqualification of the
candidates in question. What I, in
fact, said was that I felt it would
be a "bad precedent" if the
Senate did table the
disqualifications and that it was
my opinion that the matter
should be dealt with that time
and place.
I believe the correction of this
inaccuracy to be important to the
candidates involved inasmuch as,
for the sake of impartiality, I have
consistently refused to personally
take a stand on the matter of
disqualification, a matter on
which I had no say.

Inefficient Police
Editor:
After reading your Oct.
15 report that a 5-foot-10
brunette man was seen in the
church on the night of the Perry
murder. I called the police to give
a full description of a similar man
who had followed me earlier that
Saturday night. The police
operator listened and assured me
that I would be called by an
investigator. When I wasn't
contacted by Thursday evening I
called again. I told the operator
that I felt that the incident was
significant and that I could
describe the man and the clothes
he wore (jeans and a red plaid
shirt). The operator told me that I
would be called but that there

were a lot of people to be
contacted and it would take a
while. You can imagine how upset
I was when I read that on Sunday
night a man closely fitting the
description I tried to report had
kidnaped a woman.
While it is true that when a
reward for information is
publicized the police are deluged
with telephone calls, I do believe
that someone should be
responsible to find out the general
nature of the callers' information.
Although I wouldn't jump to the
conclusion that the man who
followed me had anything to do
with either the murder or the
kidnaping, I certainly wish that I
had been able to give the police
my description before the latest
incident.
After reading of the
kidnaping I called the police
again and 1 finally did speak to
someone. As a woman who has to
work on campus late at night I
hope that this experience will
encourage the police to adopt a
more efficient reporting system.
Last weekend if the police patrols
had had a description of the man
who had followed me the
weekend before, who knows what
might have happened—or more to
the point—what might not have
happened.

Wrong Lyrics,-
Editor,
The information contained in
the photograph caption of Steve
Hefter's Oct. 23 article on Carol
Doda is incorrect. The first few
lines of "Oh Carol" are, "Oh
Carol, I am but a fool, darling I
love you, though you treat me
cruel, . . . "; not "... and I love
you darling,.. .". This song was
recorded and made popular by
Neil Sedaka. It was also written
by Sedaka in honor ofCaroleKing,
who at that time was Sedaka's
good friend. Though Paul Anka
has a definite place in the history
of rock and roll, he had nothing
to do with this song.
