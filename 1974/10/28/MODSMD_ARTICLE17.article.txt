### PAIGE CHERNO BETTY GOODWIN 
Stanford University is "an
immense precious resource" for
Palo Alto senior citizens that isn't
being tapped. Dr. Walter Bortz,
chairman of the city task force on
aging, said last Wednesday night
at the downtown Public Library.
Bortz's remark summarized the
feelings of tfcie 22-member task
force, empaneled Oct. 1 by the
Palo Alto City Council to study
the needs of the elderly and to
develop possible ways of meeting
those needs.
Willard Walker, speaking for
the subcommittee on housing and
transportation, cited low-cost
housing as a major need of the
elderly. Scarcity of land in Palo
Alto ,has pushed the cost of
housing up.
"Stanford's got the land,"
Walker said. "How are you going
to get it?"
Task force member Alberta
Baumberger said the first time the
University ever made any "real
effort" along the lines of housing
the, elderly was with its own
emeritus housing program.
In addition to low-cost
housing, inexpensive, quality
health care is not readily available
to old people, she added.
Bjll Greene, representing the
subcommittee on health and
home services, said preventative
medicine both its expense and
availability - is a problem. Greene
said the high cost of medicines
and physicians fees are a
"continuing drain on the

resources of our older citizens.
Palo Alto lacks sufficient
nutrition, mental health and
diagnostic services, he added.
"There is an unfortunate
separation between Stanford
Hospital and Palo Alto," he said,
and they seem to be "two camps
and they're not pulling together."
On other matters, Walker said,
"transportation is very
important" for Palo Alto's 8800
elder citizens, 45 percent of
whom "don't have wheels."
Summarizing the report on
pleasure, leisure, education,
employment and participation,
the subcommittee reported that
there is no "crucial, immediate"
need for action except in the area
of employment.
Employment opportunities are
cut short for the elderly because
of compulsory retirement laws,
one member said, while plenty of
leisure time opportunities do
exist.
Task force member Jack
Hauser, also a member of the Palo
Alto Senior Coordinating Council,
disagreed. He said there is an
immediate need to reach those
who do not or cannot take
advantage of recreational and
educational opportunities.
Hauser said 13 percent live
alone and "want someone to be
interested in them. They are not
the people who go to your senior
centers."
