# UCLA Sinks Poloists, 6-4

Stanford's bid for an NCAA
water polo berth took a turn for
the worse Friday as the UCLA
Bruins edged the Cards 6-4 in a
violent clash between the Pacific
Eight rivals.
The loss, which dropped
Stanford's league record to 1-3,
may well have been the final blow
to the Cards' hopes. A selection as
a "wild card" team is a possibility,
according to coach Art Lambert,
only if Stanford beats "the San
Jose State's, the USC's, and the
UOP's" remaining on the
schedule.
The Cards got off to a dismal
start on Saturday, spotting the
rugged Bruins four goals before
sophomore Tom Purcell fired one
in midway through the second
quarter. The Cards pulled to
within two 30 seconds later as
John Paul Roberts slammed in a
sweep shot, and the half ended
4-2.
The two teams traded second
half goals as Dean Anderson and
Rick Johannsen tallies twice
moved the Cards to within one
goal of UCLA, but the Bruins'
stingy defense fended off the
scrappy Cards.
The season-long problem of
inconsistency again plagued the
Cardinals, who demonstrated
spurts of intense driving and
impenetrable defense only to be
hurt by momentary lapses of
incompetence.
Lambert cited a "lack of
confidence" as part of the team's
problem, and pointed out the
relative "inexperience" of his
young team. "We've only got two

seniors, and naturally some of the
younger players are a little
nervous."
UCLA, long-time NCAA water
polo powerhouse under the
leadership of coach Bob Horn, are
definite contenders in the race to
knock off defending champ Cal.
According to Horn, his team
has been bolstered this year by
the acquisition of former Olympic
swim coach George Haines. "His
presence enables me to
concentrate fully on water polo,
rather than dividing my time
between water polo and
swimming as in the past."

The idea of associate coaches,
who assist each other, is working
well at Stanford, too, where
Lambert and swim coach Jim
Gaughran function in a similar
manner.
The Cards got back on the
winning track Saturday by routing
an outclassed Pomona team, 11-2.
Junior Craig Van Zandt led the
way with five goals, while
Johannsen and Anderson each
scored three times. The Cards are
in action again Thursday as the
Brazilian National team visits
DeGuerre Pool in a 3:30
encounter.
