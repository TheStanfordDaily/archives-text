# Cranston Defends Role In Fight Against Inflationary Spending
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)
defended himself against a
charge leveled by his Republican
opponent that "sending Cranston to
Washington to fight inflation is like
hiring an arsonist to fight fires."
Speaking at a press conference
preceding a $5O-a-plate fund-raising
at Rickey's Hyatt House,
Cranston said that "the same charge is
being made against about seven
incumbent Democrats across the
country. It's not a valid charge against
me or against any of the other
senators."
u Cranston, seeking re-election
against state Sen. H.L. Richardson
(R-Arcadia), emphasized that he has
continually voted to cut military
and foreign aid to dictators, as well as
voting against a long list of other
expenditures.
"All of this adds up to over $lOO
I have fought to save," he said,
"but the figures they [the
Republicans] have used never take
into account what I've done to cut
spending."
Against Surtax
Cranston said he supports many of
Ford's inflation-fighting
proposals, but that he "totally
disagrees with the five percent surtax
on incomes. I advocate instead closing
loopholes, staying with the oil
depletion allowance and making
effective the minimum income tax."
W He also favors "turning loose the
farmers" by halting payments not to
produce, and cutting down on energy
waste.

Later, in a speech to about 500
supporters, Cranston spoke of a "rising
need for fairness and equity for those
suffering most from inflation.
"There is a rising state of urgency
in the land," he said. "Certainly the
task we face calls for an unusual
degree of cooperation and conciliation
between the President, the Congress
and the people."
'Might Be Close'
Cranston prefaced his remarks by
saying that despite predictions that the
outcome of his race against
Richardson is a foregone conclusion,
"I never take for granted what people
will or will not do. I'm not yet
convinced that this won't be a close
raceâ€” I'm working as hard as if this

was my first election."
Cranston evoked the most response
from his supporters when he called
Richard Nixon "perhaps the greatest
President that ever had our country,"
adding that Gerald Ford, through his
"unpardonable pardon, missed the
whole point of what drove Nixon out
of office that no person is above the
law."
The least the American people are
entitled to, Cranston insisted, "is to
know what Richard Nixon was
pardoned for."
Rockefeller Questions
At the press conference, Cranston
said that campaign gifts by Vice
President-designate Nelson Rockefeller
"raise serious questions about his
judgment." Cranston promised to
"consult as many people as possible
particularly Republicans in California
before making a decision on how to
vote."
He said he would "vote for him
[Rockefeller| today, but I don't know
how I'll finally vote until after further
hearings and committee reports."
Despite President Ford's recent
warnings about the dangers of a
"legislative dictatorship" in Congress,
Cranston anticipates "a strong
Democratic gain" in the Nov. 5
election.
"My favorite response to questions
about congressional elections,"
Cranston said, "is to quote a
Republican friend of mine. 'l'm not
worried I sleep like a baby every
night,' he says. I sleep for an hour and
then wake up in the middle of the
night and cry.' "
