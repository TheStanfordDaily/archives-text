# Booters Fall Again

First it was "It's not whether
you win or lose but how you play
the game." Then came "Winning
isn't everything, it's the only
thing."
For the Stanford soccer team
which plays the game not badly,
winning occasionally would be
nice. The Cardinals were blanked
Friday by Chico State, 2-0.
"For 76 minutes we played
really well," head coach Fred
Priddle commented, "then they
just sort of slipped one by us and
we couldn't recover."
Chico State is ranked third in
the West, and 16th in the country.
Stanford, now 2-6-1 in league
play, is no longer regionally
ranked.
The scoring at Chico State
began after Stanford goalie Bruce
Mosbacher tipped away a direct

free penalty kick. Chico State
came right back and scored on a
"nice shot," according to Priddle,
and then with two minutes
remaining pushed in a loose ball in
front of the goal.
"Our shots were hard enough,"
Priddle said, "but they hit the
posts or their goalie was in
position to handle them. It was a
good hard game,... the breaks
just didn't go our way."
Priddle said that the Cardinals
concentrated defensively on two
of Chico State's players: Matt
Sullivan, a member of the U.S.
Olympic soccer team, and D.J.
Harding.
Phil Wright "held D.J. very
well," Priddle explained, "but
toward the end of the game, when
we were down by a goal, I moved
Phil up to the offense to try and
score, and that weakened our
defense."
Harding scored Chico State's
second goal.
Priddle mentioned that Charlie
Hall "showed up very well," and
also commended Mosbacher and
Mac Taylor for their play in
Friday's game.
The JV team also lost Friday,
to the Chico State JV, 7-4, but
the freshman team won on
Saturday, 3-2 over Mission High.
Ted Robinson scored two goals
for the frosh, upping his season
total to five.
