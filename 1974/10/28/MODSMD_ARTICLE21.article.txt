## UCLA, Cal Injure Their Hopes 
### CHRIS BAKER 
BERKELEY- UCLA may have burst any Pacific
Eight title hopes California entertained Saturday
with a 28-3 win, but the Bruins'hopes for aPasadena
visit were seriously diminished.
The Bruins lost quarterback John Sciarra for the
rest of the seasqn, early in the second quarter,
when Bear defensive tackle Dave Frey broke
Sciarra's ankle.
But before he left, Sciarra did enough damage to
beat Cal, completing bombs of 69 and 40 yards to
split end Norm Andersen.
But disaster struck the "Bruins in the second
quarter when Sciarra was injured. Reserve
sophomore quarterback Jeff Dankworth took over
but he couldn't immediately muster any offensive
spark.
But the Bruin defense, plagued by injuries all
season, responded to the challenge. Displaying its
own version of the "rubber band" defense, UCLA
limited the Bears to just three points in three Cal
drives inside their 10-yard marker.
Bart Sacked
Bartkowski put on a prolific passing show,
completing 26 out of 44 for 300 yards. But his
rushing totals told the story. Bart was sacked eight
times, losing 64 yards.
Five of these sacks came in the fourth quarter,
when down 21-3 just about everybody in Memorial
Stadium knew what he was going to do, including
the UCLA linebackers.
UCLA linebacker Mike Martinez, named the
game's most valuable player for his two sacks among
seven tackles, said "Cal didn't use any special
technique, it was just basically a street fight."
Although Dankworth directed two touchdown
drives in the second half, he hit none of the three
passes he threw to receivers who were in the clear.
Yet UCLA coach Dick Vermeil and the rest of
his teammates were high on him. Vermeil presented
him with the game ball, which normally would have
gone to Andersen as the game's most valuable
offensive player. "Dankworth did one hell of a job
out there," said Vermeil. "The kids really respect

him."
But Dankworth, realizing his tenuous position,
was modest in accepting the accolades. "All I had
to do was hand it to our backs and they did the
rest. Our 'corporation' (offensive line) did a great
job," Dankworth said.
Sciarra had a lot of praise for his replacement,
"We all have confidence in Jeff [Dankworth]. I'm
not down. How can I be down when we're going to
Pasadena. I'll be back for that one," Schiarra said.
Cal coach Mike White, who worked for three
years to get his Bears a position in the national
rankings, was stunned after the loss. After emerging
from a five minute closed locker room session with
his team, White appeared shaken.
"What can I say? We took a beating in all
departments. It's as simple as that," said White.
"You know this was a key game for us. We were up
against a team that is obviously in contention for a
conference championship— a win against them
would have done a lot for us. I guess this is where
maturity comes in. I figured we were mature
enough for the challenge. I suppose we weren't."
Found QB
While UCLA lost a quarterback, USC found one
in Pat Haden. The Trojans spotted Oregon State 10
points in the first quarter and Beavers were
thinking upset.
But Haden finally lived up to John McKay's
pre-season praise as he shook a five-game slump,
passing for two touchdowns in USC's 31-10 win.
Haden completed eight out of 16 passes for 101
yards.
Anthony Davis also helped his Heisman Trophy
chances, rushing for 143 yards in 26 carries for two
touchdowns, becoming the biggest touchdown
maker in conference history.
In Seattle, Washington decimated the Oregon
Ducks with an Ohio State-like 66-0 win. It was
Washington's first Pac-8 victory since the 1972
season. Last year the Ducks drubbed the hapless
Huskies 58-0. The Husky defense limited Oregon to
just two first downs and didn't allow the Ducks
past midfield until the fourth quarter.

THE OLD AND THE NEW—UCLA quarterback John Sciarra (15)
pitches out just moments before he was injured in Saturday's 28-3 win
over California. With Sciarra out for the year, running back Wendell
Tyler (22) may become UCLA's main offensive threat for the rest of
the year.
