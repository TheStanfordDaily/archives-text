# Cards Second In Golf Tourney
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The women's golf team lost its
footing early Friday in the second
round of the 10th annual
Stanford Women's Invitational
Golf Tournament, but managed to
hold on to second place in the
team competition.
Stanford's Pam Palmieri and
Pat Cornett shot a combined total

of 332 for the tournament's two
rounds. The score put them six
shots behind the winners, Julie
Stanger and Robin Walton from
Arizona State.
Going into Friday's round,
Arizona State led the Stanford
team by two shots.
"I three-putted the fourth
hole, and that's what really killed
me," Palmieri said. After that, she
spent most of the second round
trying to catch up, but to no avail.
Palmieri, who was tied for the
lead with an 80 after the first
round, shot a disappointing 85.
The score moved her to third in
the individual competition.
Teammate Cornett, who shot 85
and 82, finished fifth.
In the individual play, it was
Barbara Barrow's lucky day.
Combining her long and straight
tee shots with accurate putting,
Barrow, from San Diego State,
finished the second round with a
solid 73. She won the tournament

with a two-round total of 158.
Under the patchy blue skies, it
was not unusual to see a dump
truck dumping sand in the traps
around the greens.
Although the Stanford course
has an abundant supply of traps,
most of them were listed as
"under repair."
If a ball fell into a trap the
player was allowed to pick it up
and drop it on grass nearby.
Stanford Coach Carroll Diaz
said this should have helped the
players shoot in the 70s. "That
was the theory, since they drop
the ball out of almost every trap,"
she said.
However, only . two players
managed to break 80.
