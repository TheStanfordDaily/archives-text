# Hockey Team Crushes Davis
## 
### CHARLIE WHEELER 
Saturday belonged to the
Stanford field hockey team.
Combining excellent defense
with powerful offense, the Cards
demolished the visitors from
UC-Davis 6-0.
The game was characterized by
the sparkling play of many
Stanford players. But it was the
cohesive nature of their play that
was particularly impressive.
Earlier in the week, the
Stanford defense had been
disorganized by the new "link"
offense employed by Chico State.
But on Saturday the Cards
repeatedly stopped this same
offense when it was thrown at
them by Davis.
The Stanford women were
even stronger on the attack. The
front line had previously been
unsettled by the loss of freshman
Sukie Jackson for the season with
a knee injury. Against Davis,

however, the individuals finally
meshed as a unit.
Onnie Killefer pulled the hat
trick, scoring both of Stanford's
first half goals and adding another
midway through the final period.
Ann Walker tallied her second and
third goals of the season, and at
the end of the game Cappy
Coleman took a perfect pass from
Kathv Levinson and hammered in
her first goal of the year.
The Stanford junior varsity
squad recorded its third straight
shutout as it downed the Davis JV
team 2-0.
Connie Butler scored her
fourth goal of the season and
Cheryl Johnston her fifth of the
year for the only scores in the
game.
The JV squad will take on the
Cal varsity (the Bears only field
one team) in the Little Big Game
at 3 p.m. tomorrow outside Roble
Gym. The varsity plays next at
Cal State-Humboldt Saturday.
