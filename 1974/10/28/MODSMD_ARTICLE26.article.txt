# Cards Avoid Collapse, Edge WSU
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
PULLMAN, Wash.—During the
fourth quarter of Saturday's
20-18 win over Washington State,
the minds of Cardinal fans
vacillated between ugly memories
and an all-too-familiar present.
It was a crisp, sunny afternoon
at Pullman, and Stanford, making
crunching tackles and blocks, was
breezing to what would be a
satisfying (if a bit drab) 20-6
victory.
With 11:04 to play, WSU put
in its third-string quarterback,
Wally Bennett. (Who? Jim
Sweeney sure must be desperate.)
Some running plays gain a few
first downs. (Who cares. We're
going to win.) Then Bennett hits a
couple 20-yarders and runs for a
touchdown.
It was a warm, hazy afternoon
at Stanford Stadium, and the
Cards, after a rough start, were
about to beat San Jose State
21-14. Then, suddenly, the
defense just couldn't stop the
out manned Spartans.

The try for a two-point
conversion, however, is no good.
Forrie Martin bats down Bennett's
pass, and it's still 20-12.
Stanford gets the ball back.
After one first down, the offense
stalls. On a third-and-six, Mike
Cordova fades back, possibly slips
and throws a pass which is
blocked.
It was a quiet night in Los
Angeles, and all Cordova had to
do was stay on his feel to get a
first down to beat UCLA. He
slipped, and things went downhill
from there.
Tom Lynn, who has been
booting high kicks under pressure
ail day, comes in to punt. Yet
Stanford Sports Information
Director Gary Cavalli correctly
predicts, "It's going to be
blocked."
Scott Mullinex leads a horde of
Cougars in on Lynn. Mullinex
blocks the punt, and the ball
careens 25 yards high and back
after hitting the astroturf behind
Lynn. Ozell Bledsoe grabs it in the

endzone for a touchdown.
It was a grey, dull day at
Stanford against Penn Stale and a
cold day at Ann Arbor last year,
when a blocked punt and a
fumbled punt snap turned the tide
against the Cards.
WSU now must try for two
points to tie. Bennett rolls to his
right, but somehow, Drew Palin
breaks in on him. Bennett tries to
pitch, but-fumbles and when next
seen, the football is safely in Jeff
Siemens' grasp. So it's still
Stanford 20, WSU 18.
Ted Pappas snares the ensuing
on-side kick and Stanford takes
over again. And does nothing
again. Eric Test punts into the
endzone.
And now, the worst
hallucination of all. It was a
smoggy day in Los Angeles last
year, and all of the offense had to
do was get one first down and
Stanford would have upset (JSC.
It couldn't. After a punt, USC
drove and drove and drove and
Chris Limahelu came in and this
fan turned and walked away
without watching the field goal
that beat Stanford 27-26.
Luckily, WSU, compared to
USC, was nothing more than a
buffoon. Bennett took the ball
with 1:17 to play and fumbled.
Gordy Riegel recovered the
Cougars' fifth lost fumble of the
day, and it was over.
Stanford hadn't quite choked.
In the locker room, coach Jack
Christiansen looked exhausted. He
managed to joke, "No football
coach can have what Nixon has.
My heart was beating so fast that
if I had any clots, they v ould
have gone right through my heart
with stopping."
Riegel, after yet another game
where he leveled some of the
hardest shots this side of 15-yard
penalties, first complimented the
defensive line of Palin, Pat
Donovan and Roger Still well,
which played as a well-practiced
trio.
Complacency
Then he talked about that long
WSU drive. "I guess we got
complacent," Riegel said. "We
thought we had it won.
Complacent . . . that's a dirty
word at Stanford."
It's an especially revolting
word because. considering.
Stanford's history, it's likely any
little complacency during practice
or game will turn out to ruin the
Cards' chances for a Rose Bowl.
Complacency didn't quite do
so Saturday, only because of big

plays by nearly every defensive
starter and because the Cards had
accumulated that
not-so-comfortable 20-6 lead.
The trip to the Palouse began
in grand style. The team saw
King of Hearts at the Cordova
Theatre Friday night and Cordova
put on his own show for awhile,
hitting Brad Williams twice for an
early touchdown.
Close Calls
During the first half, the
Cougars came close to
touchdowns three times, only to
lose them because of bad breaks
and a hard-hitting Card defense.
First, number one Cougar QB
John Hopkins pitched to Duke
Fergerson, who threw a good
pass into the endzone way behind
the Stanford secondary— but the
pass was dropped.
On another first quarter series,
WSU was at the Card eight, and
Hopkins completed a pass to the
two. .It could have been a
touchdown throw, but Paul
Skrabo made a jarring tackle. The
Cougars went for a TD on
fourth down from the two, but
Geb Church stopped Hopkins cold.
Early in the second quarter
WSU actually scored a field goal,
but elected not to take it because
of a penalty against the Cards. On
first and goal, Hopkins fumbled at
the one-yard-line, and Doc
Blanchard got it.
WSU did get two field goals from
Joe Danelo, including a school
record kick of 55 yards, but these
were offset by boots of 47 and 24
yards by Mike Langford.
Stanford mounted a iong,
effective drive early in the fourth
quarter, utilizing a great running
game not seen this year. Test
punctuated the drive when he
found a gaping hole in the Cougar
pass defense, told Cordova about
it and waited all alone for the
12-yard touchdown pass.
Scott Laidlaw played a great
game, gaining 83 yards in 20
carries. Laidlaw was speared in the
ribs on the first play from
scrimmage, and after that, often
had to leave the field to catch his
breath. Joe Baumgaertner also did
well, gaining 18 yards in four
rushes and catching four passes
for 41 yards.

Both Laidlaw and Cordova
praised good one-on-one blocking,
by both the line and the blocking
back, for the success of the
rushing attack.

buffoon. Bennett took the ball
with 1:17 to play and fumbled.
Gordy Riegel recovered the
Cougars' fifth lost fumble of the
day, and it was over.
Stanford hadn't quite choked.
In the locker room, coach Jack
Christiansen looked exhausted. He
managed to joke, "No football
coach can have what Nixon has.
My heart was beating so fast that
if I had any clots, they v ould
have gone right through my heart
with stopping."
Riegel, after yet another game
where he leveled some of the
hardest shots this side of 15-yard
penalties, first complimented the
defensive line of Palin, Pat
Donovan and Roger Still well,
which played as a well-practiced
trio.
Complacency
Then he talked about that long
WSU drive. "I guess we got
complacent," Riegel said. "We
thought we had it won.
Complacent . . . that's a dirty
word at Stanford."
It's an especially revolting
word because. considering.
Stanford's history, it's likely any
little complacency during practice
or game will turn out to ruin the
Cards' chances for a Rose Bowl.
Complacency didn't quite do
so Saturday, only because of big

plays by nearly every defensive
starter and because the Cards had
accumulated that
not-so-comfortable 20-6 lead.
The trip to the Palouse began
in grand style. The team saw
King of Hearts at the Cordova
Theatre Friday night and Cordova
put on his own show for awhile,
hitting Brad Williams twice for an
early touchdown.
Close Calls
During the first half, the
Cougars came close to
touchdowns three times, only to
lose them because of bad breaks
and a hard-hitting Card defense.
First, number one Cougar QB
John Hopkins pitched to Duke
Fergerson, who threw a good
pass into the endzone way behind
the Stanford secondary— but the
pass was dropped.
On another first quarter series,
WSU was at the Card eight, and
Hopkins completed a pass to the
two. .It could have been a
touchdown throw, but Paul
Skrabo made a jarring tackle. The
Cougars went for a TD on
fourth down from the two, but
Geb Church stopped Hopkins cold.
Early in the second quarter
WSU actually scored a field goal,
but elected not to take it because
of a penalty against the Cards. On
first and goal, Hopkins fumbled at
the one-yard-line, and Doc
Blanchard got it.
WSU did get two field goals from
Joe Danelo, including a school
record kick of 55 yards, but these
were offset by boots of 47 and 24
yards by Mike Langford.
Stanford mounted a iong,
effective drive early in the fourth
quarter, utilizing a great running
game not seen this year. Test
punctuated the drive when he
found a gaping hole in the Cougar
pass defense, told Cordova about
it and waited all alone for the
12-yard touchdown pass.
Scott Laidlaw played a great
game, gaining 83 yards in 20
carries. Laidlaw was speared in the
ribs on the first play from
scrimmage, and after that, often
had to leave the field to catch his
breath. Joe Baumgaertner also did
well, gaining 18 yards in four
rushes and catching four passes
for 41 yards.

Both Laidlaw and Cordova
praised good one-on-one blocking,
by both the line and the blocking
back, for the success of the
rushing attack.

of the game, sustaining a knee

PULLMAN, Wash.—During the
fourth quarter of Saturday's
20-18 win over Washington State,
the minds of Cardinal fans
vacillated between ugly memories
and an all-too-familiar present.
It was a crisp, sunny afternoon
at Pullman, and Stanford, making
crunching tackles and blocks, was
breezing to what would be a
satisfying (if a bit drab) 20-6
victory.
With 11:04 to play, WSU put
in its third-string quarterback,
Wally Bennett. (Who? Jim
Sweeney sure must be desperate.)
Some running plays gain a few
first downs. (Who cares. We're
going to win.) Then Bennett hits a
couple 20-yarders and runs for a
touchdown.
It was a warm, hazy afternoon
at Stanford Stadium, and the
Cards, after a rough start, were
about to beat San Jose State
21-14. Then, suddenly, the
defense just couldn't stop the
out manned Spartans.

The try for a two-point
conversion, however, is no good.
Forrie Martin bats down Bennett's
pass, and it's still 20-12.
Stanford gets the ball back.
After one first down, the offense
stalls. On a third-and-six, Mike
Cordova fades back, possibly slips
and throws a pass which is
blocked.
It was a quiet night in Los
Angeles, and all Cordova had to
do was stay on his feel to get a
first down to beat UCLA. He
slipped, and things went downhill
from there.
Tom Lynn, who has been
booting high kicks under pressure
ail day, comes in to punt. Yet
Stanford Sports Information
Director Gary Cavalli correctly
predicts, "It's going to be
blocked."
Scott Mullinex leads a horde of
Cougars in on Lynn. Mullinex
blocks the punt, and the ball
careens 25 yards high and back
after hitting the astroturf behind
Lynn. Ozell Bledsoe grabs it in the

endzone for a touchdown.
It was a grey, dull day at
Stanford against Penn Stale and a
cold day at Ann Arbor last year,
when a blocked punt and a
fumbled punt snap turned the tide
against the Cards.
WSU now must try for two
points to tie. Bennett rolls to his
right, but somehow, Drew Palin
breaks in on him. Bennett tries to
pitch, but-fumbles and when next
seen, the football is safely in Jeff
Siemens' grasp. So it's still
Stanford 20, WSU 18.
Ted Pappas snares the ensuing
on-side kick and Stanford takes
over again. And does nothing
again. Eric Test punts into the
endzone.
And now, the worst
hallucination of all. It was a
smoggy day in Los Angeles last
year, and all of the offense had to
do was get one first down and
Stanford would have upset (JSC.
It couldn't. After a punt, USC
drove and drove and drove and
Chris Limahelu came in and this
fan turned and walked away
without watching the field goal
that beat Stanford 27-26.
Luckily, WSU, compared to
USC, was nothing more than a

with 1:17 to play and fumbled.

well, gaining 18 yards in four
rushes and catching four passes
for 41 yards.

by both the line and the blocking
back, for the success of the

PULLMAN, Wash.—During the
fourth quarter of Saturday's
20-18 win over Washington State,
the minds of Cardinal fans
vacillated between ugly memories
and an all-too-familiar present.
It was a crisp, sunny afternoon
at Pullman, and Stanford, making
crunching tackles and blocks, was
breezing to what would be a
satisfying (if a bit drab) 20-6
victory.
With 11:04 to play, WSU put
in its third-string quarterback,
Wally Bennett. (Who? Jim
Sweeney sure must be desperate.)
Some running plays gain a few
first downs. (Who cares. We're
going to win.) Then Bennett hits a
couple 20-yarders and runs for a
touchdown.
It was a warm, hazy afternoon
at Stanford Stadium, and the
Cards, after a rough start, were
about to beat San Jose State
21-14. Then, suddenly, the
defense just couldn't stop the
out manned Spartans.

The try for a two-point
conversion, however, is no good.
Forrie Martin bats down Bennett's
pass, and it's still 20-12.
Stanford gets the ball back.
After one first down, the offense
stalls. On a third-and-six, Mike
Cordova fades back, possibly slips
and throws a pass which is
blocked.
It was a quiet night in Los
Angeles, and all Cordova had to
do was stay on his feel to get a
first down to beat UCLA. He
slipped, and things went downhill
from there.
Tom Lynn, who has been
booting high kicks under pressure
ail day, comes in to punt. Yet
Stanford Sports Information
Director Gary Cavalli correctly
predicts, "It's going to be
blocked."
Scott Mullinex leads a horde of
Cougars in on Lynn. Mullinex
blocks the punt, and the ball
careens 25 yards high and back
after hitting the astroturf behind
Lynn. Ozell Bledsoe grabs it in the

endzone for a touchdown.
It was a grey, dull day at
Stanford against Penn Stale and a
cold day at Ann Arbor last year,
when a blocked punt and a
fumbled punt snap turned the tide
against the Cards.
WSU now must try for two
points to tie. Bennett rolls to his
right, but somehow, Drew Palin
breaks in on him. Bennett tries to
pitch, but-fumbles and when next
seen, the football is safely in Jeff
Siemens' grasp. So it's still
Stanford 20, WSU 18.
Ted Pappas snares the ensuing
on-side kick and Stanford takes
over again. And does nothing
again. Eric Test punts into the
endzone.
And now, the worst
hallucination of all. It was a
smoggy day in Los Angeles last
year, and all of the offense had to
do was get one first down and
Stanford would have upset (JSC.
It couldn't. After a punt, USC
drove and drove and drove and
Chris Limahelu came in and this
fan turned and walked away
without watching the field goal
that beat Stanford 27-26.
Luckily, WSU, compared to
USC, was nothing more than a
buffoon. Bennett took the ball
with 1:17 to play and fumbled.
Gordy Riegel recovered the
Cougars' fifth lost fumble of the
day, and it was over.
Stanford hadn't quite choked.
In the locker room, coach Jack
Christiansen looked exhausted. He
managed to joke, "No football
coach can have what Nixon has.
My heart was beating so fast that
if I had any clots, they v ould
have gone right through my heart
with stopping."
Riegel, after yet another game
where he leveled some of the
hardest shots this side of 15-yard
penalties, first complimented the
defensive line of Palin, Pat
Donovan and Roger Still well,
which played as a well-practiced
trio.
Complacency
Then he talked about that long
WSU drive. "I guess we got
complacent," Riegel said. "We
thought we had it won.
Complacent . . . that's a dirty
word at Stanford."
It's an especially revolting
word because. considering.
Stanford's history, it's likely any
little complacency during practice
or game will turn out to ruin the
Cards' chances for a Rose Bowl.
Complacency didn't quite do
so Saturday, only because of big

plays by nearly every defensive
starter and because the Cards had
accumulated that
not-so-comfortable 20-6 lead.
The trip to the Palouse began
in grand style. The team saw
King of Hearts at the Cordova
Theatre Friday night and Cordova
put on his own show for awhile,
hitting Brad Williams twice for an
early touchdown.
Close Calls
During the first half, the
Cougars came close to
touchdowns three times, only to
lose them because of bad breaks
and a hard-hitting Card defense.
First, number one Cougar QB
John Hopkins pitched to Duke
Fergerson, who threw a good
pass into the endzone way behind
the Stanford secondary— but the
pass was dropped.
On another first quarter series,
WSU was at the Card eight, and
Hopkins completed a pass to the
two. .It could have been a
touchdown throw, but Paul
Skrabo made a jarring tackle. The
Cougars went for a TD on
fourth down from the two, but
Geb Church stopped Hopkins cold.
Early in the second quarter
WSU actually scored a field goal,
but elected not to take it because
of a penalty against the Cards. On
first and goal, Hopkins fumbled at
the one-yard-line, and Doc
Blanchard got it.
WSU did get two field goals from
Joe Danelo, including a school
record kick of 55 yards, but these
were offset by boots of 47 and 24
yards by Mike Langford.
Stanford mounted a iong,
effective drive early in the fourth
quarter, utilizing a great running
game not seen this year. Test
punctuated the drive when he
found a gaping hole in the Cougar
pass defense, told Cordova about
it and waited all alone for the
12-yard touchdown pass.
Scott Laidlaw played a great
game, gaining 83 yards in 20
carries. Laidlaw was speared in the
ribs on the first play from
scrimmage, and after that, often
had to leave the field to catch his
breath. Joe Baumgaertner also did
well, gaining 18 yards in four
rushes and catching four passes
for 41 yards.

Both Laidlaw and Cordova

on-side kick and Stanford takes
over again. And does nothing
again. Eric Test punts into the
endzone.
And now, the worst
hallucination of all. It was a
smoggy day in Los Angeles last
year, and all of the offense had to
do was get one first down and
Stanford would have upset (JSC.
It couldn't. After a punt, USC
drove and drove and drove and
Chris Limahelu came in and this
fan turned and walked away
without watching the field goal
that beat Stanford 27-26.
Luckily, WSU, compared to
USC, was nothing more than a
buffoon. Bennett took the ball
with 1:17 to play and fumbled.
Gordy Riegel recovered the
Cougars' fifth lost fumble of the
day, and it was over.
Stanford hadn't quite choked.
In the locker room, coach Jack
Christiansen looked exhausted. He
managed to joke, "No football
coach can have what Nixon has.
My heart was beating so fast that
if I had any clots, they v ould
have gone right through my heart
with stopping."
Riegel, after yet another game
where he leveled some of the
hardest shots this side of 15-yard
penalties, first complimented the
defensive line of Palin, Pat
Donovan and Roger Still well,
which played as a well-practiced
trio.
Complacency
Then he talked about that long
WSU drive. "I guess we got
complacent," Riegel said. "We
thought we had it won.
Complacent . . . that's a dirty
word at Stanford."
It's an especially revolting
word because. considering.
Stanford's history, it's likely any
little complacency during practice
or game will turn out to ruin the
Cards' chances for a Rose Bowl.
Complacency didn't quite do
so Saturday, only because of big

plays by nearly every defensive
starter and because the Cards had
accumulated that
not-so-comfortable 20-6 lead.
The trip to the Palouse began
in grand style. The team saw
King of Hearts at the Cordova
Theatre Friday night and Cordova
put on his own show for awhile,
hitting Brad Williams twice for an
early touchdown.
Close Calls
During the first half, the
Cougars came close to
touchdowns three times, only to
lose them because of bad breaks
and a hard-hitting Card defense.
First, number one Cougar QB
John Hopkins pitched to Duke
Fergerson, who threw a good
pass into the endzone way behind
the Stanford secondary— but the
pass was dropped.
On another first quarter series,
WSU was at the Card eight, and
Hopkins completed a pass to the
two. .It could have been a
touchdown throw, but Paul
Skrabo made a jarring tackle. The
Cougars went for a TD on
fourth down from the two, but
Geb Church stopped Hopkins cold.
Early in the second quarter
WSU actually scored a field goal,
but elected not to take it because
of a penalty against the Cards. On
first and goal, Hopkins fumbled at
the one-yard-line, and Doc
Blanchard got it.
WSU did get two field goals from
Joe Danelo, including a school
record kick of 55 yards, but these
were offset by boots of 47 and 24
yards by Mike Langford.
Stanford mounted a iong,
effective drive early in the fourth
quarter, utilizing a great running
game not seen this year. Test
punctuated the drive when he
found a gaping hole in the Cougar
pass defense, told Cordova about
it and waited all alone for the
12-yard touchdown pass.
Scott Laidlaw played a great
game, gaining 83 yards in 20
carries. Laidlaw was speared in the
ribs on the first play from
scrimmage, and after that, often
had to leave the field to catch his
breath. Joe Baumgaertner also did
well, gaining 18 yards in four
rushes and catching four passes
for 41 yards.

Both Laidlaw and Cordova
praised good one-on-one blocking,
by both the line and the blocking
back, for the success of the
rushing attack.

PULLMAN, Wash.—During the
fourth quarter of Saturday's
20-18 win over Washington State,
the minds of Cardinal fans
vacillated between ugly memories
and an all-too-familiar present.
It was a crisp, sunny afternoon
at Pullman, and Stanford, making
crunching tackles and blocks, was
breezing to what would be a
satisfying (if a bit drab) 20-6
victory.
With 11:04 to play, WSU put
in its third-string quarterback,
Wally Bennett. (Who? Jim
Sweeney sure must be desperate.)
Some running plays gain a few
first downs. (Who cares. We're
going to win.) Then Bennett hits a
couple 20-yarders and runs for a
touchdown.
It was a warm, hazy afternoon
at Stanford Stadium, and the
Cards, after a rough start, were
about to beat San Jose State
21-14. Then, suddenly, the
defense just couldn't stop the
out manned Spartans.

The try for a two-point
conversion, however, is no good.
Forrie Martin bats down Bennett's
pass, and it's still 20-12.
Stanford gets the ball back.
After one first down, the offense
stalls. On a third-and-six, Mike
Cordova fades back, possibly slips
and throws a pass which is
blocked.
It was a quiet night in Los
Angeles, and all Cordova had to
do was stay on his feel to get a
first down to beat UCLA. He
slipped, and things went downhill
from there.
Tom Lynn, who has been
booting high kicks under pressure
ail day, comes in to punt. Yet
Stanford Sports Information
Director Gary Cavalli correctly
predicts, "It's going to be
blocked."
Scott Mullinex leads a horde of
Cougars in on Lynn. Mullinex
blocks the punt, and the ball
careens 25 yards high and back
after hitting the astroturf behind
Lynn. Ozell Bledsoe grabs it in the

endzone for a touchdown.
It was a grey, dull day at
Stanford against Penn Stale and a
cold day at Ann Arbor last year,
when a blocked punt and a
fumbled punt snap turned the tide
against the Cards.
WSU now must try for two
points to tie. Bennett rolls to his
right, but somehow, Drew Palin
breaks in on him. Bennett tries to
pitch, but-fumbles and when next
seen, the football is safely in Jeff
Siemens' grasp. So it's still
Stanford 20, WSU 18.
Ted Pappas snares the ensuing
on-side kick and Stanford takes
over again. And does nothing
again. Eric Test punts into the
endzone.
