# JV's Beat Weed, But...
## 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
Doug Single's junior varsity
football team won its season
opener over the College of the
Siskiyous in scenic Weed,
California, 34-21, Friday
afternoon and that's about all that
went right.
What could be so terrible if
Stanford won? How about a late
arrival, a locker-room theft, and a
breakdown on the return trip? It
all happened.
The team bus arrived jn Weed a
whole 40 minutes before
game-time. While the JV's were
trying to fight 30-40 mile-an-hour
winds in addition to the
opposition, their unlocked and
unguarded locker room was being
robbed.
Missing were two watches, $75
in cash, a ring, and a wallet filled
with credit cards. Talk about
winning a game at any cost. . .
As if the troubles were over,
the returning bus broke down

somewhere in The Twilight Zone
between Weed and Redding. The
JV's finally got back to Stanford
at about 6:30 a.m. Saturday.
Altogether, the round-trip bus
ride lasted 25 hours.
Turning to trivia, the JV's
played well against a team with
seven games behind them. The
wind necessitated a reliance on
the ground game and Stanford
responded with 391 rushing yards.
Junior Greg Smith accounted for
almost half, gaining 188 yards on
just five carries. Freshman Gary
Lynn ran for 85 yards on 12
carries and scored two
touchdowns, as did Smith.
Coach Single was happy with
his team's defensive play, and
"singled" out nose guard Art
Estrada, linebacker Dan McCann
and strong safety Ralph Phillips.
The JV's will be in action next
against Cal-Poly-San Luis Obispo
on Monday, November 4 at 2 p.m.
Single must be happy that the
game will be played at home.

RISING STARâ€”Stanford freshman Pam Palmieri took third in the
Stanford Women's Invitational Golf Tournament last week, despite a
poor second round. Palmieri and Pat Cornett form a potent duo for
the women's team.
