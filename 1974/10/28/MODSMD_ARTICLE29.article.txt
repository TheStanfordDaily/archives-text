Hunt Takes Stand In Cover-Up Trial
WASHINGTON E. Howard Hunt, Jr., retired CIA agent and
convicted Watergate burglar, takes the stand today as only the
second witness to be heard in the 20 days the Watergate cover-up
trial has been in session.
Like the other prosecution witnesses to follow, Hunt has been
called to back up the testimony of John W. Dean 111, who
finished a marathon eight day tour Friday as the leadoff witness.
Hunt, author of a soon-to-be-released book, Undercover:
Memoirs of a Secret Agent, will be asked about his attempts to
obtain funds from the White House after he and six other men
were arrested in the Watergate burglary.
Hunt denies testimony from Dean that Hunt threatened to
expose some "seamy things" he did for the White House before
the June 17, 1972, break-in'if thousands of dollars in cash were
not paid to him and the other defendants.
Hunt, who while still with the CIA helped plan the aborted
Bay of Pigs invasion against Cuba in the early 19605, pleaded
guilty on Jan. 11, 1973, in the original break-in at Democratic
National Committee headquarters.
Sentenced on various charges to 2V2 to eight years, and fined
$lO,OOO, he is now free pending appeal after serving 10 months,
five days of the prison term.
Ford Calls Americans 'Self-Destructive'
ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE President Ford said Americans
are afflicted with "self destruct" feelings and "there's no reason
why it should be."
That, he said, "is what we've got to lick."
"We're condemning ourselves so much we're hurting ourselves
when we should be doing just the opposite," Ford said in an
exclusive interview, his first since taking office. "There is a
self-destruct kind of feeling. .. That's what we've got to
overcome."
The President spoke for more than an hour last Monday night
on the return trip from his visit to Mexico.
In the wide ranging interview, the President talked about
"tougher measures," if necessary, to. reduce American
dependence on Arab oil and said, "We could really put an
embargo on foreign imports which would have a much more
severe impact on availability and supply."
He said this might be necessary if Congress "failed to increase
supplies," or the public failed "to conserve."
Ford declined to call the nation's economic problems "a
recession" and said only "an international crisis of major
proportions" could persuade him that wage and price controls
were necessary.
"I don't see anything domestically," he said, "that would
precipitate it."
He predicted his wobbly "marriage" which Congress would
improve after the elections.
"Troops on both sides of the aisle defected in large numbers"
on aid to Turkey, he said.
Kissinger Says Arms Agreement Likely
NEW DELHI, India Henry A. Kissinger said yesterday there
is a#reasonable chance of an agreement next year between the
States and the Soviet Union to limit offensive nuclear
weapons.
"We are aiming for an agreement during 1975," the secretary
of state said.
He spoke to newsmen on a flight to India after three days of
talks inMoscowwith Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
The two sides issued a communique after Kissinger left Moscow
that noted steady improvement in relations between the
countries, and Pravda, the Soviet Communist party newspaper
said, "The positive turn which came about in Soviet-American

relations is of tremendous significance for the destinies of the
whole world."
Kissinger received a correct reception as he arrived to begin a
reconciliation mission to India.
But Prime Minister Indira Gandhi demonstrated the need for
mending fences with a published comment blaming Washington
solely for the three years of estrangement. "It is really for them
to think this out," she said.
On prospects for a U.S.-Soviet nuclear treaty, a senior
American offician said a treaty might even be ready next summer
when Brezhnev visits Washington.
Gangster: SLA Fugitives Left Cleveland
LOS ANGELES - Patricia Hearst and her fellow Symbionese
Liberation Army fugitives were "pretty well situated" in the
black community of Cleveland, Ohio, until they were advised
recently to hide elsewhere, retired gangster Mickey Cohen said.
Cohen said he believed the fugitive newspaper heiress and
William Emily Harris had been living in Cleveland "up until
13 or 14 days ago."
But Cohen, who said he had located Miss Hearst as a favor to
her parents, said he spread the word for the three to leave
Cleveland, and he was sure they had done so.
Asked if he knew where they were now, Cohen said in a
weekend interview, "Absolutely not and I don't want to know."
The FBI had no comment on the Cohen story. The fugitive
trio is believed to be among the last remaining members of the
terrorist SLA.
Six others died in a shootout with Los Angeles police last May
17, and the missing trio has eluded authorities since then.
The SLA kidnaped Miss Hearts from her Berkeley apartment
last Feb. 4. She latter said in a taped message that she had joined
the group as a revolutionary fighter, and had taken the name
"Tanya."
Cohen said he told Hearst's general whereabouts to her
parents, San Francisco newspaper executive Randolph A, Hearst
and his wife, Catherine, earlier this month.
But he did not name the city, he said, because the Hearsts had
no way to ensure "that she didn't have to go to prison."
The girl is wanted by the FBI in connection with a shooting
incident at a sporting goods store in suburban Los Angeles, and
on state charges relating to the kidnaping of a youth when the
SLA was trying to obtain a getaway vehicle.
"I don't bring nobody in to go to prison," said Cohen,
explaining why he had given up attempts to find the girl.
Agents Seize Counterfeit Bills
LOS ANGELES Secret Service agents yesterday made what
they called the largest seizure of counterfeit money in U.S.
history, more than $8 million in $lOO bills.
Four California men were arrested and booked for
investigation of manufacturing and possession of counterfeit
money, according to Robert E. Powis, special agent in charge of
the Los Angeles office of the Secret Service.
Powis said his office received a tip three weeks ago on the
operation and began surveillance of the ring's .members.
Agents moved in on the men after they had placed the bulk of
the money in a van, Powis said.
Those arrested were identified as Leonard O. Salmon, 39, of
Lakewood; Kenneth Clarence Wall, 48, of Buena Park; Robert
James Spratte, 33, of Whittier and Sam Jackson Anders, 35, of
Compton.
Kennedy Takes Blame For Chappaquiddick
BOSTON Sen Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said his
conduct after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident was "irrational
and indefensivle and inexcusable and inexplicable."
In a copyright article published in The Boston Sunday Globe,

Kennedy said he will bear responsibility for the incident, in which
Mary Jo Kopechne died, for the rest of his life.
When Kennedy dropped out of the 1976 Democratic
presidential contention last month, he said Chappaquiddick was
not a factor in that decision but it would have been a campaign
issue.
The incident occurred July 18, 1969. Kopechne drowned
when Kennedy's car, driven by him, ran off a wooden bridge and
landed upside down in a tidal pool. She was a passenger in the
car.
The incident was after a party on Chappaquiddick Island on
Martha's Vineyard, when the senator gave Kopechne a ride home.
On the way toward Edgar-town, Kennedy has said he took a
wrong turn, ending up on the Dike Bridge, where the car plunged
into the water and Kennedy escaped. He said he tried to rescue
the girl but could not.
The accident was not reported to police until the following
morning.
In the Globe interview, Kennedy said he was mistaken not to
inform police that two of his colleagues had tried to rescue
Kopechne from the car.
Arabs Say Compromise Impossible
RABAT, Morocco Arab leaders met yesterday in an attempt
to reconcile Jordan and the Palestinian guerilla movement, but
officials of both sides said a compromise was impossible.
Representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) and the Jordanian delegation both claimed the right to
negotiate for the return of the occupied West Bank of Jordan
from Israel.
Jordan's King Hussein and PLO chief Yasir Arafat attended a
closely guarded meeting in the palace of King Hassan II of
Morocco in which Hussein made a gengthy exposition of his case.
A high Jordanian official said the situation did not lend itself
to compromise because Israel refuses to deal with the PLO.
"King Hussein insists on a clear mandate from the other heads
of state on what they want Jordan to do," the official said.
But a Palestinian spokesman said, "We will not accept any
compromise with Jordan concerning our right to speak for the
Palestinian people."
Opening the summit last night, Hussan called on Hussein and
Arafat to "overcome all obstacles and marginal problems and
show the spirit of tolerance needed to build a bridge of honor."
