# Pub Board Seats New Publication
## 'Live Oak' Granted Space 
### KATHY ALCALA 
The ASSU Publications Board
Friday reallocated one half of the
Chaparral's space in the Storke
Student Publications Building to Live
Oak, a new weekly publication.
The motion, which passed 6-1, gave
Live Oak access to work space
adjacent to the photo lab until June
15. In June, the space i will
automatically revert back to the
Chaparral , in absence of further Pub
Board action.
The decision came after the Pub
Board concluded it had no power to
determine who should control the
Chaparral. The issue has been debated
since the Chaparral was closed this
summer by ASSU financial manager
Frank Olivieri for alleged
mismanagement. i
The Pub Board ruled that the
Chaparral had ceased to publish,
whicji, under its by-laws gives the Pub
Board control of the Chaparral office
space.
Undergraduate Mike Dornheim and
graduate student Mason Blacher have
both submitted proposals for reviving
the Chaparral. Dornheim and Blacher
have been unable to reach an
agreement to cooperate on the
publication.
Complications
The issue was further complicated
by the presence of Stan Norton, a
trustee of the Hammer and Coffin

Trust Fund and a member of the Palo
Alto City Council. The Trust Fund
was S7OOO for use by the Chaparral.
Norton explained that the trustees
and several alumni had met and
approved a plan offered by Blacher.
When asked if the organization would
support a different editor, should the
control of the Chaparral fall to
someone else, Norton simply said "I
feel an obligation to fulfill that plan."
Because it appeared to the Pub
Board that the Chaparral issue would
remain unresolved, it was considered a
waste of valuable space to leave the
Chaparral's quarters unused. In
addition to Live Oak, the Women's
News Service and the ASSU Course
Review have also requested space in
the Storke Building.
Informal Agreement
Bill Weinstein, Live Oak's editor
business manager, said he had
previously made an informal
agreement with former Chaparral
editor Mark Lee to share the Storke
Building space. When the Chaparral
was closed down, it was unclear
whether Weinstein would be allowed
to use the space.
Friday's vote gave Weinstein official
approval to continue with his plans.
The remaining Chaparral space will be
reserved for whoever is recognized as
the Chaparral editor.
In other Pub Board business, Live
Oak submitted a request for funding.

The Pub Board decided to review
funding proposals at the next meeting,
and the Live Oak's request will be
considered at that time. A committee
was formed to review applications for
funding from any publication and
make recommendations to the Pub
Board.
Live Oak also requested a seat
on the Pub Board. Despite fears that a
publication as new as Live Oak will
not be permanent, it was given
membership with one vote on the Pub
Board.

Chaparral. The issue has been debated
since the Chaparral was closed this
summer by ASSU financial manager
Frank Olivieri for alleged
mismanagement. i
The Pub Board ruled that the
Chaparral had ceased to publish,
whicji, under its by-laws gives the Pub
Board control of the Chaparral office
space.
Undergraduate Mike Dornheim and
graduate student Mason Blacher have
both submitted proposals for reviving
the Chaparral. Dornheim and Blacher
have been unable to reach an
agreement to cooperate on the
publication.
Complications
The issue was further complicated
by the presence of Stan Norton, a
trustee of the Hammer and Coffin

Trust Fund and a member of the Palo
Alto City Council. The Trust Fund
was S7OOO for use by the Chaparral.
Norton explained that the trustees
and several alumni had met and
approved a plan offered by Blacher.
When asked if the organization would
support a different editor, should the
control of the Chaparral fall to
someone else, Norton simply said "I
feel an obligation to fulfill that plan."
Because it appeared to the Pub
Board that the Chaparral issue would
remain unresolved, it was considered a
waste of valuable space to leave the
Chaparral's quarters unused. In
addition to Live Oak, the Women's
News Service and the ASSU Course
Review have also requested space in
the Storke Building.
Informal Agreement
Bill Weinstein, Live Oak's editor
business manager, said he had
previously made an informal
agreement with former Chaparral
editor Mark Lee to share the Storke
Building space. When the Chaparral
was closed down, it was unclear
whether Weinstein would be allowed
to use the space.
Friday's vote gave Weinstein official
approval to continue with his plans.
The remaining Chaparral space will be
reserved for whoever is recognized as
the Chaparral editor.
In other Pub Board business, Live
Oak submitted a request for funding.

The Pub Board decided to review
funding proposals at the next meeting,
and the Live Oak's request will be
considered at that time. A committee
was formed to review applications for
funding from any publication and
make recommendations to the Pub
Board.
Live Oak also requested a seat
on the Pub Board. Despite fears that a
publication as new as Live Oak will
not be permanent, it was given
membership with one vote on the Pub
Board.
The ASSU Publications Board
Friday reallocated one half of the
Chaparral's space in the Storke
Student Publications Building to Live
Oak, a new weekly publication.
The motion, which passed 6-1, gave
Live Oak access to work space
adjacent to the photo lab until June
15. In June, the space i will
automatically revert back to the
Chaparral , in absence of further Pub
Board action.
The decision came after the Pub
Board concluded it had no power to
determine who should control the
Chaparral. The issue has been debated

summer by ASSU financial manager
