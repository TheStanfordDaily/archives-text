# 350 Students Still On Dorm Wait Lists
## 
### CECILE HEROLD 
About 350 students currently living
off-campus are on waiting-lists for fall
and winter quarters, Sue Espinosa,
administrative assistant to the dean of
student affairs said yesterday.
"Roughly 600 students remain on
the University housing waiting list,"
she said, explaining that this included
250 inter-residential transfer requests
in addition to the 350 transfer and
returning students who are currently
off-campus.
Susan Richard of the Single
Student Housing Office noted that "it
is difficult to pinpoint an exact
number |on the waiting list now]
because so many students have
dropped off or deferred to a later list."
About 820 students emerged from
last spring's housing draw unassigned.
Between Sept. 20 and Oct. 1, 130
students from that list received
on-campus housing, but since then
"activity has been negligible," Richard
noted. She added that of those
assignments made, about 30 students
already had other arrangements.
Other Arrangements
Many of those other arrangements
were made through the Rental
Housing Office, which was greatly
supplemented at the beginning of this
quarter by the Clearing House, an
independent housing placement
agency.
"During the six weeks they were
open," said June Becker of Rental
Housing," they succeeded in placing
670 students."
Becker estimates that the average
student tenant pays $lOO per month
rental with utilities and commutes 10
miles daily to and from Stanford.
Student Tenants
Some students are tenants with
very little commuting distance,
however, having rented rooms
on-campus in the homes of faculty.
Becker was unable to give an exact
number of students with faculty
landlords because "so many find their
rooms not through us but through

separate departments or friends or
individual door-to door canvassing."
Junior Gordon Firestein rents a
separate-entryway room from a
professor who lives close to Mayfield
Avenue and the Row. "Of the living
choices I faced when I drew
off-campus, I think I've found the
most satisfactory, and it's very quiet
maybe too quiet."
"The need for additional
on-campus student housing seems
clear," says the booklet,
Undergraduate Housing Needs at
Stanford.
Proposal
One proposal for providing more
housing cheaply and quickly is the
construction of a second trailer park.
In reference to this proposal. Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons said, "We
must know which option is better for
students bad on-campus housing or
living off campus."
As shown by a "most popular, least
popular" residence survey compiled
last spring by the Housing Office,
students prefer small campus houses.
Most frequently listed first priority
in the draw were Lathrop, Lamdu Nu,
Eucalypto, Phi Psi, Theta Chi,
Adelpha, Durand, Alpha Sig, Grove
and ATO.
Low in popularity among women
students were the all-female houses
Storey, Guthrie and Roth. Associate
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton
discussed this unpopularity in relation
to a housing proposal which attempts
to meet Title IX's "fair treatment of
women" requirements.
"The proposal suggests extending
the fraternities draw exemption
privileges to the university's all-women
residences, making them, in effect,
unofficial sororities," said Horton.
"But to take housing perceived as
generally undesirable by tne women
and suddenly make it 'privileged'
would not represent satisfactory
action in solving the issue, unless there
was a sound education reason for
doing so," Horton added.

ANOTHER HIT ALBUM?â€”The Incomparable Leland Stanford Jr. University Marching Band (ILSJUMB) converged on
Memorial Church Friday and Saturday night to record a third album of current hits, played with the special band flair.
About 160 band members turned out for the recording session, held in the church for its acoustic qualities. The album, to
be released in December, is "bound to be a smash," according to one bandsman.
