# Panther Fights For Council Seat; Attorney Charges
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The Black Panther Party will "put
on suits and ties" if that's what it
takes to win a seat on the Oakland
City Council, party spokeswoman
Elaine Brown told a campus audience
Friday night.
Speaking to a group numbering just
under 100 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
Brown said it is imperative the
Panthers win a seat next April.
"We'll do anything. We may have a
circus in the street" if it's necessary to
win, she said. Brown ran
unsuccessfully, for a seat on the
council in 1973, and will try again this
spring.
She defended the Panthers, once
reknowned as one of the most militant
black groups in the United States,
against charges of "co-optation."
'ln The System'
"We're participants in the system in
this country," Brown insisted. "We
have to face that reality. The question
is how to win how to transform the
system . . . We , began the Black
Panther Party for the purpose of
beginning to change the system."
When Black Panther Chairman
Bobby Seale ran for mayor of Oakland
in 1973, it "was an example to a lot of
people," Brown said. She said she
toured the country and found "people
didn't even know how was elected in
their own city, but they knew about
the Oakland election and Bobby
Seale."
The campaign will cost between
$30,000 and $40,000, Brown said.
"We're going to have the kind of
campaign people are used to seeing on
TV." she added.
Alleged Plot
Brown said the Panthers must win a
seat in 1975 because Oakland's rich
are plotting to sell the city's port and
destroy the economic base there. By
1977, the next election year, "there
might not be anything left," she
warned.
If the Panthers lose, the city's
residents will end up "begging for
federal funds from a government that
has no ears for the poor," she said.
"We want to put together the Super
Flies and the Archie Bunkers," Brown
added, calling for a wide coalition of
voters to unite behind her candidacy.
Harassment
She said police, in an attempt to
block a Panther victory at the polls,
have harassed party leader Huey
Newton with phone taps, assassination

attempts, and burglary of his
apartment.
Brown said the burglary was
performed by three black men with
pistols; silencers, and professional
lock-picking equipment.
"The average black person robbing
things these days hasn't had too much
access to a silencer or a police
lock-breaker," she said.
Newton's Whereabouts
Charles Garry, Newton's attorney,
also spoke, and told the audience he
didn't know where Newton was.
Newton, charged with three counts
of assault, two of battery and one of
false imprisonment, jumped bail on
Aug. 23 and hasn't been seen since.
"I don't know where Huey Newton
is. I don't know what's happened to
him," Garry said. "I don't know if he's
alive or dead . . .
"Very frankly, Huey said to me

once, several months ago, 'Charles, I've
just had it. . . Wherever I go I'm
harassed and harried.' "
Prison Term
Garry said Newton was never really
a free man after he served three years
in prison for a murder conviction that
was later overturned. When Newton
was released, Garry said, he
announced:
"I am no longer in maximum
security, but I'm still in minimum
security."
"He's been shot at," Garry said.
"Automobiles have tried to run him
over. He's been framed on one thing or
the other, time and time again."
Garry also predicted thai if Elaine
Brown tried to run for the Oakland
City Council, she would be "indicted
or charged with a felony" to discredit
her candidacy.

have to face that reality. The question
is how to win how to transform the
system . . . We , began the Black
Panther Party for the purpose of
beginning to change the system."
When Black Panther Chairman
Bobby Seale ran for mayor of Oakland
in 1973, it "was an example to a lot of
people," Brown said. She said she
toured the country and found "people
didn't even know how was elected in
their own city, but they knew about
the Oakland election and Bobby
Seale."
The campaign will cost between
$30,000 and $40,000, Brown said.
"We're going to have the kind of
campaign people are used to seeing on
TV." she added.
Alleged Plot
Brown said the Panthers must win a
seat in 1975 because Oakland's rich
are plotting to sell the city's port and
destroy the economic base there. By
1977, the next election year, "there
might not be anything left," she
warned.
If the Panthers lose, the city's
residents will end up "begging for
federal funds from a government that
has no ears for the poor," she said.
"We want to put together the Super
Flies and the Archie Bunkers," Brown
added, calling for a wide coalition of
voters to unite behind her candidacy.
Harassment
She said police, in an attempt to
block a Panther victory at the polls,
have harassed party leader Huey
Newton with phone taps, assassination

attempts, and burglary of his
apartment.
Brown said the burglary was
performed by three black men with
pistols; silencers, and professional
lock-picking equipment.
"The average black person robbing
things these days hasn't had too much
access to a silencer or a police
lock-breaker," she said.
Newton's Whereabouts
Charles Garry, Newton's attorney,
also spoke, and told the audience he
didn't know where Newton was.
Newton, charged with three counts
of assault, two of battery and one of
false imprisonment, jumped bail on
Aug. 23 and hasn't been seen since.
"I don't know where Huey Newton
is. I don't know what's happened to
him," Garry said. "I don't know if he's
alive or dead . . .
"Very frankly, Huey said to me

once, several months ago, 'Charles, I've
just had it. . . Wherever I go I'm
harassed and harried.' "
Prison Term
Garry said Newton was never really
a free man after he served three years
in prison for a murder conviction that
was later overturned. When Newton
was released, Garry said, he
announced:
"I am no longer in maximum
security, but I'm still in minimum
security."
"He's been shot at," Garry said.
"Automobiles have tried to run him
over. He's been framed on one thing or
the other, time and time again."
Garry also predicted thai if Elaine
Brown tried to run for the Oakland
City Council, she would be "indicted
or charged with a felony" to discredit
her candidacy.

PANTHER ATTORNEY—CharIes Garry, attorney for Black Panther party leader
Huey Newton, spoke Friday to a group at Dinkelspiel about the party's election
bid for a Oakland city council seat. Garry complained about "harassment" of
the party by law enforcement agencies seeking to destroy the party and Newton.
The party's candidate, Elaine Brown claimed it was "imperative" she win in
order to ensure the survival of the party.
The Black Panther Party will "put
on suits and ties" if that's what it
takes to win a seat on the Oakland
City Council, party spokeswoman
Elaine Brown told a campus audience
Friday night.
Speaking to a group numbering just
under 100 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
Brown said it is imperative the
Panthers win a seat next April.
"We'll do anything. We may have a
circus in the street" if it's necessary to
win, she said. Brown ran
unsuccessfully, for a seat on the
council in 1973, and will try again this
spring.
She defended the Panthers, once
reknowned as one of the most militant
black groups in the United States,
against charges of "co-optation."

are plotting to sell the city's port and
destroy the economic base there. By
1977, the next election year, "there
might not be anything left," she
warned.
If the Panthers lose, the city's
residents will end up "begging for
federal funds from a government that
has no ears for the poor," she said.
"We want to put together the Super
Flies and the Archie Bunkers," Brown
added, calling for a wide coalition of
voters to unite behind her candidacy.
Harassment
She said police, in an attempt to
block a Panther victory at the polls,
have harassed party leader Huey
Newton with phone taps, assassination

attempts, and burglary of his
apartment.
Brown said the burglary was
performed by three black men with
pistols; silencers, and professional
lock-picking equipment.
"The average black person robbing
things these days hasn't had too much
access to a silencer or a police
lock-breaker," she said.
Newton's Whereabouts
Charles Garry, Newton's attorney,
also spoke, and told the audience he
didn't know where Newton was.
Newton, charged with three counts
of assault, two of battery and one of
false imprisonment, jumped bail on
Aug. 23 and hasn't been seen since.
"I don't know where Huey Newton
is. I don't know what's happened to
him," Garry said. "I don't know if he's
alive or dead . . .
"Very frankly, Huey said to me

once, several months ago, 'Charles, I've
just had it. . . Wherever I go I'm
harassed and harried.' "
Prison Term
Garry said Newton was never really
a free man after he served three years
in prison for a murder conviction that
was later overturned. When Newton
was released, Garry said, he
announced:
"I am no longer in maximum
security, but I'm still in minimum
security."
"He's been shot at," Garry said.
"Automobiles have tried to run him
over. He's been framed on one thing or
the other, time and time again."
Garry also predicted thai if Elaine
Brown tried to run for the Oakland
City Council, she would be "indicted
or charged with a felony" to discredit
her candidacy.
