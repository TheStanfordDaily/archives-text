Arlen Gregorio

We strongly urge the re-election of state Senator Arlen
Gregorio to represent the 10th District.
Originally elected to the Senate from San Mateo County's
12th District in 1970, Gregorio has compiled a fine record
of achievement during his four years in office.

Making good his campaign promises of agressive
environmental legislation, Gregorio authored successful bills
to remove Highway 84 the proposed Willow Expressway
through Menlo Park, and its extension, a freeway to the
coast from the state highway system. Gregorio also
successfully authored legislation to prevent freeway
construction on portions of Highway 1.
Gregorio co-authored campaign reform legislation which
was eventually defeated in both 1973 and 1974; in 1973,
Gregorio also authored unsuccessful bills to limit legislators
to 12 consecutive years in the same office, and-to reorganize
the state legislature into a 99-member unicameral body.
During 1973 legislative bickering over reapportionment,
Gregorio authored a constitutional amendment to establish a
non-partisan, independent reapportionment commission
permanently removing redistricting from legislative control.
This measure fell a scant five votes short of the two-thirds
majority needed to leave the Senate.
Successful Gregorio measures include the Family
Protection Act of 1974, which reforms the state foster care
program; a 1973 bill setting up local alcohol rehabilitation
programs; and several bills extending the rights of
18-year-olds and high school students.
While many of Gregorio's efforts have received less public
attention than his campaign reform attempts, it is of special
importance that he has been highly successful at passing
legislation which, while less likely to catch headlines, is more
likely to affect voters in his home district.
Gregorio's Republican opponent, James Tormey Jr., has
built his campaign on the support of local construction and
development interests long unhappy with Gregorio's efforts
opposing coastal development in San Mateo County.
It is precisely Gregorio's willingness to fight for sane
environmental planning on the local level—where re-election
hangs in the balance—that has made him an effective and
sympathetic representative of San Mateo County.

Bureocrotic Bungling

This week's bureaucratic bungling award goes to
President Richard W. Lyman's staff, which scheduled
tonight's "State of the University" address in direct
competition with a campus appearance by R. Sargent
Shriver.
When informed of the scheduling conflict Thursday
night, Lyman himself was disbelieving. "I expect staff to
figure out things like that," Lyman said before checking to
see if arrangements could be changed.
It turned out that Lyman's speech was rescheduled for 7
p.m. and Shriver's was moved up to 8:30, so it will be
possible for members of the Stanford community to hear
Lyman's most important address.of the year and also attend
one of the most attractive programs offered by the ASSU
Speakers' Bureau.
But the whole mess is still utterly ridiculous, especially
since Shriver's appearance was advertised more than two
weeks ago.

It turned out that Lyman's speech was rescheduled for 7

Arlen Gregorio

We strongly urge the re-election of state Senator Arlen
Gregorio to represent the 10th District.
Originally elected to the Senate from San Mateo County's
12th District in 1970, Gregorio has compiled a fine record
of achievement during his four years in office.

Making good his campaign promises of agressive
environmental legislation, Gregorio authored successful bills
to remove Highway 84 the proposed Willow Expressway
through Menlo Park, and its extension, a freeway to the
coast from the state highway system. Gregorio also
successfully authored legislation to prevent freeway
construction on portions of Highway 1.
Gregorio co-authored campaign reform legislation which
was eventually defeated in both 1973 and 1974; in 1973,
Gregorio also authored unsuccessful bills to limit legislators
to 12 consecutive years in the same office, and-to reorganize
the state legislature into a 99-member unicameral body.
During 1973 legislative bickering over reapportionment,
Gregorio authored a constitutional amendment to establish a
non-partisan, independent reapportionment commission
permanently removing redistricting from legislative control.
This measure fell a scant five votes short of the two-thirds
majority needed to leave the Senate.
Successful Gregorio measures include the Family
Protection Act of 1974, which reforms the state foster care
program; a 1973 bill setting up local alcohol rehabilitation
programs; and several bills extending the rights of
18-year-olds and high school students.
While many of Gregorio's efforts have received less public
attention than his campaign reform attempts, it is of special
importance that he has been highly successful at passing
legislation which, while less likely to catch headlines, is more
likely to affect voters in his home district.
Gregorio's Republican opponent, James Tormey Jr., has
built his campaign on the support of local construction and
development interests long unhappy with Gregorio's efforts
opposing coastal development in San Mateo County.
It is precisely Gregorio's willingness to fight for sane
environmental planning on the local level—where re-election
hangs in the balance—that has made him an effective and
sympathetic representative of San Mateo County.

Bureocrotic Bungling

This week's bureaucratic bungling award goes to
President Richard W. Lyman's staff, which scheduled
