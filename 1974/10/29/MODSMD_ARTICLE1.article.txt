# Lyman Urges Debate On University Needs
## 
### DON COX 
"With all hell breaking loose in the
economy," President Richard Lyman
last night urged the University
community to engage "in
tough-minded debate on the basic
questions of purpose and function of
the contemporary University" in order
to deal intelligently with mounting
financial pressures.
Speaking to 125 people in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium on the "State
of the University," Lyman said "we'll
have tough choices to make between
desirable alternatives" such as dorms
and libraries.
Building plans have been seriously
disrupted by inflation to the point
that "we can have a Chemistry
Department in which a Nobel Prize is
won, but the undergraduate
laboratories are less adequate than
those to be encountered in a
self-respecting community college," he
said.
Lyman "confessed to some feeling
of disappointment at what seems to
me the relative lack of discussion of
serious educational issues among
students . at Stanford." Those
organizations that do tackle these
issues "don't seem to arouse one half
the interest and excited involvement
that is stirred by Title IX as it applies
to Stanford fraternities, or "even the
loss of an unpopular and financially
distressed cafeteria," he said.
Housing
Lyman talked about the housing
problem and other issues in a question
and answer period at the end of his
address and later at an informal
gathering of 50 people at Tresidder
small lounge.
Though he characterized the
housing draw as "an extraordinarily
ingenious development to ration" the
available housing, Lyman expressed
reservations about having the draw
"forming the core of the housing
system."

"I don't mean to pre-judge whether
I think everybody should be in the
draw ... but solving the problem with
one stroke of the knife isn't right," he
said.
Fraternity Alumni
Lyman added that he didn't "think
you can just brush aside the point
made by fraternity alumni people who
gave money to build housing to be in
the hands of the fraternities. We can't
pretend this didn't happen."
"Reintroducing the sororities
wouldn't be desirable," said Lyman.
He advocated a solution to the housing
problem "that would take away the
advantage of being male," though he
didn't know what this solution might
be.
He predicted a solution could be
reached "when the noise level goes
down and people are ready to talk
about it."
"It's not one of the most
monupiental problems we're ever
faced," he said.

SARGENT SPEAKS—Former Peace Corps Director and 1972 vice-presidential
candidate R. Sargent Shriver last night predicted a Democratic sweep in next
Tuesday's mid-term elections.
Responding to other questions,
Lyman said he opposed the "Buckley
amendment" opening University
academic records to the students
because it "is so sweeping."
"How can a drug-counseling service
in high school thrive if its records are
open to the student's parents?" he
( said.
He also speculated that students
would not get "as good letters of
recommendation" from faculty if the
faculty member knew the student
would "peruse" it.
The new presidential commission
advising the president on the financial
plight of the University will be "very
influential" in the formulation of
policy Lyman said. The commission
includes two students, Frank Brokow,
former president of the Business

school students and Cynthia Davis,
co-founder of the Committee for
Research on Women (CROW).

Lyman said current financial
problems may stem from excessive
expansion in earlier years. "We have a
somewhat bigger operation than we
can support without going from
crunch to crunch," he said.

"They didn't have 20/20 foresight,
but this would still be a pretty limited
place if those kind of risks hadn't been
taken," he said of his predecessors.

Lyman talked about the housing
problem and other issues in a question
and answer period at the end of his
address and later at an informal
gathering of 50 people at Tresidder
small lounge.
Though he characterized the
housing draw as "an extraordinarily
ingenious development to ration" the
available housing, Lyman expressed
reservations about having the draw
"forming the core of the housing
system."

"I don't mean to pre-judge whether
I think everybody should be in the
draw ... but solving the problem with
one stroke of the knife isn't right," he
said.
Fraternity Alumni
Lyman added that he didn't "think
you can just brush aside the point
made by fraternity alumni people who
gave money to build housing to be in
the hands of the fraternities. We can't
pretend this didn't happen."
"Reintroducing the sororities
wouldn't be desirable," said Lyman.
He advocated a solution to the housing
problem "that would take away the
advantage of being male," though he
didn't know what this solution might
be.
He predicted a solution could be
reached "when the noise level goes
down and people are ready to talk
about it."
"It's not one of the most
monupiental problems we're ever
faced," he said.

SARGENT SPEAKS—Former Peace Corps Director and 1972 vice-presidential
candidate R. Sargent Shriver last night predicted a Democratic sweep in next
Tuesday's mid-term elections.
Responding to other questions,
Lyman said he opposed the "Buckley
amendment" opening University
academic records to the students
because it "is so sweeping."
"How can a drug-counseling service
in high school thrive if its records are
open to the student's parents?" he
( said.
He also speculated that students
would not get "as good letters of
recommendation" from faculty if the
faculty member knew the student
would "peruse" it.
The new presidential commission
advising the president on the financial
plight of the University will be "very
influential" in the formulation of
policy Lyman said. The commission
includes two students, Frank Brokow,
former president of the Business

school students and Cynthia Davis,
co-founder of the Committee for
Research on Women (CROW).

Lyman said current financial
problems may stem from excessive
expansion in earlier years. "We have a
somewhat bigger operation than we
can support without going from
crunch to crunch," he said.

"They didn't have 20/20 foresight,
but this would still be a pretty limited
place if those kind of risks hadn't been
taken," he said of his predecessors.
"With all hell breaking loose in the
economy," President Richard Lyman
last night urged the University
community to engage "in
tough-minded debate on the basic
questions of purpose and function of
the contemporary University" in order
to deal intelligently with mounting
financial pressures.
Speaking to 125 people in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium on the "State
of the University," Lyman said "we'll
have tough choices to make between
desirable alternatives" such as dorms
and libraries.
Building plans have been seriously
disrupted by inflation to the point
that "we can have a Chemistry
Department in which a Nobel Prize is
won, but the undergraduate
laboratories are less adequate than
those to be encountered in a
self-respecting community college," he
said.
Lyman "confessed to some feeling
of disappointment at what seems to
me the relative lack of discussion of
serious educational issues among
students . at Stanford." Those
organizations that do tackle these
issues "don't seem to arouse one half
the interest and excited involvement
that is stirred by Title IX as it applies
to Stanford fraternities, or "even the
loss of an unpopular and financially
distressed cafeteria," he said.
