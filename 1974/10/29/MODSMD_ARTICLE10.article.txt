# Berkeley Revolt Seen In Retrospect
## 
### Bill Evers 
On Sept. 14, 1964, UC-Berkeley Dean of
Students Katherine Towle informed all
student organizations that there was a new
enforcement policy on the advocacy of
political causes or candidates, the signing up
of members, and collection of funds on land
held by the State of California.
With this political move by the UC
administration, the story of the Free Speech
Movement (FSM), began 10 years ago. A
university that had been touted by
Establishment liberals as a model for higher
education throughout the country became
the scene of a student rebellion.

On Dec. 4, following a mass arrest during
a sit-in, the San Francisco Chronicle
editorialized on the situation at UC:
"Anarchy It is Nothing Less is
intolerable on the campus of the University
of California, just as it is intolerable
anywhere in an orderly society. The 800
disturbers of the peace who have been bodily
hauled out of Sproul Hall and thrown in jail
are now, let us hope, acquiring a timely
insight into the obligations of behavior which
membership in such a society imposes."
Threat To Authority

We can see, as we look back, that
University officials, political leaders,
businessmen, and newspaper editors saw the
FSM as a direct threat to the authorities who
controlled one of the society's important
institutions. The University of California was
one of the highest manifestations of public
education, the process by which the societal
leaders sought to train and mold the values of
the coming generation.
Central to the whole FSM political
perspective was the view epitomized in this

quotation from anarchist writer Paul
Goodman: "At present in the United States,
students middle class youth are the
major exploited class." This quotation stood
at the head of a major ideological position
paper issued by the FSM.
Goodman and the FSM leaders argued
that students were being used for the
purposes of those who dominated the
political and economic system, that the form
and content of the university system had
been shaped in accord with the desires of the
society's political leaders and influential
business interests.
Merger With Industry
In support of these arguments, FSM
speeches and leaflets cited the writings of
UC-President Clark Kerr. For example, Hal
Draper's pamphlet "The Mind of Clark Kerr"
quoted from Kerr's Uses of the University:
"The university is being called upon ... to
respond to the expanding claims of national
service; to merge its activity with industry as
never before; to adapt to and rechannel new
intellectual currents."
Kerr was recognized as a prophet and
vanguard practitioner of bureaucratic
managerial ism. Kerr wrote about the
integration of the university with the
government and with industry during the
Cold War. He spoke of this merger as
inevitable, a situation that had to be
accepted.
In fact, Kerr called "multiversities" like
UC, Stanford, University of Michigan, and
Harvard "federal grant universities" (a phrase
chosen to parallel the governmental "land
grant colleges" set up since the Civil War). He
said, "M.I.T. is at least as much related to

industry and government as lowa State ever
was to agriculture."
Knowledge Industry
It was this nationalized "knowledge
industry" subordinated to political purposes
and business desires that the students were in
revolt against. It was the seemingly apolitical,
nonideological bureaucratic practices of the
corporate liberal system that the students
found most oppressive.
It was in rebellion against the knowledge
industry that FSM leader Mario Savio spoke:
"The conception of Clark Kerr ... is that the
university . . . stands to serve the need of
American industry; it is a factory that turns
out a certain product needed by industry or
government. Because speech does often have
consequences which might alter this
perversion of higher education, the university
must put itself in a position of censorship."
Savio contended that University officials
feared speech that might induce social change
and so they cracked down on free speech to
save their knowledge factory. But, Savio said,
"there is a time when the operation of the
machine becomes so odious, makes you so
sick at heart, that you can't take part; you
can't even passively take part, and you've got
to put your bodies upon the gears and upon
the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the
apparatus and you've got to make it stop.

"And you've got to indicate to the people
who run it, to the people who own it, that
unless you're free, the machines will be
prevented from working at all."
