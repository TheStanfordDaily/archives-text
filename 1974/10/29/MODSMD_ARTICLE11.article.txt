# Britain Survives Another Election
## 
### John Blundell 
With the final results of the
second British election in six
months known, Harold Wilson,
the Labour Party leader, has won
four of the last five general
elections, three of those victories
being against the present
Conservative leader Edward
Heath. Wilson now enters the
same league as Gladstone and
Salisbury, all three having won
four elections. And cause for great
consternation in Tory

headquarters Wilson is younger
now after four victories than
Gladstone was before his first!

Wilson's overall majority is
three and the final swing to
Labour just over two percent. In
earlier times such a small majority
would have meant another
election within a year. This time,
however, the opposition will be so
fragmented that the expected
lifetime at birth of the new
government is approximately
three years.

Also, after the
1964-66 Labour government,
when for 16 months Wilson
existed with a majority of four
against united and determined
opposition, he is rightly dubbed
the leading expert on running
small majority administrations.
Consequently, we will probably
not see the scenes of the mid-60s
again the days when the sick
and near dead were carried into
the House of Commons to vote.
Inaccurate Polls
The low swing of only two
percent to Labour has come as
something of a surprise to many
people. All through the
three-week campaign the polls
predicted a Labour swing of five
to 15, percent. Yet, once again, as
in 1970 and February, the polls
have been miles wide of their
target. On all three occasions they
have predicted a good margin for
Labour which failed to
materialize. Consequently there is
growing pressure from the
socialist back benchers to ban
polls during the last 10 days of
campaigns. They believe that
socialist voters, notorious for their
low propensity to vote, stay at
home in the mistaken belief that
Labour will win easily.
Now that Heath has lost three
out of four election battles against
Wilson, his position as Tory leader
is precarious to say the least. Most
agree that he will resign and like

Sir Alec Douglas-Home in 1965
become Shadow Foreign
Secretary. The only questions are
when, how, and for whom?
Men Of Honor
A quick resignation would
damage the Tories internally.
They like to think of themselves
as men of honor and a quick
resignation would carry a definite
wiff of victimization.
Consequently there will probably
be a period of grace during which
a Shadow Cabinet will be formed.
As for the question of who will
succeed Heath, there are only four
contenders: William Whitelaw,
Keith Joseph, Margaret Thatcher
and Edward du Cann. All four are
considered to be lacking in stature
but they are undoubtedly the best
of the bunch. Whitelaw is hated
by the Ulster unionists after his
period as Minister for Northern

Ireland. Joseph is a Friedmanite
on inflation and consequently is
wide open to attack on
unemployment. Thatcher as
Minister for Education withdrew
free (state-paid) milk for school
children. Du Cann is powerful as
chairman of the 1922 Committee
of Conservative Members of
Parliament but unknown to the
general voting public.
Despondent Liberals
The Liberals are even more
despondent than the Tories over
the election results. This was to
have been thier election the
year they took off and once again
became a force to be reckoned
with. They lost overall in terms of
seats and one million in terms of
votes their bubble has been well
and truly burst.
_ Of the small parties only the
nationalists in Wales and Scotland

have caused to celebrate. The
Scots increased from seven to 11
at the expense of the
Conservatives and are now poised
to take many more seats. The
Welsh kept their two seats and
captured Caernarvon the castle
of that ilk being the focal point of
Welsh Nationalism.
Britain is not only entering a
period of economic crisis but also
a much longer period of
government by minorities or small
majorities. Our system has always
been held up to the world as a
shining example of stable
government. The "system" has
had a rough time this past 12
months. One can only hope that
the economic storm does not
batter the parliamentary ship too
badly over the coming years.
