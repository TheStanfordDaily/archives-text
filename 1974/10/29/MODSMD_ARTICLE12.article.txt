# McCloskey Is A Maverick

### Jeffrey Druckman 
The Daily's "No Endorsement" comment on the
12th District Congressional election represents
editorial writing at its worst. Charges are made
against Rep. Paul MCCloskey, Jr. without specifics
to back them up and inferences are drawn which
raise the question as to how familiar the writers are
with the Congressman's record.
The Daily first decries "McCloskey's apparent
shifts toward a more conservative stance." The one
weak example offered is his alleged position on
strip mining coal. Can the Daily cite a quote in
which McCloskey does not stress the need for
caution and environmental care in this area?
Further, how is this a shift in stance? Where is the
evidence that the congressman once held a
different view and has since contradicted himself?
The Daily labels McCloskey's record as
"environmental provincialism." If this is
provincialism, let us hope that more congressmen
adopt it. McCloskey received a 94 percent rating
from the League of Conservation Voters for his
record on environmental issues. He was also the
only representative to receive the National Park and
Recreation Association's Congressional Award.
The Daily claims McCloskey fails to demonstrate
"critical insights with regard to President Ford's
administration." Again one is expected to believe
this without the backing of a single example. In
fact, McCloskey has vigorously opposed Ford's two
major moves as President the Nixon pardon, and
the proposed five percent surtax. On Sept. 11, he
wrote Ford a letter strongly expressing "hope that
no further pardons will be considered until the
special prosecutor has completed all pending

prosecutions."
In attacking the record on the Equal Rights
Amendment (ERA), the Daily beats a dead horse.
When the amendment first came up for a House
vote, it had been discharged from committee by
petition and has a five minute-per-member debate
limit on it. McCloskey found this insufficient
consideration for an alteration to the Constitution
and voted to recommit. After further committee
study the amendment came to the floor again, this
time with no such debate limit. McCloskey voted in
favor and has since actively supported ERA. The
editorial talks about conservative shifts if one
insists on construing this as such, one must admit it
is a liberal one.
The Daily screams of two more "appalling"
McCloskey features, yet again pops its own balloon
by failing to provide examples. Who are the
conservative Republicans he has supported over
liberals in his own party and who are his
conservative financiers? The facts show that no
such examples exist, because McCloskey is actively
supporting liberal Republican candidates, has never
endorsed a conservative over a liberal in a party
primary, and receives none of his money from the
traditional conservative sources.
It appears that now, without even having the
facts to back itself up, the Daily wants to desert
McCloskey. The fact that Pete McCloskey is neither
liberal nor conservative, but rather his own man,
voting his conscience, seems to have once again
come back to haunt him.

McCloskey features, yet again pops its own balloon
by failing to provide examples. Who are the
conservative Republicans he has supported over
liberals in his own party and who are his
conservative financiers? The facts show that no
such examples exist, because McCloskey is actively
supporting liberal Republican candidates, has never
endorsed a conservative over a liberal in a party
primary, and receives none of his money from the
traditional conservative sources.
It appears that now, without even having the
facts to back itself up, the Daily wants to desert
McCloskey. The fact that Pete McCloskey is neither
liberal nor conservative, but rather his own man,
voting his conscience, seems to have once again
come back to haunt him.

Community for McCloskey.)
The Daily's "No Endorsement" comment on the
12th District Congressional election represents
editorial writing at its worst. Charges are made
against Rep. Paul MCCloskey, Jr. without specifics
to back them up and inferences are drawn which
raise the question as to how familiar the writers are
with the Congressman's record.
The Daily first decries "McCloskey's apparent
shifts toward a more conservative stance." The one
weak example offered is his alleged position on
strip mining coal. Can the Daily cite a quote in
which McCloskey does not stress the need for
caution and environmental care in this area?
Further, how is this a shift in stance? Where is the
evidence that the congressman once held a
different view and has since contradicted himself?
The Daily labels McCloskey's record as
"environmental provincialism." If this is
provincialism, let us hope that more congressmen
adopt it. McCloskey received a 94 percent rating
from the League of Conservation Voters for his
record on environmental issues. He was also the
only representative to receive the National Park and
Recreation Association's Congressional Award.
The Daily claims McCloskey fails to demonstrate
"critical insights with regard to President Ford's
administration." Again one is expected to believe
this without the backing of a single example. In
fact, McCloskey has vigorously opposed Ford's two
major moves as President the Nixon pardon, and
the proposed five percent surtax. On Sept. 11, he
wrote Ford a letter strongly expressing "hope that
no further pardons will be considered until the
special prosecutor has completed all pending

prosecutions."
In attacking the record on the Equal Rights
Amendment (ERA), the Daily beats a dead horse.
When the amendment first came up for a House
vote, it had been discharged from committee by
petition and has a five minute-per-member debate
limit on it. McCloskey found this insufficient
consideration for an alteration to the Constitution
and voted to recommit. After further committee
study the amendment came to the floor again, this
time with no such debate limit. McCloskey voted in
favor and has since actively supported ERA. The
editorial talks about conservative shifts if one
insists on construing this as such, one must admit it
is a liberal one.
The Daily screams of two more "appalling"
McCloskey features, yet again pops its own balloon
