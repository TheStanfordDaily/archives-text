Foot In Mouth?
Editor:
Although expressing a
legitimate grievance, Terri
Borehers' rebuttal (Daily, Oct. 25)
to the Carol Doda feature hardly
serves to advance her cause. What
she has managed to do instead is
take a mildly offensive article at
best, and turn it into a completely
offensive one. Acknowledging
herself that "men are in the
positions of power in this
society," Borehers proceeds, to
turn right around and bite the
hand that feeds her. Causes are
advanced by calm debate and
controlled effective presentation
rather than this type of
overreactionary offepsiveness.
Women's liberation is a worthy
cause, but instead of advancing it,
Borehers' article constitutes a

major regression. With the
liberation movement still fighting
for recognition, Borehers should
realize that hostile alienation is no
way of gaining widespread
acceptance. It is because of
attitudes like hers that women's
liberation carries such negative
connotations throughout the
country.
My father once offered me
some advice that I think would do
Borehers some good. "When you
are annoyed count to 10 and
think about what you are going to
say before you open your big fat
mouth. You're less likely to stick
your foot in it."

Protection Needed
Editor:
The Stanford campus is not a
haven from the crime so common
in our 1970s life. In the past two
years, two students have been
murdered at central locations of
this campus. How many more will
there be before the administration
begins to move toward protecting
the individuals of this
community?

The extent of law enforcement
that is carried out on this
sprawling campus is pitiful. The
"deputized" campus police seem
preoccupied with licensing
bicycles. Others roam about in
their little go-carts, ticketing
illegally parked cars and sheriff's
deputies take an occasional drive
through the campus to warn
negligent motorists. These agents
of the law don't represent the
slightest deterrent to the very high
rate of thefts, the several rapes
and now the two murders that
have happened at our doorstep.
Stanford needs a competent
campus police force. I spent my
undergraduate years at an
incorporated private university
which was in the midst of a city
of 160,000. A non-uniformed
campus police force, equipped
with walkie-talkie units, patrolled,
mostly on foot 24 hours a day.
The campus cops were "good
guys." From the day freshmen set
foot on campus they were advised
by upperclassmen that campus
cops were very welcome friends.
They were there not to watch
students, but to protect them and
their property. The city police
never got involved with an
investigation on campus without
the knowledge and approval of
the campus cops. Their night
patrols covered the campus and
student calls for help brought aid
in minutes.

Stanford needs such a group of
capable and competent
professionals. Perhaps the Daily
might want to take up the call for
improved protection of the
members of this University
community. What could he more
fundamental than a student's right
to walk safely home from the
library at night? All personal and
property abuses cannot be
prevented, but many can be.
Don't let us slip back into our
forgetful fantasy that this campus
is a safe place until another
person, maybe our friend,
becomes the next widow,
widower or victim.

Insensitive Story
Editor:
Your story regarding the Arlis
Perry tragedy was an affront not
only to the victim's family and
friends but to the entire Stanford
community as well. I acknowledge
the press' responsibility to report
the. facts, but there would seem to
be a concomitant duty to exercise
discretion in expressing those
facts. The Daily's coverage
demonstrated an appalling lack of
such discretion and sensitbility.
While sensationalism is often used
to improve circulation, a
publication whose financial base is
not determined by its circulation
cannot avail itself of even that
poor excuse.
