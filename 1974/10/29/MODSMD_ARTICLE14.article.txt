## Hillel Offers Bagel Brunches, Services, Spiritual Solidarity 
### TERRI YAVITZ 
In the beginning, God created
the heaven and Hillel. Through
the ages, it has finally arrived on
the Stanford campus as a viable
and vital organization.
Since 12 percent of the
students are Jewish, there is some
obligation to delve into the
activities of this increasingly
prominent group. Curiosity leads
to the knowledge of how it all
began ... A bagels and lox
brunch.
These were created on an
every-other Sunday basis, and
were held at Bechtel International
Center. It came to pass that while
the Christian-folk were
conducting services on Sunday

morning, the Jewish-folk were
enjoying their brunch. It is their
belief that Friday is the eve of
Holy Sabbath, thus leaving
Sunday open to acitivitv.
After nourishing their bodies,
the Jewish-folk searched for
further fulfillment by
incorporating meaningful action
and social fun in a series of
ensuing events. A weekly
folk-dancing session developed
with a favorable turnout.
Not only could students,
professors and other members
learn to follow in the footsteps of
their ancestors, but also, for those
who had overindulged at the bagel
brunch, it proved to be an ideal
opportunity for normalizing
metabolisms.
In time, new dimensions of
activity emerged because the
participants of Hillel possessed a
variety of talents. Those with a
terrific set of vocal chords decided
to sidestep the others by
providing a culturally and
spiritually moving songfest, which
was consummated by a Havdalah
Service. This was generally held
on the break of Sabbath, Saturday
evening.
Holy Day Services .
It is important to mention the
service program because many are
still unaware that Hillel provides
for all of the High Holy Day
services, besides the weekly
"Shabbat" or Sabbath. Minor
holidays like* Sukkos
(Thanksgiving) and Simchas Torah
are also included.
In fact, Hillel has extended
its program to include
specialized performances for the
three secular divisions of Judaism.
These are the Orthodox, the most
traditional; the Conservative, who
are moderately strict; and the
Reform or Liberal sect. The
majority of Jewish students at
Stanford are Conservative or
Reform.
All major functions, including
educational courses such as
modern Hebrew. Yiddish, Jewish
literature and Jewish history are
handled by eight separate
committees which outline the
basic structure of this ethical
organization.

These include campus relations
(even council needs a good P.R.
agency), cultural affairs and
activities, education (acquiring
guest speakers, professors, film
series, and the above mentioned
courses), fund raising (the group is
backed by The National Hillel
Foundation and the Jewish
Welfare Federation; not the
ASSU), religious sendees,
publications (there are quarterly,
handouts of Aliyah and On One
Fool, besides a newsletter for
members), special events
(anything goes), and the futuristic
committee for establishing a
theme house.
In one of the council meetings,
a great debate on whether or not
to. install a Kosher kitchen
developed. Recall the
rationalization that you can't have
eggs before the chicken, nor a sink
before a kitchen; but least of all
can you have a Kosher kitchen
before a theme house.
Theme Discussion
The problem of the theme
house is in the discussion process.
There is no reason why Hillel
should be deprived of this
opportunity, many students
argue, since the University has
seen to it in the past that all
minority groups share this housing
freedom.
Other events and plans for the
future include the coming of a
new rabbi. The present rabbi has
turned in his resignation and
presently the Hillel group is in the
process of selecting a replacement
to begin active duty next fall.
Many students are hopeful that
this occurence will revitalize spirit
and "Jewish consciousness"
within the group, out of greater

guidance and better relations. This
in turn will clear the path for
members of Hillel to meet their
goals and objectives.
Clear Identification
Hillel members stress
emphatically that they would like
to see each member reach a more
clearly defined stage of
identification, so that when
someone asks them who they are
and what they stand for, they will
respond responsibly.
Social unification is their
second desire. Because the group's
members, are so stratified in
background and knowledge of
their religion, they are running
into foreseeable problems,
especially when trying to select
activities suitable for everyone.
On a long-term basis, Hillel
envisions beneficial ties with the
outside Jewish community the
Jewish mamas from Palo Alto
have already jumped into the
inner courtyard in White Plaza
every-other Wednesday afternoon
to fix yummy lunches in an effort
to help the group. Hillel would
also like to see a possible Jewish
studies program culminate into a
department of its own.
Naturally, patience is most
invaluable when striving to
achieve, any goal. The Hillel bunch
clearly displays an abundance of
that quality, along with the
perseverence and the will to attain
success and satisfaction in
knowing that positive proress will
result.
The Hillel Story, like The Old
Testament , will survive through its
strength of endeavor and reach
its pinnacle, just as Moses reached
the top of Mt. Sinai.

BOUNTIFUL BAGELSâ€”Bagels got the campus group known as Hillel, and here it can be seen that
members still enjoy Sunday brunch of bagels and lox together. Since its founding, Hillel has spread its
efforts to other spiritual and social endeavors.
