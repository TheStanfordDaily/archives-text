Where can you find a notary public on or near the campus specifically
to notarize absentee ballots? Also, which ones don't charge for their
services? —R.M.N.
Going to all the trouble of applying for an absentee ballot can be
futile if you can't get someone to notorize it. Therefore, a few notary
publics have been scattered throughout the University to serve the
students.
Office Assistant Yvette Sanphez in the Dean of Students Office,
room 323 in Old Union, wirfauthorize student ballots for free as long
as the voter brings two forms of I.D. generally a driver's license and
a student I.D. She is there from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the week.
Secretary Assistant Sara G. Stephenson in the Ombudsman's
Office, room 85 in building 80, will also notorize ballots for free from
8 to 5.
Marlene Wine, secretary in the President's Office, second floor of
building 10, charges $1 for all notary public duties unless they refer
strictly to University business. She is in her office from 9 to 6.
There is still another notary public in Bechtel International Center
but she only handles services for foreign students. Mary C. Clark,
administrative assistant at the I-Center, authorizes diplomas, car sales
and any other documents that a foreign student might need to have
signed.
Most of the heavily used bicycle paths (Palm Drive, Galvez and Serra
Streets) are disaster areas; they are full of pot holes, lumps, cracks and
bumps that are a real safety hazard. Is there any way of making life
more pleasant and safe for cyclists on these streets? —C.S.
Bicyclists are going to have to dodge those holes for quite a long
time, according to Plant Services Director Jason C. Mavis. Repaving
Serra and Galvez is "almost impossible," Mavis added, because of the
low budget for street and path maintenance.

The total annual budget for repaving streets, building bike paths
and ramps, installing stop signs and even painting lines is only
$61,743, according to Perry B. Hackett, environmental protection
services manager.
Hackett estimated reconstruction of the Serra path would cost
about $45,000 because the path is in such bad shape. "It's rotten to
the core," Mavis lamented. Probably a few cyclists feel that way about
the fund allocation procedure.
It seems ridiculous to a lot of people that the University spent so
much money redirecting Campus Drive when some of that asphalt
could have been used to repave one of the three "disaster areas."
However, Hackett emphasized that the money for that paving
which he conservatively estimated at $63,000, came from a different
department's budget construction instead of maintenance.
All is not lost, however. Hackett said he would immediately take
care of putting bike ramps on the north side of Serra if it's feasible, so
bicyclists could ride on the sidewalk. Ramps cost between $2O and
$l5O depending on how elaborate they are, he said.
He added he would "walk down and check out" Galvez Street to
see what he could do about filling some of those pot holes.
Mavis mentioned that Plant Services likes to save most of its funds
for "critical situations" such as broken mains.
Then when the contractors get around to fixing those crucial spots,
Mavis said he asks them to use the leftover asphalt to fill some of the
übiquitous pot holes.

care of putting bike ramps on the north side of Serra if it's feasible, so
bicyclists could ride on the sidewalk. Ramps cost between $2O and

Where can you find a notary public on or near the campus specifically
to notarize absentee ballots? Also, which ones don't charge for their
services? —R.M.N.
Going to all the trouble of applying for an absentee ballot can be
futile if you can't get someone to notorize it. Therefore, a few notary
publics have been scattered throughout the University to serve the
students.
Office Assistant Yvette Sanphez in the Dean of Students Office,
room 323 in Old Union, wirfauthorize student ballots for free as long
as the voter brings two forms of I.D. generally a driver's license and
a student I.D. She is there from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the week.
Secretary Assistant Sara G. Stephenson in the Ombudsman's
Office, room 85 in building 80, will also notorize ballots for free from
8 to 5.
Marlene Wine, secretary in the President's Office, second floor of
building 10, charges $1 for all notary public duties unless they refer
strictly to University business. She is in her office from 9 to 6.
There is still another notary public in Bechtel International Center
but she only handles services for foreign students. Mary C. Clark,
administrative assistant at the I-Center, authorizes diplomas, car sales
and any other documents that a foreign student might need to have
signed.
Most of the heavily used bicycle paths (Palm Drive, Galvez and Serra
Streets) are disaster areas; they are full of pot holes, lumps, cracks and
bumps that are a real safety hazard. Is there any way of making life
more pleasant and safe for cyclists on these streets? —C.S.
Bicyclists are going to have to dodge those holes for quite a long
time, according to Plant Services Director Jason C. Mavis. Repaving
Serra and Galvez is "almost impossible," Mavis added, because of the
low budget for street and path maintenance.

The total annual budget for repaving streets, building bike paths
and ramps, installing stop signs and even painting lines is only
$61,743, according to Perry B. Hackett, environmental protection
services manager.
Hackett estimated reconstruction of the Serra path would cost
about $45,000 because the path is in such bad shape. "It's rotten to
the core," Mavis lamented. Probably a few cyclists feel that way about
the fund allocation procedure.
It seems ridiculous to a lot of people that the University spent so
much money redirecting Campus Drive when some of that asphalt
could have been used to repave one of the three "disaster areas."
However, Hackett emphasized that the money for that paving
which he conservatively estimated at $63,000, came from a different
department's budget construction instead of maintenance.
