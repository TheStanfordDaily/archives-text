# University Establishes New Sabbatical Fund
## 
### 
A fund of $225,000 has been
established here to give tenured
faculty the opportunity to change
fields of concentration within
their general discipline, according
to Arthur Bienenstock, vice provost
for faculty affairs.
The three-year fund, the result
of a grant of $150,000 from the
Lilly Endowment, Inc., and
$75,000 from the Andrew Mellon
t Foundation, will be used to
supplement existing sabbatical
funds.
Under the terms of the grants,
five tenured faculty members per
year will be able to take a full
academic year sabbatical at full
salary for the intensive study
•equired to redirect their scholarly
nterest.
i "I really do think that faculty
nd students are the most
nportant people here," said
ienenstock. The new fund will
alp solve the problems imposed
/ current limitations on hiring of

new faculty members, he said.
In addition, Bienenstock said,
the opportunity is important for
faculty whose interests have
changed or whose field was of
considerable interest for an
extended period, but has since
become less important to the
individual and the University.
"We believe that new
mechanisms must be introduced
in order to anticipate needed
intellectual and educational
challenges in the next decade," he
said.
"The problem is most vividly
illustrated through an
examination of the School of
Engineering, although it is no less
important to other schools.
"The School has 146
professorial faculty, of whom
112, or 77 percent, have tenure 1 .
During the next five years, only
two will reach normal retirement
age. Thus, only a small number of
new appointments resulting from
departures of existing faculty can
be anticipated," he explained.
As new technologies arise, as
the full impact of the energy crisis
becomes apparent, he continued,
different areas of the School of
Engineering will probably need to
alter emphasis and faculty
numbers.
Faculty members who take
advantage of the program will be
able to take "leave from normal
responsibilities and have time to
study," he said. Humanists may
wish to stay here to use the
libraries, whereas "scientists are
more likely to go where the action
is."
All tenured faculty members
are eligible for the new program.
Applications should be made with
normal applications for sabbatical
leave with supplementary
statements from the department.
Applications for the 1975-76
academic year should be
forwarded to the provost by Jan.
31. Award notices will be sent to
faculty members, department
chairpersons and deans by March
15.

A fund of $225,000 has been
established here to give tenured
faculty the opportunity to change
fields of concentration within
their general discipline, according
to Arthur Bienenstock, vice provost
for faculty affairs.
The three-year fund, the result
of a grant of $150,000 from the
Lilly Endowment, Inc., and
$75,000 from the Andrew Mellon
t Foundation, will be used to
supplement existing sabbatical
funds.
Under the terms of the grants,
five tenured faculty members per
year will be able to take a full
academic year sabbatical at full
salary for the intensive study
•equired to redirect their scholarly
nterest.
i "I really do think that faculty
nd students are the most
nportant people here," said
ienenstock. The new fund will
alp solve the problems imposed
/ current limitations on hiring of

new faculty members, he said.
In addition, Bienenstock said,
the opportunity is important for
faculty whose interests have
changed or whose field was of
considerable interest for an
extended period, but has since
become less important to the
individual and the University.
"We believe that new
mechanisms must be introduced
in order to anticipate needed
intellectual and educational
challenges in the next decade," he
said.
"The problem is most vividly
illustrated through an
examination of the School of
Engineering, although it is no less
important to other schools.
"The School has 146
professorial faculty, of whom
112, or 77 percent, have tenure 1 .
During the next five years, only
two will reach normal retirement
age. Thus, only a small number of
new appointments resulting from
departures of existing faculty can
be anticipated," he explained.
As new technologies arise, as
the full impact of the energy crisis
becomes apparent, he continued,
different areas of the School of
Engineering will probably need to
alter emphasis and faculty
numbers.
Faculty members who take
advantage of the program will be
able to take "leave from normal
responsibilities and have time to
study," he said. Humanists may
wish to stay here to use the
libraries, whereas "scientists are
more likely to go where the action
is."
All tenured faculty members
are eligible for the new program.
Applications should be made with
normal applications for sabbatical
leave with supplementary
statements from the department.
