# Dorm Housing Limited During Winter Break
## 
### JOHN FREED 
All but eight dormitories will be
closed this year over winter break,
which will probably force some
students to move into different
on-campus housing if they plan to stay
during vacation.
The houses to remain open are
Crothers, Crothers Memorial,
Manzanita Park, Mirrielees, Hulme,
Blackwelder, McFarland and one co-op
house to be announced later.

Closing of the dorms last year was
originally planned to be a trade-off
between energy savings and student
inconvenience, according to David
Bell, assistant dean of student affairs.
But inconvenience did not occur last
year, he added. Hence, the reshuffling
of students served only to further the
goal of saving fuel.
"It was to our advantage last year
to reduce consumption of fuel during
winter break," Bell noted. Last year,
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E)
notified the University to expect seven
days without natural gas for operating
the Steam Plant.
Further Cancellation
This year, however, PG&E has told
the University to expect 21 days
without gas energy. Jason Mavis,
director of Plant Services, says the
University may only have enough
reserve oil to power the Steam Plant
for 15 days.
"Right now, we have 240,000
gallons of oil, with 300,000 additional
gallons ordered. I estimate that the
combined 540,000 gallons represent a
maximum of about 15 days" of
power, Mavis explained.
Before last year's closing there was
a chorus of complaints, according to
Bell. But Bell says he has yet to receive
a single substantive complaint since
the closing.
'No Negative Comments'
"There have been no negative
comments that I know of about the
closing, at least after the closing
occured," Bell commented. He added
that only 77 persons were actually
moved over the break into the eight
available dorms.
"Outside of the eight open dorms,
we had 180 petitions for people
wishing to remain on campus during
the break. We assigned 103 of them,
the rest dropping out for various
reasons. Of the 103, only 77 actually
picked up their keys," Bell remarked.
He explained that last year's system
provided a minimum of red tape, and
that the same system will be tried
again this year.

"As long as we have a system that
relies on good will and can be done
with a minimum of bureaucracy, I
don't see any reason why we should go
to something more complex," Bell
said.
Savings
Mavis estimated that Plant Services
saved about $B4OO worth of oil in last
year's vacation period. However, he
noted, the cost of oil has skyrocketed
from 17 cents to 41 cents a gallon.
Bell explained the impact of the price
rise. ,
"On a proportional basis, our
savings in fuel costs would rise from
around $B4OO to around $21,000,"
Bell figured. "This works out to more
than $4 per student. Considering that
room rates went from $6OO to $630
this year, a four or five-dollar savings is
a substantial savings."
The situation for upcoming winters
also looks bleak. PG&E has told
the University to expect at least a
month without natural gas next
winter, with possibly longer periods in
future years.

This year, however, PG&E has told
the University to expect 21 days
without gas energy. Jason Mavis,
director of Plant Services, says the
University may only have enough
reserve oil to power the Steam Plant
for 15 days.
"Right now, we have 240,000
gallons of oil, with 300,000 additional
gallons ordered. I estimate that the
combined 540,000 gallons represent a
maximum of about 15 days" of
power, Mavis explained.
Before last year's closing there was
a chorus of complaints, according to
Bell. But Bell says he has yet to receive
a single substantive complaint since
the closing.
'No Negative Comments'
"There have been no negative
comments that I know of about the
closing, at least after the closing
occured," Bell commented. He added
that only 77 persons were actually
moved over the break into the eight
available dorms.
"Outside of the eight open dorms,
we had 180 petitions for people
wishing to remain on campus during
the break. We assigned 103 of them,
the rest dropping out for various
reasons. Of the 103, only 77 actually
picked up their keys," Bell remarked.
He explained that last year's system
provided a minimum of red tape, and
that the same system will be tried
again this year.

"As long as we have a system that
relies on good will and can be done
with a minimum of bureaucracy, I
don't see any reason why we should go
to something more complex," Bell
said.
Savings
Mavis estimated that Plant Services
saved about $B4OO worth of oil in last
year's vacation period. However, he
noted, the cost of oil has skyrocketed
from 17 cents to 41 cents a gallon.
Bell explained the impact of the price
rise. ,
"On a proportional basis, our
savings in fuel costs would rise from
around $B4OO to around $21,000,"
Bell figured. "This works out to more
than $4 per student. Considering that
room rates went from $6OO to $630
this year, a four or five-dollar savings is
a substantial savings."
The situation for upcoming winters
also looks bleak. PG&E has told
the University to expect at least a
month without natural gas next
winter, with possibly longer periods in
future years.
All but eight dormitories will be
closed this year over winter break,
which will probably force some
students to move into different
on-campus housing if they plan to stay
during vacation.
The houses to remain open are
Crothers, Crothers Memorial,
Manzanita Park, Mirrielees, Hulme,
Blackwelder, McFarland and one co-op
house to be announced later.

Closing of the dorms last year was
originally planned to be a trade-off
between energy savings and student
inconvenience, according to David
Bell, assistant dean of student affairs.
But inconvenience did not occur last
year, he added. Hence, the reshuffling
of students served only to further the
goal of saving fuel.
"It was to our advantage last year
to reduce consumption of fuel during
winter break," Bell noted. Last year,
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E)
notified the University to expect seven
days without natural gas for operating
the Steam Plant.
Further Cancellation

the University to expect 21 days

director of Plant Services, says the
