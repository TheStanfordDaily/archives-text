# P.A. Volunteer Bureau Seeks Community Aid
## 
### MELISSA BAUMANN 
A young man with shaggy
blonde hair, dressed in a white
cowboy shirt and in
the lobby of the Palo Alto
Volunteer Bureau.
"Are you a new volunteer or
have you worked here before?" he
is asked.
He hesitates before he answers,
grinning: "No, neither, I've been
arrested."
Conviction of petty theft is not
a prerequisite for work with the
Volunteer Bureau-Voluntary
Action Center, a clearing house for
volunteer jobs, at 460 California
Ave., Palo Alto.
Referral Program
The bureau's Court Referral
Program, a rehabilitation program
supported by the county that
assigns , 40 hours of volunteer
work rather than a punitive
sentence, is the newest of the
bureau's many volunteer
programs.
The Volunteer Bureau has
served northern Santa Clara
County since 1959, under the
aegis of the United Fund.
Executive Director Mildred M.
Silver, who joined the bureau
seven years ago, describes the
"delicate position" the bureau
seeks to maintain: catering
equally to its 2500 volunteers and
197 volunteer agencies.
Choosing from students,
housewives, businessmen, civic or
social groups and retired persons,
the bureau places 95 percent of its
applicants as volunteers in
schools, libraries, hospitals,
mental helath programs, social
agency offices and recreation
programs.
'Uplift'
Silver says she and her six
staff members "don't do many
pressure sellings." Instead, they
respect the volunteers' personal
interests and attempt to assign
jobs that will "give them some
uplift."

Silver adds she does not frown
upon- those who do volunteer

work to satisfy their social
conscience. "Altruism is a
delusion," she says, and she
appreciates volunteers who are
"aware of their motivations."
Her enthusiasm indicates that
people from the "tptal
socio-economic scope" can and do
find satisfaction serving the
community through the
Volunteer Bureau. Although the
bulk of volunteers are students
and middle-aged housewives,
full-salaried businessmen and 90-
year-olds are getting into the act.
Until a few years ago, "male
volunteers were practically
unheard of," Silver said. Elderly
people were considered the
recipients rather.; than the
initiators of volunteer service.
RSVP
For the past two years,
however, RSVP, the Retired
Senior Volunteer Program, has
given senior the chance to
get constructively involved in the
community.
RSVP is the Volunteer
Bureau's innovation, though it is
funded by ACTION, an arm of
the federal government. Silver
feels RSVP's purpose is "to reach
the isolate,"' the lonely, elderly
person with too much time to
himself.
Silver cited the case of an
woman, a
lab-technician in her youth, who
volunteers at the Palo Alto
Medical Research Center. But
what about young Stanford
pre-meds? Do any Stanford
students volunteer?
Silver replied that volunteers
from Stanford are mainly
University employees. She grants
students their academic priorities,
but shares the sentiments of the
86-year-old lab-assistant: perhaps
the Volunteer Bureau "should be
sending those college kids down
there."

Silver also notes that by giving
time, the Stanford students might
be able to pick up some academic
credit.
