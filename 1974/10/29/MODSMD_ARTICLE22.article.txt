## Senegal Show A Great Surprise 
### CHRISTINE SHERRY 
Located on the western-most
tip of Africa, Senegal is a land of
trade; its capital city, Dakar, is the
busiest harbor and airport of the
entire west African coast. The
majority of the Senegalese people
are farmers, and its principal
artisans are weavers and jewelers.
But certainly the country's
most beautiful cultural
representatives must be the
National Dance Company, a
troupe of unabashed performers
with a ready alertness and a vital
energy not often seen in the
United States.
Their Friday evening
performance at Memorial

Auditorium was simply fantastic;
the company has discipline and
artistic restraint yet managed to
wow even the typically blase
Stanford audience with their
confidence, enthusiasm and
unpretentious flair.
One of the most delightful
aspects of -the evening's
performance was the intelligent
balance of the program; dances of
the Fields, of harvest celebrations
and of fertility rites were
interspersed with captivating
musical interludes featuring
traditional Senegalese folk
instruments such as the
twenty-one string Cora and the
piano-like Balafor. (Costumes—or

lack thereof!) were exquisitely
chosen, brightly colored yet not
overbearing in opulence.
Movement was earthy,
grounded, sometimes with an
almost crude texture, and the
quality of motion at first seemed
strange to an American eye used
to viewing great technical
brilliance in the visual lines of
modern or ballet aesthetics.
Yet, as the dances flowed on,
one began to appreciate more and
more the lovely fluidity of the
shoulders and backs, the prevision
and the co-ordination of the
seemingly simple footwork.
And despite the abundance of
action onstage at any one moment

(sometimes frustrating to the
uninitiated observer who tries
frantically to take it all in
simultaneously) the individual
movements were simple,
economical and uncluttered.
To single out highlights of the
program would be nearly
impossible; the excellent acrobatic
stunts of the nomadic Foulas of
Oriental Senegal were at least
matched by the amazing human
haystack in Koumpo , a
celebration of a harvest festival.
No doubt the most awesome
performance was that of the stilt
dancers in Diankey Wali , a story
of revenge and exorcism. Moving
with an eerie and profoundly
distrubing grace, the men seemed
more godlike than human in their
weirdly disjointed walks and
stretches.
The National Dance Company
of Senegal puts on a wonderful
evening's entertainment. Unlike
many ethnic dance groups who
are so frankly theatrical, the
company has the sense to
understate their showmanship,
though they are willing
performers.

Proud of their heritage the
dancers are obviously personally
involved and happy with what
they are doing, and the images of
those bold, healthy, loose limbs
nursue one long after the drums
have quieted.

majority of the Senegalese people
are farmers, and its principal
artisans are weavers and jewelers.
But certainly the country's
most beautiful cultural
representatives must be the
National Dance Company, a
troupe of unabashed performers
with a ready alertness and a vital
energy not often seen in the
United States.
Their Friday evening
performance at Memorial

Auditorium was simply fantastic;
the company has discipline and
artistic restraint yet managed to
wow even the typically blase
Stanford audience with their
confidence, enthusiasm and
unpretentious flair.
One of the most delightful
aspects of -the evening's
performance was the intelligent
balance of the program; dances of
the Fields, of harvest celebrations
and of fertility rites were
interspersed with captivating
musical interludes featuring
traditional Senegalese folk
instruments such as the
twenty-one string Cora and the
piano-like Balafor. (Costumes—or

lack thereof!) were exquisitely
chosen, brightly colored yet not
overbearing in opulence.
Movement was earthy,
grounded, sometimes with an
almost crude texture, and the
quality of motion at first seemed
strange to an American eye used
to viewing great technical
brilliance in the visual lines of
modern or ballet aesthetics.
Yet, as the dances flowed on,
one began to appreciate more and
more the lovely fluidity of the
shoulders and backs, the prevision
and the co-ordination of the
seemingly simple footwork.
And despite the abundance of
action onstage at any one moment

(sometimes frustrating to the
uninitiated observer who tries
frantically to take it all in
simultaneously) the individual
movements were simple,
economical and uncluttered.
To single out highlights of the
program would be nearly
impossible; the excellent acrobatic
stunts of the nomadic Foulas of
Oriental Senegal were at least
matched by the amazing human
haystack in Koumpo , a
celebration of a harvest festival.
No doubt the most awesome
performance was that of the stilt
dancers in Diankey Wali , a story
of revenge and exorcism. Moving
with an eerie and profoundly
distrubing grace, the men seemed
more godlike than human in their
weirdly disjointed walks and
stretches.
The National Dance Company
of Senegal puts on a wonderful
evening's entertainment. Unlike
many ethnic dance groups who
are so frankly theatrical, the
company has the sense to
understate their showmanship,
though they are willing
performers.

Proud of their heritage the
dancers are obviously personally
involved and happy with what
they are doing, and the images of
those bold, healthy, loose limbs
nursue one long after the drums
have quieted.
