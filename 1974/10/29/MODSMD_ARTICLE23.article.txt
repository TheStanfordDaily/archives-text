# Recreated Broadway Play Makes Good Show In S.F.
## By TERRI YAVITZ 
### 
Sugar was spice and everything nice! Sound like
a magical fantasy? In essence, the Curran Theatre's
opening night performance of Sugar, a musical
comedy based on Billy Wilder's screenplay, Some
Like It Hot and recreated from David Merrick's
Broadway hit of last year, was just that.
Sugar, produced by Edward Lester in this year's
version, was a tantalizing tale bordering on the
ridiculous which delighted the audience with
miracles of plot, and reversed the cynics' spirit, so
as to enable all to become completely enchanted
with this endearing comic sketch.
How could this silly musical have been so
successful? Popularity is generally enhanced when
an audience is allowed to participate in the fun.
Impersonation was the key to this comedy as
Robert Morse and Larry Kert portrayed musicians,
who, out of necessity, joined a female band to
escape gangster vengeance. -
Audience Participation

However, the twist to this typical "cat and
mouse" chase, was that while Jerry and Joe (Morse
and Kert) were deceiving everyone around them,
the audience was let in on the charade. This
naturally led to heightened anxiety, and it was not
uncommon to hear belts of laughter coming from
the hysterical audience.

Besides a remarkable plot and great audience
reception, the fine acting and casting supplemented
the ease with which the story unfolded. Along with
the two leads, we were reintroduced to Gale
Gordon (who most would recognize as Mr. Mooney
on the "I Love Lucy" series).

He mastered a terrific characterization of a
wealthy, loveable, naughty old man, Osgood
Fielding, Jr., who fell in love with Morse (alias the
indescribable Daphne .. . Wow! Was he/she a
charmer!).
Fanatical Devotion
Osgood was, in fact so much in love that he
dismissed the fact that Daphne wore a wig,
couldn't have children and, upon final revelation,
was a man. Osgood simply consummated the tale
by casually stating, "Nobody's perfect!"
Leland Palmer, actress-singer, took the role of
Sugar, for whom the action focused around. This
was the role originally played by Marilyn Monroe,
and most popularly remembered for her seductive
scenes.
Palmer's dancing and body movements were a

constant distraction from whatever else was
happening.
Spats Taps
Snazzy tap dancing was displayed by Steve
Condon, who portrayed Spats Palazzo, boss of the
"dirty rats" and responsible for the St. Valentine's
Day Massacre. His role was too contrived as he
replaced words and emotional expression with a
heel-toe click-turn-slide.
After zeroing in on the two impersonators, it
was obvious where the crux of humor lay. Kert, the
dashing lead in such spectacular musicals as
Company and Two Gentlemen of Verona,
quickchanged from Josephine, the female sax
player, into Junior, the wealthy heir to the Shell
Oil Company, in order to capture the heart of
Sugar.
Successful Gambit
His double-crossing gambit worked and they fell
in love. Morse, a highly acclaimed actor for his roles
in How to Succeed in Business Without Really
Trying and A Guide for the Married Man, was
flitting across stage as the delirious Daphne,
catching blown kisses from the infatuated Osgood.
Morse was so remarkably believable with his
impersonation that David Bowie and Lou Reed
would have been left speechless.
All aspects of technical theatre, i.e., costumes,
staging, lighting, makeup, music, singing and
choreography were not exceptionally rousing, on
the other hand, they were not merely mediocre.
Granted, the plot and acting were the strong points,
but the other entities of the musical blended in
nicely, complimenting the strengths.
Set Design
There were two outstanding sets designed by
Robin Wagner of Hair, J.C. Superstar, and currently
Mack and Mable. He proved his knack for
originality with his rendition of the well-equipped
inside of a passenger train, and the creation of the
Seminole-Ritz Terrace, hangout for the ""naughty
old men."
The music by Jule Styne and Robert Merril was
disappointing. Plus, the dialogue was in need for
more succinct expression; and timing was slightly
off. However, I'm not one to argue with overall
success.
I stopped counting after three curtain calls.
Robert Morse and the rest of the cast apparently
enjoyed themselves just as much; they applauded as
well. Undoubtedly, the audience's
performance in participation was equally well done.

Sugar, for whom the action focused around. This
was the role originally played by Marilyn Monroe,
and most popularly remembered for her seductive
scenes.
Palmer's dancing and body movements were a

constant distraction from whatever else was
happening.
Spats Taps
Snazzy tap dancing was displayed by Steve
Condon, who portrayed Spats Palazzo, boss of the
"dirty rats" and responsible for the St. Valentine's
Day Massacre. His role was too contrived as he
replaced words and emotional expression with a
heel-toe click-turn-slide.
After zeroing in on the two impersonators, it
was obvious where the crux of humor lay. Kert, the
dashing lead in such spectacular musicals as
Company and Two Gentlemen of Verona,
quickchanged from Josephine, the female sax
player, into Junior, the wealthy heir to the Shell
Oil Company, in order to capture the heart of
Sugar.
Successful Gambit
His double-crossing gambit worked and they fell
in love. Morse, a highly acclaimed actor for his roles
in How to Succeed in Business Without Really
Trying and A Guide for the Married Man, was
flitting across stage as the delirious Daphne,
catching blown kisses from the infatuated Osgood.
Morse was so remarkably believable with his
impersonation that David Bowie and Lou Reed
would have been left speechless.
All aspects of technical theatre, i.e., costumes,
staging, lighting, makeup, music, singing and
choreography were not exceptionally rousing, on
the other hand, they were not merely mediocre.
Granted, the plot and acting were the strong points,
but the other entities of the musical blended in
nicely, complimenting the strengths.
Set Design
There were two outstanding sets designed by
Robin Wagner of Hair, J.C. Superstar, and currently
Mack and Mable. He proved his knack for
originality with his rendition of the well-equipped
inside of a passenger train, and the creation of the
Seminole-Ritz Terrace, hangout for the ""naughty
old men."
The music by Jule Styne and Robert Merril was
disappointing. Plus, the dialogue was in need for
more succinct expression; and timing was slightly
off. However, I'm not one to argue with overall
success.
I stopped counting after three curtain calls.
Robert Morse and the rest of the cast apparently
enjoyed themselves just as much; they applauded as
well. Undoubtedly, the audience's
performance in participation was equally well done.
Sugar was spice and everything nice! Sound like
a magical fantasy? In essence, the Curran Theatre's
opening night performance of Sugar, a musical
comedy based on Billy Wilder's screenplay, Some
Like It Hot and recreated from David Merrick's
Broadway hit of last year, was just that.
Sugar, produced by Edward Lester in this year's
version, was a tantalizing tale bordering on the
ridiculous which delighted the audience with
miracles of plot, and reversed the cynics' spirit, so
as to enable all to become completely enchanted
with this endearing comic sketch.
How could this silly musical have been so
successful? Popularity is generally enhanced when
an audience is allowed to participate in the fun.
Impersonation was the key to this comedy as
Robert Morse and Larry Kert portrayed musicians,
who, out of necessity, joined a female band to
escape gangster vengeance. -
Audience Participation

However, the twist to this typical "cat and
mouse" chase, was that while Jerry and Joe (Morse
and Kert) were deceiving everyone around them,
the audience was let in on the charade. This
naturally led to heightened anxiety, and it was not
uncommon to hear belts of laughter coming from
the hysterical audience.

Besides a remarkable plot and great audience
reception, the fine acting and casting supplemented
the ease with which the story unfolded. Along with
the two leads, we were reintroduced to Gale
Gordon (who most would recognize as Mr. Mooney
on the "I Love Lucy" series).

He mastered a terrific characterization of a
wealthy, loveable, naughty old man, Osgood
Fielding, Jr., who fell in love with Morse (alias the
indescribable Daphne .. . Wow! Was he/she a
charmer!).
Fanatical Devotion
Osgood was, in fact so much in love that he
dismissed the fact that Daphne wore a wig,
couldn't have children and, upon final revelation,
was a man. Osgood simply consummated the tale
by casually stating, "Nobody's perfect!"
Leland Palmer, actress-singer, took the role of
Sugar, for whom the action focused around. This

and most popularly remembered for her seductive
scenes.
