# Buffett Provides Musical Relief
## 
### BARBARA LANE 
"I never was made for glitter,
rock and roll" confesses Jimmy
Buffett in "Come Monday,"
ironically his only song to make
the Top Twenty hit parade. It's a
good thing, too. In a day when
one's musical discrimination is
numbed by the theatrics of the
"Superstar" phenomenon, Jimmy
Buffett's relaxed Country and
Western sound provides a
welcome and refreshing relief.
Irreverently witty, Buffett
charmed the Boarding House
audience last week with a totally
delightful show. Spontaneous
humor has become a rare
commodity in musical acts. I
remember seeing Arlo Guthrie on
two successive nights tell the
exact same "impromptu"
anecdotes with precision timing.

Buffett draws on his boyhood
in the South for much of his
material, and every song tells a
story. In "Peanut Butter
Conspiracy," he recalls the trails
of a hungry group of hard-luck
musicians:

Who's gonna steal the peanut
butter?
I'll get a can of sardines.
Runnin' up and down the aisle
of the Mini-Mart
Stickin food in our jeans.
"Grapefruit-Juicy Fruit" looks
back on "those agonizing nights at
the auto show in Mobile,
Alabama:

Drive In
Guzzle Gin
Commit a little mortal sin
It s good for the soul.
Many of Buffett's songs poke
fun at an America we shared in
and remember, when Sky King
was everybody's hero and "only
jazz musicians were smokin'
marijuana." "Pencil Thin
Mustache" describes a familiar
era ... "Bandstand, Disneyland,
growin' up fast and we're drinkin'
on a fake 1.D."
Nor does contemporary
America escape Buffett's grinning
ridicule. One of his new songs
dedicated to Monty Hall, is
entitled "My Whole World Lies

Waiting Behind Door Number
Three."
The Coral Reefers Band,
consisting totally of Roger
Bartlett on lead acoustic guitar,
provides fine accompaniment to
Buffett's songs, as well as skillful
vocal harmony. The two man
operation itself becomes the
target of Buffett's humor in one
of his best foot stomping songs,
"If I Had A Saxaphone," in which
he laments the lack of recognition
from his hometown DJ.
Buffett's versatility is evident
in his slower, more reflective
songs. Outstanding among these
are "He Went To Paris," the story
of an 86 year old painter down in
New Orleans, and "Death Of An
Unpopular Poet," dedicated to
Kenneth Patchen.
Responsive to his audience,

Buffett is well suited to the
intimate small club scene. Many
songs contain refrains which
become familiar after several
repetitions, and few can resist the
urge to join in and sing along, feet

tapping to the country rhythm.
The Boarding House
engagement was Jimmy Buffett's
first club appearance in the Bay
Area. Hopefully he'll return soon',
and often.
