## TV Trivia 
### George Dobbins 
Television is now 26 years old
and with the way we rave and
rant, you probably don't even
believe that we appreciate that
fact. But indeed we do. And just
to prove that, this week we are
going to shut up and let you do
the talking.
This trivia quiz is intended to
provoke discussion and to show
that, yes, some TV programs are
memorable, whether it be for
their excellence or their
ridiculousness.
A score of five or less means
you are an average Stanford
student; you watch very little
television. If you score between
five and 10, you are a dimestore
viewer; you shop around and look
for the best bargains.
Anything between 10 and 15
means you're not the true
intellectual you profess to be. If
you get a perfect score, come into
the Daily and leave us your name;
then, when they take this reviewer
to the home, the column is yours.

ON YOUR MARK, GET SET,
