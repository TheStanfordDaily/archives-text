Hunt Admits Lying To Grand Jury
WASHINGTON Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt Jr. admitted yesterday he lied at least
12 times in appearances before a grand jury. But he
said that after reading transcripts of the White.
House tapes he decided to tell all he knew about the
break-in.
Testifying at the Watergate cover-up trial, Hunt
said, "In the spring of this year I began to read
transcripts of the White House tapes. I felt a sense
of rude awakening.
"I realized these men were not worthy of my
continued loyalty."
The former CIA agent who was convicted of
burglary, conspiracy and wiretapping in the
Watergate break-in trial, said that when he was
subpoenaed this past summer to testify again, he
was "faced with the hard decision of whether to
continue to lie to protect others or to tell all."
He said his attorneys advised him to tell
everything he knew.
Under questioning by Assistant Special
Prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste, Hunt admitted
that he had lied at least 12 times since granted
immunity from prosecution on the basis of his
testimony before a federal grand jury.
He said he lied about his contacts with former
White House special counsel Charles Colson and
fellow break-in defendant James McCord as well as
about his knowledge of the involvement of others in
the Watergate break-in.
Defense attorneys will begin their
cross-examination of Hunt today.
When he leaves the stand, the prosecution plans
to call Jeb Stuart Magruder, former deputy director
of the Nixon re eleftion committee, as its next
witness.
Rockefeller Discloses Loans
NEW YORK - Nelson A. Rockefeller reported
yesterday that he loaned $507,656 to his family,
friends and close associates during the past 17 years.
They still owe him $147,733, the
multimillionaire disclosed, including $12,500 loan
he made her Oct. 1, 1973.
Mrs. Rockefeller has her own income from a
trust set up at the time of her marriage to the
former governor and reported to total $69 million.
The new list was sent to the congressional
committees which will hold confirmation hearings.
Covering letters to Chairman Howard W. Cannon
(D-Nev.) of the Senate Committee on Rules and
Administration and Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr.
(D-N.J.)of the House Committee on the Judiciary
said the new list supplemented but did not duplicate
the earlier one.

Hugh Morrow, Rockefeller's spokesman, said he
doubted if the new list was very newsworthy.
"There's nothing controversial in it," he said. "You
got that with the first one."

Morrow referred to a list detailing loans and gifts
of nearly $1 million to public officials who worked
for him. It showed, among other sums, $625,000 to
Dr. William Ronan, now chairman of the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, and
$50,000 to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
The largest loan on the new list was $84,000 to
Robert B. Anderson made in two installments in
1957 before Anderson became secretary of the
treasury.
Kissinger Warns India Of Perils
NEW DELHI, India - Henry A. Kissinger
lectured India, the newest member of the atomic
club, on the perils of nuclear proliferation, then
promised yesterday to help the hungry nation
without interfering politically.
The speech to the Indian Council on World
Affairs capped a busy day of reconciliation with
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government. The
American secretary of state also signed an
agreement to set up a joint commission for
cooperation in education, science and culture.
Gandhi suggested" in an interview published just
hours before Kissinger arrived that the United States

has only a marginal interest in India.
But she said yesterday at a brief news
conference: "With any two countries, any two
individuals, things go up and down, but over-all
relations with the United States are good." Sitting
beside her, Kissinger interjected: "I agree with that
completely. Relations are on the way up."
In his speech, Kissinger acknowledged that
relations between the world's two largest
democracies have tended "to oscillate between high
expectations and deep suspicion."
The low point was in 1971, during the
India-Pakistan war, and Kissinger said: "We faced
these differences candidly. That crisis is now behind
us."
His audience of businessmen, professionals and
intellectuals interrupted the secretary several times
with applause. But about 70 young persons outside
shouted "Kissinger, go back" and waved their fists
as he arrived and left the auditorium.
IRA Blast Kills Two Soldiers
BELFAST, Northern Ireland A bomb planted
in a delivery van exploded yesterday outside a
British army recreation center, killing two soldiers
and injuring 35 persons.
A branch of the Irish Republican Army's
Provisional wing claimed responsibility for the blast,
which destroyed the recreation building near the
entrance of Ballykinler army camp 20 miles from
Belfast.
No warning was given. The van, packed with
about 300 pounds of explosives, blew up as soldiers
crowded into the building for their midmorning
break. About 100 persons, including soldiers' wives
and children, were in the center.
The explosion was followed by a fire that swept
through the building. The blast blew out windows
of a school 200 yards away, showering children with
glass. But a teacher said nobody was hurt.
The Provisional IRA statement said the attack
was a reprisal for the shooting two weeks ago of
Martin Hughes, 17, in Newry. The army said at the
time Hughes was shot by soldiers as he tried to
hijack a vehicle at gunpoint.
The Roman Catholic-based IRA is waging a
guerrilla war to end the British presence in Northern
Ireland and force unification of the province with
the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic.
The killings raised the army death toll in
Northern Ireland this year to 19. A total of 1,085
persons are known to have died in the province
since the current troubles began in 1969.
FEA To Tighten Controls On Oil
WASHINGTON - The Federal Energy
Administration (FEA) adopted regulations
yesterday to prevent international oil companies
from dodging U.S. oil price controls.
FEA administrator John C. Sawhill said some
companies may have been overcharging U.S.
consumers for their imported oil and if so, they will
have to roll back product prices to repay the public.
The regulation applies to prices charged since
October 1973.
Sawhill said that FEA has no clear information
or estimates so far on the extent of overcharging.
The regulations establish limits on "transfer
prices" paid between international affiliates of the
same company.
Since October 1973, under U.S. price controls,
oil companies could pass through the costs of
foreign oil in their domestic product prices.
But Sawhill said some companies apparently
tried to get around that rule and overcharge U.S.
consumers by manipulating transactions between
their own affiliates.
A foreign affiliate could sell oil at an inflated
price, substantially higher than it charged other
purchasers, to its own parent company's U.S.
affiliate.
The U.S. affiliate would then report that inflated
price as its cost, justifying a higher domestic price
for jts products.
The inflated foreign price, however, would swell
the parent company's profits, circumventing U.S.

price controls.
Sawhill said any such overcharges made since
October 1973 will have to be returned to the public.
Patty Hearst's Parents Reject Offer
SAN FRANCISCO Patricia Hearst's parents
turned down former gangster Mickey Cohen's offer
to help return their daughter because they feared
she might be harmed in the process, their attorney
said yesterday.
Lawyer James Maelnnis, who went with
Randolph and Catherine Hearst to meet with Cohen
in Los Angeles Oct. 7 said he had called Cohen a
week ago on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Hearst to turn
down the offer.
Hearst said on Friday that Cohen had proposed,
in effect, "to kidnap her from wherever she is now,"
and added "that isn't the way we want her brought
back."
"They decided it would be too dangerous and
they didn't want their own efforts to contact their
daughter to end in some harm to her," said
Maelnnis.
Cohen said over the weekend that Patricia Hearst
and her fellow Symbionese Liberation Army
fugitives had been living until 13 or 14 days ago in
the black community in Cleveland, Ohio, but that
he didn't know their present whereabouts.
Arabs Recognize Palestinian Group
RABAT,Morocco Arab leaders gave full
recognition to Yasir Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization as the "sole legitimate representative
of the Palestinian people" but left Jordan's King
Hussein a voice in Palestinians' future.
The move yesterday followed an apparent
reconciliation between Hussein and PLO chief Yasir
Arafat. Their conflict had threatened the Arab
summit with failure.
The resolution adopted by consensus late
yesterday said the summit "reaffirms the rights of
the Palestinian people to set up an independent
national authority, under the leadership of the PLO
as the sole legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people on any Palestinian land that is
liberated. Arab countries must support this
authority when it is established in all fields and at
all levels."

Earlier, Arab oil ministers discussed possible use
of the oil weapon and how to unify strategy against
threats from oil consuming nations.
The Moroccan news agency gave no details of the
ministers' meeting but officials said the "threats"
included recent statements by President Ford and
Secretary of State Kissinger that the major oil
consumers regard the continued flow of Arab oil a
vital national interest.
Ali, Foreman To Fight Tonight
KINSHASA, Zaire The richest and, perhaps,
strangest heavyweight title fight ever matches two
black Americans tonight in an African nation
seeking to showcase itself as proof that black men
on this continent are in firm control of their
destiny.
The Zaire government of Mobutu Sese Seko is
staging the meeting between challenger Muhammad
Ali and champion George Foreman to show'it has
arrived as a full-fledged nation from its civil
war-torn days when it was the Belgian Congo,
Each fighter is to receive a record $5 million for
the match that once was billed as a $5O million
extravagailza. But problems caused at least partially
by the postponement have prompted one
prestigious U.S. accounting firm hired by the
government to estimate the fight will gross less than
$l9 million. That would still be enough to make
most of the promoters a profit.
Today's Weather
Fair today and tomorrow. Warmer tomorrow.
Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today upper 50s to
mid 60s and tomorrow in 60s to low 70s.
