# City Council Adopts New Building Rules

### PHILIP FEDER 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night voted to reduce density limits in
"some non-residential zones" and
required that any building expansion
in such zones be "balanced by
transportation development."
Programs within each new company
entering Palo Alto or payments from
the company to finance transit services
will provide the transportation
balance, according to the City Council's
proposal. However, public agencies
such as the Santa Clara County Transit
District can also provide the necessary
balance.

The immediate effect on density in
the Stanford Industrial Park is not yet
known. University Land Resources
Manager John Breedlove opposed the
council's action.

"We want the density to remain the
same [in the Stanford Industrial
Park |. The University and the city
have cooperated to apply fixed
standards of low density zoning,"
Breedlove said.

The density in the Stanford
Industrial Park is lower than the limits
set by the city, according to
Breedlove.
Councilwoman Enid Pearson said
that if Stanford is already responding
to density limitations, then "they

should support the concept we [the
Council) propose."
"Palo Alto is a unique city but we
are too popular. The continually
expanding industry is seen as harmful
to Palo Alto residents," Pearson said.
Breedlove also objected to the
transportation option. "It [the
option] would unfairly penalize the
groups involved. It is unwise and
unfair to place the cost [of
transportation] on new and growing
industries," he said.

A spokesman for the Stanford
Industrial Park, Boyd Smith, said the
transportation assessment would "put
adverse limitations on the tenants [pf
the industrial park]. It is known as the
highest class area for an industry and
as the highest cost area. The (smaller)
industries will simply move out."
The City Council enacted these
options of the city's "Comprehensive
Plan" of future development after
hearing the city staff report of growth
projections.

If density levels are to remain the
same, Palo Alto can expect an increase
of over 20,000 jobs over the next 15
years, the staff report said. According
to the report, half of the increase
would come from the Stanford
Industrial Park.
