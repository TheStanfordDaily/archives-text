# Shriver Foresees Demo Sweep
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
Former vice-presidential candidate
R. Sargent Shriver last night predicted
a Democratic sweep in mid-term
elections next Tuesday and in the
1976 Presidential election, but warned
that party victory alone won't solve
the nation's problems.
Speaking to 350 persons in
Cubberley Auditorium, Shriver
emphagjzed that "confidence must be
earned, not claimed. Victory should
not make us think we've won the
struggle. We must prove we're better
by what we do, not by what we say."
Shriver criticized President Ford for
"betraying his own word," by granting
a pardon to former President Richard
M. Nixon, for his "choice to feed an

insatiable [defense] program," and
for "weakness on the issue of
inflation."
Suggesting that Ford's economic
policy differs little from that of
Nixon, Shriver quipped, "We've
replaced a tricky hidden-ball
quarterback with a cheerleader who
hands off to someone on every play
while passing out WIN buttons to the
spectators."
Shriver expressed concern that
Ford's new tax program "raises taxes
in the middle class and lowers taxes on
corporations," when it should
"decrease taxes for the lower
income class and raise taxes on excess
windfall income."
And he cited four ways to
redistribute wealth:
—strict enforcement of anti-trust
laws;
—monitoring of lobbying and
campaign contributions;
—controls of conflict-of interest;
—a thorough accounting of the
welfare system.
But "there are no easy solutions to
these problems," he added. "We
probably face years of inflation and
recession at .the same time."
Calling for "public action" to solve
the energy crisis, Shriver advocated
gasoline rationing, the use of smaller
cars and a horsepower tax to
"discourage gas guzzlers."
"We probably will have to accept
mandatory controls," he said, adding,
"Even L.A. may have to start a public
transportation system."
Citing four other national crises
unemployment, poor food
distribution, inadequate health
programs and delays in civil and
criminal trials Shriver called the
Administration "incompetent."
"Administration officials except for
Henry Kissinger have small horizons,"
he said. "They're timid, without
resources and convictions. We must
reintroduce ethical attitudes which
typified the founders of this nation."
When asked if he thought the
Senate would approve Nelson A.
Rockefeller's vice-presidential
nomination, Shriver said, "If one more

shoe it's over. People are
revolted by men in the highest levels in
the land conducting themselves on the
lowest level of expediency. We should
expect a higher standard than the
minimum out of the White House."
Shriver emphasized that he has no
immediate plans to run for President
in 1976, but added, "I never expected
to run the last time."
