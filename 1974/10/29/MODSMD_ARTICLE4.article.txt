# Nixon Undergoes Surgery Today

LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -
Former President Richard M. Nixon
will undergo surgery today to arrest a
worsening blood clot condition that
threatens his life, his personal
physician said last night.
Dr. John C. Lungren said through a
hospital spokesman that the
61-year-old former president will be
operated on at 5:30 a.m. PST.
Lungren said the decision to
operate followed a venogram which
confirmed the presence of a large clot
in a major artery in Nixon's left thigh.
Following consultation with two
surgeons at Memorial Hospital Medical
Center, Lungren said:
"Dr. Eldon B. Hickman and Dr.
Wiley F. Barker, following the
venogram, concurred that the new clot
threatened to become a pulmonary
embolus and thus endangers Mr.
Nixon's life."
Lungren said Nixon would be under
general anesthesia during the
operation, which will be performed by
Hickman.
Risky Surgery
Because Nixon is being treated with
anticoagulant drugs, "there is
somewhat more risk than normal for
this type of surgery," said Lungren,
Nixon's personal physician for 22
years.
Nixon was readmitted to the
hospital last Wednesday night when
Lungren concluded that oral
anticoagulant drugs were ineffective in
treating the phlebitis which Nixon
suffered in his left leg. Nixon had been
hospitalized for 12 days in late

September and early October.
A source close to Nixon had
described the former chief executive as
being in great pain during his current
hospital stay.
One Hour Operation
Hospital spokesman Norman Nager
said in a telephone bulletin that the
surgery on Nixon would last about one
hour.
"X-ray pictures made during the
special test confirmed the presence of
a large clot extending to the left
external iliac artery, the vessel that
connects the femoral artery in the
thigh to the interior vena cava,"
Lungren's statement said. The vena
cava is one of two large veins in the
leg.
"Based on this concern, the new
clot, the doctors agreed that urgent
surgery should be scheduled at 5:30
a.m. today," Lungren said.
"Mr. Nixon agreed to take the
advice of the Memorial Hospital
Medical Center surgical team headed
by vascular surgeon Eldon Hickman."
Julie Reacts
In Washington, Nixon's younger
daughter, Julie Nixon Eisenhower,
told a newsman, "They wanted to
operate last night, but he was too
weak. He's exhausted."
Eisenhower said she was advised of
the planned operation by a call from
her father's doctor about 10 p.m. PST.
She said, "I know my mother's
going to be there." But Eisenhower
said she does not plan to come to
Long Beach immediately.
