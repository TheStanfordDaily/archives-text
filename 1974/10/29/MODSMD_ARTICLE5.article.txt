# Powell Says Relief Needed
## Court's Caseload 'Too Heavy' 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Lewis F. Powell Jr., associate justice of the United States
Supreme Court, warned yesterday that the Supreme Court
and other federal courts must find a new way to deal with
the increasing number of cases they consider every year.
"If the present upward trend in the caseload continues,"
Powell said, "there will come a time in the relatively near
future when appropriate measures must be taken to relieve
the caseload of the federal courts."
Powell, appointed to the Supreme Court by former
President Richard M. Nixon in 1971, was visiting the
campus for several days at the invitation of Law School
Dean Thomas Ehrlich. He answered questions at a press
conference yesterday afternoon following an off-the-record
session with a group of more than 250 people, mostly law
students.
"This is not just a problem of the Supreme Court, but all

federal courts," Powell observed. He said the Supreme
Court currently hears roughly 200 cases a year, which
represents about five percent of all cases filed with the
court.
While he emphasized that the Supreme Court "has not
endorsed any plan," Powell discussed a "number of
proposals that would relieve to some extent the caseload
problem."
One plan, proposed by a committee chaired by Harvard
Law Prof. Paul Freund, calls for the creation of another
court just below the Supreme Court to screen out a certain
number of cases.
Another plan, now under study by Congress, would
eliminate the current practice of direct appeal from
three-judge district courts directly to the Supreme Court,
instead, an appeal of a decision by a three-judge district
court would be heard by a Court of Appeals before it
reached the Supreme Court. Powell said this system, if
approved, would serve both to screen cases and to "give us
the benefit of two levels of federal courts."
Powell said he has not "studied any particular proposal
enough to make a recommendation," but he cautioned,
"One of the Court's more important functions is to
determine which cases we should hear, and any system to
relieve the burden of the Court should take that
responsibility into account."
The Supreme Court, he added, is at a particular
disadvantage because all nine justices must vote on every
decision. "We do not sit in panels," Powell explained. "We
sit only as a full court."
Powell attributed increased student interest in attending
law schools to two factors. First, he said, "The law itself
affords perhaps more career options than any other
discipline. Legal training is useful for government service of
any kind; it's useful for business ...
"The other reason relates to. .. professional
responsibility," he said. "Young people perceive the law as

one of the principal means of effecting
change in society, and I think that's
healthy."
Poor Quality
Powell said he has been surprised at
the poor quality of some of the legal
arguments before the Supreme Court.
"One of the disappointments I have
experienced in going.on the Court is
the quality of some of the advocacy,
both written and oral," he said. "Some
of it is excellent, but there is more
diversity in the quality than I would
have expected."
He said that one way ,of correcting
this problem might be "certification of
lawyers for particular specialties" so
that the Court could be sure that it
was hearing arguments from experts in
a given field.
