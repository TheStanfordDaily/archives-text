# Dymally, Harmer: Diametrically Opposed
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
It would be hard to find two candidates
more diverse than Democrat Mervyn
Dymally and Republican John Harmer,
vying for the state's lieutenant governorship
in next week's election.

Harmer is the incumbent due to his
appointment by fellow Republican Ronald
Reagan less than a month ago. Former Lt.
Gov. Ed Reinecke resigned after he was
sentenced on a perjury charge.
Dymally and running mate Jerry Brown
are both currently ahead in the opinion
polls. An eight-year state senator from
Watts, Dymally is accustomed to winning by
large margins. In 1964 he received 94
percent of the vote in a state assembly bid,
and two years later became California's first
black state senator with 92 percent of the
vote.

Dymally, a native of Trinidad, has
espoused such causes as reduction of
marijuana law penalties, increased aid to
elementary schools and equal rights for
women. He has also given heavy emphasis to
his reputation as something of a legislative
maverick.
Party Control
"I have changed the course of the
political movement here to give the blacks
and other minorities more freedom from

white liberals," he says. "The party has been
controlled by liberals who give lip service to
the idea of minority representation.
"My politics is devoid of middle class
inspirations the big car, the swimming
pool. I have never mixed with those people;
I have never gone to their parties."
Until he became lieutenant governor early
this month, Harmer was probably best
known as a long-time conservative legislator
who sponsored several mostly unsuccessful
anti-pornography measures.
Stubborn Fighter

A Mormon, originally from Salt Lake
City, the 40-year-old Harmer has proved a
stubborn fighter for his own bills, which
have not often met with success. "There are
times you have to compromise to
accomplish things, and right now I can't
think of too many times he has done that,"
said a former Senate associate, George
Deukmejian (R-Long Beach).
Harmer opposes Dymally on almost every
major issue. He has actively supported the
death penalty and urged new offshore oil
drilling, while he has opposed any relaxation
of existing drug laws.
He asked Governor Reagan to appoint

him Reinecke's successor, saying "if this is
going to cost me any antagonism on the part
of some voters, so be it." Dymally termed

Harmer's appointment an "attempt to fix an
election."
Low-Profile
Obviously, neither candidate has
generated a lot of excitement in the race for
an office which, at least until Reinecke's
conviction, remained fairly low-profile.
Some polls have shown that as many as one
third of the voters expressed no preference
between the two.

Dymally gained most of his headlines,
which have been scarce for both candidates,
by not appearing for a recent taping of a
public television debate between the
candidates.

He originally refused to appear because
the station's employees were on strike, but
later, when the taping location was changed,
he declared he had made other
commitments, leaving Harmer to debate
candidates of the Peace and Freedom and
American Independent parties.
Criticism
Ironically, Dymally, co-author of a state
campaign disclosure bill which he calls "the
toughest in the natioi.," has faced his stiffest
criticism over accusations that he illegally
diverted $7900 in campaign contributions
for his personal use.

The accusations were first raised by
Howard Miller, one of Dymally's primary

opponents, who charged that the funds were
laundered through a now-defunct firm called
Public Affairs Consultants, owned by
Dymally's sister.

After attempting to prove his innocence
by showing newsmen a mysterious
document, Dymally told them, "You'll just
have to trust me; I wouldn't be stupid
enough to show you a fraudulent
document."
He then soundly defeated Miller and five
other opponents to win the Democratic
nomination.
Small Margin
Harmer won by a much smaller primary
margin over John Veneman, a close political
associate of gubernatorial candidate Houston
Flournoy. His views are generally far to the
right of his running mate's, and they have
not campaigned together.
"I describe myself as conservative, as
intensely partriotic," says Harmer. "My
religion teaches that this nation was founded
by divine providence for the protection of
freedom for the rest of the world."

Dymally probably summed up the race
best when he explained why he decided to
run. "There isn't much competition for the
job," he said. Besides, he added, he doesn't
like to handle money.
