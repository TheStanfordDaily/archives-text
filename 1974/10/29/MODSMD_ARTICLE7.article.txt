## Propositions 
### 
Prop. 1 (School Building Aid) YES
Students throughout the state are presently housed in buildings
that are structurally unsafe and do not meet earthquake standards.
Many must be repaired or replaced by 1975. This bond issue of $l5O
million would provide funds for the construction and improvement of
public schools.
Prop. 2 (Charter Amendments) YES
The state legislature must approve city or county charter
amendments which have been approved by the voters. This is a
cumbersome and expensive process which would be eliminated by this
proposition.
Prop. 3 (Civil Service Exemptions) . . YES
The Postsecondary Education Commission will have greater
flexibility in improving statewide education planning and
coordination if the chief administrative officer and three of his
deputies arc exempted from the civil service system, as this
proposition provides.
Prop. 4 (UC Regents) YES
The University of California Board of Regents will be made more
representative and responsive to the public with the approval of this
proposition. The board will be able to appoint one student and one
faculty member to the board and appointments will be required to
reflect economic, cultural and social diversity. Regents' terms will be
shortened from 16 to 12 years.
Prop. 5 (Government Employees Residence) NO
The option of requiring a city's or county's employees to reside in
that city or county should be left to local governments to decide. This
proposition would prohibit any city or county from making a
residence requirement, thereby possibly creating a special class of
public employees, willing to accept the benefits of public
employment, but unwilling to share the responsibilities borne by the
residents who employ them.
Prop. 6 (Homeowners and Renters Relief) YES
Renters should receive benefits comparable to an increase in
homeowners' property tax exemptions, exemptions that would
increase to $1750 of assessed value if this proposition is approved.
The higher exemption would provide needed relief for those in lower
income brackets.
Prop. 7 (Declaration of Rights) YES
The lengthy and outdated state constitutional provisions involving
personal and property righti need to be streamlined and clarified and
made consistent with the federal constitution.
fl' \ ,
Prop. 8 (Taxation and State Funds) YES
Articles in the state constitution relating to taxation need to be
streamlined and shortened. These changes would have only a minor
effect on costs and revenues.
Prop. 9 (Recall of Public Officers) . YES
The public's right to recall public officials must be made more
uniform. Current constitutional provisions forbid recall proceedings
for the first six months of a state officer's term, but only 5 days for a
member of the legislature. This "grace" period would be eliminated
by this proposition, though it would not affect the present six-month
grace period for local officers.
Prop. 10 (Right to Vote) '. . YES
Restoring the right to vote to ex-felons is a measure long overdue,
and essential in a truly democratic society. We endorse this
proposition with some reservations, however. Reservations stemming
from the belief that the right to vote should never be taken away in
the first place, and that the provision in the proposition permitting
disqualification of persons "mentally incompetent" is,an unnecessary
and vicious tool of the state.
Prop. 11 (Gender Changes in Constitution) YES
Changing terms in the masculine gender to the neuter in the state
constitution recognizes equal opportunity to participate in the
political process for men and women. The substance of the
constitution would not be altered.
Prop. 12 (Public Utilities) YES
Further modernization and shortening of the state constitution can
be accomplished by modifying provisions relating to the Public
Utilities Commission, with no substantive changes.
Prop. 13 (San Diego County, Judicial Districts) NO
This is an attempt by strictly local interests to establish a separate
court in an area already covered by another court. Existing
constitutional provisions offer enough flexibility to meet special local
needs and should be altered, if the need arises, to cover the whole
state and not just one county.
Prop. 14 (State College System Trustees) YES
By adding the president pro tempore of the slate Senate to the
State University board of trustees, a more balanced representation of
the legislature would be provided. The Speaker of the Assembly is
already a member of the board, as are the governor and the lieutenant
governor.
The Daily's endorsements on Props. 15,16 and 17 will appear tomorrow
