"We are going to have to put all the
pressure we can on income sources" to
assure tuition will not climb and make
Stanford the sole province of the rich,
Vice Provost for Budget and Planning
Raymond Bacchetti said yesterday.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Bacchetti said the
University is monitoring the effect of
the rising tuition in relation to
financial aid policy.
"We have studied the
interrelationship between financial aid
and enrollment, and so far as we can
tell, there is not yet a significant
biasing of the socio-economic
background of the student body," he
said.
Economic Reasons
Bacchetti said the indication that
students did not turn Stanford down
for economic reasons was "surprising
and a heartening sign that our financial
aid policies are meeting the
objectives."
He confirmed that the University
"asked every school department and
service unit to hold back on
expenditures" in the current fiscal
year.
This three percent across-the-board
cut is an attempt to minimize the
deficit for this year as the University
prepares to cut $lO million from the
operating budget over the next three
years, he said.
"The target for next year and the
three-year program is about 17
percent. Some of this can be achieved
through income sources not yet
tapped. We have distributed initial
targets based on pro-rata kind of
reasoning," he said. He emphasized the
targets were only initial and are open
to review.
Academic Programs
Bacchetti said that academic
programs would have first priority,
though some cuts there may be

UP TUITION?—Vice Provost for Budget and Planning Raymond Bacchetti said
yesterday that the University was attempting to keep future tuition hikes
minimal. However, rising prices would continue to drive tuition up, he said.
Financial aid programs will help balance out any hikes, he added.
