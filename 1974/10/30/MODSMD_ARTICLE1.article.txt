# Bacchetti: Minimize Tuition Hikes
## 
### DON COX 
"We are going to have to put all the
pressure we can on income sources" to
assure tuition will not climb and make
Stanford the sole province of the rich,
Vice Provost for Budget and Planning
Raymond Bacchetti said yesterday.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Bacchetti said the
University is monitoring the effect of
the rising tuition in relation to
financial aid policy.
"We have studied the
interrelationship between financial aid
and enrollment, and so far as we can
tell, there is not yet a significant
biasing of the socio-economic
background of the student body," he
said.
Economic Reasons
Bacchetti said the indication that
students did not turn Stanford down
for economic reasons was "surprising
and a heartening sign that our financial
aid policies are meeting the
objectives."
He confirmed that the University
"asked every school department and
service unit to hold back on
expenditures" in the current fiscal
year.
This three percent across-the-board
cut is an attempt to minimize the
deficit for this year as the University
prepares to cut $lO million from the
operating budget over the next three
years, he said.
"The target for next year and the
three-year program is about 17
percent. Some of this can be achieved
through income sources not yet
tapped. We have distributed initial
targets based on pro-rata kind of
reasoning," he said. He emphasized the
targets were only initial and are open
to review.
Academic Programs
Bacchetti said that academic
programs would have first priority,
though some cuts there may be

necessary. Referring to particular
innovative programs like SWOPSI and
SCIRE, Bacchetti noted these
programs operate on very small
budgets.
"They will not be any more
vulnerable than anything else, but they
will not be any less vulnerable," he
said.
Current financial problems the
University faces arise out of excessive
expenditures in the past, Bacchetti
said.
"We've been looking at the
relationship between investment
income and long-range financial
equilibrium. We've been spending
more than we should have and
re-investing less than we should have,"
he said.
Financial Problems
Unless the endowment principal
keeps pace with rising expenditures,
Stanford will continue to face
financial problems, he said.
Bacchetti said reductions in the
budget that must take place over the
next couple of years "will make
Stanford somewhat smaller ... we will
do less, but what we will continue to
do, we will do well."
"While no one goes around bragging
about their financial difficulties,"
Bacchetti said that the economic
"forces bearing down on us are also
bearing down" on other private
educational institutions similar to
Stanford.
Bacchetti said "it was surprising to
us to find the Campaign for Stanford
still on target." He said he "hoped the
goals of the campaign couid still be
reached" even though inflation has
doubled the cost of some buildings
that the campaign was to help finance.

about their financial difficulties,"
Bacchetti said that the economic
"forces bearing down on us are also
bearing down" on other private
educational institutions similar to
Stanford.
Bacchetti said "it was surprising to
us to find the Campaign for Stanford
still on target." He said he "hoped the
goals of the campaign couid still be
reached" even though inflation has
doubled the cost of some buildings
that the campaign was to help finance.
"We are going to have to put all the
pressure we can on income sources" to
assure tuition will not climb and make
Stanford the sole province of the rich,
Vice Provost for Budget and Planning
Raymond Bacchetti said yesterday.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Bacchetti said the
University is monitoring the effect of
the rising tuition in relation to
financial aid policy.
"We have studied the
interrelationship between financial aid
and enrollment, and so far as we can
tell, there is not yet a significant
biasing of the socio-economic
background of the student body," he
said.
Economic Reasons
Bacchetti said the indication that
students did not turn Stanford down
for economic reasons was "surprising
and a heartening sign that our financial
aid policies are meeting the
objectives."
He confirmed that the University
"asked every school department and
service unit to hold back on
expenditures" in the current fiscal
year.
This three percent across-the-board
cut is an attempt to minimize the
deficit for this year as the University
prepares to cut $lO million from the
operating budget over the next three
years, he said.
"The target for next year and the
three-year program is about 17
percent. Some of this can be achieved
through income sources not yet
tapped. We have distributed initial
targets based on pro-rata kind of
reasoning," he said. He emphasized the
targets were only initial and are open
to review.
Academic Programs
Bacchetti said that academic
programs would have first priority,
though some cuts there may be

necessary. Referring to particular
innovative programs like SWOPSI and
SCIRE, Bacchetti noted these
programs operate on very small
budgets.
"They will not be any more
vulnerable than anything else, but they
will not be any less vulnerable," he
said.
Current financial problems the
University faces arise out of excessive
expenditures in the past, Bacchetti
said.
"We've been looking at the
relationship between investment
income and long-range financial
equilibrium. We've been spending
more than we should have and
re-investing less than we should have,"
he said.
Financial Problems
Unless the endowment principal
keeps pace with rising expenditures,
Stanford will continue to face
financial problems, he said.
Bacchetti said reductions in the
budget that must take place over the
next couple of years "will make
Stanford somewhat smaller ... we will
do less, but what we will continue to
do, we will do well."
"While no one goes around bragging
about their financial difficulties,"
Bacchetti said that the economic

bearing down" on other private
educational institutions similar to
