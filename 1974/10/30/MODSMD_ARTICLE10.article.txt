# McCloskey--Liberal But Republican
## 
### William Ross 
Recent media attempts to label Rep. Paul
N. McCloskey Jr. as a conservative have
apparently been greatly misunderstood by
McCloskey, his campaign assistants and
supporters.
My own analysis of McCloskey's apparent
shift to the right (Daily, Oct. 11) was not
meant as obloquy of the congressman's
positions. Rather, I merely pointed out that:
—McCloskey's stands on the issues are
generally more conservative than are those of
his opponent, Santa Clara Mayor Gary
Gillmor;
—Gillmor's campaign program probably
reflects the views of most Stanford students
more closely than that of McCloskey;
—McCloskey is trying hard to reestablish
his ties with the Republican Party;
—many of McCloskey's most appealing
liberal positions, especially on Nixon's
impeachment and withdrawal from Vietnam,
are now moot.
Anyone who examines McCloskey's
record cannot seriously accuse the
congressman of assuming a right wing stance.
McCloskey's willingness during the Nixon
Administration to risk defeat in GOP
primaries by expressing unorthodox liberal
views is well known.
But McCloskey's position as a
much-needed voice of Republican dissent
didn't end with Nixon's resignation.
McCloskey has forthrightly criticized the ,

President's five percent surtax and the Ford
pardon, and continues to vote his conscience
in Congress regardless of the official line of
the Administration.
Yet McCloskey has also expressed faith in
Ford as a man of honesty and integrity who
needs a chance to grow into his job. I happen
largely to agree with him. But I am convinced
that a large proportion of students here
disagree with him. Certainly Gillmor's
unconditional criticism of Ford is more
consonant with student opinion than
McCloskey's apologies for the President.
McCloskey is clearly mending his political
fences and is once again accepted in GOP
circles as a genuine Republican. But surely
McCloskey's campaign appearances with such
people as Gerald Ford, gubernatorial
candidate Houston Flournoy and Rep. John
Rousselot will not win him much support on
campus.
Since most Stanford students are
Democrats, McCloskey's Republicanism
leaves him vulnerable among those students
who want to elect a "veto-proof"
Democratic Congress.
On many economic issues, Gillmor. is
clearly more liberal than is McCloskey. For
example, Gillmor favors a full cradle-to-grave
national health insurance plan while
McCloskey supports the Administration's
much more limited plan. McCloskey has
spoken strongly in favor of the balanced
budget; Gillmor contends that the solution to

national social problems should be given a
higher priority than slowing inflation.
Gillmor has also advocated an excess profits
tax on oil companies; in contrast, McCloskey
has had qualms about intervening with
private enterprise.
On issues such as abortion, capital
punishment and amnesty, McCloskey has
taken a more leftish stand than Gillmor. But
this doesn't negate Gillmor's credentials as a
"Democratic liberal," which is how a very
large number of Stanford students identify
themselves. True, McCloskey was supported
two years ago against a liberal Democrat, but
McCloskey was at that time more estranged
from the GOP.
In short, McCloskey's courage and
comparative liberalism stand unchallenged by
all but his most biased critics. Yet Gillmor's
record as a progressive Democrat place his
views more in line with the majority of
students than those of McCloskey.
The old assumption that Stanford is an
impregnable bastion of McCloskey support
must now be challenged. In talks with
Gillmor aides, I have received the impression
that Gillmor despairs of winning any
substantial support here. For the reasons I
outlined above, this might cause him
to lose by a wider margin than that for which
he now seems destined.
