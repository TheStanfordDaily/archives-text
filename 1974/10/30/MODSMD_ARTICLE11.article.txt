# The 						Iranian People Live In Poverty
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Cultural Center
recently presented a program
about Iran emphasizing the arts
and cultural achievements of the
Iranian people.
Listed on their program was a
talk on "Iran Today," supposedly
sponsored by the Stanford Iranian
students none of whom had
been consulted. The program was
later canceled. I would therefore
like to respond to the
irresponsible actions of the Palo
Alto Cultural Center and also to
offer a picture of everyday life in
Iran.
Because of widespread poverty,
most Iranians live in small mud
huts which easily succumb to
earthquakes and torrential rains.
This situation has led to
thousands of deaths in the past
decade.
In contrast, the concentration
of the vital economic and political
powers in the hands of a few
comprador bourgeoisie has
generated an immense waste of
national wealth. "Iran's beau
monde frolic in striking splendor.
One Iranian industrialist built
himself a replica of Marie
Antoinette's Petit Trianon
[Newsweek, Oct. 14, 1974]."
Agriculture Bleak
The agricultural situation is
also unnecessarily bleak. Today
80 percent of Iran's food imports
are in the following categories:
beef, mutton, poultry, eggs, feed
grain, wheat and rice. Iran was
previously self-sufficient in all of
these categories. [New Republic,
Sept. 21, 1974].
In 1952, production levels
were so high that the export of
agricultural products sufficed to
balance the foreign exchange
during the Western and Russian
boycott of the newly nationalized
Iranian oil. Later, Premier
Mossadegh, the leader of the
National Front, was overthrown
by the CIA-backed coup on Aug.
23,1953.
After the coup, by successive
five-year plans, the national
agricultural product was
unmistakably and purposefully
given a change in direction from
self-sufficiency to absolute
dependency upon the West. The
success of these plans can be
evidenced through the Iranian
economy's thirst for vital oil
export revenues, in the absence of
which it would collapse in a few
days.
Need To Appease
The current dependency is so
far-reaching that even if a national

movement were to succeed in
germinating and unfolding, its
efforts to bring about social
changes would be effectively
thwarted (at least initially) by the
need to appease the West, thereby
maintaining its market for oil and
staving off the ever-present threat
of starvation.
Daily wages in the Tehran area
rang from $1.75 to $3.60 and
daily farm wages range from
$1.50 to $2.50. Yet the prices in
Tehran are as high as those in New
York City and are continually
climbing. Last year the rate of
inflation was 50 percent.
Because of the inability of
parents to provide for necessary
subsistence, children become
wage-earners as early as seven
years of age. In fact, half of all
Iranian children between the ages
of seven and 14 are wage earners.
Most work in the carpet factories
for 12 hours a day because only
their tiny fingers can make the
millions of small knots necessary
for the famous Persian carpets.
Working in small, poorly lit rooms

and squatting for hours without
rest, they soon become blind and
crippled.
Persons from all walks of life
have been persecuted because of
their attempts to rectify these and
other problems. For instance,
during a demonstration protesting
the arrest of the Iranian religious
leader, Ayat-o-allah Khomeini,
thousands of people were shot
and killed in two days. Others,
such as Meftahi, Meshghin-fan and
Golsorkhiwho are representative
of the various political persuasions
in Iran, were shot or died under
torture for their efforts to end the
injustice and repression in Iran.
In addition, the Shah has built
an extensive and pervasive secret
police network operating under
the tutelage of the CIA. "...
people really do just disappear.
Just how many disappear is
unknown, but Iran has 20,000
political prisoners in jail, and
Amnesty International maintains
that a large number of Iranians
have been secretly executed for
political opposition to the regime

[Newsweek, Oct. 14, 1974]."
In a country as rich in natural
resources as Iran, why must
people live such miserable lives?
Certainly, there is enough wealth
in oil alone to provide a plentiful
life for all Iranian people. Instead
oil revenues pour back into the
Western capitalist countries in the
form of arms purchases, thereby
helping to alleviate the threat of
recession in the West by supplying
an outlet for western waste
products and in general, propping
up otherwise faulty economies.
Last year alone, Iran spent $4
billion for U.S. weaponry. She has
also given $1 billion to the World
Bank of which $3OO million was
transferred to the Chilean Junta.
Currently, Iran is negotiating to
purchase $4 billion in
communication equipment from
the Pentagon equipment that
they say will be used primarily for
"nonmilitary purposes
[Newsweek, Oct. 14,1974]."

his name be withheld for fear of
arrest upon his return to Iran.)
