# The 						Marines Are Coming

### Jonathan Marshall 
The Marines are coming! On
Oct. 30, Marine Corps recruiters
will interview students at the
Stanford Placement Center in
search of educated raw material
with which to make war.
The Marines stand ready to
defend the peace throughout the
Free World or so they would
have us believe. But Mgr. Gen.
Smedley Butler told a different
story back in 1935:
"I spent 35 years and
four ninths in active service as a
member of our country's most
agile military force the Marine
Corps ... And during that period
I spent most of my time being a
high-class muscle man for Big
Business, for Wall Street, and for
the bankers. In short, I was a
racketeer for capitalism....
"Thus I helped make Mexico
and especially Tampico safe for
American oil interests in 1914. I
helped make Haiti a decent place
for the National City Bank boys
to collect revenues in.... I
brought light to the Dominican

Republic for American sugar
interests in 1916. t hoiped make
Honduras 'right' for American
fruit companies in 1903. In China
in 1927 I helped see to it that
Stanford oil went its way
unmolested.
'A Swell Racket'
"During those years I had, as
the boys in the back room would
say, a swell racket. I was rewarded
with honors, medals, promotion.
Looking back on it, I feel I might
have given A1 Capone a few hints.
The best he could do was to
operate his racket in three city
districts. We Marines operated on
three continents."
Since World War 11, the
Marines have done their very best
to live up to the glorious and
legendary traditions of gunboat
diplomacy established early in this
century. They continue to carry
the big stick around the world to
protect the rights of American
investors and property owners.
In 1958 the Marines landed on
the shores of Lebanon to insure
stability and protect the interests

of U.S. oil companies in the
Middle East.
In 1965 President Johnson sent
the Marines to invade the
Dominican Republic to prop up
the tottering forces of America's
man in Santo Domingo, Reid
Cabral. Once again the Marines
bailed out U.S. sugar companies in
the Caribbean.
But the proudest episode in
Marine Corps history must "have
been Vietnam. For a decade the
Marines fought bravely to defend
oil companies drilling in the South
China Sea, banks locating in
Singapore and Saigon, and
electronics companies investing in
the cheap-labor areas of Southeast
Asia.
Yes, the Marines will continue
to defend the sanctity of the Free
World, from Santiago to Saigon
on American terms. Help us
protest their continued
recruitment for war.

The Marines stand ready to
defend the peace throughout the
Free World or so they would
have us believe. But Mgr. Gen.
Smedley Butler told a different
story back in 1935:
"I spent 35 years and
four ninths in active service as a
member of our country's most
agile military force the Marine
Corps ... And during that period
I spent most of my time being a
high-class muscle man for Big
Business, for Wall Street, and for
the bankers. In short, I was a
racketeer for capitalism....
"Thus I helped make Mexico
and especially Tampico safe for
American oil interests in 1914. I
helped make Haiti a decent place
for the National City Bank boys
to collect revenues in.... I
brought light to the Dominican

Republic for American sugar
interests in 1916. t hoiped make
Honduras 'right' for American
fruit companies in 1903. In China
in 1927 I helped see to it that
Stanford oil went its way
unmolested.
'A Swell Racket'
"During those years I had, as
the boys in the back room would
say, a swell racket. I was rewarded
with honors, medals, promotion.
Looking back on it, I feel I might
have given A1 Capone a few hints.
The best he could do was to
operate his racket in three city
districts. We Marines operated on
three continents."
Since World War 11, the
Marines have done their very best
to live up to the glorious and
legendary traditions of gunboat
diplomacy established early in this
century. They continue to carry
the big stick around the world to
protect the rights of American
investors and property owners.
In 1958 the Marines landed on
the shores of Lebanon to insure
stability and protect the interests

of U.S. oil companies in the
Middle East.
In 1965 President Johnson sent
the Marines to invade the
Dominican Republic to prop up
the tottering forces of America's
man in Santo Domingo, Reid
Cabral. Once again the Marines
bailed out U.S. sugar companies in
the Caribbean.
But the proudest episode in
Marine Corps history must "have
been Vietnam. For a decade the
Marines fought bravely to defend
oil companies drilling in the South
China Sea, banks locating in
Singapore and Saigon, and
electronics companies investing in
the cheap-labor areas of Southeast
Asia.
Yes, the Marines will continue
to defend the sanctity of the Free
World, from Santiago to Saigon
on American terms. Help us
protest their continued
recruitment for war.

undergraduate majoring in
history.)
The Marines are coming! On
Oct. 30, Marine Corps recruiters
will interview students at the
Stanford Placement Center in
search of educated raw material
with which to make war.
