More On Recruiting
Editor:
President Lyman emphasizes in
his letter of Oct. 24 that Stanford,
as well as other universities, is
guilty of "studious avoidance of
shortcomings" in recruitment
literature.
Lyman can only suggest the
corrections other schools can
make in their recruitment policies.
However, he has the power (and
the responsibility) to make sure
Stanford assembles its own
"Truth in Educational Packaging"
program particularly in
reference to the housing shortage.
After a reading of Lyman's
speech to the American Cohncil
on Education, students can expect
him to implement, here at
Stanford, his beliefs in total and
candid communications with
applicants.
In the recruitment battle,
Stanford must stand among other
schools on its merits and
demerits, combined. Surely
Lyman has sufficient confidence
in Stanford to reveal all aspects of
the "Stanford experience."

Same Insensitivity
Editor:
Despite the many protests over
Daily coverage of the recent
murder on campus, the same
insensitivity characterizes current
coverage of the most recent
outrage.

We see no justification for
printing the name of the woman
who was attacked last Sunday.
What possible contribution to the
solution of the case or the
prevention of other attacks could
the publication of her name offer?
The first coverage of the
incident omitted every identifying
detail except her age. The
following day, however, the Daily
printed her name and husband's
affiliation, supposedly because it
had been released on television
the night before. The Stanford
community and the KPIX
audience do not overlap very
greatly, and many people here
would not have known had it not
been for the Daily's perpetuation
of the insensitive treatment
offered by local newsmen.
The memory of Arlis Perry has
already been assaulted by the
press coverage of her death; the
life ahead of the other young
woman can only be made more
trying by the publicity
surrounding her tragic experience.

Tresidder Tryouts
Editor:
Applications for new members
on divisions of the Tresidder
Program Board are now available
to students.
The Board is being reorganized
this quarter. The divisions for
which positions are available
include: recreation and trips,
symposia and lectures, socials and
films, and cultural and fine arts
exhibits.
Our goal is to make Tresidder a
real community center an open
forum for the expression of a
wide variety of ideas and interests.
Th Program Board will have a
major role in this effort. If we are
to succeed, we will need the active
involvement of students
representing a broad spectrum of
interests.
Responsibilities will include all
programming functions at
Tresidder Union. The Board will
work closely with the Programs
Manager Roger Thacker in
determining what types of
programs will take place at
Tresidder. It will be a working
board, not just an advisory one.
The members will actively
participate in the initiation,
organization, execution and
evaluation of all aspects of
programming. Past projects
include: Tresidder Film Series,
Thursday Lecture and Discussion
Series, trips to baseball games,
Disneyland and a Napa Valley
Wine Tasting Trip.
Applications are available in
the Campus Affairs Office on the
second floor of Tresidder. The
deadline for submitting
applications is 5 p.m. Friday, Nov.
1.
