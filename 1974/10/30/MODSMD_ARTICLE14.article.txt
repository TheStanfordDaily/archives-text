## Penny, Koko: An Unusual Couple Rooms Together As Researchers 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
Penny and Koko are the best of friends,
but they're so ... well ... uh ... so
different.
Penny, has long, blonde hair, soft brown
eyes and a nice, shapely figure. She's pretty,
soft-spoken, sweet.
As for Koko, her hair is short and wiry, her
skin is tough and wrinkly, and her figure
well, she's stronger than a grown man. Besides
that, she has a hairy chest.
They room together. Penny tries to keep
the place neat. She's always picking things up
and putting them in place. But Koko throws
her food, climbs on the furniture, and runs up
the walls.
Her manners are atrocious: if you have
earrings on, she'll pull them right off.
"If you tell her she's bad, she says, 'good

me,' " Penny explains. "When you scold her
she changes the subject." Penny sighs, "It's all
promises, promises, and she's right back to her
old tricks again."
One other thing Koko is a three-year-old
gorilla, the first gorilla taught to communicate
in the North American sign language of the
deaf. Penny Patterson, her teacher, is a Ph.D.
candidate in psychology.
Their friendship began two years ago.
Professor Karl Pribram of the psychology and
psychiatry departments took Penny to the
San Francisco Zoo where a group of people
was trying to stimulate interest in using the
zoo as a resource for observational and other
kinds of studies.
Seldom Studied
At the time, Penny was interested both in
working with animals and in developmental

psychology. She wanted to work with a gorilla
because chimps have been quite intensively
studied, orangutans have been studied only a
little, and gorillas even less.
But Penny finally decided to work with a
gorilla because Koko, only a few months old
then, was the only young ape available at the
zoo.
Nine months before she began work with
the gorilla, Penny took a course in sign
language with the intention of eventually
teaching it to Koko.
It took time to get fluent, Penny says.
"You can say one sign very easily, but when
you try to put two together it's hard."
Untouchable Hands
Koko also had trouble with the language at
first. Penny would spend a morning or a full
day with Koko at the zoo showing her an
object first and then the sign. But for the first
month, Koko wouldn't let Penny touch her
hands.
"I could touch her, but not her hands,"
says Penny. Koko finally learned her first sign,
"drink," by imitating Penny's hands.
Now she learns |)y imitation and by
"molding" Penny takes Koko's hands and
molds them into a sign.
To learn the word, "out," for example,
Penny molded Koko's hands every time they
went outside. But Koko has "over generalized
the sign for 'out,' " Penny says. "When she's
out and wants to come in, she says, 'out.' But
children do the same thing," she adds.
100 Signs
In two years, not only has Koko learned
nearly 100 signs including some she has
invented (she bites her wrist for "bite"), but
she has also moved to Stanford.
When Koko became too strong for the
children's zoo and Penny grew tired of
commuting, the zoo provided them with a
trailer, with kitchen and bedroom facilities for
Penny and a cage for Koko. Now the trailer is
at Stanford.
Besides being bright (according to Penny,
gorillas as a species are as bright as chimps),
Koko is extremely affectionate. She knows the
sign for "hug me" and uses it often, and she
especially likes to hold kittens.
And then there's Kong, the male gorilla in
her life, who's into baseball and classical
music. Until they first met last week, Kong
had never seen another gorilla.

It was sort of a "blind date," according to
Peter Gross, curator of land animals at Marine
World. The Marine World gorilla is 4V2 years
old and larger than Koko (he weighs 80
pounds, she weights 56), so Koko played it
cool.
Kong was very interested in Koko he
purred when they were together, and purring
is the gorilla's "happy sound," Penny says.
But Koko would only approach him from
behind, when he wasn't looking. When he
would turn around, she'd run away.
Endangered Species
Gross explains that the purpose of the
match is for a future gorilla display and to get
the two gorillas familiar so they'll breed.
"Gorillas are an endangered species, so it's
important they breed in captivity," he says.

Penny hopes that Koko and Kong will
"date" frequently. "Early social contact with
others of their species is important for later
effective breeding," she explains. "A gorilla
cannot be reared in isolation and know what
to do when the time comes."
The future looks rosy for Koko and Kong,
but back at the trailer, Koko is still a lousy
roommate.
"She just ripped off another french fry,"
shouts Penny, trying to eat her hamburger in
peace.
"That's a potato," signals Penny.
"More," signals Koko, helping herself to
another.
"Koko stop those are MINE. Those are
my potatos," Penny cries. But then she
surrenders. "I think I'll give her a pickle
instead. They're more natural."

KOKO'S QUANDRY—Being kept behind a fence isn't the most stimulating way to spend time,

language with the intention of eventually
teaching it to Koko.
It took time to get fluent, Penny says.
"You can say one sign very easily, but when
you try to put two together it's hard."
Untouchable Hands
Koko also had trouble with the language at
first. Penny would spend a morning or a full
day with Koko at the zoo showing her an
object first and then the sign. But for the first
month, Koko wouldn't let Penny touch her
hands.
"I could touch her, but not her hands,"
says Penny. Koko finally learned her first sign,
"drink," by imitating Penny's hands.
Now she learns |)y imitation and by
"molding" Penny takes Koko's hands and
molds them into a sign.
To learn the word, "out," for example,
Penny molded Koko's hands every time they
went outside. But Koko has "over generalized
the sign for 'out,' " Penny says. "When she's
out and wants to come in, she says, 'out.' But
children do the same thing," she adds.
100 Signs
In two years, not only has Koko learned
nearly 100 signs including some she has
invented (she bites her wrist for "bite"), but
she has also moved to Stanford.
When Koko became too strong for the
children's zoo and Penny grew tired of
commuting, the zoo provided them with a
trailer, with kitchen and bedroom facilities for
Penny and a cage for Koko. Now the trailer is
at Stanford.
Besides being bright (according to Penny,
gorillas as a species are as bright as chimps),
Koko is extremely affectionate. She knows the
sign for "hug me" and uses it often, and she
especially likes to hold kittens.
And then there's Kong, the male gorilla in
her life, who's into baseball and classical
music. Until they first met last week, Kong
had never seen another gorilla.

It was sort of a "blind date," according to
Peter Gross, curator of land animals at Marine
World. The Marine World gorilla is 4V2 years
old and larger than Koko (he weighs 80
pounds, she weights 56), so Koko played it
cool.
Kong was very interested in Koko he
purred when they were together, and purring
is the gorilla's "happy sound," Penny says.
But Koko would only approach him from
behind, when he wasn't looking. When he
would turn around, she'd run away.
Endangered Species
Gross explains that the purpose of the
match is for a future gorilla display and to get
the two gorillas familiar so they'll breed.
"Gorillas are an endangered species, so it's
important they breed in captivity," he says.

Penny hopes that Koko and Kong will
"date" frequently. "Early social contact with
others of their species is important for later
effective breeding," she explains. "A gorilla
cannot be reared in isolation and know what
to do when the time comes."
The future looks rosy for Koko and Kong,
but back at the trailer, Koko is still a lousy
roommate.
"She just ripped off another french fry,"
shouts Penny, trying to eat her hamburger in
peace.
"That's a potato," signals Penny.
"More," signals Koko, helping herself to
another.
"Koko stop those are MINE. Those are
my potatos," Penny cries. But then she
surrenders. "I think I'll give her a pickle
instead. They're more natural."

KOKO'S QUANDRY—Being kept behind a fence isn't the most stimulating way to spend time,

climb furniture and run up walls, not unlike one of her distant cousins who plays with the

FRIENDLY PARLANCE—Ph.D. candidate Penny Patterson has taught her roommate Koko
over 100 signs in the North American sign language of the deaf. Koko is the first gorilla to be
taught the language, and one of the few gorillas to receive any kind of intensive scientific study
although gorillas are as intelligent as chimpanzees.
Penny and Koko are the best of friends,
but they're so ... well ... uh ... so
different.
Penny, has long, blonde hair, soft brown
eyes and a nice, shapely figure. She's pretty,
soft-spoken, sweet.
As for Koko, her hair is short and wiry, her
skin is tough and wrinkly, and her figure
well, she's stronger than a grown man. Besides
that, she has a hairy chest.
They room together. Penny tries to keep
the place neat. She's always picking things up
and putting them in place. But Koko throws
her food, climbs on the furniture, and runs up
the walls.
Her manners are atrocious: if you have
earrings on, she'll pull them right off.
"If you tell her she's bad, she says, 'good

me,' " Penny explains. "When you scold her
she changes the subject." Penny sighs, "It's all
promises, promises, and she's right back to her
old tricks again."
One other thing Koko is a three-year-old
gorilla, the first gorilla taught to communicate
in the North American sign language of the
deaf. Penny Patterson, her teacher, is a Ph.D.
candidate in psychology.
Their friendship began two years ago.
Professor Karl Pribram of the psychology and
psychiatry departments took Penny to the
San Francisco Zoo where a group of people
was trying to stimulate interest in using the
zoo as a resource for observational and other
kinds of studies.
Seldom Studied
At the time, Penny was interested both in
working with animals and in developmental

psychology. She wanted to work with a gorilla
because chimps have been quite intensively
studied, orangutans have been studied only a
little, and gorillas even less.
But Penny finally decided to work with a
gorilla because Koko, only a few months old
then, was the only young ape available at the
zoo.
Nine months before she began work with
the gorilla, Penny took a course in sign
language with the intention of eventually
teaching it to Koko.
It took time to get fluent, Penny says.

World. The Marine World gorilla is 4V2 years
old and larger than Koko (he weighs 80
pounds, she weights 56), so Koko played it
cool.
Kong was very interested in Koko he
purred when they were together, and purring
is the gorilla's "happy sound," Penny says.
But Koko would only approach him from
behind, when he wasn't looking. When he
would turn around, she'd run away.
Endangered Species
Gross explains that the purpose of the
match is for a future gorilla display and to get
the two gorillas familiar so they'll breed.
"Gorillas are an endangered species, so it's
important they breed in captivity," he says.

Penny hopes that Koko and Kong will
"date" frequently. "Early social contact with
others of their species is important for later
effective breeding," she explains. "A gorilla
cannot be reared in isolation and know what
to do when the time comes."
The future looks rosy for Koko and Kong,
but back at the trailer, Koko is still a lousy
roommate.
"She just ripped off another french fry,"
shouts Penny, trying to eat her hamburger in
peace.
"That's a potato," signals Penny.
"More," signals Koko, helping herself to
another.
"Koko stop those are MINE. Those are
my potatos," Penny cries. But then she
surrenders. "I think I'll give her a pickle
instead. They're more natural."

KOKO'S QUANDRY—Being kept behind a fence isn't the most stimulating way to spend time,
but Koko at age three is stronger than a grown man. She also has a natural primate tendency to
climb furniture and run up walls, not unlike one of her distant cousins who plays with the
Incomparables.

FRIENDLY PARLANCE—Ph.D. candidate Penny Patterson has taught her roommate Koko
over 100 signs in the North American sign language of the deaf. Koko is the first gorilla to be
taught the language, and one of the few gorillas to receive any kind of intensive scientific study
although gorillas are as intelligent as chimpanzees.
Penny and Koko are the best of friends,
but they're so ... well ... uh ... so
different.
Penny, has long, blonde hair, soft brown
eyes and a nice, shapely figure. She's pretty,
soft-spoken, sweet.
As for Koko, her hair is short and wiry, her
skin is tough and wrinkly, and her figure
well, she's stronger than a grown man. Besides
that, she has a hairy chest.
They room together. Penny tries to keep
the place neat. She's always picking things up
and putting them in place. But Koko throws
her food, climbs on the furniture, and runs up
the walls.
Her manners are atrocious: if you have
earrings on, she'll pull them right off.
"If you tell her she's bad, she says, 'good

me,' " Penny explains. "When you scold her
she changes the subject." Penny sighs, "It's all
promises, promises, and she's right back to her
old tricks again."
One other thing Koko is a three-year-old
gorilla, the first gorilla taught to communicate
in the North American sign language of the
deaf. Penny Patterson, her teacher, is a Ph.D.
candidate in psychology.
Their friendship began two years ago.
Professor Karl Pribram of the psychology and
psychiatry departments took Penny to the
San Francisco Zoo where a group of people
was trying to stimulate interest in using the
zoo as a resource for observational and other
kinds of studies.
Seldom Studied
At the time, Penny was interested both in
working with animals and in developmental

psychology. She wanted to work with a gorilla
because chimps have been quite intensively
studied, orangutans have been studied only a
little, and gorillas even less.
But Penny finally decided to work with a
gorilla because Koko, only a few months old
then, was the only young ape available at the
zoo.
Nine months before she began work with
the gorilla, Penny took a course in sign
language with the intention of eventually
teaching it to Koko.
It took time to get fluent, Penny says.
"You can say one sign very easily, but when
you try to put two together it's hard."
Untouchable Hands
Koko also had trouble with the language at
first. Penny would spend a morning or a full
day with Koko at the zoo showing her an
object first and then the sign. But for the first
month, Koko wouldn't let Penny touch her
hands.
"I could touch her, but not her hands,"
says Penny. Koko finally learned her first sign,
"drink," by imitating Penny's hands.
Now she learns |)y imitation and by
"molding" Penny takes Koko's hands and
molds them into a sign.
To learn the word, "out," for example,
Penny molded Koko's hands every time they
went outside. But Koko has "over generalized
the sign for 'out,' " Penny says. "When she's
out and wants to come in, she says, 'out.' But
children do the same thing," she adds.
100 Signs
In two years, not only has Koko learned
nearly 100 signs including some she has
invented (she bites her wrist for "bite"), but
she has also moved to Stanford.
When Koko became too strong for the
children's zoo and Penny grew tired of
commuting, the zoo provided them with a
trailer, with kitchen and bedroom facilities for
Penny and a cage for Koko. Now the trailer is
at Stanford.
Besides being bright (according to Penny,
gorillas as a species are as bright as chimps),
Koko is extremely affectionate. She knows the
sign for "hug me" and uses it often, and she
especially likes to hold kittens.
And then there's Kong, the male gorilla in
her life, who's into baseball and classical
music. Until they first met last week, Kong
had never seen another gorilla.

It was sort of a "blind date," according to
Peter Gross, curator of land animals at Marine
World. The Marine World gorilla is 4V2 years
old and larger than Koko (he weighs 80
