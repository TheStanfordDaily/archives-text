# ASSU Senate Questions Legality Of Candidate Disqualifications
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The ASSU Senate late Monday night voted to
refer to committee an apparent violation of the
Senate by-laws that could invalidate last Tuesday's
decision to disqualify five candidates from the fall
Senate election.
Undergraduate Senator Reggie Turner pointed
out a by-laws discrepancy suggesting that he, not
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer, should have
chaired last week's meeting.
Turner, last year's Senate chairman, quoted the
section of the by-laws saying that the Senate
chairman's term expires only when his successor is
elected.
Thus, he claimed, the actions the Senate took
while Mayer assumed the chair could be
invalidated.
The Senate voted 11-10 Oct. 22 to disqualify
undergraduates Luis Montoya, Derek Toliver,
Peter Truex, Chip Underwood and Chip Weiland
for campaign violations. Mayer, as temporary
chairman, cast the deciding vote.
Both Mayer and ASSU President Mike Herman,
an ex-officio Senate member, disagreed with
Turner. Herman called the by-laws "ambiguous."
The by-laws could in interpreted to mean the
chairman's term expires when a new Senate is
elected, according to both Mayer and Herman.
Herman also cited historical - precedents
established the last two years when former ASSU

Further complicating the issue, Alternate
Undergraduate Sen. Jody Meisel raised the
parlimentary point that Underwood should not
have been allowed to vote for himself in the
disqualification ballot.
After much discussion with little direction,
Herman began a mini-filibuster, yielding only for
motions.
Finally Turner proposed the Senate refer the
matter to the by-laws committee for further study.
The Senate approved Turner's motion by a 9-4 vote
and the committee will "detail the alternatives" in
the issue as first priority in the next Senate
meeting.
In other business, the Senate authorized a grant
of $313 to the Organization of Stanford Women
Athletes (OSWA) as "seed money" to establish the
organization. The money will come from the
Senate's $2OOO discretionary fund.
The student senators also:
—established a seven-member committee to
explore campus housing with undergraduate Sen.
Timothy Conway as chairman;
—set up a three-member committee to research
the possibility of campus food co-ops with graduate
Sen. Janice Haney as chairperson;
—selected undergraduate senators Lee Peterson
and Tom Price as the Senate's representatives to the
ASSU Publications Board;
—authorized a $2OO loan to Crothers Club.
