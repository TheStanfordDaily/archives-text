# Student Group Sets $200,000 Goal
## Committee Stages Phoneathon 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
The Student Development
Committee (SDC) is helping to
stage an intensive fund-raising
"phoneathon" as part of the $3OO
million Campaign for Stanford.
The committee is a student
organization which works with
University officials to raise funds
for Stanford.

1000 alumni across the nation by
teams of students, faculty and
alumni on the evenings of Nov.
6,7,12 and 14. The team approach
is being used to answer
prospective donors' questions
more completely.
The committee hopes to add
$200,000 to the Campaign

coffers, according to committee
member Valerie Dow.
Only members of the Quad
program alumni who annually
contribute upwards of $lOO to
the University beyond the reach
of regional alumni associations
will be contacted, committee
officials said. The alumni will be
asked to give a one-time "stretch
gift" in addition to their annual
Quad gift.
Donors will be able to specify
in which areas their gifts will be
spent; unspecified contributions
will go into the general funds of
the University, spokesmen said.
Phoneathons have been "quite
successful" in the past,
commented Janet Wilson,
assistant to the dean of student
affairs. Wilson acts as liason
between the SDC and University
fund-raisers. She said she views
the $200,000 goal as realistic,
saying the figure is the result of
"pretty careful calculations."
The SDC is now recruiting
students for the phoneathon and
Wilson said 60 are needed.
The eight-member committee
acts strictly as a solicitor of gifts
for the University. It does not
have any voice in spending
priorities, Wilson said.
However, the committee is also
concerned with informing
students of the needs and
functions of the University,
especially with regard to finances,
she added.
For example, a few years ago
the Committee posted a graphic
display in Meyer Library of how
each tuition dollar was spent.
Wilson stated that there are
tentative plans for similar projects
this year.
