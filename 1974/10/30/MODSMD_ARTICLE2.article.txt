# Grad Schools Offer Research, Study Options For Undergrads
## 
### VALERIE KRIZ 
A broad assortment of study
opportunities at the Schools of
Education, Law, Medicine and
Business are available to
undergraduates here interested in
research projects, advanced courses or
field work.
Policies vary concerning
undergraduate enrollment in graduate
level courses. For example,
undergraduates have limited access to
business courses because of small class
size and a priority system. They are
usually directed to alternatives within
the undergraduate curriculum.
On the other hand, the Medical
School has accommodated all qualified
undergraduates wanting to register for
advanced courses.
School Of Education
The Undergraduate Program in the
School of Education (UPSE) offers a
wide range of individual and small
group projects, according to UPSE
co-ordinator Gail McCutcheon.
McCutcheon said 30 students have
been placed in public and private
school classrooms in the area. Students
in UPSE are involved in "field work,
not student teaching," although they
may tutor on a one-to-one basis or
teach part-time, she stressed.
A student can design his own
project and will receive two to five
units of credit in Education 190 she
said.
Students also can attend seminars
on contemporary educational issues,
MqCutcheon added. At the end of the
quarter, they turn in their projects,
ranging from poetry to photographic
essays.
Fistful Of Letters
Waving a fistful of letters,
McCutcheon claimed there are "90
places where students could work,"
but she "just can't supervise any.more
students."
Selection is on a first-come,
first-served basis, she said. Interested
students are urged to come to the
UPSE office in Room M of Cubberley
Auditorium during winter quarter
pre-registration.
Juniors and seniors also are allowed
to enroll in 100-division courses taught
in the Education School, she said.
"In the last three years there has
been an increasing number" of
undergraduates taking education
courses, said Education Dean Arthur
P. Coladarci. "We're glad to have
them."
One course, "American Education
and Public Policy," deals with general

issues of education and is taught
specifically for undergraduates, he
said.
Law School
The Law School currently offers
three courses particularly for
undergraduates "not planning to be
lawyers," according to Joseph E.
Leininger, associate Law School dean.
He said that these courses are intended
to "expose students to major areas of
law" and are not prerequisites for law
school.
A formal program began last year
a grant from the National
Endowment for the Humanities,
University funds and donations to the
Law School,! Leininger explained.
Plans are in progress to expand the
program over a five-year period, by
developing additional "core courses,"
he added. Preparation for a new course
on the Bill of Rights is now under
consideration, he said.
Established Courses
Two established courses, "Courts
and the Legal Process" and "The
Administrative Process," are only open
to juniors, seniors and graduate
students "Criminal Law and the
Criminal System" is open to all, he
noted.
Research opportunities in the Law
School for undergraduates are limited
to four or five per semester, because
most law professors enlist the aid of
their own students, Leininger said.
Registration in other law courses is
granted only "on an exceptional basis"
according to Law School Registrar
Yvonne Erickson, and strictly depends
on undergraduates' qualifications.
Leininger stated that in the past
"less than 10" undergraduates a year
have enrolled in law courses for credit
and only "three or four" audit
courses.
It is easier, however for
undergraduates to get permission to
audit courses than to enroll in them,
Leininger said.
The Medical School has "no
program per se" for undergraduates,
according to Dr. Carl Rhodes,
coordinator of the departmental
teaching program in biochemistry.
However, the number of
undergraduates in the Med School's
Biochemistry 200 currently make up
of half the class, Rhodes said.
No priority system exists and
undergraduates can easily be
accommodated, he added.
Qualified juniors and seniors also
may sign up for Medical Microbiology
101. The course, like many others, is

designed specifically for
undergraduates with the proper
prerequisites, Rhodes said.
Students interested in participating
in research projects at the School of
Medicine should contact the professor
they would like to work under, or
check the Directory of Undergraduate
Research Opportunities available in
Building 590-A, Old Union.
Business School
At the Business School, "there is
almost no space at all" for
undergraduates, said Gary G. Williams,
assistant Business School dean.
Priority goes to business students,
matriculated graduate students in
other departments, auditing graduate
students and undergraduates,
respectively, he explained.
