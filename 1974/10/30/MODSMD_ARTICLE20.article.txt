## Women's Athletics Improved, But Still Not Equal 
### GLENN KRAMON First of Two Parts 
Members of Stanford's women's basketball
team can look forward to brand new uniforms
this winter.
And one day, when the University has
made more progress in its attempt to
accommodate the needs of women athletes,
they may even have the travel bags to carry
them in.
The Athletic Department here can point to
several positive steps taken toward equal
status for women. A physical therapy student
at the Medical School was taken on last week
as a locker room trainer for women who have
always had to limp down Campus Drive to
Cowell for basic treatment.
The central wing of Encina, long a steamy
passageway for male athletes walking between
their lockers and the showers, was opened this
fall to both sexes so that women would have
access to the gym store and intramural office.
Threat Of Title IX
Some skeptics attribute the changes to the
threat of withdrawn federal funds for a failure
to comply with Title IX, a complex, vague
and highly controversial adjunct to the U.S.
Education Amendments of 1972 which
prohibits sex discrimination at schools
receiving federal funds.
"Cosmetically on the surface Stanford
is way ahead" of other schools, contends Dr.
Rodger Rickard, an educational consultant
who has toured some 50 colleges and
universities across the country to determine
reaction to Title IX. "But they're [Stanford]
also playing a waiting game. They want to see
how tough" the final regulations will be
before they make major changes to comply.
Those regulations will be submitted to
President Ford for final approval in
December.
Ed Shaw, executive assistant to the
provost, sees the effects of Title IX from
another angle: "Title IX justjppeds up what
we should be doing already.'*

Assoc. Physical Education Prof. Wes Ruff
agrees, noting that the Title IX regulations
presently being specified and reworded on the
basis of suggestions provided by educational
institutions across the country are so
general that they require the University to
implement its own plan to grant women equal
status. "Washington is pretty far away to be
administering us" anyway, Ruff adds.
Recommendations Discussed
Thus, at President Lyman's request,
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz and Women's
Physical Education Chairwoman Pamela
Strathairn worked all summer on
recommendations for the future of the
Athletic Department.
The confidential recommendations will be
discussed starting tomorrow at a meeting of
the Committee on Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation (CAPER), a
faculty-administration-student group which
advises Lyman.
The report will likely show that there's still

a long way to go to equalize the men's and
women's athletic programs. Two of the major
inequities mentioned are coaching and
facilities."
"Better coaching is our number one
priority," says sophomore Vicki Hays, a
student member of CAPER and one of a
four-woman steering committee of the
Organization of Stanford Woman Athletes
(OSWA), a new ASSU group seeking to
inform the University of women's athletic
needs here.
"Women educators [in the Physical
Education Department] presently have to
spend 75 percent of their time in the
classroom," and consequently have little time
left for coaching, Hays says.
Moreover, most coaches here don't have
the ability to work with the many
Olympic-class woman athletes who have
competed on a state or national level even
before they came to Stanford, she adds.
Hays acknowledges that few good women's
coaches are available now, and concedes that a
look at the University's projected budget cuts
might discourage any real attempt to secure
new coaches anyway.
"Given the limits of the budget, women's
teachers here are just going to have to learn
the basics of coaching," she notes.
Emphasizing the importance of help from
men's coaches in teaching women coaching
fundamentals, Hays points to the necessity of
increased communication between the two
departments.
Unification Trend
And she is quick to refute the suggestion
that women would refuse to work with male
coaches. "We want to work under someone
who's competent, whether it's a man or a
woman."
The suggestion that one person coach both
male and female athletes is not new. And it
may point to a developing trend toward
unification of the men's and women's athletic
departments, with a resulting merger of their

activities.
Strathairn says she has already spokeq to
several coaches about the possibility that they
lead teams of both sexes, and believes the idea
could be accepted.
One coach, Jean Helliwell, has led the
fencing program here almost by herself. She
coaches teams of both sexes, advises the
fencing club and teaches two sections of
elementary fencing as well as one section each
of intermediate, advanced and graduate
fencing.
One Conference?
Ruetz says he personally favors more
unification of the men's and women's
departments, adding that one athletic
conference to replace the separate Pacific
Eight (men) and NCI AC (women) might result
from Title IX.
What has to be done to grant women equal
access to athletic facilities is another big
question. Women athletes have called for the
installation of badly needed locker facilities in

the Encina complex.
But Assoc. Director of Athletics Robert
Young says the lockers are not likely in the
near future, because money and space are not
available. Though lockers will be installed for
women intercollegiate competitors in the
deGuerre Pools complex, Young says the
Athletic Department is having enough trouble
providing men with lockers in Encina, let
alone women.
More indoor space has become a necessity
for women's sports. Ruetz says he has been
pushing hard to return the Old Pavilion, now
occupied by University personnel, to use for a
women's basketball program.
Equal Access
But even if the University decided today to
give the Old Pavilion back to the Athletic
Department, it would take at least three years
to relocate the employees there. Meanwhile,
Vicki Hays says the OSWA will be pressing for
equal access to Maples Pavilion, where the
men's basketball team practices.
Yet another problem of compliance with
Title IX is the requirement that the University
take an annual survey, possibly through a
questionnaire on the student's registration
form, to determine in which sports men and
women would like to compete.
In a letter to HEW Secretary Caspar
Weinberger, President Lyman expressed fear
that "this represents a suggestion that there
shall be federally mandated ways of arriving at
institutional decisions. If this is required for
deciding which athletic programs to offer, it is
equally applicable to other programs or
courses."
But many see the surveys as necessary to
help provide strong programs suitable to the
needs of men and women. "Programs," says
OSWA member Margie Shuer, "which are
geared toward the excellent athlete just as
Stanford academic programs are made for the
excellent student."

recruitment, funding)
