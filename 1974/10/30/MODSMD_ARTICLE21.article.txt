## Murcer-Bonds: Yankees Got Taken 
### Glenn Garvin 
Congratulations. If you were alive last
week you watched history in the making.
One of baseball's all-time bonehead deals was
pulled off right here in San Francisco.
Not since the Boston Red Sox sold Babe
Ruth to the Yankees has there been such a
stupid trade. Perhaps the Yanks were feeling
guilty about that one last week when they
sent Bobby Murcer to the Giants for Bobby
Bonds in a one-for-one swap of rightfielders.
Both teams made substantial public
relations errors in trading. And one team got
taken in terms of talent.
Both Bobbys were tops in terms of fan
appeal in their respective towns. The press
has made much of the fact that both men
tried and failed to replace established
superstars in center field. But that was a long
time ago, and really has nothing to do with
this trade.
Acceptance
In recent years, fans in San
Francisco and New York had come to accept
them on their own terms. Murcer was by far
the most popular Yankee, and New Yorkers
voted him into the All-Star game starting
line-up three years in a row.
Likewise Giant fans were generally
favorable to Bonds, in as much as Giant fans
are favorable to anybody.
Neither club can really afford to trade
away an established hero. The Yankees,
through extensive wheeling and dealing the
last couple of years, have dealt away
practically their entire lineup; 13 of 24 men
on the roster this September weren't there
when the season started.
The Giants are also suffering from a severe
case of identity crisis. Since 1971 they've
repeatedly rocked their fans by trading away
all the old heroes Willie McCovey, Juan
Marichal, and, unthinkably, Willie Mays. With
the old names gone Giant fans have felt an
increasing sense of disorientation and the
fact that the team didn't win just made it
worse. Getting rid of Bonds, the one
established "name" on the roster, can't help.
To the Yankees' credit, they've recognized
the problem and have done their best to

soothe outraged Murcer fans by giving Bonds
a big publicity buildup. They brought him to
New York last week, posed him in a Yankee
uniform, and made a big deal of giving him
his old number, 25.
The Giants, on the other hand, have
continued their long and glorious tradition of
inept management and disastrous promotion
by not saying a word about Murcer. He'll
arrive here next spring unknown to the fans.
The Giants, though, can take solace in the
fact that they got the better end of the deal.
They'll be a better team with Murcer in the
lineup.
San Francisco newspapers have babbled
idly for quite some time that Bonds is the
"best player in baseball." It's a nice line, but
the statistics prove it's a lie.
Stats Favor Murcer
His lifetime batting average is just over
.270, and he's never hit .300 over an entire
season. During 1973, when the newspaper
hype was going full speed, Bonds batted .283
and hit 39 home runs. Those are nice figures,
of course, but they represent his all-time top
performance and they just aren't good
enough to rank ahead of Pete Rose, Dick
Allen or a number of other players.
Murcer has proved that he can play with
the top people in the game. Despite all the
talk about Bonds' superb power, he's
averaged only three more homers per season
than Murcer. And Murcer's lifetime batting
average is higher: .279.
If you compute Murcer's average since
1971, when he really hit his stride as a
ballplayer, it's .299.
Murcer drives in an average of 90 runs a
year, as opposed to Bonds' average of 80.
And during the course of his career, Bonds
has struck out over 1000 times, compared to
Murcer's 400. Murcer is a much better
fielder, with several Golden Glove awards to
his credit - and his 21 outfield assists last
year tied a major league record.
The only area where Bonds has a clear
edge over Murcer is base running; he's much
faster. But Murcer is no slouch at stealing
bases.

After adding ih Murcer's statistical
superiority, then figure in the factors thaft
don't lend themselves to numbers like
Bonds' well-known penchant for drinking, or
his refusal to take batting practice with the
rest of the team. Those things will affect his
value to the Yankees just as much as his
ability to hit home runs in Shea Stadium.
When you add them up, they total one
thing: the Yankees got screwed. And when
New Yorkers find out just how badly, their
howls of last week will sound like the
chirping of crickets compared to the ruckus
they'll raise.
Congratulations. If you were alive last
week you watched history in the making.

season. During 1973, when the newspaper
hype was going full speed, Bonds batted .283
and hit 39 home runs. Those are nice figures,
of course, but they represent his all-time top
performance and they just aren't good
enough to rank ahead of Pete Rose, Dick
Allen or a number of other players.
Murcer has proved that he can play with
the top people in the game. Despite all the
talk about Bonds' superb power, he's
averaged only three more homers per season
than Murcer. And Murcer's lifetime batting
average is higher: .279.
If you compute Murcer's average since
1971, when he really hit his stride as a
ballplayer, it's .299.
Murcer drives in an average of 90 runs a
year, as opposed to Bonds' average of 80.
And during the course of his career, Bonds
has struck out over 1000 times, compared to
Murcer's 400. Murcer is a much better
fielder, with several Golden Glove awards to
his credit - and his 21 outfield assists last
year tied a major league record.
The only area where Bonds has a clear
edge over Murcer is base running; he's much
faster. But Murcer is no slouch at stealing
bases.

After adding ih Murcer's statistical
superiority, then figure in the factors thaft
don't lend themselves to numbers like
Bonds' well-known penchant for drinking, or
his refusal to take batting practice with the
rest of the team. Those things will affect his
value to the Yankees just as much as his
ability to hit home runs in Shea Stadium.
When you add them up, they total one
thing: the Yankees got screwed. And when
New Yorkers find out just how badly, their
howls of last week will sound like the
chirping of crickets compared to the ruckus
they'll raise.
Congratulations. If you were alive last
week you watched history in the making.
One of baseball's all-time bonehead deals was
pulled off right here in San Francisco.
Not since the Boston Red Sox sold Babe
Ruth to the Yankees has there been such a
stupid trade. Perhaps the Yanks were feeling
guilty about that one last week when they
sent Bobby Murcer to the Giants for Bobby
Bonds in a one-for-one swap of rightfielders.
Both teams made substantial public
relations errors in trading. And one team got
taken in terms of talent.
Both Bobbys were tops in terms of fan
appeal in their respective towns. The press
has made much of the fact that both men
tried and failed to replace established
superstars in center field. But that was a long
time ago, and really has nothing to do with
this trade.
Acceptance
In recent years, fans in San
Francisco and New York had come to accept
them on their own terms. Murcer was by far
the most popular Yankee, and New Yorkers
voted him into the All-Star game starting
line-up three years in a row.
Likewise Giant fans were generally
favorable to Bonds, in as much as Giant fans
are favorable to anybody.
Neither club can really afford to trade
away an established hero. The Yankees,
through extensive wheeling and dealing the
last couple of years, have dealt away
practically their entire lineup; 13 of 24 men
on the roster this September weren't there
when the season started.
The Giants are also suffering from a severe
case of identity crisis. Since 1971 they've
repeatedly rocked their fans by trading away
all the old heroes Willie McCovey, Juan
Marichal, and, unthinkably, Willie Mays. With
the old names gone Giant fans have felt an
increasing sense of disorientation and the
fact that the team didn't win just made it
worse. Getting rid of Bonds, the one
established "name" on the roster, can't help.
To the Yankees' credit, they've recognized
the problem and have done their best to

soothe outraged Murcer fans by giving Bonds
a big publicity buildup. They brought him to
New York last week, posed him in a Yankee
uniform, and made a big deal of giving him
his old number, 25.
The Giants, on the other hand, have
continued their long and glorious tradition of
inept management and disastrous promotion
by not saying a word about Murcer. He'll
arrive here next spring unknown to the fans.
The Giants, though, can take solace in the
fact that they got the better end of the deal.
They'll be a better team with Murcer in the
lineup.
San Francisco newspapers have babbled
idly for quite some time that Bonds is the
"best player in baseball." It's a nice line, but
the statistics prove it's a lie.

voted him into the All-Star game starting
line-up three years in a row.
Likewise Giant fans were generally
favorable to Bonds, in as much as Giant fans
are favorable to anybody.
Neither club can really afford to trade
away an established hero. The Yankees,
through extensive wheeling and dealing the
last couple of years, have dealt away
practically their entire lineup; 13 of 24 men
on the roster this September weren't there
when the season started.
The Giants are also suffering from a severe
case of identity crisis. Since 1971 they've
repeatedly rocked their fans by trading away
all the old heroes Willie McCovey, Juan
Marichal, and, unthinkably, Willie Mays. With
the old names gone Giant fans have felt an
increasing sense of disorientation and the
fact that the team didn't win just made it
worse. Getting rid of Bonds, the one
established "name" on the roster, can't help.
To the Yankees' credit, they've recognized
the problem and have done their best to

soothe outraged Murcer fans by giving Bonds
a big publicity buildup. They brought him to
New York last week, posed him in a Yankee
uniform, and made a big deal of giving him
his old number, 25.
The Giants, on the other hand, have
continued their long and glorious tradition of
inept management and disastrous promotion
by not saying a word about Murcer. He'll
arrive here next spring unknown to the fans.
The Giants, though, can take solace in the
fact that they got the better end of the deal.
They'll be a better team with Murcer in the
lineup.
San Francisco newspapers have babbled
idly for quite some time that Bonds is the
"best player in baseball." It's a nice line, but
the statistics prove it's a lie.
Stats Favor Murcer
His lifetime batting average is just over
.270, and he's never hit .300 over an entire
season. During 1973, when the newspaper
hype was going full speed, Bonds batted .283
and hit 39 home runs. Those are nice figures,
of course, but they represent his all-time top
performance and they just aren't good
enough to rank ahead of Pete Rose, Dick
Allen or a number of other players.
Murcer has proved that he can play with
the top people in the game. Despite all the
talk about Bonds' superb power, he's
averaged only three more homers per season
than Murcer. And Murcer's lifetime batting
average is higher: .279.
If you compute Murcer's average since
1971, when he really hit his stride as a
ballplayer, it's .299.
Murcer drives in an average of 90 runs a
year, as opposed to Bonds' average of 80.
And during the course of his career, Bonds
has struck out over 1000 times, compared to
Murcer's 400. Murcer is a much better
fielder, with several Golden Glove awards to
his credit - and his 21 outfield assists last
year tied a major league record.
The only area where Bonds has a clear
edge over Murcer is base running; he's much
faster. But Murcer is no slouch at stealing
bases.

After adding ih Murcer's statistical
superiority, then figure in the factors thaft
don't lend themselves to numbers like
Bonds' well-known penchant for drinking, or
his refusal to take batting practice with the
rest of the team. Those things will affect his
value to the Yankees just as much as his
ability to hit home runs in Shea Stadium.
When you add them up, they total one
thing: the Yankees got screwed. And when
New Yorkers find out just how badly, their
howls of last week will sound like the
chirping of crickets compared to the ruckus
they'll raise.
Congratulations. If you were alive last
week you watched history in the making.
One of baseball's all-time bonehead deals was
pulled off right here in San Francisco.
Not since the Boston Red Sox sold Babe
Ruth to the Yankees has there been such a
stupid trade. Perhaps the Yanks were feeling
guilty about that one last week when they
sent Bobby Murcer to the Giants for Bobby
Bonds in a one-for-one swap of rightfielders.
Both teams made substantial public
relations errors in trading. And one team got
taken in terms of talent.
Both Bobbys were tops in terms of fan
appeal in their respective towns. The press
has made much of the fact that both men
tried and failed to replace established
superstars in center field. But that was a long
time ago, and really has nothing to do with
this trade.
Acceptance
In recent years, fans in San
Francisco and New York had come to accept
them on their own terms. Murcer was by far
the most popular Yankee, and New Yorkers
voted him into the All-Star game starting
line-up three years in a row.
Likewise Giant fans were generally
favorable to Bonds, in as much as Giant fans
