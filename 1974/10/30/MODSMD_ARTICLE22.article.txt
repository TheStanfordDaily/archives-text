# Hockey Team Routs Cal

### CHARLIE WHEELER 
The Little Big Game between the Stanford
and Cal field hockey teams proved to be
something less than an epic struggle. The
Card varsity massacred the visiting Bears 11-0
yesterday afternoon to retain the Stick for
the third straight year.
The play of both teams was sloppy. It was
surprising that the Cards did not score more
than they did. Stanford was on the attack at
least 90 percent of the time, but there was no
scoring in the opening 27 minutes. In the last
eight minutes of the half, however, Ann
Walker scored twice and Kathy Levinson
once.
In the second half the game turned into a
rout. Stanford scored eight times in a
22-minute stretch. Onnie Killefer scored five
goals, including three in five minutes. Ann
Walker added her third and fourth tallies of
the game and Kathy Levinson knocked in her
second score.
The game was originally scheduled to be
played by the Stanford JV squad, but as it
counted in the conference standings coach
Shirley Schoof took no chances and put the
varsity on the field.
The win gave the Cards an 18-11
advantage in the series. It was the third year
in a row that Stanford has shutout the Bears.
