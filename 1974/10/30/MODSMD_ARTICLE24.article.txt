# Ostrom Surgery Successful
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Junior running back Sig
Ostrom underwent successful
knee surgery Monday, but there
won't be a number 39 in uniform
for Stanford until he returns for
spring practice next year.
Ostrom injured both cartilage
and ligaments in his knee in
Saturday's 20-18 win over
Washington State.
Ostrom had started the last
two games because of Ron Inge's
shoulder injury. /
Inge is set to start Saturday
against Oregon State, but could be
forced to the bench if he's hit in
the shoulder. Joe Baumgaertner,
who played well against WSU, is
listed behind Inge, with either
Marvin Holmes or John Finley
behind him.
The only other new injury
sustained at Pullman was to
flanker Tony Hill, who sprained
the arch in his right foot on the
astroturf. Though the injury has
kept Hill out of practice, he's
expected to play this week.
Rich Waters, who missed the
WSU game with a sprained ankle,
may also see action Saturday.
At the Northern California
Football Writers Association
luncheon yesterday in San
Francisco, Pat Donovan was
named defensive player of the
week. The senior defensive end
got the nod because of two

quarterback sacks among nine
tackles and a forced fumble.
Donovan explained yesterday
the reasons why the Stanford
defense has improved vastly since
the opening games.
"We've been flying around a
little more. At the Penn State
game, we played a little
conservatively and I think we got
into trouble so we played even
more conservatively the next two
weeks.
"At the Michigan game, the
coaches decided to turn things
around and not to worry so much

about keys and reads and things.
They told us to just play a little
more football."
Donovan said that against
WSU, the defensive line finally
caught up with the linebackers
and began playing well.

Cardinal Notes: Geb Church, a
standout against WSU, was
appointed defensive captain for
the week. He'll be joined by firic
Test on offense and Terry Pape,
who'll be special teams
captain .
