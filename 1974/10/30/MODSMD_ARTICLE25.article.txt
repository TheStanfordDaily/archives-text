Hunt Denies Blackmail Charge
WASHINGTON E. Howard Hunt Jr. testified
yesterday that the money demand which former President
Richard M. Nixon viewed as blackmail last year was just an
attempt to collect an overdue bill.
Hunt, testifying at the Watergate cover-up trial, said it
was neither extortion nor blackmail.
Following him on the witness stand was Jeb Stuart
Magruder, who said that former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell once expressed annoyance about the results of
bugs and wiretaps planted at Democratic party
headquarters by agents of the Nixon re-election committee.
Magruder, formerly Mitchell's deputy in the 1972
presidential campaign, said Mitchell told chief Watergate
burglar G. Gordon Liddy "that he was dissatisfied with the
product Liddy was producing from wiretaps and
photographs."
Magruder said Liddy told Mitchell "he was going to
correct the problem."
Asked whether the problem was corrected, Magruder
replied: "Yes. We learned on the morning of June 17 that
Liddy had not corrected the problem but created a
problem."
Ford Drops Energy Head Sawhill
WASHINGTON President Ford announced yesterday
he is dropping Federal Energy Administrator John C.
Sawhill, an outspoken advocate of energy conservation, at
the request of Interior Secretary Rogers C.B. Morton.
Ford said there were no "major policy differences"
involved just "some differences in approach or
technique."
But a spokesman for Friends of the Earth a citizen
environment group, called Sawhill's removal "appalling...
kowtowing to special interests," and said it "signals the end
for a tough regulatory energy conservation program which
could have reduced our dependence on foreign oil and
helped to promote a clean environment."
Ford said he would nominate Andrew E. Gibson, a
former assistant secretary of Commerce and former head of
the Federal Maritime Administration, to replace Sawhill.
Dixy Lee Ray, now head of the Atomic Energy
Commission, will become assistant secretary of state for
international environmental and scientific matters, Ford
said.
Supreme Court Reviews Death Penalty
WASHINGTON The Supreme Court agreed yesterday
to take another look at the death penalty, including
arguments that it is unconstitutional under any
circumstances.
The court will review the case of a North Carolina man
condemned to death for a fatal shooting that followed an
argument over a $lO bill during a dice game.
It will be the first death penalty case the court has heard
since June 29, 1972, when it held that capital punishment
laws then on the books were unconstitutional.
The death penalty case involves James Thurman Fowler,
who was convincted of killing John Griffin last April 10 in
Wake County, N.C.
A decision on it could affect the fate of more than 100

persons in the United States now on death row.
Economy Drop Largest In 23 Years
WASHINGTON â€”'' The government reported yesterday
that its early warning system for the economy registered
the sharpest drop in 23 years in September, raising the
prospect of higher unemployment and idled productive
capacity in the months ahead.
President Ford described his economic program as
adequate to deal with the threat.
The Commerce Department said the decline in its index
of leading indicators was 2.5 percent in September. It
followed a 1.6 percent drop in August and was the biggest
drop since a 2.9 percent dip in June 1951.
The index is made up of a dozen economic factors
selected for their tendency to move in advance of the
economy as a whole. But since eight of the components
involve dollar values for such things as prices, profits or
orders, inflation tends to push the index up even when the
economy slumps.
Britain To Nationalize Key Industries
LONDON Queen Elizabeth II told Parliament
yesterday the Labor government plans to nationalize key
industries, including aviation and oil, in a Socialist bid to
revive Britain's economy.
The queen's address, written for her by Prime Minister
Harold Wilson's Cabinet, said a National Enterprise Board
will be proposed to direct the restructuring and
reorganization of Britain's industries.
She listed shipbuilding and aircraft firms as immediate
candidates for nationalization or state participation and
said a National Oil Corp. will be established to increase
government regulation of the North Sea oil and gas
operations.
Arab Decision Threatens Peace Talks
RABAT, Morocco A decision by Arab leaders to
create an independent Palestinian state under Yasir Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization appeared yesterday to
have doomed the Geneva Middle East peace talks, at least
temporarily.
In an Israeli radio interview from New York,
Information Minister Aharon Yariv denounced the decision
taken at the Arab summit meeting and repeated Israel's vow
not to hand over territory to the PLO.
"There is nothing to talk about at Geneva," he said.
Ali Knocks Out Foreman
KINSHASA, Zaire Muhammad Ali knocked out
George Foreman with a vicious right to the head in the
eighth round of the richest fight ever here this morning and
won back the world heavyweight championship in one of
sport's great accomplishments.
"They took my title away unjustly," said the
32-year-old battler, "and I want to hold on to it for a few
months."
He earned that right in this African nation with a
tremendous performance which came 10 years after Ali had
first won the title by knocking out Sonny Liston and seven
years after he had the title stripped from him for refusing
induction into the United States Army.
The Associated Press had Ali winning six of the eight
rounds, with Foreman winning only the first two.
But Foreman seemed to be winning the eighth round
when Ali backed him into the corner and landed a left and
a right to the head, accomplishing what many thought the
impossible.
Foreman went down, and he could not get back up
before referee Zack Clayton had counted 10.
"I lost the fight, but I was not beaten," said a chastened
Foreman in his dressing room. He said Ali had earned the
title and deserved the respect it carried.
But Ali was not nearly so gracious. "I didn't dance. I
wanted him to lose his power. He punched like a sissy,"
said Ali, whose knockout punch landed with 2:58 gone in
the eighth round.
