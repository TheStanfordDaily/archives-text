# Unruh, Kehoe Contrast Styles In State Treasurer's Contest
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
A skilled practitioner of political
power and a newcomer to state
politics are both vying for the office of
state treasurer in next week's election.
Democrat Jesse Unruh, 53, the
powerful "Big Daddy" who controlled
the state Assembly as its speaker from
1961 to 1969 and who has been on
the outside sinfce, is attempting a
comeback against Republican John
Kehoe, 42, recent state director of
consumer affairs.

Unruh's platform calls for using the
treasurer's office for social change. He
says he also wants to increase its
efficiency.
He advocates "exercising moral
leadership" to assist depressed areas
and hopes to create measures that will
interest banks and other financial
institutions in these areas.

Unruh also pledges to work for
"equal credit rights for all" and "equal
advancement opportunities for all
treasurer's office employees."
Kehoe, who recently switched to
the Republican party, also has made
efficiency a major issue of his
campaign. Referring to his experience
with the state consumer department,
he states, "We must transfer the
principle of consumer protection to
protecting the taxpayer's money."
If elected, he says he intends to
build on the plans of Ivy Baker Priest,
retiring Republican incumbent, for

"effective investment" of state funds.
"By maintaining the highest
possible rating for bonds, and making
investments that result in economic
benefits to all, the treasurer can reduce
the tax burden," Kehoe asserts.
The chief controversy in the
campaign concerns no particular issue,
but centers on each candidate's
experience in business. Kehoe
maintains that Unruh's statements of
being "a businessman and an
economist" are untrue.
He claims that Unruh's only
business connection was with the
defunct Equitable Health Corporation
of America, which was charged by the
state attorney general with
mismanagement and excessive
administrative costs.
"Trying to find a reference to
businessman in Unruh's biography is
mind-boggling," Kehoe states. As
further documentation of his
indictment of Unruh's claims, Kehoe
says that in Unruh's 1973 campaign
for mayor of Los Angeles, Unruh listed
no business experience in his resume.
Yet, Kehoe claims that in "rare
campaign appearances in this
campaign, Unruh has made references
to four years with a health care
corporation."
Unruh disclaims the charges,
declaring that Kehod is
misrepresenting his record. Don
McGrew, Unruh's campaign manager,
says that Unruh only was associated
with Equitable for three months as a
consultant, leaving "when the
president would not accept his advice.
He told them they were in trouble."
McGrew also says that for the past
year, until resigning to run for
treasurer, Unruh had been a vice
president of Pacific Coast Medical
Enterprises.
Besides this dispute, Unruh's
reputation as a controvesial expert
political wheeler-dealer has come
under attack.
Kehoe says, "Jesse Marvin Unruh is
my opponent and need I say more?"
Claiming that Unruh merely wants
this job as a stepping stone to higher
offices, Kehoe says that he could be
"quite confortable with eight good
years as treasurer."
Denying that this is important,
Unruh states, "I'm sick of it. It's
inconsequential to the issues.
"The issues are: Who can handle
the states' investment policies best, sit
down and bargain for the best deal
with the banks [and] who's tough
enough to deal with those guys
[and] ... banks [and] who's tough
enough to deal with those guys
[and] ... with the legislature."
Neither candidate says he expects
to spend more than $200,000, on his
campaign. In the primaries, Unruh
spent $46,848 and Kehoe $17,000,
relatively little for a statewide race.
Unruh, who holds an M.A. in
economics, was elected first to the
state Assembly from Inglewood in
1951. His influence rapidly escalated,
winning him successively finance and
insurance, then ways and means
committee chairmanships.
Through his flamboyant dealing
with pressure groups and lobbyists,
Unruh's control increased until in
1961, he easily mustered enough votes

to elect him Assembly speaker. He
held the position until 1969, when he
resigned to unsuccessfully challenge
Gov. Ronald Reagan in the 1970
election.
Recently he finished third in the
1973 Los Angeles mayoral primary.
Although he intended to run for the
Assembly this year, Unruh changed his
mind when Priest declined to run again
for treasurer because of health reasons.
Kehoe received an M.A. in public
administration from the University of
Michigan. Formerly a democrat, he
served from 1960 to 1966 as
administrative assistant to former Rep.
George D. Miller (D-Calif.), a job which
he left to lobby for the California
State College System in' Washington
and in Sacramento.
In 1969, Reagan hired Kehoe as a
staff educational consultant and by
1972, he had become a Republican, as
well as a legislative secretary under
Reagan. As a secretary he helped
direct major welfare reforms, tax relief
measures and educational finance
through the legislature.
Reagan named him state director of
consumer affairs in 1972. In this i
capacity, Kehoe was the recipient of
some criticism complaining that he
was too soft on business.
His supporters maintain that due to
the pro-business outlook of the
administration, Kehoe has to move
cautiously. They say that his function
was to help the consumer make
decisions in the market place, not to
dictate policy.
As things now stand, Unruh sees his
chances of winning as excellent,
pointing out that "it's most likely to
be a Democratic year." The polls
corroborate his optimistic prediction,
awarding him about a 10 percent
margin.

of America, which was charged by the
state attorney general with
mismanagement and excessive
administrative costs.
"Trying to find a reference to
businessman in Unruh's biography is
mind-boggling," Kehoe states. As
further documentation of his
indictment of Unruh's claims, Kehoe
says that in Unruh's 1973 campaign
for mayor of Los Angeles, Unruh listed
no business experience in his resume.
Yet, Kehoe claims that in "rare
campaign appearances in this
campaign, Unruh has made references
to four years with a health care
corporation."
Unruh disclaims the charges,
declaring that Kehod is
misrepresenting his record. Don
McGrew, Unruh's campaign manager,
says that Unruh only was associated
with Equitable for three months as a
consultant, leaving "when the
president would not accept his advice.
He told them they were in trouble."
McGrew also says that for the past
year, until resigning to run for
treasurer, Unruh had been a vice
president of Pacific Coast Medical
Enterprises.
Besides this dispute, Unruh's
reputation as a controvesial expert
political wheeler-dealer has come
under attack.
Kehoe says, "Jesse Marvin Unruh is
my opponent and need I say more?"
Claiming that Unruh merely wants
this job as a stepping stone to higher
offices, Kehoe says that he could be
"quite confortable with eight good
years as treasurer."
Denying that this is important,
Unruh states, "I'm sick of it. It's
inconsequential to the issues.
"The issues are: Who can handle
the states' investment policies best, sit
down and bargain for the best deal
with the banks [and] who's tough
enough to deal with those guys
[and] ... banks [and] who's tough
enough to deal with those guys
[and] ... with the legislature."
Neither candidate says he expects
to spend more than $200,000, on his
campaign. In the primaries, Unruh
spent $46,848 and Kehoe $17,000,
relatively little for a statewide race.
Unruh, who holds an M.A. in
economics, was elected first to the
state Assembly from Inglewood in
1951. His influence rapidly escalated,
winning him successively finance and
insurance, then ways and means
committee chairmanships.
Through his flamboyant dealing
with pressure groups and lobbyists,
Unruh's control increased until in
1961, he easily mustered enough votes

to elect him Assembly speaker. He
held the position until 1969, when he
resigned to unsuccessfully challenge
Gov. Ronald Reagan in the 1970
election.
Recently he finished third in the
1973 Los Angeles mayoral primary.
Although he intended to run for the
Assembly this year, Unruh changed his
mind when Priest declined to run again
for treasurer because of health reasons.
Kehoe received an M.A. in public
administration from the University of
Michigan. Formerly a democrat, he
served from 1960 to 1966 as
administrative assistant to former Rep.
George D. Miller (D-Calif.), a job which
he left to lobby for the California
State College System in' Washington
and in Sacramento.
In 1969, Reagan hired Kehoe as a
staff educational consultant and by
1972, he had become a Republican, as
well as a legislative secretary under
Reagan. As a secretary he helped
direct major welfare reforms, tax relief
measures and educational finance
through the legislature.
Reagan named him state director of
consumer affairs in 1972. In this i
capacity, Kehoe was the recipient of
some criticism complaining that he
was too soft on business.
His supporters maintain that due to
the pro-business outlook of the
administration, Kehoe has to move
cautiously. They say that his function
was to help the consumer make
decisions in the market place, not to
dictate policy.
As things now stand, Unruh sees his
chances of winning as excellent,
pointing out that "it's most likely to
be a Democratic year." The polls
corroborate his optimistic prediction,
awarding him about a 10 percent
margin.
A skilled practitioner of political
power and a newcomer to state
politics are both vying for the office of
state treasurer in next week's election.
Democrat Jesse Unruh, 53, the
powerful "Big Daddy" who controlled
the state Assembly as its speaker from
1961 to 1969 and who has been on
the outside sinfce, is attempting a
comeback against Republican John
Kehoe, 42, recent state director of
consumer affairs.

Unruh's platform calls for using the
treasurer's office for social change. He
says he also wants to increase its
efficiency.
He advocates "exercising moral
leadership" to assist depressed areas
and hopes to create measures that will
interest banks and other financial
institutions in these areas.

Unruh also pledges to work for
"equal credit rights for all" and "equal
advancement opportunities for all
treasurer's office employees."
Kehoe, who recently switched to
the Republican party, also has made
efficiency a major issue of his
campaign. Referring to his experience
with the state consumer department,
he states, "We must transfer the
principle of consumer protection to
protecting the taxpayer's money."
If elected, he says he intends to
build on the plans of Ivy Baker Priest,
retiring Republican incumbent, for

"effective investment" of state funds.
"By maintaining the highest
possible rating for bonds, and making
investments that result in economic
benefits to all, the treasurer can reduce
the tax burden," Kehoe asserts.
The chief controversy in the
campaign concerns no particular issue,
but centers on each candidate's
experience in business. Kehoe
maintains that Unruh's statements of

enough to deal with those guys
[and] ... with the legislature."
Neither candidate says he expects
to spend more than $200,000, on his
campaign. In the primaries, Unruh
spent $46,848 and Kehoe $17,000,
relatively little for a statewide race.
Unruh, who holds an M.A. in
economics, was elected first to the
state Assembly from Inglewood in
1951. His influence rapidly escalated,
winning him successively finance and
insurance, then ways and means
committee chairmanships.
Through his flamboyant dealing
with pressure groups and lobbyists,
Unruh's control increased until in
1961, he easily mustered enough votes

to elect him Assembly speaker. He
held the position until 1969, when he
resigned to unsuccessfully challenge
Gov. Ronald Reagan in the 1970
election.
Recently he finished third in the
1973 Los Angeles mayoral primary.
Although he intended to run for the
Assembly this year, Unruh changed his
mind when Priest declined to run again
for treasurer because of health reasons.
Kehoe received an M.A. in public
administration from the University of
Michigan. Formerly a democrat, he
served from 1960 to 1966 as
administrative assistant to former Rep.
George D. Miller (D-Calif.), a job which
he left to lobby for the California
State College System in' Washington
and in Sacramento.
In 1969, Reagan hired Kehoe as a
staff educational consultant and by
1972, he had become a Republican, as
well as a legislative secretary under
Reagan. As a secretary he helped
direct major welfare reforms, tax relief
measures and educational finance
through the legislature.
Reagan named him state director of
consumer affairs in 1972. In this i
capacity, Kehoe was the recipient of
some criticism complaining that he
was too soft on business.
His supporters maintain that due to
the pro-business outlook of the
administration, Kehoe has to move
cautiously. They say that his function
was to help the consumer make
decisions in the market place, not to
dictate policy.
As things now stand, Unruh sees his
chances of winning as excellent,
pointing out that "it's most likely to
be a Democratic year." The polls
corroborate his optimistic prediction,
awarding him about a 10 percent
margin.
A skilled practitioner of political
power and a newcomer to state
politics are both vying for the office of
state treasurer in next week's election.
Democrat Jesse Unruh, 53, the
powerful "Big Daddy" who controlled
the state Assembly as its speaker from
1961 to 1969 and who has been on
the outside sinfce, is attempting a
comeback against Republican John
Kehoe, 42, recent state director of
consumer affairs.

Unruh's platform calls for using the
treasurer's office for social change. He
says he also wants to increase its
efficiency.
He advocates "exercising moral
leadership" to assist depressed areas
and hopes to create measures that will
interest banks and other financial
institutions in these areas.

Unruh also pledges to work for
"equal credit rights for all" and "equal
advancement opportunities for all
treasurer's office employees."
Kehoe, who recently switched to
the Republican party, also has made
efficiency a major issue of his
campaign. Referring to his experience
with the state consumer department,
he states, "We must transfer the
principle of consumer protection to
protecting the taxpayer's money."
If elected, he says he intends to
build on the plans of Ivy Baker Priest,
retiring Republican incumbent, for

"effective investment" of state funds.
"By maintaining the highest
possible rating for bonds, and making
investments that result in economic
benefits to all, the treasurer can reduce
the tax burden," Kehoe asserts.
The chief controversy in the
campaign concerns no particular issue,
but centers on each candidate's
experience in business. Kehoe
maintains that Unruh's statements of
being "a businessman and an
economist" are untrue.
He claims that Unruh's only
business connection was with the
defunct Equitable Health Corporation
of America, which was charged by the
state attorney general with
mismanagement and excessive
administrative costs.
"Trying to find a reference to
businessman in Unruh's biography is
mind-boggling," Kehoe states. As
further documentation of his
indictment of Unruh's claims, Kehoe
says that in Unruh's 1973 campaign
for mayor of Los Angeles, Unruh listed
no business experience in his resume.
Yet, Kehoe claims that in "rare
campaign appearances in this
campaign, Unruh has made references
to four years with a health care
corporation."
Unruh disclaims the charges,
declaring that Kehod is
misrepresenting his record. Don
McGrew, Unruh's campaign manager,
says that Unruh only was associated
with Equitable for three months as a
consultant, leaving "when the
president would not accept his advice.
He told them they were in trouble."
McGrew also says that for the past
year, until resigning to run for
treasurer, Unruh had been a vice
president of Pacific Coast Medical
Enterprises.
Besides this dispute, Unruh's
reputation as a controvesial expert
political wheeler-dealer has come
under attack.
Kehoe says, "Jesse Marvin Unruh is
my opponent and need I say more?"
Claiming that Unruh merely wants
this job as a stepping stone to higher
offices, Kehoe says that he could be
"quite confortable with eight good
years as treasurer."
Denying that this is important,
Unruh states, "I'm sick of it. It's
inconsequential to the issues.
"The issues are: Who can handle
the states' investment policies best, sit
down and bargain for the best deal
with the banks [and] who's tough
enough to deal with those guys
[and] ... banks [and] who's tough
enough to deal with those guys
