# Nixon Remains Stable, Critical After Surgery
## 
### 
LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) Former
President Richard M. Nixon was in
critical but stable condition last night
after going into shock for three hours
following surgery for phlebitis.
"I know the doctors are worried,"
said a source close to the situation
when asked about Nixon's chances of
survival.
Nixon is under the care of specially
trained nurses.
President Ford said he was praying
for Nixon's recovery.
Through Night
Dr. Eldon Hickman, who
performed Nixon's surgery which had
been described as successful during the
day, planned to stay with Nixon
through the night.
Nixon's personal physician, John C.
Lungren, said in a statement that

Nixon's blood pressure which fell
when apparent postsurgical bleeding
triggered the shock "was stable now.
His vascular system is also stable."
But he added that Nixon had a
"somewhat elevated pulse rate" and a
low fever.
Specialized Nurses
"He is under the care of specialized,
intensive care nurses and his surgeon,
Dr. Eldon Hickman, is remaining near
him for the night," Lungren said.
Nixon's youngest daughter, Julie
Nixon Eisenhower, arrived at the
hospital about 8 p.m. She had flown
to Long Beach from her home in
Washington, D.C.
She had no comment to newsmen
as she entered a rear entrance
accompanied by two men.
Tricia Nixon Cox, Nixon's other

daughter, said earlier in New York
City that she planned to fly to the
hospital. Nixon's wife, Pat, and his
former White House secretary, Rose
Mary Woods, came to the hospital
shortly after Nixon underwent
surgery.
The Nixon family left the hospital
for their San Clemente house late last
night.
Transfusions
Nixon has received blood
transfusions, although the quantity
was not revealed. Treatment of
Nixon's kind of shock usually involves
giving massive amounts of bloodâ€”from
seven to nine pints.
Telephone calls from across the
nation were flooding the switchboard
at Memorial Hospital Medical Center,
with "the callers offering their
personal best wishes and sympathies,"
said a hospital spokesman.
The spokesman said many callers
offered to donate blood to the former
president.
Personal Concern
President Ford "expressed his deep
personal concern for the former
president's health and said he prayed
for Mr. Nixon's full recovery."
White House Press Secretary Ron
Nessen told newsmen returning to
Washington with Ford after a trip to
Michigan.
Nessen said Ford was told of
Nixon's condition by White House
physician William Lukash during the
visit. Nessen also said Ford had no
plans to visit Nixon while in Los
Angeles during a campaign appearance
tomorrow.
Nixon's two married daughters
arrived from the East Coast only
minutes before Lungren's statement.
Top Floor Room
Nixon's top floor room is part of a
newly completed intensive care unit.
Nixon was originally put there for his
security and privacy.
Earlier, Lungren said when Nixon
went into shock a team of physicians
administered "countershock measures
for three hours until a stable vascular
condition was once again restored.
"The patient is still considered
critical," he said.
Lungren said the serious
complication was probably caused by
"some retro-peritonaeal bleeding
secondary to anticoagulation
therapy."
The physician had said earlier that
there was "somewhat more risk than
normal" to the surgery because Nixon
had been taking anticoagulant drugs
which left him prone to uncontrolled
bleeding.
Lungren said after the surgery that
was no excessive bleeding.
"Replacement of blood loss and
relaxation of anti-coagulation therapy
was instituted," Lungren said.
After surgery, Nixon was described
as "doing well" and making a normal
recovery.
Nixon went into shock about 12:45
p.m., more than six hours after
surgery, Lungren said.
