# Assistant Chapel Dean Seeks Communication
## 
### MARTHA ADAMS 
"I want to be available to anyone
that needs someone to talk to," says
Wendy Smith, the new assistant dean
of the chapel, appointed September 1.
"What they talk about doesn't
necessarily have to be religious."
Smith says she hopes to visit all
campus dormitories and living groups,
preferably at meal time so she can
meet and chat more with students.
"I haven't had as many
opportunities to get to know the
students as I would like," Smith, an
adviser for eight freshmen says. "The
times that I have been able to eat
meals in the dorm I've enjoyed; so I
would look forward to specific
invitations from people."
Her job as assistant dean also
includes preaching in Memorial Church
occasionally, helping with
administration and counseling. She

also serves as coordinator for the
United Campus Ministries, keeping in
touch with all faiths as a liaison
person.
New Approaches
"Since we are not bound by
denominational restrictions, I think
Memorial Church is in a position to try
some of the newer approaches to
Christian education."
She says she would like to start a
Christian education program for the
children of those who attend Memorial
Church regularly.,
"Another thing that I've been
thinking about doing, but I'm not sure
I will yet, is offering an Undergraduate
Special course that would give a
general introduction to Christianity
winter quarter," she says.
The course would teach general
concepts of Christianity, the
Sacraments and the Bible, she notes.

She says she is also interested in
"working with small groups of people
in dorms or at Memorial Church in
Bible study, and prayer groups.
Candidate For Ordination
Smith, who is a candidate for
ordination as a deacon in the
Episcopal Church, says, "the job
outlook is very, very poor now. There
are four women deacons in the
Diocese of California, and none of
them are employed.
"Whether or not I can get a job will
depend on whether there is a parish
willing to have a woman serving them.
As a deacon I will be serving as an
assistant," she adds.
The Episcopal Church has only had
ordained women since 1970, and very
few people in the church have seen
them, Smith says.
"Usually I'm the first woman
deacon people have seen," she says.
"Their expectations in advance seem

to be a very masculine woman, and
then they are surprised to see me."
In addition to her religious pursuits,
she is also a candidate for a doctoral
degree in counseling psychology at the
University of Washington, where she
has completed all but her dissertation.
While in Seattle, she was an
instructor in New Testament at the
Huston School of Theology and served
as youth director for St. Stephen's
Parish.
She is a 1968 graduate of Scripps
College in Southern California, where
she was a pupil of Chapel Dean Robert
G. Hamerton-Kelly, and she also holds
an M.A. in theological studies from
Harvard Divinity School.
Smith, who arrived early in
September has a three-year
appointment at Stanford. She replaces
Dianne Kenney, who has resigned to
pursue graduate study under a
Danforth fellowship.
