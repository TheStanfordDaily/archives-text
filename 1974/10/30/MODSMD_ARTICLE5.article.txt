# Van Camp, Fong Exchange Accusations
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
With both candidates holding similar positions
on the main political issues, the race for secretary
of state has become highly personalized this
month as the candidates exchange accusations.
Republican candidate Brian Van Camp,
California corporations commissioner under the
Reagan administration, has accused the
Democratic candidate, Assemblywoman March
Fong, of using state stationery and phone
services in operating a private travel agency in
1972.
Fong said she had a travel agency two years
ago, but denied using state funds to operate it.
She called Van Camp's charge "a cheap political
shot" and accused Van Camp of "trying to shift
attention" from a $l3 million suit which she says
has been brought against him.
Citing the state auditor general's Oct. 9
report, Fong charged that the corporations office
lost about $250,000 a year while Van Camp was
corporations commissioner.
Van Camp said he had 19 memos in .
Fong's "own handwriting" instructing an
employee to use state facilities for travel agency
business, as well as an affidavit from this
employee. He said he also had a copy of a letter
written by Fong on state stationery inviting
someone to accompany her on a trip to China.
Fong said the employee had been dismissed
by the manager of the travel agency for
"misconduct and disobedience" and was
obviously "disgruntled" because she was unable
to get unemployment insurance, although she
appealed twice. Fong said the employee was
"fabricating stories."
Fong said the Assembly letterheads were
printed at her own expense. However, the
statement noting this fact was left off some of

the letterhead stationery. She said she was never
told that the stationery without this statement
was used.
Van Camp has refuted both of Fong's charges.
Although the Sacramento Bee reported that the
libel suit was filed, Van Camp said he had not
been contacted.
He said the men who reportedly filed the suit
were convicted two years ago and turned down
by the District Court of Appeals.
'Groundless' Suit
The suit if "groundless" and like "99 percent"
of similiar cases, it "will be dismissed as soon as
it's filed," Van Camp predicted.
The auditor's report was also in error, Van
Camp declared. "Every year... we made $3
million more than we spent," he said.
He noted that the research for the Oct. 9
report had been conducted back in January. It is
"typical of the shabby campaign tricks that this
woman is playing," Van Camp said, noting that
the charges only arose this month.
Debates
Van Camp has also charged that Fong "has
refused to publicly debate" him and has not
appeared at 10 scheduled debates.
However, Fong said she missed only one, and
that was because of a strike in the studio. She
would not cross the picket lines.
Van Camp also accuses Fong of taking
advantage of the free travel and phone services
that go with her office.
Van Camp said that, unlike Fong, he resigned
his office because he "wanted no question"
about whether he was running his own campaign.
As secretary of state, Van Camp said he would
push for legislation that would cut back the big
advantage incumbent office holders now hold
over challengers who don't have the publicity

and funds of public office.
'Absolutely False'
Fong dismissed this charge as "absolutely
false," and said it was an effort by Van Camp "to
become known" at the beginning of the
campaign when few people had heard of him.
Both candidates have expressed admiration
for Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s
reactivation of the formerly low-profile secretary
of state's office.
However, Van Camp said he thought Brown
had politicized the office too much. He said it is
inappropriate for the state's top election official
to be selected on a partisan basis.
Van Camp said he would seek a constitutional
amendment making the office a bipartisan one
similar to the office of the state superintendent
of public schools.
, Bipartisan Offices
Fong said she would support this proposal
only if the offices of the controller, treasurer and
attorney general are made bipartisan as well.
"Until all four are nonpartisan, it makes no
sense to have just one" that way, she said.
As secretary of state, Fong said she intends to
"continue an active style" and "respond to the
people's needs."
On election reform, both candidates are
proposing that a statewide computerized system
of voter registration by adopted to prevent
multiple registrations at the county level.
Neither candidate believes in giving public
funds to policital candidates to use as they
please.
Fong was a strong supporter of the fair
campaign law, Proposition 9. Van Camp said he
had opposed the law because he considered it
weaker than laws already made, but that he
would enforce it now that it is law.
