## Propositions 
### 
Prop. 15 (Low Rent Housing) YES
Local governments should have the option of conducting a
referendum on low income housing projects. This proposition would
abolish a state provision requiring referendums any time suchx a
project is proposed, a cumbersome and costly procedure. This
proposition will in no way interfere with the right of a locality to vote
on how to spend local funds in regard to low income housing.
Prop. 16 (UC Tuition) YES
The legislature, not the Board of Regents, should be empowered to
determine the amount of tuition charged students at the University of
California. Matters of public policy and taxation should be resolved
by elected representatives. The legislature already has the authority
for the State College and University System and for community
colleges.
Prop. 17 (Stanislaus River Dam) YES
Aside from the aesthetic repugnance of piling 62 stories of rock
and concrete in the middle of one of the most popular Whitewater
recreation rivers in the West, the economic justification for building
the $260 million dam is seriously in doubt.
There is no massive projected need for the dam water for irrigation
in the region and there are numerous lakes in the immediate vicinity
of the dam site for recreation purposes.
A smaller dam could easily provide the needed flood control
capacity, irrigation requirements and water quality needs without
inundating the scenic Stanislaus. Though construction has already
started, the public will easily lose more money in the long run if thy
project is not stopped.
Victor Calvo
We endorse Santa Clara County Supervisor Victor Calvo in the race
for the 21st Assembly District.
In over 15 years of local government experience as Planning
Commissioner, councilman, Mountain View mayor and county
supervisor, Calvo has provided sound leadership. He helped establish
Santa Clara County's Consumer Affairs Department, as well as leading
a successful effort to achieve a county park acquisition fund and
continually fighting for environmental preservation.
His Republican opponent, Clarence A. Jackson Jr., is a capable
candidate who has received seemingly contradictory endorsements
from Sen. Edward Brooke (R-Mass.), Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park), Gov. Ronald Reagan and Gordon Knapp,
McCloskey's conservative opponent in last June's 12th Congressional
District Republican primary. Jackson has been instrumental in the
formation of the East Palo Alto Municipal Council for the
unincorporated area of East Palo Alto.
On the whole, however, we feel that Calvo's vast experience in
local government and his commitment to such concepts as campaign
reform, improvement of public transportation systems and housing
and community development make him the strongest candidate in the
21 st Assembly District.

Local governments should have the option of conducting a
referendum on low income housing projects. This proposition would
abolish a state provision requiring referendums any time suchx a
project is proposed, a cumbersome and costly procedure. This
proposition will in no way interfere with the right of a locality to vote
on how to spend local funds in regard to low income housing.
Prop. 16 (UC Tuition) YES
The legislature, not the Board of Regents, should be empowered to
determine the amount of tuition charged students at the University of
California. Matters of public policy and taxation should be resolved
by elected representatives. The legislature already has the authority
for the State College and University System and for community
colleges.
Prop. 17 (Stanislaus River Dam) YES
Aside from the aesthetic repugnance of piling 62 stories of rock
and concrete in the middle of one of the most popular Whitewater
recreation rivers in the West, the economic justification for building
the $260 million dam is seriously in doubt.
There is no massive projected need for the dam water for irrigation
in the region and there are numerous lakes in the immediate vicinity
of the dam site for recreation purposes.
A smaller dam could easily provide the needed flood control
capacity, irrigation requirements and water quality needs without
inundating the scenic Stanislaus. Though construction has already
started, the public will easily lose more money in the long run if thy
project is not stopped.
Victor Calvo
We endorse Santa Clara County Supervisor Victor Calvo in the race
for the 21st Assembly District.
In over 15 years of local government experience as Planning
Commissioner, councilman, Mountain View mayor and county
supervisor, Calvo has provided sound leadership. He helped establish
Santa Clara County's Consumer Affairs Department, as well as leading
a successful effort to achieve a county park acquisition fund and
continually fighting for environmental preservation.
His Republican opponent, Clarence A. Jackson Jr., is a capable
candidate who has received seemingly contradictory endorsements
from Sen. Edward Brooke (R-Mass.), Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park), Gov. Ronald Reagan and Gordon Knapp,
McCloskey's conservative opponent in last June's 12th Congressional
District Republican primary. Jackson has been instrumental in the
formation of the East Palo Alto Municipal Council for the
unincorporated area of East Palo Alto.
On the whole, however, we feel that Calvo's vast experience in
local government and his commitment to such concepts as campaign
reform, improvement of public transportation systems and housing
and community development make him the strongest candidate in the
21 st Assembly District.
Prop. 15 (Low Rent Housing) YES
Local governments should have the option of conducting a
referendum on low income housing projects. This proposition would
abolish a state provision requiring referendums any time suchx a
project is proposed, a cumbersome and costly procedure. This
proposition will in no way interfere with the right of a locality to vote
