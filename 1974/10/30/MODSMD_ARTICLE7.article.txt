# More On Grades
## 
### Elise Rose 
Stanford students have high
GPAs.
This fact in itself should be
neither surprising nor upsetting,
considering the nature of and the
criteria for entering this
institution. When I arrived at
Stanford, I was told that people
here are smarter than people
elsewhere. I do not know if this is
so, but if it is, no one should be
upset that a statistic confirms that
fact.
Apparently, however, Stanford
professors are upset. They find
the situation "ludicrous," they
"react with alarm" and worry that
the "meaning" of grades is being
destroyed. In an unfortunately
unisolated incident, one of my
professors announced in class that
he was planning to "do something
about it."
I address the remainder of this
column to Stanford professors.
First, exactly what are grades? Are
they a measure of what is learned
in a class? Are they a means of
stimulating competition and
therefore work and effort? Ask
yourselves do the students who
get As in your classes work? Do
they learn?
Why Give Fewer?
If so, why is there a need to
give fewer As? If a student
completes the required amount of
work with creativity, effort and

ability, should he not be given his
due what, in a sense, he
contracted for in taking the
course?
If your students are good
students and you decide to give
fewer As for the arbitrary reason
of the results of a survey, then
you are punishing them because
of a statistic. It is even more than
this. Better work results not in
reward but in what can be
construed only as punishment.
Grades become an end in
themselves, necessarily contingent
not on the individual but on the
group. Any value the grade might
have had, as initiative, as reward,
becomes instead even more of a
medium of exchange for a given
correct response.
One might condemn students
for responding like cattle to the
herding of professors until it is
seen what an unfightable
institution is being created and
sustained here. Grades are
important, and so often for the
wrong reasons. You have made
that so.
Teachers, you of the most
honored profession if you set
up an evaluation criterion on
competition and statistics alone, if
you make that evaluation an end
in itself, as you so often do, you
are, indeed, not giving knowledge,
but peddling sugar candy.
