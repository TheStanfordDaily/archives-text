Anatomy of a Root
Fine Canadian Leathers
The soft skins are naturally
finished, not "corrected"
by chemical additives. Inside,
Roots are lined with even
softer leather for even
greater comfort. All Roots are
crafted by Canadian Cobblers
who feel that a product made
mostly by hand will still do
the most for your feet.
Rocker Sole
In a natural stride, weight
moves from the heel, along
the outer side of the foot
then diagonally across to the
big toe, which springs you off
on your next step, Roots
rocker sole helps this shift in
on your next step. Roots
rocker sole helps this shift in
weight, making every foot
step just a little less tiring.
Supported Arch
The city sidewalk can be a
real arch-enemy. And fallen
arches hurt. Roots are con
toured to support the arch
and the small recess between
the balls of your feet,

Recessed Heel
Walk on sand and your heel
will leave the deepest part of
your footprint. In natural
walking, most of your weight
lands on your heel. Conven
tional shoes-even lo\y
heeled shoes-tilt you forward
and change your basic pos
ture. In Roots, your heel sinks
into a comfortable recess,
giving you a natural walk on
any kind of surface.
