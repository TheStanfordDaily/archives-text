# Upcoming Election May Signal Major Changes For Democrats
## 
### STEPHEN M. SOBLE News Analysis 
Despite what the political pundits
say, next Tuesday's mid-term elections
may signal major changes ahead for
the Democratic Party. Most observers
agree that the Democrats are on the
verge of a landslide victory.
The routine analysis runs something
like this. The Republicans, haunted by
Nixonian scandals, economic crisis and
a wave of voter apathy are bound to
lose marginal House and Senate seats
to Democrats across the country.
Such a readjustment of party power
is a natural result of the electoral
process. A fundamental realignment of
the major parties is not indicated, or
so the traditional wisdom goes.
This analysis overemphasizes the
effects of voter backlash and fails to
examine the dynamics of Democratic
Party politics in 1974.
Lawrence F. O'Brien former
National Democratic Party Chairman,
wrote in The New York Times
recently that the task facing the
Democrats is how to build a party that
can win the presidency in 1976. In
order to accomplish this, Democrats
are searching in this election for new
talent, a sound organizational base and
a new coalition of support.

New Democratic talent is
blossoming in every section of the
country. Here in the West, Democratic
frontrunners Edmund G. Brown Jr.
Colorado U.S. Senate candidate Gary
Hart, are already national figures.
Competition For Prominence
The Midwestern competition for
party prominence is so fierce that in
Wisconsin, for example, analysts have
taken for granted the re-election of
Democratic Gov. Patrick Lucey and
Democratic U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson.
The key question now is who will roll
up the larger statewide vote. Both
Lucey and Nelson are experienced
liberal Democrats who are rumored to
have national aspirations.
In Ohio, a similar battle for
prestiege is being waged between
Democratic Gov. John Gilligan and
Democratic U.S. Senate hopeful John
Glenn, both of whom are leading in
the polls.
In addition to George Wallace, who
will easily win re-election as governor
of Alabama, the South offers to the

national scene Gov. Dale Bumpers,
who defeated Sen. J. William
Fulbright, in a primary last spring.
Inflation, Busing, McGovern
Inflation, the school busing issue
and perhaps Massachusetts pride in
having gone for George McGovern in
1972 signal defeat for Republican
Gov. Francis Sargent. Democratic
challenger Michael Dukakis has gained
national exposure on public television
as host of the program The Advocates.
He may dispel the belief that the only
Democrats from Massachusetts are
named Kennedy.
Considering that the Democrats
already have senators Henry Jackson,
Walter Mondale, Lloyd Bentsen and
William Proxmire eying the top spot
on their party's 1976 ticket, an

abundance of new aspirants may cause
organizational nightmares for the
Democrats at their 1976 Convention.
According to the new party rules,
delegate selection must strive to
represent women and minorities
equitably. And as the rules stand,
every presidential contender who is
able to muster 15 percent of the vote
in a given congressional district during
the 1976 primary is entitled to at least
one delegate to the convention.
More Open Convention
This augers well for a more open
Democratic Convention in 1976, but
increases the party power of the
diverse Democratic congressional
candidates who are expected be swept
into office next week.
Organizationally, the election of
Democratic governors may prove to be
a real dividend to the party this fall.
On the one hand, Democratic
governors may be able to use their
position to inhibit extreme party
factionalization within- 'their states,
and on the other, they will be able to
provide the eventual 1976 presidential
candidate with a ready-made base of
support and active party workers.
It now appears the Democrats will
' win the statehouse in vote-heavy
states being contested this fall.
Besides searching for new talent
and strategic improvements in
statehouses, the Democrats are also
groping to find a new coalition of
nationwide support.
In New York, Democrat Hugh
Carey has effectively taken his
gubernatorial campaign to the
beleagured suburban taxpayer. He has
stressed the need for more efficient
programs dealing with law and order,
mental health, public transportation,
pollution control and consumer
protection.
By speaking directly to middle-class
concerns Carey has seriously eroded
traditional Republican support in
affluent suburban Nassau and Suffolk
counties.
The real test of Democratic
durability in middle-class areas may be
seen in three bellweather congressional
races. They are: Ohio 23rd district,
Minshal-R vs. Kucinich-D, New York
35th district, Barber Conable-R vs.
Midge Costanaza-D and Virginia 10th
district, Joel Broyhill Fisher-D. In all
of these races Republican incumbents
face stiff opposition from liberal
Democrats.

equitably. And as the rules stand,
every presidential contender who is
able to muster 15 percent of the vote
in a given congressional district during
the 1976 primary is entitled to at least
one delegate to the convention.
More Open Convention
This augers well for a more open
Democratic Convention in 1976, but
increases the party power of the
diverse Democratic congressional
candidates who are expected be swept
into office next week.
Organizationally, the election of
Democratic governors may prove to be
a real dividend to the party this fall.
On the one hand, Democratic
governors may be able to use their
position to inhibit extreme party
factionalization within- 'their states,
and on the other, they will be able to
provide the eventual 1976 presidential
candidate with a ready-made base of
support and active party workers.
It now appears the Democrats will
' win the statehouse in vote-heavy
states being contested this fall.
Besides searching for new talent
and strategic improvements in
statehouses, the Democrats are also
groping to find a new coalition of
nationwide support.
In New York, Democrat Hugh
Carey has effectively taken his
gubernatorial campaign to the
beleagured suburban taxpayer. He has
stressed the need for more efficient
programs dealing with law and order,
mental health, public transportation,
pollution control and consumer
protection.
By speaking directly to middle-class
concerns Carey has seriously eroded
traditional Republican support in
affluent suburban Nassau and Suffolk
counties.
The real test of Democratic
durability in middle-class areas may be
seen in three bellweather congressional
races. They are: Ohio 23rd district,
Minshal-R vs. Kucinich-D, New York
35th district, Barber Conable-R vs.
Midge Costanaza-D and Virginia 10th
district, Joel Broyhill Fisher-D. In all
of these races Republican incumbents
face stiff opposition from liberal
Democrats.
Despite what the political pundits
say, next Tuesday's mid-term elections
may signal major changes ahead for
the Democratic Party. Most observers
agree that the Democrats are on the
verge of a landslide victory.
The routine analysis runs something
like this. The Republicans, haunted by
Nixonian scandals, economic crisis and
a wave of voter apathy are bound to
lose marginal House and Senate seats
to Democrats across the country.
Such a readjustment of party power
is a natural result of the electoral
process. A fundamental realignment of
the major parties is not indicated, or
so the traditional wisdom goes.
This analysis overemphasizes the
effects of voter backlash and fails to
examine the dynamics of Democratic
Party politics in 1974.
Lawrence F. O'Brien former
National Democratic Party Chairman,
wrote in The New York Times
recently that the task facing the
Democrats is how to build a party that
can win the presidency in 1976. In
order to accomplish this, Democrats
are searching in this election for new
talent, a sound organizational base and
a new coalition of support.

New Democratic talent is
blossoming in every section of the
country. Here in the West, Democratic
frontrunners Edmund G. Brown Jr.
Colorado U.S. Senate candidate Gary
Hart, are already national figures.
Competition For Prominence
The Midwestern competition for
party prominence is so fierce that in
Wisconsin, for example, analysts have
taken for granted the re-election of
Democratic Gov. Patrick Lucey and
Democratic U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson.
The key question now is who will roll
up the larger statewide vote. Both
Lucey and Nelson are experienced
liberal Democrats who are rumored to
have national aspirations.
In Ohio, a similar battle for
prestiege is being waged between
Democratic Gov. John Gilligan and
Democratic U.S. Senate hopeful John
Glenn, both of whom are leading in
the polls.
In addition to George Wallace, who
will easily win re-election as governor
of Alabama, the South offers to the

national scene Gov. Dale Bumpers,
who defeated Sen. J. William
Fulbright, in a primary last spring.
Inflation, Busing, McGovern
Inflation, the school busing issue
and perhaps Massachusetts pride in
having gone for George McGovern in
1972 signal defeat for Republican
Gov. Francis Sargent. Democratic
challenger Michael Dukakis has gained
national exposure on public television
as host of the program The Advocates.
He may dispel the belief that the only
Democrats from Massachusetts are
named Kennedy.
Considering that the Democrats
already have senators Henry Jackson,
Walter Mondale, Lloyd Bentsen and
William Proxmire eying the top spot
on their party's 1976 ticket, an

abundance of new aspirants may cause
organizational nightmares for the
Democrats at their 1976 Convention.

are searching in this election for new
talent, a sound organizational base and
a new coalition of support.

New Democratic talent is
blossoming in every section of the
country. Here in the West, Democratic
frontrunners Edmund G. Brown Jr.
Colorado U.S. Senate candidate Gary
Hart, are already national figures.
Competition For Prominence
The Midwestern competition for
party prominence is so fierce that in
Wisconsin, for example, analysts have
taken for granted the re-election of
Democratic Gov. Patrick Lucey and
Democratic U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson.
The key question now is who will roll
up the larger statewide vote. Both
Lucey and Nelson are experienced
liberal Democrats who are rumored to
have national aspirations.
In Ohio, a similar battle for
prestiege is being waged between
Democratic Gov. John Gilligan and
Democratic U.S. Senate hopeful John
Glenn, both of whom are leading in
the polls.
In addition to George Wallace, who
will easily win re-election as governor
of Alabama, the South offers to the

national scene Gov. Dale Bumpers,
who defeated Sen. J. William
Fulbright, in a primary last spring.
Inflation, Busing, McGovern
Inflation, the school busing issue
and perhaps Massachusetts pride in
having gone for George McGovern in
1972 signal defeat for Republican
Gov. Francis Sargent. Democratic
challenger Michael Dukakis has gained
national exposure on public television
as host of the program The Advocates.
He may dispel the belief that the only
Democrats from Massachusetts are
named Kennedy.
Considering that the Democrats
already have senators Henry Jackson,
Walter Mondale, Lloyd Bentsen and
William Proxmire eying the top spot
on their party's 1976 ticket, an

abundance of new aspirants may cause
organizational nightmares for the
Democrats at their 1976 Convention.
According to the new party rules,
delegate selection must strive to
represent women and minorities
equitably. And as the rules stand,
every presidential contender who is
able to muster 15 percent of the vote
in a given congressional district during
the 1976 primary is entitled to at least
one delegate to the convention.
More Open Convention
This augers well for a more open
Democratic Convention in 1976, but
increases the party power of the
diverse Democratic congressional
candidates who are expected be swept
into office next week.
Organizationally, the election of
Democratic governors may prove to be
a real dividend to the party this fall.
On the one hand, Democratic
governors may be able to use their
position to inhibit extreme party
factionalization within- 'their states,
and on the other, they will be able to
provide the eventual 1976 presidential
candidate with a ready-made base of
support and active party workers.
It now appears the Democrats will
' win the statehouse in vote-heavy
states being contested this fall.
Besides searching for new talent
and strategic improvements in
statehouses, the Democrats are also
groping to find a new coalition of
nationwide support.
In New York, Democrat Hugh
Carey has effectively taken his
gubernatorial campaign to the
beleagured suburban taxpayer. He has
stressed the need for more efficient
programs dealing with law and order,
mental health, public transportation,
pollution control and consumer
protection.
By speaking directly to middle-class
concerns Carey has seriously eroded
traditional Republican support in
affluent suburban Nassau and Suffolk
counties.
The real test of Democratic
durability in middle-class areas may be
seen in three bellweather congressional
races. They are: Ohio 23rd district,
Minshal-R vs. Kucinich-D, New York
35th district, Barber Conable-R vs.
Midge Costanaza-D and Virginia 10th
district, Joel Broyhill Fisher-D. In all
of these races Republican incumbents
face stiff opposition from liberal
Democrats.
Despite what the political pundits
say, next Tuesday's mid-term elections
may signal major changes ahead for
the Democratic Party. Most observers
agree that the Democrats are on the
verge of a landslide victory.
The routine analysis runs something
like this. The Republicans, haunted by
Nixonian scandals, economic crisis and
a wave of voter apathy are bound to
lose marginal House and Senate seats
to Democrats across the country.
Such a readjustment of party power
is a natural result of the electoral
process. A fundamental realignment of
the major parties is not indicated, or
so the traditional wisdom goes.
This analysis overemphasizes the
effects of voter backlash and fails to
examine the dynamics of Democratic
Party politics in 1974.
Lawrence F. O'Brien former
National Democratic Party Chairman,
wrote in The New York Times
recently that the task facing the
Democrats is how to build a party that
can win the presidency in 1976. In
order to accomplish this, Democrats
are searching in this election for new
talent, a sound organizational base and
a new coalition of support.
