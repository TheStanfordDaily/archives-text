# White--An Alternative For Senate
## 
### William White 
The Daily's recent editorial
endorsement of Alan Cranston for
election to the U.S. Senate seems
to leave you no choice.
You are told that the only
alternatives are the two major
party candidates for this office;
that you must choose between
government control on the left
(Cranston) or government control
on the right (Richardson).
But what if you believe that
government control is not the
answer? That neither of the major
party candidates is acceptable?
That individuals own their own
lives and have an inalienable right
to live their lives in whatever
manner they choose that does not
forcibly violate the equal right of
others?
That no individual has the right
to initiate force against another,
and therefore, neither does
government? That the actions of
our government should be based
on the consistent application of
these principles of individual
liberty?
An Alternative
There is an alternative. There is
a candidate in this election
pledged to apply the principles of
individual liberty to all aspects of
government, and pledged to give
you back control of your life by
getting government out of your
affairs. As the Liberatarian Party
candidate for U.S. Senator, I
represent these libertarian
principles.
I support an end to the
selective service system and
unconditional amnesty for all
draft evaders and deserters. I
oppose all government attempts
to regulate personal moral
conduct which does not forcibly
violate the rights of others. I
support decriminalization of
marijuana and other victimless
crimes.
I support your right to keep

the fruits of your labor, and am
opposed to all forms of taxation. I
intend to work toward the goal of
voluntary financing for all
government activities by
recognizing the principle of
conscientious objection to
taxation.
Supports Free Market
I support your right to trade
peacefully on a free market, and
oppose all forms of government
regulation in restraint of trade. I

support your right to own and
dispose of private property and
oppose all forms of property
control based on the concept of
"the public good."
In reality, this concept is used
only to support the initiation of
force by one group against
another. It transforms democracy
into gang warfare. True justice can
never be achieved by the initiation
of force.
Don't be fooled by those who
claim you must vote for a major

party candidate. Listen to your
conscience. If you agree with
Libertarian ideas, then don't
waste your vote by casting it for a
candidate who does not represent
your views. Your vote really
counts only when it reflects your
sincere political beliefs. Anyone
who still believes that they must
vote for the lesser of two evils will
get exactly that.

support decriminalization of
marijuana and other victimless
crimes.
I support your right to keep

the fruits of your labor, and am
opposed to all forms of taxation. I
intend to work toward the goal of
voluntary financing for all
government activities by
recognizing the principle of
conscientious objection to
taxation.
Supports Free Market
I support your right to trade
peacefully on a free market, and
oppose all forms of government
regulation in restraint of trade. I

support your right to own and
dispose of private property and
oppose all forms of property
control based on the concept of
"the public good."
In reality, this concept is used
only to support the initiation of
force by one group against
another. It transforms democracy
into gang warfare. True justice can
never be achieved by the initiation
of force.
Don't be fooled by those who
claim you must vote for a major

party candidate. Listen to your
conscience. If you agree with
Libertarian ideas, then don't
waste your vote by casting it for a
candidate who does not represent
your views. Your vote really
counts only when it reflects your
sincere political beliefs. Anyone
who still believes that they must
vote for the lesser of two evils will
get exactly that.

Party candidate for United States
Senate from California.)
The Daily's recent editorial
endorsement of Alan Cranston for
election to the U.S. Senate seems
to leave you no choice.
You are told that the only
alternatives are the two major
party candidates for this office;
that you must choose between
government control on the left
(Cranston) or government control
on the right (Richardson).
But what if you believe that
government control is not the
answer? That neither of the major
party candidates is acceptable?
That individuals own their own
lives and have an inalienable right
to live their lives in whatever
manner they choose that does not
forcibly violate the equal right of
others?
That no individual has the right
to initiate force against another,
and therefore, neither does
government? That the actions of
our government should be based
on the consistent application of
these principles of individual
liberty?
An Alternative
There is an alternative. There is
a candidate in this election
pledged to apply the principles of
individual liberty to all aspects of
government, and pledged to give
you back control of your life by
getting government out of your
affairs. As the Liberatarian Party
candidate for U.S. Senator, I
represent these libertarian
principles.
I support an end to the
selective service system and
unconditional amnesty for all
draft evaders and deserters. I
oppose all government attempts
to regulate personal moral
conduct which does not forcibly
violate the rights of others. I
support decriminalization of
marijuana and other victimless
crimes.
