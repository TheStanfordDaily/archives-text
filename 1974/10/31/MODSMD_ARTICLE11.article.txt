# On Hiring More Women
## 
### Arthur Bienenstock 
In her Daily article of Oct. 22,
1974, Dr. Matilda Butler-Paisley
states that my "defense of the
Stanford Affirmative Action
program is based on bad numbers
and worse logic." Her numerical
argument is based on the fact that
women constituted 18 percent of
all doctoral recipients in fiscal
1973.
Her argument fails to take into
account the fact that mine was a
detailed analysis based on the
number of new hires in each
department, while hers is a global
figure. This difference has
important consequences.
For instance, 29.3 percent of
all the doctorates awarded to
women in that year were in the
field of education. Yet education
accounted for only 2.4 percent of
our new hires last year. If one
excludes education doctorates
from the tallies, women account
for only 16.2 percent of the
remainder. One might crudely
apply this figure to new
Humanities and Science hires.
On this basis, one would
expect the hiring of 5.3 women,

which is consistent with the hiring
of five women in that school.
Her analysis also fails to take into
account the fact that 42.2 percent
of all the new hires were in the
School of Medicine, where one
would predict that about 10
percent of the new hires would be
women, while women were 14.3
percent of those hired. I find it
remarkable and disappointing that
Butler-Paisley labeled my analysis
"bad numbers and worse logic"
without even attempting to learn
of or understand that analysis. %
Hire More Women?
Butler-Paisley goes on to
suggest that 50 percent of all new
professorial appointments could
be women, without suggesting a
mechanism to achieve this. Two
are obvious. The first would be to
reject the appointment of males
recommended by departments if
we were failing to meet the 50
percent quota. The second would
be to inform the departments
which are making appointments
that 50 percent must be women.
Both tactics are illegal because
they constitute discrimination

against men on the basis of their
sex. Butler-Paisley has written
about the legal aspects of
affirmative action and should be
aware that any such sexual
discrimination is illegal.
As I stated in my report to the
Senate, I find last year's results
disappointing. That commonly
shared disappointment should
not, however, lead to a retreat
from careful investigation of the
facts. Instead, we should
thoughtfully analyze the
educational goals which lead to
our desire to increase the number
of women on the faculty.
In doing so, we should
remember that affirmative action
was instituted as a recruitment
process to bring about true equal
opportunity for, but not
discrimination in favor of,
women.
If we keep the educational
goals in mind and review our
earlier successes, the appropriate
mechanisms will become
apparent.
