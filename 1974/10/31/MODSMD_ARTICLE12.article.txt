# Turkish Opium Growth
## 
### Turgut Gur 
With regard to the Oliphant
cartoon titled "That's our boy" in
the Oct. 18, 1974 Daily, I would
like to present some facts about
which the mass majority of the
American people are misinformed
or simply ignorant.
Opium poppies have been
grown for centuries in the western
provinces of Turkey. More than
200,000 mud-ljut farmers
depended upon opium poppies for
their very existence. Therefore,
asking Turkey to end opium
growth was no different than
asking the U.S. suddenly to
remove the entire rubber tire
industry from Akron, Ohio.
Nevertheless, Turkey yielded
to intense American pressure and
Premier Erim signed a four-year
agreement for an opium ban in
1971. However, Erim stated that
if the ban proved to be an
economic hardship, Turkey would
return to opium growing.
According to the Hospitol
Tribune of Jan. 7, 1974, the
Turkish opium export loss was
estimated to be $3 million to
$5 million a year. The U.S. was
prepared to extend a grand total
of payments of about $35 million
over a four-year period but the
1974 payment has not been issued
yet.
Substitute Crop
More importantly, the U.S.
agreed to a special agricultural
program to come up with a
substitute crop for the farmers.
Sunflower, safflower and grape
were proposed as prospective
crops in place of opium.
Unfortunately, the soil and
climatic conditions rendered no
promising results. The efforts of
the U.S. and Turkish governments
were total failure. The farmers
now have nothing.
With the recent decision of the
Turkish government to resume
opium growth, the first poppy
crop will be harvested in 1975
when the 1971 agreement expires
anyway. Moreover, the Turkish
government has already declared
its willingness to cooperate with
the U.S. or a U.N. Commission to
bring strict control and
supervision of the crop to avoid
smuggling and illegal use.
Robert Green, sharing the
Pulitzer Prize award to Newsday
reporters for their series* "The
Heroin Trail," reports that the
end of Turkish poppy growing has
made no appreciable dent in the
world heroin market. Other
poppy growing countries (e.g.
Iran, Afghanistan, India, China,
Thailand, Burma, Laos, Cambodia
and Yugoslavia) have managed to
fill the gap. The most recent
incident of a brown heroin deal in
a Tijuana jail strongly supports
this fact.
Supply And Demand
All of this brings us to an
argument that as long as demand
exists, there will always be a
supply. It is important to note
that there is no heroin addiction
problem in Turkey. What little
dealing there had been, vanished
when the Turks rigorously applied
the death penalty to dealers.
There is also a pharmaceutical
aspect to the opium issue. The
previously refered to Hospitol
Tribune warns of a serious
shortage of high grade opium base
products. This weekly New York
newspaper reports that this
country's action, aimed at
reducing illicit narcotics traffic,
has backfired.
Pharmaceutical companies that
process opium into codeine and
related drugs are now scrambling
for supplies in an ever-tightening
market.
The gap between world needs
(estimated to be 1425 tons for
1974) and supplies has worsened
sharply following the opium ban
in Turkey. To meet the situation,
the governments of India (world's
larger supplier of opium) and
Belgium jointly requested the
U.N. to look for ways to close the
gap (which amounted to about
450 tons in 1973, roughly a 31
percnet shortage) at the session
held last February.
The lack of understanding that
Rep. Lester Wolff (D-N.Y.)
revealed in his statements during
his April, 1974, visit to Ankara
has been seriously criticized by
Americans as well as Turks. He
appeared to be blackmailing the
Turkish Government by saying
that if opium growth was started
again, U.S. would cut all aid to
Turkey.
Turks are proud people and we
find it insulting that Wolff could
believe a promise of money or
threat of withholding money has
any pertinence to our
government's decisions on serious
economic, social and
psychological needs of our people.
