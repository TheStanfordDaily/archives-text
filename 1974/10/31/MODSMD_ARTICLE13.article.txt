## Super Stars: Journalism's Dynamic Duo Hits TV 
### STEVE HEFTER 
CHICAGO, 111. - Bob
Woodward sits before the
television cameras looking like a
million bucks.
In the next chair, shaggy-haired
Carl Bernstein sips his coffee and
taps out a tune on the table top
with a number two pencil.
Together they engage in
another of a long line of television
talk shows, promoting their book,
All The President's Men, and
discussing the greatest political
scandal in the nations history.
'Woodstein'
Woodward and Bernstein,
admiringly referred to by some in
newspaper circles as "Woodstein,"
are the two young Washington
Post reporters whose role in
uncovering Watergate has been
heralded as the greatest
journalistic feat since Stanley
found Livingstone.
Doggedly pursuing every lead,
contacting every possible source
of information and threading
together each shrewd hunch, they
uncovered a wide political
intelligence network from what

had previously been described as a
"third-rate burglary."
Before flying off for their next
TV show, journalism's dynamic
duo talk about their
accomplishments.
"We were just doing our job,"
Woodward says modestly.
"We had a story to cover and
we covered it. Sometimes we had
to look hard for the facts
sometimes we did well and
sometimes not. All we were after
were the facts."
No Vendetta
Woodward emphasizes the
word "all."
"We were never 'out to get'
anyone," he declares. "There was
no personal vendetta. Our only
goal was to find out what
happened and report it. If that's a
vendetta against someone, then
that's a sad reflection about the
state of affairs in this country."
In covering a story with such
sharp political overtones, they had
to be extra careful. "We checked
and double checked all sources,"
Woodward says. "We knew people
would question the legitimacy of
our quotes, so we made sure they
were right."
One of their sources, playfully
referred to as "Deep Throat," was
the key to information on
operations like Donald Segretti's
spy and sabotage mission during
the Florida Democratic Primary.
Deep Throat would somehow get
a hold of Woodward's New York
Times, and inscribe a meeting
time on page 20. Deep Throat
would then steer the reporters on

the right path to pertinent
information.
Protects Source
Protecting the confidentiality
of his source, Woodward teasingly
refuses to reveal Deep Throat's
identity. "Let's just say 'Deep
Throat' was in a position to pick
things up," he explains.
Woodward smiles without
showing his teeth. He talks slowly
and listens attentively. His
well-kept hair, solid colored shirt
and sta-prest pants precisely
complement the easiness of his
eyes. There's hardly any similarity
to the piercing look and
shoulder-length hair of Carl
Bernstein.
"I didn't want to work with
him at first." Woodward says of
Bernstein. "We were assigned to
the story together and I didn't
think we'd work out."
'Hippy Freak'
"He thought I was some kind
of hippy freak," Bernstein adds in
his first attempt at humor; he
doesn't crack a grin, but his
low-pitched voice embraces the
slightest detection of a snicker. -
But Woodward manages a
smile. "The team worked
though," he says. "And it still
works."
"We're still reporters,"
Bernstein emphasizes. "Any
success hasn't changed that."
"If anything, we have to be
more cautious about the
information we print now than we
did in the beginning," Woodward
says. "One error now could
jeopardize our entire credibility.

Our success depends on our
future."
Early Success
With or without their own
acknowledgement, at ages 31 and
30, Woodward and Bernstein have
reached the epitome of success.
Before their reporting of
Watergate, their combined income
was less than $30,000 a year.
Now, Robert Redford has bought
the movie rights to the book and
all sources of income should bring
them more than $500,000 each.
Woodward makes light of the
success. "Redford's supposed to
play me, and he's been searching
the country trying to find
someone to play Carl. He hasn't
had any luck yet."
Bernstein shuns the issue. "The
deal's not finished yet, and I
really don't know what more to
say."
Autographs
Woodward and Bernstein put
on their jackets and autograph a
few copies of their book.
Woodward talks about his earlier
days in a south Chicago suburb
and of college life at Yale. He had
spent time in the Navy and had
worked at the Post for only nine
months prior to Watergate.
Bernstein talks to a
cameraman. For a University of
Maryland dropout he has done
well for himself. "There are
certain problems with fame," he
said earlier. "You lose your
anonymity and that's crucial for a
reporter. But," he adds, "more
people listen to you."
Woodward and Bernstein walk
down the long NBC corridor to
the elevators. They press the
button with the arrow pointing
down. They leave the studio
looking like they did when they
came in like a million bucks.


WOODSTEEN—Editors of a new campus newspaper 'Live Wire'? No, it's the odd couple who brought
Watergate out into the open. The co-authors of 'All The President's Men' have now hit TV stardom.

Watergate, their combined income
was less than $30,000 a year.
Now, Robert Redford has bought

CHICAGO, 111. - Bob
Woodward sits before the
television cameras looking like a
million bucks.
In the next chair, shaggy-haired
Carl Bernstein sips his coffee and
taps out a tune on the table top
with a number two pencil.
Together they engage in
another of a long line of television
talk shows, promoting their book,
All The President's Men, and
discussing the greatest political
scandal in the nations history.
'Woodstein'
Woodward and Bernstein,
admiringly referred to by some in
newspaper circles as "Woodstein,"
are the two young Washington
Post reporters whose role in
uncovering Watergate has been
heralded as the greatest
journalistic feat since Stanley
found Livingstone.
Doggedly pursuing every lead,
contacting every possible source
of information and threading
together each shrewd hunch, they
uncovered a wide political
intelligence network from what

had previously been described as a
"third-rate burglary."
Before flying off for their next
TV show, journalism's dynamic
duo talk about their
accomplishments.
"We were just doing our job,"
Woodward says modestly.
"We had a story to cover and
we covered it. Sometimes we had
to look hard for the facts
sometimes we did well and
sometimes not. All we were after
were the facts."
No Vendetta
Woodward emphasizes the
word "all."
"We were never 'out to get'
anyone," he declares. "There was
no personal vendetta. Our only
goal was to find out what
happened and report it. If that's a
vendetta against someone, then
that's a sad reflection about the
state of affairs in this country."
In covering a story with such
sharp political overtones, they had
to be extra careful. "We checked
and double checked all sources,"
Woodward says. "We knew people
would question the legitimacy of
our quotes, so we made sure they
were right."
One of their sources, playfully
referred to as "Deep Throat," was
the key to information on
operations like Donald Segretti's
spy and sabotage mission during
the Florida Democratic Primary.
Deep Throat would somehow get
a hold of Woodward's New York
Times, and inscribe a meeting
time on page 20. Deep Throat
would then steer the reporters on

the right path to pertinent
information.
Protects Source
Protecting the confidentiality
of his source, Woodward teasingly
refuses to reveal Deep Throat's
identity. "Let's just say 'Deep
Throat' was in a position to pick
things up," he explains.
Woodward smiles without
showing his teeth. He talks slowly
and listens attentively. His
well-kept hair, solid colored shirt
and sta-prest pants precisely
complement the easiness of his
eyes. There's hardly any similarity
to the piercing look and
shoulder-length hair of Carl
Bernstein.
"I didn't want to work with
him at first." Woodward says of
Bernstein. "We were assigned to
the story together and I didn't
think we'd work out."
'Hippy Freak'
"He thought I was some kind
of hippy freak," Bernstein adds in
his first attempt at humor; he
doesn't crack a grin, but his
low-pitched voice embraces the
slightest detection of a snicker. -
But Woodward manages a
smile. "The team worked
though," he says. "And it still
works."
"We're still reporters,"
Bernstein emphasizes. "Any
success hasn't changed that."
"If anything, we have to be
more cautious about the
information we print now than we
did in the beginning," Woodward
says. "One error now could
jeopardize our entire credibility.

Our success depends on our
future."

the Florida Democratic Primary.
Deep Throat would somehow get
a hold of Woodward's New York
Times, and inscribe a meeting
time on page 20. Deep Throat
would then steer the reporters on

the right path to pertinent
information.
Protects Source
Protecting the confidentiality
of his source, Woodward teasingly
refuses to reveal Deep Throat's
identity. "Let's just say 'Deep
Throat' was in a position to pick
things up," he explains.
Woodward smiles without
showing his teeth. He talks slowly
and listens attentively. His
well-kept hair, solid colored shirt
and sta-prest pants precisely
complement the easiness of his
eyes. There's hardly any similarity
to the piercing look and
shoulder-length hair of Carl
Bernstein.
"I didn't want to work with
him at first." Woodward says of
Bernstein. "We were assigned to
the story together and I didn't
think we'd work out."
'Hippy Freak'
"He thought I was some kind
of hippy freak," Bernstein adds in
his first attempt at humor; he
doesn't crack a grin, but his
low-pitched voice embraces the
slightest detection of a snicker. -
But Woodward manages a
smile. "The team worked
though," he says. "And it still
works."
"We're still reporters,"
Bernstein emphasizes. "Any
success hasn't changed that."
"If anything, we have to be
more cautious about the
information we print now than we
did in the beginning," Woodward
says. "One error now could
jeopardize our entire credibility.

Our success depends on our
future."
Early Success
With or without their own
acknowledgement, at ages 31 and
30, Woodward and Bernstein have
reached the epitome of success.
Before their reporting of
Watergate, their combined income
was less than $30,000 a year.
Now, Robert Redford has bought
the movie rights to the book and
all sources of income should bring
them more than $500,000 each.
Woodward makes light of the
success. "Redford's supposed to
play me, and he's been searching
the country trying to find
someone to play Carl. He hasn't
had any luck yet."
Bernstein shuns the issue. "The
deal's not finished yet, and I
really don't know what more to
say."
Autographs
Woodward and Bernstein put
on their jackets and autograph a
few copies of their book.
Woodward talks about his earlier
days in a south Chicago suburb
and of college life at Yale. He had
spent time in the Navy and had
worked at the Post for only nine
months prior to Watergate.
Bernstein talks to a
cameraman. For a University of
Maryland dropout he has done
well for himself. "There are
certain problems with fame," he
said earlier. "You lose your
anonymity and that's crucial for a
reporter. But," he adds, "more
people listen to you."
Woodward and Bernstein walk
down the long NBC corridor to
the elevators. They press the
button with the arrow pointing
down. They leave the studio
looking like they did when they
came in like a million bucks.


WOODSTEEN—Editors of a new campus newspaper 'Live Wire'? No, it's the odd couple who brought
Watergate out into the open. The co-authors of 'All The President's Men' have now hit TV stardom.

CHICAGO, 111. - Bob
Woodward sits before the
television cameras looking like a
million bucks.
In the next chair, shaggy-haired
Carl Bernstein sips his coffee and
taps out a tune on the table top
with a number two pencil.
Together they engage in
another of a long line of television
talk shows, promoting their book,
All The President's Men, and
discussing the greatest political
scandal in the nations history.
'Woodstein'
Woodward and Bernstein,
admiringly referred to by some in
newspaper circles as "Woodstein,"
are the two young Washington
Post reporters whose role in
uncovering Watergate has been
heralded as the greatest
journalistic feat since Stanley
found Livingstone.
Doggedly pursuing every lead,
contacting every possible source
of information and threading
together each shrewd hunch, they
uncovered a wide political
intelligence network from what

had previously been described as a
"third-rate burglary."
Before flying off for their next
TV show, journalism's dynamic
duo talk about their
accomplishments.
"We were just doing our job,"
Woodward says modestly.
"We had a story to cover and
we covered it. Sometimes we had
to look hard for the facts
sometimes we did well and
sometimes not. All we were after
were the facts."
No Vendetta
Woodward emphasizes the
word "all."
"We were never 'out to get'
anyone," he declares. "There was
no personal vendetta. Our only
goal was to find out what
happened and report it. If that's a
vendetta against someone, then
that's a sad reflection about the
state of affairs in this country."
In covering a story with such
sharp political overtones, they had
to be extra careful. "We checked
and double checked all sources,"
Woodward says. "We knew people
would question the legitimacy of
our quotes, so we made sure they
were right."
One of their sources, playfully
referred to as "Deep Throat," was
the key to information on
operations like Donald Segretti's
spy and sabotage mission during
the Florida Democratic Primary.

a hold of Woodward's New York
Times, and inscribe a meeting
