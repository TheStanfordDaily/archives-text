Where is the Big Game Axe? Why isn't it on display for students to
see? â€”R.H.T.E.S.M.
The axe is "in safe keeping," a number of closemouthed University
officials proclaim. In fact, the axe is in such safe keeping that the Cal
Bears must revert to Wild West days of bank robberies to capture it.
They'll need someone with X-ray vision to even spot the symbol of
victory. -
The axe is cached in the Wells Fargo Bank vault, Wells Fargo
branch manager Roger Adams revealed. And the only ones with the
authority to remove it are the Axe Commission escorted by a certain
University adniinistrator who chooses to remain anonymous.
He/She doesn't want any dirty golden bear representatives trying
to impersonate him/her as the Stanford's "Infamous Three" of Theta
Delta Chi imitated the voice of Bear Coach Mike White last year. That
role-changing escapade led to Stanford's first axe theft from Berkeley
in 24 years'.
Adams said the bank does not display the axe in a showcase
because a special expensive alarm system would be needed.
The axe is guarded reverently up to the time it is given to the
winning team of the Big Game. Although there is no real policy
according to police chief Marvin Herrington, the police generally
chaperone the axe's transportation from its hiding place to the game.
Herrington added that no one has ever attempted to hijack a police
car carrying the axe. ......
The history of the axe dates back to 1899 the days before
Stanford Indians and unprovocative yell leaders. Billy Erb, a fanatic

fan and yell leader attacked a dummy bear and blue and gold
streamers with an axe at the 1899 Stanford-Cal baseball game.
The Bears managed to steal the axe after a wild scramble with the
axe's guardians after Stanford lost the game. Thus, the start of a
tradition.
This year's Axe Commission has made no effort to reveal itself, let
alone the axe. It's up to the commission to decide when, how and if
to display the axe.
