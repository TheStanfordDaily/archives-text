# Affirmative Action Gradual, Not Radical, Miner Warns
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
Women's infiltration into the existing University
power structure is not going to be a "one-step
change," Affirmative Action Officer Anne Miner
warned yesterday at the Center for Research on
Women (CROW) noon lecture.
The first minorities and women hired will not be
radical, she said, but will be more conservative, like
the while males who hire them.
"What it takes to be a good scholar and a good
researcher is the same" for both sexes, she said, but
the values of individual faculty members influence
the scope of their studies. So, she suggested, with
more women in economics, more energy might be
directed to studying the economics of child care.
As an "intellectual exercise," Miner speculated
about the effect of elevating the female family role
to a more important academic status. She
considered, for example, a university with "a strong
core in family dynamics, with asides in
engineering."
The attitude that "the normal student is male"
and the belief that women's main role in life is to
be a wife and mother have caused universities to
neglect the women students counseling needs,
Miner said.
Although current academians laugh at these

assumptions, she added, they influenced women's
education heavily until very recently. A study of
University undergraduates, completed in 1965,
concluded that even educated women held very
traditional expectations about their careers.
About 10 years ago, a minor attitude shift
opened the "dual career" option for women, Miner
said. Under this system, people believe that women
do have an important family role, she said, but with
the qualification that "It's not fair to say that a
woman can only be a wife and mother."
A woman with a dual career does not relinquish
any family duties, Miner explained, "She just adds
a 40-hour work week." Unfortunately, educators
have never considered giving double options to men
as well, she added.
Drawing on her personal observation, Miner said
that female graduate students do not receive the
informal guidance which males get through a
"mentor-apprentice relationship" with professors.
Male faculty, she explained, have trouble seeing
young women as their potential replacements.
The result of this unintentional, but de facto,
discrimination is that women can finish their
Ph.D's, but have no idea how to deal with practical
considerations like getting grants and publishing
research, Miner said.

discrimination is that women can finish their
Ph.D's, but have no idea how to deal with practical
considerations like getting grants and publishing
research, Miner said.
Women's infiltration into the existing University
power structure is not going to be a "one-step
change," Affirmative Action Officer Anne Miner
warned yesterday at the Center for Research on
Women (CROW) noon lecture.
The first minorities and women hired will not be
radical, she said, but will be more conservative, like
the while males who hire them.
"What it takes to be a good scholar and a good
researcher is the same" for both sexes, she said, but
the values of individual faculty members influence
the scope of their studies. So, she suggested, with
more women in economics, more energy might be
directed to studying the economics of child care.
As an "intellectual exercise," Miner speculated
about the effect of elevating the female family role
to a more important academic status. She
considered, for example, a university with "a strong
core in family dynamics, with asides in
engineering."
The attitude that "the normal student is male"
and the belief that women's main role in life is to
be a wife and mother have caused universities to
neglect the women students counseling needs,
Miner said.
Although current academians laugh at these

assumptions, she added, they influenced women's
education heavily until very recently. A study of
University undergraduates, completed in 1965,
concluded that even educated women held very
traditional expectations about their careers.
About 10 years ago, a minor attitude shift
opened the "dual career" option for women, Miner
said. Under this system, people believe that women
do have an important family role, she said, but with
the qualification that "It's not fair to say that a
woman can only be a wife and mother."
A woman with a dual career does not relinquish
any family duties, Miner explained, "She just adds
a 40-hour work week." Unfortunately, educators
have never considered giving double options to men
as well, she added.
Drawing on her personal observation, Miner said
that female graduate students do not receive the
informal guidance which males get through a
"mentor-apprentice relationship" with professors.
Male faculty, she explained, have trouble seeing
young women as their potential replacements.
The result of this unintentional, but de facto,
discrimination is that women can finish their
Ph.D's, but have no idea how to deal with practical
considerations like getting grants and publishing
research, Miner said.
