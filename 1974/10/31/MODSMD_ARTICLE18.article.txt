# Officer Outlines Procedure For Police Rape Investigation
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
All women should be familiar
with normal police procedures in
rape cases, according to Palo Alto
Police Officer Kate Talbot, who
outlined last week in a
community meeting what a rape
victim should expect from police
and hospital examiners.
When a "hot call" comes in,
Talbot said, "our primary concern
is to get there quickly." Because
Palo Alto has more men than
women on its police force, she
explained in a Daily interview, the
first officer at the scene is likely
to be a male, although the
department does try to dispatch
female officers when possible.

When the officer arrives, he
should first make sure the victim
is physically safe, providing first
aid or taking her to the hospital
immediately if she has been
injured, Talbot said. He should
also get a complete description of
the rapist, in case he is still in the
area.
Talbot emphasized that the
victim can have a friend or a
representative from Women
Against Rape with her during the
interrogation, if she wants the
emotional support.
'Unnecessary' Questions?
"Some of the questions asked
before you go the hospital may
seem unnecessary," Talbot said,
"but we have to ask them because
we're looking for evidence." The
police will want to know
specifically what type of
intercourse took place, for
example, so they will know where
to look for semen, pubic hairs or
clothing fibers.
But, Talbot said, "You should
question any police officer who
asks questions like, 'Did you
enjoy it?' "
TTie police will take all of the
victim's clothing for evidence,
Talbot said, so the woman should
take a change of clothes with her
to the hospital. The victim should
not wash before she is examined.

Mary Pearl, a nurse at the
Stanford Hospital emergency
room, said that the staff's attitude
toward rape victims has definitely
improved over the past four years.
Now, instead of trying to ignore
the fact of rape, the nurses try to
"assess the emotional state of the
victim" and provide as much
support as possible, she explained.
Initial Questioning
After the victim is admitted,
she is taken to a female examining
room for initial questioning by a
nurse. The hospital now uses more
nurse participation in rape cases,
Pearl said, because "A young
female who's been assaulted finds

it much easier to talk to a nurse
than a male doctor."
After the nurse has tested the
patient's vital signs and tried to
put her at ease, Pearl said, a
doctor licensed in "some female
specialty" will do a gynecological
exam.
The doctor will also test for
venereal diseases, prepare a saline
suspension which the police use to
check for sperm, and prepare a
cervical smear. Some cases require
a rectal or throat smear, Pearl
said.
Many women now use birth
control, Pearl explained, so
pregnancy is no. longer the
problem it used to be. But if the
victim could be pregnant, the
hospital provides a "morning after
pill," which "makes you sick for a
couple of days" but kills the
embryo.
The primary danger, she said, is
venereal diseases, for which
penicillin is available.
Psychological Counseling
If necessary, victims are
referred to a psychological
counselor, Pearl added.
Ordinarily, the woman returns
home after the hospital
examination.
The next day, Talbot said, the
victim is asked to come into the
police station for further
questioning. Again, she can bring
a friend to stay with her during the
interviews.
After giving as detailed a
description of the events as
possible, the victim will look
through a book of mug photos,
then put together a composite of
the rapist with a "photo
identikit."
If the woman does find a man
who looks like the attacker,
Talbot said, she will be asked to
make another identiification in a
"photo line-up." During the
investigation the victim may have
to make several visits to the police
department.
