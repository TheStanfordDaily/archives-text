# Cory, Bagley Sling Ethics Charges
## 
### DOUG ARCHERD 
In this post-Watergate election year, one of the
hottest issues around is the personal integrity of the
candidate. But in the race for state controller, the
air has been so full of mud that both candidates are
getting splattered.
The real charges and cpunter-charges began when
it was revealed that the Democratic candidate,
Assemblyman Ken Cory (D-Westminster) had
received three-fourths of his primary campaign
funding from only two individuals. The two men are
Dr. Louis J. Cella, who has interests in health care
facilities, and Richard J. O'Neill, an Orange County
developer who owns 53,000 acres.
As of Oct. 11, the two men had given Cory
$530,000, most of it for the primary, which was the
most expensive campaign in the state below the
gubernatorial level.
Cory's opponent, Assemblyman William Bagley
(R-San Rafael) has called the gifts "obscene,
without any redeeming social value." He
characterizes the race as being "between two Orange
County millionaires and the people of California."
Accusing the two of trying to buy themselves a state
office, Bagley calls it an example of the same sort of
"combination of power, money, and deceit" that
was seen in Watergate.
Cory has counterattacked, charging that Bagley
used his influence as an assemblyman to aid a client
of his law firm. Bagley had worked to established
the Bagley Conservation Fund, which earmarked
$lOO million for the purchase of land to add to the
Point Reyes National seashore. Cory charges that
$287,875 of this money went to purchase land

owned by a client of Bagley's firm, and that
furthermore, the money did not even need to be
spent.
State Had Title
The Democrat believes that, due to a court
ruling, the state already had the trust rights to the
land. However, the legal analyst for the Wildlife
Conservation Board felt that the decision did not
affect the land.
Cory has made campaign contribution charges of
his own, noting that Bagley has received
contributions from ARCO and Getty Oil, and that
his law firm does some work for Gulf Oil and
P.G.&E.
The issue is very important for Cory because he
has billed himself as "the man the oil companies
fear the most." This claim arises from Cory's
leadership of a state legislature investigation which,
over the last seven years, unearthed facts which
seem to indicate that oil companies have
shortchanged the state of California by some $llB
million.
In addition, when these companies refused to
open their financial records to the investigating
committee, Cory had contempt actions filed against
them.
Bagley Points To 'Hypocrisy'
Bagley calls Cory's "hypocrisy,"
noting that Cory himself received campaign
contributions from 23 different oil companies,
including Getty Oil. He mocks Cory, calling him
"the man the oil companies almost fear."
Cory answers that these contributions came from
small, independent companies, not the big ones he

claims are the real villians he is out to get.
This is not a moot issue in the case of the
controller's office, because the controller is
Chairman of the California Lands Commission,
which regulates oil produced on California
tidelapds. In addition, the controller is the state's
bookeeper and is responsible for all payments the
state makes.
It is the issue of personal integrity which has
moved to the forefront in these last days of the
campaign, however. The accusations continue, Cory
charging that Bagley obtained passage of an
amendment which would allow state representatives
to collect their pensions if they resigned to take on
another government post. Bagley was seeking just
such an appointment at the time. He has admitted
that he was pushing" the amendment for his own
benefit.
Bagley, who trails in the polls by an 11 percent
margin, is fighting back hard, accusing Cory of being
a "bought" candidate, and expressing doubts that
loans given to finance Cory's campaign will ever be
repaid. This would make them gifts, rather than
loans, and as such, subject to taxes. Bagley has been
concentrating his campaign on radio spots, lashing
out at Cory's contributors, and drawing parallels to
the recent Watergate scandals.
Cory has only recently begun to fight back,
having previously been concentrating on his oil
company killer image. Now he has started to hint
that Bagley is really the bought candidate, noting
that Bagley has never voted against P.G.&E., and
that he pushed Reagan's tuition bill and a number
of tax bills throuth the State house.

$530,000, most of it for the primary, which was the
most expensive campaign in the state below the
gubernatorial level.
Cory's opponent, Assemblyman William Bagley
(R-San Rafael) has called the gifts "obscene,
without any redeeming social value." He
characterizes the race as being "between two Orange
County millionaires and the people of California."
Accusing the two of trying to buy themselves a state
office, Bagley calls it an example of the same sort of
"combination of power, money, and deceit" that
was seen in Watergate.
Cory has counterattacked, charging that Bagley
used his influence as an assemblyman to aid a client
of his law firm. Bagley had worked to established
the Bagley Conservation Fund, which earmarked
$lOO million for the purchase of land to add to the
Point Reyes National seashore. Cory charges that
$287,875 of this money went to purchase land

owned by a client of Bagley's firm, and that
furthermore, the money did not even need to be
spent.
State Had Title
The Democrat believes that, due to a court
ruling, the state already had the trust rights to the
land. However, the legal analyst for the Wildlife
Conservation Board felt that the decision did not
affect the land.
Cory has made campaign contribution charges of
his own, noting that Bagley has received
contributions from ARCO and Getty Oil, and that
his law firm does some work for Gulf Oil and
P.G.&E.
The issue is very important for Cory because he
has billed himself as "the man the oil companies
fear the most." This claim arises from Cory's
leadership of a state legislature investigation which,
over the last seven years, unearthed facts which
seem to indicate that oil companies have
shortchanged the state of California by some $llB
million.
In addition, when these companies refused to
open their financial records to the investigating
committee, Cory had contempt actions filed against
them.
Bagley Points To 'Hypocrisy'
Bagley calls Cory's "hypocrisy,"
noting that Cory himself received campaign
contributions from 23 different oil companies,
including Getty Oil. He mocks Cory, calling him
"the man the oil companies almost fear."
Cory answers that these contributions came from
small, independent companies, not the big ones he

claims are the real villians he is out to get.
This is not a moot issue in the case of the
controller's office, because the controller is
Chairman of the California Lands Commission,
which regulates oil produced on California
tidelapds. In addition, the controller is the state's
bookeeper and is responsible for all payments the
state makes.
It is the issue of personal integrity which has
moved to the forefront in these last days of the
campaign, however. The accusations continue, Cory
charging that Bagley obtained passage of an
amendment which would allow state representatives
to collect their pensions if they resigned to take on
another government post. Bagley was seeking just
such an appointment at the time. He has admitted
that he was pushing" the amendment for his own
benefit.
Bagley, who trails in the polls by an 11 percent
margin, is fighting back hard, accusing Cory of being
a "bought" candidate, and expressing doubts that
loans given to finance Cory's campaign will ever be
repaid. This would make them gifts, rather than
loans, and as such, subject to taxes. Bagley has been
concentrating his campaign on radio spots, lashing
out at Cory's contributors, and drawing parallels to
the recent Watergate scandals.
Cory has only recently begun to fight back,
having previously been concentrating on his oil
company killer image. Now he has started to hint
that Bagley is really the bought candidate, noting
that Bagley has never voted against P.G.&E., and
that he pushed Reagan's tuition bill and a number
of tax bills throuth the State house.
In this post-Watergate election year, one of the
hottest issues around is the personal integrity of the
candidate. But in the race for state controller, the
air has been so full of mud that both candidates are
getting splattered.
The real charges and cpunter-charges began when
it was revealed that the Democratic candidate,
Assemblyman Ken Cory (D-Westminster) had
received three-fourths of his primary campaign
funding from only two individuals. The two men are
Dr. Louis J. Cella, who has interests in health care
facilities, and Richard J. O'Neill, an Orange County
developer who owns 53,000 acres.

the Bagley Conservation Fund, which earmarked
$lOO million for the purchase of land to add to the
Point Reyes National seashore. Cory charges that
$287,875 of this money went to purchase land

owned by a client of Bagley's firm, and that
furthermore, the money did not even need to be
spent.
State Had Title
The Democrat believes that, due to a court
ruling, the state already had the trust rights to the
land. However, the legal analyst for the Wildlife
Conservation Board felt that the decision did not
affect the land.
Cory has made campaign contribution charges of
his own, noting that Bagley has received
contributions from ARCO and Getty Oil, and that
his law firm does some work for Gulf Oil and
P.G.&E.
The issue is very important for Cory because he
has billed himself as "the man the oil companies
fear the most." This claim arises from Cory's
leadership of a state legislature investigation which,
over the last seven years, unearthed facts which
seem to indicate that oil companies have
shortchanged the state of California by some $llB
million.
In addition, when these companies refused to
open their financial records to the investigating
committee, Cory had contempt actions filed against
them.
Bagley Points To 'Hypocrisy'
Bagley calls Cory's "hypocrisy,"
noting that Cory himself received campaign
contributions from 23 different oil companies,
including Getty Oil. He mocks Cory, calling him
"the man the oil companies almost fear."
Cory answers that these contributions came from
small, independent companies, not the big ones he

claims are the real villians he is out to get.
This is not a moot issue in the case of the
controller's office, because the controller is
Chairman of the California Lands Commission,
which regulates oil produced on California
tidelapds. In addition, the controller is the state's
bookeeper and is responsible for all payments the
state makes.
It is the issue of personal integrity which has
moved to the forefront in these last days of the
campaign, however. The accusations continue, Cory
charging that Bagley obtained passage of an
amendment which would allow state representatives
to collect their pensions if they resigned to take on
another government post. Bagley was seeking just
such an appointment at the time. He has admitted
that he was pushing" the amendment for his own
benefit.
Bagley, who trails in the polls by an 11 percent
margin, is fighting back hard, accusing Cory of being
a "bought" candidate, and expressing doubts that
loans given to finance Cory's campaign will ever be
repaid. This would make them gifts, rather than
loans, and as such, subject to taxes. Bagley has been
concentrating his campaign on radio spots, lashing
out at Cory's contributors, and drawing parallels to
the recent Watergate scandals.
Cory has only recently begun to fight back,
having previously been concentrating on his oil
company killer image. Now he has started to hint
that Bagley is really the bought candidate, noting
that Bagley has never voted against P.G.&E., and
that he pushed Reagan's tuition bill and a number
of tax bills throuth the State house.
