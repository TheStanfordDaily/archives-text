# Swedish Ballet Old But New

### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
Can a 200-year-old ballet
company perform a dance about
T'ai-Chi as smoothly as it does
The Sleeping Beauty ? The Royal
Swedish Ballet has proved the
answer is unequivocably yes.
In a performance Saturday at
Zellerbach Auditorium, ten of the
company's 62 dancers presented a
powerful modern dance
interpretation of one of 37
T'ai-Chi exercises, developed in
China 1,400 years ago. The piece
called Embrace Tiger and
Return to Mountain featured a
series of highly-skilled movements
and moments of deep dramatic
impact, performed to Morton
Subotnick's electronic score.
Male dancers lifted women
effortlessly in the air, threw them
five feet into the arms of other
dancers and held them in
strikingly original diagonal body
suspensions.
The most dramatic moments of
the piece perhaps this is what
made it so strong were the
beginning and end. The piece
opens with silhouetted dancers
emerging eerily from behind huge
white backdrops and closes with
the dancers lying on their sides in

pairs, raising and lowering their
arms and legs like birds in flight.
The highlights of the piece
more than compensated for
occasional lulls, when it seemed
choreographer Glen Tetley had
created movement with no clear
source or purpose.
Embrace Tiger and Return to
Mountain was followed and
starkly contrasted by a
presentation of the third act of
The Sleeping Beauty, whose
scenery and costumes (by Jean
Voigt) were a visual delight.
Walter Bourke as the
"Bluebird" flew through a series
of acrobatic twists, spins, and
leaps that several times spurred
the audience to loud applause.
Equally striking were some of
the duets performed by Per
Arthur Segerstrom (The Prince)
and Ella-Britt Hammarberg (Fee
de L'Amour). And the 30-odd
dancers who gathered onstage for
a grand finale more than matched
the grandeur of the Tchaikovsky
score.
Less successful, however, were
the presentations of Grand
Tarantella, a Spanish-style duet
choreographed by Bourke and
Konservatoriet, a group dance
choreographed by August

Bournonville.
Although Bourke's strength
and agility were evident
throughout his duet (and he
obviously felt comfortable moving
to his own choreography), he
seemed ill-at-east with his partner
Maria Lang, and Konservatoriet
a piece based on the life of a
ballet school was marred by
faltering steps and awkward
transitions.
