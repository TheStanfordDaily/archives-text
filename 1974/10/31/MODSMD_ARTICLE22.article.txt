Ziegler: Nixon Almost Died
LONG BEACH Former President Richard M. Nixon

phlebitis, his former White House press secretary revealed
yesterday.
"There is no doubt that we almost lost President Nixon
yesterday afternoon," Ronald L. Ziegler told an impromptu
news conference at the hospital where Nixon is being
treated.
Nixon's doctors have sidestepped questions as to
whether Nixon's life was in danger during the crisis
Tuesday.
Dr. John C. Luqgren, Nixon's personal physician, said
the former president had shown improvement. He said
internal bleeding, which triggered the shock, had apparently
stopped.
Brown Predicts Democratic Sweep
SACRAMENTO Edmund G. Brown Jr. predicted a
sweeping Democratic victory next week in California, but
Houston Flournoy warned yesterday that electing Brown
would be "mortgaging the future of California."
Flournoy emphasized the differences between himselt
and Brown at an Anaheim speech, where the Republican
candidate said Brown is not really in favor of a tough
position on law and order issues.
"No, the only thing that he is for - today, yesterday
and tomorrow is mortgaging the future of California and
its taxpayers to the special interests that are supporting and
financing his campaign," Flournoy said.

Brown, at a Union Square rally attended by about 2,500
persons, urged the enthusiastic young crowd to vote a
straight Democratic ticket and predicted a victory if they
did.

WASHINGTON Jeb . Stuart Magruder testified
yesterday that early in the Watergate cover-up he was
assured that then-President Richard M. Nixon was pleased
at the way Magruder was keeping the true story of the
scandal from coming out.
In the second day on the stand as a prosecution witness
at the Watergate "cover-up trial, Magruder also said he was
promised financial help if anything went wrong with plans
for him to lie to federal grand juries in the summer and fall
of 1972.
The former deputy director of Nixon's 1972 re-election
committee also acknowledged telling FBI agents that during
the cover-up, he obtained as much money as he could above
his normal salary from the committee.
Labor Costs Soar; Productivity Drops
WASHINGTON Labor costs continued rising at
near-record rates during the past three months while

economy amid persistent inflation.
Unit labor costs, an important indicator of inflationary
pressure, rose at an annual rate of 13.9 percent in the third
quarter of this year, the second fastest rise in 25 years. The
rate was exceeded only by the year's first-quarter increase
of 14.6 percent.
Productivity that is, output per worker hour fell at
an annual rate of 3 percent in the July-September period
after a slight rise in the previous quarter and a 7.1 percent
drop in the first quarter.

could force on Tel Aviv significant foreign policy decisions.
