# Nominations Committee Selects Students For Housing Panel
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Three members of the ASSU
Nominations Committee decided last
night whom to appoint to the housing
subcommittee of the Committee On
Student Services (COSS) but declined
to reveal the names of the three
students.
ASSU President Mike Herman,
nominations committee chairman,
stated that the three members agreed
to consider the subcommittee as an
official University committee.
Herman said the committee's policy
prevents him from releasing the new
members names until the ASSU Senate
passes upon the Committee's
recommendations. The Senate will
consider the Committee's

appointments Monday. President
Richard Lyman and COSS must also
approve the members.
Herman said publication of the
members' names would have a "grave
influence on the nominations in the
Senate."
Three of the nominations
committee's seven members have
resigned since last year and one did
not attend last night's meeting.
Undergraduate 800 Bacon one of the
deciding members, was not available
for comment. Graduate student
Barbara Glenn refused to comment.
Subcommittee's Concern
COSS chairman Suzi Harmatz
previously mentioned that the
subcommittee will be concerned with
resident associate (RA) selection and
theme houses.
On the housing scene, housing dean
Larry Horton said he is continuing a
series of question and answer sessions
at various dormitories.
Although he termed his talks "low
key," Horton said there are still a
number of students who do not
understand the draw-exemption,
fraternity and housing issues.
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
plans to conduct its own "road shows"
next week, following the Horton-style
presentation, IFC President Mike
Nilsson said.
No IFC
Nilsson also stated that the IFC has
decided not to hire a lawyer. The IFC
previously considered retaining legal
counsel because it did not agree with
the University lawyers' interpretation
of the proposed regulations to Title IX
of the Federal Education
Admendments Act of 1972.
Instead of tackling the legal aspects
of possible housing proposals, Nilsson
said he is trying to inform the students
of the importance of fraternities.
One of his projects is a letter to
freshmen explaining fraternities and
the housing dilemma. "The freshmen
have been here five weeks and have no
perspective on the problem," Nilsson
exclaimed.
He said he is also investigating the
possibility of reviving sororities on
campus. He mentioned that four

UC-Berkeley sorority presidents have
told him that their nationals are
interested in re-establishing sororities
here after a 30-year absence.
The IFC will survey the student
body for interest in sororities, Nilsson
remarked. He said the actual method
of polling the students has not been
decided yet.
