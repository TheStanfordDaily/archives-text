# 150 At Placement Center Protest Marine Recruiting
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
More than 150 people yesterday
protested against on-campus recruiting
by the U.S. Marine Corps, but Marine
recruiters conducted interviews as
scheduled and will return to campus
today.
A few demonstrators waited all
morning outside the Career Planning
and Placement Center while two
recruiting officers inside interviewed
one student. By the time the
Placement Center was locked at noon,
nearly 100 protesters were marching in
a large circle outside the front
entrance, chanting and carrying signs.
During a peaceful noon-hour rally,
the crowd swelled to more than 150.
Some protesters shouted "Work,
study, get ahead, kill" at the
uniformed recruiters when they
returned to the center around 1 p.m.
The Marines crossed the picket lines
and entered the building without
incident.
One student pushed suddenly
through the crowd, shouted that
demonstrators should respect the
rights of students who wanted to talk
to the Marines, and followed the
officers into the building.
Other demonstrators did not
attempt to enter the Placement
Center, and the crowd quickly left the
scene after the recruiters entered the
building.
The Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC), described by its members as an
"umbrella organization for radical
individuals on campus supporting the
liberation of all peoples at home and
abroad," organized the protest rally.
"As an organizational policy we
decided not to talk to the Marines,"
explained ARC member Seth Foldy.
"We wanted students to question
themselves. We speak to the students."
Jim Regan, an ARC member who
signed up for a 1 p.m. interview with
the recruiters, did not keep the
appointment. Regan said he signed the
list as a "symbolic action."
He explained, "I didn't intend to
talk to them." Regan, a sophomore

not registered this quarter, tried to
enter the Placement Center to erase his
name and found the doors locked.
Frances A. Holtslander, supervisor
of recruiting activities at the
Placement Center, said it was a
"normal routine" to lock the doors
during lunchtime. The demonstration
did not disrupt Placement Center
activities, she added.
Yesterday's demonstration was the
first organized resistance to on-campus
recruiting since Nov. 3, 1972, when
100 demonstrators unsuccessfully
attempted to prevent Honeywell, Inc.
recruiters from interviewing students.
One of the Marines, First Lt.

Robert Grice, said, "There seems to be
a resurgence this fall of student protest
against Marine recruiting." Grice, a
recruiting officer for the Northern
California area, said he also
encountered resistance at Cabrillo
Junior College and the University of
California at Santa Cruz.
Grice and Staff Sgt. Alan Derosier,
said only two students here had
expressed "serious interest" in
recruiting interviews.
Grice will return to campus alone
tomorrow, although no students have
requested interviews. "Protest is
aggravating," he said, "but it does
liven up the day."

recruiting interviews.
Grice will return to campus alone
tomorrow, although no students have
requested interviews. "Protest is
aggravating," he said, "but it does
liven up the day."

DEJA VU—Reminiscent of similar portests against on-campus recruitment in years gone by, this was the scene at the
Career Planning and Placement Center yesterday. More than 150 demonstrators turned out to protest recruiting by the
U.S. Marine Corps. The demonstration was peaceful and a Marine recruiter will return today.
More than 150 people yesterday
protested against on-campus recruiting
by the U.S. Marine Corps, but Marine
recruiters conducted interviews as
scheduled and will return to campus
today.
A few demonstrators waited all
morning outside the Career Planning
and Placement Center while two
recruiting officers inside interviewed
one student. By the time the
Placement Center was locked at noon,
nearly 100 protesters were marching in
a large circle outside the front
entrance, chanting and carrying signs.
During a peaceful noon-hour rally,
the crowd swelled to more than 150.
Some protesters shouted "Work,
study, get ahead, kill" at the
uniformed recruiters when they
returned to the center around 1 p.m.
The Marines crossed the picket lines
and entered the building without
incident.
One student pushed suddenly
through the crowd, shouted that
demonstrators should respect the
rights of students who wanted to talk
to the Marines, and followed the
officers into the building.
Other demonstrators did not
attempt to enter the Placement
Center, and the crowd quickly left the
scene after the recruiters entered the
building.
The Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC), described by its members as an
"umbrella organization for radical
individuals on campus supporting the
liberation of all peoples at home and
abroad," organized the protest rally.
"As an organizational policy we
decided not to talk to the Marines,"
explained ARC member Seth Foldy.
"We wanted students to question
themselves. We speak to the students."
Jim Regan, an ARC member who
signed up for a 1 p.m. interview with
the recruiters, did not keep the
appointment. Regan said he signed the
list as a "symbolic action."
He explained, "I didn't intend to
talk to them." Regan, a sophomore

not registered this quarter, tried to
enter the Placement Center to erase his
name and found the doors locked.
Frances A. Holtslander, supervisor
of recruiting activities at the
Placement Center, said it was a
"normal routine" to lock the doors
during lunchtime. The demonstration
did not disrupt Placement Center
activities, she added.
Yesterday's demonstration was the
first organized resistance to on-campus
recruiting since Nov. 3, 1972, when
100 demonstrators unsuccessfully
attempted to prevent Honeywell, Inc.
recruiters from interviewing students.
One of the Marines, First Lt.

Robert Grice, said, "There seems to be
a resurgence this fall of student protest
against Marine recruiting." Grice, a
recruiting officer for the Northern
California area, said he also
encountered resistance at Cabrillo
Junior College and the University of
California at Santa Cruz.
Grice and Staff Sgt. Alan Derosier,
said only two students here had
expressed "serious interest" in
recruiting interviews.
Grice will return to campus alone
tomorrow, although no students have
requested interviews. "Protest is
aggravating," he said, "but it does
