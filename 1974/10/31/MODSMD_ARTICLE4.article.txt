# Professors Approve Lecture Note Service

### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
ASSU Lecture Notes program
director Vic Petroff disclosed
yesterday that 11 professors have
firmly approved of the proposed
service in their classes.
Professors in the other three
courses that the service hopes to cover
this winter quarter have approved the
service "tentatively, pending
discussions with other faculty and
students," said Petroff.
He said the service is designed to
provide low-cost lecture notes to
students, allowing them to spend more
time listening to lectures.
Two of the originally planned 16
courses have since been excluded
because students supposedly have no
need for notes in them, Petroff
admitted.
In one, Communication 2258,
students listen to guest speakers and
write brief critiques of them.
The other course, Biology 24Y, is
an experimental lab. The professor,
Peter Ray, said earlier that students
don't need notes in that class,

according to Petroff.
Two professors have refused
permission for the program to operate
in their classes, Petroff said.
Psychology Prof. Barbara Saskett
has said she liked the program.
However, she said that students in her
class, Psychology 1, would not need
the notes because she follows the text
very closely.
Prof. Gordon Craig, chairman of
the History Department, also refused
permission, according to Petroff, who
added that he "did not understand his
[Craig's] reasoning." Craig has said "I
have my doubts as to what the
pedagogical value of such a program
would be. I don't think the advantages
are as clearly defined as the ASSU
would like us to believe."
Next week the service will begin
accepting applications for student
notetakers, Petroff said, adding that
more than 10 students have contacted
him about the jobs.
In two weeks Petroff plans to
conduct interviews and make choices.
To be a notetaker, each candidate
supposedly must:
—have a concentration of courses in
the subject to be covered.
—have obtained an A in the course
previously.
—have obtained approval of the
professor teaching the course.
All of the 14 classes now planned
for the pilot program had enrollments
of more than 170 last spring.
The original business plan for the
service says that 57 subscribers are
needed in 15 classes if the service is to
break even.
"Chemistry professors almost
guaranteed that every student in their
classes will want notes," Petroff said,
adding that that could mean
approximately 800 subscribers in just
four classes.

The pilot program for the ASSU
Lecture Notes Service plans to offer
notes for the following classes during
winter quarter:
Biology 22 (Section 1) Principles of
Biology
Biology 108 (Section 1) Organismal
Development
Chemistry 33 (Section 1-4) Structure
and Reactivity
Economics 1 (Section 1) Elementary
Economics*
Physics 23 (Section 1) Electricity and
Optics
Physics 51 (Section 2) Mechanics
Psychology 60 Statistical Methods
Psychology 130 (Section 1) Psychology

To be a notetaker, each candidate
supposedly must:
—have a concentration of courses in
the subject to be covered.
—have obtained an A in the course
previously.
—have obtained approval of the
professor teaching the course.
All of the 14 classes now planned
for the pilot program had enrollments
of more than 170 last spring.
The original business plan for the
service says that 57 subscribers are
needed in 15 classes if the service is to
break even.
"Chemistry professors almost
guaranteed that every student in their
classes will want notes," Petroff said,
adding that that could mean
approximately 800 subscribers in just
four classes.

The pilot program for the ASSU
Lecture Notes Service plans to offer
notes for the following classes during
winter quarter:
Biology 22 (Section 1) Principles of
Biology
Biology 108 (Section 1) Organismal
Development
Chemistry 33 (Section 1-4) Structure
and Reactivity
Economics 1 (Section 1) Elementary
Economics*
Physics 23 (Section 1) Electricity and
Optics
Physics 51 (Section 2) Mechanics
Psychology 60 Statistical Methods
Psychology 130 (Section 1) Psychology
of Sex Roles
Psychology 157 (Section 1) Sleep and
Dreams
Human Biology 3A The Human
Organism*
Human Biology 3B The Person and the
Social Structure*
♦Professors have not given final
approval.
ASSU Lecture Notes program
director Vic Petroff disclosed
yesterday that 11 professors have
firmly approved of the proposed
service in their classes.
Professors in the other three
courses that the service hopes to cover
this winter quarter have approved the
service "tentatively, pending
discussions with other faculty and
students," said Petroff.
He said the service is designed to
provide low-cost lecture notes to
students, allowing them to spend more
time listening to lectures.
Two of the originally planned 16
courses have since been excluded
because students supposedly have no
need for notes in them, Petroff
admitted.
In one, Communication 2258,
students listen to guest speakers and
write brief critiques of them.
The other course, Biology 24Y, is
an experimental lab. The professor,
Peter Ray, said earlier that students
don't need notes in that class,

according to Petroff.
Two professors have refused
permission for the program to operate
in their classes, Petroff said.
Psychology Prof. Barbara Saskett
has said she liked the program.
However, she said that students in her
class, Psychology 1, would not need
the notes because she follows the text
very closely.
Prof. Gordon Craig, chairman of
the History Department, also refused
permission, according to Petroff, who
added that he "did not understand his
[Craig's] reasoning." Craig has said "I
have my doubts as to what the
pedagogical value of such a program
would be. I don't think the advantages
are as clearly defined as the ASSU
would like us to believe."
Next week the service will begin
accepting applications for student
notetakers, Petroff said, adding that
more than 10 students have contacted
him about the jobs.
In two weeks Petroff plans to
conduct interviews and make choices.
