# Construction Of New Neurosciences Unit Begun
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Site preparation work began this week for the Stanford
Medical School's Sherman Fairchild Center for the
Neurosciences, a $9.75 million facility which will be built
south of the Medical Center.
Scheduled for completion in August 1976, the
three-story building will house the departments of
anatomy-physiology and neurobiology, a new department.
The center will include a main building housing the two
departments, an adjacent auditorium which will provide
seating for 400 persons, a lobby and display area, enclosed
facilities for a projection room, preparation rooms, storage
and administrative space.
The Fairchild Foundation of Greenwich, Conn, has
pledged $8.25 million for construction of the center, which
will be named after the founder of Fairchild Camera and
Instrument Corp. and Fairchild Industries.
Relocated Facilities
Edmond Leys, senior planner in the Planning Office and
project manager, explained that site preparation involved
clearing the site of shrubs, trees and volleyball and
basketball courts. The athletic facilities were relocated.
Leys and Peter Carpenter, assistant vice president for
medical affairs, were both optimistic the project could open
in September 1976.
The building was designed by the architectural firm of
Stone, Marraccini and Patterson of San Francisco. A
number of sub-contractors are involved in construction of

the center, with Turner Construction Co. of San Francisco
serving as construction manager.
Other Projects
Three other medical center construction projects are at
various stages of completion: a new hospital wing, the
Renal Care Unit Building and the Governor's Lane
complex.
The hospital wing, will add support facilities, including
25 intensive care beds, increased emergency services,
radiology, cardiology, surgical pathology and
post-anesthesia recovery.
Construction of the wing has been plagued by bad
weather and labor disputes, but is expected to be
completed and in operation by December 1975.
Budget Boosted
The University Board of Trustees initially approved a
$9.5 million budget for the project, but recently revised
that figure to $12.6 million due to increased construction
and equipment costs and code requirements.
Carpenter said that even with the increased budget, the
project has been scaled down by a decision to complete
first only those parts that are most crucial.
A substantial portion of the interior of the building and
some remodeling and equipment purchases have been
deferred until funds become available, he added.
Fundraising Intensified
