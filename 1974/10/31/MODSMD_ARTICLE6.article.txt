Bank Rip Off
Editor:
Monday afternoon a foreign
visitor told me that the campus
branch of Wells Fargo Bank had
just charged him 50 cents for
breaking a $2O bill and making
change. He said that, when
questioned, the teller told him
that it is Wells Fargo policy to
charge for making change.
I called the bank and spoke to
the manager, Adams, who said
that he had no knowledge of such
policy. He said, however, that the
operations section might have
instituted such a policy due to a
change shortage. Adams said that
if the man would return to the
bank, he would speak to him
personally. He did so, received an
apology, his money and a promise
that it would not happen again.
This morning, Adams told me
that there had been a breakdown
in communications within the
bank, and that the tellers had
gotten the wrong impression. How
can a teller have gotten the
impression that it is bank policy
to charge for change? It does seem
strange.
Yesterday, I called the office
of the Regional Administrator of
National Banks. I was told that
banks are empowered to deal in
currency and coin, but that there
is no law authorizing them to levy
a tax for making change. On the
other hand, there is no law
prohibiting such charges. He said
that such charges might be made
in order to discourage use of a
bank by coin collectors, small
merchants, and individuals who
do not have an account with that
bank.
If banks refuse to make
change, or charge for it, then
businesses will follow suit,
and...
On top of everything else, are
we to be denied the right to
exchange our worthless paper for
1 -worthless funny money?

Reply On Agnews
Editor:
It would have been honest
reporting If Betty Goodwin in the
Oct. 22 Daily had stated that she
only saw 60 patients out of
Agnew's 835. She accurately
described the residents in the
"lowest functioning ward." They
require 24-hr. continuous medical
and nursing care to stay alive.
Of the 26 males Goodwin saw
in the "other ward," 16 are in
classes of Metropolitan Adult
Education learning speech,
language and sensory stimulation;
four are in Arts and Crafts; four in
sensory motor programs in
addition to self-care, dressing
skills, etc. All told there are six
programs at Agnews designed to
meet the particular 1 need, skill
level, social and emotional growth
of each resident.
My son, age 23, has been at
Agnews seven years. Most of his
skills, work activities, improved
social behavior has been the result
of Agnews program. As a parent I
have felt only gratification for the
many hours of tender loving care
and encouragement he has
received from the staff.
So please don't allow
sensational journalism to
encourage the already prevalent
stereotype that hospitals such as
Agnews provide care for only the
most severely retarded.

- Endorses Dymally
Editor:
It's easy to overlook the
Lieutenant Governor's race in
Tuesday's election, but for
students at Stanford and
statewide, I beleive that it has a
special meaning, and a special
foreboding.

As a member of the state |
Senate for eight years, I am fully
familiar with the records of John
Harmer and Mervyn Dymally, and
it would be hard to imagine
candidates more opposite in
philosophies and voting records
on issues of concern in the college
and university communities.
The lieutenant governor, as
you know, is a voting member of
the Board of Regents and an ex
officio member of the state
college trustees. I have seen
Dymally, the Democratic
candidate, regularly support the
causes which I believe are the
most vital concerns to the great
majority of today's students:
equal rights for women and
minorities, decriminalization of
marijuana use, better pay and
working conditions, expanded
child care facilities, medical care
for all, improved education at all
levels.
He authored the 18-year-old
vote and equal rights
amendments. He has consistently
opposed tuition, and has
consistently voted to preserve
academic freedoms and to expand
student and citizen rights.
By contrast, I have seen his
Republican opponent, John
Harmer, vote against such
measures almost without
exception. His support of bills to
permit wiretapping, and to permit
court use of evidence seized in
illegal seraches, his support for *
movie censorship and for the
death penalty these do not
sound to me like the stands of the
person who should be in the
second highest position in
California state government, one
step away from the Governorship.
If you share these concerns,
then you won't sit home on
election day. This is one
outstanding instance where your
vote could make the difference.

Athletic Differences
Editor:
Recent events once again point
up the differences between
athletics at Stanford and at some
of our Pacific Eight competitors.
Because freshmen can now
play varsity ball and because of
transfers from junior colleges,
freshman-junior varsity football
teams are no longer needed to
feed personnel to varsity football
teams. Therefore, it is no surprise
that three of our large
competitors simultaneously
"discovered" that they no longer
have enough personnel to man
their freshman-junior varsity
football teams and cancelled these
programs.
This means that a student at
one of these schools cannot have
the pleasure of playing
intercollegiate ball unless he
happens to be practically of
professional caliber. How
different the situation is at
Stanford!
Any Stanford student can go
out for freshman-junior varsity
football and play. It appears to
me that the team has about 80
kids, most of them walk-ons.
They have great spirit,
coaching, play top-notch football,
and have a great time. At the
recent scrimmage with San
Francisco State, it was obvious
that the coaches made certain that
everyone played. These students,
most of them excellent athletes,
would be relegated to the role of
spectators at some of our
competing institutions.
It is apparent to me that the
Stanford athletic program has the
interests and welfare of our
students as its first priority. It is a
proper program for a quality
academic institution, and our
students and alumni should be
made aware of this.
