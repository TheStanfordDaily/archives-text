# Asking The Right Questions
## 
### Bruce Kadden 
Asking the right questions is an art that
every news reporter must learn if he is going
to advance within his field. Similarly, high
ranking government officials and the upper
echelons of University administrators must
learn how to respond to these inquiries.
It sounds easy enough on paper, but the
responses that are given to probing questions
are not always the one that reporters are
hoping to hear.
Government officials and University
administrators seem to be masters of artfully
eluding the most difficult questions.
Working as a reporter becomes a game of
trying to ask the questions that will get the
real answers and put the interviewee on the
spot. This type of questioning becomes
increasingly important during election
campaigning, where voters want straight
answers.
Learning to phrase a question properly
takes experience. The important point to
remember is to make the questions as specific
as possible.
This forces either a direct answer, or an
obvious avoidance of the issue. For example,
one may want to ask a political candidate
about his views on marijuana.
"What do you think of marijuana?" will
undoubtably elicit a long-winded response,
with little substantive information, especially
if the candidate maintains a precarious
position.
"What do you think of decriminalizing
marijuana?" is better, but still allows the
politician to squirm out of a straight answer.
The best question would be something
like: "Do you favor the decriminalization of

marijuana?" This forces either a yes or no
response, followed by elaboration, or a
long-winded diatribe which clearly avoids the
issue.
But it is not always this easy to find the
right questions because most issues are not as
cut and dried as marijuana.
Crime is such an issue. Everyone is against
crime and all politicians are quick to note
they are appalled with the level of crime in
the streets and would work to curb the
run-away rate.
But what difference does it make? The
important questions that should be asked
deal with how one would go about fighting
crime. Examples are: Do you favor the death
penalty for certain crimes? Do you favor
abolition of non-victim crimes?
Of course, some candidates proudly
provide answers, but only if they have a firm
position. State Sen. H.L. Richardson,
running against Sen. Alan Cranston, is
quite frank that he favors the death penalty
for certain crimes and that he favors retaining
penalties for victimless crimes. Richardson
will lose by a gigantic margin, but at least
everyone knows where he stands.
The issue of environmental protection is
similar to that of crime, but even presents
more difficulties. Everyone is against air
pollution, but many candidates are more
strongly against laws to enforce clean-air
standards.
How do you ask a politician about the
environment? One of the easiest ways is to
ask his opinion on propositions that deal
with the environment, such as Prop. 17 in

this election and Prop. 20 in the 1972
election.
A candidate can easily say he'll work for a
clean environment and turn right around and
vote against measures that are directed
toward this goal. Asking about specific bills is
also very effective at getting at a candidates
true position.
On campus issues, it is easier to avoid
answering questions, because the issues are
not always clear.
One may ask an administrator how he
feels about including all residents within the
housing draw and find out that he thinks the
draw is a good way to ration the available
housing, though it is not clear that all houses
have to be within the draw.
Simply asking: "Do you think fraternities
should be put into the housing draw in order
to solve the discrimination problem?"puts the
administrator in the hot seat. It deserves, but
rarely gets, a yes or no answer. Instead, one is
told that the issue is not that simple, and
indeed it isn't. But in the end the solution
will either put frats in the draw or leave them
out, so a yes or no answer should be
expected.
The only moral to this short lesson in
asking questions is that the specific,
well-thought-out questions will get the best
answers.
General questions will receive their just
reward too: long-winded answers that say
virtually nothing.
