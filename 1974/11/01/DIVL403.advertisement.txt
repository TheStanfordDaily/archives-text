On The Meaning Of Liberal Arts
This article is written in response to an article by Crowe and O Laughlin
titled "A Study of Professors" which appeared in the Oct. 24 issue of the
STANFORD DAILY. Ms. Patricia Crowe was hired by me to interview
professors at Stanford. This involved a very lengthy and time consuming
series of exams. She was then given the assignment of interviewing two
professors. Several days later, and for reasons which remain a mystery, she
quit. I have no acquaintance with Prof. O'Laughlin. . 01
Ms Crowe implied in her article that I have been evasive. On Sept. 21,
30 and Oct. 16 I wrote to her asking about any questions she might have,
and I offered to answer in writing if she wished. Since then, I have repeated
my offer in person and on the telephone and she has had no questions.'
Because of misunderstandings created by the Crowe and O Laughlin
article, I would like to explain the purpose of my research and why it is
well worth the large sum of money which they are very concerned about.
In order to do this, it is at least very helpful to digress and discuss some of
the lesser understood aspects of liberal arts education.
Traditionally liberal arts has meant exposure to a wide variety of
disciplines. Hidden behind this tradition is a philosophical subject which is
rarely discussed. Open mindedness usually means to have the capacity to
understand opposing or alternative points of view. Thus the traditional
practice of liberal arts carries the assumption that the result would be open
mindedness among the graduates. Unfortunately, open mindedness is rarely
the result, in large part because the problem is not generally understood.
In order for a persorf to understand alternative or opposing points of
view, it is at least highly desirable that he have the courage to do so In
other words, the problem of teaching open mindedness is also the problem
of teaching courage or self confidence. One of the first obstacles to solving
this problem are the myths and superstitions of our culture. Myths and
superstitions are usually parochial; that is, shared only by smaller groups
within a society. Thus in the normal growing up process a person is
exposed to the alternative or opposing points of view. One might ask,
"Then why does a person accept a myth or superstition when he is exposed
to opposing points of view?" The answer is that often a very important
subject is missing from his education. To be specific, the person who
accepts a myth or superstition fails to understand the importance of peer
group pressure. It turns out that some experiments were done on this
subject was early as 1947 at Swarthmore College. Unfortunately, the
results were so shocking that the professor could not accept the results,
and so he changed the experiment until he got results which were
acceptable. When he did publish, he neglected to mention these changes
and how important they were. The experiment was fairly simple. A student
would receive a request that he volunteer for some experiments in
Psychology. If he agreed, he would then receive a request to appear at a
room in the Psych. Dept. at a certain hour. When he arrived, he would find
from three to twenty students and a professor. The
explain that this was an experiment in length perception.H®*ome
x 11 cards, on which were drawn some lines which looked like they might
be an experiment in optical illusions. For example, some lines were thick
and the sides not parallel, while others were thin. The differences in length
were not subtle. The smallest difference was % of an inch and some
differences were a factor of two to one. The professor explained that he
wanted each student to tell which line was the longest. However, the actual
purpose of the experiment was to- find out what a student would do when
everyone else in the room by prearrangement said that the Ipngest line was
the shortest In the early experiments, which I took part in, 98/o ot tne
students tested flunked these tests. That is, they would conform in some
degree to the apparent majority opinion. In later experiments which were
published, the conformity was only 75%, a difference of more than a
factor of ten. However, the experimental differences in the two versions of
this experiment were very subtle. In the earlier experiments, something
happened which the professor did not plan, apparently did not expect, and
apparently he was not even aware of for severa.l months. If anyone had tne
temerity to call the lines the way he saw them, then spontaneously
someone in the room would raise an eyebrow or there might be a snicker.
That subtle difference produced the profound change in the numerical
results If you would like to read about the later experiments, they are
published in Scientific American, Nov. 1955, "Opinion and Social
PrB This e br > ing S s' E us AS to h 'the subject of my research. As Ms. Crowe has
mentioned, the research deals with indoctrination. In case that word is not
familiar, I will define it as a hypnotic loss of awareness of oppos ng or
alternative points of view, which often results from a person s inability to
cope with his own peer group pressure. In other words, indoctrination is a
very important factor ih why people accept myths and superstitions It
turns out that myths and superstitions get a very cursory treatment at
Stanford, and because of this there is a very broad range of topics which
are omitted from many courses, all having to do with the general problem
of why words have not been effective in settling certain disputes. For
example, there is my dispute with Ms. Crowe. .
There is a philosophical theorem which is especially useful here. The
theorem is known as the Socratic Theorem. Let us consider two people
who have a disagreement which they agree should bej? is £" ss ®^ v b ® c f a pf® t °,
the desirability of finding a settlement. Socrates argues (byway of Plato)
that it is sufficient if one be willing to ask questions and the ot her be
willing to answer, and it makes no difference who is corr fs t ; h r ° b ® the
let us consider two people A and B, and let us suppose that A asks the
questions. Consider three cases:
1 If A is correct, then A by asking questions gives B an
opportunity to reconsider his position from As point ot
view. B will see his mistake and change his mind.
2. If B is correct, then A by asking gives himself an
opportunity to learn from B. A will see where he made a
mistake and change his mind. ...
3 If both are not correct, then Aby asking questions will
bring this to light and the grounds for the disagreement
will be removed.
Philosophically speaking, the Socratic Theorem is excellent; but in practice
it rarely works in a wide variety of discussions. However, there are ™any
valuable things which can be learned by careful observation of why the
theorem does not work. In practice, you will discover that you wil usually
reach a point where a perfectly normal, intelligent person will be so
disturbed by a question that he will not be able to remember it 'o®9
enough to respond. Instead, he will usually call his questioner a bad name
and then leave. In the vernacular, these topics are referred to as sacred
cows, hand ups and blind spots.
One might ask, "How widespread is this problem? The problem is very
widespread and the 98% figure mentioned earlier is a good beginning
number. As a brief beginning,.consider the following table of topics.
Table 1
freedom repression faith existence of a God
liberty oppression truth reality
justice suppression exploitation pig (constabulary variety)
rights humility sin dictatorship of the proletariate
morality socialism ' aggression attitudes towards poverty
immorality evolution obligation indoctrination
AH of the above topics have one thing in common. Any discussion of
these topics can rapidly lead to a discussion of closed mindedness, or
indoctrination, or the effects of peer group pressure. The close observer
may have noticed that there are numerous courses at Stanford which are
directly related to many of these topics. Thus, Stanford is an ideal place to
begin mapping out those areas of discourse which are missing in liberal arts
education. . . , ,
For those who like to experiment, One might go around and ask for
some definitions of these words. If you succeed in getting a definition,
then ask to have it applied to some specific examples. Explain that what
you want is a definition which will enable you to decide which of two
conflicting positions is most believable. This is when you will begin to
observe the effects of peer group pressure. If you ask these questions in a
room, make sure the door is left open and don't stand in the way. People
can get very upset by questions on these topics, in large part because they
grow up without ever confronting the problem. This is why for my
research I hire very special students as assistants. ti,. o i v ,
There are numerous other topics which can be more effectively
understood with an understanding of indoctrination or sacred cows or hang
ups. For example, consider the violence in Ireland, the Middle East and
Cyprus, skyjacking and crime, the use of strikes to settle wage disputes,
and much more. In other words, I claim that because of defference to
mvths and superstitions (see Table 1) there are a great many topics omitted
from a Stanford liberal arts education. Furthermore, one ofthe ways people
learn to run away from these questions is that they follow the example of
their parents and teachers. It is a self perpetuat.ng problem For some
specific examples of topics which some people had great difficulty in
discussing, consider during Hitler's time the German notion of the master
race, the 9 German notion that Jews were to blame for all the economic
troubles of Germany, and the way in which many Germans were able to
reconcile Hitler's speeches about hate with their own Christianity. ItMs
much easier to see the blind spots in other cultures. Closer to home, 1 1 just
takes much lonqer to explain the blindnesses in common usages. In order
to sketch the pmblems associated with a word like freedom or repression
would take an article about as long as this. Perhaps it will suffice to say
that the blindnesses in Hitler's Germany is already too close to home for
some professors. The subject of indoctrination is probably the most

difficult to discuss in our culture. Many of you probably just are not

in some stupid war. If that happens I believe you will develop an intense
interest in the general problem of why words were not more effective in
settling differences of opinion. As I have discussed above, there have been
millions of people in this world who have been brave enough to die for
ideals that were absurd. The pity of it is that so few have been brave
enough to think about the opposing points of view. . rnncWor
To give some idea of the scope of the problem closer to home, consider
the question which lam sure has been raised at Stanford m a n y tims -
is the question of grades. "Is it reasonable to expect a student to raise
challenging quest ms and nail his professor to the wall, if in order to get
good grades he is also expected to please his professor?" My research
Doints to a very depressing answer to that question. I believe it is desirable
in have a liberal arts course in which grades should be abandoned,
including even the idea of pass-fail. With just a little courage, the content
of liberal arts could be made much more relevant and interesting. Further,
the effects of grade pressure, as a form of social pressure should not be
Und Mv e aooloaies to any professor who may have been misled by any of my
assistants Profabfy because of my description of the problem (and some
testlnaon their own) I know that some of my assistants have not wanted
to a"ve professors the option of refusing to answer questions merely
because fhe questions were part of my research project. Many of my
assistants have a deep personal interest in finding out just what was missing
from their Stanford education and they have wanted to test my predictions

of the Committee on Humeri Subjects, it is my guess thath«.willwrite.to
me in due time. In the meantime, it is my hope that the Stanford
community will bear with me in the problems whichi I have in gathering the
special information which I want. It is my b °P®Jt In the data
