better value now than even a few months ago!

your patience
is rewarded
The '75 Sherwoods are in, at last. The new
S-7110 is a potent successor to the old
S-7100a . . . worth the wait, with 40 watts
RMS power, better tuner specs, and cleaner
phono circuits. It's even more attractive!
We've combined it with a carefree BSR
changer with damped cue/pause, an ADC
elliptical cartridge, and a pair of Audex
wide-range speakers. We include no-cost
service for 5 full years, and true savings
you're looking for now. So go ahead . . .
indulge. You'll be glad you did!
