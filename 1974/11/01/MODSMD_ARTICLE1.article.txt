Mason Blacher, a graduate student
who had submitted a proposal to
reorganize Chaparral, has announced
that he plans to "bow out of the
situation."
"My feeling is just not to pursue
this if the Pub Board is not going to
listen," Blacher said.
At a meeting last Friday, the
Publications Board again refused to
recognize either Blacher or Mike
Dornheim, editor of the "unofficial"
Chaparral, as the true editor. Pub
Board members generally agreed that
they did not have the authority to
choose the editorof a publication."We

of the Chaparral," said Board member
Jon Braun.
In an effort to utilize the space in
the Storke Publications Building which
has been unoccupied since the
Chaparral was closed this summer, the
Pub Board reallocated one half of the
Chaparral's space to the new weekly
Live Oak for the remainder of the
academic year. At that time, it will
revert automatically to the Chaparral.
Blacher said he decided not to

Board Chairman Rich Jaroslovsky
"doesn't want to be a party to an
arbitration proceding."
Jaroslovsky disagreed. "As
[Blacher] can testify, I spent nearly
two hours trying to arbitrate between
him and Dornheim.
"In the end," continued
Jaroslovsky, "something might have
worked out if Mason had been willing
to compromise." According to
Jaroslovsky, Blacher refused to have
Dornheim serve even in an advisory
capacity if Blacher were given control
of the Chaparral. •
"If Mason is more willing to work it
out now," said Jaroslovsky, "I'm just
as willing to go at it as I was before."
Blacher claimed he no longer feels
"confident about funding." Earlier, he
